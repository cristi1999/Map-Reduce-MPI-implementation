hard 1

i 1
put 1
the 1
cheese 1
carefully 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
as 1
i 1
slip 1
outside 1
our 1
part 1
of 1
district 1
nicknamed 1
the 1
seam 1
is 1
usually 1
crawling 1
with 1
coal 1
miners 1
heading 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
morning 1
shift 1
at 1
this 1
hour 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
with 1
hunched 1
shoulders 1
swollen 1
knuckles 1
many 1
who 1
have 1
long 1
since 1
stopped 1
trying 1
to 1
scrub 1
the 1
coal 1
dust 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
broken 1
nails 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
their 1
sunken 1
faces 1
but 1
today 1
the 1
black 1
cinder 1
streets 1
are 1
empty 1
shutters 1
on 1
the 1
squat 1
gray 1
houses 1
are 1
closed 1
the 1
reaping 1
isnt 1
until 1
two 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
sleep 1
in 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
our 1
house 1
is 1
almost 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
seam 1
i 1
only 1
have 1
to 1
pass 1
a 1
few 1
gates 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
scruffy 1
field 1
called 1
the 1
meadow 1
separating 1
the 1
meadow 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
in 1
fact 1
enclosing 1
all 1
of 1
district 1
is 1
a 1
high 1
chainlink 1
fence 1
topped 1
with 1
barbedwire 1
loops 1
in 1
theory 1
its 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
electrified 1
twentyfour 1
hours 1
a 1
day 1
as 1
a 1
deterrent 1
to 1
the 1
predators 1
that 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
packs 1
of 1
wild 1
dogs 1
lone 1
cougars 1
bears 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
threaten 1
our 1
streets 1
but 1
since 1
were 1
lucky 1
to 1
get 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
of 1
electricity 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
its 1
usually 1
safe 1
to 1
touch 1
even 1
so 1
i 1
always 1
take 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
listen 1
carefully 1
for 1
the 1
hum 1
that 1
means 1
the 1
fence 1
is 1
live 1
right 1
now 1
its 1
silent 1
as 1
a 1
stone 1
concealed 1
by 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
bushes 1
i 1
flatten 1
out 1
on 1
my 1
belly 1
and 1
slide 1
under 1
a 1
twofoot 1
stretch 1
thats 1
been 1
loose 1
for 1
years 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
other 1
weak 1
spots 1
in 1
the 1
fence 1
but 1
this 1
one 1
is 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
home 1
i 1
almost 1
always 1
enter 1
the 1
woods 1
here 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
im 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
i 1
retrieve 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
from 1
a 1
hollow 1
log 1
electrified 1
or 1
not 1
the 1
fence 1
has 1
been 1
successful 1
at 1
keeping 1
the 1
flesheaters 1
out 1
of 1
district 1
inside 1
the 1
woods 1
they 1
roam 1
freely 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
added 1
concerns 1
like 1
venomous 1
snakes 1
rabid 1
animals 1
and 1
no 1
real 1
paths 1
to 1
follow 1
but 1
theres 1
also 1
food 1
if 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
my 1
father 1
knew 1
and 1
he 1
taught 1
me 1
some 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
blown 1
to 1
bits 1
in 1
a 1
mine 1
explosion 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
even 1
to 1
bury 1
i 1
was 1
eleven 1
then 1
five 1
years 1
later 1
i 1
still 1
wake 1
up 1
screaming 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
run 1
even 1
though 1
trespassing 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
is 1
illegal 1
and 1
poaching 1
carries 1
the 1
severest 1
of 1
penalties 1
more 1
people 1
would 1
risk 1
it 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
weapons 1
but 1
most 1
are 1
not 1
bold 1
enough 1
to 1
venture 1
out 1
with 1
just 1
a 1
knife 1
my 1
bow 1
is 1
a 1
rarity 1
crafted 1
by 1
my 1
father 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
others 1
that 1
i 1
keep 1
well 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
carefully 1
wrapped 1
in 1
waterproof 1
covers 1
my 1
father 1
could 1
have 1
made 1
good 1
money 1
selling 1
them 1
but 1
if 1
the 1
officials 1
found 1
out 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
publicly 1
executed 1
for 1
inciting 1
a 1
rebellion 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
turn 1
a 1
blind 1
eye 1
to 1
the 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
hunt 1
because 1
theyre 1
as 1
hungry 1
for 1
fresh 1
meat 1
as 1
anybody 1
is 1
in 1
fact 1
theyre 1
among 1
our 1
best 1
customers 1
but 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
someone 1
might 1
be 1
arming 1
the 1
seam 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
allowed 1
in 1
the 1
fall 1
a 1
few 1
brave 1
souls 1
sneak 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
harvest 1
apples 1
but 1
always 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
meadow 1
always 1
close 1
enough 1
to 1
run 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
district 1
if 1
trouble 1
arises 1
district 1
twelve 1
where 1
you 1
can 1
starve 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
safety 1
i 1
mutter 1
then 1
i 1
glance 1
quickly 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
even 1
here 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
nowhere 1
you 1
worry 1
someone 1
might 1
overhear 1
you 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
younger 1
i 1
scared 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
things 1
i 1
would 1
blurt 1
out 1
about 1
district 1
about 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
rule 1
our 1
country 1
panem 1
from 1
the 1
faroff 1
city 1
called 1
the 1
capitol 1
eventually 1
i 1
understood 1
this 1
would 1
only 1
lead 1
us 1
to 1
more 1
trouble 1
so 1
i 1
learned 1
to 1
hold 1
my 1
tongue 1
and 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
features 1
into 1
an 1
indifferent 1
mask 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
ever 1
read 1
my 1
thoughts 1
do 1
my 1
work 1
quietly 1
in 1
school 1
make 1
only 1
polite 1
small 1
talk 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
market 1
discuss 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
trades 1
in 1
the 1
hob 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
black 1
market 1
where 1
i 1
make 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
money 1
even 1
at 1
home 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
less 1
pleasant 1
i 1
avoid 1
discussing 1
tricky 1
topics 1
like 1
the 1
reaping 1
or 1
food 1
shortages 1
or 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
prim 1
might 1
begin 1
to 1
repeat 1
my 1
words 1
and 1
then 1
where 1
would 1
we 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
waits 1
the 1
only 1
person 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
be 1
myself 1
gale 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
muscles 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
relaxing 1
my 1
pace 1
quickening 1
as 1
i 1
climb 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
our 1
place 1
a 1
rock 1
ledge 1
overlooking 1
a 1
valley 1
a 1
thicket 1
of 1
berry 1
bushes 1
protects 1
it 1
from 1
unwanted 1
eyes 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
waiting 1
there 1
brings 1
on 1
a 1
smile 1
gale 1
says 1
i 1
never 1
smile 1
except 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
hey 1
catnip 1
says 1
gale 1
my 1
real 1
name 1
is 1
katniss 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
barely 1
whispered 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
thought 1
id 1
said 1
catnip 1
then 1
when 1
this 1
crazy 1
lynx 1
started 1
following 1
me 1
around 1
the 1
woods 1
looking 1
for 1
handouts 1
it 1
became 1
his 1
official 1
nickname 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
finally 1
had 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
lynx 1
because 1
he 1
scared 1
off 1
game 1
i 1
almost 1
regretted 1
it 1
because 1
he 1
wasnt 1
bad 1
company 1
but 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
decent 1
price 1
for 1
his 1
pelt 1
look 1
what 1
i 1
shot 1
gale 1
holds 1
up 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
with 1
an 1
arrow 1
stuck 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
laugh 1
its 1
real 1
bakery 1
bread 1
not 1
the 1
flat 1
dense 1
loaves 1
we 1
make 1
from 1
our 1
grain 1
rations 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
pull 1
out 1
the 1
arrow 1
and 1
hold 1
the 1
puncture 1
in 1
the 1
crust 1
to 1
my 1
nose 1
inhaling 1
the 1
fragrance 1
that 1
makes 1
my 1
mouth 1
flood 1
with 1
saliva 1
fine 1
bread 1
like 1
this 1
is 1
for 1
special 1
occasions 1
mm 1
still 1
warm 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
bakery 1
at 1
the 1
crack 1
of 1
dawn 1
to 1
trade 1
for 1
it 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
cost 1
you 1
just 1
a 1
squirrel 1
think 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
feeling 1
sentimental 1
this 1
morning 1
says 1
gale 1
even 1
wished 1
me 1
luck 1
well 1
we 1
all 1
feel 1
a 1
little 1
closer 1
today 1
dont 1
we 1
i 1
say 1
not 1
even 1
bothering 1
to 1
roll 1
my 1
eyes 1
prim 1
left 1
us 1
a 1
cheese 1
i 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
his 1
expression 1
brightens 1
at 1
the 1
treat 1
thank 1
you 1
prim 1
well 1
have 1
a 1
real 1
feast 1
suddenly 1
he 1
falls 1
into 1
a 1
capitol 1
accent 1
as 1
he 1
mimics 1
effie 1
trinket 1
the 1
maniacally 1
upbeat 1
woman 1
who 1
arrives 1
once 1
a 1
year 1
to 1
read 1
out 1
the 1
names 1
at 1
the 1
leaping 1
i 1
almost 1
forgot 1
happy 1
hunger 1
games 1
he 1
plucks 1
a 1
few 1
blackberries 1
from 1
the 1
bushes 1
around 1
us 1
and 1
may 1
the 1
odds 1
he 1
tosses 1
a 1
berry 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
arc 1
toward 1
me 1
i 1
catch 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
break 1
the 1
delicate 1
skin 1
with 1
my 1
teeth 1
the 1
sweet 1
tartness 1
explodes 1
across 1
my 1
tongue 1
be 1
ever 1
in 1
your 1
favor 1
i 1
finish 1
with 1
equal 1
verve 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
joke 1
about 1
it 1
because 1
the 1
alternative 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
scared 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
wits 1
besides 1
the 1
capitol 1
accent 1
is 1
so 1
affected 1
almost 1
anything 1
sounds 1
funny 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
watch 1
as 1
gale 1
pulls 1
out 1
his 1
knife 1
and 1
slices 1
the 1
bread 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
my 1
brother 1
straight 1
black 1
hair 1
olive 1
skin 1
we 1
even 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
gray 1
eyes 1
but 1
were 1
not 1
related 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
closely 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
families 1
who 1
work 1
the 1
mines 1
resemble 1
one 1
another 1
this 1
way 1
thats 1
why 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
with 1
their 1
light 1
hair 1
and 1
blue 1
eyes 1
always 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
they 1
are 1
my 1
mothers 1
parents 1
were 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
merchant 1
class 1
that 1
caters 1
to 1
officials 1
peacekeepers 1
and 1
the 1
occasional 1
seam 1
customer 1
they 1
ran 1
an 1
apothecary 1
shop 1
in 1
the 1
nicer 1
part 1
of 1
district 1
since 1
almost 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
afford 1
doctors 1
apothecaries 1
are 1
our 1
healers 1
my 1
father 1
got 1
to 1
know 1
my 1
mother 1
because 1
on 1
his 1
hunts 1
he 1
would 1
sometimes 1
collect 1
medicinal 1
herbs 1
and 1
sell 1
them 1
to 1
her 1
shop 1
to 1
be 1
brewed 1
into 1
remedies 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
really 1
loved 1
him 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
home 1
for 1
the 1
seam 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
when 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
is 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
sat 1
by 1
blank 1
and 1
unreachable 1
while 1
her 1
children 1
turned 1
to 1
skin 1
and 1
bones 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
for 1
my 1
fathers 1
sake 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
honest 1
im 1
not 1
the 1
forgiving 1
type 1
gale 1
spreads 1
the 1
bread 1
slices 1
with 1
the 1
soft 1
goat 1
cheese 1
carefully 1
placing 1
a 1
basil 1
leaf 1
on 1
each 1
while 1
i 1
strip 1
the 1
bushes 1
of 1
their 1
berries 1
we 1
settle 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
rocks 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
we 1
are 1
invisible 1
but 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
valley 1
which 1
is 1
teeming 1
with 1
summer 1
life 1
greens 1
to 1
gather 1
roots 1
to 1
dig 1
fish 1
iridescent 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
the 1
day 1
is 1
glorious 1
with 1
a 1
blue 1
sky 1
and 1
soft 1
breeze 1
the 1
foods 1
wonderful 1
with 1
the 1
cheese 1
seeping 1
into 1
the 1
warm 1
bread 1
and 1
the 1
berries 1
bursting 1
in 1
our 1
mouths 1
everything 1
would 1
be 1
perfect 1
if 1
this 1
really 1
was 1
a 1
holiday 1
if 1
all 1
the 1
day 1
off 1
meant 1
was 1
roaming 1
the 1
mountains 1
with 1
gale 1
hunting 1
for 1
tonights 1
supper 1
but 1
instead 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
names 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
out 1
we 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
gale 1
says 1
quietly 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
leave 1
the 1
district 1
run 1
off 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
we 1
could 1
make 1
it 1
says 1
gale 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
respond 1
the 1
idea 1
is 1
so 1
preposterous 1
if 1
we 1
didnt 1
have 1
so 1
many 1
kids 1
he 1
adds 1
quickly 1
theyre 1
not 1
our 1
kids 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
they 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
gales 1
two 1
little 1
brothers 1
and 1
a 1
sister 1
prim 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
throw 1
in 1
our 1
mothers 1
too 1
because 1
how 1
would 1
they 1
live 1
without 1
us 1
who 1
would 1
fill 1
those 1
mouths 1
that 1
are 1
always 1
asking 1
for 1
more 1
with 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
hunting 1
daily 1
there 1
are 1
still 1
nights 1
when 1
game 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
swapped 1
for 1
lard 1
or 1
shoelaces 1
or 1
wool 1
still 1
nights 1
when 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
our 1
stomachs 1
growling 1
i 1
never 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
kids 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
might 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
live 1
here 1
says 1
gale 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
i 1
say 1
irritated 1
forget 1
it 1
he 1
snaps 1
back 1
the 1
conversation 1
feels 1
all 1
wrong 1
leave 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
leave 1
prim 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
im 1
certain 1
i 1
love 1
and 1
gale 1
is 1
devoted 1
to 1
his 1
family 1
we 1
cant 1
leave 1
so 1
why 1
bother 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
we 1
did 1
even 1
if 1
we 1
did 1
where 1
did 1
this 1
stuff 1
about 1
having 1
kids 1
come 1
from 1
theres 1
never 1
been 1
anything 1
romantic 1
between 1
gale 1
and 1
me 1
when 1
we 1
met 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
skinny 1
twelveyearold 1
and 1
although 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
two 1
years 1
older 1
he 1
already 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
it 1
took 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
even 1
become 1
friends 1
to 1
stop 1
haggling 1
over 1
every 1
trade 1
and 1
begin 1
helping 1
each 1
other 1
out 1
besides 1
if 1
he 1
wants 1
kids 1
gale 1
wont 1
have 1
any 1
trouble 1
finding 1
a 1
wife 1
hes 1
goodlooking 1
hes 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
handle 1
the 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1
and 1
he 1
can 1
hunt 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
girls 1
whisper 1
about 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
walks 1
by 1
in 1
school 1
that 1
they 1
want 1
him 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
jealous 1
but 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
reason 1
people 1
would 1
think 1
good 1
hunting 1
partners 1
are 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
ask 1
we 1
can 1
hunt 1
fish 1
or 1
gather 1
lets 1
fish 1
at 1
the 1
lake 1
we 1
can 1
leave 1
our 1
poles 1
and 1
gather 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
get 1
something 1
nice 1
for 1
tonight 1
he 1
says 1
tonight 1
after 1
the 1
reaping 1
everyone 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
celebrate 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
people 1
do 1
out 1
of 1
relief 1
that 1
their 1
children 1
have 1
been 1
spared 1
for 1
another 1
year 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
two 1
families 1
will 1
pull 1
their 1
shutters 1
lock 1
their 1
doors 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
how 1
they 1
will 1
survive 1
the 1
painful 1
weeks 1
to 1
come 1
we 1
make 1
out 1
well 1
the 1
predators 1
ignore 1
us 1
on 1
a 1
day 1
when 1
easier 1
tastier 1
prey 1
abounds 1
by 1
late 1
morning 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
dozen 1
fish 1
a 1
bag 1
of 1
greens 1
and 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
a 1
gallon 1
of 1
strawberries 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
patch 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
but 1
gale 1
had 1
the 1
idea 1
to 1
string 1
mesh 1
nets 1
around 1
it 1
to 1
keep 1
out 1
the 1
animals 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
home 1
we 1
swing 1
by 1
the 1
hob 1
the 1
black 1
market 1
that 1
operates 1
in 1
an 1
abandoned 1
warehouse 1
that 1
once 1
held 1
coal 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
more 1
efficient 1
system 1
that 1
transported 1
the 1
coal 1
directly 1
from 1
the 1
mines 1
to 1
the 1
trains 1
the 1
hob 1
gradually 1
took 1
over 1
the 1
space 1
most 1
businesses 1
are 1
closed 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
on 1
reaping 1
day 1
but 1
the 1
black 1
markets 1
still 1
fairly 1
busy 1
we 1
easily 1
trade 1
six 1
of 1
the 1
fish 1
for 1
good 1
bread 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
for 1
salt 1
greasy 1
sae 1
the 1
bony 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
sells 1
bowls 1
of 1
hot 1
soup 1
from 1
a 1
large 1
kettle 1
takes 1
half 1
the 1
greens 1
off 1
our 1
hands 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
chunks 1
of 1
paraffin 1
we 1
might 1
do 1
a 1
tad 1
better 1
elsewhere 1
but 1
we 1
make 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
keep 1
on 1
good 1
terms 1
with 1
greasy 1
sae 1
shes 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
can 1
consistently 1
be 1
counted 1
on 1
to 1
buy 1
wild 1
dog 1
we 1
dont 1
hunt 1
them 1
on 1
purpose 1
but 1
if 1
youre 1
attacked 1
and 1
you 1
take 1
out 1
a 1
dog 1
or 1
two 1
well 1
meat 1
is 1
meat 1
once 1
its 1
in 1
the 1
soup 1
ill 1
call 1
it 1
beef 1
greasy 1
sae 1
says 1
with 1
a 1
wink 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
their 1
nose 1
at 1
a 1
good 1
leg 1
of 1
wild 1
dog 1
but 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
who 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
hob 1
can 1
afford 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
choosier 1
when 1
we 1
finish 1
our 1
business 1
at 1
the 1
market 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
mayors 1
house 1
to 1
sell 1
half 1
the 1
strawberries 1
knowing 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
particular 1
fondness 1
for 1
them 1
and 1

shes 1
in 1
my 1
year 1
at 1
school 1
being 1
the 1
mayors 1
daughter 1
youd 1
expect 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
snob 1
but 1
shes 1
all 1
right 1
she 1
just 1
keeps 1
to 1
herself 1
like 1
me 1
since 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
really 1
has 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
friends 1
we 1
seem 1
to 1
end 1
up 1
together 1
a 1
lot 1
at 1
school 1
eating 1
lunch 1
sitting 1
next 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
at 1
assemblies 1
partnering 1
for 1
sports 1
activities 1
we 1
rarely 1
talk 1
which 1
suits 1
us 1
both 1

fine 1
today 1

drab 1
school 1

door 1

we 1
walk 1
toward 1
the 1
seam 1
in 1
silence 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
that 1
gale 1
took 1
a 1
dig 1
at 1
madge 1
but 1
hes 1
right 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
reaping 1
system 1
is 1
unfair 1
with 1
the 1
poor 1
getting 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
you 1
become 1
eligible 1
for 1
the 1
reaping 1
the 1
day 1
you 1
turn 1
twelve 1
that 1
year 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
entered 1
once 1
at 1
thirteen 1
twice 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
until 1
you 1
reach 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
eighteen 1
the 1
final 1
year 1
of 1
eligibility 1
when 1
your 1
name 1
goes 1
into 1
the 1
pool 1
seven 1
times 1
thats 1
true 1
for 1
every 1
citizen 1
in 1
all 1
twelve 1
districts 1
in 1
the 1
entire 1
country 1
of 1
panem 1
but 1
heres 1
the 1
catch 1
say 1
you 1
are 1
poor 1
and 1
starving 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
you 1
can 1
opt 1
to 1
add 1
your 1
name 1
more 1
times 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
tesserae 1
each 1
tessera 1
is 1
worth 1
a 1
meager 1
years 1
supply 1
of 1
grain 1
and 1
oil 1
for 1
one 1
person 1
you 1
may 1
do 1
this 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
your 1
family 1
members 1
as 1
well 1
so 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
twelve 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
name 1
entered 1
four 1
times 1
once 1
because 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
and 1
three 1
times 1
for 1
tesserae 1
for 1
grain 1
and 1
oil 1
for 1
myself 1
prim 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
in 1
fact 1
every 1
year 1
i 1
have 1
needed 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
and 1
the 1
entries 1
are 1
cumulative 1
so 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
sixteen 1
my 1
name 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
reaping 1
twenty 1
times 1
gale 1
who 1
is 1
eighteen 1
and 1
has 1
been 1
either 1
helping 1
or 1
singlehandedly 1
feeding 1
a 1
family 1
of 1
five 1
for 1
seven 1
years 1
will 1
have 1
his 1
name 1
in 1
fortytwo 1
times 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
why 1
someone 1
like 1
madge 1
who 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
at 1
risk 1
of 1
needing 1
a 1
tessera 1
can 1
set 1
him 1
off 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
her 1
name 1
being 1
drawn 1
is 1
very 1
slim 1
compared 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
not 1
impossible 1
but 1
slim 1
and 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
rules 1
were 1
set 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
capitol 1
not 1
the 1
districts 1
certainly 1
not 1
madges 1
family 1
its 1
hard 1
not 1
to 1
resent 1
those 1
who 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
sign 1
up 1
for 1
tesserae 1
gale 1
knows 1
his 1
anger 1
at 1
madge 1
is 1
misdirected 1
on 1
other 1
days 1
deep 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
ive 1
listened 1
to 1
him 1
rant 1
about 1
how 1
the 1
tesserae 1
are 1
just 1
another 1
tool 1
to 1
cause 1
misery 1
in 1
our 1
district 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
plant 1
hatred 1
between 1
the 1
starving 1
workers 1
of 1
the 1
seam 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
can 1
generally 1
count 1
on 1
supper 1
and 1
thereby 1
ensure 1
we 1
will 1
never 1
trust 1
one 1
another 1
its 1
to 1
the 1
capitols 1
advantage 1
to 1
have 1
us 1
divided 1
among 1
ourselves 1
he 1
might 1
say 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
ears 1
to 1
hear 1
but 1
mine 1
if 1
it 1
wasnt 1
reaping 1
day 1
if 1
a 1
girl 1
with 1
a 1
gold 1
pin 1
and 1
no 1
tesserae 1
had 1
not 1
made 1
what 1
im 1
sure 1
she 1
thought 1
was 1
a 1
harmless 1
comment 1
as 1
we 1
walk 1
i 1
glance 1
over 1
at 1
gales 1
face 1
still 1
smoldering 1
underneath 1
his 1
stony 1
expression 1
his 1
rages 1
seem 1
pointless 1
to 1
me 1
although 1
i 1
never 1
say 1
so 1
its 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
agree 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
do 1
but 1
what 1
good 1
is 1
yelling 1
about 1
the 1
capitol 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
it 1
doesnt 1
change 1
anything 1
it 1
doesnt 1
make 1
things 1
fair 1
it 1
doesnt 1
fill 1
our 1
stomachs 1
in 1
fact 1
it 1
scares 1
off 1
the 1
nearby 1
game 1
i 1
let 1
him 1
yell 1
though 1
better 1
he 1
does 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
district 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
divide 1
our 1
spoils 1
leaving 1
two 1
fish 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
loaves 1
of 1
good 1
bread 1
greens 1
a 1
quart 1
of 1
strawberries 1
salt 1
paraffin 1
and 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
money 1
for 1
each 1

in 1
the 1
square 1
i 1
say 1

says 1
flatly 1
at 1
home 1

find 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
are 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
my 1
mother 1
wears 1
a 1
fine 1
dress 1
from 1
her 1
apothecary 1
days 1
prim 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
first 1
reaping 1
outfit 1
a 1
skirt 1
and 1
ruffled 1
blouse 1
its 1
a 1
bit 1
big 1
on 1
her 1
but 1
my 1
mother 1
has 1
made 1
it 1
stay 1
with 1
pins 1
even 1
so 1
shes 1
having 1
trouble 1
keeping 1
the 1
blouse 1
tucked 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
a 1
tub 1
of 1
warm 1
water 1
waits 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
scrub 1
off 1
the 1
dirt 1
and 1
sweat 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
even 1
wash 1
my 1
hair 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
my 1
mother 1
has 1
laid 1
out 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
lovely 1
dresses 1
for 1
me 1
a 1
soft 1
blue 1
thing 1
with 1
matching 1
shoes 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
i 1
ask 1
im 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
past 1
rejecting 1
offers 1
of 1
help 1
from 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
angry 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
allow 1
her 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
something 1
special 1
her 1
clothes 1
from 1
her 1
past 1
are 1
very 1
precious 1
to 1
her 1
of 1
course 1
lets 1
put 1
your 1
hair 1
up 1
too 1
she 1
says 1
i 1
let 1
her 1
toweldry 1
it 1
and 1
braid 1
it 1
up 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
recognize 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
cracked 1
mirror 1
that 1
leans 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
you 1
look 1
beautiful 1
says 1
prim 1
in 1
a 1
hushed 1
voice 1
and 1
nothing 1
like 1
myself 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
hug 1
her 1
because 1
i 1
know 1
these 1
next 1
few 1
hours 1
will 1
be 1
terrible 1
for 1
her 1
her 1
first 1
reaping 1
shes 1
about 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
since 1
shes 1
only 1
entered 1
once 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
let 1
her 1
take 1
out 1
any 1
tesserae 1
but 1
shes 1
worried 1
about 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
unthinkable 1
might 1
happen 1
i 1
protect 1
prim 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
i 1
can 1
but 1
im 1
powerless 1
against 1
the 1
reaping 1
the 1
anguish 1
i 1
always 1
feel 1
when 1
shes 1
in 1
pain 1
wells 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
chest 1
and 1
threatens 1
to 1
register 1
on 1
my 1
ace 1
i 1
notice 1
her 1
blouse 1
has 1
pulled 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
skirt 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
force 1
myself 1
to 1
stay 1
calm 1
tuck 1
your 1
tail 1
in 1
little 1
duck 1
i 1
say 1
smoothing 1
the 1
blouse 1
back 1
in 1
place 1
prim 1
giggles 1
and 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
small 1
quack 1
quack 1
yourself 1
i 1
say 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
laugh 1
the 1
kind 1
only 1
prim 1
can 1
draw 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
come 1
on 1
lets 1
eat 1
i 1
say 1
and 1
plant 1
a 1
quick 1
kiss 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
the 1
fish 1
and 1
greens 1
are 1
already 1
cooking 1
in 1
a 1
stew 1
but 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
for 1
supper 1
we 1
decide 1
to 1
save 1
the 1
strawberries 1
and 1
bakery 1
bread 1
for 1
this 1
evenings 1
meal 1
to 1

drink 1
milk 1
from 1
prims 1
goat 1
lady 1
and 1
eat 1
the 1
rough 1
bread 1
made 1
from 1
the 1
tessera 1
grain 1
although 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
much 1
appetite 1
anyway 1
at 1
one 1
oclock 1
we 1
head 1

this 1
evening 1
officials 1
will 1
come 1
around 1
and 1
check 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
case 1
if 1
not 1
youll 1
be 1
imprisoned 1
its 1
too 1
bad 1
really 1
that 1
they 1
hold 1
the 1
reaping 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
few 1
places 1
in 1
district 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
pleasant 1
the 1
squares 1
surrounded 1
by 1
shops 1
and 1
on 1
public 1
market 1
days 1
especially 1
if 1
theres 1
good 1
weather 1
it 1

a 1
holiday 1

to 1

today 1
despite 1
the 1
bright 1
banners 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
buildings 1
theres 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
grimness 1
the 1
camera 1
crews 1
perched 1
like 1
buzzards 1
on 1
rooftops 1
only 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
people 1
file 1
in 1
silently 1
and 1
sign 1
in 1
the 1
reaping 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
opportunity 1
for 1
the 1
capitol 1
to 1
keep 1
tabs 1
on 1
the 1
population 1
as 1
well 1
twelve 1
through 1

herded 1
into 1
roped 1
areas 1
marked 1

they 1
will 1
break 1
down 1
and 1
weep 1
most 1
refuse 1
dealing 1
with 1
the 1
racketeers 1
but 1
carefully 1
carefully 1
these 1
same 1
people 1
tend 1
to 1
be 1
informers 1

who 1
hasnt 1
broken 1
the 1

i 1
could 1
be 1
shot 1
on 1
a 1

but 1
the 1
appetites 1
of 1
those 1
in 1

protect 1
me 1
not 1
everyone 1
can 1
claim 1
the 1
same 1
anyway 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
agree 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
choose 1
between 1
dying 1
of 1
hunger 1
and 1
a 1
bullet 1
in 1
the 1
head 1
the 1
bullet 1
would 1
be 1
much 1
quicker 1
the 1
space 1
gets 1
tighter 1
more 1
claustrophobic 1
as 1
people 1
arrive 1
the 1
squares 1
quite 1
large 1
but 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1

of 1
about 1
eight 1
thousand 1
latecomers 1
are 1
directed 1
to 1
the 1

they 1
can 1
watch 1

of 1
sixteens 1
from 1

we 1
all 1
exchange 1
terse 1
nods 1
then 1
focus 1
our 1
attention 1
on 1
the 1
temporary 1
stage 1
that 1
is 1
set 1
up 1
before 1

with 1
concern 1
at 1
the 1

just 1
as 1

for 1

panem 1
a 1
shining 1
capitol 1
ringed 1
by 1
thirteen 1
districts 1
which 1
brought 1
peace 1
and 1
prosperity 1
to 1
its 1
citizens 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
dark 1
days 1

as 1
our 1
yearly 1

that 1

days 1
must 1
never 1
be 1
repeated 1

gave 1
us 1
the 1

the 1
rules 1
of 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
are 1
simple 1
in 1
punishment 1
for 1
the 1
uprising 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
twelve 1

anything 1

districts 1
forcing 1
them 1
to 1
kill 1
one 1
another 1
while 1
we 1
watch 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
capitols 1
way 1
of 1
reminding 1
us 1
how 1
totally 1
we 1
are 1
at 1
their 1
mercy 1
how 1
little 1
chance 1
we 1
would 1
stand 1
of 1
surviving 1
another 1
rebellion 1
whatever 1
words 1
they 1
use 1
the 1
real 1
message 1
is 1
clear 1
look 1
how 1
we 1
take 1
your 1
children 1
and 1
sacrifice 1
them 1
and 1
theres 1
nothing 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
if 1
you 1
lift 1
a 1
finger 1
we 1
will 1
destroy 1
every 1
last 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
did 1
in 1
district 1
thirteen 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
humiliating 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
torturous 1
the 1
capitol 1
requires 1
us 1
to 1
treat 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
as 1
a 1
festivity 1
a 1
sporting 1
event 1
pitting 1
every 1
district 1
against 1
the 1
others 1
the 1
last 1
tribute 1
alive 1
receives 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
ease 1
back 1
home 1
and 1
their 1
district 1
will 1
be 1
showered 1
with 1
prizes 1
largely 1
consisting 1
of 1
food 1
all 1
year 1
the 1
capitol 1
will 1
show 1
the 1
winning 1
district 1
gifts 1
of 1
grain 1
and 1
oil 1
and 1
even 1
delicacies 1
like 1
sugar 1
while 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
battle 1
starvation 1
it 1
is 1
both 1
a 1
time 1
for 1
repentance 1
and 1
a 1
time 1
for 1
thanks 1
intones 1
the 1
mayor 1
then 1
he 1
reads 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
past 1
district 1
victors 1
in 1
seventyfour 1
years 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
exactly 1
two 1
only 1
one 1
is 1
still 1
alive 1
haymitch 1
abernathy 1
a 1
paunchy 1
middleaged 1
man 1
who 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
appears 1
hollering 1
something 1
unintelligible 1
staggers 1
onto 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
falls 1
into 1
the 1
third 1
chair 1
hes 1
drunk 1
very 1
the 1
crowd 1
responds 1
with 1
its 1
token 1
applause 1
but 1
hes 1
confused 1
and 1
tries 1
to 1
give 1
effie 1
trinket 1
a 1
big 1
hug 1
which 1
she 1
barely 1
manages 1
to 1
fend 1
off 1
the 1
mayor 1
looks 1
distressed 1
since 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
is 1
being 1
televised 1
right 1
now 1
district 1
is 1
the 1
laughingstock 1
of 1
panem 1
and 1
he 1
knows 1
it 1
he 1
quickly 1
tries 1
to 1
pull 1
the 1
attention 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
reaping 1
by 1
introducing 1
effie 1
trinket 1
bright 1
and 1
bubbly 1
as 1
ever 1
effie 1
trinket 1
trots 1
to 1
the 1
podium 1
and 1
gives 1
her 1
signature 1
happy 1
hunger 1
games 1
and 1
may 1
the 1
odds 1
be 1
ever 1
in 1
your 1
favor 1
her 1
pink 1
hair 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
wig 1
because 1
her 1
curls 1
have 1
shifted 1
slightly 1
offcenter 1
since 1
her 1
encounter 1
with 1
haymitch 1
she 1
goes 1
on 1
a 1
bit 1
about 1
what 1
an 1
honor 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
although 1
everyone 1
knows 1
shes 1
just 1
aching 1
to 1
get 1
bumped 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
better 1
district 1
where 1
they 1
have 1
proper 1
victors 1
not 1
drunks 1
who 1
molest 1
you 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
entire 1
nation 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
i 1
spot 1
gale 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
ghost 1
of 1
a 1
smile 1
as 1
reapings 1
go 1
this 1
one 1
at 1
least 1
has 1
a 1
slight 1
entertainment 1
factor 1
but 1
suddenly 1
i 1
am 1
thinking 1
of 1
gale 1
and 1
his 1
fortytwo 1
names 1
in 1
that 1
big 1
glass 1
ball 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
odds 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
his 1
favor 1
not 1
compared 1
to 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
and 1
maybe 1
hes 1
thinking 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
about 1
me 1
because 1
his 1
face 1
darkens 1
and 1
he 1
turns 1
away 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
still 1
thousands 1
of 1
slips 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
whisper 1
to 1
him 1
its 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
drawing 1
effie 1
trinket 1
says 1
as 1
she 1
always 1
does 1
ladies 1
first 1
and 1
crosses 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
ball 1
with 1
the 1
girls 1
names 1
she 1
reaches 1
in 1
digs 1
her 1
hand 1
deep 1
into 1
the 1
ball 1
and 1
pulls 1
out 1
a 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
the 1
crowd 1
draws 1
in 1
a 1
collective 1
breath 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
a 1
pin 1
drop 1
and 1
im 1
feeling 1
nauseous 1
and 1
so 1
desperately 1
hoping 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
me 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
me 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
me 1
effie 1
trinket 1
crosses 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
podium 1
smoothes 1
the 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
reads 1
out 1
the 1
name 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
voice 1
and 1
its 1
not 1
me 1
its 1
primrose 1
everdeen 1
one 1
time 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
blind 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
waiting 1
motionless 1
for 1
game 1
to 1
wander 1
by 1
i 1
dozed 1
off 1
and 1
fell 1
ten 1
feet 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
landing 1
on 1
my 1
back 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
impact 1
had 1
knocked 1
every 1
wisp 1
of 1
air 1
from 1
my 1
lungs 1
and 1
i 1
lay 1
there 1
struggling 1
to 1
inhale 1
to 1
exhale 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
thats 1
how 1
i 1
feel 1
now 1
trying 1
to 1
remember 1
how 1
to 1
breathe 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
totally 1
stunned 1
as 1
the 1
name 1
bounces 1
around 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
my 1
skull 1
someone 1
is 1
gripping 1
my 1
arm 1
a 1
boy 1
from 1
the 1
seam 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
maybe 1
i 1
started 1
to 1
fall 1
and 1
he 1
caught 1
me 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
mistake 1
this 1
cant 1
be 1
happening 1
prim 1
was 1
one 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
in 1
thousands 1
her 1
chances 1
of 1
being 1
chosen 1
so 1
remote 1
that 1
id 1
not 1
even 1
bothered 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
her 1
hadnt 1
i 1
done 1
everything 1
taken 1
the 1
tesserae 1

to 1
let 1
her 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
one 1
slip 1
one 1
slip 1
in 1
thousands 1
the 1
odds 1
had 1
been 1
entirely 1
in 1
her 1
favor 1
but 1
it 1
hadnt 1
mattered 1
somewhere 1
far 1
away 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
crowd 1
murmuring 1
unhappily 1
as 1
they 1
always 1
do 1
when 1
a 1
twelveyearold 1
gets 1
chosen 1
because 1
no 1
one 1
thinks 1
this 1
is 1
fair 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
see 1
her 1
the 1
blood 1
drained 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
hands 1
clenched 1
in 1
fists 1
at 1
her 1
sides 1
walking 1
with 1
stiff 1
small 1
steps 1
up 1
toward 1
the 1
stage 1
passing 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
back 1
of 1

blouse 1
has 1
become 1
untucked 1
and 1
hangs 1
out 1
over 1
her 1
skirt 1
its 1
this 1
detail 1
the 1
untucked 1
blouse 1
forming 1
a 1
ducktail 1
that 1
brings 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
myself 1
prim 1
the 1
strangled 1
cry 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
throat 1
and 1
my 1
muscles 1
begin 1
to 1
move 1
again 1

a 1
straight 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
i 1
reach 1
her 1
just 1
as 1
she 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
mount 1
the 1
steps 1
with 1
one 1
sweep 1
of 1
my 1
arm 1
i 1
push 1
her 1
behind 1
me 1
i 1
volunteer 1
i 1
gasp 1
i 1
volunteer 1
as 1
tribute 1
theres 1
some 1
confusion 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
district 1
hasnt 1
had 1
a 1
volunteer 1
in 1
decades 1
and 1
the 1
protocol 1
has 1
become 1
rusty 1
the 1
rule 1
is 1
that 1
once 1
a 1
tributes 1
name 1
has 1
been 1
pulled 1
from 1
the 1
ball 1
another 1
eligible 1
boy 1
if 1
a 1
boys 1
name 1
has 1
been 1
read 1
or 1
girl 1
if 1
a 1
girls 1
name 1
has 1
been 1
read 1
can 1
step 1
forward 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
or 1
her 1
place 1
in 1
some 1
districts 1
in 1
which 1
winning 1
the 1
reaping 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
honor 1
people 1
are 1
eager 1
to 1
risk 1
their 1
lives 1
the 1
volunteering 1
is 1
complicated 1
but 1
in 1
district 1
where 1
the 1
word 1
tribute 1
is 1
pretty 1
much 1
synonymous 1
with 1
the 1
word 1
corpse 1
volunteers 1
are 1
all 1
but 1
extinct 1
lovely 1
says 1
effie 1
trinket 1
but 1
i 1
believe 1
theres 1
a 1
small 1
matter 1
of 1
introducing 1
the 1
reaping 1
winner 1
and 1
then 1
asking 1
for 1
volunteers 1
and 1
if 1
one 1
does 1
come 1
forth 1
then 1
we 1
um 1
she 1
trails 1
off 1
unsure 1
herself 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
says 1
the 1
mayor 1
hes 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
pained 1
expression 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
he 1
doesnt 1
know 1
me 1
really 1
but 1
theres 1
a 1
faint 1
recognition 1
there 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
brings 1
the 1
strawberries 1
the 1
girl 1
his 1
daughter 1
might 1
have 1
spoken 1
of 1
on 1
occasion 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
stood 1
huddled 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
as 1
he 1
presented 1
her 1
the 1
oldest 1
child 1
with 1
a 1
medal 1
of 1
valor 1
a 1
medal 1
for 1
her 1
father 1
vaporized 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1

he 1

hysterically 1
behind 1

says 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1

steady 1
and 1
then 1

prim 1

toward 1

mother 1

little 1
action 1

on 1
in 1

sister 1

all 1
the 1
glory 1
do 1
we 1
come 1
on 1
everybody 1
lets 1
give 1
a 1
big 1
round 1
of 1
applause 1
to 1
our 1
newest 1
tribute 1
trills 1
effie 1
trinket 1
to 1
the 1
everlasting 1
credit 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
district 1
not 1
one 1
person 1
claps 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
ones 1
holding 1
betting 1
slips 1
the 1
ones 1
who 1
are 1
usually 1
beyond 1
caring 1
possibly 1
because 1
they 1
know 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
hob 1
or 1
knew 1
my 1
father 1
or 1
have 1
encountered 1
prim 1
who 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
help 1
loving 1
so 1
instead 1
of 1
acknowledging 1
applause 1
i 1
stand 1
there 1
unmoving 1
while 1
they 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
boldest 1
form 1
of 1
dissent 1
they 1
can 1
manage 1
silence 1
which 1
says 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
agree 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
condone 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
is 1
wrong 1
then 1
something 1
unexpected 1
happens 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
dont 1
expect 1
it 1
because 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
of 1
district 1
as 1
a 1
place 1
that 1
cares 1
about 1
me 1
but 1
a 1
shift 1
has 1
occurred 1
since 1
i 1
stepped 1
up 1
to 1
take 1
prims 1
place 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
seems 1
i 1
have 1
become 1
someone 1
precious 1
at 1
first 1
one 1
then 1
another 1
then 1
almost 1
every 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
touches 1
the 1
three 1
middle 1
fingers 1
of 1
their 1
left 1
hand 1
to 1
their 1
lips 1
and 1
holds 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
rarely 1
used 1
gesture 1
of 1
our 1
district 1
occasionally 1
seen 1
at 1
funerals 1
it 1
means 1
thanks 1
it 1
means 1
admiration 1
it 1
means 1
goodbye 1
to 1
someone 1
you 1
love 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
truly 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
crying 1
but 1
fortunately 1
haymitch 1
chooses 1
this 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
staggering 1
across 1
the 1
stage 1
to 1
congratulate 1
me 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
one 1
he 1
hollers 1
throwing 1
an 1
arm 1
around 1
my 1
shoulders 1
hes 1
surprisingly 1
strong 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
wreck 1
i 1
like 1
her 1
his 1
breath 1
reeks 1
of 1
liquor 1
and 1
its 1
been 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
since 1
hes 1
bathed 1
lots 1
of 1
he 1
cant 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
spunk 1
he 1
says 1
triumphantly 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
he 1
releases 1
me 1
and 1
starts 1
for 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
stage 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
he 1
shouts 1
pointing 1
directly 1
into 1
a 1
camera 1
is 1
he 1
addressing 1
the 1
audience 1
or 1
is 1
he 1
so 1
drunk 1
he 1
might 1
actually 1
be 1
taunting 1
the 1
capitol 1
ill 1
never 1
know 1
because 1
just 1
as 1
hes 1
opening 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
continue 1
haymitch 1
plummets 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
knocks 1
himself 1
unconscious 1
hes 1
disgusting 1
but 1
im 1
grateful 1
with 1
every 1
camera 1
gleefully 1
trained 1
on 1
him 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
enough 1
time 1
to 1
release 1
the 1
small 1
choked 1
sound 1
in 1
my 1
throat 1
and 1
compose 1
myself 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
hands 1
behind 1
my 1
back 1
and 1
stare 1
into 1
the 1
distance 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
hills 1
i 1
climbed 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
gale 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
yearn 1
for 1
something 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
us 1
leaving 1
the 1
district 1
making 1
our 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
not 1
running 1
off 1
because 1
who 1
else 1
would 1
have 1
volunteered 1
for 1
prim 1
haymitch 1
is 1
whisked 1
away 1
on 1
a 1
stretcher 1
and 1
effie 1
trinket 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
ball 1
rolling 1
again 1
what 1
an 1
exciting 1
day 1
she 1
warbles 1
as 1
she 1
attempts 1
to 1
straighten 1
her 1
wig 1
which 1
has 1
listed 1
severely 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
but 1
more 1
excitement 1
to 1
come 1
its 1
time 1
to 1
choose 1
our 1
boy 1
tribute 1
clearly 1
hoping 1
to 1
contain 1
her 1
tenuous 1
hair 1
situation 1
she 1
plants 1
one 1
hand 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
as 1
she 1
crosses 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
that 1
contains 1
the 1
boys 1
names 1
and 1
grabs 1
the 1
first 1
slip 1
she 1
encounters 1
she 1
zips 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
podium 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
wish 1
for 1
gales 1
safety 1
when 1
shes 1
reading 1
the 1
name 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
oh 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
not 1
him 1
because 1
i 1
recognize 1
this 1
name 1
although 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
spoken 1
directly 1
to 1
its 1
owner 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
no 1
the 1
odds 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
my 1
favor 1
today 1
i 1
watch 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
makes 1
his 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
stage 1
medium 1
height 1
stocky 1
build 1
ashy 1
blond 1
hair 1
that 1
falls 1
in 1
waves 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
the 1
shock 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
is 1
registering 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
his 1
struggle 1
to 1
remain 1
emotionless 1
but 1
his 1
blue 1
eyes 1
show 1
the 1
alarm 1
ive 1
seen 1
so 1
often 1
in 1
prey 1
yet 1
he 1
climbs 1
steadily 1
onto 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
takes 1
his 1
place 1
effie 1
trinket 1
asks 1
for 1
volunteers 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
steps 1
forward 1
he 1
has 1
two 1
older 1
brothers 1
i 1
know 1
ive 1
seen 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
bakery 1
but 1
one 1
is 1
probably 1
too 1
old 1
now 1
to 1
volunteer 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
wont 1
this 1
is 1
standard 1
family 1
devotion 1
only 1
goes 1
so 1
far 1
for 1
most 1
people 1
on 1
reaping 1
day 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
was 1
the 1
radical 1
thing 1
the 1
mayor 1
begins 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
long 1
dull 1
treaty 1
of 1
treason 1
as 1
he 1
does 1
every 1
year 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
its 1
required 1
but 1
im 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
a 1
word 1
why 1
him 1
i 1
think 1
then 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
convince 1
myself 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
not 1
friends 1
not 1
even 1
neighbors 1
we 1
dont 1
speak 1
our 1
only 1
real 1
interaction 1
happened 1
years 1
ago 1
hes 1
probably 1
forgotten 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
havent 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
never 1
will 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
the 1
worst 1
time 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
been 1
killed 1
in 1
the 1
mine 1
accident 1
three 1
months 1
earlier 1
in 1
the 1
bitterest 1
january 1
anyone 1
could 1
remember 1
the 1
numbness 1
of 1
his 1
loss 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
pain 1
would 1
hit 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
nowhere 1
doubling 1
me 1
over 1
racking 1
my 1
body 1
with 1
sobs 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
i 1
would 1
cry 1
out 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
where 1
have 1
you 1
gone 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
never 1
any 1
answer 1
the 1
district 1
had 1
given 1
us 1
a 1
small 1
amount 1
of 1
money 1
as 1
compensation 1
for 1
his 1
death 1
enough 1
to 1
cover 1
one 1
month 1
of 1
grieving 1
at 1
which 1
time 1
my 1
mother 1
would 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
job 1
only 1
she 1
didnt 1
she 1
didnt 1
do 1
anything 1
but 1
sit 1
propped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
or 1
more 1
often 1
huddled 1
under 1
the 1
blankets 1
on 1
her 1
bed 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
some 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
shed 1
stir 1
get 1
up 1
as 1
if 1
moved 1
by 1
some 1
urgent 1
purpose 1
only 1
to 1
then 1
collapse 1
back 1
into 1
stillness 1
no 1
amount 1
of 1
pleading 1
from 1
prim 1
seemed 1
to 1
affect 1
her 1
i 1
was 1
terrified 1
i 1
suppose 1
now 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
locked 1
in 1
some 1
dark 1
world 1
of 1
sadness 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
all 1
i 1
knew 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
lost 1
not 1
only 1
a 1
father 1
but 1
a 1
mother 1
as 1
well 1
at 1
eleven 1
years 1
old 1
with 1
prim 1
just 1
seven 1
i 1
took 1
over 1
as 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
choice 1
i 1
bought 1
our 1
food 1
at 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
cooked 1
it 1
as 1
best 1
i 1
could 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
prim 1
and 1
myself 1
looking 1
presentable 1
because 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
become 1
known 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
care 1
for 1
us 1
the 1
district 1
would 1
have 1
taken 1
us 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
placed 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
community 1
home 1
id 1
grown 1
up 1
seeing 1
those 1
home 1
kids 1
at 1
school 1
the 1
sadness 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
angry 1
hands 1
on 1
their 1
faces 1
the 1
hopelessness 1
that 1
curled 1
their 1
shoulders 1
forward 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
let 1
that 1
happen 1
to 1
prim 1
sweet 1
tiny 1
prim 1
who 1
cried 1
when 1
i 1
cried 1
before 1
she 1
even 1
knew 1
the 1
reason 1
who 1
brushed 1
and 1
plaited 1
my 1
mothers 1
hair 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
for 1
school 1
who 1
still 1
polished 1
my 1
fathers 1
shaving 1
mirror 1
each 1
night 1
because 1
hed 1
hated 1
the 1
layer 1
of 1
coal 1
dust 1
that 1
settled 1
on 1
everything 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
the 1
community 1
home 1
would 1
crush 1
her 1
like 1
a 1
bug 1
so 1
i 1
kept 1
our 1
predicament 1
a 1
secret 1
but 1
the 1
money 1
ran 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
slowly 1
starving 1
to 1
death 1
theres 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
i 1
kept 1
telling 1
myself 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
hold 1
out 1
until 1
may 1
just 1
may 1
th 1
i 1
would 1
turn 1
twelve 1
and 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
sign 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
tesserae 1
and 1
get 1
that 1
precious 1
grain 1
and 1
oil 1
to 1
feed 1
us 1
only 1
there 1
were 1
still 1
several 1
weeks 1
to 1
go 1
we 1
could 1
well 1
be 1
dead 1
by 1
then 1
starvations 1
not 1
an 1
uncommon 1
fate 1
in 1
district 1
who 1
hasnt 1
seen 1
the 1
victims 1
older 1
people 1
who 1
cant 1
work 1
children 1
from 1
a 1
family 1
with 1
too 1
many 1
to 1
feed 1
those 1
injured 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1
straggling 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
you 1
come 1
upon 1
them 1
sitting 1
motionless 1
against 1
a 1
wall 1
or 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
meadow 1
you 1
hear 1
the 1
wails 1
from 1
a 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
are 1
called 1
in 1
to 1
retrieve 1
the 1
body 1
starvation 1
is 1
never 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
death 1
officially 1
its 1
always 1
the 1
flu 1
or 1
exposure 1
or 1
pneumonia 1
but 1
that 1
fools 1
no 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
afternoon 1
of 1
my 1
encounter 1
with 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
falling 1
in 1
relentless 1
icy 1
sheets 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
town 1
trying 1
to 1
trade 1
some 1
threadbare 1
old 1
baby 1
clothes 1
of 1
prims 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
market 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
takers 1
although 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
hob 1
on 1
several 1
occasions 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
was 1
too 1
frightened 1
to 1
venture 1
into 1
that 1
rough 1
gritty 1
place 1
alone 1
the 1
rain 1
had 1
soaked 1
through 1
my 1
fathers 1
hunting 1
jacket 1
leaving 1
me 1
chilled 1
to 1
the 1
bone 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
wed 1
had 1
nothing 1
but 1
boiled 1
water 1
with 1
some 1
old 1
dried 1
mint 1
leaves 1
id 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
a 1
cupboard 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
market 1
closed 1
i 1
was 1
shaking 1
so 1
hard 1
i 1
dropped 1
my 1
bundle 1
of 1
baby 1
clothes 1
in 1
a 1
mud 1
puddle 1
i 1
didnt 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
for 1
fear 1
i 1
would 1
keel 1
over 1
and 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
regain 1
my 1
feet 1
besides 1
no 1
one 1
wanted 1
those 1
clothes 1
i 1
couldnt 1
go 1
home 1
because 1
at 1
home 1
was 1
my 1
mother 1
with 1
her 1
dead 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
little 1
sister 1
with 1
her 1
hollow 1
cheeks 1
and 1
cracked 1
lips 1
i 1
couldnt 1
walk 1
into 1
that 1
room 1
with 1
the 1
smoky 1
fire 1
from 1
the 1
damp 1
branches 1
i 1
had 1
scavenged 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
after 1
the 1
coal 1
had 1
run 1
out 1
my 1
bands 1
empty 1
of 1
any 1
hope 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
stumbling 1
along 1
a 1
muddy 1
lane 1
behind 1
the 1
shops 1
that 1
serve 1
the 1
wealthiest 1
townspeople 1
the 1
merchants 1
live 1
above 1
their 1
businesses 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
essentially 1
in 1
their 1
backyards 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
outlines 1
of 1
garden 1
beds 1
not 1
yet 1
planted 1
for 1
the 1
spring 1
a 1
goat 1
or 1
two 1
in 1
a 1
pen 1
one 1
sodden 1
dog 1
tied 1
to 1
a 1
post 1
hunched 1
defeated 1
in 1
the 1
muck 1
all 1
forms 1
of 1
stealing 1
are 1
forbidden 1
in 1
district 1
punishable 1
by 1
death 1
but 1
it 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
trash 1
bins 1
and 1
those 1
were 1
fair 1
game 1
perhaps 1
a 1
bone 1
at 1
the 1
butchers 1
or 1
rotted 1
vegetables 1
at 1
the 1
grocers 1
something 1
no 1
one 1
but 1
my 1
family 1
was 1
desperate 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
unfortunately 1
the 1
bins 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
emptied 1
when 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
bakers 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
fresh 1
bread 1
was 1
so 1
overwhelming 1
i 1
felt 1
dizzy 1
the 1
ovens 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
glow 1
spilled 1
out 1
the 1
open 1
kitchen 1
door 1
i 1
stood 1
mesmerized 1
by 1
the 1
heat 1
and 1
the 1
luscious 1
scent 1
until 1
the 1
rain 1
interfered 1
running 1
its 1
icy 1
fingers 1
down 1
my 1
back 1
forcing 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
life 1
i 1
lifted 1
the 1
lid 1
to 1
the 1
bakers 1
trash 1
bin 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
spotlessly 1
heartlessly 1
bare 1
suddenly 1
a 1
voice 1
was 1
screaming 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
bakers 1
wife 1
telling 1
me 1
to 1
move 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
i 1
want 1
her 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
and 1
how 1
sick 1
she 1
was 1
of 1
having 1
those 1
brats 1
from 1
the 1
seam 1
pawing 1
through 1
her 1
trash 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
ugly 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
defense 1
as 1
i 1
carefully 1
replaced 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
backed 1
away 1
i 1
noticed 1
him 1
a 1
boy 1
with 1
blond 1
hair 1
peering 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
his 1
mothers 1
back 1
id 1
seen 1
him 1
at 1
school 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
year 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
he 1
stuck 1
with 1
the 1
town 1
kids 1
so 1
how 1
would 1
i 1
his 1
mother 1
went 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
bakery 1
grumbling 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
watching 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
behind 1
the 1
pen 1
that 1
held 1
their 1
pig 1
and 1
leaned 1
against 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
apple 1
tree 1
the 1
realization 1
that 1
id 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
take 1
home 1
had 1
finally 1
sunk 1
in 1
my 1
knees 1
buckled 1
and 1
i 1
slid 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
trunk 1
to 1
its 1
roots 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
i 1
was 1
too 1
sick 1
and 1
weak 1
and 1
tired 1
oh 1
so 1
tired 1
let 1
them 1
call 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
and 1
take 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
community 1
home 1
i 1
thought 1
or 1
better 1
yet 1
let 1
me 1
die 1
right 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
rain 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
clatter 1
in 1
the 1
bakery 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
woman 1
screaming 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
blow 1
and 1
i 1
vaguely 1
wondered 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
feet 1
sloshed 1
toward 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
mud 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
its 1
her 1
shes 1
coming 1
to 1
drive 1
me 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
but 1
it 1
wasnt 1
her 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
he 1
carried 1
two 1
large 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
that 1
must 1
have 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
because 1
the 1
crusts 1
were 1
scorched 1
black 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
yelling 1
feed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
pig 1
you 1
stupid 1
creature 1
why 1
not 1
no 1
one 1
decent 1
will 1
buy 1
burned 1
bread 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
tear 1
off 1
chunks 1
from 1
the 1
burned 1
parts 1
and 1
toss 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
trough 1
and 1
the 1
front 1
bakery 1
bell 1
rung 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
disappeared 1
to 1
help 1
a 1
customer 1
the 1
boy 1
never 1
even 1
glanced 1
my 1
way 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
watching 1
him 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
bread 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
red 1
weal 1
that 1
stood 1
out 1
on 1
his 1
cheekbone 1
what 1
had 1
she 1
hit 1
him 1
with 1
my 1
parents 1
never 1
hit 1
us 1
i 1
couldnt 1
even 1
imagine 1
it 1
the 1
boy 1
took 1
one 1
look 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bakery 1
as 1
if 1
checking 1
that 1
the 1
coast 1
was 1
clear 1
then 1
his 1
attention 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
pig 1
he 1
threw 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
my 1
direction 1
the 1
second 1
quickly 1
followed 1
and 1
he 1
sloshed 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bakery 1
closing 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
tightly 1
behind 1
him 1
i 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
loaves 1
in 1
disbelief 1
they 1
were 1
fine 1
perfect 1
really 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
burned 1
areas 1
did 1
he 1
mean 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
because 1
there 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
before 1
anyone 1
could 1
witness 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
i 1
shoved 1
the 1
loaves 1
up 1
under 1
my 1
shirt 1
wrapped 1
the 1
hunting 1
jacket 1
tightly 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
away 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
bread 1
burned 1
into 1
my 1
skin 1
but 1
i 1
clutched 1
it 1
tighter 1
clinging 1
to 1
life 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
reached 1
home 1
the 1
loaves 1
had 1
cooled 1
somewhat 1
but 1
the 1
insides 1
were 1
still 1
warm 1
when 1
i 1
dropped 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
prims 1
hands 1
reached 1
to 1
tear 1
off 1
a 1
chunk 1
but 1
i 1
made 1
her 1
sit 1
forced 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
join 1
us 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
poured 1
warm 1
tea 1
i 1
scraped 1
off 1
the 1
black 1
stuff 1
and 1
sliced 1
the 1
bread 1
we 1
ate 1
an 1
entire 1
loaf 1
slice 1
by 1
slice 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
hearty 1
bread 1
filled 1
with 1
raisins 1
and 1
nuts 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
clothes 1
to 1
dry 1
at 1
the 1
fire 1
crawled 1
into 1
bed 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
dreamless 1
sleep 1
it 1
didnt 1
occur 1
to 1
me 1
until 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
might 1
have 1
burned 1
the 1
bread 1
on 1
purpose 1
might 1
have 1
dropped 1
the 1
loaves 1
into 1
the 1
flames 1
knowing 1
it 1
meant 1
being 1
punished 1
and 1
then 1
delivered 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
dismissed 1
this 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
accident 1
why 1
would 1
he 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
he 1
didnt 1
even 1
know 1
me 1
still 1
just 1
throwing 1
me 1
the 1
bread 1
was 1
an 1
enormous 1
kindness 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
surely 1
resulted 1
in 1
a 1
beating 1
if 1
discovered 1
couldnt 1
explain 1
his 1
actions 1
we 1
ate 1
slices 1
of 1
bread 1
for 1
breakfast 1
and 1
headed 1
to 1
school 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
if 1
spring 1
had 1
come 1
overnight 1
warm 1
sweet 1
air 1
fluffy 1
clouds 1
at 1
school 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
his 1
cheek 1
had 1
swelled 1
up 1
and 1
his 1
eye 1
had 1
blackened 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
didnt 1
acknowledge 1
me 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
collected 1
prim 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
home 1
that 1
afternoon 1
i 1
found 1
him 1
staring 1
at 1
me 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
school 1
yard 1
our 1
eyes 1
met 1
for 1
only 1
a 1
second 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
away 1
i 1
dropped 1
my 1
gaze 1
embarrassed 1
and 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
it 1
the 1
first 1
dandelion 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
a 1
bell 1
went 1
off 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
hours 1
spent 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
how 1
we 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
survive 1
to 1
this 1
day 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
shake 1
the 1
connection 1
between 1
this 1
boy 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
that 1
gave 1
me 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
dandelion 1
that 1
reminded 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
doomed 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
i 1
have 1
turned 1
in 1
the 1
school 1
hallway 1
and 1
caught 1
his 1
eyes 1
trained 1
on 1
me 1
only 1
to 1
quickly 1
flit 1
away 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
i 1
owe 1
him 1
something 1
and 1
i 1
hate 1
owing 1
people 1
maybe 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
thanked 1
him 1
at 1
some 1
point 1
id 1
be 1
feeling 1
less 1
conflicted 1
now 1
i 1
thought 1
about 1
it 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
but 1
the 1
opportunity 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
present 1
itself 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
never 1
will 1
because 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
thrown 1
into 1
an 1
arena 1
to 1
fight 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
exactly 1
how 1
am 1
i 1
supposed 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
a 1
thankyou 1
in 1
there 1
somehow 1
it 1
just 1
wont 1
seem 1
sincere 1
if 1
im 1
trying 1
to 1
slit 1
his 1
throat 1
the 1
mayor 1
finishes 1
the 1
dreary 1
treaty 1
of 1
treason 1
and 1
motions 1
for 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
shake 1
hands 1
his 1
are 1
as 1
solid 1
and 1
warm 1
as 1
those 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
peeta 1
looks 1
me 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
gives 1
my 1
hand 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
is 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
reassuring 1
squeeze 1
maybe 1
its 1
just 1
a 1
nervous 1
spasm 1
we 1
turn 1
back 1
to 1
face 1
the 1
crowd 1
as 1
the 1
anthem 1
of 1
panem 1
plays 1
oh 1
well 1
i 1
think 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
twentyfour 1
of 1
us 1
odds 1
are 1
someone 1
else 1
will 1
kill 1
him 1
before 1
i 1
do 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
odds 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
very 1
dependable 1
of 1
late 1
the 1
moment 1
the 1
anthem 1
ends 1
we 1
are 1
taken 1
into 1
custody 1
i 1
dont 1
mean 1
were 1
handcuffed 1
or 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
peacekeepers 1
marches 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
maybe 1
tributes 1
have 1
tried 1
to 1
escape 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
that 1
happen 1
though 1
once 1
inside 1
im 1
conducted 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
and 1
left 1
alone 1
its 1
the 1
richest 1
place 1
ive 1
ever 1
been 1
in 1
with 1
thick 1
deep 1
carpets 1
and 1
a 1
velvet 1
couch 1
and 1
chairs 1
i 1
know 1
velvet 1
because 1
my 1
mother 1
has 1
a 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
collar 1
made 1
of 1
the 1
stuff 1
when 1
i 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
running 1
my 1
fingers 1
over 1
the 1
fabric 1
repeatedly 1
it 1
helps 1
to 1
calm 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
prepare 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
hour 1
the 1
time 1
allotted 1
for 1
the 1
tributes 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
their 1
loved 1
ones 1
i 1
cannot 1
afford 1
to 1
get 1
upset 1
to 1
leave 1
this 1
room 1
with 1
puffy 1
eyes 1
and 1
a 1
red 1
nose 1
crying 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
option 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
more 1
cameras 1
at 1
the 1
train 1
station 1
my 1
sister 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
come 1
first 1
i 1
reach 1
out 1
to 1
primand 1
she 1
climbs 1
on 1
my 1
lap 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
my 1
neck 1
headon 1
my 1
shoulder 1
just 1
like 1
she 1
did 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
toddler 1
my 1
mother 1
sits 1
beside 1
me 1
and 1
wraps 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
us 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
we 1
say 1
nothing 1
then 1
i 1
start 1
telling 1
themall 1
the 1
things 1
they 1
must 1
remember 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
there 1
to 1
do 1
them 1
for 1
them 1
prim 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
take 1
any 1
tesserae 1
they 1
can 1
get 1
by 1
iftheyre 1
careful 1
on 1
selling 1
prims 1
goat 1
milk 1
and 1
cheese 1
and 1
the 1
small 1
apothecary 1
business 1
my 1
mother 1
now 1
runs 1
for 1
the 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
gale 1
will 1
get 1
her 1
the 1
herbs 1
she 1
doesnt 1
grow 1
herself 1
but 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
careful 1
to 1
describe 1
them 1
because 1
hes 1
not 1
as 1
familiar 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
hell 1
also 1
bring 1
them 1
game 1
he 1
and 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
pact 1
about 1
this 1
a 1
year 1
or 1
so 1
ago 1
and 1
will 1
probably 1
not 1
ask 1
for 1
compensation 1
but 1
they 1
should 1
thank 1
him 1
with 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
trade 1
like 1
milk 1
or 1
medicine 1
i 1
dont 1
bother 1
suggesting 1
prim 1
learn 1
to 1
hunt 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
teach 1
her 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
disastrous 1
the 1
woods 1
terrified 1
her 1
and 1
whenever 1
i 1
shot 1
something 1
shed 1
get 1
teary 1
and 1
talk 1
about 1
how 1
we 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
heal 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
home 1
soon 1
enough 1
but 1
she 1
makes 1
out 1
well 1
with 1
her 1
goat 1
so 1
i 1
concentrate 1
on 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
done 1
with 1
instructions 1
about 1
fuel 1
and 1
trading 1
and 1
staying 1
in 1
school 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
grip 1
her 1
arm 1
hard 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
are 1
you 1
listening 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
nods 1
alarmed 1
by 1
my 1
intensity 1
she 1
must 1
know 1
whats 1
coming 1
you 1
cant 1
leave 1
again 1
i 1
say 1
my 1
mothers 1
eyes 1
find 1
the 1
floor 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
wont 1
i 1
couldnt 1
help 1
what 1
well 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
help 1
it 1
this 1
time 1
you 1
cant 1
clock 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
prim 1
on 1
her 1
own 1
theres 1
no 1
me 1
now 1
to 1
keep 1
you 1
both 1
alive 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
what 1
happens 1
whatever 1
you 1
see 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
promise 1
me 1
youll 1
fight 1
through 1
it 1
my 1
voice 1
has 1
risen 1
to 1
a 1
shout 1
in 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
anger 1
all 1
the 1
fear 1
i 1
felt 1
at 1
her 1
abandonment 1
she 1
pulls 1
her 1
arm 1
from 1
my 1
grasp 1
moved 1
to 1
anger 1
herself 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
ill 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
treated 1
myself 1
if 1
id 1
had 1
the 1
medicine 1
i 1
have 1
now 1
that 1
part 1
about 1
her 1
being 1
ill 1
might 1
be 1
true 1
ive 1
seen 1
her 1
bring 1
back 1
people 1
suffering 1
from 1
immobilizing 1
sadness 1
since 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sickness 1
but 1
its 1
one 1
we 1
cant 1
afford 1
then 1
take 1
it 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
i 1
say 1
ill 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
katniss 1
says 1
prim 1
clasping 1
my 1
face 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
too 1
youre 1
so 1
fast 1
and 1
brave 1
maybe 1
you 1
can 1
win 1
i 1
cant 1
win 1
prim 1
must 1
know 1
that 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
the 1
competition 1
will 1
be 1
far 1
beyond 1
my 1
abilities 1
kids 1
from 1
wealthier 1
districts 1
where 1
winning 1
is 1
a 1
huge 1
honor 1
whove 1
been 1
trained 1
their 1
whole 1
lives 1
for 1
this 1

real 1
fun 1

fight 1

theyre 1
saying 1

back 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
peacekeeper 1
orders 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
closes 1
i 1
bury 1
my 1
head 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
velvet 1
pillows 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
can 1
block 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
someone 1
else 1
enters 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
up 1
im 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
its 1
the 1
baker 1
peeta 1
mellarks 1
father 1
i 1
cant 1
believe 1
hes 1
come 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
after 1
all 1
ill 1
be 1
trying 1
to 1
kill 1
his 1
son 1
soon 1
but 1
we 1
do 1
know 1
each 1
other 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
he 1
knows 1
prim 1
even 1
better 1
when 1
she 1
sells 1
her 1
goat 1
cheeses 1
at 1
the 1
hob 1
she 1
puts 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
aside 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
gives 1
her 1
a 1
generous 1
amount 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
return 1
we 1
always 1
wait 1
to 1
trade 1
with 1
him 1
when 1
his 1
witch 1
of 1
a 1
wife 1
isnt 1
around 1
because 1
hes 1
so 1
much 1
nicer 1
i 1
feel 1
certain 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
hit 1
his 1
son 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
did 1
over 1
the 1
burned 1
bread 1
but 1
why 1
has 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
the 1
baker 1
sits 1
awkwardly 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
plush 1
chairs 1
hes 1
a 1
big 1
broadshouldered 1
man 1
with 1
burn 1
scars 1
from 1
years 1
at 1
the 1
ovens 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
just 1
said 1
goodbye 1
to 1
his 1
son 1
he 1
pulls 1
a 1
white 1
paper 1
package 1
from 1
his 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
and 1
holds 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
open 1
it 1
and 1
find 1
cookies 1
these 1
are 1
a 1
luxury 1
we 1
can 1
never 1
afford 1
thank 1
you 1
i 1
say 1
the 1
bakers 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
talkative 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
times 1
and 1
today 1
he 1
has 1
no 1
words 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
had 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
bread 1
this 1
morning 1
my 1
friend 1
gale 1
gave 1
you 1
a 1
squirrel 1
for 1
it 1
he 1
nods 1
as 1
if 1
remembering 1
the 1
squirrel 1
not 1
your 1
best 1
trade 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
shrugs 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
couldnt 1
possibly 1
matter 1
then 1
i 1
cant 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
else 1
so 1
we 1
sit 1
in 1
silence 1
until 1
a 1
peacemaker 1
summons 1
him 1
he 1
rises 1
and 1
coughs 1
to 1
clear 1
his 1
throat 1
ill 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
make 1
sure 1
shes 1
eating 1
i 1
feel 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
pressure 1
in 1
my 1
chest 1
lighten 1
at 1
his 1
words 1
people 1
deal 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
genuinely 1
fond 1
of 1
prim 1
maybe 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
enough 1
fondness 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
alive 1
my 1
next 1
guest 1
is 1
also 1
unexpected 1
madge 1
walks 1
straight 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
weepy 1
or 1
evasive 1
instead 1
theres 1
an 1
urgency 1
about 1
her 1
tone 1
that 1
surprises 1
me 1
they 1
let 1
you 1
wear 1
one 1
thing 1
from 1
your 1
district 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
remind 1
you 1
of 1
home 1
will 1
you 1
wear 1
this 1
she 1
holds 1
out 1
the 1
circular 1
gold 1
pin 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
dress 1
earlier 1
i 1
hadnt 1
paid 1
much 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
before 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
its 1
a 1
small 1
bird 1
in 1
flight 1
your 1
pin 1
i 1
say 1
wearing 1
a 1
token 1
from 1
my 1
district 1
is 1
about 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
here 1
ill 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
your 1
dress 1
all 1
right 1
madge 1
doesnt 1
wait 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
she 1
just 1
leans 1
in 1
and 1
fixes 1
the 1
bird 1
to 1
my 1
dress 1
promise 1
youll 1
wear 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
katniss 1
she 1
asks 1
promise 1
yes 1
i 1
say 1
cookies 1
a 1
pin 1
im 1
getting 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
gifts 1
today 1
madge 1
gives 1
me 1
one 1
more 1
a 1
kiss 1
on 1
the 1
cheek 1
then 1
shes 1
gone 1
and 1
im 1
left 1
thinking 1
that 1
maybe 1
madge 1
really 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
friend 1
all 1
along 1
finally 1
gale 1
is 1
here 1
and 1
maybe 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
romantic 1
between 1
us 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
opens 1
his 1
arms 1
i 1
dont 1
hesitate 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
them 1
his 1
body 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
moves 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
wood 1
smoke 1
even 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
beating 1
i 1
know 1
from 1
quiet 1
moments 1
on 1
a 1
hunt 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
really 1
feel 1
it 1
lean 1
and 1
hardmuscled 1
against 1
my 1
own 1
listen 1
he 1
says 1
getting 1
a 1
knife 1
should 1
be 1
pretty 1
easy 1
but 1
youve 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
your 1
hands 1
on 1
a 1
bow 1
thats 1
your 1
best 1
chance 1
they 1
dont 1
always 1
have 1
bows 1
i 1
say 1
thinking 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
horrible 1
spiked 1
maces 1
that 1
the 1
tributes 1
had 1
to 1
bludgeon 1
one 1
another 1
to 1
death 1
with 1
then 1
make 1
one 1
says 1
gale 1
even 1
a 1
weak 1
bow 1
is 1
better 1
than 1
no 1
bow 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
tried 1
copying 1
my 1
fathers 1
bows 1
with 1
poor 1
results 1
its 1
not 1
that 1
easy 1
even 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
scrap 1
his 1
own 1
work 1
sometimes 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
know 1
if 1
therell 1
be 1
wood 1
i 1
say 1
another 1
year 1
they 1
tossed 1
everybody 1
into 1
a 1
landscape 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
boulders 1
and 1
sand 1
and 1
scruffy 1
bushes 1
i 1
particularly 1
hated 1
that 1
year 1
many 1
contestants 1
were 1
bitten 1
by 1
venomous 1
snakes 1
or 1
went 1
insane 1
from 1
thirst 1
theres 1
almost 1
always 1
some 1
wood 1
gale 1
says 1
since 1
that 1
year 1
half 1
of 1
them 1
died 1
of 1
cold 1
not 1
much 1
entertainment 1
in 1
that 1
its 1
true 1
we 1
spent 1
one 1
hunger 1
games 1
watching 1
the 1
players 1
freeze 1
to 1
death 1
at 1
night 1
you 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
them 1
because 1
they 1
were 1
just 1
huddled 1
in 1
balls 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
wood 1
for 1
fires 1
or 1
torches 1
or 1
anything 1
it 1
was 1
considered 1
very 1
anticlimactic 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
all 1
those 1
quiet 1
bloodless 1
deaths 1
since 1
then 1
theres 1
usually 1
been 1
wood 1
to 1
make 1
fires 1
yes 1
theres 1
usually 1
some 1
i 1
say 1
katniss 1
its 1
just 1
hunting 1
youre 1
the 1
best 1
hunter 1
i 1
know 1
says 1
gale 1
its 1
not 1
just 1
hunting 1
theyre 1
armed 1
they 1
think 1
i 1
say 1
so 1
do 1
you 1
and 1
youve 1
had 1
more 1
practice 1
real 1
practice 1
he 1
says 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
kill 1
not 1
people 1
i 1
say 1
how 1
different 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
really 1
says 1
gale 1
grimly 1
the 1
awful 1
thing 1
is 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
forget 1
theyre 1
people 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
different 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
are 1
back 1
too 1
soon 1
and 1
gale 1
asks 1
for 1
more 1
time 1
but 1
theyre 1
taking 1
him 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
start 1
to 1
panic 1
dont 1
let 1
them 1
starve 1
i 1
cry 1
out 1
clinging 1
to 1
his 1
hand 1
i 1
wont 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
wont 1
katniss 1
remember 1
i 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
they 1
yank 1
us 1
apart 1
and 1
slam 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
ill 1
never 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
remember 1
its 1
a 1
short 1
ride 1
from 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
to 1
the 1
train 1
station 1
ive 1
never 1
been 1
in 1
a 1
car 1
before 1
rarely 1
even 1
ridden 1
in 1
wagons 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
we 1
travel 1
on 1
foot 1
ive 1
been 1
right 1
not 1
to 1
cry 1
the 1
station 1
is 1
swarming 1
with 1
reporters 1
with 1
their 1
insectlike 1
cameras 1
trained 1
directly 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
but 1
ive 1
had 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
practice 1
at 1
wiping 1
my 1
face 1
clean 1
of 1
emotions 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
this 1
now 1
i 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
television 1
screen 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
thats 1
airing 1
my 1
arrival 1
live 1
and 1
feel 1
gratified 1
that 1
i 1
appear 1
almost 1
bored 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
has 1
obviously 1
been 1
crying 1
and 1
interestingly 1
enough 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
trying 1
to 1
cover 1
it 1
up 1
i 1
immediately 1
wonder 1
if 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
his 1
strategy 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
to 1
appear 1
weak 1
and 1
frightened 1
to 1
reassure 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
no 1
competition 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
then 1
come 1
out 1
fighting 1
this 1
worked 1
very 1
well 1
for 1
a 1
girl 1
johanna 1
mason 1
from 1
district 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
back 1
she 1
seemed 1
like 1
such 1
a 1
sniveling 1
cowardly 1
fool 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
bothered 1
about 1
her 1
until 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
contestants 1
left 1
it 1
turned 1
out 1
she 1
could 1
kill 1
viciously 1
pretty 1
clever 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
played 1
it 1
but 1
this 1
seems 1
an 1
odd 1
strategy 1
for 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
because 1
hes 1
a 1
bakers 1
son 1
all 1
those 1
years 1
of 1
having 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
hauling 1
bread 1
trays 1
around 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
broadshouldered 1
and 1
strong 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
an 1
awful 1
lot 1
of 1
weeping 1
to 1
convince 1
anyone 1
to 1
overlook 1
him 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
stand 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
of 1
the 1
train 1
while 1
the 1
cameras 1
gobble 1
up 1
our 1
images 1
then 1
were 1
allowed 1
inside 1
and 1
the 1
doors 1
close 1
mercifully 1
behind 1
us 1
the 1
train 1
begins 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
speed 1
initially 1
takes 1
my 1
breath 1
away 1
of 1
course 1
ive 1
never 1
been 1
on 1
a 1
train 1
as 1
travel 1
between 1
the 1
districts 1
is 1
forbidden 1
except 1
for 1
officially 1
sanctioned 1
duties 1
for 1
us 1
thats 1
mainly 1
transporting 1
coal 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
ordinary 1
coal 1
train 1
its 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
highspeed 1
capitol 1
models 1
that 1
average 1
miles 1
per 1
hour 1
our 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
capitol 1
will 1
take 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
day 1
in 1
school 1
they 1
tell 1
us 1
the 1
capitol 1
was 1
built 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
once 1
called 1
the 1
rockies 1
district 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
region 1
known 1
is 1
appalachia 1
even 1
hundreds 1
of 1
years 1
ago 1
they 1
mined 1
coal 1
here 1
which 1
is 1
why 1
our 1
miners 1
have 1
to 1
dig 1
so 1
deep 1
somehow 1
it 1
all 1

back 1
to 1
coal 1
at 1
school 1
besides 1
basic 1
reading 1
and 1
math 1
most 1
of 1
our 1
instruction 1
is 1
coalrelated 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
weekly 1
lecture 1
on 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
panem 1
its 1
mostly 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
blather 1
about 1
what 1
we 1
owe 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
know 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
theyre 1
telling 1
us 1
an 1
actual 1
account 1
of 1
what 1
happened 1
during 1
the 1
rebellion 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
spend 1
much 1
time 1
thinking 1
about 1
it 1
whatever 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
how 1
it 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
get 1
food 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
tribute 1
train 1

fancier 1
than 1
even 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
we 1
are 1
each 1

a 1
hot 1
shower 1
ive 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
shower 1
before 1
its 1
like 1
being 1
in 1
a 1
summer 1
rain 1
only 1
warmer 1
i 1
dress 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
green 1
shirt 1
and 1
pants 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
minute 1
i 1
remember 1
madges 1
little 1
gold 1
pin 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
someone 1
fashioned 1
a 1
small 1
golden 1
bird 1
and 1
then 1
attached 1
a 1
ring 1
around 1
it 1
the 1
bird 1
is 1
connected 1
to 1
the 1
ring 1
only 1
by 1
its 1
wing 1
tips 1
i 1
suddenly 1
recognize 1
it 1
a 1
mocking 1
jay 1
theyre 1
funny 1
birds 1
and 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
slap 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
capitol 1
during 1
the 1
rebellion 1
the 1
capitol 1
bred 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
genetically 1
altered 1
animals 1
as 1
weapons 1
the 1
common 1
term 1
for 1
them 1
was 1
muttations 1
or 1
sometimes 1
mutts 1
for 1
short 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
special 1
bird 1
called 1
a 1
jabber 1
jay 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
memorize 1
and 1
repeat 1
whole 1
human 1
conversations 1
they 1
were 1
homing 1
birds 1
exclusively 1
male 1
that 1
were 1
released 1
into 1
regions 1
where 1
the 1
capitols 1
enemies 1
were 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
hiding 1
after 1
the 1
birds 1
gathered 1
words 1
theyd 1
fly 1
back 1
to 1
centers 1
to 1
be 1
recorded 1
it 1
took 1
people 1
awhile 1
to 1
realize 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
districts 1
how 1
private 1
conversations 1
were 1
being 1
transmitted 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
rebels 1
fed 1
the 1
capitol 1
endless 1
lies 1
and 1
the 1
joke 1
was 1
on 1
it 1
so 1
the 1
centers 1
were 1
shut 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
were 1
abandoned 1
to 1
die 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
wild 1
only 1
they 1
didnt 1
die 1
off 1
instead 1
the 1
jabber 1
jays 1
mated 1
with 1
female 1
mockingbirds 1
creating 1
a 1
whole 1
new 1
species 1
that 1
could 1
replicate 1
both 1
bird 1
whistles 1
and 1
human 1
melodies 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
enunciate 1
words 1
but 1
could 1
still 1
mimic 1
a 1
range 1
of 1
human 1
vocal 1
sounds 1
from 1
a 1
childs 1
highpitched 1
warble 1
to 1
a 1
mans 1
deep 1
tones 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
recreate 1
songs 1
not 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
notes 1
but 1
whole 1
songs 1
with 1
multiple 1
verses 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
the 1
patience 1
to 1
sing 1
them 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
liked 1
your 1
voice 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
particularly 1
fond 1
of 1
mockingjays 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
hunting 1
he 1
would 1
whistle 1
or 1
sing 1
complicated 1
songs 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
polite 1
pause 1
theyd 1
always 1
sing 1
back 1
not 1
everyone 1
is 1
treated 1
with 1
such 1
respect 1
but 1
whenever 1
my 1
father 1
sang 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
in 1
the 1
area 1
would 1
fall 1
silent 1
and 1
listen 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
that 1
beautiful 1
high 1
and 1
clear 1
and 1
so 1
filled 1
with 1
life 1
it 1
made 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
laugh 1
and 1
cry 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
continue 1
the 1
practice 1
after 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
still 1
theres 1
something 1
comforting 1
about 1
the 1
little 1
bird 1
its 1
like 1
having 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
with 1
me 1
protecting 1
me 1
i 1
fasten 1
the 1
pin 1
onto 1
my 1
shirt 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
green 1
fabric 1
as 1
a 1
background 1
i 1
can 1
almost 1
imagine 1
the 1
mockingjay 1
flying 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
effie 1
trinket 1
comes 1
to 1
collect 1
me 1
for 1
supper 1
i 1
follow 1
her 1
through 1
the 1
narrow 1
rocking 1
corridor 1
into 1
a 1
dining 1
room 1
with 1
polished 1
paneled 1
walls 1
theres 1
a 1
table 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
dishes 1
are 1
highly 1
breakable 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
sits 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
the 1
chair 1
next 1
to 1
him 1
empty 1
wheres 1
haymitch 1
asks 1
effie 1
trinket 1
brightly 1
last 1
time 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
nap 1
says 1
peeta 1
well 1
its 1
been 1
an 1
exhausting 1
day 1
says 1
effie 1
trinket 1
i 1
think 1
shes 1
relieved 1
by 1
haymitchs 1
absence 1
and 1
who 1
can 1
blame 1
her 1
the 1
supper 1
comes 1
in 1
courses 1
a 1
thick 1
carrot 1
soup 1
green 1
salad 1
lamb 1
chops 1
and 1
mashed 1
potatoes 1
cheese 1
and 1
fruit 1
a 1
chocolate 1
cake 1
throughout 1
the 1
meal 1
effie 1
trinket 1
keeps 1
reminding 1
us 1
to 1
save 1
space 1
because 1
theres 1
more 1
to 1
come 1
but 1
im 1
stuffing 1
myself 1
because 1
ive 1
never 1
had 1
food 1
like 1
this 1
so 1
good 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
and 1
because 1
probably 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
between 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
games 1
is 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
few 1
pounds 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
two 1
have 1
decent 1
manners 1
says 1
effie 1
as 1
were 1
finishing 1
the 1
main 1
course 1
the 1
pair 1
last 1
year 1
ate 1
everything 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
like 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
savages 1
it 1
completely 1
upset 1
my 1
digestion 1
the 1
pair 1
last 1
year 1
were 1
two 1
kids 1
from 1
the 1
seam 1
whod 1
never 1
not 1
one 1
day 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
had 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
have 1
food 1
table 1
manners 1
were 1
surely 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
on 1
their 1
minds 1
peetas 1
a 1
bakers 1
son 1
my 1
mother 1
taught 1
prim 1
and 1
i 1
to 1
eat 1
properly 1
so 1
yes 1
i 1
can 1
handle 1
a 1
fork 1
and 1
knife 1
but 1
i 1
hate 1
effie 1
trinkets 1
comment 1
so 1
much 1
i 1
make 1
a 1
point 1
of 1
eating 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
meal 1
with 1
my 1
fingers 1
then 1
i 1
wipe 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
tablecloth 1
this 1
makes 1
her 1
purse 1
her 1
lips 1
tightly 1
together 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
meals 1
over 1
im 1
fighting 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
food 1
down 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
peetas 1
looking 1
a 1
little 1
green 1
too 1
neither 1
of 1
our 1
stomachs 1
is 1
used 1
to 1
such 1
rich 1
fare 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
hold 1
down 1
greasy 1
saes 1
concoction 1
of 1
mice 1
meat 1
pig 1
entrails 1
and 1
tree 1
bark 1
a 1
winter 1
specialty 1
im 1
determined 1
to 1
hang 1
on 1
to 1
this 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
another 1
compartment 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
recap 1
of 1
the 1
reapings 1
across 1
panem 1
they 1
try 1
to 1
stagger 1
them 1
throughout 1
the 1
day 1
so 1
a 1
person 1
could 1
conceivably 1
watch 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
live 1
but 1
only 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
could 1
really 1
do 1
that 1
since 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
have 1
to 1
attend 1
reapings 1
themselves 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
we 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
reapings 1
the 1
names 1
called 1
the 1
volunteers 1
stepping 1
forward 1
or 1
more 1
often 1
not 1
we 1
examine 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
the 1
kids 1
who 1
will 1
be 1
our 1
competition 1
a 1
few 1
stand 1
out 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
monstrous 1
boy 1
who 1
lunges 1
forward 1
to 1
volunteer 1
from 1
district 1
a 1
foxfaced 1
girl 1
with 1
sleek 1
red 1
hair 1
from 1
district 1
a 1
boy 1
with 1
a 1
crippled 1
foot 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
most 1
hauntingly 1
a 1
twelveyearold 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
she 1
has 1
dark 1
brown 1
skin 1
and 1
eyes 1
but 1
other 1
than 1
that 1
shes 1
very 1
like 1
prim 1
in 1
size 1
and 1
demeanor 1
only 1
when 1
she 1
mounts 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
they 1
ask 1
for 1
volunteers 1
all 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
is 1
the 1
wind 1
whistling 1
through 1
the 1
decrepit 1
buildings 1
around 1
her 1
theres 1
no 1
one 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
place 1
last 1
of 1
all 1
they 1
show 1
district 1
prim 1
being 1
called 1
me 1
running 1
forward 1
to 1
volunteer 1
you 1
cant 1
miss 1
the 1
desperation 1
in 1
my 1
voice 1
as 1
i 1
shove 1
prim 1
behind 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
im 1
afraid 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
hear 1
and 1
theyll 1
take 1
prim 1
away 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
do 1
hear 1
i 1
see 1
gale 1
pulling 1
her 1
off 1
me 1
and 1
watch 1
myself 1
mount 1
the 1
stage 1
the 1
commentators 1
are 1
not 1
sure 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
the 1
crowds 1
refusal 1
to 1
applaud 1
the 1
silent 1
salute 1
one 1
says 1
that 1
district 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
a 1
bit 1
backward 1
but 1
that 1
local 1
customs 1
can 1
be 1
charming 1
as 1
if 1
on 1
cue 1
haymitch 1
falls 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
they 1
groan 1
comically 1
peetas 1
name 1
is 1
drawn 1
and 1
he 1
quietly 1
takes 1
his 1
place 1
we 1
shake 1
hands 1
they 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
anthem 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
program 1
ends 1
effie 1
trinket 1
is 1
disgruntled 1
about 1
the 1
state 1
her 1
wig 1
was 1
in 1
your 1
mentor 1
has 1
a 1
lot 1
to 1
learn 1
about 1
presentation 1
a 1
lot 1
about 1
televised 1
behavior 1
peeta 1
unexpectedly 1
laughs 1
he 1
was 1
drunk 1
says 1
peeta 1
hes 1
drunk 1
every 1
year 1
every 1
day 1
i 1
add 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
smirking 1
a 1
little 1
effie 1
trinket 1
makes 1
it 1
sound 1
like 1
haymitch 1
just 1

somewhat 1
rough 1
manners 1

a 1
few 1
tips 1
from 1
her 1

your 1
lifeline 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
in 1

games 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
advises 1
you 1
lines 1
up 1
your 1
sponsors 1
and 1
dictates 1
the 1
presentation 1
of 1
any 1
gifts 1
haymitch 1

well 1
be 1
the 1
difference 1
between 1
your 1
life 1
and 1
your 1
death 1

compartment 1
i 1
miss 1

slurred 1
voice 1

vomits 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
expensive 1
carpet 1
and 1

hops 1
in 1

pointy 1
shoes 1

pool 1
of 1
vomit 1
and 1

the 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
take 1
in 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
our 1
mentor 1
trying 1
to 1
rise 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
slippery 1
vile 1
stuff 1
from 1
his 1
stomach 1
the 1
reek 1
of 1

i 1
cant 1

little 1
grateful 1
since 1

out 1
of 1
his 1
chest 1
hair 1
and 1
tuck 1
him 1
into 1
bed 1
possibly 1
peeta 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
good 1
impression 1
on 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
favorite 1
once 1
the 1
games 1
begin 1
but 1
judging 1
by 1
the 1
state 1
hes 1
in 1
haymitch 1
will 1
have 1
no 1
memory 1
of 1
this 1
tomorrow 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
can 1
send 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
people 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
theres 1
any 1
number 1
on 1
the 1
train 1
cooking 1
for 1
us 1
waiting 1
on 1
us 1
guarding 1
us 1
taking 1
care 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
their 1
job 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
them 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
nod 1
and 1
head 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
i 1
understand 1
how 1
peeta 1
feels 1
i 1
cant 1
stand 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
people 1
myself 1
but 1
making 1
them 1
deal 1
with 1
haymitch 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
small 1
form 1
of 1
revenge 1
so 1
im 1
pondering 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
he 1
insists 1
on 1
taking 1
care 1
of 1
haymitch 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
because 1
hes 1
being 1
kind 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
kind 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
bread 1
the 1
idea 1
pulls 1
me 1
up 1
short 1
a 1
kind 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
is 1
far 1
more 1
dangerous 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
an 1
unkind 1
one 1
kind 1
people 1
have 1
a 1
way 1
of 1
working 1
their 1
way 1
inside 1
me 1
and 1
rooting 1
there 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
let 1
peeta 1
do 1
this 1
not 1
where 1
were 1
going 1
so 1
i 1
decide 1
from 1
this 1
moment 1
on 1
to 1
have 1
as 1
little 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
bakers 1
son 1
when 1
i 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
the 1
train 1
is 1
pausing 1
at 1
a 1
platform 1
to 1
refuel 1
i 1
quickly 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
toss 1
the 1
cookies 1
peetas 1
father 1
gave 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
train 1
and 1
slam 1
the 1
glass 1
shut 1
no 1
more 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
either 1
of 1
them 1
unfortunately 1
the 1
packet 1
of 1
cookies 1
hits 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
bursts 1
open 1
in 1
a 1
patch 1
of 1
dandelions 1
by 1
the 1
track 1
i 1
only 1
see 1
the 1
image 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
because 1
the 1
train 1
is 1
off 1
again 1
but 1
its 1
enough 1
enough 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
that 1
other 1
dandelion 1
in 1
the 1
school 1
yard 1
years 1
ago 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
turned 1
away 1
from 1
peeta 1
mellarks 1
bruised 1
face 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dandelion 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
hope 1
wasnt 1
lost 1
i 1
plucked 1
it 1
carefully 1
and 1
hurried 1
home 1
i 1
grabbed 1
a 1
bucket 1
and 1
prims 1
hand 1
and 1
headed 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
and 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
dotted 1
with 1
the 1
goldenheaded 1
weeds 1
after 1
wed 1
harvested 1
those 1
we 1
scrounged 1
along 1
inside 1
the 1
fence 1
for 1
probably 1
a 1
mile 1
until 1
wed 1
filled 1
the 1
bucket 1
with 1
the 1
dandelion 1
greens 1
stems 1
and 1
flowers 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
gorged 1
ourselves 1
on 1
dandelion 1
salad 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
bakery 1
bread 1
what 1
else 1
prim 1
asked 1
me 1
what 1
other 1
food 1
can 1
we 1
find 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
i 1
promised 1
her 1
i 1
just 1
have 1
to 1
remember 1
them 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
a 1
book 1
shed 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
apothecary 1
shop 1
the 1
pages 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
old 1
parchment 1
and 1
covered 1
in 1
ink 1
drawings 1
of 1
plants 1
neat 1
handwritten 1
blocks 1
told 1
their 1
names 1
where 1
to 1
gather 1
them 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
in 1
bloom 1
their 1
medical 1
uses 1
but 1
my 1
father 1
added 1
other 1
entries 1
to 1
the 1
book 1
plants 1
for 1
eating 1
not 1
healing 1
dandelions 1
pokeweed 1
wild 1
onions 1
pines 1
prim 1
and 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
poring 1
over 1
those 1
pages 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
off 1
school 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
i 1
hung 1
around 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
meadow 1
but 1
finally 1
i 1
worked 1
up 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
go 1
under 1
the 1
fence 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
id 1
been 1
there 1
alone 1
without 1
my 1
fathers 1
weapons 1
to 1
protect 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
retrieved 1
the 1
small 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
hed 1
made 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
hollow 1
tree 1
i 1
probably 1
didnt 1
go 1
more 1
than 1
twenty 1
yards 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
day 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
perched 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
oak 1
hoping 1
for 1
game 1
to 1
come 1
by 1
after 1
several 1
hours 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
good 1
luck 1
to 1
kill 1
a 1
rabbit 1
id 1
shot 1
a 1
few 1
rabbits 1
before 1
with 1
my 1
fathers 1
guidance 1
but 1
this 1
id 1
done 1
on 1
my 1
own 1
we 1
hadnt 1
had 1
meat 1
in 1
months 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
rabbit 1
seemed 1
to 1
stir 1
something 1
in 1
my 1
mother 1
she 1
roused 1
herself 1
skinned 1
the 1
carcass 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
stew 1
with 1
the 1
meat 1
and 1
some 1
more 1
greens 1
prim 1
had 1
gathered 1
then 1
she 1
acted 1
confused 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
stew 1
was 1
done 1
we 1
made 1
her 1
eat 1
a 1
bowl 1
the 1
woods 1
became 1
our 1
savior 1
and 1
each 1
day 1
i 1
went 1
a 1
bit 1
farther 1
into 1
its 1
arms 1
it 1
was 1
slowgoing 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
feed 1
us 1
i 1
stole 1
eggs 1
from 1
nests 1
caught 1
fish 1
in 1
nets 1
sometimes 1
managed 1
to 1
shoot 1
a 1
squirrel 1
or 1
rabbit 1
for 1
stew 1
and 1
gathered 1
the 1
various 1
plants 1
that 1
sprung 1
up 1
beneath 1
my 1
feet 1
plants 1
are 1
tricky 1
many 1
are 1
edible 1
but 1
one 1
false 1
mouthful 1
and 1
youre 1
dead 1
i 1
checked 1
and 1
doublechecked 1
the 1
plants 1
i 1
harvested 1
with 1
my 1
fathers 1
pictures 1
i 1
kept 1
us 1
alive 1
any 1
sign 1
of 1
danger 1
a 1
distant 1
howl 1
the 1
inexplicable 1
break 1
of 1
a 1
branch 1
sent 1
me 1
flying 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
fence 1
at 1
first 1
then 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
risk 1
climbing 1
trees 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
wild 1
dogs 1
that 1
quickly 1
got 1
bored 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
bears 1
and 1
cats 1
lived 1
deeper 1
in 1
perhaps 1
disliking 1
the 1
sooty 1
reek 1
of 1
our 1
district 1
on 1
may 1
th 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
signed 1
up 1
for 1
my 1
tesserae 1
and 1
pulled 1
home 1
my 1
first 1
batch 1
of 1
grain 1
and 1
oil 1
in 1
prims 1
toy 1
wagon 1
on 1
the 1
eighth 1
of 1
every 1
month 1
i 1
was 1
entitled 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stop 1
hunting 1
and 1
gathering 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
grain 1
was 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
other 1
things 1
to 1
buy 1
soap 1
and 1
milk 1
and 1
thread 1
what 1
we 1
didnt 1
absolutely 1
have 1
to 1
eat 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
trade 1
at 1
the 1
hob 1
it 1
was 1
frightening 1
to 1
enter 1
that 1
place 1
without 1
my 1
father 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
but 1
people 1
had 1
respected 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
accepted 1
me 1
game 1
was 1
game 1
after 1
all 1
no 1
matter 1
whod 1
shot 1
it 1
i 1
also 1
sold 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
wealthier 1
clients 1
in 1
town 1
trying 1
to 1
remember 1
what 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
learning 1
a 1
few 1
new 1
tricks 1
as 1
well 1
the 1
butcher 1
would 1
buy 1
my 1
rabbits 1
but 1
not 1
squirrels 1
the 1
baker 1
enjoyed 1
squirrel 1
but 1
would 1
only 1
trade 1
for 1
one 1
if 1
his 1
wife 1
wasnt 1
around 1
the 1
head 1
peacekeeper 1
loved 1
wild 1
turkey 1
the 1
mayor 1
had 1
a 1
passion 1
for 1
strawberries 1
in 1
late 1
summer 1
i 1
was 1
washing 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
pond 1
when 1
i 1
noticed 1
the 1
plants 1
growing 1
around 1
me 1
tall 1
with 1
leaves 1
like 1
arrowheads 1
blossoms 1
with 1
three 1
white 1
petals 1
i 1
knelt 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
my 1
fingers 1
digging 1
into 1
the 1
soft 1
mud 1
and 1
i 1
pulled 1
up 1
handfuls 1
of 1
the 1
roots 1
small 1
bluish 1
tubers 1
that 1
dont 1
look 1
like 1
much 1
but 1
boiled 1
or 1
baked 1
are 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
any 1
potato 1
katniss 1
i 1
said 1
aloud 1
its 1
the 1
plant 1
i 1
was 1
named 1
for 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
my 1
fathers 1
voice 1
joking 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
find 1
yourself 1
youll 1
never 1
starve 1
i 1
spent 1
hours 1
stirring 1
up 1
the 1
pond 1
bed 1
with 1
my 1
toes 1
and 1
a 1
stick 1
gathering 1
the 1
tubers 1
that 1
floated 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
feasted 1
on 1
fish 1
and 1
katniss 1
roots 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
months 1
full 1
slowly 1
my 1
mother 1
returned 1
to 1
us 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
clean 1
and 1
cook 1
and 1
preserve 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
food 1
i 1
brought 1
in 1
for 1
winter 1
people 1
traded 1
us 1
or 1
paid 1
money 1
for 1
her 1
medical 1
remedies 1
one 1
day 1
i 1
heard 1
her 1
singing 1
prim 1
was 1
thrilled 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
back 1
but 1
i 1
kept 1
watching 1
waiting 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
disappear 1
on 1
us 1
again 1
i 1
didnt 1
trust 1
her 1
and 1
some 1
small 1
gnarled 1
place 1
inside 1
me 1
hated 1
her 1
for 1
her 1
weakness 1
for 1
her 1
neglect 1
for 1
the 1
months 1
she 1
had 1
put 1
us 1
through 1
prim 1
forgave 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
step 1
back 1
from 1
my 1
mother 1
put 1
up 1
a 1
wall 1
to 1
protect 1
myself 1
from 1
needing 1
her 1
and 1
nothing 1
was 1
ever 1
the 1
same 1
between 1
us 1
again 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
without 1
that 1
ever 1
being 1
set 1
right 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
how 1
i 1
had 1
yelled 1
at 1
her 1
today 1
in 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
i 1
had 1
told 1
her 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
too 1
though 1
so 1
maybe 1
it 1
would 1
all 1
balance 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
i 1
stand 1
staring 1
out 1
the 1
train 1
window 1
wishing 1
i 1
could 1
open 1
it 1
again 1
but 1
unsure 1
of 1
what 1
would 1
happen 1
at 1
such 1
high 1
speed 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
another 1
district 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
i 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
people 1
in 1
their 1
houses 1
settling 1
in 1
for 1
bed 1
i 1
imagine 1
my 1
home 1
with 1
its 1
shutters 1
drawn 1
tight 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
doing 1
now 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
were 1
they 1
able 1
to 1
eat 1
supper 1
the 1
fish 1
stew 1
and 1
the 1
strawberries 1
or 1
did 1
it 1
lay 1
untouched 1
on 1
their 1
plates 1
did 1
they 1
watch 1
the 1
recap 1
of 1
the 1
days 1
events 1
on 1
the 1
battered 1
old 1
tv 1
that 1
sits 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
surely 1
there 1
were 1
more 1
tears 1
is 1
my 1
mother 1
holding 1
up 1
being 1
strong 1
for 1
prim 1
or 1
has 1
she 1
already 1
started 1
to 1
slip 1
away 1
leaving 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
on 1
my 1
sisters 1
fragile 1
shoulders 1
prim 1
will 1
undoubtedly 1
sleep 1
with 1
my 1
mother 1
tonight 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
scruffy 1
old 1
buttercup 1
posting 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
prim 1
comforts 1
me 1
if 1
she 1
cries 1
he 1
will 1
nose 1
his 1
way 1
into 1
her 1
arms 1
and 1
curl 1
up 1
there 1
until 1
she 1
calms 1
down 1
and 1
falls 1
asleep 1
im 1
so 1
glad 1
i 1
didnt 1
drown 1
him 1
imagining 1
my 1
home 1
makes 1
me 1
ache 1
with 1
loneliness 1
this 1
day 1
has 1
been 1
endless 1
could 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
eating 1
blackberries 1
only 1
this 1
morning 1
it 1
seems 1
like 1
a 1
lifetime 1
ago 1
like 1
a 1
long 1
dream 1
that 1
deteriorated 1
into 1
a 1
nightmare 1
maybe 1
if 1
i 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
i 1
will 1
wake 1
up 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
where 1
i 1
belong 1
probably 1
the 1
drawers 1
hold 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
nightgowns 1
but 1
i 1
just 1
strip 1
off 1
my 1
shirt 1
and 1
pants 1
and 1
climb 1
into 1
bed 1
in 1
my 1
underwear 1
the 1
sheets 1
are 1
made 1
of 1
soft 1
silky 1
fabric 1
a 1
thick 1
fluffy 1
comforter 1
gives 1
immediate 1
warmth 1
if 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
cry 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
by 1
morning 1
ill 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
wash 1
the 1
damage 1
done 1
by 1
the 1
tears 1
from 1
my 1
face 1
but 1
no 1
tears 1
come 1
im 1
too 1
tired 1
or 1
too 1
numb 1
to 1
cry 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
i 1
feel 1
is 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
somewhere 1
else 1
so 1
i 1
let 1
the 1
train 1
rock 1
me 1
into 1
oblivion 1
gray 1
light 1
is 1
leaking 1
through 1
the 1
curtains 1
when 1
the 1
rapping 1
rouses 1
me 1
i 1
hear 1
effie 1
trinkets 1
voice 1
calling 1
me 1
to 1
rise 1
up 1
up 1
up 1

going 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
big 1
big 1
big 1
day 1
i 1
try 1
and 1
imagine 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
what 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
like 1
inside 1
that 1
womans 1
head 1
what 1
thoughts 1
fill 1
her 1
waking 1
hours 1
what 1
dreams 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
night 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
i 1
put 1
the 1
green 1
outfit 1
back 1
on 1
since 1
its 1
not 1
really 1
dirty 1
just 1
slightly 1
crumpled 1
from 1
spending 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
my 1
fingers 1
trace 1
the 1
circle 1
around 1
the 1
little 1
gold 1
mockingjay 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
waking 1
up 1
having 1
to 1

slept 1
in 1
the 1
elaborate 1
braided 1
hair 1
my 1
mother 1
did 1
for 1
the 1
reaping 1
and 1
it 1
doesnt 1
look 1
too 1
bad 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
leave 1
it 1
up 1

cant 1
be 1

nudity 1

a 1
cup 1
of 1
black 1

haymitch 1
waving 1

over 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1

into 1
my 1
chair 1
im 1
served 1
an 1
enormous 1
platter 1
of 1
food 1
eggs 1
ham 1
piles 1
of 1
fried 1
potatoes 1
a 1
tureen 1
of 1
fruit 1
sits 1
in 1
ice 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
chilled 1
the 1
basket 1
of 1
rolls 1
they 1
set 1
before 1
me 1
would 1
keep 1
my 1
family 1
going 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
theres 1
an 1
elegant 1
glass 1
of 1
orange 1
juice 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
orange 1
juice 1
ive 1
only 1
even 1
tasted 1
an 1
orange 1
once 1
at 1
new 1
years 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
bought 1
one 1
as 1
a 1
special 1
treat 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
my 1
mother 1
adores 1
coffee 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
almost 1
never 1
afford 1
but 1
it 1
only 1
tastes 1
bitter 1
and 1
thin 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
rich 1
brown 1
cup 1
of 1
something 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
they 1
call 1
it 1
hot 1
chocolate 1
says 1
peeta 1
its 1
good 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
sip 1
of 1
the 1
hot 1
sweet 1
creamy 1
liquid 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
runs 1
through 1
me 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
meal 1
beckons 1
i 1
ignore 1
it 1
until 1
ive 1
drained 1
my 1
cup 1
then 1
i 1
stuff 1
down 1
every 1
mouthful 1
i 1
can 1
hold 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
substantial 1
amount 1
being 1
careful 1
to 1
not 1
overdo 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
richest 1
stuff 1
one 1
time 1
my 1
mother 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
always 1
eat 1
like 1
ill 1
never 1
see 1
food 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
wont 1
unless 1
i 1
bring 1
it 1
home 1
that 1
shut 1
her 1
up 1
when 1
my 1
stomach 1
feels 1
like 1
its 1
about 1
to 1
split 1
open 1
i 1
lean 1
back 1
and 1
take 1
in 1
my 1
breakfast 1
companions 1
peeta 1
is 1
still 1
eating 1
breaking 1
off 1
bits 1
of 1
roll 1
and 1
dipping 1
them 1
in 1
hot 1
chocolate 1
haymitch 1
hasnt 1
paid 1
much 1
attention 1
to 1
his 1
platter 1
but 1
hes 1
knocking 1
back 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
red 1
juice 1
that 1
he 1
keeps 1
thinning 1
with 1
a 1
clear 1
liquid 1
from 1
a 1
bottle 1
judging 1
by 1
the 1
fumes 1
its 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
spirit 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
haymitch 1
but 1
ive 1
seen 1
him 1
often 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
hob 1
tossing 1
handfuls 1
of 1
money 1
on 1
the 1
counter 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
sells 1
white 1
liquor 1
hell 1
be 1
incoherent 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
reach 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
realize 1
i 1
detest 1
haymitch 1
no 1
wonder 1
the 1
district 1
tributes 1
never 1
stand 1
a 1
chance 1
it 1
isnt 1
just 1
that 1
weve 1
been 1
underfed 1
and 1
lack 1
training 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
tributes 1
have 1
still 1
been 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
go 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
we 1
rarely 1
get 1
sponsors 1
and 1
hes 1
a 1
big 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
the 1
rich 1
people 1
who 1
back 1
tributes 1
either 1
because 1
theyre 1
betting 1
on 1
them 1
or 1
simply 1
for 1
the 1
bragging 1
rights 1
of 1
picking 1
a 1
winner 1
expect 1
someone 1
classier 1
than 1
haymitch 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
so 1
youre 1
supposed 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
advice 1
i 1
say 1
to 1
haymitch 1
heres 1
some 1
advice 1
stay 1
alive 1
says 1
haymitch 1
and 1
then 1
bursts 1
out 1
laughing 1
i 1
exchange 1
a 1
look 1
with 1
peeta 1
before 1
i 1
remember 1
im 1
having 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
him 1
im 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
hardness 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
generally 1
seems 1
so 1
mild 1
thats 1
very 1
funny 1
says 1
peeta 1
suddenly 1
he 1
lashes 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
glass 1
in 1
haymitchs 1
hand 1
it 1
shatters 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
sending 1
the 1
bloodred 1
liquid 1
running 1
toward 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
train 1
only 1
not 1
to 1
us 1
haymitch 1
considers 1
this 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
punches 1
peeta 1
in 1
the 1
jaw 1
knocking 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
when 1
he 1
turns 1
back 1
to 1
reach 1
for 1
the 1
spirits 1
i 1
drive 1
my 1
knife 1
into 1
the 1
table 1
between 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
bottle 1
barely 1
missing 1
his 1
fingers 1
i 1
brace 1
myself 1
to 1
deflect 1
his 1
hit 1
but 1
it 1
doesnt 1
come 1
instead 1
he 1
sits 1
back 1
and 1
squints 1
at 1
us 1
well 1
whats 1
this 1
says 1
haymitch 1
did 1
i 1
actually 1
get 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
fighters 1
this 1
year 1
peeta 1
rises 1
from 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
scoops 1
up 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ice 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
fruit 1
tureen 1
he 1
starts 1
to 1
raise 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
red 1
mark 1
on 1
his 1
jaw 1
no 1
says 1
haymitch 1
stopping 1
him 1
let 1
the 1
bruise 1
show 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
think 1
youve 1
mixed 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
another 1
tribute 1
before 1
youve 1
even 1
made 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
arena 1
thats 1
against 1
the 1
rules 1
says 1
peeta 1
only 1
if 1
they 1
catch 1
you 1
that 1
bruise 1
will 1
say 1
you 1
fought 1
you 1
werent 1
caught 1
even 1
better 1
says 1
haymitch 1
he 1
turns 1
to 1
me 1
can 1
you 1
hit 1
anything 1
with 1
that 1
knife 1
besides 1
a 1
table 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
is 1
my 1
weapon 1
but 1
ive 1
spent 1
a 1
fair 1
amount 1
of 1
time 1
throwing 1
knives 1
as 1
well 1
sometimes 1
if 1
ive 1
wounded 1
an 1
animal 1
with 1
an 1
arrow 1
its 1
better 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
knife 1
into 1
it 1
too 1
before 1
i 1
approach 1
it 1
i 1
realize 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
want 1
haymitchs 1
attention 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
moment 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
impression 1
i 1
yank 1
the 1
knife 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
get 1
a 1
grip 1
on 1
the 1
blade 1
and 1
then 1
throw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
wall 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
i 1
was 1
actually 1
just 1
hoping 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
good 1
solid 1
stick 1
but 1
it 1
lodges 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
between 1
two 1
panels 1
making 1
me 1
look 1
a 1
lot 1
better 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
stand 1
over 1
here 1
both 1
of 1
you 1
says 1
haymitch 1
nodding 1
to 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
we 1
obey 1
and 1
he 1
circles 1
us 1
prodding 1
us 1
like 1
animals 1
at 1
times 1
checking 1
our 1
muscles 1
examining 1
our 1
faces 1
well 1

not 1
entirely 1
hopeless 1

the 1
stylists 1

hold 1
of 1
you 1
youll 1
be 1
attractive 1
enough 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
question 1
this 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
arent 1
a 1
beauty 1
contest 1
but 1
the 1
bestlooking 1
tributes 1

seem 1
to 1
pull 1
more 1
sponsors 1

right 1
ill 1
make 1
a 1
deal 1
with 1

interfere 1
with 1
my 1
drinking 1
and 1
ill 1
stay 1
sober 1
enough 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
says 1
haymitch 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
its 1
not 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
deal 1
but 1
still 1
a 1
giant 1
step 1
forward 1
from 1
ten 1
minutes 1
ago 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
guide 1
at 1
all 1
fine 1
says 1
peeta 1
so 1
help 1
us 1
i 1
say 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
arena 1
whats 1
the 1
best 1
strategy 1
at 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
for 1
someone 1
one 1
thing 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
well 1
be 1
pulling 1
into 1
the 1
station 1
youll 1
be 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
your 1
stylists 1
youre 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
like 1
what 1
they 1
do 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
dont 1
resist 1
says 1
haymitch 1
but 1
i 1
begin 1
no 1
buts 1
dont 1
resist 1
says 1
haymitch 1
he 1
takes 1
the 1
bottle 1
of 1
spirits 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
leaves 1
the 1
car 1
as 1
the 1
door 1
swings 1
shut 1
behind 1
him 1
the 1
car 1
goes 1
dark 1
there 1
are 1
still 1
a 1
few 1
lights 1
inside 1
but 1
outside 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
night 1
has 1
fallen 1
again 1
i 1
realize 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
tunnel 1
that 1
runs 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
mountains 1
into 1
the 1
capitol 1
the 1
mountains 1
form 1
a 1
natural 1
barrier 1
between 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
the 1
eastern 1
districts 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
impossible 1
to 1
enter 1
from 1
the 1
east 1
except 1
through 1
the 1
tunnels 1
this 1
geographical 1
advantage 1
was 1
a 1
major 1
factor 1
in 1
the 1
districts 1
losing 1
the 1
war 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
being 1
a 1
tribute 1
today 1
since 1
the 1
rebels 1
had 1
to 1
scale 1
the 1
mountains 1
they 1
were 1
easy 1
targets 1
for 1
the 1
capitols 1
air 1
forces 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
and 1
i 1
stand 1
in 1
silence 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
speeds 1
along 1
the 1
tunnel 1
goes 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
tons 1
of 1
rock 1
separating 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
my 1
chest 1
tightens 1
i 1
hate 1
being 1
encased 1
in 1
stone 1
this 1
way 1
it 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
mines 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
trapped 1
unable 1
to 1
reach 1
sunlight 1
buried 1
forever 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
the 1
train 1
finally 1
begins 1
to 1
slow 1
and 1
suddenly 1
bright 1
light 1
floods 1
the 1
compartment 1
we 1
cant 1
help 1
it 1
both 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
run 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
weve 1
only 1
seen 1
on 1
television 1
the 1
capitol 1
the 1
ruling 1
city 1
of 1
panem 1
the 1
cameras 1
havent 1
lied 1
about 1
its 1
grandeur 1
if 1
anything 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
quite 1
captured 1
the 1
magnificence 1
of 1
the 1
glistening 1
buildings 1
in 1
a 1
rainbow 1
of 1
hues 1
that 1
tower 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
shiny 1
cars 1
that 1
roll 1
down 1
the 1
wide 1
paved 1
streets 1
the 1
oddly 1
dressed 1
people 1
with 1
bizarre 1
hair 1
and 1
painted 1
faces 1
who 1
have 1
never 1
missed 1
a 1
meal 1
all 1
the 1
colors 1
seem 1
artificial 1
the 1
pinks 1
too 1
deep 1
the 1
greens 1
too 1
bright 1
the 1
yellows 1
painful 1
to 1
the 1
eyes 1
like 1
the 1
flat 1
round 1
disks 1
of 1
hard 1
candy 1
we 1
can 1
never 1
afford 1
to 1
buy 1
at 1
the 1
tiny 1
sweet 1
shop 1
in 1
district 1
the 1
people 1
begin 1
to 1
point 1
at 1
us 1
eagerly 1
as 1
they 1
recognize 1
a 1
tribute 1
train 1
rolling 1
into 1
the 1
city 1
i 1
step 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
sickened 1
by 1
their 1
excitement 1
knowing 1
they 1
cant 1
wait 1
to 1
watch 1
us 1
die 1
but 1
peeta 1
holds 1
his 1
ground 1
actually 1
waving 1
and 1
smiling 1
at 1
the 1
gawking 1
crowd 1
he 1
only 1
stops 1
when 1
the 1
train 1
pulls 1
into 1
the 1
station 1
blocking 1
us 1
from 1
their 1
view 1
he 1
sees 1
me 1
staring 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
shrugs 1
who 1
knows 1
he 1
says 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
may 1
be 1
rich 1
i 1
have 1
misjudged 1
him 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
his 1
actions 1
since 1
the 1
reaping 1
began 1
the 1
friendly 1
squeeze 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
his 1
father 1
showing 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
cookies 1
and 1
promising 1
to 1
feed 1
prim 1
did 1
peeta 1
put 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
that 1
his 1
tears 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
volunteering 1
to 1
wash 1
haymitch 1
but 1
then 1
challenging 1
him 1
this 1
morning 1
when 1
apparently 1
the 1
niceguy 1
approach 1
had 1
failed 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
waving 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
already 1
trying 1
to 1
win 1
the 1
crowd 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
pieces 1
are 1
still 1
fitting 1
together 1
but 1
i 1
sense 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
plan 1
forming 1
he 1
hasnt 1
accepted 1
his 1
death 1
he 1
is 1
already 1
fighting 1
hard 1
to 1
stay 1
alive 1
which 1
also 1
means 1
that 1
kind 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
bread 1
is 1
fighting 1
hard 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
riiip 1
i 1
grit 1
my 1
teeth 1
as 1
venia 1
a 1
woman 1
with 1
aqua 1
hair 1
and 1
gold 1
tattoos 1
above 1
her 1
eyebrows 1
yanks 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
fabric 1
from 1
my 1
leg 1
tearing 1
out 1
the 1
hair 1
beneath 1
it 1
sorry 1
she 1
pipes 1
in 1
her 1
silly 1
capitol 1
accent 1
youre 1
just 1
so 1
hairy 1
why 1
do 1
these 1
people 1
speak 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
high 1
pitch 1
why 1
do 1
their 1
jaws 1
barely 1
open 1
when 1
they 1
talk 1
why 1
do 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
their 1
sentences 1
go 1
up 1
as 1
if 1
theyre 1
asking 1
a 1
question 1
odd 1
vowels 1
clipped 1
words 1
and 1
always 1
a 1
hiss 1
on 1
the 1
letter 1
s 1
no 1
wonder 1
its 1
impossible 1
not 1
to 1
mimic 1
them 1
venia 1
makes 1
whats 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
sympathetic 1
face 1
good 1
news 1
though 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
one 1
ready 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
grip 1
on 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
im 1
seated 1
on 1
and 1
nod 1
the 1
final 1
swathe 1
of 1
my 1
leg 1
hair 1
is 1
uprooted 1
in 1
a 1
painful 1
jerk 1
ive 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
remake 1
center 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
three 1
hours 1
and 1
i 1
still 1
havent 1
met 1
my 1
stylist 1
apparently 1
he 1
has 1
no 1
interest 1
in 1
seeing 1
me 1
until 1
venia 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
my 1
prep 1
team 1
have 1
addressed 1
some 1
obvious 1
problems 1
this 1
has 1
included 1
scrubbing 1
down 1
my 1
body 1
with 1
a 1
gritty 1
loam 1
that 1
has 1
removed 1
not 1
only 1
dirt 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
three 1
layers 1
of 1
skin 1
turning 1
my 1
nails 1
into 1
uniform 1
shapes 1
and 1
primarily 1
ridding 1
my 1
body 1
of 1
hair 1
my 1
legs 1
arms 1
torso 1
underarms 1
and 1
parts 1
of 1
my 1
eyebrows 1
have 1
been 1
stripped 1
of 1
the 1
muff 1
leaving 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
plucked 1
bird 1
ready 1
for 1
roasting 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
it 1
my 1
skin 1
feels 1
sore 1
and 1
tingling 1
and 1
intensely 1
vulnerable 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
kept 1
my 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1
with 1
haymitch 1
and 1
no 1
objection 1
has 1
crossed 1
my 1
lips 1
youre 1
doing 1
very 1
well 1
says 1
some 1
guy 1
named 1
flavius 1
he 1
gives 1
his 1
orange 1
corkscrew 1
locks 1
a 1
shake 1
and 1
applies 1
a 1
fresh 1
coat 1
of 1
purple 1
lipstick 1
to 1
his 1
mouth 1
if 1
theres 1
one 1
thing 1
we 1
cant 1
stand 1
its 1
a 1
whiner 1
grease 1
her 1
down 1
venia 1
and 1
octavia 1
a 1
plump 1
woman 1
whose 1
entire 1
body 1
has 1
been 1
dyed 1
a 1
pale 1
shade 1
of 1
pea 1
green 1
rub 1
me 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
lotion 1
that 1
first 1
stings 1
but 1
then 1

the 1
table 1
removing 1
the 1

but 1
theyre 1
so 1
unlike 1
people 1
that 1
im 1
no 1
more 1
selfconscious 1
than 1
if 1
a 1
trio 1
of 1
oddly 1
colored 1
birds 1
were 1
pecking 1
around 1
my 1

theyre 1
such 1
total 1
idiots 1
and 1

odd 1
way 1
i 1
know 1
theyre 1
sincerely 1
trying 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
cold 1
white 1
walls 1
and 1
floor 1
and 1
resist 1
the 1
impulse 1
to 1
retrieve 1
my 1
robe 1
but 1
this 1
cinna 1
my 1
stylist 1
will 1
surely 1
make 1
me 1
remove 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
instead 1
my 1
hands 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
hairdo 1
the 1
one 1
area 1
of 1
my 1
body 1
my 1
prep 1
team 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
leave 1
alone 1
my 1
fingers 1
stroke 1
the 1
silky 1
braids 1
my 1
mother 1
so 1
carefully 1
arranged 1
my 1
mother 1
i 1
left 1
her 1
blue 1
dress 1
and 1
shoes 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
my 1
train 1
car 1
never 1
thinking 1
about 1
retrieving 1
them 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
her 1
of 1
home 1
now 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
door 1
opens 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
must 1
be 1
cinna 1
enters 1
im 1
taken 1
aback 1
by 1
how 1
normal 1
he 1
looks 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
stylists 1
they 1
interview 1
on 1
television 1
are 1
so 1
dyed 1
stenciled 1
and 1
surgically 1
altered 1
theyre 1
grotesque 1
but 1
cinnas 1
closecropped 1
hair 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
its 1
natural 1
shade 1
of 1
brown 1
hes 1
in 1
a 1
simple 1
black 1
shirt 1
and 1
pants 1
the 1
only 1
concession 1
to 1
selfalteration 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
metallic 1
gold 1
eyeliner 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
applied 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
hand 1
it 1
brings 1
out 1
the 1
flecks 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
his 1
green 1
eyes 1
and 1
despite 1
my 1
disgust 1
with 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
their 1
hideous 1
fashions 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
thinking 1
how 1
attractive 1
it 1
looks 1
hello 1
katniss 1
im 1
cinna 1
your 1
stylist 1
he 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
quiet 1
voice 1
somewhat 1
lacking 1
in 1
the 1
capitols 1
affectations 1
hello 1
i 1
venture 1
cautiously 1
just 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
moment 1
all 1
right 1
he 1
asks 1
he 1
walks 1
around 1
my 1
naked 1
body 1
not 1
touching 1
me 1
but 1
taking 1
in 1
every 1
inch 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
i 1
resist 1
the 1
impulse 1
to 1
cross 1
my 1
arms 1
over 1
my 1
chest 1
who 1
did 1
your 1
hair 1
my 1
mother 1
i 1
say 1
its 1
beautiful 1
classic 1
really 1
and 1
in 1
almost 1
perfect 1
balance 1
with 1
your 1
profile 1
she 1
has 1
very 1
clever 1
fingers 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
had 1
expected 1
someone 1
flamboyant 1
someone 1
older 1
trying 1
desperately 1
to 1
look 1
young 1
someone 1
who 1
viewed 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
a 1
platter 1
cinna 1
has 1
met 1
none 1
of 1
these 1
expectations 1
youre 1
new 1
arent 1
you 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
ive 1
seen 1
you 1
before 1
i 1
say 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
stylists 1
are 1
familiar 1
constants 1
in 1
the 1
everchanging 1
pool 1
of 1
tributes 1
some 1
have 1
been 1
around 1
my 1
whole 1
life 1
yes 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
first 1
year 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
says 1
cinna 1
so 1
they 1
gave 1
you 1
district 1
twelve 1
i 1
say 1
newcomers 1
generally 1
end 1
up 1
with 1
us 1
the 1
least 1
desirable 1
district 1
i 1
asked 1
for 1
district 1
twelve 1
he 1
says 1
without 1
further 1
explanation 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
robe 1
and 1
well 1
have 1
a 1
chat 1
pulling 1
on 1
my 1
robe 1
i 1
follow 1
him 1
through 1
a 1
door 1
into 1
a 1
sitting 1
room 1
two 1
red 1
couches 1
face 1
off 1
over 1
a 1
low 1
table 1
three 1
walls 1
are 1
blank 1
the 1
fourth 1
is 1
entirely 1
glass 1
providing 1
a 1
window 1
to 1
the 1
city 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
around 1
noon 1
although 1
the 1
sunny 1
sky 1
has 1
turned 1
overcast 1
cinna 1
invites 1
me 1
to 1
sit 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
couches 1
and 1
takes 1
his 1
place 1
across 1
from 1
me 1
he 1
presses 1
a 1
button 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
top 1
splits 1
and 1
from 1
below 1
rises 1
a 1
second 1
tabletop 1
that 1
holds 1
our 1
lunch 1
chicken 1
and 1
chunks 1
of 1
oranges 1
cooked 1
in 1
a 1
creamy 1
sauce 1
laid 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
pearly 1
white 1
grain 1
tiny 1
green 1
peas 1
and 1
onions 1
rolls 1
shaped 1
like 1
flowers 1
and 1
for 1
dessert 1
a 1
pudding 1
the 1
color 1
of 1
honey 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
imagine 1
assembling 1
this 1
meal 1
myself 1
back 1
home 1
chickens 1
are 1
too 1
expensive 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
do 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
turkey 1
id 1
need 1
to 1
shoot 1
a 1
second 1
turkey 1
to 1
trade 1
for 1
an 1
orange 1
goats 1
milk 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
substitute 1
for 1
cream 1
we 1
can 1
grow 1
peas 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
id 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
wild 1
onions 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
dont 1
recognize 1
the 1
grain 1
our 1
own 1
tessera 1
ration 1
cooks 1
down 1
to 1
an 1
unattractive 1
brown 1
mush 1
fancy 1
rolls 1
would 1
mean 1
another 1
trade 1
with 1
the 1
baker 1
perhaps 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
squirrels 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
pudding 1
i 1
cant 1
even 1
guess 1
whats 1
in 1
it 1
days 1
of 1
hunting 1
and 1
gathering 1
for 1
this 1
one 1
meal 1
and 1
even 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
poor 1
substitution 1
for 1
the 1
capitol 1
version 1
what 1
must 1
it 1
be 1
like 1
i 1
wonder 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
a 1
world 1
where 1
food 1
appears 1
at 1
the 1
press 1
of 1
a 1
button 1
how 1
would 1
i 1
spend 1
the 1
hours 1
i 1
now 1
commit 1
to 1
combing 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
sustenance 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
so 1
easy 1
to 1
come 1
by 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
do 1
all 1
day 1
these 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
besides 1
decorating 1
their 1
bodies 1
and 1
waiting 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
new 1
shipment 1
of 1
tributes 1
to 1
roll 1
in 1
and 1
die 1
for 1
their 1
entertainment 1
i 1
look 1
up 1
and 1
find 1
cinnas 1
eyes 1
trained 1
on 1
mine 1
how 1
despicable 1
we 1
must 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
says 1
has 1
he 1
seen 1
this 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
or 1
somehow 1
read 1
my 1
thoughts 1
hes 1
right 1
though 1
the 1
whole 1
rotten 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
is 1
despicable 1
no 1
matter 1
says 1
cinna 1
so 1
katniss 1
about 1
your 1
costume 1
for 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
my 1
partner 1
portia 1
is 1
the 1
stylist 1
for 1
your 1
fellow 1
tribute 1
peeta 1
and 1
our 1
current 1
thought 1
is 1
to 1
dress 1
you 1
in 1
complementary 1
costumes 1
says 1
cinna 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
its 1
customary 1
to 1
reflect 1
the 1
flavor 1
of 1
the 1
district 1
for 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
youre 1
supposed 1
to 1
wear 1
something 1
that 1
suggests 1
your 1
districts 1
principal 1
industry 1
district 1
agriculture 1
district 1
fishing 1
district 1
factories 1
this 1
means 1
that 1
coming 1
from 1
district 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
coal 1
miners 1
getupsince 1
the 1
baggy 1
miners 1
jumpsuits 1
are 1
not 1
particularly 1
becoming 1
our 1
tributes 1
usually 1
end 1
up 1
in 1
skimpy 1
outfits 1
and 1
hats 1
with 1
headlamps 1
one 1
year 1
our 1
tributes 1
were 1
stark 1
naked 1
and 1
covered 1
in 1
black 1
powder 1
to 1
represent 1
coal 1
dust 1
its 1
always 1
dreadful 1
and 1
does 1
nothing 1
to 1
win 1
favor 1
with 1
the 1
crowd 1
i 1
prepare 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
worst 1
so 1
ill 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
coal 1
miner 1
outfit 1
i 1
ask 1
hoping 1
it 1
wont 1
be 1
indecent 1
not 1
exactly 1
you 1
see 1
portia 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
coal 1
miner 1
things 1
very 1
overdone 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
remember 1
you 1
in 1
that 1
and 1
we 1
both 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
our 1
job 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
district 1
twelve 1
tributes 1
unforgettable 1
says 1
cinna 1
ill 1
be 1
naked 1
for 1
sure 1
i 1
think 1
so 1
rather 1
than 1
focus 1
on 1
the 1
coal 1
mining 1
itself 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
focus 1
on 1
the 1
coal 1
says 1
cinna 1
naked 1
and 1
covered 1
in 1
black 1
dust 1
i 1
think 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
coal 1
we 1
burn 1
it 1
says 1
cinna 1
youre 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
fire 1
are 1
you 1
katniss 1
he 1
sees 1
my 1
expression 1
and 1
grins 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
later 1
i 1
am 1
dressed 1
in 1
what 1
will 1
either 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
sensational 1
or 1
the 1
deadliest 1
costume 1
in 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
im 1
in 1
a 1
simple 1
black 1
unitard 1
that 1
covers 1
me 1
from 1
ankle 1
to 1
neck 1
shiny 1
leather 1
boots 1
lace 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
knees 1
but 1
its 1
the 1
fluttering 1
cape 1
made 1
of 1
streams 1
of 1
orange 1
yellow 1
and 1
red 1
and 1
the 1
matching 1
headpiece 1
that 1
define 1
this 1
costume 1
cinna 1
plans 1
to 1
light 1
them 1
on 1
fire 1
just 1
before 1
our 1
chariot 1
rolls 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
its 1
not 1
real 1
flame 1
of 1
course 1
just 1
a 1

with 1
youll 1

perfectly 1
safe 1
he 1
says 1
but 1
im 1
not 1
convinced 1
i 1
wont 1
be 1
perfectly 1
barbecued 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
reach 1
the 1
citys 1
center 1
my 1
face 1
is 1
relatively 1
clear 1
of 1
makeup 1
just 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
highlighting 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
my 1
hair 1
has 1
been 1
brushed 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
braided 1
down 1
my 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
usual 1
style 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
audience 1
to 1
recognize 1
you 1
when 1
youre 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
says 1
cinna 1
dreamily 1
katniss 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
fire 1
it 1
crosses 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
cinnas 1
calm 1
and 1
normal 1
demeanor 1
masks 1
a 1
complete 1
madman 1
despite 1
this 1
mornings 1
revelation 1
about 1
peetas 1
character 1
im 1
actually 1
relieved 1
when 1
he 1
shows 1
up 1
dressed 1
in 1
an 1
identical 1
costume 1
he 1
should 1
know 1
about 1
fire 1
being 1
a 1
bakers 1
son 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
stylist 1
portia 1
and 1
her 1
team 1
accompany 1
him 1
in 1
and 1
everyone 1
is 1
absolutely 1
giddy 1
with 1
excitement 1
over 1
what 1
a 1
splash 1
well 1
make 1
except 1
cinna 1
he 1
just 1
seems 1
a 1
bit 1
weary 1
as 1
he 1
accepts 1
congratulations 1
were 1
whisked 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
level 1
of 1
the 1
remake 1
center 1
which 1
is 1
essentially 1
a 1
gigantic 1
stable 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
are 1
about 1
to 1
start 1
pairs 1
of 1
tributes 1
are 1
being 1
loaded 1
into 1
chariots 1
pulled 1
by 1
teams 1
of 1
four 1
horsesours 1
are 1
coal 1
black 1
the 1
animals 1
are 1
so 1
well 1
trained 1
no 1
one 1
even 1
needs 1
to 1
guide 1
their 1
reins 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
direct 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
chariot 1
and 1
carefully 1
arrange 1
our 1
body 1
positions 1
the 1
drape 1
of 1
our 1
capes 1
before 1
moving 1
off 1
to 1
consult 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
i 1
whisper 1
to 1
peeta 1
about 1
the 1
fire 1
ill 1
rip 1
off 1
your 1
cape 1
if 1
youll 1
rip 1
off 1
mine 1
he 1
says 1
through 1
gritted 1
teeth 1
deal 1
i 1
say 1
maybe 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
them 1
off 1
soon 1
enough 1
well 1
avoid 1
the 1
worst 1
burns 1
its 1
bad 1
though 1
theyll 1
throw 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
condition 1
were 1
in 1
i 1
know 1
we 1
promised 1
haymitch 1
wed 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
he 1
considered 1
this 1
angle 1
where 1
is 1
haymitch 1
anyway 1
isnt 1
he 1
supposed 1
to 1
protect 1
us 1
from 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
says 1
peeta 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
alcohol 1
in 1
him 1
its 1
probably 1
not 1
advisable 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
around 1
an 1
open 1
flame 1
i 1
say 1
and 1
suddenly 1
were 1
both 1
laughing 1
i 1
guess 1
were 1
both 1
so 1
nervous 1
about 1
the 1
games 1
and 1
more 1
pressingly 1
petrified 1
of 1
being 1
turned 1
into 1
human 1
torches 1
were 1
not 1
acting 1
sensibly 1
the 1
opening 1
music 1
begins 1
its 1
easy 1
to 1
hear 1
blasted 1
around 1
the 1
capitol 1
massive 1
doors 1
slide 1
open 1
revealing 1
the 1
crowdlined 1
streets 1
the 1
ride 1
lasts 1
about 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
and 1
ends 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
city 1
circle 1
where 1
they 1
will 1
welcome 1
us 1
play 1
the 1
anthem 1
and 1
escort 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
which 1
will 1
be 1
our 1
homeprison 1
until 1
the 1
games 1
begin 1
the 1
tributes 1
from 1
district 1
ride 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
chariot 1
pulled 1
by 1
snowwhite 1
horses 1
they 1
look 1
so 1
beautiful 1
spraypainted 1
silver 1
in 1
tasteful 1
tunics 1
glittering 1
with 1
jewels 1
district 1
makes 1
luxury 1
items 1
for 1
the 1
capitol 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
they 1
are 1
always 1
favorites 1
district 1
gets 1
into 1
position 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
at 1
all 1
we 1
are 1
approaching 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
that 1
between 1
the 1
overcast 1
sky 1
and 1
evening 1
hour 1
the 1
light 1
is 1
turning 1
gray 1
the 1
tributes 1
from 1
district 1
are 1
just 1
rolling 1
out 1
when 1
cinna 1
appears 1
with 1
a 1
lighted 1
torch 1
here 1
we 1
go 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
before 1
we 1
can 1
react 1
he 1
sets 1
our 1
capes 1
on 1
fire 1
i 1
gasp 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
heat 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
faint 1
tickling 1
sensation 1
cinna 1
climbs 1
up 1
before 1
us 1
and 1
ignites 1
our 1
headdresses 1
he 1
lets 1
out 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
relief 1
it 1
works 1
then 1
he 1
gently 1
tucks 1
a 1
hand 1
under 1
my 1
chin 1
remember 1
heads 1
high 1
smiles 1
theyre 1
going 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
cinna 1
jumps 1
off 1
the 1
chariot 1
and 1
has 1
one 1
last 1
idea 1
he 1
shouts 1
something 1
up 1
at 1
us 1
but 1
the 1
music 1
drowns 1
him 1
out 1
he 1
shouts 1
again 1
and 1
gestures 1
whats 1
he 1
saying 1
i 1
ask 1
peeta 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
realize 1
that 1
ablaze 1
with 1
the 1
fake 1
flames 1
he 1
is 1
dazzling 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
too 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
hold 1
hands 1
says 1
peeta 1
he 1
grabs 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
left 1
and 1
we 1
look 1
to 1
cinna 1
for 1
confirmation 1
he 1
nods 1
and 1
gives 1
a 1
thumbsup 1
and 1
thats 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
i 1
see 1
before 1
we 1
enter 1
the 1
city 1
the 1
crowds 1
initial 1
alarm 1
at 1
our 1
appearance 1
quickly 1
changes 1
to 1
cheers 1
and 1
shouts 1
of 1
district 1
twelve 1
every 1
head 1
is 1
turned 1
our 1
way 1
pulling 1
the 1
focus 1
from 1
the 1
three 1
chariots 1
ahead 1
of 1
us 1
at 1
first 1
im 1
frozen 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
catch 1
sight 1
of 1
us 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
television 1
screen 1
and 1
am 1
floored 1
by 1
how 1
breathtaking 1
we 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
deepening 1
twilight 1
the 1
firelight 1
illuminates 1
our 1
faces 1
we 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
leaving 1
a 1
trail 1
of 1
fire 1
off 1
the 1
flowing 1
capes 1
cinna 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
minimal 1
makeup 1
we 1
both 1
look 1
more 1
attractive 1
but 1
utterly 1
recognizable 1
remember 1
heads 1
high 1
smiles 1
theyre 1
going 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
i 1
hear 1
cinnas 1
voice 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
lift 1
my 1
chin 1
a 1
bit 1
higher 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
most 1
winning 1
smile 1
and 1
wave 1
with 1
my 1
free 1
hand 1
im 1
glad 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
peeta 1
to 1
clutch 1
for 1
balance 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
steady 1
solid 1
as 1
a 1
rock 1
as 1
i 1
gain 1
confidence 1
i 1
actually 1
blow 1
a 1
few 1
kisses 1
to 1
the 1
crowd 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
are 1
going 1
nuts 1
showering 1
us 1
with 1
flowers 1
shouting 1
our 1
names 1
our 1
first 1
names 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
bothered 1
to 1
find 1
on 1
the 1
program 1
the 1
pounding 1
music 1
the 1
cheers 1
the 1
admiration 1
work 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
my 1
blood 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
suppress 1
my 1
excitement 1
cinna 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
forget 1
me 1
not 1
my 1
look 1
not 1
my 1
name 1
katniss 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
fire 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
flicker 1
of 1
hope 1
rising 1
up 1
in 1
me 1
surely 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
one 1
sponsor 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
on 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
extra 1
help 1
some 1
food 1
the 1
right 1
weapon 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
count 1
myself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
someone 1
throws 1
me 1
a 1
red 1
rose 1
i 1
catch 1
it 1
give 1
it 1
a 1
delicate 1
sniff 1
and 1
blow 1
a 1
kiss 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
giver 1
a 1
hundred 1
hands 1
reach 1
up 1
to 1
catch 1
my 1
kiss 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
real 1
and 1
tangible 1
thing 1
katniss 1
katniss 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
my 1
name 1
being 1
called 1
from 1
all 1
sides 1
everyone 1
wants 1
my 1
kisses 1
its 1
not 1
until 1
we 1
enter 1
the 1
city 1
circle 1
that 1
i 1
realize 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
completely 1
stopped 1
the 1
circulation 1
in 1
peetas 1
hand 1
thats 1
how 1
tightly 1
ive 1
been 1
holding 1
it 1
i 1
look 1
down 1
at 1
our 1
linked 1
fingers 1
as 1
i 1
loosen 1
my 1
grasp 1
but 1
he 1
regains 1
his 1
grip 1
on 1
me 1
no 1
dont 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
me 1
he 1
says 1
the 1
firelight 1
flickers 1
off 1
his 1
blue 1
eyes 1
please 1
i 1
might 1
fall 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
thing 1
okay 1
i 1
say 1
so 1
i 1
keep 1
holding 1
on 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
feeling 1
strange 1
about 1
the 1
way 1
cinna 1
has 1
linked 1
us 1
together 1
its 1
not 1
really 1
fair 1
to 1
present 1
us 1
as 1
a 1
team 1
and 1
then 1
lock 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
to 1
kill 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
twelve 1
chariots 1
fill 1
the 1
loop 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
circle 1
on 1
the 1
buildings 1
that 1
surround 1
the 1
circle 1
every 1
window 1
is 1
packed 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
prestigious 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
our 1
horses 1
pull 1
our 1
chariot 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
president 1
snows 1
mansion 1
and 1
we 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
halt 1
the 1
music 1
ends 1
with 1
a 1
flourish 1
the 1
president 1
a 1
small 1
thin 1
man 1
with 1
paperwhite 1
hair 1
gives 1
the 1
official 1
welcome 1
from 1
a 1
balcony 1
above 1
us 1
it 1
is 1
traditional 1
to 1
cut 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
the 1
tributes 1
during 1
the 1
speech 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
getting 1
way 1
more 1
than 1
our 1
share 1
of 1
airtime 1
the 1
darker 1
it 1
becomes 1
the 1
more 1
difficult 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
take 1
your 1
eyes 1
off 1
our 1
flickering 1
when 1
the 1
national 1
anthem 1
plays 1
they 1
do 1
make 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
quick 1
cut 1
around 1
to 1
each 1
pair 1
of 1
tributes 1
but 1
the 1
camera 1
holds 1
on 1
the 1
district 1
chariot 1
as 1
it 1
parades 1
around 1
the 1
circle 1
one 1
final 1
time 1
and 1
disappears 1
into 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
the 1
doors 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
shut 1
behind 1
us 1
when 1
were 1
engulfed 1
by 1
the 1
prep 1
teams 1
who 1
are 1
nearly 1
unintelligible 1
as 1
they 1
babble 1
out 1
praise 1
as 1
i 1
glance 1
around 1
i 1
notice 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
are 1
shooting 1
us 1
dirty 1
looks 1
which 1
confirms 1
what 1
ive 1
suspected 1
weve 1
literally 1
outshone 1
them 1
all 1
then 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
are 1
there 1
helping 1
us 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
chariot 1
carefully 1
removing 1
our 1
flaming 1
capes 1
and 1
headdresses 1
portia 1
extinguishes 1
them 1
with 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
spray 1
from 1
a 1
canister 1
i 1
realize 1
im 1
still 1
glued 1
to 1
peeta 1
and 1
force 1
my 1
stiff 1
fingers 1
to 1
open 1
we 1
both 1
massage 1
our 1
hands 1
thanks 1
for 1
keeping 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
a 1
little 1
shaky 1
there 1
says 1
peeta 1
it 1
didnt 1
show 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
im 1
sure 1
no 1
one 1
noticed 1
im 1
sure 1
they 1
didnt 1
notice 1
anything 1
but 1
you 1
you 1
should 1
wear 1
flames 1
more 1
often 1
he 1
says 1
they 1
suit 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
smile 1
that 1
seems 1
so 1
genuinely 1
sweet 1
with 1
just 1
the 1
right 1
touch 1
of 1
shyness 1
that 1
unexpected 1
warmth 1
rushes 1
through 1
me 1
a 1
warning 1
bell 1
goes 1
off 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
dont 1
be 1
so 1
stupid 1
peeta 1
is 1
planning 1
how 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
i 1
remind 1
myself 1
he 1
is 1
luring 1
you 1
in 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
easy 1
prey 1
the 1
more 1
likable 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
deadly 1
he 1
is 1
but 1
because 1
two 1
can 1
play 1
at 1
this 1
game 1
i 1
stand 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
and 1
kiss 1
his 1
cheek 1
right 1
on 1
his 1
bruise 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
has 1
a 1
tower 1
designed 1
exclusively 1
for 1
the 1
tributes 1
and 1
their 1
teams 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
our 1
home 1
until 1
the 1
actual 1
games 1
begin 1
each 1
district 1
has 1
an 1
entire 1
floor 1
you 1
simply 1
step 1
onto 1
an 1
elevator 1
and 1
press 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
your 1
district 1
easy 1
enough 1
to 1
remember 1
ive 1
ridden 1
the 1
elevator 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
in 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
once 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
medal 1
for 1
my 1
fathers 1
death 1
and 1
then 1
yesterday 1
to 1
say 1
my 1
final 1
goodbyes 1
to 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
family 1
but 1
thats 1
a 1
dark 1
and 1
creaky 1
thing 1
that 1
moves 1
like 1
a 1
snail 1
and 1
smells 1
of 1
sour 1
milk 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
this 1
elevator 1
are 1
made 1
of 1
crystal 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
watch 1
the 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
shrink 1
to 1
ants 1
as 1
you 1
shoot 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
its 1
exhilarating 1
and 1
im 1
tempted 1
to 1
ask 1
effie 1
trinket 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
ride 1
it 1
again 1
but 1
somehow 1
that 1
seems 1
childish 1
apparently 1
effie 1
trinkets 1
duties 1
did 1
not 1
conclude 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
she 1
and 1
haymitch 1
will 1
be 1
overseeing 1
us 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
thats 1
a 1
plus 1
because 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
can 1
be 1
counted 1
on 1
to 1
corral 1
us 1
around 1
to 1
places 1
on 1
time 1
whereas 1
we 1
havent 1
seen 1
haymitch 1
since 1
he 1
agreed 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
on 1
the 1
train 1
probably 1
passed 1
out 1
somewhere 1
effie 1
trinket 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
flying 1
high 1
were 1
the 1
first 1
team 1
shes 1
ever 1
chaperoned 1
that 1
made 1
a 1
splash 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
shes 1
complimentary 1
about 1
not 1
just 1
our 1
costumes 1
but 1
how 1
we 1
conducted 1
ourselves 1
and 1
to 1
hear 1
her 1
tell 1
it 1
effie 1
knows 1
everyone 1
whos 1
anyone 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
has 1
been 1
talking 1
us 1
up 1
all 1
day 1
trying 1
to 1
win 1
us 1
sponsors 1
ive 1
been 1
very 1
mysterious 1
though 1
she 1
says 1
her 1
eyes 1
squint 1
half 1
shut 1
because 1
of 1
course 1
haymitch 1
hasnt 1
bothered 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
your 1
strategies 1
but 1
ive 1
done 1
my 1
best 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
how 1
katniss 1
sacrificed 1
herself 1
for 1
her 1
sister 1
how 1
youve 1
both 1
successfully 1
struggled 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
barbarism 1
of 1
your 1
district 1
barbarism 1
thats 1
ironic 1
coming 1
from 1
a 1
woman 1
helping 1
to 1
prepare 1
us 1
for 1
slaughter 1
and 1
whats 1
she 1
basing 1
our 1
success 1
on 1
our 1
table 1
manners 1
everyone 1
has 1
their 1
reservations 1
naturally 1
you 1
being 1
from 1
the 1
coal 1
district 1
but 1
i 1
said 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
very 1
clever 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
said 1
well 1
if 1
you 1
put 1
enough 1
pressure 1
on 1
coal 1
it 1
turns 1
to 1
pearls 1
effie 1
beams 1
at 1
us 1
so 1
brilliantly 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
respond 1
enthusiastically 1
to 1
her 1
cleverness 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
wrong 1
coal 1
doesnt 1
turn 1
to 1
pearls 1
they 1
grow 1
in 1
shellfish 1
possibly 1
she 1
meant 1
coal 1
turns 1
to 1
diamonds 1
but 1
thats 1
untrue 1
too 1
ive 1
heard 1
they 1
have 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
machine 1
in 1
district 1
that 1
can 1
turn 1
graphite 1
into 1
diamonds 1
but 1
we 1
dont 1
mine 1
graphite 1
in 1
district 1
that 1
was 1
part 1
of 1
district 1
s 1
job 1
until 1
they 1
were 1
destroyed 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
people 1
shes 1
been 1
plugging 1
us 1
to 1
all 1
day 1
either 1
know 1
or 1
care 1
unfortunately 1
i 1
cant 1
seal 1
the 1
sponsor 1
deals 1
for 1
you 1
only 1
haymitch 1
can 1
do 1
that 1
says 1
effie 1
grimly 1
but 1
dont 1
worry 1
ill 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
at 1
gunpoint 1
if 1
necessary 1
although 1
lacking 1
in 1
many 1
departments 1
effie 1
trinket 1
has 1
a 1
certain 1
determination 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
admire 1
my 1
quarters 1
are 1
larger 1
than 1
our 1
entire 1
house 1
back 1
home 1
they 1
are 1
plush 1
like 1
the 1
train 1
car 1
but 1
also 1
have 1
so 1
many 1
automatic 1
gadgets 1
that 1
im 1
sure 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
press 1
all 1
the 1
buttons 1
the 1
shower 1
alone 1
has 1
a 1
panel 1
with 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
hundred 1
options 1
you 1
can 1
choose 1
regulating 1
water 1
temperature 1
pressure 1
soaps 1
shampoos 1
scents 1
oils 1
and 1
massaging 1
sponges 1
when 1
you 1
step 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
mat 1
heaters 1
come 1
on 1
that 1
blowdry 1
your 1
body 1
instead 1
of 1
struggling 1
with 1
the 1
knots 1
in 1
my 1
wet 1
hair 1
i 1
merely 1
place 1
my 1
hand 1
on 1
a 1
box 1
that 1
sends 1
a 1
current 1
through 1
my 1
scalp 1
untangling 1
parting 1
and 1
drying 1
my 1
hair 1
almost 1
instantly 1
it 1
floats 1
down 1
around 1
my 1
shoulders 1
in 1
a 1
glossy 1
curtain 1
i 1
program 1
the 1
closet 1
for 1
an 1
outfit 1
to 1
my 1
taste 1
the 1
windows 1
zoom 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
on 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
at 1
my 1
command 1
you 1
need 1
only 1
whisper 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
food 1
from 1
a 1
gigantic 1
menu 1
into 1
a 1
mouthpiece 1
and 1
it 1
appears 1
hot 1
and 1
steamy 1
before 1
you 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
minute 1
i 1
walk 1
around 1
the 1
room 1
eating 1
goose 1
liver 1
and 1
puffy 1
bread 1
until 1
theres 1
a 1
knock 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
effies 1
calling 1
me 1
to 1
dinner 1
good 1
im 1
starving 1
peeta 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
are 1
standing 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
balcony 1
that 1
overlooks 1
the 1
capitol 1
when 1
we 1
enter 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
im 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
stylists 1
particularly 1
after 1
i 1
hear 1
that 1
haymitch 1
will 1
be 1
joining 1
us 1
a 1
meal 1
presided 1
over 1
by 1
just 1
effie 1
and 1
haymitch 1
is 1
bound 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
disaster 1
besides 1
dinner 1
isnt 1
really 1
about 1
food 1
its 1
about 1
planning 1
out 1
our 1
strategies 1
and 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
have 1
already 1
proven 1
how 1
valuable 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
silent 1
young 1
man 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
white 1
tunic 1
offers 1
us 1
all 1
stemmed 1
glasses 1
of 1
wine 1
i 1
think 1
about 1
turning 1
it 1
down 1
but 1
ive 1
never 1
had 1
wine 1
except 1
the 1
homemade 1
stuff 1
my 1
mother 1
uses 1
for 1
coughs 1
and 1
when 1
will 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
again 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
sip 1
of 1
the 1
tart 1
dry 1
liquid 1
and 1
secretly 1
think 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
improved 1
by 1
a 1
few 1
spoonfuls 1
of 1
honey 1
haymitch 1
shows 1
up 1
just 1
as 1
dinner 1
is 1
being 1
served 1
it 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
hes 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
stylist 1
because 1
hes 1
clean 1
and 1
groomed 1
and 1
about 1
as 1
sober 1
as 1
ive 1
ever 1
seen 1
him 1
he 1
doesnt 1
refuse 1
the 1
offer 1
of 1
wine 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
starts 1
in 1
on 1
his 1
soup 1
i 1
realize 1
its 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
ive 1
ever 1
seen 1
him 1
eat 1
maybe 1
he 1
really 1
will 1
pull 1
himself 1
together 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
civilizing 1
effect 1
on 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
at 1
least 1
theyre 1
addressing 1
each 1
other 1
decently 1
and 1
they 1
both 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
praise 1
for 1
our 1
stylists 1
opening 1
act 1
while 1
they 1
make 1
small 1
talk 1
i 1
concentrate 1
on 1
the 1
meal 1
mushroom 1
soup 1
bitter 1
greens 1
with 1
tomatoes 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
peas 1
rare 1
roast 1
beef 1
sliced 1
as 1
thin 1
as 1
paper 1
noodles 1
in 1
a 1
green 1
sauce 1
cheese 1
that 1
melts 1
on 1
your 1
tongue 1
served 1
with 1
sweet 1
blue 1
grapes 1
the 1
servers 1
all 1
young 1
people 1
dressed 1
in 1
white 1
tunics 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
gave 1
us 1
wine 1
move 1
wordlessly 1
to 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
keeping 1
the 1
platters 1
and 1
glasses 1
full 1
about 1
halfway 1
through 1
my 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
my 1
head 1
starts 1
feeling 1
foggy 1
so 1
i 1
change 1
to 1
water 1
instead 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
the 1
feeling 1
and 1
hope 1
it 1
wears 1
off 1
soon 1
how 1
haymitch 1
can 1
stand 1
walking 1
around 1
like 1
this 1
fulltime 1
is 1
a 1
mystery 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
focus 1
on 1
the 1
talk 1
which 1
has 1
turned 1
to 1
our 1
interview 1
costumes 1
when 1
a 1
girl 1
sets 1
a 1
gorgeouslooking 1
cake 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
deftly 1
lights 1
it 1
it 1
blazes 1
up 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
flames 1
flicker 1
around 1
the 1
edges 1
awhile 1
until 1
it 1
finally 1
goes 1
out 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
doubt 1
what 1
makes 1
it 1
burn 1
is 1
it 1
alcohol 1
i 1
say 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
girl 1
thats 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
i 1
wa 1
oh 1
i 1

im 1
certain 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
dark 1
red 1
hair 1
the 1
striking 1
features 1
the 1
porcelain 1
white 1
skin 1
but 1
even 1
as 1
i 1
utter 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
feel 1
my 1
insides 1
contracting 1
with 1
anxiety 1
and 1
guilt 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
cant 1
pull 1
it 1
up 1
i 1
know 1
some 1
bad 1
memory 1
is 1
associated 1
with 1
her 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
terror 1
that 1
crosses 1
her 1
face 1
only 1
adds 1
to 1
my 1
confusion 1
and 1
unease 1
she 1
shakes 1
her 1
head 1
in 1
denial 1
quickly 1
and 1
hurries 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
the 1
four 1
adults 1
are 1
watching 1
me 1
like 1
hawks 1

avox 1

very 1
thought 1
whats 1

stupidly 1
someone 1
who 1
committed 1
a 1
crime 1
they 1
cut 1
her 1
tongue 1
so 1
she 1
cant 1
speak 1
says 1
haymitch 1
shes 1
probably 1
a 1
traitor 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
not 1
likely 1
youd 1
know 1
her 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
did 1
youre 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
them 1

that 1
haymitch 1

mentioned 1

the 1
replay 1
of 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1

a 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
couples 1
make 1
a 1
nice 1
impression 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
can 1
hold 1
a 1
candle 1
to 1

show 1
us 1
coming 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
remake 1
center 1
whose 1
idea 1
was 1
the 1
hand 1
holding 1
asks 1
haymitch 1
cinnas 1
says 1
portia 1
just 1
the 1
perfect 1
touch 1
of 1
rebellion 1
says 1
haymitch 1
very 1
nice 1
rebellion 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
that 1
one 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
other 1
couples 1
standing 1
stiffly 1
apart 1
never 1
touching 1
or 1
acknowledging 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
if 1
their 1
fellow 1
tribute 1
did 1
not 1
exist 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
games 1
had 1
already 1
begun 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
haymitch 1
means 1
presenting 1
ourselves 1
not 1
as 1
adversaries 1
but 1
as 1
friends 1
has 1
distinguished 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
the 1
fiery 1
costumes 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
training 1
session 1
meet 1
me 1
for 1
breakfast 1
and 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
exactly 1
how 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
play 1
it 1
says 1
haymitch 1
to 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
now 1
go 1
get 1
some 1
sleep 1
while 1
the 1
grownups 1
talk 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
walk 1
together 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
to 1
our 1
rooms 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
my 1
door 1
he 1
leans 1
against 1
the 1
frame 1
not 1
blocking 1
my 1
entrance 1
exactly 1
but 1
insisting 1
i 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
him 1
so 1
delly 1
cartwright 1
imagine 1
finding 1
her 1
lookalike 1
here 1
hes 1
asking 1
for 1
an 1
explanation 1
and 1
im 1
tempted 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
one 1
we 1
both 1
know 1
he 1
covered 1
for 1
me 1
so 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
his 1
debt 1
again 1
if 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
the 1
truth 1
about 1
the 1
girl 1
somehow 1
that 1
might 1
even 1
things 1
up 1
how 1
can 1
it 1
hurt 1
really 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
repeated 1
the 1
story 1
it 1
couldnt 1
do 1
me 1
much 1
harm 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
something 1
i 1
witnessed 1
and 1
he 1
lied 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
about 1
delly 1
cartwright 1
i 1
realize 1
i 1
do 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
someone 1
about 1
the 1
girl 1
someone 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
figure 1
out 1
her 1
story 1
gale 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
first 1
choice 1
but 1
its 1
unlikely 1
ill 1
ever 1
see 1
gale 1
again 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
think 1
if 1
telling 1
peeta 1
could 1
give 1
him 1
any 1
possible 1
advantage 1
over 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
how 1
maybe 1
sharing 1
a 1
confidence 1
will 1
actually 1
make 1
him 1
believe 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
friend 1
besides 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
with 1
her 1
maimed 1
tongue 1
frightens 1
me 1
she 1
has 1
reminded 1
me 1
why 1
im 1
here 1
not 1
to 1
model 1
flashy 1
costumes 1
and 1
eat 1
delicacies 1
but 1
to 1
die 1
a 1
bloody 1
death 1
while 1
the 1
crowds 1
urge 1
on 1
my 1
killer 1
to 1
tell 1
or 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
my 1
brain 1
still 1
feels 1
slow 1
from 1
the 1
wine 1
i 1
stare 1
down 1
the 1
empty 1
corridor 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
decision 1
lies 1
there 1
peeta 1
picks 1
up 1
on 1
my 1
hesitation 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
yet 1
i 1
shake 1
my 1
head 1
cinna 1
showed 1
me 1
you 1
can 1
practically 1
see 1
the 1
whole 1
city 1
the 1
winds 1
a 1
bit 1
loud 1
though 1
i 1
translate 1
this 1
into 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
overhear 1
us 1
talking 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
you 1
do 1
have 1
the 1
sense 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
be 1
under 1
surveillance 1
here 1
can 1
we 1
just 1
go 1
up 1
sure 1
come 1
on 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
follow 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
flight 1
of 1
stairs 1
that 1
lead 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
theres 1
a 1
small 1
domeshaped 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
outside 1
as 1
we 1
step 1
into 1
the 1
cool 1
windy 1
evening 1
air 1
i 1
catch 1
my 1
breath 1
at 1
the 1
view 1
the 1
capitol 1
twinkles 1
like 1
a 1
vast 1
field 1
of 1
fireflies 1
electricity 1
in 1
district 1
comes 1
and 1
goes 1
usually 1
we 1
only 1
have 1
it 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
a 1
day 1
often 1
the 1
evenings 1
are 1
spent 1
in 1
candlelight 1
the 1
only 1
time 1
you 1
can 1
count 1
on 1
it 1
is 1
when 1
theyre 1
airing 1
the 1
games 1
or 1
some 1
important 1
government 1
message 1
on 1
television 1
that 1
its 1
mandatory 1
to 1
watch 1
but 1
here 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
shortage 1
ever 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
walk 1
to 1
a 1
railing 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
i 1
look 1
straight 1
down 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
to 1
the 1
street 1
which 1
is 1
buzzing 1
with 1
people 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
their 1
cars 1
an 1
occasional 1
shout 1
and 1
a 1
strange 1
metallic 1
tinkling 1
in 1
district 1
wed 1
all 1
be 1
thinking 1
about 1
bed 1
right 1
now 1
i 1
asked 1
cinna 1
why 1
they 1
let 1
us 1
up 1
here 1
werent 1
they 1
worried 1
that 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
tributes 1
might 1
decide 1
to 1
jump 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
says 1
peeta 1
whatd 1
he 1
say 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
cant 1
says 1
peeta 1
he 1
holds 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
seemingly 1
empty 1
space 1
theres 1
a 1
sharp 1
zap 1
and 1
he 1
jerks 1
it 1
back 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
electric 1
field 1
throws 1
you 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
always 1
worried 1
about 1
our 1
safety 1
i 1
say 1
even 1
though 1
cinna 1
has 1
shown 1
peeta 1
the 1
roof 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
were 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
up 1
here 1
now 1
so 1
late 1
and 1
alone 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
tributes 1
on 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
roof 1
before 1
but 1
that 1
doesnt 1
mean 1
were 1
not 1
being 1
taped 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
theyre 1
watching 1
us 1
now 1
maybe 1
he 1
admits 1
come 1
see 1
the 1
garden 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
dome 1
theyve 1
built 1
a 1
garden 1
with 1
flower 1
beds 1
and 1
potted 1
trees 1
from 1
the 1
branches 1
hang 1
hundreds 1
of 1
wind 1
chimes 1
which 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
tinkling 1
i 1
heard 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
on 1
this 1
windy 1
night 1
its 1
enough 1
to 1
drown 1
out 1
two 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
trying 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
peeta 1
looks 1
at 1
me 1
expectantly 1
i 1
pretend 1
to 1
examine 1
a 1
blossom 1
we 1
were 1
hunting 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
one 1
day 1
hidden 1
waiting 1
for 1
game 1
i 1
whisper 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
he 1
whispers 1
back 1
no 1
my 1
friend 1
gale 1
suddenly 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
stopped 1
singing 1
at 1
once 1
except 1
one 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
giving 1
a 1
warning 1
call 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
saw 1
her 1
im 1
sure 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
girl 1
a 1
boy 1
was 1
with 1
her 1
their 1
clothes 1
were 1
tattered 1
they 1
had 1
dark 1
circles 1
under 1
their 1
eyes 1
from 1
no 1
sleep 1
they 1
were 1
running 1
as 1
if 1
their 1
lives 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
im 1
silent 1
as 1
i 1
remember 1
how 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
pair 1
clearly 1
not 1
from 1
district 1
fleeing 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
immobilized 1
us 1
later 1
we 1
wondered 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
helped 1
them 1
escape 1
perhaps 1
we 1

of 1
spear 1
through 1
the 1

count 1
the 1
ruins 1
of 1
district 1
that 1
still 1
smolder 1
from 1
the 1
toxic 1
bombs 1
they 1
show 1
it 1
on 1
television 1
occasionally 1
just 1
to 1

around 1
nervously 1
it 1
was 1
loud 1
enough 1
to 1
hear 1
above 1
the 1
chimes 1
he 1
laughs 1
id 1
go 1
home 1
now 1
if 1
they 1

me 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
admit 1
the 1
foods 1
prime 1
hes 1
covered 1
again 1
if 1
thats 1
all 1
youd 1
heard 1
it 1
would 1
just 1
sound 1
like 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
a 1
scared 1
tribute 1
not 1
someone 1
contemplating 1
the 1
unquestionable 1
goodness 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
its 1
getting 1
chilly 1
we 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
he 1
says 1
inside 1
the 1
dome 1
its 1
warm 1
and 1
bright 1
his 1
tone 1
is 1
conversational 1
your 1
friend 1
gale 1
hes 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
took 1
your 1
sister 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
reaping 1
yes 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
him 1
i 1
ask 1
not 1
really 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
girls 1
talk 1
about 1
him 1
a 1
lot 1
i 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
your 1
cousin 1
or 1
something 1
you 1
favor 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
says 1
no 1
were 1
not 1
related 1
i 1
say 1
peeta 1
nods 1
unreadable 1
did 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
you 1
yes 1
i 1
say 1
observing 1
him 1
carefully 1
so 1
did 1
your 1
father 1
he 1
brought 1
me 1
cookies 1
peeta 1
raises 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
news 1
but 1
after 1
watching 1
him 1
lie 1
so 1
smoothly 1
i 1
dont 1
give 1
this 1
much 1
weight 1
really 1
well 1
he 1
likes 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
sister 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
wishes 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
houseful 1
of 1
boys 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
ever 1
have 1
been 1
discussed 1
around 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
at 1
the 1
bakery 1
fire 1
just 1
in 1
passing 1
in 1
peetas 1
house 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
start 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
when 1
the 1
mother 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
knew 1
your 1
mother 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
kids 1
says 1
peeta 1
another 1
surprise 1
but 1
probably 1
true 1
oh 1
yes 1
she 1
grew 1
up 1
in 1
town 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
seems 1
impolite 1
to 1
say 1
she 1
never 1
mentioned 1
the 1
baker 1
except 1
to 1
compliment 1
his 1
bread 1

at 1
my 1
door 1
i 1
give 1
back 1

you 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
see 1
you 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
walks 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
hall 1
when 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
door 1
the 1
redheaded 1
girl 1
is 1
collecting 1
my 1
unitard 1
and 1
boots 1
from 1
where 1
i 1
left 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
before 1
my 1
shower 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
apologize 1
for 1
possibly 1
getting 1
her 1
in 1
trouble 1
earlier 1
but 1
i 1
remember 1
im 1
not 1
supposed 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
unless 1
im 1
giving 1
her 1
an 1
order 1
oh 1
sorry 1
i 1
say 1
i 1

supposed 1
to 1
get 1
those 1
back 1
to 1
cinna 1
im 1
sorry 1
can 1
you 1
take 1
them 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
avoids 1
my 1
eyes 1
gives 1
a 1
small 1
nod 1
and 1
heads 1
out 1
the 1
door 1
id 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
i 1
was 1
sorry 1
about 1
dinner 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
my 1
apology 1
runs 1
much 1
deeper 1
that 1
im 1
ashamed 1
i 1
never 1
tried 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
i 1
let 1
the 1
capitol 1
kill 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
mutilate 1
her 1
without 1
lifting 1
a 1
finger 1
just 1
like 1
i 1
was 1
watching 1
the 1
games 1
i 1
kick 1
off 1
my 1
shoes 1
and 1
climb 1
under 1
the 1
covers 1
in 1
my 1
clothes 1
the 1
shivering 1
hasnt 1
stopped 1
perhaps 1
the 1
girl 1
doesnt 1
even 1
remember 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
she 1
does 1
you 1
dont 1
forget 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
person 1
who 1
was 1
your 1
last 1
hope 1
i 1
pull 1
the 1
covers 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
will 1
protect 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
redheaded 1
girl 1
who 1
cant 1
speak 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
her 1
eyes 1
staring 1
at 1
me 1
piercing 1
through 1
walls 1
and 1
doors 1
and 1
bedding 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
shell 1
enjoy 1
watching 1
me 1
die 1
my 1
slumbers 1
are 1
filled 1
with 1
disturbing 1
dreams 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
girl 1
intertwines 1
with 1
gory 1
images 1
from 1
earlier 1
hunger 1
games 1
with 1
my 1
mother 1
withdrawn 1
and 1
unreachable 1
with 1
prim 1
emaciated 1
and 1
terrified 1
i 1
bolt 1
up 1
screaming 1
for 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
run 1
as 1
the 1
mine 1
explodes 1
into 1
a 1
million 1
deadly 1
bits 1
of 1
light 1
dawn 1
is 1
breaking 1
through 1
the 1
windows 1
the 1
capitol 1
has 1
a 1
misty 1
haunted 1
air 1
my 1
head 1
aches 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
bitten 1
into 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
my 1
cheek 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
my 1
tongue 1
probes 1
the 1
ragged 1
flesh 1
and 1
i 1
taste 1
blood 1
slowly 1
i 1
drag 1
myself 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
shower 1
i 1
arbitrarily 1
punch 1
buttons 1
on 1
the 1
control 1
board 1
and 1
end 1
up 1
hopping 1
from 1
foot 1
to 1
foot 1
as 1
alternating 1
jets 1
of 1
icy 1
cold 1
and 1
steaming 1
hot 1
water 1
assault 1
me 1
then 1
im 1
deluged 1
in 1
lemony 1
foam 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
scrape 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
bristled 1
brush 1
oh 1
well 1
at 1
least 1
my 1
blood 1
is 1
flowing 1
when 1

dried 1
and 1
moisturized 1
with 1
lotion 1
i 1

distance 1
what 1

last 1
night 1

fiery 1
debut 1
at 1
the 1
games 1
did 1
it 1
give 1
them 1
hope 1
or 1
simply 1
add 1
to 1
their 1
terror 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
twentyfour 1
tributes 1
circled 1
together 1
knowing 1
only 1
one 1
could 1
live 1

come 1
in 1
bid 1
me 1
good 1
morning 1
fill 1
their 1
plates 1

once 1
the 1
games 1

surely 1
they 1
must 1
know 1
this 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
haymitch 1
telling 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
the 1
stylists 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
anyone 1
but 1
cinna 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
tempted 1
to 1
ignore 1
him 1
but 1
after 1
last 1
nights 1
triumph 1
i 1
dont 1

a 1
chance 1
to 1
perform 1
in 1
private 1
before 1

gamemakers 1
the 1
thought 1

he 1
pushes 1

pocket 1
and 1

arena 1
theyll 1
be 1
tripping 1
over 1
each 1
other 1
to 1
sponsor 1
you 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
i 1
say 1
peeta 1
rolls 1
his 1
eyes 1
at 1
haymitch 1
she 1
has 1
no 1
idea 1
the 1
effect 1
she 1
can 1
have 1
he 1
runs 1
his 1
fingernail 1
along 1
the 1
wood 1
grain 1
in 1
the 1
table 1
refusing 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
does 1
he 1
mean 1
people 1
help 1
me 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
dying 1
of 1
starvation 1
no 1
one 1
helped 1
me 1
no 1
one 1
except 1
peeta 1
once 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
barter 1
with 1
things 1
changed 1
im 1
a 1
tough 1
trader 1
or 1
am 1
i 1
what 1
effect 1
do 1
i 1
have 1
that 1
im 1
weak 1
and 1
needy 1
is 1
he 1
suggesting 1
that 1
i 1
got 1
good 1
deals 1
because 1
people 1
pitied 1
me 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
think 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
true 1
perhaps 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
merchants 1
were 1
a 1
little 1
generous 1
in 1
their 1
trades 1
but 1
i 1
always 1
attributed 1
that 1
to 1
their 1
longstanding 1
relationship 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
besides 1
my 1
game 1
is 1
firstclass 1
no 1
one 1
pitied 1
me 1
i 1
glower 1
at 1
the 1
roll 1
sure 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
insult 1
me 1
after 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
of 1
this 1
haymitch 1
says 1
well 1
then 1
well 1
well 1
well 1
katniss 1

no 1
guarantee 1
theyll 1

with 1
the 1
gamemakers 1

peeta 1
shes 1
right 1
never 1
underestimate 1
strength 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
very 1
often 1
physical 1
power 1
tilts 1
the 1
advantage 1

a 1
player 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
they 1

be 1
friends 1
talking 1
up 1
each 1
others 1
strengths 1
insisting 1
the 1
other 1
take 1
credit 1
for 1
their 1
abilities 1
because 1
in 1
fact 1
at 1
some 1
point 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
knock 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
accept 1
were 1
bitter 1
adversaries 1
which 1
id 1
be 1
prepared 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
now 1
if 1
it 1
wasnt 1
for 1
haymitchs 1
stupid 1
instruction 1
that 1
we 1
stick 1
together 1
in 1
training 1
its 1
my 1
own 1
fault 1
i 1
guess 1
for 1
telling 1
him 1
he 1
didnt 1
have 1
to 1
coach 1
us 1
separately 1
but 1
that 1
didnt 1
mean 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
with 1
peeta 1
who 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
clearly 1
doesnt 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
partnering 1
up 1
with 1
me 1
either 1
i 1
hear 1
peetas 1
voice 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
she 1
has 1
no 1
idea 1
the 1
effect 1
she 1
can 1
have 1
obviously 1
meant 1
to 1
demean 1
me 1
right 1
but 1
a 1
tiny 1
part 1
of 1
me 1
wonders 1
if 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
compliment 1
that 1
he 1
meant 1
i 1
was 1
appealing 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
its 1
weird 1
how 1
much 1
hes 1
noticed 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
attention 1
hes 1
paid 1
to 1
my 1
hunting 1
and 1
apparently 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
as 1
oblivious 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
imagined 1
either 1
the 1
flour 1
the 1
wrestling 1
i 1
have 1
kept 1
track 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
with 1
the 1
bread 1
its 1
almost 1
ten 1
i 1
clean 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
smooth 1
back 1
my 1
hair 1
again 1
anger 1
temporarily 1
blocked 1
out 1
my 1
nervousness 1
about 1
meeting 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
my 1
anxiety 1
rising 1
again 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
meet 1
effie 1
and 1
peeta 1
at 1
the 1
elevator 1
i 1
catch 1
myself 1
biting 1
my 1
nails 1
i 1
stop 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
actual 1
training 1
rooms 1
are 1
below 1
ground 1
level 1
of 1
our 1
building 1
with 1
these 1
elevators 1
the 1
ride 1
is 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
minute 1
the 1
doors 1
open 1
into 1
an 1
enormous 1
gymnasium 1
filled 1
with 1
various 1
weapons 1
and 1
obstacle 1
courses 1
although 1
its 1
not 1
yet 1
ten 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
ones 1
to 1
arrive 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
are 1
gathered 1
in 1
a 1
tense 1
circle 1
they 1
each 1
have 1
a 1
cloth 1
square 1
with 1
their 1
district 1
number 1
on 1
it 1
pinned 1
to 1
their 1
shirts 1
while 1
someone 1
pins 1
the 1
number 1
on 1
my 1
back 1
i 1
do 1
a 1
quick 1
assessment 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
the 1
only 1
two 1
dressed 1
alike 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
join 1
the 1
circle 1
the 1
head 1
trainer 1
a 1
tall 1
athletic 1
woman 1
named 1
atala 1
steps 1
up 1
and 1
begins 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
training 1
schedule 1
experts 1
in 1
each 1
skill 1
will 1
remain 1
at 1
their 1
stations 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
free 1
to 1
travel 1
from 1
area 1
to 1
area 1
as 1
we 1
choose 1
per 1
our 1
mentors 1
instructions 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
stations 1
teach 1
survival 1
skills 1
others 1
fighting 1
techniques 1
we 1
are 1
forbidden 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
any 1
combative 1
exercise 1
with 1
another 1
tribute 1
there 1
are 1
assistants 1
on 1
hand 1
if 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
practice 1
with 1
a 1
partner 1
when 1
atala 1
begins 1
to 1
read 1
down 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
skill 1
stations 1
my 1
eyes 1
cant 1
help 1
flitting 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
its 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
weve 1
been 1
assembled 1
on 1
level 1
ground 1
in 1
simple 1
clothes 1
my 1
heart 1
sinks 1
almost 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
and 1
at 1
least 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
girls 1
are 1
bigger 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
even 1
though 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
tributes 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
fed 1
properly 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
it 1
in 1
their 1
bones 1
their 1
skin 1
the 1
hollow 1
look 1
in 1
their 1
eyes 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
smaller 1
naturally 1
but 1
overall 1
my 1
familys 1
resourcefulness 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
an 1
edge 1
in 1
that 1
area 1
i 1
stand 1
straight 1
and 1
while 1
im 1
thin 1
im 1
strong 1
the 1
meat 1
and 1
plants 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
combined 1
with 1
the 1
exertion 1
it 1
took 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
healthier 1
body 1
than 1
most 1
of 1
those 1
i 1
see 1
around 1
me 1
the 1
exceptions 1
are 1
the 1
kids 1
from 1
the 1
wealthier 1
districts 1
the 1
volunteers 1
the 1
ones 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
fed 1
and 1
trained 1
throughout 1
their 1
lives 1
for 1
this 1
moment 1
the 1
tributes 1
from 1
and 1
traditionally 1
have 1
this 1
look 1
about 1
them 1
its 1
technically 1
against 1
the 1
rules 1
to 1
train 1
tributes 1
before 1
they 1
reach 1
the 1
capitol 1
but 1
it 1
happens 1
every 1
year 1
in 1
district 1
we 1
call 1
them 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
or 1
just 1
the 1
careers 1
and 1
like 1
as 1
not 1
the 1
winner 1
will 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
slight 1
advantage 1
i 1
held 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
my 1
fiery 1
entrance 1
last 1
night 1
seems 1
to 1
vanish 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
my 1
competition 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
were 1
jealous 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
not 1
because 1
we 1
were 1
amazing 1
because 1
our 1
stylists 1
were 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
nothing 1
but 1
contempt 1
in 1
the 1
glances 1
of 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
each 1
must 1
have 1
fifty 1
to 1
a 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
on 1
me 1
they 1
project 1
arrogance 1
and 1
brutality 1
when 1
atala 1
releases 1
us 1
they 1
head 1
straight 1
for 1
the 1
deadliestlooking 1
weapons 1
in 1
the 1
gym 1
and 1
handle 1
them 1
with 1
ease 1
im 1
thinking 1
that 1
its 1
lucky 1
im 1
a 1
fast 1
runner 1
when 1
peeta 1
nudges 1
my 1
arm 1
and 1
i 1
jump 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
beside 1
me 1
per 1
haymitchs 1
instructionshis 1
expression 1
is 1
sober 1
where 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
start 1
i 1
look 1
around 1
at 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
who 1
are 1
showing 1
off 1
clearly 1
trying 1
to 1
intimidate 1
the 1
field 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
others 1
the 1
underfed 1
the 1
incompetent 1
shakily 1
having 1
their 1
first 1
lessons 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
or 1
an 1
ax 1
suppose 1
we 1
tie 1
some 1
knots 1
i 1
say 1
right 1
you 1
are 1
says 1
peeta 1
we 1
cross 1
to 1
an 1
empty 1
station 1
where 1
the 1
trainer 1
seems 1
pleased 1
to 1
have 1
students 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
the 1
knottying 1
class 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
hot 1
spot 1
when 1
he 1
realizes 1
i 1
know 1
something 1
about 1
snares 1
he 1
shows 1
us 1
a 1
simple 1
excellent 1
trap 1
that 1
will 1
leave 1
a 1
human 1
competitor 1
dangling 1
by 1
a 1
leg 1
from 1
a 1
tree 1
we 1
concentrate 1
on 1
this 1
one 1
skill 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
until 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
have 1
mastered 1
it 1
then 1
we 1
move 1
on 1
to 1
camouflage 1
peeta 1
genuinely 1
seems 1
to 1
enjoy 1
this 1
station 1
swirling 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
mud 1
and 1
clay 1
and 1
berry 1
juices 1
around 1
on 1
his 1
pale 1
skin 1
weaving 1
disguises 1
from 1
vines 1
and 1
leaves 1
the 1
trainer 1
who 1
runs 1
the 1
camouflage 1
station 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
enthusiasm 1
at 1
his 1
work 1
i 1
do 1
the 1
cakes 1
he 1
admits 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
cakes 1
i 1
ask 1
ive 1
been 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
watching 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
send 1
a 1
spear 1
through 1
a 1
dummys 1
heart 1
from 1
fifteen 1
yards 1
what 1
cakes 1
at 1
home 1
the 1
iced 1
ones 1
for 1
the 1
bakery 1
he 1
says 1
he 1
means 1
the 1
ones 1
they 1
display 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
fancy 1
cakes 1
with 1
flowers 1
and 1
pretty 1
things 1
painted 1
in 1
frosting 1
theyre 1
for 1
birthdays 1
and 1
new 1
years 1
day 1
when 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
prim 1
always 1
drags 1
me 1
over 1
to 1
admire 1
them 1
although 1
wed 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
afford 1
one 1
theres 1
little 1
enough 1
beauty 1
in 1
district 1
though 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
deny 1
her 1
this 1
i 1
look 1
more 1
critically 1
at 1
the 1
design 1
on 1
peetas 1
arm 1
the 1
alternating 1
pattern 1
of 1
light 1
and 1
dark 1
suggests 1
sunlight 1
falling 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
he 1
knows 1
this 1
since 1
i 1
doubt 1
hes 1
ever 1
been 1
beyond 1
the 1
fence 1
has 1
he 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
pick 1
this 1
up 1
from 1
just 1
that 1
scraggly 1
old 1
apple 1
tree 1
in 1
his 1
backyard 1
somehow 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
his 1
skill 1
those 1
inaccessible 1
cakes 1
the 1
praise 1
of 1
the 1
camouflage 1
expert 1
annoys 1
me 1
its 1
lovely 1
if 1
only 1
you 1
could 1
frost 1
someone 1
to 1
death 1
i 1
say 1
dont 1
be 1
so 1
superior 1
you 1
can 1
never 1
tell 1
what 1
youll 1
find 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
say 1
its 1
actually 1
a 1
gigantic 1
cake 1
begins 1
peeta 1
say 1
we 1
move 1
on 1
i 1
break 1
in 1
so 1
the 1
next 1
three 1
days 1
pass 1
with 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
going 1
quietly 1
from 1
station 1
to 1
station 1
we 1
do 1
pick 1
up 1
some 1
valuable 1
skills 1
from 1
starting 1
fires 1
to 1
knife 1
throwing 1
to 1
making 1
shelter 1
despite 1
haymitchs 1
order 1
to 1
appear 1
mediocre 1
peeta 1
excels 1
in 1
handtohand 1
combat 1
and 1
i 1
sweep 1
the 1
edible 1
plants 1
test 1
without 1
blinking 1
an 1
eye 1
we 1
steer 1
clear 1
of 1
archery 1
and 1
weightlifting 1
though 1
wanting 1
to 1
save 1
those 1
for 1
our 1
private 1
sessions 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
appeared 1
early 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
twenty 1
or 1
so 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
dressed 1
in 1
deep 1
purple 1
robes 1
they 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
elevated 1
stands 1
that 1
surround 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
sometimes 1
wandering 1
about 1
to 1
watch 1
us 1
jotting 1
down 1
notes 1
other 1
times 1
eating 1
at 1
the 1
endless 1
banquet 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
for 1
them 1
ignoring 1
the 1
lot 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
they 1
do 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
keeping 1
their 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
district 1
tributes 1
several 1
times 1
ive 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
find 1
one 1
fixated 1
on 1
me 1
they 1
consult 1
with 1
the 1
trainers 1
during 1
our 1
meals 1
as 1
well 1
we 1
see 1
them 1
all 1
gathered 1
together 1
when 1
we 1
come 1
back 1
breakfast 1
and 1
dinner 1
are 1
served 1
on 1
our 1
floor 1
but 1
at 1
lunch 1
the 1
twentyfour 1
of 1
us 1
eat 1
in 1
a 1
dining 1
room 1
off 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
food 1
is 1
arranged 1
on 1
carts 1
around 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
you 1
serve 1
yourself 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
tend 1
to 1
gather 1

its 1
not 1
easy 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
topic 1
talking 1

painful 1
talking 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
unbearable 1
one 1
day 1
peeta 1
empties 1
our 1

careful 1
to 1
include 1
types 1
from 1

along 1
with 1
the 1
refined 1

somehow 1
although 1
its 1
made 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
stuff 1
it 1
looks 1
a 1
lot 1
more 1
appetizing 1
than 1
the 1
ugly 1
drop 1
biscuits 1
that 1
are 1
the 1
standard 1
fare 1
at 1

and 1
animate 1
my 1
face 1

rights 1
to 1
a 1
beehive 1

while 1

a 1
shot 1
at 1

shadow 1

im 1

too 1
bad 1
at 1

if 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
throw 1
too 1
far 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
standing 1
back 1
a 1
bit 1
watching 1
us 1
shes 1
the 1
twelveyearold 1
the 1
one 1
who 1

me 1
so 1
of 1
prim 1

stature 1
up 1
close 1
she 1

bright 1
dark 1
eyes 1
and 1
satiny 1
brown 1
skin 1
and 1
stands 1
tilted 1
up 1
on 1
her 1
toes 1
with 1
her 1
arms 1
slightly 1
extended 1
to 1
her 1
sides 1
as 1
if 1
ready 1
to 1
take 1
wing 1
at 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
its 1
impossible 1
not 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
a 1
bird 1
i 1
pick 1
up 1
another 1
spear 1
while 1
peeta 1
throws 1
i 1
think 1
her 1
names 1
rue 1
he 1
says 1
softly 1
i 1
bite 1
my 1
lip 1
rue 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
yellow 1
flower 1
that 1
grows 1
in 1
the 1
meadow 1
rue 1
primrose 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
tip 1
the 1
scale 1
at 1
seventy 1
pounds 1
soaking 1
wet 1
what 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
ask 1
him 1
more 1
harshly 1
than 1
i 1
intended 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
says 1
back 1
just 1
making 1
conversation 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
shes 1
there 1
its 1
hard 1
to 1
ignore 1
the 1
child 1
she 1
slips 1
up 1
and 1
joins 1
us 1
at 1
different 1
stations 1
like 1
me 1
shes 1
clever 1
with 1
plants 1
climbs 1
swiftly 1
and 1
has 1
good 1
aim 1
she 1
can 1
hit 1
the 1
target 1
every 1
time 1
with 1
a 1
slingshot 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
slingshot 1
against 1
a 1
pound 1
male 1
with 1
a 1
sword 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
district 1
floor 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
grill 1
us 1
throughout 1
breakfast 1
and 1
dinner 1
about 1
every 1
moment 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
what 1
we 1
did 1
who 1
watched 1
us 1
how 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
size 1
up 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
arent 1
around 1

theres 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
add 1
any 1
sanity 1
to 1
the 1
meals 1
not 1
that 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
are 1
fighting 1
anymore 1
instead 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
one 1
mind 1
determined 1
to 1
whip 1
us 1
into 1
shape 1
full 1
of 1
endless 1
directions 1
about 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
and 1
not 1
do 1
in 1
training 1
peeta 1
is 1
more 1
patient 1
but 1
i 1
become 1
fed 1
up 1
and 1
surly 1
when 1
we 1
finally 1
escape 1
to 1
bed 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
night 1

a 1
sound 1
that 1
is 1
somewhere 1
between 1
a 1
snort 1
and 1
a 1
laugh 1
then 1
catch 1
myself 1
its 1
messing 1
with 1
my 1
mind 1
too 1
much 1
trying 1
to 1
keep 1
straight 1
when 1
were 1
supposedly 1
friends 1
and 1
when 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
least 1
when 1
we 1

into 1
the 1
arena 1

where 1
we 1

pretend 1
when 1

no 1
one 1
around 1

katniss 1
he 1

tiredly 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
only 1
talk 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
third 1

comes 1
back 1
once 1
they 1

left 1
as 1
the 1
room 1
empties 1
the 1
pressure 1
to 1
appear 1
friendly 1
lightens 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
they 1
call 1
rue 1
we 1
are 1
left 1
alone 1

sit 1
in 1
silence 1
until 1
they 1
summon 1
peeta 1
he 1
rises 1
remember 1
what 1
haymitch 1

about 1
being 1
sure 1
to 1
throw 1
the 1
weights 1
the 1
words 1

although 1
if 1
im 1
going 1
to 1

others 1
better 1
for 1
our 1
district 1
for 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1

in 1
trouble 1

too 1
much 1
to 1
wine 1

than 1
anything 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
theres 1
nothing 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
but 1

with 1
the 1
plan 1
i 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
archery 1
station 1
oh 1
the 1
weapons 1
ive 1
been 1
itching 1
to 1
get 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
them 1
for 1
days 1
bows 1
made 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
plastic 1
and 1
metal 1
and 1
materials 1
i 1
cant 1
even 1
name 1
arrows 1
with 1
feathers 1
cut 1
in 1
flawless 1
uniform 1
lines 1
i 1
choose 1
a 1
bow 1
string 1
it 1
and 1
sling 1
the 1
matching 1
quiver 1
of 1
arrows 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
theres 1
a 1
shooting 1
range 1
but 1
its 1
much 1
too 1
limited 1
standard 1
bullseyes 1
and 1
human 1
silhouettes 1
i 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
center 1
of 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
and 1
pick 1
my 1
first 1
target 1
the 1
dummy 1
used 1
for 1
knife 1
practice 1
even 1
as 1
i 1
pull 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
bow 1
i 1
know 1
something 1
is 1
wrong 1
the 1
strings 1
tighter 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
i 1
use 1
at 1
home 1
the 1
arrows 1
more 1
rigid 1
i 1
miss 1
the 1
dummy 1
by 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
inches 1
and 1
lose 1
what 1
little 1
attention 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
commanding 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
im 1
humiliated 1
then 1
i 1
head 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bullseye 1
i 1
shoot 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
until 1
i 1
get 1
the 1
feel 1
of 1
these 1
new 1
weapons 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
center 1
of 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
i 1
take 1
my 1
initial 1
position 1
and 1
skewer 1
the 1
dummy 1
right 1
through 1
the 1
heart 1
then 1
i 1
sever 1
the 1
rope 1
that 1
holds 1
the 1
sandbag 1
for 1
boxing 1
and 1
the 1
bag 1
splits 1
open 1
as 1
it 1
slams 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
without 1
pausing 1
i 1
shoulderroll 1
forward 1
come 1
up 1
on 1
one 1
knee 1
and 1
send 1
an 1
arrow 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hanging 1
lights 1
high 1
above 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
floor 1
a 1
shower 1
of 1
sparks 1
bursts 1
from 1
the 1
fixture 1
its 1
excellent 1
shooting 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
a 1
few 1
are 1
nodding 1
approval 1
but 1
the 1
majority 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
fixated 1
on 1
a 1
roast 1
pig 1
that 1
has 1
just 1
arrived 1
at 1
their 1
banquet 1
table 1
suddenly 1
i 1
am 1
furious 1
that 1
with 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
the 1
line 1
they 1
dont 1
even 1
have 1
the 1
decency 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
im 1
being 1
upstaged 1
by 1
a 1
dead 1
pig 1
my 1
heart 1
starts 1
to 1
pound 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
my 1
face 1
burning 1
without 1
thinking 1
i 1
pull 1
an 1
arrow 1
from 1
my 1
quiver 1
and 1
send 1
it 1
straight 1
at 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
table 1
i 1
hear 1
shouts 1
of 1
alarm 1
as 1
people 1
stumble 1
back 1
the 1
arrow 1
skewers 1
the 1
apple 1
in 1
the 1
pigs 1
mouth 1
and 1
pins 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
behind 1
it 1
everyone 1
stares 1
at 1
me 1
in 1
disbelief 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
consideration 1
i 1
say 1
then 1
i 1
give 1
a 1
slight 1
bow 1
and 1
walk 1
straight 1
toward 1
the 1
exit 1
without 1
being 1
dismissed 1
as 1
i 1
stride 1
toward 1
the 1
elevator 1
i 1
fling 1
my 1
bow 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
my 1
quiver 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
i 1

that 1
arrow 1
flying 1
at 1
the 1
gamemakers 1

future 1
tributes 1
of 1
panem 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
thinking 1
shooting 1
at 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
wasnt 1
i 1
was 1
shooting 1
at 1
that 1
apple 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
angry 1
at 1
being 1
ignored 1
i 1
wasnt 1
trying 1
to 1
kill 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
theyd 1
be 1
dead 1
oh 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
its 1
not 1
like 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
win 1
the 1
games 1
anyway 1
who 1
cares 1
what 1
they 1
do 1
to 1
me 1
what 1
really 1
scares 1
me 1
is 1
what 1
they 1
might 1
do 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
how 1
my 1
family 1
might 1
suffer 1
now 1
because 1
of 1
my 1
impulsiveness 1
will 1
they 1
take 1
their 1
few 1
belongings 1
or 1
send 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
prison 1
and 1
prim 1
to 1
the 1
community 1
home 1
or 1
kill 1
them 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
kill 1
them 1
would 1
they 1
why 1
not 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
care 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
stayed 1
and 1
apologized 1
or 1
laughed 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
joke 1
then 1
maybe 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
some 1
leniency 1
but 1
instead 1
i 1
stalked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
disrespectful 1
manner 1
possible 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
are 1
knocking 1
on 1
my 1
door 1
i 1
shout 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
and 1
eventually 1
they 1
do 1
it 1
takes 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
hour 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
cry 1
myself 1
out 1
then 1
i 1
just 1
lay 1
curled 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
stroking 1
the 1
silken 1
sheets 1
watching 1
the 1
sun 1
set 1
over 1
the 1
artificial 1
candy 1
capitol 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
expect 1
guards 1
to 1
come 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
as 1
time 1
passes 1
it 1
seems 1
less 1
likely 1
i 1
calm 1
down 1
they 1
still 1
need 1
a 1
girl 1
tribute 1
from 1
district 1
dont 1
they 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
want 1
to 1
punish 1
me 1
they 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
publicly 1
wait 1
until 1
im 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
and 1
sic 1
starving 1
wild 1
animals 1
on 1
me 1
you 1
can 1
bet 1
theyll 1
make 1
sure 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
to 1
defend 1
myself 1
before 1
that 1
though 1
theyll 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
score 1
so 1
low 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
their 1
right 1
mind 1
would 1
sponsor 1
me 1
thats 1
what 1
will 1
happen 1
tonight 1
since 1
the 1
training 1
isnt 1
open 1
to 1
viewers 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
announce 1
a 1
score 1
for 1
each 1
player 1
it 1
gives 1
the 1
audience 1
a 1
starting 1
place 1
for 1
the 1
betting 1
that 1
will 1
continue 1
throughout 1
the 1
games 1
the 1
number 1
which 1
is 1
between 1
one 1
and 1
twelve 1
one 1
being 1
irredeemably 1
bad 1
and 1
twelve 1
being 1
unattainably 1
high 1
signifies 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
the 1
tribute 1
the 1
mark 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
guarantee 1
of 1
which 1
person 1
will 1
win 1
its 1
only 1
an 1
indication 1
of 1
the 1
potential 1
a 1
tribute 1
showed 1
in 1
training 1
often 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
variables 1
in 1
the 1
actual 1
arena 1
highscoring 1
tributes 1
go 1
down 1
almost 1
immediately 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
won 1
the 1
games 1
only 1
received 1
a 1
three 1
still 1
the 1
scores 1
can 1
help 1
or 1
hurt 1
an 1
individual 1
tribute 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
sponsorship 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
hoping 1
my 1
shooting 1
skills 1
might 1
get 1
me 1
a 1
six 1
or 1
a 1
seven 1
even 1
if 1
im 1
not 1
particularly 1
powerful 1
now 1
im 1
sure 1
ill 1
have 1
the 1
lowest 1
score 1
of 1
the 1
twentyfour 1
if 1
no 1
one 1
sponsors 1
me 1
my 1
odds 1
of 1
staying 1
alive 1
decrease 1
to 1
almost 1
zero 1
when 1
effie 1
taps 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
to 1
dinner 1
i 1
decide 1
i 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
go 1
the 1
scores 1
will 1
be 1
televised 1
tonight 1
its 1
not 1
like 1
i 1
can 1
hide 1
what 1
happened 1
forever 1
i 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
bathroom 1
and 1
wash 1
my 1
face 1
but 1
its 1
still 1
red 1
and 1
splotchy 1
everyones 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
even 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
i 1
wish 1
the 1
stylists 1
hadnt 1
shown 1
up 1
because 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
disappointing 1
them 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
ive 1
thrown 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
work 1
they 1
did 1
on 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
without 1
a 1
thought 1
i 1
avoid 1
looking 1
at 1
anyone 1
as 1
i 1
take 1
tiny 1
spoonfuls 1
of 1
fish 1
soup 1
the 1
saltiness 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
tears 1
the 1
adults 1
begin 1
some 1
chitchat 1
about 1
the 1
weather 1
forecast 1
and 1
i 1
let 1
my 1
eyes 1
meet 1
peetas 1
he 1
raises 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
a 1
question 1
what 1
happened 1
i 1
just 1
give 1
my 1
head 1
a 1
small 1
shake 1
then 1
as 1
theyre 1
serving 1
the 1
main 1
course 1
i 1
hear 1
haymitch 1
say 1
okay 1
enough 1
small 1
talk 1
just 1
how 1
bad 1
were 1
you 1
today 1
peeta 1
jumps 1
in 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
mattered 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
showed 1
up 1
no 1
one 1
even 1
bothered 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
they 1
were 1
singing 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
drinking 1
song 1
i 1
think 1
so 1
i 1
threw 1
around 1
some 1
heavy 1
objects 1
until 1
they 1
told 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
a 1
bit 1
better 1
its 1
not 1
like 1
peeta 1
attacked 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
was 1
provoked 1
too 1
and 1
you 1
sweetheart 1
says 1
haymitch 1
somehow 1
haymitch 1
calling 1
me 1
sweetheart 1
ticks 1
me 1
off 1
enough 1
that 1
im 1
at 1
least 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
i 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
at 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
everyone 1
stops 1
eating 1
you 1
what 1
the 1
horror 1
in 1
effies 1
voice 1
confirms 1
my 1
worse 1
suspicions 1
i 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
at 1
them 1
not 1
exactly 1
at 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
direction 1
its 1
like 1
peeta 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
shooting 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
ignoring 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
just 1
i 1
just 1
lost 1
my 1
head 1
so 1
i 1
shot 1
an 1
apple 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
stupid 1
roast 1
pigs 1
mouth 1
i 1
say 1
defiantly 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
say 1
says 1
cinna 1
carefully 1
nothing 1
or 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
i 1
walked 1
out 1
after 1
that 1
i 1
say 1
without 1
being 1
dismissed 1
gasps 1
effie 1
i 1
dismissed 1
myself 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
remember 1
how 1
i 1
promised 1
prim 1
that 1
i 1
really 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
win 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
a 1
ton 1
of 1
coal 1
has 1
dropped 1
on 1
me 1
well 1
thats 1
that 1
says 1
haymitch 1
then 1
he 1
butters 1
a 1
roll 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
theyll 1
arrest 1
me 1
i 1
ask 1
doubt 1
it 1
be 1
a 1
pain 1
to 1
replace 1
you 1
at 1
this 1
stage 1
says 1
haymitch 1
what 1
about 1
my 1
family 1
i 1
say 1
will 1
they 1
punish 1
them 1
dont 1
think 1
so 1
wouldnt 1
make 1
much 1
sense 1
see 1
theyd 1
have 1
to 1
reveal 1
what 1
happened 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
for 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
worthwhile 1
effect 1
on 1
the 1
population 1
people 1
would 1
need 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
did 1
but 1
they 1
cant 1
since 1
its 1
secret 1
so 1
itd 1
be 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
effort 1
says 1
haymitch 1
more 1
likely 1
theyll 1
make 1
your 1
life 1
hell 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
well 1
theyve 1
already 1
promised 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
to 1
us 1
any 1
way 1
says 1
peeta 1
very 1
true 1
says 1
haymitch 1
and 1
i 1
realize 1
the 1
impossible 1
has 1
happened 1
they 1
have 1
actually 1
cheered 1
me 1
up 1
haymitch 1
picks 1
up 1
a 1
pork 1
chop 1
with 1
his 1
fingers 1
which 1
makes 1
effie 1
frown 1
and 1
dunks 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
wine 1
he 1
rips 1
off 1
a 1
hunk 1
of 1
meat 1
and 1
starts 1
to 1
chuckle 1
what 1
were 1
their 1
faces 1
like 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
tilting 1
up 1
shocked 1
terrified 1
uh 1
ridiculous 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
an 1
image 1
pops 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
one 1
man 1
tripped 1
backward 1
into 1
a 1
bowl 1
of 1
punch 1
haymitch 1
guffaws 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
start 1
laughing 1
except 1
effie 1
although 1
even 1
she 1
is 1
suppressing 1
a 1
smile 1
well 1
it 1
serves 1
them 1
right 1
its 1
their 1
job 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
just 1
because 1
you 1
come 1
from 1
district 1
twelve 1
is 1
no 1
excuse 1
to 1
ignore 1
you 1
then 1
her 1
eyes 1
dart 1
around 1
as 1
if 1
shes 1
said 1
something 1
totally 1
outrageous 1
im 1
sorry 1
but 1
thats 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
she 1
says 1
to 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
particular 1
ill 1
get 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
score 1
i 1
say 1
scores 1
only 1
matter 1
if 1
theyre 1
very 1
good 1
no 1
one 1
pays 1
much 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
bad 1
or 1
mediocre 1
ones 1
for 1
all 1
they 1
know 1
you 1
could 1
be 1
hiding 1
your 1
talents 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
low 1
score 1
on 1
purpose 1
people 1
use 1
that 1
strategy 1
said 1
portia 1
i 1
hope 1
thats 1
how 1
people 1
interpret 1
the 1
four 1
ill 1
probably 1
get 1
says 1
peeta 1
if 1
that 1
really 1
is 1
anything 1
less 1
impressive 1
than 1
watching 1
a 1
person 1
pick 1
up 1
a 1
heavy 1
ball 1
and 1
throw 1
it 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
yards 1
one 1
almost 1
landed 1
on 1
my 1
foot 1
i 1
grin 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
realize 1
that 1
im 1
starving 1
i 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
pork 1
dunk 1
it 1
in 1
mashed 1
potatoes 1
and 1
start 1
eating 1
its 1
okay 1
my 1
family 1
is 1
safe 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
safe 1
no 1
real 1
harm 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
after 1
dinner 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
sitting 1
room 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
scores 1
announced 1
on 1
television 1
first 1
they 1
show 1
a 1
photo 1
of 1
the 1
tribute 1
then 1
flash 1
their 1
score 1
below 1
it 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
naturally 1
get 1
in 1
the 1
eighttoten 1
range 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
players 1
average 1
a 1
five 1
surprisingly 1
little 1
rue 1

with 1
a 1
seven 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1

the 1
judges 1
but 1
shes 1
so 1
tiny 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
impressive 1
district 1
comes 1
up 1
last 1
as 1
usual 1
peeta 1
pulls 1
an 1
eight 1
so 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
watching 1
him 1
i 1
dig 1
my 1
fingernails 1
into 1
my 1
palms 1
as 1
my 1
face 1
comes 1
up 1
expecting 1
the 1
worst 1
then 1
theyre 1
flashing 1
the 1
number 1
eleven 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
eleven 1
effie 1
trinket 1

a 1
squeal 1
and 1
everybody 1

slapping 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
and 1
cheering 1
and 1
congratulating 1
me 1
but 1
it 1
doesnt 1
seem 1
real 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
mistake 1
how 1
how 1
could 1
that 1
happen 1
i 1
ask 1
haymitch 1
guess 1
they 1
liked 1
your 1
temper 1
he 1
says 1
theyve 1
got 1
a 1
show 1
to 1

on 1
they 1

heat 1
katniss 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1

on 1
fire 1
says 1
cinna 1
and 1

me 1
a 1
hug 1

until 1

sort 1
he 1
says 1
mischievously 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
congratulate 1
each 1
other 1
another 1
awkward 1
moment 1
weve 1
both 1
done 1
well 1
but 1
what 1
does 1
that 1
mean 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
escape 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
burrow 1
down 1
under 1
the 1
covers 1
the 1
stress 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
particularly 1
the 1
crying 1
has 1
worn 1
me 1
out 1
i 1
drift 1
off 1
reprieved 1
relieved 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
number 1
eleven 1
still 1
flashing 1
behind 1
my 1
eyelids 1
at 1
dawn 1
i 1
lie 1
in 1
bed 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
watching 1
the 1
sun 1
come 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
beautiful 1
morning 1
its 1
sunday 1
a 1
day 1
off 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
gale 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
yet 1
usually 1
we 1
devote 1
all 1
of 1
sunday 1
to 1
stocking 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
week 1
rising 1
early 1
hunting 1
and 1
gathering 1
then 1
trading 1
at 1
the 1
hob 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
gale 1
without 1
me 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
hunt 1
alone 1
but 1
were 1
better 1
as 1
a 1
pair 1
particularly 1
if 1
were 1
trying 1
for 1
bigger 1
game 1
but 1
also 1
in 1
the 1
littler 1
things 1
having 1
a 1
partner 1
lightened 1
the 1
load 1
could 1
even 1
make 1
the 1
arduous 1
task 1
of 1
filling 1
my 1
familys 1
table 1
enjoyable 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
struggling 1
along 1
on 1
my 1
own 1
for 1
about 1
six 1
months 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
ran 1
into 1
gale 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sunday 1
in 1
october 1
the 1
air 1
cool 1
and 1
pungent 1
with 1
dying 1
things 1
id 1
spent 1
the 1
morning 1
competing 1
with 1
the 1
squirrels 1
for 1
nuts 1
and 1
the 1
slightly 1
warmer 1
afternoon 1
wading 1
in 1
shallow 1
ponds 1
harvesting 1
katniss 1
the 1
only 1
meat 1
id 1
shot 1
was 1
a 1
squirrel 1
that 1
had 1
practically 1
run 1
over 1
my 1
toes 1
in 1
its 1
quest 1
for 1
acorns 1
but 1
the 1
animals 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
afoot 1
when 1
the 1
snow 1
buried 1
my 1
other 1
food 1
sources 1
having 1
strayed 1
farther 1
afield 1
than 1
usual 1
i 1
was 1
hurrying 1
back 1
home 1
lugging 1
my 1
burlap 1
sacks 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
across 1
a 1
dead 1
rabbit 1
it 1
was 1
hanging 1
by 1
its 1
neck 1
in 1
a 1
thin 1
wire 1
a 1
foot 1
above 1
my 1
head 1
about 1
fifteen 1
yards 1
away 1
was 1
another 1
i 1
recognized 1
the 1
twitchup 1
snares 1
because 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
used 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
prey 1
is 1
caught 1
its 1
yanked 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
reach 1
of 1
other 1
hungry 1
animals 1
id 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
use 1
snares 1
all 1
summer 1
with 1
no 1
success 1
so 1
i 1
couldnt 1
help 1
dropping 1
my 1
sacks 1
to 1
examine 1
this 1
one 1
my 1
fingers 1
were 1
just 1
on 1
the 1
wire 1
above 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rabbits 1
when 1
a 1
voice 1
rang 1
out 1
thats 1
dangerous 1
i 1
jumped 1
back 1
several 1
feet 1
as 1
gale 1
materialized 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
tree 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
watching 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
fourteen 1
but 1
he 1
cleared 1
six 1
feet 1
and 1
was 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
an 1
adult 1
to 1
me 1
id 1
seen 1
him 1
around 1
the 1
seam 1
and 1
at 1
school 1
and 1
one 1
other 1
time 1
hed 1
lost 1
his 1
father 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
blast 1
that 1
killed 1
mine 1
in 1
january 1
id 1
stood 1
by 1
while 1
he 1
received 1
his 1
medal 1
of 1
valor 1
in 1
the 1
justice 1
building 1
another 1
oldest 1
child 1
with 1
no 1
father 1
i 1
remembered 1
his 1
two 1
little 1
brothers 1
clutching 1
his 1
mother 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
swollen 1
belly 1
announced 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
days 1
away 1
from 1
giving 1
birth 1
whats 1
your 1
name 1
he 1
said 1
coming 1
over 1
and 1
disengaging 1
the 1
rabbit 1
from 1
the 1
snare 1
he 1
had 1
another 1
three 1
hanging 1
from 1
his 1
belt 1
katniss 1
i 1
said 1
barely 1
audible 1
well 1
catnip 1
stealings 1
punishable 1
by 1
death 1
or 1
hadnt 1
you 1
heard 1
he 1
said 1
katniss 1
i 1
said 1
louder 1
and 1
i 1
wasnt 1
stealing 1
it 1
i 1
just 1
wanted 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
snare 1
mine 1
never 1
catch 1
anything 1
he 1
scowled 1
at 1
me 1
not 1
convinced 1
so 1
whered 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
squirrel 1
i 1
shot 1
it 1
i 1
pulled 1
my 1
bow 1
off 1
my 1
shoulder 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
using 1
the 1
small 1
version 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
but 1
id 1
been 1
practicing 1
with 1
the 1
fullsize 1
one 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
i 1
was 1
hoping 1
that 1
by 1
spring 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
bring 1
down 1
some 1
bigger 1
game 1
gales 1
eyes 1
fastened 1
on 1
the 1
bow 1
can 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
handed 1
it 1
over 1
just 1
remember 1
stealings 1
punishable 1
by 1
death 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
him 1
smile 1
it 1
transformed 1
him 1
from 1
someone 1
menacing 1
to 1
someone 1
you 1
wished 1
you 1
knew 1
but 1
it 1
took 1
several 1
months 1
before 1
i 1
returned 1
that 1
smile 1
we 1
talked 1
hunting 1
then 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
a 1
bow 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
trade 1
not 1
food 1
i 1
wanted 1
knowledge 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
set 1
my 1
own 1
snares 1
that 1
caught 1
a 1
belt 1
of 1
fat 1
rabbits 1
in 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
agreed 1
something 1
might 1
be 1
worked 1
out 1
as 1
the 1
seasons 1
went 1
by 1
we 1
grudgingly 1
began 1
to 1
share 1
our 1
knowledge 1
our 1
weapons 1
our 1
secret 1
places 1
that 1
were 1
thick 1
with 1
wild 1
plums 1
or 1
turkeys 1
he 1
taught 1
me 1
snares 1
and 1
fishing 1
i 1
showed 1
him 1
what 1
plants 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
eventually 1
gave 1
him 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
precious 1
bows 1
and 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
without 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
saying 1
it 1
we 1
became 1
a 1
team 1
dividing 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
the 1
spoils 1
making 1
sure 1
that 1
both 1
our 1
families 1
had 1
food 1
gale 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
id 1
lacked 1
since 1
my 1
fathers 1
death 1
his 1
companionship 1
replaced 1
the 1
long 1
solitary 1
hours 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
became 1
a 1
much 1
better 1
hunter 1
when 1
i 1
didnt 1
have 1
to 1
look 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
constantly 1
when 1
someone 1
was 1
watching 1
my 1
back 1
but 1
he 1
turned 1
into 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
hunting 1
partner 1
he 1
became 1
my 1
confidante 1
someone 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
could 1
share 1
thoughts 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
voice 1
inside 1
the 1
fence 1
in 1
exchange 1
he 1
trusted 1
me 1
with 1
his 1
being 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
with 1
gale 1
sometimes 1
i 1
was 1
actually 1
happy 1
i 1
call 1
him 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
year 1
its 1
seemed 1
too 1
casual 1
a 1
word 1
for 1
what 1
gale 1
is 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
pang 1
of 1
longing 1
shoots 1
through 1
my 1
chest 1
if 1
only 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
now 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
where 1
hed 1
be 1
dead 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
i 1
just 1
i 1
just 1
miss 1
him 1
and 1
i 1
hate 1
being 1
so 1
alone 1
does 1
he 1
miss 1
me 1
he 1
must 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
eleven 1
flashing 1
under 1
my 1
name 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
know 1
exactly 1
what 1
hed 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
well 1
theres 1
some 1
room 1
for 1
improvement 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
hed 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
smile 1
and 1
id 1
return 1
it 1
without 1
hesitating 1
now 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
comparing 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
with 1
gale 1
to 1
what 1
im 1
pretending 1
to 1
have 1
with 1
peeta 1
how 1
i 1
never 1
question 1
gales 1
motives 1
while 1
i 1
do 1
nothing 1
but 1
doubt 1
the 1
latters 1
its 1
not 1
a 1
fair 1
comparison 1
really 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
thrown 1
together 1
by 1
a 1
mutual 1
need 1
to 1
survive 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
others 1
survival 1
means 1
our 1
own 1
death 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
sidestep 1
that 1
effies 1
knocking 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
reminding 1
me 1
theres 1
another 1
big 1
big 1
big 1
day 1
ahead 1
tomorrow 1
night 1
will 1
be 1
our 1
televised 1
interviews 1
i 1
guess 1
the 1
whole 1
team 1
will 1
have 1
their 1
hands 1
full 1
readying 1
us 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
quick 1
shower 1
being 1
a 1
bit 1
more 1
careful 1
about 1
the 1
buttons 1
i 1
hit 1
and 1
head 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
peeta 1
effie 1
and 1
haymitch 1
are 1
huddled 1
around 1
the 1
table 1
talking 1
in 1
hushed 1
voices 1
that 1
seems 1
odd 1
but 1
hunger 1
wins 1
out 1
over 1
curiosity 1
and 1
i 1
load 1
up 1
my 1
plate 1
with 1
breakfast 1
before 1
i 1
join 1
them 1
the 1
stews 1
made 1
with 1
tender 1
chunks 1
of 1
lamb 1
and 1
dried 1
plums 1
today 1
perfect 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
of 1
wild 1
rice 1
ive 1
shoveled 1
about 1
halfway 1
through 1
the 1
mound 1
when 1
i 1
realize 1
no 1
ones 1
talking 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
big 1
gulp 1
of 1
orange 1
juice 1
and 1
wipe 1
my 1
mouth 1
so 1
whats 1
going 1
on 1
youre 1
coaching 1
us 1
on 1
interviews 1
today 1
right 1
thats 1
right 1
says 1
haymitch 1
you 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
im 1
done 1
i 1
can 1
listen 1
and 1
cat 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
i 1
say 1
well 1
theres 1
been 1
a 1
change 1
of 1
plans 1
about 1
our 1
current 1
approach 1
says 1
haymitch 1
whats 1
that 1
i 1
ask 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
what 1
our 1
current 1
approach 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
appear 1
mediocre 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
bit 1
of 1
strategy 1
i 1
remember 1
haymitch 1
shrugs 1
peeta 1
has 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
coached 1
separately 1
betrayal 1
thats 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
i 1
feel 1
which 1
is 1
ludicrous 1
for 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
betrayal 1
there 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
been 1
trust 1
first 1
between 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
and 1
trust 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
agreement 1
were 1
tributes 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
risked 1
a 1
beating 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
bread 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
steadied 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
chariot 1
who 1
covered 1
for 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
who 1
insisted 1
haymitch 1
know 1
my 1
hunting 1
skills 1
was 1
there 1
some 1
part 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
couldnt 1
help 1
trusting 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
im 1
relieved 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
stop 1
the 1
pretense 1
of 1
being 1
friends 1
obviously 1
whatever 1
thin 1
connection 1
wed 1
foolishly 1
formed 1
has 1
been 1
severed 1
and 1
high 1
time 1
too 1
the 1
games 1
begin 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
and 1
trust 1
will 1
only 1
be 1
a 1
weakness 1
whatever 1
triggered 1
peetas 1
decision 1
and 1
i 1
suspect 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
outperforming 1
him 1
in 1
training 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
nothing 1
but 1
grateful 1
for 1
it 1
maybe 1
hes 1
finally 1
accepted 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
sooner 1
we 1
openly 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
enemies 1
the 1
better 1
good 1
i 1
say 1
so 1
whats 1
the 1
schedule 1
youll 1
each 1
have 1
four 1
hours 1
with 1
effie 1
for 1
presentation 1
and 1
four 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
content 1
says 1
haymitch 1
you 1
start 1
with 1
effie 1
katniss 1
i 1
cant 1
imagine 1
what 1
effie 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
teach 1
me 1
that 1
could 1
take 1
four 1
hours 1
but 1
shes 1
got 1
me 1
working 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
minute 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
rooms 1
and 1
she 1
puts 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
fulllength 1
gown 1
and 1
highheeled 1
shoes 1
not 1
the 1
ones 1
ill 1
he 1
wearing 1
for 1
the 1
actual 1
interview 1
and 1
instructs 1
me 1
on 1
walking 1
the 1
shoes 1
are 1
the 1
worst 1
part 1
ive 1
never 1
worn 1
high 1
heels 1
and 1
cant 1
get 1
used 1
to 1
essentially 1
wobbling 1
around 1
on 1
the 1
balls 1
of 1
my 1
feet 1
but 1
effie 1
runs 1
around 1
in 1
them 1
fulltime 1
and 1
im 1
determined 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
can 1
i 1
the 1
dress 1
poses 1
anotherproblem 1
it 1
keeps 1
tangling 1
around 1
my 1
shoes 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
hitch 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
then 1
effie 1
swoops 1
down 1
on 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
hawk 1
smacking 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
yelling 1
not 1
above 1
the 1
ankle 1
when 1
i 1
finally 1
conquer 1
walking 1
theres 1
still 1
sitting 1
posture 1
apparently 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
duck 1
my 1
head 1
eye 1
contact 1
hand 1
gestures 1
and 1
smiling 1
smiling 1
is 1
mostly 1
about 1
smiling 1
more 1
effie 1
makes 1
me 1
say 1
a 1
hundred 1
banal 1
phrases 1
starting 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
while 1
smiling 1
or 1
ending 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
by 1
lunch 1
the 1
muscles 1
in 1
my 1
cheeks 1
are 1
twitching 1
from 1
overuse 1
well 1
thats 1
the 1
best 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
effie 1
says 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
just 1
remember 1
katniss 1
you 1
want 1
the 1
audience 1
to 1
like 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
they 1
will 1
i 1
ask 1
not 1
if 1
you 1
glare 1
at 1
them 1
the 1
entire 1
time 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
save 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
arena 1
instead 1
think 1
of 1
yourself 1
among 1
friends 1
says 1
effie 1
theyre 1
betting 1
on 1
how 1
long 1
ill 1
live 1
i 1
burst 1
out 1
theyre 1
not 1
my 1
friends 1
well 1
try 1
and 1
pretend 1
snaps 1
effie 1
then 1
she 1
composes 1
herself 1
and 1
beams 1
at 1
me 1
see 1
like 1
this 1
im 1
smiling 1
at 1
you 1
even 1
though 1
youre 1
aggravating 1
me 1
yes 1
it 1
feels 1
very 1
convincing 1
i 1
say 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
eat 1
kick 1
off 1
my 1
heels 1
and 1
stomp 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
hiking 1
my 1
skirt 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
thighs 1
peeta 1
and 1
haymitch 1
seem 1
in 1
pretty 1
good 1
moods 1
so 1
im 1
thinking 1
the 1
content 1
session 1
should 1
be 1
an 1
improvement 1
over 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
couldnt 1
be 1
more 1
wrong 1
after 1
lunch 1
haymitch 1
takes 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
directs 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
then 1
just 1
frowns 1
at 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
what 1
i 1
finally 1
ask 1
im 1
trying 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
says 1
how 1

going 1
to 1

charming 1
aloof 1
fierce 1

fury 1
seems 1
to 1

to 1
the 1
surface 1
until 1
im 1
literally 1
spitting 1
out 1

at 1
him 1
all 1

no 1
sense 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
your 1

dead 1
slug 1
says 1
haymitch 1
ouch 1
that 1
hurts 1
even 1
haymitch 1
must 1
know 1
hes 1
been 1
too 1
harsh 1
because 1
his 1
voice 1
softens 1
heres 1
an 1
idea 1
try 1
acting 1
humble 1
humble 1
i 1
echo 1
that 1
you 1
cant 1
believe 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
twelve 1
has 1
done 1
this 1
well 1
the 1
whole 1
things 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
ever 1
could 1
have 1
dreamed 1
of 1
talk 1
about 1
cinnas 1
clothes 1
how 1
nice 1
the 1
people 1
are 1
how 1
the 1
city 1
amazes 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
wont 1
talk 1
about 1
yourself 1
at 1
least 1
compliment 1
the 1
audience 1
just 1
keep 1
turning 1
it 1
back 1
around 1
all 1
right 1
gush 1
the 1
next 1
hours 1
are 1
agonizing 1
at 1
once 1
its 1
clear 1
i 1
cannot 1
gush 1
we 1
try 1
me 1
playing 1
cocky 1
but 1
i 1
just 1
dont 1
have 1
the 1
arrogance 1
apparently 1
im 1
too 1
vulnerable 1
for 1
ferocity 1
im 1
not 1
witty 1
funny 1
sexy 1
or 1
mysterious 1
by 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
session 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
one 1
at 1
all 1
haymitch 1
started 1
drinking 1
somewhere 1
around 1
witty 1
and 1
a 1
nasty 1
edge 1
has 1
crept 1
into 1
his 1
voice 1
i 1
give 1
up 1
sweetheart 1
just 1
answer 1
the 1
questions 1
and 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
audience 1
see 1
how 1
openly 1
you 1
despise 1
them 1
i 1
have 1
dinner 1
that 1
night 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
ordering 1
an 1
outrageous 1
number 1
of 1
delicacies 1
eating 1
myself 1
sick 1
and 1
then 1
taking 1
out 1
my 1
anger 1
at 1
haymitch 1
at 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
at 1
every 1
living 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
by 1
smashing 1
dishes 1
around 1
my 1
room 1
when 1
the 1
girl 1
with 1
the 1
red 1
hair 1
comes 1
in 1
to 1
turn 1
down 1
my 1
bed 1
her 1
eyes 1
widen 1
at 1
the 1
mess 1
just 1
leave 1
it 1
i 1
yell 1
at 1
her 1
just 1
leave 1
it 1
alone 1
i 1
hate 1
her 1
too 1
with 1
her 1
knowing 1
reproachful 1
eyes 1
that 1
call 1
me 1
a 1
coward 1
a 1
monster 1
a 1
puppet 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
both 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
her 1
justice 1
must 1
finally 1
be 1
happening 1
at 1
least 1
my 1
death 1
will 1
help 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
fleeing 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
girl 1
closes 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
her 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
bathroom 1
she 1
comes 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
damp 1
cloth 1
and 1
wipes 1
my 1
face 1
gently 1
then 1
cleans 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
a 1
broken 1
plate 1
off 1
my 1
hands 1
why 1
is 1
she 1
doing 1
this 1
why 1
am 1
i 1
letting 1
her 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
tried 1
to 1
save 1
you 1
i 1
whisper 1
she 1
shakes 1
her 1
head 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
we 1
were 1
right 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
forgiven 1
me 1
no 1
it 1
was 1
wrong 1
i 1
say 1
she 1
taps 1
her 1
lips 1
with 1
her 1
fingers 1
then 1
points 1
to 1
my 1
chest 1
i 1
think 1
she 1
means 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
just 1
have 1
ended 1
up 1
an 1
avox 1
too 1
probably 1
would 1
have 1
an 1
avox 1
or 1
dead 1
i 1
spend 1
the 1
next 1
hour 1
helping 1
the 1
redheaded 1
girl 1
clean 1
the 1
room 1
when 1
all 1
the 1
garbage 1
has 1
been 1
dropped 1
down 1
a 1
disposal 1
and 1
the 1
food 1
cleaned 1
away 1
she 1
turns 1
down 1
my 1
bed 1
i 1
crawl 1
in 1
between 1
the 1
sheets 1
like 1
a 1
fiveyearold 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
tuck 1
me 1
in 1
then 1
she 1
goes 1
i 1
want 1
her 1
to 1
stay 1
until 1
i 1
fall 1
asleep 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
when 1
i 1
wake 1
up 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
this 1
girl 1
even 1
though 1
she 1
never 1
had 1
mine 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
its 1
not 1
the 1
girl 1
but 1
my 1
prep 1
team 1
who 1
are 1
hanging 1
over 1
me 1
my 1
lessons 1
with 1
effie 1
and 1
haymitch 1
are 1
over 1
this 1
day 1
belongs 1
to 1
cinna 1
hes 1
my 1
last 1
hope 1
maybe 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
me 1
look 1
so 1
wonderful 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
care 1
what 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
the 1
team 1
works 1
on 1
me 1
until 1
late 1
afternoon 1
turning 1
my 1
skin 1
to 1
glowing 1
satin 1
stenciling 1
patterns 1
on 1
my 1
arms 1
painting 1
flame 1
designs 1
on 1
my 1
twenty 1
perfect 1
nails 1
then 1
venia 1
goes 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
my 1
hair 1
weaving 1
strands 1
of 1
red 1
into 1
a 1
pattern 1
that 1
begins 1
at 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
wraps 1
around 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
falls 1
in 1
one 1
braid 1
down 1
my 1
right 1
shoulder 1
they 1
erase 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
pale 1
makeup 1
and 1
draw 1
my 1
features 1
back 1
out 1
huge 1
dark 1
eyes 1
full 1
red 1
lips 1
lashes 1
that 1
throw 1
off 1
bits 1
of 1
light 1
when 1
i 1
blink 1
finally 1
they 1
cover 1
my 1
entire 1
body 1
in 1
a 1
powder 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
shimmer 1
in 1
gold 1
dust 1
then 1
cinna 1
enters 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
assume 1
is 1
my 1
dress 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
really 1
see 1
it 1
because 1
its 1
covered 1
close 1
your 1
eyes 1
he 1
orders 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
silken 1
inside 1
as 1
they 1
slip 1
it 1
down 1
over 1
my 1
naked 1
body 1
then 1
the 1
weight 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
forty 1
pounds 1
i 1
clutch 1
octavias 1
hand 1
as 1
i 1
blindly 1
step 1
into 1
my 1
shoes 1
glad 1
to 1
find 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
least 1
two 1
inches 1
lower 1
than 1
the 1
pair 1
effie 1
had 1
me 1
practice 1
in 1
theres 1
some 1
adjusting 1
and 1
fidgeting 1
then 1
silence 1
can 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
ask 1
yes 1
says 1
cinna 1
open 1
them 1
the 1
creature 1
standing 1
before 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
fulllength 1
mirror 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
another 1
world 1
where 1
skin 1
shimmers 1
and 1
eyes 1
flash 1
and 1
apparently 1
they 1
make 1
their 1
clothes 1
from 1
jewels 1
because 1
my 1
dress 1
oh 1
my 1
dress 1
is 1
entirely 1
covered 1
in 1
reflective 1
precious 1
gems 1
red 1
and 1
yellow 1
and 1
white 1
with 1
bits 1
of 1
blue 1
that 1
accent 1
the 1
tips 1
of 1
the 1
flame 1
design 1
the 1
slightest 1
movement 1
gives 1
the 1
impression 1
i 1
am 1
engulfed 1
in 1
tongues 1
of 1
fire 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
pretty 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
beautiful 1
i 1
am 1
as 1
radiant 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
we 1
all 1
just 1
stare 1
at 1
me 1
oh 1
cinna 1
i 1
finally 1
whisper 1
thank 1
you 1
twirl 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
hold 1
out 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
spin 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
screams 1
in 1
admiration 1
cinna 1
dismisses 1
the 1
team 1
and 1
has 1
me 1
move 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
dress 1
and 1
shoes 1
which 1
are 1
infinitely 1
more 1
manageable 1
than 1
effies 1
the 1
dress 1
hangs 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
lift 1
the 1
skirt 1
when 1
i 1
walk 1
leaving 1
me 1
with 1
one 1
less 1
thing 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
so 1
all 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
interview 1
then 1
asks 1
cinna 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
expression 1
that 1
hes 1
been 1
talking 1
to 1
haymitch 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
how 1
dreadful 1
i 1
am 1
im 1
awful 1
haymitch 1
called 1
me 1
a 1
dead 1
slug 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
we 1
tried 1
i 1
couldnt 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
just 1
cant 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
people 1
he 1
wants 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
i 1
say 1
cinna 1
thinks 1
about 1
this 1
a 1
moment 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
just 1
be 1
yourself 1
myself 1
thats 1
no 1
good 1
either 1
haymitch 1
says 1
im 1
sullen 1
and 1
hostile 1
i 1
say 1
well 1
you 1
are 1
around 1
haymitch 1
says 1
cinna 1
with 1
a 1
grin 1
i 1
dont 1
find 1
you 1
so 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
adores 1
you 1
you 1
even 1
won 1
over 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
well 1
they 1
cant 1
stop 1
talking 1
about 1
you 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
help 1
but 1
admire 1
your 1
spirit 1
my 1
spirit 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
new 1
thought 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
exactly 1
what 1
it 1
means 1
but 1
it 1
suggests 1
im 1
a 1
fighter 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
brave 1
way 1
its 1
not 1
as 1
if 1
im 1
never 1
friendly 1
okay 1
maybe 1
i 1
dont 1
go 1
around 1
loving 1
everybody 1
i 1
meet 1
maybe 1
my 1
smiles 1
are 1
hard 1
to 1
come 1
by 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
care 1
for 1
some 1
people 1
cinna 1
takes 1
my 1
icy 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
warm 1
ones 1
suppose 1
when 1
you 1
answer 1
the 1
questions 1
you 1
think 1
youre 1
addressing 1
a 1
friend 1

home 1
who 1
would 1
your 1
best 1
friend 1
be 1
asks 1
cinna 1
gale 1
i 1
say 1
instantly 1
only 1
it 1
doesnt 1
make 1
sense 1
cinna 1
i 1
would 1
never 1
be 1
telling 1
gale 1
those 1
things 1
about 1
me 1
he 1
already 1
knows 1
them 1
what 1
about 1
me 1
could 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
friend 1
asks 1
cinna 1
of 1
all 1
the 1

me 1
when 1
youre 1
asked 1
a 1
question 1
find 1
me 1
and 1
answer 1
it 1
as 1
honestly 1
as 1
possible 1
says 1
cinna 1
even 1
if 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
is 1
horrible 1
i 1
ask 1
because 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
really 1
especially 1
if 1
what 1
you 1
think 1
is 1
horrible 1
says 1
cinna 1
youll 1
try 1
it 1
i 1
nod 1
its 1
a 1
plan 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
straw 1
to 1
grasp 1
at 1
too 1
soon 1
its 1
time 1
to 1
go 1
the 1
interviews 1
take 1
place 1
on 1
a 1
stage 1
constructed 1
in 1
front 1
of 1

training 1
center 1
once 1
i 1
leave 1
my 1
room 1

in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
the 1
cameras 1
all 1
of 1
panem 1
as 1

doorknob 1
i 1
stop 1
his 1
hand 1
cinna 1
im 1
completely 1
overcome 1
with 1
stage 1
fright 1
remember 1

you 1
he 1
says 1
gently 1
just 1

up 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1

in 1
a 1
black 1
suit 1
with 1
flame 1
accents 1
while 1
we 1
look 1
well 1
together 1
its 1
a 1
relief 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
dressed 1
identically 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
are 1
all 1
fancied 1

avoid 1
haymitch 1
but 1
accept 1
effies 1
compliments 1
effie 1
can 1
be 1
tiresome 1
and 1
clueless 1
but 1
shes 1
not 1
destructive 1
like 1
haymitch 1
when 1
the 1
elevator 1
opens 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
are 1
being 1
lined 1
up 1

arc 1
throughout 1
the 1
interviews 1
ill 1
be 1
last 1
or 1
second 1
to 1
last 1
since 1
the 1
girl 1
tribute 1
precedes 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
each 1
district 1
how 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
first 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
now 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
how 1
witty 1
funny 1
humble 1
fierce 1
and 1
charming 1
everybody 1
else 1
is 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
up 1
plus 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
start 1
to 1
get 1
bored 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
did 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
exactly 1
shoot 1
an 1
arrow 1
into 1
the 1
crowd 1
to 1
get 1
their 1
attention 1
right 1
before 1
we 1
parade 1
onto 1
the 1
stage 1
haymitch 1
comes 1
up 1
behind 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
and 1
growls 1
remember 1

still 1
a 1
happy 1
pair 1

thought 1
we 1
abandoned 1
that 1
when 1
peeta 1
asked 1
for 1
separate 1
coaching 1
but 1
i 1
guess 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
private 1
not 1
a 1
public 1
thing 1
anyway 1
theres 1
not 1
much 1
chance 1
for 1
interaction 1
now 1
as 1
we 1
walk 1
singlefile 1
to 1
our 1
seats 1
and 1
take 1
our 1
places 1
just 1
stepping 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
makes 1
my 1
breathing 1
rapid 1
and 1
shallow 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
my 1
pulse 1
pounding 1
in 1
my 1
temples 1
its 1
a 1
relief 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
my 1
chair 1
because 1
between 1
the 1
heels 1
and 1
my 1
legs 1
shaking 1
im 1
afraid 1
ill 1
trip 1
although 1
evening 1
is 1
falling 1
the 1
city 1
circle 1
is 1
brighter 1
than 1
a 1
summers 1
day 1
an 1
elevated 1
seating 1
unit 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
up 1
for 1
prestigious 1
guests 1
with 1
the 1
stylists 1
commanding 1
the 1
front 1
row 1
the 1
cameras 1
will 1
turn 1
to 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
crowd 1
is 1
reacting 1
to 1
their 1
handiwork 1
a 1
large 1
balcony 1
off 1
a 1
building 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
has 1
been 1
reserved 1
for 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
television 1
crews 1
have 1
claimed 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
balconies 1
but 1
the 1
city 1
circle 1
and 1
the 1
avenues 1
that 1
feed 1
into 1
it 1
are 1
completely 1
packed 1
with 1
people 1
standing 1
room 1
only 1
at 1
homes 1
and 1
community 1
halls 1
around 1
the 1
country 1
every 1
television 1
set 1
is 1
turned 1
on 1
every 1
citizen 1
of 1
panem 1
is 1
tuned 1
in 1
there 1

no 1

tonight 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
hosted 1
the 1
interviews 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
forty 1
years 1
bounces 1
onto 1
the 1
stage 1
its 1
a 1
little 1
scary 1
because 1
his 1
appearance 1
has 1
been 1
virtually 1
unchanged 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
same 1
face 1
under 1
a 1
coating 1
of 1
pure 1
white 1
makeup 1
same 1
hairstyle 1
that 1
he 1
dyes 1
a 1
different 1
color 1
for 1
each 1
hunger 1
games 1
same 1
ceremonial 1
suit 1
midnight 1
blue 1
dotted 1
with 1
a 1
thousand 1
tiny 1
electric 1
bulbs 1
that 1
twinkle 1
like 1
stars 1
they 1
do 1
surgery 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
to 1
make 1
people 1
appear 1
younger 1
and 1
thinner 1
in 1
district 1
looking 1
old 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
an 1
achievement 1
since 1
so 1
many 1
people 1
die 1
early 1
you 1
see 1
an 1
elderly 1
person 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
congratulate 1
them 1
on 1
their 1
longevity 1
ask 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
survival 1
a 1
plump 1
person 1
is 1
envied 1
because 1
they 1
arent 1
scraping 1
by 1
like 1
the 1
majority 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
different 1
wrinkles 1
arent 1
desirable 1
a 1
round 1
belly 1
isnt 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
success 1
this 1
year 1
caesars 1
hair 1
is 1
powder 1
blue 1
and 1
his 1
eyelids 1
and 1
lips 1
are 1
coated 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
hue 1
he 1
looks 1
freakish 1
but 1
less 1
frightening 1
than 1
he 1
did 1
last 1
year 1
when 1
his 1
color 1
was 1
crimson 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
bleeding 1
caesar 1
tells 1
a 1
few 1
jokes 1
to 1
warm 1
up 1
the 1
audience 1
but 1
then 1
gets 1
down 1
to 1
business 1
the 1
girl 1
tribute 1
from 1
district 1
looking 1
provocative 1
in 1
a 1
seethrough 1
gold 1
gown 1

up 1
the 1
center 1
of 1
the 1
stage 1
to 1
join 1
caesar 1

her 1
interview 1

mentor 1

have 1
any 1
trouble 1
coming 1
up 1
with 1
an 1
angle 1
for 1
her 1
with 1
that 1
flowing 1
blonde 1
hair 1
emerald 1
green 1
eyes 1
her 1
body 1
tall 1
and 1
lush 1
shes 1
sexy 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
each 1
interview 1
only 1
lasts 1
three 1
minutes 1
then 1
a 1
buzzer 1
goes 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
tribute 1
is 1
up 1
ill 1
say 1
this 1
for 1
caesar 1
he 1
really 1
does 1
his 1
best 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
tributes 1
shine 1
hes 1
friendly 1
tries 1
to 1
set 1
the 1
nervous 1
ones 1
at 1
ease 1
laughs 1
at 1
lame 1
jokes 1
and 1
can 1
turn 1
a 1
weak 1
response 1
into 1
a 1
memorable 1
one 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
reacts 1
i 1
sit 1
like 1
a 1
lady 1
the 1
way 1
effie 1
showed 1
me 1
as 1
the 1
districts 1
slip 1
by 1
everyone 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
playing 1
up 1
some 1
angle 1
the 1
monstrous 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
is 1
a 1
ruthless 1
killing 1
machine 1
the 1
foxfaced 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
sly 1
and 1
elusive 1
i 1
spotted 1
cinna 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
but 1
even 1
his 1
presence 1
cannot 1
relax 1
me 1
the 1
crippled 1
boy 1
from 1
is 1
very 1
quiet 1
my 1
palms 1
are 1
sweating 1
like 1
crazy 1
but 1
the 1
jeweled 1
dress 1
isnt 1
absorbent 1
and 1
they 1
skid 1
right 1
of 1
if 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
dry 1
them 1
rue 1
who 1
is 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
gossamer 1
gown 1
complete 1
with 1
wings 1
flutters 1
her 1
way 1
to 1
caesar 1
a 1
hush 1
falls 1
over 1
the 1
crowd 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
magical 1
wisp 1
of 1
a 1
tribute 1
caesars 1
very 1
sweet 1
with 1
her 1
complimenting 1
her 1
seven 1
in 1
training 1
an 1
excellent 1
score 1
for 1
one 1
so 1
small 1
when 1
he 1
asks 1
her 1
what 1
her 1
greatest 1
strength 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
will 1
be 1
she 1
doesnt 1
hesitate 1
im 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
catch 1
she 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
tremulous 1
voice 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
cant 1
catch 1
me 1
they 1
cant 1
kill 1
me 1
so 1
dont 1
count 1
me 1
out 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
in 1
a 1
million 1
years 1
says 1
caesar 1
encouragingly 1
the 1
boy 1
tribute 1
from 1
district 1
thresh 1
has 1
the 1
same 1
dark 1
skin 1
as 1
rue 1
but 1
the 1
resemblance 1
stops 1
there 1
hes 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
giants 1
probably 1
six 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
feet 1
tall 1
and 1
built 1
like 1
an 1
ox 1
but 1
i 1
noticed 1
he 1
rejected 1
the 1
invitations 1
from 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
to 1
join 1
their 1
crowd 1
instead 1
hes 1
been 1
very 1
solitary 1
speaking 1
to 1
no 1
one 1
showing 1
little 1
interest 1
in 1
training 1
even 1
so 1
he 1
scored 1
a 1
ten 1
and 1
its 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
imagine 1
he 1
impressed 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
he 1
ignores 1
caesars 1
attempts 1
at 1
banter 1
and 1
answers 1
with 1
a 1
yes 1
or 1
no 1
or 1
just 1
remains 1
silent 1
if 1
only 1
i 1
was 1
his 1
size 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
sullen 1
and 1
hostile 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
just 1
fine 1
i 1
bet 1
half 1
the 1
sponsors 1
are 1
at 1
least 1
considering 1
him 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
any 1
money 1
id 1
bet 1
on 1
him 1
myself 1
and 1
then 1
theyre 1
calling 1
katniss 1
everdeen 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
myself 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
standing 1
and 1
making 1
my 1
way 1
center 1
stage 1
i 1
shake 1
caesars 1
outstretched 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
good 1
grace 1
not 1
to 1
immediately 1
wipe 1
his 1
off 1
on 1
his 1
suit 1
so 1
katniss 1
the 1
capitol 1
must 1
be 1
quite 1
a 1
change 1
from 1
district 1
twelve 1
whats 1
impressed 1
you 1
most 1
since 1
you 1
arrived 1
here 1
asks 1
caesar 1
what 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
words 1
make 1
no 1
sense 1
my 1
mouth 1
has 1
gone 1
as 1
dry 1
as 1
sawdust 1
i 1
desperately 1
find 1
cinna 1
in 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
lock 1
eyes 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
imagine 1
the 1
words 1
coming 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
whats 1
impressed 1
you 1
most 1
since 1
you 1
arrived 1
here 1
i 1
rack 1
my 1
brain 1
for 1
something 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
happy 1
here 1
be 1
honest 1
i 1
think 1
be 1
honest 1
the 1
lamb 1
stew 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
caesar 1
laughs 1
and 1
vaguely 1
i 1
realize 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
audience 1
has 1
joined 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
dried 1
plums 1
asks 1
caesar 1
i 1
nod 1
oh 1
i 1
eat 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
bucketful 1
he 1
turns 1
sideways 1
to 1
the 1
audience 1
in 1
horror 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
stomach 1
it 1
doesnt 1
show 1
does 1
it 1
they 1
shout 1
reassurances 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
applaud 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
mean 1
about 1
caesar 1
he 1
tries 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
out 1
now 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
confidentially 1
when 1
you 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
opening 1
ceremonies 1
my 1
heart 1
actually 1
stopped 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
costume 1
cinna 1
raises 1
one 1
eyebrow 1
at 1
me 1
be 1
honest 1
you 1
mean 1
after 1
i 1
got 1
over 1
my 1
fear 1
of 1
being 1
burned 1
alive 1
i 1
ask 1
big 1
laugh 1
a 1
real 1
one 1
from 1
the 1
audience 1
yes 1
start 1
then 1
says 1
caesar 1
cinna 1
my 1
friend 1
i 1
should 1
tell 1
him 1
anyway 1
i 1
thought 1
cinna 1
was 1
brilliant 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
gorgeous 1
costume 1
id 1
ever 1
seen 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
believe 1
i 1
was 1
wearing 1
it 1
i 1
cant 1
believe 1
im 1
wearing 1
this 1
either 1
i 1
lift 1
up 1
my 1
skirt 1
to 1
spread 1
it 1
out 1
i 1
mean 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
audience 1
oohs 1
and 1
ahs 1
i 1
see 1
cinna 1
make 1
the 1
tiniest 1
circular 1
motion 1
with 1
his 1
finger 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
hes 1
saying 1
twirl 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
spin 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
once 1
and 1
the 1
reaction 1
is 1
immediate 1
oh 1
do 1
that 1
again 1
says 1
caesar 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
lift 1
up 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
spin 1
around 1
and 1
around 1
letting 1
the 1
skirt 1
fly 1
out 1
letting 1
the 1
dress 1
engulf 1
me 1
in 1
flames 1
the 1
audience 1
breaks 1
into 1
cheers 1
when 1
i 1
stop 1
i 1
clutch 1
caesars 1
arm 1
dont 1
stop 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
im 1
dizzy 1
im 1
also 1
giggling 1
which 1
i 1
think 1
ive 1
done 1
maybe 1
never 1
in 1
my 1
lifetime 1
but 1
the 1
nerves 1
and 1
the 1
spinning 1
have 1
gotten 1
to 1
me 1
caesar 1
wraps 1
a 1
protective 1
arm 1
around 1
me 1
dont 1
worry 1
ive 1
got 1
you 1
cant 1
have 1
you 1
following 1
in 1
your 1
mentors 1

everyones 1
hooting 1
as 1

cameras 1

by 1
now 1
famous 1
for 1
his 1
head 1

at 1
the 1
reaping 1
and 1
he 1
waves 1
them 1
away 1
goodnaturedly 1
and 1
points 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
its 1
all 1
right 1
caesar 1

the 1

has 1
a 1
girlfriend 1

moment 1

on 1

downcast 1
eyes 1
as 1
what 1
he 1
says 1

in 1
then 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
my 1
face 1
mouth 1
half 1
open 1
in 1
a 1
mix 1
of 1
surprise 1
and 1
protest 1
magnified 1
on 1
every 1
screen 1
as 1

means 1
me 1
i 1
press 1
my 1
lips 1
together 1
and 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
floor 1
hoping 1
this 1
will 1
conceal 1
the 1
emotions 1
starting 1
to 1
boil 1
up 1
inside 1
of 1
me 1
oh 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
bad 1
luck 1
says 1
caesar 1
and 1
theres 1
a 1
real 1
edge 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
the 1
crowd 1
is 1
murmuring 1
in 1
agreement 1
a 1
few 1
have 1
even 1
given 1
agonized 1
cries 1
its 1
not 1
good 1
agrees 1
peeta 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
blame 1
you 1
itd 1
be 1
hard 1
not 1
to 1
fall 1
for 1
that 1
young 1
lady 1
says 1
caesar 1
she 1
didnt 1
know 1
peeta 1
shakes 1
his 1
head 1
not 1
until 1
now 1
i 1
allow 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
flicker 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
screen 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
blush 1
on 1
my 1
cheeks 1
is 1
unmistakable 1
wouldnt 1
you 1
love 1
to 1
pull 1
her 1
back 1
out 1
here 1
and 1
get 1
a 1
response 1
caesar 1
asks 1
the 1
audience 1
the 1
crowd 1
screams 1
assent 1
sadly 1
rules 1
are 1
rules 1
and 1
katniss 1
everdeens 1
time 1
has 1
been 1
spent 1
well 1
best 1
of 1
luck 1
to 1
you 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
speak 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
panem 1
when 1
i 1
say 1
our 1
hearts 1
go 1
with 1
yours 1
the 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
is 1
deafening 1
peeta 1
has 1
absolutely 1
wiped 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
off 1
the 1
map 1
with 1
his 1
declaration 1
of 1
love 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
the 1
audience 1
finally 1
settles 1
down 1
he 1
chokes 1
out 1
a 1
quiet 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
returns 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
we 1
stand 1
for 1
the 1
anthem 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
raise 1
my 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
required 1
respect 1
and 1
cannot 1
avoid 1
seeing 1
that 1
every 1
screen 1
is 1
now 1
dominated 1
by 1
a 1
shot 1
of 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
separated 1
by 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
viewers 1
heads 1
can 1
never 1
be 1
breached 1
poor 1
tragic 1
us 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
better 1
after 1
the 1
anthem 1
the 1
tributes 1
file 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
lobby 1
and 1
onto 1
the 1
elevators 1
i 1
make 1
sure 1
to 1
veer 1
into 1
a 1
car 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
contain 1
peeta 1
the 1
crowd 1
slows 1
our 1
entourages 1
of 1
stylists 1
and 1
mentors 1
and 1
chaperones 1
so 1
we 1
have 1
only 1
each 1
other 1
for 1
company 1
no 1
one 1
speaks 1
my 1
elevator 1
stops 1
to 1
deposit 1
four 1
tributes 1
before 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
and 1
then 1
find 1
the 1
doors 1
opening 1
on 1
the 1
twelfth 1
floor 1
peeta 1
has 1
only 1
just 1
stepped 1
from 1
his 1
car 1
when 1
i 1
slam 1
my 1
palms 1
into 1
his 1
chest 1
he 1
loses 1
his 1
balance 1
and 1
crashes 1
into 1
an 1
ugly 1
urn 1
filled 1
with 1
fake 1
flowers 1
the 1
urn 1
tips 1
and 1
shatters 1
into 1
hundreds 1
of 1
tiny 1
pieces 1
peeta 1
lands 1
in 1
the 1
shards 1
and 1
blood 1
immediately 1
flows 1
from 1
his 1
hands 1
what 1
was 1
that 1
for 1
he 1
says 1
aghast 1
you 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
go 1
saying 1
those 1
things 1
about 1
me 1
i 1
shout 1
at 1
him 1
now 1
the 1
elevators 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
crew 1

and 1
portia 1

note 1
of 1
hysteria 1
in 1

of 1
gale 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
a 1
boyfriend 1
whatever 1

but 1
i 1
bet 1
hes 1
smart 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
bluff 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
it 1
besides 1
you 1
didnt 1
say 1
you 1
loved 1
me 1
so 1
what 1

matter 1
the 1
words 1
are 1
sinking 1
in 1
my 1
anger 1
fading 1
im 1
torn 1
now 1
between 1
thinking 1
ive 1
been 1
used 1
and 1
thinking 1
ive 1
been 1
given 1
an 1
edge 1
haymitch 1
is 1
right 1
i 1
survived 1
my 1
interview 1
but 1
what 1

i 1
really 1
a 1
silly 1
girl 1
spinning 1
in 1
a 1
sparkling 1
dress 1
giggling 1
the 1
only 1
moment 1
of 1
any 1
substance 1
i 1
hail 1
was 1
when 1
i 1
talked 1
about 1
prim 1

that 1
with 1
thresh 1
his 1
silent 1
deadly 1
power 1
and 1
im 1
forgettable 1
silly 1
and 1
sparkly 1
and 1
forgettable 1

entirely 1
forgettable 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
eleven 1
in 1
training 1
but 1
now 1
peeta 1
has 1
made 1
me 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
love 1

his 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
tell 1
it 1

many 1
admirers 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
audience 1
really 1
thinks 1
were 1
in 1
love 1
i 1
remember 1
how 1
strongly 1
they 1
responded 1
to 1
his 1
confession 1
starcrossed 1
lovers 1
haymitch 1
is 1
right 1
they 1
eat 1
that 1
stuff 1

im 1
worried 1

i 1
didnt 1
react 1
properly 1
after 1
he 1
said 1
he 1

haymitch 1

embarrassed 1
about 1
my 1
reaction 1
i 1
force 1
myself 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
peeta 1
im 1
sorry 1
i 1
shoved 1

he 1
shrugs 1

your 1
hands 1
okay 1
i 1
ask 1
theyll 1
be 1
all 1

he 1
says 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
that 1
follows 1
delicious 1
smells 1
of 1
our 1
dinner 1
waft 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1

haymitch 1
we 1
all 1
follow 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
take 1
our 1
places 1
but 1
then 1
peeta 1
is 1
bleeding 1
too 1
heavily 1
and 1
portia 1
leads 1
him 1
off 1
for 1
medical 1
treatment 1
we 1
start 1
the 1
cream 1
and 1
rosepetal 1
soup 1
without 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
weve 1
finished 1
theyre 1
back 1
peetas 1
hands 1
are 1
wrapped 1
in 1
bandages 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
feeling 1
guilty 1
tomorrow 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
he 1

a 1
favor 1
and 1
i 1

answered 1
with 1
an 1
injury 1
will 1
i 1
never 1
stop 1
owing 1
him 1
after 1
dinner 1
we 1
watch 1
the 1
replay 1
in 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
i 1
seem 1
frilly 1
and 1
shallow 1
twirling 1
and 1
giggling 1
in 1
my 1
dress 1
although 1
the 1
others 1
assure 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
charming 1
peeta 1
actually 1
is 1
charming 1
and 1
then 1
utterly 1
winning 1
as 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
love 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
am 1
blushing 1
and 1
confused 1
made 1
beautiful 1
by 1
cinnas 1
hands 1
desirable 1
by 1
peetas 1
confession 1
tragic 1
by 1
circumstance 1
and 1
by 1
all 1
accounts 1
unforgettable 1
when 1
the 1
anthem 1
finishes 1
and 1
the 1
screen 1
goes 1
dark 1
a 1
hush 1
falls 1
on 1
the 1
room 1
tomorrow 1
at 1
dawn 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
roused 1
and 1
prepared 1
for 1
the 1
arena 1
the 1
actual 1
games 1
dont 1
start 1
until 1
ten 1
because 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
residents 1
rise 1
late 1
but 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
make 1
an 1
early 1
start 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
telling 1
how 1
far 1
we 1
will 1
travel 1
to 1
the 1
arena 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
this 1
years 1
games 1
i 1
know 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
going 1
with 1
us 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
leave 1
here 1
theyll 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
games 1
headquarters 1
hopefully 1
madly 1
signing 1
up 1
our 1
sponsors 1
working 1
out 1
a 1
strategy 1
on 1
how 1
and 1
when 1
to 1
deliver 1
the 1
gifts 1
to 1
us 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
will 1
travel 1
with 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
launched 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
still 1
final 1
goodbyes 1
must 1
be 1
said 1
here 1
effie 1
takes 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
with 1
actual 1
tears 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
wishes 1
us 1
well 1
thanks 1
us 1
for 1
being 1
the 1
best 1
tributes 1
it 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
her 1
privilege 1
to 1
sponsor 1
and 1
then 1
because 1
its 1
effie 1
and 1
shes 1
apparently 1
required 1
by 1
law 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
awful 1
she 1
adds 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
surprised 1
if 1
i 1
finally 1
get 1
promoted 1
to 1
a 1
decent 1
district 1
next 1
year 1
then 1
she 1
kisses 1
us 1
each 1
on 1
the 1
cheek 1
and 1
hurries 1
out 1
overcome 1
with 1
either 1
the 1
emotional 1
parting 1
or 1
the 1
possible 1
improvement 1
of 1
her 1
fortunes 1
haymitch 1
crosses 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
looks 1
us 1
both 1
over 1
any 1
final 1
words 1
of 1
advice 1
asks 1
peeta 1
when 1
the 1
gong 1
sounds 1
get 1
the 1
hell 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
youre 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
blood 1
bath 1
at 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
just 1
clear 1
out 1
put 1
as 1
much 1
distance 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
between 1
yourselves 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
find 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
water 1
he 1
says 1
got 1
it 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
i 1
ask 1
stay 1
alive 1
says 1
haymitch 1
its 1
the 1
same 1
advice 1
he 1
gave 1
us 1
on 1
the 1
train 1
but 1
hes 1
not 1
drunk 1
and 1
laughing 1
this 1
time 1
and 1
we 1
only 1
nod 1
what 1
else 1
is 1
there 1
to 1
say 1
when 1
i 1
head 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
peeta 1
lingers 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
portia 1
im 1
glad 1
whatever 1
strange 1
words 1
of 1
parting 1
we 1
exchange 1
can 1
wait 1
until 1
tomorrow 1
my 1
covers 1
are 1
drawn 1
back 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
knew 1
her 1
name 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
asked 1
it 1
she 1
could 1
write 1
it 1
down 1
maybe 1
or 1
act 1
it 1
out 1
but 1
perhaps 1
that 1
would 1
only 1
result 1
in 1
punishment 1
for 1
her 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
shower 1
and 1
scrub 1
the 1
gold 1
paint 1
the 1
makeup 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
beauty 1
from 1
my 1
body 1
all 1
that 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
designteams 1
efforts 1
are 1
the 1
flames 1
on 1
my 1
nails 1
i 1
decide 1
to 1
keep 1
them 1
as 1
reminder 1
of 1
who 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
the 1
audience 1
katniss 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
fire 1
perhaps 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
to 1
come 1
i 1
pull 1
on 1
a 1
thick 1
fleecy 1
nightgown 1
and 1
climb 1
into 1
bed 1
it 1
takes 1
me 1
about 1
five 1
seconds 1
to 1
realize 1
ill 1
never 1
fall 1
asleep 1
and 1
i 1
need 1
sleep 1
desperately 1
because 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
every 1
moment 1
i 1
give 1
in 1
to 1
fatigue 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
invitation 1
to 1
death 1
its 1
no 1
good 1
one 1
hour 1
two 1
three 1
pass 1
and 1
my 1
eyelids 1
refuse 1
to 1
get 1
heavy 1
i 1
cant 1
stop 1
trying 1
to 1
imagine 1
exactly 1
what 1
terrain 1
ill 1
be 1
thrown 1
into 1
desert 1
swamp 1
a 1
frigid 1
wasteland 1
above 1
all 1
i 1
am 1
hoping 1
for 1
trees 1
which 1
may 1
afford 1
me 1
some 1
means 1
of 1
concealment 1
and 1
food 1
and 1
shelter 1
often 1
there 1
are 1
trees 1
because 1
barren 1
landscapes 1
are 1
dull 1
and 1
the 1
games 1
resolve 1
too 1
quickly 1
without 1
them 1
but 1
what 1
will 1
the 1
climate 1
be 1
like 1
what 1
traps 1
have 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
hid 1
den 1
to 1
liven 1
up 1
the 1
slower 1
moments 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
my 1
fellow 1
tributes 1
the 1
more 1
anxious 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
find 1
sleep 1
the 1
more 1
it 1
eludes 1
me 1
finally 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
restless 1
to 1
even 1
stay 1
in 1
bed 1
i 1
pace 1
the 1
floor 1
heart 1
beating 1
too 1
fast 1
breathing 1
too 1
short 1
my 1
room 1
feels 1
like 1
a 1
prison 1
cell 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
air 1
soon 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
start 1
to 1
throw 1
things 1
again 1
i 1
run 1
down 1
the 1
hall 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
its 1
not 1
only 1
unlocked 1
but 1
ajar 1
perhaps 1
someone 1
forgot 1
to 1
close 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
the 1
energy 1
field 1
enclosing 1
the 1
roof 1
prevents 1
any 1
desperate 1
form 1
of 1
escape 1
and 1
im 1
not 1
looking 1
to 1
escape 1
only 1
to 1
fill 1
my 1
lungs 1
with 1
air 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
on 1
the 1
last 1
night 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
be 1
hunting 1
me 1
the 1
roof 1
is 1
not 1
lit 1
at 1
night 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
my 1
bare 1
feel 1
reach 1
its 1
tiled 1
surface 1
i 1
see 1
his 1
silhouette 1
black 1
against 1
the 1
lights 1
that 1
shine 1
endlessly 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
theres 1
quite 1
a 1
commotion 1
going 1
on 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
music 1
and 1
singing 1
and 1
car 1
horns 1
none 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
hear 1
through 1
the 1
thick 1
glass 1
window 1
panels 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
i 1
could 1
slip 1
away 1
now 1
without 1
him 1
noticing 1
me 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
hear 1
me 1
over 1
the 1
din 1
but 1
the 1
night 1
airs 1
so 1
sweet 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
returning 1
to 1
that 1
stuffy 1
cage 1
of 1
a 1
room 1
and 1
what 1
difference 1
does 1
it 1
make 1
whether 1
we 1
speak 1
or 1
not 1
my 1
feet 1
move 1
soundlessly 1
across 1
the 1
tiles 1
im 1
only 1
yard 1
behind 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
say 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
getting 1
some 1
sleep 1
he 1
starts 1
but 1
doesnt 1
turn 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
him 1
give 1
his 1
head 1
a 1
slight 1
shake 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
party 1
its 1
for 1
us 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
come 1
up 1
beside 1
him 1
and 1
lean 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
rail 1
the 1
wide 1
streets 1

your 1
choice 1
i 1
want 1
to 1

mine 1
in 1
district 1
twelve 1

surprise 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
do 1

peeta 1

my 1
mother 1

best 1

and 1
leave 1
the 1
roof 1
i 1
spend 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
slipping 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
doze 1
imagining 1
the 1
cutting 1
remarks 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
to 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
we 1
will 1
see 1
how 1
high 1
and 1
mighty 1
he 1
is 1
when 1
hes 1
faced 1
with 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
hell 1
probably 1
turn 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
raging 1
beast 1
tributes 1
the 1
kind 1
who 1
tries 1
to 1
eat 1
someones 1
heart 1
after 1
theyve 1
killed 1
them 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
guy 1
like 1
that 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
from 1
district 1
called 1
titus 1
he 1
went 1
completely 1
savage 1
and 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
had 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
stunned 1
with 1
electric 1
guns 1
to 1
collect 1
the 1
bodies 1
of 1
the 1
players 1
hed 1
killed 1
before 1
he 1
ate 1
them 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
rules 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
but 1
cannibalism 1
doesnt 1
play 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
capitol 1
audience 1
so 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
head 1
it 1
off 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
speculation 1
that 1
the 1
avalanche 1
that 1
finally 1
took 1
titus 1
out 1
was 1
specifically 1
engineered 1
to 1
ensure 1
the 1
victor 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
lunatic 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
peeta 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
cinna 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
before 1
dawn 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
simple 1
shift 1
to 1
wear 1
and 1
guides 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
my 1
final 1
dressing 1
and 1
preparations 1
will 1
be 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
catacombs 1
under 1
the 1
arena 1
itself 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
appears 1
out 1
of 1
thin 1
air 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
did 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
captured 1
and 1
a 1
ladder 1
drops 1
down 1
i 1
place 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
on 1
the 1
lower 1
rungs 1
and 1
instantly 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
im 1
frozen 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
current 1
glues 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ladder 1
while 1
im 1
lifted 1
safely 1
inside 1
i 1
expect 1
the 1
ladder 1
to 1
release 1
me 1
then 1
but 1
im 1
still 1
stuck 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
white 1
coat 1
approaches 1
me 1
carrying 1
a 1
syringe 1
this 1
is 1
just 1
your 1
tracker 1
katniss 1
the 1
stiller 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
efficiently 1
i 1
can 1
place 1
it 1
she 1
says 1
still 1
im 1
a 1
statue 1
but 1
that 1
doesnt 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
feeling 1
the 1
sharp 1
stab 1
of 1
pain 1
as 1
the 1
needle 1
inserts 1
the 1
metal 1
tracking 1
device 1
deep 1
under 1
the 1
skin 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
my 1
forearm 1
now 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
trace 1
my 1
whereabouts 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
wouldnt 1
want 1
to 1
lose 1
a 1
tribute 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
trackers 1
in 1
place 1
the 1
ladder 1
releases 1
me 1
the 1
woman 1
disappears 1
and 1
cinna 1
is 1
retrieved 1
from 1
the 1
roof 1
an 1
avox 1
boy 1
comes 1
in 1
and 1
directs 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
where 1
breakfast 1
has 1
been 1
laid 1
out 1
despite 1
the 1
tension 1
in 1
my 1
stomach 1
i 1
eat 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
although 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
delectable 1
food 1
makes 1
any 1
impression 1
on 1
me 1
im 1
so 1
nervous 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
eating 1
coal 1
dust 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
that 1
distracts 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
is 1
the 1
view 1
from 1
the 1
windows 1
as 1
we 1
sail 1
over 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
wilderness 1
beyond 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
birds 1
see 1
only 1
theyre 1
free 1
and 1
safe 1
the 1
very 1
opposite 1
of 1
me 1
the 1
ride 1
lasts 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
windows 1
black 1
out 1
suggesting 1
that 1
were 1
nearing 1
the 1
arena 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
lands 1
and 1
cinna 1
and 1
i 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
ladder 1
only 1
this 1
time 1
it 1
leads 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
tube 1
underground 1
into 1
the 1
catacombs 1
that 1
lie 1
beneath 1
the 1
arena 1
we 1
follow 1
instructions 1
to 1
my 1
destination 1
a 1
chamber 1
for 1
my 1
preparation 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
they 1
call 1
it 1
the 1
launch 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
districts 1
its 1
referred 1
to 1
as 1
the 1
stockyard 1
the 1
place 1
animals 1
go 1
before 1
slaughter 1
everything 1
is 1
brandnew 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
only 1
tribute 1
to 1
use 1
this 1
launch 1
room 1
the 1
arenas 1
are 1
historic 1
sites 1
preserved 1
after 1
the 1
games 1
popular 1
destinations 1
for 1
capitol 1
residents 1
to 1
visit 1
to 1
vacation 1
go 1
for 1
a 1
month 1
rewatch 1
the 1
games 1
tour 1
the 1
catacombs 1
visit 1
the 1
sites 1
where 1
the 1
deaths 1
took 1
place 1
you 1
can 1
even 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
reenactments 1
they 1
say 1
the 1
food 1
is 1
excellent 1
i 1
struggle 1
to 1
keep 1
my 1
breakfast 1
down 1
as 1
i 1
shower 1
and 1
clean 1
my 1
teeth 1
cinna 1
does 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
my 1
simple 1
trademark 1
braid 1
down 1
my 1
back 1
then 1
the 1
clothes 1
arrive 1
the 1
same 1
for 1
every 1
tribute 1
cinna 1
has 1
had 1
no 1
say 1
in 1
my 1
outfit 1
does 1
not 1
even 1
know 1
what 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
package 1
but 1
he 1
helps 1
me 1
dress 1
in 1
the 1
undergarments 1
simple 1
tawny 1
pants 1
light 1
green 1
blouse 1
sturdy 1
brown 1
belt 1
and 1
thin 1
hooded 1
black 1
jacket 1
that 1
falls 1
to 1
my 1
thighs 1
the 1
material 1
in 1
the 1
jackets 1
designed 1
to 1
reflect 1
body 1
heat 1
expect 1
some 1
cool 1
nights 1
he 1
says 1
the 1
boots 1
worn 1
over 1
skintight 1
socks 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
hoped 1
for 1
soft 1
leather 1
not 1
unlike 1
my 1
ones 1
at 1
home 1
these 1
have 1
a 1
narrow 1
flexible 1
rubber 1
sole 1
with 1
treads 1
though 1
good 1
for 1
running 1
i 1
think 1
im 1
finished 1
when 1
cinna 1
pulls 1
the 1
gold 1
mockingjay 1
pin 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
i 1
had 1
completely 1
forgotten 1
about 1
it 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
that 1
i 1
ask 1
off 1
the 1
green 1
outfit 1
you 1
wore 1
on 1
the 1
train 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
remember 1
now 1
taking 1
it 1
off 1
my 1
mothers 1
dress 1
pinning 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
shirt 1
its 1
your 1
district 1
token 1
right 1
i 1
nod 1
and 1
he 1
fastens 1
it 1
on 1
my 1
shirt 1
it 1
barely 1
cleared 1
the 1
review 1
board 1
some 1
thought 1
the 1
pin 1
could 1
be 1
used 1
as 1
a 1
weapon 1
giving 1
you 1
an 1
unfair 1
advantage 1
but 1
eventually 1
they 1
let 1
it 1
through 1
says 1
cinna 1
they 1
eliminated 1
a 1
ring 1
from 1
that 1
district 1
one 1
girl 1
though 1
if 1
you 1
twisted 1
the 1
gemstone 1
a 1
spike 1
popped 1
out 1
poisoned 1
one 1
she 1
claimed 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
the 1
ring 1
transformed 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
prove 1
she 1
did 1
but 1
she 1
lost 1
her 1
token 1
there 1
youre 1
all 1
set 1
move 1
around 1
make 1
sure 1
everything 1
feels 1
comfortable 1
i 1
walk 1
run 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
swing 1
my 1
arms 1
about 1
yes 1
its 1
fine 1
fits 1
perfectly 1
then 1
theres 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
call 1
says 1
cinna 1
unless 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
eat 1
any 1
more 1
i 1
turn 1
down 1
food 1
but 1
accept 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
water 1
that 1
i 1
take 1
tiny 1
sips 1
of 1
as 1
we 1
wait 1
on 1
a 1
couch 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
chew 1
on 1
my 1
nails 1
or 1
lips 1
so 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
gnawing 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
my 1
cheek 1
it 1
still 1
hasnt 1
fully 1
healed 1
from 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
ago 1
soon 1
the 1
taste 1
of 1
blood 1
fills 1
my 1
mouth 1
nervousness 1
seeps 1
into 1
terror 1
as 1
i 1
anticipate 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
come 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
dead 1
flatout 1
dead 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
not 1
even 1
my 1
fingers 1
obsessively 1
trace 1
the 1
hard 1
little 1
lump 1
on 1
my 1
forearm 1
where 1
the 1
woman 1
injected 1
the 1
tracking 1
device 1
i 1
press 1
on 1
it 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
hurts 1
i 1
press 1
on 1
it 1
so 1
hard 1
a 1
small 1
bruise 1
begins 1
to 1
form 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
katniss 1
cinna 1
asks 1
i 1
shake 1
my 1
head 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
moment 1
hold 1
out 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
cinna 1
encloses 1
it 1
in 1
both 1
of 1
his 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
how 1
we 1
sit 1
until 1
a 1
pleasant 1
female 1
voice 1
announces 1
its 1
time 1
to 1
prepare 1
for 1
launch 1
still 1
clenching 1
one 1
of 1
cinnas 1
hands 1
i 1
walk 1
over 1
and 1
stand 1
on 1
the 1
circular 1
metal 1
plate 1
remember 1
what 1
haymitch 1
said 1
run 1
find 1
water 1
the 1
rest 1
will 1
follow 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
nod 1
and 1
remember 1
this 1
im 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
bet 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
my 1
money 1
would 1
be 1
on 1
you 1
truly 1
i 1
whisper 1
truly 1
says 1
cinna 1
he 1
leans 1
down 1
and 1
kisses 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
forehead 1
good 1
luck 1
girl 1
on 1
fire 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
glass 1
cylinder 1
is 1
lowering 1
around 1
me 1
breaking 1
our 1
handhold 1
cutting 1
him 1
off 1
from 1
me 1
he 1
taps 1
his 1
fingers 1
under 1
his 1
chin 1
head 1
high 1
i 1
lift 1
my 1
chin 1
and 1
stand 1
as 1
straight 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
the 1
cylinder 1
begins 1
to 1
rise 1
for 1
maybe 1
fifteen 1
seconds 1
im 1
in 1
darkness 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
metal 1
plate 1
pushing 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cylinder 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
eyes 1
are 1
dazzled 1
by 1
the 1
bright 1
sunlight 1
and 1
im 1
conscious 1
only 1
of 1
a 1
strong 1
wind 1
with 1
the 1
hopeful 1
smell 1
of 1
pine 1
trees 1
then 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
legendary 1
announcer 1
claudius 1
templesmith 1
as 1
his 1
voice 1
booms 1
all 1
around 1
me 1
ladies 1
and 1
gentlemen 1
let 1
the 1
seventyfourth 1
hunger 1
games 1
begin 1
sixty 1
seconds 1
thats 1
how 1
long 1
were 1
required 1
to 1
stand 1
on 1
our 1
metal 1
circles 1
before 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
gong 1
releases 1
us 1
step 1
off 1
before 1
the 1
minute 1
is 1
up 1
and 1
land 1
mines 1
blow 1
your 1
legs 1
off 1
sixty 1
seconds 1
to 1
take 1
in 1
the 1
ring 1
of 1
tributes 1
all 1
equidistant 1
from 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
a 1
giant 1
golden 1
horn 1
shaped 1
like 1
a 1
cone 1
with 1
a 1
curved 1
tail 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
which 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
twenty 1
feet 1
high 1
spilling 1
over 1
with 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
will 1
give 1
us 1
life 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
food 1
containers 1
of 1
water 1
weapons 1
medicine 1
garments 1
fire 1
starters 1
strewn 1
around 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
are 1
other 1
supplies 1
their 1
value 1
decreasing 1
the 1
farther 1
they 1
are 1
from 1
the 1
horn 1
for 1
instance 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
steps 1
from 1
my 1
feet 1
lays 1
a 1
threefoot 1
square 1
of 1
plastic 1
certainly 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
use 1
in 1
a 1
downpour 1
but 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
a 1
tent 1
pack 1
that 1
would 1
protect 1
from 1
almost 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
weather 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
guts 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
fight 1
for 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
other 1
twentythree 1
tributes 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
instructed 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
flat 1
open 1
stretch 1
of 1
ground 1
a 1
plain 1
of 1
hardpacked 1
dirt 1
behind 1
the 1
tributes 1
across 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
nothing 1
indicating 1
either 1
a 1
steep 1
downward 1
slope 1
or 1
even 1
cliff 1
to 1
my 1
right 1
lies 1
a 1
lake 1
to 1
my 1
left 1
and 1
back 1
spars 1
piney 1
woods 1
this 1
is 1
where 1
haymitch 1
would 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
immediately 1
i 1
hear 1
his 1
instructions 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
just 1
clear 1
out 1
put 1
as 1
much 1
distance 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
between 1
yourselves 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
find 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
water 1
but 1
its 1
tempting 1
so 1
tempting 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
bounty 1
waiting 1
there 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
it 1
someone 1
else 1
will 1
that 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
who 1
survive 1
the 1
bloodbath 1
will 1
divide 1
up 1
most 1
of 1
these 1
lifesustaining 1
spoils 1
something 1
catches 1
my 1
eye 1
there 1
resting 1
on 1
a 1
mound 1
of 1
blanket 1
rolls 1
is 1
a 1
silver 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
and 1
a 1
bow 1
already 1
strung 1
just 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
engaged 1
thats 1
mine 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
meant 1
for 1
me 1
im 1
fast 1
i 1
can 1
sprint 1
faster 1
than 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
girls 1
in 1
our 1
school 1
although 1
a 1
couple 1
can 1
beat 1
me 1
in 1
distance 1
races 1
but 1
this 1
fortyyard 1
length 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
built 1
for 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
can 1
reach 1
it 1
first 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
question 1
is 1
how 1
quickly 1
can 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
ive 1
scrambled 1
up 1
the 1
packs 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
weapons 1
others 1
will 1
have 1
reached 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
pick 1
off 1
but 1
say 1
theres 1
a 1
dozen 1
at 1
that 1
close 1
range 1
they 1
could 1
take 1
me 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
spears 1
and 1
the 1
clubs 1
or 1
their 1
own 1
powerful 1
fists 1
still 1
i 1
wont 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
target 1
im 1
betting 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
would 1
pass 1
up 1
a 1
smaller 1
girl 1
even 1
one 1
who 1
scored 1
an 1
eleven 1
in 1
training 1
to 1
take 1
out 1
their 1
more 1
fierce 1
adversaries 1
haymitch 1
has 1
never 1
seen 1
me 1
run 1
maybe 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
hed 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
get 1
the 1
weapon 1
since 1
thats 1
the 1
very 1
weapon 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
my 1
salvation 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
see 1
one 1
bow 1
in 1
that 1
whole 1
pile 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
minute 1
must 1
be 1
almost 1
up 1
and 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
decide 1
what 1
my 1
strategy 1
will 1
be 1
and 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
positioning 1
my 1
feet 1
to 1
run 1
not 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
stir 1
rounding 1
forests 1
but 1
toward 1
the 1
pile 1
toward 1
the 1
bow 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
notice 1
peeta 1
hes 1
about 1
five 1
tributes 1
to 1
my 1
right 1
quite 1
a 1
fair 1
distance 1
still 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
hes 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
but 1
the 1
suns 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
while 1
im 1
puzzling 1
over 1
it 1
the 1
gong 1
rings 1
out 1
and 1
ive 1
missed 1
it 1
ive 1
missed 1
my 1
chance 1
because 1
those 1
extra 1
couple 1
of 1
seconds 1
ive 1
lost 1
by 1
not 1
being 1
ready 1
are 1
enough 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
going 1
in 1
my 1
feet 1
shuffle 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
confused 1
at 1
the 1
direction 1
my 1
brain 1
wants 1
to 1
take 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
lunge 1
forward 1
scoop 1
up 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
plastic 1
and 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
the 1
pickings 1
are 1
so 1
small 1
and 1
im 1
so 1
angry 1
with 1
peeta 1
for 1
distracting 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
sprint 1
in 1
twenty 1
yards 1
to 1
retrieve 1
a 1
bright 1
orange 1
backpack 1
that 1
could 1
hold 1
anything 1
because 1
i 1
cant 1
stand 1
leaving 1
with 1
virtually 1
nothing 1
a 1
boy 1
i 1
think 1
from 1
district 1
reaches 1
the 1
pack 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
i 1
do 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
brief 1
time 1
we 1
grapple 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
coughs 1
splattering 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
blood 1
i 1
stagger 1
back 1
repulsed 1
by 1
the 1
warm 1
sticky 1
spray 1
then 1
the 1
boy 1
slips 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
already 1
other 1
tributes 1
have 1
reached 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
and 1
are 1
spreading 1
out 1
to 1
attack 1
yes 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
ten 1
yards 1
away 1
running 1
toward 1
me 1
one 1
hand 1
clutching 1
a 1
halfdozen 1
knives 1
ive 1
seen 1
her 1
throw 1
in 1
training 1
she 1
never 1
misses 1
and 1
im 1
her 1
next 1
target 1
all 1
the 1
general 1
fear 1
ive 1
been 1
feeling 1
condenses 1
into 1
at 1
immediate 1
fear 1
of 1
this 1
girl 1
this 1
predator 1
who 1
might 1
kill 1
me 1
in 1
seconds 1
adrenaline 1
shoots 1
through 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
sling 1
the 1
pack 1
over 1
one 1
shoulder 1
and 1
run 1
fullspeed 1
for 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
blade 1
whistling 1
toward 1
me 1
and 1
reflexively 1
hike 1
the 1
pack 1
up 1
to 1
protect 1
my 1
head 1
the 1
blade 1
lodges 1
in 1
the 1
pack 1
both 1
straps 1
on 1
my 1
shoulders 1
now 1
i 1
make 1
for 1
the 1
trees 1
somehow 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
girl 1
will 1
not 1
pursue 1
me 1
that 1
shell 1
be 1
drawn 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
before 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
stuff 1
is 1
gone 1
a 1
grin 1
crosses 1
my 1
face 1
thanks 1
for 1
the 1
knife 1
i 1
think 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
turn 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
to 1
survey 1
the 1
field 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
or 1
so 1
tributes 1
are 1
hacking 1
away 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
at 1
the 1
horn 1
several 1
lie 1
dead 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
taken 1
flight 1
are 1
disappearing 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
into 1
the 1
void 1
opposite 1
me 1
i 1
continue 1
running 1
until 1
the 1
woods 1
have 1
hidden 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
then 1
slow 1
into 1
a 1
steady 1
jog 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
maintain 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
hours 1
i 1
alternate 1
between 1
jogging 1
and 1
walking 1
putting 1
as 1
much 1
distance 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
between 1
myself 1
and 1
my 1
competitors 1
i 1
lost 1
my 1
bread 1
during 1
the 1
struggle 1
with 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
but 1
managed 1
to 1
stuff 1
my 1
plastic 1
in 1
my 1
sleeve 1
so 1
as 1
i 1
walk 1
i 1
fold 1
it 1
neatly 1
and 1
tuck 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
pocket 1
i 1
also 1
free 1
the 1
knife 1
its 1
a 1
fine 1
one 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
sharp 1
blade 1
serrated 1
near 1
the 1
handle 1
which 1
will 1
make 1
it 1
handy 1
for 1
sawing 1
through 1
things 1
and 1
slide 1
it 1
into 1
my 1
belt 1
i 1
dont 1
dare 1
stop 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
yet 1
i 1
just 1
keep 1
moving 1
pausing 1
only 1
to 1
check 1
for 1
pursuers 1
i 1
can 1
go 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
from 1
my 1
days 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
need 1
water 1
that 1
was 1
haymitchs 1
second 1
instruction 1
and 1
since 1
i 1
sort 1
of 1
botched 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
keep 1
a 1
sharp 1
eye 1
out 1
for 1
any 1
sign 1
of 1
it 1
no 1
luck 1
the 1
woods 1
begin 1
to 1
evolve 1
and 1
the 1
pines 1
are 1
intermixed 1
with 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
trees 1
some 1
i 1
recognize 1
some 1
completely 1
foreign 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
noise 1
and 1
pull 1
my 1
knife 1
thinking 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
defend 1
myself 1
but 1
ive 1
only 1
startled 1
a 1
rabbit 1
good 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
i 1
whisper 1
if 1
theres 1
one 1
rabbit 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
hundreds 1
just 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
snared 1
the 1
ground 1
slopes 1
down 1
i 1
dont 1
particularly 1
like 1
this 1
valleys 1
make 1
me 1
feel 1
trapped 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
high 1
like 1
in 1
the 1
hills 1
around 1
district 1
where 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
my 1
enemies 1
approaching 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
keep 1
going 1
funny 1
though 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
too 1
bad 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
gorging 1
myself 1
have 1
paid 1
off 1
ive 1
got 1
staying 1
power 1
even 1
though 1
im 1
short 1
on 1
sleep 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
is 1
rejuvenating 1
im 1
glad 1
for 1
the 1
solitude 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
an 1
illusion 1
because 1
im 1
probably 1
onscreen 1
right 1
now 1
not 1
consistently 1
but 1
off 1
and 1
on 1
there 1
are 1
so 1
many 1
deaths 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
that 1
a 1
tribute 1
trekking 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
isnt 1
much 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
but 1
theyll 1
show 1
me 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
people 1
know 1
im 1
alive 1
uninjured 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
move 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
heaviest 1
days 1
of 1
betting 1
is 1
the 1
opening 1
when 1
the 1
initial 1
casualties 1
come 1
in 1
but 1
that 1
cant 1
compare 1
to 1
what 1
happens 1
as 1
the 1
field 1
shrinks 1
to 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
players 1
its 1
late 1
afternoon 1
when 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
cannons 1
each 1
shot 1
represents 1
a 1
dead 1
tribute 1
the 1
fighting 1
must 1
have 1
finally 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
they 1
never 1
collect 1
the 1
bloodbath 1
bodies 1
until 1
the 1
killers 1
have 1
dispersed 1
on 1
the 1
opening 1
day 1
they 1
dont 1
even 1
fire 1
the 1
cannons 1
until 1
the 1
initial 1
fightings 1
over 1
because 1
its 1
too 1
hard 1
to 1
keep 1
track 1
of 1
the 1
fatalities 1
i 1
allow 1
myself 1
to 1
pause 1
panting 1
as 1
i 1
count 1
the 1
shots 1
one 1
two 1
three 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
until 1
they 1
reach 1
eleven 1
eleven 1
dead 1
in 1
all 1
thirteen 1
left 1
to 1
play 1
my 1
fingernails 1
scrape 1
at 1
the 1
dried 1
blood 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
coughed 1
into 1
my 1
face 1
hes 1
gone 1
certainly 1
i 1
wonder 1
about 1
peeta 1
has 1
he 1
lasted 1
through 1
the 1
day 1
ill 1
know 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
when 1
they 1
project 1
the 1
deads 1
images 1
into 1
the 1
sky 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
im 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
peeta 1
may 1
be 1
already 1
lost 1
bled 1
white 1
collected 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
process 1
of 1
being 1
transported 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
capitol 1
to 1
be 1
cleaned 1
up 1
redressed 1
and 1
shipped 1
in 1
a 1
simple 1
wooden 1
box 1
back 1
to 1
district 1
no 1
longer 1
hereheading 1
home 1
i 1
try 1
hard 1
to 1
remember 1
if 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
once 1
the 1
action 1
started 1
but 1
the 1
last 1
image 1
i 1
can 1
conjure 1
up 1
is 1
peeta 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
the 1
gong 1
rang 1
out 1
maybe 1
its 1
better 1
if 1
hes 1
gone 1
already 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
confidence 1
he 1
could 1
win 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
end 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
unpleasant 1
task 1
of 1
killing 1
him 1
maybe 1
its 1
better 1
if 1
hes 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
for 1
good 1
i 1
slump 1
down 1
next 1
to 1
my 1
pack 1
exhausted 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
it 1
anyway 1
before 1
night 1
falls 1
see 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
as 1
i 1
unhook 1
the 1
straps 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
its 1
sturdily 1
made 1
although 1
a 1
rather 1
unfortunate 1
color 1
this 1
orange 1
will 1
practically 1
glow 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
i 1
make 1
a 1
mental 1
note 1
to 1
camouflage 1
it 1
first 1
thing 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
flip 1
open 1
the 1
flap 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
most 1
right 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
is 1
water 1
haymitchs 1
directive 1
to 1
immediately 1
find 1
water 1
was 1
not 1
arbitrary 1
i 1
wont 1
last 1
long 1
without 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
ill 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
function 1
with 1
unpleasant 1
symptoms 1
of 1
dehydration 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
ill 1
deteriorate 1
into 1
helplessness 1
and 1
be 1
dead 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
tops 1
i 1
carefully 1
lay 1
out 1
the 1
provisions 1
one 1
thin 1
black 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
that 1
reflects 1
body 1
heal 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
crackers 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
dried 1
beef 1
strips 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
iodine 1
a 1
box 1
of 1
wooden 1
matches 1
a 1
small 1
coil 1
of 1
wire 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
sunglasses 1
and 1
a 1
halfgallon 1
plastic 1
bottle 1
with 1
a 1
cap 1
for 1
carrying 1
water 1
thats 1
bone 1
dry 1
no 1
water 1
how 1
hard 1
would 1
it 1
have 1
been 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
fill 1
up 1
the 1
bottle 1
i 1
become 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
dryness 1
in 1
my 1
throat 1
and 1
mouth 1
the 1
cracks 1
in 1
my 1
lips 1
ive 1
been 1
moving 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
its 1
been 1
hot 1
and 1
ive 1
sweat 1
a 1
lot 1
i 1
do 1
this 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
always 1
streams 1
to 1
drink 1
from 1
or 1
snow 1
to 1
melt 1
if 1
it 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
refill 1
my 1
pack 1
i 1
have 1
an 1
awful 1
thought 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
one 1
i 1
saw 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
gong 1
to 1
sound 1
what 1
if 1
thats 1
the 1
only 1
water 1
source 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
that 1
way 1
theyll 1
guarantee 1
drawing 1
us 1
in 1
to 1
fight 1
the 1
lake 1
is 1
a 1
full 1
days 1
journey 1
from 1
where 1
i 1
sit 1
now 1
a 1
much 1
harder 1
journey 1
with 1
nothing 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
then 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
reach 1
it 1
its 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
heavily 1
guarded 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
panic 1
when 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
rabbit 1
i 1
startled 1
earlier 1
today 1
it 1
has 1
to 1
drink 1
too 1
i 1
just 1
have 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
twilight 1
is 1
closing 1
in 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
ill 1
at 1
ease 1
the 1
trees 1
are 1
too 1
thin 1
to 1
offer 1
much 1
concealment 1
the 1
layer 1
of 1
pine 1
needles 1
that 1
muffles 1
my 1
footsteps 1
also 1
makes 1
tracking 1
animals 1
harder 1
when 1
i 1
need 1
their 1
trails 1
to 1
find 1
water 1
and 1
im 1
still 1
heading 1
downhill 1
deeper 1
and 1
deeper 1
into 1
a 1
valley 1
that 1
seems 1
endless 1
im 1
hungry 1
too 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
dare 1
break 1
into 1
my 1
precious 1
store 1
of 1
crackers 1
and 1
beef 1
yet 1
instead 1
i 1
take 1
my 1
knife 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
a 1
pine 1
tree 1
cutting 1
away 1
the 1
outer 1
bark 1
and 1
scraping 1
off 1
a 1
large 1
handful 1
of 1
the 1
softer 1
inner 1
bark 1
i 1
slowly 1
chew 1
the 1
stuff 1
as 1
i 1
walk 1
along 1
after 1
a 1
week 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
food 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
its 1
a 1
little 1
hard 1
to 1
choke 1
down 1
but 1
ive 1
eaten 1
plenty 1
of 1
pine 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
ill 1
adjust 1
quickly 1
in 1
another 1
hour 1
its 1
clear 1
ive 1
got 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
camp 1
night 1
creatures 1
are 1
coming 1
out 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
occasional 1
hoot 1
or 1
howl 1
my 1
first 1
clue 1
that 1
ill 1
be 1
competing 1
with 1
natural 1
predators 1
for 1
the 1
rabbits 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
ill 1
be 1
viewed 1
as 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
food 1
its 1
too 1
soon 1
to 1
tell 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
animals 1
stalking 1
me 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
but 1
right 1
now 1
i 1
decide 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
fellow 1
tributes 1
a 1
priority 1
im 1
sure 1
many 1
will 1
continue 1
hunting 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
those 1
who 1
fought 1
it 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
will 1
have 1
food 1
an 1
abundance 1
of 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
lake 1
torches 1
or 1
flashlights 1
and 1
weapons 1
theyre 1
itching 1
to 1
use 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
hope 1
ive 1
traveled 1
far 1
and 1
fast 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
range 1
before 1
settling 1
down 1
i 1
take 1
my 1
wire 1
and 1
set 1
two 1
twitchup 1
snares 1
in 1
the 1
brush 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
risky 1
to 1
be 1
setting 1
traps 1
but 1
food 1
will 1
go 1
so 1
fast 1
out 1
here 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
set 1
snares 1
on 1
the 1
run 1
still 1
i 1
walk 1
another 1
five 1
minutes 1
before 1
making 1
camp 1
i 1
pick 1
my 1
tree 1
carefully 1
a 1
willow 1
not 1
terribly 1
tall 1
but 1
set 1
in 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
other 1
willows 1
offering 1
concealment 1
in 1
those 1
long 1
flowing 1
tresses 1
i 1
climb 1
up 1
sticking 1
to 1
the 1
stronger 1
branches 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
trunk 1
and 1
find 1
a 1
sturdy 1
fork 1
for 1
my 1
bed 1
it 1
takes 1
some 1
doing 1
but 1
i 1
arrange 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
in 1
a 1
relatively 1
comfortable 1
manner 1
i 1
place 1
my 1
backpack 1
in 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
bag 1
then 1
slide 1
in 1
after 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
precaution 1
i 1
remove 1
my 1
belt 1
loop 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
around 1
the 1
branch 1
and 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
refasten 1
it 1
at 1
my 1
waist 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
roll 1
over 1
in 1
my 1
sleep 1
i 1
wont 1
go 1
crashing 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
im 1
small 1
enough 1
to 1
tuck 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
bag 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
but 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
hood 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
night 1
falls 1
the 1
air 1
is 1
cooling 1
quickly 1
despite 1
the 1
risk 1
i 1
took 1
in 1
getting 1
the 1
backpack 1
i 1
know 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
right 1
choice 1
this 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
radiating 1
back 1
and 1
preserving 1
my 1
body 1
heat 1
will 1
be 1
invaluable 1
im 1
sure 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
other 1
tributes 1
whose 1
biggest 1
concern 1
right 1
now 1
is 1
how 1
to 1
stay 1
warm 1
whereas 1
i 1
may 1
actually 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
sleep 1
if 1
only 1
i 1
wasnt 1
so 1
thirsty 1
night 1
has 1
just 1
come 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
anthem 1
that 1
proceeds 1
the 1
death 1
recap 1
through 1
the 1
branches 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
seal 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
floating 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
im 1
actually 1
viewing 1
another 1
screen 1
an 1
enormous 1
one 1
thats 1
transported 1
by 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
disappearing 1
hovercraft 1
the 1
anthem 1
fades 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
sky 1
goes 1
dark 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
home 1
we 1
would 1
be 1
watching 1
full 1
coverage 1
of 1
each 1
and 1
every 1
killing 1
but 1
thats 1
thought 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
unfair 1
advantage 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
tributes 1
for 1
instance 1
if 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
shot 1
someone 1
my 1
secret 1
would 1
be 1
revealed 1
to 1
all 1
no 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
all 1
we 1
see 1
are 1
the 1
same 1
photographs 1
they 1
showed 1
when 1
they 1
televised 1
our 1
training 1
scores 1
simple 1
head 1
shots 1
but 1
now 1
instead 1
of 1
scores 1
they 1
post 1
only 1
district 1
numbers 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
as 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
eleven 1
dead 1
tributes 1
begin 1
and 1
tick 1
them 1
off 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
on 1
my 1
fingers 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
appear 1
is 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
that 1
means 1
that 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
from 1
and 1
have 1
all 1
survived 1
no 1
surprise 1
there 1
then 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
i 1
didnt 1
expect 1
that 1
one 1
usually 1
all 1
the 1
careers 1
make 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
i 1
guess 1
the 1
foxfaced 1
girl 1
made 1
it 1
both 1
tributes 1
from 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
both 1
from 1
yes 1
theres 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
i 1
fought 1
for 1
the 1
backpack 1
ive 1
run 1
through 1
my 1
fingers 1
only 1
one 1
more 1
dead 1
tribute 1
to 1
go 1
is 1
it 1
peeta 1
no 1
theres 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
thats 1
it 1
the 1
capitol 1
seal 1
is 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
final 1
musical 1
flourish 1
then 1
darkness 1
and 1
the 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
resume 1
im 1
relieved 1
peetas 1
alive 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
again 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
get 1
killed 1
his 1
winning 1
will 1
benefit 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
the 1
most 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
conflicting 1
emotions 1
that 1
arise 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
peeta 1
the 1
gratitude 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
an 1
edge 1
by 1
professing 1
his 1
love 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
interview 1
the 1
anger 1
at 1
his 1
superiority 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
the 1
dread 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
come 1
facetoface 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
in 1
this 1
arena 1
eleven 1
dead 1
but 1
none 1
from 1
district 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
who 1
is 1
left 1
five 1
career 1
tributes 1
foxface 1
thresh 1
and 1
rue 1
rue 1
so 1
she 1
made 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
feeling 1
glad 1
that 1
makes 1
ten 1
of 1
us 1
the 1
other 1
three 1
ill 1
figure 1
out 1
tomorrow 1
now 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
dark 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
traveled 1
far 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
nestled 1
high 1
in 1
this 1
tree 1
now 1
i 1
must 1
try 1
and 1
rest 1
i 1
havent 1
really 1
slept 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
theres 1
been 1
the 1
long 1
days 1
journey 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
slowly 1
i 1
allow 1
my 1
muscles 1
to 1
relax 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
close 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
i 1
think 1
is 1
its 1
lucky 1
i 1
dont 1
snore 1
snap 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
breaking 1
branch 1
wakes 1
me 1
how 1
long 1
have 1
i 1
been 1
asleep 1
four 1
hours 1
five 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
my 1
nose 1
is 1
icy 1
cold 1
snap 1
snap 1
whats 1
going 1
on 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
branch 1
under 1
someones 1
foot 1
but 1
the 1
sharp 1
crack 1
of 1
one 1
coming 1
from 1
a 1
tree 1
snap 1
snap 1
i 1
judge 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
several 1
hundred 1
yards 1
to 1
my 1
right 1
slowly 1
noiselessly 1
i 1
turn 1
myself 1
in 1
that 1
direction 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
theres 1
nothing 1
but 1
blackness 1
and 1
some 1
scuffling 1
then 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
spark 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
fire 1
begins 1
to 1
bloom 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
hands 1
warms 1
over 1
flames 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
out 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
bite 1
my 1
lip 1
not 1
to 1
scream 1
every 1
foul 1
name 1
i 1
know 1
at 1
the 1
fire 1
starter 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
thinking 1
a 1
fire 1
ill 1
just 1
at 1
nightfall 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
thing 1
those 1
who 1
battled 1
at 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
with 1
their 1
superior 1
strength 1
and 1
surplus 1
of 1
supplies 1
they 1
couldnt 1
possibly 1
have 1
been 1
near 1
enough 1
to 1
spot 1
the 1
flames 1
then 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
theyve 1
probably 1
been 1
combing 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
hours 1
looking 1
for 1
victims 1
you 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
waving 1
a 1
flag 1
and 1
shouting 1
come 1
and 1
get 1
me 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
stones 1
throw 1
from 1
the 1
biggest 1
idiot 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
strapped 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
not 1
daring 1
to 1
flee 1
since 1
my 1
general 1
location 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
broadcast 1
to 1
any 1
killer 1
who 1
cares 1
i 1
mean 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
cold 1
out 1
here 1
and 1
not 1
everybody 1
has 1
a 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
but 1
then 1
you 1
grit 1
your 1
teeth 1
and 1
stick 1
it 1
out 1
until 1
dawn 1
i 1
lay 1
smoldering 1
in 1
my 1
bag 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
really 1
thinking 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
tree 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
the 1
least 1
problem 1
taking 1
out 1
my 1
new 1
neighbor 1
my 1
instinct 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
flee 1
not 1
fight 1
but 1
obviously 1
this 1
persons 1
a 1
hazard 1
stupid 1
people 1
are 1
dangerous 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
probably 1
doesnt 1
have 1
much 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
weapons 1
while 1
ive 1
got 1
this 1
excellent 1
knife 1
the 1
sky 1
is 1
still 1
dark 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
of 1
dawn 1
approaching 1
im 1
beginning 1
to 1
think 1
we 1
meaning 1
the 1
person 1
whose 1
death 1
im 1
now 1
devising 1
and 1
me 1
we 1
might 1
actually 1
have 1
gone 1
unnoticed 1
then 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
several 1
pairs 1
of 1
feet 1
breaking 1
into 1
a 1
run 1
the 1
fire 1
starter 1
must 1
have 1
dozed 1
off 1
theyre 1
on 1
her 1
before 1
she 1
can 1
escape 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
a 1
girl 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
the 1
pleading 1
the 1
agonized 1
scream 1
that 1
follows 1
then 1
theres 1
laughter 1
and 1
congratulations 1
from 1
several 1
voices 1
someone 1
cries 1
out 1
twelve 1
down 1
and 1
eleven 1
to 1
go 1
which 1
gets 1
a 1
round 1
of 1
appreciative 1
hoots 1
so 1
theyre 1
fighting 1
in 1
a 1
pack 1
im 1
not 1
really 1
surprised 1
often 1
alliances 1
are 1
formed 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
stages 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
the 1
strong 1
band 1
together 1
to 1
hunt 1
down 1
the 1
weak 1
then 1
when 1
the 1
tension 1
becomes 1
too 1
great 1
begin 1
to 1
turn 1
on 1
one 1
another 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
wonder 1
too 1
hard 1
who 1
has 1
made 1
this 1
alliance 1
itll 1
be 1
the 1
remaining 1
career 1
tributes 1
from 1
districts 1
and 1
two 1
boys 1
and 1
three 1
girls 1
the 1
ones 1
who 1
lunched 1
together 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
hear 1
them 1
checking 1
the 1
girl 1
for 1
supplies 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
their 1
comments 1
theyve 1
found 1
nothing 1
good 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
victim 1
is 1
rue 1
but 1
quickly 1
dismiss 1
the 1
thought 1
shes 1
much 1
too 1
bright 1
to 1
be 1
building 1
a 1
fire 1
like 1
that 1
better 1
clear 1
out 1
so 1
they 1
can 1
get 1
the 1
body 1
before 1
it 1
starts 1
stinking 1
im 1
almost 1
certain 1
thats 1
the 1
brutish 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
there 1
are 1
murmurs 1
of 1
assent 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
pack 1
heading 1
toward 1
me 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
im 1
here 1
how 1
could 1
they 1
and 1
im 1
well 1
concealed 1
in 1
the 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
at 1
least 1
while 1
the 1
sun 1
stays 1
down 1
then 1
my 1
black 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
will 1
turn 1
from 1
camouflage 1
to 1
trouble 1
if 1
they 1
just 1
keep 1
moving 1
they 1
will 1
pass 1
me 1
and 1
be 1
gone 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
but 1
the 1
careers 1
stop 1
in 1
the 1
clearing 1
about 1
ten 1
yards 1
from 1
my 1
tree 1
they 1
have 1
flashlights 1
torches 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
an 1
arm 1
here 1
a 1
boot 1
there 1
through 1
the 1
breaks 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
stone 1
not 1
even 1
daring 1
to 1
breathe 1
have 1

unless 1
she 1
isnt 1
dead 1

dead 1
i 1
stuck 1
her 1
myself 1

to 1
track 1
her 1
down 1
twice 1
i 1
said 1
shes 1
dead 1
an 1
argument 1
breaks 1
out 1
until 1
one 1
tribute 1
silences 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
wasting 1
time 1
ill 1
go 1
finish 1
her 1
and 1
lets 1
move 1
on 1
i 1
almost 1
fall 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
the 1
voice 1
belongs 1
to 1
peeta 1
thank 1
goodness 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
foresight 1
to 1
belt 1
myself 1
in 1
ive 1
rolled 1
sideways 1
off 1
the 1
fork 1
and 1
im 1
facing 1
the 1
ground 1
held 1
in 1
place 1
by 1
the 1
belt 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
my 1
feet 1
straddling 1
the 1
pack 1
inside 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
braced 1
against 1
the 1
trunk 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
rustling 1
when 1
i 1
tipped 1
sideways 1
but 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
been 1
too 1
caught 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
argument 1
to 1
catch 1
it 1
go 1
on 1
then 1
lover 1
boy 1
says 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
see 1
for 1
yourself 1
i 1
just 1
get 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
peeta 1
lit 1
by 1
a 1
torch 1
heading 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
his 1
face 1
is 1
swollen 1
with 1
bruises 1
theres 1
a 1
bloody 1
bandage 1
on 1
one 1
arm 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
his 1
gait 1
hes 1
limping 1
somewhat 1
i 1
remember 1
him 1
shaking 1
him 1
his 1
head 1
telling 1
me 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
fight 1
for 1
the 1
supplies 1
when 1
all 1
along 1
all 1
along 1
hed 1
planned 1
to 1
throw 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
things 1
just 1
the 1
opposite 1
of 1
what 1
haymitch 1
had 1
mid 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
okay 1
i 1
can 1
stomach 1
that 1
seeing 1
all 1
those 1
supplies 1
was 1
tempting 1
but 1
this 1
this 1
other 1
thing 1
this 1
teaming 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
career 1
wolf 1
pack 1
to 1
hunt 1
down 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
no 1
one 1
from 1
district 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
doing 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
career 1
tributes 1
are 1
overly 1
vicious 1
arrogant 1
better 1
fed 1
but 1
only 1
because 1
theyre 1
the 1
capitols 1
lapdogs 1
universally 1
solidly 1
hated 1
by 1
all 1
but 1
those 1
from 1
their 1
own 1
districts 1
i 1
can 1
imagine 1
the 1
things 1
theyre 1
saying 1
about 1
him 1
back 1
home 1
now 1
and 1
peeta 1
had 1
the 1
gall 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
disgrace 1
obviously 1
the 1
noble 1
boy 1
on 1
the 1
rooftop 1
was 1
playing 1
just 1
one 1
more 1
game 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
his 1
last 1
i 1
will 1
eagerly 1
watch 1
the 1
night 1
skies 1
for 1
signs 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
kill 1
him 1
first 1
myself 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
are 1
silent 1
until 1
he 1
gets 1
out 1
of 1
ear 1
shot 1
then 1
use 1
hushed 1
voices 1
why 1
dont 1
we 1
just 1
kill 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
get 1
it 1
over 1
with 1
let 1
him 1
tag 1
along 1
whats 1
the 1
harm 1
and 1
hes 1
handy 1
with 1
that 1
knife 1
is 1
he 1
thats 1
news 1
what 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
interesting 1
things 1
im 1
learning 1
about 1
my 1
friend 1
peeta 1
today 1
besides 1
hes 1
our 1
best 1
chance 1
of 1
finding 1
her 1
it 1
takes 1
me 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
register 1
that 1
the 1
her 1
theyre 1
referring 1
to 1
is 1
me 1
why 1
you 1
think 1
she 1
bought 1
into 1
that 1
sappy 1
romance 1
stuff 1
she 1
might 1
have 1
seemed 1
pretty 1
simpleminded 1
to 1
me 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
think 1
about 1
her 1
spinning 1
around 1
in 1
that 1
dress 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
puke 1
wish 1
we 1
knew 1
how 1
she 1
got 1
that 1
eleven 1
bet 1
you 1
lover 1
boy 1
knows 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
peeta 1
returning 1
silences 1
them 1
was 1
she 1
dead 1
asks 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
no 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
says 1
peeta 1
just 1
then 1
the 1
cannon 1
fires 1
ready 1
to 1
move 1
on 1
the 1
career 1
pack 1
sets 1
off 1
at 1
a 1
run 1
just 1
as 1
dawn 1
begins 1
to 1
break 1
and 1
birdsong 1
fills 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
remain 1
in 1
my 1
awkward 1
position 1
muscles 1
trembling 1
with 1
exertion 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
longer 1
then 1
hoist 1
myself 1
back 1
onto 1
my 1
branch 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
to 1
get 1
going 1
but 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
lie 1
there 1
digesting 1
what 1
ive 1
heard 1
not 1
only 1
is 1
peeta 1
with 1
the 1
careers 1
hes 1
helping 1
them 1
find 1
me 1
the 1
simpleminded 1
girl 1
who 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
seriously 1
because 1
of 1
her 1
eleven 1
because 1
she 1
can 1
use 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
which 1
peeta 1
knows 1
better 1
than 1
anyone 1
but 1
he 1
hasnt 1
told 1
them 1
yet 1
is 1
he 1
saving 1
that 1
information 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
its 1
all 1
that 1
keeps 1
him 1
alive 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
pretending 1
to 1
love 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
suddenly 1
the 1
birds 1
fall 1
silent 1
then 1
one 1
gives 1
a 1
highpitched 1
warning 1
call 1
a 1
single 1
note 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
when 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
was 1
caught 1
high 1
above 1
the 1
dying 1
campfire 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
materializes 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
huge 1
metal 1
teeth 1
drops 1
down 1
slowly 1
gently 1
the 1
dead 1
tribute 1
girl 1
is 1
lifted 1
into 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
then 1
it 1
vanishes 1
the 1
birds 1
resume 1
their 1
song 1
move 1
i 1
whisper 1
to 1
myself 1
i 1
wriggle 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
roll 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
place 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
pack 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
while 1
ive 1
been 1
concealed 1
by 1
darkness 1
and 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
the 1
willow 1
branches 1
it 1
has 1
probably 1
been 1
difficult 1
for 1
the 1
cameras 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
good 1
shot 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
tracking 1
me 1
now 1
though 1
the 1
minute 1
i 1
hit 1
the 1
ground 1
im 1
guaranteed 1
a 1
closeup 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
have 1
been 1
beside 1
themselves 1
knowing 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
that 1
i 1
overheard 1
the 1
careers 1
talking 1
that 1
i 1
discovered 1
peeta 1
was 1
with 1
them 1
until 1
i 1
work 1
out 1
exactly 1
how 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
play 1
that 1
id 1
better 1
at 1
least 1
act 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
things 1
not 1
perplexed 1
certainly 1
not 1
confused 1
or 1
frightened 1
no 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
look 1
one 1
step 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
game 1
so 1
as 1
i 1
slide 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
foliage 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
dawn 1
light 1
i 1
pause 1
a 1
second 1
giving 1
the 1
cameras 1
time 1
to 1
lock 1
on 1
me 1
then 1
i 1
cock 1
my 1
head 1
slightly 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
and 1
give 1
a 1
knowing 1
smile 1
there 1
let 1
them 1
figure 1
out 1
what 1
that 1
means 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
my 1
snares 1
maybe 1
its 1
imprudent 1
to 1
check 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
others 1
so 1
close 1
but 1
have 1
to 1
too 1
many 1
years 1
of 1
hunting 1
i 1
guess 1
and 1
the 1
lure 1
of 1
possible 1
meat 1
im 1
rewarded 1
with 1
one 1
fine 1
rabbit 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
ive 1
cleaned 1
and 1
gutted 1
the 1
animal 1
leaving 1
the 1
head 1
feet 1
tail 1
skin 1
and 1
innards 1
under 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
leaves 1
im 1
wishing 1
for 1
a 1
fire 1
eating 1
raw 1
rabbit 1
can 1
give 1
you 1
rabbit 1
fever 1
a 1
lesson 1
i 1
learned 1
the 1
hard 1
way 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
tribute 1
i 1
hurry 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
camp 1
sure 1
enough 1
the 1
coals 1
of 1
her 1
dying 1
fire 1
are 1
still 1
hot 1
i 1
cut 1
up 1
the 1
rabbit 1
fashion 1
a 1
spit 1
out 1
of 1
branches 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
over 1
the 1
coals 1
im 1
glad 1
for 1
the 1
cameras 1
now 1
i 1
want 1
sponsors 1
to 1
see 1
i 1
can 1
hunt 1
that 1
im 1
a 1
good 1
bet 1
because 1
i 1
wont 1
be 1
lured 1
into 1
traps 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
the 1
others 1
will 1
by 1
hunger 1
while 1
the 1
rabbit 1
cooks 1
i 1
grind 1
up 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
charred 1
branch 1
and 1
set 1
about 1
camouflaging 1
my 1
orange 1
pack 1
the 1
black 1
tones 1
it 1
down 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
mud 1
would 1
definitely 1
help 1
of 1
course 1
to 1
have 1
mud 1
id 1
need 1
water 1
i 1
pull 1
on 1
my 1
gear 1
grab 1
my 1
spit 1
kick 1
some 1
dirt 1
over 1
the 1
coals 1
and 1
take 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
opposite 1
direction 1
the 1
careers 1
went 1
i 1
eat 1
half 1
the 1
rabbit 1
as 1
i 1
go 1
then 1
wrap 1
up 1
the 1
leftovers 1
in 1
my 1
plastic 1
for 1
later 1
the 1
meat 1
stops 1
the 1
grumbling 1
in 1
my 1
stomach 1
but 1
does 1
little 1
to 1
quench 1
my 1
thirst 1
water 1
is 1
my 1
top 1
priority 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
hike 1
along 1
i 1
feel 1
certain 1
im 1
still 1
holding 1
the 1
screen 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
so 1
im 1
careful 1
to 1
continue 1
to 1
hide 1
my 1
emotions 1
but 1
what 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
claudius 1
templesmith 1
must 1
be 1
having 1
with 1
his 1
guest 1
commentators 1
dissecting 1
peetas 1
behavior 1
my 1
reaction 1
what 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
has 1
peeta 1
revealed 1
his 1
true 1
colors 1
how 1
does 1
this 1
affect 1
the 1
betting 1
odds 1
will 1
we 1
lose 1
sponsors 1
do 1
we 1
even 1
have 1
sponsors 1
yes 1
i 1
feel 1
certain 1
we 1
do 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
did 1
certainly 1
peeta 1
has 1
thrown 1
a 1
wrench 1
into 1
our 1
starcrossed 1
lover 1
dynamic 1
or 1
has 1
he 1
maybe 1
since 1
he 1
hasnt 1
spoken 1
much 1
about 1
me 1
we 1
can 1
still 1
get 1
some 1
mileage 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
maybe 1
people 1
will 1
think 1
its 1
something 1
we 1
plotted 1
together 1
if 1
i 1
seem 1
like 1
it 1
amuses 1
me 1
now 1
the 1
sun 1
rises 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
even 1
through 1
the 1
canopy 1
it 1
seems 1
overly 1
bright 1
i 1
coat 1
my 1
lips 1
in 1
some 1
grease 1
from 1
the 1
rabbit 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
panting 1
but 1
its 1
no 1
use 1
its 1
only 1
been 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
im 1
dehydrating 1
fast 1
i 1
try 1
and 1
think 1
of 1
everything 1
i 1
know 1
about 1
finding 1
water 1
it 1
runs 1
downhill 1
so 1
in 1
fact 1
continuing 1
down 1
into 1
this 1
valley 1
isnt 1
a 1
bad 1
thing 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
just 1
locate 1
a 1
game 1
trail 1
or 1
spot 1
a 1
particularly 1
green 1
patch 1
of 1
vegetation 1
these 1
might 1
help 1
me 1
along 1
but 1
nothing 1
seems 1
to 1
change 1
theres 1
just 1
the 1
slight 1
gradual 1
slope 1
the 1
birds 1
the 1
sameness 1
to 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
wears 1
on 1
i 1
know 1
im 1
headed 1
for 1
trouble 1
what 1
little 1
urine 1
ive 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
pass 1
is 1
a 1
dark 1
brown 1
my 1
head 1
is 1
aching 1
and 1
theres 1
a 1
dry 1
patch 1
on 1
my 1
tongue 1
that 1
refuses 1
to 1
moisten 1
the 1
sun 1
hurts 1
my 1
eyes 1
so 1
i 1
dig 1
out 1
my 1
sunglasses 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
they 1
do 1
something 1
funny 1
to 1
my 1
vision 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
stuff 1
them 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
pack 1
its 1
late 1
afternoon 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
ive 1
found 1
help 1
i 1
spot 1
a 1
cluster 1
of 1
berry 1
bushes 1
and 1
hurry 1
to 1
strip 1
the 1
fruit 1
to 1
suck 1
the 1
sweet 1
juices 1
from 1
the 1
skins 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
im 1
holding 1
them 1
to 1
my 1
lips 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
hard 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
what 1
i 1
thought 1
were 1
blueberries 1
have 1
a 1
slightly 1
different 1
shape 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
break 1
one 1
open 1
the 1
insides 1
are 1
bloodred 1
i 1
dont 1
recognize 1
these 1
berries 1
perhaps 1
they 1
are 1
edible 1
but 1
im 1
guessing 1
this 1
is 1
some 1
evil 1
trick 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
even 1
the 1
plant 1
instructor 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
made 1
a 1
point 1
of 1
telling 1
us 1
to 1
avoid 1
berries 1
unless 1
you 1
were 1
percent 1
sure 1
they 1
werent 1
toxic 1
something 1
i 1
already 1
knew 1
but 1
im 1
so 1
thirsty 1
it 1
takes 1
her 1
reminder 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
strength 1
to 1
fling 1
them 1
away 1
fatigue 1
is 1
beginning 1
to 1
settle 1
on 1
me 1
but 1
its 1
not 1
the 1
usual 1
tiredness 1
that 1
follows 1
a 1
long 1
hike 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
rest 1
frequently 1
although 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
only 1
cure 1
for 1
what 1
ails 1
me 1
requires 1
continued 1
searching 1
i 1
try 1
a 1
new 1
tactic 1
climbing 1
a 1
tree 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
i 1
dare 1
in 1
my 1
shaky 1
state 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
any 1
signs 1
of 1
water 1
but 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
theres 1
the 1
same 1
unrelenting 1
stretch 1
of 1
forest 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
until 1
nightfall 1
i 1
walk 1
until 1
im 1
stumbling 1
over 1
my 1
own 1
feet 1
exhausted 1
i 1
haul 1
myself 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
belt 1
myself 1
in 1
ive 1
no 1
appetite 1
but 1
i 1
suck 1
on 1
a 1
rabbit 1
bone 1
just 1
to 1
give 1
my 1
mouth 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
night 1
falls 1
the 1
anthem 1
plays 1
and 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
apparently 1
from 1
district 1
the 1
one 1
peeta 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
finish 1
off 1
my 1
fear 1
of 1
the 1
career 1
pack 1
is 1
minor 1
compared 1
to 1
my 1
burning 1
thirst 1
besides 1
they 1
were 1
heading 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
now 1
they 1
too 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
rest 1
with 1
the 1
scarcity 1
of 1
water 1
they 1
may 1
even 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
for 1
refills 1
maybe 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
course 1
for 1
me 1
as 1
well 1
morning 1
brings 1
distress 1
my 1
heads 1
throbs 1
with 1
every 1
beat 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
simple 1
movements 1
send 1
stabs 1
of 1
pain 1
through 1
my 1
joints 1
i 1
fall 1
rather 1
than 1
jump 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
it 1
takes 1
several 1
minutes 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
assemble 1
my 1
gear 1
somewhere 1
inside 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
this 1
is 1
wrong 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
acting 1
with 1
more 1
caution 1
moving 1
with 1
more 1
urgency 1
but 1
my 1
mind 1
seems 1
foggy 1
and 1
forming 1
a 1
plan 1
is 1
hard 1
i 1
lean 1
back 1
against 1
the 1
trunk 1
of 1
my 1
tree 1
one 1
finger 1
gingerly 1
stroking 1
the 1
sandpaper 1
surface 1
of 1
my 1
tongue 1
as 1
i 1
assess 1
my 1
options 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
get 1
water 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
no 1
good 1
id 1
never 1
make 1
it 1
hope 1
for 1
rain 1
theres 1
not 1
a 1
cloud 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
keep 1
looking 1
yes 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
only 1
chance 1
but 1
then 1
another 1
thought 1
hits 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
surge 1
of 1
anger 1
that 1
follows 1
brings 1
me 1
to 1
me 1
senses 1
haymitch 1
he 1
could 1
send 1
me 1
water 1
press 1
a 1
button 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
delivered 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
silver 1
parachute 1
in 1
minutes 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
sponsors 1
at 1
least 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
who 1
could 1
afford 1
a 1
pint 1
of 1
liquid 1
for 1
me 1
yes 1
its 1
pricey 1
but 1
these 1
people 1
theyre 1
made 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
theyll 1
be 1
betting 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
well 1
perhaps 1
haymitch 1
doesnt 1
realize 1
how 1
deep 1
my 1
need 1
is 1
i 1
say 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
i 1
dare 1
water 1
i 1
wait 1
hopefully 1
for 1
a 1
parachute 1
to 1
descend 1
from 1
the 1
sky 1
but 1
nothing 1
is 1
forthcoming 1
something 1
is 1
wrong 1
am 1
i 1
deluded 1
about 1
having 1
sponsors 1
or 1
has 1
peetas 1
behavior 1
made 1
them 1
all 1
hang 1
back 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
it 1
theres 1
someone 1
out 1
there 1
who 1
wants 1
to 1
buy 1
me 1
water 1
only 1
haymitch 1
is 1
refusing 1
to 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
through 1
as 1
my 1
mentor 1
he 1
gets 1
to 1
control 1
the 1
flow 1
of 1
gifts 1
from 1
the 1
sponsors 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
hates 1
me 1
hes 1
made 1
that 1
clear 1
enough 1
but 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
die 1
from 1
this 1
he 1
cant 1
do 1
that 1
can 1
he 1
if 1
a 1
mentor 1
mistreats 1
his 1
tributes 1
hell 1
be 1
held 1
accountable 1
by 1
the 1
viewers 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
even 1
haymitch 1
wouldnt 1
risk 1
that 1
would 1
he 1
say 1
what 1
you 1
will 1
about 1
my 1
fellow 1
traders 1
in 1
the 1
hob 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
theyd 1
welcome 1
him 1
back 1
there 1
if 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
die 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
where 1
would 1
he 1
get 1
his 1
liquor 1
so 1
what 1
is 1
he 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
suffer 1
for 1
defying 1
him 1
is 1
he 1
directing 1
all 1
the 1
sponsors 1
toward 1
peeta 1
is 1
he 1
just 1
too 1
drunk 1
to 1
even 1
notice 1
whats 1
going 1
on 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
somehow 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
that 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
hes 1
trying 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
off 1
by 1
neglect 1
either 1
he 1
has 1
in 1
fact 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
unpleasant 1
way 1
genuinely 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
prepare 1
me 1
for 1
this 1
then 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
i 1
bury 1
my 1
face 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
theres 1
no 1
danger 1
of 1
tears 1
now 1
i 1
couldnt 1
produce 1
one 1
to 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
what 1
is 1
haymitch 1
doing 1
despite 1
my 1
anger 1
hatred 1
and 1
suspicions 1
a 1
small 1
voice 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
my 1
head 1
whispers 1
an 1
answer 1
maybe 1
hes 1
sending 1
you 1
a 1
message 1
it 1
says 1
a 1
message 1
saying 1
what 1
then 1
i 1
know 1
theres 1
only 1
one 1
good 1
reason 1
haymitch 1
could 1
be 1
withholding 1
water 1
from 1
me 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
ive 1
almost 1
found 1
it 1
i 1
grit 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
pull 1
myself 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
my 1
backpack 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
tripled 1
in 1
weight 1
i 1
find 1
a 1
broken 1
branch 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
for 1
a 1
walking 1
stick 1
and 1
i 1
start 1
off 1
the 1
suns 1
beating 1
down 1
even 1
more 1
searing 1
than 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
days 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
piece 1
of 1
leather 1
drying 1
and 1
cracking 1
in 1
the 1
heat 1
every 1
step 1
is 1
an 1
effort 1
but 1
i 1
refuse 1
to 1
stop 1
i 1
refuse 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
if 1
i 1
sit 1
theres 1
a 1
good 1
chance 1
i 1
wont 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
again 1
that 1
i 1
wont 1
even 1
remember 1
my 1
task 1
what 1
easy 1
prey 1
i 1
am 1
any 1
tribute 1
even 1
tiny 1
rue 1
could 1
take 1
me 1
right 1
now 1
merely 1
shove 1
me 1
over 1
and 1
kill 1
me 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
knife 1
and 1
id 1
have 1
little 1
strength 1
to 1
resist 1
but 1
if 1
anyone 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
they 1
ignore 1
me 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
million 1
miles 1
from 1
another 1
living 1
soul 1
not 1
alone 1
though 1
no 1
theyve 1
surely 1
got 1
a 1
camera 1
tracking 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
think 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
years 1
of 1
watching 1
tributes 1
starve 1
freeze 1
bleed 1
and 1
dehydrate 1
to 1
death 1
unless 1
theres 1
a 1
really 1
good 1
fight 1
going 1
on 1
somewhere 1
im 1
being 1
featured 1
my 1
thoughts 1
turn 1
to 1
prim 1
its 1
likely 1
she 1
wont 1
be 1
watching 1
me 1
live 1
but 1
theyll 1
show 1
updates 1
at 1
the 1
school 1
during 1
lunch 1
for 1
her 1
sake 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
look 1
as 1
least 1
desperate 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
but 1
by 1
afternoon 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
end 1
is 1
coming 1
my 1
legs 1
are 1
shaking 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
too 1
quick 1
i 1
keep 1
forgetting 1
exactly 1
what 1
im 1
doing 1
ive 1
stumbled 1
repeatedly 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
regain 1
my 1
feet 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
stick 1
slides 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
me 1
i 1
finally 1
tumble 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
i 1
let 1
my 1
eyes 1
close 1
i 1
have 1
misjudged 1
haymitch 1
he 1
has 1
no 1
intention 1
of 1
helping 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
think 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
bad 1
here 1
the 1
air 1
is 1
less 1
hot 1
signifying 1
evenings 1
approach 1
theres 1
a 1
slight 1
sweet 1
scent 1
that 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
lilies 1
my 1
fingers 1
stroke 1
the 1
smooth 1
ground 1
sliding 1
easily 1
across 1
the 1
top 1
this 1
is 1
an 1
okay 1
place 1
to 1
die 1
i 1
think 1
my 1
fingertips 1
make 1
small 1
swirling 1
patterns 1
in 1
the 1
cool 1
slippery 1
earth 1
i 1
love 1
mud 1
i 1
think 1
how 1
many 1
times 1
ive 1
tracked 1
game 1
with 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
its 1
soft 1
readable 1
surface 1
good 1
for 1
bee 1
stings 1
too 1
mud 1
mud 1
mud 1
my 1
eyes 1
fly 1
open 1
and 1
i 1
dig 1
my 1
fingers 1
into 1
the 1
earth 1
it 1
is 1
mud 1
my 1
nose 1
lifts 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
those 1
are 1
lilies 1
pond 1
lilies 1
i 1
crawl 1
now 1
through 1
the 1
mud 1
dragging 1
myself 1
toward 1
the 1
scent 1
five 1
yards 1
from 1
where 1
i 1
fell 1
i 1
crawl 1
through 1
a 1
tangle 1
of 1
plants 1
into 1
a 1
pond 1
floating 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
yellow 1
flowers 1
in 1
bloom 1
are 1
my 1
beautiful 1
lilies 1
its 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
not 1
to 1
plunge 1
my 1
face 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
gulp 1
down 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
hold 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
enough 1
sense 1
left 1
to 1
abstain 1
with 1
trembling 1
hands 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
my 1
flask 1
and 1
fill 1
it 1
with 1
water 1
i 1
add 1
what 1
i 1
remember 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
right 1
number 1
of 1
drops 1
of 1
iodine 1
for 1
purifying 1
it 1
the 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
of 1
waiting 1
is 1
agony 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
it 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
but 1
its 1
certainly 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
stand 1
slowly 1
easy 1
now 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
i 1
take 1
one 1
swallow 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
wait 1
then 1
another 1
over 1
the 1
next 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
i 1
drink 1
the 1
entire 1
half 1
gallon 1
then 1
a 1
second 1
i 1
prepare 1
another 1
before 1
i 1
retire 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
where 1
i 1
continue 1
sipping 1
eating 1
rabbit 1
and 1
even 1
indulge 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
precious 1
crackers 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
anthem 1
plays 1
i 1
feel 1
remarkably 1
better 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
faces 1
tonight 1
no 1
tributes 1
died 1
today 1
tomorrow 1
ill 1
stay 1
here 1
resting 1
camouflaging 1
my 1
backpack 1
with 1
mud 1
catching 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
little 1
fish 1
i 1
saw 1
as 1
i 1
sipped 1
digging 1
up 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
the 1
pond 1
lilies 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
nice 1
meal 1
i 1
snuggle 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
my 1
water 1
bottle 1
for 1
dear 1
life 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
later 1
the 1
stampede 1
of 1
feet 1
shakes 1
me 1
from 1
slumber 1
i 1
look 1
around 1
in 1
bewilderment 1
its 1
not 1
yet 1
dawn 1
but 1
my 1
stinging 1
eyes 1
can 1
see 1
it 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
hard 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
wall 1
of 1
fire 1
descending 1
on 1
me 1
my 1
first 1
impulse 1
is 1
to 1
scramble 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
but 1
im 1
belted 1
in 1
somehow 1
my 1
fumbling 1
fingers 1
release 1
the 1
buckle 1
and 1
i 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
in 1
a 1
heap 1
still 1
snarled 1
in 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
theres 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
packing 1
fortunately 1
my 1
backpack 1
and 1
water 1
bottle 1
are 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
bag 1
i 1
shove 1
in 1
the 1
belt 1
hoist 1
the 1
bag 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
flee 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
transformed 1
to 1
flame 1
and 1
smoke 1
burning 1
branches 1
crack 1
from 1
trees 1
and 1
fall 1
in 1
showers 1
of 1
sparks 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
is 1
follow 1
the 1
others 1
the 1
rabbits 1
and 1
deer 1
and 1
i 1
even 1
spot 1
a 1
wild 1
dog 1
pack 1
shooting 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
trust 1
their 1
sense 1
of 1
direction 1
because 1
their 1
instincts 1
are 1
sharper 1
than 1
mine 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
much 1
faster 1
flying 1
through 1
the 1
underbrush 1
so 1
gracefully 1
as 1
my 1
boots 1
catch 1
on 1
roots 1
and 1
fallen 1
tree 1
limbs 1
that 1
theres 1
no 1
way 1
i 1
can 1
keep 1
apace 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
heat 1
is 1
horrible 1
but 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
heat 1
is 1
the 1
smoke 1
which 1
threatens 1
to 1
suffocate 1
me 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
i 1
pull 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
shirt 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
nose 1
grateful 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
soaked 1
in 1
sweat 1
and 1
it 1
offers 1
a 1
thin 1
veil 1
of 1
protection 1
and 1
i 1
run 1
choking 1
my 1
bag 1
banging 1
against 1
my 1
back 1
my 1
face 1
cut 1
with 1
branches 1
that 1
materialize 1
from 1
the 1
gray 1
haze 1
without 1
warning 1
because 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
am 1
supposed 1
to 1
run 1
this 1
was 1
no 1
tributes 1
campfire 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
control 1
no 1
accidental 1
occurrence 1
the 1
flames 1
that 1
bear 1
down 1
on 1
me 1
have 1
an 1
unnatural 1
height 1
a 1
uniformity 1
that 1
marks 1
them 1
as 1
humanmade 1
machinemade 1
gamemakermade 1
things 1
have 1
been 1
too 1
quiet 1
today 1
no 1
deaths 1
perhaps 1
no 1
fights 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
audience 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
will 1
be 1
getting 1
bored 1
claiming 1
that 1
these 1
games 1
are 1
verging 1
on 1
dullness 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
the 1
games 1
must 1
not 1
do 1
its 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
motivation 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
career 1
pack 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
probably 1
spread 1
far 1
and 1
thin 1
across 1
the 1
arena 1
this 1
fire 1
is 1
designed 1
to 1
flush 1
us 1
out 1
to 1
drive 1
us 1
together 1
it 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
original 1
device 1
ive 1
seen 1
but 1
its 1
very 1
very 1
effective 1
i 1
hurdle 1
over 1
a 1
burning 1
log 1
not 1
high 1
enough 1
the 1
tail 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
jacket 1
catches 1
on 1
fire 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
stop 1
to 1
rip 1
it 1
from 1
my 1
body 1
and 1
stamp 1
out 1
the 1
flames 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
dare 1
leave 1
the 1
jacket 1
scorched 1
and 1
smoldering 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
take 1
the 1
risk 1
of 1
shoving 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
hoping 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
air 1
will 1
quell 1
what 1
i 1
havent 1
extinguished 1
this 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
what 1
i 1
carry 1
on 1
my 1
back 1
and 1
its 1
little 1
enough 1
to 1
survive 1
with 1
in 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
minutes 1
my 1
throat 1
and 1
nose 1
are 1
burning 1
the 1
coughing 1
begins 1
soon 1
after 1
and 1
my 1
lungs 1
begin 1
to 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
actually 1
being 1
cooked 1
discomfort 1
turns 1
to 1
distress 1
until 1
each 1
breath 1
sends 1
a 1
searing 1
pain 1
through 1
my 1
chest 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
take 1
cover 1
under 1
a 1
stone 1
outcropping 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
vomiting 1
begins 1
and 1
i 1
lose 1
my 1
meager 1
supper 1
and 1
whatever 1
water 1
has 1
remained 1
in 1
my 1
stomach 1
crouching 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
i 1
retch 1
until 1
theres 1
nothing 1
left 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
keep 1
moving 1
but 1
im 1
trembling 1
and 1
lightheaded 1
now 1
gasping 1
for 1
air 1
i 1
allow 1
myself 1
about 1
a 1
spoonful 1
of 1
water 1
to 1
rinse 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
spit 1
then 1
take 1
a 1
few 1
swallows 1
from 1
my 1
bottle 1
you 1
get 1
one 1
minute 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
one 1
minute 1
to 1
rest 1
i 1
take 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
reorder 1
my 1
supplies 1
wad 1
up 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
messily 1
stuff 1
everything 1
into 1
the 1
backpack 1
my 1
minutes 1
up 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
time 1
to 1
move 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
smoke 1
has 1
clouded 1
my 1
thoughts 1
the 1
swiftfooted 1
animals 1
that 1
were 1
my 1
compass 1
have 1
left 1
me 1
behind 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
havent 1
been 1
in 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
before 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
sizable 1
rocks 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
im 1
sheltering 1
against 1
on 1
my 1
earlier 1
travels 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
driving 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
to 1
a 1
whole 1
new 1
terrain 1
filled 1
with 1
new 1
dangers 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
found 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
peace 1
at 1
the 1
pond 1
when 1
this 1
attack 1
began 1
would 1
there 1
be 1
any 1
way 1
i 1
could 1
travel 1
parallel 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
work 1
my 1
way 1
back 1
there 1
to 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
water 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
wall 1
of 1
fire 1
must 1
have 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
it 1
wont 1
burn 1
indefinitely 1
not 1
because 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
couldnt 1
keep 1
it 1
fueled 1
but 1
because 1
again 1
that 1
would 1
invite 1
accusations 1
of 1
boredom 1
from 1
the 1
audience 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
back 1
behind 1
the 1
fire 1
line 1
i 1
could 1
avoid 1
meeting 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
careers 1
ive 1
just 1
decided 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
loop 1
back 1
around 1
although 1
it 1
will 1
require 1
miles 1
of 1
travel 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
inferno 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
very 1
circuitous 1
route 1
back 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
fireball 1
blasts 1
into 1
the 1
rock 1
about 1
two 1
feet 1
from 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
spring 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
my 1
ledge 1
energized 1
by 1
renewed 1
fear 1
the 1
game 1
has 1
taken 1
a 1
twist 1
the 1
fire 1
was 1
just 1
to 1
get 1
us 1
moving 1
now 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
get 1
to 1
see 1
some 1
real 1
fun 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
next 1
hiss 1
i 1
flatten 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
not 1
taking 1
time 1
to 1
look 1
the 1
fireball 1
hits 1
a 1
tree 1
off 1
to 1
my 1
left 1
engulfing 1
it 1
in 1
flames 1
to 1
remain 1
still 1
is 1
death 1
im 1
barely 1
on 1
my 1
feet 1
before 1
the 1
third 1
ball 1
hits 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
lying 1
sending 1
a 1
pillar 1
of 1
fire 1
up 1
behind 1
me 1
time 1
loses 1
meaning 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
frantically 1
try 1
to 1
dodge 1
the 1
attacks 1
i 1
cant 1
see 1
where 1
theyre 1
being 1
launched 1
from 1
but 1
its 1
not 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
the 1
angles 1
are 1
not 1
extreme 1
enough 1
probably 1
this 1
whole 1
segment 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
has 1
been 1
armed 1
with 1
precision 1
launchers 1
that 1
are 1
concealed 1
in 1
trees 1
or 1
rocks 1
somewhere 1
in 1
a 1
cool 1
and 1
spotless 1
room 1
a 1
gamemaker 1
sits 1
at 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
controls 1
fingers 1
on 1
the 1
triggers 1
that 1
could 1
end 1
my 1
life 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
needed 1
is 1
a 1
direct 1
hit 1
whatever 1
vague 1
plan 1
i 1
had 1
conceived 1
regarding 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
pond 1
is 1
wiped 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
as 1
i 1
zigzag 1
and 1
dive 1
and 1
leap 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
fireballs 1
each 1
one 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
an 1
apple 1
but 1
packs 1
tremendous 1
power 1
on 1
contact 1
every 1
sense 1
i 1
have 1
goes 1
into 1
overdrive 1
as 1
the 1
need 1
to 1
survive 1
takes 1
over 1
theres 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
judge 1
if 1
a 1
move 1
is 1
the 1
correct 1
one 1
when 1
theres 1
a 1
hiss 1
i 1
act 1
or 1
die 1
something 1
keeps 1
me 1
moving 1
forward 1
though 1
a 1
lifetime 1
of 1
watching 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
lets 1
me 1
know 1
that 1
certain 1
areas 1
of 1
the 1
arena 1
are 1
rigged 1
for 1
certain 1
attacks 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
just 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
this 1
section 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
move 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
the 1
launchers 1
i 1
might 1
also 1
then 1
fall 1
straight 1
into 1
a 1
pit 1
of 1
vipers 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
worry 1
about 1
that 1
now 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
scramble 1
along 1
dodging 1
the 1
fireballs 1
i 1
cant 1
say 1
but 1
the 1
attacks 1
finally 1
begin 1
to 1
abate 1
which 1
is 1
good 1
because 1
im 1
retching 1
again 1
this 1
time 1
its 1
an 1
acidic 1
substance 1
that 1
scalds 1
my 1
throat 1
and 1
makes 1
its 1
way 1
into 1
my 1
nose 1
as 1
well 1
im 1
forced 1
to 1
stop 1
as 1
my 1
body 1
convulses 1
trying 1
desperately 1
to 1
rid 1
itself 1
of 1
the 1
poisons 1
ive 1
been 1
sucking 1
in 1
during 1
the 1
attack 1
i 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
hiss 1
the 1
next 1
signal 1
to 1
bolt 1
it 1
doesnt 1
come 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
retching 1
has 1
squeezed 1
tears 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
stinging 1
eyes 1
my 1
clothes 1
are 1
drenched 1
in 1
sweat 1
somehow 1
through 1
the 1
smoke 1
and 1
vomit 1
i 1
pick 1
up 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
singed 1
hair 1
my 1
hand 1
fumbles 1
to 1
my 1
braid 1
and 1
finds 1
a 1
fireball 1
has 1
seared 1
off 1
at 1
least 1
six 1
inches 1
of 1
it 1
strands 1
of 1
blackened 1
hair 1
crumble 1
in 1
my 1
fingers 1
i 1
stare 1
at 1
them 1
fascinated 1
by 1
the 1
transformation 1
when 1
the 1
hissing 1
registers 1
my 1
muscles 1
react 1
only 1
not 1
fast 1
enough 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
fireball 1
crashes 1
into 1
the 1
ground 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
it 1
skids 1
across 1
my 1
right 1
calf 1
seeing 1
my 1
pants 1
leg 1
on 1
fire 1
sends 1
me 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
i 1
twist 1
and 1
scuttle 1
backward 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
shrieking 1
trying 1
to 1
remove 1
myself 1
from 1
the 1
horror 1
when 1
i 1
finally 1
regain 1
enough 1
sense 1
i 1
roll 1
the 1
leg 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
which 1
stifles 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
without 1
thinking 1
i 1
rip 1
away 1
the 1
remaining 1
fabric 1
with 1
my 1
bare 1
hands 1
i 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
blaze 1
set 1
off 1
by 1
the 1
fireball 1
my 1
calf 1
is 1
screaming 1
my 1
hands 1
covered 1
in 1
red 1
welts 1
im 1
shaking 1
too 1
hard 1
to 1
move 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
want 1
to 1
finish 1
me 1
off 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
hear 1
cinnas 1
voice 1
carrying 1
images 1
of 1
rich 1
fabric 1
and 1
sparkling 1
gems 1
katniss 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
fire 1
what 1
a 1
good 1
laugh 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
must 1
be 1
having 1
over 1
that 1
one 1
perhaps 1
cinnas 1
beautiful 1
costumes 1
have 1
even 1
brought 1
on 1
this 1
particular 1
torture 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
couldnt 1
have 1
foreseen 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
hurting 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
cares 1
about 1
me 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
all 1
maybe 1
showing 1
up 1
stark 1
naked 1
in 1
that 1
chariot 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
safer 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
attack 1
is 1
now 1
over 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
dont 1
want 1
me 1
dead 1
not 1
yet 1
anyway 1
everyone 1
knows 1
they 1
could 1
destroy 1
us 1
all 1
within 1
seconds 1
of 1
the 1
opening 1
gong 1
the 1
real 1
sport 1
of 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
is 1
watching 1
the 1
tributes 1
kill 1
one 1
another 1
every 1
so 1
often 1
they 1
do 1
kill 1
a 1
tribute 1
just 1
to 1
remind 1
the 1
players 1
they 1
can 1
but 1
mostly 1
they 1
manipulate 1
us 1
into 1
confronting 1
one 1
another 1
facetoface 1
which 1
means 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
longer 1
being 1
fired 1
at 1
there 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
one 1
other 1
tribute 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
i 1
would 1
drag 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
take 1
cover 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
the 1
smoke 1
is 1
still 1
thick 1
enough 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
i 1
make 1
myself 1
stand 1
and 1
begin 1
to 1
limp 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
of 1
flames 1
that 1
lights 1
up 1
the 1
sky 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
pursuing 1
me 1
any 1
longer 1
except 1
with 1
its 1
stinking 1
black 1
clouds 1
another 1
light 1
daylight 1
begins 1
to 1
softly 1
emerge 1
swirls 1
of 1
smoke 1
catch 1
the 1
sunbeams 1
my 1
visibility 1
is 1
poor 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
maybe 1
fifteen 1
yards 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
a 1
tribute 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
concealed 1
from 1
me 1
here 1
i 1
should 1
draw 1
my 1
knife 1
as 1
a 1
precaution 1
but 1
i 1
doubt 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
for 1
long 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
can 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
compete 1
with 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
calf 1
i 1
hate 1
burns 1
have 1
always 1
hated 1
them 1
even 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
gotten 1
from 1
pulling 1
a 1
pan 1
of 1
bread 1
from 1
the 1
oven 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
worst 1
kind 1
of 1
pain 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
experienced 1
anything 1
like 1
this 1
im 1
so 1
weary 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
notice 1
im 1
in 1
the 1
pool 1
until 1
im 1
ankledeep 1
its 1
springfed 1
bubbling 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
crevice 1
in 1
some 1
rocks 1
and 1
blissfully 1
cool 1
i 1
plunge 1
my 1
hands 1
into 1
the 1
shallow 1
water 1
and 1
feel 1
instant 1
relief 1
isnt 1
that 1
what 1
my 1
mother 1
always 1
says 1
the 1
first 1
treatment 1
for 1
a 1
burn 1
is 1
cold 1
water 1
that 1
it 1
draws 1
out 1
the 1
heat 1
but 1
she 1
means 1
minor 1
burns 1
probably 1
shed 1
recommend 1
it 1
for 1
my 1
hands 1
but 1
what 1
of 1
my 1
calf 1
although 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
examine 1
it 1
im 1
guessing 1
that 1
its 1
an 1
injury 1
in 1
a 1
whole 1
different 1
class 1
i 1
lie 1
on 1
my 1
stomach 1
at 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
pool 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
dangling 1
my 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
examining 1
the 1
little 1
flames 1
on 1
my 1
fingernails 1
that 1
are 1
beginning 1
to 1
chip 1
off 1
good 1
ive 1
had 1
enough 1
fire 1
for 1
a 1
lifetime 1
i 1
bathe 1
the 1
blood 1
and 1
ash 1
from 1
my 1
face 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
recall 1
all 1
i 1
know 1
about 1
burns 1
they 1
are 1
common 1
injuries 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
where 1
we 1
cook 1
and 1
heat 1
our 1
homes 1
with 1
coal 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
mine 1
accidents 1
a 1
family 1
once 1
brought 1
in 1
an 1
unconscious 1
young 1
man 1
pleading 1
with 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
the 1
district 1
doctor 1
whos 1
responsible 1
for 1
treating 1
the 1
miners 1
had 1
written 1
him 1
off 1
told 1
the 1
family 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
home 1
to 1
die 1
but 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
accept 1
this 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
our 1
kitchen 1
table 1
senseless 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
wound 1
on 1
his 1
thigh 1
gaping 1
charred 1
flesh 1
burned 1
clear 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bone 1
before 1
i 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
hunted 1
the 1
entire 1
day 1
haunted 1
by 1
the 1
gruesome 1
leg 1
memories 1
of 1
my 1
fathers 1
death 1
whats 1
funny 1
was 1
prim 1
whos 1
scared 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
shadow 1
stayed 1
and 1
helped 1
my 1
mother 1
says 1
healers 1
are 1
born 1
not 1
made 1
they 1
did 1
their 1
best 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
died 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
doctor 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
my 1
leg 1
is 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
attention 1
but 1
i 1
still 1
cant 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
what 1
if 1
its 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
the 1
mans 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
my 1
bone 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
my 1
mother 1
saying 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
burns 1
severe 1
the 1
victim 1
might 1
not 1
even 1
feel 1
pain 1
because 1
the 1
nerves 1
would 1
be 1
destroyed 1
encouraged 1
by 1
this 1
i 1
sit 1
up 1
and 1
swing 1
my 1
leg 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
almost 1
faint 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
my 1
calf 1
the 1
flesh 1
is 1
a 1
brilliant 1
red 1
covered 1
with 1
blisters 1
i 1
force 1
myself 1
to 1
take 1
deep 1
slow 1
breaths 1
feeling 1
quite 1
certain 1
the 1
cameras 1
are 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
i 1
cant 1
show 1
weakness 1
at 1
this 1
injury 1
not 1
if 1
i 1
want 1
help 1
pity 1
does 1
not 1
get 1
you 1
aid 1
admiration 1
at 1
your 1
refusal 1
to 1
give 1
in 1
does 1
i 1
cut 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
pant 1
leg 1
off 1
at 1
the 1
knee 1
and 1
examine 1
the 1
injury 1
more 1
closely 1
the 1
burned 1
area 1
is 1
about 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
skin 1
is 1
blackened 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
not 1
too 1
bad 1
to 1
soak 1
gingerly 1
i 1
stretch 1
out 1
my 1
leg 1
into 1
the 1
pool 1
propping 1
the 1
heel 1
of 1
my 1
boot 1
on 1
a 1
rock 1
so 1
the 1
leather 1
doesnt 1
get 1
too 1
sodden 1
and 1
sigh 1
because 1
this 1
does 1
offer 1
some 1
relief 1
i 1
know 1
there 1
are 1
herbs 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
find 1
them 1
that 1
would 1
speed 1
the 1
healing 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
quite 1
call 1
them 1
to 1
mind 1
water 1
and 1
time 1
will 1
probably 1
be 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
should 1
i 1
be 1
moving 1
on 1
the 1
smoke 1
is 1
slowly 1
clearing 1
but 1
still 1
too 1
heavy 1
to 1
be 1
healthy 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
continue 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
wont 1
i 1
be 1
walking 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
weapons 1
of 1
the 1
careers 1
besides 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
lift 1
my 1
leg 1
from 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
pain 1
rebounds 1
so 1
intensely 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
slide 1
it 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
are 1
slightly 1
less 1
demanding 1
they 1
can 1
handle 1
small 1
breaks 1
from 1
the 1
pool 1
so 1
i 1
slowly 1
put 1
my 1
gear 1
back 1
in 1
order 1
first 1
i 1
fill 1
my 1
bottle 1
with 1
the 1
pool 1
water 1
treat 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
enough 1
time 1
has 1
passed 1
begin 1
to 1
rehydrate 1
my 1
body 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
force 1
myself 1
to 1
nibble 1
on 1
a 1
cracker 1
which 1
helps 1
settle 1
my 1
stomach 1
i 1
roll 1
up 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
except 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
black 1
marks 1
its 1
relatively 1
unscathed 1
my 1
jackets 1
another 1
matter 1
stinking 1
and 1
scorched 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
back 1
beyond 1
repair 1
i 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
damaged 1
area 1
leaving 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
garment 1
that 1
comes 1
just 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
my 1
ribs 1
but 1
the 1
hoods 1
intact 1
and 1
its 1
far 1
better 1
than 1
nothing 1
despite 1
the 1
pain 1
drowsiness 1
begins 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
id 1
take 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
rest 1
except 1
id 1
be 1
too 1
easy 1
to 1
spot 1
besides 1
abandoning 1
my 1
pool 1
seems 1
impossible 1
i 1
neatly 1
arrange 1
my 1
supplies 1
even 1
settle 1
my 1
pack 1
on 1
my 1
shoulders 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
seem 1
to 1
leave 1
i 1
spot 1
some 1
water 1
plants 1
with 1
edible 1
roots 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
small 1
meal 1
with 1
my 1
last 1
piece 1
of 1
rabbit 1
sip 1
water 1
watch 1
the 1
sun 1
make 1
its 1
slow 1
arc 1
across 1
the 1
sky 1
where 1
would 1
i 1
go 1
anyway 1
that 1
is 1
any 1
safer 1
than 1
here 1
i 1
lean 1
back 1
on 1
my 1
pack 1
overcome 1
by 1
drowsiness 1
if 1
the 1
careers 1
want 1
me 1
let 1
them 1
find 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
before 1
drifting 1
into 1
a 1
stupor 1
let 1
them 1
find 1
me 1
and 1
find 1
me 1
they 1
do 1
its 1
lucky 1
im 1
ready 1
to 1
move 1
on 1
because 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
feet 1
i 1
have 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
minute 1
head 1
start 1
evening 1
has 1
begun 1
to 1
fall 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
awake 1
im 1
up 1
and 1
running 1
splashing 1
across 1
the 1
pool 1
flying 1
into 1
the 1
underbrush 1
my 1
leg 1
slows 1
me 1
down 1
but 1
i 1
sense 1
my 1
pursuers 1
are 1
not 1
as 1
speedy 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
either 1
i 1
hear 1
their 1
coughs 1
their 1
raspy 1
voices 1
calling 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
still 1
they 1
are 1
closing 1
in 1
just 1
like 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
wild 1
dogs 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
my 1
whole 1
life 1
in 1
such 1
circumstances 1
i 1
pick 1
a 1
high 1
tree 1
and 1
begin 1
to 1
climb 1
if 1
running 1
hurt 1
climbing 1
is 1
agonizing 1
because 1
it 1
requires 1
not 1
only 1
exertion 1
but 1
direct 1
contact 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
tree 1
bark 1
im 1
fast 1
though 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
theyve 1
reached 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
my 1
trunk 1
im 1
twenty 1
feet 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
we 1
stop 1
and 1
survey 1
one 1
another 1
i 1
hope 1
they 1
cant 1
hear 1
the 1
pounding 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
this 1
could 1
be 1
it 1
i 1
think 1
what 1
chance 1
do 1
i 1
have 1
against 1
them 1
all 1
six 1
are 1
there 1
the 1
five 1
careers 1
and 1
peeta 1
and 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
is 1
theyre 1
pretty 1
beatup 1
too 1
even 1
so 1
look 1
at 1
their 1
weapons 1
look 1
at 1
their 1
faces 1
grinning 1
and 1
snarling 1
at 1
me 1
a 1
sure 1
kill 1
above 1
them 1
it 1
seems 1
pretty 1
hopeless 1
but 1
then 1
something 1
else 1
registers 1
theyre 1
bigger 1
and 1
stronger 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
theyre 1
also 1
heavier 1
theres 1
a 1
reason 1
its 1
me 1
and 1
not 1
gale 1
who 1
ventures 1
up 1
to 1
pluck 1
the 1
highest 1
fruit 1
or 1
rob 1
the 1
most 1
remote 1
bird 1
nests 1
i 1
must 1
weigh 1
at 1
least 1
fifty 1
or 1
sixty 1
pounds 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
smallest 1
career 1
now 1
i 1
smile 1
hows 1
everything 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
call 1
down 1
cheerfully 1
this 1
takes 1
them 1
aback 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
crowd 1
will 1
love 1
it 1
well 1
enough 1
says 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
yourself 1
its 1
been 1
a 1
bit 1
warm 1
for 1
my 1
taste 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
can 1
almost 1
hear 1
the 1
laughter 1
from 1
the 1
capitol 1
the 1
airs 1
better 1
up 1
here 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
come 1
on 1
up 1
think 1
i 1
will 1
says 1
the 1
same 1
boy 1
here 1
take 1
this 1
cato 1
says 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
she 1
offers 1
him 1
the 1
silver 1
bow 1
and 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
my 1
bow 1
my 1
arrows 1
just 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
makes 1
me 1
so 1
angry 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
scream 1
at 1
myself 1
at 1
that 1
traitor 1
peeta 1
for 1
distracting 1
me 1
from 1
having 1
them 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
make 1
eye 1
contact 1
with 1
him 1
now 1
but 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
intentionally 1
avoiding 1
my 1
gaze 1
as 1
he 1
polishes 1
his 1
knife 1
with 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
his 1
shirt 1
no 1
says 1
cato 1
pushing 1
away 1
the 1
bow 1
ill 1
do 1
better 1
with 1
my 1
sword 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
weapon 1
a 1
short 1
heavy 1
blade 1
at 1
his 1
belt 1
i 1
give 1
cato 1
time 1
to 1
hoist 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
tree 1
before 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
climb 1
again 1
gale 1
always 1
says 1
i 1
remind 1
him 1
of 1
a 1
squirrel 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
can 1
scurry 1
up 1
even 1
the 1
slenderest 1
limb 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
my 1
weight 1
but 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
practice 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
place 1
your 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
im 1
another 1
thirty 1
feet 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
crack 1
and 1
look 1
down 1
to 1
see 1
cato 1
flailing 1
as 1
he 1
and 1
a 1
branch 1
go 1
down 1
he 1
hits 1
the 1
ground 1
hard 1
and 1
im 1
hoping 1
he 1
possibly 1
broke 1
his 1
neck 1
when 1
he 1
gets 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
swearing 1
like 1
a 1
fiend 1
the 1
girl 1
with 1
the 1
arrows 1
glimmer 1
i 1
hear 1
someone 1
call 1
her 1
ugh 1
the 1
names 1
the 1
people 1
in 1
district 1
give 1
their 1
children 1
are 1
so 1
ridiculous 1
anyway 1
glimmer 1
scales 1
the 1
tree 1
until 1
the 1
branches 1
begin 1
to 1
crack 1
under 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
then 1
has 1
the 1
good 1
sense 1
to 1
stop 1
im 1
at 1
least 1
eighty 1
feet 1
high 1
now 1
she 1
tries 1
to 1
shoot 1
me 1
and 1
its 1
immediately 1
evident 1
that 1
shes 1
incompetent 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
arrows 1
gets 1
lodged 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
near 1
me 1
though 1
and 1
im 1
able 1
to 1
seize 1
it 1
i 1
wave 1
it 1
teasingly 1
above 1
her 1
head 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
sole 1
purpose 1
of 1
retrieving 1
it 1
when 1
actually 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
if 1
i 1
ever 1
get 1
the 1
chance 1
i 1
could 1
kill 1
them 1
everyone 1
of 1
them 1
if 1
those 1
silver 1
weapons 1
were 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
the 1
careers 1
regroup 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
them 1
growling 1
conspiratorially 1
among 1
themselves 1
furious 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
them 1
look 1
foolish 1
but 1
twilight 1
has 1
arrived 1
and 1
their 1
window 1
of 1
attack 1
on 1
me 1
is 1
closing 1
finally 1
i 1
hear 1
peeta 1
say 1
harshly 1
oh 1
let 1
her 1
stay 1
up 1
there 1
its 1
not 1
like 1
shes 1
going 1
anywhere 1
well 1
deal 1
with 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
well 1
hes 1
right 1
about 1
one 1
thing 1
im 1
going 1
nowhere 1
all 1
the 1
relief 1
from 1
the 1
pool 1
water 1
has 1
gone 1
leaving 1
me 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
full 1
potency 1
of 1
my 1
burns 1
i 1
scoot 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
fork 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
clumsily 1
prepare 1
for 1
bed 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
jacket 1
lay 1
out 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bed 1
belt 1
myself 1
in 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
moaning 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
bags 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
my 1
leg 1
i 1
cut 1
a 1
slash 1
in 1
the 1
fabric 1
and 1
hang 1
my 1
calf 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
i 1
drizzle 1
water 1
on 1
the 1
wound 1
my 1
hands 1
all 1
my 1
bravado 1
is 1
gone 1
im 1
weak 1
from 1
pain 1
and 1
hunger 1
but 1
cant 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
eat 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
last 1
the 1
night 1
what 1
will 1
the 1
morning 1
bring 1
i 1
stare 1
into 1
the 1
foliage 1
trying 1
to 1
will 1
myself 1
to 1
rest 1
but 1
the 1
burns 1
forbid 1
it 1
birds 1
are 1
settling 1
down 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
singing 1
lullabies 1
to 1
their 1
young 1
night 1
creatures 1
emerge 1
an 1
owl 1
hoots 1
the 1
faint 1
scent 1
of 1
a 1
skunk 1
cuts 1
through 1
the 1
smoke 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
some 1
animal 1
peer 1
at 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
neighboring 1
tree 1
a 1
possum 1
maybe 1
catching 1
the 1
firelight 1
from 1
the 1
careers 1
torches 1
suddenly 1
im 1
up 1
on 1
one 1
elbow 1
those 1
are 1
no 1
possums 1
eyes 1
i 1
know 1
their 1
glassy 1
reflection 1
too 1
well 1
in 1
fact 1
those 1
are 1
not 1
animal 1
eyes 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
dim 1
rays 1
of 1
light 1
i 1
make 1
her 1
out 1
watching 1
me 1
silently 1
from 1
between 1
the 1
branches 1
rue 1
how 1
long 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
here 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
probably 1
still 1
and 1
unobserved 1
as 1
the 1
action 1
unfolded 1
beneath 1
her 1
perhaps 1
she 1
headed 1
up 1
her 1
tree 1
shortly 1
before 1
i 1
did 1
hearing 1
the 1
pack 1
was 1
so 1
close 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
we 1
hold 1
each 1
others 1
gaze 1
then 1
without 1
even 1
rustling 1
a 1
leaf 1
her 1
little 1
hand 1
slides 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
and 1
points 1
to 1
something 1
above 1
my 1
head 1
my 1
eyes 1
follow 1
the 1
line 1
of 1
her 1
finger 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
foliage 1
above 1
me 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
shes 1
pointing 1
to 1
but 1
then 1
about 1
fifteen 1
feet 1
up 1
i 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
vague 1
shape 1
in 1
the 1
dimming 1
light 1
but 1
of 1
of 1
what 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
animal 1
it 1
looks 1
about 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
raccoon 1
but 1
it 1
hangs 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
a 1
branch 1
swaying 1
ever 1
so 1
slightly 1
theres 1
something 1
else 1
among 1
the 1
familiar 1
evening 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
my 1
ears 1
register 1
a 1
low 1
hum 1
then 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
a 1
wasp 1
nest 1
fear 1
shoots 1
through 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
enough 1
sense 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
wasp 1
lives 1
there 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
ordinary 1
leaveusaloneandwellleaveyoualone 1
type 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
and 1
ordinary 1
isnt 1
the 1
norm 1
more 1
likely 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
capitols 1
muttations 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
like 1
the 1
jabberjays 1
these 1
killer 1
wasps 1
were 1
spawned 1
in 1
a 1
lab 1
and 1
strategically 1
placed 1
like 1
land 1
mines 1
around 1
the 1
districts 1
during 1
the 1
war 1
larger 1
than 1
regular 1
wasps 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
distinctive 1
solid 1
gold 1
body 1
and 1
a 1
sting 1
that 1
raises 1
a 1
lump 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
plum 1
on 1
contact 1
most 1
people 1
cant 1
tolerate 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few 1
stings 1
some 1
die 1
at 1
once 1
if 1
you 1
live 1
the 1
hallucinations 1
brought 1
on 1
by 1
the 1
venom 1
have 1
actually 1
driven 1
people 1
to 1
madness 1
and 1
theres 1
another 1
thing 1
these 1
wasps 1
will 1
hunt 1
down 1
anyone 1
who 1
disturbs 1
their 1
nest 1
and 1
attempt 1
to 1
kill 1
them 1
thats 1
where 1
the 1
tracker 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
comes 1
from 1
after 1
the 1
war 1
the 1
capitol 1
destroyed 1
all 1
the 1
nests 1
surrounding 1
their 1
city 1
but 1
the 1
ones 1
near 1
the 1
districts 1
were 1
left 1
untouched 1
another 1
reminder 1
of 1
our 1
weakness 1
i 1
suppose 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
another 1
reason 1
to 1
keep 1
inside 1
the 1
fence 1
of 1
district 1
when 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
come 1
across 1
a 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
nest 1
we 1
immediately 1
head 1
in 1
the 1
opposite 1
direction 1
so 1
is 1
that 1
what 1
hangs 1
above 1
me 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
to 1
rue 1
for 1
help 1
but 1
shes 1
melted 1
into 1
her 1
tree 1
given 1
my 1
circumstances 1
i 1
guess 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
what 1
type 1
of 1
wasp 1
nest 1
it 1
is 1
im 1
wounded 1
and 1
trapped 1
darkness 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
brief 1
reprieve 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
sun 1
rises 1
the 1
careers 1
will 1
have 1
formulated 1
a 1
plan 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
theres 1
no 1
way 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
otherwise 1
after 1
ive 1
made 1
them 1
look 1
so 1
stupid 1
that 1
nest 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
sole 1
option 1
i 1
have 1
left 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
drop 1
it 1
down 1
on 1
them 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
escape 1
but 1
ill 1
risk 1
my 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
process 1
of 1
course 1
ill 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
close 1
enough 1
to 1
the 1
actual 1
nest 1
to 1
cut 1
it 1
free 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
saw 1
off 1
the 1
branch 1
at 1
the 1
trunk 1
and 1
send 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
down 1
the 1
serrated 1
portion 1
of 1
my 1
knife 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
manage 1
that 1
but 1
can 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
will 1
the 1
vibration 1
from 1
the 1
sawing 1
raise 1
the 1
swarm 1
and 1
what 1
if 1
the 1
careers 1
figure 1
out 1
what 1
im 1
doing 1
and 1
move 1
their 1
camp 1
that 1
would 1
defeat 1
the 1
whole 1
purpose 1
i 1
realize 1
that 1
the 1
best 1
chance 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
sawing 1
without 1
drawing 1
notice 1
will 1
be 1
during 1
the 1
anthem 1
that 1
could 1
begin 1
any 1
time 1
i 1
drag 1
myself 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
bag 1
make 1
sure 1
my 1
knife 1
is 1
secured 1
in 1
my 1
belt 1
and 1
begin 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
way 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
is 1
dangerous 1
since 1
the 1
branches 1
are 1
becoming 1
precariously 1
thin 1
even 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
persevere 1
when 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
limb 1
that 1
supports 1
the 1
nest 1
the 1
humming 1
becomes 1
more 1
distinctive 1
but 1
its 1
still 1
oddly 1
subdued 1
if 1
these 1
are 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
its 1
the 1
smoke 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
sedated 1
them 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
defense 1
the 1
rebels 1
found 1
to 1
battle 1
the 1
wasps 1
the 1
seal 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
shines 1
above 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
anthem 1
blares 1
out 1
its 1
now 1
or 1
never 1
i 1
think 1
and 1
begin 1
to 1
saw 1
blisters 1
burst 1
on 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
as 1
i 1
awkwardly 1
drag 1
the 1
knife 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
once 1
ive 1
got 1
a 1
groove 1
the 1
work 1
requires 1
less 1
effort 1
but 1
is 1
almost 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
handle 1
i 1
grit 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
saw 1
away 1
occasionally 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
sky 1
to 1
register 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
deaths 1
today 1
thats 1
all 1
right 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
be 1
sated 1
seeing 1
me 1
injured 1
and 1
treed 1
and 1
the 1
pack 1
below 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
anthems 1
running 1
out 1
and 1
im 1
only 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
the 1
music 1
ends 1
the 1
sky 1
goes 1
dark 1
and 1
im 1
forced 1
to 1
stop 1
now 1
what 1
i 1
could 1
probably 1
finish 1
off 1
the 1
job 1
by 1
sense 1
of 1
feel 1
but 1
that 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
smartest 1
plan 1
if 1
the 1
wasps 1
are 1
too 1
groggy 1
if 1
the 1
nest 1
catches 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
down 1
if 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
escape 1
this 1
could 1
all 1
be 1
a 1
deadly 1
waste 1
of 1
time 1
better 1
i 1
think 1
to 1
sneak 1
up 1
here 1
at 1
dawn 1
and 1
send 1
the 1
nest 1
into 1
my 1
enemies 1
in 1
the 1
faint 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
careers 1
torches 1
i 1
inch 1
back 1
down 1
to 1
my 1
fork 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
best 1
surprise 1
ive 1
ever 1
had 1
sitting 1
on 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
plastic 1
pot 1
attached 1
to 1
a 1
silver 1
parachute 1
my 1
first 1
gift 1
from 1
a 1
sponsor 1
haymitch 1
must 1
have 1
had 1
it 1
sent 1
in 1
during 1
the 1
anthem 1
the 1
pot 1
easily 1
fits 1
in 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
not 1
food 1
surely 1
i 1
unscrew 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
by 1
the 1
scent 1
that 1
its 1
medicine 1
cautiously 1
i 1
probe 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
ointment 1
the 1
throbbing 1
in 1
my 1
fingertip 1
vanishes 1
oh 1
haymitch 1
i 1
whisper 1
thank 1
you 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
abandoned 1
me 1
not 1
left 1
me 1
to 1
fend 1
entirely 1
for 1
myself 1
the 1
cost 1
of 1
this 1
medicine 1
must 1
be 1
astronomical 1
probably 1
not 1
one 1
but 1
many 1
sponsors 1
have 1
contributed 1
to 1
buy 1
this 1
one 1
tiny 1
pot 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
priceless 1
i 1
dip 1
two 1
fingers 1
in 1
the 1
jar 1
and 1
gently 1
spread 1
the 1
balm 1
over 1
my 1
calf 1
the 1
effect 1
is 1
almost 1
magical 1
erasing 1
the 1
pain 1
on 1
contact 1
leaving 1
a 1
pleasant 1
cooling 1
sensation 1
behind 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
herbal 1
concoction 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
grinds 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
woodland 1
plants 1
its 1
hightech 1
medicine 1
brewed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
capitols 1
labs 1
when 1
my 1
calf 1
is 1
treated 1
i 1
rub 1
a 1
thin 1
layer 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
after 1
wrapping 1
the 1
pot 1
in 1
the 1
parachute 1
i 1
nestle 1
it 1
safely 1
away 1
in 1
my 1
pack 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
pain 1
has 1
eased 1
its 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
to 1
reposition 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
bag 1
before 1
i 1
plunge 1
into 1
sleep 1
a 1
bird 1
perched 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
from 1
me 1
alerts 1
me 1
that 1
a 1
new 1
day 1
is 1
dawning 1
in 1
the 1
gray 1
morning 1
light 1
i 1
examine 1
my 1
hands 1
the 1
medicine 1
has 1
transformed 1
all 1
the 1
angry 1
red 1
patches 1
to 1
a 1
soft 1
babyskin 1
pink 1
my 1
leg 1
still 1
feels 1
inflamed 1
but 1
that 1
burn 1
was 1
far 1
deeper 1
i 1
apply 1
another 1
coat 1
of 1
medicine 1
and 1
quietly 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
gear 1
whatever 1
happens 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
move 1
fast 1
i 1
also 1
make 1
myself 1
eat 1
a 1
cracker 1
and 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
beef 1
and 1
drink 1
a 1
few 1
cups 1
of 1
water 1
almost 1
nothing 1
stayed 1
in 1
my 1
stomach 1
yesterday 1
and 1
im 1
already 1
starting 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
hunger 1
below 1
me 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
career 1
pack 1
and 1
peeta 1
asleep 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
by 1
her 1
position 1
leaning 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
trunk 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
id 1
guess 1
glimmer 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
guard 1
but 1
fatigue 1
overcame 1
her 1
my 1
eyes 1
squint 1
as 1
they 1
try 1
to 1
penetrate 1
the 1
tree 1
next 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
out 1
rue 1
since 1
she 1
tipped 1
me 1
off 1
it 1
only 1
seems 1
fair 1
to 1
warn 1
her 1
besides 1
if 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
today 1
its 1
rue 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
win 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
means 1
a 1
little 1
extra 1
food 1
for 1
my 1
family 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
peeta 1
being 1
crowned 1
victor 1
is 1
unbearable 1
i 1
call 1
rues 1
name 1
in 1
a 1
hushed 1
whisper 1
and 1
the 1
eyes 1
appear 1
wide 1
and 1
alert 1
at 1
once 1
she 1
points 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
again 1
i 1
hold 1
up 1
my 1
knife 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
sawing 1
motion 1
she 1
nods 1
and 1
disappears 1
theres 1
a 1
rustling 1
in 1
a 1
nearby 1
tree 1
then 1
the 1
same 1
noise 1
again 1
a 1
bit 1
farther 1
off 1
i 1
realize 1
shes 1
leaping 1
from 1
tree 1
to 1
tree 1
its 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
not 1
to 1
laugh 1
out 1
loud 1
is 1
this 1
what 1
she 1
showed 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
i 1
imagine 1
her 1
flying 1
around 1
the 1
training 1
equipment 1
never 1
touching 1
the 1
floor 1
she 1
should 1
have 1
gotten 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
ten 1
rosy 1
streaks 1
are 1
breaking 1
through 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
i 1
cant 1
afford 1
to 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
last 1
nights 1
climb 1
this 1
one 1
is 1
a 1
cinch 1
at 1
the 1
tree 1
limb 1
that 1
holds 1
the 1
nest 1
i 1
position 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
the 1
groove 1
and 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
teeth 1
across 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
something 1
moving 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
nest 1
the 1
bright 1
gold 1
gleam 1
of 1
a 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
lazily 1
making 1
its 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
papery 1
gray 1
surface 1
no 1
question 1
its 1
acting 1
a 1
little 1
subdued 1
but 1
the 1
wasp 1
is 1
up 1
and 1
moving 1
and 1
that 1
means 1
the 1
others 1
will 1
be 1
out 1
soon 1
as 1
well 1
sweat 1
breaks 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
palms 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
beading 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
ointment 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
my 1
best 1
to 1
pat 1
them 1
dry 1
on 1
my 1
shirt 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
through 1
this 1
branch 1
in 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
seconds 1
the 1
entire 1
swarm 1
could 1
emerge 1
and 1
attack 1
me 1
theres 1
no 1
sense 1
in 1
putting 1
it 1
off 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
grip 1
the 1
knife 1
handle 1
and 1
bear 1
down 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
back 1
forth 1
back 1
forth 1
the 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
begin 1
to 1
buzz 1
and 1
i 1
hear 1
them 1
coming 1
out 1
back 1
forth 1
back 1
forth 1
a 1
stabbing 1
pain 1
shoots 1
through 1
my 1
knee 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
one 1
has 1
found 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
will 1
be 1
honing 1
in 1
back 1
forth 1
back 1
forth 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
knife 1
cuts 1
through 1
i 1
shove 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
branch 1
as 1
far 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
it 1
crashes 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
lower 1
branches 1
snagging 1
temporarily 1
on 1
a 1
few 1
but 1
then 1
twisting 1
free 1
until 1
it 1
smashes 1
with 1
a 1
thud 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
nest 1
bursts 1
open 1
like 1
an 1
egg 1
and 1
a 1
furious 1
swarm 1
of 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
takes 1
to 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
second 1
sting 1
on 1
the 1
cheek 1
a 1
third 1
on 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
their 1
venom 1
almost 1
immediately 1
makes 1
me 1
woozy 1
i 1
cling 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
one 1
arm 1
while 1
i 1
rip 1
the 1
barbed 1
stingers 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
flesh 1
fortunately 1
only 1
these 1
three 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
had 1
identified 1
me 1
before 1
the 1
nest 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
insects 1
have 1
targeted 1
their 1
enemies 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
its 1
mayhem 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
woken 1
to 1
a 1
fullscale 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
attack 1
peeta 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
others 1
have 1
the 1
sense 1
to 1
drop 1
everything 1
and 1
bolt 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
cries 1
of 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
know 1
they 1
hope 1
to 1
evade 1
the 1
wasps 1
by 1
taking 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
close 1
if 1
they 1
think 1
they 1
can 1
outdistance 1
the 1
furious 1
insects 1
glimmer 1
and 1
another 1
girl 1
the 1
one 1
from 1
district 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
lucky 1
they 1
receive 1
multiple 1
stings 1
before 1
theyre 1
even 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
view 1
glimmer 1
appears 1
to 1
go 1
completely 1
mad 1
shrieking 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
bat 1
the 1
wasps 1
off 1
with 1
her 1
bow 1
which 1
is 1
pointless 1
she 1
calls 1
to 1
the 1
others 1
for 1
help 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
no 1
one 1
returns 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
staggers 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
although 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
bet 1
on 1
her 1
making 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
watch 1
glimmer 1
fall 1
twitch 1
hysterically 1
around 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
still 1
the 1
nest 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
an 1
empty 1
shell 1
the 1
wasps 1
have 1
vanished 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
theyll 1
return 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
risk 1
it 1
i 1
scamper 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
hit 1
the 1
ground 1
running 1
in 1
the 1
opposite 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
poison 1
from 1
the 1
stingers 1
makes 1
me 1
wobbly 1
but 1
i 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
pool 1
and 1
submerge 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
just 1
in 1
case 1
any 1
wasps 1
are 1
still 1
on 1
my 1
trail 1
after 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
i 1
drag 1
myself 1
onto 1
the 1
rocks 1
people 1
have 1
not 1
exaggerated 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
stings 1
actually 1
the 1
one 1
on 1
my 1
knee 1
is 1
closer 1
to 1
an 1
orange 1
than 1
a 1
plum 1
in 1
size 1
a 1
foulsmelling 1
green 1
liquid 1
oozes 1
from 1
the 1
places 1
where 1
i 1
pulled 1
out 1
the 1
stingers 1
the 1
swelling 1
the 1
pain 1
the 1
ooze 1
watching 1
glimmer 1
twitching 1
to 1
death 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
its 1
a 1
lot 1
to 1
handle 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
has 1
even 1
cleared 1
the 1
horizon 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
what 1
glimmer 1
must 1
look 1
like 1
now 1
her 1
body 1
disfigured 1
her 1
swollen 1
fingers 1
stiffening 1
around 1
the 1
bow 1
the 1
bow 1
somewhere 1
in 1
my 1
befuddled 1
mind 1
one 1
thought 1
connects 1
to 1
another 1
and 1
im 1
on 1
my 1
feet 1
teetering 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
back 1
to 1
glimmer 1
the 1
bow 1
the 1
arrows 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
them 1
i 1
havent 1
heard 1
the 1
cannons 1
fire 1
yet 1
so 1
perhaps 1
glimmer 1
is 1
in 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
coma 1
her 1
heart 1
still 1
struggling 1
against 1
the 1
wasp 1
venom 1
but 1
once 1
it 1
stops 1
and 1
the 1
cannon 1
signals 1
her 1
death 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
will 1
move 1
in 1
and 1
retrieve 1
her 1
body 1
taking 1
the 1
only 1
bow 1
and 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
ive 1
seen 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
for 1
good 1
and 1
i 1
refuse 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
slip 1
through 1
my 1
fingers 1
again 1
i 1
reach 1
glimmer 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
cannon 1
fires 1
the 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
have 1
vanished 1
this 1
girl 1
so 1
breathtakingly 1
beautiful 1
in 1
her 1
golden 1
dress 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
interviews 1
is 1
unrecognizable 1
her 1
features 1
eradicated 1
her 1
limbs 1
three 1
times 1
their 1
normal 1
size 1
the 1
stinger 1
lumps 1
have 1
begun 1
to 1
explode 1
spewing 1
putrid 1
green 1
liquid 1
around 1
her 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
break 1
several 1
of 1
what 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
her 1
fingers 1
with 1
a 1
stone 1
to 1
free 1
the 1
bow 1
the 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
is 1
pinned 1
under 1
her 1
back 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
roll 1
over 1
her 1
body 1
by 1
pulling 1
on 1
one 1
arm 1
but 1
the 1
flesh 1
disintegrates 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
i 1
fall 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
is 1
this 1
real 1
or 1
have 1
the 1
hallucinations 1
begun 1
i 1
squeeze 1
my 1
eyes 1
tight 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
breathe 1
through 1
my 1
mouth 1
ordering 1
myself 1
not 1
to 1
become 1
sick 1
breakfast 1
must 1
stay 1
down 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
days 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
hunt 1
again 1
a 1
second 1
cannon 1
fires 1
and 1
im 1
guessing 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
has 1
just 1
died 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
birds 1
fall 1
silent 1
and 1
then 1
one 1
give 1
the 1
warning 1
call 1
which 1
means 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
appear 1
confused 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
for 1
glimmer 1
although 1
this 1
doesnt 1
quite 1
make 1
sense 1
because 1
im 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
still 1
fighting 1
for 1
the 1
arrows 1
i 1
lurch 1
back 1
onto 1
my 1
knees 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
around 1
me 1
begin 1
to 1
spin 1
in 1
circles 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
sky 1
i 1
spot 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
i 1
throw 1
myself 1
over 1
glimmers 1
body 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
protect 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
being 1
lifted 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
vanishing 1
do 1
this 1
i 1
command 1
myself 1
clenching 1
my 1
jaw 1
i 1
dig 1
my 1
hands 1
under 1
glimmers 1
body 1
get 1
a 1
hold 1
on 1
what 1
must 1
be 1
her 1
rib 1
cage 1
and 1
force 1
her 1
onto 1
her 1
stomach 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
it 1
im 1
hyperventilating 1
now 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
so 1
nightmarish 1
and 1
im 1
losing 1
my 1
grasp 1
on 1
whats 1
real 1
i 1
tug 1
on 1
the 1
silver 1
sheath 1
of 1
arrows 1
but 1
its 1
caught 1
on 1
something 1
her 1
shoulder 1
blade 1
something 1
and 1
finally 1
yank 1
it 1
free 1
ive 1
just 1
encircled 1
the 1
sheath 1
with 1
my 1
arms 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
footsteps 1
several 1
pairs 1
coming 1
through 1
the 1
underbrush 1
and 1
i 1
realize 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
come 1
back 1
theyve 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
or 1
get 1
their 1
weapons 1
or 1
both 1
but 1
its 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
run 1
i 1
pull 1
a 1
slimy 1
arrow 1
from 1
the 1
sheath 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
position 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
bowstring 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
one 1
string 1
i 1
see 1
three 1
and 1
the 1
stench 1
from 1
the 1
stings 1
is 1
so 1
repulsive 1
i 1
cant 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
cant 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
cant 1
do 1
it 1
im 1
helpless 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
hunter 1
crashes 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
spear 1
lifted 1
poised 1
to 1
throw 1
the 1
shock 1
on 1
peetas 1
face 1
makes 1
no 1
sense 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
blow 1
instead 1
his 1
arm 1
drops 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
still 1
doing 1
here 1
he 1
hisses 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
stare 1
uncomprehendingly 1
as 1
a 1
trickle 1
of 1
water 1
drips 1
off 1
a 1
sting 1
under 1
his 1
ear 1
his 1
whole 1
body 1
starts 1
sparkling 1
as 1
if 1
hes 1
been 1
dipped 1
in 1
dew 1
are 1
you 1
mad 1
hes 1
prodding 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
shaft 1
of 1
the 1
spear 1
now 1
get 1
up 1
get 1
up 1
i 1
rise 1
but 1
hes 1
still 1
pushing 1
at 1
me 1
what 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
he 1
shoves 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
hard 1
run 1
he 1
screams 1
run 1
behind 1
him 1
cato 1
slashes 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
brush 1
hes 1
sparkling 1
wet 1
too 1
and 1
badly 1
stung 1
under 1
one 1
eye 1
i 1
catch 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
sunlight 1
on 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
do 1
as 1
peeta 1
says 1
holding 1
tightly 1
to 1
my 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
banging 1
into 1
trees 1
that 1
appear 1
out 1
of 1
nowhere 1
tripping 1
and 1
falling 1
as 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
keep 1
my 1
balance 1
back 1
past 1
my 1
pool 1
and 1
into 1
unfamiliar 1
woods 1
the 1
world 1
begins 1
to 1
bend 1
in 1
alarming 1
ways 1
a 1
butterfly 1
balloons 1
to 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
then 1
shatters 1
into 1
a 1
million 1
stars 1
trees 1
transform 1
to 1
blood 1
and 1
splash 1
down 1
over 1
my 1
boots 1
ants 1
begin 1
to 1
crawl 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
blisters 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
shake 1
them 1
free 1
theyre 1
climbing 1
up 1
my 1
arms 1
my 1
neck 1
someones 1
screaming 1
a 1
long 1
high 1
pitched 1
scream 1
that 1
never 1
breaks 1
for 1
breath 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
vague 1
idea 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
me 1
i 1
trip 1
and 1
fall 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
pit 1
lined 1
with 1
tiny 1
orange 1
bubbles 1
that 1
hum 1
like 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
nest 1
tucking 1
my 1
knees 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
chin 1
i 1
wait 1
for 1
death 1
sick 1
and 1
disoriented 1
im 1
able 1
to 1
form 1
only 1
one 1
thought 1
peeta 1
mellark 1
just 1
saved 1
my 1
life 1
then 1
the 1
ants 1
bore 1
into 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
black 1
out 1
i 1
enter 1
a 1
nightmare 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
wake 1
repeatedly 1
only 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
greater 1
terror 1
awaiting 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
i 1
dread 1
most 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
i 1
dread 1
for 1
others 1
manifest 1
in 1
such 1
vivid 1
detail 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
but 1
believe 1
theyre 1
real 1
each 1
time 1
i 1
wake 1
i 1
think 1
at 1
last 1
this 1
is 1
over 1
but 1
it 1
isnt 1
its 1
only 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
chapter 1
of 1
torture 1
how 1
many 1
ways 1
do 1
i 1
watch 1
prim 1
die 1
relive 1
my 1
fathers 1
last 1
moments 1
feel 1
my 1
own 1
body 1
ripped 1
apart 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
venom 1
so 1
carefully 1
created 1
to 1
target 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
fear 1
lives 1
in 1
your 1
brain 1
when 1
i 1
finally 1
do 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
senses 1
i 1
lie 1
still 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
onslaught 1
of 1
imagery 1
but 1
eventually 1
i 1
accept 1
that 1
the 1
poison 1
must 1
have 1
finally 1
worked 1
its 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
system 1
leaving 1
my 1
body 1
wracked 1
and 1
feeble 1
im 1
still 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
locked 1
in 1
the 1
fetal 1
position 1
i 1
lift 1
a 1
hand 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
find 1
them 1
sound 1
untouched 1
by 1
ants 1
that 1
never 1
existed 1
simply 1
stretching 1
out 1
my 1
limbs 1
requires 1
an 1
enormous 1
effort 1
so 1
many 1
parts 1
of 1
me 1
hurt 1
it 1
doesnt 1
seem 1
worthwhile 1
taking 1
inventory 1
of 1
them 1
very 1
very 1
slowly 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
im 1
in 1
a 1
shallow 1
hole 1
not 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
humming 1
orange 1
bubbles 1
of 1
my 1
hallucination 1
but 1
with 1
old 1
dead 1
leaves 1
my 1
clothings 1
damp 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
whether 1
pond 1
water 1
dew 1
rain 1
or 1
sweat 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
is 1
take 1
tiny 1
sips 1
from 1
my 1
bottle 1
and 1
watch 1
a 1
beetle 1
crawl 1
up 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
honeysuckle 1
bush 1
how 1
long 1
have 1
i 1
been 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
when 1
i 1
lost 1
reason 1
now 1
its 1
afternoon 1
but 1
the 1
stiffness 1
in 1
my 1
joints 1
suggests 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
day 1
has 1
passed 1
even 1
two 1
possibly 1
if 1
so 1
ill 1
have 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
knowing 1
which 1
tributes 1
survived 1
that 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
attack 1
not 1
glimmer 1
or 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
both 1
tributes 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
peeta 1
did 1
they 1
die 1
from 1
the 1
stings 1
certainly 1
if 1
they 1
lived 1
their 1
last 1
days 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
horrid 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
and 1
what 1
about 1
rue 1
shes 1
so 1
small 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
take 1
much 1
venom 1
to 1
do 1
her 1
in 1
but 1
then 1
again 1
the 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
wouldve 1
had 1
to 1
catch 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
head 1
start 1
a 1
foul 1
rotten 1
taste 1
pervades 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
has 1
little 1
effect 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
drag 1
myself 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
honeysuckle 1
bush 1
and 1
pluck 1
a 1
flower 1
i 1
gently 1
pull 1
the 1
stamen 1
through 1
the 1
blossom 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
drop 1
of 1
nectar 1
on 1
my 1
tongue 1
the 1
sweetness 1
spreads 1
through 1
my 1
mouth 1
down 1
my 1
throat 1
warming 1
my 1
veins 1
with 1
memories 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
my 1
home 1
woods 1
and 1
gales 1
presence 1
beside 1
me 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
our 1
discussion 1
from 1
that 1
last 1
morning 1
comes 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
leave 1
the 1
district 1
run 1
off 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
we 1
could 1
make 1
it 1
and 1
suddenly 1
im 1
not 1
thinking 1
of 1
gale 1
but 1
of 1
peeta 1
and 1
peeta 1
he 1
saved 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
think 1
because 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
met 1
up 1
i 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
what 1
was 1
real 1
and 1
what 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
venom 1
had 1
caused 1
me 1
to 1
imagine 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
my 1
instincts 1
tell 1
me 1
he 1
did 1
what 1
for 1
is 1
he 1
simply 1
working 1
the 1
lover 1
boy 1
angle 1
he 1
initiated 1
at 1
the 1
interview 1
or 1
was 1
he 1
actually 1
trying 1
to 1
protect 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
what 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
with 1
those 1
careers 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
none 1
of 1
it 1
makes 1
sense 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
gale 1
made 1
of 1
the 1
incident 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
push 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mind 1
because 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
gale 1
and 1
peeta 1
do 1
not 1
coexist 1
well 1
together 1
in 1
my 1
thoughts 1
so 1
i 1
focus 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
really 1
good 1
thing 1
thats 1
happened 1
since 1
i 1
landed 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
a 1
full 1
dozen 1
arrows 1
if 1
you 1
count 1
the 1
one 1
i 1
retrieved 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
they 1
bear 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
the 1
noxious 1
green 1
slime 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
glimmers 1
body 1
which 1
leads 1
me 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
wholly 1
real 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
fair 1
amount 1
of 1
dried 1
blood 1
on 1
them 1
i 1
can 1
clean 1
them 1
later 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
take 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
shoot 1
a 1
few 1
into 1
a 1
nearby 1
tree 1
they 1
are 1
more 1
like 1
the 1
weapons 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
than 1
my 1
ones 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
who 1
cares 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
work 1
with 1
the 1
weapons 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
perspective 1
on 1
the 1
games 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
tough 1
opponents 1
left 1
to 1
face 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
longer 1
merely 1
prey 1
that 1
runs 1
and 1
hides 1
or 1
takes 1
desperate 1
measures 1
if 1
cato 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
right 1
now 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
flee 1
id 1
shoot 1
i 1
find 1
im 1
actually 1
anticipating 1
the 1
moment 1
with 1
pleasure 1
but 1
first 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
strength 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
body 1
im 1
very 1
dehydrated 1
again 1
and 1
my 1
water 1
supply 1
is 1
dangerously 1
low 1
the 1
little 1
padding 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
by 1
gorging 1
myself 1
during 1
prep 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
is 1
gone 1
plus 1
several 1
more 1
pounds 1
as 1
well 1
my 1
hip 1
bones 1
and 1
ribs 1
are 1
more 1
prominent 1
than 1
i 1
remember 1
them 1
being 1
since 1
those 1
awful 1
months 1
after 1
my 1
fathers 1
death 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
my 1
wounds 1
to 1
contend 1
with 1
burns 1
cuts 1
and 1
bruises 1
from 1
smashing 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
three 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
stings 1
which 1
are 1
as 1
sore 1
and 1
swollen 1
as 1
ever 1
i 1
treat 1
my 1
burns 1
with 1
the 1
ointment 1
and 1
try 1
dabbing 1
a 1
bit 1
on 1
my 1
stings 1
as 1
well 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
effect 1
on 1
them 1
my 1
mother 1
knew 1
a 1
treatment 1
for 1
them 1
some 1
type 1
of 1
leaf 1
that 1
could 1
draw 1
out 1
the 1
poison 1
but 1
she 1
seldom 1
had 1
cause 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
remember 1
its 1
name 1
let 1
alone 1
its 1
appearance 1
water 1
first 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
can 1
hunt 1
along 1
the 1
way 1
now 1
its 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
direction 1
i 1
came 1
from 1
by 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
destruction 1
my 1
crazed 1
body 1
made 1
through 1
the 1
foliage 1
so 1
i 1
walk 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
direction 1
hoping 1
my 1
enemies 1
still 1
lie 1
locked 1
in 1
the 1
surreal 1
world 1
of 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
venom 1
i 1
cant 1
move 1
too 1
quickly 1
my 1
joints 1
reject 1
any 1
abrupt 1
motions 1
but 1
i 1
establish 1
the 1
slow 1
hunters 1
tread 1
i 1
use 1
when 1
tracking 1
game 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
i 1
spot 1
a 1
rabbit 1
and 1
make 1
my 1
first 1
kill 1
with 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
its 1
not 1
my 1
usual 1
clean 1
shot 1
through 1
the 1
eye 1
but 1
ill 1
take 1
it 1
after 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
i 1
find 1
a 1
stream 1
shallow 1
but 1
wide 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
sufficient 1
for 1
my 1
needs 1
the 1
suns 1
hot 1
and 1
severe 1
so 1
while 1
i 1
wait 1
for 1
my 1
water 1
to 1
purify 1
i 1
strip 1
down 1
to 1
my 1
underclothes 1
and 1
wade 1
into 1
the 1
mild 1
current 1
im 1
filthy 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
toe 1
i 1
try 1
splashing 1
myself 1
but 1
eventually 1
just 1
lay 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
letting 1
it 1
wash 1
off 1
the 1
soot 1
and 1
blood 1
and 1
skin 1
that 1
has 1
started 1
to 1
peel 1
off 1
my 1
burns 1
after 1
rinsing 1
out 1
my 1
clothes 1
and 1
hanging 1
them 1
on 1
bushes 1
to 1
dry 1
i 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
a 1
bit 1
untangling 1
my 1
hair 1
with 1
my 1
fingers 1
my 1
appetite 1
returns 1
and 1
i 1
eat 1
a 1
cracker 1
and 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
beef 1
with 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
moss 1
i 1
polish 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
silver 1
weapons 1
refreshed 1
i 1
treat 1
my 1
burns 1
again 1
braid 1
back 1
my 1
hair 1
and 1
dress 1
in 1
the 1
damp 1
clothes 1
knowing 1
the 1
sun 1
will 1
dry 1
them 1
soon 1
enough 1
following 1
the 1
stream 1
against 1
its 1
current 1
seems 1
the 1
smartest 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
im 1
traveling 1
uphill 1
now 1
which 1
i 1
prefer 1
with 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
fresh 1
water 1
not 1
only 1
for 1
myself 1
but 1
possible 1
game 1
i 1
easily 1
take 1
out 1
a 1
strange 1
bird 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
form 1
of 1
wild 1
turkey 1
anyway 1
it 1
looks 1
plenty 1
edible 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
late 1
afternoon 1
i 1
decide 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
small 1
fire 1
to 1
cook 1
the 1
meat 1
betting 1
that 1
dusk 1
will 1
help 1
conceal 1
the 1
smoke 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
quench 1
the 1
fire 1
by 1
nightfall 1
i 1
clean 1
the 1
game 1
taking 1
extra 1
care 1
with 1
the 1
bird 1
but 1
theres 1
nothing 1
alarming 1
about 1
it 1
once 1
the 1
feathers 1
are 1
plucked 1
its 1
no 1
bigger 1
than 1
a 1
chicken 1
but 1
its 1
plump 1
and 1
firm 1
ive 1
just 1
placed 1
the 1
first 1
lot 1
over 1
the 1
coals 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
twig 1
snap 1
in 1
one 1
motion 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
sound 1
bringing 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
to 1
my 1
shoulder 1
theres 1
no 1
one 1
there 1
no 1
one 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
anyway 1
then 1
i 1
spot 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
a 1
childs 1
boot 1
just 1
peeking 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
trunk 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
my 1
shoulders 1
relax 1
and 1
i 1
grin 1
she 1
can 1
move 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
like 1
a 1
shadow 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
that 1
how 1
else 1
could 1
she 1
have 1
followed 1
me 1
the 1
words 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
stop 1
them 1
you 1
know 1
theyre 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1
who 1
can 1
form 1
alliances 1
i 1
say 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
no 1
response 1
then 1
one 1
of 1
rues 1
eyes 1
edges 1
around 1
the 1
trunk 1
you 1
want 1
me 1
for 1
an 1
ally 1
why 1
not 1
you 1
saved 1
me 1
with 1
those 1
tracker 1
jackers 1

smart 1
enough 1
to 1
still 1
be 1
alive 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
seem 1
to 1
shake 1
you 1
anyway 1
i 1
say 1
she 1
blinks 1
at 1
me 1
trying 1
to 1
decide 1
you 1
hungry 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
her 1
swallow 1
hard 1
her 1
eye 1
flickering 1
to 1
the 1
meat 1

carries 1
and 1
pulls 1
out 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
leaves 1

almost 1
certain 1

the 1
ones 1
my 1
mother 1

whered 1
you 1
find 1
those 1
just 1
around 1

them 1
when 1
we 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
orchards 1

a 1
lot 1
of 1

lot 1

district 1

agriculture 1
i 1
say 1
orchards 1

must 1
be 1
how 1
you 1
can 1
fly 1
around 1
the 1
trees 1
like 1
youve 1
got 1
wings 1
rue 1
smiles 1
ive 1
landed 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
few 1
things 1
shell 1
admit 1
pride 1
in 1
well 1

on 1
then 1
fix 1
me 1
up 1
i 1
plunk 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
roll 1
up 1
my 1
pant 1
leg 1
to 1
reveal 1
the 1
sting 1
on 1
my 1
knee 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
rue 1
places 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
leaves 1
into 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
begins 1
to 1
chew 1
them 1
my 1
mother 1
would 1
use 1
other 1
methods 1
but 1
its 1
not 1
like 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
options 1
after 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
so 1
rue 1
presses 1
a 1
gloppy 1
green 1
wad 1
of 1
chewed 1
leaves 1
and 1
spit 1
on 1
my 1
knee 1
ohhh 1
the 1
sound 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
stop 1
it 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
leaves 1
are 1
actually 1
leaching 1
the 1
pain 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
sting 1
rue 1
gives 1
a 1
giggle 1
lucky 1
you 1
had 1
the 1
sense 1
to 1
pull 1
the 1
stingers 1
out 1
or 1
youd 1
be 1
a 1
lot 1
worse 1
do 1
my 1
neck 1
do 1
my 1
cheek 1
i 1
almost 1
beg 1
rue 1
stuffs 1
another 1
handful 1
of 1
leaves 1
in 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
soon 1
im 1
laughing 1
because 1
the 1
relief 1
is 1
so 1
sweet 1
i 1
notice 1
a 1
long 1
burn 1
on 1
rues 1
forearm 1
ive 1
got 1
something 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
set 1
aside 1
my 1
weapons 1
and 1
anoint 1
her 1
arm 1
with 1
the 1
burn 1
medicine 1

good 1
sponsors 1
she 1
says 1
longingly 1

you 1
gotten 1
anything 1
yet 1
i 1
ask 1
she 1
shakes 1
her 1
head 1

will 1
though 1
watch 1
the 1
closer 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
the 1
more 1
people 1
will 1
realize 1
how 1
clever 1
you 1
are 1
i 1
turn 1
the 1
meat 1
over 1
you 1
werent 1
joking 1
about 1
wanting 1
me 1
for 1
an 1
ally 1
she 1
asks 1
no 1
i 1
meant 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
can 1
almost 1
hear 1
haymitch 1
groaning 1
as 1
i 1
team 1
up 1
with 1
this 1
wispy 1
child 1
but 1
i 1
want 1
her 1
because 1
shes 1
a 1
survivor 1
and 1
i 1
trust 1
her 1
and 1
why 1
not 1
admit 1
it 1
she 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
prim 1
okay 1
she 1
says 1
and 1
holds 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
we 1
shake 1
its 1
a 1
deal 1
of 1
course 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
deal 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
temporary 1
but 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
mentions 1
that 1
rue 1
contributes 1
a 1
big 1
handful 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
starchy 1
root 1
to 1
the 1
meal 1
roasted 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
they 1
have 1
the 1
sharp 1
sweet 1
taste 1
of 1
a 1
parsnip 1
she 1
recognizes 1
the 1
bird 1
too 1
some 1
wild 1
thing 1
they 1
call 1
a 1
groosling 1
in 1
her 1
district 1
she 1
says 1
sometimes 1
a 1
flock 1
will 1
wander 1
into 1
the 1
orchard 1
and 1
they 1
get 1
a 1
decent 1
lunch 1
that 1
day 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
all 1
conversation 1
stops 1
as 1
we 1
fill 1
our 1
stomachs 1
the 1
groosling 1
has 1
delicious 1
meal 1
thats 1
so 1
fatty 1
the 1
grease 1
drips 1
down 1
your 1
face 1
when 1
you 1
bite 1
into 1
it 1
oh 1
says 1
rue 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
ive 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
leg 1
to 1
myself 1
before 1
ill 1
bet 1
she 1
hasnt 1
ill 1
bet 1
meat 1
hardly 1
ever 1
comes 1
her 1
way 1
take 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
say 1
really 1
she 1
asks 1
take 1
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
now 1
that 1
ive 1
got 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
more 1
plus 1
ive 1
got 1
snares 1
i 1
can 1
show 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
set 1

i 1
say 1
rue 1
still 1
looks 1
uncertainly 1
at 1
the 1
leg 1
oh 1
take 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
putting 1
the 1
drumstick 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
it 1
will 1
only 1
keep 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
anyway 1
and 1
weve 1
got 1
the 1
whole 1
bird 1
plus 1
the 1
rabbit 1
once 1
shes 1
got 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
her 1
appetite 1
wins 1
out 1
and 1
she 1
takes 1
a 1
huge 1
mouthful 1
id 1
have 1
thought 1
in 1
district 1
eleven 1
youd 1
have 1
a 1
bit 1
more 1
to 1
eat 1
than 1
us 1
you 1
know 1
since 1
you 1
grow 1
the 1
food 1
i 1
say 1
rues 1
eyes 1
widen 1
oh 1
no 1
were 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
crops 1
they 1
arrest 1
you 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
ask 1
they 1
whip 1
you 1
and 1
make 1
everyone 1
else 1
watch 1
says 1
rue 1
the 1
mayors 1
very 1
strict 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
her 1
expression 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
that 1
uncommon 1
an 1
occurrence 1
a 1
public 1
whippings 1
a 1
rare 1
thing 1
in 1
district 1
although 1
occasionally 1
one 1
occurs 1
technically 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
whipped 1
on 1
a 1
daily 1
basis 1
for 1
poaching 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
well 1
technically 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
whole 1
lot 1
worse 1
except 1
all 1
the 1
officials 1
buy 1
our 1
meat 1
besides 1
our 1
mayor 1
madges 1
father 1
doesnt 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
much 1
taste 1
for 1
such 1
events 1
maybe 1
being 1
the 1
least 1
prestigious 1
poorest 1
most 1
ridiculed 1
district 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
has 1
its 1
advantages 1
such 1
as 1
being 1
largely 1
ignored 1
by 1
the 1
capitol 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
produce 1
our 1
coal 1
quotas 1
do 1
you 1
get 1
all 1
the 1
coal 1
you 1
want 1
rue 1
asks 1
no 1
i 1
answer 1
just 1
what 1
we 1
buy 1
and 1
whatever 1
we 1
track 1
in 1
on 1
our 1
boots 1
they 1
feed 1
us 1
a 1
bit 1
extra 1
during 1
harvest 1
so 1
that 1
people 1
can 1
keep 1
going 1
longer 1
says 1
rue 1
dont 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
school 1
i 1
ask 1
not 1
during 1
harvest 1
everyone 1
works 1
then 1
says 1
rue 1
its 1
interesting 1
hearing 1
about 1
her 1
life 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
little 1
communication 1
with 1
anyone 1
outside 1
our 1
district 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
are 1
blocking 1
out 1
our 1
conversation 1
because 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
information 1
seems 1
harmless 1
they 1
dont 1
want 1
people 1
in 1
different 1
districts 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
one 1
another 1
at 1
rues 1
suggestion 1
we 1
lay 1
out 1
all 1
our 1
food 1
to 1
plan 1
ahead 1
shes 1
seen 1
most 1
of 1
mine 1
but 1
i 1
add 1
the 1
last 1
couple 1
of 1
crackers 1
and 1
beef 1
strips 1
to 1
the 1
pile 1
shes 1
gathered 1
quite 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
roots 1
nuts 1
greens 1
and 1
even 1
some 1
berries 1
i 1
roll 1
an 1
unfamiliar 1
berry 1
in 1
my 1
fingers 1
you 1
sure 1
this 1
is 1
safe 1
oh 1
yes 1
we 1
have 1
them 1
back 1
home 1
ive 1
been 1
eating 1
them 1
for 1
days 1
she 1
says 1
popping 1
a 1
handful 1
in 1
her 1
mouth 1
i 1
tentatively 1
bite 1
into 1
one 1
and 1
its 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
blackberries 1
taking 1
rue 1
on 1
as 1
an 1
ally 1
seems 1
a 1
better 1
choice 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
divide 1
up 1
our 1
food 1
supplies 1
so 1
in 1
case 1
were 1
separated 1
well 1
both 1
be 1
set 1
for 1
a 1
few 1

useless 1
so 1
far 1
they 1

sun 1
and 1
they 1

it 1
harder 1
to 1

a 1
shrug 1

theyre 1
for 1
darkness 1

pass 1
out 1
a 1
few 1
pairs 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
us 1
highest 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
where 1
the 1
torchlight 1

time 1

boy 1
martin 1

to 1
keep 1
his 1
pair 1
hid 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
pants 1
they 1

him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1

a 1
boy 1
for 1
taking 1

no 1
danger 1
martin 1
wasnt 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
head 1
i 1
mean 1
he 1
still 1
acted 1
like 1
a 1
threeyearold 1
he 1
just 1
wanted 1
the 1
glasses 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
says 1
rue 1
hearing 1
this 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
like 1
district 1
is 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
safe 1
haven 1
of 1
course 1
people 1
keel 1
over 1
from 1
starvation 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
imagine 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
murdering 1
a 1
simpleminded 1
child 1
theres 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
one 1
of 1
greasy 1
saes 1
grandkids 1
who 1
wanders 1
around 1
the 1
hob 1
shes 1
not 1
quite 1
right 1
but 1
shes 1
treated 1
as 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pet 1
people 1
toss 1
her 1
scraps 1
and 1
things 1
so 1
what 1
do 1
these 1
do 1
i 1
ask 1
rue 1
taking 1
the 1
glasses 1
they 1
let 1
you 1
see 1
in 1
complete 1
darkness 1
says 1
rue 1
try 1
them 1
tonight 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
goes 1
down 1
i 1
give 1
rue 1
some 1
matches 1
and 1
she 1
makes 1
sure 1
i 1
have 1
plenty 1
of 1
leaves 1
in 1
case 1
my 1
stings 1
flare 1
up 1
again 1
we 1
extinguish 1
our 1
fire 1
and 1
head 1
upstream 1
until 1
its 1
almost 1
nightfall 1
where 1
do 1
you 1
sleep 1
i 1
ask 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
she 1
nods 1
in 1
just 1
your 1
jacket 1
rue 1
holds 1
up 1
her 1
extra 1
pair 1
of 1
socks 1
i 1
have 1
these 1
for 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
how 1
cold 1
the 1
nights 1
have 1
been 1
you 1
can 1
share 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
well 1
both 1
easily 1
fit 1
her 1
face 1
lights 1
up 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
this 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
she 1
dared 1
hope 1
for 1
we 1
pick 1
a 1
fork 1
high 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
settle 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
anthem 1
begins 1
to 1
play 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
deaths 1
today 1
rue 1
i 1
only 1
woke 1
up 1
today 1
how 1
many 1
nights 1
did 1
i 1
miss 1
the 1
anthem 1
should 1
block 1
out 1
our 1
words 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
whisper 1
i 1
even 1
take 1
the 1
precaution 1
of 1
covering 1
my 1
lips 1
with 1
my 1
hand 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
the 1
audience 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
im 1
planning 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
about 1
peeta 1
taking 1
a 1
cue 1
from 1
me 1
she 1
does 1
the 1
same 1
two 1
she 1
says 1
the 1
girls 1
from 1
districts 1
one 1
and 1
four 1
are 1
dead 1
theres 1
ten 1
of 1
us 1
left 1
something 1
strange 1
happened 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
did 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
venom 1
making 1
me 1
imagine 1
things 1
i 1
say 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
my 1
district 1
peeta 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
saved 1
my 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
the 1
careers 1
hes 1
not 1
with 1
them 1
now 1
she 1
says 1
ive 1
spied 1
on 1
their 1
base 1
camp 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
they 1
made 1
it 1
back 1
before 1
they 1
collapsed 1
from 1
the 1
stingers 1
but 1
hes 1
not 1
there 1
maybe 1
he 1
did 1
save 1
you 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
i 1
dont 1
answer 1
if 1
in 1
fact 1
peeta 1
did 1
save 1
me 1
im 1
in 1
his 1
debt 1
again 1
and 1
this 1
cant 1
be 1
paid 1
back 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
probably 1
just 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
act 1
you 1
know 1
to 1
make 1
people 1
think 1
hes 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
me 1
oh 1
says 1
rue 1
thoughtfully 1
i 1
didnt 1
think 1
that 1
was 1
an 1
act 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
worked 1
it 1
out 1
with 1
our 1
mentor 1
the 1
anthem 1
ends 1
and 1
the 1
sky 1
goes 1
dark 1
lets 1
try 1
out 1
these 1
glasses 1
i 1
pull 1
out 1
the 1
glasses 1
and 1
slip 1
them 1
on 1
rue 1
wasnt 1
kidding 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
everything 1
from 1
the 1
leaves 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
to 1
a 1
skunk 1
strolling 1
through 1
the 1
bushes 1
a 1
good 1
fifty 1
feet 1
away 1
i 1
could 1
kill 1
it 1
from 1
here 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
i 1
could 1
kill 1
anyone 1
i 1
wonder 1
who 1
else 1
got 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
these 1
i 1
say 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
two 1
pairs 1
but 1
theyve 1
got 1
everything 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
rue 1
says 1
and 1
theyre 1
so 1
strong 1
were 1
strong 1
too 1
i 1
say 1
just 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
way 1
you 1
are 1
you 1
can 1
shoot 1
she 1
says 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
you 1
can 1
feed 1
yourself 1
can 1
they 1
i 1
ask 1
they 1
dont 1
need 1
to 1
they 1
have 1
all 1
those 1
supplies 1
rue 1
says 1
say 1
they 1
didnt 1
say 1
the 1
supplies 1
were 1
gone 1
how 1
long 1
would 1
they 1
last 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
mean 1
its 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
right 1
but 1
katniss 1
theyre 1
not 1
hungry 1
says 1
rue 1
no 1
theyre 1
not 1
thats 1
the 1
problem 1
i 1
agree 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
plan 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
isnt 1
motivated 1
by 1
the 1
need 1
for 1
flight 1
and 1
evasion 1
an 1
offensive 1
plan 1
i 1
think 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
fix 1
that 1
rue 1
rue 1
has 1
decided 1
to 1
trust 1
me 1
wholeheartedly 1
i 1
know 1
this 1
because 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
anthem 1
finishes 1
she 1
snuggles 1
up 1
against 1
me 1
and 1
falls 1
asleep 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
have 1
any 1
misgivings 1
about 1
her 1
as 1
i 1
take 1
no 1
particular 1
precautions 1
if 1
shed 1
wanted 1
me 1
dead 1
all 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
disappear 1
from 1
that 1
tree 1
without 1
pointing 1
out 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
nest 1
needling 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
back 1
of 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
the 1
obvious 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
cant 1
win 1
these 1
games 1
but 1
since 1
the 1
odds 1
are 1
still 1
against 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
surviving 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
ignore 1
the 1
thought 1
besides 1
im 1
distracted 1
by 1
my 1
latest 1
idea 1
about 1
the 1
careers 1
and 1
their 1
supplies 1
somehow 1
rue 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
destroy 1
their 1
food 1
im 1
pretty 1
sure 1
feeding 1
themselves 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
tremendous 1
struggle 1
traditionally 1
the 1
career 1
tributes 1
strategy 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
food 1
early 1
on 1
and 1
work 1
from 1
there 1
the 1
years 1
when 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
protected 1
it 1
well 1
one 1
year 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
hideous 1
reptiles 1
destroyed 1
it 1
another 1
a 1
gamemakers 1
flood 1
washed 1
it 1
away 1
those 1
are 1
usually 1
the 1
years 1
that 1
tributes 1
from 1
other 1
districts 1
have 1
won 1
that 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
red 1
growing 1
up 1
is 1
actually 1
to 1
their 1
disadvantage 1
because 1
they 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
be 1
hungry 1
not 1
the 1
way 1
rue 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
but 1
im 1
too 1
exhausted 1
to 1
begin 1
any 1
detailed 1
plan 1
tonight 1
my 1
wounds 1
recovering 1
my 1
mind 1
still 1
a 1
bit 1
foggy 1
from 1
the 1
venom 1
and 1
the 1
warmth 1
of 1
rue 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
her 1
head 1
cradled 1
on 1
my 1
shoulder 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
i 1
realize 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
how 1
very 1
lonely 1
ive 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
how 1
comforting 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
another 1
human 1
being 1
can 1
be 1
i 1
give 1
in 1
to 1
my 1
drowsiness 1
resolving 1
that 1
tomorrow 1
the 1
tables 1
will 1
turn 1
tomorrow 1
its 1
the 1
careers 1
who 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
watch 1
their 1
backs 1
the 1
boom 1
of 1
the 1
cannon 1
jolts 1
me 1
awake 1
the 1
skys 1
streaked 1
with 1
light 1
the 1
birds 1
already 1
chattering 1
rue 1
perches 1
in 1
a 1
branch 1
across 1
from 1
me 1
her 1
hands 1
cupping 1
something 1
we 1
wait 1
listening 1
for 1
more 1
shots 1
but 1
there 1

any 1
who 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1

help 1
thinking 1
of 1
peeta 1

have 1
been 1
any 1
of 1

guess 1
well 1

rue 1
no 1
telling 1
but 1
its 1
good 1
for 1
us 1
a 1
death 1
should 1
hold 1
the 1
crowd 1
for 1
a 1
bit 1
maybe 1
well 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
before 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
decide 1
things 1

moving 1
too 1
slowly 1

revealing 1
two 1
big 1
eggs 1
what 1

marshy 1
area 1
over 1
that 1
way 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
waterbird 1
she 1
says 1
itd 1
be 1
nice 1
to 1
cook 1
them 1
but 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
wants 1
to 1
risk 1
a 1
fire 1
my 1
guess 1
is 1
the 1
tribute 1
who 1
died 1
today 1
was 1
a 1
victim 1
of 1
the 1
careers 1
which 1
means 1
theyve 1
recovered 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
we 1
each 1
suck 1
out 1
the 1
insides 1
of 1
an 1
egg 1
eat 1
a 1
rabbit 1
leg 1
and 1
some 1
berries 1
its 1
a 1
good 1
breakfast 1
anywhere 1
ready 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
pulling 1
on 1
my 1
pack 1
do 1
what 1
says 1
rue 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
bounces 1
up 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
shes 1
up 1
for 1
whatever 1
i 1
propose 1
today 1
we 1
take 1
out 1
the 1
careers 1
food 1
i 1
say 1
really 1
how 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
glint 1
of 1
excitement 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
shes 1
exactly 1
the 1
opposite 1
of 1
prim 1
for 1
whom 1
adventures 1
are 1
an 1
ordeal 1
no 1
idea 1
come 1
on 1
well 1
figure 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
while 1
we 1
hunt 1
i 1
say 1
we 1
dont 1
get 1
much 1
hunting 1
done 1
though 1
because 1
im 1
too 1
busy 1
getting 1
every 1
scrap 1
of 1
information 1
i 1
can 1
out 1
of 1
rue 1
about 1
the 1
careers 1
base 1
shes 1
only 1
been 1
in 1
to 1
spy 1
on 1
them 1
briefly 1
but 1
shes 1
observant 1
they 1
have 1
set 1
up 1
their 1
camp 1
beside 1
the 1
lake 1
their 1
supply 1
stash 1
is 1
about 1
thirty 1
yards 1
away 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
theyve 1
been 1
leaving 1
another 1
tribute 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
the 1
supplies 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
three 1
i 1
ask 1
hes 1
working 1
with 1
them 1
yes 1
he 1
stays 1
at 1
the 1
camp 1
fulltime 1
he 1
got 1
stung 1
too 1
when 1
they 1
drew 1
the 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
says 1
rue 1
i 1
guess 1
they 1
agreed 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
if 1
he 1
acted 1
as 1
their 1
guard 1
but 1
hes 1
not 1
very 1
big 1
what 1
weapons 1
does 1
he 1
have 1
i 1
ask 1
not 1
much 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
spear 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
hold 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
off 1
with 1
that 1
but 1
thresh 1
could 1
kill 1
him 1
easily 1
says 1
rue 1
and 1
the 1
foods 1
just 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
i 1
say 1
she 1
nods 1
somethings 1
not 1
quite 1
right 1
about 1
that 1
whole 1
setup 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
what 1
exactly 1
says 1
rue 1
katniss 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
food 1
how 1
would 1
you 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
burn 1
it 1
dump 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
lake 1
soak 1
it 1
in 1
fuel 1
i 1
poke 1
rue 1
in 1
the 1
belly 1
just 1
like 1
i 1
would 1
prim 1
eat 1
it 1
she 1
giggles 1
dont 1
worry 1
ill 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
destroying 1
things 1
is 1
much 1
easier 1
than 1
making 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
we 1
dig 1
roots 1
we 1
gather 1
berries 1
and 1
greens 1
we 1
devise 1
a 1
strategy 1
in 1
hushed 1
voices 1
and 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
know 1
rue 1
the 1
oldest 1

six 1
kids 1

siblings 1
who 1
gives 1
her 1
rations 1
to 1
the 1
younger 1
ones 1
who 1
forages 1
in 1
the 1
meadows 1
in 1
a 1
district 1
where 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
are 1
far 1
less 1
obliging 1
than 1
ours 1
rue 1
who 1
when 1
you 1
ask 1
her 1
what 1
she 1
loves 1

and 1

of 1
usefulness 1
at 1

fournote 1
run 1
in 1

how 1
everyone 1

dangerous 1
though 1
if 1
you 1
get 1
too 1
near 1
their 1
nests 1
but 1
you 1

i 1
turn 1
and 1
head 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
feeling 1
somehow 1
worried 1
about 1
rue 1
being 1
killed 1
about 1
rue 1
not 1
being 1
killed 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
being 1
left 1
for 1
last 1
about 1
leaving 1
rue 1
alone 1
about 1
leaving 1
prim 1
alone 1
back 1
home 1
no 1
prim 1
has 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
gale 1
and 1
a 1
baker 1
who 1
has 1
promised 1
she 1
wont 1
go 1
hungry 1
rue 1
has 1
only 1
me 1
once 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
to 1
follow 1
it 1
downhill 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
i 1
initially 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
after 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
attack 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
cautious 1
as 1
i 1
move 1
along 1
the 1
water 1
though 1
because 1
i 1
find 1
my 1
thoughts 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
unanswered 1
questions 1
most 1
of 1
which 1
concern 1
peeta 1
the 1
cannon 1
that 1
fired 1
early 1
this 1
morning 1
did 1
that 1
signify 1
his 1
death 1
if 1
so 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
die 1
at 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
a 1
career 1
and 1
was 1
that 1
in 1
revenge 1
for 1
letting 1
me 1
live 1
i 1
struggle 1
again 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
moment 1
over 1
glimmers 1
body 1
when 1
he 1
burst 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
but 1
just 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
sparkling 1
leads 1
me 1
to 1
doubt 1
everything 1
that 1
happened 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
moving 1
very 1
slowly 1
yesterday 1
because 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
shallow 1
stretch 1
where 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
bath 1
in 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
i 1
stop 1
to 1
replenish 1
my 1
water 1
and 1
add 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
mud 1
to 1
my 1
backpack 1
it 1
seems 1
bent 1
on 1
reverting 1
to 1
orange 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
many 1
times 1
i 1
cover 1
it 1
my 1
proximity 1
to 1
the 1
careers 1
camp 1
sharpens 1
my 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
closer 1
i 1
get 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
more 1
guarded 1
i 1
am 1
pausing 1
frequently 1
to 1
listen 1
for 1
unnatural 1
sounds 1
an 1
arrow 1
already 1
fitted 1
into 1
the 1
string 1
of 1
my 1
bow 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
any 1
other 1
tributes 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
notice 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
rue 1
has 1
mentioned 1
patches 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
berries 1
a 1
bush 1
with 1
the 1
leaves 1
that 1
healed 1
my 1
stings 1
clusters 1
of 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
nests 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
i 1
was 1
trapped 1
in 1
and 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
the 1
blackandwhite 1
flash 1
of 1
a 1
mockingjay 1
wing 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
high 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
when 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
the 1
abandoned 1
nest 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
i 1
pause 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
gather 1
my 1
courage 1
rue 1
has 1
given 1
specific 1
instructions 1
on 1
how 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
best 1
spying 1
place 1
near 1
the 1
lake 1
from 1
this 1
point 1
remember 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
youre 1
the 1
hunter 1
now 1
not 1
them 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
firmer 1
grasp 1
on 1
my 1
bow 1
and 1
go 1
on 1
i 1
make 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
copse 1
rue 1
has 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
and 1
again 1
have 1
to 1
admire 1
her 1
cleverness 1
its 1
right 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
but 1
the 1
bushy 1
foliage 1
is 1
so 1
thick 1
down 1
low 1
i 1
can 1
easily 1
observe 1
the 1
career 1
camp 1
without 1
being 1
spotted 1
between 1
us 1
lies 1
the 1
flat 1
expanse 1
where 1
the 1
games 1
began 1
there 1
are 1
four 1
tributes 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
cato 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
a 1
scrawny 1
ashenskinned 1
boy 1
who 1
must 1
be 1
from 1
district 1
he 1
made 1
almost 1
no 1
impression 1
on 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
during 1
our 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
almost 1
nothing 1
about 1
him 1
not 1
his 1
costume 1
not 1
his 1
training 1
score 1
not 1
his 1
interview 1
even 1
now 1
as 1
he 1
sits 1
there 1
fiddling 1
with 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
plastic 1
box 1
hes 1
easily 1
ignored 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
his 1
large 1
and 1
domineering 1
companions 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
value 1
or 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
bothered 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
still 1
seeing 1
him 1
only 1
adds 1
to 1
my 1
sense 1
of 1
unease 1
over 1
why 1
the 1
careers 1
would 1
possibly 1
leave 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
guard 1
why 1
they 1
have 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
all 1
all 1
four 1
tributes 1
seem 1
to 1
still 1
be 1
recovering 1
from 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
attack 1
even 1
from 1
here 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
large 1
swollen 1
lumps 1
on 1
their 1
bodies 1
they 1
must 1
not 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
sense 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
stingers 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
known 1
about 1
the 1
leaves 1
that 1
healed 1
them 1
apparently 1
whatever 1
medicines 1
they 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
have 1
been 1
ineffective 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
sits 1
in 1
its 1
original 1
position 1
but 1
its 1
insides 1
have 1
been 1
picked 1
clean 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
supplies 1
held 1
in 1
crates 1
burlap 1
sacks 1
and 1
plastic 1
bins 1
are 1
piled 1
neatly 1
in 1
a 1
pyramid 1
in 1
what 1
seems 1
a 1
questionable 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
camp 1
others 1
are 1
sprinkled 1
around 1
the 1
perimeter 1
of 1
the 1
pyramid 1
almost 1
mimicking 1
the 1
layout 1
of 1
supplies 1
around 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
at 1
the 1
onset 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
a 1
canopy 1
of 1
netting 1
that 1
aside 1
from 1
discouraging 1
birds 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
useless 1
shelters 1
the 1
pyramid 1
itself 1
the 1
whole 1
setup 1
is 1
completely 1
perplexing 1
the 1
distance 1
the 1
netting 1
and 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
one 1
things 1
for 1
sure 1
destroying 1
those 1
supplies 1
is 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
simple 1
as 1
it 1
looks 1
some 1
other 1
factor 1
is 1
at 1
play 1
here 1
and 1
id 1
better 1
stay 1
put 1
until 1
i 1
figure 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
guess 1
is 1
the 1
pyramid 1
is 1
boobytrapped 1
in 1
some 1
manner 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
concealed 1
pits 1
descending 1
nets 1
a 1
thread 1
that 1
when 1
broken 1
sends 1
a 1
poisonous 1
dart 1
into 1
your 1
heart 1
really 1
the 1
possibilities 1
are 1
endless 1
while 1
i 1
am 1
mulling 1
over 1
my 1
options 1
i 1
hear 1
cato 1
shout 1
out 1
hes 1
pointing 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
far 1
beyond 1
me 1
and 1
without 1
turning 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
rue 1
must 1
have 1
set 1
the 1
first 1
campfire 1
wed 1
made 1
sure 1
to 1
gather 1
enough 1
green 1
wood 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
smoke 1
noticeable 1
the 1
careers 1
begin 1
to 1
arm 1
themselves 1
at 1
once 1
an 1
argument 1
breaks 1
out 1
its 1
loud 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
it 1
concerns 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
should 1
stay 1
or 1
accompany 1
them 1
hes 1
coming 1
we 1
need 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
his 1
jobs 1
done 1
here 1
anyway 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
touch 1
those 1
supplies 1
says 1
cato 1
what 1
about 1
lover 1
boy 1
says 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
i 1
keep 1
telling 1
you 1
forget 1
about 1
him 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
i 1
cut 1
him 1
its 1
a 1
miracle 1
he 1
hasnt 1
bled 1
to 1
death 1
yet 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
hes 1
in 1
no 1
shape 1
to 1
raid 1
us 1
says 1
cato 1
so 1
peeta 1
is 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
wounded 1
badly 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
on 1
what 1
motivated 1
him 1
to 1
betray 1
the 1
careers 1
come 1
on 1
says 1
cato 1
he 1
thrusts 1
a 1
spear 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
they 1
head 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
i 1
hear 1
as 1
they 1
enter 1
the 1
woods 1
is 1
cato 1
saying 1
when 1
we 1
find 1
her 1
i 1
kill 1
her 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
way 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
interferes 1
somehow 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
hes 1
talking 1
about 1
rue 1
she 1
didnt 1
drop 1
a 1
nest 1
of 1
acker 1
jackers 1
on 1
him 1
i 1
stay 1
put 1
for 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
trying 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
about 1
the 1
supplies 1
the 1
one 1
advantage 1
i 1
have 1
with 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
is 1
distance 1
i 1
could 1
send 1
a 1
flaming 1
arrow 1
into 1
the 1
pyramid 1
easily 1
enough 1
im 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
shot 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
through 1
those 1
openings 1
in 1
the 1
net 1
but 1
theres 1
no 1
guarantee 1
it 1
would 1
catch 1
more 1
likely 1
itd 1
just 1
burn 1
itself 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
what 1
id 1
have 1
achieved 1
nothing 1
and 1
given 1
them 1
far 1
too 1
much 1
information 1
about 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
an 1
accomplice 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
use 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
with 1
accuracy 1
theres 1
no 1
alternative 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
closer 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
i 1
cant 1
discover 1
what 1
exactly 1
protects 1
the 1
supplies 1
in 1
fact 1
im 1
just 1
about 1
to 1
reveal 1
myself 1
when 1
a 1
movement 1
catches 1
my 1
eye 1
several 1
hundred 1
yards 1
to 1
my 1
right 1
i 1
see 1
someone 1
emerge 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
rue 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
recognize 1
foxface 1
shes 1
the 1
one 1
we 1
couldnt 1
remember 1
this 1
morning 1
creeping 1
out 1
onto 1
the 1
plain 1
when 1
she 1
decides 1
its 1
safe 1
she 1
runs 1
for 1
the 1
pyramid 1
with 1
quick 1
small 1
steps 1
just 1
before 1
she 1
reaches 1
the 1
circle 1
of 1
supplies 1
that 1
have 1
been 1
littered 1
around 1
the 1
pyramid 1
she 1
stops 1
searches 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
carefully 1
places 1
her 1
feet 1
on 1
a 1
spot 1
then 1
she 1
begins 1
to 1
approach 1
the 1
pyramid 1
with 1
strange 1
little 1
hops 1
sometimes 1
landing 1
on 1
one 1
foot 1
teetering 1
slightly 1
sometimes 1
risking 1
a 1
few 1
steps 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
she 1
launches 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
over 1
a 1
small 1
barrel 1
and 1
lands 1
poised 1
on 1
her 1
tiptoes 1
but 1
she 1
overshot 1
slightly 1
and 1
her 1
momentum 1
throws 1
her 1
forward 1
i 1
hear 1
her 1
give 1
a 1
sharp 1
squeal 1
as 1
her 1
hands 1
hit 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
nothing 1
happens 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
shes 1
regained 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
continues 1
until 1
she 1
has 1
reached 1
the 1
bulk 1
of 1
the 1
supplies 1
so 1
im 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
booby 1
trap 1
but 1
its 1
clearly 1
more 1
complex 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
imagined 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
girl 1
too 1
how 1
wily 1
is 1
she 1
to 1
have 1
discovered 1
this 1
path 1
into 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
replicate 1
it 1
so 1
neatly 1
she 1
fills 1
her 1
pack 1
taking 1
a 1
few 1
items 1
from 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
containers 1
crackers 1
from 1
a 1
crate 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
apples 1
from 1
a 1
burlap 1
sack 1
that 1
hangs 1
suspended 1
from 1
a 1
rope 1
off 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
bin 1
but 1
only 1
a 1
handful 1
from 1
each 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
tip 1
off 1
that 1
the 1
food 1
is 1
missing 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
cause 1
suspicion 1
and 1
then 1
shes 1
doing 1
her 1
odd 1
little 1
dance 1
back 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
and 1
scampering 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
again 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
i 1
realize 1
im 1
grinding 1
my 1
teeth 1
in 1
frustration 1
foxface 1
has 1
confirmed 1
what 1
id 1
already 1
guessed 1
but 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
trap 1
have 1
they 1
laid 1
that 1
requires 1
such 1
dexterity 1
has 1
so 1
many 1
trigger 1
points 1
why 1
did 1
she 1
squeal 1
so 1
as 1
her 1
hands 1
made 1
contact 1
with 1
the 1
earth 1
youd 1
have 1
thought 1
and 1
slowly 1
it 1
begins 1
to 1
dawn 1
on 1
me 1
youd 1
have 1
thought 1
the 1
very 1
ground 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
explode 1
its 1
mined 1
i 1
whisper 1
that 1
explains 1
everything 1
the 1
careers 1
willingness 1
to 1
leave 1
their 1
supplies 1
foxfaces 1
reaction 1
the 1
involvement 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
where 1
they 1
have 1
the 1
factories 1
where 1
they 1
make 1
televisions 1
and 1
automobiles 1
and 1
explosives 1
but 1
where 1
did 1
he 1
get 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
supplies 1
thats 1
not 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
weapon 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
usually 1
provide 1
given 1
that 1
they 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
tributes 1
draw 1
blood 1
personally 1
i 1
slip 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bushes 1
and 1
cross 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
round 1
metal 1
plates 1
that 1
lifted 1
the 1
tributes 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
the 1
ground 1
around 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
dug 1
up 1
and 1
patted 1
back 1
down 1
the 1
land 1
mines 1
were 1
disabled 1
after 1
the 1
sixty 1
seconds 1
we 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
plates 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
must 1
have 1
managed 1
to 1
reactivate 1
them 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
anyone 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
do 1
that 1
i 1
bet 1
it 1
came 1
as 1
a 1
shock 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
well 1
hurray 1
for 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
for 1
putting 1
one 1
over 1
on 1
them 1
but 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
supposed 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
obviously 1
i 1
cant 1
go 1
strolling 1
into 1
that 1
mess 1
without 1
blowing 1
myself 1
skyhigh 1
as 1
for 1
sending 1
in 1
a 1
burning 1
arrow 1
thats 1
more 1
laughable 1
than 1
ever 1
the 1
mines 1
are 1
set 1
off 1
by 1
pressure 1
it 1
doesnt 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
lot 1
either 1
one 1
year 1
a 1
girl 1
dropped 1
her 1
token 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
ball 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
at 1
her 1
plate 1
and 1
they 1
literally 1
had 1
to 1
scrape 1
bits 1
of 1
her 1
off 1
the 1
ground 1
my 1
arms 1
pretty 1
good 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
chuck 1
some 1
rocks 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
what 1
maybe 1
one 1
mine 1
that 1
could 1
start 1
a 1
chain 1
reaction 1
or 1
could 1
it 1
would 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
have 1
placed 1
the 1
mines 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
a 1
single 1
mine 1
would 1
not 1
disturb 1
the 1
others 1
thereby 1
protecting 1
the 1
supplies 1
but 1
ensuring 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
invader 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
only 1
blew 1
up 1
one 1
mine 1
id 1
draw 1
the 1
careers 1
back 1
down 1
on 1
me 1
for 1
sure 1
and 1
anyway 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
thinking 1
theres 1
that 1
net 1
clearly 1
strung 1
to 1
deflect 1
any 1
such 1
attack 1
besides 1
what 1
id 1
really 1
need 1
is 1
to 1
throw 1
about 1
thirty 1
rocks 1
in 1
there 1
at 1
once 1
setting 1
off 1
a 1
big 1
chain 1
reaction 1
demolishing 1
the 1
whole 1
lot 1
i 1
glance 1
back 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
woods 1
the 1
smoke 1
from 1
rues 1
second 1
fire 1
is 1
wafting 1
toward 1
the 1
sky 1
by 1
now 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
probably 1
begun 1
to 1
suspect 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
trick 1
time 1
is 1
running 1
out 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
solution 1
to 1
this 1
i 1
know 1
there 1
is 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
focus 1
hard 1
enough 1
i 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
pyramid 1
the 1
bins 1
the 1
crates 1
too 1
heavy 1
to 1
topple 1
over 1
with 1
an 1
arrow 1
maybe 1
one 1
contains 1
cooking 1
oil 1
and 1
the 1
burning 1
arrow 1
idea 1
is 1
reviving 1
when 1
i 1
realize 1
i 1
could 1
end 1
uplosing 1
all 1
twelve 1
of 1
my 1
arrows 1
and 1
not 1
get 1
a 1
direct 1
hit 1
on 1
an 1
oil 1
bin 1
since 1
id 1
just 1
be 1
guessing 1
im 1
genuinely 1
thinking 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
recreate 1
foxfaces 1
trip 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
pyramid 1
in 1
hopes 1
of 1
finding 1
a 1
new 1
means 1
of 1
destruction 1
when 1
my 1
eyes 1
light 1
on 1
the 1
burlap 1
bag 1
of 1
apples 1
i 1
could 1
sever 1
the 1
rope 1
in 1
one 1
shot 1
didnt 1
i 1
do 1
as 1
much 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
its 1
a 1
big 1
bag 1
but 1
it 1
still 1
might 1
only 1
be 1
good 1
for 1
one 1
explosion 1
if 1
only 1
i 1
could 1
free 1
the 1
apples 1
themselves 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
move 1
into 1
range 1
and 1
give 1
myself 1
three 1
arrows 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
job 1
done 1
i 1
place 1
my 1
feet 1
carefully 1
block 1
out 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
i 1
take 1
meticulous 1
aim 1
the 1
first 1
arrow 1
tears 1
through 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bag 1
near 1
the 1
top 1
leaving 1
a 1
split 1
in 1
the 1
burlap 1
the 1
second 1
widens 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
gaping 1
hole 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
first 1
apple 1
teetering 1
when 1
i 1
let 1
the 1
third 1
arrow 1
go 1
catching 1
the 1
torn 1
flap 1
of 1
burlap 1
and 1
ripping 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
bag 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
everything 1
seems 1
frozen 1
in 1
time 1
then 1
the 1
apples 1
spill 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
im 1
blown 1
backward 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
impact 1
with 1
the 1
hardpacked 1
earth 1
of 1
the 1
plain 1
knocks 1
the 1
wind 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
my 1
backpack 1
does 1
little 1
to 1
soften 1
the 1
blow 1
fortunately 1
my 1
quiver 1
has 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
crook 1
of 1
my 1
elbow 1
sparing 1
both 1
itself 1
and 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
my 1
bow 1
is 1
locked 1
in 1
my 1
grasp 1
the 1
ground 1
still 1
shakes 1
with 1
explosions 1
i 1
cant 1
hear 1
them 1
i 1
cant 1
hear 1
anything 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
but 1
the 1
apples 1
must 1
have 1
set 1
off 1
enough 1
mines 1
causing 1
debris 1
to 1
activate 1
the 1
others 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
shield 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
my 1
arms 1
as 1
shattered 1
bits 1
of 1
matter 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
burning 1
rain 1
down 1
around 1
me 1
an 1
acrid 1
smoke 1
fills 1
the 1
air 1
which 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
best 1
remedy 1
for 1
someone 1
trying 1
to 1
regain 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
breathe 1
after 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
the 1
ground 1
stops 1
vibrating 1
i 1
roll 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
and 1
allow 1
myself 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
smoldering 1
wreckage 1
that 1
was 1
recently 1
the 1
pyramid 1
the 1
careers 1
arent 1
likely 1
to 1
salvage 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
id 1
better 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
i 1
think 1
theyll 1
be 1
making 1
a 1
beeline 1
for 1
the 1
place 1
but 1
once 1
im 1
on 1
my 1
feet 1
i 1
realize 1
escape 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
simple 1
im 1
dizzy 1
not 1
the 1
slightly 1
wobbly 1
kind 1
but 1
the 1
kind 1
that 1
sends 1
the 1
trees 1
swooping 1
around 1
you 1
and 1
causes 1
the 1
earth 1
to 1
move 1
in 1
waves 1
under 1
your 1
feet 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
few 1
steps 1
and 1
somehow 1
wind 1
up 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
i 1
wait 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
to 1
let 1
it 1
pass 1
but 1
it 1
doesnt 1
panic 1
begins 1
to 1
set 1
in 1
i 1
cant 1
stay 1
here 1
flight 1
is 1
essential 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
neither 1
walk 1
nor 1
hear 1
i 1
place 1
a 1
hand 1
to 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
turned 1
toward 1
the 1
blast 1
and 1
it 1
comes 1
away 1
bloody 1
have 1
i 1
gone 1
deaf 1
from 1
the 1
explosion 1
the 1
idea 1
frightens 1
me 1
i 1
rely 1
as 1
much 1
on 1
my 1
ears 1
as 1
my 1
eyes 1
as 1
a 1
hunter 1
maybe 1
more 1
at 1
times 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
let 1
my 1
fear 1
show 1
absolutely 1
positively 1
i 1
am 1
live 1
on 1
every 1
screen 1
in 1
panem 1
no 1
blood 1
trails 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
and 1
manage 1
to 1
pull 1
my 1
hood 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
tie 1
the 1
cord 1
under 1
my 1
chin 1
with 1
uncooperative 1
fingers 1
that 1
should 1
help 1
soak 1
up 1
the 1
blood 1
i 1
cant 1
walk 1
but 1
can 1
i 1
crawl 1
i 1
move 1
forward 1
tentatively 1
yes 1
if 1
i 1
go 1
very 1
slowly 1
i 1
can 1
crawl 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
will 1
offer 1
insufficient 1
cover 1
my 1
only 1
hope 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
rues 1
copse 1
and 1
conceal 1
myself 1
in 1
greenery 1
i 1
cant 1
get 1
caught 1
out 1
here 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
not 1
only 1
will 1
i 1
face 1
death 1
its 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
painful 1
one 1
at 1
catos 1
hand 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
prim 1
having 1
to 1
watch 1
that 1
keeps 1
me 1
doggedly 1
inching 1
my 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
hideout 1
another 1
blast 1
knocks 1
me 1
flat 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
a 1
stray 1
mine 1
set 1
off 1
by 1
some 1
collapsing 1
crate 1
this 1
happens 1
twice 1
more 1
im 1
reminded 1
of 1
those 1
last 1
few 1
kernels 1
that 1
burst 1
when 1
prim 1
and 1
i 1
pop 1
corn 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
say 1
i 1
make 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
nick 1
of 1
time 1
is 1
an 1
understatement 1
i 1
have 1
literally 1
just 1
dragged 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
tangle 1
of 1
hushes 1
at 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
when 1
theres 1
cato 1
barreling 1
onto 1
the 1
plain 1
soon 1
followed 1
by 1
his 1
companions 1
his 1
rage 1
is 1
so 1
extreme 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
comical 1
so 1
people 1
really 1
do 1
tear 1
out 1
their 1
hair 1
and 1
beat 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
their 1
fists 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
aimed 1
at 1
me 1
at 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
him 1
add 1
to 1
that 1
my 1
proximity 1
my 1
inability 1
to 1
run 1
or 1
defend 1
myself 1
and 1
in 1
fact 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
has 1
me 1
terrified 1
im 1
glad 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
makes 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
the 1
cameras 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
close 1
shot 1
of 1
me 1
because 1
im 1
biting 1
my 1
nails 1
like 1
theres 1
no 1
tomorrow 1
gnawing 1
off 1
the 1
last 1
bits 1
of 1
nail 1
polish 1
trying 1
to 1
keep 1
my 1
teeth 1
from 1
chattering 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
throws 1
stones 1
into 1
the 1
ruins 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
declared 1
all 1
the 1
mines 1
activated 1
because 1
the 1
careers 1
are 1
approaching 1
the 1
wreckage 1
cato 1
has 1
finished 1
the 1
first 1
phase 1
of 1
his 1
tantrum 1
and 1
takes 1
out 1
his 1
anger 1
on 1
the 1
smoking 1
remains 1
by 1
kicking 1
open 1
various 1
containers 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
are 1
poking 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
mess 1
looking 1
for 1
anything 1
to 1
salvage 1
but 1
theres 1
nothing 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
has 1
done 1
his 1
job 1
too 1
well 1
this 1
idea 1
must 1
occur 1
to 1
cato 1
too 1
because 1
he 1
turns 1
on 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
shouting 1
at 1
him 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
only 1
has 1
time 1
to 1
turn 1
and 1
run 1
before 1
cato 1
catches 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
headlock 1
from 1
behind 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
muscles 1
ripple 1
in 1
catos 1
arms 1
as 1
he 1
sharply 1
jerks 1
the 1
boys 1
head 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
its 1
that 1
quick 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
careers 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
trying 1
to 1
calm 1
cato 1
down 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
they 1
keep 1
pointing 1
at 1
the 1
sky 1
which 1
puzzles 1
me 1
until 1
i 1
realize 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
think 1
whoever 1
set 1
off 1
the 1
explosions 1
is 1
dead 1
they 1
dont 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
arrows 1
and 1
the 1
apples 1
they 1
assume 1
the 1
booby 1
trap 1
was 1
faulty 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
tribute 1
who 1
blew 1
up 1
the 1
supplies 1
was 1
killed 1
doing 1
it 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
cannon 1
shot 1
it 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
easily 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
subsequent 1
explosions 1
the 1
shattered 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
thief 1
removed 1

hovercraft 1
they 1
retire 1
to 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
to 1
allow 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
to 1
retrieve 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
they 1
wait 1
i 1
suppose 1
a 1
cannon 1
goes 1
off 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
appears 1
and 1
takes 1
the 1
dead 1
boy 1
the 1
sun 1
dips 1
below 1
the 1
horizon 1
night 1
falls 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
seal 1
and 1
know 1
the 1
anthem 1
must 1
have 1
begun 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
darkness 1
they 1
show 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
they 1
show 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
who 1
must 1
have 1
died 1
this 1
morning 1
then 1
the 1
seal 1
reappears 1
so 1
now 1
they 1
know 1
the 1
bomber 1
survived 1
in 1
the 1
seals 1
light 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
cato 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
put 1
on 1
their 1
nightvision 1
glasses 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
ignites 1
a 1
tree 1
branch 1
for 1
a 1
torch 1
illuminating 1
the 1
grim 1
determination 1
on 1
all 1
their 1
faces 1
the 1
careers 1
stride 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
hunt 1
the 1
dizziness 1
has 1
subsided 1
and 1
while 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
is 1
still 1
deafened 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
a 1
ringing 1
in 1
my 1
right 1
which 1
seems 1
a 1
good 1
sign 1
theres 1
no 1
point 1
in 1
leaving 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
though 1
im 1
about 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
the 1
crime 1
scene 1
they 1
probably 1
think 1
the 1
bomber 1
has 1
a 1
two 1
or 1
threehour 1
lead 1
on 1
them 1
still 1
its 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
i 1
risk 1
moving 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
i 1
do 1
is 1
dig 1
out 1
my 1
own 1
glasses 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
which 1
relaxes 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
hunters 1
senses 1
working 1
i 1
drink 1
some 1
water 1
and 1
wash 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
ear 1
fearing 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
meat 1
will 1
draw 1
unwanted 1
predators 1
fresh 1
blood 1
is 1
bad 1
enough 1
i 1
make 1
a 1
good 1
meal 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
greens 1
and 1
roots 1
and 1
berries 1
rue 1
and 1
i 1
gathered 1
today 1
where 1
is 1
my 1
little 1
ally 1
did 1
she 1
make 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
rendezvous 1
point 1
is 1
she 1
worried 1
about 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
sky 1
has 1
shown 1
were 1
both 1
alive 1
i 1
run 1
through 1
the 1
surviving 1
tributes 1
on 1
my 1
fingers 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
both 1
from 1
foxface 1
both 1
from 1
and 1
just 1
eight 1
of 1
us 1
the 1
betting 1
must 1
be 1
getting 1
really 1
hot 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
theyll 1
be 1
doing 1
special 1
features 1
on 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
now 1
probably 1
interviewing 1
our 1
friends 1
and 1
families 1
its 1
been 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
since 1
a 1
tribute 1
from 1
district 1
made 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
top 1
eight 1
and 1
now 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
although 1
from 1
what 1
cato 1
said 1
peetas 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
out 1
not 1
that 1
cato 1
is 1
the 1
final 1
word 1
on 1
anything 1
didnt 1
he 1
just 1
lose 1
his 1
entire 1
stash 1
of 1
supplies 1
let 1
the 1
seventyfourth 1
hunger 1
games 1
begin 1
cato 1
i 1
think 1
let 1
them 1
begin 1
for 1
real 1
a 1
cold 1
breeze 1
has 1
sprung 1
up 1
i 1
reach 1
for 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
before 1
i 1
remember 1
i 1
left 1
it 1
with 1
rue 1
i 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
another 1
one 1
but 1
what 1
with 1
the 1
mines 1
and 1
all 1
i 1
forgot 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
shiver 1
since 1
roosting 1
overnight 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
isnt 1
sensible 1
anyway 1
i 1
scoop 1
out 1
a 1
hollow 1
under 1
the 1
bushes 1
and 1
cover 1
myself 1
with 1
leaves 1
and 1
pine 1
needles 1
im 1
still 1
freezing 1
i 1
lay 1
my 1
sheet 1
of 1
plastic 1
over 1
my 1
upper 1
body 1
and 1
position 1
my 1
backpack 1
to 1
block 1
the 1
wind 1
its 1
a 1
little 1
better 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
sympathy 1
for 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
that 1
lit 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
first 1
night 1
but 1
now 1
its 1
me 1
who 1
needs 1
to 1
grit 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
tough 1
it 1
out 1
until 1
morning 1
more 1
leaves 1
more 1
pine 1
needles 1
i 1
pull 1
my 1
arms 1
inside 1
my 1
jacket 1
and 1
tuck 1
my 1
knees 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
chest 1
somehow 1
i 1
drift 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
when 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
world 1
looks 1
slightly 1
fractured 1
and 1
it 1
takes 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
realize 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
must 1
be 1
well 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
glasses 1
fragmenting 1
my 1
vision 1
as 1
i 1
sit 1
up 1
and 1
remove 1
them 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
laugh 1
somewhere 1
near 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
freeze 1
the 1
laughs 1
distorted 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
it 1
registered 1
at 1
all 1
means 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
regaining 1
my 1
hearing 1
yes 1
my 1
right 1
ear 1
can 1
hear 1
again 1
although 1
its 1
still 1
ringing 1
as 1
for 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
well 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
bleeding 1
has 1
stopped 1
i 1
peer 1
through 1
the 1
bushes 1
afraid 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
returned 1
trapping 1
me 1
here 1
for 1
an 1
indefinite 1
time 1
no 1
its 1
foxface 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
rubble 1
of 1
the 1
pyramid 1
and 1
laughing 1
shes 1
smarter 1
than 1
the 1
careers 1
actually 1
finding 1
a 1
few 1
useful 1
items 1
in 1
the 1
ashes 1
a 1
metal 1
pot 1
a 1
knife 1
blade 1
im 1
perplexed 1
by 1
her 1
amusement 1
until 1
i 1
realize 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
careers 1
stores 1
eliminated 1
she 1
might 1
actually 1
stand 1
a 1
chance 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
it 1
crosses 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
reveal 1
myself 1
and 1
enlist 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
second 1
ally 1
against 1
that 1
pack 1
but 1
i 1
rule 1
it 1
out 1
theres 1
something 1
about 1
that 1
sly 1
grin 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
sure 1
that 1
befriending 1
foxface 1
would 1
ultimately 1
get 1
me 1
a 1
knife 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
with 1
that 1
in 1
mind 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
an 1
excellent 1
time 1
to 1
shoot 1
her 1
but 1
shes 1
heard 1
something 1
not 1
me 1
because 1
her 1
head 1
turns 1
away 1
toward 1
the 1
dropoff 1
and 1
she 1
sprints 1
for 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
wait 1
no 1
one 1
nothing 1
shows 1
up 1
still 1
if 1
foxface 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
dangerous 1
maybe 1
its 1
time 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
too 1
besides 1
im 1
eager 1
to 1
tell 1
rue 1
about 1
the 1
pyramid 1
since 1
ive 1
no 1
idea 1
where 1
the 1
careers 1
are 1
the 1
route 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
seems 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
any 1
i 1
hurry 1
loaded 1
bow 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
a 1
hunk 1
of 1
cold 1
groosling 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
because 1
im 1
famished 1
now 1
and 1
not 1
just 1
for 1
leaves 1
and 1
berries 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
fat 1
and 1
protein 1
in 1
the 1
meat 1
the 1
trip 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
is 1
uneventful 1
once 1
there 1
i 1
refill 1
my 1
water 1
and 1
wash 1
taking 1
particular 1
care 1
with 1
my 1
injured 1
ear 1
then 1
i 1
travel 1
uphill 1
using 1
the 1
stream 1
as 1
a 1
guide 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
i 1
find 1
boot 1
prints 1
in 1
the 1
mud 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
the 1
careers 1
have 1
been 1
here 1
but 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
the 1
prints 1
are 1
deep 1
because 1
they 1
were 1
made 1
in 1
soft 1
mud 1
but 1
now 1
theyre 1
nearly 1
dry 1
in 1
the 1
hot 1
sun 1
i 1
havent 1
been 1
careful 1
enough 1
about 1
my 1
own 1
tracks 1
counting 1
on 1
a 1
light 1
tread 1
and 1
the 1
pine 1
needles 1
to 1
conceal 1
my 1
prints 1
now 1
i 1
strip 1
off 1
my 1
boots 1
and 1
socks 1
and 1
go 1
barefoot 1
up 1
the 1
bed 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
the 1
cool 1
water 1
has 1
an 1
invigorating 1
effect 1
on 1
my 1
body 1
my 1
spirits 1
i 1
shoot 1
two 1
fish 1
easy 1
pickings 1
in 1
this 1
slowmoving 1
stream 1
and 1
go 1
ahead 1
and 1
eat 1
one 1
raw 1
even 1
though 1
ive 1
just 1
had 1
the 1
groosling 1
the 1
second 1
ill 1
save 1
for 1
rue 1
gradually 1
subtly 1
the 1
ringing 1
in 1
my 1
right 1
ear 1
diminishes 1
until 1
its 1
gone 1
entirely 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
pawing 1
at 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
periodically 1
trying 1
to 1
clean 1
away 1
whatever 1
deadens 1
its 1
ability 1
to 1
collect 1
sounds 1
if 1
theres 1
improvement 1
its 1
undetectable 1
i 1
cant 1
adjust 1
to 1
deafness 1
in 1
the 1
ear 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
offbalanced 1
and 1
defenseless 1
to 1
my 1
left 1
blind 1
even 1
my 1
head 1
keeps 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
injured 1
side 1
as 1
my 1
right 1
ear 1
tries 1
to 1
compensate 1
for 1
the 1
wall 1
of 1
nothingness 1
where 1
yesterday 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
constant 1
flow 1
of 1
information 1
the 1
more 1
time 1
that 1
passes 1
the 1
less 1
hopeful 1
i 1
am 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
an 1
injury 1
that 1
will 1
heal 1
when 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
site 1
of 1
our 1
first 1
meeting 1
i 1
feel 1
certain 1
its 1
been 1
undisturbed 1
theres 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
rue 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
this 1
is 1
odd 1
by 1
now 1
she 1
should 1
have 1
returned 1
as 1
its 1
midday 1
undoubtedly 1
she 1
spent 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
somewhere 1
what 1
else 1
could 1
she 1
do 1
with 1
no 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
careers 1
with 1
their 1
nightvision 1
glasses 1
tramping 1
around 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
fire 1
she 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
set 1
although 1
i 1
forgot 1
to 1
check 1
for 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
was 1
the 1
farthest 1
from 1
our 1
site 1
of 1
all 1
shes 1
probably 1
just 1
being 1
cautious 1
about 1
making 1
her 1
way 1
back 1
i 1
wish 1
shed 1
hurry 1
because 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
hang 1
around 1
here 1
too 1
long 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
afternoon 1
traveling 1
to 1
higher 1
ground 1
hunting 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
but 1
theres 1
nothing 1
really 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
wait 1
i 1
wash 1
the 1
blood 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
jacket 1
and 1
hair 1
and 1
clean 1
my 1
evergrowing 1
list 1
of 1
wounds 1
the 1
burns 1
are 1
much 1
better 1
but 1
i 1
use 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
medicine 1
on 1
them 1
anyway 1
the 1
main 1
thing 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
now 1
is 1
keeping 1
out 1
infection 1
i 1
go 1
ahead 1
andeat 1
the 1
second 1
fish 1
it 1
isnt 1
going 1
to 1
last 1
long 1
in 1
this 1
hot 1
sun 1
but 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
easy 1
enough 1
to 1
spear 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
for 1
rue 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
just 1
show 1
up 1
feeling 1
too 1
vulnerable 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
my 1
lopsided 1
hearing 1
i 1
scale 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
wait 1
if 1
the 1
careers 1
show 1
up 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
place 1
to 1
shoot 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
sun 1
moves 1
slowly 1
i 1
do 1
things 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
time 1
chew 1
leaves 1
and 1
apply 1
them 1
to 1
my 1
stings 1
that 1
are 1
deflated 1
but 1
still 1
tender 1
comb 1
through 1
my 1
damp 1
hair 1
with 1
my 1
fingers 1
and 1
braid 1
it 1
lace 1
my 1
boots 1
back 1
up 1
check 1
over 1
my 1
bow 1
and 1
remaining 1
nine 1
arrows 1
test 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
repeatedly 1
for 1
signs 1
of 1
life 1
by 1
rustling 1
a 1
leaf 1
near 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
good 1
results 1
despite 1
the 1
groosling 1
and 1
the 1
fish 1
my 1
stomachs 1
growling 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
a 1
hollow 1
day 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
thats 1
a 1
day 1
where 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
you 1
put 1
in 1
your 1
belly 1
its 1
never 1
enough 1
having 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
sit 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
makes 1
it 1
worse 1
so 1
i 1
decide 1
to 1
give 1
into 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
ive 1
lost 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
weight 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
i 1
need 1
some 1
extra 1
calories 1
and 1
having 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
makes 1
me 1
far 1
more 1
confident 1
about 1
my 1
future 1
prospects 1
i 1
slowly 1
peel 1
and 1
eat 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
nuts 1
my 1
last 1
cracker 1
the 1
groosling 1
neck 1
thats 1
good 1
because 1
it 1
takes 1
time 1
to 1
pick 1
clean 1
finally 1
a 1
groosling 1
wing 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
is 1
history 1
but 1
its 1
a 1
hollow 1
day 1
and 1
even 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
start 1
daydreaming 1
about 1
food 1
particularly 1
the 1
decadent 1
dishes 1
served 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
the 1
chicken 1
in 1
creamy 1
orange 1
sauce 1
the 1
cakes 1
and 1
pudding 1
bread 1
with 1
butter 1
noodles 1
in 1
green 1
sauce 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
dried 1
plum 1
stew 1
i 1
suck 1
on 1
a 1
few 1
mint 1
leaves 1
and 1
tell 1
myself 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
it 1
mint 1
is 1
good 1
because 1
we 1
drink 1
mint 1
tea 1
after 1
supper 1
often 1
so 1
it 1
tricks 1
my 1
stomach 1
into 1
thinking 1
eating 1
time 1
is 1
over 1
sort 1
of 1
dangling 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
the 1
sun 1
warming 1
me 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
mint 1
my 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
at 1
hand 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
relaxed 1
ive 1
been 1
since 1
ive 1
entered 1
the 1
arena 1
if 1
only 1
rue 1
would 1
show 1
up 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
clear 1
out 1
as 1
the 1
shadows 1
grow 1
so 1
does 1
my 1
restlessness 1
by 1
late 1
afternoon 1
ive 1
resolved 1
to 1
go 1
looking 1
for 1
her 1
i 1
can 1
at 1
least 1
visit 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
she 1
set 1
the 1
third 1
fire 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
are 1
any 1
clues 1
to 1
her 1
whereabouts 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
i 1
scatter 1
a 1
few 1
mint 1
leaves 1
around 1
our 1
old 1
campfire 1
since 1
we 1
gathered 1
these 1
some 1
distance 1
away 1
rue 1
will 1
understand 1
ive 1
been 1
here 1
while 1
theyll 1
mean 1
nothing 1
to 1
the 1
careers 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
im 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
we 1
agreed 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
third 1
fire 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
something 1
has 1
gone 1
amiss 1
the 1
wood 1
has 1
been 1
neatly 1
arranged 1
expertly 1
interspersed 1
with 1
tinder 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
lit 1
rue 1
set 1
up 1
thefire 1
but 1
never 1
made 1
it 1
back 1
here 1
somewhere 1
between 1
the 1
second 1
column 1
of 1
smoke 1
i 1
spied 1
before 1
i 1
blew 1
up 1
the 1
supplies 1
and 1
this 1
point 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
trouble 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
remind 1
myself 1
shes 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
is 1
she 1
could 1
the 1
cannon 1
shot 1
announcing 1
her 1
death 1
have 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
wee 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
even 1
my 1
good 1
ear 1
was 1
too 1
broken 1
to 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
will 1
she 1
appear 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
tonight 1
no 1
i 1
refuse 1
to 1
believe 1
it 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
a 1
hundred 1
other 1
explanations 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
lost 1
her 1
way 1
run 1
into 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
predators 1
or 1
another 1
tribute 1
like 1
thresh 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
hide 1
whatever 1
happened 1
im 1
almost 1
certain 1
shes 1
stuck 1
out 1
there 1
somewhere 1
between 1
the 1
second 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
unlit 1
one 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
something 1
is 1
keeping 1
her 1
up 1
a 1
tree 1
i 1
think 1
ill 1
go 1
hunt 1
it 1
down 1
its 1
a 1
relief 1
to 1
be 1
doing 1
something 1
after 1
sitting 1
around 1
all 1
afternoon 1
i 1
creep 1
silently 1
through 1
the 1
shadows 1
letting 1
them 1
conceal 1
me 1
but 1
nothing 1
seems 1
suspicious 1
theres 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
struggle 1
no 1
disruption 1
of 1
the 1
needles 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
ive 1
stopped 1
for 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
cock 1
my 1
head 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
but 1
there 1
it 1
is 1
again 1
rues 1
fournote 1
tune 1
coming 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
mockingjays 1
mouth 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
means 1
shes 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
grin 1
and 1
move 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
bird 1
another 1
just 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
ahead 1
picks 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
notes 1
rue 1
has 1
been 1
singing 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
recently 1
otherwise 1
theyd 1
have 1
taken 1
up 1
some 1
other 1
song 1
my 1
eyes 1
lift 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
searching 1
for 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
her 1
i 1
swallow 1
and 1
sing 1
softly 1
back 1
hoping 1
shell 1
know 1
its 1
safe 1
to 1
join 1
me 1
a 1
mockingjay 1
repeats 1
the 1
melody 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
scream 1
its 1
a 1
childs 1
scream 1
a 1
young 1
girls 1
scream 1
theres 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
capable 1
of 1
making 1
that 1
sound 1
except 1
rue 1
and 1
now 1
im 1
running 1
knowing 1
this 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
trap 1
knowing 1
the 1
three 1
careers 1
may 1
be 1
poised 1
to 1
attack 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
myself 1
theres 1
another 1
highpitched 1
cry 1
this 1
time 1
my 1
name 1
katniss 1
katniss 1
rue 1
i 1
shout 1
back 1
so 1
she 1
knows 1
im 1
near 1
so 1
they 1
know 1
im 1
near 1
and 1
hopefully 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
has 1
attacked 1
them 1
with 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
and 1
gotten 1
an 1
eleven 1
they 1
still 1
cant 1
explain 1
will 1
be 1
enough 1
to 1
pull 1
their 1
attention 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
rue 1
im 1
coming 1
when 1
i 1
break 1
into 1
the 1
clearing 1
shes 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
hopelessly 1
entangled 1
in 1
a 1
net 1
she 1
just 1
has 1
time 1
to 1
reach 1
her 1
hand 1
through 1
the 1
mesh 1
and 1
say 1
my 1
name 1
before 1
the 1
spear 1
enters 1
her 1
body 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
dies 1
before 1
he 1
can 1
pull 1
out 1
the 1
spear 1
my 1
arrow 1
drives 1
deeply 1
into 1
the 1
center 1
of 1
his 1
neck 1
he 1
falls 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
halves 1
the 1
brief 1
remainder 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
by 1
yanking 1
out 1
the 1
arrow 1
and 1
drowning 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
blood 1
im 1
reloaded 1
shifting 1
my 1
aim 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
while 1
i 1
shout 1
at 1
rue 1
are 1
there 1
more 1
are 1
there 1
more 1
she 1
has 1
to 1
say 1
no 1
several 1
times 1
before 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
rue 1
has 1
rolled 1
to 1
her 1
side 1
her 1
body 1
curved 1
in 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
spear 1
i 1
shove 1
the 1
boy 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
pull 1
out 1
my 1
knife 1
freeing 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
net 1
one 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
wound 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
far 1
beyond 1
my 1
capacity 1
to 1
heal 1
beyond 1
anyones 1
probably 1
the 1
spearhead 1
is 1
buried 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
shaft 1
in 1
her 1
stomach 1
i 1
crouch 1
before 1
her 1
staring 1
helplessly 1
at 1
the 1
embedded 1
weapon 1
theres 1
no 1
point 1
in 1
comforting 1
words 1
in 1
telling 1
her 1
shell 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
shes 1
no 1
fool 1
her 1
hand 1
reaches 1
out 1
and 1
i 1
clutch 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
lifeline 1
as 1
if 1
its 1
me 1
whos 1
dying 1
instead 1
of 1
rue 1
you 1
blew 1
up 1
the 1
food 1
she 1
whispers 1
every 1
last 1
bit 1
i 1
say 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
win 1
she 1
says 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
going 1
to 1
win 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
now 1
i 1
promise 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
cannon 1
and 1
look 1
up 1

must 1
be 1
for 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
dont 1
go 1
rue 1
tightens 1
her 1
grip 1
on 1
my 1
hand 1
course 1
not 1
staying 1
right 1
here 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
move 1
in 1
closer 1
to 1
her 1
pulling 1
her 1
head 1
onto 1
my 1
lap 1
i 1
gently 1
brush 1
the 1
dark 1
thick 1
hair 1
back 1
behind 1
her 1
ear 1
sing 1
she 1
says 1
but 1
i 1
barely 1
catch 1
the 1
word 1
sing 1
i 1
think 1
sing 1
what 1
i 1
do 1
know 1
a 1
few 1
songs 1
believe 1
it 1
or 1
not 1

was 1
once 1
music 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
too 1
music 1
i 1
helped 1
make 1
my 1
father 1
pulled 1
me 1
in 1
with 1
that 1
remarkable 1
voice 1
but 1
i 1
havent 1
sung 1
much 1
since 1
he 1
died 1
except 1
when 1
prim 1
is 1
very 1
sick 1
then 1
i 1
sing 1
her 1
the 1
same 1
songs 1
she 1
liked 1
as 1
a 1
baby 1
sing 1
my 1
throat 1
is 1
tight 1
with 1
tears 1
hoarse 1
from 1
smoke 1
and 1
fatigue 1
but 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
prims 1
i 1
mean 1
rues 1
last 1
request 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
at 1
least 1
try 1
the 1
song 1
that 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
a 1
simple 1
lullaby 1
one 1
we 1
sing 1
fretful 1
hungry 1
babies 1
to 1
sleep 1
with 1
its 1
old 1
very 1
old 1
i 1
think 1
made 1
up 1
long 1
ago 1
in 1
our 1
hills 1
what 1
my 1
music 1
teacher 1
calls 1
a 1
mountain 1
air 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
are 1
easy 1

give 1
a 1
small 1
cough 1

in 1
the 1

fluttered 1
shut 1

chest 1

only 1
slightly 1
my 1
throat 1
releases 1
the 1
tears 1
and 1
they 1
slide 1
down 1
my 1
cheeks 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
finish 1
the 1
song 1

deep 1
in 1

i 1
love 1
you 1
everythings 1
still 1
and 1
quiet 1
then 1
almost 1
eerily 1
the 1
mockingjays 1
take 1
up 1
my 1
song 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
sit 1
there 1
watching 1
my 1
tears 1
drip 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
face 1
rues 1
cannon 1
fires 1
i 1
lean 1
forward 1
and 1
press 1
my 1
lips 1
against 1
her 1
temple 1
slowly 1
as 1
if 1
not 1
to 1
wake 1
her 1
i 1
lay 1
her 1
head 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
release 1
her 1
hand 1
theyll 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
clear 1
out 1
now 1
so 1
they 1
can 1
collect 1
the 1
bodies 1
and 1
theres 1
nothing 1
to 1
stay 1
for 1
i 1
roll 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
onto 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
take 1
his 1
pack 1
retrieve 1
the 1
arrow 1
that 1
ended 1
his 1
life 1
i 1
cut 1
rues 1
pack 1
from 1
her 1
back 1
as 1
well 1
knowing 1
shed 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
but 1
leave 1
the 1
spear 1
in 1
her 1
stomach 1
weapons 1
in 1
bodies 1
will 1
be 1
transported 1
to 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
ive 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
a 1
spear 1
so 1
the 1
sooner 1
its 1
gone 1
from 1
the 1
arena 1
the 1
better 1
i 1
cant 1
stop 1
looking 1
at 1
rue 1
smaller 1
than 1
ever 1
a 1
baby 1
animal 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
nest 1
of 1
netting 1
i 1
cant 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
like 1
this 1
past 1
harm 1
but 1
seeming 1
utterly 1
defenseless 1
to 1
hate 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
who 1
also 1
appears 1
so 1
vulnerable 1
in 1
death 1
seems 1
inadequate 1
its 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
hate 1
for 1
doing 1
this 1
to 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
gales 1
voice 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
his 1
ravings 1
against 1
the 1
capitol 1
no 1
longer 1
pointless 1
no 1
longer 1
to 1
be 1
ignored 1
rues 1
death 1
has 1
forced 1
me 1
to 1
confront 1
my 1
own 1
fury 1
against 1
the 1
cruelty 1
the 1
injustice 1
they 1
inflict 1
upon 1
us 1
but 1
here 1
even 1
more 1
strongly 1
than 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
feel 1
my 1
impotence 1
theres 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
take 1
revenge 1
on 1
the 1
capitol 1
is 1
there 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
peetas 1
words 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
only 1
i 1
keep 1
wishing 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
capital 1
they 1
dont 1
own 1
me 1
that 1
im 1
more 1
than 1
just 1
a 1
piece 1
in 1
their 1
games 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
understand 1
what 1
he 1
means 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
right 1
here 1
right 1
now 1
to 1
shame 1
them 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
accountable 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
capitol 1
that 1
whatever 1
they 1
do 1
or 1
force 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
every 1
tribute 1
they 1
cant 1
own 1
that 1
rue 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
piece 1
in 1
their 1
games 1
and 1
so 1
am 1
i 1
a 1
few 1
steps 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
grows 1
a 1
bank 1
of 1
wildflowers 1
perhaps 1
they 1
are 1
really 1
weeds 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
blossoms 1
in 1
beautiful 1
shades 1
of 1
violet 1
and 1
yellow 1
and 1
white 1
i 1
gather 1
up 1
an 1
armful 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
rues 1
side 1
slowly 1
one 1
stem 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
decorate 1
her 1
body 1
in 1
the 1
flowers 1
covering 1
the 1
ugly 1
wound 1
wreathing 1
her 1
face 1
weaving 1
her 1
hair 1
with 1
bright 1
colors 1
theyll 1
have 1
to 1
show 1
it 1
or 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
choose 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
cameras 1
elsewhere 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
theyll 1
have 1
to 1
bring 1
them 1
back 1
when 1
they 1
collect 1
the 1
bodies 1
and 1
everyone 1
will 1
see 1
her 1
then 1
and 1
know 1
i 1
did 1
it 1
i 1
step 1
back 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
last 1
look 1
at 1
rue 1
she 1
could 1
really 1
be 1
asleep 1
in 1
that 1
meadow 1
after 1
all 1
bye 1
rue 1
i 1
whisper 1
i 1
press 1
the 1
three 1
middle 1
fingers 1
of 1
my 1
left 1
hand 1
against 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
hold 1
them 1
out 1
in 1
her 1
direction 1
then 1
i 1
walk 1
away 1
without 1
looking 1
back 1
the 1
birds 1
fall 1
silent 1
somewhere 1
a 1
mockingjay 1
gives 1
the 1
warning 1
whistle 1
that 1
precedes 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
it 1
knows 1
it 1
must 1
hear 1
things 1
that 1
humans 1
cant 1
i 1
pause 1
my 1
eyes 1
focused 1
on 1
whats 1
ahead 1
not 1
whats 1
happening 1
behind 1
me 1
it 1
doesnt 1
take 1
long 1
then 1
the 1
general 1
birdsong 1
begins 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
shes 1
gone 1
another 1
mockingjay 1
a 1
young 1
one 1
by 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
lands 1
on 1
a 1
branch 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
bursts 1
out 1
rues 1
melody 1
my 1
song 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
were 1
too 1
unfamiliar 1
for 1
this 1
novice 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
mastered 1
her 1
handful 1
of 1
notes 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
mean 1
shes 1
safe 1
good 1
and 1
safe 1
i 1
say 1
as 1
i 1
pass 1
under 1
its 1
branch 1
we 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
her 1
now 1
good 1
and 1
safe 1
ive 1
no 1
idea 1
where 1
to 1
go 1
the 1
brief 1
sense 1
of 1
home 1
i 1
had 1
that 1
one 1
night 1
with 1
rue 1
has 1
vanished 1
my 1
feet 1
wander 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
until 1
sunset 1
im 1
not 1
afraid 1
not 1
even 1
watchful 1
which 1
makes 1
me 1
an 1
easy 1
target 1
except 1
id 1
kill 1
anyone 1
i 1
met 1
on 1
sight 1
without 1
emotion 1
or 1
the 1
slightest 1
tremor 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
my 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
capitol 1
has 1
not 1
lessened 1
my 1
hatred 1
of 1
my 1
competitors 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
especially 1
the 1
careers 1
they 1
at 1
least 1
can 1
be 1
made 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
rues 1
death 1
no 1
one 1
materializes 1
though 1
there 1
arent 1
many 1
of 1
us 1
left 1
and 1
its 1
a 1
big 1
arena 1
soon 1
theyll 1
be 1
pulling 1
out 1
some 1
other 1
device 1
to 1
force 1
us 1
together 1
but 1
theres 1
been 1
enough 1
gore 1
today 1
perhaps 1
well 1
even 1
get 1
to 1
sleep 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
haul 1
my 1
packs 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
make 1
camp 1
when 1
a 1
silver 1
parachute 1
floats 1
down 1
and 1
lands 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
a 1
gift 1
from 1
a 1
sponsor 1
but 1
why 1
now 1
ive 1
been 1
in 1
fairly 1
good 1
shape 1
with 1
supplies 1
maybe 1
haymitchs 1
noticed 1
my 1
despondency 1
and 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
cheer 1
me 1
up 1
a 1
bit 1
or 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
something 1
to 1
help 1
my 1
ear 1
i 1
open 1
the 1
parachute 1
and 1
find 1
a 1
small 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
its 1
not 1
the 1
fine 1
white 1
capitol 1
stuff 1
its 1
made 1
of 1
dark 1
ration 1
grain 1
and 1
shaped 1
in 1
a 1
crescent 1
sprinkled 1
with 1
seeds 1
i 1
flash 1
back 1
to 1
peetas 1
lesson 1
on 1
the 1
various 1
district 1
breads 1
in 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
this 1
bread 1
came 1
from 1
district 1
i 1
cautiously 1
lift 1
the 1
still 1
warm 1
loaf 1
what 1
must 1
it 1
have 1
cost 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
district 1
who 1
cant 1
even 1
feed 1
themselves 1
how 1
many 1
wouldve 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
without 1
to 1
scrape 1
up 1
a 1
coin 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
collection 1
for 1
this 1
one 1
loaf 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
meant 1
for 1
rue 1
surely 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
pulling 1
the 1
gift 1
when 1
she 1
died 1
theyd 1
authorized 1
haymitch 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
thankyou 1
or 1
because 1

they 1
dont 1
like 1
to 1
let 1
debts 1
go 1
unpaid 1

rays 1
of 1
sunlight 1

full 1
value 1
of 1
their 1
gift 1
has 1
been 1
recognized 1
i 1
climb 1
dangerously 1
high 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
not 1
for 1
safety 1
but 1
to 1
get 1
as 1
far 1
away 1
from 1

tiny 1
bites 1
of 1
the 1
bread 1

tastes 1
of 1
home 1

the 1
seals 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
the 1
anthem 1

in 1

asleep 1
at 1
once 1
sometimes 1
when 1
things 1
are 1
particularly 1
bad 1
my 1
brain 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
happy 1
dream 1
a 1
visit 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
in 1

it 1
sends 1
me 1
rue 1
still 1
decked 1
in 1
her 1
flowers 1
perched 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
sea 1
of 1
trees 1
trying 1
to 1
teach 1
me 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
the 1
mockingjays 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
her 1
wounds 1
no 1
blood 1
just 1
a 1
bright 1
laughing 1
girl 1
she 1
sings 1
songs 1
ive 1
never 1
heard 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
melodic 1
voice 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
theres 1
a 1
drowsy 1
inbetween 1
period 1
when 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
strains 1
of 1
her 1
music 1
although 1
shes 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
leaves 1
when 1
i 1
fully 1
awaken 1
im 1
momentarily 1
comforted 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
peaceful 1
feeling 1
of 1
the 1
dream 1
but 1
it 1
quickly 1
slips 1
away 1
leaving 1
me 1
sadder 1
and 1
lonelier 1
than 1
ever 1
heaviness 1
infuses 1
my 1
whole 1
body 1
as 1
if 1
theres 1
liquid 1
lead 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
ive 1
lost 1
the 1
will 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
simplest 1
tasks 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
but 1
lie 1
here 1
staring 1
unblinkingly 1
through 1
the 1
canopy 1
of 1
leaves 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
i 1
remain 1
motionless 1
as 1
usual 1
its 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
prims 1
anxious 1
face 1
as 1
she 1
watches 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
screens 1
back 1
home 1
that 1
breaks 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
lethargy 1
i 1
give 1
myself 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
simple 1
commands 1
to 1
follow 1
like 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
katniss 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
drink 1
water 1
katniss 1
i 1
act 1
on 1
the 1
orders 1
with 1
slow 1
robotic 1
motions 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
sort 1
the 1
packs 1
katniss 1
rues 1
pack 1
holds 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
her 1
nearly 1
empty 1
water 1
skin 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
rabbit 1
her 1
extra 1
socks 1
and 1
her 1
slingshot 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
has 1
several 1
knives 1
two 1
spare 1
spearheads 1
a 1
flashlight 1
a 1
small 1
leather 1
pouch 1
a 1
firstaid 1
kit 1
a 1
full 1
bottle 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
dried 1
fruit 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
dried 1
fruit 1
out 1
of 1
all 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
chosen 1
from 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
extreme 1
arrogance 1
why 1
bother 1
to 1
carry 1
food 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
bounty 1
back 1
at 1
camp 1
when 1
you 1
will 1
kill 1
your 1
enemies 1
so 1
quickly 1
youll 1
be 1
home 1
before 1
youre 1
hungry 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
hope 1
the 1
other 1
careers 1
traveled 1
so 1
lightly 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
food 1
and 1
now 1
find 1
themselves 1
with 1
nothing 1
speaking 1
of 1
which 1
my 1
own 1
supply 1
is 1
running 1
low 1
i 1
finish 1
off 1
the 1
loaf 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
rabbit 1
how 1
quickly 1
the 1
food 1
disappears 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
left 1
are 1
rues 1
roots 1
and 1
nuts 1
the 1
boys 1
dried 1
fruit 1
and 1
one 1
strip 1
of 1
beef 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
hunt 1
katniss 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
i 1
obediently 1
consolidate 1
the 1
supplies 1
i 1
want 1
into 1
my 1
pack 1
after 1
i 1
climb 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
i 1
conceal 1
the 1
boys 1
knives 1
and 1
spearheads 1
in 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
rocks 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
can 1
use 1
them 1
ive 1
lost 1
my 1
bearings 1
what 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
wandering 1
around 1
i 1
did 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
but 1
i 1
try 1
and 1
head 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
know 1
im 1
on 1
course 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
across 1
rues 1
third 1
unlit 1
fire 1
shortly 1
thereafter 1
i 1
discover 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
grooslings 1
perched 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
take 1
out 1
three 1
before 1
they 1
know 1
what 1
hit 1
them 1
i 1
return 1
to 1
rues 1
signal 1
fire 1
and 1
start 1
it 1
up 1
not 1
caring 1
about 1
the 1
excessive 1
smoke 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
cato 1
i 1
think 1
as 1
i 1
roast 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
rues 1
roots 1
im 1
waiting 1
right 1
here 1
who 1
knows 1
where 1
the 1
careers 1
are 1
now 1
either 1
too 1
far 1
to 1
reach 1
me 1
or 1
too 1
sure 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
trick 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
too 1
scared 1
of 1
me 1
they 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
of 1
course 1
cato 1
saw 1
me 1
take 1
them 1
from 1
glimmers 1
body 1
but 1
have 1
they 1
put 1
two 1
and 1
two 1
together 1
yet 1
figured 1
out 1
i 1
blew 1
up 1
the 1
supplies 1
and 1
killed 1
their 1
fellow 1
career 1
possibly 1
they 1
think 1
thresh 1
did 1
this 1
wouldnt 1
he 1
be 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
revenge 1
rues 1
death 1
than 1
i 1
would 1
being 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
district 1
not 1
that 1
he 1
ever 1
took 1
any 1
interest 1
in 1
her 1
and 1
what 1
about 1
foxface 1
did 1
she 1
hang 1
around 1
to 1
watch 1
me 1
blow 1
up 1
the 1
supplies 1
no 1
when 1
i 1
caught 1
her 1
laughing 1
in 1
the 1
ashes 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
if 1
someone 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
a 1
lovely 1
surprise 1
i 1
doubt 1
they 1
think 1
peeta 1
has 1
lit 1
this 1
signal 1
fire 1
catos 1
sure 1
hes 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
dead 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
wishing 1
i 1
could 1
tell 1
peeta 1
about 1
the 1
flowers 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
rue 1
that 1
i 1
now 1
understand 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
say 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
perhaps 1
if 1
he 1
wins 1
the 1
games 1
hell 1
see 1
me 1
on 1
victors 1
night 1
when 1
they 1
replay 1
the 1
highlights 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
on 1
a 1
screen 1
over 1
the 1
stage 1
where 1
we 1
did 1
our 1
interviews 1
the 1
winner 1
sits 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
honor 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
surrounded 1
by 1
their 1
support 1
crew 1
but 1
i 1
told 1
rue 1
id 1
be 1
there 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
somehow 1
that 1
seems 1
even 1
more 1
important 1
than 1
the 1
vow 1
i 1
gave 1
prim 1
i 1
really 1
think 1
i 1
stand 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
doing 1
it 1
now 1
winning 1
its 1
not 1
just 1
having 1
the 1
arrows 1
or 1
outsmarting 1
the 1
careers 1
a 1
few 1
times 1
although 1
those 1
things 1
help 1
something 1
happened 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
holding 1
rues 1
hand 1
watching 1
the 1
life 1
drain 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
determined 1
to 1
revenge 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
loss 1
unforgettable 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
do 1
that 1
by 1
winning 1
and 1
thereby 1
making 1
myself 1
unforgettable 1
i 1
overcook 1
the 1
birds 1
hoping 1
someone 1
will 1
show 1
up 1
to 1
shoot 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
does 1
maybe 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
are 1
out 1
there 1
beating 1
one 1
another 1
senseless 1
which 1
would 1
be 1
fine 1
ever 1
since 1
the 1
bloodbath 1
ive 1
been 1
featured 1
on 1
screens 1
most 1
than 1
i 1
care 1
eventually 1
i 1
wrap 1
up 1
my 1
food 1
and 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
to 1
replenish 1
my 1
water 1
and 1
gather 1
some 1
but 1
the 1
heaviness 1
from 1
the 1
morning 1
drapes 1
back 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
only 1
early 1
evening 1
i 1
climb 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
settle 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
my 1
brain 1
begins 1
to 1
replay 1
the 1
events 1
from 1
yesterday 1
i 1
keep 1
seeing 1
rue 1
speared 1
my 1
arrow 1
piercing 1
the 1
boys 1
neck 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
even 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
boy 1
then 1
i 1
realize 1
he 1
was 1
my 1
first 1
kill 1
along 1
with 1
other 1
statistics 1
they 1
report 1
to 1
help 1
people 1
place 1
their 1
bets 1
every 1
tribute 1
has 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
kills 1
i 1
guess 1
technically 1
id 1
get 1
credited 1
for 1
glimmer 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
too 1
for 1
dumping 1
that 1
nest 1
on 1
them 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
person 1
i 1
knew 1
would 1
die 1
because 1
of 1
my 1
actionsnumerous 1
animals 1
have 1
lost 1
their 1
lives 1
at 1
my 1
hands 1
but 1
only 1
one 1
human 1
i 1
hear 1
gale 1
saying 1
how 1
different 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
really 1
amazingly 1
similar 1
in 1
the 1
execution 1
a 1
bow 1
pulled 1
an 1
arrow 1
shot 1
entirely 1
different 1
in 1
the 1
aftermath 1
i 1
killed 1
a 1
boy 1
whose 1
name 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
know 1
somewhere 1
his 1
family 1
is 1
weeping 1
for 1
him 1
his 1
friends 1
call 1
for 1
my 1
blood 1
maybe 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
girlfriend 1
who 1
really 1
believed 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
rues 1
still 1
body 1
and 1
im 1
able 1
to 1
banish 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
at 1
least 1
for 1
now 1
its 1
been 1
an 1
uneventful 1
day 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
sky 1
no 1
deaths 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
long 1
well 1
get 1
until 1
the 1
next 1
catastrophe 1
drives 1
us 1
back 1
together 1
if 1
its 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
tonight 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
sleep 1
first 1
i 1
cover 1
my 1
good 1
ear 1
to 1
block 1
out 1
the 1
strains 1
of 1
the 1
anthem 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
trumpets 1
and 1
sit 1
straight 1
up 1
in 1
anticipation 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
the 1
only 1
communication 1
the 1
tributes 1
get 1
from 1
outside 1
the 1
arena 1
is 1
the 1
nightly 1
death 1
toll 1
but 1
occasionally 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
trumpets 1
followed 1
by 1
an 1
announcement 1
usually 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
call 1
to 1
a 1
feast 1
when 1
food 1
is 1
scarce 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
will 1
invite 1
the 1
players 1
to 1
a 1
banquet 1
somewhere 1
known 1
to 1
all 1
like 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
as 1
an 1
inducement 1
to 1
gather 1
and 1
fight 1
sometimes 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
feast 1
and 1
sometimes 1
theres 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
stale 1
bread 1
for 1
the 1
tributes 1
to 1
compete 1
for 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
food 1
but 1
this 1
could 1
be 1
an 1
ideal 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
out 1
a 1
few 1
competitors 1
claudius 1
templesmiths 1
voice 1
booms 1
down 1
from 1
overhead 1
congratulating 1
the 1
six 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
remain 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
inviting 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
feast 1
hes 1
saying 1
something 1
very 1
confusing 1
theres 1
been 1
a 1
rule 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
a 1
rule 1
change 1
that 1
in 1
itself 1
is 1
mind 1
bending 1
since 1
we 1
dont 1
really 1
have 1
any 1
rules 1
to 1

change 1
again 1
the 1
news 1
sinks 1
in 1
two 1
tributes 1
can 1
win 1
this 1
year 1
if 1
theyre 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
district 1
both 1

can 1
stop 1
myself 1
i 1
call 1
out 1
peetas 1

part 1
iiithe 1
victor 1
i 1
clap 1
my 1
hands 1
over 1
my 1
mouth 1
but 1
the 1
sound 1
has 1
already 1
escaped 1
the 1
sky 1
goes 1
black 1
and 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
chorus 1
of 1
frogs 1
begin 1
to 1
sing 1
stupid 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
what 1
a 1
stupid 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
wait 1
frozen 1
for 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
come 1
alive 1
with 1
assailants 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
theres 1
almost 1
no 1
one 1
left 1
peeta 1
whos 1
been 1
wounded 1
is 1
now 1
my 1
ally 1
whatever 1
doubts 1
ive 1
had 1
about 1
him 1
dissipate 1
because 1
if 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
took 1
the 1
others 1
life 1
now 1
wed 1
be 1
pariahs 1
when 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
district 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
know 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
watching 1
id 1
loathe 1
any 1
tribute 1
who 1
didnt 1
immediately 1
ally 1
with 1
their 1
district 1
partner 1
besides 1
it 1
just 1
makes 1
sense 1
to 1
protect 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
case 1
being 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
starcrossed 1
lovers 1
from 1
district 1
its 1
an 1
absolute 1
requirement 1
if 1
i 1
want 1
any 1
more 1
help 1
from 1
sympathetic 1
sponsors 1
the 1
starcrossed 1
lovers 1
peeta 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
playing 1
that 1
angle 1
all 1
along 1
why 1
else 1
would 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
have 1
made 1
this 1
unprecedented 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
rules 1
for 1
two 1
tributes 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
shot 1
at 1
winning 1
our 1
romance 1
must 1
be 1
so 1
popular 1
with 1
the 1
audience 1
that 1
condemning 1
it 1
would 1
jeopardize 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
no 1
thanks 1
to 1
me 1
all 1
ive 1
done 1
is 1
managed 1
not 1
to 1
kill 1
peeta 1
but 1
whatever 1
hes 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
the 1
audience 1
convinced 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
alive 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
from 1
running 1
to 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
fighting 1
cato 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
escape 1
even 1
hooking 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
careers 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
move 1
to 1
protect 1
me 1
peeta 1
it 1
turns 1
out 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
a 1
danger 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
thought 1
makes 1
me 1
smile 1
i 1
drop 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
hold 1
my 1
face 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
moonlight 1
so 1
the 1
cameras 1
can 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
catch 1
it 1
so 1
who 1
is 1
there 1
left 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
foxface 1
the 1
boy 1
tribute 1
from 1
her 1
district 1
is 1
dead 1
shes 1
operating 1
alone 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
her 1
strategy 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
evade 1
not 1
attack 1
i 1
dont 1
really 1
think 1
that 1
even 1
if 1
she 1
heard 1
my 1
voice 1
shed 1
do 1
anything 1
but 1
hope 1
someone 1
else 1
would 1
kill 1
me 1
then 1
theres 1
thresh 1
all 1
right 1
hes 1
a 1
distinct 1
threat 1
but 1
i 1
havent 1
seen 1
him 1
not 1
once 1
since 1
the 1
games 1
began 1
i 1
think 1
about 1
how 1
foxface 1
grew 1
alarmed 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
at 1
the 1
site 1
of 1
the 1
explosion 1
but 1
she 1
didnt 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
she 1
turned 1
to 1
whatever 1
lies 1
across 1
from 1
it 1
to 1
that 1
area 1
of 1
the 1
arena 1
that 1
drops 1
off 1
into 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
feel 1
almost 1
certain 1
that 1
the 1
person 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
was 1
thresh 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
domain 1
hed 1
never 1
have 1
heard 1
me 1
from 1
there 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
im 1
up 1
too 1
high 1
for 1
someone 1
his 1
size 1
to 1
reach 1
so 1
that 1
leaves 1
cato 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
who 1
are 1
now 1
surely 1
celebrating 1
the 1
new 1
rule 1
theyre 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1
left 1
who 1
benefit 1
from 1
it 1
besides 1
peeta 1
and 1
myself 1
do 1
i 1
run 1
from 1
them 1
now 1
on 1
the 1
chance 1
they 1
heard 1
me 1
call 1
peetas 1
name 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
let 1
them 1
come 1
let 1
them 1
come 1
with 1
their 1
nightvision 1
glasses 1
and 1
their 1
heavy 1
branchbreaking 1
bodies 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
my 1
arrows 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
they 1
wont 1
if 1
they 1
didnt 1
come 1
in 1
daylight 1
to 1
my 1
fire 1
they 1
wont 1
risk 1
what 1
could 1
be 1
another 1
trap 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
on 1
their 1
own 1
terms 1
not 1
because 1
ive 1
let 1
them 1
know 1
my 1
whereabouts 1
stay 1
put 1
and 1
get 1
some 1
sleep 1
katniss 1
i 1
instruct 1
myself 1
although 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
start 1
tracking 1
peeta 1
now 1
tomorrow 1
youll 1
find 1
him 1
i 1
do 1
sleep 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
im 1
extracautious 1
thinking 1
that 1
while 1
the 1
careers 1
might 1
hesitate 1
to 1
attack 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
theyre 1
completely 1
capable 1
of 1
setting 1
an 1
ambush 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
make 1
sure 1
to 1
fully 1
prepare 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
eating 1
a 1
big 1
breakfast 1
securing 1
my 1
pack 1
readying 1
my 1
weapons 1
before 1
i 1
descend 1
but 1
all 1
seems 1
peaceful 1
and 1
undisturbed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
today 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
scrupulously 1
careful 1
the 1
careers 1
will 1
know 1
im 1
trying 1
to 1
locate 1
peeta 1
they 1
may 1
well 1
want 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
i 1
do 1
before 1
they 1
move 1
in 1
if 1
hes 1
as 1
badly 1
wounded 1
as 1
cato 1
thinks 1
id 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
having 1
to 1
defend 1
us 1
both 1
without 1
any 1
assistance 1
but 1
if 1
hes 1
that 1
incapacitated 1
how 1
has 1
he 1
managed 1
to 1
stay 1
alive 1
and 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
i 1
find 1
him 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
peeta 1
ever 1
said 1
that 1
might 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
indication 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
hes 1
hiding 1
out 1
but 1
nothing 1
rings 1
a 1
bell 1
so 1
i 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
sparkling 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
yelling 1
at 1
me 1
to 1
run 1
then 1
cato 1
appeared 1
his 1
sword 1
drawn 1
and 1
after 1
i 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
wounded 1
peeta 1
but 1
how 1
did 1
peeta 1
get 1
away 1
maybe 1
hed 1
held 1
out 1
better 1
against 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
poison 1
than 1
cato 1
maybe 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
variable 1
that 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
escape 1
but 1
hed 1
been 1
stung 1
too 1
so 1
how 1
far 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
gotten 1
stabbed 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
venom 1
and 1
how 1
has 1
he 1
stayed 1
alive 1
all 1
these 1
days 1
since 1
if 1
the 1
wound 1
and 1
the 1
stingers 1
havent 1
killed 1
him 1
surely 1
thirst 1
would 1
have 1
taken 1
him 1
by 1
now 1
and 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
get 1
my 1
first 1
clue 1
to 1
his 1
whereabouts 1
he 1
couldnt 1
have 1
survived 1
without 1
water 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
from 1
my 1
first 1
few 1
days 1
here 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
hidden 1
somewhere 1
near 1
a 1
source 1
theres 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
an 1
unlikely 1
option 1
since 1
its 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
careers 1
base 1
camp 1
a 1
few 1
springfed 1
pools 1
but 1
youd 1
really 1
be 1
a 1
sitting 1
duck 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
and 1
the 1
stream 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
leads 1
from 1
the 1
camp 1
rue 1
and 1
i 1
made 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
near 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
beyond 1
if 1
he 1
stuck 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
he 1
could 1
change 1
his 1
location 1
and 1
always 1
be 1
near 1
water 1
he 1
could 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
erase 1
any 1
tracks 1
he 1
might 1
even 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
fish 1
or 1
two 1
well 1
its 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
start 1
anyway 1
to 1
confuse 1
my 1
enemies 1
minds 1
i 1
start 1
a 1
fire 1
with 1
plenty 1
of 1
green 1
wood 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
think 1
its 1
a 1
ruse 1
i 1
hope 1
theyll 1
decide 1
im 1
hidden 1
somewhere 1
near 1
it 1
while 1
in 1
reality 1
ill 1
be 1
tracking 1
peeta 1
the 1
sun 1
burns 1
off 1
the 1
morning 1
haze 1
almost 1
immediately 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
day 1
will 1
be 1
hotter 1
than 1
usual 1
the 1
waters 1
cool 1
and 1
pleasant 1
on 1
my 1
bare 1
feet 1
as 1
i 1
head 1
downstream 1
im 1
tempted 1
to 1
call 1
out 1
peetas 1
name 1
as 1
i 1
go 1
but 1
decide 1
against 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
one 1
good 1
ear 1
or 1
he 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
find 1
me 1
but 1
hell 1
know 1
ill 1
be 1
looking 1
right 1
he 1
wont 1
have 1
so 1
low 1
of 1
an 1
opinion 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
think 1
id 1
ignore 1
the 1
new 1
rule 1
and 1
keep 1
to 1
myself 1
would 1
he 1
hes 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
predict 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
interesting 1
under 1
different 1
circumstances 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
only 1
provides 1
an 1
extra 1
obstacle 1
it 1
doesnt 1
take 1
long 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
i 1
peeled 1
off 1
to 1
go 1
the 1
careers 1
camp 1
theres 1
been 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
peeta 1
but 1
this 1
doesnt 1
surprise 1
me 1
ive 1
been 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
this 1
stretch 1
three 1
times 1
since 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
incident 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
nearby 1
surely 1
id 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
suspicion 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
stream 1
begins 1
to 1
curve 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
into 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
thats 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
muddy 1
banks 1
covered 1
in 1
tangled 1
water 1
plants 1
lead 1
to 1
large 1
rocks 1
that 1
increase 1
in 1
size 1
until 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
feel 1
somewhat 1
trapped 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
small 1
matter 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
stream 1
now 1
fighting 1
off 1
cato 1
or 1
thresh 1
as 1
i 1
climbed 1
over 1
this 1
rocky 1
terrain 1
in 1
fact 1
ive 1
just 1
about 1
decided 1
im 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
track 1
entirely 1
that 1
a 1
wounded 1
boy 1
would 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
navigate 1
getting 1
to 1
and 1
from 1
this 1
water 1
source 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
bloody 1
streak 1
going 1
down 1
the 1
curve 1
of 1
a 1
boulder 1
its 1
long 1
dried 1
now 1
but 1
the 1
smeary 1
lines 1
running 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
suggest 1
someone 1
who 1
perhaps 1
was 1
not 1
fully 1
in 1
control 1
of 1
his 1
mental 1
faculties 1
tried 1
to 1
wipe 1
it 1
away 1
hugging 1
the 1
rocks 1
i 1
move 1
slowly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
blood 1
searching 1
for 1
him 1
i 1
find 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
bloodstains 1
one 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
threads 1
of 1
fabric 1
glued 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
break 1
down 1
and 1
say 1
his 1
name 1
in 1
a 1
hushed 1
voice 1
peeta 1
peeta 1
then 1
a 1
mockingjay 1
lands 1
on 1
a 1
scruffy 1
tree 1
and 1
begins 1
to 1
mimic 1
my 1
tones 1
so 1
i 1
stop 1
i 1
give 1
up 1
and 1
climb 1
back 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
thinking 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
moved 1
on 1
somewhere 1
farther 1
down 1
my 1
foot 1
has 1
just 1
broken 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
voice 1
you 1
here 1
to 1
finish 1
me 1
off 1
sweetheart 1
i 1
whip 1
around 1
its 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
left 1
so 1
i 1
cant 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
was 1
hoarse 1
and 1
weak 1
still 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
peeta 1
who 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
would 1
call 1
me 1
sweetheart 1
my 1
eyes 1
peruse 1
the 1
bank 1
but 1
theres 1
nothing 1
just 1
mud 1
the 1
plants 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
peeta 1
i 1
whisper 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
theres 1
no 1
answer 1
could 1
i 1
just 1
have 1
imagined 1
it 1
no 1
im 1
certain 1
it 1
was 1
real 1
and 1
very 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
too 1
peeta 1
i 1
creep 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
well 1
dont 1
step 1
on 1
me 1
i 1
jump 1
back 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
right 1
under 1
my 1
feet 1
still 1
theres 1
nothing 1
then 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
unmistakably 1
blue 1
in 1
the 1
brown 1
mud 1
and 1
green 1
leaves 1
i 1
gasp 1
and 1
am 1
rewarded 1
with 1
a 1
hint 1
of 1
white 1
teeth 1
as 1
he 1
laughs 1
its 1
the 1
final 1
word 1
in 1
camouflage 1
forget 1
chucking 1
weights 1
around 1
peeta 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
into 1
his 1
private 1
session 1
with 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
and 1
painted 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
or 1
a 1
boulder 1
or 1
a 1
muddy 1
bank 1
full 1
of 1
weeds 1
close 1
your 1
eyes 1
again 1
i 1
order 1
he 1
does 1
and 1
his 1
mouth 1
too 1
and 1
completely 1
disappears 1
most 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
judge 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
body 1
is 1
actually 1
under 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
mud 1
and 1
plants 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
arms 1
are 1
so 1
artfully 1
disguised 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
invisible 1
i 1
kneel 1
beside 1
him 1
i 1
guess 1
all 1
those 1
hours 1
decorating 1
cakes 1
paid 1
off 1
peeta 1
smiles 1
yes 1
frosting 1
the 1
final 1
defense 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
youre 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
firmly 1
says 1
who 1
his 1
voice 1
is 1
so 1
ragged 1
says 1
me 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
team 1
now 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
so 1
i 1
heard 1
nice 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
find 1
whats 1
left 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
pull 1
out 1
my 1
water 1
bottle 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
drink 1
did 1
cato 1
cut 1
you 1
i 1
ask 1
left 1
leg 1
up 1
high 1
he 1
answers 1
lets 1
get 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
stream 1
wash 1
you 1
off 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
wounds 1
youve 1
got 1
i 1
say 1
lean 1
down 1
a 1
minute 1
first 1
he 1
says 1
need 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
i 1
lean 1
over 1
and 1
put 1
my 1
good 1
ear 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
which 1
tickle 1
as 1
he 1
whispers 1
remember 1
were 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
so 1
its 1
all 1
right 1
to 1
kiss 1
me 1
anytime 1
you 1
feel 1
like 1
it 1
i 1
jerk 1
my 1
head 1
back 1
but 1
end 1
up 1
laughing 1
thanks 1
ill 1
keep 1
it 1
in 1
mind 1
at 1
least 1
hes 1
still 1
able 1
to 1
joke 1
around 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
start 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
all 1
the 1
levity 1
disappears 1
its 1
only 1
two 1
feet 1
away 1
how 1
hard 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
very 1
hard 1
when 1
i 1
realize 1
hes 1
unable 1
to 1
move 1
an 1
inch 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
hes 1
so 1
weak 1
that 1
the 1
best 1
he 1
can 1
do 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
resist 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
drag 1
him 1
but 1
despite 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
hes 1
doing 1
all 1
he 1
can 1
to 1
keep 1
quiet 1
sharp 1
cries 1
of 1
pain 1
escape 1
him 1
the 1
mud 1
and 1
plants 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
imprisoned 1
him 1
and 1
i 1
finally 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
gigantic 1
tug 1
to 1
break 1
him 1
from 1
their 1
clutches 1
hes 1
still 1
two 1
feet 1
from 1
the 1
water 1
lying 1
there 1
teeth 1
gritted 1
tears 1
cutting 1
trails 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
look 1
peeta 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
roll 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
its 1
very 1
shallow 1
here 1
okay 1
i 1
say 1
excellent 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
crouch 1
down 1
beside 1
him 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
happens 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1

in 1
the 1
water 1
on 1
three 1
i 1
say 1
one 1
two 1
three 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
manage 1
one 1
full 1
roll 1
before 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
stop 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
horrible 1
sound 1
hes 1
making 1
now 1
hes 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
maybe 1
this 1
is 1
better 1
anyway 1
okay 1
change 1
of 1
plans 1
im 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
put 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
besides 1

him 1
in 1
who 1
knows 1
if 1
id 1
ever 1

able 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
out 1

more 1
rolling 1
he 1
asks 1
thats 1
all 1
done 1
lets 1
get 1
you 1
cleaned 1
up 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
me 1
okay 1
i 1
say 1
its 1
hard 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
start 1
he 1
so 1
caked 1
with 1
mud 1
and 1
matted 1
leaves 1
i 1
cant 1
even 1
see 1
his 1
clothes 1
if 1
hes 1
wearing 1
clothes 1
the 1
thought 1
makes 1
me 1
hesitate 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
plunge 1
in 1
naked 1
bodies 1
are 1
no 1
big 1
deal 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
right 1
ive 1
got 1
two 1
water 1
bottles 1
and 1
rues 1
water 1
skin 1
i 1
prop 1
them 1
against 1
rocks 1
in 1
the 1
stream 1
so 1
that 1
two 1
are 1
always 1
filling 1
while 1
i 1
pour 1
the 1
third 1
over 1
peetas 1
body 1
it 1
takes 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
i 1
finally 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
enough 1
mud 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
clothes 1
i 1
gently 1
unzip 1
his 1
jacket 1
unbutton 1
his 1
shirt 1
and 1
ease 1
them 1
off 1
him 1
his 1
undershirt 1
is 1
so 1
plastered 1
into 1
his 1
wounds 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
cut 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
my 1
knife 1
and 1
drench 1
him 1
again 1
to 1
work 1
it 1
loose 1
hes 1
badly 1
bruised 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
burn 1
across 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
four 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
stings 1
if 1
you 1
count 1
the 1
one 1
under 1
his 1
ear 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
bit 1
better 1
this 1
much 1
i 1
can 1
fix 1
i 1
decide 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
upper 1
body 1
first 1
to 1
alleviate 1
some 1
pain 1
before 1
i 1
tackle 1
whatever 1
damage 1
cato 1
did 1
to 1
his 1
leg 1
since 1
treating 1
his 1
wounds 1
seems 1
pointless 1
when 1
hes 1
lying 1
in 1
whats 1
become 1
a 1
mud 1
puddle 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
prop 1
him 1
up 1
against 1
a 1
boulder 1
he 1
sits 1
there 1
uncomplaining 1
while 1
i 1
wash 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
dirt 1
from 1
his 1
hair 1
and 1
skin 1
his 1
flesh 1
is 1
very 1
pale 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
and 1
he 1
no 1
longer 1
looks 1
strong 1
and 1
stocky 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
dig 1
the 1
stingers 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
lumps 1
which 1
causes 1
him 1
to 1
wince 1
but 1
the 1
minute 1
i 1
apply 1
the 1
leaves 1
he 1
sighs 1
in 1
relief 1
while 1
he 1
dries 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
i 1
wash 1
his 1
filthy 1
shirt 1
and 1
jacket 1
and 1
spread 1
them 1
over 1
boulders 1
then 1
i 1
apply 1
the 1
burn 1
cream 1
to 1
his 1
chest 1
this 1
is 1
when 1
i 1
notice 1
how 1
hot 1
his 1
skin 1
is 1
becoming 1
the 1
layer 1
of 1
mud 1
and 1
the 1
bottles 1
of 1
water 1
have 1
disguised 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
hes 1
burning 1
with 1
fever 1
i 1
dig 1
through 1
the 1
firstaid 1
kit 1
i 1
got 1
from 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
and 1

reduce 1
your 1
temperature 1

mother 1

breaks 1
down 1
and 1
buys 1
these 1
on 1
occasion 1
when 1
her 1
home 1
remedies 1
fail 1
swallow 1
these 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
obediently 1
takes 1
the 1
medicine 1

must 1
be 1
hungry 1

slowly 1

his 1
pants 1
off 1
of 1
him 1
i 1

in 1
the 1

over 1
his 1

me 1
for 1
what 1

underneath 1
the 1
deep 1
inflamed 1
gash 1
oozing 1
both 1
blood 1
and 1
pus 1
the 1
swelling 1
of 1
the 1
leg 1
and 1
worst 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
festering 1
flesh 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
disappear 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
like 1
i 1
did 1
that 1
day 1
they 1
brought 1
the 1
burn 1
victim 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
go 1
and 1
hunt 1
while 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
attend 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
neither 1
the 1
skill 1
nor 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
face 1
but 1
theres 1
no 1
one 1
here 1
but 1
me 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
capture 1
the 1
calm 1
demeanor 1
my 1
mother 1
assumes 1
when 1
handling 1
particularly 1
bad 1
cases 1
pretty 1
awful 1
huh 1
says 1
peeta 1
hes 1
watching 1
me 1
closely 1
soso 1
i 1
shrug 1
like 1
its 1
no 1
big 1
deal 1
you 1
should 1
see 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
they 1
bring 1
my 1
mother 1
from 1
the 1
mines 1
i 1
refrain 1
from 1
saying 1
how 1
i 1
usually 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
whenever 1
shes 1
treating 1
anything 1
worse 1
than 1
a 1
cold 1
come 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
much 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
around 1
coughing 1
first 1
thing 1
is 1
to 1
clean 1
it 1
well 1
ive 1
left 1
on 1
peetas 1
undershorts 1
because 1
theyre 1
not 1
in 1
bad 1
shape 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
pull 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
swollen 1
thigh 1
and 1
all 1
right 1
maybe 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
him 1
being 1
naked 1
makes 1
me 1
uncomfortable 1
thats 1
another 1
thing 1
about 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
nakedness 1
has 1
no 1
effect 1
on 1
them 1
gives 1
them 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
embarrassment 1
ironically 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
my 1
little 1
sister 1
would 1
be 1
of 1
far 1
more 1
use 1
to 1
peeta 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
scoot 1
my 1
square 1
of 1
plastic 1
under 1
him 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
wash 1
down 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
him 1
with 1
each 1
bottle 1
i 1
pour 1
over 1
him 1
the 1
worse 1
the 1
wound 1
looks 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
lower 1
body 1
has 1
fared 1
pretty 1
well 1
just 1
one 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
sting 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
small 1
burns 1
that 1
i 1
treat 1
quickly 1
but 1
the 1
gash 1
on 1
his 1
leg 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
for 1
that 1
why 1
dont 1
we 1
give 1
it 1
some 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
trail 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
youll 1
patch 1
it 1
up 1
says 1
peeta 1
he 1
looks 1
almost 1
sorry 1
for 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
knows 1
how 1
lost 1
i 1
am 1
thats 1
right 1
i 1
say 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
you 1
eat 1
these 1
i 1
put 1
a 1
few 1
dried 1
pear 1
halves 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
go 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
stream 1
to 1
wash 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
clothes 1
when 1
theyre 1
flattened 1
out 1
and 1
drying 1
i 1
examine 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
the 1
firstaid 1
kit 1
its 1
pretty 1
basic 1
stuff 1
bandages 1
fever 1
pills 1
medicine 1
to 1
calm 1
stomachs 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
caliber 1
ill 1
need 1
to 1
treat 1
peeta 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
experiment 1
some 1
i 1
admit 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
leaves 1
draw 1
out 1
infection 1
so 1
i 1
start 1
with 1
those 1
within 1
minutes 1
of 1
pressing 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
chewedup 1
green 1
stuff 1
into 1
the 1
wound 1
pus 1
begins 1
running 1
down 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
leg 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
and 1
bite 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
my 1
cheek 1
hard 1
because 1
my 1
breakfast 1
is 1
threatening 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
reappearance 1
katniss 1
peeta 1
says 1
i 1
meet 1
his 1
eyes 1
knowing 1
my 1
face 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
shade 1
of 1
green 1
he 1
mouths 1
the 1
words 1
how 1
about 1
that 1
kiss 1
i 1
burst 1
out 1
laughing 1
because 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
so 1
revolting 1
i 1
cant 1
stand 1
it 1
something 1
wrong 1
he 1
asks 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
innocently 1
i 1
im 1
no 1
good 1
at 1
this 1
im 1
not 1
my 1
mother 1
ive 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
im 1
doing 1
and 1
i 1
hate 1
pus 1
i 1
say 1
euh 1
i 1
allow 1
myself 1
to 1
let 1
out 1
a 1
groan 1
as 1
i 1
rinse 1
away 1
the 1
first 1
round 1
of 1
leaves 1
and 1
apply 1
the 1
second 1
euuuh 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
hunt 1
he 1
asks 1
trust 1
me 1
killing 1
things 1
is 1
much 1
easier 1
than 1
this 1
i 1
say 1
although 1
for 1
all 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
am 1
killing 1
you 1
can 1
you 1
speed 1
it 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
he 1
asks 1
no 1
shut 1
up 1
and 1
eat 1
your 1
pears 1
i 1
say 1
after 1
three 1
applications 1
and 1
what 1
seems 1
like 1
a 1
bucket 1
of 1
pus 1
the 1
wound 1
does 1
look 1
better 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
swelling 1
has 1
gone 1
down 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
how 1
deep 1
catos 1
sword 1
cut 1
right 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bone 1
what 1
next 1
dr 1
everdeen 1
he 1
asks 1
maybe 1
ill 1
put 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
burn 1
ointment 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
helps 1
with 1
infection 1
anyway 1
and 1
wrap 1
it 1
up 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
do 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
seems 1
a 1
lot 1
more 1
manageable 1
covered 1
in 1
clean 1
white 1
cotton 1
although 1
against 1
the 1
sterile 1
bandage 1
the 1
hem 1
of 1
his 1
undershorts 1
looks 1
filthy 1
and 1
teeming 1
with 1
contagion 1
i 1
pull 1
out 1
rues 1
backpack 1
here 1
cover 1
yourself 1
with 1
this 1
and 1
ill 1
wash 1
your 1
shorts 1
oh 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
if 1
you 1
see 1
me 1
says 1
peeta 1
youre 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
family 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
care 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
turn 1
my 1
back 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
stream 1
until 1
the 1
undershorts 1
splash 1
into 1
the 1
current 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
feeling 1
a 1
bit 1
better 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
throw 1
you 1
know 1
youre 1
kind 1
of 1
squeamish 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
lethal 1
person 1
says 1
peeta 1
as 1
i 1
beat 1
the 1
shorts 1
clean 1
between 1
two 1
rocks 1
i 1
wish 1
id 1
let 1
you 1
give 1
haymitch 1
a 1
shower 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
wrinkle 1
my 1
nose 1
at 1
the 1
memory 1
whats 1
he 1
sent 1
you 1
so 1
far 1
not 1
a 1
thing 1
says 1
peeta 1
then 1
theres 1
a 1
pause 1
as 1
it 1
hits 1
him 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
something 1
burn 1
medicine 1
i 1
say 1
almost 1
sheepishly 1
oh 1
and 1
some 1
bread 1
i 1
always 1
knew 1
you 1
were 1
his 1
favorite 1
says 1
peeta 1
please 1
he 1
cant 1
stand 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
say 1
because 1
youre 1
just 1
alike 1
mutters 1
peeta 1
i 1
ignore 1
it 1
though 1
because 1
this 1
really 1
isnt 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
insulting 1
haymitch 1
which 1
is 1
my 1
first 1
impulse 1
i 1
let 1
peeta 1
doze 1
off 1
while 1
his 1
clothes 1
dry 1
out 1
but 1
by 1
late 1
afternoon 1
i 1
dont 1
dare 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
i 1
gently 1
shake 1
his 1
shoulder 1
peeta 1
weve 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
now 1
go 1
he 1
seems 1
confused 1
go 1
where 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
downstream 1
maybe 1
somewhere 1
we 1
can 1
hide 1
you 1
until 1
youre 1
stronger 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
help 1
him 1
dress 1
leaving 1
his 1
feet 1
bare 1
so 1
we 1
can 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
pull 1
him 1
upright 1
his 1
face 1
drains 1
of 1
color 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
puts 1
weight 1
on 1
his 1
leg 1
come 1
on 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
this 1
but 1
he 1
cant 1
not 1
for 1
long 1
anyway 1
we 1
make 1
it 1
about 1
fifty 1
yards 1
downstream 1
with 1
him 1
propped 1
up 1
by 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
hes 1
going 1
to 1
black 1
out 1
i 1
sit 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
push 1
his 1
head 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
pat 1
his 1
back 1
awkwardly 1
as 1
i 1
survey 1
the 1
area 1
of 1
course 1
id 1
love 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
but 1
thats 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
worse 1
though 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
form 1
small 1
cavelike 1
structures 1
i 1
set 1
my 1
sights 1
on 1
one 1
about 1
twenty 1
yards 1
above 1
the 1
stream 1
when 1
peetas 1
able 1
to 1
stand 1
i 1
halfguide 1
halfcarry 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
really 1
id 1
like 1
to 1
look 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
better 1
place 1
but 1
this 1
one 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
because 1
my 1
ally 1
is 1
shot 1
paper 1
white 1
panting 1
and 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
only 1
just 1
cooling 1
off 1
hes 1
shivering 1
i 1
cover 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
with 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
pine 1
needles 1
unroll 1
my 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
tuck 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
pills 1
and 1
some 1
water 1
into 1
him 1
when 1
hes 1
not 1
noticing 1
but 1
he 1
refuses 1
to 1
eat 1
even 1
the 1
fruit 1
then 1
he 1
just 1
lies 1
there 1
his 1
eyes 1
trained 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
as 1
i 1
build 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
blind 1
out 1
of 1
vines 1
to 1
conceal 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
result 1
is 1
unsatisfactory 1
an 1
animal 1
might 1
not 1
question 1
it 1
but 1
a 1
human 1
would 1
see 1
hands 1
had 1
manufactured 1
it 1
quickly 1
enough 1
i 1
tear 1
it 1
down 1
in 1
frustration 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
go 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
brush 1
the 1
hair 1
back 1
from 1
his 1
eyes 1
thanks 1
for 1
finding 1
me 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
i 1
say 1
his 1
foreheads 1
burning 1
up 1
like 1
the 1
medicines 1
having 1
no 1
effect 1
at 1
all 1
suddenly 1
out 1
of 1
nowhere 1
im 1
scared 1
hes 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
yes 1
look 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
make 1
it 1
back 1
he 1
begins 1
dont 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
didnt 1
drain 1
all 1
that 1
pus 1
for 1
nothing 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
just 1
in 1
case 1
i 1
dont 1
he 1
tries 1
to 1
continue 1
no 1
peeta 1
i 1
dont 1
even 1
want 1
to 1
discuss 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
placing 1
my 1
fingers 1
on 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
quiet 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
he 1
insists 1
impulsively 1
i 1
lean 1
forward 1
and 1
kiss 1
him 1
stopping 1
his 1
words 1
this 1
is 1
probably 1
overdue 1

time 1

a 1
boy 1
which 1
should 1
make 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
impression 1
i 1
guess 1
but 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
register 1
is 1
how 1
unnaturally 1
hot 1
his 1
lips 1
are 1
from 1
the 1
fever 1
i 1
break 1
away 1
and 1
pull 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
up 1
around 1
him 1

not 1
going 1
to 1

i 1
forbid 1

right 1
he 1
whispers 1
i 1
step 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cool 1
evening 1
air 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
parachute 1
floats 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
sky 1
my 1
fingers 1
quickly 1
undo 1
the 1
tie 1
hoping 1
for 1
some 1
real 1
medicine 1
to 1
treat 1
peetas 1
leg 1
instead 1
i 1
find 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
hot 1
broth 1
haymitch 1
couldnt 1
be 1
sending 1
me 1
a 1
clearer 1
message 1
one 1
kiss 1
equals 1
one 1
pot 1
of 1
broth 1
i 1
can 1
almost 1
hear 1
his 1
snarl 1
youre 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
sweetheart 1
the 1
boys 1
dying 1

me 1
something 1

work 1
with 1
and 1

right 1
if 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
peeta 1
alive 1
ive 1
got 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
audience 1
something 1
more 1
to 1
care 1
about 1
starcrossed 1
lovers 1
desperate 1
to 1
get 1
home 1
together 1
two 1
hearts 1
beating 1
as 1
one 1
romance 1
never 1
having 1
been 1
in 1
love 1
this 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
real 1
trick 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
the 1
way 1
my 1
father 1
never 1
failed 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
gifts 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
the 1
way 1
my 1
mothers 1
face 1
would 1
light 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
his 1
boots 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
almost 1
stopped 1
living 1
when 1
he 1
died 1
peeta 1
i 1
say 1
trying 1
for 1
the 1
special 1
tone 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
used 1
only 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
hes 1
dozed 1
off 1
again 1
but 1
i 1
kiss 1
him 1
awake 1
which 1
seems 1
to 1
startle 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
smiles 1
as 1
if 1
hed 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
lie 1
there 1
gazing 1
at 1
me 1
forever 1
hes 1
great 1
at 1
this 1
stuff 1
i 1
hold 1
up 1
the 1
pot 1
peeta 1
look 1
what 1
haymitch 1
has 1
sent 1
you 1
getting 1
the 1
broth 1
into 1
peeta 1
takes 1
an 1
hour 1
of 1
coaxing 1
begging 1
threatening 1
and 1
yes 1
kissing 1
but 1
finally 1
sip 1
by 1
sip 1
he 1
empties 1
the 1
pot 1
i 1
let 1
him 1
drift 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
then 1
and 1
attend 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
needs 1
wolfing 1
down 1
a 1
supper 1
of 1
groosling 1
and 1
roots 1
while 1
i 1
watch 1
the 1
daily 1
report 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
no 1
new 1
casualties 1
still 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
audience 1
a 1
fairly 1
interesting 1
day 1
hopefully 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
will 1
allow 1
us 1
a 1
peaceful 1
night 1
i 1
automatically 1
look 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
tree 1
to 1
nest 1
in 1
before 1
i 1
realize 1
thats 1
over 1
at 1
least 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
i 1
cant 1
very 1
well 1
leave 1
peeta 1
unguarded 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
his 1
last 1
hiding 1
place 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
untouched 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
conceal 1
it 1
and 1
were 1
a 1
scant 1
fifty 1
yards 1
downstream 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
glasses 1
place 1
my 1
weapons 1
in 1
readiness 1
and 1
settle 1
down 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
the 1
temperature 1
drops 1
rapidly 1
and 1
soon 1
im 1
chilled 1
to 1
the 1
bone 1
eventually 1
i 1
give 1
in 1
and 1
slide 1
into 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
with 1
peeta 1
its 1
toasty 1
warm 1
and 1
i 1
snuggle 1
down 1
gratefully 1
until 1
i 1
realize 1
its 1
more 1
than 1
warm 1
its 1
overly 1
hot 1
because 1
the 1
bag 1
is 1
reflecting 1
back 1
his 1
fever 1
i 1
check 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
find 1
it 1
burning 1
and 1
dry 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
leave 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
hope 1
the 1
excessive 1
heat 1
breaks 1
the 1
fever 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
hope 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
cools 1
him 1
off 1
i 1
end 1
up 1
just 1
dampening 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
bandage 1
and 1
placing 1
it 1
on 1
his 1
forehead 1
it 1
seems 1
weak 1
but 1
im 1
afraid 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
too 1
drastic 1
i 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
halfsitting 1
halflying 1
next 1
to 1
peeta 1
refreshing 1
the 1
bandage 1
and 1
trying 1
not 1
to 1
dwell 1
on 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
by 1
teaming 1
up 1
with 1
him 1
ive 1
made 1
myself 1
far 1
more 1
vulnerable 1
than 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
tethered 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
on 1
guard 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
sick 1
person 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
but 1
i 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
injured 1
and 1
still 1
i 1
came 1
after 1
him 1
im 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
trust 1
that 1
whatever 1
instinct 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
when 1
the 1
sky 1
turns 1
rosy 1
i 1
notice 1
the 1
sheen 1
of 1
sweat 1
on 1
peetas 1
lip 1
and 1
discover 1
the 1
fever 1
has 1
broken 1
hes 1
not 1
back 1
to 1
normal 1
but 1
its 1
come 1
down 1
a 1
few 1
degrees 1
last 1
night 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
gathering 1
vines 1
i 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
bush 1
of 1
rues 1
berries 1
i 1
strip 1
off 1
the 1
fruit 1
and 1
mash 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
broth 1
pot 1
with 1
cold 1
water 1
peetas 1
struggling 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
when 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
cave 1
i 1
woke 1
up 1
and 1
you 1
were 1
gone 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
was 1
worried 1
about 1
you 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
laugh 1
as 1
i 1
ease 1
him 1
back 1
down 1
you 1
were 1
worried 1
about 1
me 1
have 1
you 1
taken 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
yourself 1
lately 1
i 1
thought 1
cato 1
and 1
clove 1
might 1
have 1
found 1
you 1
they 1
like 1
to 1
hunt 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
says 1
still 1
serious 1
clove 1
which 1
one 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
ask 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
two 1
shes 1
still 1
alive 1
right 1
he 1
says 1
yes 1
theres 1
just 1
them 1
and 1
us 1
and 1
thresh 1
and 1
foxface 1
i 1
say 1
thats 1
what 1
i 1
nicknamed 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
five 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
feel 1
better 1
than 1
yesterday 1
this 1
is 1
an 1
enormous 1
improvement 1
over 1
the 1
mud 1
he 1
says 1
clean 1
clothes 1
and 1
medicine 1
and 1
a 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
you 1
oh 1
right 1
the 1
whole 1
romance 1
thing 1
i 1
reach 1
out 1
to 1
touch 1
his 1
cheek 1
and 1
he 1
catches 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
presses 1
it 1
against 1
his 1
lips 1
i 1
remember 1
my 1
father 1
doing 1
this 1
very 1
thing 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
i 1
wonder 1
where 1
peeta 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
surely 1
not 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
witch 1
no 1
more 1
kisses 1
for 1
you 1
until 1
youve 1
eaten 1
i 1
say 1
we 1
get 1
him 1
propped 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
he 1
obediently 1
swallows 1
the 1
spoonfuls 1
of 1
the 1
berry 1
mush 1
i 1
feed 1
him 1
he 1
refuses 1
the 1
groosling 1
again 1
though 1
you 1
didnt 1
sleep 1
peeta 1
says 1
im 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
say 1
but 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
im 1
exhausted 1
sleep 1
now 1
ill 1
keep 1
watch 1
ill 1
wake 1
you 1
if 1
anything 1
happens 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
hesitate 1
katniss 1
you 1
cant 1
stay 1
up 1
forever 1
hes 1
got 1
a 1
point 1
there 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
sleep 1
eventually 1
and 1
probably 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
now 1
when 1
he 1
seems 1
relatively 1
alert 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
daylight 1
on 1
our 1
side 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
say 1
but 1
just 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
then 1
you 1
wake 1
me 1
its 1
too 1
warm 1
for 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
now 1
i 1
smooth 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
cave 1
floor 1
and 1
lie 1
down 1
one 1
hand 1
on 1
my 1
loaded 1
bow 1
in 1
case 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
shoot 1
at 1
a 1
moments 1
notice 1
peeta 1
sits 1
beside 1
me 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
his 1
bad 1
leg 1
stretched 1
out 1
before 1
him 1
his 1
eyes 1
trained 1
on 1
the 1
world 1
outside 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
he 1
says 1
softly 1
his 1
hand 1
brushes 1
the 1
loose 1
strands 1
of 1
my 1
hair 1
off 1
my 1
forehead 1
unlike 1
the 1
staged 1
kisses 1
and 1
caresses 1
so 1
far 1
this 1
gesture 1
seems 1
natural 1
and 1
comforting 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
he 1
doesnt 1
hes 1
still 1
stroking 1
my 1
hair 1
when 1
i 1
fall 1
asleep 1
too 1
long 1
i 1
sleep 1
too 1
long 1
i 1
know 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
eyes 1
that 1
were 1
into 1
the 1
afternoon 1
peetas 1
right 1
beside 1
me 1
his 1
position 1
unchanged 1
i 1
sit 1
up 1
feeling 1
somehow 1
defensive 1
but 1
better 1
rested 1
than 1
ive 1
been 1
in 1
days 1
peeta 1
you 1
were 1
supposed 1
to 1
wake 1
me 1
after 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
i 1
say 1
for 1
what 1
nothings 1
going 1
on 1
here 1
he 1
says 1
besides 1
i 1
like 1
watching 1
you 1
sleep 1
you 1
dont 1
scowl 1
improves 1
your 1
looks 1
a 1
lot 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
brings 1
on 1
a 1
scowl 1
that 1
makes 1
him 1
grin 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
notice 1
how 1
dry 1
his 1
lips 1
are 1
i 1
test 1
his 1
cheek 1
hot 1
as 1
a 1
coal 1
stove 1
he 1
claims 1
hes 1
been 1
drinking 1
but 1
the 1
containers 1
still 1
feel 1
full 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
give 1
him 1
more 1
fever 1
pills 1
and 1
stand 1
over 1
him 1
while 1
he 1
drinks 1
first 1
one 1
then 1
a 1
second 1
quart 1
of 1
water 1
then 1
i 1
tend 1
to 1
his 1
minor 1
wounds 1
the 1
burns 1
the 1
stings 1
which 1
are 1
showing 1
improvement 1
i 1
steel 1
myself 1
and 1
unwrap 1
the 1
leg 1
my 1
heart 1
drops 1
into 1
my 1
stomach 1
its 1
worse 1
much 1
worse 1
theres 1
no 1
more 1
pus 1
in 1
evidence 1
but 1
the 1
swelling 1
has 1
increased 1
and 1
the 1
tight 1
shiny 1
skin 1
is 1
inflamed 1
then 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
red 1
streaks 1
starting 1
to 1
crawl 1
up 1
his 1
leg 1
blood 1
poisoning 1
unchecked 1
it 1
will 1
kill 1
him 1
for 1
sure 1
my 1
chewedup 1
leaves 1
and 1
ointment 1
wont 1
make 1
a 1
dent 1
in 1
it 1
well 1
need 1
strong 1
antiinfection 1
drugs 1
from 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
cant 1
imagine 1
the 1
cost 1
of 1
such 1
potent 1
medicine 1
if 1
haymitch 1
pooled 1
every 1
donation 1
from 1
every 1
sponsor 1
would 1
he 1
have 1
enough 1
i 1
doubt 1
it 1
gifts 1
go 1
up 1
in 1
price 1
the 1
longer 1
the 1
games 1
continue 1
what 1
buys 1
a 1
full 1
meal 1
on 1
day 1
one 1
buys 1
a 1
cracker 1
on 1
day 1
twelve 1
and 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
medicine 1
peeta 1
needs 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
a 1
premium 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
well 1
theres 1
more 1
swelling 1
but 1
the 1
pus 1
is 1
gone 1
i 1
say 1
in 1
an 1
unsteady 1
voice 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
blood 1
poisoning 1
is 1
katniss 1
says 1
peeta 1

mother 1

a 1
healer 1

just 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
outlast 1
the 1
others 1
peeta 1
theyll 1
cure 1
it 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
capitol 1
when 1
we 1
win 1
i 1
say 1
yes 1
thats 1
a 1
good 1
plan 1
he 1
says 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
this 1
is 1
mostly 1
for 1
my 1
benefit 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
eat 1
keep 1
your 1
strength 1
up 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
soup 1
i 1
say 1
dont 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
he 1
says 1
its 1
not 1
worth 1
it 1
well 1
see 1
i 1
say 1
as 1
i 1
take 1
the 1
pot 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
im 1
struck 1
by 1
how 1
brutally 1
hot 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
swear 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
are 1
progressively 1
ratcheting 1
up 1
the 1
temperature 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
and 1
sending 1
it 1
plummeting 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
sunbaked 1
stones 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
gives 1
me 1
an 1
idea 1
though 1
maybe 1
i 1
wont 1
need 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
i 1
settle 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
big 1
flat 1
rock 1
halfway 1
between 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
the 1
cave 1
after 1
purifying 1
half 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
water 1
i 1
place 1
it 1
in 1
direct 1
sunlight 1
and 1
add 1
several 1
eggsize 1
hot 1
stones 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
im 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
admit 1
im 1
not 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
cook 1
but 1
since 1
soup 1
mainly 1
involves 1
tossing 1
everything 1
in 1
a 1
pot 1
and 1
waiting 1
its 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
better 1
dishes 1
i 1
mince 1
groosling 1
until 1
its 1
practically 1
mush 1
and 1
mash 1
some 1
of 1
rues 1
roots 1
fortunately 1
theyve 1
both 1
been 1
roasted 1
already 1
so 1
they 1
mostly 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
heated 1
up 1
already 1
between 1
the 1
sunlight 1
and 1
the 1
rocks 1
the 1
waters 1
warm 1
i 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
meat 1
and 1
roots 1
swap 1
in 1
fresh 1
rocks 1
and 1
go 1
find 1
something 1
green 1
to 1
spice 1
it 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
before 1
long 1
i 1
discover 1
a 1
tuft 1
of 1
chives 1
growing 1
at 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
some 1
rocks 1
perfect 1
i 1
chop 1
them 1
very 1
fine 1
and 1
add 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
pot 1
switch 1
out 1
the 1
rocks 1
again 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
stew 1
ive 1
seen 1
very 1
few 1
signs 1
of 1
game 1
around 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
comfortable 1
leaving 1
peeta 1
alone 1
while 1
i 1
hunt 1
so 1
i 1
rig 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
snares 1
and 1
hope 1
i 1
get 1
lucky 1
i 1
wonder 1
about 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
how 1
theyre 1
managing 1
now 1
that 1
their 1
main 1
source 1
of 1
food 1
has 1
been 1
blown 1
up 1
at 1
least 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
cato 1
clove 1
and 1
foxface 1
had 1
been 1
relying 1
on 1
it 1
probably 1
not 1
thresh 1
though 1
ive 1
got 1
a 1
feeling 1
he 1
must 1
share 1
some 1
of 1
rues 1
knowledge 1
on 1
how 1
to 1
feed 1
yourself 1
from 1
the 1
earth 1
are 1
they 1
fighting 1
each 1
other 1
looking 1
for 1
us 1
maybe 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
has 1
located 1
us 1
and 1
is 1
just 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
right 1
moment 1
to 1
attack 1
the 1
idea 1
sends 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
peetas 1
stretched 1
out 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
although 1
he 1
brightens 1
a 1
bit 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
in 1
its 1
clear 1
he 1
feels 1
miserable 1
i 1
put 1
cool 1
cloths 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
but 1
they 1
warm 1
up 1
almost 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
touch 1
his 1
skin 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
anything 1
i 1
ask 1
no 1
he 1
says 1
thank 1
you 1
wait 1
yes 1
tell 1
me 1
a 1
story 1
a 1
story 1
what 1
about 1
i 1
say 1
im 1
not 1
much 1
for 1
storytelling 1
its 1
kind 1
of 1
like 1
singing 1
but 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
prim 1
wheedles 1
one 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
something 1
happy 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
happiest 1
day 1
you 1
can 1
remember 1
says 1
peeta 1
something 1
between 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
a 1
huff 1
of 1
exasperation 1
leaves 1
my 1
mouth 1
a 1
happy 1
story 1
this 1
will 1
require 1
a 1
lot 1
more 1
effort 1
than 1
the 1
soup 1
i 1
rack 1
my 1
brains 1
for 1
good 1
memories 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
involve 1
gale 1
and 1
me 1
out 1
hunting 1
and 1
somehow 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
these 1
will 1
play 1
well 1
with 1
either 1
peeta 1
or 1
the 1
audience 1
that 1
leaves 1
prim 1

i 1
ever 1
tell 1
you 1
about 1
how 1
i 1
got 1
prims 1
goat 1
i 1
ask 1
peeta 1
shakes 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
looks 1
at 1
me 1
expectantly 1
so 1
i 1
begin 1
but 1
carefully 1
because 1
my 1
words 1
are 1
going 1
out 1
all 1
over 1
panem 1
and 1
while 1
people 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
put 1
two 1
and 1
two 1
together 1
that 1
i 1
hunt 1
illegally 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
hurt 1
gale 1
or 1
greasy 1
sae 1
or 1
the 1
butcher 1
or 1
even 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
back 1
home 1
who 1
are 1
my 1
customers 1
by 1
publicly 1
announcing 1
theyd 1
breaking 1
the 1
law 1
too 1
heres 1
the 1
real 1
story 1
of 1
how 1
i 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
for 1
prims 1
goat 1
lady 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
friday 1
evening 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
prims 1
tenth 1
birthday 1
in 1
late 1
may 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
school 1
ended 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
hit 1
the 1
woods 1
because 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
enough 1
to 1
trade 1
for 1
a 1
present 1
for 1
prim 1
maybe 1
some 1
new 1
cloth 1
for 1
a 1
dress 1
or 1
a 1
hairbrush 1
our 1
snares 1
had 1
done 1
well 1
enough 1
and 1
the 1
woods 1
were 1
flush 1
with 1
greens 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
really 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
our 1
average 1
fridaynight 1
haul 1
i 1
was 1
disappointed 1
as 1
we 1
headed 1
back 1
even 1
though 1
gale 1
said 1
wed 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
do 1
better 1
tomorrow 1
we 1
were 1
resting 1
a 1
moment 1
by 1
a 1
stream 1
when 1
we 1
saw 1
him 1
a 1
young 1
buck 1
probably 1
a 1
yearling 1
by 1
his 1
size 1
his 1
antlers 1
were 1
just 1
growing 1
in 1
still 1
small 1
and 1
coated 1
in 1
velvet 1
poised 1
to 1
run 1
but 1
unsure 1
of 1
us 1
unfamiliar 1
with 1
humans 1
beautiful 1
less 1
beautiful 1
perhaps 1
when 1
the 1
two 1
arrows 1
caught 1
him 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
neck 1
the 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
chest 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
shot 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
the 1
buck 1
tried 1
to 1
run 1
but 1
stumbled 1
and 1
gales 1
knife 1
slit 1
his 1
throat 1
before 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
momentarily 1
id 1
felt 1
a 1
pang 1
at 1
killing 1
something 1
so 1
fresh 1
and 1
innocent 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
stomach 1
rumbled 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
fresh 1
and 1
innocent 1
meat 1
a 1
deer 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
brought 1
down 1
three 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
first 1
one 1
a 1
doe 1
that 1
had 1
injured 1
her 1
leg 1
somehow 1
almost 1
didnt 1
count 1
but 1
we 1
knew 1
from 1
that 1
experience 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
dragging 1
the 1
carcass 1
into 1
the 1
hob 1
it 1
had 1
caused 1
chaos 1
with 1
people 1
bidding 1
on 1
parts 1
and 1
actually 1
trying 1
to 1
hack 1
off 1
pieces 1
themselves 1
greasy 1
sae 1
had 1
intervened 1
and 1
sent 1
us 1
with 1
our 1
deer 1
to 1
the 1
butcher 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
itd 1
been 1
badly 1
damaged 1
hunks 1
of 1
meat 1
taken 1
the 1
hide 1
riddled 1
with 1
holes 1
although 1
everybody 1
paid 1
up 1
fairly 1
it 1
had 1
lowered 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
the 1
kill 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
waited 1
until 1
dark 1
fell 1
and 1
slipped 1
under 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
fence 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
butcher 1
even 1
though 1
we 1
were 1
known 1
hunters 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
to 1
go 1
carrying 1
a 1
pound 1
deer 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
district 1
in 1
daylight 1
like 1
we 1
were 1
rubbing 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
officials 1
faces 1
the 1
butcher 1
a 1
short 1
chunky 1
woman 1
named 1
rooba 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
when 1
we 1
knocked 1
you 1
dont 1
haggle 1
with 1
rooba 1
she 1
gives 1
you 1
one 1
price 1
which 1
you 1
can 1
take 1
or 1
leave 1
but 1
its 1
a 1
fair 1
price 1
we 1
took 1
her 1
offer 1
on 1
the 1
deer 1
and 1
she 1
threw 1
in 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
venison 1
steaks 1
we 1
could 1
pick 1
up 1
after 1
the 1
butchering 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
divided 1
in 1
two 1
neither 1
gale 1
nor 1
i 1
had 1
held 1
so 1
much 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
in 1
our 1
lives 1
we 1
decided 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
a 1
secret 1
and 1
surprise 1
our 1
families 1
with 1
the 1
meat 1
and 1
money 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
this 1
is 1
where 1
i 1
really 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
for 1

goat 1

old 1
silver 1

over 1
the 1
goat 1
as 1

idly 1
curious 1

the 1
butcher 1

the 1
man 1

around 1
and 1

i 1
turned 1
and 1

coming 1
across 1
the 1
square 1
toward 1
us 1
lucky 1
thing 1

the 1
goat 1
man 1
when 1
she 1
arrived 1
girls 1
got 1
her 1
eye 1
on 1
your 1
goat 1
not 1
if 1
shes 1
spoken 1
for 1
i 1
said 1
carelessly 1
rooba 1
looked 1
me 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
then 1
frowned 1
at 1
the 1
goat 1
shes 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
shoulder 1
bet 1
you 1
half 1
the 1
carcass 1
will 1
be 1
too 1
rotten 1
for 1
even 1
sausage 1
what 1
said 1
the 1
goat 1
man 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
deal 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
deal 1
on 1
an 1
animal 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
teeth 1
marks 1
not 1
that 1
thing 1
sell 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
if 1
shes 1
stupid 1
enough 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
said 1
rooba 1
as 1
she 1
marched 1
off 1
i 1
caught 1
her 1
wink 1
the 1
goat 1
man 1
was 1
mad 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
wanted 1
that 1
goal 1
off 1
his 1
hands 1
it 1
took 1
us 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
agree 1
on 1
the 1
price 1
quite 1
a 1
crowd 1
had 1
gathered 1
by 1
then 1
to 1
hand 1
out 1
opinions 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
deal 1
if 1
the 1
goat 1
lived 1
id 1
been 1
robbed 1
if 1
she 1
died 1
people 1
took 1
sides 1
in 1
the 1
argument 1
but 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
goat 1
gale 1
offered 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
look 1
on 1
prims 1
face 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
complete 1
giddiness 1
i 1
bought 1
a 1
pink 1
ribbon 1
and 1
tied 1
it 1
around 1
her 1
neck 1
then 1
we 1
hurried 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
seen 1
prims 1
reaction 1
when 1
we 1
walked 1
in 1
with 1
that 1
goat 1
remember 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
girl 1
who 1
wept 1
to 1
save 1
that 1
awful 1
old 1
cat 1
buttercup 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
she 1
started 1
crying 1
and 1
laughing 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
less 1
sure 1
seeing 1
the 1
injury 1
but 1
the 1
pair 1
of 1
them 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
it 1
grinding 1
up 1
herbs 1
and 1
coaxing 1
brews 1
down 1
the 1
animals 1
throat 1
they 1
sound 1
like 1
you 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
had 1
almost 1
forgotten 1
he 1
was 1
there 1

peeta 1
they 1
work 1
magic 1
that 1
thing 1
couldnt 1
have 1
died 1
if 1
it 1
tried 1
i 1
say 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
bite 1
my 1
tongue 1
realizing 1
what 1
that 1
must 1
sound 1
like 1
to 1
peeta 1
who 1
is 1
dying 1
in 1
my 1
incompetent 1
hands 1
dont 1
worry 1

not 1
trying 1
he 1
jokes 1
finish 1
the 1
story 1
well 1

it 1
only 1
i 1

that 1
night 1

on 1
sleeping 1
with 1
lady 1
on 1
a 1
blanket 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
just 1
before 1
they 1
drifted 1
off 1
the 1
goat 1
licked 1
her 1
cheek 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
giving 1
her 1
a 1
good 1
night 1
kiss 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
mad 1
about 1
her 1
was 1
it 1
still 1
wearing 1
the 1
pink 1
ribbon 1
he 1
asks 1
i 1
think 1
so 1
i 1
say 1
why 1
im 1
just 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
picture 1
he 1
says 1
thoughtfully 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
why 1
that 1
day 1
made 1
you 1
happy 1
well 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
goat 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
gold 1
mine 1
say 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
was 1
referring 1
to 1
that 1
not 1
the 1
lasting 1
joy 1
you 1
gave 1
the 1
sister 1
you 1
love 1
so 1
much 1
you 1
took 1
her 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
reaping 1
says 1
peeta 1
drily 1
the 1
goat 1
has 1
paid 1
for 1
itself 1
several 1
times 1
over 1
i 1
say 1
in 1
a 1
superior 1
tone 1
well 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
dare 1
do 1
anything 1
else 1
after 1
you 1
saved 1
its 1
life 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
really 1
what 1

lot 1
of 1
trouble 1

get 1
it 1
all 1
back 1
he 1
says 1

not 1
making 1
sense 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
test 1
his 1
forehead 1
the 1
levers 1
going 1
nowhere 1
but 1
up 1
youre 1
a 1
little 1
cooler 1
though 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
trumpets 1
startles 1
me 1
im 1
on 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1

indifference 1
when 1
he 1
says 1

some 1
of 1
you 1
may 1
already 1

survived 1
this 1
long 1
he 1

to 1
mimic 1
me 1
i 1

that 1
goat 1

be 1
a 1
little 1
gold 1

youre 1
a 1

shakes 1
his 1
head 1
never 1

youll 1
lose 1
your 1

partway 1
i 1

to 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
but 1
if 1

yelling 1
your 1
name 1
i 1
bet 1
someone 1
can 1
find 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
ill 1
be 1
dead 1
for 1
sure 1
he 1
says 1
you 1
wont 1
get 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
here 1
on 1
that 1

peeta 1
you 1
go 1
and 1
im 1
going 1
too 1
hes 1
just 1
stubborn 1
enough 1
and 1
maybe 1
just 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
come 1
howling 1
after 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
even 1
if 1
a 1
tribute 1
doesnt 1
find 1
him 1
something 1
else 1
might 1
he 1
cant 1
defend 1
himself 1
id 1
probably 1
have 1
to 1
wall 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
just 1
to 1
go 1
myself 1
and 1
who 1
knows 1
what 1
the 1
exertion 1
will 1
do 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
supposed 1
to 1
do 1
sit 1
here 1
and 1
watch 1
you 1
die 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
must 1
know 1
thats 1
not 1
an 1
option 1
that 1
the 1
audience 1
would 1
hate 1
me 1
and 1
frankly 1
i 1
would 1
hate 1
myself 1
too 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
even 1
try 1
i 1
wont 1
die 1

promise 1
if 1
you 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1

at 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
stalemate 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
cant 1
argue 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
one 1
so 1
i 1
dont 1
try 1
i 1
pretend 1
reluctantly 1
to 1
go 1
along 1
then 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
drink 1
your 1
water 1
wake 1
me 1
when 1

you 1
and 1
eat 1
every 1
bite 1
of 1
the 1
soup 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
disgusting 1
it 1
is 1

it 1
ready 1

cold 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
suns 1
still 1
up 1

right 1
about 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
messing 1
with 1
the 1
temperature 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
thing 1
someone 1
needs 1
desperately 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
blanket 1
the 1
soup 1
is 1
still 1
nice 1
and 1
warm 1
in 1
its 1
iron 1
pot 1
and 1
actually 1
doesnt 1
taste 1
too 1
bad 1
peeta 1
eats 1
without 1
complaint 1
even 1
scraping 1
out 1
the 1
pot 1
to 1
show 1
his 1
enthusiasm 1
he 1
rambles 1
on 1
about 1
how 1
delicious 1
it 1
is 1
which 1
should 1
be 1
encouraging 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
fever 1
does 1
to 1
people 1
hes 1
like 1
listening 1
to 1
haymitch 1
before 1
the 1
alcohol 1
has 1
soaked 1
him 1
into 1
incoherence 1
i 1
give 1
him 1
another 1
dose 1
of 1
fever 1
medicine 1
before 1
he 1
goes 1
off 1
his 1
head 1
completely 1
as 1
i 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
to 1
wash 1
up 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
think 1
is 1
that 1
hes 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
to 1
that 1
feast 1
ill 1
keep 1
him 1
going 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
infection 1
will 1
reach 1
his 1
heart 1
or 1
his 1
brain 1
or 1
his 1
lungs 1
and 1
hell 1
be 1
gone 1
and 1
ill 1
be 1
here 1
all 1
alone 1
again 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
others 1
im 1
so 1
lost 1
in 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
almost 1
miss 1
the 1
parachute 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
floats 1
right 1
by 1
me 1
then 1
i 1
spring 1
after 1
it 1
yanking 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
water 1
tearing 1
off 1
the 1
silver 1
fabric 1
to 1
retrieve 1
the 1
vial 1

gaggle 1
of 1
romantic 1
fools 1
to 1
sell 1
their 1
jewels 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
save 1
peeta 1
its 1
such 1
a 1
tiny 1
vial 1
though 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
strong 1
to 1
cure 1
someone 1
as 1
ill 1
as 1
peeta 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
doubt 1
runs 1
through 1
me 1
i 1
uncork 1
the 1
vial 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
deep 1
sniff 1

spirits 1
fall 1
at 1
the 1
sickly 1
sweet 1
scent 1

to 1
be 1
sure 1
i 1
place 1
a 1
drop 1
on 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
my 1
tongue 1
theres 1
no 1
question 1
its 1
sleep 1
syrup 1
its 1
a 1
common 1
medicine 1
in 1
district 1
cheap 1
as 1
medicine 1
goes 1
but 1
very 1
addictive 1
almost 1
everyones 1
had 1
a 1
dose 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
we 1

a 1
bottle 1
at 1
home 1

it 1
to 1
hysterical 1
patients 1
to 1
knock 1
them 1
out 1
to 1
stitch 1
up 1
a 1
bad 1
wound 1
or 1
quiet 1
their 1
minds 1
or 1
just 1
to 1
help 1
someone 1
in 1
pain 1
get 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
it 1
only 1
takes 1
a 1
little 1
a 1
vial 1
this 1
size 1
could 1
knock 1
peeta 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
full 1
day 1
but 1
what 1
good 1
is 1
that 1
im 1
so 1
furious 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
throw 1
haymitchs 1
last 1
offering 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
when 1
it 1
hits 1
me 1
a 1
full 1
day 1
thats 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
need 1
i 1
mash 1
up 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
berries 1
so 1
the 1
taste 1
wont 1
be 1
as 1
noticeable 1
and 1
add 1
some 1
mint 1
leaves 1
for 1
good 1
measure 1
then 1
i 1
head 1
back 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
ive 1
brought 1
you 1
a 1
treat 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
new 1
patch 1
of 1
berries 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
downstream 1
peeta 1
opens 1
his 1
mouth 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
bite 1
without 1
hesitation 1
he 1
swallows 1
then 1
frowns 1
slightly 1
theyre 1
very 1
sweet 1
yes 1
theyre 1
sugar 1
berries 1
my 1
mother 1
makes 1
jam 1
from 1
them 1
havent 1
you 1
ever 1
had 1
them 1
before 1
i 1
say 1
poking 1
the 1
next 1
spoonful 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
no 1
he 1
says 1
almost 1
puzzled 1
but 1
they 1
taste 1
familiar 1
sugar 1
berries 1
well 1
you 1
cant 1
get 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
much 1
they 1
only 1
grow 1
wild 1
i 1
say 1
another 1
mouthful 1
goes 1
down 1
just 1
one 1
more 1
to 1
go 1
theyre 1
sweet 1
as 1
syrup 1
he 1
says 1
taking 1
the 1
last 1
spoonful 1
syrup 1
his 1
eyes 1
widen 1
as 1
he 1
realizes 1
the 1
truth 1
i 1
clamp 1
my 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
nose 1
hard 1
forcing 1
him 1
to 1
swallow 1
instead 1
of 1
spit 1
he 1
tries 1
to 1
make 1
himself 1
vomit 1
the 1
stuff 1
up 1
but 1
its 1
too 1
late 1
hes 1
already 1
losing 1
consciousness 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
fades 1
away 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
what 1
ive 1
done 1
is 1
unforgivable 1
i 1
sit 1
back 1
on 1
my 1
heels 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
sadness 1
and 1
satisfaction 1
a 1
stray 1
berry 1
stains 1
his 1
chin 1
and 1
i 1
wipe 1
it 1
away 1
who 1
cant 1
lie 1
peeta 1
i 1
say 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
cant 1
hear 1
me 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
panem 1
can 1
in 1
the 1
remaining 1
hours 1
before 1
nightfall 1
i 1
gather 1
rocks 1
and 1
do 1
my 1
best 1
to 1
camouflage 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
its 1
a 1
slow 1
and 1
arduous 1
process 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
sweating 1
and 1
shifting 1
things 1
around 1
im 1
pretty 1
pleased 1
with 1
my 1
work 1
the 1
cave 1
now 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
larger 1
pile 1
of 1
rocks 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
i 1
can 1
still 1
crawl 1
in 1
to 1
peeta 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
opening 1
but 1
its 1
undetectable 1
from 1
the 1
out 1
side 1
thats 1
good 1
because 1
ill 1
need 1
to 1
share 1
that 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
again 1
tonight 1
also 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
make 1
it 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
feast 1
peeta 1
will 1
be 1
hidden 1
but 1
not 1
entirely 1
imprisoned 1
although 1
i 1
doubt 1
he 1
can 1
hang 1
on 1
much 1
longer 1
without 1
medicine 1
if 1
i 1
die 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
district 1
isnt 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
victor 1
i 1
make 1
a 1
meal 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
smaller 1
bonier 1
fish 1
that 1
inhabit 1
the 1
stream 1
down 1
here 1
fill 1
every 1
water 1
container 1
and 1
purify 1
it 1
and 1
clean 1
my 1
weapons 1
ive 1
nine 1
arrows 1
left 1
in 1
all 1
i 1
debate 1
leaving 1
the 1
knife 1
with 1
peeta 1
so 1
hell 1
have 1
some 1
protection 1
while 1
im 1
gone 1
but 1
theres 1
really 1
no 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
camouflage 1
being 1
his 1
final 1
defense 1
but 1
i 1
still 1
might 1
have 1
use 1
for 1
the 1
knife 1
who 1
knows 1
what 1
ill 1
encounter 1
here 1
are 1
some 1
things 1
im 1
fairly 1
certain 1
of 1
that 1
at 1
least 1
cato 1
clove 1
and 1
thresh 1
will 1
be 1
on 1
hand 1
when 1
the 1
feast 1
starts 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
about 1
foxface 1
since 1
direct 1
confrontation 1
isnt 1
her 1
style 1
or 1
her 1
forte 1
shes 1
even 1
smaller 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
and 1
unarmed 1
unless 1
shes 1
picked 1
up 1
some 1
weapons 1
recently 1
shell 1
probably 1
be 1
hanging 1
somewhere 1
nearby 1
seeing 1
what 1
she 1
can 1
scavenge 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
three 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
my 1
hands 1
full 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
kill 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
is 1
my 1
greatest 1
asset 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
ill 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
things 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
backpack 1
the 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
number 1
on 1
it 1
that 1
claudius 1
templesmith 1
mentioned 1
i 1
watch 1
the 1
sky 1
hoping 1
for 1
one 1
less 1
opponent 1
at 1
dawn 1
but 1
nobody 1
appears 1
tonight 1
tomorrow 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
faces 1
up 1
there 1
feasts 1
always 1
result 1
in 1
fatalities 1
i 1
crawl 1
into 1
the 1
cave 1
secure 1
my 1
glasses 1
and 1
curl 1
up 1
next 1
to 1
peeta 1
luckily 1
i 1
had 1
that 1
good 1
long 1
sleep 1
today 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
stay 1
awake 1
i 1
dont 1
really 1
think 1
anyone 1
will 1
attack 1
our 1
cave 1
tonight 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
risk 1
missing 1
the 1
dawn 1
so 1
cold 1
so 1
bitterly 1
cold 1
tonight 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
have 1
sent 1
an 1
infusion 1
of 1
frozen 1
air 1
across 1
the 1
arena 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
exactly 1
what 1
theyve 1
done 1
i 1
lay 1
next 1
to 1
peeta 1
in 1
the 1
bag 1
trying 1
to 1
absorb 1
every 1
bit 1
of 1
his 1
fever 1
heat 1
its 1
strange 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
physically 1
close 1
to 1
someone 1
whos 1
so 1
distant 1
peeta 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
or 1
in 1
district 1
or 1
on 1
the 1
moon 1
right 1
now 1
hed 1
be 1
no 1
harder 1
to 1
reach 1
ive 1
never 1
felt 1
lonelier 1
since 1
the 1
games 1
began 1
just 1
accept 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
bad 1
night 1
i 1
tell 1
myself 1
i 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
thinking 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
wondering 1
if 1
theyll 1
sleep 1
a 1
wink 1
tonight 1
at 1
this 1
late 1
stage 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
with 1
an 1
important 1
event 1
like 1
the 1
feast 1
school 1
will 1
probably 1
be 1
canceled 1
my 1
family 1
can 1
either 1
watch 1
on 1
that 1
staticfilled 1
old 1
clunker 1
of 1
a 1
television 1
at 1
home 1
or 1
join 1
the 1
crowds 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
to 1
watch 1
on 1
the 1
big 1
clear 1
screens 1
theyll 1
have 1
privacy 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
support 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
people 1
will 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
kind 1
word 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
food 1
if 1
they 1
can 1
spare 1
it 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
baker 1
has 1
sought 1
them 1
out 1
especially 1
now 1
that 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
a 1
team 1
and 1
made 1
good 1
on 1
his 1
promise 1
to 1
keep 1
my 1
sisters 1
belly 1
full 1
spirits 1
must 1
be 1
running 1
high 1
in 1
district 1
we 1
so 1
rarely 1
have 1
anyone 1
to 1
root 1
for 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
surely 1
people 1
are 1
excited 1
about 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
especially 1
now 1
that 1
were 1
together 1
if 1
i 1
close 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
can 1
imagine 1
their 1
shouts 1
at 1
the 1
screens 1
urging 1
us 1
on 1
i 1
see 1
their 1
faces 1
greasy 1
sac 1
and 1
madge 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
peacekeepers 1
who 1
buy 1
my 1
meat 1
cheering 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
gale 1
i 1
know 1
him 1
he 1
wont 1
be 1
shouting 1
and 1
cheering 1
but 1
hell 1
be 1
watching 1
every 1
moment 1
every 1
twist 1
and 1
turn 1
and 1
willing 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
home 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
hes 1
hoping 1
that 1
peeta 1
makes 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
gales 1
not 1
my 1
boyfriend 1
but 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
if 1
i 1
opened 1
that 1
door 1
he 1
talked 1
about 1
us 1
running 1
away 1
together 1
was 1
that 1
just 1
a 1
practical 1
calculation 1
of 1
our 1
chances 1
of 1
survival 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
district 1
or 1
something 1
more 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
he 1
makes 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
kissing 1
through 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
rocks 1
i 1
watch 1
the 1
moon 1
cross 1
the 1
sky 1
at 1
what 1
i 1
judge 1
to 1
be 1
about 1
three 1
hours 1
before 1
dawn 1
i 1
begin 1
final 1
preparations 1
im 1
careful 1
to 1
leave 1
peeta 1
with 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
medical 1
kit 1
right 1
beside 1
him 1
nothing 1
else 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
much 1
use 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
return 1
and 1
even 1
these 1
would 1
only 1
prolong 1
his 1
life 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
after 1
some 1
debate 1
i 1
strip 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
zip 1
it 1
on 1
over 1
my 1
own 1
he 1
doesnt 1
need 1
it 1
not 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
with 1
his 1
fever 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
if 1
im 1
not 1
there 1
to 1
remove 1
it 1
hell 1
be 1
roasting 1
in 1
it 1
my 1
hands 1
are 1
already 1
stiff 1
from 1
cold 1
so 1
i 1
take 1
rues 1
spare 1
pair 1
of 1
socks 1
cut 1
holes 1
for 1
my 1
fingers 1
and 1
thumbs 1
and 1
pull 1
them 1
on 1
it 1
helps 1
anyway 1
i 1
fill 1
her 1
small 1
pack 1
with 1
some 1
food 1
a 1
water 1
bottle 1
and 1
bandages 1
tuck 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
my 1
belt 1
get 1
my 1
bow 1
and 1
arrows 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
leave 1
when 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
sustaining 1
the 1
starcrossed 1
lover 1
routine 1
and 1
i 1
lean 1
over 1
and 1
give 1
peeta 1
a 1
long 1
lingering 1
kiss 1
i 1
imagine 1
the 1
teary 1
sighs 1
emanating 1
from 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
brush 1
away 1
a 1
tear 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
then 1
i 1
squeeze 1
through 1
the 1
opening 1
in 1
the 1
rocks 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
night 1
my 1
breath 1
makes 1
small 1
white 1
clouds 1
as 1
it 1
hits 1
the 1
air 1
its 1
as 1
cold 1
as 1
a 1
november 1
night 1
at 1
home 1
one 1
where 1
ive 1
slipped 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
lantern 1
in 1
hand 1
to 1
join 1
gale 1
at 1
some 1
prearranged 1
place 1
where 1
well 1
sit 1
bundled 1
together 1
sipping 1
herb 1
tea 1
from 1
metal 1
flasks 1
wrapped 1
in 1
quilting 1
hoping 1
game 1
will 1
pass 1
our 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
morning 1
comes 1
on 1
oh 1
gale 1
i 1
think 1
if 1
only 1
you 1
had 1
my 1
back 1
now 1
i 1
move 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
i 1
dare 1
the 1
glasses 1
are 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
but 1
i 1
still 1
sorely 1
miss 1
having 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
explosion 1
did 1
but 1
it 1
damaged 1
something 1
deep 1
and 1
irreparable 1
never 1
mind 1
if 1
i 1
get 1
home 1
ill 1
be 1
so 1
stinking 1
rich 1
ill 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
pay 1
someone 1
to 1
do 1
my 1
hearing 1
the 1
woods 1
always 1
look 1
different 1
at 1
night 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
glasses 1
everything 1
has 1
an 1
unfamiliar 1
slant 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
daytime 1
trees 1
and 1
flowers 1
and 1
stones 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
sent 1
slightly 1
more 1
ominous 1
versions 1
of 1
themselves 1
to 1
take 1
their 1
places 1
i 1
dont 1
try 1
anything 1
tricky 1
like 1
taking 1
a 1
new 1
route 1
i 1
make 1
my 1
way 1
back 1
up 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
follow 1
the 1
same 1
path 1
back 1
to 1
rues 1
hiding 1
place 1
near 1
the 1
lake 1
along 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
another 1
tribute 1
not 1
a 1
puff 1
of 1
breath 1
not 1
a 1
quiver 1
of 1
a 1
branch 1
either 1
im 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
arrive 1
or 1
the 1
others 1
positioned 1
themselves 1
last 1
night 1
theres 1
still 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
maybe 1
two 1
when 1
i 1
wriggle 1
into 1
the 1
underbrush 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
begin 1
to 1
flow 1
i 1
chew 1
a 1
few 1
mint 1
leaves 1
my 1
stomach 1
isnt 1
up 1
for 1
much 1
more 1
thank 1
goodness 1
i 1
have 1
peetas 1
jacket 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
if 1
not 1
id 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
move 1
around 1
to 1
stay 1
warm 1
the 1
sky 1
turns 1
a 1
misty 1
morning 1
gray 1
and 1
still 1
theres 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
its 1
not 1
surprising 1
really 1
everyone 1
has 1
distinguished 1
themselves 1
either 1
by 1
strength 1
or 1
deadliness 1
or 1
cunning 1
do 1
they 1
suppose 1
i 1
wonder 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
peeta 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
doubt 1
foxface 1
and 1
thresh 1
even 1
know 1
he 1
was 1
wounded 1
all 1
the 1
better 1
if 1
they 1
think 1
hes 1
covering 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
backpack 1
but 1
where 1
is 1
it 1
the 1
arena 1
has 1
lightened 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
remove 1
my 1
glasses 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
morning 1
birds 1
singing 1
isnt 1
it 1
time 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
im 1
panicked 1
that 1
im 1
at 1
the 1
wrong 1
location 1
but 1
no 1
im 1
certain 1
i 1
remember 1
claudius 1
templesmith 1
specifying 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
wheres 1
my 1
feast 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
ray 1
of 1
sun 1
glints 1
off 1
the 1
gold 1
cornucopia 1
theres 1
a 1
disturbance 1
on 1
the 1
plain 1
the 1
ground 1
before 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
splits 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
a 1
round 1
table 1
with 1
a 1
snowy 1
white 1
cloth 1
rises 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
sit 1
four 1
backpacks 1
two 1
large 1
black 1
ones 1
with 1
the 1
numbers 1
and 1
a 1
mediumsize 1
green 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
number 1
and 1
a 1
tiny 1
orange 1
one 1
really 1
i 1
could 1
carry 1
it 1
around 1
my 1
wrist 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
marked 1
with 1
a 1
the 1
table 1
has 1
just 1
clicked 1
into 1
place 1
when 1
a 1
figure 1
darts 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
snags 1
the 1
green 1
backpack 1
and 1
speeds 1
off 1
foxface 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
risky 1
idea 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
are 1
still 1
poised 1
around 1
the 1
plain 1
sizing 1
up 1
the 1
situation 1
and 1
shes 1
got 1
hers 1
shes 1
got 1
us 1
trapped 1
too 1
because 1
no 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
chase 1
her 1
down 1
not 1
while 1
their 1
own 1
pack 1
sits 1
so 1
vulnerable 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
foxface 1
must 1
have 1
purposefully 1
left 1
the 1
other 1
packs 1
alone 1
knowing 1
that 1
to 1
steal 1
one 1
without 1
her 1
number 1
would 1
definitely 1
bring 1
on 1
a 1
pursuer 1
that 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
strategy 1
by 1
the 1
lime 1
ive 1
worked 1
through 1
the 1
emotions 1
of 1
surprise 1
admiration 1
anger 1
jealousy 1
and 1
frustration 1
im 1
watching 1
that 1
reddish 1
mane 1
of 1
hair 1
disappear 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
well 1
out 1
of 1
shooting 1
range 1
huh 1
im 1
always 1
dreading 1
the 1
others 1
but 1
maybe 1
foxface 1
is 1
the 1
real 1
opponent 1
here 1
shes 1
cost 1
me 1
time 1
too 1
because 1
by 1
now 1
its 1
clear 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
next 1
anyone 1
who 1
beats 1
me 1
to 1
it 1
will 1
easily 1
scoop 1
up 1
my 1
pack 1
and 1
be 1
gone 1
without 1
hesitation 1
i 1
sprint 1
for 1
the 1
table 1
i 1
can 1
sense 1
the 1
emergence 1
of 1
danger 1
before 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
fortunately 1
the 1
first 1
knife 1
comes 1
whizzing 1
in 1
on 1
my 1
right 1
side 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
it 1
and 1
im 1
able 1
to 1
deflect 1
it 1
with 1
my 1
bow 1
i 1
turn 1
drawing 1
back 1
the 1
bowstring 1
and 1
send 1
an 1
arrow 1
straight 1
at 1
cloves 1
heart 1
she 1
turns 1
just 1
enough 1
to 1
avoid 1
a 1
fatal 1
hit 1
but 1
the 1
point 1
punctures 1
her 1
upper 1
left 1
arm 1
unfortunately 1
she 1
throws 1
with 1
her 1
right 1
but 1
its 1
enough 1
to 1
slow 1
her 1
down 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
having 1
to 1
pull 1
the 1
arrow 1
from 1
her 1
arm 1
take 1
in 1
the 1
severity 1
of 1
the 1
wound 1
i 1
keep 1
moving 1
positioning 1
the 1
next 1
arrow 1
automatically 1
as 1
only 1
someone 1
who 1
has 1
hunted 1
for 1
years 1
can 1
do 1
im 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
now 1
my 1
fingers 1
closing 1
over 1
the 1
tiny 1
orange 1
backpack 1
my 1
hand 1
slips 1
between 1
the 1
straps 1
and 1
i 1
yank 1
it 1
up 1
on 1
my 1
arm 1
its 1
really 1
too 1
small 1
to 1
fit 1
on 1
any 1
other 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
anatomy 1
and 1
im 1
turning 1
to 1
fire 1
again 1
when 1
the 1
second 1
knife 1
catches 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
forehead 1
it 1
slices 1
above 1
my 1
right 1
eyebrow 1
opening 1
a 1
gash 1
that 1
sends 1
a 1
gush 1
running 1
down 1
my 1
face 1
blinding 1
my 1
eye 1
filling 1
my 1
mouth 1
with 1
the 1
sharp 1
metallic 1
taste 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
blood 1
i 1
stagger 1
backward 1
but 1
still 1
manage 1
to 1
send 1
my 1
readied 1
arrow 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
direction 1
of 1
my 1
assailant 1
i 1
know 1
as 1
it 1
leaves 1
my 1
hands 1
it 1
will 1
miss 1
and 1
then 1
clove 1
slams 1
into 1
me 1
knocking 1
me 1
flat 1
on 1
my 1
back 1
pinning 1
my 1
shoulders 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
her 1
knees 1
this 1
is 1
it 1
i 1
think 1
and 1
hope 1
for 1
prims 1
sake 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
fast 1
but 1
clove 1
means 1
to 1
savor 1
the 1
moment 1
even 1
feels 1
she 1
has 1
time 1
no 1
doubt 1
cato 1
is 1
somewhere 1
nearby 1
guarding 1
her 1
waiting 1
for 1
thresh 1
and 1
possibly 1
peeta 1
wheres 1
your 1
boyfriend 1
district 1
twelve 1
still 1
hanging 1
on 1
she 1
asks 1
well 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
were 1
talking 1
im 1
alive 1
hes 1
out 1
there 1
now 1
hunting 1
cato 1
i 1
snarl 1
at 1
her 1
then 1
i 1
scream 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
lungs 1
peeta 1
clove 1
jams 1
her 1
fist 1
into 1
my 1
windpipe 1
very 1
effectively 1
cutting 1
off 1
my 1
voice 1
but 1
her 1
heads 1
whipping 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
shes 1
at 1
least 1
considering 1
im 1
telling 1
the 1
truth 1
since 1
no 1
peeta 1
appears 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
she 1
turns 1
back 1
to 1
me 1

carefully 1

almost 1
daintylooking 1
number 1
with 1
a 1
cruel 1
curved 1
blade 1

little 1
ally 1

around 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
rue 1
well 1

nature 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
lover 1
boy 1
how 1

that 1
sound 1
clove 1
asks 1
now 1
where 1
to 1
start 1
she 1
carelessly 1
wipes 1
away 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
wound 1
with 1
her 1
jacket 1
sleeve 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
she 1
surveys 1
my 1
face 1
tilting 1
it 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
as 1
if 1
its 1
a 1
block 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
shes 1
deciding 1
exactly 1
what 1
pattern 1
to 1
carve 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
attempt 1
to 1
bite 1
her 1
hand 1
but 1
she 1
grabs 1
the 1
hair 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
head 1
forcing 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
think 1
she 1
almost 1
purrs 1
i 1
think 1
well 1
start 1
with 1
your 1
mouth 1
i 1
clamp 1
my 1
teeth 1
together 1
as 1
she 1
teasingly 1
traces 1
the 1
outline 1
of 1
my 1
lips 1
with 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
the 1
blade 1
i 1
wont 1
close 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
comment 1
about 1
rue 1
has 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
fury 1
enough 1
fury 1
i 1
think 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
some 1
dignity 1
as 1
my 1
last 1
act 1
of 1
defiance 1
i 1
will 1
stare 1
her 1
down 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
which 1
will 1
probably 1
not 1
be 1
an 1
extended 1
period 1
of 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
stare 1
her 1
down 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
cry 1
out 1
i 1
will 1
die 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
small 1
way 1
undefeated 1
yes 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
youll 1
have 1
much 1
use 1
for 1
your 1
lips 1
anymore 1
want 1
to 1
blow 1
lover 1
boy 1
one 1
last 1
kiss 1
she 1
asks 1
i 1
work 1
up 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
blood 1
and 1
saliva 1
and 1
spit 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
she 1
flushes 1
with 1
rage 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
lets 1
get 1
started 1
i 1
brace 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
agony 1
thats 1
sure 1
to 1
follow 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
tip 1
open 1
the 1
first 1
cut 1
at 1
my 1
lip 1
some 1
great 1
form 1
yanks 1
clove 1
from 1
my 1
body 1
and 1
then 1
shes 1
screaming 1
im 1
too 1
stunned 1
at 1
first 1
too 1
unable 1
to 1
process 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
has 1
peeta 1
somehow 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
rescue 1
have 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
sent 1
in 1
some 1
wild 1
animal 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
fun 1
has 1
a 1
hovercraft 1
inexplicably 1
plucked 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
push 1
myself 1
up 1
on 1
my 1
numb 1
arms 1
i 1
see 1
its 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
above 1
clove 1
is 1
dangling 1
a 1
foot 1
off 1
the 1
ground 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
threshs 1
arms 1
i 1
let 1
out 1
a 1
gasp 1
seeing 1
him 1
like 1
that 1
towering 1
over 1
me 1
holding 1
clove 1
like 1
a 1
rag 1
doll 1
i 1
remember 1
him 1
as 1
big 1
but 1
he 1
seems 1
more 1
massive 1
more 1
powerful 1
than 1
i 1
even 1
recall 1
if 1
anything 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
gained 1
weight 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
he 1
flips 1
clove 1
around 1
and 1
flings 1
her 1
onto 1
the 1
ground 1
when 1
he 1
shouts 1
i 1
jump 1
never 1
having 1
heard 1
him 1
speak 1
above 1
a 1
mutter 1
whatd 1

do 1
to 1
that 1
little 1
girl 1

her 1
clove 1
is 1
scrambling 1
backward 1
on 1
all 1
fours 1
like 1
a 1
frantic 1
insect 1
too 1
shocked 1
to 1
even 1
call 1

another 1
thought 1
brings 1
a 1
fresh 1
wave 1
of 1
rage 1
to 1
his 1
features 1
you 1
cut 1
her 1
up 1
like 1

of 1
her 1
chest 1
the 1
low 1
moan 1
escaping 1

the 1
rock 1

glare 1
of 1

strange 1
golden 1
brown 1
eyes 1
whatd 1

and 1
you 1

her 1
in 1
flowers 1
i 1
say 1
and 1
i 1
sang 1
her 1
to 1
sleep 1
tears 1
spring 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
tension 1
the 1
fight 1
goes 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
memory 1
and 1
im 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
rue 1
and 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
my 1
fear 1
of 1
thresh 1
and 1
the 1
moaning 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
girl 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
away 1
to 1
sleep 1

for 1
an 1
arrow 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
ill 1
never 1
reach 1
just 1
to 1
wipe 1
my 1
nose 1
do 1
it 1
fast 1
okay 1
thresh 1
conflicting 1
emotions 1
cross 1
threshs 1
face 1
he 1
lowers 1
the 1
rock 1
and 1
points 1
at 1
me 1
almost 1
accusingly 1
just 1
this 1
one 1
time 1
i 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
little 1

already 1
broken 1
all 1

is 1
breaking 1
the 1
rules 1
to 1
thank 1
me 1
too 1
and 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1

not 1
going 1
to 1
smash 1
in 1
my 1
skull 1
clove 1
catos 1
voice 1
is 1
much 1
nearer 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
sees 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1

my 1
feet 1

into 1
the 1
hardpacked 1
earth 1
as 1
i 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
thresh 1
and 1
clove 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1

voice 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
reach 1
the 1
woods 1
do 1
i 1
turn 1
back 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1

and 1
both 1
large 1
backpacks 1

vanishing 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
plain 1
into 1
the 1
area 1
ive 1
never 1

begging 1
her 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
will 1
realize 1
its 1
futile 1
she 1
cant 1
be 1
saved 1
i 1
crash 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
repeatedly 1
swiping 1
away 1
the 1
blood 1
thats 1
pouring 1
into 1
my 1
eye 1
fleeing 1
like 1

the 1
ground 1
one 1
slim 1
box 1
containing 1
one 1
hypodermic 1
needle 1
without 1
hesitating 1
i 1
jam 1
the 1
needle 1
into 1
peetas 1

down 1
on 1
the 1
plunger 1
my 1
hands 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
drop 1
to 1
my 1
lap 1
slick 1
with 1
blood 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1

remember 1
is 1
an 1
exquisitely 1
beautiful 1
greenandsilver 1
moth 1
landing 1
on 1
the 1
curve 1
of 1
my 1
wrist 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
rain 1
drumming 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
our 1
house 1
gently 1
pulls 1
me 1
toward 1
consciousness 1
i 1
fight 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
sleep 1
though 1

in 1
a 1
warm 1
cocoon 1
of 1
blankets 1
safe 1
at 1
home 1
im 1
vaguely 1
aware 1
that 1
my 1
head 1
aches 1
possibly 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
flu 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
why 1

bed 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
can 1

long 1
time 1
my 1
mothers 1

away 1
as 1
i 1

wakefulness 1

her 1
even 1
though 1
i 1

chilly 1
cave 1

bare 1
feet 1
freezing 1
despite 1
the 1
cover 1
the 1
air 1
tainted 1
with 1
the 1
unmistakable 1
smell 1
of 1
blood 1
the 1
haggard 1
pale 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
boy 1
slides 1
into 1
view 1
and 1
after 1
an 1
initial 1
jolt 1
of 1

my 1
feet 1
and 1

around 1
my 1
chin 1
your 1

and 1
socks 1
are 1
still 1
damp 1
and 1
the 1
weathers 1
not 1
helping 1
much 1
he 1
says 1
theres 1
a 1
clap 1
of 1
thunder 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
lightning 1
electrify 1
the 1
sky 1
through 1
an 1
opening 1
in 1
the 1
rocks 1
rain 1
drips 1
through 1
several 1
holes 1
in 1
the 1
ceiling 1
but 1
peeta 1

built 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
canopy 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
an 1
upper 1
body 1
by 1
wedging 1
the 1
square 1
of 1

you 1
too 1
says 1
peeta 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
feast 1
returns 1
fullforce 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
sick 1
he 1
did 1
but 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
things 1
ive 1
kept 1
to 1
myself 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
sick 1
to 1
ask 1
and 1
i 1
wasnt 1
ready 1
to 1
relive 1
anyway 1
like 1
the 1
explosion 1
and 1
my 1
ear 1
and 1
rues 1
dying 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
all 1
of 1
which 1
leads 1
to 1
what 1
happened 1
with 1
thresh 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
paying 1
off 1
a 1
debt 1
of 1
sorts 1
he 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
because 1
he 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
owe 1
you 1
anything 1
asks 1
peeta 1
in 1
disbelief 1
yes 1
i 1
dont 1
expect 1
you 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
youve 1
always 1
had 1
enough 1
but 1
if 1
youd 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
i 1
say 1
and 1
dont 1
try 1
obviously 1
im 1
too 1
dim 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
its 1
like 1
the 1
bread 1
how 1
i 1
never 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
owing 1
you 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
say 1
the 1
bread 1
what 1
from 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
kids 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
can 1
let 1
that 1
go 1
i 1
mean 1
you 1
just 1
brought 1
me 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
dead 1
but 1
you 1
didnt 1
know 1
me 1
we 1
had 1
never 1
even 1
spoken 1
besides 1
its 1
the 1
first 1
gift 1
thats 1
always 1
the 1
hardest 1
to 1
pay 1
back 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
even 1
have 1
been 1
here 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
hadnt 1
helped 1
me 1
then 1
i 1
say 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
anyway 1
why 1
you 1
know 1
why 1
peeta 1
says 1
i 1
give 1
my 1
head 1
a 1
slight 1
painful 1
shake 1
haymitch 1
said 1
you 1
would 1
take 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
convincing 1
haymitch 1
i 1
ask 1
whats 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
nothing 1
peeta 1
says 1
so 1
cato 1
and 1
thresh 1
huh 1
i 1
guess 1
its 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
hope 1
that 1
theyll 1
simultaneously 1
destroy 1
each 1
other 1
but 1
the 1
thought 1
only 1
upsets 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
would 1
like 1
thresh 1
i 1
think 1
hed 1
be 1
our 1
friend 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
twelve 1
i 1
say 1
then 1
lets 1
hope 1
cato 1
kills 1
him 1
so 1
we 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
says 1
peeta 1
grimly 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
cato 1
to 1
kill 1
thresh 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
anyone 1
else 1
to 1
die 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
absolutely 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
that 1
victors 1
go 1
around 1
saying 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
despite 1
my 1
best 1
efforts 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
tears 1
starting 1
to 1
pool 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
peeta 1
looks 1
at 1
me 1
in 1
concern 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
are 1
you 1
in 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
pain 1
i 1
give 1
him 1
another 1
answer 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
equally 1
true 1
but 1
can 1
be 1
taken 1
as 1
a 1
brief 1
moment 1
of 1
weakness 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
terminal 1
one 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
peeta 1
i 1
say 1
plaintively 1
like 1
a 1
small 1
child 1
you 1
will 1
i 1
promise 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
bends 1
over 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
kiss 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
now 1
i 1
say 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
dream 1
of 1
home 1
and 1
youll 1
be 1
there 1
for 1
real 1
before 1
you 1
know 1
it 1
lie 1
says 1
okay 1
okay 1
i 1
whisper 1
wake 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
need 1
me 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
im 1
good 1
and 1
rested 1
thanks 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
haymitch 1
besides 1
who 1
knows 1
how 1
long 1
this 1
will 1
last 1
he 1
says 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
mean 1
the 1
storm 1
the 1
brief 1
respite 1
ii 1
brings 1
us 1
the 1
games 1
themselves 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
but 1
im 1
ion 1
sad 1
and 1
tired 1
to 1
ask 1
its 1
evening 1
when 1
peeta 1
wakes 1
me 1
again 1
the 1
rain 1
has 1
turned 1
to 1
a 1
downpour 1
sending 1
streams 1
of 1
water 1
through 1
our 1
ceiling 1
where 1
earlier 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
only 1
drips 1
peeta 1
has 1
placed 1
the 1
broth 1
pot 1
under 1
the 1
worst 1
one 1
and 1
repositioned 1
the 1
plastic 1
to 1
deflect 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
bit 1
better 1
able 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
without 1
getting 1
too 1
dizzy 1
and 1
im 1
absolutely 1
famished 1
so 1
is 1
peeta 1
its 1
clear 1
hes 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
wake 1
up 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
is 1
eager 1
to 1
get 1
started 1
theres 1
not 1
much 1
left 1
two 1
pieces 1
of 1
groosling 1
a 1
small 1
mishmash 1
of 1
roots 1
and 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
dried 1
fruit 1

we 1
try 1
and 1
ration 1

no 1
lets 1
just 1
finish 1
it 1
the 1
grooslings 1
getting 1
old 1
anyway 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
we 1
need 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
sick 1
off 1
spoiled 1
food 1
i 1
say 1
dividing 1
the 1
food 1
into 1
two 1
equal 1
piles 1
we 1
try 1
and 1
eat 1
slowly 1
but 1

done 1
in 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
minutes 1

is 1
in 1
no 1
way 1

hunting 1

few 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mouth 1
its 1
hard 1
to 1
even 1
see 1
the 1
projection 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
but 1
its 1
clear 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
more 1
deaths 1
today 1
so 1
cato 1
and 1
thresh 1
havent 1
had 1
it 1
out 1
yet 1
where 1
did 1
thresh 1
go 1
i 1
mean 1
whats 1
on 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
i 1
ask 1
peeta 1
a 1
field 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
its 1
full 1
of 1
grasses 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
my 1
shoulders 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
maybe 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
grain 1
there 1
are 1
patches 1
of 1
different 1
colors 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
paths 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
bet 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
grain 1
i 1
bet 1
thresh 1
knows 1
which 1
ones 1
too 1
i 1
say 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
no 1
nobody 1
really 1
wanted 1
to 1
track 1
thresh 1
down 1
in 1
that 1
grass 1
it 1
has 1
a 1
sinister 1
feeling 1
to 1
it 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
field 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
think 1
of 1
are 1
hidden 1
things 1
snakes 1
and 1
rabid 1
animals 1
and 1
quicksand 1
peeta 1
says 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
anything 1
in 1
there 1
i 1
dont 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
peetas 1
words 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
warnings 1
they 1
give 1
us 1
about 1
not 1
going 1
beyond 1
the 1
fence 1
in 1
district 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
comparing 1
him 1
with 1
gale 1
who 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
field 1
as 1
a 1
potential 1
source 1
of 1
food 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
threat 1
thresh 1
certainly 1
did 1
its 1
not 1
that 1
peetas 1
soft 1
exactly 1
and 1
hes 1
proved 1
hes 1
not 1
a 1
coward 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
things 1
you 1
dont 1
question 1
too 1
much 1
i 1
guess 1
when 1
your 1
home 1
always 1
smells 1
like 1
baking 1
bread 1
whereas 1
gale 1
questions 1
everything 1
what 1
would 1
peeta 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
irreverent 1
banter 1
that 1
passes 1
between 1
us 1
as 1
we 1
break 1
the 1
law 1
each 1
day 1
would 1
it 1
shock 1
him 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
say 1
about 1
panem 1
gales 1
tirades 1
against 1
the 1
capitol 1
maybe 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
bread 1
bush 1
in 1
that 1
field 1
i 1
say 1
maybe 1
thats 1
why 1
thresh 1
looks 1
better 1
fed 1
now 1
than 1
when 1
we 1
started 1
the 1
games 1
either 1
that 1
or 1
hes 1
got 1
very 1
generous 1
sponsors 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
wed 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
get 1
haymitch 1
to 1
send 1
us 1
some 1
bread 1
i 1
raise 1
my 1
eyebrows 1
before 1
i 1
remember 1
he 1
doesnt 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
message 1
haymitch 1
sent 1
us 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
nights 1
ago 1
one 1
kiss 1
equals 1
one 1
pot 1
of 1
broth 1
its 1
not 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
i 1
can 1
blurt 1
out 1
either 1
to 1
say 1
my 1
thoughts 1
aloud 1
would 1
be 1
tipping 1
off 1
the 1
audience 1
that 1
the 1
romance 1
has 1
been 1
fabricated 1
to 1
play 1
on 1
their 1
sympathies 1
and 1
that 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
no 1
food 1
at 1
all 1
somehow 1
believably 1
ive 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
things 1
back 1
on 1
track 1
something 1
simple 1
to 1
start 1
with 1
i 1
reach 1
out 1
and 1
take 1
his 1
hand 1
well 1
he 1
probably 1
used 1
up 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
resources 1
helping 1
me 1
knock 1
you 1
out 1
i 1
say 1
mischievously 1
yeah 1
about 1
that 1
says 1
peeta 1
entwining 1
his 1
fingers 1
in 1
mine 1
dont 1
try 1
something 1
likethat 1
again 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
or 1
or 1
he 1
cant 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
good 1
just 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
minute 1
whats 1
the 1
problem 1
i 1
say 1
with 1
a 1
grin 1
the 1
problem 1
is 1
were 1
both 1
still 1
alive 1
which 1
only 1
reinforces 1
the 1
idea 1
in 1
your 1
mind 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
did 1
do 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
i 1
say 1
no 1
just 1
dont 1
katniss 1
his 1
grip 1
tightens 1
hurting 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
theres 1
real 1
anger 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
dont 1
die 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
wont 1
be 1
doing 1
me 1
any 1
favors 1
all 1
right 1
im 1
startled 1
by 1
his 1
intensity 1
but 1
recognize 1
an 1
excellent 1
opportunity 1
for 1
getting 1
food 1
so 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
maybe 1
i 1
did 1
it 1
for 1
myself 1
peeta 1
did 1
you 1
ever 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
maybe 1
you 1
arent 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
who 1
worries 1
about 1
what 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
like 1
if 1
i 1
fumble 1
im 1
not 1
as 1
smooth 1
with 1
words 1
as 1
peeta 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
talking 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
actually 1
losing 1
peeta 1
hit 1
me 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
realized 1
how 1
much 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
its 1
not 1
about 1
the 1
sponsors 1
and 1
its 1
not 1
about 1
what 1
will 1
happen 1
back 1
home 1
and 1
its 1
not 1
just 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
its 1
him 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
boy 1
with 1
the 1
bread 1
if 1
what 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
softly 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
pull 1
the 1
shutters 1
closed 1
blocking 1
out 1
this 1
moment 1
from 1
the 1
prying 1
eyes 1
of 1
panem 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
means 1
losing 1
food 1
whatever 1
im 1
feeling 1
its 1
no 1
ones 1
business 1
but 1
mine 1
thats 1
exactly 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
topic 1
haymitch 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
steer 1
clear 1
of 1
i 1
say 1
evasively 1
although 1
haymitch 1
never 1
said 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
in 1
fact 1
hes 1
probably 1
cursing 1
me 1
out 1
right 1
now 1
for 1
dropping 1
the 1
ball 1
during 1
such 1
an 1
emotionally 1
charged 1
moment 1
but 1
peeta 1
somehow 1
catches 1
it 1
then 1
ill 1
just 1
have 1
to 1
fill 1
in 1
the 1
blanks 1
myself 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
moves 1
in 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
that 1
were 1
both 1
fully 1
aware 1
of 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
hobbled 1
by 1
sickness 1
or 1
pain 1
or 1
simply 1
unconscious 1
our 1
lips 1
neither 1
burning 1
with 1
fever 1
or 1
icy 1
cold 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
where 1
i 1
actually 1
feel 1
stirring 1
inside 1
my 1
chest 1
warm 1
and 1
curious 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
want 1
another 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
it 1
well 1
i 1
do 1
get 1
a 1
second 1
kiss 1
but 1
its 1
just 1
a 1
light 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
my 1
nose 1
because 1
peetas 1
been 1
distracted 1
i 1
think 1
your 1
wound 1
is 1
bleeding 1
again 1
come 1
on 1
lie 1
down 1
its 1
bedtime 1
anyway 1
he 1
says 1
my 1
socks 1
are 1
dry 1
enough 1
to 1
wear 1
now 1
i 1
make 1
peeta 1
put 1
his 1
jacket 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
damp 1
cold 1
seems 1
to 1
cut 1
right 1
down 1
to 1
my 1
bones 1
so 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
half 1
frozen 1
i 1
insist 1
on 1
taking 1
the 1
first 1
watch 1
too 1
although 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
think 1
its 1
likely 1
anyone 1
will 1
come 1
in 1
this 1
weather 1
but 1
he 1
wont 1
agree 1
unless 1
im 1
in 1
the 1
bag 1
too 1
and 1
im 1
shivering 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
its 1
pointless 1
to 1
object 1
in 1
stark 1
contrast 1
to 1
two 1
nights 1
ago 1
when 1
i 1
felt 1
peeta 1
was 1
a 1
million 1
miles 1
away 1
im 1
struck 1
by 1
his 1
immediacy 1
now 1
as 1
we 1
settle 1
in 1
he 1
pulls 1
my 1
head 1
down 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
arm 1
as 1
a 1
pillow 1
the 1
other 1
restsprotectively 1
over 1
me 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
goes 1
to 1
sleep 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
held 1
me 1
like 1
this 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
since 1
my 1
father 1
died 1
and 1
i 1
stopped 1
trusting 1
my 1
mother 1
no 1
one 1
elses 1
arms 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
this 1
safe 1
with 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
glasses 1
i 1
lie 1
watching 1
the 1
drips 1
of 1
water 1
splatter 1
on 1
the 1
cave 1
floor 1
rhythmic 1
and 1
lulling 1
several 1
times 1
i 1
drift 1
off 1
briefly 1
and 1
then 1
snap 1
awake 1
guilty 1
and 1
angry 1
with 1
myself 1
after 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
hours 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
it 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
rouse 1
peeta 1
because 1
i 1
cant 1
keep 1
my 1
eyes 1
open 1
he 1
doesnt 1
seem 1
to 1
mind 1
tomorrow 1
when 1
its 1
dry 1
ill 1
find 1
us 1
a 1
place 1
so 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
we 1
can 1
both 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
i 1
promise 1
as 1
i 1
drift 1
off 1
but 1
tomorrow 1
is 1
no 1
better 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
weather 1
the 1
deluge 1
continues 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
are 1
intent 1
on 1
washing 1
us 1
all 1
away 1
the 1
thunders 1
so 1
powerful 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
shake 1
the 1
ground 1
peetas 1
considering 1
heading 1
out 1
anyway 1
to 1
scavenge 1
for 1
food 1
but 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
in 1
this 1
storm 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
pointless 1
he 1
wont 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
three 1
feet 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
hell 1
only 1
end 1
up 1
getting 1
soaked 1
to 1
the 1
skin 1
for 1
his 1
troubles 1
he 1
knows 1
im 1
right 1
but 1
the 1
gnawing 1
in 1
our 1
stomachs 1
is 1
becoming 1
painful 1
the 1
day 1
drags 1
on 1
turning 1
into 1
evening 1
and 1
theres 1
no 1
break 1
in 1
the 1
weather 1
haymitch 1
is 1
our 1
only 1
hope 1
but 1
nothing 1
is 1
forthcoming 1
either 1
from 1
lack 1
of 1
money 1
everything 1
will 1
cost 1
an 1
exorbitant 1
amount 1
or 1
because 1
hes 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
our 1
performance 1
probably 1
the 1
latter 1
id 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
admit 1
were 1
not 1
exactly 1
riveting 1
today 1
starving 1
weak 1
from 1
injuries 1
trying 1
not 1
to 1
reopen 1
wounds 1
were 1
sitting 1
huddled 1
together 1
wrapped 1
in 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
yes 1
but 1
mostly 1
to 1
keep 1
warm 1
the 1
most 1
exciting 1
thing 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
does 1
is 1
nap 1
im 1
not 1
really 1
sure 1
how 1
to 1
ramp 1
up 1
the 1
romance 1
the 1
kiss 1
last 1
night 1
was 1
nice 1
but 1
working 1
up 1
to 1
another 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
forethought 1
there 1
are 1
girls 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
merchant 1
girls 1
too 1
who 1
navigate 1
these 1
waters 1
so 1
easily 1
but 1
ive 1
never 1
had 1
much 1
time 1
or 1
use 1
for 1
it 1
anyway 1
just 1
a 1
kiss 1
isnt 1
enough 1
anymore 1
clearly 1
because 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
wed 1
have 1
gotten 1
food 1
last 1
night 1
my 1
instincts 1
tell 1
me 1
haymitch 1
isnt 1
just 1
looking 1
for 1
physical 1
affection 1
he 1
wants 1
something 1
more 1
personal 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
stuff 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
about 1
myself 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
practicing 1
for 1
the 1
interview 1
im 1
rotten 1
at 1
it 1
but 1
peetas 1
not 1
maybe 1
the 1
best 1
approach 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
talking 1
peeta 1
i 1
say 1
lightly 1
you 1
said 1
at 1
the 1
interview 1
youd 1
had 1
a 1
crush 1
on 1
me 1
forever 1
when 1
did 1
forever 1
start 1
oh 1
lets 1
see 1
i 1
guess 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
school 1
we 1
were 1
five 1
you 1
had 1
on 1
a 1
red 1
plaid 1
dress 1
and 1
your 1
hair 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
two 1
braids 1
instead 1
of 1
one 1
my 1
father 1
pointed 1
you 1
out 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
waiting 1
to 1
line 1
up 1
peeta 1
says 1
your 1
father 1
why 1
i 1
ask 1
he 1
said 1
see 1
that 1
little 1
girl 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
marry 1
her 1
mother 1
but 1
she 1
ran 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
coal 1
miner 1
peeta 1
says 1
what 1
youre 1
making 1
that 1
up 1
i 1
exclaim 1
no 1
true 1
story 1
peeta 1
says 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
a 1
coal 1
miner 1
why 1
did 1
she 1
want 1
a 1
coal 1
miner 1
if 1
she 1
couldve 1
had 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
when 1
he 1
sings 1
even 1
the 1
birds 1
stop 1
to 1
listen 1
thats 1
true 1
they 1
do 1
i 1
mean 1
they 1
did 1
i 1
say 1
im 1
stunned 1
and 1
surprisingly 1
moved 1
thinking 1
of 1
the 1
baker 1
telling 1
this 1
to 1
peeta 1
it 1
strikes 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
reluctance 1
to 1
sing 1
my 1
own 1
dismissal 1
of 1
music 1
might 1
not 1
really 1
be 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
time 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
because 1
it 1
reminds 1
me 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
so 1
that 1
day 1
in 1
music 1
assembly 1
the 1
teacher 1
asked 1
who 1
knew 1
the 1
valley 1
song 1
your 1
hand 1
shot 1
right 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
she 1
stood 1
you 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
stool 1
and 1
had 1
you 1
sing 1
it 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
swear 1
every 1
bird 1
outside 1
the 1
windows 1
fell 1
silent 1
peeta 1
says 1
oh 1
please 1
i 1
say 1
laughing 1
no 1
it 1
happened 1
and 1
right 1
when 1
your 1
song 1
ended 1
i 1
knew 1
just 1
like 1
your 1
mother 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
goner 1
peeta 1
says 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
eleven 1
years 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
work 1
up 1
the 1
nerve 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
without 1
success 1
i 1
add 1
without 1
success 1
so 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
my 1
name 1
being 1
drawn 1
in 1
the 1
reaping 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
piece 1
of 1
luck 1
says 1
peeta 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
im 1
almost 1
foolishly 1
happy 1
and 1
then 1
confusion 1
sweeps 1
over 1
me 1
because 1
were 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
making 1
up 1
this 1
stuff 1
playing 1
at 1
being 1
in 1
love 1
not 1
actually 1
being 1
in 1
love 1
but 1
peetas 1
story 1
has 1
a 1
ring 1
of 1
truth 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
part 1
about 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
sing 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
school 1
although 1
i 1
dont 1
remember 1
the 1
song 1
and 1
that 1
red 1
plaid 1
dress 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
a 1
handmedown 1
to 1
prim 1
that 1
got 1
washed 1
to 1
rags 1
after 1
my 1
fathers 1
death 1
it 1
would 1
explain 1
another 1
thing 1
too 1
why 1
peeta 1
took 1
a 1
beating 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
bread 1
on 1
that 1
awful 1
hollow 1
day 1
so 1
if 1
those 1
details 1
are 1
true 1
could 1
it 1
all 1
be 1
true 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
remarkable 1
memory 1
i 1
say 1
haltingly 1
i 1
remember 1
everything 1
about 1
you 1
says 1
peeta 1
tucking 1
a 1
loose 1
strand 1
of 1
hair 1
behind 1
my 1
ear 1
youre 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
wasnt 1
paying 1
attention 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
i 1
say 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
much 1
competition 1
here 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
draw 1
away 1
to 1
close 1
those 1
shutters 1
again 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
cant 1
its 1
as 1
if 1
i 1

hear 1
haymitch 1
whispering 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
say 1
it 1
say 1
it 1
i 1
swallow 1
hard 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
words 1
out 1
you 1
dont 1
have 1
much 1
competition 1
anywhere 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
its 1
me 1
who 1
leans 1
in 1
our 1
lips 1
have 1
just 1
barely 1
touched 1
when 1
the 1
clunk 1
outside 1
makes 1
us 1
jump 1
my 1
bow 1
comes 1
up 1
the 1
arrow 1
readyto 1
fly 1
but 1
theres 1
no 1
other 1
sound 1
peeta 1
peers 1
through 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
then 1
gives 1
a 1
whoop 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
stop 1
him 1
lies 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
rain 1
then 1
handing 1
something 1
in 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
silver 1
parachute 1
attached 1
to 1
a 1
basket 1
i 1
rip 1
it 1
open 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
inside 1
theres 1
a 1
feast 1
fresh 1
rolls 1
goat 1
cheese 1
apples 1
and 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
a 1
tureen 1
of 1
that 1
incredible 1
lamb 1
stew 1
on 1
wild 1
rice 1
the 1
very 1
dish 1
i 1
told 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1

the 1
most 1
impressive 1
thing 1
the 1
capitol 1
had 1
to 1
offer 1
peeta 1
wriggles 1
back 1
inside 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
i 1
guess 1
haymitch 1
finally 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
watching 1
us 1
starve 1
i 1
guess 1
so 1
i 1
answer 1
but 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
haymitchs 1
smug 1
if 1
slightly 1
exasperated 1
words 1
yes 1

looking 1
lot 1
sweetheart 1

cell 1
in 1
my 1
body 1
wants 1
me 1
to 1
dig 1
into 1
the 1
stew 1
and 1
cram 1
it 1
handful 1
by 1
handful 1
into 1
my 1
mouth 1
but 1
peetas 1
voice 1
stops 1
me 1
we 1
better 1
take 1
it 1
slow 1
on 1
that 1
stew 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
on 1
the 1
train 1
the 1
rich 1
food 1
made 1
me 1
sick 1
and 1
i 1
wasnt 1
even 1
starving 1
then 1
youre 1
right 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
just 1
inhale 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
i 1
say 1
regretfully 1
but 1
i 1

an 1
apple 1
and 1
an 1
eggsize 1
serving 1
of 1
stew 1
and 1

silverware 1
and 1
plates 1
savoring 1
each 1

stare 1
longingly 1
at 1
the 1
dish 1
i 1
want 1

general 1
are 1
his 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
audience 1
will 1
enjoy 1
our 1
having 1
fun 1
at 1
haymitchs 1
expense 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
around 1
so 1
long 1
hes 1
practically 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
after 1
his 1
headdive 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
at 1
the 1
reaping 1
everybody 1
knows 1
him 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
theyll 1
have 1
dragged 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
control 1
room 1
for 1
interviews 1
about 1
us 1
no 1
telling 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
lies 1
hes 1
made 1
up 1
hes 1
at 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
disadvantage 1
because 1
most 1
mentors 1
have 1
a 1
partner 1
another 1
victor 1
to 1
help 1
them 1
whereas 1
haymitch 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
action 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
kind 1
of 1
like 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
hes 1
holding 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
drinking 1
the 1
attention 1
and 1
the 1
stress 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
keep 1
us 1
alive 1
its 1
funny 1
haymitch 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
get 1
along 1
well 1
in 1
person 1
but 1
maybe 1
peeta 1
is 1
right 1
about 1
us 1
being 1
alike 1
because 1
he 1
seems 1
able 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
timing 1
of 1
his 1
gifts 1
like 1
how 1
i 1
knew 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
close 1
to 1
water 1
when 1
he 1
withheld 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
sleep 1
syrup 1
just 1
wasnt 1
something 1
to 1
ease 1
peetas 1
pain 1
and 1
how 1
i 1
know 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
play 1
up 1
the 1
romance 1
he 1
hasnt 1
made 1
much 1
effort 1
to 1
connect 1
with 1
peeta 1
really 1
perhaps 1
he 1
thinks 1
a 1
bowl 1
of 1
broth 1
would 1
just 1
be 1
a 1
bowl 1
of 1
broth 1
to 1
peeta 1
whereas 1
ill 1
see 1
the 1
strings 1
attached 1
to 1
it 1
a 1
thought 1
hits 1
me 1
and 1
im 1
amazed 1
the 1
questions 1
taken 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
surface 1
maybe 1
its 1
because 1
ive 1
only 1
recently 1
begun 1
to 1
view 1
haymitch 1
with 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
curiosity 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
who 1
did 1
what 1
peeta 1
asks 1
haymitch 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
he 1
won 1
the 1
games 1
i 1
say 1
peeta 1
considers 1
this 1
quite 1
a 1
while 1
before 1
he 1
answers 1
haymitch 1
is 1
sturdily 1
built 1
but 1
no 1
physical 1
wonder 1
like 1
cato 1
or 1
thresh 1
hes 1
not 1
particularly 1
handsome 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
causes 1
sponsors 1
to 1
rain 1
gifts 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
hes 1
so 1
surly 1
its 1
hard 1
to 1
imagine 1
anyone 1
teaming 1
up 1
with 1
him 1
theres 1
only 1
one 1
way 1
haymitch 1
could 1
have 1
won 1
and 1
peeta 1
says 1
it 1
just 1
as 1
im 1
reaching 1
this 1
conclusion 1
myself 1
he 1
outsmarted 1
the 1
others 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
nod 1
then 1
let 1
the 1
conversation 1
drop 1
but 1
secretly 1
im 1
wondering 1
if 1
haymitch 1
sobered 1
up 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
help 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
because 1
he 1
thought 1
we 1
just 1
might 1
have 1
the 1
wits 1
to 1
survive 1
maybe 1
he 1
wasnt 1
always 1
a 1
drunk 1
maybe 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
tributes 1
but 1
then 1
it 1
got 1
unbearable 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
hell 1
to 1
mentor 1
two 1
kids 1
and 1
then 1
watch 1
them 1
die 1
year 1
after 1
year 1
after 1
year 1
i 1
realize 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
that 1
will 1
become 1
my 1
job 1
to 1
mentor 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
district 1
the 1
idea 1
is 1
so 1
repellent 1
i 1
thrust 1
it 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
has 1
passed 1
before 1
i 1
decide 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
eat 1
again 1
peetas 1
too 1
hungry 1
himself 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
an 1
argument 1
while 1
im 1
dishing 1
up 1
two 1
more 1
small 1
servings 1
of 1
lamb 1
stew 1
and 1
rice 1
we 1
hear 1
the 1
anthem 1
begin 1
to 1
play 1
peeta 1
presses 1
his 1
eyes 1
against 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
rocks 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
sky 1
there 1
wont 1
be 1
anything 1
to 1
see 1
tonight 1
i 1
say 1
far 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
stew 1
than 1
the 1
sky 1
nothings 1
happened 1
or 1
we 1
wouldve 1
heard 1
a 1
cannon 1
katniss 1
peeta 1
says 1
quietly 1
what 1
should 1
we 1
split 1
another 1
roll 1
too 1
i 1
ask 1
katniss 1
he 1
repeats 1
but 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
wanting 1
to 1
ignore 1
him 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
split 1
one 1
but 1
ill 1
save 1
the 1
cheese 1
for 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
see 1
peeta 1
staring 1
at 1
me 1
what 1
thresh 1
is 1
dead 1
says 1
peeta 1
he 1
cant 1
be 1
i 1
say 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
fired 1
the 1
cannon 1
during 1
the 1
thunder 1
and 1
we 1
missed 1
it 1
says 1
peeta 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
i 1
mean 1
its 1
pouring 1
buckets 1
out 1
there 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
anything 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
push 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
squint 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
rainy 1
sky 1
for 1
about 1
ten 1
seconds 1
i 1
catch 1
a 1
distorted 1
glimpse 1
of 1
threshs 1
picture 1
and 1
then 1
hes 1
gone 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
slump 1
down 1
against 1
the 1
rocks 1
momentarily 1
forgetting 1
about 1
the 1
task 1
at 1
hand 1
thresh 1
dead 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
right 1
one 1
less 1
tribute 1
to 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
powerful 1
one 1
too 1
but 1
im 1
not 1
happy 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
think 1
about 1
is 1
thresh 1
letting 1
me 1
go 1
letting 1
me 1
run 1
because 1
of 1
rue 1
who 1
died 1
with 1
that 1
spear 1
in 1
her 1
stomach 1
you 1
all 1
right 1
asks 1
peeta 1
i 1
give 1
a 1
noncommittal 1
shrug 1
and 1
cup 1
my 1
elbows 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
hugging 1
them 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
body 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
bury 1
the 1
real 1
pain 1
because 1
whos 1
going 1
to 1
bet 1
on 1
a 1
tribute 1
who 1
keeps 1
sniveling 1
over 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
opponents 1
rue 1
was 1
one 1
thing 1
we 1
were 1
allies 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
young 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
understand 1
my 1
sorrow 1
at 1
threshs 1
murder 1
the 1
word 1
pulls 1
me 1
up 1
short 1
murder 1
thankfully 1
i 1
didnt 1
say 1
it 1
aloud 1
thats 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
win 1
me 1
any 1
points 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
what 1
i 1
do 1
say 1
is 1
its 1
just 1
if 1
we 1
didnt 1
win 1
i 1
wanted 1
thresh 1
to 1
because 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
because 1
of 1
rue 1
yeah 1
i 1
know 1
says 1
peeta 1
but 1
this 1
means 1
were 1
one 1
step 1
closer 1
to 1
district 1
twelve 1
he 1
nudges 1
a 1
plate 1
of 1
foot 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
eat 1
its 1
still 1
warm 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
bite 1
of 1
the 1
stew 1
to 1
show 1
i 1
dont 1
really 1
care 1
but 1
its 1
like 1
glue 1
in 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
effort 1
to 1
swallow 1
it 1
also 1
means 1
cato 1
will 1
be 1
back 1
hunting 1
us 1
and 1
hes 1
got 1
supplies 1
again 1
says 1
peeta 1
hell 1
be 1
wounded 1
i 1
bet 1
i 1
say 1
what 1
makes 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
peeta 1
asks 1
because 1
thresh 1
would 1
have 1
never 1
gone 1
down 1
without 1
a 1
fight 1
hes 1
so 1
strong 1
i 1
mean 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
his 1
territory 1
i 1
say 1
good 1
says 1
peeta 1
the 1
more 1
wounded 1
cato 1
is 1
the 1
better 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
foxface 1
is 1
making 1
out 1
oh 1
shes 1
fine 1
i 1
say 1
peevishly 1
im 1
still 1
angry 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
hiding 1
in 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
and 1
i 1
didnt 1
probably 1
be 1
easier 1
to 1
catch 1
cato 1
than 1
her 1
maybe 1
theyll 1
catch 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
just 1
go 1
home 1
says 1
peeta 1
but 1
we 1
better 1
be 1
extra 1
careful 1
about 1
the 1
watches 1
i 1
dozed 1
off 1
a 1
few 1
times 1
me 1
too 1
i 1
admit 1
but 1
not 1
tonight 1
we 1
finish 1
our 1
food 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
then 1
peeta 1
offers 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
first 1
watch 1
i 1
burrow 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
next 1
to 1
him 1
pulling 1
my 1
hood 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
face 1
to 1
hide 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
cameras 1
i 1
just 1
need 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
of 1
privacy 1
where 1
i 1
can 1
let 1
any 1
emotion 1
cross 1
my 1
face 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
under 1
the 1
hood 1
i 1
silently 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
thresh 1
and 1
thank 1
him 1
for 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
promise 1
to 1
remember 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
something 1
to 1
help 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
rues 1
if 1
i 1
win 1
then 1
i 1
escape 1
into 1
sleep 1
comforted 1
by 1
a 1
full 1
belly 1
and 1
the 1
steady 1
warmth 1
of 1
peeta 1
beside 1
me 1
when 1
peeta 1
wakes 1
me 1
later 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
i 1
register 1
is 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
goat 1
cheese 1
hes 1
holding 1
out 1
half 1
a 1
roll 1
spread 1
with 1
the 1
creamy 1
white 1
stuff 1
and 1
topped 1
with 1
apple 1
slices 1
dont 1
be 1
mad 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
eat 1
again 1
heres 1
your 1
half 1
oh 1
good 1
i 1
say 1
immediately 1
taking 1
a 1
huge 1
bite 1
the 1
strong 1
fatty 1
cheese 1
tastes 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
kind 1
prim 1
makes 1
the 1
apples 1
are 1
sweet 1
and 1
crunchy 1
mm 1
we 1
make 1
a 1
goat 1
cheese 1
and 1
apple 1
tart 1
at 1
the 1
bakery 1
he 1
says 1
bet 1
thats 1
expensive 1
i 1
say 1
too 1
expensive 1
for 1
my 1
family 1
to 1
eat 1
unless 1
its 1
gone 1
very 1
stale 1
of 1
course 1
practically 1
everything 1
we 1
eat 1
is 1
stale 1
says 1
peeta 1
pulling 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
up 1
around 1
him 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
minute 1
hes 1
snoring 1
huh 1
i 1
always 1
assumed 1
the 1
shopkeepers 1
live 1
a 1
soft 1
life 1
and 1
its 1
true 1
peeta 1
has 1
always 1
had 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
theres 1
something 1
kind 1
of 1
depressing 1
about 1
living 1
your 1
life 1
on 1
stale 1
bread 1
the 1
hard 1
dry 1
loaves 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
wanted 1
one 1
thing 1
about 1
us 1
since 1
i 1
bring 1
our 1
food 1
home 1
on 1
a 1
daily 1
basis 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
fresh 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
it 1
isnt 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
run 1
for 1
it 1
somewhere 1
during 1
my 1
shift 1
the 1
rain 1
stops 1
not 1
gradually 1
but 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
downpour 1
ends 1
and 1
theres 1
only 1
the 1
residual 1
drippings 1
of 1
water 1
from 1
branches 1
the 1
rush 1
of 1
the 1
now 1
overflowing 1
stream 1
below 1
us 1
a 1
full 1
beautiful 1
moon 1
emerges 1
and 1
even 1
without 1
the 1
glasses 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
outside 1
i 1
cant 1
decide 1
if 1
the 1
moon 1
is 1
real 1
or 1
merely 1
a 1
projection 1
of 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
shortly 1
before 1
i 1
left 1
home 1
gale 1
and 1
i 1
watched 1
it 1
rise 1
as 1
we 1
hunted 1
into 1
the 1
late 1
hours 1
how 1
long 1
have 1
i 1
been 1
gone 1
im 1
guessing 1
its 1
been 1
about 1
two 1
weeks 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
that 1
week 1
of 1
preparation 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
maybe 1
the 1
moon 1
has 1
completed 1
its 1
cycle 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
i 1
badly 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
moon 1
the 1
same 1
one 1
i 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
around 1
district 1
that 1
would 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
cling 1
to 1
in 1
the 1
surreal 1
world 1
of 1
the 1
arena 1
where 1
the 1
authenticity 1
of 1
everything 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
doubted 1
four 1
of 1
us 1
left 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
allow 1
myself 1
to 1
truly 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
possibility 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
make 1
it 1
home 1
to 1
fame 1
to 1
wealth 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
victors 1
village 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
would 1
live 1
there 1
with 1
me 1
no 1
more 1
fear 1
of 1
hunger 1
a 1
new 1
kind 1
of 1
freedom 1
but 1
then 1
what 1
what 1
would 1
my 1
life 1
be 1
like 1
on 1
a 1
daily 1
basis 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
consumed 1
with 1
the 1
acquisition 1
of 1
food 1
take 1
that 1
away 1
and 1
im 1
not 1
really 1
sure 1
who 1
i 1
am 1
what 1
my 1
identity 1
is 1
the 1
idea 1
scares 1
me 1
some 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
haymitch 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
money 1
what 1
did 1
his 1
life 1
become 1
he 1
lives 1
alone 1
no 1
wife 1
or 1
children 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
waking 1
hours 1
drunk 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
end 1
up 1
like 1
that 1
but 1
you 1
wont 1
be 1
alone 1
i 1
whisper 1
to 1
myself 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
then 1
when 1
prim 1
has 1
grown 1
up 1
my 1
mother 1
passed 1
away 1
i 1
know 1
ill 1
never 1
marry 1
never 1
risk 1
bringing 1
a 1
child 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
because 1
if 1
theres 1
one 1
thing 1
being 1
a 1
victor 1
doesnt 1
guarantee 1
its 1
your 1
childrens 1
safety 1
my 1
kids 1
names 1
would 1
go 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
reaping 1
balls 1
with 1
everyone 1
elses 1
and 1
i 1
swear 1
ill 1
never 1
let 1
that 1
happen 1
the 1
sun 1
eventually 1
rises 1
its 1
light 1
slipping 1
through 1
the 1
cracks 1
and 1
illuminating 1
peetas 1
face 1
who 1
will 1
he 1
transform 1
into 1
if 1
we 1
make 1
it 1
home 1
this 1
perplexing 1
goodnatured 1
boy 1
who 1
can 1
spin 1
out 1
lies 1
so 1
convincingly 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
panem 1
believes 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
hopelessly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
ill 1
admit 1
it 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
he 1
makes 1
me 1
believe 1
it 1
myself 1
at 1
least 1
well 1
be 1
friends 1
i 1
think 1
nothing 1
will 1
change 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
weve 1
saved 1
each 1
others 1
lives 1
in 1
here 1
and 1
beyond 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
the 1
boy 1
with 1
the 1
bread 1
good 1
friends 1
anything 1
beyond 1
that 1
though 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
gales 1
gray 1
eyes 1
watching 1
me 1
watching 1
peeta 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
from 1
district 1
discomfort 1
causes 1
me 1
to 1
move 1
i 1
scoot 1
over 1
and 1
shake 1
peetas 1
shoulder 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
sleepily 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
focus 1
on 1
me 1
he 1
pulls 1
me 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
kiss 1

surprised 1
when 1
i 1

stew 1
and 1
rice 1

abandon 1
my 1
fork 1
and 1

last 1
dabs 1
of 1

with 1
my 1
finger 1

peeta 1
he 1
tosses 1

fork 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
literally 1
licks 1
his 1
plate 1
clean 1
with 1
his 1
tongue 1
making 1
loud 1
satisfied 1
sounds 1
then 1
he 1
blows 1
a 1
kiss 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
in 1
general 1
and 1
calls 1

exasperation 1

packed 1
up 1
and 1
standing 1
outside 1
our 1
cave 1
our 1
mood 1
shifts 1
to 1
serious 1
its 1
as 1
though 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
sheltered 1
by 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
catos 1
preoccupation 1
with 1
thresh 1
we 1
were 1
given 1
a 1
respite 1
a 1
holiday 1
of 1
sorts 1
now 1
although 1
the 1
day 1
is 1
sunny 1
and 1
warm 1
we 1
both 1
sense 1
were 1
really 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
games 1

knife 1
since 1
whatever 1
weapons 1
he 1
once 1

long 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
slips 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
belt 1
my 1
last 1
seven 1
arrows 1
of 1
the 1
twelve 1
i 1
sacrificed 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
explosion 1
two 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
rattle 1
a 1
bit 1
too 1
loosely 1
in 1
the 1
quiver 1
i 1
cant 1
afford 1
to 1
lose 1
any 1
more 1
hell 1
be 1
hunting 1
us 1
by 1
now 1
says 1
peeta 1
cato 1
isnt 1
one 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
his 1
prey 1
to 1
wander 1
by 1
if 1
hes 1
wounded 1
i 1
begin 1
it 1
wont 1
matterpeeta 1
breaks 1
in 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
move 1
hes 1
coming 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
rain 1
the 1
stream 1
has 1
overrun 1
its 1
banks 1
by 1
several 1
feet 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
we 1
stop 1
there 1
to 1
replenish 1
our 1
water 1
i 1
check 1
the 1
snares 1
i 1
set 1
days 1
ago 1
and 1
come 1
up 1
empty 1
not 1
surprising 1
with 1
the 1
weather 1
besides 1
i 1
havent 1
seen 1
many 1
animals 1
or 1
signs 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
this 1
area 1
if 1
we 1
want 1
food 1
we 1
better 1
head 1
back 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
hunting 1
grounds 1
i 1
say 1
your 1
call 1
just 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
need 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
peeta 1
says 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
out 1
i 1
say 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
rocks 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
no 1
sense 1
in 1
leaving 1
him 1
tracks 1
to 1
follow 1
and 1
listen 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
its 1
clear 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
that 1
the 1
explosion 1
destroyed 1
the 1
hearing 1
in 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
for 1
good 1
id 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
cover 1
our 1
tracks 1
completely 1
but 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
peetas 1
leg 1
could 1
take 1
the 1
current 1
although 1
the 1
drugs 1
have 1
erased 1
the 1
infection 1
hes 1
still 1
pretty 1
weak 1
my 1
forehead 1
hurts 1
along 1
the 1
knife 1
cut 1
but 1
after 1
three 1
days 1
the 1
bleeding 1
has 1
stopped 1
i 1
wear 1
a 1
bandage 1
around 1
my 1
head 1
though 1
just 1
in 1
case 1
physical 1
exertion 1
should 1
bring 1
it 1
back 1
as 1
we 1
head 1
up 1
alongside 1
the 1
stream 1
we 1
pass 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
found 1
peeta 1
camouflaged 1
in 1
the 1
weeds 1
and 1
mud 1
one 1
good 1
thing 1
between 1
the 1
downpour 1
and 1
the 1
flooded 1
banks 1
all 1
signs 1
of 1
his 1
hiding 1
place 1
have 1
been 1
wiped 1
out 1
that 1
means 1
that 1
if 1
need 1
be 1
we 1
can 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
cave 1
otherwise 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
risk 1
it 1
with 1
cato 1
after 1
us 1
the 1
boulders 1
diminish 1
to 1
rocks 1
that 1
eventually 1
turn 1
to 1
pebbles 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
my 1
relief 1
were 1
back 1
on 1
pine 1
needles 1
and 1
the 1
gentle 1
incline 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
floor 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
realize 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
problem 1
navigating 1
the 1
rocky 1
terrain 1
with 1
a 1
bad 1
leg 1
well 1
youre 1
naturally 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
noise 1
but 1
even 1
on 1
the 1
smooth 1
bed 1
of 1
needles 1
peeta 1
is 1
loud 1
and 1
i 1
mean 1
loud 1
loud 1
as 1
if 1
hes 1
stomping 1
his 1
feet 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
turn 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
asks 1
youve 1
got 1
to 1
move 1
more 1
quietly 1
i 1
say 1
forget 1
about 1
cato 1
youre 1
chasing 1
off 1
every 1
rabbit 1
in 1
a 1
tenmile 1
radius 1
really 1
he 1
says 1
sorry 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
so 1
we 1
start 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
hes 1
a 1
tiny 1
bit 1
better 1
but 1
even 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
working 1
ear 1
hes 1
making 1
me 1
jump 1
can 1
you 1
take 1
your 1
boots 1
off 1
i 1
suggest 1
here 1
he 1
asks 1
in 1
disbelief 1
as 1
if 1
id 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
walk 1
barefoot 1
on 1
hot 1
coals 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
remind 1
myself 1
that 1
hes 1
still 1
not 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
its 1
the 1
scary 1
forbidden 1
place 1
beyond 1
the 1
fences 1
of 1
district 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
gale 1
with 1
his 1
velvet 1
tread 1
its 1
eerie 1
how 1
little 1
sound 1
he 1
makes 1
even 1
when 1
the 1
leaves 1
have 1
fallen 1
and 1
its 1
a 1
challenge 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
without 1
chasing 1
off 1
the 1
game 1
i 1
feel 1
certain 1
hes 1
laughing 1
back 1
home 1
yes 1
i 1
say 1
patiently 1
i 1
will 1
too 1
that 1
way 1
well 1
both 1
be 1
quieter 1
like 1
i 1
was 1
making 1
any 1
noise 1
so 1
we 1
both 1
strip 1
off 1
our 1
boots 1
and 1
socks 1
and 1
while 1
theres 1
some 1
improvement 1
i 1
could 1
swear 1
hes 1
making 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
snap 1
every 1
branch 1
we 1
encounter 1
needless 1
to 1
say 1
although 1
it 1
takes 1
several 1
hours 1
to 1
reach 1
my 1
old 1
camp 1
with 1
rue 1
ive 1
shot 1
nothing 1
if 1
the 1
stream 1
would 1
settle 1
down 1
fish 1
might 1
be 1
an 1
option 1
but 1
the 1
current 1
is 1
still 1
too 1
strong 1
as 1
we 1
stop 1
to 1
rest 1
and 1
drink 1
water 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
a 1
solution 1
ideally 1
id 1
dump 1
peeta 1
now 1
with 1
some 1
simple 1
rootgathering 1
chore 1
and 1
go 1
hunt 1
but 1
then 1
hed 1
be 1
left 1
with 1
only 1
a 1
knife 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
against 1
catos 1
spears 1
and 1
superior 1
strength 1
so 1
what 1
id 1
really 1
like 1
is 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
conceal 1
him 1
somewhere 1
safe 1
then 1
go 1
hunt 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
collect 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
feeling 1
his 1
ego 1
isnt 1
going 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
that 1
suggestion 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
we 1
need 1
to 1
split 1
up 1
i 1
know 1
im 1
chasing 1
away 1
the 1
game 1
only 1
because 1
your 1
legs 1
hurt 1
i 1
say 1
generously 1
because 1
really 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
thats 1
only 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
problem 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
says 1
so 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
go 1
on 1
show 1
me 1
some 1
plants 1
to 1
gather 1
and 1
that 1
way 1
well 1
both 1
be 1
useful 1
not 1
if 1
cato 1
comes 1
and 1
kills 1
you 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
nice 1
way 1
but 1
it 1
still 1
sounds 1
like 1
i 1
think 1
hes 1
a 1
weakling 1
surprisingly 1
he 1
just 1
laughs 1
look 1
i 1
can 1
handle 1
cato 1
i 1
fought 1
him 1
before 1
didnt 1
i 1
yeah 1
and 1
that 1
turned 1
out 1
great 1
you 1
ended 1
up 1
dying 1
in 1
a 1
mud 1
bank 1
thats 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
say 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
he 1
did 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
by 1
taking 1
on 1
cato 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
try 1
another 1
tactic 1
what 1
if 1
you 1
climbed 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
lookout 1
while 1
i 1
hunted 1
i 1
say 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
sound 1
like 1
very 1
important 1
work 1
what 1
if 1
you 1
show 1
me 1
whats 1
edible 1
around 1
here 1
and 1
go 1
get 1
us 1
some 1
meat 1
he 1
says 1
mimicking 1
my 1
tone 1
just 1
dont 1
go 1
far 1
in 1
case 1
you 1
need 1
help 1
i 1
sigh 1
and 1
show 1
him 1
some 1
roots 1
to 1
dig 1
we 1
do 1
need 1
food 1
no 1
question 1
one 1
apple 1
two 1
rolls 1
and 1
a 1
blob 1
of 1
cheese 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
plum 1
wont 1
last 1
long 1
ill 1
just 1
go 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
and 1
hope 1
cato 1
is 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
i 1
teach 1
him 1
a 1
bird 1
whistle 1
not 1
a 1
melody 1
like 1
rues 1
but 1
a 1
simple 1
twonote 1
whistle 1
which 1
we 1
can 1
use 1
to 1
communicate 1
that 1
were 1
all 1
right 1
fortunately 1
hes 1
good 1
at 1
this 1
leaving 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
pack 1
i 1
head 1
off 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
im 1
eleven 1
again 1
tethered 1
not 1
to 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
the 1
fence 1
but 1
to 1
peeta 1
allowing 1
myself 1
twenty 1
maybe 1
thirty 1
yards 1
of 1
hunting 1
space 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
though 1
the 1
woods 1
come 1
alive 1
with 1
animal 1
sounds 1
reassured 1
by 1
his 1
periodic 1
whistles 1
i 1
allow 1
myself 1
to 1
drift 1
farther 1
away 1
and 1
soon 1
have 1
two 1
rabbits 1
and 1
a 1
fat 1
squirrel 1
to 1
show 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
decide 1
its 1
enough 1
i 1
can 1
set 1
snares 1
and 1
maybe 1
get 1
some 1
fish 1
with 1
peetas 1
roots 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
enough 1
for 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
travel 1
the 1
short 1
distance 1
back 1
i 1
realize 1
we 1
havent 1
exchanged 1
signals 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
when 1
my 1
whistle 1
receives 1
no 1
response 1
i 1
run 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
i 1
find 1
the 1
pack 1
a 1
neat 1
pile 1
of 1
roots 1
beside 1
it 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
plastic 1
has 1
been 1
laid 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
the 1
sun 1
can 1
reach 1
the 1
single 1
layer 1
of 1
berries 1
that 1
covers 1
it 1
but 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
peeta 1
i 1
call 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
panic 1
peeta 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
rustle 1
of 1
brush 1
and 1
almost 1
send 1
an 1
arrow 1
through 1
him 1
fortunately 1
i 1
pull 1
my 1
bow 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
second 1
and 1
it 1
sticks 1
in 1
an 1
oak 1
trunk 1
to 1
his 1
left 1
he 1
jumps 1
back 1
flinging 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
berries 1
into 1
the 1
foliage 1
my 1
fear 1
comes 1
out 1
as 1
anger 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
youre 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
not 1
running 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
found 1
some 1
berries 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
he 1
says 1
clearly 1
confused 1
by 1
my 1
outburst 1
i 1
whistled 1
why 1
didnt 1
you 1
whistle 1
back 1
i 1
snap 1
at 1
him 1
i 1
didnt 1
hear 1
the 1
waters 1
too 1
loud 1
i 1
guess 1
he 1
says 1
he 1
crosses 1
and 1
puts 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
my 1
shoulders 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
im 1
trembling 1
i 1
thought 1
cato 1
killed 1
you 1
i 1
almost 1
shout 1
no 1
im 1
fine 1
peeta 1
wraps 1
his 1
arms 1
around 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
respond 1
katniss 1
i 1
push 1
away 1
trying 1
to 1
sort 1
out 1
my 1
feelings 1
if 1
two 1
people 1
agree 1
on 1
a 1
signal 1
they 1
stay 1
in 1
range 1
because 1
if 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
doesnt 1
answer 1
theyre 1
in 1
trouble 1
all 1
right 1
all 1
right 1
he 1
says 1
all 1
right 1
because 1
thats 1
what 1
happened 1
with 1
rue 1
and 1
i 1
watched 1
her 1
die 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
pack 1
and 1
open 1
a 1
fresh 1
bottle 1
of 1
water 1
although 1
i 1
still 1
have 1
some 1
in 1
mine 1
but 1
im 1
not 1
ready 1
to 1
forgive 1
him 1
i 1
notice 1
the 1
food 1
the 1
rolls 1
and 1
apples 1
are 1
untouched 1
but 1
someones 1
definitely 1
picked 1
away 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
cheese 1
and 1
you 1
ate 1
without 1
me 1
i 1
really 1
dont 1
care 1
i 1
just 1
want 1
something 1
else 1
to 1
be 1
mad 1
about 1
what 1
no 1
i 1
didnt 1
peeta 1
says 1
oh 1
and 1
i 1
suppose 1
the 1
apples 1

the 1
cheese 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
ate 1
the 1
cheese 1
peeta 1
says 1
slowly 1
and 1
distinctly 1
as 1
if 1
trying 1
not 1
to 1
lose 1
his 1
temper 1
but 1
it 1
wasnt 1
me 1
ive 1
been 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
collecting 1
berries 1
would 1
you 1
care 1
for 1
some 1
i 1
would 1
actually 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
relent 1
too 1
soon 1
i 1
do 1
walk 1
over 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
this 1
type 1
before 1
no 1
i 1
have 1
but 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
these 1
arent 1
rues 1
berries 1
although 1
they 1
resemble 1
them 1
nor 1
do 1
they 1
match 1
any 1
i 1
learned 1
about 1
in 1
training 1
i 1
lean 1
down 1
and 1
scoop 1
up 1
a 1
few 1
rolling 1
them 1
between 1
my 1
fingers 1
my 1
fathers 1
voice 1
comes 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
these 1
katniss 1
never 1
these 1
theyre 1
nightlock 1
youll 1
be 1
dead 1
before 1
they 1
reach 1
your 1
stomach 1
just 1
then 1
the 1
cannon 1
fires 1
i 1
whip 1
around 1
expecting 1
peeta 1
to 1
collapse 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
raises 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
appears 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
or 1
so 1
away 1
whats 1
left 1
of 1
foxfaces 1
emaciated 1
body 1
is 1
lifted 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
red 1
glint 1
of 1
her 1
hair 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
known 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
missing 1
cheese 1
peeta 1
has 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
pushing 1
me 1
toward 1
a 1
tree 1
climb 1
hell 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
well 1
stand 1
a 1
better 1
chance 1
fighting 1
him 1
from 1
above 1
i 1
stop 1
him 1
suddenly 1
calm 1
no 1
peeta 1
shes 1
your 1
kill 1
not 1
catos 1
what 1
i 1
havent 1
even 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
he 1
says 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
have 1
killed 1
her 1
in 1
answer 1
i 1
hold 1
out 1
the 1
berries 1
it 1
takes 1
a 1
while 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
situation 1
to 1
peeta 1
how 1
foxface 1
stole 1
the 1
food 1
from 1
the 1
supply 1
pile 1
before 1
i 1
blew 1
it 1
up 1
how 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
take 1
enough 1
to 1
stay 1
alive 1
but 1
not 1
enough 1
that 1
anyone 1
would 1
notice 1
it 1
how 1
she 1
wouldnt 1
question 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
berries 1
we 1
were 1
preparing 1
to 1
eat 1
ourselves 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
she 1
found 1
us 1
says 1
peeta 1
my 1
fault 1
i 1
guess 1
if 1
im 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
we 1
were 1
about 1
as 1
hard 1
to 1
follow 1
as 1
a 1
herd 1
of 1
cattle 1
but 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
kind 1
and 1
shes 1
very 1
clever 1
peeta 1
well 1
she 1
was 1
until 1
you 1
outfoxed 1
her 1
not 1
on 1
purpose 1
doesnt 1
seem 1
fair 1
somehow 1
i 1
mean 1
we 1
would 1
have 1
both 1
been 1
dead 1
too 1
if 1
she 1
hadnt 1
eaten 1
the 1
berries 1
first 1
he 1
checks 1
himself 1
no 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
you 1
recognized 1
them 1
didnt 1
you 1
i 1
give 1
a 1
nod 1
we 1
call 1
them 1
nightlock 1
even 1
the 1
name 1
sounds 1
deadly 1
he 1
says 1
im 1
sorry 1
katniss 1
i 1
really 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
ones 1
youd 1
gathered 1
dont 1
apologize 1
it 1
just 1
means 1
were 1
one 1
step 1
closer 1
to 1
home 1
right 1
i 1
ask 1
ill 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
rest 1
peeta 1
says 1
he 1
gathers 1
up 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
blue 1
plastic 1
careful 1
to 1
trap 1
the 1
berries 1
inside 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
toss 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
wait 1
i 1
cry 1
i 1
find 1
the 1
leather 1
pouch 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
and 1
fill 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
handfuls 1
of 1
berries 1
from 1
the 1
plastic 1
if 1
they 1
fooled 1
foxface 1
maybe 1
they 1
can 1
fool 1
cato 1
as 1
well 1
if 1
hes 1
chasing 1
us 1
or 1
something 1
we 1
can 1
act 1
like 1
we 1
accidentally 1
drop 1
the 1
pouch 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
eats 1
them 1
then 1
hello 1
district 1
twelve 1
says 1
peeta 1
thats 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
securing 1
the 1
pouch 1
to 1
my 1
belt 1
hell 1
know 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
now 1
says 1
peeta 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
anywhere 1
nearby 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
hovercraft 1
hell 1
know 1
we 1
killed 1
her 1
and 1
come 1
after 1
us 1
peetas 1
right 1
this 1
could 1
be 1
just 1
the 1
opportunity 1
catos 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
but 1
even 1
if 1
we 1
run 1
now 1
theres 1
the 1
meat 1
to 1
cook 1
and 1
our 1
fire 1
will 1
be 1
another 1
sign 1
of 1
our 1
whereabouts 1
lets 1
make 1
a 1
fire 1
right 1
now 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
gather 1
branches 1
and 1
brush 1
are 1
you 1
ready 1
to 1
face 1
him 1
peeta 1
asks 1
im 1
ready 1
to 1
eat 1
better 1
to 1
cook 1
our 1
food 1
while 1
we 1
have 1
the 1
chance 1
if 1
he 1
knows 1
were 1
here 1
he 1
knows 1
but 1
he 1
also 1
knows 1
theres 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
probably 1
assumes 1
we 1
were 1
hunting 1
foxface 1
that 1
means 1
youre 1
recovered 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
means 1
were 1
not 1
hiding 1
were 1
inviting 1
him 1
here 1
would 1
you 1
show 1
up 1
i 1
ask 1
maybe 1
not 1
he 1
says 1
peetas 1
a 1
whiz 1
with 1
fires 1
coaxing 1
a 1
blaze 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
damp 1
wood 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
rabbits 1
and 1
squirrel 1
roasting 1
the 1
roots 1
wrapped 1
in 1
leaves 1
baking 1
in 1
the 1
coals 1
we 1
take 1
turns 1
gathering 1
greens 1
and 1
keeping 1
a 1
careful 1
watch 1
for 1
cato 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
anticipated 1
he 1
doesnt 1
make 1
an 1
appearance 1
when 1
the 1
foods 1
cooked 1
i 1
pack 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
up 1
leaving 1
us 1
each 1
a 1
rabbits 1
leg 1
to 1
eat 1
as 1
we 1
walk 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
move 1
higher 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
climb 1
a 1
good 1
tree 1
and 1
make 1
camp 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
but 1
peeta 1
resists 1
i 1
cant 1
climb 1
like 1
you 1
katniss 1
especially 1
with 1
my 1
leg 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
could 1
ever 1
fall 1
asleep 1
fifty 1
feet 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
its 1
not 1
safe 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
peeta 1
i 1
say 1
cant 1
we 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
he 1
asks 1
its 1
near 1
water 1
and 1
easy 1
to 1
defend 1
i 1
sigh 1
several 1
more 1
hours 1
of 1
walking 1
or 1
should 1
i 1
say 1
crashing 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
reach 1
an 1
area 1
well 1
just 1
have 1
to 1
leave 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
hunt 1
but 1
peeta 1
doesnt 1
ask 1
for 1
much 1
hes 1
followed 1
my 1
instructions 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
im 1
sure 1
if 1
things 1
were 1
reversed 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
make 1
me 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
it 1
dawns 1
on 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
havent 1
been 1
very 1
nice 1
to 1
peeta 1
today 1
nagging 1
him 1
about 1
how 1
loud 1
he 1
was 1
screaming 1
at 1
him 1
over 1
disappearing 1
the 1
playful 1
romance 1
we 1
had 1
sustained 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
has 1
disappeared 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
under 1
the 1
hot 1
sun 1
with 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
cato 1
looming 1
over 1
us 1
haymitch 1
has 1
probably 1
just 1
about 1
had 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
i 1
reach 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
kiss 1
sure 1
lets 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
he 1
looks 1
pleased 1
and 1
relieved 1
well 1
that 1
was 1
easy 1
i 1
work 1
my 1
arrow 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
oak 1
careful 1
not 1
to 1
damage 1
the 1
shaft 1
these 1
arrows 1
are 1
food 1
safety 1
and 1
life 1
itself 1
now 1
we 1
toss 1
a 1
bunch 1
more 1
wood 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
sending 1
off 1
smoke 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
hours 1
although 1
i 1
doubt 1
cato 1
assumes 1
anything 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
when 1
we 1
reach 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
water 1
has 1
dropped 1
considerably 1
and 1
moves 1
at 1
its 1
old 1
leisurely 1
pace 1
so 1
i 1
suggest 1
we 1
walk 1
back 1
in 1
it 1
peetas 1
happy 1
to 1
oblige 1
and 1
since 1
hes 1
a 1
lot 1
quieter 1
in 1
water 1
than 1
on 1
land 1
its 1
a 1
doubly 1
good 1
idea 1
its 1
a 1
long 1
walk 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
though 1
even 1
going 1
downward 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
rabbit 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
boost 1
were 1
both 1
exhausted 1
by 1
our 1
hike 1
today 1
and 1
still 1
way 1
too 1
underfed 1
i 1
keep 1
my 1
bow 1
loaded 1
both 1
for 1
cato 1
and 1
any 1
fish 1
i 1
might 1
see 1
but 1
the 1
stream 1
seems 1
strangely 1
empty 1
of 1
creatures 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
reach 1
our 1
destination 1
our 1
feet 1
are 1
dragging 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
sits 1
low 1
on 1
the 1
horizon 1
we 1
fill 1
up 1
our 1
water 1
bottles 1
and 1
climb 1
the 1
little 1
slope 1
to 1
our 1
den 1
its 1
not 1
much 1
but 1
out 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness 1
its 1
the 1
closest 1
thing 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
a 1
home 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
warmer 1
than 1
a 1
tree 1
too 1
because 1
it 1
provides 1
some 1
shelter 1
from 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
has 1
begun 1
to 1
blow 1
steadily 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
i 1
set 1
a 1
good 1
dinner 1
out 1
but 1
halfway 1
through 1
peeta 1
begins 1
to 1
nod 1
off 1
after 1
days 1
of 1
inactivity 1
the 1
hunt 1
has 1
taken 1
its 1
toll 1
i 1
order 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
and 1
set 1
aside 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
food 1
for 1
when 1
he 1
wakes 1
he 1
drops 1
off 1
immediately 1
i 1
pull 1
the 1
sleeping 1
bag 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
chin 1
and 1
kiss 1
his 1
forehead 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
but 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
im 1
so 1
grateful 1
that 1
hes 1
still 1
here 1
not 1
dead 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
as 1
id 1
thought 1
so 1
glad 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
face 1
cato 1
alone 1
brutal 1
bloody 1
cato 1
who 1
can 1
snap 1
a 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
twist 1
of 1
his 1
arm 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
overcome 1
thresh 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
me 1
since 1
the 1
beginning 1
he 1
probably 1
has 1
had 1
a 1
special 1
hatred 1
for 1
me 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
outscored 1
him 1
in 1
training 1
a 1
boy 1
like 1
peeta 1
would 1
simply 1
shrug 1
that 1
off 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
feeling 1
it 1
drove 1
cato 1
to 1
distraction 1
which 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
hard 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
his 1
ridiculous 1
reaction 1
to 1
finding 1
the 1
supplies 1
blown 1
up 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
upset 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
completely 1
unhinged 1
i 1
wonder 1
now 1
if 1
cato 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
entirely 1
sane 1
the 1
sky 1
lights 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
seal 1
and 1
i 1
watch 1
foxface 1
shine 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
then 1
disappear 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
forever 1
he 1
hasnt 1
said 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
peeta 1
felt 1
good 1
about 1
killing 1
her 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
essential 1
i 1
cant 1
pretend 1
ill 1
miss 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
admire 1
her 1
my 1
guess 1
is 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
us 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
test 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
smartest 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
tributes 1
if 1
in 1
fact 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
setting 1
a 1
trap 1
for 1
her 1
i 1
bet 1
shed 1
have 1
sensed 1
it 1
and 1
avoided 1
the 1
berries 1
it 1
was 1
peetas 1
own 1
ignorance 1
that 1
brought 1
her 1
down 1
ive 1
spent 1
so 1
much 1
time 1
making 1
sure 1
i 1
dont 1
underestimate 1
my 1
opponents 1
that 1
ive 1
forgotten 1
its 1
just 1
as 1
dangerous 1
to 1
overestimate 1
them 1
as 1
well 1
that 1
brings 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
cato 1
but 1
while 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
foxface 1
who 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
operated 1
hes 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
slippery 1
powerful 1
well 1
trained 1
but 1
smart 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
not 1
like 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
utterly 1
lacking 1
in 1
the 1
control 1
foxface 1
demonstrated 1
i 1
believe 1
cato 1
could 1
easily 1
lose 1
his 1
judgment 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
temper 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
superior 1
on 1
that 1
point 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
sent 1
the 1
arrow 1
flying 1
into 1
the 1
apple 1
in 1
the 1
pigs 1
mouth 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
enraged 1
maybe 1
i 1
do 1
understand 1
cato 1
better 1
than 1
i 1
think 1
despite 1
the 1
fatigue 1
in 1
my 1
body 1
my 1
minds 1
alert 1
so 1
i 1
let 1
peeta 1
sleep 1
long 1
past 1
our 1
usual 1
switch 1
in 1
fact 1
a 1
soft 1
gray 1
day 1
has 1
begun 1
when 1
i 1
shake 1
his 1
shoulder 1
he 1
looks 1
out 1
almost 1
in 1
alarm 1
i 1
slept 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
thats 1
not 1
fair 1
katniss 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
woken 1
me 1
i 1
stretch 1
and 1
burrow 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
bag 1
ill 1
sleep 1
now 1
wake 1
me 1
if 1
anything 1
interesting 1
happens 1
apparently 1
nothing 1
does 1
because 1
when 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
eyes 1
bright 1
hot 1
afternoon 1
light 1
gleams 1
through 1
the 1
rocks 1
any 1
sign 1
of 1
our 1
friend 1
i 1
ask 1
peeta 1
shakes 1
his 1
head 1
no 1
hes 1
keeping 1
a 1
disturbingly 1
low 1
profile 1
how 1
long 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
well 1
have 1
before 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
drive 1
us 1
together 1
i 1
ask 1
well 1
foxface 1
died 1
almost 1
a 1
day 1
ago 1
so 1
theres 1
been 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
to 1
place 1
bets 1
and 1
get 1
bored 1
i 1
guess 1
it 1
could 1
happen 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
says 1
peeta 1
yeah 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
feeling 1
todays 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
sit 1
up 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
peaceful 1
terrain 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
theyll 1
do 1
it 1
peeta 1
remains 1
silent 1
theres 1
not 1
really 1
any 1
good 1
answer 1
well 1
until 1
they 1
do 1
no 1
sense 1
in 1
wasting 1
a 1
hunting 1
day 1
but 1
we 1
should 1
probably 1
eat 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
hold 1
just 1
in 1
case 1
we 1
run 1
into 1
trouble 1
i 1
say 1
peeta 1
packs 1
up 1
our 1
gear 1
while 1
i 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
big 1
meal 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
rabbits 1
roots 1
greens 1
the 1
rolls 1
spread 1
with 1
the 1
last 1
bit 1
of 1
cheese 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
i 1
leave 1
in 1
reserve 1
is 1
the 1
squirrel 1
and 1
the 1
apple 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
were 1
done 1
all 1
thats 1
left 1
is 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
rabbit 1
bones 1
my 1
hands 1
are 1
greasy 1
which 1
only 1
adds 1
to 1
my 1
growing 1
feeling 1
of 1
grubbiness 1
maybe 1
we 1
dont 1
bathe 1
daily 1
in 1
the 1
seam 1
but 1
we 1
keep 1
cleaner 1
than 1
i 1
have 1
of 1
late 1
except 1
for 1
my 1
feet 1
which 1
have 1
walked 1
in 1
the 1
stream 1
im 1
covered 1
in 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
grime 1
leaving 1
the 1
cave 1
has 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
finality 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
another 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
somehow 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
the 1
other 1
dead 1
or 1
alive 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
feeling 1
ill 1
escape 1
it 1
today 1
i 1
give 1
the 1
rocks 1
a 1
pat 1
goodbye 1
and 1
we 1
head 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
to 1
wash 1
up 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
my 1
skin 1
itching 1
for 1
the 1
cool 1
water 1
i 1
may 1
do 1
my 1
hair 1
and 1
braid 1
it 1
back 1
wet 1
im 1
wondering 1
if 1
we 1
might 1
even 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
our 1
clothes 1
a 1
quick 1
scrub 1
when 1
we 1
reach 1
the 1
stream 1
or 1
what 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
stream 1
now 1
theres 1
only 1
a 1
bonedry 1
bed 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
down 1
to 1
feel 1
it 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
little 1
damp 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
drained 1
it 1
while 1
we 1
slept 1
i 1
say 1
a 1
fear 1
of 1
the 1
cracked 1
tongue 1
aching 1
body 1
and 1
fuzzy 1
mind 1
brought 1
on 1
by 1
my 1
previous 1
dehydration 1
creeps 1
into 1
my 1
consciousness 1
our 1
bottles 1
and 1
skin 1
are 1
fairly 1
full 1
but 1
with 1
two 1
drinking 1
and 1
this 1
hot 1
sun 1
it 1
wont 1
take 1
long 1
to 1
deplete 1
them 1
the 1
lake 1
says 1
peeta 1
thats 1
where 1
they 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
maybe 1
the 1
ponds 1

have 1
some 1
i 1
say 1
hopefully 1
we 1
can 1
check 1
he 1
says 1
but 1
hes 1
just 1
humoring 1
me 1
im 1
humoring 1
myself 1
because 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
ill 1
find 1
when 1
we 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
pond 1
where 1
i 1
soaked 1
my 1
leg 1
a 1
dusty 1
gaping 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
hole 1
but 1
we 1
make 1
the 1
trip 1
anyway 1
just 1
to 1
confirm 1
what 1
we 1
already 1
know 1
youre 1
right 1
theyre 1
driving 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
say 1
where 1
theres 1
no 1
cover 1
where 1
theyre 1
guaranteed 1
a 1
bloody 1
fight 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
with 1
nothing 1
to 1
block 1
their 1
view 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
straightaway 1
or 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
waters 1
tapped 1
out 1
lets 1
go 1
now 1
while 1
weve 1
had 1
food 1
and 1
rest 1
lets 1
just 1
go 1
end 1
this 1
thing 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
nod 1
its 1
funny 1
i 1
feel 1
almost 1
as 1
if 1
its 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
again 1
that 1
im 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
twentyone 1
tributes 1
are 1
dead 1
but 1
i 1
still 1
have 1
yet 1
to 1
kill 1
cato 1
and 1
really 1
wasnt 1
he 1
always 1
the 1
one 1
to 1
kill 1
now 1
it 1
seems 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
were 1
just 1
minor 1
obstacles 1
distractions 1
keeping 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
real 1
battle 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
cato 1
and 1
me 1
but 1
no 1
theres 1
the 1
boy 1
waiting 1
beside 1
me 1
i 1
feel 1
his 1
arms 1
wrap 1
around 1
me 1
two 1
against 1
one 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
he 1
says 1
next 1
time 1
we 1
eat 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
i 1
answer 1
you 1
bet 1
it 1
will 1
he 1
says 1
we 1
stand 1
there 1
a 1
while 1
locked 1
in 1
an 1
embrace 1
feeling 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
sunlight 1
the 1
rustle 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
at 1
our 1
feet 1
then 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
we 1
break 1
apart 1
and 1
head 1
for 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
now 1
that 1
peetas 1
footfalls 1
send 1
rodents 1
scurrying 1
make 1
birds 1
take 1
wing 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
fight 1
cato 1
and 1
id 1
just 1
as 1
soon 1
do 1
it 1
here 1
as 1
on 1
the 1
plain 1
but 1
i 1
doubt 1
ill 1
have 1
that 1
choice 1
if 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
want 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
we 1
stop 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
the 1
careers 1
trapped 1
me 1
the 1
husk 1
of 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
nest 1
beaten 1
to 1
a 1
pulp 1
by 1
the 1
heavy 1
rains 1
and 1
dried 1
in 1
the 1
burning 1
sun 1
confirms 1
the 1
location 1
i 1
touch 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
my 1
boot 1
and 1
it 1
dissolves 1
into 1
dust 1
that 1
is 1
quickly 1
carried 1
off 1
by 1
the 1
breeze 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
looking 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
rue 1
secretly 1
perched 1
waiting 1
to 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
tracker 1
jackers 1
glimmers 1
bloated 1
body 1
the 1
terrifying 1
hallucinations 1
lets 1
move 1
on 1
i 1
say 1
wanting 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
darkness 1
that 1
surrounds 1
this 1
place 1
peeta 1
doesnt 1
object 1
given 1
our 1
late 1
start 1
to 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
we 1
reach 1
the 1
plain 1
its 1
already 1
early 1
evening 1
theres 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
cato 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
anything 1
except 1
the 1
gold 1
cornucopia 1
glowing 1
in 1
the 1
slanting 1
sun 1
rays 1
just 1
in 1
case 1
cato 1
decided 1
to 1
pull 1
a 1
foxface 1
on 1
us 1
we 1
circle 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
its 1
empty 1
then 1
obediently 1
as 1
if 1
following 1
instructions 1
we 1
cross 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
fill 1
our 1
water 1
containers 1
i 1
frown 1
at 1
the 1
shrinking 1
sun 1
we 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
fight 1
him 1
after 1
dark 1
theres 1
only 1
the 1
one 1
pair 1
of 1
glasses 1
peeta 1
carefully 1
squeezes 1
drops 1
of 1
iodine 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
maybe 1
thats 1
what 1
hes 1
waiting 1
for 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
either 1
that 1
or 1
find 1
a 1
tree 1
but 1
lets 1
give 1
him 1
another 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
then 1
well 1
take 1
cover 1
i 1
answer 1
we 1
sit 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
in 1
full 1
sight 1
theres 1
no 1
point 1
in 1
hiding 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
plain 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
mockingjays 1
flitting 1
about 1
bouncing 1
melodies 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
between 1
them 1
like 1
brightly 1
colored 1
balls 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
sing 1
out 1
rues 1
fournote 1
run 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
them 1
pause 1
curiously 1
at 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
my 1
voice 1
listening 1
for 1
more 1
i 1
repeat 1
the 1
notes 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
first 1
one 1
mockingjay 1
trills 1
the 1
tune 1
back 1
then 1
another 1
then 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
comes 1
alive 1
with 1
the 1
sound 1
just 1
like 1
your 1
father 1
says 1
peeta 1
my 1
fingers 1
find 1
the 1
pin 1
on 1
my 1
shirt 1
thats 1
rues 1
song 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
think 1
they 1
remember 1
it 1
the 1
music 1
swells 1
and 1
i 1
recognize 1
the 1
brilliance 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
notes 1
overlap 1
they 1
compliment 1
one 1
another 1
forming 1
a 1
lovely 1
unearthly 1
harmony 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
sound 1
then 1
thanks 1
to 1
rue 1
that 1
sent 1
the 1
orchard 1
workers 1
of 1
district 1
home 1
each 1
night 1
does 1
someone 1
start 1
it 1
at 1
quitting 1
time 1
i 1
wonder 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
dead 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
i 1
just 1
close 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
listen 1
mesmerized 1
by 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
song 1
then 1
something 1
begins 1
to 1
disrupt 1
the 1
music 1
runs 1
cut 1
off 1
in 1
jagged 1
imperfect 1
lines 1
dissonant 1
notes 1
intersperse 1
with 1
the 1
melody 1
the 1
mockingjays 1
voices 1
rise 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
shrieking 1
cry 1
of 1
alarm 1
were 1
on 1
our 1
feet 1
peeta 1
wielding 1
his 1
knife 1
me 1
poised 1
to 1
shoot 1
when 1
cato 1
smashes 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
bears 1
down 1
on 1
us 1
he 1
has 1
no 1
spear 1
in 1
fact 1
his 1
hands 1
are 1
empty 1
yet 1
he 1
runs 1
straight 1
for 1
us 1
my 1
first 1
arrow 1
hits 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
inexplicably 1
falls 1
aside 1
hes 1
got 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
body 1
armor 1
i 1
shout 1
to 1
peeta 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
too 1
because 1
cato 1
is 1
upon 1
us 1
i 1
brace 1
myself 1
but 1
he 1
rockets 1
right 1
between 1
us 1
with 1
no 1
attempt 1
to 1
check 1
his 1
speed 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
from 1
his 1
panting 1
the 1
sweat 1
pouring 1
off 1
his 1
purplish 1
face 1
that 1
hes 1
been 1
running 1
hard 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
not 1
toward 1
us 1
from 1
something 1
but 1
what 1
my 1
eyes 1
scan 1
the 1
woods 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
first 1
creature 1
leap 1
onto 1
the 1
plain 1
as 1
im 1
turning 1
away 1
i 1
see 1
another 1
half 1
dozen 1
join 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
am 1
stumbling 1
blindly 1
after 1
cato 1
with 1
no 1
thought 1
of 1
anything 1
but 1
to 1
save 1
myself 1
muttations 1
no 1
question 1
about 1
it 1
ive 1
never 1
seen 1
these 1
mutts 1
but 1
theyre 1
no 1
naturalborn 1
animals 1
they 1
resemble 1
huge 1
wolves 1
but 1
what 1
wolf 1
lands 1
and 1
then 1
balances 1
easily 1
on 1
its 1
hind 1
legs 1
what 1
wolf 1
waves 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
forward 1
with 1
its 1
front 1
paw 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
wrist 1
these 1
things 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
up 1
close 1
im 1
sure 1
their 1
more 1
menacing 1
attributes 1
will 1
be 1
revealed 1
cato 1
has 1
made 1
a 1
beeline 1
for 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
and 1
without 1
question 1
i 1
follow 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
thinks 1
its 1
the 1
safest 1
place 1
who 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
argue 1
besides 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
trees 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
for 1
peeta 1
to 1
outrun 1
them 1
on 1
that 1
leg 1
peeta 1
my 1
hands 1
have 1
just 1
landed 1
on 1
the 1
metal 1
at 1
the 1
pointed 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
when 1
i 1
remember 1
im 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
team 1
hes 1
about 1
fifteen 1
yards 1
behind 1
me 1
hobbling 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
but 1
the 1
mutts 1
are 1
closing 1
in 1
on 1
him 1
fast 1
i 1
send 1
an 1
arrow 1
into 1
the 1
pack 1
and 1
one 1
goes 1
down 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
plenty 1
to 1
take 1
its 1
place 1
peetas 1
waving 1
me 1
up 1
the 1
horn 1
go 1
katniss 1

hes 1
right 1
i 1
cant 1
protect 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
start 1
climbing 1
scaling 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
the 1
pure 1
gold 1
surface 1
has 1
been 1
designed 1
to 1
resemble 1
the 1
woven 1
horn 1
that 1
we 1
fill 1
at 1
harvest 1
so 1
there 1
are 1
little 1
ridges 1
and 1
seams 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
decent 1
hold 1
on 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
sun 1
the 1
metal 1
feels 1
hot 1
enough 1
to 1
blister 1
my 1
hands 1
cato 1
lies 1
on 1
his 1
side 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
twenty 1
feet 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
gasping 1
to 1
catch 1
his 1
breath 1
as 1
he 1
gags 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
nows 1
my 1
chance 1
to 1
finish 1
him 1
off 1
i 1
stop 1
midway 1
up 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
load 1
another 1
arrow 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
im 1
about 1
to 1
let 1
it 1
fly 1
i 1
hear 1
peeta 1
cry 1
out 1
i 1
twist 1
around 1
and 1
see 1
hes 1
just 1
reached 1
the 1
tail 1
and 1
the 1
mutts 1
are 1
right 1
on 1
his 1
heels 1
climb 1
i 1
yell 1
peeta 1
starts 1
up 1
hampered 1
by 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
leg 1
but 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
i 1
shoot 1
my 1
arrow 1
down 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
mutt 1
that 1
places 1
its 1
paws 1
on 1
the 1
metal 1
as 1
it 1
dies 1
the 1
creature 1
lashes 1
out 1
inadvertently 1
opening 1
gashes 1
on 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
its 1
companions 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
claws 1
four 1
inches 1
and 1
clearly 1
razorsharp 1
peeta 1
reaches 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
i 1
grab 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
pull 1
him 1
along 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
cato 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
and 1
whip 1
around 1
but 1
hes 1
doubled 1
over 1
with 1
cramps 1
and 1
apparently 1
more 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
the 1
mutts 1
than 1
us 1
he 1
coughs 1
out 1
something 1
unintelligible 1
the 1
snuffling 1
growling 1
sound 1
coming 1
from 1
the 1
mutts 1
isnt 1
helping 1
what 1
i 1
shout 1
at 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
can 1
they 1
climb 1
it 1
answers 1
peeta 1
drawing 1
my 1
focus 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
the 1
mutts 1
are 1
beginning 1
to 1
assemble 1
as 1
they 1
join 1
together 1
they 1
raise 1
up 1
again 1
to 1
stand 1
easily 1
on 1
their 1
back 1
legs 1
giving 1
them 1
an 1
eerily 1
human 1
quality 1
each 1
has 1
a 1
thick 1
coat 1
some 1
with 1
fur 1
that 1
is 1
straight 1
and 1
sleek 1
others 1
curly 1
and 1
the 1
colors 1
vary 1
from 1
jet 1
black 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
describe 1
as 1
blond 1
theres 1
something 1
else 1
about 1
them 1
something 1
that 1
makes 1
the 1
hair 1
rise 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
my 1
neck 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
put 1
my 1
finger 1
on 1
it 1
they 1
put 1
their 1
snouts 1
on 1
the 1
horn 1
sniffing 1
and 1
tasting 1
the 1
metal 1
scraping 1
paws 1
over 1
the 1
surface 1
and 1
then 1
making 1
highpitched 1
yipping 1
sounds 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
how 1
they 1
communicate 1
because 1
the 1
pack 1
backs 1
up 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
make 1
room 1
then 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
goodsize 1
mutt 1
with 1
silky 1
waves 1
of 1
blond 1
fur 1
takes 1
a 1
running 1
start 1
and 1
leaps 1
onto 1
the 1
horn 1
its 1
back 1
legs 1
must 1
be 1
incredibly 1
powerful 1
because 1
it 1
lands 1
a 1
mere 1
ten 1
feet 1
below 1
us 1
its 1
pink 1
lips 1
pulled 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
snarl 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
it 1
hangs 1
there 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
realize 1
what 1
else 1
unsettled 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
mutts 1
the 1
green 1
eyes 1
glowering 1
at 1
me 1
are 1
unlike 1
any 1
dog 1
or 1
wolf 1
any 1
canine 1
ive 1
ever 1
seen 1
they 1
are 1
unmistakably 1
human 1
and 1
that 1
revelation 1
has 1
barely 1
registered 1
when 1
i 1
notice 1
the 1
collar 1
with 1
the 1
number 1
inlaid 1
with 1
jewels 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
horrible 1
thing 1
hits 1
me 1
the 1
blonde 1
hair 1
the 1
green 1
eyes 1
the 1
number 1
its 1
glimmer 1
a 1
shriek 1
escapes 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
im 1
having 1
trouble 1
holding 1
the 1
arrow 1
in 1
place 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
to 1
fire 1
only 1
too 1
aware 1
of 1
my 1
dwindling 1
supply 1
of 1
arrows 1
waiting 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
creatures 1
can 1
in 1
fact 1
climb 1
but 1
now 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
mutt 1
has 1
begun 1
to 1
slide 1
backward 1
unable 1
to 1
find 1
any 1
purchase 1
on 1
the 1
metal 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
slow 1
screeching 1
of 1
the 1
claws 1
like 1
nails 1
on 1
a 1
blackboard 1
i 1
fire 1
into 1
its 1
throat 1
its 1
body 1
twitches 1
and 1
flops 1
onto 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
a 1
thud 1
katniss 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
peetas 1
grip 1
on 1
my 1
arm 1
its 1
her 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
who 1
asks 1
peeta 1
my 1
head 1
snaps 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
as 1
i 1
examine 1
the 1
pack 1
taking 1
in 1
the 1
various 1
sizes 1
and 1
colors 1
the 1
small 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
red 1
coat 1
and 1
amber 1
eyes 1
foxface 1
and 1
there 1
the 1
ashen 1
hair 1
and 1
hazel 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
who 1
died 1
as 1
we 1
struggled 1
for 1
the 1
backpack 1
and 1
worst 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
smallest 1
mutt 1
with 1
dark 1
glossy 1
fur 1
huge 1
brown 1
eyes 1
and 1
a 1
collar 1
that 1
reads 1
in 1
woven 1
straw 1
teeth 1
bared 1
in 1
hatred 1
rue 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
katniss 1
peeta 1
shakes 1
my 1
shoulder 1
its 1
them 1
its 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
others 1
rue 1
and 1
foxface 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
tributes 1
i 1
choke 1
out 1
i 1
hear 1
peetas 1
gasp 1
of 1
recognition 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
do 1
to 1
them 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
those 1
could 1
be 1
their 1
real 1
eyes 1
their 1
eyes 1
are 1
the 1
least 1
of 1
my 1
worries 1
what 1
about 1
their 1
brains 1
have 1
they 1
been 1
given 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
real 1
tributes 1
memories 1
have 1
they 1
been 1
programmed 1
to 1
hate 1
our 1
faces 1
particularly 1
because 1
we 1
have 1
survived 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
callously 1
murdered 1
and 1
the 1
ones 1
we 1
actually 1
killed 1
do 1
they 1
believe 1
theyre 1
avenging 1
their 1
own 1
deaths 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
this 1
out 1
the 1
mutts 1
begin 1
a 1
new 1
assault 1
on 1
the 1
horn 1
theyve 1
split 1
into 1
two 1
groups 1
at 1
the 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
are 1
using 1
those 1
powerful 1
hindquarters 1
to 1
launch 1
themselves 1
at 1
us 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
teeth 1
ring 1
together 1
just 1
inches 1
from 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
hear 1
peeta 1
cry 1
out 1
feel 1
the 1
yank 1
on 1
his 1
body 1
the 1
heavy 1
weight 1
of 1
boy 1
and 1
mutt 1
pulling 1
me 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
if 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
grip 1
on 1
my 1
arm 1
hed 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
it 1
takes 1
all 1
my 1
strength 1
to 1
keep 1
us 1
both 1
on 1
the 1
curved 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
more 1
tributes 1
are 1
coming 1
kill 1
it 1
peeta 1
kill 1
it 1
im 1
shouting 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
cant 1
quite 1
see 1
whats 1
happening 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
stabbed 1
the 1
thing 1
because 1
the 1
pull 1
lessens 1
im 1
able 1
to 1
haul 1
him 1
back 1
onto 1
the 1
horn 1
where 1
we 1
drag 1
ourselves 1
toward 1
the 1
top 1
where 1
the 1
lesser 1
of 1
two 1
evils 1
awaits 1
cato 1
has 1
still 1
not 1
regained 1
his 1
feet 1
but 1
his 1
breathing 1
is 1
slowing 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
soon 1
hell 1
be 1
recovered 1
enough 1
to 1
come 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
hurl 1
us 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
to 1
our 1
deaths 1
i 1
arm 1
my 1
bow 1
but 1
the 1
arrow 1
ends 1
up 1
taking 1
out 1
a 1
mutt 1
that 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
thresh 1
who 1
else 1
could 1
jump 1
so 1
high 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
moments 1
relief 1
because 1
we 1
must 1
finally 1
be 1
up 1
above 1
the 1
mutt 1
line 1
and 1
im 1
just 1
turning 1
back 1
to 1
face 1
cato 1
when 1
peetas 1
jerked 1
from 1
my 1
side 1
im 1
sure 1
the 1
pack 1
has 1
got 1
him 1
until 1
his 1
blood 1
splatters 1
my 1
face 1
cato 1
stands 1
before 1
me 1
almost 1
at 1
the 1
lip 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
holding 1
peeta 1
in 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
headlock 1
cutting 1
off 1
his 1
air 1
peetas 1
clawing 1
at 1
catos 1
arm 1
but 1
weakly 1
as 1
if 1
confused 1
over 1
whether 1
its 1
more 1
important 1
to 1
breathe 1
or 1
try 1
and 1
stem 1
the 1
gush 1
of 1
blood 1
from 1
the 1
gaping 1
hole 1
a 1
mutt 1
left 1
in 1
his 1
calf 1
i 1
aim 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
last 1
two 1
arrows 1
at 1
catos 1
head 1
knowing 1
itll 1
have 1
no 1
effect 1
on 1
his 1
trunk 1
or 1
limbs 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
now 1
see 1
are 1
clothed 1
in 1
a 1
skintight 1
fleshcolored 1
mesh 1
some 1
highgrade 1
body 1
armor 1
from 1
the 1
capitol 1
was 1
that 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
pack 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
body 1
armor 1
to 1
defend 1
against 1
my 1
arrows 1
well 1
they 1
neglected 1
to 1
send 1
a 1
face 1
guard 1
cato 1
just 1
laughs 1
shoot 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
goes 1
down 1
with 1
me 1
hes 1
right 1
if 1
i 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
falls 1
to 1
the 1
mutts 1
peeta 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
him 1
weve 1
reached 1
a 1
stalemate 1
i 1
cant 1
shoot 1
cato 1
without 1
killing 1
peeta 1
too 1
he 1
cant 1
kill 1
peeta 1
without 1
guaranteeing 1
an 1
arrow 1
in 1
his 1
brain 1
we 1
stand 1
like 1
statues 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
seeking 1
an 1
out 1
my 1
muscles 1
are 1
strained 1
so 1
tightly 1
they 1
feel 1
they 1
might 1
snap 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
my 1
teeth 1
clenched 1
to 1
the 1
breaking 1
point 1
the 1
mutts 1
go 1
silent 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
is 1
the 1
blood 1
pounding 1
in 1
my 1
good 1
ear 1
peetas 1
lips 1
are 1
turning 1
blue 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
do 1
something 1
quickly 1
hell 1
die 1
of 1
asphyxiation 1
and 1
then 1
ill 1
have 1
lost 1
him 1
and 1
cato 1
will 1
probably 1
use 1
his 1
body 1
as 1
a 1
weapon 1
against 1
me 1
in 1
fact 1
im 1
sure 1
this 1
is 1
catos 1
plan 1
because 1
while 1
hes 1
stopped 1
laughing 1
his 1
lips 1
are 1
set 1
in 1
a 1
triumphant 1
smile 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
a 1
lastditch 1
effort 1
peeta 1
raises 1
his 1
fingers 1
dripping 1
with 1
blood 1
from 1
his 1
leg 1
up 1
to 1
catos 1
arm 1
instead 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
wrestle 1
his 1
way 1
free 1
his 1
forefinger 1
veers 1
off 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
deliberate 1
x 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
catos 1
hand 1
cato 1
realizes 1
what 1
it 1
means 1
exactly 1
one 1
second 1
after 1
i 1
do 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
smile 1
drops 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
but 1
its 1
one 1
second 1
too 1
late 1
because 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
my 1
arrow 1
is 1
piercing 1
his 1
hand 1
he 1
cries 1
out 1
and 1
reflexively 1
releases 1
peeta 1
who 1
slams 1
back 1
against 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
horrible 1
moment 1
i 1
think 1
theyre 1
both 1
going 1
over 1
i 1
dive 1
forward 1
just 1
catching 1
hold 1
of 1
peeta 1
as 1
cato 1
loses 1
his 1
footing 1
on 1
the 1
bloodslick 1
horn 1
and 1
pluminets 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
we 1
hear 1
him 1
hit 1
the 1
air 1
leaving 1
his 1
body 1
on 1
impact 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
mutts 1
attack 1
him 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
cannon 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
competition 1
to 1
finish 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
released 1
but 1
it 1
doesnt 1
happen 1
not 1
yet 1
because 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
climax 1
of 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
and 1
the 1
audience 1
expects 1
a 1
show 1
i 1
dont 1
watch 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
snarls 1
the 1
growls 1
the 1
howls 1
of 1
pain 1
from 1
both 1
human 1
and 1
beast 1
as 1
cato 1
takes 1
on 1
the 1
mutt 1
pack 1
i 1
cant 1
understand 1
how 1
he 1
can 1
be 1
surviving 1
until 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
body 1
armor 1
protecting 1
him 1
from 1
ankle 1
to 1
neck 1
and 1
i 1
realize 1
what 1
a 1
long 1
night 1
this 1
could 1
be 1
cato 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
knife 1
or 1
sword 1
or 1
something 1
too 1
something 1
he 1
had 1
hidden 1
in 1
his 1
clothes 1
because 1
on 1
occasion 1
theres 1
the 1
death 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
mutt 1
or 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
metal 1
on 1
metal 1
as 1
the 1
blade 1
collides 1
with 1
the 1
golden 1
horn 1
the 1
combat 1
moves 1
around 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
cato 1
must 1
be 1
attempting 1
the 1
one 1
maneuver 1
that 1
could 1
save 1
his 1
life 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
rejoin 1
us 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
despite 1
his 1
remarkable 1
strength 1
and 1
skill 1
he 1
is 1
simply 1
overpowered 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
long 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
maybe 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
when 1
cato 1
hits 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
we 1
hear 1
the 1
mutts 1
dragging 1
him 1
dragging 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
now 1
theyll 1
finish 1
him 1
off 1
i 1
think 1
but 1
theres 1
still 1
no 1
cannon 1
night 1
falls 1
and 1
the 1
anthem 1
plays 1
and 1
theres 1
no 1
picture 1
of 1
cato 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
only 1
the 1
faint 1
moans 1
coming 1
through 1
the 1
metal 1
beneath 1
us 1
the 1
icy 1
air 1
blowing 1
across 1
the 1
plain 1
reminds 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
games 1
are 1
not 1
over 1
and 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
for 1
who 1
knows 1
how 1
long 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
no 1
guarantee 1
of 1
victory 1
i 1
turn 1
my 1
attention 1
to 1
peeta 1
and 1
discover 1
his 1
leg 1
is 1
bleeding 1
as 1
badly 1
as 1
ever 1
all 1
our 1
supplies 1
our 1
packs 1
remain 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
where 1
we 1
abandoned 1
them 1
when 1
we 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
mutts 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
bandage 1
nothing 1
to 1
staunch 1
the 1
flow 1
of 1
blood 1
from 1
his 1
calf 1
although 1
im 1
shaking 1
in 1
the 1
biting 1
wind 1
i 1
rip 1
off 1
my 1
jacket 1
remove 1
my 1
shirt 1
and 1
zip 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
jacket 1
as 1
swiftly 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
brief 1
exposure 1
sets 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattering 1
beyond 1
control 1
peetas 1
face 1
is 1
gray 1
in 1
the 1
pale 1
moonlight 1
i 1
make 1
him 1
lie 1
down 1
before 1
i 1
probe 1
his 1
wound 1
warm 1
slippery 1
blood 1
runs 1
over 1
my 1
fingers 1
a 1
bandage 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
enough 1
ive 1
seen 1
my 1
mother 1
tie 1
a 1
tourniquet 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
times 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
replicate 1
it 1
i 1
cut 1
free 1
a 1
sleeve 1
from 1
my 1
shirt 1
wrap 1
it 1
twice 1
around 1
his 1
leg 1
just 1
under 1
his 1
knee 1
and 1
tie 1
a 1
half 1
knot 1
i 1
dont 1
have 1
a 1
stick 1
so 1
i 1
take 1
my 1
remaining 1
arrow 1
and 1
insert 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
knot 1
twisting 1
it 1
as 1
tightly 1
as 1
i 1
dare 1
its 1
risky 1
business 1
peeta 1
may 1
end 1
up 1
losing 1
his 1
leg 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
weigh 1
this 1
against 1
him 1
losing 1
his 1
life 1
what 1
alternative 1
do 1
i 1
have 1
i 1
bandage 1
the 1
wound 1
in 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
shirt 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
with 1
him 1
dont 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
exactly 1
medical 1
protocol 1
but 1
im 1
terrified 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
drifts 1
off 1
hell 1
never 1
wake 1
again 1
are 1
you 1
cold 1
he 1
asks 1
he 1
unzips 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
i 1
press 1
against 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
fastens 1
it 1
around 1
me 1
its 1
a 1
bit 1
warmer 1
sharing 1
our 1
body 1
heat 1
inside 1
my 1
double 1
layer 1
of 1
jackets 1
but 1
the 1
night 1
is 1
young 1
the 1
temperature 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
drop 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
cornucopia 1
which 1
burned 1
so 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
climbed 1
it 1
slowly 1
turning 1
to 1
ice 1
cato 1
may 1
win 1
this 1
thing 1
yet 1
i 1
whisper 1
to 1
peeta 1
dont 1
you 1
believe 1
it 1
he 1
says 1
pulling 1
up 1
my 1
hood 1
but 1
hes 1
shaking 1
harder 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
next 1
hours 1
are 1
the 1
worst 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
which 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
is 1
saying 1
something 1
the 1
cold 1
would 1
be 1
torture 1
enough 1
but 1
the 1
real 1
nightmare 1
is 1
listening 1
to 1
cato 1
moaning 1
begging 1
and 1
finally 1
just 1
whimpering 1
as 1
the 1
mutts 1
work 1
away 1
at 1
him 1
after 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
or 1
what 1
hes 1
done 1
all 1
i 1
want 1
is 1
for 1
his 1
suffering 1
to 1
end 1
why 1
dont 1
they 1
just 1
kill 1
him 1
i 1
ask 1
peeta 1
you 1
know 1
why 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
pulls 1
me 1
closer 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
no 1
viewer 1
could 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
show 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
final 1
word 1
in 1
entertainment 1
it 1
goes 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
and 1
eventually 1
completely 1
consumes 1
my 1
mind 1
blocking 1
out 1
memories 1
and 1
hopes 1
of 1
tomorrow 1
erasing 1
everything 1
but 1
the 1
present 1
which 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
believe 1
will 1
never 1
change 1
there 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
anything 1
but 1
cold 1
and 1
fear 1
and 1
the 1
agonized 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
dying 1
in 1
the 1
horn 1
peeta 1
begins 1
to 1
doze 1
off 1
now 1
and 1
each 1
time 1
he 1
does 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
yelling 1
his 1
name 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
because 1
if 1
he 1
goes 1
and 1
dies 1
on 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
ill 1
go 1
completely 1
insane 1
hes 1
fighting 1
it 1
probably 1
more 1
for 1
me 1
than 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
its 1
hard 1
because 1
unconsciousness 1
would 1
be 1
its 1
own 1
form 1
of 1
escape 1
but 1
the 1
adrenaline 1
pumping 1
through 1
my 1
body 1
would 1
never 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
follow 1
him 1
so 1
i 1
cant 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
i 1
just 1
cant 1
the 1
only 1
indication 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
of 1
time 1
lies 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
subtle 1
shift 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
so 1
peeta 1
begins 1
pointing 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
insisting 1
i 1
acknowledge 1
its 1
progress 1
and 1
sometimes 1
for 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
flicker 1
of 1
hope 1
before 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
engulfs 1
me 1
again 1
finally 1
i 1
hear 1
him 1
whisper 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
rising 1
i 1
open 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
find 1
the 1
stars 1
fading 1
in 1
the 1
pale 1
light 1
of 1
dawn 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
too 1
how 1
bloodless 1
peetas 1
face 1
has 1
become 1
how 1
little 1
time 1
he 1
has 1
left 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
capitol 1
still 1
no 1
cannon 1
has 1
fired 1
i 1
press 1
my 1
good 1
ear 1
against 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
can 1
just 1
make 1
out 1
catos 1
voice 1
i 1
think 1
hes 1
closer 1
now 1
katniss 1
can 1
you 1
shoot 1
him 1
peeta 1
asks 1
if 1
hes 1
near 1
the 1
mouth 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
mercy 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
my 1
last 1
arrows 1
in 1
your 1
tourniquet 1
i 1
say 1
make 1
it 1
count 1
says 1
peeta 1
unzipping 1
his 1
jacket 1
letting 1
me 1
loose 1
so 1
i 1
free 1
the 1
arrow 1
tying 1
the 1
tourniquet 1
back 1
as 1
tightly 1
as 1
my 1
frozen 1
fingers 1
can 1
manage 1
i 1
rub 1
my 1
hands 1
together 1
trying 1
to 1
regain 1
circulation 1
when 1
i 1
crawl 1
to 1
the 1
lip 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
hang 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
i 1
feel 1
peetas 1
hands 1
grip 1
me 1
for 1
support 1
it 1
takes 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
to 1
find 1
cato 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
blood 1
then 1
the 1
raw 1
hunk 1
of 1
meat 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
enemy 1
makes 1
a 1
sound 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
his 1
mouth 1
is 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
the 1
word 1
hes 1
trying 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
please 1
pity 1
not 1
vengeance 1
sends 1
my 1
arrow 1
flying 1
into 1
his 1
skull 1
peeta 1
pulls 1
me 1
back 1
up 1
bow 1
in 1
hand 1
quiver 1
empty 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
him 1
he 1
whispers 1
the 1
cannon 1
fires 1
in 1
answer 1
then 1
we 1
won 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
hollowly 1
hurray 1
for 1
us 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
but 1
theres 1
no 1
joy 1
of 1
victory 1
in 1
my 1
voice 1
a 1
hole 1
opens 1
in 1
the 1
plain 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
on 1
cue 1
the 1
remaining 1
mutts 1
bound 1
into 1
it 1
disappearing 1
as 1
the 1
earth 1
closes 1
above 1
them 1
we 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
to 1
take 1
catos 1
remains 1
for 1
the 1
trumpets 1
of 1
victory 1
that 1
should 1
follow 1
but 1
nothing 1
happens 1
hey 1
i 1
shout 1
into 1
air 1
whats 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
only 1
response 1
is 1
the 1
chatter 1
of 1
waking 1
birds 1
maybe 1
its 1
the 1
body 1
maybe 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
move 1
away 1
from 1
it 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
remember 1
do 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
distance 1
yourself 1
from 1
the 1
dead 1
tribute 1
on 1
the 1
final 1
kill 1
my 1
brain 1
is 1
too 1
muddled 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
but 1
what 1
else 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
the 1
delay 1
okay 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
make 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
ask 1
think 1
i 1
better 1
try 1
says 1
peeta 1
we 1
inch 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
horn 1
and 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
if 1
the 1
stiffness 1
in 1
my 1
limbs 1
is 1
this 1
bad 1
how 1
can 1
peeta 1
even 1
move 1
i 1
rise 1
first 1
swinging 1
and 1
bending 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
legs 1
until 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
help 1
him 1
up 1
somehow 1
we 1
make 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
scoop 1
up 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
the 1
cold 1
water 1
for 1
peeta 1
and 1
bring 1
a 1
second 1
to 1
my 1
lips 1
a 1
mockingjay 1
gives 1
the 1
long 1
low 1
whistle 1
and 1
tears 1
of 1
relief 1
fill 1
my 1
eyes 1
as 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
appears 1
and 1
takes 1
catos 1
body 1
away 1
now 1
they 1
will 1
take 1
us 1
now 1
we 1
can 1
go 1
home 1
but 1
again 1
theres 1
no 1
response 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
waiting 1
for 1
says 1
peeta 1
weakly 1
between 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
tourniquet 1
and 1
the 1
effort 1
it 1
took 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
his 1
wound 1
has 1
opened 1
up 1
again 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
i 1
say 1
whatever 1
the 1
holdup 1
is 1
i 1
cant 1
watch 1
him 1
lose 1
any 1
more 1
blood 1
i 1
get 1
up 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
stick 1
but 1
almost 1
immediately 1
come 1
across 1
the 1
arrow 1
that 1
bounced 1
off 1
catos 1
body 1
armor 1
it 1
will 1
do 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
arrow 1
as 1
i 1
stoop 1
to 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
claudius 1
templesmiths 1
voice 1
booms 1
into 1
the 1
arena 1
greetings 1
to 1
the 1
final 1
contestants 1
of 1
the 1
seventyfourth 1
hunger 1
games 1
the 1
earlier 1
revision 1
has 1
been 1
revoked 1
closer 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
rule 1
book 1
has 1
disclosed 1
that 1
only 1
one 1
winner 1
may 1
be 1
allowed 1
he 1
says 1
good 1
luck 1
and 1
may 1
the 1
odds 1
be 1
ever 1
in 1
your 1
favor 1
theres 1
a 1
small 1
burst 1
of 1
static 1
and 1
then 1
nothing 1
more 1
i 1
stare 1
at 1
peeta 1
in 1
disbelief 1
as 1
the 1
truth 1
sinks 1
in 1
they 1
never 1
intended 1
to 1
let 1
us 1
both 1
live 1
this 1
has 1
all 1
been 1
devised 1
by 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
to 1
guarantee 1
the 1
most 1
dramatic 1
showdown 1
in 1
history 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
fool 1
i 1
bought 1
into 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
its 1
not 1
that 1
surprising 1
he 1
says 1
softly 1
i 1
watch 1
as 1
he 1
painfully 1
makes 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
then 1
hes 1
moving 1
toward 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
slow 1
motion 1
his 1
hand 1
is 1
pulling 1
the 1
knife 1
from 1
his 1
belt 1
before 1
i 1
am 1
even 1
aware 1
of 1
my 1
actions 1
my 1
bow 1
is 1
loaded 1
with 1
the 1
arrow 1
pointed 1
straight 1
at 1
his 1
heart 1
peeta 1
raises 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
knife 1
has 1
already 1
left 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
where 1
it 1
splashes 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
drop 1
my 1
weapons 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
step 1
back 1
my 1
face 1
burning 1
in 1
what 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
shame 1
no 1
he 1
says 1
do 1
it 1
peeta 1
limps 1
toward 1
me 1
and 1
thrusts 1
the 1
weapons 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
cant 1
i 1
say 1

wont 1
do 1
it 1
before 1
they 1
send 1
those 1
mutts 1
back 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
die 1
like 1
cato 1
he 1
says 1

me 1
i 1
say 1
furiously 1
shoving 1
the 1
weapons 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
you 1
shoot 1
me 1
and 1

and 1
as 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
i 1
know 1
death 1

the 1
easier 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
you 1

i 1
cant 1
peeta 1
says 1
discarding 1
the 1
weapons 1
fine 1
ill 1
go 1
first 1
anyway 1
he 1
leans 1
down 1
and 1
rips 1
the 1
bandage 1
off 1
his 1
leg 1
eliminating 1
the 1
final 1
barrier 1
between 1
his 1
blood 1
and 1
the 1
earth 1
no 1
you 1
cant 1
kill 1
yourself 1
i 1
say 1
im 1
on 1
my 1
knees 1
desperately 1
plastering 1
the 1
bandage 1
back 1
onto 1
his 1
wound 1
katniss 1
he 1
says 1
its 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
youre 1
not 1
leaving 1
me 1
here 1
alone 1
i 1
say 1
because 1
if 1
he 1
dies 1
ill 1
never 1
go 1
home 1
not 1
really 1
ill 1
spend 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
in 1
this 1
arena 1
trying 1
to 1
think 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
listen 1
he 1
says 1
pulling 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
we 1
both 1
know 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
victor 1
it 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
please 1
take 1
it 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
goes 1
on 1
about 1
how 1
he 1
loves 1
me 1
what 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
without 1
me 1
but 1
ive 1
stopped 1
listening 1
because 1
his 1
previous 1
words 1
are 1
trapped 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
thrashing 1
desperately 1
around 1
we 1
both 1
know 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
victor 1
yes 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
victor 1
without 1
a 1
victor 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
would 1
blow 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
faces 1
theyd 1
have 1
failed 1
the 1
capitol 1
might 1
possibly 1
even 1
be 1
executed 1
slowly 1
and 1
painfully 1
while 1
the 1
cameras 1
broadcast 1
it 1
to 1
every 1
screen 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
if 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
both 1
to 1
die 1
or 1
they 1
thought 1
we 1
were 1
my 1
fingers 1
fumble 1
with 1
the 1
pouch 1
on 1
my 1
belt 1
freeing 1
it 1
peeta 1
sees 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
hand 1
clamps 1
on 1
my 1
wrist 1
no 1
i 1
wont 1
let 1
you 1
trust 1
me 1
i 1
whisper 1
he 1
holds 1
my 1
gaze 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
moment 1
then 1
lets 1
me 1
go 1
i 1
loosen 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
pouch 1
and 1
pour 1
a 1
few 1
spoonfuls 1
of 1
berries 1
into 1
his 1
palm 1
then 1
i 1
fill 1
my 1
own 1
on 1
the 1
count 1
of 1
three 1
peeta 1
leans 1
down 1
and 1
kisses 1
me 1
once 1
very 1
gently 1
the 1
count 1
of 1
three 1
he 1
says 1
we 1
stand 1
our 1
backs 1
pressed 1
together 1
our 1
empty 1
hands 1
locked 1
tight 1
hold 1
them 1
out 1
i 1
want 1
everyone 1
to 1
see 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
spread 1
out 1
my 1
fingers 1
and 1
the 1
dark 1
berries 1
glisten 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
i 1
give 1
peetas 1
hand 1
one 1
last 1
squeeze 1
as 1
a 1
signal 1
as 1
a 1
goodbye 1
and 1
we 1
begin 1
counting 1
one 1
maybe 1
im 1
wrong 1
two 1
maybe 1
they 1
dont 1
care 1
if 1
we 1
both 1
die 1
three 1
its 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
lift 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
my 1
mouth 1
taking 1
one 1
last 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
berries 1
have 1
just 1
passed 1
my 1
lips 1
when 1
the 1
trumpets 1
begin 1
to 1
blare 1
the 1
frantic 1
voice 1
of 1
claudius 1
templesmith 1
shouts 1
above 1
them 1

mouth 1
wiping 1
my 1
tongue 1
with 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
shirt 1
to 1
make 1

the 1
lake 1
where 1
we 1
both 1
flush 1
our 1
mouths 1
with 1

him 1
over 1

crowd 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
that 1
theyre 1

down 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
that 1
while 1
our 1
muscles 1
are 1
immobile 1
nothing 1
is 1
preventing 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
draining 1
out 1
of 1
peetas 1
leg 1
sure 1
enough 1
the 1
minute 1
the 1
door 1
closes 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
current 1
stops 1
he 1
slumps 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
unconscious 1
my 1
fingers 1
are 1
still 1
gripping 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
jacket 1
so 1
tightly 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
take 1
him 1
away 1
it 1
tears 1
leaving 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
fistful 1
of 1
black 1
fabric 1
doctors 1
in 1
sterile 1
white 1
masked 1
and 1
gloved 1
already 1
prepped 1
to 1
operate 1
go 1
into 1
action 1
peetas 1
so 1
pale 1
and 1
still 1
on 1
a 1
silver 1
table 1
tubes 1
and 1
wires 1
springing 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
forget 1
were 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
doctors 1
as 1
just 1
one 1
more 1
threat 1
one 1
more 1
pack 1
of 1
mutts 1
designed 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
petrified 1
i 1
lunge 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
im 1
caught 1
and 1
thrust 1
back 1
into 1
another 1
room 1
and 1
a 1
glass 1
door 1
seals 1
between 1
us 1
i 1
pound 1
on 1
the 1
glass 1
screaming 1
my 1
head 1
off 1
everyone 1
ignores 1
me 1
except 1
for 1
some 1
capitol 1
attendant 1
who 1
appears 1
behind 1
me 1
and 1
offers 1
me 1
a 1
beverage 1
i 1
slump 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
my 1
face 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
staring 1
uncomprehendingly 1
at 1
the 1
crystal 1
glass 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
icy 1
cold 1
filled 1
with 1
orange 1
juice 1
a 1
straw 1
with 1
a 1
frilly 1
white 1
collar 1
how 1
wrong 1
it 1
looks 1
in 1
my 1
bloody 1
filthy 1
hand 1
with 1
its 1
dirtcaked 1
nails 1
and 1
scars 1
my 1
mouth 1
waters 1
at 1
the 1
smell 1
but 1
i 1
place 1
it 1
carefully 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
not 1
trusting 1
anything 1
so 1
clean 1
and 1
pretty 1
through 1
the 1
glass 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
doctors 1
working 1
feverishly 1
on 1
peeta 1
their 1
brows 1
creased 1
in 1
concentration 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
flow 1
of 1
liquids 1
pumping 1
through 1
the 1
tubes 1
watch 1
a 1
wall 1
of 1
dials 1
and 1
lights 1
that 1
mean 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
im 1
not 1
sure 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
his 1
heart 1
stops 1
twice 1
its 1
like 1
being 1
home 1
again 1
when 1
they 1
bring 1
in 1
the 1
hopelessly 1
mangled 1
person 1
from 1
the 1
mine 1
explosion 1
or 1
the 1
woman 1
in 1
her 1
third 1
day 1
of 1
labor 1
or 1
the 1
famished 1
child 1
struggling 1
against 1
pneumonia 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
prim 1
they 1
wear 1
that 1
same 1
look 1
on 1
their 1
faces 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
hide 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
until 1
the 1
patient 1
is 1
long 1
gone 1
and 1
in 1
another 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
seam 1
the 1
hammers 1
make 1
the 1
coffin 1
but 1
im 1
held 1
here 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
walls 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
force 1
that 1
holds 1
the 1
loved 1
ones 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
how 1
often 1
ive 1
seen 1
them 1
ringed 1
around 1
our 1
kitchen 1
table 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
why 1
dont 1
they 1
leave 1
why 1
do 1
they 1
stay 1
to 1
watch 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
its 1
because 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
i 1
startle 1
when 1
i 1
catch 1
someone 1
staring 1
at 1
me 1
from 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
realize 1
its 1
my 1
own 1
face 1
reflecting 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
glass 1
wild 1
eyes 1
hollow 1
cheeks 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
a 1
tangled 1
mat 1
rabid 1
feral 1
mad 1
no 1
wonder 1
everyone 1
is 1
keeping 1
a 1
safe 1
distance 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
next 1
thing 1
i 1
know 1
weve 1
landed 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
and 1
theyre 1
taking 1
peeta 1
but 1
leaving 1
me 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
start 1
hurling 1
myself 1
against 1
the 1
glass 1
shrieking 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
just 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
pink 1
hair 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
effie 1
it 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
effie 1
coming 1
to 1
my 1
rescue 1
when 1
the 1
needle 1
jabs 1
me 1
from 1
behind 1
when 1
i 1
wake 1
im 1
afraid 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
entire 1
ceiling 1
glows 1
with 1
a 1
soft 1
yellow 1
light 1
allowing 1
me 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
im 1
in 1
a 1
room 1
containing 1
just 1
my 1
bed 1
no 1
doors 1
no 1
windows 1
are 1
visible 1
the 1
air 1
smells 1
of 1
something 1
sharp 1
and 1
antiseptic 1
my 1
right 1
arm 1
has 1
several 1
tubes 1
that 1
extend 1
into 1
the 1
wall 1
behind 1
me 1
im 1
naked 1
but 1
the 1
bedclothes 1
arc 1
soothing 1
against 1
my 1
skin 1
i 1
tentatively 1
lift 1
my 1
left 1
hand 1
above 1
the 1
cover 1
not 1
only 1
has 1
it 1
been 1
scrubbed 1
clean 1
the 1
nails 1
are 1
filed 1
in 1
perfect 1
ovals 1
the 1
scars 1
from 1
the 1
burns 1
are 1
less 1
prominent 1
i 1
touch 1
my 1
cheek 1
my 1
lips 1
the 1
puckered 1
scar 1
above 1
my 1
eyebrow 1
and 1
am 1
just 1
running 1
my 1
fingers 1
through 1
my 1
silken 1
hair 1
when 1
i 1
freeze 1
apprehensively 1
i 1
ruffle 1
the 1
hair 1
by 1
my 1
left 1
ear 1
no 1
it 1
wasnt 1
an 1
illusion 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
again 1
i 1
try 1
and 1
sit 1
up 1
but 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
wide 1
restraining 1
band 1
around 1
my 1
waist 1
keeps 1
me 1
from 1
rising 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
the 1
physical 1
confinement 1
makes 1
me 1
panic 1
and 1
im 1
trying 1
to 1
pull 1
myself 1
up 1
and 1
wriggle 1
my 1
hips 1
through 1
the 1
band 1
when 1
a 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
wall 1
slides 1
open 1
and 1
in 1
steps 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
carrying 1
a 1
tray 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
calms 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
stop 1
trying 1
to 1
escape 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
a 1
million 1
questions 1
but 1
im 1
afraid 1
any 1
familiarity 1
would 1
cause 1
her 1
harm 1
obviously 1
i 1
am 1
being 1
closely 1
monitored 1
she 1
sets 1
the 1
tray 1
across 1
my 1
thighs 1
and 1
presses 1
something 1
that 1
raises 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
sitting 1
position 1
while 1
she 1
adjusts 1
my 1
pillows 1
i 1
risk 1
one 1
question 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
out 1
loud 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
my 1
rusty 1
voice 1
will 1
allow 1
so 1
nothing 1
will 1
seem 1
secretive 1
did 1
peeta 1
make 1
it 1
she 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
nod 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
slips 1
a 1
spoon 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
friendship 1
i 1
guess 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
me 1
dead 1
after 1
all 1
and 1
peeta 1
has 1
made 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
did 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
expensive 1
equipment 1
here 1
still 1
i 1
hadnt 1
been 1
sure 1
until 1
now 1
as 1
the 1
avox 1
leaves 1
the 1
door 1
closes 1
noiselessly 1
after 1
her 1
and 1
i 1
turn 1
hungrily 1
to 1
the 1
tray 1
a 1
bowl 1
of 1
clear 1
broth 1
a 1
small 1
serving 1
of 1
applesauce 1
and 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
water 1
this 1
is 1
it 1
i 1
think 1
grouchily 1
shouldnt 1
my 1
homecoming 1
dinner 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
spectacular 1
but 1
i 1
find 1
its 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
finish 1
the 1
spare 1
meal 1
before 1
me 1
my 1
stomach 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
shrunk 1
to 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
chestnut 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
wonder 1
how 1
long 1
ive 1
been 1
out 1
because 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
trouble 1
eating 1
a 1
fairly 1
sizable 1
breakfast 1
that 1
last 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
theres 1
usually 1
a 1
lag 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
between 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
competition 1
and 1
the 1
presentation 1
of 1
the 1
victor 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
put 1
the 1
starving 1
wounded 1
mess 1
of 1
a 1
person 1
back 1
together 1
again 1
somewhere 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
will 1
be 1
creating 1
our 1
wardrobes 1
for 1
the 1
public 1
appearances 1
haymitch 1
and 1
effie 1
will 1
be 1
arranging 1
the 1
banquet 1
for 1
our 1
sponsors 1
reviewing 1
the 1
questions 1
for 1
our 1
final 1
interviews 1
back 1
home 1
district 1
is 1
probably 1
in 1
chaos 1
as 1
they 1
try 1
and 1
organize 1
the 1
homecoming 1
celebrations 1
for 1
peeta 1
and 1
me 1
given 1
that 1
the 1
last 1
one 1
was 1
close 1
to 1
thirty 1
years 1
ago 1
home 1
prim 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
gale 1
even 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
prims 1
scruffy 1
old 1
cat 1
makes 1
me 1
smile 1
soon 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
home 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
bed 1
to 1
see 1
peeta 1
and 1
cinna 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
more 1
about 1
whats 1
been 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
why 1
shouldnt 1
i 1
i 1
feel 1
fine 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
start 1
to 1
work 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
band 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
cold 1
liquid 1
seeping 1
into 1
my 1
vein 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
tubes 1
and 1
almost 1
immediately 1
lose 1
consciousness 1
this 1
happens 1
on 1
and 1
off 1
for 1
an 1
indeterminate 1
amount 1
of 1
time 1
my 1
waking 1
eating 1
and 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
resist 1
the 1
impulse 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
escape 1
the 1
bed 1
being 1
knocked 1
out 1
again 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
continual 1
twilight 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
things 1
register 1
the 1
redheaded 1
avox 1
girl 1
has 1
not 1
returned 1
since 1
the 1
feeding 1
my 1
scars 1
are 1
disappearing 1
and 1
do 1
i 1
imagine 1
it 1
or 1
do 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
mans 1
voice 1
yelling 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
accent 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
rougher 1
cadences 1
of 1
home 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
having 1
a 1
vague 1
comforting 1
feeling 1
that 1
someone 1
is 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
me 1
then 1
finally 1
the 1
time 1
arrives 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
and 1
theres 1
nothing 1
plugged 1
into 1
my 1
right 1
arm 1
the 1
restraint 1
around 1
my 1
middle 1
has 1
been 1
removed 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
free 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
i 1
start 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
but 1
am 1
arrested 1
by 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
the 1
skins 1
perfection 1
smooth 1
and 1
glowing 1
not 1
only 1
are 1
the 1
scars 1
from 1
the 1
arena 1
gone 1
but 1
those 1
accumulated 1
over 1
years 1
of 1
hunting 1
have 1
vanished 1
without 1
a 1
trace 1
my 1
forehead 1
feels 1
like 1
satin 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
burn 1
on 1
my 1
calf 1
theres 1
nothing 1
i 1
slip 1
my 1
legs 1

into 1
a 1
wide 1
deserted 1
hall 1

of 1

his 1
voice 1

a 1
voice 1

cinna 1
my 1
feet 1
take 1
off 1

hesitation 1
maybe 1
a 1
victor 1
should 1
show 1
more 1
restraint 1
more 1
superiority 1
especially 1
when 1
she 1
knows 1

relief 1

with 1
cinna 1
to 1
feel 1
his 1
protective 1
arm 1
around 1
my 1
shoulders 1
as 1
he 1
guides 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
cameras 1
down 1
a 1
few 1
passages 1
and 1
to 1
an 1
elevator 1
that 1
leads 1
to 1
the 1
lobby 1
of 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
the 1
hospital 1
then 1
is 1
far 1
underground 1
even 1
beneath 1
the 1
gym 1
where 1
the 1
tributes 1
practiced 1
tying 1
knots 1
and 1
throwing 1
spears 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
lobby 1
are 1
darkened 1
and 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
guards 1
stand 1
on 1
duty 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
is 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
us 1
cross 1
to 1
the 1
tribute 1
elevator 1
our 1
footsteps 1
echo 1
in 1
the 1
emptiness 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
ride 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
twelfth 1
floor 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
tributes 1
who 1
will 1
never 1
return 1
flash 1
across 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
theres 1
a 1
heavy 1
tight 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
chest 1
when 1
the 1
elevator 1
doors 1
open 1
venia 1
flavius 1
and 1
octavia 1
engulf 1
me 1
talking 1
so 1
quickly 1
and 1
ecstatically 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
out 1
their 1
words 1
the 1
sentiment 1
is 1
clear 1
though 1
they 1
are 1
truly 1
thrilled 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
im 1
happy 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
too 1
although 1
not 1
like 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
cinna 1
its 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
one 1
might 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
affectionate 1
trio 1
of 1
pets 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
particularly 1
difficult 1
day 1
they 1
sweep 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
and 1
i 1
get 1
a 1
real 1
meal 1
roast 1
beef 1
and 1
peas 1
and 1
soft 1
rolls 1
although 1
my 1
portions 1
are 1
still 1
being 1
strictly 1
controlled 1
because 1
when 1
i 1
ask 1
for 1
seconds 1
im 1
refused 1
no 1
no 1
no 1
they 1
dont 1
want 1
it 1
all 1
coming 1
back 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
says 1
octavia 1
but 1
she 1
secretly 1
slips 1
me 1
an 1
extra 1
roll 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
shes 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
we 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
cinna 1
disappears 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
as 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
gets 1
me 1
ready 1
oh 1
they 1
did 1
a 1
full 1
body 1
polish 1
on 1
you 1
says 1
flavius 1
enviously 1
not 1
a 1
flaw 1
left 1
on 1
your 1
skin 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
naked 1
body 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
is 1
how 1
skinny 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
mean 1
im 1
sure 1
i 1
was 1
worse 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
arena 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
easily 1
count 1
my 1
ribs 1
they 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
shower 1
settings 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
they 1
go 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
my 1
hair 1
nails 1
and 1
makeup 1
when 1
im 1
done 1
they 1
chatter 1
so 1
continuously 1
that 1
i 1
barely 1
have 1
to 1
reply 1
which 1
is 1
good 1
since 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
very 1
talkative 1
its 1
funny 1
because 1
even 1
though 1
theyre 1
rattling 1
on 1
about 1
the 1
games 1
its 1
all 1
about 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
or 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
doing 1
or 1
how 1
they 1
felt 1
when 1
a 1
specific 1
event 1
occurred 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
bed 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
had 1
my 1
eyebrows 1
dyed 1
i 1
swear 1
i 1
nearly 1
fainted 1
everything 1
is 1
about 1
them 1
not 1
the 1
dying 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
we 1
dont 1
wallow 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
this 1
way 1
in 1
district 1
we 1
grit 1
our 1
teeth 1
and 1
watch 1
because 1
we 1
must 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
business 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
when 1
theyre 1
over 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
hating 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
i 1
effectively 1
tune 1
out 1
most 1
of 1
what 1
theyre 1
saying 1
cinna 1
comes 1
in 1
with 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
unassuming 1
yellow 1
dress 1
across 1
his 1
arms 1
have 1
you 1
given 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
girl 1
on 1
fire 1
thing 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
slips 1
it 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
immediately 1
notice 1
the 1
padding 1
over 1
my 1
breasts 1
adding 1
curves 1
that 1
hunger 1
has 1
stolen 1
from 1
my 1
body 1
my 1
hands 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
chest 1
and 1
i 1
frown 1
i 1
know 1
says 1
cinna 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
object 1
but 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
wanted 1
to 1
alter 1
you 1
surgically 1
haymitch 1
had 1
a 1
huge 1
fight 1
with 1
them 1
over 1
it 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
compromise 1
he 1
stops 1
me 1
before 1
i 1
can 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
reflection 1
wait 1
dont 1
forget 1
the 1
shoes 1
venia 1
helps 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
flat 1
leather 1
sandals 1
and 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
mirror 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
the 1
girl 1
on 1
fire 1
the 1
sheer 1
fabric 1
softly 1
glows 1
even 1
the 1
slight 1
movement 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
sends 1
a 1
ripple 1
up 1
my 1
body 1
by 1
comparison 1
the 1
chariot 1
costume 1
seems 1
garish 1
the 1
interview 1
dress 1
too 1
contrived 1
in 1
this 1
dress 1
i 1
give 1
the 1
illusion 1
of 1
wearing 1
candlelight 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
asks 1
cinna 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
the 1
best 1
yet 1
i 1
say 1
when 1
i 1
manage 1
to 1
pull 1
my 1
eyes 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
flickering 1
fabric 1
im 1
in 1
for 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
shock 1
my 1
hairs 1
loose 1
held 1
back 1
by 1
a 1
simple 1
hairband 1
the 1
makeup 1
rounds 1
and 1
fills 1
out 1
the 1
sharp 1
angles 1
of 1
my 1
face 1
a 1
clear 1
polish 1
coats 1
my 1
nails 1
the 1
sleeveless 1
dress 1
is 1
gathered 1
at 1
my 1
ribs 1
not 1
my 1
waist 1
largely 1
eliminating 1
any 1
help 1
the 1
padding 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
my 1
figure 1
the 1
hem 1
falls 1
just 1
to 1
my 1
knees 1
without 1
heels 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
my 1
true 1
stature 1
i 1
look 1
very 1
simply 1
like 1
a 1
girl 1
a 1
young 1
one 1
fourteen 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
innocent 1
harmless 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
shocking 1
that 1
cinna 1
has 1
pulled 1
this 1
off 1
when 1
you 1
remember 1
ive 1
just 1
won 1
the 1
games 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
calculated 1
look 1
nothing 1
cinna 1
designs 1
is 1
arbitrary 1
i 1
bite 1
my 1
lip 1
trying 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
his 1
motivation 1
i 1
thought 1
itd 1
be 1
something 1
more 1
sophisticatedlooking 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
thought 1
peeta 1
would 1
like 1
this 1
better 1
he 1
answers 1
carefully 1
peeta 1
no 1
its 1
not 1
about 1
peeta 1
its 1
about 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
and 1
the 1
audience 1
although 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
yet 1
understand 1
cinnas 1
design 1
its 1
a 1
reminder 1
the 1
games 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
finished 1
and 1
beneath 1
his 1
benign 1
reply 1
i 1
sense 1
a 1
warning 1
of 1
something 1
he 1
cant 1
even 1
mention 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
team 1
we 1
take 1
the 1
elevator 1
to 1
the 1
level 1
where 1
we 1
trained 1
its 1
customary 1
for 1
the 1
victor 1
and 1
his 1
or 1
her 1
support 1
team 1
to 1
rise 1
from 1
beneath 1
the 1
stage 1
first 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
escort 1
the 1
stylist 1
the 1
mentor 1
and 1
finally 1
the 1
victor 1
only 1
this 1
year 1
with 1
two 1
victors 1
who 1
share 1
both 1
an 1
escort 1
and 1
a 1
mentor 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
has 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
rethought 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
poorly 1
lit 1
area 1
under 1
the 1
stage 1
a 1
brandnew 1
metal 1
plate 1
has 1
been 1
installed 1
to 1
transport 1
me 1
upward 1
you 1
can 1
still 1
see 1
small 1
piles 1
of 1
sawdust 1
smell 1
fresh 1
paint 1
cinna 1
and 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
peel 1
off 1
to 1
change 1
into 1
their 1
own 1
costumes 1
and 1
take 1
their 1
positions 1
leaving 1
me 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
makeshift 1
wall 1
about 1
ten 1
yards 1
away 1
and 1
assume 1
peetas 1
behind 1
it 1
the 1
rumbling 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
is 1
loud 1
so 1
i 1
dont 1
notice 1
haymitch 1
until 1
he 1
touches 1
my 1
shoulder 1
i 1
spring 1
away 1
startled 1
still 1
half 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
i 1
guess 1
easy 1
just 1
me 1
lets 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
you 1
haymitch 1
says 1
i 1
hold 1
out 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
turn 1
once 1
good 1
enough 1
its 1
not 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
compliment 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
haymitchs 1
eyes 1
shift 1
around 1
my 1
musty 1
holding 1
space 1
and 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
decision 1
but 1
nothing 1
how 1
about 1
a 1
hug 1
for 1
luck 1
okay 1
thats 1
an 1
odd 1
request 1
from 1
haymitch 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
we 1
are 1
victors 1
maybe 1
a 1
hug 1
for 1
luck 1
is 1
in 1
order 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
trapped 1
in 1
his 1
embrace 1
he 1
begins 1
talking 1
very 1
fast 1
very 1
quietly 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
my 1
hair 1
concealing 1
his 1
lips 1
listen 1
up 1
youre 1
in 1
trouble 1
word 1
is 1
the 1
capitols 1
furious 1
about 1
you 1
showing 1
them 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
they 1
cant 1
stand 1
is 1
being 1
laughed 1
at 1
and 1
theyre 1
the 1
joke 1
of 1
panem 1
says 1
haymitch 1
i 1
feel 1
dread 1
coursing 1
through 1
me 1
now 1
but 1
i 1
laugh 1
as 1
though 1
haymitch 1
is 1
saying 1
something 1
completely 1
delightful 1
because 1
nothing 1
is 1
covering 1
my 1
mouth 1
so 1
what 1
your 1
only 1
defense 1
can 1
be 1
you 1
were 1
so 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
you 1
werent 1
responsible 1
for 1
your 1
actions 1
haymitch 1
pulls 1
back 1
and 1
adjusts 1
my 1
hairband 1
got 1
it 1
sweetheart 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
talking 1
about 1
anything 1
now 1
got 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
did 1
you 1
tell 1
peeta 1
this 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
says 1
haymitch 1
hes 1
already 1
there 1
but 1
you 1
think 1
im 1
not 1
i 1
say 1
taking 1
the 1
opportunity 1
to 1
straighten 1
a 1
bright 1
red 1
bow 1
tie 1
cinna 1
must 1
have 1
wrestled 1
him 1
into 1
since 1
when 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
says 1
haymitch 1
better 1
take 1
our 1
places 1
he 1
leads 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
metal 1
circle 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
night 1
sweetheart 1
enjoy 1
it 1
he 1
kisses 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
forehead 1
and 1
disappears 1
into 1
the 1
gloom 1
i 1
tug 1
on 1
my 1
skirt 1
willing 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
longer 1
wanting 1
it 1
to 1
cover 1
the 1
knocking 1
in 1
my 1
knees 1
then 1
i 1
realize 1
its 1
pointless 1
my 1
whole 1
bodys 1
shaking 1
like 1
a 1
leaf 1
hopefully 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
put 1
down 1
to 1
excitement 1
after 1
all 1
its 1
my 1
night 1
the 1
damp 1
moldy 1
smell 1
beneath 1
the 1
stage 1
threatens 1
to 1
choke 1
me 1
a 1
cold 1
clammy 1
sweat 1
breaks 1
out 1
on 1
my 1
skin 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
rid 1
myself 1
of 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
the 1
boards 1
above 1
my 1
head 1
are 1
about 1
to 1
collapse 1
to 1
bury 1
me 1
alive 1
under 1
the 1
rubble 1
when 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
arena 1
when 1
the 1
trumpets 1
played 1
i 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
safe 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
but 1
if 1
what 1
haymitch 1
says 1
is 1
true 1
and 1
hes 1
got 1
no 1
reason 1
to 1
lie 1
ive 1
never 1
been 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
dangerous 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
its 1
so 1
much 1
worse 1
than 1
being 1
hunted 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
there 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
die 1
end 1
of 1
story 1
but 1
out 1
here 1
prim 1
my 1
mother 1
gale 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
district 1
everyone 1
i 1
care 1
about 1
back 1
home 1
could 1
be 1
punished 1
if 1
i 1
cant 1
pull 1
off 1
the 1
girldrivencrazybylove 1
scenario 1
haymitch 1
has 1
suggested 1
so 1
i 1
still 1
have 1
a 1
chance 1
though 1
funny 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
when 1
i 1
poured 1
out 1
those 1
berries 1
i 1
was 1
only 1
thinking 1
of 1
outsmarting 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
not 1
how 1
my 1
actions 1
would 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
capitol 1
but 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
are 1
their 1
weapon 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
defeat 1
it 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
capitol 1
will 1
act 1
as 1
if 1
theyve 1
been 1
in 1
control 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
orchestrated 1
the 1
whole 1
event 1
right 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
double 1
suicide 1
but 1
that 1
will 1
only 1
work 1
if 1
i 1
play 1
along 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
peeta 1
peeta 1
will 1
suffer 1
too 1
if 1
this 1
goes 1
wrong 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
haymitch 1
said 1
when 1
i 1
asked 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
peeta 1
the 1
situation 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
desperately 1
in 1
love 1
dont 1
have 1
to 1
hes 1
already 1
there 1
already 1
thinking 1
ahead 1
of 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
games 1
again 1
and 1
well 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
were 1
in 1
or 1
already 1
desperately 1
in 1
love 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
i 1
havent 1
even 1
begun 1
to 1
separate 1
out 1
my 1
feelings 1
about 1
peeta 1
its 1
too 1
complicated 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
as 1
opposed 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
out 1
of 1
anger 1
at 1
the 1
capitol 1
or 1
because 1
of 1
how 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
viewed 1
back 1
in 1
district 1
or 1
simply 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
decent 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
because 1
i 1
cared 1
about 1
him 1
these 1
are 1
questions 1
to 1
be 1
unraveled 1
back 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
peace 1
and 1
quiet 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
no 1
one 1
is 1
watching 1
not 1
here 1
with 1
every 1
eye 1
upon 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
that 1
luxury 1
for 1
who 1
knows 1
how 1
long 1
and 1
right 1
now 1
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
anthem 1
booms 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
hear 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
greeting 1
the 1
audience 1
does 1
he 1
know 1
how 1
crucial 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
every 1
word 1
right 1
from 1
now 1
on 1
he 1
must 1
he 1
will 1
want 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
the 1
crowd 1
breaks 1
into 1
applause 1
as 1
the 1
prep 1
teams 1
are 1
presented 1
i 1
imagine 1
flavius 1
venia 1
and 1
octavia 1
bouncing 1
around 1
and 1
taking 1
ridiculous 1
bobbing 1
bows 1
its 1
a 1
safe 1
bet 1
theyre 1
clueless 1
then 1
effies 1
introduced 1
how 1
long 1
shes 1
waited 1
for 1
this 1
moment 1
i 1
hope 1
shes 1
able 1
to 1
enjoy 1
it 1
because 1
as 1
misguided 1
as 1
effie 1
can 1
be 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
keen 1
instinct 1
about 1
certain 1
things 1
and 1
must 1
at 1
least 1
suspect 1
were 1
in 1
trouble 1
portia 1
and 1
cinna 1
receive 1
huge 1
cheers 1
of 1
course 1
theyve 1
been 1
brilliant 1
had 1
a 1
dazzling 1
debut 1
i 1
now 1
understand 1
cinnas 1
choice 1
of 1
dress 1
for 1
me 1
for 1
tonight 1
ill 1
need 1
to 1
look 1
as 1
girlish 1
and 1
innocent 1
as 1
possible 1
haymitchs 1
appearance 1
brings 1
a 1
round 1
of 1
stomping 1
that 1
goes 1
on 1
at 1
least 1
five 1
minutes 1
well 1
hes 1
accomplished 1
a 1
first 1
keeping 1
not 1
only 1
one 1
but 1
two 1
tributes 1
alive 1
what 1
if 1
he 1
hadnt 1
warned 1
me 1
in 1
time 1
would 1
i 1
have 1
acted 1
differently 1
flaunted 1
the 1
moment 1
with 1
the 1
berries 1
in 1
the 1
capitols 1
face 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
easily 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
lot 1
less 1
convincing 1
than 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
now 1
right 1
now 1
because 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
the 1
plate 1
lifting 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
blinding 1
lights 1
the 1
deafening 1
roar 1
rattles 1
the 1
metal 1
under 1
my 1
feet 1
then 1
theres 1
peeta 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
away 1
he 1
looks 1
so 1
clean 1
and 1
healthy 1
and 1
beautiful 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
recognize 1
him 1
but 1
his 1
smile 1
is 1
the 1
same 1
whether 1
in 1
mud 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
capitol 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
i 1
take 1
about 1
three 1
steps 1
and 1
fling 1
myself 1
into 1
his 1
arms 1
he 1
staggers 1
back 1
almost 1
losing 1
his 1
balance 1
and 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
realize 1
the 1
slim 1
metal 1
contraption 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
is 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
cane 1
he 1
rights 1
himself 1
and 1
we 1
just 1
cling 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
while 1
the 1
audience 1
goes 1
insane 1
hes 1
kissing 1
me 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
im 1
thinking 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
much 1
danger 1
were 1
in 1
after 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
of 1
this 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
taps 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
to 1
continue 1
the 1
show 1
and 1
peeta 1
just 1
pushes 1
him 1
aside 1
without 1
even 1
glancing 1
at 1
him 1
the 1
audience 1
goes 1
berserk 1
whether 1
he 1
knows 1
or 1
not 1
peeta 1
is 1
as 1
usual 1
playing 1
the 1
crowd 1
exactly 1
right 1
finally 1
haymitch 1
interrupts 1
us 1
and 1
gives 1
us 1
a 1
goodnatured 1
shove 1
toward 1
the 1
victors 1
chair 1
usually 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
single 1
ornate 1
chair 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
winning 1
tribute 1
watches 1
a 1
film 1
of 1
the 1
highlights 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
but 1
since 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
the 1
gamemakers 1
have 1
provided 1
a 1
plush 1
red 1
velvet 1
couch 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
my 1
mother 1
would 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
love 1
seat 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
sit 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
peeta 1
that 1
im 1
practically 1
on 1
his 1
lap 1
but 1
one 1
look 1
from 1
haymitch 1
tells 1
me 1
it 1
isnt 1
enough 1
kicking 1
off 1
my 1
sandals 1
i 1
tuck 1
my 1
feet 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
and 1
lean 1
my 1
head 1
against 1
peetas 1
shoulder 1
his 1
arm 1
goes 1
around 1
me 1
automatically 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
im 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
curled 1
up 1
against 1
him 1
trying 1
to 1
keep 1
warm 1
his 1
shirt 1
is 1
made 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
yellow 1
material 1
as 1
my 1
dress 1
but 1
portias 1
put 1
him 1
in 1
long 1
black 1
pants 1
no 1
sandals 1
either 1
but 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
sturdy 1
black 1
boots 1
he 1
keeps 1
solidly 1
planted 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
i 1
wish 1
cinna 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
similar 1
outfit 1
i 1
feel 1
so 1
vulnerable 1
in 1
this 1
flimsy 1
dress 1
but 1
i 1
guess 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
point 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
makes 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
jokes 1
and 1
then 1
its 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
show 1
this 1
will 1
last 1
exactly 1
three 1
hours 1
and 1
is 1
required 1
viewing 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
panem 1
as 1
the 1
lights 1
dim 1
and 1
the 1
seal 1
appears 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
i 1
realize 1
im 1
unprepared 1
for 1
this 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
watch 1
my 1
twentytwo 1
fellow 1
tributes 1
die 1
i 1
saw 1
enough 1
of 1
them 1
die 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
my 1
heart 1
starts 1
pounding 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
strong 1
impulse 1
to 1
run 1
how 1
have 1
the 1
other 1
victors 1
faced 1
this 1
alone 1
during 1
the 1
highlights 1
they 1
periodically 1
show 1
the 1
winners 1
reaction 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
box 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
screen 1
i 1
think 1
back 1
to 1
earlier 1
years 1
some 1
are 1
triumphant 1
pumping 1
their 1
fists 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
beating 1
their 1
chests 1
most 1
just 1
seem 1
stunned 1
all 1
i 1
know 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
keeping 1
me 1
on 1
this 1
love 1
seat 1
is 1
peeta 1
his 1
arm 1
around 1
my 1
shoulder 1
his 1
other 1
hand 1
claimed 1
by 1
both 1
of 1
mine 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
previous 1
victors 1
didnt 1
have 1
the 1
capitol 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
destroy 1
them 1
condensing 1
several 1
weeks 1
into 1
three 1
hours 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
feat 1
especially 1
when 1
you 1
consider 1
how 1
many 1
cameras 1
were 1
going 1
at 1
once 1
whoever 1
puts 1
together 1
the 1
highlights 1
has 1
to 1
choose 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
story 1
to 1
tell 1
this 1
year 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
they 1
tell 1
a 1
love 1
story 1
i 1
know 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
won 1
but 1
a 1
disproportionate 1
amount 1
of 1
time 1
is 1
spent 1
on 1
us 1
right 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
im 1
glad 1
though 1
because 1
it 1
supports 1
the 1
whole 1
crazyinlove 1
thing 1
thats 1
my 1
defense 1
for 1
defying 1
the 1
capitol 1
plus 1
it 1
means 1
we 1
wont 1
have 1
as 1
much 1
time 1
to 1
linger 1
over 1
the 1
deaths 1
the 1
first 1
half 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
focuses 1
on 1
the 1
prearena 1
events 1
the 1
reaping 1
the 1
chariot 1
ride 1
through 1
the 1
capitol 1
our 1
training 1
scores 1
and 1
our 1
interviews 1
theres 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
upbeat 1
soundtrack 1
playing 1
under 1
it 1
that 1
makes 1
it 1
twice 1
as 1
awful 1
because 1
of 1
course 1
almost 1
everyone 1
onscreen 1
is 1
dead 1
once 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
theres 1
detailed 1
coverage 1
of 1
the 1
bloodbath 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
filmmakers 1
basically 1
alternate 1
between 1
shots 1
of 1
tributes 1
dying 1
and 1
shots 1
of 1
us 1
mostly 1
peeta 1
really 1
theres 1
no 1
question 1
hes 1
carrying 1
this 1
romance 1
thing 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
audience 1
saw 1
how 1
he 1
misled 1
the 1
careers 1
about 1
me 1
stayed 1
awake 1
the 1
entire 1
night 1
under 1
the 1
tracker 1
jacker 1
tree 1
fought 1
cato 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
escape 1
and 1
even 1
while 1
he 1
lay 1
in 1
that 1
mud 1
bank 1
whispered 1
my 1
name 1
in 1
his 1
sleep 1
i 1
seem 1
heartless 1
in 1
comparison 1
dodging 1
fireballs 1
dropping 1
nests 1
and 1
blowing 1
up 1
supplies 1
until 1
i 1
go 1
hunting 1
for 1
rue 1
they 1
play 1
her 1
death 1
in 1
full 1
the 1
spearing 1
my 1
failed 1
rescue 1
attempt 1
my 1
arrow 1
through 1
the 1
boy 1
from 1
district 1
s 1
throat 1
rue 1
drawing 1
her 1
last 1
breath 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
the 1
song 1
i 1
get 1
to 1
sing 1
every 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
song 1
something 1
inside 1
me 1
shuts 1
down 1
and 1
im 1
too 1
numb 1
to 1
feel 1
anything 1
its 1
like 1
watching 1
complete 1
strangers 1
in 1
another 1
hunger 1
games 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
notice 1
they 1
omit 1
the 1
part 1
where 1
i 1
covered 1
her 1
in 1
flowers 1
right 1
because 1
even 1
that 1
smacks 1
of 1
rebellion 1
things 1
pick 1
up 1
for 1
me 1
once 1
theyve 1
announced 1
two 1
tributes 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
district 1
can 1
live 1
and 1
i 1
shout 1
out 1
peetas 1
name 1
and 1
then 1
clap 1
my 1
hands 1
over 1
my 1
mouth 1
if 1
ive 1
seemed 1
indifferent 1
to 1
him 1
earlier 1
i 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
it 1
now 1
by 1
finding 1
him 1
nursing 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
health 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
for 1
the 1
medicine 1
and 1
being 1
very 1
free 1
with 1
my 1
kisses 1
objectively 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
mutts 1
and 1
catos 1
death 1
are 1
as 1
gruesome 1
as 1
ever 1
but 1
again 1
i 1
feel 1
it 1
happens 1
to 1
people 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
and 1
then 1
comes 1
the 1
moment 1
with 1
the 1
berries 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
audience 1
hushing 1
one 1
another 1
not 1
wanting 1
to 1
miss 1
anything 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
gratitude 1
to 1
the 1
filmmakers 1
sweeps 1
over 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
end 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
announcement 1
of 1
our 1
victory 1
but 1
with 1
me 1
pounding 1
on 1
the 1
glass 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
hovercraft 1
screaming 1
peetas 1
name 1
as 1
they 1
try 1
to 1
revive 1
him 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
survival 1
its 1
my 1
best 1
moment 1
all 1
night 1
the 1
anthems 1
playing 1
yet 1
again 1
and 1
we 1
rise 1
as 1
president 1
snow 1
himself 1
takes 1
the 1
stage 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
carrying 1
a 1
cushion 1
that 1
holds 1
the 1
crown 1
theres 1
just 1
one 1
crown 1
though 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
the 1
crowds 1
confusion 1
whose 1
head 1
will 1
he 1
place 1
it 1
on 1
until 1
president 1
snow 1
gives 1
it 1
a 1
twist 1
and 1
it 1
separates 1
into 1
two 1
halves 1
he 1
places 1
the 1
first 1
around 1
peetas 1
brow 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
hes 1
still 1
smiling 1
when 1
he 1
settles 1
the 1
second 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
just 1
inches 1
from 1
mine 1
are 1
as 1
unforgiving 1
as 1
a 1
snakes 1
thats 1
when 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
even 1
though 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
would 1
have 1
eaten 1
the 1
berries 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
blame 1
for 1
having 1
the 1
idea 1
im 1
the 1
instigator 1
im 1
the 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
punished 1
much 1
bowing 1
and 1
cheering 1
follows 1
my 1
arm 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
fall 1
off 1
from 1
waving 1
when 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
finally 1
bids 1
the 1
audience 1
good 1
night 1
reminding 1
them 1
to 1
tune 1
in 1
tomorrow 1
for 1
the 1
final 1
interviews 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
choice 1
peeta 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
whisked 1
to 1
the 1
presidents 1
mansion 1
for 1
the 1
victory 1
banquet 1
where 1
we 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
time 1
to 1
eat 1
as 1
capitol 1
officials 1
and 1
particularly 1
generous 1
sponsors 1
elbow 1
one 1
another 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
as 1
they 1
try 1
to 1
get 1
their 1
picture 1
with 1
us 1
face 1
after 1
beaming 1
face 1
flashes 1
by 1
becoming 1
increasingly 1
intoxicated 1
as 1
the 1
evening 1
wears 1
on 1
occasionally 1
i 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
haymitch 1
which 1
is 1
reassuring 1
or 1
president 1
snow 1
which 1
is 1
terrifying 1
but 1
i 1
keep 1
laughing 1
and 1
thanking 1
people 1
and 1
smiling 1
as 1
my 1
picture 1
is 1
taken 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
i 1
never 1
do 1
is 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
peetas 1
hand 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
just 1
peeking 1
over 1
the 1
horizon 1
when 1
we 1
straggle 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
twelfth 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
training 1
center 1
i 1
think 1
now 1
ill 1
finally 1
get 1
a 1
word 1
alone 1
with 1
peeta 1
but 1
haymitch 1
sends 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
portia 1
to 1
get 1
something 1
fitted 1
for 1
the 1
interview 1
and 1
personally 1
escorts 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
door 1
why 1
cant 1
i 1
talk 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
ask 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
for 1
talk 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
home 1
says 1
haymitch 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
youre 1
on 1
air 1
at 1
two 1
despite 1
haymitchs 1
running 1
interference 1
im 1
determined 1
to 1
see 1
peeta 1
privately 1
after 1
i 1
toss 1
and 1
turn 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
i 1
slip 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
is 1
to 1
check 1
the 1
roof 1
but 1
its 1
empty 1
even 1
the 1
city 1
streets 1
far 1
below 1
are 1
deserted 1
after 1
the 1
celebration 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
bed 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
decide 1
to 1
go 1
directly 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
knob 1
i 1
find 1
my 1
own 1
bedroom 1
door 1
has 1
been 1
locked 1
from 1
the 1
outside 1
i 1
suspect 1
haymitch 1
initially 1
but 1
then 1
theres 1
a 1
more 1
insidious 1
fear 1
that 1
the 1
capitol 1
may 1
by 1
monitoring 1
and 1
confining 1
me 1
ive 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
escape 1
since 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
began 1
but 1
this 1
feels 1
different 1
much 1
more 1
personal 1
this 1
feels 1
like 1
ive 1
been 1
imprisoned 1
for 1
a 1
crime 1
and 1
im 1
awaiting 1
sentencing 1
i 1
quickly 1
get 1
back 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
sleep 1
until 1
effie 1
trinket 1
comes 1
to 1
alert 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
start 1
of 1
another 1
big 1
big 1
big 1
day 1
i 1
have 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
to 1
eat 1
a 1
bowl 1
of 1
hot 1
grain 1
and 1
stew 1
before 1
the 1
prep 1
team 1
descends 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
the 1
crowd 1
loved 1
you 1
and 1
its 1
unnecessary 1
to 1
speak 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
when 1
cinna 1
comes 1
in 1
he 1
shoos 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
dresses 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
white 1
gauzy 1
dress 1
and 1
pink 1
shoes 1
then 1
he 1
personally 1
adjusts 1
my 1
makeup 1
until 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
radiate 1
a 1
soft 1
rosy 1
glow 1
we 1
make 1
idle 1
chitchat 1
but 1
im 1
afraid 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
anything 1
of 1
real 1
importance 1
because 1
after 1
the 1
incident 1
with 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
cant 1
shake 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
im 1
being 1
watched 1
constantly 1
the 1
interview 1
takes 1
place 1
right 1
down 1
the 1
hall 1
in 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
a 1
space 1

president 1

arranging 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
accident 1
for 1

as 1
we 1
speak 1
then 1
peetas 1
there 1
looking 1
handsome 1
in 1
red 1
and 1
white 1
pulling 1
me 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
side 1

hardly 1

to 1
see 1
you 1
haymitch 1

bent 1
on 1
keeping 1
us 1
apart 1
haymitch 1
is 1
actually 1
bent 1
on 1
keeping 1
us 1
alive 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
too 1
many 1
ears 1
listening 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
say 1
yes 1
hes 1
gotten 1
very 1
responsible 1
lately 1
well 1
theres 1
just 1
this 1
and 1
we 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
he 1
cant 1
watch 1
us 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
shiver 1
run 1
through 1
me 1
and 1
theres 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
analyze 1
why 1
because 1
theyre 1
ready 1
for 1
us 1
we 1
sit 1
somewhat 1
formally 1
on 1
the 1
love 1
seat 1
but 1
caesar 1
says 1
oh 1
go 1
ahead 1
and 1
curl 1
up 1
next 1
to 1
him 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
looked 1
very 1
sweet 1
so 1
i 1
tuck 1
my 1
feet 1
up 1
and 1
peeta 1
pulls 1
me 1
in 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
someone 1
counts 1
backward 1
and 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
were 1
being 1
broadcast 1
live 1
to 1
the 1
entire 1
country 1
caesar 1
flickerman 1
is 1
wonderful 1
teasing 1
joking 1
getting 1
choked 1
up 1
when 1
the 1
occasion 1
presents 1
itself 1
he 1
and 1
peeta 1
already 1
have 1
the 1
rapport 1
they 1
established 1
that 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
interview 1
that 1
easy 1
banter 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
smile 1
a 1
lot 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
speak 1
as 1
little 1
as 1
possible 1
i 1
mean 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
talk 1
some 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
i 1
redirect 1
the 1
conversation 1
back 1
to 1
peeta 1
eventually 1
though 1
caesar 1
begins 1
to 1
pose 1
questions 1
that 1
insist 1
on 1
fuller 1
answers 1
well 1
peeta 1
we 1
know 1
from 1
our 1
days 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
love 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
for 1
you 1
from 1
what 1
age 1
five 1
caesar 1
says 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
laid 1
eyes 1
on 1
her 1
says 1
peeta 1
but 1
katniss 1
what 1
a 1
ride 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
think 1
the 1
real 1
excitement 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
was 1
watching 1
you 1
fall 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
did 1
you 1
realize 1
you 1
were 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
him 1
asks 1
caesar 1
oh 1
thats 1
a 1
hard 1
one 1
i 1
give 1
a 1
faint 1
breathy 1
laugh 1
and 1
look 1
down 1
at 1
my 1
hands 1
help 1
well 1
i 1
know 1
when 1
it 1
hit 1
me 1
the 1
night 1
when 1
you 1
shouted 1
out 1
his 1
name 1
from 1
that 1
tree 1
says 1
caesar 1
thank 1
you 1
caesar 1
i 1
think 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
with 1
his 1
idea 1
yes 1
i 1
guess 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
i 1
mean 1
until 1
that 1
point 1
i 1
just 1
tried 1
not 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
what 1
my 1
feelings 1
might 1
be 1
honestly 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
confusing 1
and 1
it 1
only 1
made 1
things 1
worse 1
if 1
i 1
actually 1
cared 1
about 1
him 1
but 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
everything 1
changed 1
i 1
say 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
was 1
urges 1
caesar 1
maybe 1
because 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
i 1
could 1
keep 1
him 1
i 1
say 1
behind 1
a 1
cameraman 1
i 1
see 1
haymitch 1
give 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
huff 1
with 1
relief 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
ive 1
said 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
caesar 1
pulls 1
out 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
moment 1
because 1
hes 1
so 1
moved 1
i 1
can 1
feel 1
peeta 1
press 1
his 1
forehead 1
into 1
my 1
temple 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
so 1
now 1
that 1
youve 1
got 1
me 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
turn 1
in 1
to 1
him 1
put 1
you 1
somewhere 1
you 1
cant 1
get 1
hurt 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
kisses 1
me 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
actually 1
sigh 1
for 1
caesar 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
natural 1
place 1
to 1
segue 1
into 1
all 1
the 1
ways 1
we 1
did 1
get 1
hurt 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
from 1
burns 1
to 1
stings 1
to 1
wounds 1
but 1
its 1
not 1
until 1
we 1
get 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
mutts 1
that 1
i 1
forget 1
im 1
on 1
camera 1
when 1
caesar 1
asks 1
peeta 1
how 1
his 1
new 1
leg 1
is 1
working 1
out 1
new 1
leg 1
i 1
say 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
reaching 1
out 1
and 1
pulling 1
up 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
peetas 1
pants 1
oh 1
no 1
i 1
whisper 1
taking 1
in 1
the 1
metalandplastic 1
device 1
that 1
has 1
replaced 1
his 1
flesh 1
no 1
one 1
told 1
you 1
asks 1
caesar 1
gently 1
i 1
shake 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
havent 1
had 1
the 1
chance 1
says 1
peeta 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
shrug 1
its 1
my 1
fault 1
i 1
say 1
because 1
i 1
used 1
that 1
tourniquet 1
yes 1
its 1
your 1
fault 1
im 1
alive 1
says 1
peeta 1
hes 1
right 1
says 1
caesar 1
hed 1
have 1
bled 1
to 1
death 1
for 1
sure 1
without 1
it 1
i 1
guess 1
this 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
feeling 1
upset 1
about 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
extent 1
that 1
im 1
afraid 1
i 1
might 1
cry 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
remember 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
is 1
watching 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
bury 1
my 1
face 1
in 1
peetas 1
shirt 1
it 1
takes 1
them 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
minutes 1
to 1
coax 1
me 1
back 1
out 1
because 1
its 1
better 1
in 1
the 1
shirt 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
do 1
come 1
out 1
caesar 1
backs 1
off 1
questioning 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
recover 1
in 1
fact 1
he 1
pretty 1
much 1
leaves 1
me 1
alone 1
until 1
the 1
berries 1
come 1
up 1
katniss 1
i 1
know 1
youve 1
had 1
a 1
shock 1
but 1
ive 1
got 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
you 1
pulled 1
out 1
those 1
berries 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
your 1
mind 1
hm 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
before 1
i 1
answer 1
trying 1
to 1
collect 1
my 1
thoughts 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
crucial 1
moment 1
where 1
i 1
either 1
challenged 1
the 1
capitol 1
or 1
went 1
so 1
crazy 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
losing 1
peeta 1
that 1
i 1
cant 1
be 1
held 1
responsible 1
for 1
my 1
actions 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
a 1
big 1
dramatic 1
speech 1
but 1
all 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
is 1
one 1
almost 1
inaudible 1
sentence 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
i 1
just 1
couldnt 1
bear 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
being 1
without 1
him 1
peeta 1
anything 1
to 1
add 1
asks 1
caesar 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
goes 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
he 1
says 1
caesar 1
signs 1
off 1
and 1
its 1
over 1
everyones 1
laughing 1
and 1
crying 1
and 1
hugging 1
but 1
im 1
still 1
not 1
sure 1
until 1
i 1
reach 1
haymitch 1
okay 1
i 1
whisper 1
perfect 1
he 1
answers 1
i 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
to 1
collect 1
a 1
few 1
things 1
and 1
find 1
theres 1
nothing 1
to 1
take 1
but 1
the 1
mockingjay 1
pin 1
madge 1
gave 1
me 1
someone 1
returned 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
after 1
the 1
games 1
they 1
drive 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
in 1
a 1
car 1
with 1
blackened 1
windows 1
and 1
the 1
trains 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
we 1
barely 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
cinna 1
and 1
portia 1
although 1
well 1
see 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
when 1
we 1
tour 1
the 1
districts 1
for 1
a 1
round 1
of 1
victory 1
ceremonies 1
its 1
the 1
capitols 1
way 1
of 1
reminding 1
people 1
that 1
the 1
hunger 1
games 1
never 1
really 1
go 1
away 1
well 1
be 1
given 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
useless 1
plaques 1
and 1
everyone 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
pretend 1
they 1
love 1
us 1
the 1
train 1
begins 1
moving 1
and 1
were 1
plunged 1
into 1
night 1
until 1
we 1
clear 1
the 1
tunnel 1
and 1
i 1
take 1
my 1
first 1
free 1
breath 1
since 1
the 1
reaping 1
effie 1
is 1
accompanying 1
us 1
back 1
and 1
haymitch 1
too 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
eat 1
an 1
enormous 1
dinner 1
and 1
settle 1
into 1
silence 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
television 1
to 1
watch 1
a 1
replay 1
of 1
the 1
interview 1
with 1
the 1
capitol 1
growing 1
farther 1
away 1
every 1
second 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
home 1
of 1
prim 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
of 1
gale 1
i 1
excuse 1
myself 1
to 1

out 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
into 1
a 1
plain 1
shirt 1
and 1
pants 1
as 1
i 1
slowly 1
thoroughly 1
wash 1
the 1
makeup 1
from 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
put 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
its 1
braid 1
i 1
begin 1
transforming 1
back 1
into 1
myself 1
katniss 1

girl 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1

stare 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1

try 1
to 1
remember 1
who 1
i 1

and 1
who 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
i 1

the 1
others 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
peetas 1
arm 1
around 1
my 1
shoulders 1
feels 1
alien 1
when 1
the 1

brief 1
stop 1

the 1
hours 1
ive 1
spent 1
gathering 1
them 1
with 1
gale 1
gale 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
seeing 1
gale 1
in 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
hours 1
makes 1
my 1
stomach 1
churn 1
but 1
why 1
i 1
cant 1
quite 1
frame 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
only 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
feel 1
like 1
ive 1
been 1
lying 1
to 1
someone 1
who 1
trusts 1
me 1
or 1
more 1
accurately 1
to 1
two 1
people 1
ive 1
been 1
getting 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
point 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
games 1
but 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
games 1
to 1
hide 1
behind 1
back 1
home 1
whats 1
wrong 1
peeta 1
asks 1
nothing 1
i 1
answer 1
we 1
continue 1
walking 1
past 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
train 1
out 1
where 1
even 1
im 1
fairly 1
sure 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
cameras 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
scrubby 1
bushes 1
along 1
the 1
track 1
still 1
no 1
words 1
come 1
haymitch 1
startles 1
me 1
when 1
he 1
lays 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
my 1
back 1
even 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
nowhere 1
he 1
keeps 1
his 1
voice 1
down 1
great 1
job 1
you 1
two 1
just 1
keep 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
district 1
until 1
the 1
cameras 1
are 1
gone 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
okay 1
i 1
watch 1
him 1
head 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
train 1
avoiding 1
peetas 1
eyes 1
whats 1
he 1
mean 1
peeta 1
asks 1
me 1
its 1
the 1
capitol 1
they 1
didnt 1
like 1
our 1
stunt 1
with 1
the 1
berries 1
i 1
blurt 1
out 1
what 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
talking 1
about 1
he 1
says 1
it 1
seemed 1
too 1
rebellious 1
so 1
haymitch 1
has 1
been 1
coaching 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
make 1
it 1
worse 1
i 1
say 1
coaching 1
you 1
but 1
not 1
me 1
says 1
peeta 1
he 1
knew 1
you 1
were 1
smart 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
right 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
to 1
get 1
right 1
says 1
peeta 1
so 1
what 1
youre 1
saying 1
is 1
these 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
guess 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
that 1
was 1
just 1
some 1
strategy 1
you 1
two 1
worked 1
out 1
no 1
i 1
mean 1
i 1
couldnt 1
even 1
talk 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
could 1
i 1
i 1
stammer 1
but 1
you 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
didnt 1
you 1
says 1
peeta 1
i 1
bite 1
my 1
lip 1
katniss 1
he 1
drops 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
step 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
catch 1
my 1
balance 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
for 1
the 1
games 1
peeta 1
says 1
how 1
you 1
acted 1
not 1
all 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
say 1
tightly 1
holding 1
onto 1
my 1
flowers 1
then 1
how 1
much 1
no 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
guess 1
the 1
real 1
question 1
is 1
whats 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
home 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
the 1
closer 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
district 1
twelve 1
the 1
more 1
confused 1
i 1
get 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
waits 1
for 1
further 1
explanation 1
but 1
nones 1
forthcoming 1
well 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
when 1
you 1
work 1
it 1
out 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
is 1
palpable 1
i 1
know 1
my 1
ears 1
are 1
healed 1
because 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
the 1
engine 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
every 1
step 1
he 1
takes 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
train 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
ive 1
climbed 1
aboard 1
peeta 1
has 1
disappiared 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
him 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
either 1
in 1
fact 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
turns 1
up 1
were 1
pulling 1
into 1
district 1
he 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
nod 1
his 1
face 1
expressionless 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
hes 1
not 1
being 1
fair 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
strangers 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
what 1
it 1
took 1
to 1
stay 1
alive 1
to 1
keep 1
us 1
both 1
alive 1
in 1
the 1
arena 1
that 1
i 1
cant 1
explain 1
how 1
things 1
are 1
with 1
gale 1
because 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
myself 1
that 1
its 1
no 1
good 1
loving 1
me 1
because 1
im 1
never 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
married 1
anyway 1
and 1
hed 1
just 1
end 1
up 1
hating 1
me 1
later 1
instead 1
of 1
sooner 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
have 1
feelings 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
doesnt 1
matter 1
because 1
ill 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
afford 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
love 1
that 1
leads 1
to 1
a 1
family 1
to 1
children 1
and 1
how 1
can 1
he 1
how 1
can 1
he 1
after 1
what 1
weve 1
just 1
been 1
through 1
i 1
also 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
how 1
much 1
i 1
already 1
miss 1
him 1
but 1
that 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
fair 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
so 1
we 1
just 1
stand 1
there 1
silently 1
watching 1
our 1
grimy 1
little 1
station 1
rise 1
up 1
around 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
platforms 1
thick 1
with 1
cameras 1
everyone 1
will 1
be 1
eagerly 1
watching 1
our 1
homecoming 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
my 1
eye 1
i 1
see 1
peeta 1
extend 1
his 1
hand 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
unsure 1
one 1
more 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
audience 1
he 1
says 1
his 1
voice 1
isnt 1
angry 1
its 1
hollow 1
which 1
is 1
worse 1
already 1
the 1
boy 1
with 1
the 1
bread 1
is 1
slipping 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
take 1
his 1
hand 1
holding 1
on 1
tightly 1
preparing 1
for 1
the 1
cameras 1
and 1
dreading 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1

st 10
may 10
arriving 10
at 10
vienna 10
early 10
next 10
morning 10
should 10
have 10
arrived 10
at 10
but 10
train 10
was 10
an 10
hour 10
late 10
budapesth 10
seems 10
a 10
wonderful 10
place 10
from 10
the 10
glimpse 10
which 10
i 10
got 10
of 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
train 10
and 10
the 10
little 10
i 10
could 10
walk 10
through 10
the 10
streets 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
go 10
very 10
far 10
from 10
the 10
station 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
arrived 10
late 10
and 10
would 10
start 10
as 10
near 10
the 10
correct 10
time 10
as 10
possible 10
the 10
impression 10
i 10
had 10
was 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
leaving 10
the 10
west 10
and 10
entering 10
the 10
east 10
the 10
most 10
western 10
of 10
splendid 10
bridges 10
over 10
the 10
danube 10
which 10
is 10
here 10
of 10
noble 10
width 10
and 10
depth 10
took 10
us 10
among 10
the 10
traditions 10
of 10
turkish 10
rule 10
we 10
left 10
in 10
pretty 10
good 10
time 10
and 10
came 10
after 10
nightfall 10
to 10
klausenburgh 10
here 10
i 10
stopped 10
for 10
the 10
night 10
at 10
the 10
hotel 10
royale 10
i 10
had 10
for 10
dinner 10
or 10
rather 10
supper 10
a 10
chicken 10
done 10
up 10
some 10
way 10
with 10
red 10
pepper 10
which 10
was 10
very 10
good 10
but 10
thirsty 10
mem 10
get 10
recipe 10
for 10
mina 10
i 10
asked 10
the 10
waiter 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
it 10
was 10
called 10
paprika 10
hendl 10
and 10
that 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
national 10
dish 10
i 10
should 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
get 10
it 10
anywhere 10
along 10
the 10
carpathians 10
i 10
found 10
my 10
smattering 10
of 10
german 10
very 10
useful 10
here 10
indeed 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
how 10
i 10
should 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
get 10
on 10
without 10
it 10
having 10
had 10
some 10
time 10
at 10
my 10
disposal 10
when 10
in 10
london 10
i 10
had 10
visited 10
the 10
british 10
museum 10
and 10
made 10
search 10
among 10
the 10
books 10
and 10
maps 10
in 10
the 10
library 10
regarding 10
transylvania 10
it 10
had 10
struck 10
me 10
that 10
some 10
foreknowledge 10
of 10
the 10
country 10
could 10
hardly 10
fail 10
to 10
have 10
some 10
importance 10
in 10
dealing 10
with 10
a 10
nobleman 10
of 10
that 10
country 10
i 10
find 10
that 10
the 10
district 10
he 10
named 10
is 10
in 10
the 10
extreme 10
east 10
of 10
the 10
country 10
just 10
on 10
the 10
borders 10
of 10
three 10
states 10
transylvania 10
moldavia 10
and 10
bukovina 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
the 10
carpathian 10
mountains 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
wildest 10
and 10
least 10
known 10
portions 10
of 10
europe 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
able 10
to 10
light 10
on 10
any 10
map 10
or 10
work 10
giving 10
the 10
exact 10
locality 10
of 10
the 10
castle 10
dracula 10
as 10
there 10
are 10
no 10
maps 10
of 10
this 10
country 10
as 10
yet 10
to 10
compare 10
with 10
our 10
own 10
ordance 10
survey 10
maps 10
but 10
i 10
found 10
that 10
bistritz 10
the 10
post 10
town 10
named 10
by 10
count 10
dracula 10
is 10
a 10
fairly 10
wellknown 10
place 10
i 10
shall 10
enter 10
here 10
some 10
of 10
my 10
notes 10
as 10
they 10
may 10
refresh 10
my 10
memory 10
when 10
i 10
talk 10
over 10
my 10
travels 10
with 10
mina 10
in 10
the 10
population 10
of 10
transylvania 10
there 10
are 10
four 10
distinct 10
nationalities 10
saxons 10
in 10
the 10
south 10
and 10
mixed 10
with 10
them 10
the 10
wallachs 10
who 10
are 10
the 10
descendants 10
of 10
the 10
dacians 10
magyars 10
in 10
the 10
west 10
and 10
szekelys 10
in 10
the 10
east 10
and 10
north 10
i 10
am 10
going 10
among 10
the 10
latter 10
who 10
claim 10
to 10
be 10
descended 10
from 10
attila 10
and 10
the 10
huns 10
this 10
may 10
be 10
so 10
for 10
when 10
the 10
magyars 10
conquered 10
the 10
country 10
in 10
the 10
eleventh 10
century 10
they 10
found 10
the 10
huns 10
settled 10
in 10
it 10
i 10
read 10
that 10
every 10
known 10
superstition 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
is 10
gathered 10
into 10
the 10
horseshoe 10
of 10
the 10
carpathians 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
the 10
centre 10
of 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
imaginative 10
whirlpool 10
if 10
so 10
my 10
stay 10
may 10
be 10
very 10
interesting 10
mem 10
i 10
must 10
ask 10
the 10
count 10
all 10
about 10
them 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
sleep 10
well 10
though 10
my 10
bed 10
was 10
comfortable 10
enough 10
for 10
i 10
had 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
queer 10
dreams 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
dog 10
howling 10
all 10
night 10
under 10
my 10
window 10
which 10
may 10
have 10
had 10
something 10
to 10
do 10
with 10
it 10
or 10
it 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
the 10
paprika 10
for 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
drink 10
up 10
all 10
the 10
water 10
in 10
my 10
carafe 10
and 10
was 10
still 10
thirsty 10
towards 10
morning 10
i 10
slept 10
and 10
was 10
wakened 10
by 10
the 10
continuous 10
knocking 10
at 10
my 10
door 10
so 10
i 10
guess 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
sleeping 10
soundly 10
then 10
i 10
had 10
for 10
breakfast 10
more 10
paprika 10
and 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
porridge 10
of 10
maize 10
flour 10
which 10
they 10
said 10
was 10
mamaliga 10
and 10
eggplant 10
stuffed 10
with 10
forcemeat 10
a 10
very 10
excellent 10
dish 10
which 10
they 10
call 10
impletata 10
mem 10
get 10
recipe 10
for 10
this 10
also 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
hurry 10
breakfast 10
for 10
the 10
train 10
started 10
a 10
little 10
before 10
eight 10
or 10
rather 10
it 10
ought 10
to 10
have 10
done 10
so 10
for 10
after 10
rushing 10
to 10
the 10
station 10
at 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
sit 10
in 10
the 10
carriage 10
for 10
more 10
than 10
an 10
hour 10
before 10
we 10
began 10
to 10
move 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
further 10
east 10
you 10
go 10
the 10
more 10
unpunctual 10
are 10
the 10
trains 10
what 10
ought 10
they 10
to 10
be 10
in 10
china 10
all 10
day 10
long 10
we 10
seemed 10
to 10
dawdle 10
through 10
a 10
country 10
which 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
beauty 10
of 10
every 10
kind 10
sometimes 10
we 10
saw 10
little 10
towns 10
or 10
castles 10
on 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
steep 10
hills 10
such 10
as 10
we 10
see 10
in 10
old 10
missals 10
sometimes 10
we 10
ran 10
by 10
rivers 10
and 10
streams 10
which 10
seemed 10
from 10
the 10
wide 10
stony 10
margin 10
on 10
each 10
side 10
of 10
them 10
to 10
be 10
subject 10
ot 10
great 10
floods 10
it 10
takes 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
water 10
and 10
running 10
strong 10
to 10
sweep 10
the 10
outside 10
edge 10
of 10
a 10
river 10
clear 10
at 10
every 10
station 10
there 10
were 10
groups 10
of 10
people 10
sometimes 10
crowds 10
and 10
in 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
attire 10
some 10
of 10
them 10
were 10
just 10
like 10
the 10
peasants 10
at 10
home 10
or 10
those 10
i 10
saw 10
coming 10
through 10
france 10
and 10
germany 10
with 10
short 10
jackets 10
and 10
round 10
hats 10
and 10
homemade 10
trousers 10
but 10
others 10
were 10
very 10
picturesque 10
the 10
women 10
looked 10
pretty 10
except 10
when 10
you 10
got 10
near 10
them 10
but 10
they 10
were 10
very 10
clumsy 10
about 10
the 10
waist 10
they 10
had 10
all 10
full 10
white 10
sleeves 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
or 10
other 10
and 10
most 10
of 10
them 10
had 10
big 10
belts 10
with 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
strips 10
of 10
something 10
fluttering 10
from 10
them 10
like 10
the 10
dresses 10
in 10
a 10
ballet 10
but 10
of 10
course 10
there 10
were 10
petticoats 10
under 10
them 10
the 10
strangest 10
figures 10
we 10
saw 10
were 10
the 10
slovaks 10
who 10
were 10
more 10
barbarian 10
than 10
the 10
rest 10
with 10
their 10
big 10
cowboy 10
hats 10
great 10
baggy 10
dirtywhite 10
trousers 10
white 10
linen 10
shirts 10
and 10
enormous 10
heavy 10
leather 10
belts 10
nearly 10
a 10
foot 10
wide 10
all 10
studded 10
over 10
with 10
brass 10
nails 10
they 10
wore 10
high 10
boots 10
with 10
their 10
trousers 10
tucked 10
into 10
them 10
and 10
had 10
long 10
black 10
hair 10
and 10
heavy 10
black 10
moustaches 10
they 10
are 10
very 10
picturesque 10
but 10
do 10
not 10
look 10
prepossessing 10
on 10
the 10
stage 10
they 10
would 10
be 10
set 10
down 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
some 10
old 10
oriental 10
band 10
of 10
brigands 10
they 10
are 10
however 10
i 10
am 10
told 10
very 10
harmless 10
and 10
rather 10
wanting 10
in 10
natural 10
selfassertion 10
it 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
dark 10
side 10
of 10
twilight 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
to 10
bistritz 10
which 10
is 10
a 10
very 10
interesting 10
old 10
place 10
being 10
practically 10
on 10
the 10
frontierfor 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
leads 10
from 10
it 10
into 10
bukovina 10
it 10
has 10
had 10
a 10
very 10
stormy 10
existence 10
and 10
it 10
certainly 10
shows 10
marks 10
of 10
it 10
fifty 10
years 10
ago 10
a 10
series 10
of 10
great 10
fires 10
took 10
place 10
which 10
made 10
terrible 10
havoc 10
on 10
five 10
separate 10
occasions 10
at 10
the 10
very 10
beginning 10
of 10
the 10
seventeenth 10
century 10
it 10
underwent 10
a 10
siege 10
of 10
three 10
weeks 10
and 10
lost 10
people 10
the 10
casualties 10
of 10
war 10
proper 10
being 10
assisted 10
by 10
famine 10
and 10
disease 10
count 10
dracula 10
had 10
directed 10
me 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
the 10
golden 10
krone 10
hotel 10
which 10
i 10
found 10
to 10
my 10
great 10
delight 10
to 10
be 10
thoroughly 10
oldfashioned 10
for 10
of 10
course 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
see 10
all 10
i 10
could 10
of 10
the 10
ways 10
of 10
the 10
country 10
i 10
was 10
evidently 10
expected 10
for 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
near 10
the 10
door 10
i 10
faced 10
a 10
cheerylooking 10
elderly 10
woman 10
in 10
the 10
usual 10
peasant 10
dress 10
white 10
undergarment 10
with 10
a 10

almost 10
too 10
tight 10
for 10
modesty 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
close 10

bowed 10
and 10

smiled 10
and 10

message 10
to 10
an 10
elderly 10
man 10
in 10

who 10
had 10
followed 10
her 10

in 10
my 10
beautiful 10
land 10
your 10
friend 10
dracula 10
mayi 10
found 10
that 10
my 10
landlord 10
had 10
got 10
a 10
letter 10
from 10
the 10
count 10
directing 10
him 10
to 10
secure 10
the 10
best 10
place 10
on 10
the 10
coach 10
for 10
me 10
but 10
on 10
making 10
inquiries 10
as 10
to 10
details 10
he 10
seemed 10
somewhat 10
reticent 10
and 10
pretended 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
understand 10
my 10
german 10
this 10
could 10
not 10
be 10
true 10
because 10
up 10
to 10
then 10
he 10
had 10
understood 10
it 10
perfectly 10
at 10
least 10
he 10
answered 10
my 10
questions 10
exactly 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
did 10
he 10
and 10
his 10
wife 10
the 10
old 10
lady 10
who 10
had 10
received 10
me 10
looked 10
at 10
each 10
other 10
in 10
a 10
frightened 10
sort 10
of 10
way 10
he 10
mumbled 10
out 10
that 10
the 10
money 10
had 10
been 10
sent 10
in 10
a 10
letterand 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
he 10
knew 10
when 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
knew 10
count 10
dracula 10
and 10
could 10
tell 10
me 10
anything 10
of 10
his 10
castle 10
both 10
he 10
and 10
his 10
wife 10
crossed 10
themselves 10
and 10
saying 10
that 10
they 10
knew 10
nothing 10
at 10
all 10
simply 10
refused 10
to 10
speak 10
further 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
near 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
starting 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
no 10
time 10
to 10
ask 10
anyone 10
else 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
very 10
mysterious 10
and 10
not 10
by 10
any 10
means 10
comforting 10
just 10
before 10
i 10
was 10
leaving 10
the 10
old 10
lady 10
came 10
up 10
to 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
hysterical 10
way 10
must 10
you 10
go 10
oh 10
young 10
herr 10
must 10
you 10
go 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
such 10
an 10
excited 10
state 10
that 10
she 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
lost 10
her 10
grip 10
of 10
what 10
german 10
she 10
knew 10
and 10
mixed 10
it 10
all 10
up 10
with 10
some 10
other 10
language 10
which 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
at 10
all 10
i 10
was 10
just 10
able 10
to 10
follow 10
her 10
by 10
asking 10
many 10
questions 10
when 10
i 10
told 10
her 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
engaged 10
on 10
important 10
business 10
she 10
asked 10
again 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
what 10
day 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
answered 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
fourth 10
of 10
may 10
she 10
shook 10
her 10
head 10
as 10
she 10
said 10
again 10
oh 10
yes 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
but 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
what 10
day 10
it 10
is 10
on 10
my 10
saying 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
understand 10
she 10
went 10
on 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
eve 10
of 10
st 10
georges 10
day 10
do 10
you 10
not 10
know 10
that 10
tonight 10
when 10
the 10
clock 10
strikes 10
midnight 10
all 10
the 10
evil 10
things 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
will 10
have 10
full 10
sway 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
where 10
you 10
are 10
going 10
and 10
what 10
you 10
are 10
going 10
to 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
such 10
evident 10
distress 10
that 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
comfort 10
her 10
but 10
without 10
effect 10
finally 10
she 10
went 10
down 10
on 10
her 10
knees 10
and 10
implored 10
me 10
not 10
to 10
go 10
at 10
least 10
to 10
wait 10
a 10
day 10
or 10
two 10
before 10
starting 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
very 10
ridiculous 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
feel 10
comfortable 10
however 10
there 10
was 10
business 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
allow 10
nothing 10
to 10
interfere 10
with 10
it 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
raise 10
her 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
as 10
gravely 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
that 10
i 10
thanked 10
her 10
but 10
my 10
duty 10
was 10
imperative 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
she 10
then 10
rose 10
and 10
dried 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
taking 10
a 10
crucifix 10
from 10
her 10
neck 10
offered 10
it 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
for 10
as 10
an 10
english 10
churchman 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
taught 10
to 10
regard 10
such 10
things 10
as 10
in 10
some 10
measure 10
idolatrous 10
and 10
yet 10
it 10
seemed 10
so 10
ungracious 10
to 10
refuse 10
an 10
old 10
lady 10
meaning 10
so 10
well 10
and 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
state 10
of 10
mind 10
she 10
saw 10
i 10
suppose 10
the 10
doubt 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
for 10
she 10
put 10
the 10
rosary 10
round 10
my 10
neck 10
and 10
said 10
for 10
your 10
mothers 10
sake 10
and 10
went 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
am 10
writing 10
up 10
this 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
diary 10
whilst 10
i 10
am 10
waiting 10
for 10
the 10
coach 10
which 10
is 10
of 10
course 10
late 10
and 10
the 10
crucifix 10
is 10
still 10
round 10
my 10
neck 10
whether 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
old 10
ladys 10
fear 10
or 10
the 10
many 10
ghostly 10
traditions 10
of 10
this 10
place 10
or 10
the 10
crucifix 10
itself 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
feeling 10
nearly 10
as 10
easy 10
in 10
my 10
mind 10
as 10
usual 10
if 10
this 10
book 10
should 10
ever 10
reach 10
mina 10
before 10
i 10
do 10
let 10
it 10
bring 10
my 10
goodbye 10
here 10
comes 10
the 10
coach 10
may 10
the 10
castlethe 10
gray 10
of 10
the 10
morning 10
has 10
passed 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
is 10
high 10
over 10
the 10
distant 10
horizon 10
which 10
seems 10
jagged 10
whether 10
with 10
trees 10
or 10
hills 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
so 10
far 10
off 10
that 10
big 10
things 10
and 10
little 10
are 10
mixed 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
sleepy 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
called 10
till 10
i 10
awake 10
naturally 10
i 10
write 10
till 10
sleep 10
comes 10
there 10
are 10
many 10
odd 10
things 10
to 10
put 10
down 10
and 10
lest 10
who 10
reads 10
them 10
may 10
fancy 10
that 10
i 10
dined 10
too 10
well 10
before 10
i 10
left 10
bistritz 10
let 10
me 10
put 10
down 10
my 10
dinner 10
exactly 10
i 10
dined 10
on 10
what 10
they 10
called 10
robber 10
steakbits 10
of 10
bacon 10
onion 10
and 10
beef 10
seasoned 10
with 10
red 10
pepper 10
and 10
strung 10
on 10
sticks 10
and 10
roasted 10
over 10
the 10
fire 10
in 10
simple 10
style 10
of 10
the 10
london 10
cats 10
meat 10
the 10
wine 10
was 10
golden 10
mediasch 10
which 10
produces 10
a 10
queer 10
sting 10
on 10
the 10
tongue 10
which 10
is 10
however 10
not 10
disagreeable 10
i 10
had 10
only 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
glasses 10
of 10
this 10
and 10
nothing 10
else 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
on 10
the 10
coach 10
the 10
driver 10
had 10
not 10
taken 10
his 10
seat 10
and 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
talking 10
to 10
the 10
landlady 10
they 10
were 10
evidently 10
talking 10
of 10
me 10
for 10
every 10
now 10
and 10
then 10
they 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
people 10
who 10
were 10
sitting 10
on 10
the 10
bench 10
outside 10
the 10
door 10
came 10
and 10
listened 10
and 10
then 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
most 10
of 10
them 10
pityingly 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
words 10
often 10
repeated 10
queer 10
words 10
for 10
there 10
were 10
many 10
nationalities 10
in 10
the 10
crowd 10
so 10
i 10
quietly 10
got 10
my 10
polyglot 10
dictionary 10
from 10
my 10
bag 10
and 10
looked 10
them 10
out 10
i 10
must 10
say 10
they 10
were 10
not 10
cheering 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
amongst 10
them 10
were 10
ordogsatan 10
pokolhell 10
stregoicawitch 10
vrolok 10
and 10
vlkoslakboth 10
mean 10
the 10
same 10
thing 10
one 10
being 10
slovak 10
and 10
the 10
other 10
servian 10
for 10
something 10
that 10
is 10
either 10
werewolf 10
or 10
vampire 10
mem 10
i 10
must 10
ask 10
the 10
count 10
about 10
these 10
superstitions 10
when 10
we 10
started 10
the 10
crowd 10
round 10
the 10
inn 10
door 10
which 10
had 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
swelled 10
to 10
a 10
considerable 10
size 10
all 10
made 10
the 10
sign 10
of 10
the 10
cross 10
and 10
pointed 10
two 10
fingers 10
towards 10
me 10
with 10
some 10
difficulty 10
i 10
got 10
a 10
fellow 10
passenger 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
what 10
they 10
meant 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
answer 10
at 10
first 10
but 10
on 10
learning 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
english 10
he 10
explained 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
charm 10
or 10
guard 10
against 10
the 10
evil 10
eye 10
this 10
was 10
not 10
very 10
pleasant 10
for 10
me 10
just 10
starting 10
for 10
an 10
unknown 10
place 10
to 10
meet 10
an 10
unknown 10
man 10
but 10
everyone 10
seemed 10
so 10
kindhearted 10
and 10
so 10
sorrowful 10
and 10
so 10
sympathetic 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
be 10
touched 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
forget 10
the 10
last 10
glimpse 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
of 10
the 10
inn 10
yard 10
and 10
its 10
crowd 10
of 10
picturesque 10
figuresall 10
crossing 10
themselves 10
as 10
they 10
stood 10
round 10
the 10
wide 10
archway 10
with 10
its 10
background 10
of 10
rich 10
foliage 10
of 10
oleander 10
and 10
orange 10
trees 10
in 10
green 10
tubs 10
clustered 10
in 10
the 10
centre 10
of 10
the 10
yard 10
then 10
our 10
driver 10
whose 10
wide 10
linen 10
drawers 10
covered 10
the 10
whole 10
front 10
of 10
the 10
boxseatgotza 10

his 10
big 10
whip 10
over 10
his 10
four 10
small 10
horses 10
which 10
ran 10
abreast 10
and 10
we 10
set 10
off 10
on 10
our 10
journey 10
i 10
soon 10
lost 10
sight 10
and 10
recollection 10
of 10
ghostly 10
fears 10
in 10
the 10
beauty 10
of 10
the 10
scene 10
as 10
we 10
drove 10
along 10
although 10
had 10
i 10
known 10
the 10
language 10
or 10
rather 10
languages 10
which 10
my 10
fellowpassengers 10
were 10
speaking 10
i 10
might 10
not 10
have 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
throw 10
them 10
off 10
so 10
easily 10
before 10
us 10
lay 10
a 10
green 10
sloping 10
land 10
full 10
of 10
forests 10
and 10
woods 10
with 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
steep 10
hills 10
crowned 10
with 10
clumps 10
of 10
trees 10
or 10
with 10
farmhouses 10
the 10
blank 10
gable 10
end 10
to 10
the 10
road 10
there 10
was 10
everywhere 10
a 10
bewildering 10
mass 10
of 10
fruit 10
blossom 10
apple 10
plum 10
pear 10
cherry 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
drove 10
by 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
green 10
grass 10
under 10
the 10
trees 10
spangled 10
with 10
the 10
fallen 10
petals 10
in 10
and 10
out 10
amongst 10
these 10
green 10
hills 10
of 10
what 10
they 10
call 10
here 10
the 10
mittel 10
land 10
ran 10
the 10
road 10
losing 10
itself 10
as 10
it 10
swept 10
round 10
the 10
grassy 10
curve 10
or 10
was 10
shut 10
out 10
by 10
the 10
straggling 10
ends 10
of 10
pine 10
woods 10
which 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
ran 10
down 10
the 10
hillsides 10
like 10
tongues 10
of 10
flame 10
the 10
road 10
was 10
rugged 10
but 10
still 10
we 10
seemed 10
to 10
fly 10
over 10
it 10
with 10
a 10
feverish 10
haste 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
understand 10
then 10
what 10
the 10
haste 10
meant 10
but 10
the 10
driver 10
was 10
evidently 10
bent 10
on 10
losing 10
no 10
time 10
in 10
reaching 10
borgo 10
prund 10
i 10
was 10
told 10
that 10
this 10
road 10
is 10
in 10
summertime 10
excellent 10
but 10
that 10
it 10
had 10
not 10
yet 10
been 10
put 10
in 10
order 10
after 10
the 10
winter 10
snows 10
in 10
this 10
respect 10
it 10
is 10
different 10
from 10
the 10
general 10
run 10
of 10
roads 10
in 10
the 10
carpathians 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
an 10
old 10
tradition 10
that 10
they 10
are 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
kept 10
in 10
too 10
good 10
order 10
of 10
old 10
the 10
hospadars 10
would 10
not 10
repair 10
them 10
lest 10
the 10
turk 10
should 10
think 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
preparing 10
to 10
bring 10
in 10
foreign 10
troops 10
and 10
so 10
hasten 10
the 10
war 10
which 10
was 10
always 10
really 10
at 10
loading 10
point 10
beyond 10
the 10
green 10
swelling 10
hills 10
of 10
the 10
mittel 10
land 10
rose 10
mighty 10
slopes 10
of 10
forest 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
lofty 10
steeps 10
of 10
the 10
carpathians 10
themselves 10
right 10
and 10
left 10
of 10
us 10
they 10
towered 10
with 10
the 10
afternoon 10
sun 10
falling 10
full 10
upon 10
them 10
and 10
bringing 10
out 10
all 10
the 10
glorious 10
colours 10
of 10
this 10
beautiful 10
range 10
deep 10
blue 10
and 10
purple 10
in 10
the 10
shadows 10
of 10
the 10
peaks 10
green 10
and 10
brown 10
where 10
grass 10
and 10
rock 10
mingled 10
and 10
an 10
endless 10
perspective 10
of 10
jagged 10
rock 10
and 10
pointed 10
crags 10
till 10
these 10
were 10
themselves 10
lost 10
in 10
the 10
distance 10
where 10
the 10
snowy 10
peaks 10
rose 10
grandly 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
seemed 10
mighty 10
rifts 10
in 10
the 10
mountains 10
through 10
which 10
as 10
the 10
sun 10
began 10
to 10
sink 10
we 10
saw 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
the 10
white 10
gleam 10
of 10
falling 10
water 10
one 10
of 10
my 10
companions 10
touched 10
my 10
arm 10
as 10
we 10
swept 10
round 10
the 10
base 10
of 10
a 10
hill 10
and 10
opened 10
up 10
the 10
lofty 10
snowcovered 10
peak 10
of 10
a 10
mountain 10
which 10
seemed 10
as 10
we 10
wound 10
on 10
our 10
serpentine 10
way 10
to 10
be 10
right 10
before 10
us 10
look 10
isten 10

he 10
crossed 10
himself 10
reverently 10
as 10
we 10
wound 10
on 10
our 10
endless 10
way 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
sank 10
lower 10
and 10
lower 10
behind 10
us 10
the 10
shadows 10
of 10
the 10
evening 10
began 10
to 10
creep 10
round 10
us 10
this 10
was 10
emphasized 10
by 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
the 10
snowy 10
mountaintop 10
still 10
held 10
the 10
sunset 10
and 10
seemed 10
to 10
glow 10
out 10
with 10
a 10
delicate 10
cool 10
pink 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
we 10
passed 10
cszeks 10
and 10
slovaks 10
all 10
in 10
picturesque 10
attire 10
but 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
goitre 10
was 10
painfully 10
prevalent 10
by 10
the 10
roadside 10
were 10
many 10
crosses 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
swept 10
by 10
my 10
companions 10
all 10
crossed 10
themselves 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
peasant 10
man 10
or 10
woman 10
kneeling 10
before 10
a 10
shrine 10
who 10
did 10
not 10
even 10
turn 10
round 10
as 10
we 10
approached 10
but 10
seemed 10
in 10
the 10
selfsurrender 10
of 10
devotion 10
to 10
have 10
neither 10
eyes 10
nor 10
ears 10
for 10
the 10
outer 10
world 10
there 10
were 10
many 10
things 10
new 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
instance 10
hayricks 10
in 10
the 10
trees 10
and 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
very 10
beautiful 10
masses 10
of 10
weeping 10
birch 10
their 10
white 10
stems 10
shining 10
like 10
silver 10
through 10
the 10
delicate 10
green 10
of 10
the 10
leaves 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
we 10
passed 10
a 10
leiterwagonthe 10
ordinary 10
peasantss 10
cartwith 10
its 10
long 10
snakelike 10
vertebra 10
calculated 10
to 10
suit 10
the 10
inequalities 10
of 10
the 10
road 10
on 10
this 10
were 10
sure 10
to 10
be 10
seated 10
quite 10
a 10
group 10
of 10
homecoming 10
peasants 10
the 10
cszeks 10
with 10
their 10
white 10
and 10
the 10
slovaks 10
with 10
their 10
coloured 10
sheepskins 10
the 10
latter 10
carrying 10
lancefashion 10
their 10
long 10
staves 10
with 10
axe 10
at 10
end 10
as 10
the 10
evening 10
fell 10
it 10
began 10
to 10
get 10
very 10
cold 10
and 10
the 10
growing 10
twilight 10
seemed 10
to 10
merge 10
into 10
one 10
dark 10
mistiness 10
the 10
gloom 10
of 10
the 10
trees 10
oak 10
beech 10
and 10
pine 10
though 10
in 10
the 10
valleys 10
which 10
ran 10
deep 10
between 10
the 10
spurs 10
of 10
the 10
hills 10
as 10
we 10
ascended 10
through 10
the 10
pass 10
the 10
dark 10
firs 10
stood 10
out 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
against 10
the 10
background 10
of 10
latelying 10
snow 10
sometimes 10
as 10
the 10
road 10
was 10
cut 10
through 10
the 10
pine 10
woods 10
that 10
seemed 10
in 10
the 10
darkness 10
to 10
be 10
closing 10
down 10
upon 10
us 10
great 10
masses 10
of 10
greyness 10
which 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
bestrewed 10
the 10
trees 10
produced 10
a 10
peculiarly 10
weird 10
and 10
solemn 10
effect 10
which 10
carried 10
on 10
the 10
thoughts 10
and 10
grim 10
fancies 10
engendered 10
earlier 10
in 10
the 10
evening 10
when 10
the 10
falling 10
sunset 10
threw 10
into 10
strange 10
relief 10
the 10
ghostlike 10
clouds 10
which 10
amongst 10
the 10
carpathians 10
seem 10
to 10
wind 10
ceaselessly 10
through 10
the 10
valleys 10
sometimes 10
the 10
hills 10
were 10
so 10
steep 10
that 10
despite 10
our 10
drivers 10
haste 10
the 10
horses 10
could 10
only 10
go 10
slowly 10
i 10
wished 10
to 10
get 10
down 10
and 10
walk 10
up 10
them 10
as 10
we 10
do 10
at 10
home 10
but 10
the 10
driver 10
would 10
not 10
hear 10
of 10
it 10
no 10
no 10
he 10
said 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
walk 10
here 10
the 10
dogs 10
are 10
too 10
fierce 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
added 10
with 10
what 10
he 10
evidently 10
meant 10
for 10
grim 10
pleasantry 10
for 10
he 10
looked 10
round 10
to 10
catch 10
the 10
approving 10
smile 10
of 10
the 10
restand 10
you 10
may 10
have 10
enough 10
of 10
such 10
matters 10
before 10
you 10
go 10
to 10
sleep 10
the 10
only 10
stop 10
he 10
would 10
make 10
was 10
a 10
moments 10
pause 10
to 10
light 10
his 10
lamps 10
when 10
it 10
grew 10
dark 10
there 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
some 10
excitement 10
amongst 10
the 10
passengers 10
and 10
they 10
kept 10
speaking 10
to 10
him 10
one 10
after 10
the 10
other 10
as 10
though 10
urging 10
him 10
to 10
further 10
speed 10
he 10
lashed 10
the 10
horses 10
unmercifully 10
with 10
his 10
long 10
whip 10
and 10
with 10
wild 10
cries 10
of 10
encouragement 10
urged 10
them 10
on 10
to 10
further 10
exertions 10
then 10
through 10
the 10
darkness 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
patch 10
of 10
grey 10
light 10
ahead 10
of 10
usas 10
though 10
there 10
were 10
a 10
cleft 10
in 10
the 10
hills 10
the 10
excitement 10
of 10
the 10
passengers 10
grew 10
greater 10
the 10
crazy 10
coach 10
rocked 10
on 10
its 10
great 10
leather 10
springs 10
and 10
swayed 10
like 10
a 10
boat 10
tossed 10
on 10
a 10
stormy 10
sea 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
hold 10
on 10
the 10
road 10
grew 10
more 10
level 10
and 10
we 10
appeared 10
to 10
fly 10
along 10
then 10
the 10
mountains 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
nearer 10
to 10
us 10
on 10
each 10
side 10
and 10
to 10
frown 10
down 10
upon 10
us 10
we 10
were 10
entering 10
on 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
several 10
of 10
the 10
passengers 10
offered 10
me 10
gifts 10
which 10
they 10
pressed 10
upon 10
me 10
with 10
an 10
earnestness 10
which 10
would 10
take 10
no 10
denial 10
these 10
were 10
certainly 10
of 10
an 10
odd 10
and 10
varied 10
kind 10
but 10
each 10
was 10
given 10
in 10
simple 10
good 10
faith 10
with 10
a 10
kindly 10
word 10
and 10
a 10
blessing 10
and 10
that 10
same 10
strange 10
mixture 10
of 10
fearmeaning 10
movements 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
outside 10
the 10
hotel 10
at 10
bistritz 10
the 10
sign 10
of 10
the 10
cross 10
and 10
the 10
guard 10
against 10
the 10
evil 10
eye 10
then 10
as 10
we 10
flew 10
along 10
the 10
driver 10
leaned 10
forward 10
and 10
on 10
each 10
side 10
the 10
passengers 10
craning 10
over 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
coach 10
peered 10
eagerly 10
into 10
the 10
darkness 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
something 10
very 10
exciting 10
was 10
either 10
happening 10
or 10
expected 10
but 10
though 10
i 10
asked 10
each 10
passenger 10
no 10
one 10
would 10
give 10
me 10
the 10
slightest 10
explanation 10
this 10
state 10
of 10
excitement 10
kept 10
on 10
for 10
some 10
little 10
time 10
and 10
at 10
last 10
we 10
saw 10
before 10
us 10
the 10
pass 10
opening 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
eastern 10
side 10
there 10
were 10
dark 10
rolling 10
clouds 10
overhead 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
the 10
heavy 10
oppressive 10
sense 10
of 10
thunder 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
mountain 10
range 10
had 10
separated 10
two 10
atmospheres 10
and 10
that 10
now 10
we 10
had 10
got 10
into 10
the 10
thunderous 10
one 10
i 10
was 10
now 10
myself 10
looking 10
out 10
for 10
the 10
conveyance 10
which 10
was 10
to 10
take 10
me 10
to 10
the 10
count 10
each 10
moment 10
i 10
expected 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
glare 10
of 10
lamps 10
through 10
the 10
blackness 10
but 10
all 10
was 10
dark 10
the 10
only 10
light 10
was 10
the 10
flickering 10
rays 10
of 10
our 10
own 10
lamps 10
in 10
which 10
the 10
steam 10
from 10
our 10
harddriven 10
horses 10
rose 10
in 10
a 10
white 10
cloud 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
now 10
the 10
sandy 10
road 10
lying 10
white 10
before 10
us 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
on 10
it 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
a 10
vehicle 10
the 10
passengers 10
drew 10
back 10
with 10
a 10
sigh 10
of 10
gladness 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
mock 10
my 10
own 10
disappointment 10
i 10
was 10
already 10
thinking 10
what 10
i 10
had 10
best 10
do 10
when 10
the 10
driver 10
looking 10
at 10
his 10
watch 10
said 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
something 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
hardly 10
hear 10
it 10
was 10
spoken 10
so 10
quietly 10
and 10
in 10
so 10
low 10
a 10
tone 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
was 10
an 10
hour 10
less 10
than 10
the 10
time 10
then 10
turning 10
to 10
me 10
he 10
spoke 10
in 10
german 10
worse 10
than 10
my 10
own 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
carriage 10
here 10
the 10
herr 10
is 10
not 10
expected 10
after 10
all 10
he 10
will 10
now 10
come 10
on 10
to 10
bukovina 10
and 10
return 10
tomorrow 10
or 10
the 10
next 10
day 10
better 10
the 10
next 10
day 10
whilst 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
the 10
horses 10
began 10
to 10
neigh 10
and 10
snort 10
and 10
plunge 10
wildly 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
driver 10
had 10
to 10
hold 10
them 10
up 10
then 10
amongst 10
a 10
chorus 10
of 10
screams 10
from 10
the 10
peasants 10
and 10
a 10
universal 10
crossing 10
of 10
themselves 10
a 10
caleche 10
with 10
four 10
horses 10
drove 10
up 10
behind 10
us 10
overtook 10
us 10
and 10
drew 10
up 10
beside 10
the 10
coach 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
from 10
the 10
flash 10
of 10
our 10
lamps 10
as 10
the 10
rays 10
fell 10
on 10
them 10
that 10
the 10
horses 10
were 10
coalblack 10
and 10
splendid 10
animals 10
they 10
were 10
driven 10
by 10
a 10
tall 10
man 10
with 10
a 10
long 10
brown 10
beard 10
and 10
a 10
great 10
black 10
hat 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
hide 10
his 10
face 10
from 10
us 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
see 10
the 10
gleam 10
of 10
a 10
pair 10
of 10
very 10
bright 10
eyes 10
which 10
seemed 10
red 10
in 10
the 10
lamplight 10
as 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
us 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
the 10
driver 10
you 10
are 10
early 10
tonight 10
my 10
friend 10
the 10
man 10
stammered 10
in 10
reply 10
the 10
english 10
herr 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
hurry 10
to 10
which 10
the 10
stranger 10
replied 10
that 10
is 10
why 10
i 10
suppose 10
you 10
wished 10
him 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
to 10
bukovina 10
you 10
cannot 10
deceive 10
me 10
my 10
friend 10
i 10
know 10
too 10
much 10
and 10
my 10
horses 10
are 10
swift 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
smiledand 10
the 10
lamplight 10
fell 10
on 10
a 10
hardlooking 10
mouth 10
with 10
very 10
red 10
lips 10
and 10
sharplooking 10
teeth 10
as 10
white 10
as 10
ivory 10
one 10
of 10
my 10
companions 10
whispered 10
to 10
another 10
the 10
line 10
from 10
burgers 10
lenore 10
denn 10
die 10
todten 10
reiten 10
schnell 10
for 10
the 10
dead 10
travel 10
fast 10
the 10
strange 10
driver 10
evidently 10
heard 10
the 10
words 10
for 10
he 10
looked 10
up 10
with 10
a 10
gleaming 10
smile 10
the 10
passenger 10
turned 10
his 10
face 10
away 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
putting 10
out 10
his 10
two 10
fingers 10
and 10
crossing 10
himself 10
give 10
me 10
the 10
herrs 10
luggage 10
said 10
the 10
driver 10
and 10
with 10
exceeding 10
alacrity 10
my 10
bags 10
were 10
handed 10
out 10
and 10
put 10
in 10
the 10
caleche 10
then 10
i 10
descended 10
from 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
coach 10
as 10
the 10
caleche 10
was 10
close 10
alongside 10
the 10
driver 10
helping 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
hand 10
which 10
caught 10
my 10
arm 10
in 10
a 10
grip 10
of 10
steel 10
his 10
strength 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
prodigious 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
shook 10
his 10
reins 10
the 10
horses 10
turned 10
and 10
we 10
swept 10
into 10
the 10
darkness 10
of 10
the 10
pass 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
back 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
steam 10
from 10
the 10
horses 10
of 10
the 10
coach 10
by 10
the 10
light 10
of 10
the 10
lampsand 10
projected 10
against 10
it 10
the 10
figures 10
of 10
my 10
late 10
companions 10
crossing 10
themselves 10
then 10
the 10
driver 10
cracked 10
his 10
whip 10
and 10
called 10
to 10
his 10
horses 10
and 10
off 10
they 10
swept 10
on 10
their 10
way 10
to 10
bukovina 10
as 10
they 10
sank 10
into 10
the 10
darkness 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
strange 10
chill 10
and 10
a 10
lonely 10
feeling 10
come 10
over 10
me 10
but 10
a 10
cloak 10
was 10
thrown 10
over 10
my 10
shoulders 10
and 10
a 10
rug 10
across 10
my 10
knees 10
and 10
the 10
driver 10
said 10
in 10
excellent 10
germanthe 10
night 10
is 10
chill 10
mein 10
herr 10
and 10
my 10
master 10
the 10
count 10
bade 10
me 10
take 10
all 10
care 10
of 10
you 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
flask 10
of 10
slivovitz 10
the 10
plum 10
brandy 10
of 10
the 10
country 10
underneath 10
the 10
seat 10
if 10
you 10
should 10
require 10
it 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
take 10
any 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
comfort 10
to 10
know 10
it 10
was 10
there 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
little 10
strangely 10
and 10
not 10
a 10
little 10
frightened 10
i 10
think 10
had 10
there 10
been 10
any 10
alternative 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
taken 10
it 10
instead 10
of 10
prosecuting 10
that 10
unknown 10
night 10
journey 10
the 10
carriage 10
went 10
at 10
a 10
hard 10
pace 10
straight 10
along 10
then 10
we 10
made 10
a 10
complete 10
turn 10
and 10
went 10
along 10
another 10
straight 10
road 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
simply 10
going 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
the 10
same 10
ground 10
again 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
note 10
of 10
some 10
salient 10
point 10
and 10
found 10
that 10
this 10
was 10
so 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
liked 10
to 10
have 10
asked 10
the 10
driver 10
what 10
this 10
all 10
meant 10
but 10
i 10
really 10
feared 10
to 10
do 10
so 10
for 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
placed 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
any 10
protest 10
would 10
have 10
had 10
no 10
effect 10
in 10
case 10
there 10
had 10
been 10
an 10
intention 10
to 10
delay 10
byandby 10
however 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
curious 10
to 10
know 10
how 10
time 10
was 10
passing 10
i 10
struck 10
a 10
match 10
and 10
by 10
its 10
flame 10
looked 10
at 10
my 10
watch 10
it 10
was 10
within 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
of 10
midnight 10
this 10
gave 10
me 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
shock 10
for 10
i 10
suppose 10
the 10
general 10
superstition 10
about 10
midnight 10
was 10
increased 10
by 10
my 10
recent 10
experiences 10
i 10
waited 10
with 10
a 10
sick 10
feeling 10
of 10
suspense 10
then 10
a 10
dog 10
began 10
to 10
howl 10
somewhere 10
in 10
a 10
farmhouse 10
far 10
down 10
the 10
road 10
a 10
long 10
agonized 10
wailing 10
as 10
if 10
from 10
fear 10
the 10
sound 10
was 10
taken 10
up 10
by 10
another 10
dog 10
and 10
then 10
another 10
and 10
another 10
till 10
borne 10
on 10
the 10
wind 10
which 10
now 10
sighed 10
softly 10
through 10
the 10
pass 10
a 10
wild 10
howling 10
began 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
from 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
country 10
as 10
far 10
as 10
the 10
imagination 10
could 10
grasp 10
it 10
through 10
the 10
gloom 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
howl 10
the 10
horses 10
began 10
to 10
strain 10
and 10
rear 10
but 10
the 10
driver 10
spoke 10
to 10
them 10
soothingly 10
and 10
they 10
quieted 10
down 10
but 10
shivered 10
and 10
sweated 10
as 10
though 10
after 10
a 10
runaway 10
from 10
sudden 10
fright 10
then 10
far 10
off 10
in 10
the 10
distance 10
from 10
the 10
mountains 10
on 10
each 10
side 10
of 10
us 10
began 10
a 10
louder 10
and 10
a 10
sharper 10
howling 10
that 10
of 10
wolves 10
which 10
affected 10
both 10
the 10
horses 10
and 10
myself 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
way 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
minded 10
to 10
jump 10
from 10
the 10
caleche 10
and 10
run 10
whilst 10
they 10
reared 10
again 10
and 10
plunged 10
madly 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
driver 10
had 10
to 10
use 10
all 10
his 10
great 10
strength 10
to 10
keep 10
them 10
from 10
bolting 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
however 10
my 10
own 10
ears 10
got 10
accustomed 10
to 10
the 10
sound 10
and 10
the 10
horses 10
so 10
far 10
became 10
quiet 10
that 10
the 10
driver 10
was 10
able 10
to 10
descend 10
and 10
to 10
stand 10
before 10
them 10
he 10
petted 10
and 10
soothed 10
them 10
and 10
whispered 10
something 10
in 10
their 10
ears 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
heard 10
of 10
horsetamers 10
doing 10
and 10
with 10
extraordinary 10
effect 10
for 10
under 10
his 10
caresses 10
they 10
became 10
quite 10
manageable 10
again 10
though 10
they 10
still 10
trembled 10
the 10
driver 10
again 10
took 10
his 10
seat 10
and 10
shaking 10
his 10
reins 10
started 10
off 10
at 10
a 10
great 10
pace 10
this 10
time 10
after 10
going 10
to 10
the 10
far 10
side 10
or 10
the 10
pass 10
he 10
suddenly 10
turned 10
down 10
a 10
narrow 10
roadway 10
which 10
ran 10
sharply 10
to 10
the 10
right 10
soon 10
we 10
were 10
hemmed 10
in 10
with 10
trees 10
which 10
in 10
places 10
arched 10
right 10
over 10
the 10
roadway 10
till 10
we 10
passed 10
as 10
through 10
a 10
tunnel 10
and 10
again 10
great 10
frowning 10
rocks 10
guarded 10
us 10
boldly 10
on 10
either 10
side 10
though 10
we 10
were 10
in 10
shelter 10
we 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
rising 10
wind 10
for 10
it 10
moaned 10
and 10
whistled 10
through 10
the 10
rocks 10
and 10
the 10
branches 10
of 10
the 10
trees 10
crashed 10
together 10
as 10
we 10
swept 10
along 10
it 10
grew 10
colder 10
and 10
colder 10
still 10
and 10
fine 10
powdery 10
snow 10
began 10
to 10
fall 10
so 10
that 10
soon 10
we 10
and 10
all 10
around 10
us 10
were 10
covered 10
with 10
a 10
white 10
blanket 10
the 10
keen 10
wind 10
still 10
carried 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
dogs 10
though 10
this 10
grew 10
fainter 10
as 10
we 10
went 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
the 10
baying 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
sounded 10
nearer 10
and 10
nearer 10
as 10
though 10
they 10
were 10
closing 10
round 10
on 10
us 10
from 10
every 10
side 10
i 10
grew 10
dreadfully 10
afraid 10
and 10
the 10
horses 10
shared 10
my 10
fear 10
the 10
driver 10
however 10
was 10
not 10
in 10
the 10
least 10
disturbed 10
he 10
kept 10
turning 10
his 10
head 10
to 10
left 10
and 10
right 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
anything 10
through 10
the 10
darkness 10
suddenly 10
away 10
on 10
our 10
left 10
i 10
saw 10
a 10
fain 10
flickering 10
blue 10
flame 10
the 10
driver 10
saw 10
it 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
moment 10
he 10
at 10
once 10
checked 10
the 10
horses 10
and 10
jumping 10
to 10
the 10
ground 10
disappeared 10
into 10
the 10
darkness 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
the 10
less 10
as 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
grew 10
closer 10
but 10
while 10
i 10
wondered 10
the 10
driver 10
suddenly 10
appeared 10
again 10
and 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
took 10
his 10
seat 10
and 10
we 10
resumed 10
our 10
journey 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
fallen 10
asleep 10
and 10
kept 10
dreaming 10
of 10
the 10
incident 10
for 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
repeated 10
endlessly 10
and 10
now 10
looking 10
back 10
it 10
is 10
like 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
awful 10
nightmare 10
once 10
the 10
flame 10
appeared 10
so 10
near 10
the 10
road 10
that 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
darkness 10
around 10
us 10
i 10
could 10
watch 10
the 10
drivers 10
motions 10
he 10
went 10
rapidly 10
to 10
where 10
the 10
blue 10
flame 10
arose 10
it 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
very 10
faint 10
for 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
illumine 10
the 10
place 10
around 10
it 10
at 10
all 10
and 10
gathering 10
a 10
few 10
stones 10
formed 10
them 10
into 10
some 10
device 10
once 10
there 10
appeared 10
a 10
strange 10
optical 10
effect 10
when 10
he 10
stood 10
between 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
flame 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
obstruct 10
it 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
its 10
ghostly 10
flicker 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
this 10
startled 10
me 10
but 10
as 10
the 10
effect 10
was 10
only 10
momentary 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
that 10
my 10
eyes 10
deceived 10
me 10
straining 10
through 10
the 10
darkness 10
then 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
blue 10
flames 10
and 10
we 10
sped 10
onwards 10
through 10
the 10
gloom 10
with 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
around 10
us 10
as 10
though 10
they 10
were 10
following 10
in 10
a 10
moving 10
circle 10
at 10
last 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
time 10
when 10
the 10
driver 10
went 10
further 10
afield 10
than 10
he 10
had 10
yet 10
gone 10
and 10
during 10
his 10
absence 10
the 10
horses 10
began 10
to 10
tremble 10
worse 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
to 10
snort 10
and 10
scream 10
with 10
fright 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
any 10
cause 10
for 10
it 10
for 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
had 10
ceased 10
altogether 10
but 10
just 10
then 10
the 10
moon 10
sailing 10
through 10
the 10
black 10
clouds 10
appeared 10
behind 10
the 10
jagged 10
crest 10
of 10
a 10
beetling 10
pineclad 10
rock 10
and 10
by 10
its 10
light 10
i 10
saw 10
around 10
us 10
a 10
ring 10
of 10
wolves 10
with 10
white 10
teeth 10
and 10
lolling 10
red 10
tongues 10
with 10
long 10
sinewy 10
limbs 10
and 10
shaggy 10
hair 10
they 10
were 10
a 10
hundred 10
times 10
more 10
terrible 10
in 10
the 10
grim 10
silence 10
which 10
held 10
them 10
than 10
even 10
when 10
they 10
howled 10
for 10
myself 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
paralysis 10
of 10
fear 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
when 10
a 10
man 10
feels 10
himself 10
face 10
to 10
face 10
with 10
such 10
horrors 10
that 10
he 10
can 10
understand 10
their 10
true 10
import 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
the 10
wolves 10
began 10
to 10
howl 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
moonlight 10
had 10
had 10
some 10
peculiar 10
effect 10
on 10
them 10
the 10
horses 10
jumped 10
about 10
and 10
reared 10
and 10
looked 10
helplessly 10
round 10
with 10
eyes 10
that 10
rolled 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
painful 10
to 10
see 10
but 10
the 10
living 10
ring 10
of 10
terror 10
encompassed 10
them 10
on 10
every 10
side 10
and 10
they 10
had 10
perforce 10
to 10
remain 10
within 10
it 10
i 10
called 10
to 10
the 10
coachman 10
to 10
come 10
for 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
our 10
only 10
chance 10
was 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
break 10
out 10
through 10
the 10
ring 10
and 10
to 10
aid 10
his 10
approach 10
i 10
shouted 10
and 10
beat 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
caleche 10
hoping 10
by 10
the 10
noise 10
to 10
scare 10
the 10
wolves 10
from 10
the 10
side 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
give 10
him 10
a 10
chance 10
of 10
reaching 10
the 10
trap 10
how 10
he 10
came 10
there 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
but 10
i 10
heard 10
his 10
voice 10
raised 10
in 10
a 10
tone 10
of 10
imperious 10
command 10
and 10
looking 10
towards 10
the 10
sound 10
saw 10
him 10
stand 10
in 10
the 10
roadway 10
as 10
he 10
swept 10
his 10
long 10
arms 10
as 10
though 10
brushing 10
aside 10
some 10
impalpable 10
obstacle 10
the 10
wolves 10
fell 10
back 10
and 10
back 10
further 10
still 10
just 10
then 10
a 10
heavy 10
cloud 10
passed 10
across 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
the 10
moon 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
again 10
in 10
darkness 10
when 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
again 10
the 10
driver 10
was 10
climbing 10
into 10
the 10
caleche 10
and 10
the 10
wolves 10
disappeared 10
this 10
was 10
all 10
so 10
strange 10
and 10
uncanny 10
that 10
a 10
dreadful 10
fear 10
came 10
upon 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
to 10
speak 10
or 10
move 10
the 10
time 10
seemed 10
interminable 10
as 10
we 10
swept 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
now 10
in 10
almost 10
complete 10
darkness 10
for 10
the 10
rolling 10
clouds 10
obscured 10
the 10
moon 10
we 10
kept 10
on 10
ascending 10
with 10
occasional 10
periods 10
of 10
quick 10
descent 10
but 10
in 10
the 10
main 10
always 10
ascending 10
suddenly 10
i 10
became 10
conscious 10
of 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
the 10
driver 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
act 10
of 10
pulling 10
up 10
the 10
horses 10
in 10
the 10
courtyard 10
of 10
a 10
vast 10
ruined 10
castle 10
from 10
whose 10
tall 10
black 10
windows 10
came 10
no 10
ray 10
of 10
lightand 10
whose 10
broken 10
battlements 10
showed 10
a 10
jagged 10
line 10
against 10
the 10
sky 10

mayi 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
asleep 10
for 10
certainly 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
fully 10
awake 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
noticed 10
the 10
approach 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
remarkable 10
place 10
in 10
the 10
gloom 10
the 10
courtyard 10
looked 10
of 10
considerable 10
size 10
and 10
as 10
several 10
dark 10
ways 10
led 10
from 10
it 10
under 10
great 10
round 10
arches 10
it 10
perhaps 10
seemed 10
bigger 10
than 10
it 10
really 10
is 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
yet 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
see 10
it 10
by 10
daylight 10
when 10
the 10
caleche 10
stopped 10
the 10
driver 10
jumped 10
down 10
and 10
held 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
assist 10
me 10
to 10
alight 10
again 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
notice 10
his 10
prodigious 10
strength 10
his 10
hand 10
actually 10
seemed 10
like 10
a 10
steel 10
vice 10
that 10
could 10
have 10
crushed 10
mine 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
chosen 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
traps 10
and 10
placed 10
them 10
on 10
the 10
ground 10
beside 10
me 10
as 10
i 10
stood 10
close 10
to 10
a 10
great 10
door 10
old 10
and 10
studded 10
with 10
large 10
iron 10
nails 10
and 10
set 10
in 10
a 10
projecting 10
doorway 10
of 10
massive 10
stone 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
even 10
in 10
th 10
e 10
dim 10
light 10
that 10
the 10
stone 10
was 10
massively 10
carved 10
but 10
that 10
the 10
carving 10
had 10
been 10
much 10
worn 10
by 10
time 10
and 10
weather 10
as 10
i 10
stood 10
the 10
driver 10
jumped 10
again 10
into 10
his 10
seat 10
and 10
shook 10
the 10
reins 10
the 10
horses 10
started 10
forwardand 10
trap 10
and 10
all 10
disappeared 10
down 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
dark 10
openings 10
i 10
stood 10
in 10
silence 10
where 10
i 10
was 10
for 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
of 10
bell 10
or 10
knocker 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
through 10
these 10
frowning 10
walls 10
and 10
dark 10
window 10
openings 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
likely 10
that 10
my 10
voice 10
could 10
penetrate 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
waited 10
seemed 10
endless 10
and 10
i 10
felt 10
doubts 10
and 10
fears 10
crowding 10
upon 10
me 10
what 10
sort 10
of 10
place 10
had 10
i 10
come 10
to 10
and 10
among 10
what 10
kind 10
of 10
people 10
what 10
sort 10
of 10
grim 10
adventure 10
was 10
it 10
on 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
embarked 10
was 10
this 10
a 10
customary 10
incident 10
in 10
the 10
life 10
of 10
a 10
solicitors 10
clerk 10
sent 10
out 10
to 10
explain 10
the 10
purchase 10
of 10
a 10
london 10
estate 10
to 10
a 10
foreigner 10
solicitors 10
clerk 10
mina 10
would 10
not 10
like 10
that 10
solicitor 10
for 10
just 10
before 10
leaving 10
london 10
i 10
got 10
word 10
that 10
my 10
examination 10
was 10
successful 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
now 10
a 10
fullblown 10
solicitor 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
rub 10
my 10
eyes 10
and 10
pinch 10
myself 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
awake 10
it 10
all 10
seemed 10
like 10
a 10
horrible 10
nightmare 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
expected 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
suddenly 10
awake 10
and 10
find 10
myself 10
at 10
home 10
with 10
the 10
dawn 10
struggling 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
windows 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
felt 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
after 10
a 10
day 10
of 10
overwork 10
but 10
my 10
flesh 10
answered 10
the 10
pinching 10
test 10
and 10
my 10
eyes 10
were 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
deceived 10
i 10
was 10
indeed 10
awake 10
and 10
among 10
the 10
carpathians 10
all 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
now 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
patient 10
and 10
to 10
wait 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
morning 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
this 10
conclusion 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
heavy 10
step 10
approaching 10
behind 10
the 10
great 10
door 10
and 10
saw 10
through 10
the 10
chinks 10
the 10
gleam 10
of 10
a 10
coming 10
light 10
then 10
there 10
was 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
rattling 10
chains 10
and 10
the 10
clanking 10
of 10
massive 10
bolts 10
drawn 10
back 10
a 10
key 10
was 10
turned 10
with 10
the 10
loud 10
grating 10
noise 10
of 10
long 10
disuse 10
and 10
the 10
great 10
door 10
swung 10
back 10
within 10
stood 10
a 10
tall 10
old 10
man 10
clean 10
shaven 10
save 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
white 10
moustache 10
and 10
clad 10
in 10
black 10
from 10
head 10
to 10
foot 10
without 10
a 10
single 10
speck 10
of 10
colour 10
about 10
him 10
anywhere 10
he 10
held 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
an 10
antique 10
silver 10
lamp 10
in 10
which 10
the 10
flame 10
burned 10
without 10
a 10
chimney 10
or 10
globe 10
of 10
any 10
kind 10
throwing 10
long 10
quivering 10
shadows 10
as 10
it 10
flickered 10
in 10
the 10
draught 10
of 10
the 10
open 10
door 10
the 10
old 10
man 10
motioned 10
me 10
in 10
with 10
his 10
right 10
hand 10
with 10
a 10
courtly 10
gesture 10
saying 10
in 10
excellent 10
english 10
but 10
with 10
a 10
strange 10
intonation 10
welcome 10
to 10
my 10
house 10
enter 10
freely 10
and 10
of 10
your 10
own 10
free 10
will 10
he 10
made 10
no 10
motion 10
of 10
stepping 10
to 10
meet 10
me 10
but 10
stood 10
like 10
a 10
statueas 10
though 10
his 10
gesture 10
of 10
welcome 10
had 10
fixed 10
him 10
into 10
stone 10
the 10
instant 10
however 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
stepped 10
over 10
the 10
threshold 10
he 10
moved 10
impulsively 10
forward 10
and 10
holding 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
grasped 10
mine 10
with 10
a 10
strength 10
which 10
made 10
me 10
wince 10
an 10
effect 10
which 10
was 10
not 10
lessened 10
by 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
it 10
seemed 10
cold 10
as 10
ice 10
more 10
like 10
the 10
hand 10
of 10
a 10
dead 10
than 10
a 10
living 10
man 10
again 10
he 10
said 10
welcome 10
to 10
my 10
house 10
enter 10
freely 10
go 10
safely 10
and 10
leave 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
happiness 10
you 10
bring 10
the 10
strength 10
of 10
the 10
handshake 10
was 10
so 10
much 10
akin 10
to 10
that 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
noticed 10
in 10
the 10
driver 10
whose 10
face 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
seen 10
that 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
doubted 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
not 10
the 10
same 10
person 10
to 10
whom 10
i 10
was 10
speaking 10
so 10
to 10
make 10
sure 10
i 10
said 10
interrogatively 10
count 10
dracula 10
he 10
bowed 10
in 10
a 10
courtly 10
was 10
as 10
he 10
replied 10
i 10
am 10
dracula 10
and 10
i 10
bid 10
you 10
welcome 10
mr 10
harker 10
to 10
my 10
house 10
come 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
air 10
is 10
chill 10
and 10
you 10
must 10
need 10
to 10
eat 10
and 10
restas 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
he 10
put 10
the 10
lamp 10
on 10
a 10
bracket 10
on 10
the 10
wall 10
and 10
stepping 10
out 10
took 10
my 10
luggage 10
he 10
had 10
carried 10
it 10
in 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
forestall 10
him 10
i 10
protested 10
but 10
he 10
insisted 10
nay 10
sir 10
you 10
are 10
my 10
guest 10

late 10

available 10

me 10
see 10
to 10
your 10
comfort 10
myselfhe 10
insisted 10
on 10
carrying 10
my 10
traps 10
along 10
the 10
passage 10
and 10
then 10
up 10
a 10
great 10
winding 10
stair 10
and 10
along 10
another 10
great 10
passage 10
on 10
whose 10
stone 10
floor 10
our 10
steps 10
rang 10
heavily 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
this 10
he 10
threw 10
open 10
a 10
heavy 10
door 10
and 10
i 10
rejoiced 10
to 10
see 10
within 10
a 10
welllit 10
room 10
in 10
which 10
a 10
table 10
was 10
spread 10
for 10
supper 10
and 10
on 10
whose 10
mighty 10
hearth 10
a 10
great 10
fire 10
of 10
logs 10
freshly 10
replenished 10
flamed 10
and 10
flared 10
the 10
count 10
halted 10
putting 10
down 10
my 10
bags 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
crossing 10
the 10
room 10
opened 10
another 10
door 10
which 10
led 10
into 10
a 10
small 10
octagonal 10
room 10
lit 10
by 10
a 10
single 10
lamp 10
and 10
seemingly 10
without 10
a 10
window 10
of 10
any 10
sort 10
passing 10
through 10
this 10
he 10
opened 10
another 10
door 10
and 10
motioned 10
me 10
to 10
enter 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
welcome 10
sight 10
for 10

a 10
great 10
bedroom 10
well 10
lighted 10
and 10
warmed 10
with 10
another 10
log 10

also 10
added 10
to 10
but 10
lately 10
for 10
the 10
top 10
logs 10
were 10
fresh 10
which 10
sent 10
a 10
hollow 10
roar 10
up 10
the 10
wide 10
chimney 10
the 10
count 10
himself 10
left 10
my 10
luggage 10
inside 10
and 10
withdrew 10
saying 10
before 10
he 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
you 10
will 10
need 10
after 10
your 10
journey 10
to 10

yourself 10
by 10
making 10
your 10
toilet 10

when 10
you 10
are 10
ready 10

the 10
light 10
and 10
warmth 10
and 10
the 10
counts 10
courteous 10
welcome 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
dissipated 10
all 10
my 10
doubts 10
and 10
fears 10
having 10
then 10
reached 10
my 10
normal 10
state 10
i 10
discovered 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
half 10
famished 10
with 10
hunger 10
so 10
making 10
a 10
hasty 10
toilet 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
other 10
room 10
i 10
found 10
supper 10
already 10
laid 10
out 10
my 10
host 10
who 10
stood 10
on 10
one 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
fireplace 10
leaning 10
against 10
the 10
stonework 10
made 10
a 10
graceful 10
wave 10
of 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
the 10
table 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
pray 10
you 10
be 10
seated 10
and 10
sup 10
how 10
you 10
please 10

me 10
that 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
join 10
you 10
but 10
i 10

already 10
and 10

i 10
handed 10
to 10
him 10
the 10
sealed 10
letter 10
which 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
had 10
entrusted 10
to 10
me 10
he 10
opened 10
it 10
and 10
read 10
it 10
gravely 10
then 10
with 10
a 10
charming 10
smile 10
he 10
handed 10
it 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
read 10
one 10
passage 10
of 10
it 10
at 10
least 10
gave 10
me 10
a 10
thrill 10
of 10
pleasure 10
i 10
must 10
regret 10
that 10
an 10
attack 10
of 10
gout 10
from 10
which 10
malady 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
constant 10
sufferer 10
forbids 10
absolutely 10
any 10
travelling 10
on 10
my 10
part 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
to 10
come 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
happy 10
to 10
say 10
i 10
can 10
send 10
a 10
sufficient 10
substitute 10
one 10
in 10
whom 10
i 10
have 10
every 10
possible 10
confidence 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
young 10
man 10
full 10
of 10
energy 10
and 10
talent 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
way 10
and 10
of 10
a 10
very 10
faithful 10
disposition 10
he 10
is 10
discreet 10
and 10
silent 10
and 10
has 10
grown 10
into 10
manhood 10

forward 10
and 10

off 10
the 10
cover 10
of 10
a 10
dish 10
and 10
i 10
fell 10
to 10
at 10
once 10
on 10
an 10
excellent 10
roast 10
chicken 10
this 10
with 10
some 10

and 10
a 10
salad 10
and 10
a 10
bottle 10
of 10
old 10
tokay 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
two 10
glasses 10

my 10

during 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
was 10
eating 10
it 10
the 10
count 10
asked 10
me 10
many 10
question 10
as 10
to 10
my 10
journey 10
and 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
by 10
degrees 10
all 10
i 10
had 10
experienced 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
my 10
supperand 10
by 10
my 10
hosts 10
desire 10
had 10
drawn 10
up 10
a 10
chair 10
by 10
the 10
fire 10
and 10
begun 10
to 10
smoke 10
a 10
cigar 10
which 10
he 10
offered 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
excusing 10
himself 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
smoke 10
i 10
had 10
now 10
an 10
opportunity 10
of 10
observing 10
him 10
and 10
found 10
him 10
of 10
a 10
very 10
marked 10
physiognomy 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
a 10
strong 10
a 10
very 10
strong 10
aquiline 10
with 10
high 10
bridge 10
of 10
the 10
thin 10
nose 10
and 10
peculiarly 10
arched 10
nostrils 10
with 10
lofty 10
domed 10
forehead 10
and 10
hair 10
growing 10
scantily 10
round 10
the 10
temples 10
but 10
profusely 10
elsewhere 10
his 10
eyebrows 10
were 10
very 10
massive 10
almost 10
meeting 10
over 10
the 10
nose 10
and 10
with 10
bushy 10
hair 10
that 10
seemed 10
to 10
curl 10
in 10
its 10
own 10
profusion 10
the 10
mouth 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
it 10
under 10
the 10
heavy 10
moustache 10
was 10
fixed 10
and 10
rather 10
cruellooking 10
with 10
peculiarly 10
sharp 10
white 10
teeth 10
these 10
protruded 10
over 10
the 10
lips 10
whose 10
remarkable 10
ruddiness 10
showed 10
astonishing 10
vitality 10
in 10
a 10
man 10
of 10
his 10
years 10
for 10
the 10
rest 10
his 10
ears 10
were 10
pale 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
tops 10
extremely 10
pointed 10
the 10
chin 10
was 10
broad 10
and 10
strong 10
and 10
the 10
cheeks 10
firm 10
though 10
thin 10
the 10
general 10
effect 10
was 10
one 10
of 10
extraordinary 10
pallor 10
hitherto 10
i 10
had 10
noticed 10
the 10
backs 10
of 10
his 10
hands 10
as 10
they 10
lay 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
in 10
the 10
firelight 10
and 10
they 10
had 10
seemed 10
rather 10
white 10
and 10
fine 10
but 10
seeing 10
them 10
now 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
notice 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
rather 10
coarse 10
broad 10
with 10
squat 10
fingers 10
strange 10
to 10
say 10
there 10
were 10
hairs 10
in 10
the 10
centre 10
of 10
the 10
palm 10
the 10
nails 10
were 10
long 10
and 10
fine 10
and 10
cut 10
to 10
a 10
sharp 10
point 10
as 10
the 10
count 10
leaned 10
over 10
me 10
and 10
his 10
hands 10
touched 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
repress 10
a 10
shudder 10
it 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
that 10
his 10
breath 10
was 10
rank 10
but 10
a 10
horrible 10
feeling 10
of 10
nausea 10
came 10
over 10
me 10
which 10
do 10
what 10
i 10
would 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
conceal 10
the 10
count 10
evidently 10
noticing 10
it 10
drew 10
back 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
grim 10
sort 10
of 10
smile 10
which 10
showed 10
more 10
than 10
he 10
had 10
yet 10
done 10
his 10
protruberant 10
teeth 10
sat 10
himself 10
down 10
again 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
fireplace 10
we 10
were 10
both 10
silent 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
towards 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
first 10
dim 10
streak 10
of 10
the 10
coming 10
dawn 10
there 10
seemed 10
a 10
strange 10
stillness 10
over 10
everything 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
listened 10
i 10
heard 10
as 10
if 10
from 10
down 10
below 10
in 10
the 10
valley 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
many 10
wolves 10
the 10
counts 10
eyes 10
gleamed 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
listen 10
to 10
them 10
the 10
children 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
what 10
music 10
they 10
make 10
seeing 10
i 10
suppose 10
some 10
expression 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
strange 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
added 10
ah 10
sir 10
you 10
dwellers 10
in 10
the 10
city 10
cannot 10
enter 10
into 10
the 10
feelings 10
of 10
the 10
hunter 10
then 10
he 10
rose 10
and 10
said 10
but 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
tired 10
your 10
bedroom 10
is 10
all 10
ready 10
and 10
tomorrow 10
you 10
shall 10
sleep 10
as 10
late 10
as 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
away 10
till 10
the 10
afternoon 10
so 10
sleep 10
well 10
and 10
dream 10
well 10
with 10
a 10
courteous 10
bow 10
he 10
opened 10
for 10
me 10
himself 10
the 10
door 10
to 10
the 10
octagonal 10
room 10
and 10
i 10
entered 10
my 10
bedroom 10
i 10
am 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
sea 10
of 10
wonders 10
i 10
doubt 10
i 10
fear 10
i 10
think 10
strange 10
things 10
which 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
confess 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
soul 10
god 10
keep 10
me 10
if 10
only 10
for 10
the 10
sake 10
of 10
those 10
dear 10
to 10
me 10
mayit 10
is 10
again 10
early 10
morning 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
rested 10
and 10
enjoyed 10
the 10
last 10
twentyfour 10
hours 10
i 10
slept 10
till 10
late 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
awoke 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
accord 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
dressed 10
myself 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
where 10
we 10
had 10
supped 10
and 10
found 10
a 10
cold 10
breakfast 10
laid 10
out 10
with 10
coffee 10
kept 10
hot 10
by 10
the 10
pot 10
being 10
placed 10
on 10
the 10
hearth 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
card 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
on 10
which 10
was 10
writteni 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
absent 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
do 10
not 10
wait 10
for 10
me 10
d 10
i 10
set 10
to 10
and 10
enjoyed 10
a 10
hearty 10
meal 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
done 10
i 10
looked 10
for 10
a 10
bell 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
let 10
the 10
servants 10
know 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
find 10
one 10
there 10
are 10
certainly 10
odd 10
deficiencies 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
considering 10
the 10
extraordinary 10
evidences 10
of 10
wealth 10
which 10
are 10
round 10
me 10
the 10
table 10
service 10
is 10
of 10
gold 10
and 10
so 10
beautifully 10
wrought 10
that 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
of 10
immense 10
value 10
the 10
curtains 10
and 10
upholstery 10
of 10
the 10
chairs 10
and 10
sofas 10
and 10
the 10
hangings 10
of 10
my 10
bed 10
are 10
of 10
the 10
costliest 10
and 10
most 10
beautiful 10
fabrics 10
and 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
of 10
fabulous 10
value 10
when 10
they 10
were 10
made 10
for 10
they 10
are 10
centuries 10
old 10
though 10
in 10
excellent 10
order 10
i 10
saw 10
something 10
like 10
them 10
in 10
hampton 10
court 10
but 10
they 10
were 10
worn 10
and 10
frayed 10
and 10
motheaten 10
but 10
still 10
in 10
none 10
of 10
the 10
rooms 10
is 10
there 10
a 10
mirror 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
even 10
a 10
toilet 10
glass 10
on 10
my 10
table 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
get 10
the 10
little 10
shaving 10
glass 10
from 10
my 10
bag 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
either 10
shave 10
or 10
brush 10
my 10
hair 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
yet 10
seen 10
a 10
servant 10
anywhere 10
or 10
heard 10
a 10
sound 10
near 10
the 10
castle 10
except 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
some 10
time 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
my 10
meal 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
whether 10
to 10
call 10
it 10
breakfast 10
of 10
dinner 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
between 10
five 10
and 10
six 10
oclock 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
it 10
i 10
looked 10
about 10
for 10
something 10
to 10
read 10
for 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
like 10
to 10
go 10
about 10
the 10
castle 10
until 10
i 10
had 10
asked 10
the 10
counts 10
permission 10
there 10
was 10
absolutely 10
nothing 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
book 10
newspaper 10
or 10
even 10
writing 10
materials 10
so 10
i 10
opened 10
another 10
door 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
found 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
library 10
the 10
door 10
opposite 10
mine 10
i 10
tried 10
but 10
found 10
locked 10
in 10
the 10
library 10
i 10
found 10
to 10
my 10
great 10
delight 10
a 10
vast 10
number 10
of 10
english 10
books 10
whole 10
shelves 10
full 10
of 10
them 10
and 10
bound 10
volumes 10
of 10
magazines 10
and 10
newspapers 10
a 10
table 10
in 10
the 10
center 10
was 10
littered 10
with 10
english 10
magazines 10
and 10
newspapers 10
though 10
none 10
of 10
them 10
were 10
of 10
very 10
recent 10
date 10
the 10
books 10
were 10
of 10
the 10
most 10
varied 10
kind 10
history 10
geography 10
politics 10
political 10
economy 10
botany 10
geology 10
law 10
all 10
relating 10
to 10
england 10
and 10
english 10
life 10
and 10
customs 10
and 10
manners 10
there 10
were 10
even 10
such 10
books 10
of 10
reference 10
as 10
the 10
london 10
directory 10
the 10
red 10
and 10
blue 10
books 10
whitakers 10
almanac 10
the 10
army 10
and 10
navy 10
lists 10
and 10
it 10
somehow 10
gladdened 10
my 10
heart 10
to 10
see 10
it 10
the 10
law 10
list 10
whilst 10
i 10
was 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
books 10
the 10
door 10
opened 10
and 10
the 10
count 10
entered 10
he 10
saluted 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
hearty 10
way 10
and 10
hoped 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
had 10
a 10
good 10
nights 10
rest 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
you 10
found 10
your 10
way 10
in 10
here 10
for 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
there 10
is 10
much 10
that 10
will 10
interest 10
you 10
these 10
companions 10
and 10
he 10

through 10
the 10
crowded 10
streets 10
of 10
your 10
mighty 10
london 10
to 10
be 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
the 10
whirl 10
and 10
rush 10
of 10
humanity 10
to 10
share 10
its 10
life 10
its 10

death 10
and 10
all 10
that 10

i 10
said 10
you 10

and 10
speak 10
english 10
thoroughly 10
he 10
bowed 10
gravely 10

you 10
my 10
friend 10
for 10
your 10
all 10
tooflattering 10
estimate 10
but 10
yet 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
but 10
a 10
little 10
way 10
on 10
the 10
road 10
i 10
would 10
travel 10
true 10
i 10
know 10
the 10
grammar 10
and 10
the 10
words 10
but 10
yet 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
how 10
to 10
speak 10
them 10
indeed 10
i 10
said 10
you 10
speak 10
excellently 10
not 10
so 10
he 10
answered 10
well 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
did 10
i 10
move 10
and 10
speak 10
in 10
your 10
london 10
none 10
there 10
are 10
who 10
would 10
not 10
know 10
me 10
for 10
a 10
stranger 10
that 10
is 10
not 10
enough 10
for 10
me 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
noble 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
boyar 10
the 10
common 10
people 10
know 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
master 10
but 10
a 10
stranger 10
in 10
a 10
strange 10
land 10
he 10
is 10
no 10
one 10
men 10
know 10
him 10
not 10
and 10
to 10
know 10
not 10
is 10
to 10
care 10
not 10
for 10
i 10
am 10
content 10
if 10
i 10
am 10
like 10
the 10
rest 10
so 10
that 10
no 10
man 10
stops 10
if 10
he 10
sees 10
me 10
or 10
pauses 10
in 10
his 10
speaking 10
if 10
he 10
hears 10
my 10
words 10
ha 10
ha 10
a 10
stranger 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
so 10
long 10
master 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
be 10
master 10
still 10
or 10
at 10
least 10
that 10
none 10
other 10
should 10
be 10
master 10
of 10
me 10
you 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
not 10
alone 10
as 10
agent 10
of 10
my 10
friend 10
peter 10
hawkins 10
of 10
exeter 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
about 10
my 10
new 10
estate 10
in 10
london 10
you 10
shall 10
i 10
trust 10
rest 10
here 10
with 10
me 10
a 10
while 10
so 10
that 10
by 10
our 10
talking 10
i 10
may 10
learn 10
the 10
english 10
intonation 10
and 10
i 10
would 10
that 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
make 10
error 10
even 10
of 10
the 10
smallest 10
in 10
my 10
speaking 10
i 10
am 10
sorry 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
be 10
away 10
so 10
long 10
today 10
but 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
know 10
forgive 10
one 10
who 10
has 10
so 10
many 10
important 10
affairs 10
in 10
hand 10
of 10
course 10
i 10
said 10
all 10
i 10
could 10
about 10
being 10
willing 10
and 10
asked 10
if 10
i 10
might 10
come 10
into 10
that 10
room 10
when 10
i 10
chose 10
he 10
answered 10
yes 10
certainly 10
and 10
added 10
you 10
may 10
go 10
anywhere 10
you 10
wish 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
except 10
where 10
the 10
doors 10
are 10
locked 10
where 10
of 10
course 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
wish 10
to 10
go 10
there 10
is 10
reason 10
that 10
all 10
things 10
are 10
as 10
they 10
are 10
and 10
did 10
you 10
see 10
with 10
my 10
eyes 10
and 10
know 10
with 10
my 10
knowledge 10
you 10
would 10
perhaps 10
better 10
understand 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
was 10
sure 10
of 10
this 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
transylvania 10
and 10
transylvania 10
is 10
not 10
england 10
our 10
ways 10
are 10
not 10
your 10
ways 10
and 10
there 10
shall 10
be 10
to 10
you 10
many 10
strange 10
things 10
nay 10
from 10
what 10
you 10
have 10
told 10
me 10
of 10
your 10
experiences 10
already 10
you 10
know 10
something 10
of 10
what 10
strange 10
things 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
this 10
led 10
to 10
much 10
conversation 10
and 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
talk 10
if 10
only 10
for 10
talkings 10
sake 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
many 10
questions 10
regarding 10
things 10
that 10
had 10
already 10
happened 10
to 10
me 10
or 10
come 10
within 10
my 10
notice 10
sometimes 10
he 10
sheered 10
off 10
the 10
subject 10
or 10
turned 10
the 10
conversation 10
by 10
pretending 10
not 10
to 10
understand 10
but 10
generally 10
he 10
answered 10
all 10
i 10
asked 10
most 10
frankly 10
then 10
as 10
time 10
went 10
on 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
got 10
somewhat 10
bolder 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
of 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
strange 10
things 10
of 10
the 10
preceding 10
night 10
as 10
for 10
instance 10
why 10
the 10
coachman 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
places 10
where 10
he 10
had 10
seen 10
the 10
blue 10
flames 10
he 10
then 10
explained 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
commonly 10
believed 10
that 10
on 10
a 10
certain 10
night 10
of 10
the 10
year 10
last 10
night 10
in 10
fact 10
when 10
all 10
evil 10
spirits 10
are 10
supposed 10
to 10
have 10
unchecked 10
sway 10
a 10
blue 10
flame 10
is 10
seen 10
over 10
any 10
place 10
where 10
treasure 10
has 10
been 10
concealed 10
that 10
treasure 10
has 10
been 10
hidden 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
in 10
the 10
region 10
through 10
which 10
you 10
came 10
last 10
night 10
there 10
can 10
be 10
but 10
little 10
doubt 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
ground 10
fought 10
over 10
for 10
centuries 10
by 10
the 10
wallachian 10
the 10
saxon 10
and 10
the 10
turk 10
why 10
there 10
is 10
hardly 10
a 10
foot 10
of 10
soil 10
in 10
all 10
this 10
region 10
that 10
has 10
not 10
been 10
enriched 10
by 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
men 10
patriots 10
or 10
invaders 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
days 10
there 10
were 10
stirring 10
times 10
when 10
the 10
austrian 10
and 10
the 10
hungarian 10
came 10
up 10
in 10
hordes 10
and 10
the 10
patriots 10
went 10
out 10
to 10
meet 10
them 10
men 10
and 10
women 10
the 10
aged 10
and 10
the 10
children 10
too 10
and 10
waited 10
their 10
coming 10
on 10
the 10
rocks 10
above 10
the 10
passes 10
that 10
they 10
might 10
sweep 10
destruction 10
on 10
them 10
with 10
their 10
artificial 10
avalanches 10
when 10
the 10
invader 10
was 10
triumphant 10
he 10
found 10
but 10
little 10
for 10
whatever 10
there 10
was 10
had 10
been 10
sheltered 10
in 10
the 10
friendly 10
soil 10
but 10
how 10
said 10
i 10
can 10
it 10
have 10
remained 10
so 10
long 10
undiscovered 10
when 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
sure 10
index 10
to 10
it 10
if 10
men 10
will 10
but 10
take 10
the 10
trouble 10
to 10
look 10
the 10
count 10
smiled 10
and 10
as 10
his 10
lips 10
ran 10
back 10
over 10
his 10
gums 10
the 10
long 10
sharp 10
canine 10
teeth 10
showed 10
out 10
strangely 10
he 10
answered 10
because 10
your 10
peasant 10
is 10
at 10
heart 10
a 10
coward 10
and 10
a 10
fool 10
those 10
flames 10
only 10
appear 10
on 10
one 10
night 10
and 10
on 10
that 10
night 10
no 10
man 10
of 10
this 10
land 10
will 10
if 10
he 10
can 10
help 10
it 10
stir 10
without 10
his 10
doors 10
and 10
dear 10
sir 10
even 10
if 10
he 10
did 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
why 10
even 10
the 10
peasant 10
that 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
of 10
who 10
marked 10
the 10
place 10
of 10
the 10
flame 10
would 10
not 10
know 10
where 10
to 10
look 10
in 10
daylight 10
even 10
for 10
his 10
own 10
work 10
even 10
you 10
would 10
not 10
i 10
dare 10
be 10
sworn 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
find 10
these 10
places 10
again 10
there 10
you 10
are 10
right 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
know 10
no 10
more 10
than 10
the 10
dead 10
where 10
even 10
to 10
look 10
for 10
them 10
then 10
we 10
drifted 10
into 10
other 10
matters 10
come 10
he 10
said 10
at 10
last 10
tell 10
me 10
of 10
london 10
and 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
which 10
you 10
have 10
procured 10
for 10
me 10
with 10
an 10
apology 10
for 10
my 10
remissness 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
my 10
own 10
room 10
to 10
get 10
the 10
papers 10
from 10
my 10
bag 10
whilst 10
i 10
was 10
placing 10
them 10
in 10
order 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
rattling 10
of 10
china 10
and 10
silver 10
in 10
the 10
next 10
room 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
passed 10
through 10
noticed 10
that 10
the 10
table 10
had 10
been 10
cleared 10
and 10
the 10
lamp 10
lit 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
deep 10
into 10
the 10
dark 10
the 10
lamps 10
were 10
also 10
lit 10
in 10
the 10
study 10
or 10
library 10
and 10
i 10
found 10
the 10
count 10
lying 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
reading 10
of 10
all 10
things 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
english 10
bradshaws 10
guide 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
he 10
cleared 10
the 10
books 10
and 10
papers 10
from 10
the 10
table 10
and 10
with 10
him 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
plans 10
and 10
deeds 10
and 10
figures 10
of 10
all 10
sorts 10
he 10
was 10
interested 10
in 10
everything 10
and 10
asked 10
me 10
a 10
myriad 10
questions 10
about 10
the 10
place 10
and 10
its 10
surroundings 10
he 10
clearly 10
had 10
studied 10
beforehand 10
all 10
he 10
could 10
get 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
of 10
the 10
neighborhood 10
for 10
he 10
evidently 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
knew 10
very 10
much 10
more 10
than 10
i 10
did 10
when 10
i 10
remarked 10
this 10
he 10
answered 10
well 10
but 10
my 10
friend 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
needful 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
when 10
i 10
go 10
there 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10

my 10
friend 10
harker 10
jonathan 10

fall 10
into 10
my 10
countrys 10
habit 10
of 10
putting 10
your 10
patronymic 10
first 10
my 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
harker 10
will 10
not 10
be 10
by 10
my 10
side 10
to 10
correct 10
and 10
aid 10
me 10
he 10
will 10
be 10
in 10
exeter 10
miles 10
away 10
probably 10
working 10
at 10
papers 10
of 10
the 10
law 10
with 10
my 10
other 10
friend 10
peter 10
hawkins 10
so 10
we 10
went 10
thoroughly 10
into 10
the 10
business 10
of 10
the 10
purchase 10
of 10
the 10
estate 10
at 10
purfleet 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
told 10
him 10
the 10
facts 10
and 10
got 10
his 10
signature 10
to 10
the 10
necessary 10
papers 10
and 10
had 10
written 10
a 10
letter 10
with 10
them 10
ready 10
to 10
post 10
to 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
ask 10
me 10
how 10
i 10
had 10
come 10
across 10
so 10
suitable 10
a 10
place 10
i 10
read 10
to 10
him 10
the 10
notes 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
made 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
and 10
which 10
i 10
inscribe 10
here 10
at 10
purfleet 10
on 10
a 10
byroad 10
i 10
came 10
across 10
just 10
such 10
a 10
place 10
as 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
required 10
and 10
where 10
was 10
displayed 10
a 10
dilapidated 10
notice 10
that 10
the 10
place 10
was 10
for 10
sale 10
it 10
was 10
surrounded 10
by 10
a 10
high 10
wall 10
of 10
ancient 10
structure 10
built 10
of 10
heavy 10
stones 10
and 10
has 10
not 10
been 10
repaired 10
for 10
a 10
large 10
number 10
of 10
years 10
the 10
closed 10
gates 10
are 10
of 10
heavy 10
old 10
oak 10
and 10
iron 10
all 10
eaten 10
with 10
rust 10
the 10
estate 10
is 10
called 10
carfax 10
no 10
doubt 10
a 10
corruption 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
quatre 10
face 10
as 10
the 10
house 10
is 10
four 10
sided 10
agreeing 10
with 10
the 10
cardinal 10
points 10
of 10
the 10
compass 10
it 10
contains 10
in 10
all 10
some 10
twenty 10
acres 10
quite 10
surrounded 10
by 10
the 10
solid 10
stone 10
wall 10
above 10
mentioned 10
there 10
are 10
many 10
trees 10
on 10
it 10
which 10
make 10
it 10
in 10
places 10
gloomy 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
deep 10
darklooking 10
pond 10
or 10
small 10
lake 10
evidently 10
fed 10
by 10
some 10
springs 10
as 10
the 10
water 10
is 10
clear 10
and 10
flows 10
away 10
in 10
a 10
fairsized 10
stream 10
the 10
house 10
is 10
very 10
large 10
and 10
of 10
all 10
periods 10
back 10
i 10
should 10
say 10
to 10
mediaeval 10
times 10
for 10
one 10
part 10
is 10
of 10
stone 10
immensely 10
thick 10
with 10
only 10
a 10
few 10
windows 10
high 10
up 10
and 10
heavily 10
barred 10
with 10
iron 10
it 10
looks 10
like 10
part 10
of 10
a 10
keep 10
and 10
is 10
close 10
to 10
an 10
old 10
chapel 10
or 10
church 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
enter 10
it 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
leading 10
to 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
house 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
taken 10
with 10
my 10
kodak 10
views 10
of 10
it 10
from 10
various 10
points 10
the 10
house 10
had 10
been 10
added 10
to 10
but 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
straggling 10
way 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
only 10
guess 10
at 10
the 10
amount 10
of 10
ground 10
it 10
covers 10
which 10
must 10
be 10
very 10
great 10
there 10
are 10
but 10
few 10
houses 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
one 10
being 10
a 10
very 10
large 10
house 10
only 10
recently 10
added 10
to 10
and 10
formed 10
into 10
a 10
private 10
lunatic 10
asylum 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
however 10
visible 10
from 10
the 10
grounds 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
old 10
and 10
big 10
i 10
myself 10
am 10
of 10
an 10
old 10
family 10
and 10
to 10
live 10
in 10
a 10
new 10
house 10
would 10
kill 10
me 10
a 10
house 10
cannot 10
be 10
made 10
habitable 10
in 10
a 10
day 10
and 10
after 10
all 10
how 10
few 10
days 10
go 10
to 10
make 10
up 10
a 10
century 10
i 10
rejoice 10
also 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
chapel 10
of 10
old 10
times 10
we 10
transylvanian 10
nobles 10
love 10
not 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
our 10
bones 10
may 10
lie 10
amongst 10
the 10
common 10
dead 10
i 10
seek 10
not 10
gaiety 10
nor 10
mirth 10
not 10
the 10
bright 10
voluptuousness 10
of 10
much 10
sunshine 10
and 10
sparkling 10
waters 10
which 10
please 10
the 10
young 10
and 10
gay 10
i 10
am 10
no 10
longer 10
young 10
and 10
my 10
heart 10
through 10
weary 10
years 10
of 10
mourning 10
over 10
the 10
dead 10
is 10
attuned 10
to 10
mirth 10
moreover 10
the 10
walls 10
of 10
my 10
castle 10
are 10
broken 10
the 10
shadows 10
are 10
many 10
and 10
the 10
wind 10
breathes 10
cold 10
through 10
the 10
broken 10
battlements 10
and 10
casements 10
i 10
love 10
the 10
shade 10
and 10
the 10
shadow 10
and 10
would 10
be 10
alone 10
with 10
my 10
thoughts 10
when 10
i 10
may 10
somehow 10
his 10
words 10
and 10
his 10
look 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
accord 10
or 10
else 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
his 10
cast 10
of 10
face 10
made 10
his 10
smile 10
look 10
malignant 10
and 10
saturnine 10
presently 10
with 10
an 10
excuse 10
he 10
left 10
me 10
asking 10
me 10
to 10
pull 10
my 10
papers 10
together 10
he 10
was 10
some 10
little 10
time 10
away 10
and 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
books 10
around 10
me 10
one 10
was 10
an 10
atlas 10
which 10
i 10
found 10
opened 10
naturally 10
to 10
england 10
as 10
if 10
that 10
map 10
had 10
been 10
much 10
used 10
on 10
looking 10
at 10
it 10
i 10
found 10
in 10
certain 10
places 10
little 10
rings 10
marked 10
and 10
on 10
examining 10
these 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
one 10
was 10
near 10
london 10
on 10
the 10
east 10
side 10
manifestly 10
where 10
his 10
new 10
estate 10
was 10
situated 10
the 10
other 10
two 10
were 10
exeter 10
and 10
whitby 10
on 10
the 10
yorkshire 10
coast 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
better 10
part 10
of 10
an 10
hour 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
returned 10
aha 10
he 10
said 10
still 10
at 10
your 10
books 10
good 10
but 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
work 10
always 10
come 10
i 10
am 10
informed 10
that 10
your 10
supper 10
is 10
ready 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
arm 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
next 10
room 10
where 10
i 10
found 10
an 10
excellent 10
supper 10
ready 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
the 10
count 10
again 10
excused 10
himself 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
dined 10
out 10
on 10
his 10
being 10
away 10
from 10
home 10
but 10
he 10
sat 10
as 10
on 10
the 10
previous 10
night 10
and 10
chatted 10
whilst 10
i 10
ate 10
after 10
supper 10
i 10
smoked 10
as 10
on 10
the 10
last 10
evening 10
and 10
the 10
count 10
stayed 10
with 10
me 10
chatting 10
and 10
asking 10
questions 10
on 10
every 10
conceivable 10
subject 10
hour 10
after 10
hour 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
getting 10
very 10
late 10
indeed 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
say 10
anything 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
under 10
obligation 10
to 10
meet 10
my 10
hosts 10
wishes 10
in 10
every 10
way 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
sleepy 10
as 10
the 10
long 10
sleep 10
yesterday 10
had 10
fortified 10
me 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
help 10
experiencing 10
that 10
chill 10
which 10
comes 10
over 10
one 10
at 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
dawn 10
which 10
is 10
like 10
in 10
its 10
way 10
the 10
turn 10
of 10
the 10
tide 10
they 10
say 10
that 10
people 10
who 10
are 10
near 10
death 10
die 10
generally 10
at 10
the 10
change 10
to 10
dawn 10
or 10
at 10
the 10
turn 10
of 10
the 10
tide 10
anyone 10
who 10
has 10
when 10
tired 10
and 10
tied 10
as 10
it 10
were 10
to 10
his 10
post 10
experienced 10
this 10
change 10
in 10
the 10
atmosphere 10
can 10
well 10
believe 10
it 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
we 10
heard 10
the 10
crow 10
of 10
the 10
cock 10
coming 10
up 10
with 10
preternatural 10
shrillness 10
through 10
the 10
clear 10
morning 10
air 10
count 10
dracula 10
jumping 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10
said 10
why 10
there 10
is 10
the 10
morning 10
again 10
how 10
remiss 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
let 10
you 10
stay 10
up 10
so 10
long 10
you 10
must 10
make 10
your 10
conversation 10
regarding 10
my 10
dear 10
new 10
country 10
of 10
england 10
less 10
interesting 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
forget 10
how 10
time 10
flies 10
by 10
us 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
courtly 10
bow 10
he 10
quickly 10
left 10
me 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
drew 10
the 10
curtains 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
little 10
to 10
notice 10
my 10
window 10
opened 10
into 10
the 10
courtyard 10
all 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
was 10
the 10
warm 10
grey 10
of 10
quickening 10
sky 10
so 10
i 10
pulled 10
the 10
curtains 10
again 10
and 10
have 10
written 10
of 10
this 10
day 10
mayi 10
began 10
to 10
fear 10
as 10
i 10
wrote 10
in 10
this 10
book 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
getting 10
too 10
diffuse 10
but 10
now 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
that 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
detail 10
from 10
the 10
first 10
for 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
so 10
strange 10
about 10
this 10
place 10
and 10
all 10
in 10
it 10
that 10
i 10
cannot 10
but 10
feel 10
uneasy 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
were 10
safe 10
out 10
of 10
it 10
or 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
never 10
come 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
this 10
strange 10
night 10
existence 10
is 10
telling 10
on 10
me 10
but 10
would 10
that 10
that 10
were 10
all 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
any 10
one 10
to 10
talk 10
to 10
i 10
could 10
bear 10
it 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
one 10
i 10
have 10
only 10
the 10
count 10
to 10
speak 10
with 10
and 10
hei 10
fear 10
i 10
am 10
myself 10
the 10
only 10
living 10
soul 10
within 10
the 10
place 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
prosaiac 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
facts 10
can 10
be 10
it 10
will 10
help 10
me 10
to 10
bear 10
up 10
and 10
imagination 10
must 10
not 10
run 10
riot 10
with 10
me 10
if 10
it 10
does 10
i 10
am 10
lost 10
let 10
me 10
say 10
at 10
once 10
how 10
i 10
stand 10
or 10
seem 10
to 10
i 10
only 10
slept 10
a 10
few 10
hours 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
bedand 10
feeling 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
sleep 10
any 10
more 10
got 10
up 10
i 10
had 10
hung 10
my 10
shaving 10
glass 10
by 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
was 10
just 10
beginning 10
to 10
shave 10
suddenly 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
hand 10
on 10
my 10
shoulder 10
and 10
heard 10
the 10
counts 10
voice 10
saying 10
to 10
me 10
good 10
morning 10
i 10
started 10
for 10
it 10
amazed 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
seen 10
him 10
since 10
the 10
reflection 10
of 10
the 10
glass 10
covered 10
the 10
whole 10
room 10
behind 10
me 10
in 10
starting 10
i 10
had 10
cut 10
myself 10
slightly 10
but 10
did 10
not 10
notice 10
it 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
having 10
answered 10
the 10
counts 10
salutation 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
the 10
glass 10
again 10
to 10
see 10
how 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
mistaken 10
this 10
time 10
there 10
could 10
be 10
no 10
error 10
for 10
the 10
man 10
was 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
him 10
over 10
my 10
shoulder 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
reflection 10
of 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
mirror 10
the 10
whole 10
room 10
behind 10
me 10
was 10
displayed 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
a 10
man 10
in 10
it 10
except 10
myself 10
this 10
was 10
startling 10
and 10
coming 10
on 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
so 10
many 10
strange 10
things 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
increase 10
that 10
vague 10
feeling 10
of 10
uneasiness 10
which 10
i 10
always 10
have 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
is 10
near 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
instant 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
the 10
cut 10
had 10
bled 10
a 10
little 10
and 10
the 10
blood 10
was 10
trickling 10
over 10
my 10
chin 10
i 10
laid 10
down 10
the 10
razor 10
turning 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
half 10
round 10
to 10
look 10
for 10
some 10
sticking 10
plaster 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
saw 10
my 10
face 10
his 10
eyes 10
blazed 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
demoniac 10
fury 10
and 10
he 10
suddenly 10
made 10
a 10
grab 10
at 10
my 10
throat 10
i 10
drew 10
away 10
and 10
his 10
hand 10
touched 10
the 10
string 10
of 10
beads 10
which 10
held 10
the 10
crucifix 10
it 10
made 10
an 10
instant 10
change 10
in 10
him 10
for 10
the 10
fury 10
passed 10
so 10
quickly 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
hardly 10
believe 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
ever 10
there 10
take 10
care 10
he 10
said 10
take 10
care 10
how 10
you 10
cut 10
yourself 10
it 10
is 10
more 10
dangerous 10
that 10
you 10
think 10
in 10
this 10
country 10
then 10
seizing 10
the 10
shaving 10
glass 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
and 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
wretched 10
thing 10
that 10
has 10
done 10
the 10
mischief 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
foul 10
bauble 10
of 10
mans 10
vanity 10
away 10
with 10
it 10
and 10
opening 10
the 10
window 10
with 10
one 10
wrench 10
of 10
his 10
terrible 10
hand 10
he 10
flung 10
out 10
the 10
glass 10
which 10
was 10
shattered 10
into 10
a 10
thousand 10
pieces 10
on 10
the 10
stones 10
of 10
the 10
courtyard 10
far 10
below 10
then 10
he 10
withdrew 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
it 10
is 10
very 10
annoying 10
for 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
see 10
how 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
shave 10
unless 10
in 10
my 10
watchcase 10
or 10
the 10
bottom 10
of 10
the 10
shaving 10
pot 10
which 10
is 10
fortunately 10
of 10
metal 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
breakfast 10
was 10
prepared 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
find 10
the 10
count 10
anywhere 10
so 10
i 10
breakfasted 10
alone 10
it 10
is 10
strange 10
that 10
as 10
yet 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
seen 10
the 10
count 10
eat 10
or 10
drink 10
he 10
must 10
be 10
a 10
very 10
peculiar 10
man 10
after 10
breakfast 10
i 10
did 10
a 10
little 10
exploring 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
i 10
went 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
stairs 10
and 10
found 10
a 10
room 10
looking 10
towards 10
the 10
south 10
the 10
view 10
was 10
magnificent 10
and 10
from 10
where 10
i 10
stood 10
there 10
was 10
every 10
opportunity 10
of 10
seeing 10
it 10
the 10
castle 10
is 10
on 10
the 10
very 10
edge 10
of 10
a 10
terrific 10
precipice 10
a 10
stone 10
falling 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
would 10
fall 10
a 10
thousand 10
feet 10
without 10
touching 10
anything 10
as 10
far 10
as 10
the 10
eye 10
can 10
reach 10
is 10
a 10
sea 10
of 10
green 10
tree 10
tops 10
with 10
occasionally 10
a 10
deep 10
rift 10
where 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
chasm 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
are 10
silver 10
threads 10
where 10
the 10
rivers 10
wind 10
in 10
deep 10
gorges 10
through 10
the 10
forests 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
in 10
heart 10
to 10
describe 10
beauty 10
for 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
the 10
view 10
i 10
explored 10
further 10
doors 10
doors 10
doors 10
everywhere 10
and 10
all 10
locked 10
and 10
bolted 10
in 10
no 10
place 10
save 10
from 10
the 10
windows 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
walls 10
is 10
there 10
an 10
available 10
exit 10
the 10
castle 10
is 10
a 10
veritable 10
prison 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
prisoner 10
chapter 10
jonathan 10
harkers 10
journal 10
continued 10
when 10
i 10
found 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
a 10
prisoner 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
wild 10
feeling 10
came 10
over 10
me 10
i 10
rushed 10
up 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
stairs 10
trying 10
every 10
door 10
and 10
peering 10
out 10
of 10
every 10
window 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
but 10
after 10
a 10
little 10
the 10
conviction 10
of 10
my 10
helplessness 10
overpowered 10
all 10
other 10
feelings 10
when 10
i 10
look 10
back 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
hours 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
mad 10
for 10
the 10
time 10
for 10
i 10
behaved 10
much 10
as 10
a 10
rat 10
does 10
in 10
a 10
trap 10
when 10
however 10
the 10
conviction 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
helpless 10
i 10
sat 10
down 10
quietly 10
as 10
quietly 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
ever 10
done 10
anything 10
in 10
my 10
life 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
think 10
over 10
what 10
was 10
best 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
i 10
am 10
thinking 10
still 10
and 10
as 10
yet 10
have 10
come 10
to 10
no 10
definite 10
conclusion 10
of 10
one 10
thing 10
only 10
am 10
i 10
certain 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
use 10
making 10
my 10
ideas 10
known 10
to 10
the 10
count 10
he 10
knows 10
well 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
imprisoned 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
has 10
done 10
it 10
himself 10
and 10
has 10
doubtless 10
his 10
own 10
motives 10
for 10
it 10
he 10
would 10
only 10
deceive 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
trusted 10
him 10
fully 10
with 10
the 10
facts 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
my 10
only 10
plan 10
will 10
be 10
to 10
keep 10
my 10
knowledge 10
and 10
my 10
fears 10
to 10
myself 10
and 10
my 10
eyes 10
open 10
i 10
am 10
i 10
know 10
either 10
being 10
deceived 10
like 10
a 10
baby 10
by 10
my 10
own 10
fears 10
or 10
else 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
desperate 10
straits 10
and 10
if 10
the 10
latter 10
be 10
so 10
i 10
need 10
and 10
shall 10
need 10
all 10
my 10
brains 10
to 10
get 10
through 10
i 10
had 10
hardly 10
come 10
to 10
this 10
conclusion 10
when 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
great 10
door 10
below 10
shut 10
and 10
knew 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
returned 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
come 10
at 10
once 10
into 10
the 10
library 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
cautiously 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
room 10
and 10
found 10
him 10
making 10
the 10
bed 10
this 10
was 10
odd 10
but 10
only 10
confirmed 10
what 10
i 10
had 10
all 10
along 10
thought 10
that 10
there 10
are 10
no 10
servants 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
when 10
later 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
through 10
the 10
chink 10
of 10
the 10
hinges 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
laying 10
the 10
table 10
in 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
i 10
was 10
assured 10
of 10
it 10
for 10
if 10
he 10
does 10
himself 10
all 10
these 10
menial 10
offices 10
surely 10
it 10
is 10
proof 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
one 10
else 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
it 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
the 10
count 10
himself 10
who 10
was 10
the 10
driver 10
of 10
the 10
coach 10
that 10
brought 10
me 10
here 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
terrible 10
thought 10
for 10
if 10
so 10
what 10
does 10
it 10
mean 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
control 10
the 10
wolves 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
by 10
only 10
holding 10
up 10
his 10
hand 10
for 10
silence 10
how 10
was 10
it 10
that 10
all 10
the 10
people 10
at 10
bistritz 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
coach 10
had 10
some 10
terrible 10
fear 10
for 10
me 10
what 10
meant 10
the 10
giving 10
of 10
the 10
crucifix 10
of 10
the 10
garlic 10
of 10
the 10
wild 10
rose 10
of 10
the 10
mountain 10
ash 10
bless 10
that 10
good 10
good 10
woman 10
who 10
hung 10
the 10
crucifix 10
round 10
my 10
neck 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
comfort 10
and 10
a 10
strength 10
to 10
me 10
whenever 10
i 10
touch 10
it 10
it 10
is 10
odd 10
that 10
a 10
thing 10
which 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
taught 10
to 10
regard 10
with 10
disfavour 10
and 10
as 10
idolatrous 10
should 10
in 10
a 10
time 10
of 10
loneliness 10
and 10
trouble 10
be 10
of 10
help 10
is 10
it 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
in 10
the 10
essence 10
of 10
the 10
thing 10
itself 10
or 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
medium 10
a 10
tangible 10
help 10
in 10
conveying 10
memories 10
of 10
sympathy 10
and 10
comfort 10
some 10
time 10
if 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
i 10
must 10
examine 10
this 10
matter 10
and 10
try 10
to 10
make 10
up 10
my 10
mind 10
about 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
i 10
must 10
find 10
out 10
all 10
i 10
can 10
about 10
count 10
draculaas 10
it 10
may 10
help 10
me 10
to 10
understand 10
tonight 10
he 10
may 10
talk 10
of 10
himself 10
if 10
i 10
turn 10
the 10
conversation 10
that 10
way 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
very 10
careful 10
however 10
not 10
to 10
awake 10
his 10
suspicion 10
midnighti 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
long 10
talk 10
with 10
the 10
count 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
a 10
few 10
questions 10
on 10
transylvania 10
history 10
and 10
he 10
warmed 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
subject 10
wonderfully 10
in 10
his 10
speaking 10
of 10
things 10
and 10
people 10
and 10
especially 10
of 10
battles 10
he 10
spoke 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
present 10
at 10
them 10
all 10
this 10
he 10
afterwards 10
explained 10
by 10
saying 10
that 10
to 10
a 10
boyar 10
the 10
pride 10
of 10
his 10
house 10
and 10
name 10
is 10
his 10
own 10
pride 10
that 10
their 10
glory 10
is 10
his 10
glory 10
that 10
their 10
fate 10
is 10
his 10
fate 10
whenever 10
he 10
spoke 10
of 10
his 10
house 10
he 10
always 10
said 10
we 10
and 10
spoke 10
almost 10
in 10
the 10
plural 10
like 10
a 10
king 10
speaking 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
put 10
down 10
all 10
he 10
said 10
exactly 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
it 10
for 10
to 10
me 10
it 10
was 10
most 10
fascinating 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
in 10
it 10
a 10
whole 10
history 10
of 10
the 10
country 10
he 10
grew 10
excited 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
and 10
walked 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
pulling 10
his 10
great 10
white 10
moustache 10
and 10
grasping 10
anything 10
on 10
which 10
he 10
laid 10
his 10
hands 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
would 10
crush 10
it 10
by 10
main 10
strength 10
one 10
thing 10
he 10
said 10
which 10
i 10
shall 10
put 10
down 10
as 10
nearly 10
as 10
i 10
can 10
for 10
it 10
tells 10
in 10
its 10
way 10
the 10
story 10
of 10
his 10
race 10
we 10
szekelys 10
have 10
a 10
right 10
to 10
be 10
proud 10
for 10
in 10
our 10
veins 10
flows 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
many 10
brave 10
races 10
who 10
fought 10
as 10
the 10
lion 10
fights 10
for 10
lordship 10
here 10
in 10
the 10
whirlpool 10
of 10
european 10
races 10
the 10
ugric 10
tribe 10
bore 10
down 10
from 10
iceland 10
the 10
fighting 10
spirit 10
which 10
thor 10
and 10
wodin 10
game 10
them 10
which 10
their 10
berserkers 10
displayed 10
to 10
such 10
fell 10
intent 10
on 10
the 10
seaboards 10
of 10
europe 10
aye 10
and 10
of 10
asia 10
and 10
africa 10
too 10
till 10
the 10
peoples 10
thought 10
that 10
the 10
werewolves 10
themselves 10
had 10
come 10
here 10
too 10
when 10
they 10
came 10
they 10
found 10
the 10
huns 10
whose 10
warlike 10
fury 10
had 10
swept 10
the 10
earth 10
like 10
a 10
living 10
flame 10
till 10
the 10
dying 10
peoples 10
held 10
that 10
in 10
their 10
veins 10
ran 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
those 10
old 10
witches 10
who 10
expelled 10
from 10
scythia 10
had 10
mated 10
with 10
the 10
devils 10
in 10
the 10
desert 10
fools 10
fools 10
what 10
devil 10
or 10
what 10
witch 10
was 10
ever 10
so 10
great 10
as 10
attila 10
whose 10
blood 10
is 10
in 10
these 10
veins 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
his 10
arms 10
is 10
it 10
a 10
wonder 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
a 10
conquering 10
race 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
proud 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
magyar 10
the 10
lombard 10
the 10
avar 10
the 10
bulgar 10
or 10
the 10
turk 10
poured 10
his 10
thousands 10
on 10
our 10
frontiers 10
we 10
drove 10
them 10
back 10
is 10
it 10
strange 10
that 10
when 10
arpad 10
and 10
his 10
legions 10
swept 10
through 10
the 10
hungarian 10
fatherland 10
he 10
found 10
us 10
here 10
when 10
he 10
reached 10
the 10
frontier 10
that 10
the 10
honfoglalas 10
was 10
completed 10
there 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
hungarian 10
flood 10
swept 10
eastward 10
the 10
szekelys 10
were 10
claimed 10
as 10
kindred 10
by 10
the 10
victorious 10
magyars 10
and 10
to 10
us 10
for 10
centuries 10
was 10
trusted 10
the 10
guarding 10
of 10
the 10
frontier 10
of 10
turkeyland 10
aye 10
and 10
more 10
than 10
that 10
endless 10
duty 10
of 10
the 10
frontier 10
guard 10
for 10
as 10
the 10
turks 10
say 10
water 10
sleeps 10
and 10
the 10
enemy 10
is 10
sleepless 10
who 10
more 10
gladly 10
than 10
we 10
throughout 10
the 10
four 10
nations 10
received 10
the 10
bloody 10
sword 10
or 10
at 10
its 10
warlike 10
call 10
flocked 10
quicker 10
to 10
the 10
standard 10
of 10
the 10
king 10
when 10
was 10
redeemed 10
that 10
great 10
shame 10
of 10
my 10
nation 10
the 10
shame 10
of 10
cassova 10
when 10
the 10
flags 10
of 10
the 10
wallach 10
and 10
the 10
magyar 10
went 10
down 10
beneath 10
the 10
crescent 10
who 10
was 10
it 10
but 10
one 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
race 10
who 10
as 10
voivode 10
crossed 10
the 10
danube 10
and 10
beat 10
the 10
turk 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
ground 10
this 10
was 10
a 10
dracula 10
indeed 10
woe 10
was 10
it 10
that 10
his 10
own 10
unworthy 10
brother 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
fallen 10
sold 10
his 10
people 10
to 10
the 10
turk 10
and 10
brought 10
the 10
shame 10
of 10
slavery 10
on 10
them 10
was 10
it 10
not 10
this 10
dracula 10
indeed 10
who 10
inspired 10
that 10
other 10
of 10
his 10
race 10
who 10
in 10
a 10
later 10
age 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
brought 10
his 10
forces 10
over 10
the 10
great 10
river 10
into 10
turkeyland 10
who 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
beaten 10
back 10
came 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
though 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
come 10
alone 10
from 10
the 10
bloody 10
field 10
where 10
his 10
troops 10
were 10
being 10
slaughtered 10
since 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
he 10
alone 10
could 10
ultimately 10
triumph 10
they 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
thought 10
only 10
of 10
himself 10
bah 10
what 10
good 10
are 10
peasants 10
without 10
a 10
leader 10
where 10
ends 10
the 10
war 10
without 10
a 10
brain 10
and 10
heart 10
to 10
conduct 10
it 10
again 10
when 10
after 10
the 10
battle 10
of 10
mohacs 10
we 10
threw 10
off 10
the 10
hungarian 10
yoke 10
we 10
of 10
the 10
dracula 10
blood 10
were 10
amongst 10
their 10
leaders 10
for 10
our 10
spirit 10
would 10
not 10
brook 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
not 10
free 10
ah 10
young 10
sir 10
the 10
szekelys 10
and 10
the 10
dracula 10
as 10
their 10
hearts 10
blood 10
their 10
brains 10
and 10
their 10
swords 10
can 10
boast 10
a 10
record 10
that 10
mushroom 10
growths 10
like 10
the 10
hapsburgs 10
and 10
the 10
romanoffs 10
can 10
never 10
reach 10
the 10
warlike 10
days 10
are 10
over 10
blood 10
is 10
too 10
precious 10
a 10
thing 10
in 10
these 10
days 10
of 10
dishonourable 10
peace 10
and 10
the 10
glories 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
races 10
are 10
as 10
a 10
tale 10
that 10
is 10
told 10
it 10
was 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
close 10
on 10
morning 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
mem 10
this 10
diary 10
seems 10
horribly 10
like 10
the 10
beginning 10
of 10
the 10
arabian 10
nights 10
for 10
everything 10
has 10
to 10
break 10
off 10
at 10
cockcrow 10
or 10
like 10
the 10
ghost 10
of 10
hamlets 10
father 10
maylet 10
me 10
begin 10
with 10
facts 10
bare 10
meager 10
facts 10
verified 10
by 10
books 10
and 10
figures 10
and 10
of 10
which 10
there 10
can 10
be 10
no 10
doubt 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
confuse 10
them 10
with 10
experiences 10
which 10
will 10
have 10
to 10
rest 10
on 10
my 10
own 10
observation 10
or 10
my 10
memory 10
of 10
them 10
last 10
evening 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
came 10
from 10
his 10
room 10
he 10
began 10
by 10
asking 10
me 10
questions 10
on 10
legal 10
matters 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
doing 10
of 10
certain 10
kinds 10
of 10
business 10
i 10
had 10
spent 10
the 10
day 10
wearily 10
over 10
books 10
and 10
simply 10
to 10
keep 10
my 10
mind 10
occupied 10
went 10
over 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
matters 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
examined 10
in 10
at 10
lincolns 10
inn 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
certain 10
method 10
in 10
the 10
counts 10
inquiries 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
put 10
them 10
down 10
in 10
sequence 10
the 10
knowledge 10
may 10
somehow 10
or 10
some 10
time 10
be 10
useful 10
to 10
me 10
first 10
he 10
asked 10
if 10
a 10
man 10
in 10
england 10
might 10
have 10
two 10
solicitors 10
or 10
more 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
a 10
dozen 10
if 10
he 10
wished 10
but 10
that 10
it 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
wise 10
to 10
have 10
more 10
than 10
one 10
solicitor 10
engaged 10
in 10
one 10
transaction 10
as 10
only 10
one 10
could 10
act 10
at 10
a 10
time 10
and 10
that 10
to 10
change 10
would 10
be 10
certain 10
to 10
militate 10
against 10
his 10
interest 10
he 10
seemed 10
thoroughly 10
to 10
understand 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
to 10
ask 10
if 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
any 10
practical 10
difficulty 10
in 10
having 10
one 10
man 10
to 10
attend 10
say 10
to 10
banking 10
and 10
another 10
to 10
look 10
after 10
shipping 10
in 10
case 10
local 10
help 10
were 10
needed 10
in 10
a 10
place 10
far 10
from 10
the 10
home 10
of 10
the 10
banking 10
solicitor 10
i 10
asked 10
to 10
explain 10
more 10
fully 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
not 10
by 10
any 10
chance 10
mislead 10
him 10
so 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
shall 10
illustrate 10
your 10
friend 10
and 10
mine 10
mr 10
peter 10
hawkins 10
from 10
under 10
the 10
shadow 10
of 10
your 10
beautiful 10
cathedral 10
at 10
exeter 10
which 10
is 10
far 10
from 10
london 10
buys 10
for 10
me 10
through 10
your 10
good 10
self 10
my 10
place 10
at 10
london 10
good 10
now 10
here 10
let 10
me 10
say 10
frankly 10
lest 10
you 10
should 10
think 10
it 10
strange 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
sought 10
the 10
services 10
of 10
one 10
so 10
far 10
off 10
from 10
london 10
instead 10
of 10
some 10
one 10
resident 10
there 10
that 10
my 10
motive 10
was 10
that 10
no 10
local 10
interest 10
might 10
be 10
served 10
save 10
my 10
wish 10
only 10
and 10
as 10
one 10
of 10
london 10
residence 10
might 10
perhaps 10
have 10
some 10
purpose 10
of 10
himself 10
or 10
friend 10
to 10
serve 10
i 10
went 10
thus 10
afield 10
to 10
seek 10
my 10
agent 10
whose 10
labours 10
should 10
be 10
only 10
to 10
my 10
interest 10
now 10
suppose 10
i 10
who 10
have 10
much 10
of 10
affairs 10
wish 10
to 10
ship 10
goods 10
say 10
to 10
newcastle 10
or 10
durham 10
or 10
harwich 10
or 10
dover 10
might 10
it 10
not 10
be 10
that 10
it 10
could 10
with 10
more 10
ease 10
be 10
done 10
by 10
consigning 10
to 10
one 10
in 10
these 10
ports 10
i 10
answered 10
that 10
certainly 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
most 10
easy 10
but 10
that 10
we 10
solicitors 10
had 10
a 10
system 10
of 10
agency 10
one 10
for 10
the 10
other 10
so 10
that 10
local 10
work 10
could 10
be 10
done 10
locally 10
on 10
instruction 10
from 10
any 10
solicitor 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
client 10
simply 10
placing 10
himself 10
in 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
one 10
man 10
could 10
have 10
his 10
wishes 10
carried 10
out 10
by 10
him 10
without 10
further 10
trouble 10
but 10
said 10
he 10
i 10
could 10
be 10
at 10
liberty 10
to 10
direct 10
myself 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
of 10
course 10
i 10
replied 10
and 10
such 10
is 10
often 10
done 10
by 10
men 10
of 10
business 10
who 10
do 10
not 10
like 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
their 10
affairs 10
to 10
be 10
known 10
by 10
any 10
one 10
person 10
good 10
he 10
saidand 10
then 10
went 10
on 10
to 10
ask 10
about 10
the 10
means 10
of 10
making 10
consignments 10
and 10
the 10
forms 10
to 10
be 10
gone 10
through 10
and 10
of 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
difficulties 10
which 10
might 10
arise 10
but 10
by 10
forethought 10
could 10
be 10
guarded 10
against 10
i 10
explained 10
all 10
these 10
things 10
to 10
him 10
to 10
the 10
best 10
of 10
my 10
ability 10
and 10
he 10
certainly 10
left 10
me 10
under 10
the 10
impression 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
made 10
a 10
wonderful 10
solicitor 10
for 10
there 10
was 10
nothing 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
think 10
of 10
or 10
foresee 10
for 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
was 10
never 10
in 10
the 10
country 10
and 10
who 10
did 10
not 10
evidently 10
do 10
much 10
in 10
the 10
way 10
of 10
business 10
his 10
knowledge 10
and 10
acumen 10
were 10
wonderful 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
satisfied 10
himself 10
on 10
these 10
points 10
of 10
which 10
he 10
had 10
spoken 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
verified 10
all 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
by 10
the 10
books 10
available 10
he 10
suddenly 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
have 10
you 10
written 10
since 10
your 10
first 10
letter 10
to 10
our 10
friend 10
mr 10
peter 10
hawkins 10
or 10
to 10
any 10
other 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
some 10
bitterness 10
in 10
my 10
heart 10
that 10
i 10
answered 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
that 10
as 10
yet 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
seen 10
any 10
opportunity 10
of 10
sending 10
letters 10
to 10
anybody 10
then 10
write 10
now 10
my 10
young 10
friend 10
he 10
said 10
laying 10
a 10
heavy 10
hand 10
on 10
my 10
shoulder 10
write 10
to 10
our 10
friend 10
and 10
to 10
any 10
other 10
and 10
say 10
if 10
it 10
will 10
please 10
you 10
that 10
you 10
shall 10
stay 10
with 10
me 10
until 10
a 10
month 10
from 10
now 10
do 10
you 10
wish 10
me 10
to 10
stay 10
so 10
long 10
i 10
asked 10
for 10
my 10
heart 10
grew 10
cold 10
at 10
the 10
thought 10
i 10
desire 10
it 10
much 10
nay 10
i 10
will 10
take 10
no 10
refusal 10
when 10
your 10
master 10
employer 10
what 10
you 10
will 10
engaged 10
that 10
someone 10
should 10
come 10
on 10
his 10
behalf 10
it 10
was 10
understood 10
that 10
my 10
needs 10
only 10
were 10
to 10
be 10
consulted 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
stinted 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
what 10
could 10
i 10
do 10
but 10
bow 10
acceptance 10
it 10
was 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
interest 10
not 10
mine 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
him 10
not 10
myself 10
and 10
besides 10
while 10
count 10
dracula 10
was 10
speaking 10
there 10
was 10
that 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
in 10
his 10
bearing 10
which 10
made 10
me 10
remember 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
a 10
prisoner 10
and 10
that 10
if 10
i 10
wished 10
it 10
i 10
could 10
have 10
no 10
choice 10
the 10
count 10
saw 10
his 10
victory 10
in 10
my 10
bow 10
and 10
his 10
mastery 10
in 10
the 10
trouble 10
of 10
my 10
face 10
for 10
he 10
began 10
at 10
once 10
to 10
use 10
them 10
but 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
smooth 10
resistless 10
way 10
i 10
pray 10
you 10
my 10
good 10
young 10
friend 10
that 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
discourse 10
of 10
things 10
other 10
than 10
business 10
in 10
your 10
letters 10
it 10
will 10
doubtless 10
please 10
your 10
friends 10
to 10
know 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
well 10
and 10
that 10
you 10
look 10
forward 10
to 10
getting 10
home 10
to 10
them 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
handed 10
me 10
three 10
sheets 10
of 10
note 10
paper 10
and 10
three 10
envelopes 10
they 10
were 10
all 10
of 10
the 10
thinnest 10
foreign 10
post 10
and 10
looking 10
at 10
them 10
then 10
at 10
him 10
and 10
noticing 10
his 10
quiet 10
smile 10
with 10
the 10
sharp 10
canine 10
teeth 10
lying 10
over 10
the 10
red 10
underlip 10
i 10
understood 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
spoken 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
be 10
more 10
careful 10
what 10
i 10
wrote 10
for 10
he 10
would 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
read 10
it 10
so 10
i 10
determined 10
to 10
write 10
only 10
formal 10
notes 10
now 10
but 10
to 10
write 10
fully 10
to 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
in 10
secret 10
and 10
also 10
to 10
mina 10
for 10
to 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
write 10
shorthand 10
which 10
would 10
puzzle 10
the 10
count 10
if 10
he 10
did 10
see 10
it 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
written 10
my 10
two 10
letters 10
i 10
sat 10
quiet 10
reading 10
a 10
book 10
whilst 10
the 10
count 10
wrote 10
several 10
notes 10
referring 10
as 10
he 10
wrote 10
them 10
to 10
some 10
books 10
on 10
his 10
table 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
up 10
my 10
two 10
and 10
placed 10
them 10
with 10
his 10
own 10
and 10
put 10
by 10
his 10
writing 10
materials 10
after 10
which 10
the 10
instant 10
the 10
door 10
had 10
closed 10
behind 10
him 10
i 10
leaned 10
over 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
the 10
letters 10
which 10
were 10
face 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
i 10
felt 10
no 10
compunction 10
in 10
doing 10
so 10
for 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
protect 10
myself 10
in 10
every 10
way 10
i 10
could 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
letters 10
was 10
directed 10
to 10

pesth 10
the 10
second 10
and 10
fourth 10
were 10
unsealed 10
i 10
was 10
just 10
about 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
them 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
door 10
handle 10
move 10
i 10
sank 10
back 10
in 10
my 10
seat 10
having 10
just 10
had 10
time 10
to 10
resume 10
my 10
book 10
before 10
the 10
count 10
holding 10
still 10
another 10
letter 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
entered 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
took 10
up 10
the 10
letters 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
and 10
stamped 10
them 10
carefully 10
and 10
then 10
turning 10
to 10
me 10
said 10
i 10
trust 10
you 10
will 10
forgive 10
me 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
much 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
private 10
this 10
evening 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
hope 10
find 10
all 10
things 10
as 10
you 10
wish 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
he 10
turned 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
moments 10
pause 10
said 10
let 10
me 10
advise 10
you 10
my 10
dear 10
young 10
friend 10
nay 10
let 10
me 10
warn 10
you 10
with 10
all 10
seriousness 10
that 10
should 10
you 10
leave 10
these 10
rooms 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
by 10
any 10
chance 10
go 10
to 10
sleep 10
in 10
any 10
other 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
castle 10
it 10
is 10
old 10
and 10
has 10
many 10
memories 10
and 10
there 10
are 10
bad 10
dreams 10
for 10
those 10
who 10
sleep 10
unwisely 10
be 10
warned 10
should 10
sleep 10
now 10
or 10
ever 10
overcome 10
you 10
or 10
be 10
like 10
to 10
do 10
then 10
haste 10
to 10
your 10
own 10
chamber 10
or 10
to 10
these 10
rooms 10
for 10
your 10
rest 10
will 10
then 10
be 10
safe 10
but 10
if 10
you 10
be 10
not 10
careful 10
in 10
this 10
respect 10
then 10
he 10
finished 10
his 10
speech 10
in 10
a 10
gruesome 10
way 10
for 10
he 10
motioned 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
washing 10
them 10
i 10
quite 10
understood 10
my 10
only 10
doubt 10
was 10
as 10
to 10
whether 10
any 10
dream 10
could 10
be 10
more 10
terrible 10
than 10
the 10
unnatural 10
horrible 10
net 10
of 10
gloom 10
and 10
mystery 10
which 10
seemed 10
closing 10
around 10
me 10
lateri 10
endorse 10
the 10
last 10
words 10
written 10
but 10
this 10
time 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
doubt 10
in 10
question 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
fear 10
to 10
sleep 10
in 10
any 10
place 10
where 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
i 10
have 10
placed 10
the 10
crucifix 10
over 10
the 10
head 10
of 10
my 10
bed 10
i 10
imagine 10
that 10
my 10
rest 10
is 10
thus 10
freer 10
from 10
dreams 10
and 10
there 10
it 10
shall 10
remain 10
when 10
he 10
left 10
me 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
my 10
room 10
after 10
a 10
little 10
while 10
not 10
hearing 10
any 10
sound 10
i 10
came 10
out 10
and 10
went 10
up 10
the 10
stone 10
stair 10
to 10
where 10
i 10
could 10
look 10
out 10
towards 10
the 10
south 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
sense 10
of 10
freedom 10
in 10
the 10
vast 10
expanse 10
inaccessible 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
meas 10
compared 10
with 10
the 10
narrow 10
darkness 10
of 10
the 10
courtyard 10
looking 10
out 10
on 10
this 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
indeed 10
in 10
prison 10
and 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
want 10
a 10
breath 10
of 10
fresh 10
air 10
though 10
it 10
were 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
i 10
am 10
beginning 10
to 10
feel 10
this 10
nocturnal 10
existence 10
tell 10
on 10
me 10
it 10
is 10
destroying 10
my 10
nerve 10
i 10
start 10
at 10
my 10
own 10
shadow 10
and 10
am 10
full 10
of 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
horrible 10
imaginings 10
god 10
knows 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
ground 10
for 10
my 10
terrible 10
fear 10
in 10
this 10
accursed 10
place 10
i 10
looked 10
out 10
over 10
the 10
beautiful 10
expanse 10
bathed 10
in 10
soft 10
yellow 10
moonlight 10
till 10
it 10
was 10
almost 10
as 10
light 10
as 10
day 10
in 10
the 10
soft 10
light 10
the 10
distant 10
hills 10
became 10
melted 10
and 10
the 10
shadows 10
in 10
the 10
valleys 10
and 10
gorges 10
of 10
velvety 10
blackness 10
the 10
mere 10
beauty 10
seemed 10
to 10
cheer 10
me 10
there 10
was 10
peace 10
and 10
comfort 10
in 10
every 10
breath 10
i 10
drew 10
as 10
i 10
leaned 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
my 10
eye 10
was 10
caught 10
by 10
something 10
moving 10
a 10
storey 10
below 10
me 10
and 10
somewhat 10
to 10
my 10
left 10
where 10
i 10
imagined 10
from 10
the 10
order 10
of 10
the 10
rooms 10
that 10
the 10
windows 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
own 10
room 10
would 10
look 10
out 10
the 10
window 10
at 10
which 10
i 10
stood 10
was 10
tall 10
and 10
deep 10
stonemullioned 10
and 10
though 10
weatherworn 10
was 10
still 10
complete 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
evidently 10
many 10
a 10
day 10
since 10
the 10
case 10
had 10
been 10
there 10
i 10
drew 10
back 10
behind 10
the 10
stonework 10
and 10
looked 10
carefully 10
out 10
what 10
i 10
saw 10
was 10
the 10
counts 10
head 10
coming 10
out 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
face 10
but 10
i 10
knew 10
the 10
man 10
by 10
the 10
neck 10
and 10
the 10
movement 10
of 10
his 10
back 10
and 10
arms 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
mistake 10
the 10
hands 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
had 10
some 10
many 10
opportunities 10
of 10
studying 10
i 10
was 10
at 10
first 10
interested 10
and 10
somewhat 10
amused 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
wonderful 10
how 10
small 10
a 10
matter 10
will 10
interest 10
and 10
amuse 10
a 10
man 10
when 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
prisoner 10
but 10
my 10
very 10
feelings 10
changed 10
to 10
repulsion 10
and 10
terror 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
whole 10
man 10
slowly 10
emerge 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
begin 10
to 10
crawl 10
down 10
the 10
castle 10
wall 10
over 10
the 10
dreadful 10
abyss 10
face 10
down 10
with 10
his 10
cloak 10
spreading 10
out 10
around 10
him 10
like 10
great 10
wings 10
at 10
first 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
believe 10
my 10
eyes 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
was 10
some 10
trick 10
of 10
the 10
moonlight 10
some 10
weird 10
effect 10
of 10
shadow 10
but 10
i 10
kept 10
looking 10
and 10
it 10
could 10
be 10
no 10
delusion 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
fingers 10
and 10
toes 10
grasp 10
the 10
corners 10
of 10
the 10
stones 10
worn 10
clear 10
of 10
the 10
mortar 10
by 10
the 10
stress 10
of 10
years 10
and 10
by 10
thus 10
using 10
every 10
projection 10
and 10
inequality 10
move 10
downwards 10
with 10
considerable 10
speed 10
just 10
as 10
a 10
lizard 10
moves 10
along 10
a 10
wall 10
what 10
manner 10
of 10
man 10
is 10
this 10
or 10
what 10
manner 10
of 10
creature 10
is 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
semblance 10
of 10
man 10
i 10
feel 10
the 10
dread 10
of 10
this 10
horrible 10
place 10
overpowering 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
fear 10
in 10
awful 10
fear 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
escape 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
encompassed 10
about 10
with 10
terrors 10
that 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
think 10
of 10
mayonce 10
more 10
i 10
have 10
seen 10
the 10
count 10
go 10
out 10
in 10
his 10
lizard 10
fashion 10
he 10
moved 10
downwards 10
in 10
a 10
sidelong 10
way 10
some 10
hundred 10
feet 10
down 10
and 10
a 10
good 10
deal 10
to 10
the 10
left 10
he 10
vanished 10
into 10
some 10
hole 10
or 10
window 10
when 10
his 10
head 10
had 10
disappeared 10
i 10
leaned 10
out 10
to 10
try 10
and 10
see 10
more 10
but 10
without 10
avail 10
the 10
distance 10
was 10
too 10
great 10
to 10
allow 10
a 10
proper 10
angle 10
of 10
sight 10
i 10
knew 10
he 10
had 10
left 10
the 10
castle 10
now 10
and 10
thought 10
to 10
use 10
the 10
opportunity 10
to 10
explore 10
more 10
than 10
i 10
had 10
dared 10
to 10
do 10
as 10
yet 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
taking 10
a 10
lamp 10
tried 10
all 10
the 10
doors 10
they 10
were 10
all 10
locked 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
expected 10
and 10
the 10
locks 10
were 10
comparatively 10
new 10
but 10
i 10
went 10
down 10
the 10
stone 10
stairs 10
to 10
the 10
hall 10
where 10
i 10
had 10
entered 10
originally 10
i 10
found 10
i 10
could 10
pull 10
back 10
the 10
bolts 10
easily 10
enough 10
and 10
unhook 10
the 10
great 10
chains 10
but 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
locked 10
and 10
the 10
key 10
was 10
gone 10
that 10
key 10
must 10
be 10
in 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
i 10
must 10
watch 10
should 10
his 10
door 10
be 10
unlocked 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
get 10
it 10
and 10
escape 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
thorough 10
examination 10
of 10
the 10
various 10
stairs 10
and 10
passages 10
and 10
to 10
try 10
the 10
doors 10
that 10
opened 10
from 10
them 10
one 10
or 10
two 10
small 10
rooms 10
near 10
the 10
hall 10
were 10
open 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
nothing 10
to 10
see 10
in 10
them 10
except 10
old 10
furniture 10
dusty 10
with 10
age 10
and 10
motheaten 10
at 10
last 10
however 10
i 10
found 10
one 10
door 10
at 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
stairway 10
which 10
though 10
it 10
seemed 10
locked 10
gave 10
a 10
little 10
under 10
pressure 10
i 10
tried 10
it 10
harder 10
and 10
found 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
really 10
locked 10
but 10
that 10
the 10
resistance 10
came 10
from 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
the 10
hinges 10
had 10
fallen 10
somewhatand 10
the 10
heavy 10
door 10
rested 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
here 10
was 10
an 10
opportunity 10
which 10
i 10
might 10
not 10
have 10
again 10
so 10
i 10
exerted 10
myselfand 10
with 10
many 10
efforts 10
forced 10
it 10
back 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
enter 10
i 10
was 10
now 10
in 10
a 10
wing 10
of 10
the 10
castle 10
further 10
to 10
the 10
right 10
than 10
the 10
rooms 10
i 10
knew 10
and 10
a 10
storey 10
lower 10
down 10
from 10
the 10
windows 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
suite 10
of 10
rooms 10
lay 10
along 10
to 10
the 10
south 10
of 10
the 10
castle 10
the 10
windows 10
of 10
the 10
end 10
room 10
looking 10
out 10
both 10
west 10
and 10
south 10
on 10
the 10
latter 10
side 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
former 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
great 10
precipice 10
the 10
castle 10
was 10
built 10
on 10
the 10
corner 10
of 10
a 10
great 10
rock 10
so 10
that 10
on 10
three 10
sides 10
it 10
was 10
quite 10
impregnable 10
and 10
great 10
windows 10
were 10
placed 10
here 10
where 10
sling 10
or 10
bow 10
or 10
culverin 10
could 10
not 10
reach 10
and 10
consequently 10
light 10
and 10
comfort 10
impossible 10
to 10
a 10
position 10
which 10
had 10
to 10
be 10
guarded 10
were 10
secured 10
to 10
the 10
west 10
was 10
a 10
great 10
valley 10
and 10
then 10
rising 10
far 10
away 10
great 10
jagged 10
mountain 10
fastnesses 10
rising 10
peak 10
on 10
peak 10
the 10
sheer 10
rock 10
studded 10
with 10
mountain 10
ash 10
and 10
thorn 10
whose 10
roots 10
clung 10
in 10
cracks 10
and 10
crevices 10
and 10
crannies 10
of 10
the 10
stone 10
this 10
was 10
evidently 10
the 10
portion 10
of 10
the 10
castle 10
occupied 10
by 10
the 10
ladies 10
in 10
bygone 10
days 10
for 10
the 10
furniture 10
had 10
more 10
an 10
air 10
of 10
comfort 10
than 10
any 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
the 10
windows 10
were 10
curtainless 10
and 10
the 10
yellow 10
moonlight 10
flooding 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
diamond 10
panes 10
enabled 10
one 10
to 10
see 10
even 10
colours 10
whilst 10
it 10
softened 10
the 10
wealth 10
of 10
dust 10
which 10
lay 10
over 10
all 10
and 10
disguised 10
in 10
some 10
measure 10
the 10
ravages 10
of 10
time 10
and 10
moth 10
my 10
lamp 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
of 10
little 10
effect 10
in 10
the 10
brilliant 10
moonlight 10
but 10
i 10
was 10
glad 10
to 10
have 10
it 10
with 10
me 10
for 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
dread 10
loneliness 10
in 10
the 10
place 10
which 10
chilled 10
my 10
heart 10
and 10
made 10
my 10
nerves 10
tremble 10
still 10
it 10
was 10
better 10
than 10
living 10
alone 10
in 10
the 10
rooms 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
hate 10
from 10
the 10
presence 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
and 10
after 10
trying 10
a 10
little 10
to 10
school 10
my 10
nerves 10
i 10
found 10
a 10
soft 10
quietude 10
come 10
over 10
me 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
sitting 10
at 10
a 10
little 10
oak 10
table 10
where 10
in 10
old 10
times 10
possibly 10
some 10
fair 10
lady 10
sat 10
to 10
pen 10
with 10
much 10
thought 10
and 10
many 10
blushes 10
her 10
illspelt 10
love 10
letter 10
and 10
writing 10
in 10
my 10
diary 10
in 10
shorthand 10
all 10
that 10
has 10
happened 10
since 10
i 10
closed 10
it 10
last 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
nineteenth 10
century 10
uptodate 10
with 10
a 10
vengeance 10
and 10
yet 10
unless 10
my 10
senses 10
deceive 10
me 10
the 10
old 10
centuries 10
had 10
and 10
have 10
powers 10
of 10
their 10
own 10
which 10
mere 10
modernity 10
cannot 10
kill 10
later 10
the 10
morning 10
of 10
maygod 10
preserve 10
my 10
sanity 10
for 10
to 10
this 10
i 10
am 10
reduced 10
safety 10
and 10
the 10
assurance 10
of 10
safety 10
are 10
things 10
of 10
the 10
past 10
whilst 10
i 10
live 10
on 10
here 10
there 10
is 10
but 10
one 10
thing 10
to 10
hope 10
for 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
go 10
mad 10
if 10
indeed 10
i 10
be 10
not 10
mad 10
already 10
if 10
i 10
be 10
sane 10
then 10
surely 10
it 10
is 10
maddening 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
of 10
all 10
the 10
foul 10
things 10
that 10
lurk 10
in 10
this 10
hateful 10
place 10
the 10
count 10
is 10
the 10
least 10
dreadful 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
to 10
him 10
alone 10
i 10
can 10
look 10
for 10
safety 10
even 10
though 10
this 10
be 10
only 10
whilst 10
i 10
can 10
serve 10
his 10
purpose 10
great 10
god 10
merciful 10
god 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
calm 10
for 10
out 10
of 10
that 10
way 10
lies 10
madness 10
indeed 10
i 10
begin 10
to 10
get 10
new 10
lights 10
on 10
certain 10
things 10
which 10
have 10
puzzled 10
me 10
up 10
to 10
now 10
i 10
never 10
quite 10
knew 10
what 10
shakespeare 10
meant 10
when 10
he 10
made 10
hamlet 10
say 10
my 10
tablets 10
quick 10
my 10
tablets 10
tis 10
meet 10
that 10
i 10
put 10
it 10
down 10
etc 10
for 10
now 10
feeling 10
as 10
though 10
my 10
own 10
brain 10
were 10
unhinged 10
or 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
shock 10
had 10
come 10
which 10
must 10
end 10
in 10
its 10
undoing 10
i 10
turn 10
to 10
my 10
diary 10
for 10
repose 10
the 10
habit 10
of 10
entering 10
accurately 10
must 10
help 10
to 10
soothe 10
me 10
the 10
counts 10
mysterious 10
warning 10
frightened 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
it 10
frightens 10
me 10
more 10
not 10
when 10
i 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
for 10
in 10
the 10
future 10
he 10
has 10
a 10
fearful 10
hold 10
upon 10
me 10
i 10
shall 10
fear 10
to 10
doubt 10
what 10
he 10
may 10
say 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
written 10
in 10
my 10
diary 10
and 10
had 10
fortunately 10
replaced 10
the 10
book 10
and 10
pen 10
in 10
my 10
pocket 10
i 10
felt 10
sleepy 10
the 10
counts 10
warning 10
came 10
into 10
my 10
mind 10
but 10
i 10
took 10
pleasure 10
in 10
disobeying 10
it 10
the 10
sense 10
of 10
sleep 10
was 10
upon 10
me 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
the 10
obstinacy 10
which 10
sleep 10
brings 10
as 10
outrider 10
the 10
soft 10
moonlight 10
soothed 10
and 10
the 10
wide 10
expanse 10
without 10
gave 10
a 10
sense 10
of 10
freedom 10
which 10
refreshed 10
me 10
i 10
determined 10
not 10
to 10
return 10
tonight 10
to 10
the 10
gloomhaunted 10
rooms 10
but 10
to 10
sleep 10
here 10
where 10
of 10
old 10
ladies 10
had 10
sat 10
and 10
sung 10
and 10
lived 10
sweet 10
lives 10
whilst 10
their 10
gentle 10
breasts 10
were 10
sad 10
for 10
their 10
menfolk 10
away 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
remorseless 10
wars 10
i 10
drew 10
a 10
great 10
couch 10
out 10
of 10
its 10
place 10
near 10
the 10
corner 10
so 10
that 10
as 10
i 10
lay 10
i 10
could 10
look 10
at 10
the 10
lovely 10
view 10
to 10
east 10
and 10
southand 10
unthinking 10
of 10
and 10
uncaring 10
for 10
the 10
dust 10
composed 10
myself 10
for 10
sleep 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
fallen 10
asleep 10
i 10
hope 10
so 10
but 10
i 10
fear 10
for 10
all 10
that 10
followed 10
was 10
startlingly 10
real 10
so 10
real 10
that 10
now 10
sitting 10
here 10
in 10
the 10
broad 10
full 10
sunlight 10
of 10
the 10
morning 10
i 10
cannot 10
in 10
the 10
least 10
believe 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
sleep 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
alone 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
the 10
same 10
unchanged 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
since 10
i 10
came 10
into 10
it 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
along 10
the 10
floor 10
in 10
the 10
brilliant 10
moonlight 10
my 10
own 10
footsteps 10
marked 10
where 10
i 10
had 10
disturbed 10
the 10
long 10
accumulation 10
of 10
dust 10
in 10
the 10
moonlight 10
opposite 10
me 10
were 10
three 10
young 10
women 10
ladies 10
by 10
their 10
dress 10
and 10
manner 10
i 10
thought 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
dreaming 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
them 10
they 10
threw 10
no 10
shadow 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
they 10
came 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
and 10
then 10
whispered 10
together 10
two 10
were 10
dark 10
and 10
had 10
high 10
aquiline 10
noses 10
like 10
the 10
count 10
and 10
great 10
dark 10
piercing 10
eyes 10
that 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
almost 10
red 10
when 10
contrasted 10
with 10
the 10
pale 10
yellow 10
moon 10
the 10
other 10
was 10
fairas 10
fair 10
as 10
can 10
be 10
with 10
great 10
masses 10
of 10
golden 10
hair 10
and 10
eyes 10
like 10
pale 10
sapphires 10
i 10
seemed 10
somehow 10
to 10
know 10
her 10
face 10
and 10
to 10
know 10
it 10
in 10
connection 10
with 10
some 10
dreamy 10
fear 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
recollect 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
how 10
or 10
where 10
all 10
three 10
had 10
brilliant 10
white 10
teeth 10
that 10
shone 10
like 10
pearls 10
against 10
the 10
ruby 10
of 10
their 10
voluptuous 10
lips 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
about 10
them 10
that 10
made 10
me 10
uneasy 10
some 10
longing 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
some 10
deadly 10
fear 10
i 10
felt 10
in 10
my 10
heart 10
a 10
wicked 10
burning 10
desire 10
that 10
they 10
would 10
kiss 10
me 10
with 10
those 10
red 10
lips 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
good 10
to 10
note 10
this 10
down 10
lest 10
some 10
day 10
it 10
should 10
meet 10
minas 10
eyes 10
and 10
cause 10
her 10
pain 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
truth 10
they 10
whispered 10
together 10
and 10
then 10
they 10
all 10
three 10
laughed 10
such 10
a 10
silvery 10
musical 10
laugh 10
but 10
as 10
hard 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
sound 10
never 10
could 10
have 10
come 10
through 10
the 10
softness 10
of 10
human 10
lips 10
it 10
was 10
like 10
the 10
intolerable 10
tingling 10
sweetness 10
of 10
waterglasses 10
when 10
played 10
on 10
by 10
a 10
cunning 10
hand 10
the 10
fair 10
girl 10
shook 10
her 10
head 10
coquettishly 10
and 10
the 10
other 10
two 10
urged 10
her 10
on 10
one 10
said 10
go 10
on 10
you 10
are 10
first 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
follow 10
yours 10
is 10
the 10
right 10
to 10
begin 10
the 10
other 10
added 10
he 10
is 10
young 10
and 10
strong 10
there 10
are 10
kisses 10
for 10
us 10
all 10
i 10
lay 10
quiet 10
looking 10
out 10
from 10
under 10
my 10
eyelashes 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
of 10
delightful 10
anticipation 10
the 10
fair 10
girl 10
advanced 10
and 10
bent 10
over 10
me 10
till 10
i 10
could 10
feel 10
the 10
movement 10
of 10
her 10
breath 10
upon 10
me 10
sweet 10
it 10
was 10
in 10
one 10
sense 10
honeysweet 10
and 10
sent 10
the 10
same 10
tingling 10
through 10
the 10
nerves 10
as 10
her 10
voice 10
but 10
with 10
a 10
bitter 10
underlying 10
the 10
sweet 10
a 10
bitter 10
offensiveness 10
as 10
one 10
smells 10
in 10
blood 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
to 10
raise 10
my 10
eyelids 10
but 10
looked 10
out 10
and 10
saw 10
perfectly 10
under 10
the 10
lashes 10
the 10
girl 10
went 10
on 10
her 10
knees 10
and 10
bent 10
over 10
me 10
simply 10
gloating 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
deliberate 10
voluptuousness 10
which 10
was 10
both 10
thrilling 10
and 10
repulsive 10
and 10
as 10
she 10
arched 10
her 10
neck 10
she 10
actually 10
licked 10
her 10
lips 10
like 10
an 10
animal 10
till 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
in 10
the 10
moonlight 10
the 10
moisture 10
shining 10
on 10
the 10
scarlet 10
lips 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
red 10
tongue 10
as 10
it 10
lapped 10
the 10
white 10
sharp 10
teeth 10
lower 10
and 10
lower 10
went 10
her 10
head 10
as 10
the 10
lips 10
went 10
below 10
the 10
range 10
of 10
my 10
mouth 10
and 10
chin 10
and 10
seemed 10
to 10
fasten 10
on 10
my 10
throat 10
then 10
she 10
paused 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
churning 10
sound 10
of 10
her 10
tongue 10
as 10
it 10
licked 10
her 10
teeth 10
and 10
lips 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
feel 10
the 10
hot 10
breath 10
on 10
my 10
neck 10
then 10
the 10
skin 10
of 10
my 10
throat 10
began 10
to 10
tingle 10
as 10
ones 10
flesh 10
does 10
when 10
the 10
hand 10
that 10
is 10
to 10
tickle 10
it 10
approaches 10
nearer 10
nearer 10
i 10
could 10
feel 10
the 10
soft 10
shivering 10
touch 10
of 10
the 10
lips 10
on 10
the 10
super 10
sensitive 10
skin 10
of 10
my 10
throat 10
and 10
the 10
hard 10
dents 10
of 10
two 10
sharp 10
teeth 10
just 10
touching 10
and 10
pausing 10
there 10
i 10
closed 10
my 10
eyes 10
in 10
languorous 10
ecstasy 10
and 10
waited 10
waited 10
with 10
beating 10
heart 10
but 10
at 10
that 10
instant 10
another 10
sensation 10
swept 10
through 10
me 10
as 10
quick 10
as 10
lightning 10
i 10
was 10
conscious 10
of 10
the 10
presence 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
and 10
of 10
his 10
being 10
as 10
if 10
lapped 10
in 10
a 10
storm 10
of 10
fury 10
as 10
my 10
eyes 10
opened 10
involuntarily 10
i 10
saw 10
his 10
strong 10
hand 10
grasp 10
the 10
slender 10
neck 10
of 10
the 10
fair 10
woman 10
and 10
with 10
giants 10
power 10
draw 10
it 10
back 10
the 10
blue 10
eyes 10
transformed 10
with 10
fury 10
the 10
white 10
teeth 10
champing 10
with 10
rage 10
and 10
the 10
fair 10
cheeks 10
blazing 10
red 10
with 10
passion 10
but 10
the 10
count 10
never 10
did 10
i 10
imagine 10
such 10
wrath 10
and 10
fury 10
even 10
to 10
the 10
demons 10
of 10
the 10
pit 10
his 10
eyes 10
were 10
positively 10
blazing 10
the 10
red 10
light 10
in 10
them 10
was 10
lurid 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
flames 10
of 10
hell 10
fire 10
blazed 10
behind 10
them 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
deathly 10
pale 10
and 10
the 10
lines 10
of 10
it 10
were 10
hard 10
like 10
drawn 10
wires 10
the 10
thick 10
eyebrows 10
that 10
met 10
over 10
the 10
nose 10
now 10
seemed 10
like 10
a 10
heaving 10
bar 10
of 10
whitehot 10
metal 10
with 10
a 10
fierce 10
sweep 10
of 10
his 10
arm 10
he 10
hurled 10
the 10
woman 10
from 10
him 10
and 10
then 10
motioned 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
were 10
beating 10
them 10
back 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
same 10
imperious 10
gesture 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
used 10
to 10
the 10
wolves 10
in 10
a 10
voice 10
which 10
though 10
low 10
and 10
almost 10
in 10
a 10
whisper 10
seemed 10
to 10
cut 10
through 10
the 10
air 10
and 10
then 10
ring 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
said 10
how 10
dare 10
you 10
touch 10
him 10
any 10
of 10
you 10
how 10
dare 10
you 10
cast 10
eyes 10
on 10
him 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
forbidden 10
it 10
back 10
i 10
tell 10
you 10
all 10
this 10
man 10
belongs 10
to 10
me 10
beware 10
how 10
you 10
meddle 10
with 10
him 10
or 10
youll 10
have 10
to 10
deal 10
with 10
me 10
the 10
fair 10
girl 10
with 10
a 10
laugh 10
of 10
ribald 10
coquetry 10
turned 10
to 10
answer 10
him 10
you 10
yourself 10
never 10
loved 10
you 10
never 10
love 10
on 10
this 10
the 10
other 10
women 10
joinedand 10
such 10
a 10
mirthless 10
hard 10
soulless 10
laughter 10
rang 10
through 10
the 10
room 10
that 10
it 10
almost 10
made 10
me 10
faint 10
to 10
hear 10
it 10
seemed 10
like 10
the 10
pleasure 10
of 10
fiends 10
then 10
the 10
count 10
turned 10
after 10
looking 10
at 10
my 10
face 10
attentively 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
soft 10
whisper 10
yes 10
i 10
too 10
can 10
love 10
you 10
yourselves 10
can 10
tell 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
past 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
well 10
now 10
i 10
promise 10
you 10
that 10
when 10
i 10
am 10
done 10
with 10
him 10
you 10
shall 10
kiss 10
him 10
at 10
your 10
will 10
now 10
go 10
go 10
i 10
must 10
awaken 10
him 10
for 10
there 10
is 10
work 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
have 10
nothing 10
tonight 10
said 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
with 10
a 10
low 10
laugh 10
as 10
she 10
pointed 10
to 10
the 10
bag 10
which 10
he 10
had 10
thrown 10
upon 10
the 10
floor 10
and 10
which 10
moved 10
as 10
though 10
there 10
were 10
some 10
living 10
thing 10
within 10
it 10
for 10
answer 10
he 10
nodded 10
his 10
head 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
women 10
jumped 10
forward 10
and 10
opened 10
it 10
if 10
my 10
ears 10
did 10
not 10
deceive 10
me 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
gasp 10
and 10
a 10
low 10
wail 10
as 10
of 10
a 10
half 10
smothered 10
child 10
the 10
women 10
closed 10
round 10
whilst 10
i 10
was 10
aghast 10
with 10
horror 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
they 10
disappeared 10
and 10
with 10
them 10
the 10
dreadful 10
bag 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
door 10
near 10
them 10
and 10
they 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
passed 10
me 10
without 10
my 10
noticing 10
they 10
simply 10
seemed 10
to 10
fade 10
into 10
the 10
rays 10
of 10
the 10
moonlight 10
and 10
pass 10
out 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
outside 10
the 10
dim 10
shadowy 10
forms 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
before 10
they 10
entirely 10
faded 10
away 10
then 10
the 10
horror 10
overcame 10
meand 10
i 10
sank 10
down 10
unconscious 10
chapter 10
jonathan 10
harkers 10
journal 10
continued 10
i 10
awoke 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
bed 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
dreamt 10
the 10
count 10
must 10
have 10
carried 10
me 10
here 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
satisfy 10
myself 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
but 10
could 10
not 10
arrive 10
at 10
any 10
unquestionable 10
result 10
to 10
be 10
sure 10
there 10
were 10
certain 10
small 10
evidences 10
such 10
as 10
that 10
my 10
clothes 10
were 10
folded 10
and 10
laid 10
by 10
in 10
a 10
manner 10
which 10
was 10
not 10
my 10
habit 10
my 10
watch 10
was 10
still 10
unwound 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
rigorously 10
accustomed 10
to 10
wind 10
it 10
the 10
last 10
thing 10
before 10
going 10
to 10
bed 10
and 10
many 10
such 10
details 10
but 10
these 10
things 10
are 10
no 10
proof 10
for 10
they 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
evidences 10
that 10
my 10
mind 10
was 10
not 10
as 10
usual 10
and 10
for 10
some 10
cause 10
or 10
another 10
i 10
had 10
certainly 10
been 10
much 10
upset 10
i 10
must 10
watch 10
for 10
proof 10
of 10
one 10
thing 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
if 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
carried 10
me 10
here 10
and 10
undressed 10
me 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
hurried 10
in 10
his 10
task 10
for 10
my 10
pockets 10
are 10
intact 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
this 10
diary 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
a 10
mystery 10
to 10
him 10
which 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
have 10
brooked 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
taken 10
or 10
destroyed 10
it 10
as 10
i 10
look 10
round 10
this 10
room 10
although 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
fear 10
it 10
is 10
now 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
sanctuary 10
for 10
nothing 10
can 10
be 10
more 10
dreadful 10
than 10
those 10
awful 10
women 10
who 10
were 10
who 10
are 10
waiting 10
to 10
suck 10
my 10
blood 10
mayi 10
have 10
been 10
down 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
that 10
room 10
again 10
in 10
daylight 10
for 10
i 10
must 10
know 10
the 10
truth 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
to 10
the 10
doorway 10
at 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
stairs 10
i 10
found 10
it 10
closed 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
so 10
forcibly 10
driven 10
against 10
the 10
jamb 10
that 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
woodwork 10
was 10
splintered 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
bolt 10
of 10
the 10
lock 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
shot 10
but 10
the 10
door 10
is 10
fastened 10
from 10
the 10
inside 10
i 10
fear 10
it 10
was 10
no 10
dream 10
and 10
must 10
act 10
on 10
this 10
surmise 10
mayi 10
am 10
surely 10
in 10
the 10
toils 10
last 10
night 10
the 10
count 10
asked 10
me 10
in 10
the 10
sauvest 10
tones 10
to 10
write 10
three 10
letters 10
one 10
saying 10
that 10
my 10
work 10
here 10
was 10
nearly 10
done 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
start 10
for 10
home 10
within 10
a 10
few 10
daysanother 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
starting 10
on 10
the 10
next 10
morning 10
from 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
the 10
letter 10
and 10
the 10
third 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
left 10
the 10
castle 10
and 10
arrived 10
at 10
bistritz 10
i 10
would 10
fain 10
have 10
rebelled 10
but 10
felt 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
present 10
state 10
of 10
things 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
madness 10
to 10
quarrel 10
openly 10
with 10
the 10
count 10
whilst 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
absolutely 10
in 10
his 10
power 10
and 10
to 10
refuse 10
would 10
be 10
to 10
excite 10
his 10
suspicion 10
and 10
to 10
arouse 10
his 10
anger 10
he 10
knows 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
too 10
much 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
live 10
lest 10
i 10
be 10
dangerous 10
to 10
him 10
my 10
only 10
chance 10
is 10
to 10
prolong 10
my 10
opportunities 10
something 10
may 10
occur 10
which 10
will 10
give 10
ma 10
a 10
chance 10
to 10
escape 10
i 10
saw 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
something 10
of 10
that 10
gathering 10
wrath 10
which 10
was 10
manifest 10
when 10
he 10
hurled 10
that 10
fair 10
woman 10
from 10
him 10
he 10
explained 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
posts 10
were 10
few 10
and 10
uncertain 10
and 10
that 10
my 10
writing 10
now 10
would 10
ensure 10
ease 10
of 10
mind 10
to 10
my 10
friends 10
and 10
he 10
assured 10
me 10
with 10
so 10
much 10
impressiveness 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
countermand 10
the 10
later 10
letters 10
which 10
would 10
be 10
held 10
over 10
at 10
bistritz 10
until 10
due 10
time 10
in 10
case 10
chance 10
would 10
admit 10
of 10
my 10
prolonging 10
my 10
stay 10
that 10
to 10
oppose 10
him 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
to 10
create 10
new 10
suspicion 10
i 10
therefore 10
pretended 10
to 10
fall 10
in 10
with 10
his 10
views 10
and 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
dates 10
i 10
should 10
put 10
on 10
the 10
letters 10
he 10
calculated 10
a 10
minute 10
and 10
then 10
said 10
the 10

voice 10

otherhere 10
he 10
caught 10
sight 10
of 10
the 10
strange 10
symbols 10
as 10
he 10
opened 10
the 10
envelope 10
and 10
the 10
dark 10
look 10
came 10
into 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
blazed 10
wickedlythe 10
other 10

he 10
calmly 10
held 10
letter 10
and 10
envelope 10
in 10
the 10
flame 10
of 10
the 10
lamp 10
till 10
they 10
were 10
consumed 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
the 10
letter 10
to 10
hawkins 10
that 10
i 10
shall 10
of 10

pardon 10
my 10
friend 10
that 10
unknowingly 10
i 10
did 10
break 10
the 10
seal 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
cover 10
it 10
again 10
he 10
held 10
out 10
the 10
letter 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
courteous 10
bow 10
handed 10
me 10
a 10
clean 10
envelope 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
redirect 10
it 10
and 10
hand 10
it 10
to 10
him 10
in 10
silence 10
when 10
he 10
went 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
key 10
turn 10
softly 10
a 10
minute 10
later 10
i 10
went 10
over 10
and 10
tried 10
it 10
and 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
locked 10
when 10
an 10
hour 10
or 10
two 10
after 10
the 10
count 10
came 10
quietly 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
his 10
coming 10
awakened 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
had 10
gone 10
to 10
sleep 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
courteous 10
and 10
very 10
cheery 10
in 10
his 10
manner 10
and 10
seeing 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
sleeping 10
he 10
said 10
so 10

to 10

i 10
may 10
not 10
have 10
the 10
pleasure 10
of 10
talk 10
tonight 10
since 10
there 10

many 10
labours 10
to 10
me 10
but 10
you 10
will 10

i 10
pray 10
i 10
passed 10
to 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
and 10
strange 10
to 10
say 10
slept 10
without 10
dreaming 10
despair 10
has 10
its 10
own 10
calms 10
maythis 10
morning 10
when 10
i 10
woke 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
provide 10
myself 10
with 10
some 10
papers 10
and 10
envelopes 10
from 10
my 10
bag 10
and 10
keep 10
them 10
in 10
my 10
pocket 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
write 10
in 10
case 10
i 10
should 10
get 10
an 10
opportunity 10
but 10
again 10
a 10
surprise 10
again 10
a 10
shock 10
every 10
scrap 10
of 10
paper 10
was 10
gone 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
all 10
my 10
notes 10
my 10
memoranda 10
relating 10
to 10
railways 10
and 10
travel 10
my 10
letter 10
of 10
credit 10
in 10
fact 10
all 10
that 10
might 10
be 10
useful 10
to 10
me 10
were 10
i 10
once 10
outside 10
the 10
castle 10
i 10
sat 10
and 10
pondered 10
awhile 10
and 10
then 10
some 10
thought 10
occurred 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
made 10
search 10
of 10
my 10
portmanteau 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
wardrobe 10
where 10
i 10
had 10
placed 10
my 10
clothes 10
the 10
suit 10
in 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
travelled 10
was 10
gone 10
and 10
also 10
my 10
overcoat 10
and 10
rug 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
no 10
trace 10
of 10
them 10
anywhere 10
this 10
looked 10
like 10
some 10
new 10
scheme 10
of 10
villainy 10
junethis 10
morning 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
sitting 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
my 10
bed 10
cudgelling 10
my 10
brains 10
i 10
heard 10
without 10
a 10
crackling 10
of 10
whips 10
and 10
pounding 10
and 10
scraping 10
of 10
horses 10
feet 10
up 10
the 10
rocky 10
path 10
beyond 10
the 10
courtyard 10
with 10
joy 10
i 10
hurried 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
saw 10
drive 10
into 10
the 10
yard 10
two 10
great 10
leiterwagons 10
each 10
drawn 10
by 10
eight 10
sturdy 10
horses 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
head 10
of 10
each 10
pair 10
a 10
slovak 10
with 10
his 10
wide 10
hat 10
great 10
nailstudded 10
belt 10
dirty 10
sheepskin 10
and 10
high 10
boots 10
they 10
had 10
also 10
their 10
long 10
staves 10
in 10
hand 10
i 10
ran 10
to 10
the 10
door 10
intending 10
to 10
descend 10
and 10
try 10
and 10
join 10
them 10
through 10
the 10
main 10
hall 10
as 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
way 10
might 10
be 10
opened 10
for 10
them 10
again 10
a 10
shock 10
my 10
door 10
was 10
fastened 10
on 10
the 10
outside 10
then 10
i 10
ran 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
cried 10
to 10
them 10
they 10
looked 10
up 10
at 10
me 10
stupidly 10
and 10
pointed 10
but 10
just 10
then 10
the 10
hetman 10
of 10
the 10
szgany 10
came 10
out 10
and 10
seeing 10
them 10
pointing 10
to 10
my 10
window 10
said 10
something 10
at 10
which 10
they 10
laughed 10
henceforth 10
no 10
effort 10
of 10
mine 10
no 10
piteous 10
cry 10
or 10
agonized 10
entreaty 10
would 10
make 10
them 10
even 10
look 10
at 10
me 10
they 10
resolutely 10
turned 10
away 10
the 10
leiterwagons 10
contained 10
great 10
square 10
boxes 10
with 10
handles 10
of 10
thick 10
rope 10
these 10
were 10
evidently 10
empty 10
by 10
the 10
ease 10
with 10
which 10
the 10
slovaks 10
handled 10
them 10
and 10
by 10
their 10
resonance 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
roughly 10
moved 10
when 10
they 10
were 10
all 10
unloaded 10
and 10
packed 10
in 10
a 10
great 10
heap 10
in 10
one 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
yard 10
the 10
slovaks 10
were 10
given 10
some 10
money 10
by 10
the 10
szgany 10
and 10
spitting 10
on 10
it 10
for 10
luck 10
lazily 10
went 10
each 10
to 10
his 10
horses 10
head 10
shortly 10
afterwards 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
crackling 10
of 10
their 10
whips 10
die 10
away 10
in 10
the 10
distance 10
junelast 10
night 10
the 10
count 10
left 10
me 10
early 10
and 10
locked 10
himself 10
into 10
his 10
own 10
room 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
i 10
dared 10
i 10
ran 10
up 10
the 10
winding 10
stair 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
which 10
opened 10
south 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
watch 10
for 10
the 10
count 10
for 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
going 10
on 10
the 10
szgany 10
are 10
quartered 10
somewhere 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
and 10
are 10
doing 10
work 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
for 10
now 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
hear 10
a 10
faraway 10
muffled 10
sound 10
as 10
of 10
mattock 10
and 10
spade 10
and 10
whatever 10
it 10
is 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
some 10
ruthless 10
villainy 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
somewhat 10
less 10
than 10
half 10
an 10
hour 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
something 10
coming 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
window 10
i 10
drew 10
back 10
and 10
watched 10
carefully 10
and 10
saw 10
the 10
whole 10
man 10
emerge 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
new 10
shock 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
find 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
on 10
the 10
suit 10
of 10
clothes 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
worn 10
whilst 10
travelling 10
here 10
and 10
slung 10
over 10
his 10
shoulder 10
the 10
terrible 10
bag 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
the 10
women 10
take 10
away 10
there 10
could 10
be 10
no 10
doubt 10
as 10
to 10
his 10
quest 10
and 10
in 10
my 10
garb 10
too 10
this 10
then 10
is 10
his 10
new 10
scheme 10
of 10
evil 10
that 10
he 10
will 10
allow 10
others 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
as 10
they 10
think 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
may 10
both 10
leave 10
evidence 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
seen 10
in 10
the 10
towns 10
or 10
villages 10
posting 10
my 10
own 10
letters 10
and 10
that 10
any 10
wickedness 10
which 10
he 10
may 10
do 10
shall 10
by 10
the 10
local 10
people 10
be 10
attributed 10
to 10
me 10
it 10
makes 10
me 10
rage 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
this 10
can 10
go 10
on 10
and 10
whilst 10
i 10
am 10
shut 10
up 10
here 10
a 10
veritable 10
prisoner 10
but 10
without 10
that 10
protection 10
of 10
the 10
law 10
which 10
is 10
even 10
a 10
criminals 10
right 10
and 10
consolation 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
watch 10
for 10
the 10
counts 10
return 10
and 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
sat 10
doggedly 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
then 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
notice 10
that 10
there 10
were 10
some 10
quaint 10
little 10
specks 10
floating 10
in 10
the 10
rays 10
of 10
the 10
moonlight 10
they 10
were 10
like 10
the 10
tiniest 10
grains 10
of 10
dustand 10
they 10
whirled 10
round 10
and 10
gathered 10
in 10
clusters 10
in 10
a 10
nebulous 10
sort 10
of 10
way 10
i 10
watched 10
them 10
with 10
a 10
sense 10
of 10
soothing 10
and 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
calm 10
stole 10
over 10
me 10
i 10
leaned 10
back 10
in 10
the 10
embrasure 10
in 10
a 10
more 10
comfortable 10
position 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
enjoy 10
more 10
fully 10
the 10
aerial 10
gambolling 10
something 10
made 10
me 10
start 10
up 10
a 10
low 10
piteous 10
howling 10
of 10
dogs 10
somewhere 10
far 10
below 10
in 10
the 10
valley 10
which 10
was 10
hidden 10
from 10
my 10
sight 10
louder 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
ring 10
in 10
my 10
ears 10
and 10
the 10
floating 10
moats 10
of 10
dust 10
to 10
take 10
new 10
shapes 10
to 10
the 10
sound 10
as 10
they 10
danced 10
in 10
the 10
moonlight 10
i 10
felt 10
myself 10
struggling 10
to 10
awake 10
to 10
some 10
call 10
of 10
my 10
instincts 10
nay 10
my 10
very 10
soul 10
was 10
struggling 10
and 10
my 10
halfremembered 10
sensibilities 10
were 10
striving 10
to 10
answer 10
the 10
call 10
i 10
was 10
becoming 10
hypnotised 10
quicker 10
and 10
quicker 10
danced 10
the 10
dust 10
the 10
moonbeams 10
seemed 10
to 10
quiver 10
as 10
they 10
went 10
by 10
me 10
into 10
the 10
mass 10
of 10
gloom 10
beyond 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
they 10
gathered 10
till 10
they 10
seemed 10
to 10
take 10
dim 10
phantom 10
shapes 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
started 10
broad 10
awake 10
and 10
in 10
full 10
possession 10
of 10
my 10
senses 10
and 10
ran 10
screaming 10
from 10
the 10
place 10
the 10
phantom 10
shapes 10
which 10
were 10
becoming 10
gradually 10
materialised 10
from 10
the 10
moonbeams 10
were 10
those 10
three 10
ghostly 10
women 10
to 10
whom 10
i 10
was 10
doomed 10
i 10
fled 10
and 10
felt 10
somewhat 10
safer 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
room 10
where 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
moonlight 10
and 10
where 10
the 10
lamp 10
was 10
burning 10
brightly 10
when 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
hours 10
had 10
passed 10
i 10
heard 10
something 10
stirring 10
in 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
something 10
like 10
a 10
sharp 10
wail 10
quickly 10
suppressed 10
and 10
then 10
there 10
was 10
silence 10
deep 10
awful 10
silence 10
which 10
chilled 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
beating 10
heart 10
i 10
tried 10
the 10
door 10
but 10
i 10
was 10
locked 10
in 10
my 10
prison 10
and 10
could 10
do 10
nothing 10
i 10
sat 10
down 10
and 10
simply 10
cried 10
as 10
i 10
sat 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
sound 10
in 10
the 10
courtyard 10
without 10
the 10
agonised 10
cry 10
of 10
a 10
woman 10
i 10
rushed 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
throwing 10
it 10
up 10
peered 10
between 10
the 10
bars 10
there 10
indeed 10
was 10
a 10
woman 10
with 10
dishevelled 10
hair 10
holding 10
her 10
hands 10
over 10
her 10
heart 10
as 10
one 10
distressed 10
with 10
running 10
she 10
was 10
leaning 10
against 10
the 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
gateway 10
when 10
she 10
saw 10
my 10
face 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
she 10
threw 10
herself 10
forward 10
and 10
shouted 10
in 10
a 10
voice 10
laden 10
with 10
menace 10
monster 10
give 10
me 10
my 10
child 10
she 10
threw 10
herself 10
on 10
her 10
kneesand 10
raising 10
up 10
her 10
hands 10
cried 10
the 10
same 10
words 10
in 10
tones 10
which 10
wrung 10
my 10
heart 10
then 10
she 10
tore 10
her 10
hair 10
and 10
beat 10
her 10
breast 10
and 10
abandoned 10
herself 10
to 10
all 10
the 10
violences 10
of 10
extravagant 10
emotion 10
finally 10
she 10
threw 10
herself 10
forward 10
and 10
though 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
beating 10
of 10
her 10
naked 10
hands 10
against 10
the 10
door 10
somewhere 10
high 10
overhead 10
probably 10
on 10
the 10
tower 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
voice 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
calling 10
in 10
his 10
harsh 10
metallic 10
whisper 10
his 10
call 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
answered 10
from 10
far 10
and 10
wide 10
by 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
before 10
many 10
minutes 10
had 10
passed 10
a 10
pack 10
of 10
them 10
poured 10
like 10
a 10
pentup 10
dam 10
when 10
liberated 10
through 10
the 10
wide 10
entrance 10
into 10
the 10
courtyard 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
cry 10
from 10
the 10
woman 10
and 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
was 10
but 10
short 10
before 10
long 10
they 10
streamed 10
away 10
singly 10
licking 10
their 10
lips 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
pity 10
her 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
now 10
what 10
had 10
become 10
of 10
her 10
child 10
and 10
she 10
was 10
better 10
dead 10
what 10
shall 10
i 10
do 10
what 10
can 10
i 10
do 10
how 10
can 10
i 10
escape 10
from 10
this 10
dreadful 10
thing 10
of 10
night 10
gloom 10
and 10
fear 10
juneno 10
man 10
knows 10
till 10
he 10
has 10
suffered 10
from 10
the 10
night 10
how 10
sweet 10
and 10
dear 10
to 10
his 10
heart 10
and 10
eye 10
the 10
morning 10
can 10
be 10
when 10
the 10
sun 10
grew 10
so 10
high 10
this 10
morning 10
that 10
it 10
struck 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
gateway 10
opposite 10
my 10
window 10
the 10
high 10
spot 10
which 10
it 10
touched 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
dove 10
from 10
the 10
ark 10
had 10
lighted 10
there 10
my 10
fear 10
fell 10
from 10
me 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
a 10
vaporous 10
garment 10
which 10
dissolved 10
in 10
the 10
warmth 10
i 10
must 10
take 10
action 10
of 10
some 10
sort 10
whilst 10
the 10
courage 10
of 10
the 10
day 10
is 10
upon 10
me 10
last 10
night 10
one 10
of 10
my 10
postdated 10
letters 10
went 10
to 10
post 10
the 10
first 10
of 10
that 10
fatal 10
series 10
which 10
is 10
to 10
blot 10
out 10
the 10
very 10
traces 10
of 10
my 10
existence 10
from 10
the 10
earth 10
let 10
me 10
not 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
action 10
it 10
has 10
always 10
been 10
at 10
nighttime 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
molested 10
or 10
threatened 10
or 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
in 10
danger 10
or 10
in 10
fear 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
yet 10
seen 10
the 10
count 10
in 10
the 10
daylight 10
can 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
he 10
sleeps 10
when 10
others 10
wake 10
that 10
he 10
may 10
be 10
awake 10
whilst 10
they 10
sleep 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
get 10
into 10
his 10
room 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
possible 10
way 10
the 10
door 10
is 10
always 10
locked 10
no 10
way 10
for 10
me 10
yes 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
way 10
if 10
one 10
dares 10
to 10
take 10
it 10
where 10
his 10
body 10
has 10
gone 10
why 10
may 10
not 10
another 10
body 10
go 10
i 10
have 10
seen 10
him 10
myself 10
crawl 10
from 10
his 10
window 10
why 10
should 10
not 10
i 10
imitate 10
him 10
and 10
go 10
in 10
by 10
his 10
window 10
the 10
chances 10
are 10
desperate 10
but 10
my 10
need 10
is 10
more 10
desperate 10
still 10
i 10
shall 10
risk 10
it 10
at 10
the 10
worst 10
it 10
can 10
only 10
be 10
death 10
and 10
a 10
mans 10
death 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
calfs 10
and 10
the 10
dreaded 10
hereafter 10
may 10
still 10
be 10
open 10
to 10
me 10

must 10
put 10
down 10
every 10
detail 10
in 10
order 10
i 10
went 10
whilst 10
my 10
courage 10
was 10
fresh 10
straight 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
on 10
the 10
south 10
side 10
and 10
at 10

of 10
time 10
been 10
washed 10
away 10
between 10
them 10
i 10
took 10
off 10
my 10
boots 10
and 10
ventured 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
desperate 10
way 10
i 10
looked 10
down 10
once 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
make 10
sure 10
that 10
a 10
sudden 10
glimpse 10
of 10
the 10
awful 10
depth 10
would 10
not 10
overcome 10
me 10
but 10
after 10
that 10
kept 10
my 10
eyes 10
away 10
from 10
it 10
i 10
know 10
pretty 10
well 10
the 10
direction 10
and 10
distance 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
window 10
and 10
made 10
for 10
it 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
having 10
regard 10
to 10
the 10
opportunities 10
available 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
feel 10
dizzy 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
was 10
too 10
excited 10
and 10
the 10
time 10
seemed 10
ridiculously 10
short 10
till 10
i 10
found 10
myself 10
standing 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
sill 10
and 10
trying 10
to 10
raise 10
up 10
the 10
sash 10
i 10
was 10
filled 10
with 10
agitation 10
however 10
when 10
i 10
bent 10
down 10
and 10
slid 10
feet 10
foremost 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
then 10
i 10
looked 10
around 10
for 10
the 10
count 10
but 10
with 10
surprise 10
and 10
gladness 10
made 10
a 10
discovery 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
empty 10
it 10
was 10
barely 10
furnished 10
with 10
odd 10
things 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
never 10
been 10
used 10
the 10
furniture 10
was 10
something 10
the 10
same 10
style 10
as 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
south 10
rooms 10
and 10
was 10
covered 10
with 10
dust 10
i 10
looked 10
for 10
the 10
key 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
in 10
the 10
lock 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
find 10
it 10
anywhere 10
the 10
only 10
thing 10
i 10
found 10
was 10
a 10
great 10
heap 10
of 10
gold 10
in 10
one 10
corner 10
gold 10
of 10
all 10
kinds 10
roman 10
and 10
british 10
and 10
austrianand 10
hungarianand 10
greek 10
and 10
turkish 10
money 10
covered 10
with 10
a 10
film 10
of 10
dust 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
had 10
lain 10
long 10
in 10
the 10
ground 10
none 10
of 10
it 10
that 10
i 10
noticed 10
was 10
less 10
than 10
three 10
hundred 10
years 10
old 10
there 10
were 10
also 10
chains 10
and 10
ornaments 10
some 10
jewelled 10
but 10
all 10
of 10
them 10
old 10
and 10
stained 10
at 10
one 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
a 10
heavy 10
door 10
i 10
tried 10
it 10
for 10
since 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
find 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
or 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
outer 10
door 10
which 10
was 10
the 10
main 10
object 10
of 10
my 10
search 10
i 10
must 10
make 10
further 10
examination 10
or 10
all 10
my 10
efforts 10
would 10
be 10
in 10
vain 10
it 10
was 10
open 10
and 10
led 10
through 10
a 10
stone 10
passage 10
to 10
a 10
circular 10
stairway 10
which 10
went 10
steeply 10
down 10
i 10
descended 10
minding 10
carefully 10
where 10
i 10
went 10
for 10
the 10
stairs 10
were 10
dark 10
being 10
only 10
lit 10
by 10
loopholes 10
in 10
the 10
heavy 10
masonry 10
at 10
the 10
bottom 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
dark 10
tunnellike 10
passage 10
through 10
which 10
came 10
a 10
deathly 10
sickly 10
odour 10
the 10
odour 10
of 10
old 10
earth 10
newly 10
turned 10
as 10
i 10
went 10
through 10
the 10
passage 10
the 10
smell 10
grew 10
closer 10
and 10
heavier 10
at 10
last 10
i 10
pulled 10
open 10
a 10
heavy 10
door 10
which 10
stood 10
ajar 10
and 10
found 10
myself 10
in 10
an 10
old 10
ruined 10
chapel 10
which 10
had 10
evidently 10
been 10
used 10
as 10
a 10
graveyard 10
the 10
roof 10
was 10
broken 10
and 10
in 10
two 10
places 10
were 10
steps 10
leading 10
to 10
vaults 10
but 10
the 10
ground 10
had 10
recently 10
been 10
dug 10
over 10
and 10
the 10
earth 10
placed 10
in 10
great 10
wooden 10
boxes 10
manifestly 10
those 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
brought 10
by 10
the 10
slovaks 10
there 10
was 10
nobody 10
about 10
and 10
i 10
made 10
a 10
search 10
over 10
every 10
inch 10
of 10
the 10
ground 10
so 10
as 10
not 10
to 10
lose 10
a 10
chance 10
i 10
went 10
down 10
even 10
into 10
the 10
vaults 10
where 10
the 10
dim 10
light 10
struggledalthough 10
to 10
do 10
so 10
was 10
a 10
dread 10
to 10
my 10
very 10
soul 10
into 10
two 10
of 10
these 10
i 10
went 10
but 10
saw 10
nothing 10
except 10
fragments 10
of 10
old 10
coffins 10
and 10
piles 10
of 10
dust 10
in 10
the 10
third 10
however 10
i 10
made 10
a 10
discovery 10
there 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
boxes 10
of 10
which 10
there 10
were 10
fifty 10
in 10
all 10
on 10
a 10
pile 10
of 10
newly 10
dug 10
earth 10
lay 10
the 10
count 10
he 10
was 10
either 10
dead 10
or 10
asleep 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
say 10
which 10
for 10
eyes 10
were 10
open 10
and 10
stony 10
but 10
without 10
the 10
glassiness 10
of 10
deathand 10
the 10
cheeks 10
had 10
the 10
warmth 10
of 10
life 10
through 10
all 10
their 10
pallor 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
as 10
red 10
as 10
ever 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
movement 10
no 10
pulse 10
no 10
breath 10
no 10
beating 10
of 10
the 10
heart 10
i 10
bent 10
over 10
him 10
and 10
tried 10
to 10
find 10
any 10
sign 10
of 10
life 10
but 10
in 10
vain 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
lain 10
there 10
long 10
for 10
the 10
earthy 10
smell 10
would 10
have 10
passed 10
away 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
hours 10
by 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
box 10
was 10
its 10
cover 10
pierced 10
with 10
holes 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
i 10
thought 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
the 10
keys 10
on 10
him 10
but 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
search 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
dead 10
eyes 10
and 10
in 10
them 10
dead 10
though 10
they 10
were 10
such 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
hate 10
though 10
unconscious 10
of 10
me 10
or 10
my 10
presence 10
that 10
i 10
fled 10
from 10
the 10
place 10
and 10
leaving 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
by 10
the 10
window 10
crawled 10
again 10
up 10
the 10
castle 10
wall 10
regaining 10
my 10
room 10
i 10
threw 10
myself 10
panting 10
upon 10
the 10
bed 10
and 10
tried 10
to 10
think 10
junetoday 10
is 10
the 10
date 10
of 10
my 10
last 10
letter 10
and 10
the 10
count 10
has 10
taken 10
steps 10
to 10
prove 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
genuine 10
for 10
again 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
leave 10
the 10
castle 10
by 10
the 10
same 10
window 10
and 10
in 10
my 10
clothes 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
down 10
the 10
wall 10
lizard 10
fashion 10
i 10
wished 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
gun 10
or 10
some 10
lethal 10
weapon 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
destroy 10
him 10
but 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
no 10
weapon 10
wrought 10
along 10
by 10
mans 10
hand 10
would 10
have 10
any 10
effect 10
on 10
him 10
i 10
dared 10
not 10
wait 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
return 10
for 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
see 10
those 10
weird 10
sisters 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
library 10
and 10
read 10
there 10
till 10
i 10
fell 10
asleep 10
i 10
was 10
awakened 10
by 10
the 10
count 10
who 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
as 10
grimly 10
as 10
a 10
man 10
could 10
look 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
tomorrow 10
my 10
friend 10
we 10
must 10
part 10
you 10
return 10
to 10
your 10
beautiful 10
england 10
i 10
to 10
some 10
work 10
which 10
may 10
have 10
such 10
an 10
end 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
never 10
meet 10
your 10
letter 10
home 10
has 10
been 10
despatched 10
tomorrow 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
be 10

but 10
all 10

be 10
ready 10
for 10
your 10
journey 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
come 10
the 10
szgany 10
who 10
have 10
some 10
labours 10
of 10
their 10
own 10
here 10
and 10
also 10
come 10
some 10
slovaks 10
when 10
they 10

gone 10
my 10
carriage 10
shall 10
come 10
for 10
you 10
and 10
shall 10

you 10
to 10

borgo 10

to 10

the 10
diligence 10
from 10
bukovina 10
to 10
bistritz 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
hopes 10
that 10
i 10
shall 10
see 10
more 10
of 10
you 10
at 10
castle 10
dracula 10
i 10
suspected 10
him 10
and 10
determined 10
to 10
test 10
his 10
sincerity 10
sincerity 10
it 10
seems 10
like 10
a 10
profanation 10
of 10
the 10
word 10
to 10
write 10
it 10
in 10
connection 10
with 10
such 10
a 10
monster 10
so 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
pointblank 10
why 10
may 10
i 10
not 10
go 10
tonight 10
because 10
dear 10
sir 10
my 10
coachman 10
and 10
horses 10
are 10
away 10
on 10
a 10
mission 10
but 10
i 10
would 10
walk 10
with 10
pleasure 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
get 10
away 10
at 10
once 10
he 10
smiled 10
such 10
a 10
soft 10
smooth 10
diabolical 10
smile 10
that 10
i 10
knew 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
trick 10
behind 10
his 10
smoothness 10
he 10
said 10
and 10
your 10
baggage 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
care 10
about 10
it 10
i 10
can 10
send 10
for 10
it 10
some 10
other 10
time 10
the 10
count 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
with 10
a 10
sweet 10
courtesy 10
which 10
made 10
me 10
rub 10
my 10
eyes 10
it 10
seemed 10
so 10
real 10
you 10
english 10
have 10
a 10
saying 10
which 10
is 10
close 10
to 10
my 10
heart 10
for 10
its 10
spirit 10
is 10
that 10
which 10
rules 10
our 10
boyars 10
welcome 10
the 10
coming 10
speed 10
the 10
parting 10
guest 10
come 10
with 10
me 10
my 10
dear 10
young 10
friend 10
not 10
an 10
hour 10
shall 10
you 10
wait 10
in 10
my 10
house 10
against 10
your 10
will 10
though 10
sad 10
am 10
i 10
at 10
your 10
goingand 10
that 10
you 10
so 10
suddenly 10
desire 10
it 10
come 10
with 10
a 10
stately 10
gravity 10
he 10
with 10
the 10
lamp 10
preceded 10
me 10
down 10
the 10
stairs 10
and 10
along 10
the 10
hall 10
suddenly 10
he 10
stopped 10
hark 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
came 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
many 10
wolves 10
it 10
was 10
almost 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
sound 10
sprang 10
up 10
at 10
the 10
rising 10
of 10
his 10
hand 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
music 10
of 10
a 10
great 10
orchestra 10
seems 10
to 10
leap 10
under 10
the 10
baton 10
of 10
the 10
conductor 10
after 10
a 10
pause 10
of 10
a 10
moment 10
he 10
proceeded 10
in 10
his 10
stately 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
door 10
drew 10
back 10
the 10
ponderous 10
bolts 10
unhooked 10
the 10
heavy 10
chains 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
draw 10
it 10
open 10
to 10
my 10
intense 10
astonishment 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
unlocked 10
suspiciously 10
i 10
looked 10
all 10
round 10
but 10
could 10
see 10
no 10
key 10
of 10
any 10
kind 10
as 10
the 10
door 10
began 10
to 10
open 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
without 10
grew 10
louder 10
and 10
angrier 10
their 10
red 10
jaws 10
with 10
champing 10
teeth 10
and 10
their 10
bluntclawed 10
feet 10
as 10
they 10
leaped 10
came 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
opening 10
door 10
i 10
knew 10
than 10
that 10
to 10
struggle 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
against 10
the 10
count 10
was 10
useless 10
with 10
such 10
allies 10
as 10
these 10
at 10
his 10
command 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
nothing 10
but 10
still 10
the 10
door 10
continued 10
slowly 10
to 10
open 10
and 10
only 10
the 10
counts 10
body 10
stood 10
in 10
the 10
gap 10
suddenly 10
it 10
struck 10
me 10
that 10
this 10
might 10
be 10
the 10
moment 10
and 10
means 10
of 10
my 10
doom 10
i 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
given 10
to 10
the 10
wolves 10
and 10
at 10
my 10
own 10
instigation 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
diabolical 10
wickedness 10
in 10
the 10
idea 10
great 10
enough 10
for 10
the 10
count 10
and 10
as 10
the 10
last 10
chance 10
i 10
cried 10
out 10
shut 10
the 10
door 10
i 10
shall 10
wait 10
till 10
morning 10
and 10
i 10
covered 10
my 10
face 10
with 10
my 10
hands 10
to 10
hide 10
my 10
tears 10
of 10
bitter 10
disappointment 10
with 10
one 10
sweep 10
of 10
his 10
powerful 10
arm 10
the 10
count 10
threw 10
the 10
door 10
shut 10
and 10
the 10
great 10
bolts 10
clanged 10
and 10
echoed 10
through 10
the 10
hall 10
as 10
they 10
shot 10
back 10
into 10
their 10
places 10
in 10
silence 10
we 10
returned 10
to 10
the 10
library 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
minute 10
or 10
two 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
room 10
the 10
last 10
i 10
saw 10
of 10
count 10
dracula 10
was 10
his 10
kissing 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
red 10
light 10
of 10
triumph 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
smile 10
that 10
judas 10
in 10
hell 10
might 10
be 10
proud 10
of 10
when 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
about 10
to 10
lie 10
down 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
whispering 10
at 10
my 10
door 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
it 10
softly 10
and 10
listened 10
unless 10
my 10
ears 10
deceived 10
me 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
voice 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
back 10
back 10
to 10
your 10
own 10
place 10
your 10
time 10
is 10
not 10
yet 10
come 10
wait 10
have 10
patience 10
tonight 10
is 10
mine 10
tomorrow 10
night 10
is 10
yours 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
low 10
sweet 10
ripple 10
of 10
laughter 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
rage 10
i 10
threw 10
open 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
saw 10
without 10
the 10
three 10
terrible 10
women 10
licking 10
their 10
lips 10
as 10
i 10
appeared 10
they 10
all 10
joined 10
in 10
a 10
horrible 10
laugh 10
and 10
ran 10
away 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
threw 10
myself 10
on 10
my 10
knees 10
it 10
is 10
then 10
so 10
near 10
the 10
end 10
tomorrow 10
tomorrow 10
lord 10
help 10
me 10
and 10
those 10
to 10
whom 10
i 10
am 10
dear 10
junethese 10
may 10
be 10
the 10
last 10
words 10
i 10
ever 10
write 10
in 10
this 10
diary 10
i 10
slept 10
till 10
just 10
before 10
the 10
dawn 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
woke 10
threw 10
myself 10
on 10
my 10
knees 10
for 10
i 10
determined 10
that 10
if 10
death 10
came 10
he 10
should 10
find 10
me 10
ready 10
at 10
last 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
subtle 10
change 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
and 10
knew 10
that 10
the 10
morning 10
had 10
come 10
then 10
came 10
the 10
welcome 10
cockcrow 10
and 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
safe 10
with 10
a 10
glad 10
heart 10
i 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
ran 10
down 10
the 10
hall 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
that 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
unlocked 10
and 10
now 10
escape 10
was 10
before 10
me 10
with 10
hands 10
that 10
trembled 10
with 10
eagerness 10
i 10
unhooked 10
the 10
chains 10
and 10
threw 10
back 10
the 10
massive 10
bolts 10
but 10
the 10
door 10
would 10
not 10
move 10
despair 10
seized 10
me 10
i 10
pulled 10
and 10
pulled 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
shook 10
it 10
till 10
massive 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
it 10
rattled 10
in 10
its 10
casement 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
bolt 10
shot 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
locked 10
after 10
i 10
left 10
the 10
count 10
then 10
a 10
wild 10
desire 10
took 10
me 10
to 10
obtain 10
the 10
key 10
at 10
any 10
riskand 10
i 10
determined 10
then 10
and 10
there 10
to 10
scale 10
the 10
wall 10
again 10
and 10
gain 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
he 10
might 10
kill 10
me 10
but 10
death 10
now 10
seemed 10
the 10
happier 10
choice 10
of 10
evils 10
without 10
a 10
pause 10
i 10
rushed 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
east 10
window 10
and 10
scrambled 10
down 10
the 10
wallas 10
before 10
into 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
it 10
was 10
empty 10
but 10
that 10
was 10
as 10
i 10
expected 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
a 10
key 10
anywhere 10
but 10
the 10
heap 10
of 10
gold 10
remained 10
i 10
went 10
through 10
the 10
door 10
in 10
the 10
corner 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
winding 10
stair 10
and 10
along 10
the 10
dark 10
passage 10
to 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
i 10
knew 10
now 10
well 10
enough 10
where 10
to 10
find 10
the 10
monster 10
i 10
sought 10
the 10
great 10
box 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
place 10
close 10
against 10
the 10
wall 10
but 10
the 10
lid 10
was 10
laid 10
on 10
it 10
not 10
fastened 10
down 10
but 10
with 10
the 10
nails 10
ready 10
in 10
their 10
places 10
to 10
be 10
hammered 10
home 10
i 10
knew 10
i 10
must 10
reach 10
the 10
body 10
for 10
the 10
key 10
so 10
i 10
raised 10
the 10
lid 10
and 10
laid 10
it 10
back 10
against 10
the 10
wall 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
saw 10
something 10
which 10
filled 10
my 10
very 10
soul 10
with 10
horror 10
there 10
lay 10
the 10
count 10
but 10
looking 10
as 10
if 10
his 10
youth 10
had 10
been 10
half 10
restored 10
for 10
the 10
white 10
hair 10
and 10
moustache 10
were 10
changed 10
to 10
dark 10
irongrey 10
the 10
cheeks 10
were 10
fuller 10
and 10
the 10
white 10
skin 10
seemed 10
rubyred 10
underneath 10
the 10
mouth 10
was 10
redder 10
than 10
ever 10
for 10
on 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
gouts 10
of 10
fresh 10
blood 10
which 10
trickled 10
from 10
the 10
corners 10
of 10
the 10
mouth 10
and 10
ran 10
down 10
over 10
the 10
chin 10
and 10
neck 10
even 10
the 10
deep 10
burning 10
eyes 10
seemed 10
set 10
amongst 10
swollen 10
flesh 10
for 10
the 10
lids 10
and 10
pouches 10
underneath 10
were 10
bloated 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
whole 10
awful 10
creature 10
were 10
simply 10
gorged 10
with 10
blood 10
he 10
lay 10
like 10
a 10
filthy 10
leech 10
exhausted 10
with 10
his 10
repletion 10
i 10
shuddered 10
as 10
i 10
bent 10
over 10
to 10
touch 10
himand 10
every 10
sense 10
in 10
me 10
revolted 10
at 10
the 10
contact 10
but 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
search 10
or 10
i 10
was 10
lost 10
the 10
coming 10
night 10
might 10
see 10
my 10
own 10
body 10
a 10
banquet 10
in 10
a 10
similar 10
war 10
to 10
those 10
horrid 10
three 10
i 10
felt 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
body 10
but 10
no 10
sign 10
could 10
i 10
find 10
of 10
the 10
key 10
then 10
i 10
stopped 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
the 10
count 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
mocking 10
smile 10
on 10
the 10
bloated 10
face 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
drive 10
me 10
mad 10
this 10
was 10
the 10
being 10
i 10
was 10
helping 10
to 10
transfer 10
to 10
london 10
where 10
perhaps 10
for 10
centuries 10
to 10
come 10
he 10
might 10
amongst 10
its 10
teeming 10
millions 10
satiate 10
his 10
lust 10
for 10
blood 10
and 10
create 10
a 10
new 10
and 10
everwidening 10
circle 10
of 10
semidemons 10
to 10
batten 10
on 10
the 10
helpless 10
the 10
very 10
thought 10
drove 10
me 10
mad 10
a 10
terrible 10
desire 10
came 10
upon 10
me 10
to 10
rid 10
the 10
world 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
monster 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
lethal 10
weapon 10
at 10
hand 10
but 10
i 10
seized 10
a 10
shovel 10
which 10
the 10
workmen 10
had 10
been 10
using 10
to 10
fill 10
the 10
cases 10
and 10
lifting 10
it 10
high 10
struck 10
with 10
the 10
edge 10
downward 10
at 10
the 10
hateful 10
face 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
the 10
head 10
turned 10
and 10
the 10
eyes 10
fell 10
upon 10
me 10
with 10
all 10
their 10
blaze 10
of 10
basilisk 10
horror 10
the 10
sight 10
seemed 10
to 10
paralyze 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
shovel 10
turned 10
in 10
my 10
hand 10
and 10
glanced 10
from 10
the 10
face 10
merely 10
making 10
a 10
deep 10
gash 10
above 10
the 10
forehead 10
the 10
shovel 10
fell 10
from 10
my 10
hand 10
across 10
the 10
boxand 10
as 10
i 10
pulled 10
it 10
away 10
the 10
flange 10
of 10
the 10
blade 10
caught 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
lid 10
which 10
fell 10
over 10
again 10
and 10
hid 10
the 10
horrid 10
thing 10
from 10
my 10
sight 10
the 10
last 10
glimpse 10
i 10
had 10
was 10
of 10
the 10
bloated 10
face 10
bloodstained 10
and 10
fixed 10
with 10
a 10
grin 10
of 10
malice 10
which 10
would 10
have 10
held 10
its 10
own 10
in 10
the 10
nethermost 10
hell 10
i 10
thought 10
and 10
thought 10
what 10
should 10
be 10
my 10
next 10
move 10
but 10
my 10
brain 10
seemed 10
on 10
fireand 10
i 10
waited 10
with 10
a 10
despairing 10
feeling 10
growing 10
over 10
me 10
as 10
i 10
waited 10
i 10
heard 10
in 10
the 10
distance 10
a 10
gipsy 10
song 10
sung 10
by 10
merry 10
voices 10
coming 10
closer 10
and 10
through 10
their 10
song 10
the 10
rolling 10
of 10
heavy 10
wheels 10
and 10
the 10
cracking 10
of 10
whips 10
the 10
szgany 10
and 10
the 10
slovaks 10
of 10
whom 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
spoken 10
were 10
coming 10
with 10
a 10
last 10
look 10
around 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
box 10
which 10
contained 10
the 10
vile 10
body 10
i 10
ran 10
from 10
the 10
place 10
and 10
gained 10
the 10
counts 10
room 10
determined 10
to 10
rush 10
out 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
the 10
door 10
should 10
be 10
opened 10
with 10
strained 10
ears 10
i 10
listened 10
and 10
heard 10
downstairs 10
the 10
grinding 10
of 10
the 10
key 10
in 10
the 10
great 10
lock 10
and 10
the 10
falling 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
heavy 10
door 10
there 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
some 10
other 10
means 10
of 10
entry 10
or 10
some 10
one 10
had 10
a 10
key 10
for 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
locked 10
doors 10
then 10
there 10
came 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
many 10
feet 10
tramping 10
and 10
dying 10
away 10
in 10
some 10
passage 10
which 10
sent 10
up 10
a 10
clanging 10
echo 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
run 10
down 10
again 10
towards 10
the 10
vault 10
where 10
i 10
might 10
find 10
the 10
new 10
entrance 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
there 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
a 10
violent 10
puff 10
of 10
wind 10
and 10
the 10
door 10
to 10
the 10
winding 10
stair 10
blew 10
to 10
with 10
a 10
shock 10
that 10
set 10
the 10
dust 10
from 10
the 10
lintels 10
flying 10
when 10
i 10
ran 10
to 10
push 10
it 10
open 10
i 10
found 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
hopelessly 10
fast 10
i 10
was 10
again 10
a 10
prisoner 10
and 10
the 10
net 10
of 10
doom 10
was 10
closing 10
round 10
me 10
more 10
closely 10
as 10
i 10
write 10
there 10
is 10
in 10
the 10
passage 10
below 10
a 10
sound 10
of 10
many 10
tramping 10
feet 10
and 10
the 10
crash 10
of 10
weights 10
being 10
set 10
down 10
heavily 10
doubtless 10
the 10
boxes 10
with 10
their 10
freight 10
of 10
earth 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
sound 10
of 10
hammering 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
box 10
being 10
nailed 10
down 10
now 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
the 10
heavy 10
feet 10
tramping 10
again 10
along 10
the 10
hall 10
with 10
with 10
many 10
other 10
idle 10
feet 10
coming 10
behind 10
them 10
the 10
door 10
is 10
shut 10
the 10
chains 10
rattle 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
grinding 10
of 10
the 10
key 10
in 10
the 10
lock 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
the 10
key 10
withdrawn 10
then 10
another 10
door 10
opens 10
and 10
shuts 10
i 10
hear 10
the 10
creaking 10
of 10
lock 10
and 10
bolt 10
hark 10
in 10
the 10
courtyard 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
rocky 10
way 10
the 10
roll 10
of 10
heavy 10
wheels 10
the 10
crack 10
of 10
whips 10
and 10
the 10
chorus 10
of 10
the 10
szgany 10
as 10
they 10
pass 10
into 10
the 10
distance 10
i 10
am 10
alone 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
with 10
those 10
horrible 10
women 10
faugh 10
mina 10
is 10
a 10
woman 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
nought 10
in 10
common 10
they 10
are 10
devils 10
of 10
the 10
pit 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
remain 10
alone 10
with 10
them 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
scale 10
the 10
castle 10
wall 10
farther 10
than 10
i 10
have 10
yet 10
attempted 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
gold 10
with 10
me 10
lest 10
i 10
want 10
it 10
later 10
i 10
may 10
find 10
a 10
way 10
from 10
this 10
dreadful 10
place 10
and 10
then 10
away 10
for 10
home 10
away 10
to 10
the 10
quickest 10
and 10
nearest 10
train 10
away 10
from 10
the 10
cursed 10
spot 10
from 10
this 10
cursed 10
land 10
where 10
the 10
devil 10
and 10
his 10
children 10
still 10
walk 10
with 10
earthly 10
feet 10
at 10
least 10
gods 10
mercy 10
is 10
better 10
than 10
that 10
of 10
those 10
monsters 10
and 10
the 10
precipice 10
is 10
steep 10
and 10
high 10
at 10
its 10
foot 10

our 10
castles 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
i 10
have 10
been 10

be 10
able 10
to 10

wants 10
to 10

in 10
this 10
way 10
and 10
write 10

out 10
for 10
him 10
on 10
the 10

and 10
he 10
is 10
keeping 10
a 10

dont 10
mean 10
one 10
of 10
those 10
twopagestotheweekwithsundaysqueezedinacorner 10
diaries 10
but 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
journal 10
which 10
i 10
can 10
write 10
in 10
whenever 10
i 10
feel 10
inclined 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
suppose 10
there 10
will 10
be 10
much 10
of 10
interest 10
to 10
other 10
people 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
intended 10
for 10
them 10
i 10
may 10
show 10
it 10
to 10
jonathan 10
some 10
day 10
if 10
there 10
is 10
in 10
it 10
anything 10
worth 10
sharing 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
really 10
an 10
exercise 10
book 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
do 10
what 10
i 10
see 10
lady 10
journalists 10
do 10
interviewing 10
and 10
writing 10
descriptions 10
and 10
trying 10
to 10
remember 10
conversations 10
i 10
am 10
told 10
that 10
with 10
a 10
little 10
practice 10
one 10
can 10
remember 10
all 10
that 10
goes 10
on 10
or 10
that 10
one 10
hears 10
said 10
during 10
a 10
day 10

shall 10
see 10

a 10
few 10
hurried 10

nice 10

shall 10
ever 10

wednesday 10
my 10
dearest 10
mina 10
i 10
must 10
say 10
you 10
tax 10
me 10
very 10
unfairly 10
with 10
being 10
a 10
bad 10
correspondent 10
i 10
wrote 10
you 10
twice 10
since 10
we 10
parted 10
and 10
your 10
last 10
letter 10
was 10
only 10
your 10
second 10
besides 10
i 10
have 10
nothing 10
to 10
tell 10
you 10
there 10
is 10
really 10
nothing 10
to 10
interest 10
you 10
town 10
is 10
very 10
pleasant 10
just 10
now 10
and 10
we 10
go 10
a 10
great 10
deal 10
to 10
picturegalleries 10
and 10
for 10
walks 10
and 10
rides 10
in 10
the 10
park 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
tall 10
curlyhaired 10
man 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
one 10
who 10
was 10
with 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
last 10
pop 10
someone 10
has 10
evidently 10
been 10
telling 10
tales 10
that 10
was 10
mr 10
holmwood 10
he 10
often 10
comes 10
to 10
see 10
us 10
and 10
he 10
and 10
mamma 10
get 10
on 10
very 10
well 10
together 10
they 10
have 10
so 10
many 10
things 10
to 10
talk 10
about 10
in 10
common 10
we 10
met 10
some 10
time 10
ago 10
a 10
man 10
that 10
would 10
just 10
do 10
for 10
you 10
if 10
you 10
were 10
not 10
already 10
engaged 10
to 10
jonathan 10
he 10
is 10
an 10
excellant 10
parti 10
being 10
handsome 10
well 10
off 10
and 10
of 10
good 10
birth 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
doctor 10
and 10
really 10
clever 10
just 10
fancy 10
he 10
is 10
only 10
nineand 10
twenty 10
and 10
he 10
has 10
an 10
immense 10
lunatic 10
asylum 10
all 10
under 10
his 10
own 10
care 10
mr 10
holmwood 10
introduced 10
him 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
he 10
called 10
here 10
to 10
see 10
us 10
and 10
often 10
comes 10
now 10
i 10
think 10
he 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
most 10
resolute 10
men 10
i 10
ever 10
saw 10
and 10
yet 10
the 10
most 10
calm 10
he 10
seems 10
absolutely 10
imperturbable 10
i 10
can 10
fancy 10
what 10
a 10
wonderful 10
power 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
over 10
his 10
patients 10
he 10
has 10
a 10
curious 10
habit 10
of 10
looking 10
one 10
straight 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
as 10
if 10
trying 10
to 10
read 10
ones 10
thoughts 10
he 10
tries 10
this 10
on 10
very 10
much 10
with 10
me 10
but 10
i 10
flatter 10
myself 10
he 10
has 10
got 10
a 10
tough 10
nut 10
to 10
crack 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
from 10
my 10
glass 10
do 10
you 10
ever 10
try 10
to 10
read 10
your 10
own 10
face 10
i 10
do 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
tell 10
you 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
bad 10
study 10
and 10
gives 10
you 10
more 10
trouble 10
than 10
you 10
can 10
well 10
fancy 10
if 10
you 10
have 10
never 10
tried 10
it 10
he 10
say 10
that 10
i 10
afford 10
him 10
a 10
curious 10
psychological 10
study 10
and 10
i 10
humbly 10
think 10
i 10
do 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
as 10
you 10
know 10
take 10
sufficient 10
interest 10
in 10
dress 10
to 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
describe 10
the 10
new 10
fashions 10
dress 10
is 10
a 10
bore 10
that 10
is 10
slang 10
again 10
but 10
never 10
mind 10

all 10

of 10
extravagant 10
ideas 10
and 10
imagining 10

your 10
place 10
certainly 10

women 10
certainly 10
their 10
wives 10
to 10
be 10
quite 10
as 10
fair 10
as 10
they 10
are 10
and 10
women 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10

not 10
always 10
quite 10
as 10
fair 10
as 10
they 10
should 10
be 10
well 10
my 10
dear 10
number 10
one 10
came 10
just 10
before 10
lunch 10
i 10
told 10
you 10
of 10
him 10
dr 10
john 10
seward 10
the 10
lunatic 10
asylum 10
man 10
with 10
the 10
strong 10
jaw 10
and 10
the 10
good 10
forehead 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
cool 10
outwardly 10
but 10
was 10
nervous 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
been 10
schooling 10
himself 10
as 10
to 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
little 10
things 10
and 10
remembered 10
them 10
but 10
he 10
almost 10
managed 10
to 10
sit 10
down 10
on 10
his 10
silk 10
hat 10
which 10
men 10
dont 10
generally 10
do 10
when 10
they 10
are 10
cool 10
and 10
then 10
when 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
appear 10
at 10
ease 10
he 10
kept 10
playing 10
with 10
a 10
lancet 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
made 10
me 10
nearly 10
scream 10
he 10
spoke 10
to 10
me 10
mina 10
very 10
straightfordwardly 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
how 10
dear 10
i 10
was 10
to 10
him 10
though 10
he 10
had 10
known 10
me 10
so 10
little 10
and 10
what 10
his 10
life 10
would 10
be 10
with 10
me 10
to 10
help 10
and 10
cheer 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
how 10
unhappy 10
he 10
would 10
be 10
if 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
care 10
for 10
him 10
but 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
cry 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
brute 10
and 10
would 10
not 10
add 10
to 10
my 10
present 10
trouble 10
then 10
he 10
broke 10
off 10
and 10
asked 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
love 10
him 10
in 10
time 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
shook 10
my 10
head 10
his 10
hands 10
trembled 10
and 10
then 10
with 10
some 10
hesitation 10
he 10
asked 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
cared 10
already 10
for 10
any 10
one 10
else 10
he 10
put 10
it 10
very 10
nicely 10
saying 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
want 10
to 10
wring 10
my 10
confidence 10
from 10
me 10
but 10
only 10
to 10
know 10
because 10
if 10
a 10
womans 10
heart 10
was 10
free 10
a 10
man 10
might 10
have 10
hope 10
and 10
then 10
mina 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
duty 10
to 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
one 10
i 10
only 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
much 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
he 10
looked 10
very 10
strong 10
and 10
very 10
grave 10
as 10
he 10
took 10
both 10
my 10
hands 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
said 10
he 10
hoped 10
i 10
would 10
be 10
happy 10
and 10
that 10
if 10
i 10
ever 10
wanted 10
a 10
friend 10
i 10
must 10
count 10
him 10
one 10
of 10
my 10
best 10
oh 10
mina 10
dear 10
i 10
cant 10
help 10
crying 10
and 10
you 10
must 10
excuse 10
this 10
letter 10
being 10
all 10
blotted 10
being 10
proposed 10
to 10
is 10
all 10
very 10
nice 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
sort 10
of 10
thing 10
but 10
it 10
isnt 10
at 10
all 10
a 10
happy 10
thing 10
when 10
you 10
have 10
to 10
see 10
a 10
poor 10
fellow 10
whom 10
you 10
know 10
loves 10
you 10
honestly 10
going 10
away 10
and 10
looking 10
all 10
broken 10
hearted 10
and 10
to 10
know 10
that 10
no 10
matter 10
what 10
he 10
may 10
say 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
you 10
are 10
passing 10
out 10
of 10
his 10
life 10
my 10
dear 10
i 10
must 10
stop 10
here 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
feel 10
so 10
miserable 10
though 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
happy 10
evening 10
arthur 10
has 10
just 10
gone 10
and 10
i 10
feel 10
in 10
better 10
spirits 10
than 10
when 10
i 10
left 10
off 10
so 10
i 10
can 10
go 10
on 10
telling 10
you 10
about 10
the 10
day 10
well 10
my 10
dear 10
number 10
two 10
came 10
after 10
lunch 10
he 10
is 10
such 10
a 10
nice 10
fellowand 10
american 10
from 10
texas 10
and 10
he 10
looks 10
so 10
young 10
and 10
so 10
fresh 10
that 10
it 10
seems 10
almost 10
impossible 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
to 10
so 10
many 10
places 10
and 10
has 10
such 10
adventures 10
i 10
sympathize 10
with 10
poor 10
desdemona 10
when 10
she 10
had 10
such 10
a 10
stream 10
poured 10
in 10
her 10
ear 10
even 10
by 10
a 10
black 10
man 10
i 10
suppose 10
that 10
we 10
women 10
are 10
such 10
cowards 10
that 10
we 10
think 10
a 10
man 10
will 10
save 10
us 10
from 10
fears 10
and 10
we 10
marry 10
him 10
i 10
know 10
now 10
what 10
i 10
would 10
do 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
a 10
man 10
and 10
wanted 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
girl 10
love 10
me 10
no 10
i 10
dont 10
for 10
there 10
was 10
mr 10
morris 10
telling 10
us 10
his 10

that 10
a 10
man 10
always 10
does 10
find 10
a 10
girl 10
alone 10
no 10
he 10
doesnt 10
for 10
arthur 10
tried 10
twice 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
chance 10
and 10
i 10
helping 10
him 10
all 10
i 10
could 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
ashamed 10
to 10
say 10
it 10
now 10
i 10
must 10
tell 10
you 10
beforehand 10
that 10
mr 10
morris 10
doesnt 10
always 10
speak 10
slang 10
that 10
is 10
to 10
say 10
he 10
never 10
does 10
so 10
to 10
strangers 10
or 10
before 10
them 10
for 10
he 10
is 10
really 10
well 10
educated 10
and 10
has 10
exquisite 10
manners 10
but 10
he 10
found 10
out 10
that 10
it 10
amused 10
me 10
to 10
hear 10
him 10
talk 10
american 10
slangand 10
whenever 10
i 10
was 10
present 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
to 10
be 10
shocked 10
he 10
said 10
such 10
funny 10
things 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
my 10
dear 10
he 10
has 10
to 10
invent 10
it 10
all 10
for 10
it 10
fits 10
exactly 10
into 10
whatever 10
else 10
he 10
has 10
to 10
say 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
way 10
slang 10
has 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
myself 10
if 10
i 10
shall 10
ever 10
speak 10
slang 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
if 10
arthur 10
likes 10
it 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
never 10
heard 10
him 10
use 10
any 10
as 10
yet 10
well 10
mr 10
morris 10
sat 10
down 10
beside 10
me 10
and 10
looked 10
as 10
happy 10
and 10
jolly 10
as 10
he 10
could 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
nervous 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
said 10
ever 10
so 10
sweetly 10
miss 10
lucy 10
i 10
know 10
i 10
aint 10
good 10
enough 10
to 10
regulate 10
the 10
fixins 10
of 10
your 10
little 10
shoes 10
but 10
i 10
guess 10
if 10
you 10
wait 10
till 10
you 10
find 10
a 10
man 10
that 10
is 10
you 10
will 10
go 10
join 10
them 10
seven 10
young 10
women 10
with 10
the 10
lamps 10
when 10
you 10
quit 10
wont 10
you 10
just 10
hitch 10
up 10
alongside 10
of 10
me 10
and 10
let 10
us 10
go 10
down 10
the 10
long 10
road 10
together 10
driving 10
in 10
double 10
harness 10
well 10
he 10
did 10
look 10
so 10
hood 10
humoured 10
and 10
so 10
jolly 10
that 10
it 10
didnt 10
seem 10
half 10
so 10
hard 10
to 10
refuse 10
him 10
as 10
it 10
did 10
poor 10
dr 10
seward 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
as 10
lightly 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
anything 10
of 10
hitching 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
wasnt 10
broken 10
to 10
harness 10
at 10
all 10
yet 10
then 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
spoken 10
in 10
a 10
light 10
manner 10
and 10
he 10
hoped 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
made 10
a 10
mistake 10
in 10
doing 10
so 10
on 10
so 10
grave 10
so 10
momentous 10
and 10
occasion 10
for 10
him 10
i 10
would 10
forgive 10
him 10
he 10
really 10
did 10
look 10
serious 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
saying 10
it 10
and 10
i 10
couldnt 10
help 10
feeling 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
exultation 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
number 10
two 10
in 10
one 10
day 10
and 10
then 10
my 10
dear 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
say 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
began 10
pouring 10
out 10
a 10
perfect 10
torrent 10
of 10
lovemaking 10
laying 10
his 10
very 10
heart 10
and 10
soul 10
at 10
my 10
feet 10
he 10
looked 10
so 10
earnest 10
over 10
it 10
that 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
again 10
think 10
that 10
a 10
man 10
must 10
be 10
playful 10
always 10
and 10
never 10
earnest 10
because 10
he 10
is 10
merry 10
at 10
times 10
i 10
suppose 10
he 10
saw 10
something 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
which 10
checked 10
him 10
for 10
he 10
suddenly 10
stoppedand 10
said 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
manly 10
fervour 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
have 10
loved 10
him 10
for 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
free 10
lucy 10
you 10
are 10
an 10
honest 10
hearted 10
girl 10
i 10
know 10
i 10
should 10
not 10
be 10
here 10
speaking 10
to 10
you 10
as 10
i 10
am 10
now 10
if 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
believe 10
you 10
clean 10
grit 10
right 10
through 10
to 10
the 10
very 10
depths 10
of 10
your 10
soul 10
tell 10
me 10
like 10
one 10
good 10
fellow 10
to 10
another 10
is 10
there 10
any 10
one 10
else 10
that 10
you 10
care 10
for 10
and 10
if 10
there 10
is 10
ill 10
never 10
trouble 10
you 10
a 10
hairs 10
breadth 10
again 10
but 10
will 10
be 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
let 10
me 10
a 10
very 10
faithful 10
friend 10
my 10
dear 10
mina 10
why 10
are 10
men 10
so 10
noble 10
when 10
we 10
women 10
are 10
so 10
little 10
worthy 10
of 10
them 10
here 10
was 10
i 10
almost 10
making 10
fun 10
of 10
this 10
great 10
hearted 10
true 10
gentleman 10
i 10
burst 10
into 10
tears 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
my 10
dear 10
you 10
will 10
think 10
this 10
a 10
very 10
sloppy 10
letter 10
in 10
more 10
ways 10
than 10
one 10
and 10
i 10
really 10
felt 10
very 10
badly 10
why 10
cant 10
they 10
let 10
a 10
girl 10
marry 10
three 10
men 10
or 10
as 10
many 10
as 10
want 10
her 10
and 10
save 10
all 10
this 10
trouble 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
heresy 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
say 10
it 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
though 10
i 10
was 10
crying 10
i 10
was 10
able 10
to 10
look 10
into 10
mr 10
morris 10
brave 10
eyes 10
and 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
out 10
straight 10
yes 10
there 10
is 10
some 10
one 10
i 10
love 10
though 10
he 10
has 10
not 10
told 10
me 10
yet 10
that 10
he 10
even 10
loves 10
me 10
i 10
was 10
right 10
to 10
speak 10
to 10
him 10
so 10
frankly 10
for 10
quite 10
a 10
light 10
came 10
into 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
he 10
put 10
out 10
both 10
his 10
hands 10
and 10
took 10
mine 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
put 10
them 10
into 10
his 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
hearty 10
way 10
thats 10
my 10
brave 10
girl 10
its 10
better 10
worth 10
being 10
late 10
for 10
a 10
chance 10
of 10
winning 10
you 10
than 10
being 10
in 10
time 10
for 10

instead 10
since 10
my 10
rebuff 10
of 10
yesterday 10
i 10
have 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
empty 10
feeling 10
nothing 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
seems 10
of 10
sufficient 10
importance 10
to 10
be 10
worth 10
the 10
doing 10
as 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
the 10
only 10
cure 10
for 10
this 10
sort 10
of 10
thing 10
was 10
work 10
i 10
went 10
amongst 10
the 10
patients 10
i 10
picked 10
out 10
one 10
who 10
has 10
afforded 10
me 10
a 10
study 10
of 10
much 10
interest 10
he 10
is 10
so 10
quaint 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
determined 10
to 10
understand 10
him 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
can 10
today 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
get 10
nearer 10
than 10
ever 10
before 10
to 10
the 10
heart 10
of 10
his 10
mystery 10
i 10
questioned 10
him 10
more 10
fully 10
than 10
i 10
had 10
ever 10
done 10
with 10
a 10
view 10
to 10
making 10
myself 10
master 10
of 10
the 10
facts 10
of 10
his 10
hallucination 10
in 10
my 10
manner 10
of 10
doing 10
it 10
there 10
was 10
i 10
now 10
see 10
something 10
of 10
cruelty 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
wish 10
to 10
keep 10
him 10
to 10
the 10
point 10
of 10
his 10
madness 10
a 10
thing 10
which 10
i 10
avoid 10
with 10
the 10
patients 10
as 10
i 10
would 10

the 10

looking 10
sweeter 10
and 10
lovlier 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
we 10
drove 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
at 10
the 10
crescent 10
in 10
which 10
they 10
have 10
rooms 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
lovely 10
place 10
the 10
little 10
river 10
the 10
esk 10
runs 10
through 10
a 10
deep 10
valley 10
which 10
broadens 10
out 10
as 10
it 10
comes 10
near 10
the 10
harbour 10
a 10
great 10
viaduct 10
runs 10
across 10
with 10
high 10
piers 10
through 10
which 10
the 10
view 10
seems 10
somehow 10
further 10
away 10
than 10
it 10
really 10
is 10
the 10
valley 10
is 10
beautifully 10
green 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
so 10
steep 10
that 10
when 10
you 10
are 10
on 10
the 10
high 10
land 10
on 10
either 10
side 10
you 10
look 10
right 10
across 10
it 10
unless 10
you 10
are 10
near 10
enough 10
to 10
see 10
down 10
the 10
houses 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
town 10
the 10
side 10
away 10
from 10
us 10
are 10
all 10
redroofed 10
and 10
seem 10
piled 10
up 10
one 10
over 10
the 10
other 10
anyhow 10
like 10
the 10
pictures 10
we 10
see 10
of 10
nuremberg 10
right 10
over 10
the 10
town 10
is 10
the 10
ruin 10
of 10
whitby 10
abbey 10
which 10
was 10
sacked 10
by 10
the 10
danes 10
and 10
which 10
is 10
the 10
scene 10
of 10
part 10
of 10
marmion 10
where 10
the 10
girl 10
was 10
built 10
up 10
in 10
the 10
wall 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
most 10
noble 10
ruin 10
of 10
immense 10
size 10
and 10
full 10
of 10
beautiful 10
and 10
romantic 10
bits 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
legend 10
that 10
a 10
white 10
lady 10
is 10
seen 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
windows 10
between 10
it 10
and 10
the 10
town 10
there 10
is 10
another 10
church 10
the 10
parish 10
one 10
round 10
which 10
is 10
a 10
big 10
graveyard 10
all 10
full 10
of 10
tombstones 10
this 10
is 10
to 10
my 10
mind 10
the 10
nicest 10
spot 10
in 10
whitby 10
for 10
it 10
lies 10
right 10
over 10
the 10
town 10
and 10
has 10
a 10
full 10
view 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
and 10
all 10
up 10
the 10
bay 10
to 10
where 10
the 10
headland 10
called 10
kettleness 10
stretches 10
out 10
into 10
the 10
sea 10
it 10
descends 10
so 10
steeply 10
over 10
the 10
harbour 10
that 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
bank 10
has 10
fallen 10
away 10
and 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
graves 10
have 10
been 10
destroyed 10
in 10
one 10
place 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
stonework 10
of 10
the 10
graves 10
stretches 10
out 10
over 10
the 10
sandy 10
pathway 10
far 10
below 10
there 10
are 10
walks 10
with 10
seats 10
beside 10
them 10
through 10
the 10
churchyard 10
and 10
people 10
go 10
and 10
sit 10
there 10
all 10
day 10
long 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
beautiful 10
view 10
and 10
enjoying 10
the 10
breeze 10
i 10
shall 10
come 10
and 10
sit 10
here 10
often 10
myself 10
and 10
work 10
indeed 10
i 10
am 10
writing 10
now 10
with 10
my 10
book 10
on 10
my 10
knee 10
and 10
listening 10
to 10
the 10
talk 10
of 10
three 10
old 10
men 10
who 10
are 10
sitting 10
beside 10
me 10
they 10
seem 10
to 10
do 10
nothing 10
all 10
day 10
but 10
sit 10
here 10
and 10
talk 10
the 10
harbour 10
lies 10
below 10
me 10
with 10
on 10
the 10
far 10
side 10
one 10
long 10
granite 10
wall 10
stretching 10
out 10
into 10
the 10
sea 10
with 10
a 10
curve 10
outwards 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
middle 10
of 10
which 10
is 10
a 10
lighthouse 10
a 10
heavy 10
seawall 10
runs 10
along 10
outside 10
of 10
it 10
on 10
the 10
near 10
side 10
the 10
seawall 10
makes 10
an 10
elbow 10
crooked 10
inversely 10
and 10
its 10
end 10
too 10
has 10
a 10
lighthouse 10
between 10
the 10
two 10
piers 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
narrow 10
opening 10
into 10
the 10
harbour 10
which 10
then 10
suddenly 10
widens 10
it 10
is 10
nice 10
at 10
high 10
water 10
but 10
when 10
the 10
tide 10
is 10
out 10
it 10
shoals 10
away 10
to 10
nothingand 10
there 10
is 10
merely 10
the 10
stream 10
of 10
the 10
esk 10
running 10
between 10
banks 10
of 10
sand 10
with 10
rocks 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
outside 10
the 10
harbour 10
on 10
this 10
side 10
there 10
rises 10
for 10
about 10
half 10
a 10
mile 10
a 10
great 10
reef 10
the 10
sharp 10
of 10
which 10
runs 10
straight 10
out 10
from 10
behind 10
the 10
south 10
lighthouse 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
buoy 10
with 10
a 10
bell 10
which 10
swings 10
in 10
bad 10
weather 10
and 10
sends 10
in 10
a 10
mournful 10
sound 10
on 10
the 10
wind 10
they 10
have 10
a 10
legend 10
here 10
that 10
when 10
a 10
ship 10
is 10
lost 10
bells 10
are 10
heard 10
out 10
at 10

i 10
must 10
ask 10
the 10
old 10
man 10
about 10
this 10

is 10
coming 10
this 10

in 10
the 10
old 10
days 10
he 10
was 10
just 10
settling 10
himself 10
to 10
begin 10
when 10
the 10
clock 10
struck 10
six 10
whereupon 10
he 10
laboured 10
to 10
get 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
must 10
gang 10
ageeanwards 10

for 10
it 10
takes 10
me 10
time 10
to 10
crammle 10
aboon 10
the 10
grees 10
for 10
there 10
be 10
a 10
many 10
of 10
em 10
and 10
miss 10
i 10
lack 10
bellytimber 10
sairly 10
by 10
the 10
clock 10
he 10
hobbled 10
away 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
him 10
hurrying 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
he 10
could 10
down 10
the 10
steps 10
the 10
steps 10
are 10
a 10
great 10
feature 10
on 10
the 10
place 10
they 10
lead 10
from 10
the 10
town 10
to 10
the 10
church 10
there 10
are 10
hundreds 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
how 10
many 10
and 10
they 10
wind 10
up 10
in 10
a 10
delicate 10
curve 10
the 10
slope 10
is 10
so 10
gentle 10
that 10
a 10
horse 10
could 10
easily 10
walk 10
up 10
and 10
down 10
them 10
i 10
think 10
they 10
must 10
originally 10
have 10
had 10
something 10
to 10
do 10
with 10
the 10
abbey 10
i 10
shall 10
go 10
home 10
too 10
lucy 10
went 10
out 10
visiting 10
with 10
her 10
mother 10
and 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
only 10
duty 10
calls 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
go 10
augusti 10
came 10
up 10
here 10
an 10
hour 10
ago 10
with 10
lucy 10
and 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
most 10
interesting 10
talk 10
with 10
my 10
old 10
friend 10
and 10
the 10
two 10
others 10
who 10
always 10
come 10
and 10
join 10
him 10
he 10
is 10
evidently 10
the 10
sir 10
oracle 10
of 10
themand 10
i 10
should 10
think 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
his 10
time 10
a 10
most 10
dictatorial 10
person 10
he 10
will 10
not 10
admit 10
anything 10
and 10
down 10
faces 10
everybody 10
if 10
he 10
cant 10
outargue 10
them 10
he 10
bullies 10
themand 10
then 10
takes 10
their 10
silence 10
for 10
agreement 10
with 10
his 10
views 10
lucy 10
was 10
looking 10
sweetly 10
pretty 10
in 10
her 10
white 10
lawn 10
frock 10
she 10
has 10
got 10
a 10
beautiful 10
colour 10
since 10
she 10
has 10
been 10
here 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
the 10
old 10
men 10
did 10
not 10
lose 10
any 10
time 10
in 10
coming 10
and 10
sitting 10
near 10
her 10
when 10
we 10
sat 10
down 10
she 10
is 10
so 10
sweet 10
with 10
old 10
people 10
i 10
think 10
they 10
all 10
fell 10
in 10
love 10
with 10
her 10
on 10
the 10
spot 10
even 10
my 10
old 10
man 10
succumbed 10
and 10
did 10
not 10
contradict 10
her 10
but 10
gave 10
me 10
double 10
share 10
instead 10
i 10
got 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
of 10
the 10

up 10
our 10

by 10
the 10
aurora 10
borealis 10
this 10
was 10
evidently 10
local 10
pleasantry 10
for 10
the 10
old 10
man 10
cackled 10
over 10
it 10
and 10
his 10
cronies 10
joined 10
in 10
with 10
gusto 10
but 10
i 10
said 10
surely 10
you 10
are 10
not 10
quite 10
correct 10
for 10
you 10
start 10
on 10
the 10
assumption 10
that 10
all 10
the 10
poor 10
people 10
or 10
their 10
spirits 10
will 10
have 10
to 10
take 10
their 10
tombstones 10
with 10
them 10
on 10
the 10
day 10
of 10
judgment 10
do 10
you 10
think 10
that 10
will 10
be 10
really 10
necessary 10
well 10
what 10
else 10
be 10
they 10
tombstones 10
for 10
answer 10
me 10
that 10
miss 10

their 10

i 10
suppose 10
to 10

their 10

suppose 10
this 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
intense 10
scorn 10
how 10
will 10
it 10
pleasure 10
their 10
relatives 10
to 10
know 10
that 10
lies 10
is 10
wrote 10
over 10
them 10
and 10
that 10
everybody 10
in 10
the 10
place 10
knows 10
that 10
they 10
be 10
lies 10
he 10
pointed 10
to 10
a 10
stone 10
at 10
our 10
feet 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
laid 10
down 10
as 10
a 10
slab 10
on 10
which 10
the 10
seat 10
was 10
rested 10
close 10
to 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
cliff 10
read 10
the 10
lies 10
on 10
that 10
thruffstone 10

upside 10
down 10
to 10

from 10

more 10
opposite 10
to 10

leant 10
over 10

read 10
sacred 10
to 10
the 10
memory 10
of 10

nine 10
i 10

the 10
lights 10
scattered 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
town 10
sometimes 10
in 10
rows 10
where 10
the 10
streets 10
are 10
and 10
sometimes 10
singly 10
they 10
run 10
right 10
up 10
the 10
esk 10
and 10
die 10
away 10
in 10
the 10
curve 10
of 10
the 10
valley 10
to 10
my 10
left 10
the 10
view 10
is 10
cut 10
off 10
by 10
a 10
black 10
line 10
of 10
roof 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
house 10
next 10
to 10
the 10
abbey 10
the 10
sheep 10
and 10
lambs 10
are 10
bleating 10
in 10
the 10
fields 10
away 10
behind 10
me 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
clatter 10
of 10
donkeys 10
hoofs 10
up 10
the 10
paved 10
road 10
below 10
the 10
band 10
on 10
the 10
pier 10
is 10
playing 10
a 10
harsh 10
waltz 10
in 10
good 10
time 10
and 10
further 10
along 10
the 10
quay 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
salvation 10
army 10
meeting 10
in 10
a 10
back 10
street 10
neither 10
of 10
the 10
bands 10
hears 10
the 10
other 10
but 10
up 10
here 10
i 10
hear 10
and 10
see 10
them 10
both 10
i 10
wonder 10
where 10
jonathan 10
is 10
and 10
if 10
he 10
is 10
thinking 10
of 10
me 10
i 10
wish 10
he 10
were 10

junethe 10
case 10
of 10
renfield 10
grows 10
more 10
interesting 10
the 10
more 10
i 10
get 10
to 10
understand 10
the 10
man 10
he 10
has 10
certain 10
qualities 10
very 10
largely 10
developed 10
selfishness 10
secrecy 10
and 10
purpose 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
at 10
what 10
is 10
the 10
object 10
of 10
the 10
latter 10
he 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
some 10
settled 10
scheme 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
but 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
his 10
redeeming 10
quality 10
is 10
a 10
love 10
of 10
animals 10
though 10
indeed 10
he 10
has 10
such 10
curious 10
turns 10
in 10
it 10
that 10
i 10
sometimes 10
imagine 10
he 10
is 10
only 10
abnormally 10
cruel 10
his 10
pets 10
are 10
of 10
odd 10
sorts 10
just 10
now 10
his 10
hobby 10
is 10
catching 10
flies 10
he 10
has 10
at 10
present 10
such 10
a 10
quantity 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
myself 10
to 10
expostulate 10
to 10
my 10
astonishment 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
break 10
out 10
into 10
a 10
fury 10
as 10
i 10
expected 10
but 10
took 10
the 10
matter 10
in 10
simple 10
seriousness 10
he 10
thought 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
and 10
then 10
said 10
may 10
i 10
have 10
three 10
days 10
i 10
shall 10
clear 10
them 10
away 10
of 10
course 10
i 10
said 10
that 10
would 10
do 10
i 10
must 10
watch 10
him 10
junehe 10
has 10
turned 10
his 10
mind 10
now 10
to 10
spidersand 10
has 10
got 10
several 10
very 10
big 10
fellows 10
in 10
a 10
box 10
he 10
keeps 10
feeding 10
them 10
his 10
flies 10
and 10
the 10
number 10
of 10
the 10
latter 10
is 10
becoming 10
sensibly 10
diminished 10
although 10
he 10
has 10
used 10
half 10
his 10
food 10
in 10
attracting 10
more 10
flies 10
from 10
outside 10
to 10
his 10
room 10
julyhis 10
spiders 10
are 10
now 10
becoming 10
as 10
great 10
a 10
nuisance 10
as 10
his 10
flies 10
and 10
today 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
get 10
rid 10
of 10
them 10
he 10
looked 10
very 10
sad 10
at 10
this 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
some 10
of 10
them 10
at 10
all 10
events 10
he 10
cheerfully 10
acquiesced 10
in 10
this 10
and 10
i 10
gave 10
him 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
as 10
before 10
for 10
reduction 10
he 10
disgusted 10
me 10
much 10
while 10
with 10
him 10
for 10
when 10
a 10
horrid 10
blowfly 10
bloated 10
with 10
some 10
carrion 10
food 10
buzzed 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
caught 10
it 10
held 10
it 10
exultantly 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
between 10
his 10
finger 10
and 10
thumb 10
and 10
before 10
i 10
knew 10
what 10
he 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
do 10
put 10
it 10
in 10
his 10
mouth 10
and 10
ate 10
it 10
i 10
scolded 10
him 10
for 10
it 10
but 10
he 10
argued 10
quietly 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
very 10
good 10
and 10
very 10
wholesome 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
life 10
strong 10
life 10
and 10
gave 10
life 10
to 10
him 10
this 10
gave 10
me 10
an 10
idea 10
or 10
the 10
rudiment 10
of 10
one 10
i 10
must 10
watch 10
how 10
he 10
gets 10
rid 10
of 10
his 10
spiders 10
he 10
has 10
evidently 10
some 10
deep 10
problem 10
in 10
his 10
mind 10
for 10
he 10
keeps 10
a 10
little 10
notebook 10
in 10
which 10
he 10
is 10
always 10
jotting 10
down 10
something 10
whole 10
pages 10
of 10
it 10
are 10
filled 10
with 10
masses 10
of 10
figures 10
generally 10
single 10
numbers 10
added 10
up 10
in 10
batches 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
totals 10
added 10
in 10
batches 10
again 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
were 10
focussing 10
some 10
account 10
as 10
the 10
auditors 10
put 10
it 10
julythere 10
is 10
a 10
method 10
in 10
his 10
madnessand 10
the 10
rudimentary 10
idea 10
in 10
my 10
mind 10
is 10
growing 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
whole 10
idea 10
soon 10
and 10
then 10
oh 10
unconscious 10
cerebration 10
you 10
will 10
have 10
to 10
give 10
the 10
wall 10
to 10
your 10
conscious 10
brother 10
i 10
kept 10
away 10
from 10
my 10
friend 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
days 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
notice 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
any 10
change 10
things 10
remain 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
except 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
parted 10
with 10
some 10
of 10
his 10
pets 10
and 10
got 10
a 10
new 10
one 10
he 10
has 10
managed 10
to 10
get 10
a 10
sparrow 10
and 10
has 10
already 10
partially 10
tamed 10
it 10
his 10
means 10
of 10
taming 10
is 10
simple 10
for 10
already 10
the 10
spiders 10
have 10
diminshed 10
those 10
that 10
do 10
remain 10
however 10
are 10
well 10
fed 10
for 10
he 10
still 10
brings 10
in 10
the 10
flies 10
by 10
tempting 10
them 10
with 10
his 10
food 10
julywe 10
are 10
progressing 10
my 10
friend 10
has 10
now 10
a 10
whole 10
colony 10
of 10
sparrows 10
and 10
his 10
flies 10
and 10
spiders 10
are 10
almost 10
obliterated 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
he 10
ran 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
ask 10
me 10
a 10
great 10
favour 10
a 10
very 10
very 10
great 10
favour 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
fawned 10
on 10
me 10
like 10
a 10
dog 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
rapture 10
in 10
his 10
voice 10
and 10
bearing 10
a 10
kitten 10
a 10
nice 10
little 10
sleek 10
playful 10
kitten 10
that 10
i 10
can 10
play 10
with 10
and 10
teach 10
and 10
feed 10
and 10
feed 10
and 10
feed 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
unprepared 10
for 10
this 10
request 10
for 10
i 10
had 10
noticed 10
how 10
his 10
pets 10
went 10
on 10
increasing 10
in 10
size 10
and 10
vivacity 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
care 10
that 10
his 10
pretty 10
family 10
of 10
tame 10
sparrows 10
should 10
be 10
wiped 10
out 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
manner 10
as 10
the 10
flies 10
and 10
spiders 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
would 10
see 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
asked 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
rather 10
have 10
a 10
cat 10
than 10
a 10
kitten 10
his 10
eagerness 10
betrayed 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
answered 10
oh 10
yes 10
i 10
would 10
like 10
a 10
cat 10
i 10
only 10
asked 10
for 10
a 10
kitten 10
lest 10
you 10
should 10
refuse 10
me 10
a 10
cat 10
no 10
one 10
would 10
refuse 10
me 10
a 10
kitten 10
would 10
they 10
i 10
shook 10
my 10
head 10
and 10
said 10
that 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
feared 10
it 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
possible 10
but 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
see 10
about 10
it 10
his 10
face 10
fell 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
a 10
warning 10
of 10
danger 10
in 10
it 10
for 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
sudden 10
fierce 10
sidelong 10
look 10
which 10
meant 10
killing 10
the 10
man 10
is 10
an 10
undeveloped 10
homicidal 10
maniac 10
i 10
shall 10
test 10
him 10
with 10
his 10
present 10
craving 10
and 10
see 10
how 10
it 10
will 10
work 10
out 10
then 10
i 10
shall 10
know 10
more 10
pmi 10
have 10
visited 10
him 10
again 10
and 10
found 10
him 10
sitting 10
in 10
a 10
corner 10
brooding 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
he 10
threw 10
himself 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
before 10
me 10
and 10
implored 10
me 10
to 10
let 10
him 10
have 10
a 10
cat 10
that 10
his 10
salvation 10
depended 10
upon 10
it 10
i 10
was 10
firm 10
however 10
and 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
it 10
whereupon 10
he 10
went 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
gnawing 10
his 10
fingers 10
in 10
the 10
corner 10
where 10
i 10
had 10
found 10
him 10
i 10
shall 10
see 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
early 10
julyvisited 10
renfield 10
very 10
early 10
before 10
attendant 10
went 10
his 10
rounds 10
found 10
him 10
up 10
and 10
humming 10
a 10
tune 10
he 10
was 10
spreading 10
out 10
his 10
sugar 10
which 10
he 10
had 10
saved 10
in 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
was 10
manifestly 10
beginning 10
his 10
fly 10
catching 10
again 10
and 10
beginning 10
it 10
cheerfully 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
good 10
grace 10
i 10
looked 10
around 10
for 10
his 10
birdsand 10
not 10
seeing 10
themasked 10
him 10
where 10
they 10
were 10
he 10
replied 10
without 10
turning 10
round 10
that 10
they 10
had 10
all 10
flown 10
away 10
there 10
were 10
a 10
few 10
feathers 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
on 10
his 10
pillow 10
a 10
drop 10
of 10
blood 10
i 10
said 10
nothing 10
but 10
went 10
and 10
told 10
the 10
keeper 10
to 10
report 10
to 10
me 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
anything 10
odd 10
about 10
him 10
during 10
the 10
day 10
amthe 10
attendant 10
has 10
just 10
been 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
renfield 10
has 10
been 10
very 10
sick 10
and 10
has 10
disgorged 10
a 10
whole 10
lot 10
of 10
feathers 10
my 10
belief 10
is 10
doctor 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
eaten 10
his 10
birds 10
and 10
that 10
he 10
just 10
took 10
and 10
ate 10
them 10
raw 10
pmi 10
gave 10
renfield 10
a 10
strong 10
opiate 10
tonight 10
enough 10
to 10
make 10
even 10
him 10
sleep 10
and 10
took 10
away 10
his 10
pocketbook 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
it 10
the 10
thought 10
that 10
has 10
been 10
buzzing 10
about 10
my 10
brain 10
lately 10
is 10
complete 10
and 10
the 10
theory 10
proved 10
my 10
homicidal 10
maniac 10
is 10
of 10
a 10
peculiar 10
kind 10
i 10
shall 10
have 10
to 10
invent 10
a 10
new 10
classification 10
for 10
him 10
and 10
call 10
him 10
a 10
zoophagous 10
lifeeating 10
maniac 10
what 10
he 10
desires 10
is 10
to 10
absorb 10
as 10
many 10
lives 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
and 10
he 10
has 10
laid 10
himself 10
out 10
to 10
achieve 10
it 10
in 10
a 10
cumulative 10
way 10
he 10
gave 10
many 10
flies 10
to 10
one 10
spider 10
and 10
many 10
spiders 10
to 10
one 10
bird 10
and 10
then 10
wanted 10
a 10
cat 10
to 10
eat 10
the 10
many 10
birds 10
what 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
his 10
later 10
steps 10
it 10
would 10
almost 10
be 10
worth 10
while 10
to 10
complete 10
the 10
experiment 10
it 10
might 10
be 10
done 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
only 10
a 10
sufficient 10
cause 10
men 10
sneered 10
at 10
vivisection 10
and 10
yet 10
look 10
at 10
its 10
results 10
today 10
why 10
not 10
advance 10
science 10
in 10
its 10
most 10
difficult 10
and 10
vital 10
aspect 10
the 10
knowledge 10
of 10
the 10
brain 10
had 10
i 10
even 10
the 10
secret 10
of 10
one 10
such 10
mind 10
did 10
i 10
hold 10
the 10
key 10
to 10
the 10
fancy 10
of 10
even 10
one 10
lunatic 10
i 10
might 10
advance 10
my 10
own 10
branch 10
of 10
science 10
to 10
a 10
pitch 10
compared 10
with 10
which 10
burdonsandersons 10
physiology 10
or 10
ferriers 10
brain 10
knowledge 10
would 10
be 10
as 10
nothing 10
if 10
only 10
there 10
were 10
a 10
sufficient 10
cause 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
think 10
too 10
much 10
of 10
this 10
or 10
i 10
may 10
be 10
tempted 10
a 10
good 10
cause 10
might 10
turn 10
the 10
scale 10
with 10
me 10
for 10
may 10
not 10
i 10
too 10
be 10
of 10
an 10
exceptional 10
brain 10
congenitally 10
how 10
well 10
the 10
man 10
reasoned 10
lunatics 10
always 10
do 10
within 10
their 10
own 10
scope 10
i 10
wonder 10
at 10
how 10
many 10
lives 10
he 10
values 10
a 10
man 10
or 10
if 10
at 10
only 10
one 10
he 10
has 10
closed 10
the 10
account 10
most 10
accurately 10
and 10
today 10
begun 10
a 10
new 10
record 10
how 10
many 10
of 10
us 10
begin 10
a 10
new 10
record 10
with 10
each 10
day 10
of 10
our 10
lives 10
to 10
me 10
it 10
seems 10
only 10
yesterday 10
that 10
my 10
whole 10
life 10
ended 10
with 10
my 10
new 10
hope 10
and 10
that 10
truly 10
i 10
began 10
a 10
new 10
record 10
so 10
it 10
shall 10

it 10
soothes 10
me 10
to 10
express 10
myself 10
here 10
it 10
is 10
like 10
whispering 10
to 10
ones 10
self 10
and 10
listening 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
also 10
something 10
about 10
the 10
shorthand 10
symbols 10
that 10
makes 10
it 10
different 10
from 10
writing 10
i 10
am 10
unhappy 10
about 10
lucy 10
and 10
about 10
jonathan 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
heard 10
from 10
jonathan 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
and 10
was 10
very 10
concerned 10
but 10
yesterday 10
dear 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
who 10
is 10
always 10
so 10
kind 10
sent 10
me 10
a 10
letter 10
from 10
him 10
i 10
had 10
written 10
asking 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
heard 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
the 10
enclosed 10
had 10
just 10
been 10
received 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
a 10
line 10
dated 10
from 10
castle 10
dracula 10
and 10
says 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
just 10
starting 10
for 10
home 10
that 10
is 10
not 10
like 10
jonathan 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
understand 10
it 10
and 10
it 10
makes 10
me 10
uneasy 10
then 10
too 10
lucy 10
although 10
she 10
is 10
so 10
well 10
has 10
lately 10
taken 10
to 10
her 10
old 10
habit 10
of 10
walking 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
her 10
mother 10
has 10
spoken 10
to 10
me 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
we 10
have 10
decided 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
lock 10
the 10
door 10
of 10
our 10
room 10
every 10
night 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
has 10
got 10
an 10
idea 10
that 10
sleepwalkers 10
always 10
go 10
out 10
on 10
roofs 10
of 10
houses 10
and 10
along 10
the 10
edges 10
of 10
cliffs 10
and 10
then 10
get 10
suddenly 10
wakened 10
and 10
fall 10
over 10
with 10
a 10
despairing 10
cry 10
that 10
echoes 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
place 10
poor 10
dear 10
she 10
is 10
naturally 10
anxious 10
about 10
lucy 10
and 10
she 10
tells 10
me 10
that 10
her 10
husband 10
lucys 10
father 10
had 10
the 10
same 10
habit 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
get 10
up 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
dress 10
himself 10
and 10
go 10
out 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
not 10
stopped 10
lucy 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
married 10
in 10
the 10
autumn 10
and 10
she 10
is 10
already 10
planning 10
out 10
her 10
dresses 10
and 10
how 10
her 10
house 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
arranged 10
i 10
sympathise 10
with 10
her 10
for 10
i 10
do 10
the 10
same 10
only 10
jonathan 10
and 10
i 10
will 10
start 10
in 10
life 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
simple 10
way 10
and 10
shall 10
have 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
make 10
both 10
ends 10
meet 10
mr 10
holmwood 10
he 10
is 10
the 10
hon 10
arthur 10
holmwood 10
only 10
son 10
of 10
lord 10
godalming 10
is 10
coming 10
up 10
here 10
very 10
shortly 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
leave 10
town 10
for 10
his 10
father 10
is 10
not 10
very 10
well 10
and 10
i 10
think 10
dear 10
lucy 10
is 10
counting 10
the 10
moments 10
till 10
he 10
comes 10
she 10
wants 10
to 10
take 10
him 10
up 10
in 10
the 10
seat 10
on 10
the 10
churchyard 10
cliff 10
and 10
show 10
him 10
the 10
beauty 10
of 10
whitby 10
i 10
daresay 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
waiting 10
which 10
disturbs 10
her 10
she 10
will 10
be 10
all 10
right 10
when 10
he 10
arrives 10
julyno 10
news 10
from 10
jonathan 10
i 10
am 10
getting 10
quite 10
uneasy 10
about 10
him 10
though 10
why 10
i 10
should 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
but 10
i 10
do 10
wish 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
write 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
only 10
a 10
single 10
line 10
lucy 10
walks 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
each 10
night 10
i 10
am 10
awakened 10
by 10
her 10
moving 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
fortunately 10
the 10
weather 10
is 10
so 10
hot 10
that 10
she 10
cannot 10
get 10
cold 10
but 10
still 10
the 10
anxiety 10
and 10
the 10
perpetually 10
being 10
awakened 10
is 10
beginning 10
to 10
tell 10
on 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
getting 10
nervous 10
and 10
wakeful 10
myself 10
thank 10
god 10
lucys 10
health 10

suddenly 10
called 10
to 10
ring 10
to 10
see 10
his 10
father 10
who 10
has 10
been 10
taken 10
seriously 10
ill 10
lucy 10
frets 10
at 10
the 10
postponement 10
of 10
seeing 10
him 10
but 10
it 10
does 10
not 10
touch 10
her 10
looks 10
she 10
is 10
a 10
trifle 10
stouter 10
and 10
her 10
cheeks 10
are 10
a 10
lovely 10
rosepink 10
she 10
has 10
lost 10
the 10
anemic 10
look 10
which 10
she 10
had 10
i 10
pray 10
it 10
will 10
all 10
last 10
augustanother 10
week 10
gone 10
by 10
and 10
no 10
news 10
from 10
jonathan 10
not 10
even 10
to 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
from 10
whom 10
i 10
have 10
heard 10
oh 10
i 10
do 10
hope 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
ill 10
he 10
surely 10
would 10
have 10
written 10
i 10
look 10
at 10
that 10
last 10
letter 10
of 10
his 10
but 10
somehow 10
it 10
does 10
not 10
satisfy 10
me 10
it 10
does 10
not 10
read 10
like 10
him 10
and 10
yet 10
it 10
is 10
his 10
writing 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
mistake 10
of 10
that 10
lucy 10
has 10
not 10
walked 10
much 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
the 10
last 10
week 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
an 10
odd 10
concentration 10
about 10
her 10
which 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
understand 10
even 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
she 10
seems 10
to 10
be 10
watching 10
me 10
she 10
tries 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
finding 10
it 10
locked 10
goes 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
searching 10
for 10
the 10
key 10
augustanother 10
three 10
days 10
and 10
no 10
news 10
this 10
suspense 10
is 10
getting 10
dreadful 10
if 10
i 10
only 10
knew 10
where 10
to 10
write 10
to 10
or 10
where 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
i 10
should 10
feel 10
easier 10
but 10
no 10
one 10
has 10
heard 10
a 10
word 10
of 10
jonathan 10
since 10
that 10
last 10
letter 10
i 10
must 10
only 10
pray 10
to 10
god 10
for 10
patience 10
lucy 10
is 10
more 10
excitable 10
than 10
ever 10
but 10
is 10
otherwise 10
well 10
last 10
night 10
was 10
very 10
threatening 10
and 10
the 10
fishermen 10
say 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
for 10
a 10
storm 10
i 10
must 10
try 10
to 10
watch 10
it 10
and 10
learn 10
the 10
weather 10
signs 10
today 10
is 10
a 10
gray 10
dayand 10
the 10
sun 10
as 10
i 10
write 10
is 10
hidden 10
in 10
thick 10
clouds 10
high 10
over 10
kettleness 10
everything 10
is 10
gray 10
except 10
the 10
green 10
grass 10
which 10
seems 10
like 10
emerald 10
amongst 10
it 10
gray 10
earthy 10
rock 10
gray 10
clouds 10
tinged 10
with 10
the 10
sunburst 10
at 10
the 10
far 10
edge 10
hang 10
over 10
the 10
gray 10
sea 10
into 10
which 10
the 10
sandpoints 10
stretch 10
like 10
gray 10
figures 10
the 10
sea 10
is 10
tumbling 10
in 10
over 10
the 10
shallows 10
and 10
the 10
sandy 10
flats 10
with 10
a 10
roar 10
muffled 10
in 10
the 10
seamists 10
drifting 10
inland 10
the 10
horizon 10
is 10
lost 10
in 10
a 10
gray 10
mist 10
all 10
vastness 10
the 10
clouds 10
are 10
piled 10
up 10
like 10
giant 10
rocks 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
brool 10
over 10
the 10
sea 10
that 10
sounds 10
like 10
some 10
passage 10
of 10
doom 10
dark 10
figures 10
are 10
on 10
the 10
beach 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
sometimes 10
half 10
shrouded 10
in 10
the 10
mist 10
and 10
seem 10
men 10
like 10
trees 10
walking 10
the 10
fishing 10
boats 10
are 10
racing 10
for 10
home 10
and 10
rise 10
and 10
dip 10
in 10
the 10
ground 10
swell 10
as 10
they 10
sweep 10
into 10
the 10
harbour 10
bending 10
to 10
the 10
scuppers 10
here 10
comes 10
old 10
mr 10
swales 10
he 10
is 10
making 10
straight 10
for 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
by 10
the 10
way 10
he 10
lifts 10
his 10
hat 10
that 10
he 10
wants 10
to 10
talk 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
quite 10
touched 10
by 10
the 10
change 10
in 10
the 10
poor 10
old 10
man 10
when 10
he 10
sat 10
down 10
beside 10
me 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
gentle 10
way 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
say 10
something 10
to 10
you 10
miss 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
he 10
was 10
not 10
at 10
ease 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
his 10
poor 10
old 10
wrinkled 10
hand 10
in 10
mine 10
and 10
asked 10
him 10
to 10
speak 10
fully 10
so 10
he 10
said 10
leaving 10
his 10
hand 10
in 10
mine 10
im 10
afraid 10
my 10
deary 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
shocked 10
you 10
by 10
all 10
the 10
wicked 10
things 10

arms 10
devoutly 10
and 10
raised 10
his 10
hat 10
his 10
mouth 10
moved 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
were 10
praying 10
after 10
a 10

minutes 10

me 10
and 10

me 10
very 10
much 10
i 10
was 10
glad 10
when 10
the 10
coastguard 10
came 10
along 10
with 10
his 10
spyglass 10
under 10
his 10
arm 10
he 10
stopped 10
to 10
talk 10
with 10
me 10
as 10
he 10
always 10
does 10
but 10
all 10
the 10
time 10

looking 10
at 10
a 10
strange 10
ship 10
i 10
cant 10
make 10
her 10
out 10
he 10
said 10
shes 10
a 10
russian 10
by 10
the 10
look 10
of 10
her 10
but 10
shes 10
knocking 10
about 10
in 10
the 10
queerest 10
way 10
she 10
doesnt 10
know 10
her 10
mind 10
a 10
bit 10
she 10
seems 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
storm 10
coming 10
but 10
cant 10
decide 10
whether 10
to 10
run 10
up 10
north 10
in 10
the 10
open 10
or 10
to 10
put 10
in 10
here 10
look 10
there 10
again 10
she 10
is 10
steered 10
mighty 10
strangely 10
for 10
she 10
doesnt 10
mind 10
the 10
hand 10
on 10
the 10
wheel 10

unique 10

sultry 10

uncommon 10
in 10

saturday 10
evening 10
was 10
as 10
fine 10
as 10
was 10
ever 10
known 10
and 10
the 10
great 10
body 10
of 10

up 10
and 10
down 10
the 10

and 10
there 10
was 10
an 10
unusual 10
amount 10
of 10
tripping 10
both 10
to 10
and 10
from 10
whitby 10
the 10
day 10
was 10
unusually 10
fine 10
till 10
the 10
afternoon 10
when 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
gossips 10
who 10
frequent 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10

and 10
from 10
the 10
commanding 10
eminence 10
watch 10
the 10
wide 10
sweep 10
of 10
sea 10
visible 10
to 10
the 10
north 10
and 10
east 10
called 10
attention 10
to 10
a 10
sudden 10
show 10
of 10
mares 10
tails 10
high 10
in 10
the 10
sky 10
to 10
the 10
northwest 10
the 10
wind 10
was 10
then 10
blowing 10
from 10
the 10
southwest 10
in 10
the 10
mild 10
degree 10
which 10
in 10
barometrical 10

is 10
ranked 10

the 10
coastguard 10
on 10
duty 10
at 10
once 10
made 10
report 10
and 10
one 10
old 10
fisherman 10
who 10
for 10
more 10
than 10
half 10
a 10
century 10
has 10
kept 10
watch 10
on 10
weather 10
signs 10
from 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
foretold 10
in 10
an 10
emphatic 10
manner 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
a 10
sudden 10
storm 10
the 10
approach 10
of 10
sunset 10
was 10
so 10
very 10
beautiful 10
so 10
grand 10
in 10
its 10
masses 10
of 10
splendidly 10
coloured 10
clouds 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
quite 10
an 10
assemblage 10
on 10
the 10
walk 10
along 10
the 10
cliff 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
churchyard 10
to 10
enjoy 10
the 10
beauty 10
before 10
the 10
sun 10
dipped 10
below 10
the 10
black 10
mass 10
of 10
kettleness 10
standing 10
boldly 10
athwart 10
the 10
western 10
sky 10
its 10
downward 10
was 10
was 10
marked 10
by 10
myriad 10
clouds 10
of 10
every 10
sunset 10
colour 10
flame 10
purple 10
pink 10
green 10
violet 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
tints 10
of 10
gold 10
with 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
masses 10
not 10
large 10
but 10
of 10
seemingly 10
absolute 10
blackness 10
in 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
shapes 10
as 10
well 10
outlined 10
as 10
colossal 10
silhouettes 10
the 10
experience 10
was 10
not 10
lost 10
on 10
the 10
painters 10
and 10
doubtless 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
sketches 10
of 10
the 10
prelude 10
to 10
the 10
great 10
storm 10

grace 10

i 10

in 10
may 10
next 10
more 10
than 10
one 10
captain 10
made 10
up 10
his 10
mind 10
then 10
and 10
there 10
that 10
his 10
cobble 10
or 10
his 10
mule 10
as 10
they 10
term 10
the 10
different 10
classes 10
of 10
boats 10
would 10
remain 10
in 10
the 10
harbour 10
till 10
the 10
storm 10
had 10
passed 10
the 10
wind 10
fell 10
away 10
entirely 10
during 10
the 10
evening 10
and 10
at 10
midnight 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
dead 10
calm 10
a 10
sultry 10
heat 10
and 10
that 10
prevailing 10
intensity 10
which 10
on 10
the 10
approach 10
of 10
thunder 10
affects 10
persons 10
of 10
a 10
sensitive 10
nature 10
there 10
were 10
but 10
few 10
lights 10
in 10
sight 10
at 10
sea 10
for 10
even 10
the 10
coasting 10
steamers 10
which 10
usually 10
hug 10
the 10
shore 10
so 10
closely 10
kept 10
well 10
to 10
seawardand 10
but 10
few 10
fishing 10
boats 10
were 10
in 10
sight 10
the 10
only 10
sail 10
noticeable 10
was 10
a 10
foreign 10
schooner 10
with 10
all 10
sails 10
set 10
which 10
was 10
seemingly 10
going 10
westwards 10
the 10
foolhardiness 10
or 10
ignorance 10
of 10
her 10
officers 10
was 10
a 10
prolific 10
theme 10
for 10
comment 10
whilst 10
she 10
remained 10
in 10
sight 10
and 10
efforts 10
were 10
made 10
to 10
signal 10
her 10
to 10
reduce 10
sail 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
her 10
danger 10
before 10
the 10
night 10
shut 10
down 10
she 10
was 10
seen 10
with 10
sails 10
idly 10
flapping 10
as 10
she 10
gently 10
rolled 10
on 10
the 10
undulating 10
swell 10
of 10
the 10
sea 10
as 10
idle 10
as 10
a 10
painted 10
ship 10
upon 10
a 10
painted 10
ocean 10
shortly 10
before 10
ten 10
oclock 10
the 10
stillness 10
of 10
the 10
air 10
grew 10
quite 10
oppressiveand 10
the 10
silence 10
was 10
so 10
marked 10
that 10
the 10
bleating 10
of 10
a 10
sheep 10
inland 10
or 10
the 10
barking 10
of 10
a 10
dog 10
in 10
the 10
town 10
was 10
distinctly 10
heard 10
and 10
the 10
band 10
on 10
the 10
pier 10
with 10
its 10
lively 10
french 10
air 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
dischord 10
in 10
the 10
great 10
harmony 10
of 10
natures 10
silence 10
a 10
little 10
after 10
midnight 10
came 10
a 10
strange 10
sound 10
from 10
over 10
the 10
sea 10
and 10
high 10
overhead 10
the 10
air 10
began 10
to 10
carry 10
a 10
strange 10
faint 10
hollow 10
booming 10
then 10
without 10
warning 10
the 10
tempest 10
broke 10
with 10
a 10
rapidity 10
which 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
seemed 10
incredibleand 10
even 10
afterwards 10
is 10
impossible 10
to 10
realize 10
the 10
whole 10
aspect 10
of 10
nature 10
at 10
once 10
became 10
convulsed 10
the 10
waves 10
rose 10
in 10
growing 10
fury 10
each 10
overtopping 10
its 10
fellow 10
till 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
few 10
minutes 10
the 10
lately 10
glassy 10
sea 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
roaring 10
and 10
devouring 10
monster 10
whitecrested 10
waves 10
beat 10
madly 10
on 10
the 10
level 10
sands 10
and 10
rushed 10
up 10
the 10
shelving 10
cliffs 10
others 10
broke 10
over 10
the 10
piers 10
and 10
with 10
their 10
spume 10
swept 10
the 10
lanthorns 10
of 10
the 10
lighthouses 10
which 10
rise 10
from 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
either 10
pier 10
of 10
whitby 10
harbour 10
the 10
wind 10
roared 10
like 10
thunder 10
and 10
blew 10
with 10
such 10
force 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
difficulty 10
that 10
even 10
strong 10
men 10
kept 10
their 10
feet 10
or 10
clung 10
with 10
grim 10
clasp 10
to 10
the 10
iron 10
stanchions 10
it 10
was 10
found 10
necessary 10
to 10
clear 10
the 10
entire 10
pier 10
from 10
the 10
mass 10
of 10
onlookers 10
or 10
else 10
the 10
fatalities 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
would 10
have 10
increased 10
manifold 10
to 10
add 10
to 10
the 10
difficulties 10
and 10
dangers 10
of 10
the 10
time 10
masses 10
of 10
seafog 10
came 10
drifting 10
inland 10
white 10
wet 10
clouds 10
which 10
swept 10
by 10
in 10
ghostly 10
fashion 10
so 10
dank 10
and 10
damp 10
and 10
cold 10
that 10
it 10
needed 10
but 10
little 10
effort 10
of 10
imagination 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
the 10
spirits 10
of 10
those 10
lost 10
at 10
sea 10
were 10
touching 10
their 10
living 10
brethren 10
with 10
the 10
clammy 10
hands 10
of 10
death 10
and 10
many 10
a 10
one 10
shuddered 10
at 10
the 10
wreaths 10
of 10
seamist 10
swept 10
by 10
at 10
times 10
the 10
mist 10
cleared 10
and 10
the 10
sea 10
for 10
some 10
distance 10
could 10
be 10
seen 10
in 10
the 10
glare 10
of 10
the 10
lightning 10
which 10
came 10
thick 10
and 10
fast 10
followed 10
by 10
such 10
peals 10
of 10
thunder 10
that 10
the 10
whole 10
sky 10
overhead 10
seemed 10
trembling 10
under 10
the 10
shock 10
of 10
the 10
footsteps 10
of 10
the 10
storm 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
scenes 10
thus 10
revealed 10
were 10
of 10
immeasurable 10
grandeur 10
and 10
of 10
absorbing 10
interest 10
the 10
sea 10
running 10
mountains 10
high 10
threw 10
skywards 10
with 10
each 10
wave 10
mighty 10
masses 10
of 10
white 10
foam 10
which 10
the 10
tempest 10
seemed 10
to 10
snatch 10
at 10
and 10
whirl 10
away 10
into 10
space 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
a 10
fishing 10
boat 10
with 10
a 10
rag 10
of 10
sail 10
running 10
madly 10
for 10
shelter 10
before 10
the 10
blast 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
the 10
white 10
wings 10
of 10
a 10
stormtossed 10
seabird 10
on 10
the 10
summit 10
of 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
the 10
new 10
searchlight 10
was 10
ready 10
for 10
experiment 10
but 10
had 10
not 10
yet 10
been 10
tried 10
the 10
officers 10
in 10
charge 10
of 10
it 10
got 10
it 10
into 10
working 10
order 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
pauses 10
of 10
onrushing 10
mist 10
swept 10
with 10
it 10
the 10
surface 10
of 10
the 10
sea 10
once 10
or 10
twice 10
its 10
service 10
was 10
most 10
effective 10
as 10
when 10
a 10
fishing 10
boat 10
with 10
gunwale 10
under 10
water 10
rushed 10
into 10
the 10
harbour 10
able 10
by 10
the 10
guidance 10
of 10
the 10
sheltering 10
light 10
to 10
avoid 10
the 10
danger 10
of 10
dashing 10
against 10
the 10
piers 10
as 10
each 10
boat 10
achieved 10
the 10
safety 10
of 10
the 10
port 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
shout 10
of 10
joy 10
from 10
the 10
mass 10
of 10
people 10
on 10
the 10
shorea 10
shout 10
which 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
seemed 10
to 10
cleave 10
the 10
gale 10
and 10
was 10
then 10
swept 10
away 10
in 10
its 10
rush 10
before 10
long 10
the 10
searchlight 10
discovered 10
some 10
distance 10
away 10
a 10
schooner 10
with 10
all 10
sails 10
set 10
apparently 10
the 10
same 10
vessel 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
noticed 10
earlier 10
in 10
the 10
evening 10
the 10
wind 10
had 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
backed 10
to 10
the 10
east 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
shudder 10
amongst 10
the 10
watchers 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
as 10
they 10
realized 10
the 10
terrible 10
danger 10
in 10
which 10
she 10
now 10
was 10
between 10
her 10
and 10
the 10
port 10
lay 10
the 10
great 10
flat 10
reef 10
on 10
which 10
so 10
many 10
good 10
ships 10
have 10
from 10
time 10
to 10
time 10
suffered 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
wind 10
blowing 10
from 10
its 10
present 10
quarter 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
quite 10
impossible 10
that 10
she 10
should 10
fetch 10
the 10
entrance 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
nearly 10
the 10
hour 10
of 10
high 10
tide 10
but 10
the 10
waves 10
were 10
so 10
great 10
that 10
in 10
their 10
troughs 10
the 10
shallows 10
of 10
the 10
shore 10
were 10
almost 10
visible 10
and 10
the 10
schooner 10
with 10
all 10
sails 10
set 10
was 10
rushing 10
with 10
such 10
speed 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
words 10
of 10
one 10
old 10
salt 10
she 10
must 10
fetch 10
up 10
somewhere 10
if 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
in 10
hell 10
then 10
came 10
another 10
rush 10
of 10
seafog 10
greater 10
than 10
any 10
hitherto 10
a 10
mass 10
of 10
dank 10
mist 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
close 10
on 10
all 10
things 10
like 10
a 10
gray 10
pall 10
and 10
left 10
available 10
to 10
men 10
only 10
the 10
organ 10
of 10
hearing 10
for 10
the 10
roar 10
of 10
the 10
tempest 10
and 10
the 10
crash 10
of 10
the 10
thunder 10
and 10
the 10
booming 10
of 10
the 10
mighty 10
billows 10
came 10
through 10
the 10
damp 10
oblivion 10
even 10
louder 10
than 10
before 10
the 10
rays 10
of 10
the 10
searchlight 10
were 10
kept 10
fixed 10
on 10
the 10
harbour 10
mouth 10
across 10
the 10
east 10
pier 10
where 10
the 10
shock 10
was 10
expected 10
and 10
men 10
waited 10
breathless 10
the 10
wind 10
suddenly 10
shifted 10
to 10
the 10
northeast 10
and 10
the 10
remnant 10
of 10
the 10
sea 10
fog 10
melted 10
in 10
the 10
blast 10
and 10
then 10
mirabile 10
dictu 10
between 10
the 10
piers 10
leaping 10
from 10
wave 10
to 10
wave 10
as 10
it 10
rushed 10
at 10
headlong 10
speed 10
swept 10
the 10
strange 10
schooner 10
before 10
the 10
blast 10
with 10
all 10
sail 10
set 10
and 10
gained 10
the 10
safety 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
the 10
searchlight 10
followed 10
her 10
and 10
a 10
shudder 10
ran 10
through 10
all 10
who 10
saw 10
her 10
for 10
lashed 10
to 10
the 10
helm 10
was 10
a 10
corpse 10
with 10
drooping 10
head 10
which 10
swung 10
horribly 10
to 10
and 10
fro 10
at 10
each 10
motion 10
of 10
the 10
ship 10
no 10
other 10
form 10
could 10
be 10
seen 10
on 10
the 10
deck 10
at 10
all 10
a 10
great 10
awe 10
came 10
on 10
all 10
as 10
they 10
realised 10
that 10
the 10
ship 10
as 10
if 10
by 10
a 10
miracle 10
had 10
found 10
the 10
harbour 10
unsteered 10
save 10
by 10
the 10
hand 10
of 10
a 10
dead 10
man 10
however 10
all 10
took 10
place 10
more 10
quickly 10
than 10
it 10
takes 10
to 10
write 10
these 10
words 10
the 10
schooner 10
paused 10
not 10
but 10
rushing 10
across 10
the 10
harbour 10
pitched 10
herself 10
on 10
that 10
accumulation 10
of 10
sand 10
and 10
gravel 10
washed 10
by 10
many 10
tides 10
and 10
many 10
storms 10
into 10
the 10
southeast 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
pier 10
jutting 10
under 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
known 10
locally 10
as 10
tate 10
hill 10
pier 10
there 10
was 10
of 10
course 10
a 10
considerable 10
concussion 10
as 10
the 10
vessel 10
drove 10
up 10
on 10
the 10
sand 10
heap 10
every 10
spar 10
rope 10
and 10
stay 10
was 10
strainedand 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
tophammer 10
came 10
crashing 10
down 10
but 10
strangest 10
of 10
all 10
the 10
very 10
instant 10
the 10
shore 10
was 10
touched 10
an 10
immense 10
dog 10
sprang 10
up 10
on 10
deck 10
from 10
belowas 10
if 10
shot 10
up 10
by 10
the 10
concussion 10
and 10
running 10
forward 10
jumped 10
from 10
the 10
bow 10
on 10
the 10
sand 10
making 10
straight 10
for 10
the 10
steep 10
cliff 10
where 10
the 10
churchyard 10
hangs 10
over 10
the 10
laneway 10
to 10
the 10
east 10
pier 10
so 10
steeply 10
that 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
flat 10
tombstones 10
thruffsteans 10
or 10
throughstones 10
as 10
they 10
call 10
them 10
in 10
whitby 10
vernacular 10
actually 10
project 10
over 10
where 10
the 10
sustaining 10
cliff 10
has 10
fallen 10
away 10
it 10
disappeared 10
in 10
the 10
darkness 10
which 10
seemed 10
intensified 10
just 10
beyond 10
the 10
focus 10
of 10
the 10
searchlight 10
it 10
so 10
happened 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
on 10
tate 10
hill 10
pier 10
as 10
all 10
those 10
whose 10
houses 10
are 10
in 10
close 10
proximity 10
were 10
either 10
in 10
bed 10
or 10
were 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
heights 10
above 10
thus 10
the 10
coastguard 10
on 10
duty 10
on 10
the 10
eastern 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
who 10
at 10
once 10
ran 10
down 10
to 10
the 10
little 10
pier 10
was 10
the 10
first 10
to 10
climb 10
aboard 10
the 10
men 10
working 10
the 10
searchlight 10
after 10
scouring 10
the 10
entrance 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
without 10
seeing 10
anything 10
then 10
turned 10
the 10
light 10
on 10
the 10
derelict 10
and 10
kept 10
it 10
there 10
the 10
coastguard 10
ran 10
aft 10
and 10
when 10
he 10
came 10
beside 10
the 10
wheel 10
bent 10
over 10
to 10
examine 10
itand 10
recoiled 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
though 10
under 10
some 10
sudden 10
emotion 10
this 10
seemed 10
to 10
pique 10
general 10
curiosity 10
and 10
quite 10
a 10
number 10
of 10
people 10
began 10
to 10
run 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
good 10
way 10
round 10
from 10
the 10
west 10
cliff 10
by 10
the 10
drawbridge 10
to 10
tate 10
hill 10
pier 10
but 10
your 10
correspondent 10
is 10
a 10
fairly 10
good 10
runner 10
and 10
came 10
well 10
ahead 10
of 10
the 10
crowd 10
when 10
i 10
arrived 10
however 10
i 10
found 10
already 10
assembled 10
on 10
the 10
pier 10
a 10
crowd 10
whom 10
the 10
coastguard 10
and 10
police 10
refused 10
to 10
allow 10
to 10
come 10
on 10
board 10
by 10
the 10
courtesy 10
of 10
the 10
chief 10
boatman 10
i 10
was 10
as 10
your 10
correspondent 10
permitted 10
to 10
climb 10
on 10
deck 10
and 10
was 10
one 10
of 10
a 10
small 10
group 10
who 10
saw 10
the 10
dead 10
seaman 10
whilst 10
actually 10
lashed 10
to 10
the 10
wheel 10
it 10
was 10
no 10
wonder 10
that 10
the 10
coastguard 10
was 10
surprised 10
or 10
even 10
awed 10
for 10
not 10
often 10
can 10
such 10
a 10
sight 10
have 10
been 10
seen 10
the 10
man 10
was 10
simply 10
fastened 10

poor 10
fellow 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
seated 10
at 10
one 10

but 10
the 10
flapping 10
and 10
buffeting 10
of 10
the 10
sails 10
had 10
worked 10
through 10
the 10
rudder 10

the 10

had 10
dragged 10
him 10
to 10

so 10
that 10
the 10
cords 10
with 10

who 10
came 10
immediately 10
after 10
me 10
declared 10
after 10
making 10
examination 10
that 10
the 10
man 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
dead 10
for 10
quite 10
two 10
days 10
in 10
his 10
pocket 10
was 10
a 10
bottle 10
carefully 10
corked 10
empty 10
save 10
for 10
a 10
little 10
roll 10
of 10
paper 10
which 10
proved 10
to 10
be 10
the 10
addendum 10
to 10
the 10
log 10
the 10
coastguard 10
said 10
the 10
man 10
must 10
have 10
tied 10
up 10
his 10
own 10
hands 10
fastening 10
the 10
knots 10
with 10
his 10
teeth 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
a 10
coastguard 10
was 10
the 10
first 10
on 10
board 10
may 10
save 10
some 10
complications 10
later 10
on 10
in 10
the 10
admiralty 10
court 10
for 10
coastguards 10
cannot 10
claim 10
the 10
salvage 10
which 10
is 10
the 10
right 10
of 10
the 10
first 10
civilian 10
entering 10
on 10
a 10
derelict 10
already 10
however 10
the 10
legal 10
tongues 10
are 10
wagging 10
and 10
one 10
young 10
law 10
student 10
is 10
loudly 10
asserting 10
that 10
the 10
rights 10
of 10
the 10
owner 10
are 10
already 10
completely 10
sacrificed 10
his 10
property 10
being 10
held 10
in 10
contravention 10
of 10
the 10
statues 10
of 10

not 10
proof 10
of 10
delegated 10
possession 10
is 10
held 10
in 10
a 10
dead 10
hand 10
it 10
is 10
needless 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
the 10
dead 10
steersman 10
has 10
been 10
reverently 10
removed 10
from 10
the 10
place 10
where 10
he 10
held 10
his 10
honourable 10
watch 10
and 10
ward 10
till 10
death 10
a 10
steadfastness 10
as 10
noble 10
as 10
that 10
of 10
the 10
young 10

placed 10

miraculously 10
into 10

arrival 10
of 10
the 10
derelict 10
in 10
the 10
storm 10
last 10
night 10
is 10
almost 10
more 10
startling 10
than 10
the 10
thing 10
itself 10
it 10
turns 10
out 10
that 10
the 10
schooner 10
is 10
russian 10
from 10
varna 10
and 10
is 10
called 10
the 10
demeter 10
she 10
is 10
almost 10
entirely 10
in 10
ballast 10
of 10
silver 10
sand 10
with 10
only 10
a 10
small 10
amount 10
of 10
cargo 10
a 10
number 10
of 10
great 10
wooden 10
boxes 10
filled 10
with 10
mould 10
this 10
cargo 10
was 10
consigned 10
to 10
a 10
whitby 10
solicitor 10
mr 10
sf 10
billington 10
of 10
the 10
crescent 10
who 10
this 10
morning 10
went 10
aboard 10
and 10
took 10
formal 10
possession 10
of 10
the 10
goods 10
consigned 10
to 10
him 10
the 10
russian 10
consul 10
too 10
acting 10
for 10
the 10
charterparty 10
took 10
formal 10
possession 10
of 10
the 10
ship 10
and 10
paid 10
all 10
harbour 10
dues 10
etc 10
nothing 10
is 10
talked 10
about 10
here 10
today 10
except 10
the 10
strange 10
coincidence 10
the 10
officials 10
of 10
the 10
board 10
of 10
trade 10
have 10
been 10
most 10
exacting 10
in 10
seeing 10
that 10
every 10
compliance 10
has 10
been 10
made 10
with 10
existing 10
regulations 10
as 10
the 10
matter 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
a 10
nine 10
days 10
wonder 10
they 10
are 10
evidently 10
determined 10
that 10
there 10
shall 10
be 10
no 10
cause 10
of 10
other 10
complaint 10
a 10
good 10
deal 10
of 10
interest 10
was 10
abroad 10
concerning 10
the 10
dog 10
which 10
landed 10
when 10
the 10
ship 10
struck 10
and 10
more 10
than 10
a 10
few 10
of 10
the 10
members 10
of 10
the 10
spca 10
which 10
is 10
very 10
strong 10
in 10
whitby 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
befriend 10
the 10
animal 10
to 10
the 10
general 10
disappointment 10
however 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
found 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
disappeared 10
entirely 10
from 10
the 10
town 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
frightened 10
and 10
made 10
its 10
way 10
on 10
to 10
the 10
moors 10
where 10
it 10
is 10
still 10
hiding 10
in 10
terror 10
there 10
are 10
some 10
who 10
look 10
with 10
dread 10
on 10
such 10
a 10
possibility 10
lest 10
later 10
on 10
it 10
should 10
in 10
itself 10
become 10
a 10
danger 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
evidently 10
a 10
fierce 10
brute 10

this 10
morning 10

dead 10
in 10
the 10

opposite 10
its 10
masters 10
yard 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
fighting 10
and 10
manifestly 10
had 10
had 10
a 10
savage 10
opponent 10
for 10
its 10
throat 10
was 10
torn 10
away 10
and 10
its 10
belly 10
was 10
slit 10

have 10
been 10

look 10
over 10
the 10
log 10
book 10
of 10
the 10
demeter 10
which 10
was 10
in 10
order 10
up 10
to 10
within 10
three 10
days 10
but 10
contained 10
nothing 10
of 10
special 10
interest 10
except 10
as 10
to 10
facts 10
of 10
missing 10
men 10
the 10
greatest 10
interest 10
however 10
is 10
with 10
regard 10
to 10
the 10
paper 10
found 10
in 10
the 10
bottle 10
which 10
was 10
today 10
produced 10
at 10
the 10
inquest 10
and 10
a 10
more 10
strange 10
narrative 10
than 10
the 10
two 10
between 10
them 10
unfold 10
it 10
has 10
not 10
been 10
my 10
lot 10
to 10
come 10
across 10
as 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
motive 10
for 10
concealment 10
i 10
am 10
permitted 10
to 10
use 10
them 10
and 10
accordingly 10
send 10
you 10
a 10
transcript 10
simply 10
omitting 10
technical 10
details 10
of 10
seamanship 10
and 10
supercargo 10
it 10
almost 10
seems 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
captain 10
had 10
been 10
seized 10
with 10
some 10
kind 10
of 10
mania 10
before 10
he 10
had 10
got 10
well 10
into 10
blue 10
water 10
and 10
that 10

had 10
developed 10
persistently 10

expected 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
kind 10
but 10
would 10
not 10
say 10
more 10
than 10
there 10

something 10
aboard 10

to 10

in 10
an 10
awestruck 10
way 10
confided 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
thought 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
strange 10
man 10
aboard 10
the 10
ship 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
in 10
his 10
watch 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
sheltering 10
behind 10
the 10

as 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
rain 10
storm 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
a 10
tall 10
thin 10
man 10
who 10
was 10
not 10
like 10
any 10
of 10
the 10
crew 10
come 10
up 10
the 10
companionway 10
and 10
go 10
along 10
the 10
deck 10
forward 10
and 10
disappear 10
he 10
followed 10
cautiously 10
but 10
when 10
he 10
got 10
to 10
bows 10
found 10
no 10
one 10
and 10
the 10
hatchways 10
were 10
all 10
closed 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
panic 10
of 10
superstitious 10
fear 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
the 10
panic 10
may 10
spread 10
to 10
allay 10
it 10
i 10
shall 10
today 10
search 10
the 10
entire 10
ship 10
carefully 10
from 10
stem 10
to 10
stern 10
later 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
i 10
got 10
together 10
the 10
whole 10
crew 10
and 10
told 10
them 10
as 10
they 10
evidently 10
thought 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
ship 10
we 10
would 10
search 10
from 10
stem 10
to 10
stern 10
first 10
mate 10
angry 10
said 10
it 10
was 10
folly 10
and 10
to 10
yield 10
to 10
such 10
foolish 10
ideas 10
would 10
demoralise 10
the 10
men 10
said 10
he 10
would 10
engage 10
to 10
keep 10
them 10
out 10
of 10
trouble 10
with 10
the 10
handspike 10
i 10
let 10
him 10
take 10
the 10
helm 10
while 10
the 10
rest 10
began 10
a 10
thorough 10
search 10
all 10
keeping 10
abreast 10
with 10
lanterns 10
we 10
left 10
no 10
corner 10
unsearched 10
as 10
there 10
were 10
only 10
the 10
big 10
wooden 10
boxes 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
odd 10
corners 10
where 10
a 10
man 10
could 10
hide 10
men 10
much 10
relieved 10
when 10

over 10
and 10
went 10

seems 10
to 10
move 10

midnight 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
relieve 10
the 10
man 10
at 10
the 10
wheel 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
to 10
it 10
found 10
no 10
one 10
there 10
the 10
wind 10
was 10
steady 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
ran 10
before 10
it 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
yawing 10
i 10
dared 10
not 10
leave 10
it 10
so 10
shouted 10
for 10
the 10
mate 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
he 10
rushed 10
up 10
on 10
deck 10
in 10
his 10
flannels 10
he 10
looked 10
wildeyed 10
and 10
haggard 10
and 10
i 10
greatly 10
fear 10
his 10
reason 10
has 10
given 10
way 10
he 10
came 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
whispered 10
hoarsely 10
with 10
his 10
mouth 10
to 10
my 10
ear 10
as 10
though 10
fearing 10
the 10
very 10
air 10
might 10
hear 10
it 10
is 10
here 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
now 10
on 10
the 10
watch 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
like 10
a 10
man 10
tall 10
and 10
thin 10
and 10
ghastly 10
pale 10
it 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
bows 10
and 10
looking 10
out 10
i 10
crept 10
behind 10
it 10
and 10
gave 10
it 10
my 10
knife 10
but 10
the 10
knife 10
went 10
through 10
it 10
empty 10
as 10
the 10
air 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
took 10
the 10
knife 10
and 10
drove 10
it 10
savagely 10
into 10
space 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
here 10
and 10
ill 10
find 10
it 10
it 10
is 10
in 10
the 10
hold 10
perhaps 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
those 10
boxes 10
ill 10
unscrew 10
them 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
and 10
see 10
you 10
work 10
the 10
helm 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
warning 10
look 10
and 10
his 10
finger 10
on 10
his 10
lip 10
he 10
went 10
below 10
there 10
was 10
springing 10
up 10
a 10
choppy 10
wind 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
leave 10
the 10
helm 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
come 10
out 10
on 10
deck 10
again 10
with 10
a 10
tool 10
chest 10
and 10
lantern 10
and 10
go 10
down 10
the 10
forward 10
hatchway 10
he 10
is 10
mad 10
stark 10
raving 10
mad 10
and 10
its 10
no 10
use 10
my 10
trying 10
to 10
stop 10
him 10
he 10
cant 10
hurt 10
those 10
big 10
boxes 10
they 10
are 10
invoiced 10
as 10
clay 10
and 10
to 10
pull 10
them 10
about 10
is 10
as 10
harmless 10
a 10
thing 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
do 10
so 10
here 10
i 10
stay 10
and 10
mind 10
the 10
helm 10
and 10
write 10
these 10
notes 10
i 10
can 10
only 10
trust 10
in 10
god 10
and 10
wait 10
till 10
the 10
fog 10
clears 10
then 10
if 10
i 10
cant 10
steer 10
to 10
any 10
harbour 10
with 10
the 10
wind 10
that 10
is 10
i 10
shall 10
cut 10
down 10
sails 10
and 10
lie 10
by 10
and 10
signal 10
for 10
help 10
it 10
is 10
nearly 10
all 10
over 10
now 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
hope 10
that 10
the 10
mate 10
would 10
come 10
out 10
calmer 10
for 10
i 10
heard 10
him 10
knocking 10
away 10
at 10
something 10
in 10
the 10
hold 10
and 10
work 10
is 10
good 10
for 10
him 10
there 10
came 10
up 10
the 10
hatchway 10
a 10
sudden 10
startled 10
scream 10
which 10
made 10
my 10
blood 10
run 10
cold 10
and 10
up 10
on 10
the 10
deck 10
he 10
came 10
as 10
if 10
shot 10
from 10
a 10
gun 10
a 10
raging 10
madman 10
with 10
his 10
eyes 10
rolling 10
and 10
his 10
face 10
convulsed 10
with 10
fear 10
save 10
me 10
save 10
me 10
he 10
cried 10
and 10
then 10
looked 10
round 10
on 10
the 10
blanket 10
of 10
fog 10
his 10
horror 10
turned 10
to 10
despair 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
steady 10
voice 10
he 10
said 10
you 10
had 10
better 10
come 10
too 10
captain 10
before 10
it 10
is 10
too 10
late 10
he 10
is 10
there 10
i 10
know 10
the 10
secret 10
now 10
the 10
sea 10
will 10
save 10
me 10
from 10
him 10
and 10
it 10
is 10

say 10
a 10
word 10
or 10

to 10

him 10
he 10
sprang 10
on 10
the 10
bulwark 10
and 10
deliberately 10
threw 10
himself 10
into 10
the 10
sea 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
know 10
the 10
secret 10
too 10
now 10
it 10
was 10
this 10
madman 10
who 10
had 10
got 10
rid 10
of 10
the 10
men 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
and 10
now 10
he 10
has 10
followed 10
them 10
himself 10
god 10

me 10
how 10
am 10

fog 10
which 10
the 10
sunrise 10
cannot 10
pierce 10
i 10
know 10
there 10
is 10
sunrise 10
because 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
sailor 10
why 10
else 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
i 10
dared 10
not 10
go 10
below 10
i 10
dared 10
not 10
leave 10
the 10
helm 10
so 10
here 10
all 10
night 10
i 10
stayed 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
dimness 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
him 10
god 10
forgive 10
me 10
but 10
the 10
mate 10
was 10
right 10
to 10
jump 10
overboard 10
it 10
was 10
better 10
to 10
die 10
like 10
a 10
man 10
to 10
die 10
like 10
a 10
sailor 10
in 10
blue 10
water 10
no 10
man 10
can 10
object 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
captain 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
leave 10
my 10
ship 10
but 10
i 10
shall 10
baffle 10
this 10
fiend 10
or 10
monster 10
for 10
i 10
shall 10
tie 10
my 10
hands 10
to 10
the 10
wheel 10
when 10
my 10
strength 10
begins 10
to 10
fail 10
and 10
along 10
with 10
them 10
i 10
shall 10
tie 10
that 10
which 10
he 10
it 10
dare 10
not 10
touch 10
and 10
then 10
come 10
good 10
wind 10
or 10
foul 10
i 10
shall 10
save 10
my 10
soul 10
and 10
my 10
honour 10
as 10
a 10
captain 10
i 10
am 10
growing 10
weaker 10
and 10
the 10
night 10
is 10
coming 10
on 10
if 10
he 10
can 10
look 10
me 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
again 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
have 10
time 10
to 10
act 10
if 10
we 10
are 10
wrecked 10
mayhap 10
this 10
bottle 10
may 10
be 10
found 10
and 10
those 10
who 10
find 10
it 10
may 10
understand 10
if 10
not 10
well 10
then 10
all 10
men 10
shall 10
know 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
true 10
to 10
my 10
trust 10
god 10
and 10
the 10
blessed 10
virgin 10
and 10
the 10
saints 10
help 10
a 10
poor 10
ignorant 10
soul 10
trying 10
to 10
do 10
his 10
duty 10
of 10
course 10
the 10
verdict 10
was 10
an 10
open 10
one 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
evidence 10
to 10
adduce 10
and 10
whether 10
or 10
not 10
the 10
man 10
himself 10
committed 10
the 10
murders 10
there 10
is 10
now 10
none 10
to 10
say 10
the 10
folk 10
here 10
hold 10
almost 10
universally 10
that 10
the 10
captain 10
is 10
simply 10
a 10
hero 10
and 10
he 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
given 10
a 10
public 10
funeral 10
already 10
it 10
is 10
arranged 10
that 10
his 10
body 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
taken 10
with 10
a 10
train 10
of 10
boats 10
up 10
the 10
esk 10
for 10
a 10
piece 10
and 10
then 10
brought 10
back 10
to 10
tate 10
hill 10
pier 10
and 10
up 10
the 10
abbey 10
steps 10
for 10
he 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
buried 10
in 10
the 10
churchyard 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
the 10
owners 10
of 10
more 10
than 10
a 10
hundred 10
boats 10
have 10
already 10
given 10
in 10
their 10
names 10
as 10
wishing 10
to 10
follow 10
him 10
to 10
the 10
grave 10
no 10
trace 10
has 10
ever 10
been 10
found 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
dog 10
at 10
which 10
there 10
is 10
much 10
mourning 10
for 10
with 10
public 10
opinion 10
in 10
its 10
present 10
state 10
he 10
would 10
i 10
believe 10
be 10
adopted 10
by 10
the 10
town 10
tomorrow 10
will 10
see 10
the 10
funeral 10
and 10
so 10
will 10
end 10
this 10
one 10
more 10
mystery 10
of 10
the 10
sea 10
mina 10
murrays 10
journal 10
augustlucy 10
was 10
very 10
restless 10
all 10
night 10
and 10
i 10
too 10
could 10
not 10
sleep 10
the 10
storm 10
was 10
fearful 10
and 10
as 10
it 10
boomed 10
loudly 10
among 10
the 10
chimney 10
pots 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
shudder 10
when 10
a 10
sharp 10
puff 10
came 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
like 10
a 10
distant 10
gun 10
strangely 10
enough 10
lucy 10
did 10
not 10
wake 10
but 10
she 10
got 10
up 10
twice 10
and 10
dressed 10
herself 10
fortunately 10
each 10
time 10
i 10
awoke 10
in 10
time 10
and 10
managed 10
to 10
undress 10
her 10
without 10
waking 10
her 10
and 10
got 10
her 10
back 10
to 10
bed 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
very 10
strange 10
thing 10
this 10
sleepwalking 10
for 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
her 10
will 10
is 10
thwarted 10
in 10
any 10
physical 10
way 10
her 10
intention 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
any 10
disappears 10
and 10
she 10
yields 10
herself 10
almost 10
exactly 10
to 10
the 10
routine 10
of 10
her 10
life 10
early 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
we 10
both 10
got 10
up 10
and 10
went 10
down 10
to 10
the 10
harbour 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
anything 10
had 10
happened 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
there 10
were 10
very 10
few 10
people 10
about 10
and 10
though 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
bright 10
and 10
the 10
air 10
clear 10
and 10
fresh 10
the 10
big 10
grimlooking 10
waves 10
that 10
seemed 10
dark 10
themselves 10
because 10
the 10
foam 10
that 10
topped 10
them 10
was 10
like 10
snow 10
forced 10
themselves 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
mouth 10
of 10
the 10
harbour 10
like 10
a 10
bullying 10
man 10
going 10
through 10
a 10
crowd 10
somehow 10
i 10
felt 10
glad 10
that 10
jonathan 10
was 10
not 10
on 10
the 10
sea 10
last 10
night 10
but 10
on 10
land 10
but 10
oh 10
is 10
he 10
on 10
land 10
or 10
sea 10
where 10
is 10
he 10
and 10
how 10
i 10
am 10
getting 10
fearfully 10
anxious 10
about 10
him 10
if 10
i 10
only 10
knew 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
could 10
do 10
anything 10
augustthe 10
funeral 10
of 10
the 10
poor 10
sea 10
captain 10
today 10
was 10
most 10
touching 10
every 10
boat 10
in 10
the 10
harbour 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
there 10
and 10
the 10
coffin 10
was 10
carried 10
by 10
captains 10
all 10
the 10
way 10
from 10
tate 10
hill 10
pier 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
churchyard 10
lucy 10
came 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
early 10
to 10
our 10
old 10
seat 10
whilst 10
the 10
cortege 10
of 10
boats 10
went 10
up 10
the 10
river 10
to 10
the 10
viaduct 10
and 10
came 10
down 10
again 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
lovely 10
view 10
and 10
saw 10
the 10
procession 10
nearly 10
all 10
the 10
way 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
was 10
laid 10
to 10
rest 10
near 10
our 10
seat 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
stood 10
on 10
it 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
came 10
and 10
saw 10
everything 10
poor 10
lucy 10
seemed 10
much 10
upset 10
she 10
was 10
restless 10
and 10
uneasy 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
and 10
i 10
cannot 10
but 10
think 10
that 10
her 10
dreaming 10
at 10
night 10
is 10
telling 10
on 10
her 10
she 10
is 10
quite 10
odd 10
in 10
one 10
thing 10
she 10
will 10
not 10
admit 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
any 10
cause 10
for 10
restlessness 10
or 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
she 10
does 10
not 10
understand 10
it 10
herself 10
there 10
is 10
an 10
additional 10
cause 10
in 10
that 10
poor 10
mr 10
swales 10
was 10
found 10
dead 10
this 10
morning 10
on 10
our 10
seat 10
his 10
neck 10
being 10
broken 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
as 10
the 10
doctor 10
said 10
fallen 10
back 10
in 10
the 10
seat 10
in 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
fright 10
for 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
fear 10
and 10
horror 10
on 10
his 10
face 10
that 10
the 10
men 10
said 10
made 10
them 10
shudder 10
poor 10
dear 10
old 10
man 10
lucy 10
is 10
so 10
sweet 10
and 10
sensitive 10
that 10
she 10
feels 10
influences 10
more 10
acutely 10
than 10
other 10
people 10
do 10
just 10
now 10
she 10
was 10
quite 10
upset 10
by 10
a 10
little 10
thing 10
which 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
much 10
heed 10
though 10
i 10
am 10
myself 10
very 10
fond 10
of 10
animals 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
men 10
who 10
came 10
up 10
here 10
often 10
to 10
look 10
for 10
the 10
boats 10
was 10
followed 10
by 10
his 10
dog 10
the 10
dog 10
is 10
always 10
with 10
him 10
they 10
are 10
both 10
quiet 10
persons 10
and 10
i 10
never 10
saw 10
the 10
man 10
angry 10
nor 10
heard 10
the 10
dog 10
bark 10
during 10
the 10
service 10
the 10
dog 10
would 10
not 10
come 10
to 10
its 10
master 10
who 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
seat 10
with 10
us 10
but 10
kept 10
a 10
few 10
yards 10
off 10
barking 10
and 10
howling 10
its 10
master 10
spoke 10
to 10
it 10
gently 10
and 10
then 10
harshly 10
and 10
then 10
angrily 10
but 10
it 10
would 10
neither 10
come 10
nor 10
cease 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
noise 10
it 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
fury 10
with 10
its 10
eyes 10
savage 10
and 10
all 10
its 10
hair 10
bristling 10
out 10
like 10
a 10
cats 10
tail 10
when 10
puss 10
is 10
on 10
the 10
war 10
path 10
finally 10
the 10
man 10
too 10
got 10
angry 10
and 10
jumped 10
down 10
and 10
kicked 10
the 10
dog 10
and 10
then 10
took 10
it 10
by 10
the 10
scruff 10
of 10
the 10
neck 10
and 10
half 10
dragged 10
and 10
half 10
threw 10
it 10
on 10
the 10
tombstone 10
on 10
which 10
the 10
seat 10
is 10
fixed 10
the 10
moment 10
it 10
touched 10
the 10
stone 10
the 10
poor 10
thing 10
began 10
to 10
tremble 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
try 10
to 10
get 10
away 10
but 10
crouched 10
down 10
quivering 10
and 10
cowering 10
and 10
was 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
pitiable 10
state 10
of 10
terror 10
that 10
i 10
tried 10
though 10
without 10
effect 10
to 10
comfort 10
it 10
lucy 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
pity 10
too 10
but 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
attempt 10
to 10
touch 10
the 10
dog 10
but 10
looked 10
at 10
it 10
in 10
an 10
agonised 10
sort 10
of 10
way 10
i 10
greatly 10
fear 10
that 10
she 10
is 10
of 10
too 10
super 10
sensitive 10
a 10
nature 10
to 10
go 10
through 10
the 10
world 10
without 10
trouble 10
she 10
will 10
be 10
dreaming 10
of 10
this 10
tonight 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
the 10
whole 10
agglomeration 10
of 10
things 10
the 10
ship 10
steered 10
into 10
port 10
by 10
a 10
dead 10
man 10
his 10
attitude 10
tied 10
to 10
the 10
wheel 10
with 10
a 10
crucifix 10
and 10
beads 10
the 10
touching 10
funeral 10
the 10
dog 10
now 10
furious 10
and 10
now 10
in 10
terror 10
will 10
all 10
afford 10
material 10
for 10
her 10
dreams 10
i 10
think 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
best 10
for 10
her 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
tired 10
out 10
physically 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
her 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
walk 10
by 10
the 10
cliffs 10
to 10
robin 10
hoods 10
bay 10
and 10
back 10
she 10
ought 10
not 10
to 10
have 10
much 10
inclination 10
for 10
sleepwalking 10
then 10
chapter 10
mina 10
murrays 10
journal 10
same 10
day 10
oclock 10
pmoh 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
tired 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
not 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
made 10
my 10
diary 10
a 10
duty 10
i 10
should 10
not 10
open 10
it 10
tonight 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
lovely 10
walk 10
lucy 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
was 10
in 10
gay 10
spirits 10
owing 10
i 10
think 10
to 10
some 10
dear 10
cows 10
who 10
came 10
nosing 10
towards 10
us 10
in 10
a 10
field 10
close 10
to 10
the 10
lighthouse 10
and 10
frightened 10
the 10
wits 10
out 10
of 10
us 10
i 10
believe 10
we 10
forgot 10
everything 10
except 10
of 10
course 10
personal 10
fear 10
and 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
wipe 10
the 10
slate 10
clean 10
and 10
give 10
us 10
a 10
fresh 10
start 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
capital 10
severe 10
tea 10
at 10
robin 10
hoods 10
bay 10
in 10
a 10
sweet 10
little 10
oldfashioned 10
inn 10
with 10
a 10
bow 10
window 10
right 10
over 10
the 10
seaweedcovered 10
rocks 10
of 10
the 10
strand 10
i 10
believe 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
shocked 10
the 10
new 10
woman 10
with 10
our 10
appetites 10
men 10
are 10
more 10
tolerant 10
bless 10
them 10
then 10
we 10
walked 10
home 10
with 10
some 10
or 10
rather 10
many 10
stoppages 10
to 10
rest 10
and 10
with 10
our 10
hearts 10
full 10
of 10
a 10
constant 10
dread 10
of 10
wild 10
bulls 10
lucy 10
was 10
really 10
tired 10
and 10
we 10
intended 10
to 10
creep 10
off 10
to 10
bed 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
the 10
young 10
curate 10
came 10
in 10
however 10
and 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
asked 10
him 10
to 10
stay 10
for 10
supper 10
lucy 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
both 10
a 10
fight 10
for 10
it 10
with 10
the 10
dusty 10
miller 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
hard 10
fight 10
on 10
my 10
part 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
quite 10
heroic 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
some 10
day 10
the 10
bishops 10
must 10
get 10
together 10
and 10
see 10
about 10
breeding 10
up 10
a 10
new 10
class 10
of 10
curates 10
who 10
dont 10
take 10
supper 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
hard 10
they 10
may 10
be 10
pressed 10
to 10
and 10
who 10
will 10
know 10
when 10
girls 10
are 10
tired 10
lucy 10
is 10
asleep 10
and 10
breathing 10
softly 10
she 10
has 10
more 10
color 10
in 10
her 10
cheeks 10
than 10
usual 10
and 10
looks 10
oh 10
so 10
sweet 10
if 10
mr 10
holmwood 10
fell 10
in 10
love 10
with 10
her 10
seeing 10
her 10
only 10
in 10
the 10
drawing 10
room 10
i 10
wonder 10
what 10
he 10
would 10
say 10
if 10
he 10
saw 10
her 10
now 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
new 10
women 10
writers 10
will 10
some 10
day 10
start 10
an 10
idea 10
that 10
men 10
and 10
women 10
should 10
be 10
allowed 10
to 10
see 10
each 10
other 10
asleep 10
before 10
proposing 10
or 10
accepting 10
but 10
i 10
suppose 10
the 10
new 10
woman 10
wont 10
condescend 10
in 10
future 10
to 10
accept 10
she 10
will 10
do 10
the 10
proposing 10
herself 10
and 10
a 10
nice 10
job 10
she 10
will 10
make 10
of 10
it 10
too 10
theres 10
some 10
consolation 10
in 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
happy 10
tonight 10
because 10
dear 10
lucy 10
seems 10
better 10
i 10
really 10
believe 10
she 10
has 10
turned 10
the 10
corner 10
and 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
over 10
her 10
troubles 10
with 10
dreaming 10
i 10
should 10
be 10
quite 10
happy 10
if 10
i 10
only 10
knew 10
if 10
jonathan 10
god 10
bless 10
and 10
keep 10
him 10
augustdiary 10
again 10
no 10
sleep 10
now 10
so 10
i 10
may 10
as 10
well 10
write 10
i 10
am 10
too 10
agitated 10
to 10
sleep 10
we 10
have 10
had 10
such 10
an 10
adventure 10
such 10
an 10
agonizing 10
experience 10
i 10
fell 10
asleep 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
closed 10
my 10
diary 10
suddenly 10
i 10
became 10
broad 10
awake 10
and 10
sat 10
up 10
with 10
a 10
horrible 10
sense 10
of 10
fear 10
upon 10
me 10
and 10
of 10
some 10
feeling 10
of 10
emptiness 10
around 10
me 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
dark 10
so 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
lucys 10
bed 10
i 10
stole 10
across 10
and 10
felt 10
for 10
her 10
the 10
bed 10
was 10
empty 10
i 10
lit 10
a 10
match 10
and 10
found 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
not 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
shut 10
but 10
not 10
locked 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
left 10
it 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
wake 10
her 10
mother 10
who 10
has 10
been 10
more 10
than 10
usually 10
ill 10
lately 10
so 10
threw 10
on 10
some 10
clothes 10
and 10
got 10
ready 10
to 10
look 10
for 10
her 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
leaving 10
the 10
room 10
it 10
struck 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
clothes 10
she 10
wore 10
might 10
give 10
me 10
some 10
clue 10
to 10
her 10
dreaming 10
intention 10
dressinggown 10
would 10
mean 10
house 10
dress 10
outside 10
dressinggown 10
and 10
dress 10
were 10
both 10
in 10
their 10
places 10
thank 10
god 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
myself 10
she 10
cannot 10
be 10
far 10
as 10
she 10
is 10
only 10
in 10
her 10
nightdress 10
i 10
ran 10
downstairs 10
and 10
looked 10
in 10
the 10
sitting 10
room 10
not 10
there 10
then 10
i 10
looked 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
other 10
rooms 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
with 10
an 10
evergrowing 10
fear 10
chilling 10
my 10
heart 10
finally 10
i 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
and 10
found 10
it 10
open 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
wide 10
open 10
but 10
the 10
catch 10
of 10
the 10
lock 10
had 10
not 10
caught 10
the 10
people 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
are 10
careful 10
to 10
lock 10
the 10
door 10
every 10
night 10
so 10
i 10
feared 10
that 10
lucy 10
must 10
have 10
gone 10
out 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
time 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
what 10
might 10
happen 10
a 10
vague 10
overmastering 10
fear 10
obscured 10
all 10
details 10
i 10
took 10
a 10
big 10
heavy 10
shawl 10
and 10
ran 10
out 10
the 10
clock 10
was 10
striking 10
one 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
crescent 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
not 10
a 10
soul 10
in 10
sight 10
i 10
ran 10
along 10
the 10
north 10
terrace 10
but 10
could 10
see 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
which 10
i 10
expected 10
at 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
west 10
cliff 10
above 10
the 10
pier 10
i 10
looked 10
across 10
the 10
harbour 10
to 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
in 10
the 10
hope 10
or 10
fear 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
which 10
of 10
seeing 10
lucy 10
in 10
our 10
favorite 10
seat 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
bright 10
full 10
moon 10
with 10
heavy 10
black 10
driving 10
clouds 10
which 10
threw 10
the 10
whole 10
scene 10
into 10
a 10
fleeting 10
diorama 10
of 10
light 10
and 10
shade 10
as 10
they 10
sailed 10
across 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
or 10
two 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
nothing 10
as 10
the 10
shadow 10
of 10
a 10
cloud 10
obscured 10
st 10
marys 10
church 10
and 10
all 10
around 10
it 10
then 10
as 10
the 10
cloud 10
passed 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
ruins 10
of 10
the 10
abbey 10
coming 10
into 10
view 10
and 10
as 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
a 10
narrow 10
band 10
of 10
light 10
as 10
sharp 10
as 10
a 10
swordcut 10
moved 10
along 10
the 10
church 10
and 10
churchyard 10
became 10
gradually 10
visible 10
whatever 10
my 10
expectation 10
was 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
disappointed 10
for 10
there 10
on 10
our 10
favorite 10
seat 10
the 10
silver 10
light 10
of 10
the 10
moon 10
struck 10
a 10
halfreclining 10
figure 10
snowy 10
white 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
cloud 10
was 10
too 10
quick 10
for 10
me 10
to 10
see 10
much 10
for 10
shadow 10
shut 10
down 10
on 10
light 10
almost 10
immediately 10
but 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
though 10
something 10
dark 10
stood 10
behind 10
the 10
seat 10
where 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
shone 10
and 10
bent 10
over 10
it 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
whether 10
man 10
or 10
beast 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
tell 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
wait 10
to 10
catch 10
another 10
glance 10
but 10
flew 10
down 10
the 10
steep 10
steps 10
to 10
the 10
pier 10
and 10
along 10
by 10
the 10
fishmarket 10
to 10
the 10
bridge 10
which 10
was 10
the 10
only 10
way 10
to 10
reach 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
the 10
town 10
seemed 10
as 10
dead 10
for 10
not 10
a 10
soul 10
did 10
i 10
see 10
i 10
rejoiced 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
for 10
i 10
wanted 10
no 10
witness 10
of 10
poor 10
lucys 10
condition 10
the 10
time 10
and 10
distance 10
seemed 10
endless 10
and 10
my 10
knees 10
trembled 10
and 10
my 10
breath 10
came 10
laboured 10
as 10
i 10
toiled 10
up 10
the 10
endless 10
steps 10
to 10
the 10
abbey 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
gone 10
fast 10
and 10
yet 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
if 10
my 10
feet 10
were 10
weighted 10
with 10
lead 10
and 10
as 10
though 10
every 10
joint 10
in 10
my 10
body 10
were 10
rusty 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
almost 10
to 10
the 10
top 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
seat 10
and 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
now 10
close 10
enough 10
to 10
distinguish 10
it 10
even 10
through 10
the 10
spells 10
of 10
shadow 10
there 10
was 10
undoubtedly 10
something 10
long 10
and 10
black 10
bending 10
over 10
the 10
halfreclining 10
white 10
figure 10
i 10
called 10
in 10
fright 10
lucy 10
lucy 10
and 10
something 10
raised 10
a 10
head 10
and 10
from 10
where 10
i 10
was 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
a 10
white 10
face 10
and 10
red 10
gleaming 10
eyes 10
lucy 10
did 10
not 10
answer 10
and 10
i 10
ran 10
on 10
to 10
the 10
entrance 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
as 10
i 10
entered 10
the 10
church 10
was 10
between 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
seat 10
and 10
for 10
a 10
minute 10
or 10
so 10
i 10
lost 10
sight 10
of 10
her 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
view 10
again 10
the 10
cloud 10
had 10
passed 10
and 10
the 10
moonlight 10
struck 10
so 10
brilliantly 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
lucy 10
half 10
reclining 10
with 10
her 10
head 10
lying 10
over 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
seat 10
she 10
was 10
quite 10
alone 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
not 10
a 10
sign 10
of 10
any 10
living 10
thing 10
about 10
when 10
i 10
bent 10
over 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
still 10
asleep 10
her 10
lips 10
were 10
parted 10
and 10
she 10
was 10
breathing 10
not 10
softly 10
as 10
usual 10
with 10
her 10
but 10
in 10
long 10
heavy 10
gasps 10
as 10
though 10
striving 10
to 10
get 10
her 10
lungs 10
full 10
at 10
every 10
breath 10
as 10
i 10
came 10
close 10
she 10
put 10
up 10
her 10
hand 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
and 10
pulled 10
the 10
collar 10
of 10
her 10
nightdress 10
close 10
around 10
her 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
felt 10
the 10
cold 10
i 10
flung 10
the 10
warm 10
shawl 10
over 10
her 10
and 10
drew 10
the 10
edges 10
tight 10
around 10
her 10
neck 10
for 10
i 10
dreaded 10
lest 10
she 10
should 10
get 10
some 10
deadly 10
chill 10
from 10
the 10
night 10
air 10
unclad 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
wake 10
her 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
so 10
in 10
order 10
to 10
have 10
my 10
hands 10
free 10
to 10
help 10
her 10
i 10
fastened 10
the 10
shawl 10
at 10
her 10
throat 10
with 10
a 10
big 10
safety 10
pin 10
but 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
clumsy 10
in 10
my 10
anxiety 10
and 10
pinched 10
or 10
pricked 10
her 10
with 10
it 10
for 10
byandby 10
when 10
her 10
breathing 10
became 10
quieter 10
she 10
put 10
her 10
hand 10
to 10
her 10
throat 10
again 10
and 10
moaned 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
her 10
carefully 10
wrapped 10
up 10
i 10
put 10
my 10
shoes 10
on 10
her 10
feet 10
and 10
then 10
began 10
very 10
gently 10
to 10
wake 10
her 10
at 10
first 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
respond 10
but 10
gradually 10
she 10
became 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
uneasy 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
moaning 10
and 10
sighing 10
occasionally 10
at 10
last 10
as 10
time 10
was 10
passing 10
fast 10
and 10
for 10
many 10
other 10
reasons 10
i 10
wished 10
to 10
get 10
her 10
home 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
shook 10
her 10
forcibly 10
till 10
finally 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
awoke 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
surprised 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
as 10
of 10
course 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
realize 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
where 10
she 10
was 10
lucy 10
always 10
wakes 10
prettily 10
and 10
even 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
time 10
when 10
her 10
body 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
chilled 10
with 10
cold 10
and 10
her 10
mind 10
somewhat 10
appalled 10
at 10
waking 10
unclad 10
in 10
a 10
churchyard 10
at 10
night 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
lose 10
her 10
grace 10
she 10
trembled 10
a 10
little 10
and 10
clung 10
to 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
told 10
her 10
to 10
come 10
at 10
once 10
with 10
me 10
home 10
she 10
rose 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
with 10
the 10
obedience 10
of 10
a 10
child 10
as 10
we 10
passed 10
along 10
the 10
gravel 10
hurt 10
my 10
feet 10
and 10
lucy 10
noticed 10
me 10
wince 10
she 10
stopped 10
and 10
wanted 10
to 10
insist 10
upon 10
my 10
taking 10
my 10
shoes 10
but 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
however 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
to 10
the 10
pathway 10
outside 10
the 10
chruchyard 10
where 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
puddle 10
of 10
water 10
remaining 10
from 10
the 10
storm 10
i 10
daubed 10
my 10
feet 10
with 10
mud 10
using 10
each 10
foot 10
in 10
turn 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
so 10
that 10
as 10
we 10
went 10
home 10
no 10
one 10
in 10
case 10
we 10
should 10
meet 10
any 10
one 10
should 10
notice 10
my 10
bare 10
feet 10
fortune 10
favoured 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
got 10
home 10
without 10
meeting 10
a 10
soul 10
once 10
we 10
saw 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
seemed 10
not 10
quite 10
sober 10
passing 10
along 10
a 10
street 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
us 10
but 10
we 10
hid 10
in 10
a 10
door 10
till 10
he 10
had 10
disappeared 10
up 10
an 10
opening 10
such 10
as 10
there 10
are 10
here 10
steep 10
little 10
closes 10
or 10
wynds 10
as 10
they 10
call 10
them 10
in 10
scotland 10
my 10
heart 10
beat 10
so 10
loud 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
sometimes 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
should 10
faint 10
i 10
was 10
filled 10
with 10
anxiety 10
about 10
lucy 10
not 10
only 10
for 10
her 10
health 10
lest 10
she 10
should 10
suffer 10
from 10
the 10
exposure 10
but 10
for 10
her 10
reputation 10
in 10
case 10
the 10
story 10
should 10
get 10
wind 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
in 10
and 10
had 10
washed 10
our 10
feet 10
and 10
had 10
said 10
a 10
prayer 10
of 10
thankfulness 10
together 10
i 10
tucked 10
her 10
into 10
bed 10
before 10
falling 10
asleep 10
she 10
asked 10
even 10
implored 10
me 10
not 10
to 10
say 10
a 10
word 10
to 10
any 10
one 10
even 10
her 10
mother 10
about 10
her 10
sleepwalking 10
adventure 10
i 10
hesitated 10
at 10
first 10
to 10
promise 10
but 10
on 10
thinking 10
of 10
the 10
state 10
of 10
her 10
mothers 10
health 10
and 10
how 10
the 10
knowledge 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
thing 10
would 10
fret 10
her 10
and 10
think 10
too 10
of 10
how 10
such 10
a 10
story 10
might 10
become 10
distorted 10
nay 10
infallibly 10
would 10
in 10
case 10
it 10
should 10
leak 10
out 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
wiser 10
to 10
do 10
so 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
did 10
right 10
i 10
have 10
locked 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
the 10
key 10
is 10
tied 10
to 10
my 10
wrist 10
so 10
perhaps 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
be 10
again 10
disturbed 10
lucy 10
is 10
sleeping 10
soundly 10
the 10
reflex 10
of 10
the 10
dawn 10
is 10
high 10
and 10
far 10
over 10
the 10
sea 10
same 10
day 10
noonall 10
goes 10
well 10
lucy 10
slept 10
till 10
i 10
woke 10
her 10
and 10
seemed 10
not 10
to 10
have 10
even 10
changed 10
her 10
side 10
the 10
adventure 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
does 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
have 10
harmed 10
her 10
on 10
the 10
contrary 10
it 10
has 10
benefited 10
her 10
for 10
she 10
looks 10
better 10
this 10
morning 10
than 10
she 10
has 10
done 10
for 10
weeks 10
i 10
was 10
sorry 10
to 10
notice 10
that 10
my 10
clumsiness 10
with 10
the 10
safetypin 10
hurt 10
her 10
indeed 10
it 10
might 10
have 10
been 10
serious 10
for 10
the 10
skin 10
of 10
her 10
throat 10
was 10
pierced 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
pinched 10
up 10
a 10
piece 10
of 10
loose 10
skin 10
and 10
have 10
transfixed 10
it 10
for 10
there 10
are 10
two 10
little 10
red 10
points 10
like 10
pinpricks 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
band 10
of 10
her 10
nightdress 10
was 10
a 10
drop 10
of 10
blood 10
when 10
i 10
apologised 10
and 10
was 10
concerned 10
about 10
it 10
she 10
laughed 10
and 10
petted 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
even 10
feel 10
it 10
fortunately 10
it 10
cannot 10
leave 10
a 10
scar 10
as 10
it 10
is 10
so 10
tiny 10
same 10
day 10
nightwe 10
passed 10
a 10
happy 10
day 10
the 10
air 10
was 10
clear 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
bright 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
cool 10
breeze 10
we 10
took 10
our 10
lunch 10
to 10
mulgrave 10
woods 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
driving 10
by 10
the 10
road 10
and 10
lucy 10
and 10
i 10
walking 10
by 10
the 10
cliffpath 10
and 10
joining 10
her 10
at 10
the 10
gate 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
little 10
sad 10
myself 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
feel 10
how 10
absolutely 10
happy 10
it 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
had 10
jonathan 10
been 10
with 10
me 10
but 10
there 10
i 10
must 10
only 10
be 10
patient 10
in 10
the 10
evening 10
we 10
strolled 10
in 10
the 10
casino 10
terrace 10
and 10
heard 10
some 10
good 10
music 10
by 10
spohr 10
and 10
mackenzie 10
and 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
early 10
lucy 10
seems 10
more 10
restful 10
than 10
she 10
has 10
been 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
and 10
fell 10
asleep 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
shall 10
lock 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
secure 10
the 10
key 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
before 10
though 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
expect 10
any 10
trouble 10
tonight 10
augustmy 10
expectations 10
were 10
wrong 10
for 10

wakened 10
by 10
lucy 10
trying 10
to 10
get 10
out 10
she 10
seemed 10
even 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
to 10
be 10
a 10
little 10
impatient 10
at 10
finding 10
the 10
door 10
shut 10
and 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
bed 10
under 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
protest 10
i 10
woke 10
with 10
the 10
dawn 10
and 10
heard 10
the 10
birds 10
chirping 10
outside 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
lucy 10
woke 10
too 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
glad 10
to 10

better 10
than 10
on 10
the 10
previous 10
morning 10
all 10
her 10
old 10
gaiety 10
of 10
manner 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
come 10
back 10
and 10
she 10
came 10
and 10
snuggled 10
in 10
beside 10
me 10
and 10
told 10
me 10
all 10
about 10
arthur 10
i 10
told 10
her 10
how 10
anxious 10
i 10
was 10
about 10
jonathan 10
and 10
then 10
she 10
tried 10
to 10
comfort 10
me 10
well 10
she 10
succeeded 10
somewhat 10
for 10
though 10
sympathy 10
cant 10
alter 10
facts 10
it 10
can 10
make 10
them 10
more 10
bearable 10
augustanother 10
quiet 10
day 10
and 10
to 10
bed 10
with 10
the 10
key 10
on 10
my 10
wrist 10
as 10
before 10
again 10
i 10
awoke 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
found 10
lucy 10
sitting 10
up 10
in 10
bed 10
still 10
asleep 10
pointing 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
got 10
up 10
quietly 10
and 10
pulling 10
aside 10
the 10
blind 10
looked 10
out 10
it 10
was 10
brilliant 10
moonlight 10
and 10
the 10
soft 10
effect 10
of 10
the 10
light 10
over 10
the 10
sea 10
and 10
sky 10
merged 10
together 10
in 10
one 10
great 10
silent 10
mystery 10
was 10
beautiful 10
beyond 10
words 10
between 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
moonlight 10
flitted 10
a 10
great 10
bat 10
coming 10
and 10
going 10
in 10
great 10
whirling 10
circles 10
once 10
or 10
twice 10
it 10
came 10
quite 10
close 10
but 10
was 10
i 10
suppose 10
frightened 10
at 10
seeing 10
me 10
and 10
flitted 10
away 10
across 10
the 10
harbour 10
towards 10
the 10
abbey 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
lucy 10
had 10
lain 10
down 10
again 10
and 10
was 10
sleeping 10
peacefully 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
stir 10
again 10
all 10
night 10
auguston 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
reading 10
and 10
writing 10
all 10
day 10
lucy 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
become 10
as 10
much 10
in 10
love 10
with 10
the 10
spot 10
as 10
i 10
am 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
hard 10
to 10
get 10
her 10
away 10
from 10
it 10
when 10
it 10
is 10
time 10
to 10
come 10
home 10
for 10
lunch 10
or 10
tea 10
or 10
dinner 10
this 10
afternoon 10
she 10
made 10
a 10
funny 10
remark 10
we 10
were 10
coming 10
home 10
for 10
dinner 10
and 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
steps 10
up 10
from 10
the 10
west 10
pier 10
and 10
stopped 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
the 10
view 10
as 10
we 10
generally 10
do 10
the 10
setting 10
sun 10
low 10
down 10
in 10
the 10
sky 10
was 10
just 10
dropping 10
behind 10
kettleness 10
the 10
red 10
light 10
was 10
thrown 10
over 10
on 10
the 10
east 10
cliff 10
and 10
the 10
old 10
abbey 10
and 10
seemed 10
to 10
bathe 10
everything 10
in 10
a 10
beautiful 10
rosy 10
glow 10
we 10
were 10
silent 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
and 10
suddenly 10
lucy 10
murmured 10
as 10
if 10
to 10
herself 10
his 10
red 10
eyes 10
again 10
they 10
are 10
just 10
the 10
same 10
it 10
was 10
such 10
an 10
odd 10
expression 10
coming 10
apropos 10
of 10
nothing 10
that 10
it 10
quite 10
startled 10
me 10
i 10
slewed 10
round 10
a 10
little 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
see 10
lucy 10
well 10
without 10
seeming 10
to 10
stare 10
at 10
her 10
and 10
saw 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
half 10
dreamy 10
state 10
with 10
an 10
odd 10
look 10
on 10
her 10
face 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
quite 10
make 10
out 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
nothing 10
but 10
followed 10
her 10
eyes 10
she 10
appeared 10
to 10
be 10
looking 10
over 10
at 10
our 10
own 10
seat 10
whereon 10
was 10
a 10
dark 10
figure 10
seated 10
alone 10
i 10
was 10
quite 10
a 10
little 10
startled 10
myself 10
for 10
it 10
seemed 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
stranger 10
had 10
great 10
eyes 10
like 10
burning 10
flames 10
but 10
a 10
second 10
look 10
dispelled 10
the 10
illusion 10
the 10
red 10
sunlight 10
was 10
shining 10
on 10
the 10
windows 10
of 10
st 10
marys 10
church 10
behind 10
our 10
seat 10
and 10
as 10
the 10
sun 10
dipped 10
there 10
was 10
just 10
sufficient 10
change 10
in 10
the 10
refraction 10
and 10
reflection 10
to 10
make 10
it 10
appear 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
light 10
moved 10
i 10
called 10
lucys 10
attention 10
to 10
the 10
peculiar 10
effect 10
and 10
she 10
became 10
herself 10
with 10
a 10
start 10
but 10
she 10
looked 10
sad 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
it 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
thinking 10
of 10
that 10
terrible 10
night 10
up 10
there 10
we 10
never 10
refer 10
to 10
it 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
nothing 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
home 10
to 10
dinner 10
lucy 10
had 10
a 10
headache 10
and 10
went 10
early 10
to 10
bed 10
i 10
saw 10
her 10
asleep 10
and 10
went 10
out 10
for 10
a 10
little 10
stroll 10
myself 10
i 10
walked 10
along 10
the 10
cliffs 10
to 10
the 10
westward 10
and 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
sweet 10
sadness 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
thinking 10
of 10
jonathan 10
when 10
coming 10
home 10
it 10
was 10
then 10
bright 10
moonlight 10
so 10
bright 10
that 10
though 10
the 10
front 10
of 10
our 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
crescent 10
was 10
in 10
shadow 10
everything 10
could 10
be 10
well 10
seen 10
i 10
threw 10
a 10
glance 10
up 10
at 10
our 10
window 10
and 10
saw 10
lucys 10
head 10
leaning 10
out 10
i 10
opened 10
my 10
handkerchief 10
and 10
waved 10
it 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
notice 10
or 10
make 10
any 10
movement 10
whatever 10
just 10
then 10
the 10
moonlight 10
crept 10
round 10
an 10
angle 10
of 10
the 10
building 10
and 10
the 10
light 10
fell 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
there 10
distinctly 10
was 10
lucy 10
with 10
her 10
head 10
lying 10
up 10
against 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
sill 10
and 10
her 10
eyes 10
shut 10
she 10
was 10
fast 10
asleep 10
and 10
by 10
her 10
seated 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
sill 10
was 10
something 10
that 10
looked 10
like 10
a 10
goodsized 10
bird 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
she 10
might 10
get 10
a 10
chill 10
so 10
i 10
ran 10
upstairs 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
came 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
she 10
was 10
moving 10
back 10
to 10
her 10
bed 10
fast 10
asleep 10
and 10
breathing 10
heavily 10
she 10
was 10
holding 10
her 10
hand 10
to 10
her 10
throat 10
as 10
though 10
to 10
protect 10
if 10
from 10
the 10
cold 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
wake 10
her 10
but 10
tucked 10
her 10
up 10
warmly 10
i 10
have 10
taken 10
care 10
that 10
the 10
door 10
is 10
locked 10
and 10
the 10
window 10
securely 10
fastened 10
she 10
looks 10
so 10
sweet 10
as 10
she 10
sleeps 10
but 10
she 10
is 10
paler 10
than 10
is 10
her 10
wont 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
drawn 10
haggard 10
look 10
under 10
her 10
eyes 10
which 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
like 10
i 10
fear 10
she 10
is 10
fretting 10
about 10
something 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
out 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
augustrose 10
later 10
than 10
usual 10
lucy 10
was 10
languid 10
and 10
tired 10
and 10
slept 10
on 10
after 10
we 10
had 10
been 10
called 10

later 10
on 10
in 10
the 10
day 10

told 10
me 10
the 10
cause 10

grieved 10
to 10

lucy 10
as 10

but 10
she 10

some 10
one 10
to 10

poor 10
dear 10

few 10
months 10

most 10
she 10
must 10
die 10
for 10
her 10
heart 10
is 10
weakening 10
at 10
any 10
time 10
even 10
now 10
a 10
sudden 10
shock 10
would 10
be 10
almost 10
sure 10
to 10
kill 10
her 10
ah 10
we 10
were 10
wise 10
to 10
keep 10
from 10
her 10
the 10
affair 10
of 10
the 10
dreadful 10
night 10
of 10

for 10
two 10
whole 10
days 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
had 10
the 10
heart 10
to 10
write 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
shadowy 10
pall 10
seems 10
to 10
be 10
coming 10
over 10
our 10
happiness 10
no 10
news 10
from 10
jonathan 10
and 10
lucy 10
seems 10
to 10
be 10
growing 10
weaker 10
whilst 10
her 10
mothers 10
hours 10
are 10
numbering 10
to 10
a 10
close 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
understand 10
lucys 10
fading 10
away 10
as 10
she 10
is 10
doing 10
she 10
eats 10
well 10
and 10
sleeps 10
well 10
and 10
enjoys 10
the 10
fresh 10
air 10
but 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
the 10
roses 10
in 10
her 10
cheeks 10
are 10
fading 10
and 10
she 10
gets 10
weaker 10
and 10
more 10
languid 10
day 10
by 10
day 10
at 10
night 10
i 10
hear 10
her 10
gasping 10
as 10
if 10
for 10
air 10
i 10
keep 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
our 10
door 10
always 10
fastened 10
to 10
my 10
wrist 10
at 10
night 10
but 10
she 10
gets 10
up 10
and 10
walks 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
sits 10
at 10
the 10
open 10
window 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
found 10
her 10
leaning 10
out 10
when 10
i 10
woke 10
up 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
wake 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
faint 10
when 10
i 10
managed 10
to 10
restore 10
her 10
she 10
was 10
weak 10
as 10
water 10
and 10
cried 10
silently 10
between 10
long 10
painful 10
struggles 10
for 10
breath 10
when 10
i 10
asked 10
her 10
how 10
she 10
came 10
to 10
be 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
she 10
shook 10
her 10
head 10
and 10
turned 10
away 10
i 10
trust 10
her 10
feeling 10
ill 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
from 10
that 10
unlucky 10
prick 10
of 10
the 10
safetypin 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
her 10
throat 10
just 10
now 10
as 10
she 10
lay 10
asleep 10
and 10
the 10
tiny 10
wounds 10
seem 10
not 10
to 10
have 10
healed 10
they 10
are 10
still 10
open 10
and 10

before 10
and 10
the 10
edges 10
of 10
them 10
are 10
faintly 10
white 10
they 10
are 10
like 10
little 10
white 10
dots 10
with 10
red 10
centres 10
unless 10
they 10
heal 10
within 10

churchyard 10
lucy 10
is 10
ever 10
so 10
much 10
better 10
last 10
night 10
she 10
slept 10
well 10
all 10
night 10
and 10
did 10
not 10
disturb 10
me 10
once 10
the 10
roses 10
seem 10
coming 10
back 10
already 10
to 10
her 10
cheeks 10
though 10
she 10
is 10
still 10
sadly 10
pale 10
and 10
wanlooking 10
if 10
she 10
were 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
anemic 10
i 10
could 10
understand 10
it 10
but 10
she 10
is 10
not 10
she 10
is 10
in 10
gay 10
spirits 10
and 10
full 10
of 10
life 10
and 10
cheerfulness 10
all 10
the 10
morbid 10
reticence 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
passed 10
from 10
her 10
and 10
she 10
has 10
just 10
reminded 10
me 10
as 10
if 10
i 10
needed 10
any 10
reminding 10
of 10
that 10
night 10
and 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
here 10
on 10
this 10
very 10
seat 10
i 10
found 10
her 10
asleep 10
as 10
she 10
told 10
me 10
she 10
tapped 10
playfully 10
with 10
the 10
heel 10
of 10
her 10
boot 10
on 10
the 10
stone 10
slab 10
and 10
said 10
my 10
poor 10
little 10
feet 10
didnt 10
make 10
much 10
noise 10
then 10
i 10
daresay 10
poor 10
old 10
mr 10
swales 10
would 10
have 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
because 10
i 10
didnt 10
want 10
to 10
wake 10
up 10
geordie 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
communicative 10
humour 10
i 10
asked 10
her 10
if 10
she 10
had 10
dreamed 10
at 10
all 10
that 10
night 10
before 10
she 10
answered 10
that 10
sweet 10
puckered 10
look 10
came 10
into 10
her 10
forehead 10
which 10
arthur 10
i 10
call 10
him 10
arthur 10
from 10
her 10
habit 10
says 10
he 10
loves 10
and 10
indeed 10
i 10
dont 10
wonder 10
that 10
he 10
does 10
then 10
she 10
went 10
on 10
in 10
a 10
halfdreaming 10
kind 10
of 10
way 10
as 10
if 10
trying 10
to 10
recall 10
it 10
to 10
herself 10
i 10
didnt 10
quite 10
dream 10
but 10
it 10
all 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
real 10
i 10
only 10
wanted 10
to 10
be 10
here 10
in 10
this 10
spot 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
why 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
of 10
something 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
what 10
i 10
remember 10
though 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
was 10
asleep 10
passing 10
through 10
the 10
streets 10
and 10
over 10
the 10
bridge 10
a 10
fish 10
leaped 10
as 10
i 10
went 10
by 10
and 10
i 10
leaned 10
over 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
it 10
and 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
dogs 10
howling 10
the 10
whole 10
town 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
full 10
of 10
dogs 10
all 10
howling 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
i 10
went 10
up 10
the 10
steps 10
then 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
vague 10
memory 10
of 10
something 10
long 10
and 10
dark 10
with 10
red 10
eyes 10
just 10
as 10
we 10
saw 10
in 10
the 10
sunset 10
and 10
something 10
very 10
sweet 10
and 10
very 10
bitter 10
all 10
around 10
me 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
seemed 10
sinking 10
into 10
deep 10
green 10
water 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
singing 10
in 10
my 10
ears 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
heard 10
there 10
is 10
to 10
drowning 10
men 10
and 10
then 10
everything 10
seemed 10
passing 10
away 10
from 10
me 10
my 10
soul 10
seemed 10
to 10
go 10
out 10
from 10
my 10
body 10
and 10
float 10
about 10
the 10
air 10
i 10
seem 10
to 10
remember 10
that 10
once 10
the 10
west 10
lighthouse 10
was 10
right 10
under 10
me 10
and 10
then 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
agonizing 10
feeling 10
as 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
in 10
an 10
earthquake 10
and 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
and 10
found 10
you 10
shaking 10
my 10
body 10
i 10
saw 10
you 10
do 10
it 10
before 10
i 10
felt 10
you 10
then 10
she 10
began 10
to 10
laugh 10
it 10
seemed 10
a 10
little 10
uncanny 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
listened 10
to 10
her 10
breathlessly 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
quite 10
like 10
it 10
and 10
thought 10
it 10
better 10
not 10
to 10
keep 10
her 10
mind 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
so 10
we 10
drifted 10
on 10
to 10
another 10
subject 10
and 10
lucy 10
was 10
like 10
her 10
old 10
self 10
again 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
home 10
the 10
fresh 10
breeze 10
had 10
braced 10
her 10
up 10
and 10
her 10
pale 10
cheeks 10
were 10
really 10
more 10
rosy 10
her 10
mother 10
rejoiced 10
when 10
she 10
saw 10
her 10
and 10
we 10
all 10
spent 10
a 10
very 10
happy 10
evening 10
together 10
augustjoy 10
joy 10
joy 10
although 10
not 10
all 10
joy 10
at 10
last 10
news 10
of 10
jonathan 10
the 10
dear 10
fellow 10
has 10
been 10
ill 10
that 10
is 10
why 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
write 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
afraid 10
to 10
think 10
it 10
or 10
to 10
say 10
it 10
now 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
sent 10
me 10
on 10
the 10
letter 10
and 10
wrote 10
himself 10
oh 10
so 10
kindly 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
leave 10
in 10

and 10
to 10

nurse 10
him 10
if 10
necessary 10
and 10
to 10
bring 10
him 10
home 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
says 10
it 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
a 10
bad 10
thing 10
if 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
be 10
married 10

till 10

bosom 10
where 10
it 10
lies 10
it 10
is 10
of 10
jonathan 10
and 10
must 10

all 10
about 10

says 10
our 10
doctor 10
and 10
in 10
his 10
delirium 10
his 10
ravings 10
have 10
been 10
dreadful 10
of 10
wolves 10
and 10
poison 10
and 10
blood 10
of 10
ghosts 10
and 10
demons 10
and 10
i 10
fear 10
to 10
say 10
of 10
what 10
be 10
careful 10
of 10
him 10
always 10
that 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
nothing 10
to 10
excite 10
him 10
of 10
this 10
kind 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
to 10
come 10
the 10
traces 10
of 10
such 10
an 10
illness 10
as 10
his 10
do 10
not 10
lightly 10
die 10
away 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
written 10
long 10
ago 10
but 10
we 10
knew 10
nothing 10
of 10
his 10
friends 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
nothing 10
on 10
him 10
nothing 10
that 10
anyone 10
could 10
understand 10
he 10
came 10
in 10
the 10
train 10
from 10
klausenburg 10
and 10
the 10
guard 10
was 10
told 10
by 10
the 10
station 10
master 10
there 10
that 10
he 10
rushed 10
into 10
the 10
station 10
shouting 10
for 10
a 10
ticket 10
for 10
home 10
seeing 10
from 10
his 10
violent 10
demeanor 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
english 10
they 10
gave 10
him 10
a 10
ticket 10
for 10
the 10
furthest 10
station 10
on 10
the 10
way 10
thither 10
that 10
the 10
train 10
reached 10
be 10
assured 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
well 10
cared 10
for 10
he 10
has 10
won 10
all 10
hearts 10
by 10
his 10
sweetness 10
and 10
gentleness 10
he 10
is 10
truly 10
getting 10
on 10
well 10
and 10
i 10
have 10
no 10
doubt 10
will 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
weeks 10
be 10
all 10
himself 10
but 10
be 10
careful 10
of 10
him 10
for 10
safetys 10
sake 10
there 10
are 10

dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
aguststrange 10
and 10
sudden 10
change 10
in 10
renfield 10
last 10
night 10
about 10
eight 10
oclock 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
get 10
excited 10
and 10
sniff 10
about 10
as 10
a 10
dog 10
does 10
when 10
setting 10
the 10
attendant 10
was 10
struck 10
by 10
his 10
manner 10
and 10
knowing 10
my 10
interest 10
in 10
him 10
encouraged 10
him 10
to 10
talk 10
he 10
is 10
usually 10
respectful 10
to 10
the 10
attendant 10
and 10
at 10
times 10
servile 10
but 10
tonight 10
the 10
man 10
tells 10
me 10
he 10
was 10
quite 10
haughty 10
would 10
not 10
condescend 10
to 10
talk 10
with 10
him 10
at 10
all 10
all 10
he 10
would 10
say 10
was 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
to 10
talk 10
to 10
you 10
you 10
dont 10
count 10
now 10
the 10
master 10
is 10
at 10
hand 10
the 10
attendant 10
thinks 10
it 10
is 10
some 10
sudden 10
form 10
of 10
religious 10
mania 10
which 10
has 10
seized 10
him 10
if 10
so 10
we 10
must 10
look 10
out 10
for 10
squalls 10
for 10
a 10
strong 10
man 10
with 10
homicidal 10
and 10
religious 10
mania 10
at 10
once 10
might 10
be 10
dangerous 10
the 10
combination 10
is 10
a 10
dreadful 10
one 10
at 10
nine 10
oclock 10
i 10
visited 10
him 10
myself 10
his 10
attitude 10
to 10
me 10
was 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
that 10
to 10
the 10
attendant 10
in 10
his 10
sublime 10
selffeeling 10
the 10
difference 10
between 10
myself 10
and 10
the 10
attendant 10
seemed 10
to 10
him 10
as 10
nothing 10
it 10
looks 10
like 10
religious 10
mania 10
and 10
he 10
will 10
soon 10
think 10
that 10
he 10
himself 10
is 10
god 10
these 10
infinitesimal 10
distinctions 10
between 10
man 10
and 10
man 10
are 10
too 10
paltry 10
for 10
an 10
omnipotent 10
being 10
how 10
these 10
madmen 10
give 10
themselves 10
away 10
the 10
real 10
god 10
taketh 10
heed 10
lest 10
a 10
sparrow 10
fall 10
but 10
the 10
god 10
created 10
from 10
human 10
vanity 10
sees 10
no 10
difference 10
between 10
an 10
eagle 10
and 10
a 10
sparrow 10
oh 10
if 10
men 10
only 10
knew 10
for 10
half 10
an 10
hour 10
or 10
more 10
renfield 10
kept 10
getting 10
excited 10
in 10
greater 10
and 10
greater 10
degree 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
pretend 10
to 10
be 10
watching 10
him 10
but 10
i 10
kept 10
strict 10
observation 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
that 10
shifty 10
look 10
came 10
into 10
his 10
eyes 10
which 10
we 10
always 10
see 10
when 10
a 10
madman 10
has 10
seized 10
an 10
idea 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
the 10
shifty 10
movement 10
of 10
the 10
head 10
and 10
back 10
which 10
asylum 10
attendants 10
come 10
to 10
know 10
so 10
well 10
he 10
became 10
quite 10
quiet 10
and 10
went 10
and 10
sat 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
his 10
bed 10
resignedly 10
and 10
looked 10
into 10
space 10
with 10
lackluster 10
eyes 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
find 10
out 10
if 10
his 10
apathy 10
were 10
real 10
or 10
only 10
assumed 10
and 10
tried 10
to 10
lead 10
him 10
to 10
talk 10
of 10
his 10
pets 10
a 10
theme 10
which 10
had 10
never 10
failed 10
to 10
excite 10
his 10
attention 10
at 10
first 10
he 10
made 10
no 10
reply 10
but 10
at 10
length 10
said 10
testily 10
bother 10
them 10
all 10
i 10
dont 10
care 10
a 10
pin 10
about 10
them 10
what 10
i 10
said 10
you 10
dont 10
mean 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
you 10
dont 10
care 10
about 10
spiders 10
spiders 10
at 10
present 10
are 10
his 10
hobby 10
and 10
the 10
notebook 10
is 10
filling 10
up 10
with 10
columns 10
of 10
small 10
figures 10
to 10
this 10
he 10
answered 10
enigmatically 10
the 10
bride 10
maidens 10
rejoice 10
the 10
eyes 10
that 10
wait 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
bride 10
but 10
when 10
the 10
bride 10
draweth 10
nigh 10
then 10
the 10
maidens 10
shine 10
not 10
to 10
the 10
eyes 10
that 10
are 10
filled 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
explain 10
himself 10
but 10
remained 10
obstinately 10
seated 10
on 10
his 10
bed 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
remained 10
with 10
him 10
i 10
am 10
weary 10
tonight 10
and 10
low 10
in 10
spirits 10
i 10
cannot 10
but 10
think 10
of 10
lucy 10
and 10
how 10
different 10
things 10
might 10
have 10
been 10
if 10
i 10
dont 10
sleep 10
at 10
once 10
chloral 10
the 10
modern 10
morpheus 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
careful 10
not 10
to 10
let 10
it 10
grow 10
into 10
a 10
habit 10
no 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
none 10
tonight 10
i 10
have 10
thought 10
of 10
lucy 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
dishonour 10
her 10
by 10
mixing 10
the 10
two 10
if 10
need 10
by 10
tonight 10
shall 10
be 10
sleepless 10
laterglad 10
i 10
made 10
the 10
resolution 10
gladder 10
that 10
i 10
kept 10
to 10
it 10
i 10
had 10
lain 10
tossing 10
about 10
and 10
had 10
heard 10
the 10
clock 10
strike 10
only 10
twice 10
when 10
the 10
night 10
watchman 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
sent 10
up 10
from 10
the 10
ward 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
renfield 10
had 10
escaped 10
i 10
threw 10
on 10
my 10
clothes 10
and 10
ran 10
down 10
at 10
once 10
my 10
patient 10
is 10
too 10
dangerous 10
a 10
person 10
to 10
be 10
roaming 10
about 10
those 10
ideas 10
of 10
his 10
might 10
work 10
out 10
dangerously 10
with 10
strangers 10
the 10
attendant 10
was 10
waiting 10
for 10
me 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
not 10
ten 10
minutes 10
before 10
seemingly 10
asleep 10
in 10
his 10
bed 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
looked 10
through 10
the 10
observation 10
trap 10
in 10
the 10
door 10
his 10
attention 10
was 10
called 10
by 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
being 10
wrenched 10
out 10
he 10
ran 10
back 10
and 10
saw 10
his 10
feet 10
disappear 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
had 10
at 10
once 10
sent 10
up 10
for 10
me 10
he 10
was 10
only 10
in 10
his 10
night 10
gear 10
and 10
cannot 10
be 10
far 10
off 10
the 10
attendant 10
thought 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
more 10
useful 10
to 10
watch 10
where 10
he 10
should 10
go 10
than 10
to 10
follow 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
might 10
lose 10
sight 10
of 10
him 10
whilst 10
getting 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
building 10
by 10
the 10
door 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
bulky 10
man 10
and 10
couldnt 10
get 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
am 10
thin 10
so 10
with 10
his 10
aid 10
i 10
got 10
out 10
but 10
feet 10
foremost 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
only 10
a 10
few 10
feet 10
above 10
ground 10
landed 10
unhurt 10
the 10
attendant 10
told 10
me 10
the 10
patient 10
had 10
gone 10
to 10
the 10
left 10
and 10
had 10
taken 10
a 10
straight 10
line 10
so 10
i 10
ran 10
as 10
quickly 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
as 10
i 10
got 10
through 10
the 10
belt 10
of 10
trees 10
i 10
saw 10
a 10
white 10
figure 10
scale 10
the 10
high 10
wall 10
which 10
separates 10
our 10
grounds 10
from 10
those 10
of 10
the 10
deserted 10
house 10
i 10
ran 10
back 10
at 10
once 10
told 10
the 10
watchman 10
to 10
get 10
three 10
or 10
four 10
men 10
immediately 10
and 10
follow 10
me 10
into 10
the 10
grounds 10
of 10
carfax 10
in 10
case 10
our 10
friend 10
might 10
be 10
dangerous 10
i 10
got 10
a 10
ladder 10
myself 10
and 10
crossing 10
the 10
wall 10
dropped 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
side 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
renfields 10
figure 10
just 10
disappearing 10
behind 10
the 10
angle 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
so 10
i 10
ran 10
after 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
far 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
pressed 10
close 10
against 10
the 10
old 10
ironbound 10
oak 10
door 10
of 10
the 10
chapel 10
he 10
was 10
talking 10
apparently 10
to 10
some 10
one 10
but 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
to 10
go 10
near 10
enough 10
to 10
hear 10
what 10
he 10
was 10
saying 10
les 10
t 10
i 10
might 10
frighten 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
should 10
run 10
off 10
chasing 10
an 10
errant 10
swarm 10
of 10
bees 10
is 10
nothing 10
to 10
following 10
a 10
naked 10
lunatic 10
when 10
the 10
fit 10
of 10
escaping 10
is 10
upon 10
him 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
however 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
take 10
note 10
of 10
anything 10
around 10
him 10
and 10
so 10
ventured 10
to 10
draw 10
nearer 10
to 10
him 10
the 10
more 10
so 10
as 10
my 10
men 10
had 10
now 10
crossed 10
the 10
wall 10
and 10
were 10
closing 10
him 10
in 10
i 10
heard 10
him 10
say 10
i 10
am 10
here 10
to 10
do 10
your 10
bidding 10
master 10
i 10
am 10
your 10
slave 10
and 10
you 10
will 10
reward 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
faithful 10
i 10
have 10
worshipped 10
you 10
long 10
and 10
afar 10
off 10
now 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
near 10
i 10
await 10
your 10
commands 10
and 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
pass 10
me 10
by 10
will 10
you 10
dear 10
master 10
in 10
your 10
distribution 10
of 10
good 10
things 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
selfish 10
old 10
beggar 10
anyhow 10
he 10
thinks 10
of 10
the 10
loaves 10
and 10
fishes 10
even 10
when 10
he 10
believes 10
his 10
is 10
in 10
a 10
real 10
presence 10
his 10
manias 10
make 10
a 10
startling 10
combination 10
when 10
we 10
closed 10
in 10
on 10
him 10
he 10
fought 10
like 10
a 10
tiger 10
he 10
is 10
immensely 10
strong 10
for 10
he 10
was 10
more 10
like 10
a 10
wild 10
beast 10
than 10
a 10
man 10
i 10
never 10
saw 10
a 10
lunatic 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
paroxysm 10
of 10
rage 10
before 10
and 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
again 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
mercy 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
found 10
out 10
his 10
strength 10
and 10
his 10
danger 10
in 10
good 10
time 10
with 10
strength 10
and 10
determination 10
like 10
his 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
done 10
wild 10
work 10
before 10
he 10
was 10
caged 10
he 10
is 10
safe 10
now 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
jack 10
sheppard 10
himself 10
couldnt 10
get 10
free 10
from 10
the 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
that 10
keeps 10
him 10
restrained 10
and 10
hes 10
chained 10
to 10
the 10
wall 10
in 10
the 10
padded 10
room 10
his 10
cries 10
are 10
at 10
times 10
awful 10
but 10
the 10
silences 10
that 10
follow 10
are 10
more 10
deadly 10
still 10
for 10
he 10
means 10
murder 10
in 10
every 10
turn 10
and 10
movement 10
just 10
now 10
he 10
spoke 10
coherent 10
words 10
for 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
patient 10
master 10
it 10
is 10
coming 10
coming 10
coming 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
hint 10
and 10
came 10
too 10
i 10
was 10
too 10
excited 10
to 10
sleep 10
but 10
this 10
diary 10
has 10
quieted 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
feel 10
i 10
shall 10
get 10
some 10
sleep 10

august 10
my 10
dearest 10
lucy 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
will 10
be 10
anxious 10
to 10
hear 10
all 10
that 10
has 10
happened 10
since 10
we 10
parted 10
at 10
the 10
railway 10
station 10
at 10
whitby 10
well 10
my 10
dear 10
i 10
got 10
to 10
hull 10
all 10
right 10
and 10
caught 10
the 10
boat 10
to 10
hamburg 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
train 10
on 10
here 10
i 10
feel 10
that 10
i 10
can 10
hardly 10
recall 10
anything 10
of 10
the 10
journey 10
except 10
that 10
i 10
knew 10
i 10
was 10
coming 10
to 10
jonathan 10
and 10
that 10
as 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
to 10
do 10
some 10
nursing 10
i 10
had 10
better 10
get 10
all 10
the 10
sleep 10
i 10
could 10
i 10
found 10
my 10
dear 10
one 10
oh 10
so 10
thin 10
and 10
pale 10
and 10
weaklooking 10
all 10
the 10
resolution 10
has 10
gone 10
out 10
of 10
his 10
dear 10
eyes 10
and 10
that 10
quiet 10
dignity 10
which 10
i 10
told 10
you 10
was 10
in 10
his 10
face 10
has 10
vanished 10
he 10
is 10
only 10
a 10
wreck 10
of 10
himself 10
and 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
remember 10
anything 10
that 10
has 10
happened 10
to 10
him 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
past 10
at 10
least 10
he 10
wants 10
me 10
to 10
believe 10
so 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
ask 10
he 10
has 10
had 10
some 10
terrible 10
shock 10
and 10
i 10
fear 10
it 10
might 10
tax 10
his 10
poor 10
brain 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
recall 10
it 10
sister 10
agatha 10
who 10
is 10
a 10
good 10
creature 10
and 10
a 10
born 10
nurse 10
tells 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
wanted 10
her 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
what 10
they 10
were 10
but 10
she 10
would 10
only 10
cross 10
herself 10
and 10
say 10
she 10
would 10
never 10
tell 10
that 10
the 10
ravings 10
of 10
the 10
sick 10
were 10
the 10
secrets 10
of 10
god 10
and 10
that 10
if 10
a 10
nurse 10
through 10
her 10
vocation 10
should 10
hear 10
them 10
she 10
should 10
respect 10
her 10
trust 10
she 10
is 10
a 10
sweet 10
good 10
soul 10
and 10
the 10
next 10
day 10
when 10
she 10
saw 10
i 10
was 10
troubled 10
she 10
opened 10
up 10
the 10
subject 10
my 10
poor 10
dear 10
raved 10
about 10
added 10
i 10
can 10
tell 10
you 10
this 10
much 10
my 10
dear 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
about 10
anything 10
which 10
he 10
has 10
done 10
wrong 10
himself 10
and 10
you 10
as 10
his 10
wife 10
to 10
be 10
have 10
no 10
cause 10
to 10
be 10
concerned 10
he 10
has 10
not 10
forgotten 10
you 10
or 10
what 10
he 10
owes 10
to 10
you 10
his 10
fear 10
was 10
of 10
great 10
and 10
terrible 10
things 10
which 10
no 10
mortal 10
can 10
treat 10
of 10
i 10
do 10
believe 10
the 10
dear 10
soul 10
thought 10
i 10
might 10
be 10
jealous 10
lest 10
my 10
poor 10
dear 10
should 10
have 10
fallen 10
in 10
love 10
with 10
any 10
other 10
girl 10
the 10
idea 10
of 10
my 10
being 10
jealous 10
about 10
jonathan 10
and 10
yet 10
my 10
dear 10
let 10
me 10
whisper 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
thrill 10
of 10
joy 10
through 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
no 10
other 10
woman 10
was 10
a 10
cause 10
for 10
trouble 10
i 10
am 10
now 10
sitting 10
by 10
his 10
bedside 10
where 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
his 10
face 10
while 10
he 10
sleeps 10
he 10
is 10
waking 10
when 10
he 10
woke 10
he 10
asked 10
me 10
for 10
his 10
coat 10
as 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
get 10
something 10
from 10
the 10
pocket 10
i 10
asked 10
sister 10
agatha 10
and 10
she 10
brought 10
all 10
his 10
things 10
i 10
saw 10
amongst 10
them 10
was 10
his 10
notebook 10
and 10
was 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
ask 10
him 10
to 10
let 10
me 10
look 10
at 10
it 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
find 10
some 10
clue 10
to 10
his 10
trouble 10
but 10
i 10
suppose 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
seen 10
my 10
wish 10
in 10
my 10
eyes 10
for 10
he 10
sent 10
me 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
saying 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
be 10
quite 10
alone 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
then 10
he 10
called 10
me 10
back 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
very 10
solemnly 10
wilhelmina 10
i 10
knew 10
then 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
deadly 10
earnest 10
for 10
he 10
has 10
never 10
called 10
me 10
by 10
that 10
name 10
since 10
he 10
asked 10
me 10
to 10
marry 10
him 10
you 10
know 10
dear 10
my 10
ideas 10
of 10
the 10
trust 10
between 10
husband 10
and 10
wife 10
there 10
should 10
be 10
no 10
secret 10
no 10
concealment 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
great 10
shock 10
and 10

with 10

and 10
strong 10
i 10
could 10

speak 10
my 10
heart 10
was 10
so 10
full 10
that 10

those 10
words 10
seemed 10
to 10
choke 10
me 10

me 10
i 10
must 10
tell 10
you 10
of 10
my 10
wedding 10
present 10
when 10
the 10
chaplain 10
and 10
the 10
sisters 10
had 10
left 10
me 10
alone 10
with 10
my 10
husband 10
oh 10
lucy 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
i 10
have 10
written 10
the 10
words 10
my 10
husband 10
left 10
me 10
alone 10
with 10
my 10
husband 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
book 10
from 10
under 10
his 10
pillow 10
and 10
wrapped 10
it 10
up 10
in 10
white 10
paper 10
and 10
tied 10
it 10
with 10
a 10
little 10
bit 10
of 10
pale 10
blue 10
ribbon 10
which 10
was 10
round 10
my 10
neck 10
and 10
sealed 10
it 10
over 10
the 10
knot 10
with 10
sealing 10
wax 10
and 10
for 10
my 10
seal 10
i 10
used 10
my 10
wedding 10
ring 10
then 10
i 10
kissed 10
it 10
and 10
showed 10
it 10
to 10
my 10
husband 10
and 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
keep 10
it 10
so 10
and 10
then 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
an 10
outward 10
and 10
visible 10
sign 10
for 10
us 10
all 10
our 10
lives 10
that 10
we 10
trusted 10
each 10
other 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
never 10
open 10
it 10
unless 10
it 10
were 10
for 10
his 10
own 10
dear 10
sake 10
or 10
for 10
the 10
sake 10
of 10
some 10
stern 10
duty 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
oh 10
lucy 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
he 10
took 10
his 10
wifes 10
hand 10
and 10
said 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
dearest 10
thing 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
wide 10
world 10
and 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
go 10
through 10
all 10
the 10
past 10
again 10
to 10
win 10
it 10
if 10
need 10
be 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
meant 10
to 10
have 10
said 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
past 10
but 10
he 10
cannot 10
think 10
of 10
time 10
yet 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
wonder 10
if 10
at 10
first 10
he 10
mixes 10
up 10
not 10
only 10
the 10
month 10
but 10
the 10
year 10
well 10
my 10
dear 10
could 10
i 10
say 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
the 10
happiest 10
woman 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
wide 10
world 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
nothing 10
to 10
give 10
him 10
except 10
myself 10
my 10
life 10
and 10
my 10
trust 10
and 10
that 10
with 10
these 10
went 10
my 10
love 10
and 10
duty 10
for 10
all 10
the 10
days 10
of 10
my 10
life 10
and 10
my 10
dear 10
when 10
he 10
kissed 10
me 10
and 10
drew 10
me 10
to 10
him 10
with 10
his 10
poor 10
weak 10
hands 10
it 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
solemn 10
pledge 10
between 10
us 10

i 10
have 10
not 10
stirred 10
out 10
of 10
my 10
bed 10
for 10
a 10
week 10
that 10
is 10
when 10
i 10
once 10
got 10
into 10
it 10
at 10
night 10
arthur 10
says 10
i 10
am 10
getting 10
fat 10
by 10
the 10
way 10
i 10
forgot 10
to 10
tell 10
you 10
that 10
arthur 10
is 10
here 10
we 10
have 10
such 10
walks 10
and 10
drives 10
and 10
rides 10
and 10
rowing 10
and 10
tennis 10
and 10
fishing 10
together 10
and 10
i 10
love 10
him 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
he 10
tells 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
loves 10
me 10
more 10
but 10
i 10
doubt 10
that 10
for 10
at 10
first 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
couldnt 10
love 10
me 10
more 10
than 10
he 10
did 10
then 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
nonsense 10
there 10
he 10
is 10
calling 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
no 10
more 10
just 10
at 10
present 10
from 10

augustthe 10
case 10
of 10
renfield 10
grows 10
even 10
more 10
interesting 10
he 10
has 10
now 10
so 10
far 10
quieted 10
that 10
there 10
are 10
spells 10
of 10
cessation 10
from 10
his 10
passion 10
for 10
the 10
first 10
week 10
after 10
his 10
attack 10
he 10
was 10
perpetually 10
violent 10
then 10
one 10
night 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
moon 10
rose 10
he 10
grew 10
quiet 10
and 10
kept 10
murmuring 10
to 10
himself 10
now 10
i 10
can 10
wait 10
now 10
i 10
can 10
wait 10
the 10
attendant 10
came 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
so 10
i 10
ran 10
down 10
at 10
once 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
look 10
at 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
still 10
in 10
the 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
padded 10
room 10
but 10
the 10
suffused 10
look 10
had 10
gone 10
from 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
had 10
something 10
of 10
their 10
old 10
pleading 10
i 10
might 10
almost 10
say 10
cringing 10
softness 10
i 10
was 10
satisfied 10
with 10
his 10
present 10
condition 10
and 10
directed 10
him 10
to 10
be 10
relieved 10
the 10
attendants 10
hesitated 10
but 10
finally 10
carried 10
out 10
my 10
wishes 10
without 10
protest 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
strange 10
thing 10
that 10
the 10
patient 10
had 10
humour 10
enough 10
to 10
see 10
their 10
distrust 10
for 10
coming 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
whisper 10
all 10
the 10
while 10
looking 10
furtively 10
at 10
them 10
they 10
think 10
i 10
could 10
hurt 10
you 10
fancy 10
me 10
hurting 10
you 10
the 10
fools 10
it 10
was 10
soothing 10
somehow 10
to 10
the 10
feelings 10
to 10
find 10
myself 10
disassociated 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
mind 10
of 10
this 10
poor 10
madman 10
from 10
the 10
others 10
but 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
follow 10
his 10
thought 10

i 10
to 10
take 10
it 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
anything 10
in 10
common 10
with 10
him 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
as 10
it 10
were 10
to 10
stand 10
together 10
or 10
has 10
he 10
to 10
gain 10
from 10
me 10
some 10
good 10
so 10
stupendous 10
that 10
my 10
well 10
being 10
is 10
needful 10
to 10
him 10
i 10
must 10
find 10
out 10
later 10
on 10
tonight 10
he 10
will 10
not 10
speak 10
even 10
the 10
offer 10
of 10
a 10
kitten 10
or 10
even 10
a 10
fullgrown 10
cat 10
will 10
not 10
tempt 10
him 10
he 10
will 10
only 10
say 10
i 10
dont 10
take 10
any 10
stock 10
in 10
cats 10
i 10
have 10
more 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
now 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
wait 10
i 10
can 10
wait 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
i 10
left 10
him 10
the 10
attendant 10
tells 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
quiet 10
until 10
just 10
before 10
dawn 10
and 10
that 10
then 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
get 10
uneasy 10
and 10
at 10
length 10
violent 10
until 10
at 10
last 10
he 10
fell 10
into 10
a 10
paroxysm 10
which 10
exhausted 10
him 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
swooned 10
into 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
coma 10
three 10
nights 10
has 10
the 10
same 10
thing 10
happened 10
violent 10
all 10
day 10
then 10
quiet 10
from 10
moonrise 10
to 10
sunrise 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
some 10
clue 10
to 10
the 10
cause 10
it 10
would 10
almost 10
seem 10
as 10
if 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
influence 10
which 10
came 10
and 10
went 10
happy 10
thought 10
we 10
shall 10
tonight 10
play 10
sane 10
wits 10
against 10
mad 10
ones 10
he 10
escaped 10
before 10
without 10
our 10
help 10
tonight 10
he 10
shall 10
escape 10
with 10
it 10
we 10
shall 10
give 10
him 10
a 10
chance 10
and 10
have 10
the 10
men 10
ready 10
to 10
follow 10
in 10

bird 10
when 10
he 10
found 10
the 10
cage 10
open 10

were 10
for 10
nought 10
at 10
any 10

merely 10
to 10
shut 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
padded 10
room 10
when 10
once 10
he 10
is 10
quiet 10
until 10
the 10
hour 10
before 10
sunrise 10
the 10
poor 10
souls 10
body 10
will 10
enjoy 10
the 10
relief 10
even 10
if 10
his 10

artfully 10
waited 10
until 10
the 10
attendant 10
was 10
entering 10
the 10
room 10
to 10
inspect 10
then 10
he 10
dashed 10
out 10
past 10
him 10
and 10
flew 10
down 10
the 10
passage 10
i 10
sent 10
word 10
for 10
the 10
attendants 10
to 10
follow 10
again 10
he 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
grounds 10
of 10
the 10
deserted 10
house 10
and 10
we 10
found 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
place 10
pressed 10
against 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
door 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
he 10
became 10
furious 10
and 10
had 10
not 10
the 10
attendants 10
seized 10
him 10
in 10
time 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
kill 10
me 10
as 10
we 10
sere 10
holding 10
him 10
a 10
strange 10
thing 10
happened 10
he 10
suddenly 10
redoubled 10
his 10
efforts 10
and 10
then 10
as 10
suddenly 10
grew 10
calm 10
i 10
looked 10
round 10
instinctively 10
but 10
could 10
see 10
nothing 10
then 10
i 10
caught 10
the 10
patients 10
eye 10
and 10
followed 10
it 10
but 10
could 10
trace 10
nothing 10
as 10
it 10
looked 10
into 10
the 10
moonlight 10
sky 10
except 10
a 10
big 10
bat 10
which 10
was 10
flapping 10
its 10
silent 10
and 10
ghostly 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
west 10
bats 10
usually 10
wheel 10
about 10
but 10
this 10
one 10
seemed 10
to 10
go 10
straight 10
on 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
knew 10
where 10
it 10
was 10
bound 10
for 10
or 10
had 10
some 10
intention 10
of 10
its 10
own 10
the 10
patient 10
grew 10
calmer 10
every 10
instant 10
and 10
presently 10
said 10
you 10
neednt 10
tie 10
me 10
i 10
shall 10
go 10
quietly 10
without 10
trouble 10
we 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
feel 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
ominous 10
in 10
his 10
calm 10
and 10
shall 10
not 10
forget 10
this 10
night 10

down 10

we 10
can 10
have 10
long 10
talks 10
when 10
we 10
do 10
meet 10
i 10
wonder 10
when 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
i 10
wish 10
she 10
were 10
with 10
me 10
again 10
for 10
i 10
feel 10
so 10
unhappy 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
dreaming 10
again 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
at 10
whitby 10
perhaps 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
change 10
of 10
air 10
or 10
getting 10
home 10
again 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
dark 10
and 10
horrid 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
can 10
remember 10
nothing 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
full 10
of 10
vague 10
fear 10
and 10
i 10
feel 10
so 10
weak 10
and 10
worn 10
out 10
when 10
arthur 10
came 10
to 10
lunch 10
he 10
looked 10
quite 10
grieved 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
hadnt 10
the 10
spirit 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
be 10
cheerful 10
i 10
wonder 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
sleep 10
in 10
mothers 10
room 10
tonight 10
i 10
shall 10
make 10
an 10
excuse 10
to 10

augustanother 10
bad 10
night 10
mother 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
take 10
to 10
my 10
proposal 10
she 10
seems 10
not 10
too 10
well 10
herself 10
and 10
doubtless 10
she 10
fears 10
to 10
worry 10
me 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
keep 10
awake 10
and 10
succeeded 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
but 10
when 10
the 10
clock 10
struck 10
twelve 10
it 10
waked 10
me 10
from 10
a 10
doze 10
so 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
falling 10
asleep 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
scratching 10
or 10
flapping 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
mind 10
it 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
remember 10
no 10
more 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
fallen 10
asleep 10
more 10
bad 10
dreams 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10

remember 10
them 10
this 10
morning 10
i 10
am 10
horribly 10
weak 10
my 10
face 10
is 10
ghastly 10
pale 10
and 10
my 10
throat 10
pains 10
me 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
something 10
wrong 10
with 10
my 10
lungs 10
for 10
i 10
dont 10
seem 10
to 10

enough 10
i 10

try 10
to 10

when 10

worse 10

you 10
know 10
at 10
once 10
that 10
in 10
my 10
opinion 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
any 10
functal 10
disturbance 10
or 10
any 10
malady 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
of 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
by 10
any 10
means 10
satisfied 10
with 10
her 10
appearance 10
she 10
is 10
woefully 10
different 10
from 10
what 10
she 10
was 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
her 10
last 10
of 10
course 10
you 10
must 10
bear 10
in 10
mind 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
have 10
full 10
opportunity 10
of 10
examination 10
such 10
as 10
i 10
should 10
wish 10
our 10
very 10
friendship 10
makes 10
a 10
little 10
difficulty 10
which 10
not 10
even 10
medical 10
science 10
or 10
custom 10
can 10
bridge 10
over 10
i 10
had 10
better 10
tell 10
you 10
exactly 10
what 10
happened 10
leaving 10
you 10
to 10
draw 10
in 10
a 10
measure 10
your 10
own 10
conclusions 10
i 10
shall 10
then 10
say 10
what 10
i 10
have 10
done 10
and 10
propose 10
doing 10
i 10
found 10
miss 10
westenra 10
in 10
seemingly 10
gay 10
spirits 10
her 10
mother 10
was 10
present 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
i 10
made 10
up 10
my 10
mind 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
trying 10
all 10
she 10
knew 10
to 10
mislead 10
her 10
mother 10
and 10
prevent 10
her 10
from 10
being 10
anxious 10
i 10
have 10
no 10
doubt 10
she 10
guesses 10
if 10
she 10
does 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
need 10
of 10
caution 10
there 10
is 10
we 10
lunched 10
alone 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
all 10
exerted 10
ourselves 10
to 10
be 10
cheerful 10
we 10
got 10
as 10
some 10
kind 10
of 10
reward 10
for 10
our 10
labours 10
some 10
real 10
cheerfulness 10
amongst 10
us 10
then 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
went 10
to 10
lie 10
down 10
and 10
lucy 10
was 10
left 10
with 10
me 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
her 10
boudoir 10
and 10
till 10
we 10
got 10
there 10
her 10
gaiety 10
remained 10
for 10
the 10
servants 10
were 10
coming 10
and 10
going 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
closed 10
however 10
the 10
mask 10
fell 10
from 10
her 10
face 10
and 10
she 10
sank 10
down 10
into 10
a 10
chair 10
with 10
a 10
great 10
sigh 10
and 10
hid 10
her 10
eyes 10
with 10
her 10
hand 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
her 10
high 10
spirits 10
had 10
failed 10
i 10
at 10
once 10
took 10
advantage 10
of 10
her 10
reaction 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
diagnosis 10
she 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
very 10
sweetly 10
i 10
cannot 10
tell 10
you 10
how 10
i 10
loathe 10
talking 10
about 10
myself 10
i 10
reminded 10
her 10
that 10
a 10
doctors 10
confidence 10
was 10
sacred 10
but 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
grievously 10
anxious 10
about 10
her 10
she 10
caught 10
on 10
to 10
my 10
meaning 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
settled 10
that 10
matter 10
in 10
a 10
word 10
tell 10
arthur 10
everything 10
you 10
choose 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
care 10
for 10
myself 10
but 10
for 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
am 10
quite 10
free 10
i 10
could 10
easily 10
see 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
somewhat 10
bloodless 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
usual 10
anemic 10
signs 10
and 10
by 10
the 10
chance 10
i 10
was 10
able 10
to 10
test 10
the 10
actual 10
quality 10
of 10
her 10
blood 10
for 10
in 10
opening 10
a 10
window 10
which 10
was 10
stiff 10
a 10
cord 10
gave 10
way 10
and 10
she 10
cut 10
her 10
hand 10
slightly 10
with 10
broken 10
glass 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
slight 10
matter 10
in 10
itself 10
but 10
it 10
gave 10
me 10
an 10
evident 10
chance 10
and 10
i 10
secured 10
a 10
few 10
drops 10
of 10
the 10
blood 10
and 10
have 10
analysed 10
them 10
the 10
qualitative 10
analysis 10
give 10
a 10
quite 10
normal 10
condition 10
and 10
shows 10
i 10
should 10
infer 10
in 10
itself 10
a 10
vigorous 10
state 10
of 10
health 10
in 10
other 10
physical 10
matters 10
i 10
was 10
quite 10
satisfied 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
need 10
for 10
anxiety 10
but 10
as 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
a 10
cause 10
somewhere 10
i 10
have 10
come 10
to 10
the 10
conclusion 10
that 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
something 10
mental 10
she 10
complains 10
of 10
difficulty 10
breathing 10
satisfactorily 10
at 10
times 10
and 10
of 10
heavy 10
lethargic 10
sleep 10
with 10
dreams 10
that 10
frighten 10
her 10
but 10
regarding 10
which 10
she 10
can 10
remember 10
nothing 10
she 10
says 10
that 10
as 10
a 10
child 10
she 10
used 10
to 10
walk 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
and 10
that 10
when 10
in 10
whitby 10
the 10
habit 10
came 10
back 10
and 10
that 10
once 10
she 10
walked 10
out 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
went 10
to 10
east 10
cliff 10
where 10
miss 10
murray 10
found 10
her 10
but 10
she 10
assures 10
me 10
that 10
of 10
late 10
the 10
habit 10
has 10
not 10
returned 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
doubt 10
and 10
so 10
have 10
done 10
the 10
best 10
thing 10
i 10
know 10
of 10
i 10
have 10
written 10
to 10
my 10
old 10
friend 10
and 10
master 10
professor 10
van 10
helsing 10
of 10
amsterdam 10
who 10
knows 10
as 10
much 10
about 10
obscure 10
diseases 10
as 10
any 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
i 10
have 10
asked 10
him 10
to 10
come 10
over 10
and 10
as 10
you 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
all 10
things 10
were 10
to 10
be 10
at 10
your 10
charge 10
i 10
have 10
mentioned 10
to 10
him 10
who 10
you 10
are 10
and 10
your 10
relations 10
to 10
miss 10
westenra 10
this 10
my 10
dear 10
fellow 10
is 10
in 10
obedience 10
to 10
your 10
wishes 10
for 10
i 10
am 10
only 10
too 10
proud 10
and 10
happy 10
to 10
do 10
anything 10
i 10
can 10
for 10
her 10
van 10
helsing 10
would 10
i 10
know 10
do 10
anything 10
for 10
me 10
for 10
a 10
personal 10
reason 10
so 10
no 10
matter 10
on 10
what 10
ground 10
he 10
comes 10
we 10
must 10
accept 10
his 10
wishes 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
seemingly 10
arbitrary 10
man 10
this 10
is 10
because 10
he 10
knows 10
what 10
he 10
is 10
talking 10
about 10
better 10
than 10
any 10
one 10
else 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
philosopher 10
and 10
a 10
metaphysician 10
and 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
most 10
advanced 10
scientists 10
of 10
his 10
day 10
and 10
he 10
has 10
i 10
believe 10
an 10
absolutely 10
open 10
mind 10
this 10
with 10
an 10
iron 10
nerve 10
a 10
temper 10
of 10
the 10
icebrook 10
and 10
indomitable 10
resolution 10
selfcommand 10
and 10
toleration 10
exalted 10
from 10
virtues 10
to 10
blessings 10
and 10
the 10
kindliest 10
and 10

for 10
mankind 10

matter 10
he 10
said 10
you 10
must 10
tell 10
him 10
all 10
you 10
think 10
tell 10
him 10
him 10
what 10
i 10
think 10
if 10
you 10
can 10
guess 10
it 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
nay 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
jesting 10
this 10
is 10
no 10
jest 10
but 10
life 10
and 10
death 10
perhaps 10
more 10
i 10
asked 10
what 10
he 10
meant 10
by 10
that 10
for 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
serious 10
this 10
was 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
come 10
back 10
to 10
town 10
and 10
he 10
was 10
having 10
a 10
cup 10
of 10
tea 10
before 10
starting 10
on 10
his 10
return 10
to 10
amsterdam 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
give 10
me 10
any 10
further 10
clue 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
be 10
angry 10
with 10
me 10
art 10
because 10
his 10
very 10
reticence 10
means 10
that 10
all 10
his 10
brains 10
are 10
working 10
for 10
her 10
good 10
he 10
will 10
speak 10
plainly 10
enough 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
comes 10
be 10
sure 10
so 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
i 10
would 10
simply 10
write 10
an 10
account 10
of 10
our 10
visit 10
just 10
as 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
doing 10
a 10
descriptive 10
special 10
article 10
for 10
the 10
daily 10
telegraph 10
he 10
seemed 10
not 10
to 10
notice 10
but 10
remarked 10
that 10
the 10
smuts 10
of 10
london 10
were 10
not 10
quite 10
so 10
bad 10
as 10
they 10
used 10
to 10
be 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
student 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
get 10
his 10
report 10
tomorrow 10
if 10
he 10
can 10
possibly 10
make 10
it 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
letter 10
well 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
visit 10
lucy 10
was 10
more 10
cheerful 10
than 10
on 10
the 10
day 10
i 10
first 10
saw 10
her 10
and 10
certainly 10
looked 10
better 10
she 10
had 10
lost 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
ghastly 10
look 10
that 10
so 10
upset 10
you 10
and 10
her 10
breathing 10
was 10
normal 10
she 10
was 10
very 10
sweet 10
to 10
the 10
professor 10
as 10
she 10
always 10
is 10
and 10
tried 10
to 10
make 10
him 10
feel 10
at 10
ease 10
though 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
poor 10
girl 10
was 10
making 10
a 10
hard 10
struggle 10
for 10
it 10
i 10
believe 10
van 10
helsing 10
saw 10
it 10
too 10
for 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
quick 10
look 10
under 10
his 10
bushy 10
brows 10
that 10
i 10
knew 10
of 10
old 10
then 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
chat 10
of 10
all 10
things 10
except 10
ourselves 10
and 10
diseases 10
and 10
with 10
such 10
an 10
infinite 10
geniality 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
poor 10
lucys 10
pretense 10
of 10
animation 10
merge 10
into 10
reality 10
then 10
without 10
any 10
seeming 10
change 10
he 10
brought 10
the 10
conversation 10
gently 10
round 10
to 10
his 10
visit 10
and 10
sauvely 10
said 10
my 10
dear 10
young 10
miss 10
i 10
have 10
the 10
so 10
great 10
pleasure 10
because 10
you 10
are 10
so 10
much 10
beloved 10
that 10
is 10
much 10
my 10
dear 10
even 10
were 10
there 10
that 10
which 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
see 10
they 10
told 10
me 10
you 10
were 10
down 10
in 10
the 10
spirit 10
and 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
of 10
a 10
ghastly 10
pale 10
to 10
them 10
i 10
say 10
pouf 10
and 10
he 10
snapped 10
his 10
fingers 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
but 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
show 10
them 10
how 10
wrong 10
they 10
are 10
how 10
can 10
he 10
and 10
he 10
pointed 10
at 10
me 10
with 10
the 10
same 10
look 10
and 10
gesture 10
as 10
that 10
with 10
which 10
he 10
pointed 10
me 10
out 10
in 10
his 10
class 10
on 10
or 10
rather 10
after 10
a 10
particular 10
occasion 10
which 10
he 10
never 10
fails 10
to 10
remind 10
me 10
of 10
know 10
anything 10
of 10
a 10
young 10
ladies 10
he 10
has 10
his 10
madmen 10
to 10
play 10
with 10
and 10
to 10
bring 10
them 10
back 10
to 10
happiness 10
and 10
to 10
those 10
that 10
love 10
them 10
it 10
is 10
much 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
oh 10
but 10
there 10
are 10
rewards 10
in 10
that 10
we 10
can 10
bestow 10
such 10
happiness 10
but 10
the 10
young 10
ladies 10
he 10
has 10
no 10
wife 10
nor 10
daughter 10
and 10
the 10
young 10
do 10
not 10
tell 10
themselves 10
to 10
the 10
young 10
but 10
to 10
the 10
old 10
like 10
me 10
who 10
have 10
known 10
so 10
many 10
sorrows 10
and 10
the 10
causes 10
of 10
them 10
so 10
my 10
dear 10
we 10
will 10
send 10
him 10
away 10
to 10
smoke 10
the 10
cigarette 10
in 10
the 10
garden 10
whiles 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
have 10
little 10
talk 10
all 10
to 10
ourselves 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
hint 10
and 10
strolled 10
about 10
and 10
presently 10
the 10
professor 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
called 10
me 10
in 10
he 10
looked 10
grave 10
but 10
said 10
i 10
have 10
made 10
careful 10
examination 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
functional 10
cause 10
with 10
you 10
i 10
agree 10
that 10
there 10
has 10
been 10
much 10
blood 10
lost 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
but 10
is 10
not 10
but 10
the 10
conditions 10
of 10
her 10
are 10
in 10
no 10
way 10
anemic 10
i 10
have 10
asked 10
her 10
to 10
send 10
me 10
her 10
maid 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
ask 10
just 10
one 10
or 10
two 10
questions 10
that 10
so 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
chance 10
to 10
miss 10
nothing 10
i 10
know 10
well 10
what 10
she 10
will 10
say 10
and 10
yet 10
there 10
is 10
cause 10
there 10
is 10
always 10
cause 10
for 10
everything 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
back 10
home 10
and 10
think 10
you 10
must 10
send 10
me 10
the 10
telegram 10
every 10
day 10
and 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
cause 10
i 10
shall 10
come 10
again 10
the 10
disease 10

old 10
fellow 10
to 10

such 10
a 10
position 10
between 10

are 10
both 10
so 10
dear 10

overanxious 10
unless 10
you 10
hear 10
from 10
me 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
septemberzoophagous 10
patient 10
still 10
keeps 10
up 10
our 10
interest 10
in 10
him 10
he 10
had 10
only 10
one 10
outburst 10
and 10
that 10
was 10
yesterday 10
at 10
an 10
unusual 10
time 10
just 10
before 10
the 10
stroke 10
of 10
noon 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
grow 10
restless 10
the 10
attendant 10
knew 10
the 10
symptoms 10
and 10
at 10
once 10
summoned 10
aid 10
fortunately 10
the 10
men 10
came 10
at 10
a 10
run 10
and 10
were 10
just 10
in 10
time 10
for 10
at 10
the 10
stroke 10
of 10
noon 10
he 10
became 10
so 10
violent 10
that 10
it 10
took 10
all 10
their 10
strength 10
to 10
hold 10
him 10
in 10
about 10
five 10
minutes 10
however 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
get 10
more 10
quiet 10
and 10
finally 10
sank 10
into 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
melancholy 10
in 10
which 10
state 10
he 10
has 10
remained 10
up 10
to 10
now 10
the 10
attendant 10
tells 10
me 10
that 10
his 10
screams 10
whilst 10
in 10
the 10
paroxysm 10
were 10
really 10
appalling 10
i 10
found 10
my 10
hands 10
full 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
in 10
attending 10
to 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
other 10
patients 10
who 10
were 10
frightened 10
by 10
him 10
indeed 10
i 10
can 10
quite 10
understand 10
the 10
effect 10
for 10
the 10
sounds 10
disturbed 10
even 10
me 10
though 10
i 10
was 10
some 10
distance 10
away 10
it 10
is 10
now 10
after 10
the 10
dinner 10
hour 10
of 10
the 10
asylum 10
and 10
as 10
yet 10
my 10
patient 10
sits 10
in 10
a 10
corner 10
brooding 10
with 10
a 10
dull 10
sullen 10
woebegone 10
look 10
in 10
his 10
face 10
which 10
seems 10
rather 10
to 10
indicate 10
than 10
to 10
show 10
something 10
directly 10
i 10
cannot 10
quite 10
understand 10
it 10
lateranother 10
change 10
in 10
my 10
patient 10
at 10
five 10
oclock 10
i 10
looked 10
in 10
on 10
him 10
and 10
found 10
him 10
seemingly 10
as 10
happy 10
and 10
contented 10
as 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
be 10
he 10
was 10
catching 10
flies 10
and 10
eating 10
them 10
and 10
was 10
keeping 10
note 10
of 10
his 10
capture 10
by 10
making 10
nailmarks 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
between 10
the 10
ridges 10
of 10
padding 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
he 10
came 10
over 10
and 10
apologized 10
for 10
his 10
bad 10
conduct 10
and 10
asked 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
humble 10
cringing 10
way 10
to 10
be 10
led 10
back 10
to 10
his 10
own 10
room 10
and 10
to 10
have 10
his 10
notebook 10
again 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
well 10
to 10
humour 10
him 10
so 10
he 10
is 10
back 10
in 10
his 10
room 10
with 10
the 10
window 10
open 10
he 10
has 10
the 10
sugar 10
of 10
his 10
tea 10
spread 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
sill 10
and 10
is 10
reaping 10
quite 10
a 10
harvest 10
of 10
flies 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
now 10
eating 10
them 10
but 10
putting 10
them 10
into 10
a 10
box 10
as 10
of 10
old 10
and 10
is 10
already 10
examining 10
the 10
corners 10
of 10
his 10
room 10
to 10
find 10
a 10
spider 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
get 10
him 10
to 10
talk 10
about 10
the 10
past 10
few 10
days 10
for 10
any 10
clue 10
to 10
his 10
thoughts 10
would 10
be 10
of 10
immense 10
help 10
to 10
me 10
but 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
rise 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
or 10
two 10
he 10
looked 10
very 10
sad 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
far 10
away 10
voice 10
as 10
though 10
saying 10
it 10
rather 10
to 10
himself 10
than 10
to 10
me 10
all 10
over 10
all 10
over 10
he 10
has 10
deserted 10
me 10
no 10
hope 10
for 10
me 10
now 10
unless 10
i 10
do 10
it 10
myself 10
then 10
suddenly 10
turning 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
resolute 10
way 10
he 10
said 10
doctor 10
wont 10
you 10
be 10
very 10
good 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
let 10
me 10
have 10
a 10
little 10
more 10
sugar 10
i 10
think 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
very 10
good 10
for 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
flies 10
i 10
said 10
yes 10
the 10
flies 10
like 10
it 10
too 10
and 10
i 10
like 10
the 10
flies 10
therefore 10
i 10
like 10
itand 10
there 10
are 10
people 10
who 10
know 10
so 10
little 10
as 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
madmen 10
do 10
not 10
argue 10
i 10
procured 10
him 10
a 10
double 10
supply 10
and 10
left 10
him 10
as 10
happy 10
a 10
man 10
as 10
i 10
suppose 10
any 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
fathom 10
his 10
mind 10
midnightanother 10
change 10
in 10
him 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
to 10
see 10
miss 10
westenra 10
whom 10
i 10
found 10
much 10
better 10
and 10
had 10
just 10
returned 10
and 10
was 10
standing 10
at 10
our 10
own 10
gate 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
sunset 10
when 10
once 10
more 10
i 10
heard 10
him 10
yelling 10
as 10
his 10
room 10
is 10
on 10
this 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
it 10
better 10
than 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
shock 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
turn 10
from 10
the 10
wonderful 10
smoky 10
beauty 10
of 10
a 10
sunset 10
over 10
london 10
with 10
its 10
lurid 10
lights 10
and 10
inky 10
shadows 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
marvellous 10
tints 10
that 10
come 10
on 10
foul 10
clouds 10
even 10
as 10
on 10
foul 10
water 10
and 10
to 10
realize 10
all 10
the 10
grim 10
sternness 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
cold 10
stone 10
building 10
with 10
its 10
wealth 10
of 10
breathing 10
misery 10
and 10
my 10
own 10
desolate 10
heart 10
to 10
endure 10
it 10
all 10
i 10
reached 10
him 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
going 10
down 10
and 10
from 10
his 10
window 10
saw 10
the 10
red 10
disc 10
sink 10
as 10
it 10
sank 10
he 10
became 10
less 10
and 10
less 10
frenzied 10
and 10
just 10
as 10
it 10
dipped 10
he 10
slid 10
from 10
the 10
hands 10
that 10
held 10
him 10
an 10
inert 10
mass 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
it 10
is 10
wonderful 10
however 10
what 10
intellectual 10
recuperative 10
power 10
lunatics 10
have 10
for 10
within 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
quite 10
calmly 10
and 10
looked 10
around 10
him 10
i 10
signalled 10
to 10
the 10
attendants 10
not 10
to 10
hold 10
him 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
anxious 10
to 10
see 10
what 10
he 10
would 10
do 10
he 10
went 10
straight 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
brushed 10
out 10
the 10
crumbs 10
of 10
sugar 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
his 10
fly 10
box 10
and 10
emptied 10
it 10
outside 10
and 10
threw 10
away 10
the 10
box 10
then 10
he 10
shut 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
crossing 10
over 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
his 10
bed 10
all 10
this 10
surprised 10
me 10
so 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
are 10
you 10
going 10
to 10
keep 10
flies 10
any 10
more 10
no 10
said 10
he 10
i 10
am 10
sick 10
of 10
all 10
that 10
rubbish 10
he 10
certainly 10
is 10
a 10
wonderfully 10
interesting 10
study 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
some 10
glimpse 10
of 10
his 10
mind 10
or 10
of 10
the 10
cause 10
of 10
his 10
sudden 10
passion 10
stop 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
a 10
clue 10
after 10
all 10
if 10
we 10
can 10
find 10
why 10
today 10
his 10
paroxysms 10
came 10
on 10
at 10
high 10
noon 10
and 10
at 10
sunset 10
can 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
malign 10
influence 10
of 10
the 10
sun 10
at 10
periods 10
which 10
affects 10
certain 10
natures 10
as 10

lucy 10
this 10
morning 10
had 10
gone 10
back 10
a 10
bit 10
there 10
is 10
however 10
one 10
good 10
thing 10
which 10
has 10
arisen 10
from 10
it 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
was 10
naturally 10
anxious 10
concerning 10
lucy 10
and 10
has 10
consulted 10
me 10
professionally 10
about 10
her 10
i 10
took 10
advantage 10
of 10
the 10
opportunity 10
and 10
told 10
her 10
that 10
my 10
old 10
master 10
van 10
helsing 10
the 10
great 10
specialist 10
was 10
coming 10
to 10
stay 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
put 10
her 10
in 10
his 10
charge 10
conjointly 10
with 10
myself 10
so 10
now 10
we 10
can 10
come 10
and 10
go 10
without 10
alarming 10
her 10
unduly 10
for 10
a 10
shock 10
to 10
her 10
would 10
mean 10
sudden 10
death 10
and 10
this 10
in 10
lucys 10
weak 10
condition 10
might 10
be 10
disastrous 10
to 10
her 10
we 10
are 10
hedged 10
in 10
with 10
difficulties 10
all 10
of 10
us 10
my 10
poor 10
fellow 10
but 10
please 10
god 10
we 10
shall 10
come 10
through 10
them 10
all 10
right 10
if 10
any 10
need 10
i 10
shall 10
write 10
so 10
that 10
if 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
hear 10
from 10
me 10
take 10
it 10
for 10
granted 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
simply 10
waiting 10
for 10

young 10
friend 10

i 10
waited 10
till 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
you 10
as 10
i 10
said 10
in 10
my 10
telegram 10
i 10
wrote 10
him 10
a 10
letter 10
simply 10
telling 10
him 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
coming 10
as 10
miss 10
westenra 10
was 10
not 10
so 10
well 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
let 10
him 10
know 10
if 10
need 10
be 10
right 10
my 10
friend 10
he 10
said 10
quite 10
right 10
better 10
he 10
not 10
know 10
as 10
yet 10
perhaps 10
he 10
will 10
never 10
know 10
i 10
pray 10
so 10
but 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
needed 10
then 10
he 10
shall 10
know 10
all 10
and 10
my 10
good 10
friend 10
john 10
let 10
me 10
caution 10
you 10
you 10
deal 10
with 10
the 10
madmen 10
all 10
men 10
are 10
mad 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
or 10
the 10
other 10
and 10
inasmuch 10
as 10
you 10
deal 10
discreetly 10
with 10
your 10
madmen 10
so 10
deal 10
with 10
gods 10
madmen 10
too 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
you 10
tell 10
not 10
your 10
madmen 10
what 10
you 10
do 10
nor 10
why 10
you 10
do 10
it 10
you 10
tell 10
them 10
not 10
what 10
you 10
think 10
so 10
you 10
shall 10
keep 10
knowledge 10
in 10
its 10
place 10
where 10
it 10
may 10
rest 10
where 10
it 10
may 10
gather 10
its 10
kind 10
around 10
it 10
and 10
breed 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
keep 10
as 10
yet 10
what 10
we 10
know 10
here 10
and 10
here 10
he 10
touched 10
me 10
on 10
the 10
heart 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
forehead 10
and 10
then 10
touched 10
himself 10
the 10
same 10
way 10
i 10
have 10
for 10
myself 10
thoughts 10
at 10
the 10
present 10
later 10
i 10
shall 10
unfold 10
to 10
you 10
why 10

good 10

arrive 10
at 10
some 10
decisionhe 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
when 10
the 10
corn 10
is 10
grown 10
even 10
before 10
it 10
has 10
ripened 10
while 10
the 10
milk 10
of 10
its 10
mother 10
earth 10
is 10
in 10
him 10
and 10
the 10
sunshine 10
has 10
not 10
yet 10
begun 10
to 10
paint 10
him 10
with 10
his 10
gold 10
the 10
husbandman 10
he 10
pull 10
the 10
ear 10
and 10
rub 10
him 10
between 10
his 10
rough 10
hands 10
and 10
blow 10
away 10
the 10
green 10
chaff 10
and 10
say 10
to 10
you 10
look 10
hes 10
good 10
corn 10
he 10
will 10
make 10
a 10
good 10
crop 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
comes 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
application 10
and 10
told 10
him 10
so 10
for 10
reply 10
he 10
reached 10
over 10
and 10
took 10
my 10
ear 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
pulled 10
it 10
playfully 10
as 10
he 10
used 10
long 10
ago 10
to 10
do 10
at 10
lectures 10
and 10
said 10
the 10
good 10
husbandman 10
tell 10
you 10
so 10
then 10
because 10
he 10
knows 10
but 10
not 10
till 10
then 10
but 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
find 10
the 10
good 10
husbandman 10
dig 10
up 10
his 10
planted 10
corn 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
he 10
grow 10
that 10
is 10
for 10
the 10
children 10
who 10
play 10
at 10
husbandry 10
and 10
not 10
for 10
those 10
who 10
take 10
it 10
as 10
of 10
the 10
work 10
of 10
their 10
life 10
see 10
you 10
now 10
friend 10
john 10
i 10
have 10
sown 10
my 10
corn 10
and 10
nature 10
has 10
her 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
making 10
it 10
sprout 10
if 10
he 10
sprout 10
at 10
all 10
theres 10
some 10
promise 10
and 10
i 10
wait 10
till 10
the 10
ear 10
begins 10
to 10
swell 10
he 10
broke 10
off 10
for 10
he 10
evidently 10
saw 10
that 10
i 10
understood 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
gravely 10
you 10
were 10
always 10
a 10
careful 10
student 10
and 10
your 10
case 10
book 10
was 10
ever 10
more 10
full 10
than 10
the 10
rest 10
and 10
i 10
trust 10
that 10
good 10
habit 10
have 10
not 10
fail 10
remember 10
my 10
friend 10
that 10
knowledge 10
is 10
stronger 10
than 10
memory 10
and 10
we 10
should 10
not 10
trust 10
the 10
weaker 10
even 10
if 10
you 10
have 10
not 10
kept 10
the 10
good 10
practice 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
that 10
this 10
case 10
of 10
our 10
dear 10
miss 10
is 10
one 10
that 10
may 10
be 10
mind 10
i 10
say 10
may 10
be 10
of 10
such 10
interest 10
to 10
us 10
and 10
others 10
that 10
all 10
the 10
rest 10
may 10
not 10
make 10
him 10
kick 10
the 10
beam 10
as 10
your 10
people 10
say 10
take 10
then 10
good 10
note 10
of 10
it 10
nothing 10
is 10
too 10
small 10
i 10
counsel 10
you 10
put 10
down 10
in 10
record 10
even 10
your 10
doubts 10
and 10
surmises 10
hereafter 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
of 10
interest 10
to 10
you 10
to 10
see 10
how 10
true 10
you 10
guess 10
we 10
learn 10
from 10
failure 10
not 10
from 10
success 10
when 10
i 10
described 10
lucys 10
symptoms 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
before 10
but 10
infinitely 10
more 10
marked 10
he 10
looked 10
very 10
grave 10
but 10
said 10
nothing 10
he 10
took 10
with 10
him 10
a 10
bag 10
in 10
which 10
were 10
many 10
instruments 10
and 10
drugs 10
the 10
ghastly 10
paraphernalia 10
of 10
our 10
beneficial 10
trade 10
as 10
he 10
once 10
called 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
his 10
lectures 10
the 10
equipment 10
of 10
a 10
professor 10
of 10
the 10
healing 10
craft 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
shown 10
in 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
met 10
us 10
she 10
was 10
alarmed 10
but 10
not 10
nearly 10
so 10
much 10
as 10
i 10
expected 10
to 10
find 10
her 10
nature 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
her 10
beneficient 10
moods 10
has 10
ordained 10
that 10
even 10
death 10
has 10
some 10
antidote 10
to 10
its 10
own 10
terrors 10
here 10
in 10
a 10
case 10
where 10
any 10
shock 10
may 10
prove 10
fatal 10
matters 10
are 10
so 10
ordered 10
that 10
from 10
some 10
cause 10
or 10
other 10
the 10
things 10
not 10
personal 10
even 10
the 10
terrible 10
change 10
in 10
her 10
daughter 10
to 10
whom 10
she 10
is 10
so 10
attached 10
do 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
reach 10
her 10
it 10
is 10
something 10
like 10
the 10
way 10
dame 10
nature 10
gathers 10
round 10
a 10
foreign 10
body 10
an 10
envelope 10
of 10
some 10
insensitive 10
tissue 10
which 10
can 10
protect 10
from 10
evil 10
that 10
which 10
it 10
would 10
otherwise 10
harm 10
by 10
contact 10
if 10
this 10
be 10
an 10
ordered 10
selfishness 10
then 10
we 10
should 10
pause 10
before 10
we 10
condemn 10
any 10
one 10
for 10
the 10
vice 10
of 10
egoism 10
for 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
deeper 10
root 10
for 10
its 10
causes 10
than 10
we 10
have 10
knowledge 10
of 10
i 10
used 10
my 10
knowledge 10
of 10
this 10
phase 10
of 10
spiritual 10
pathology 10
and 10
set 10
down 10
a 10
rule 10
that 10
she 10
should 10
not 10
be 10
present 10
with 10
lucy 10
or 10
think 10
of 10
her 10
illness 10
more 10
than 10
was 10
absolutely 10
required 10
she 10
assented 10
readily 10
so 10
readily 10
that 10
i 10
saw 10
again 10
the 10
hand 10
of 10
nature 10
fighting 10
for 10
life 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
shown 10
up 10
to 10
lucys 10
room 10
if 10
i 10
was 10
shocked 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
her 10
yesterday 10
i 10
was 10
horrified 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
her 10
today 10
she 10
was 10
ghastly 10
chalkily 10
pale 10
the 10
red 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
gone 10
even 10
from 10
her 10
lips 10
and 10
gums 10
and 10
the 10
bones 10
of 10
her 10
face 10
stood 10
out 10
prominently 10
her 10
breathing 10
was 10
painful 10
to 10
see 10
or 10
hear 10
van 10
helsings 10
face 10
grew 10
set 10
as 10
marble 10
and 10
his 10
eyebrows 10
converged 10
till 10
they 10
almost 10
touched 10
over 10
his 10
nose 10
lucy 10
lay 10
motionless 10
and 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
have 10
strength 10
to 10
speak 10
so 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
silent 10
then 10
van 10
helsing 10
beckoned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
gently 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
instant 10
we 10
had 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
he 10
stepped 10
quickly 10
along 10
the 10
passage 10
to 10
the 10
next 10
door 10
which 10
was 10
open 10
then 10
he 10
pulled 10
me 10
quickly 10
in 10
with 10
him 10
and 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
my 10
god 10
he 10
said 10
this 10
is 10
dreadful 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
time 10
to 10
be 10
lost 10
she 10
will 10
die 10
for 10
sheer 10
want 10
of 10
blood 10
to 10
keep 10
the 10
hearts 10
action 10
as 10
it 10
should 10
be 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
a 10
transfusion 10
of 10
blood 10
at 10
once 10
is 10
it 10
you 10
or 10
me 10

and 10
stronger 10

went 10
downstairs 10
with 10
him 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
going 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
knock 10
at 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
when 10
we 10
reached 10
the 10
hall 10
the 10
maid 10
had 10
just 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
arthur 10
was 10
stepping 10
quickly 10
in 10
he 10
rushed 10
up 10
to 10
me 10
saying 10
in 10
an 10
eager 10
whisper 10
jack 10
i 10
was 10
so 10
anxious 10
i 10
read 10
between 10
the 10
lines 10
of 10
your 10
letter 10
and 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
the 10
dad 10
was 10
better 10
so 10
i 10
ran 10
down 10
here 10
to 10
see 10

that 10
gentleman 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
thankful 10
to 10
you 10
sir 10
for 10
coming 10
when 10
first 10
the 10
professors 10
eye 10
had 10
lit 10
upon 10
him 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
angry 10
at 10
his 10
interruption 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
time 10
but 10
now 10
as 10
he 10
took 10
in 10
his 10
stalwart 10
proportions 10
and 10
recognized 10
the 10
strong 10
young 10
manhood 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
emanate 10
from 10
him 10
his 10
eyes 10
gleamed 10
without 10
a 10
pause 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
held 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
sir 10
you 10
have 10
come 10
in 10
time 10

lover 10
of 10
our 10
dear 10
miss 10

child 10

not 10
go 10
like 10
thatfor 10
he 10
suddenly 10
grew 10
pale 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
in 10
a 10
chair 10
almost 10
fainting 10
you 10
are 10
to 10
help 10
her 10
you 10

do 10
more 10
than 10

and 10
i 10
shall 10
do 10
it 10
my 10
life 10

hers 10
and 10
i 10
would 10
give 10
the 10
last 10
drop 10
of 10
blood 10
in 10
my 10
body 10
for 10
her 10
the 10
professor 10
has 10
a 10
strongly 10
humorous 10
side 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
from 10
old 10
knowledge 10
detect 10
a 10
trace 10
of 10
its 10
origin 10
in 10
his 10
answer 10
my 10
young 10
sir 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
ask 10
so 10
much 10
as 10
that 10
not 10
the 10
last 10
what 10
shall 10
i 10
do 10

fire 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
his 10
open 10
nostrils 10
quivered 10
with 10
intent 10
van 10
helsing 10
slapped 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
shoulder 10
come 10
he 10
said 10
you 10

than 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
arthur 10
looked 10
bewildered 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
went 10
on 10
by 10
explaining 10
in 10
a 10
kindly 10
way 10
young 10
miss 10

and 10
i 10
have 10
consulted 10
and 10

are 10
about 10
to 10
perform 10
what 10
we 10
call 10
transfusion 10
of 10
blood 10
to 10
transfer 10
from 10
full 10
veins 10
of 10
one 10
to 10
the 10
empty 10
veins 10
which 10
pine 10
for 10
him 10
john 10
was 10
to 10
give 10
his 10
blood 10

turned 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
said 10
if 10
you 10
only 10
knew 10
how 10
gladly 10
i 10
would 10
die 10
for 10
her 10
you 10
would 10
understand 10
he 10
stopped 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
choke 10
in 10
his 10
voice 10
good 10
boy 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
in 10
the 10
notsofaroff 10
you 10
will 10
be 10
happy 10
that 10
you 10
have 10
done 10
all 10
for 10
her 10
you 10
love 10
come 10
now 10
and 10
be 10
silent 10
you 10
shall 10
kiss 10
her 10
once 10
before 10
it 10
is 10
done 10
but 10
then 10
you 10
must 10
go 10
and 10
you 10
must 10
leave 10
at 10
my 10
sign 10
say 10
no 10
word 10
to 10
madame 10
you 10
know 10
how 10
it 10
is 10
with 10
her 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
no 10
shock 10
any 10
knowledge 10
of 10
this 10
would 10
be 10
one 10
come 10
we 10
all 10
went 10
up 10
to 10
lucys 10
room 10
arthur 10
by 10
direction 10
remained 10
outside 10
lucy 10
turned 10
her 10
head 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
us 10
but 10
said 10
nothing 10
she 10
was 10
not 10
asleep 10
but 10
she 10
was 10
simply 10
too 10
weak 10
to 10
make 10
the 10
effort 10
her 10
eyes 10
spoke 10
to 10
us 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
van 10
helsing 10
took 10
some 10
things 10
from 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
laid 10
them 10
on 10
a 10
little 10
table 10
out 10
of 10
sight 10
then 10
he 10
mixed 10
a 10
narcotic 10
and 10
coming 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
bed 10
said 10
cheerily 10
now 10
little 10
miss 10
here 10
is 10
your 10
medicine 10
drink 10
it 10
off 10
like 10
a 10
good 10
child 10
see 10
i 10
lift 10
you 10
so 10
that 10
to 10
swallow 10
is 10
easy 10
yes 10
she 10
had 10
made 10
the 10
effort 10
with 10
success 10
it 10
astonished 10
me 10
how 10
long 10
the 10
drug 10
took 10
to 10
act 10
this 10
in 10
fact 10
marked 10
the 10
extent 10
of 10
her 10
weakness 10
the 10
time 10
seemed 10
endless 10
until 10
sleep 10
began 10
to 10
flicker 10
in 10
her 10
eyelids 10
at 10
last 10
however 10
the 10
narcotic 10
began 10
to 10
manifest 10
its 10
potency 10
and 10
she 10
fell 10
into 10
a 10
deep 10
sleep 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
was 10
satisfied 10
he 10
called 10
arthur 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
bade 10
him 10
strip 10
off 10
his 10
coat 10
then 10
he 10
added 10
you 10
may 10
take 10
that 10
one 10
little 10
kiss 10
whiles 10
i 10
bring 10
over 10
the 10
table 10
friend 10
john 10
help 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
neither 10
of 10
us 10
looked 10
whilst 10
he 10
bent 10
over 10
her 10
van 10
helsing 10
turning 10
to 10
me 10
said 10
he 10
is 10
so 10
young 10
and 10
strong 10
and 10
of 10
blood 10
so 10
pure 10
that 10
we 10
need 10
not 10
defibrinate 10
it 10
then 10
with 10
swiftness 10
but 10
with 10
absolute 10
method 10
van 10
helsing 10
performed 10
the 10
operation 10
as 10
the 10
transfusion 10
went 10
on 10
something 10
like 10
life 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
back 10
to 10
poor 10
lucys 10
cheeks 10
and 10
through 10
arthurs 10
growing 10
pallor 10
the 10
joy 10
of 10
his 10
face 10
seemed 10
absolutely 10
to 10
shine 10
after 10
a 10
bit 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
grow 10
anxious 10
for 10
the 10
loss 10
of 10
blood 10
was 10
telling 10
on 10
arthur 10
strong 10
man 10
as 10
he 10
was 10
it 10
gave 10
me 10
an 10
idea 10
of 10
what 10
a 10
terrible 10
strain 10
lucys 10
system 10
must 10
have 10
undergone 10
that 10
what 10
weakened 10
arthur 10
only 10
partially 10
restored 10
her 10
but 10
the 10
professors 10
face 10
was 10
set 10
and 10
he 10
stood 10
watch 10
in 10
hand 10
and 10
with 10
his 10
eyes 10
fixed 10
now 10
on 10
the 10
patient 10
and 10
now 10
on 10
arthur 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
beat 10
presently 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
soft 10
voice 10
do 10
not 10
stir 10
an 10
instant 10
it 10
is 10
enough 10
you 10
attend 10
him 10
i 10
will 10
look 10
to 10
her 10
when 10
all 10
was 10
over 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
how 10
much 10
arthur 10
was 10
weakened 10
i 10
dressed 10
the 10
wound 10
and 10
took 10
his 10
arm 10
to 10
bring 10
him 10
away 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
spoke 10
without 10
turning 10
round 10
the 10
man 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
eyes 10
in 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
his 10
head 10
the 10
brave 10
lover 10
i 10
think 10
deserve 10
another 10
kiss 10
which 10
he 10
shall 10
have 10
presently 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
now 10
finished 10
his 10
operation 10
he 10
adjusted 10
the 10
pillow 10
to 10
the 10
patients 10
head 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
so 10
the 10
narrow 10
black 10
velvet 10
band 10
which 10
she 10
seems 10
always 10
to 10
wear 10
round 10
her 10
throat 10
buckled 10
with 10
an 10
old 10
diamond 10
buckle 10
which 10
her 10
lover 10
had 10
given 10
her 10
was 10
dragged 10
a 10
little 10
up 10
and 10
showed 10
a 10
red 10
mark 10
on 10
her 10
throat 10
arthur 10
did 10
not 10
notice 10
it 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
deep 10
hiss 10
of 10
indrawn 10
breath 10
which 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
van 10
helsings 10
ways 10
of 10
betraying 10
emotion 10
he 10
said 10
nothing 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
but 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
saying 10
now 10
take 10
down 10
our 10
brave 10
young 10
lover 10
give 10
him 10
of 10
the 10
port 10
wine 10
and 10
let 10
him 10
lie 10
down 10
a 10
while 10
he 10
must 10
then 10
go 10
home 10
and 10
rest 10
sleep 10
much 10
and 10
eat 10
much 10
that 10
he 10
may 10
be 10
recruited 10
of 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
so 10
given 10
to 10
his 10
love 10
he 10
must 10
not 10
stay 10
here 10
hold 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
may 10
take 10
it 10
sir 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
anxious 10
of 10
result 10
then 10
bring 10
it 10
with 10
you 10
that 10
in 10
all 10
ways 10
the 10
operation 10
is 10
successful 10
you 10
have 10
saved 10
her 10
life 10
this 10
time 10
and 10
you 10
can 10
go 10
home 10
and 10
rest 10
easy 10
in 10
mind 10
that 10
all 10
that 10
can 10
be 10
is 10
i 10
shall 10
tell 10
her 10
all 10
when 10
she 10
is 10
well 10
she 10
shall 10
love 10
you 10
none 10
the 10
less 10
for 10
what 10
you 10
have 10
done 10
goodbye 10
when 10
arthur 10
had 10
gone 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
room 10
lucy 10
was 10
sleeping 10
gently 10
but 10
her 10
breathing 10
was 10
stronger 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
counterpane 10
move 10
as 10
her 10
breast 10
heaved 10
by 10
the 10
bedside 10
sat 10
van 10
helsing 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
intently 10
the 10
velvet 10
band 10
again 10
covered 10
the 10
red 10
mark 10
i 10
asked 10
the 10
professor 10
in 10
a 10
whisper 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
make 10
of 10
that 10
mark 10
on 10
her 10
throat 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
make 10
of 10
it 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
examined 10
it 10
yet 10
i 10
answered 10
and 10
then 10
and 10
there 10
proceeded 10
to 10
loose 10
the 10
band 10
just 10
over 10
the 10
external 10
jugular 10
vein 10
there 10
were 10
two 10
punctures 10
not 10
large 10
but 10
not 10
wholesome 10
looking 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
disease 10
but 10
the 10
edges 10
were 10
white 10
and 10
worn 10
looking 10
as 10
if 10
by 10
some 10
trituration 10
it 10
at 10
once 10
occurred 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
that 10
this 10
wound 10
or 10
whatever 10
it 10
was 10
might 10
be 10
the 10
means 10
of 10
that 10
manifest 10
loss 10
of 10
blood 10
but 10
i 10
abandoned 10
the 10
idea 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
it 10
formed 10
for 10
such 10
a 10
thing 10
could 10
not 10
be 10
the 10
whole 10
bed 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
drenched 10
to 10
a 10
scarlet 10
with 10
the 10
blood 10
which 10
the 10
girl 10
must 10
have 10
lost 10
to 10
leave 10
such 10
a 10
pallor 10
as 10
she 10
had 10
before 10
the 10
transfusion 10
well 10

up 10
i 10

he 10
answered 10
as 10
he 10
hurried 10
out 10
he 10
came 10
back 10
a 10
moment 10
later 10
and 10
put 10
his 10
head 10
inside 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
said 10

a 10
warning 10

with 10
lucy 10
the 10
opiate 10
worked 10
itself 10
off 10
towards 10
dusk 10
and 10
she 10
waked 10
naturally 10
she 10
looked 10
a 10
different 10
being 10
from 10
what 10
she 10
had 10
been 10
before 10
the 10
operation 10
her 10
spirits 10
even 10
were 10
good 10
and 10
she 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
a 10
happy 10
vivacity 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
evidences 10
of 10
the 10
absolute 10
prostration 10
which 10
she 10
had 10
undergone 10
when 10
i 10
told 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
that 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
directed 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
sit 10
up 10
with 10
her 10
she 10
almost 10
poohpoohed 10
the 10
idea 10
pointing 10
out 10
her 10
daughters 10
renewed 10
strength 10
and 10
excellent 10
spirits 10
i 10
was 10
firm 10
however 10
and 10
made 10
preparations 10
for 10
my 10
long 10
vigil 10
when 10
her 10
maid 10
had 10
prepared 10
her 10
for 10
the 10
night 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
having 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
had 10
supper 10
and 10
took 10
a 10
seat 10
by 10
the 10
bedside 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
make 10
objection 10
but 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
gratefully 10
whenever 10
i 10
caught 10
her 10
eye 10
after 10
a 10
long 10
spell 10
she 10
seemed 10
sinking 10
off 10
to 10
sleep 10
but 10
with 10
an 10
effort 10
seemed 10
to 10
pull 10
herself 10
together 10
and 10
shook 10
it 10
off 10
it 10
was 10
apparent 10
that 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
want 10
to 10
sleep 10
so 10
i 10
tackled 10
the 10
subject 10
at 10
once 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
want 10
to 10
sleep 10
no 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
afraid 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
sleep 10
why 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
boon 10
we 10
all 10
crave 10
for 10
ah 10
not 10
if 10
you 10
were 10
like 10
me 10
if 10
sleep 10
was 10
to 10
you 10
a 10
presage 10
of 10
horror 10
a 10
presage 10
of 10
horror 10
what 10
on 10
earth 10
do 10
you 10
mean 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
oh 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
and 10
that 10
is 10
what 10
is 10
so 10
terrible 10
all 10
this 10
weakness 10
comes 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
sleep 10
until 10
i 10
dread 10
the 10
very 10
thought 10
but 10
my 10
dear 10
girl 10
you 10
may 10
sleep 10
tonight 10
i 10
am 10
here 10
watching 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
promise 10
that 10
nothing 10
will 10
happen 10
ah 10
i 10
can 10
trust 10
you 10
she 10
said 10
i 10
seized 10
the 10
opportunity 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
promise 10
that 10
if 10
i 10
see 10
any 10
evidence 10
of 10
bad 10
dreams 10
i 10
will 10
wake 10
you 10
at 10
once 10
you 10
will 10
oh 10
will 10
you 10
really 10
how 10
good 10
you 10
are 10
to 10
me 10
then 10
i 10
will 10
sleep 10
and 10
almost 10
at 10
the 10
word 10
she 10
gave 10
a 10
deep 10
sigh 10
of 10
relief 10
and 10
sank 10
back 10
asleep 10
all 10
night 10
long 10
i 10
watched 10
by 10
her 10
she 10
never 10
stirred 10
but 10
slept 10
on 10
and 10
on 10
in 10
a 10
deep 10
tranquil 10
lifegiving 10
healthgiving 10
sleep 10
her 10
lips 10
were 10
slightly 10
parted 10
and 10
her 10
breast 10
rose 10
and 10
fell 10
with 10
the 10
regularity 10
of 10
a 10
pendulum 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
smile 10
on 10
her 10
face 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
no 10
bad 10
dreams 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
disturb 10
her 10
peace 10
of 10
mind 10
in 10
the 10
early 10
morning 10
her 10
maid 10
came 10
and 10
i 10
left 10
her 10
in 10
her 10
care 10
and 10
took 10
myself 10
back 10
home 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
anxious 10
about 10
many 10
things 10
i 10
sent 10
a 10
short 10
wire 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
to 10
arthur 10
telling 10
them 10
of 10
the 10
excellent 10
result 10
of 10
the 10
operation 10
my 10
own 10
work 10
with 10
its 10
manifold 10
arrears 10
took 10
me 10
all 10
day 10
to 10
clear 10
off 10
it 10
was 10
dark 10
when 10
i 10
was 10
able 10
to 10
inquire 10
about 10
my 10
zoophagous 10
patient 10
the 10
report 10
was 10
good 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
quite 10
quiet 10
for 10
the 10
past 10
day 10
and 10
night 10
a 10
telegram 10
came 10
from 10
van 10
helsing 10
at 10
amsterdam 10
whilst 10
i 10
was 10
at 10

pretty 10
tired 10

worn 10
out 10

to 10
hillingham 10
for 10
two 10
nights 10
i 10
had 10
hardly 10
had 10
a 10
wink 10
of 10
sleep 10
and 10
my 10
brain 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
feel 10
that 10
numbness 10
which 10
marks 10
cerebral 10
exhaustion 10
lucy 10
was 10
up 10
and 10
in 10
cheerful 10
spirits 10
when 10
she 10
shook 10
hands 10
with 10
me 10
she 10
looked 10
sharply 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
and 10
said 10

my 10
supper 10

came 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
enlivened 10
by 10
her 10
charming 10
presence 10
i 10
made 10
an 10
excellent 10
meal 10
and 10
had 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
glasses 10
of 10
the 10

a 10
room 10

where 10
a 10
cozy 10
fire 10
was 10

lie 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
for 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
nothing 10
would 10
induce 10
any 10
of 10
you 10
doctors 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
whilst 10
there 10

dog 10
tired 10
and 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
sat 10
up 10
had 10
i 10
tried 10
so 10
on 10
her 10
renewing 10
her 10
promise 10
to 10

septemberi 10
feel 10
so 10
happy 10
tonight 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
so 10
miserably 10
weak 10
that 10
to 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
think 10
and 10
move 10
about 10
is 10
like 10
feeling 10
sunshine 10
after 10
a 10
long 10
spell 10
of 10
east 10
wind 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
steel 10
sky 10
somehow 10
arthur 10
feels 10
very 10
very 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
seem 10
to 10
feel 10
his 10
presence 10
warm 10
about 10
me 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
that 10
sickness 10
and 10
weakness 10
are 10
selfish 10
things 10
and 10
turn 10
our 10
inner 10
eyes 10
and 10
sympathy 10
on 10
ourselves 10
whilst 10
health 10
and 10
strength 10
give 10
love 10
rein 10
and 10
in 10
thought 10
and 10
feeling 10
he 10
can 10
wander 10
where 10
he 10
wills 10
i 10
know 10
where 10
my 10
thoughts 10
are 10
if 10
only 10
arthur 10
knew 10
my 10
dear 10
my 10
dear 10
your 10
ears 10

tingle 10
as 10

do 10
waking 10
oh 10
the 10
blissful 10
rest 10
of 10

night 10
how 10

slept 10
with 10
that 10
dear 10
good 10
dr 10

watching 10
me 10
and 10
tonight 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
fear 10
to 10
sleep 10
since 10
he 10
is 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
and 10
within 10
call 10

everybody 10

was 10
conscious 10
of 10
the 10
professors 10
hand 10
on 10
my 10
head 10
and 10
started 10
awake 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
second 10
that 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
things 10
that 10
we 10
learn 10
in 10
an 10
asylum 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
and 10
how 10
is 10
our 10
patient 10
well 10
when 10
i 10
left 10
her 10
or 10
rather 10
when 10
she 10
left 10
me 10
i 10
answered 10
come 10
let 10
us 10
see 10
he 10
said 10
and 10
together 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
blind 10
was 10
down 10
and 10
i 10
went 10
over 10
to 10
raise 10
it 10
gently 10
whilst 10
van 10
helsing 10
stepped 10
with 10
his 10
soft 10
catlike 10
tread 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
bed 10
as 10
i 10
raised 10
the 10
blind 10
and 10
the 10
morning 10
sunlight 10
flooded 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
professors 10
low 10
hiss 10
of 10
inspiration 10
and 10
knowing 10
its 10
rarity 10
a 10
deadly 10
fear 10
shot 10
through 10
my 10
heart 10
as 10
i 10
passed 10
over 10
he 10
moved 10
back 10
and 10
his 10
exclamation 10
of 10
horror 10
gott 10
in 10
himmel 10
needed 10
no 10
enforcement 10
from 10
his 10
agonized 10
face 10
he 10
raised 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
pointed 10
to 10
the 10
bed 10
and 10
his 10
iron 10
face 10
was 10
drawn 10
and 10
ashen 10
white 10
i 10
felt 10
my 10
knees 10
begin 10
to 10
tremble 10
there 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
seemingly 10
in 10
a 10
swoon 10
lay 10
poor 10
lucy 10
more 10
horribly 10
white 10
and 10
wanlooking 10
than 10
ever 10
even 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
white 10
and 10
the 10
gums 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
shrunken 10
back 10
from 10
the 10
teeth 10
as 10
we 10
sometimes 10
see 10
in 10
a 10
corpse 10
after 10
a 10
prolonged 10
illness 10
van 10
helsing 10
raised 10
his 10
foot 10
to 10
stamp 10
in 10
anger 10
but 10
the 10
instinct 10
of 10
his 10
life 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
long 10
years 10
of 10
habit 10
stood 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
put 10
it 10
down 10
again 10
softly 10
quick 10
he 10
said 10
bring 10
the 10
brandy 10
i 10
flew 10
to 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
and 10
returned 10
with 10
the 10
decanter 10
he 10
wetted 10
the 10
poor 10
white 10
lips 10
with 10
it 10
and 10
together 10
we 10
rubbed 10
palm 10
and 10
wrist 10
and 10
heart 10
he 10
felt 10
her 10
heart 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
of 10
agonizing 10
suspense 10
said 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
too 10
late 10
it 10
beats 10
though 10
but 10
feebly 10
all 10
our 10
work 10
is 10
undone 10
we 10
must 10
begin 10
again 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
young 10
arthur 10
here 10
now 10
i 10
have 10
to 10
call 10
on 10
you 10
yourself 10
this 10
time 10
friend 10
john 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
was 10
dipping 10
into 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
producing 10
the 10
instruments 10
of 10
transfusion 10
i 10
had 10
taken 10
off 10
my 10
coat 10
and 10
rolled 10
up 10
my 10
shirt 10
sleeve 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
possibility 10
of 10
an 10
opiate 10
just 10
at 10
present 10
and 10
no 10
need 10
of 10
one 10
and 10
so 10
without 10
a 10
moments 10
delay 10
we 10
began 10
the 10
operation 10
after 10
a 10
time 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
a 10
short 10
time 10
either 10
for 10
the 10
draining 10
away 10
of 10
ones 10
blood 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
willingly 10
it 10
be 10
given 10
is 10
a 10
terrible 10
feeling 10
van 10
helsing 10
held 10
up 10
a 10
warning 10
finger 10
do 10
not 10
stir 10
he 10
said 10
but 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
with 10
growing 10
strength 10
she 10
may 10
wake 10
and 10
that 10
would 10
make 10
danger 10
oh 10
so 10
much 10
danger 10
but 10
i 10
shall 10
precaution 10
take 10
i 10
shall 10
give 10
hypodermic 10
injection 10
of 10
morphia 10
he 10
proceeded 10
then 10
swiftly 10
and 10
deftly 10
to 10
carry 10
out 10
his 10
intent 10
the 10
effect 10
on 10
lucy 10
was 10
not 10
bad 10
for 10
the 10
faint 10
seemed 10
to 10
merge 10
subtly 10
into 10
the 10
narcotic 10
sleep 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
a 10
feeling 10
of 10
personal 10
pride 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
a 10
faint 10
tinge 10
of 10
color 10
steal 10
back 10
into 10
the 10
pallid 10
cheeks 10
and 10
lips 10
no 10
man 10
knows 10
till 10
he 10
experiences 10
it 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
feel 10
his 10
own 10
lifeblood 10
drawn 10
away 10
into 10
the 10
veins 10
of 10
the 10
woman 10
he 10
loves 10
the 10
professor 10
watched 10
me 10
critically 10
that 10
will 10
do 10
he 10
said 10
already 10
i 10
remonstrated 10
you 10
took 10
a 10
great 10
deal 10
more 10
from 10
art 10
to 10
which 10
he 10
smiled 10
a 10
sad 10
sort 10
of 10
smile 10
as 10
he 10
replied 10
he 10
is 10
her 10
lover 10
her 10
fiance 10
you 10
have 10
work 10
much 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
for 10
her 10
and 10
for 10
others 10
and 10
the 10
present 10
will 10
suffice 10
when 10
we 10
stopped 10
the 10
operation 10
he 10
attended 10
to 10
lucy 10
whilst 10
i 10
applied 10
digital 10
pressure 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
incision 10
i 10
laid 10
down 10
while 10
i 10
waited 10
his 10
leisure 10
to 10
attend 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
faint 10
and 10
a 10
little 10
sick 10
by 10
and 10
by 10
he 10
bound 10
up 10
my 10
wound 10
and 10
sent 10
me 10
downstairs 10
to 10
get 10
a 10
glass 10
of 10
wine 10
for 10
myself 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
leaving 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
came 10
after 10
me 10
and 10
half 10
whispered 10
mind 10
nothing 10
must 10
be 10
said 10
of 10
this 10
if 10
our 10
young 10
lover 10
should 10
turn 10
up 10
unexpected 10
as 10
before 10
no 10
word 10
to 10
him 10
it 10
would 10
at 10
once 10
frighten 10
him 10
and 10
enjealous 10
him 10
too 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
none 10
so 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
carefully 10
and 10
then 10
said 10
you 10
are 10
not 10
much 10
the 10
worse 10
go 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
lie 10
on 10
your 10
sofa 10
and 10
rest 10
awhile 10
then 10
have 10
much 10
breakfast 10
and 10
come 10
here 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
followed 10
out 10
his 10
orders 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
how 10
right 10
and 10
wise 10
they 10
were 10
i 10
had 10
done 10
my 10
part 10
and 10
now 10
my 10
next 10
duty 10
was 10
to 10
keep 10
up 10
my 10
strength 10
i 10
felt 10
very 10
weak 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
weakness 10
lost 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
amazement 10
at 10
what 10
had 10
occurred 10
i 10
fell 10
asleep 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
however 10
wondering 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
again 10
how 10
lucy 10
had 10
made 10
such 10
a 10
retrograde 10
movement 10
and 10
how 10
she 10
could 10
have 10
been 10
drained 10
of 10
so 10
much 10
blood 10
with 10
no 10
sign 10
any 10
where 10
to 10
show 10
for 10
it 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
continued 10
my 10
wonder 10
in 10
my 10
dreams 10
for 10
sleeping 10
and 10
waking 10
my 10
thoughts 10
always 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
little 10
punctures 10
in 10
her 10
throat 10
and 10
the 10
ragged 10
exhausted 10
appearance 10
of 10
their 10
edges 10
tiny 10
though 10
they 10
were 10
lucy 10
slept 10
well 10
into 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
when 10
she 10
woke 10
she 10
was 10
fairly 10
well 10
and 10
strong 10
though 10
not 10
nearly 10
so 10
much 10
so 10
as 10
the 10
day 10
before 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
seen 10
her 10
he 10
went 10
out 10
for 10
a 10
walk 10
leaving 10
me 10
in 10
charge 10
with 10
strict 10
injunctions 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
to 10
leave 10
her 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
his 10
voice 10
in 10
the 10
hall 10
asking 10
the 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
nearest 10
telegraph 10
office 10
lucy 10
chatted 10
with 10
me 10
freely 10
and 10
seemed 10
quite 10
unconscious 10
that 10
anything 10
had 10
happened 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
keep 10
her 10
amused 10
and 10
interested 10
when 10
her 10
mother 10
came 10
up 10
to 10
see 10
her 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
notice 10
any 10
change 10
whatever 10
but 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
gratefully 10
we 10
owe 10
you 10
so 10
much 10
dr 10
seward 10
for 10
all 10
you 10
have 10
done 10
but 10
you 10
really 10
must 10
now 10
take 10
care 10
not 10
to 10
overwork 10
yourself 10
you 10
are 10
looking 10
pale 10
yourself 10
you 10
want 10
a 10
wife 10
to 10
nurse 10
and 10
look 10
after 10
you 10
a 10
bit 10
that 10
you 10
do 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
lucy 10
turned 10
crimson 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
momentarily 10
for 10
her 10
poor 10
wasted 10
veins 10
could 10
not 10
stand 10
for 10
long 10
an 10
unwonted 10
drain 10
to 10
the 10
head 10
the 10
reaction 10
came 10
in 10
excessive 10
pallor 10
as 10
she 10
turned 10
imploring 10
eyes 10
on 10
me 10
i 10
smiled 10
and 10
nodded 10
and 10
laid 10
my 10
finger 10
on 10
my 10
lips 10
with 10
a 10
sigh 10
she 10
sank 10
back 10
amid 10
her 10
pillows 10
van 10
helsing 10
returned 10
in 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
hours 10
and 10
presently 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
now 10
you 10
go 10
home 10
and 10
eat 10
much 10
and 10
drink 10
enough 10
make 10
yourself 10
strong 10
i 10
stay 10
here 10
tonight 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
sit 10
up 10
with 10
little 10
miss 10
myself 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
watch 10
the 10
case 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
have 10
none 10
other 10
to 10
know 10
i 10
have 10
grave 10
reasons 10
no 10
do 10
not 10
ask 10
the 10
think 10
what 10
you 10
will 10
do 10
not 10
fear 10
to 10
think 10
even 10
the 10
most 10
notimprobable 10
goodnight 10
in 10
the 10
hall 10
two 10
of 10
the 10
maids 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
asked 10
if 10
they 10
or 10
either 10
of 10
them 10
might 10
not 10
sit 10
up 10
with 10
miss 10
lucy 10
they 10
implored 10
me 10
to 10
let 10
them 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
said 10
it 10
was 10
dr 10
van 10
helsings 10
wish 10
that 10
either 10
he 10
or 10
i 10
should 10
sit 10
up 10
they 10
asked 10
me 10
quite 10
piteously 10
to 10
intercede 10
with 10
theforeign 10
gentleman 10
i 10
was 10
much 10
touched 10
by 10
their 10
kindness 10
perhaps 10
it 10
is 10
because 10
i 10
am 10
weak 10
at 10
present 10
and 10
perhaps 10
because 10
it 10
was 10
on 10
lucys 10
account 10
that 10
their 10
devotion 10
was 10
manifested 10
for 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
again 10
have 10
i 10
seen 10
similar 10
instances 10
of 10
womans 10
kindness 10
i 10
got 10
back 10
here 10
in 10
time 10
for 10
a 10
late 10
dinner 10
went 10
my 10
rounds 10
all 10
well 10
and 10
set 10
this 10
down 10
whilst 10
waiting 10
for 10
sleep 10
it 10
is 10
coming 10
septemberthis 10
afternoon 10
i 10
went 10
over 10
to 10
hillingham 10
found 10
van 10
helsing 10
in 10
excellent 10
spirits 10
and 10
lucy 10
much 10
better 10
shortly 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
arrived 10
a 10
big 10
parcel 10
from 10
abroad 10
came 10
for 10
the 10
professor 10
he 10
opened 10
it 10
with 10
much 10
impressment 10
assumed 10
of 10
course 10
and 10
showed 10
a 10
great 10
bundle 10
of 10
white 10
flowers 10
these 10
are 10
for 10
you 10
miss 10
lucy 10
he 10
said 10
for 10
me 10
oh 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
yes 10
my 10
dear 10
but 10

for 10
you 10
to 10
play 10
with 10
these 10
are 10
medicines 10
here 10
lucy 10
made 10
a 10
wry 10
face 10
nay 10
but 10
they 10
are 10
not 10
to 10
take 10
in 10
a 10
decoction 10
or 10
in 10
nauseous 10
form 10
so 10
you 10
need 10
not 10
snub 10
that 10
so 10
charming 10
nose 10
or 10
i 10
shall 10
point 10
out 10
to 10
my 10
friend 10
arthur 10
what 10
woes 10
he 10
may 10
have 10
to 10
endure 10
in 10
seeing 10
so 10
much 10
beauty 10
that 10
he 10
so 10

of 10

conquistadores 10

in 10
the 10
floridas 10
and 10
find 10
him 10
all 10
too 10
late 10
whilst 10

been 10
examining 10

disgust 10

you 10

only 10
putting 10

common 10
garlic 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
van 10
helsing 10
rose 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
with 10
all 10
his 10
sternness 10
his 10
iron 10
jaw 10
set 10
and 10
his 10
bushy 10
eyebrows 10
meeting 10
no 10
trifling 10
with 10
me 10
i 10
never 10
jest 10
there 10

the 10
sake 10
of 10
others 10
if 10
not 10
for 10
your 10
own 10
then 10
seeing 10
poor 10
lucy 10
scared 10
as 10
she 10
might 10
well 10
be 10

do 10
for 10
your 10
good 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
much 10
virtue 10
to 10
you 10
in 10
those 10
so 10
common 10
flowers 10
see 10
i 10
place 10
them 10
myself 10
in 10
your 10
room 10
i 10
make 10
myself 10
the 10
wreath 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
to 10
wear 10
but 10
hush 10
no 10
telling 10
to 10
others 10
that 10
make 10
so 10
inquisitive 10
questions 10
we 10
must 10
obey 10
and 10
silence 10
is 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
obedience 10
and 10
obedience 10
is 10
to 10
bring 10
you 10
strong 10
and 10
well 10
into 10
loving 10
arms 10
that 10
wait 10
for 10
you 10
now 10
sit 10
still 10
a 10
while 10
come 10
with 10
me 10
friend 10
john 10
and 10
you 10
shall 10
help 10
me 10
deck 10
the 10
room 10
with 10
my 10
garlic 10
which 10
is 10
all 10
the 10
war 10
from 10
haarlem 10
where 10
my 10
friend 10
vanderpool 10
raise 10
herb 10
in 10
his 10
glass 10
houses 10
all 10
the 10
year 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
telegraph 10
yesterday 10
or 10
they 10
would 10
not 10
have 10
been 10
here 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
taking 10
the 10
flowers 10
with 10
us 10
the 10
professors 10
actions 10
were 10
certainly 10
odd 10
and 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
found 10
in 10
any 10
pharmacopeia 10
that 10
i 10
ever 10
heard 10
of 10
first 10
he 10
fastened 10
up 10
the 10
windows 10
and 10
latched 10
them 10
securely 10
next 10
taking 10
a 10
handful 10
of 10
the 10
flowers 10
he 10
rubbed 10
them 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
sashes 10
as 10
though 10
to 10
ensure 10
that 10
every 10
whiff 10
of 10
air 10
that 10
might 10
get 10
in 10
would 10
be 10
laden 10
with 10
the 10
garlic 10
smell 10
then 10
with 10
the 10
wisp 10
he 10
rubbed 10
all 10
over 10
the 10
jamb 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
above 10
below 10
and 10
at 10
each 10
side 10
and 10
round 10
the 10
fireplace 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
way 10
it 10
all 10
seemed 10
grotesque 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
presently 10
i 10
said 10
well 10
professor 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
always 10
have 10
a 10
reason 10
for 10
what 10
you 10
do 10
but 10
this 10
certainly 10
puzzles 10
me 10
it 10
is 10
well 10
we 10
have 10
no 10
sceptic 10
here 10
or 10
he 10
would 10
say 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
working 10
some 10
spell 10
to 10
keep 10
out 10
an 10
evil 10
spirit 10
perhaps 10
i 10
am 10
he 10
answered 10
quietly 10
as 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
make 10
the 10
wreath 10
which 10
lucy 10
was 10
to 10
wear 10
round 10
her 10
neck 10
we 10
then 10
waited 10
whilst 10
lucy 10
made 10
her 10
toilet 10
for 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
when 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
bed 10
he 10
came 10
and 10
himself 10
fixed 10
the 10
wreath 10
of 10
garlic 10
round 10
her 10
neck 10
the 10
last 10
words 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
her 10
were 10
take 10
care 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
disturb 10
it 10
and 10
even 10

close 10

not 10
tonight 10

the 10

or 10

and 10

vague 10

frightened 10
me 10

was 10
so 10
fierce 10

against 10

so 10
often 10
of 10

the 10
pain 10
of 10

the 10

a 10
lovely 10

the 10
bright 10
sunshine 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
fresh 10
feeling 10
of 10
early 10
autumn 10
seemed 10
like 10
the 10
completion 10
of 10
natures 10
annual 10
work 10
the 10
leaves 10
were 10
turning 10

saw 10
her 10
but 10
did 10
not 10

lest 10

should 10
disturb 10
her 10
the 10
professor 10
smiled 10
and 10
looked 10
quite 10
jubilant 10
he 10
rubbed 10
his 10
hands 10
together 10
and 10

soundly 10

a 10
lot 10
of 10
those 10
horrible 10
strongsmelling 10
flowers 10
about 10
everywhere 10
and 10
she 10
had 10
actually 10
a 10
bunch 10
of 10
them 10
round 10
her 10
neck 10
i 10
feared 10
that 10
the 10
heavy 10
odor 10
would 10
be 10
too 10
much 10
for 10
the 10
dear 10
child 10
in 10
her 10
weak 10
state 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
them 10
all 10
away 10
and 10
opened 10
a 10
bit 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
to 10
let 10
in 10
a 10
little 10
fresh 10
air 10
you 10
will 10
be 10
pleased 10
with 10
her 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
she 10
moved 10
off 10
into 10
her 10
boudoir 10
where 10
she 10
usually 10
breakfasted 10
early 10
as 10
she 10
had 10
spoken 10
i 10
watched 10
the 10
professors 10
face 10
and 10
saw 10
it 10
turn 10
ashen 10
gray 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
retain 10
his 10
selfcommand 10
whilst 10
the 10
poor 10
lady 10
was 10
present 10
for 10
he 10
knew 10
her 10
state 10
and 10
how 10
mischievous 10
a 10
shock 10
would 10
be 10
he 10
actually 10
smiled 10
on 10
her 10
as 10
he 10
held 10
open 10
the 10
door 10
for 10
her 10
to 10
pass 10
into 10
her 10
room 10
but 10
the 10
instant 10
she 10
had 10
disappeared 10
he 10
pulled 10
me 10
suddenly 10
and 10
forcibly 10
into 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
and 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
then 10
for 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
in 10
my 10
life 10
i 10
saw 10
van 10
helsing 10
break 10
down 10
he 10
raised 10
his 10
hands 10
over 10
his 10
head 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
mute 10
despair 10
and 10
then 10
beat 10
his 10
palms 10
together 10
in 10
a 10
helpless 10
way 10
finally 10
he 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
a 10
chair 10
and 10
putting 10
his 10
hands 10
before 10
his 10
face 10
began 10
to 10
sob 10
with 10
loud 10
dry 10
sobs 10
that 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
from 10
the 10
very 10
racking 10
of 10
his 10
heart 10
then 10
he 10
raised 10
his 10
arms 10
again 10
as 10
though 10
appealing 10
to 10
the 10
whole 10
universe 10
god 10
god 10
god 10
he 10
said 10
what 10
have 10
we 10
done 10
what 10
has 10
this 10
poor 10
thing 10
done 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
so 10
sore 10
beset 10
is 10
there 10
fate 10
amongst 10
us 10
still 10
send 10
down 10
from 10
the 10
pagan 10
world 10
of 10
old 10
that 10
such 10
things 10
must 10
be 10
and 10
in 10
such 10
way 10
this 10
poor 10
mother 10
all 10
unknowing 10
and 10
all 10
for 10
the 10
best 10
as 10
she 10
think 10
does 10
such 10
thing 10
as 10
lose 10
her 10
daughter 10
body 10
and 10
soul 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
tell 10
her 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
even 10
warn 10
her 10
or 10
she 10
die 10
then 10
both 10
die 10
oh 10
how 10
we 10
are 10
beset 10
how 10
are 10
all 10
the 10
powers 10
of 10
the 10
devils 10
against 10
us 10
suddenly 10
he 10
jumped 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10
come 10
he 10
saidcome 10
we 10
must 10
see 10
and 10
act 10
devils 10
or 10
no 10
devils 10
or 10
all 10
the 10
devils 10
at 10
once 10
it 10
matters 10
not 10
we 10
must 10
fight 10
him 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
for 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
together 10
we 10
went 10
up 10
to 10
lucys 10
room 10
once 10
again 10
i 10
drew 10
up 10
the 10
blind 10
whilst 10
van 10
helsing 10
went 10
towards 10
the 10
bed 10
this 10
time 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
start 10
as 10
he 10
looked 10
on 10
the 10
poor 10
face 10
with 10
the 10
same 10
awful 10
waxen 10
pallor 10
as 10
before 10
he 10
wore 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
stern 10
sadness 10
and 10
infinite 10
pity 10
as 10
i 10
expected 10
he 10
murmured 10
with 10
that 10
hissing 10
inspiration 10
of 10
his 10
which 10
meant 10
so 10
much 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
went 10
and 10
locked 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
then 10
began 10
to 10
set 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
little 10
table 10
the 10
instruments 10
for 10
yet 10
another 10
operation 10
of 10
transfusion 10
of 10
blood 10
i 10
had 10
long 10
ago 10
recognized 10
the 10
necessity 10
and 10
begun 10
to 10
take 10
off 10
my 10
coat 10
but 10
he 10
stopped 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
warning 10
hand 10
no 10
he 10
said 10
today 10
you 10
must 10
operate 10
i 10
shall 10
provide 10
you 10
are 10
weakened 10
already 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
took 10
off 10
his 10
coat 10
and 10
rolled 10
up 10
his 10
shirtsleeve 10
again 10
the 10
operation 10
again 10
the 10
narcotic 10
again 10
some 10
return 10
of 10
color 10
to 10
the 10
ashy 10
cheeks 10
and 10
the 10
regular 10
breathing 10
of 10
healthy 10
sleep 10
this 10
time 10
i 10
watched 10
whilst 10
van 10
helsing 10
recruited 10
himself 10
and 10
rested 10
presently 10
he 10
took 10
an 10
opportunity 10
of 10
telling 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
that 10
she 10
must 10
not 10
remove 10
anything 10
from 10
lucys 10
room 10
without 10
consulting 10
him 10
that 10
the 10
flowers 10
were 10
of 10
medicinal 10
value 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
breathing 10
of 10
their 10
odor 10
was 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
system 10
of 10
cure 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
over 10
the 10
care 10
of 10
the 10
case 10
himself 10
saying 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
watch 10
this 10
night 10
and 10
the 10
next 10
and 10
would 10
send 10
me 10
word 10
when 10
to 10
come 10
after 10
another 10
hour 10
lucy 10
waked 10
from 10
her 10
sleep 10
fresh 10
and 10
bright 10
and 10
seemingly 10
not 10
much 10
the 10
worse 10
for 10
her 10
terrible 10
ordeal 10
what 10
does 10
it 10
all 10
mean 10
i 10
am 10
beginning 10
to 10
wonder 10
if 10
my 10
long 10
habit 10
of 10
life 10
amongst 10
the 10
insane 10
is 10
beginning 10
to 10
tell 10
upon 10
my 10
own 10
brain 10
lucy 10
westenras 10
diary 10
septemberfour 10
days 10
and 10
nights 10
of 10
peace 10
i 10
am 10
getting 10
so 10
strong 10
again 10
that 10
i 10
hardly 10
know 10
myself 10
it 10
is 10
as 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
passed 10
through 10
some 10
long 10
nightmare 10
and 10
had 10
just 10
awakened 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
beautiful 10
sunshine 10
and 10
feel 10
the 10
fresh 10
air 10
of 10
the 10
morning 10
around 10
me 10
i 10
have 10
a 10
dim 10
half 10
remembrance 10
of 10
long 10
anxious 10
times 10
of 10
waiting 10
and 10
fearing 10
darkness 10
in 10
which 10
there 10
was 10
not 10
even 10
the 10
pain 10
of 10
hope 10
to 10
make 10
present 10
distress 10
more 10
poignant 10
and 10
then 10
long 10
spells 10
of 10
oblivion 10
and 10
the 10
rising 10
back 10
to 10
life 10
as 10
a 10
diver 10
coming 10
up 10
through 10
a 10
great 10
press 10
of 10
water 10
since 10
however 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
has 10
been 10
with 10
me 10
all 10
this 10
bad 10
dreaming 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
passed 10
away 10
the 10
noises 10
that 10
used 10
to 10
frighten 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
my 10
wits 10
the 10
flapping 10
against 10
the 10
windows 10
the 10
distant 10
voices 10
which 10
seemed 10
so 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
the 10
harsh 10
sounds 10
that 10
came 10
from 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
where 10
and 10
commanded 10
me 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
what 10
have 10
all 10
ceased 10
i 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
now 10
without 10
any 10
fear 10
of 10

do 10
not 10
even 10
try 10
to 10
keep 10
awake 10
i 10
have 10
grown 10
quite 10
fond 10
of 10
the 10
garlic 10
and 10
a 10
boxful 10

in 10
his 10

lot 10
of 10

asleep 10

i 10
did 10
not 10
fear 10
to 10

again 10
although 10
the 10
boughs 10
or 10
bats 10
or 10
something 10
flapped 10

angrily 10

the 10
wolf 10
well 10
sir 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
a 10
suspicious 10
sort 10
of 10
modesty 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
can 10
but 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
as 10
ow 10
youd 10
be 10
satisfied 10
with 10
the 10
theory 10
certainly 10
i 10
shall 10
if 10
a 10
man 10
like 10
you 10
who 10
knows 10
the 10
animals 10
from 10
experience 10
cant 10
hazard 10
a 10
good 10
guess 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
who 10
is 10
even 10
to 10
try 10
well 10
then 10
sir 10
i 10
accounts 10
for 10
it 10
this 10
way 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
ere 10
wolf 10
escapedsimply 10
because 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
get 10
out 10
from 10
the 10
hearty 10
way 10
that 10
both 10
thomas 10
and 10
his 10
wife 10
laughed 10
at 10
the 10
joke 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
it 10
had 10
done 10
service 10
before 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
whole 10
explanation 10
was 10
simply 10
an 10
elaborate 10
sell 10
i 10
couldnt 10
cope 10
in 10
badinage 10
with 10
the 10
worthy 10
thomas 10
but 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
knew 10
a 10
surer 10
way 10
to 10
his 10
heart 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
now 10
mr 10

babby 10
the 10
less 10
thats 10
all 10
i 10
was 10
handing 10
him 10
the 10
halfsovereign 10
when 10
something 10
came 10
bobbing 10
up 10
against 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
mr 10
bilders 10
face 10
doubled 10
its 10
natural 10
length 10
with 10
surprise 10
god 10
bless 10
me 10
he 10
said 10
if 10
there 10
aint 10
old 10
bersicker 10
come 10
back 10
by 10
isself 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
opened 10
it 10
a 10
most 10
unnecessary 10
proceeding 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
have 10
always 10
thought 10
that 10
a 10
wild 10
animal 10
never 10
looks 10
so 10
well 10
as 10
when 10
some 10
obstacle 10
of 10
pronounced 10
durability 10
is 10
between 10
us 10
a 10
personal 10
experience 10
has 10
intensified 10
rather 10
than 10
diminished 10
that 10
idea 10
after 10
all 10
however 10
there 10
is 10
nothing 10
like 10
custom 10
for 10
neither 10
bilder 10
nor 10
his 10
wife 10
thought 10
any 10
more 10
of 10
the 10
wolf 10
than 10
i 10
should 10
of 10
a 10
dog 10
the 10
animal 10
itself 10
was 10
a 10
peaceful 10
and 10
wellbehaved 10
as 10

the 10
whole 10
scene 10
was 10
a 10
unutterable 10
mixture 10
of 10
comedy 10
and 10
pathos 10
the 10
wicked 10
wolf 10
that 10
for 10
a 10
half 10
a 10
day 10
had 10
paralyzed 10
london 10

engaged 10
after 10
dinner 10
in 10
my 10
study 10
posting 10
up 10
my 10
books 10
which 10
through 10
press 10
of 10
other 10
work 10
and 10
the 10
many 10
visits 10
to 10
lucy 10
had 10
fallen 10
sadly 10
into 10
arrear 10
suddenly 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
burst 10
open 10
and 10
in 10
rushed 10
my 10
patient 10
with 10
his 10
face 10
distorted 10
with 10
passion 10
i 10
was 10
thunderstruck 10
for 10
such 10
a 10
thing 10
as 10
a 10
patient 10
getting 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
accord 10
into 10
the 10
superintendents 10
study 10
is 10
almost 10
unknown 10
without 10
an 10
instants 10
notice 10
he 10
made 10
straight 10
at 10
me 10
he 10
had 10
a 10
dinner 10
knife 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
saw 10
he 10
was 10
dangerous 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
keep 10
the 10
table 10
between 10
us 10
he 10
was 10
too 10
quick 10
and 10
too 10
strong 10
for 10
me 10
however 10
for 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
my 10
balance 10
he 10
had 10
struck 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
cut 10
my 10
left 10
wrist 10
rather 10
severely 10
before 10
he 10
could 10
strike 10
again 10
however 10
i 10
got 10
in 10
my 10
right 10
hand 10
and 10
he 10
was 10
sprawling 10
on 10
his 10
back 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
my 10
wrist 10
bled 10
freely 10
and 10
quite 10
a 10
little 10
pool 10
trickled 10
on 10
to 10
the 10
carpet 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
my 10
friend 10
was 10
not 10
intent 10
on 10
further 10
effort 10
and 10
occupied 10
myself 10
binding 10
up 10
my 10
wrist 10
keeping 10
a 10
wary 10
eye 10
on 10
the 10
prostrate 10
figure 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
when 10
the 10
attendants 10
rushed 10
in 10
and 10
we 10
turned 10
our 10
attention 10
to 10
him 10
his 10
employment 10
positively 10
sickened 10
me 10
he 10
was 10
lying 10
on 10
his 10
belly 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
licking 10
up 10
like 10
a 10
dog 10
the 10
blood 10
which 10
had 10
fallen 10
from 10
my 10
wounded 10
wrist 10
he 10
was 10
easily 10
secured 10
and 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
went 10
with 10
the 10
attendants 10
quite 10
placidly 10
simply 10
repeating 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
again 10
the 10
blood 10
is 10
the 10
life 10
the 10
blood 10
is 10
the 10
life 10

afford 10
to 10
lose 10

night 10
of 10
course 10
it 10
is 10
possible 10
that 10
all 10
may 10
be 10
well 10
but 10
what 10
may 10
have 10
happened 10
surely 10
there 10
is 10
some 10
horrible 10
doom 10
hanging 10
over 10
us 10
that 10
every 10
possible 10
accident 10
should 10
thwart 10
us 10
in 10
all 10
we 10
try 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
this 10
cylinder 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
can 10
complete 10
my 10

write 10
this 10
and 10
leave 10
it 10
to 10
be 10
seen 10
so 10
that 10
no 10
one 10
may 10
by 10
any 10
chance 10
get 10
into 10
trouble 10
through 10
me 10
this 10
is 10
an 10
exact 10
record 10
of 10
what 10
took 10
place 10
tonight 10
i 10
feel 10
i 10
am 10
dying 10
of 10
weakness 10
and 10
have 10
barely 10
strength 10
to 10
write 10
but 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
done 10
if 10
i 10
die 10
in 10
the 10
doing 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
as 10
usual 10
taking 10
care 10
that 10
the 10
flowers 10
were 10
placed 10
as 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
directed 10
and 10
soon 10
fell 10
asleep 10
i 10
was 10
waked 10
by 10
the 10
flapping 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
which 10
had 10
begun 10
after 10
that 10
sleepwalking 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
at 10
whitby 10
when 10
mina 10
saved 10
me 10
and 10
which 10
now 10
i 10
know 10
so 10
well 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
afraid 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
wish 10
that 10
dr 10
seward 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
next 10
room 10
as 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
he 10
would 10
be 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
have 10
called 10
him 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
sleep 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
then 10
there 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
the 10
old 10
fear 10
of 10
sleep 10
and 10
i 10
determined 10
to 10
keep 10
awake 10
perversely 10
sleep 10
would 10
try 10
to 10
come 10
then 10
when 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
want 10
it 10
so 10
as 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
be 10
alone 10
i 10
opened 10
my 10
door 10
and 10
called 10
out 10
is 10
there 10
anybody 10
there 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
answer 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
to 10
wake 10
mother 10
and 10
so 10
closed 10
my 10
door 10
again 10
then 10
outside 10
in 10
the 10
shrubbery 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
howl 10
like 10
a 10
dogs 10
but 10
more 10
fierce 10
and 10
deeper 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
but 10
could 10
see 10
nothing 10
except 10
a 10
big 10
bat 10
which 10
had 10
evidently 10
been 10
buffeting 10
its 10
wings 10
against 10
the 10
window 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
bed 10
again 10
but 10
determined 10
not 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
sleep 10
presently 10
the 10
door 10
opened 10
and 10
mother 10
looked 10
in 10
seeing 10
by 10
my 10
moving 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
asleep 10
she 10
came 10
in 10
and 10
sat 10
by 10
me 10
she 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
even 10
more 10
sweetly 10
and 10
softly 10
than 10
her 10
wont 10
i 10
was 10
uneasy 10
about 10
you 10
darling 10
and 10
came 10
in 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
all 10
right 10
i 10
feared 10
she 10
might 10
catch 10
cold 10
sitting 10
there 10
and 10
asked 10
her 10
to 10
come 10
in 10
and 10
sleep 10
with 10
me 10
so 10
she 10
came 10
into 10
bed 10
and 10
lay 10
down 10
beside 10
me 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
take 10
off 10
her 10
dressing 10
gown 10
for 10
she 10
said 10
she 10
would 10
only 10
stay 10
a 10
while 10
and 10
then 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
her 10
own 10
bed 10
as 10
she 10
lay 10
there 10
in 10
my 10
arms 10
and 10
i 10
in 10
hers 10
the 10
flapping 10
and 10
buffeting 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
again 10
she 10
was 10
startled 10
and 10
a 10
little 10
frightened 10
and 10
cried 10
out 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
pacify 10
her 10
and 10
at 10
last 10
succeeded 10
and 10
she 10
lay 10
quiet 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
her 10
poor 10
dear 10
heart 10
still 10
beating 10
terribly 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
there 10
was 10
the 10
howl 10
again 10
out 10
in 10
the 10
shrubbery 10
and 10
shortly 10
after 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
crash 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
broken 10
glass 10
was 10
hurled 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
the 10
window 10
blind 10
blew 10
back 10
with 10
the 10
wind 10
that 10
rushed 10
in 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
aperture 10
of 10
the 10
broken 10
panes 10
there 10
was 10
the 10
head 10
of 10
a 10
great 10
gaunt 10
gray 10
wolf 10
mother 10
cried 10
out 10
in 10
a 10
fright 10
and 10
struggled 10
up 10
into 10
a 10
sitting 10
posture 10
and 10
clutched 10
wildly 10
at 10
anything 10
that 10
would 10
help 10
her 10
amongst 10
other 10
things 10
she 10
clutched 10
the 10
wreath 10
of 10
flowers 10
that 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
insisted 10
on 10
my 10
wearing 10
round 10
my 10
neck 10
and 10
tore 10
it 10
away 10
from 10
me 10
for 10
a 10
second 10
or 10
two 10
she 10
sat 10
up 10
pointing 10
at 10
the 10
wolf 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
strange 10
and 10
horrible 10
gurgling 10
in 10
her 10
throat 10
then 10
she 10
fell 10
over 10
as 10
if 10
struck 10
with 10
lightning 10
and 10
her 10
head 10
hit 10
my 10
forehead 10
and 10
made 10
me 10
dizzy 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
or 10
two 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
all 10
round 10
seemed 10
to 10
spin 10
round 10
i 10
kept 10
my 10
eyes 10
fixed 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
but 10
the 10
wolf 10
drew 10
his 10
head 10
back 10
and 10
a 10
whole 10
myriad 10
of 10
little 10
specks 10
seems 10
to 10
come 10
blowing 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
broken 10
window 10
and 10
wheeling 10
and 10
circling 10
round 10
like 10
the 10
pillar 10
of 10
dust 10
that 10
travellers 10
describe 10
when 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
simoon 10
in 10
the 10
desert 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
stir 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
spell 10
upon 10
me 10
and 10
dear 10
mothers 10
poor 10
body 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
grow 10
cold 10
already 10
for 10
her 10
dear 10
heart 10
had 10
ceased 10
to 10
beat 10
weighed 10
me 10
down 10
and 10
i 10
remembered 10
no 10
more 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
the 10
time 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
long 10
but 10
very 10
very 10
awful 10
till 10
i 10
recovered 10
consciousness 10
again 10
somewhere 10
near 10
a 10
passing 10
bell 10
was 10
tolling 10
the 10
dogs 10
all 10
round 10
the 10
neighborhood 10
were 10
howling 10
and 10
in 10
our 10
shrubbery 10
seemingly 10
just 10
outside 10
a 10
nightingale 10
was 10
singing 10
i 10
was 10
dazed 10
and 10
stupid 10
with 10
pain 10
and 10
terror 10
and 10
weakness 10
but 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
the 10
nightingale 10
seemed 10
like 10
the 10
voice 10
of 10
my 10
dead 10
mother 10
come 10
back 10
to 10
comfort 10
me 10
the 10
sounds 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
awakened 10
the 10
maids 10
too 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
their 10
bare 10
feet 10
pattering 10
outside 10
my 10
door 10
i 10
called 10
to 10
them 10
and 10
they 10
came 10
in 10
and 10
when 10
they 10
saw 10
what 10
had 10
happened 10
and 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
lay 10
over 10
me 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
they 10
screamed 10
out 10
the 10
wind 10
rushed 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
broken 10
window 10
and 10
the 10
door 10
slammed 10
to 10
they 10
lifted 10
off 10
the 10
body 10
of 10
my 10
dear 10
mother 10
and 10
laid 10
her 10
covered 10
up 10
with 10
a 10
sheet 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
got 10
up 10
they 10
were 10
all 10
so 10
frightened 10
and 10
nervous 10
that 10
i 10
directed 10
them 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
and 10
each 10
have 10
a 10
glass 10
of 10
wine 10
the 10
door 10
flew 10
open 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
and 10
closed 10
again 10
the 10
maids 10
shrieked 10
and 10
then 10
went 10
in 10
a 10
body 10
to 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
and 10
i 10
laid 10
what 10
flowers 10
i 10
had 10
on 10
my 10
dear 10
mothers 10
breast 10
when 10
they 10
were 10
there 10
i 10
remembered 10
what 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
told 10
me 10
but 10
i 10
didnt 10
like 10
to 10
remove 10
them 10
and 10
besides 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
servants 10
to 10
sit 10
up 10
with 10
me 10
now 10
i 10
was 10
surprised 10
that 10
the 10
maids 10
did 10
not 10
come 10
back 10
i 10
called 10
them 10
but 10
got 10
no 10
answer 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
to 10
look 10
for 10
them 10
my 10
heart 10
sank 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
what 10
had 10
happened 10
they 10
all 10
four 10
lay 10
helpless 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
breathing 10
heavily 10
the 10
decanter 10
of 10
sherry 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
half 10
full 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
queer 10
acrid 10
smell 10
about 10
i 10
was 10
suspicious 10
and 10
examined 10
the 10
decanter 10
it 10
smelt 10
of 10
laudanum 10
and 10
looking 10
on 10
the 10
sideboard 10
i 10
found 10
that 10
the 10
bottle 10
which 10
mothers 10
doctor 10
uses 10
for 10
her 10
oh 10

to 10

back 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
with 10
mother 10
i 10
cannot 10
leave 10
her 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
alone 10

for 10
the 10
sleeping 10
servants 10
whom 10
some 10
one 10
has 10
drugged 10
alone 10
with 10
the 10
dead 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
go 10
out 10
for 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
the 10
low 10
howl 10
of 10
the 10
wolf 10
through 10
the 10
broken 10
window 10
the 10

the 10

from 10

septemberi 10
drove 10
at 10
once 10
to 10
hillingham 10
and 10
arrived 10
early 10
keeping 10
my 10
cab 10
at 10
the 10
gate 10
i 10
went 10
up 10
the 10
avenue 10
alone 10
i 10
knocked 10
gently 10
and 10
rang 10
as 10
quietly 10
as 10
possible 10
for 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
disturb 10
lucy 10
or 10
her 10
mother 10
and 10
hoped 10
to 10
only 10
bring 10
a 10
servant 10
to 10
the 10
door 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
finding 10
no 10
response 10
i 10
knocked 10
and 10
rang 10
again 10
still 10
no 10
answer 10
i 10
cursed 10
the 10
laziness 10
of 10
the 10
servants 10
that 10
they 10
should 10
lie 10
abed 10
at 10
such 10
an 10
hour 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
ten 10
oclock 10
and 10
so 10
rang 10
and 10
knocked 10
again 10
but 10
more 10
impatiently 10
but 10
still 10
without 10
response 10
hitherto 10
i 10
had 10
blamed 10
only 10
the 10
servants 10
but 10
now 10
a 10
terrible 10
fear 10
began 10
to 10
assail 10
me 10
was 10
this 10
desolation 10
but 10
another 10
link 10
in 10
the 10
chain 10
of 10
doom 10
which 10
seemed 10
drawing 10
tight 10
round 10
us 10
was 10
it 10
indeed 10
a 10
house 10
of 10
death 10
to 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
come 10
too 10
late 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
minutes 10
even 10
seconds 10
of 10
delay 10
might 10
mean 10
hours 10
of 10
danger 10
to 10
lucy 10
if 10
she 10
had 10
had 10
again 10
one 10
of 10
those 10
frightful 10
relapses 10
and 10
i 10
went 10
round 10
the 10
house 10
to 10
try 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
by 10
chance 10
an 10
entry 10
anywhere 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
no 10
means 10
of 10
ingress 10
every 10
window 10
and 10
door 10
was 10
fastened 10
and 10
locked 10
and 10
i 10
returned 10
baffled 10
to 10
the 10
porch 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
rapid 10
pitpat 10
of 10
a 10
swiftly 10
driven 10
horses 10
feet 10
they 10
stopped 10
at 10
the 10
gate 10
and 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
later 10
i 10
met 10

paused 10
and 10
raised 10
his 10
hat 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
solemnly 10
then 10

us 10
now 10
we 10
went 10
round 10
to 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
where 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
kitchen 10
window 10
the 10
professor 10
took 10
a 10
small 10
surgical 10
saw 10
from 10
his 10
case 10
and 10
handing 10
it 10
to 10
me 10
pointed 10
to 10
the 10
iron 10
bars 10
which 10
guarded 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
attacked 10
them 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
had 10
very 10
soon 10
cut 10
through 10
three 10
of 10
them 10
then 10
with 10
a 10
long 10
thin 10
knife 10
we 10
pushed 10
back 10
the 10
fastening 10
of 10
the 10
sashes 10
and 10
opened 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
helped 10
the 10
professor 10
in 10
and 10
followed 10
him 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
kitchen 10
or 10
in 10
the 10
servants 10
rooms 10
which 10
were 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
we 10
tried 10
all 10
the 10
rooms 10
as 10
we 10
went 10
along 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
dimly 10
lit 10
by 10
rays 10
of 10
light 10
through 10
the 10
shutters 10
found 10
four 10
servant 10
women 10
lying 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
need 10
to 10
think 10
them 10
dead 10
for 10
their 10
stertorous 10
breathing 10
and 10
the 10
acrid 10
smell 10
of 10
laudanum 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
left 10
no 10
doubt 10
as 10
to 10
their 10
condition 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
each 10
other 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
moved 10
away 10
he 10
said 10
we 10
can 10
attend 10
to 10
them 10
laterthen 10
we 10
ascended 10
to 10
lucys 10
room 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
or 10
two 10
we 10
paused 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
to 10
listen 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sound 10
that 10
we 10
could 10
hear 10
with 10
white 10
faces 10
and 10
trembling 10
hands 10
we 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
gently 10
and 10
entered 10
the 10
room 10
how 10
shall 10
i 10
describe 10
what 10
we 10
saw 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
lay 10
two 10
women 10
lucy 10
and 10
her 10
mother 10
the 10
latter 10
lay 10
farthest 10
in 10
and 10
she 10
was 10
covered 10
with 10
a 10
white 10
sheet 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
blown 10
back 10
by 10
the 10
drought 10
through 10
the 10
broken 10
window 10
showing 10
the 10
drawn 10
white 10
face 10
with 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
terror 10
fixed 10
upon 10
it 10
by 10
her 10
side 10
lay 10
lucy 10
with 10
face 10
white 10
and 10
still 10
more 10
drawn 10
the 10
flowers 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
round 10
her 10
neck 10
we 10
found 10
upon 10
her 10
mothers 10
bosom 10
and 10
her 10
throat 10
was 10
bare 10
showing 10
the 10
two 10
little 10
wounds 10
which 10
we 10
had 10
noticed 10
before 10
but 10
looking 10
horribly 10
white 10
and 10
mangled 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
the 10
professor 10
bent 10
over 10
the 10
bed 10
his 10
head 10
almost 10
touching 10
poor 10
lucys 10
breast 10
then 10
he 10
gave 10
a 10
quick 10
turn 10
of 10
his 10
head 10
as 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
listens 10
and 10
leaping 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10
he 10
cried 10
out 10
to 10
me 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
yet 10
too 10
late 10
quick 10
quick 10
bring 10
the 10
brandy 10
i 10
flew 10
downstairs 10
and 10
returned 10
with 10
it 10
taking 10
care 10
to 10
smell 10
and 10
taste 10
it 10
lest 10
it 10
too 10
were 10
drugged 10
like 10
the 10
decanter 10
of 10
sherry 10
which 10
i 10
found 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
the 10
maids 10
were 10
still 10
breathing 10
but 10
more 10
restlessly 10
and 10
i 10
fancied 10
that 10
the 10
narcotic 10
was 10
wearing 10
off 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
stay 10
to 10
make 10
sure 10
but 10
returned 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
he 10
rubbed 10
the 10
brandy 10
as 10
on 10
another 10
occasion 10
on 10
her 10
lips 10
and 10
gums 10
and 10
on 10
her 10
wrists 10
and 10
the 10
palms 10
of 10
her 10
hands 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
can 10
do 10
this 10
all 10
that 10
can 10
be 10
at 10
the 10
present 10
you 10
go 10
wake 10
those 10
maids 10
flick 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
with 10
a 10
wet 10
towel 10
and 10
flick 10
them 10
hard 10
make 10
them 10
get 10
heat 10
and 10
fire 10
and 10
a 10
warm 10
bath 10
this 10
poor 10
soul 10
is 10
nearly 10
as 10
cold 10
as 10
that 10
beside 10
her 10
she 10
will 10
need 10
be 10
heated 10
before 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
anything 10
more 10
i 10
went 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
found 10
little 10
difficulty 10
in 10
waking 10
three 10
of 10
the 10
women 10
the 10
fourth 10
was 10
only 10
a 10
young 10
girl 10
and 10
the 10
drug 10
had 10
evidently 10
affected 10
her 10
more 10
strongly 10
so 10
i 10
lifted 10
her 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
and 10
let 10
her 10
sleep 10
the 10
others 10
were 10
dazed 10
at 10
first 10
but 10
as 10
remembrance 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
them 10
they 10
cried 10
and 10
sobbed 10
in 10
a 10
hysterical 10
manner 10
i 10
was 10
stern 10
with 10
them 10
however 10
and 10
would 10
not 10
let 10
them 10
talk 10
i 10
told 10
them 10
that 10
one 10
life 10
was 10
bad 10
enough 10
to 10
lose 10
and 10
if 10
they 10
delayed 10
they 10
would 10
sacrifice 10
miss 10
lucy 10
so 10
sobbing 10
and 10
crying 10
they 10
went 10
about 10
their 10
way 10
half 10
clad 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
and 10
prepared 10
fire 10
and 10
water 10
fortunately 10
the 10
kitchen 10
and 10
boiler 10
fires 10
were 10
still 10
alive 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
lack 10
of 10
hot 10
water 10
we 10
got 10
a 10
bath 10
and 10
carried 10
lucy 10
out 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
and 10
placed 10
her 10
in 10
it 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
busy 10
chafing 10
her 10
limbs 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
knock 10
at 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
maids 10
ran 10
off 10
hurried 10
on 10
some 10
more 10
clothes 10
and 10
opened 10
it 10
then 10
she 10
returned 10
and 10
whispered 10
to 10
us 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
gentleman 10
who 10
had 10
come 10
with 10
a 10
message 10
from 10
mr 10
holmwood 10
i 10
bade 10
her 10
simply 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
wait 10
for 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
no 10
one 10
now 10
she 10
went 10
away 10
with 10
the 10
message 10
and 10
engrossed 10
with 10
our 10
work 10
i 10
clean 10
forgot 10
all 10
about 10
him 10
i 10
never 10
saw 10
in 10
all 10
my 10
experience 10
the 10
professor 10
work 10
in 10
such 10
deadly 10
earnest 10
i 10
knew 10
as 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
standup 10
fight 10
with 10
death 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
pause 10
told 10
him 10
so 10
he 10
answered 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
understand 10
but 10
with 10
the 10
sternest 10
look 10
that 10
his 10
face 10
could 10
wear 10
if 10
that 10
were 10
all 10
i 10
would 10
stop 10
here 10
where 10
we 10
are 10
now 10
and 10
let 10
her 10
fade 10
away 10
into 10
peace 10
for 10
i 10
see 10
no 10
light 10
in 10
life 10
over 10
her 10
horizon 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
his 10
work 10
with 10
if 10
possible 10
renewed 10
and 10
more 10
frenzied 10
vigour 10
presently 10
we 10
both 10
began 10
to 10
be 10
conscious 10
that 10
the 10
heat 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
be 10
of 10
some 10
effect 10
lucys 10
heart 10
beat 10
a 10
trifle 10
more 10
audibly 10
to 10
the 10
stethoscope 10
and 10
her 10
lungs 10
had 10
a 10
perceptible 10
movement 10
van 10
helsings 10
face 10
almost 10
beamed 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
lifted 10
her 10
from 10
the 10
bath 10
and 10
rolled 10
her 10
in 10
a 10
hot 10
sheet 10
to 10
dry 10
her 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
the 10
first 10
gain 10
is 10
ours 10
check 10
to 10
the 10
king 10
we 10
took 10
lucy 10
into 10
another 10
room 10
which 10
had 10
by 10
now 10
been 10
prepared 10
and 10
laid 10
her 10
in 10
bed 10
and 10
forced 10
a 10
few 10
drops 10
of 10
brandy 10
down 10
her 10
throat 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
van 10
helsing 10
tied 10
a 10
soft 10
silk 10
handkerchief 10
round 10
her 10
throat 10
she 10
was 10
still 10
unconscious 10
and 10
was 10
quite 10
as 10
bad 10
as 10
if 10
not 10
worse 10
than 10
we 10
had 10
ever 10
seen 10
her 10
van 10
helsing 10
called 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
women 10
and 10
told 10
her 10
to 10
stay 10
with 10
her 10
and 10
not 10
to 10
take 10
her 10
eyes 10
off 10
her 10
till 10
we 10
returned 10
and 10
then 10
beckoned 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
we 10
must 10
consult 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
he 10
said 10
as 10
we 10
descended 10
the 10
stairs 10
in 10
the 10
hall 10
he 10
opened 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
door 10
and 10
we 10
passed 10
in 10
he 10
closing 10
the 10
door 10
carefully 10
behind 10
him 10
the 10
shutters 10
had 10
been 10
opened 10
but 10
the 10
blinds 10
were 10
already 10
down 10
with 10
that 10
obedience 10
to 10
the 10
etiquette 10
of 10
death 10
which 10
the 10
british 10
woman 10
of 10
the 10
lower 10
classes 10
always 10
rigidly 10
observes 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
therefore 10
dimly 10
dark 10
it 10
was 10
however 10
light 10
enough 10
for 10
our 10
purposes 10
van 10
helsings 10
sternness 10
was 10
somewhat 10
relieved 10
by 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
perplexity 10
he 10
was 10
evidently 10
torturing 10
his 10
mind 10
about 10
something 10
so 10
i 10
waited 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
and 10
he 10
spoke 10
what 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
do 10
now 10
where 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
turn 10
for 10
help 10
we 10
must 10
have 10
another 10
transfusion 10
of 10
blood 10
and 10
that 10
soon 10
or 10
that 10
poor 10
girls 10
life 10
wont 10
be 10
worth 10
an 10
hours 10
purchase 10
you 10
are 10
exhausted 10
already 10
i 10
am 10
exhausted 10
too 10
i 10
fear 10
to 10
trust 10
those 10
women 10
even 10
if 10
they 10
would 10
have 10
courage 10
to 10
submit 10
what 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
do 10
for 10
some 10
one 10
who 10
will 10
open 10
his 10
veins 10
for 10
her 10
whats 10
the 10
matter 10
with 10
me 10
anyhow 10
the 10
voice 10
came 10
from 10
the 10
sofa 10
across 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
its 10
tones 10
brought 10
relief 10
and 10
joy 10
to 10
my 10
heart 10
for 10
they 10
were 10
those 10
of 10
quincey 10
morris 10
van 10
helsing 10
started 10
angrily 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
sound 10
but 10
his 10
face 10
softened 10
and 10
a 10
glad 10
look 10
came 10
into 10
his 10
eyes 10
as 10
i 10
cried 10
out 10
quincey 10
morris 10
and 10
rushed 10
towards 10
him 10
with 10
outstretched 10
hands 10
what 10
brought 10
you 10
her 10
i 10
cried 10
as 10
our 10
hands 10
met 10
i 10
guess 10
art 10
is 10
the 10
cause 10

handed 10
me 10
a 10
telegramhave 10

van 10
helsing 10
strode 10
forward 10
and 10
took 10
his 10
hand 10
looking 10
him 10
straight 10
in 10
the 10
eyes 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
a 10
brave 10
mans 10
blood 10
is 10
the 10
best 10
thing 10
on 10
this 10
earth 10
when 10
a 10
woman 10
is 10
in 10
trouble 10
youre 10
a 10
man 10
and 10

devil 10

work 10
against 10
us 10

worth 10
but 10
god 10

us 10
men 10
when 10
we 10
want 10
them 10
once 10
again 10
we 10
went 10
through 10
that 10
ghastly 10
operation 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
the 10
heart 10
to 10
go 10
through 10
with 10
the 10
details 10
lucy 10
had 10
got 10
a 10
terrible 10
shock 10
and 10
it 10
told 10
on 10
her 10
more 10
than 10
before 10
for 10
though 10
plenty 10
of 10
blood 10
went 10
into 10
her 10
veins 10
her 10
body 10
did 10
not 10
respond 10
to 10
the 10
treatment 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
occasions 10
her 10
struggle 10
back 10
into 10
life 10
was 10
something 10
frightful 10
to 10
see 10
and 10
hear 10
however 10
the 10
action 10
of 10
both 10
heart 10
and 10
lungs 10
improved 10
and 10
van 10
helsing 10
made 10
a 10
subcutaneous 10
injection 10
of 10
morphia 10
as 10
before 10
and 10
with 10
good 10
effect 10
her 10
faint 10
became 10
a 10
profound 10
slumber 10
the 10
professor 10
watched 10
whilst 10
i 10
went 10
downstairs 10
with 10
quincey 10
morris 10
and 10
sent 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
maids 10
to 10
pay 10
off 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
cabmen 10
who 10
were 10
waiting 10
i 10
left 10
quincey 10
lying 10
down 10
after 10
having 10
a 10
glass 10
of 10
wine 10
and 10
told 10
the 10
cook 10
to 10
get 10
ready 10
a 10
good 10
breakfast 10
then 10
a 10
thought 10
struck 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
room 10
where 10
lucy 10
now 10
was 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
softly 10
in 10
i 10
found 10
van 10
helsing 10
with 10
a 10
sheet 10
or 10
two 10
of 10
note 10
paper 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
read 10
it 10
and 10
was 10
thinking 10
it 10
over 10
as 10
he 10
sat 10
with 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
his 10
brow 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
grim 10
satisfaction 10
in 10
his 10
face 10
as 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
has 10
had 10
a 10
doubt 10
solved 10
he 10
handed 10
me 10
the 10
paper 10
saying 10
only 10
it 10
dropped 10
from 10
lucys 10
breast 10
when 10
we 10
carried 10
her 10
to 10
the 10
bath 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
read 10
it 10
i 10
stook 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
pause 10
asked 10
him 10
in 10
gods 10
name 10
what 10
does 10
it 10
all 10
mean 10
was 10
she 10
or 10
is 10
she 10
mad 10
or 10
what 10
sort 10
of 10
horrible 10
danger 10
is 10
it 10
i 10
was 10
so 10
bewildered 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
say 10
more 10
van 10
helsing 10
put 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
took 10
the 10
paper 10
saying 10
do 10
not 10
trouble 10
about 10
it 10
now 10
forget 10
if 10
for 10
the 10
present 10
you 10
shall 10
know 10
and 10
understand 10
it 10
all 10
in 10
good 10
time 10
but 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
later 10
and 10
now 10
what 10
is 10
it 10
that 10
you 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
say 10
this 10
brought 10
me 10
back 10
to 10
fact 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
all 10
myself 10
again 10
i 10
came 10
to 10
speak 10
about 10
the 10
certificate 10
of 10
death 10
if 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
act 10
properly 10
and 10
wisely 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
an 10
inquest 10
and 10
that 10
paper 10
would 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
produced 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
hopes 10
that 10
we 10
need 10
have 10
no 10
inquest 10
for 10
if 10
we 10
had 10
it 10
would 10
surely 10
kill 10
poor 10
lucy 10
if 10
nothing 10
else 10
did 10
i 10
know 10
and 10
you 10
know 10
and 10
the 10
other 10
doctor 10
who 10
attended 10
her 10
knows 10
that 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
had 10
disease 10
of 10
the 10
heart 10
and 10
we 10
can 10
certify 10
that 10
she 10
died 10
of 10
it 10
let 10
us 10
fill 10
up 10
the 10
certificate 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
it 10
myself 10
to 10
the 10
registrar 10
and 10
go 10
on 10
to 10
the 10
undertaker 10
good 10
oh 10

in 10

with 10
her 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
where 10
i 10
was 10
going 10
and 10
he 10
hurried 10
me 10
out 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
going 10
said 10
when 10

i 10
have 10
two 10
words 10
with 10
you 10
all 10
to 10
ourselves 10
i 10
nodded 10
in 10
reply 10
and 10
went 10
out 10
i 10
found 10
no 10
difficulty 10
about 10
the 10
registration 10
and 10
arranged 10
with 10
the 10
local 10
undertaker 10
to 10
come 10
up 10
in 10
the 10
evening 10
to 10
measure 10
for 10
the 10
coffin 10
and 10
to 10
make 10
arrangements 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
back 10
quincey 10
was 10
waiting 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
i 10
would 10
see 10
him 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
i 10
knew 10
about 10
lucy 10
and 10
went 10
up 10
to 10
her 10
room 10
she 10
was 10
still 10
sleeping 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
seemingly 10
had 10
not 10
moved 10
from 10
his 10
seat 10
at 10
her 10
side 10
from 10
his 10
putting 10
his 10
finger 10
to 10
his 10
lips 10
i 10
gathered 10
that 10
he 10
expected 10
her 10
to 10
wake 10
before 10
long 10
and 10
was 10
afraid 10
of 10
forestalling 10
nature 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
down 10
to 10
quincey 10
and 10
took 10
him 10
into 10
the 10
breakfast 10
room 10
where 10
the 10
blinds 10
were 10
not 10
drawn 10
down 10
and 10
which 10
was 10
a 10
little 10
more 10
cheerful 10
or 10
rather 10
less 10
cheerless 10
than 10
the 10
other 10
rooms 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
alone 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
jack 10
seward 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
to 10
shove 10
myself 10
in 10
anywhere 10
where 10
ive 10
no 10
right 10
to 10
be 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
no 10
ordinary 10
case 10
you 10
know 10
i 10
loved 10
that 10
girl 10
and 10
wanted 10
to 10
marry 10
her 10
but 10
although 10
thats 10
all 10
past 10
and 10
gone 10
i 10
cant 10
help 10
feeling 10
anxious 10
about 10
her 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
what 10
is 10
it 10
thats 10
wrong 10
with 10
her 10
the 10
dutchman 10
and 10
a 10
fine 10
old 10
fellow 10
is 10
is 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
that 10
said 10
that 10
time 10
you 10
two 10
came 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
that 10
you 10
must 10
have 10
another 10
transfusion 10
of 10
blood 10
and 10
that 10
both 10
you 10
and 10
he 10
were 10
exhausted 10
now 10
i 10
know 10
well 10
that 10
you 10
medical 10
men 10
speak 10
in 10
camera 10
and 10
that 10
a 10
man 10
must 10
not 10
expect 10
to 10
know 10
what 10
they 10
consult 10
about 10
in 10
private 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
no 10
common 10
matter 10
and 10
whatever 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
have 10
done 10
my 10
part 10
is 10
not 10
that 10
so 10
thats 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
take 10
it 10
that 10
both 10
you 10
and 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
done 10
already 10
what 10
i 10
did 10
today 10
is 10
not 10
that 10
so 10
thats 10
so 10
and 10
i 10
guess 10
art 10
was 10
in 10
it 10
too 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
four 10
days 10
ago 10
down 10
at 10
his 10
own 10
place 10
he 10
looked 10
queer 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
seen 10
anything 10
pulled 10
down 10
so 10
quick 10
since 10
i 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
pampas 10
and 10
had 10
a 10
mare 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
fond 10
of 10
go 10
to 10
grass 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
night 10
one 10
of 10
those 10
big 10
bats 10
that 10
they 10
call 10
vampires 10
had 10
got 10
at 10
her 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
what 10
with 10
his 10
gorge 10
and 10
the 10
vein 10
left 10
open 10
there 10
wasnt 10
enough 10
blood 10
in 10
her 10
to 10
let 10
her 10
stand 10
up 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
put 10
a 10
bullet 10
through 10
her 10
as 10
she 10
lay 10
jack 10
if 10
you 10
may 10
tell 10
me 10
without 10
betraying 10
confidence 10
arthur 10
was 10
the 10
first 10
is 10
not 10
that 10
so 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
looked 10
terribly 10
anxious 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
torture 10
of 10
suspense 10
regarding 10
the 10
woman 10
he 10
loved 10
and 10
his 10
utter 10
ignorance 10
of 10
the 10
terrible 10
mystery 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
surround 10
her 10
intensified 10
his 10
pain 10
his 10
very 10
heart 10
was 10
bleeding 10
and 10
it 10
took 10
all 10
the 10
manhood 10
of 10
him 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
royal 10
lot 10
of 10
it 10
too 10
to 10
keep 10
him 10
from 10
breaking 10
down 10
i 10
paused 10
before 10
answering 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
betray 10
anything 10
which 10
the 10
professor 10
wished 10
kept 10
secret 10
but 10
already 10
he 10
knew 10
so 10
much 10
and 10
guessed 10
so 10
much 10
that 10
there 10
could 10
be 10
no 10
reason 10
for 10
not 10
answering 10
so 10
i 10
answered 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
phrase 10
thats 10
so 10
and 10
how 10
long 10
has 10
this 10
been 10
going 10
on 10
about 10
ten 10
days 10
ten 10
days 10
then 10
i 10
guess 10
jack 10
seward 10
that 10
that 10
poor 10
pretty 10
creature 10
that 10
we 10
all 10
love 10
has 10
had 10
put 10
into 10
her 10
veins 10
within 10
that 10
time 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
four 10
strong 10
men 10
man 10
alive 10
her 10
whole 10
body 10
wouldnt 10
hold 10
it 10
then 10
coming 10
close 10
to 10
me 10
he 10
spoke 10
in 10
a 10
fierce 10
halfwhisper 10
what 10
took 10
it 10
out 10
i 10
shook 10
my 10
head 10
that 10
i 10
said 10
is 10
the 10
crux 10
van 10
helsing 10
is 10
simply 10
frantic 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
at 10
my 10
wits 10
end 10
i 10
cant 10
even 10
hazard 10
a 10
guess 10
there 10
has 10
been 10
a 10
series 10
of 10
little 10
circumstances 10
which 10
have 10
thrown 10
out 10
all 10
our 10
calculations 10
as 10
to 10
lucy 10
being 10
properly 10
watched 10
but 10
these 10
shall 10
not 10
occur 10
again 10
here 10
we 10
stay 10
until 10
all 10
be 10
well 10
or 10
ill 10
quincey 10
held 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
count 10
me 10
in 10
he 10
said 10
you 10
and 10
the 10
dutchman 10
will 10
tell 10
me 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
ill 10
do 10
it 10
when 10
she 10
woke 10
late 10
in 10
the 10
afternoon 10
lucys 10
first 10
movement 10
was 10
to 10
feel 10
in 10
her 10
breast 10
and 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
produced 10
the 10
paper 10
which 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
given 10
me 10
to 10
read 10
the 10
careful 10
professor 10
had 10
replaced 10
it 10
where 10
it 10
had 10
come 10
from 10
lest 10
on 10
waking 10
she 10
should 10
be 10
alarmed 10
her 10
eyes 10
then 10
lit 10
on 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
on 10
me 10
too 10
and 10
gladdened 10
then 10
she 10
looked 10
round 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
seeing 10
where 10
she 10
was 10
shuddered 10
she 10
gave 10
a 10
loud 10
cry 10
and 10
put 10
her 10
poor 10
thin 10
hands 10
before 10
her 10
pale 10
face 10
we 10
both 10
understood 10
what 10
was 10
meant 10
that 10
she 10
had 10
realized 10
to 10
the 10
full 10
her 10
mothers 10
death 10
so 10
we 10
tried 10
what 10
we 10
could 10
to 10
comfort 10
her 10
doubtless 10
sympathy 10
eased 10
her 10
somewhat 10
but 10
she 10
was 10
very 10
low 10
in 10
thought 10
and 10
spirit 10
and 10
wept 10
silently 10
and 10
weakly 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
we 10
told 10
her 10
that 10
either 10
or 10
both 10
of 10
us 10
would 10
now 10
remain 10
with 10
her 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
and 10
that 10
seemed 10
to 10
comfort 10
her 10
towards 10
dusk 10
she 10
fell 10
into 10
a 10
doze 10
here 10
a 10
very 10
odd 10
thing 10
occurred 10
whilst 10
still 10
asleep 10
she 10
took 10
the 10
paper 10
from 10
her 10
breast 10
and 10
tore 10
it 10
in 10
two 10
van 10
helsing 10
stepped 10
over 10
and 10
took 10
the 10
pieces 10
from 10
her 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
however 10
she 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
the 10
action 10
of 10
tearing 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
material 10
were 10
still 10
in 10
her 10
hands 10
finally 10
she 10
lifted 10
her 10
hands 10
and 10
opened 10
them 10
as 10
though 10
scattering 10
the 10
fragments 10
van 10
helsing 10
seemed 10
surprised 10
and 10
his 10
brows 10
gathered 10
as 10
if 10
in 10
thought 10
but 10
he 10
said 10
nothing 10
septemberall 10
last 10
night 10
she 10
slept 10
fitfully 10
being 10
always 10
afraid 10
to 10
sleep 10
and 10
something 10
weaker 10
when 10
she 10
woke 10
from 10
it 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
i 10
took 10
in 10
turns 10
to 10
watch 10
and 10
we 10
never 10
left 10
her 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
unattended 10
quincey 10
morris 10
said 10
nothing 10
about 10
his 10
intention 10
but 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
all 10
night 10
long 10
he 10
patrolled 10
round 10
and 10
round 10
the 10
house 10
when 10
the 10
day 10
came 10
its 10
searching 10
light 10
showed 10
the 10
ravages 10
in 10
poor 10
lucys 10
strength 10
she 10
was 10
hardly 10
able 10
to 10
turn 10
her 10
head 10
and 10
the 10
little 10
nourishment 10
which 10
she 10
could 10
take 10
seemed 10
to 10
do 10
her 10
no 10
good 10
at 10
times 10
she 10
slept 10
and 10
both 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
noticed 10
the 10
difference 10
in 10
her 10
between 10
sleeping 10
and 10
waking 10
whilst 10
asleep 10
she 10
looked 10
stronger 10
although 10
more 10
haggard 10
and 10
her 10
breathing 10
was 10
softer 10
her 10
open 10
mouth 10
showed 10
the 10
pale 10
gums 10
drawn 10
back 10
from 10
the 10
teeth 10
which 10
looked 10
positively 10
longer 10
and 10
sharper 10
than 10
usual 10
when 10
she 10
woke 10
the 10
softness 10
of 10
her 10
eyes 10
evidently 10
changed 10
the 10
expression 10
for 10
she 10
looked 10
her 10
own 10
self 10
although 10
a 10
dying 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
afternoon 10
she 10
asked 10
for 10
arthur 10
and 10
we 10
telegraphed 10
for 10
him 10
quincey 10
went 10
off 10
to 10
meet 10
him 10
at 10
the 10
station 10
when 10
he 10
arrived 10
it 10
was 10
nearly 10
six 10
oclock 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
setting 10
full 10
and 10
warm 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
light 10
streamed 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
gave 10
more 10
color 10
to 10
the 10
pale 10
cheeks 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
her 10
arthur 10
was 10
simply 10
choking 10
with 10
emotion 10
and 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
could 10
speak 10
in 10
the 10
hours 10
that 10
had 10
passed 10
the 10
fits 10
of 10
sleep 10
or 10
the 10
comatose 10
condition 10
that 10
passed 10
for 10
it 10
had 10
grown 10
more 10
frequent 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
pauses 10
when 10
conversation 10
was 10
possible 10
were 10
shortened 10
arthurs 10
presence 10
however 10
seemed 10
to 10
act 10
as 10
a 10
stimulant 10
she 10
rallied 10
a 10
little 10
and 10
spoke 10
to 10
him 10
more 10
brightly 10
than 10
she 10
had 10
done 10
since 10
we 10
arrived 10
he 10
too 10
pulled 10
himself 10
together 10
and 10
spoke 10
as 10
cheerily 10
as 10
he 10
could 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
best 10
was 10
made 10
of 10
everything 10
it 10
is 10
now 10
nearly 10
one 10
oclock 10
and 10
he 10
and 10
van 10
helsing 10
are 10
sitting 10
with 10
her 10
i 10

to 10

a 10

in 10
a 10
sudden 10

in 10
my 10
charge 10
with 10
regard 10
to 10
patient 10
renfield 10
there 10
is 10
more 10
to 10
say 10
he 10
has 10
had 10
another 10
outbreak 10
which 10
might 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
dreadful 10
ending 10
but 10
which 10
as 10
it 10
fortunately 10
happened 10
was 10
unattended 10
with 10
any 10
unhappy 10
results 10
this 10
afternoon 10
a 10
carriers 10
cart 10
with 10
two 10
men 10
made 10
a 10
call 10
at 10
the 10
empty 10
house 10
whose 10
grounds 10
abut 10
on 10
ours 10
the 10
house 10
to 10
which 10
you 10
will 10
remember 10
the 10
patient 10
twice 10
ran 10
away 10
the 10
men 10
stopped 10
at 10
our 10
gate 10
to 10
ask 10
the 10
porter 10
their 10
way 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
strangers 10
i 10
was 10
myself 10
looking 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
study 10
window 10
having 10
a 10
smoke 10
after 10
dinner 10
and 10
saw 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
come 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
as 10
he 10
passed 10
the 10
window 10
of 10
renfields 10
room 10
the 10
patient 10
began 10
to 10
rate 10
him 10
from 10
within 10
and 10
called 10
him 10
all 10
the 10
foul 10
names 10
he 10
could 10
lay 10
his 10
tongue 10
to 10
the 10
man 10
who 10
seemed 10
a 10
decent 10
fellow 10
enough 10
contented 10
himself 10
by 10
telling 10
him 10
to 10
shut 10
up 10
for 10
a 10
foulmouthed 10
beggar 10
whereon 10
our 10
man 10
accused 10
him 10
of 10
robbing 10
him 10
and 10
wanting 10
to 10
murder 10
him 10
and 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
hinder 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
to 10
swing 10
for 10
it 10
i 10
opened 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
signed 10
to 10
the 10
man 10
not 10
to 10
notice 10
so 10
he 10
contented 10
himself 10
after 10
looking 10
the 10
place 10
over 10
and 10
making 10
up 10
his 10
mind 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
kind 10
of 10
place 10
he 10
had 10
got 10
to 10
by 10
saying 10
lor 10
bless 10
yer 10
sir 10
i 10
wouldnt 10
mind 10
what 10
was 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
bloomin 10
madhouse 10
i 10
pity 10
ye 10
and 10
the 10
guvnor 10
for 10
havin 10
to 10
live 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
with 10
a 10
wild 10
beast 10
like 10
that 10
then 10
he 10
asked 10
his 10
way 10
civilly 10
enough 10
and 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
where 10
the 10
gate 10
of 10
the 10
empty 10
house 10
was 10
he 10
went 10
away 10
followed 10
by 10
threats 10
and 10
curses 10
and 10
revilings 10
from 10
our 10
man 10
i 10
went 10
down 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
make 10
out 10
any 10
cause 10
for 10
his 10
anger 10
since 10
he 10
is 10
usually 10
such 10
a 10
wellbehaved 10
man 10
and 10
except 10
his 10
violent 10
fits 10
nothing 10
of 10
the 10
kind 10
had 10
ever 10
occurred 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
to 10
my 10
astonishment 10
quite 10
composed 10
and 10
most 10
genial 10
in 10
his 10
manner 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
get 10
him 10
to 10
talk 10
of 10
the 10
incident 10
but 10
he 10
blandly 10
asked 10
me 10
questions 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
i 10
meant 10
and 10
led 10
me 10
to 10
believe 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
completely 10
oblivious 10
of 10
the 10
affair 10
it 10
was 10
i 10
am 10
sorry 10
to 10
say 10
however 10
only 10
another 10
instance 10
of 10
his 10
cunning 10
for 10
within 10
half 10
an 10
hour 10
i 10
heard 10
of 10
him 10
again 10
this 10
time 10
he 10
had 10
broken 10
out 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
of 10
his 10
room 10
and 10
was 10
running 10
down 10
the 10
avenue 10
i 10
called 10
to 10
the 10
attendants 10
to 10
follow 10
me 10
and 10
ran 10
after 10
him 10
for 10
i 10
feared 10
he 10
was 10
intent 10
on 10
some 10
mischief 10
my 10
fear 10
was 10
justified 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
same 10
cart 10
which 10
had 10
passed 10
before 10
coming 10
down 10
the 10
road 10
having 10
on 10
it 10
some 10
great 10
wooden 10
boxes 10
the 10
men 10
were 10
wiping 10
their 10
foreheads 10
and 10
were 10
flushed 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
as 10
if 10
with 10
violent 10
exercise 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
up 10
to 10
him 10
the 10
patient 10
rushed 10
at 10
them 10
and 10
pulling 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
off 10
the 10
cart 10
began 10
to 10
knock 10
his 10
head 10
against 10
the 10
ground 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
seized 10
him 10
just 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
i 10
believe 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
killed 10
the 10
man 10
there 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
other 10
fellow 10
jumped 10
down 10
and 10
struck 10
him 10
over 10
the 10
head 10
with 10
the 10
butt 10
end 10
of 10
his 10
heavy 10
whip 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
horrible 10
blow 10
but 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
mind 10
it 10
but 10
seized 10
him 10
also 10
and 10
struggled 10
with 10
the 10
three 10
of 10
us 10
pulling 10
us 10
to 10
and 10
fro 10
as 10
if 10
we 10
were 10
kittens 10
you 10
know 10
i 10
am 10
no 10
lightweight 10
and 10
the 10
others 10
were 10
both 10
burly 10
men 10
at 10
first 10
he 10
was 10
silent 10
in 10
his 10
fighting 10
but 10
as 10
we 10
began 10
to 10
master 10
him 10
and 10
the 10
attendants 10
were 10
putting 10
a 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
on 10
him 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
shout 10
ill 10
frustrate 10
them 10
they 10
shant 10
rob 10
me 10
they 10
shant 10
murder 10
me 10
by 10
inches 10
ill 10
fight 10
for 10
my 10
lord 10
and 10
masterand 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
similar 10
incoherent 10
ravings 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
very 10
considerable 10
difficulty 10
that 10
they 10
got 10
him 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
and 10
put 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
padded 10
room 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
attendants 10
hardy 10
had 10
a 10
finger 10
broken 10
however 10
i 10
set 10
it 10
all 10
right 10
and 10
he 10
is 10
going 10
on 10
well 10
the 10
two 10
carriers 10
were 10
at 10
first 10
loud 10
in 10
their 10
threats 10
of 10
actions 10
for 10
damages 10
and 10
promised 10
to 10
rain 10
all 10
the 10
penalties 10
of 10
the 10
law 10
on 10
us 10
their 10
threats 10
were 10
however 10
mingled 10
with 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
indirect 10
apology 10
for 10
the 10
defeat 10
of 10
the 10
two 10
of 10
them 10
by 10
a 10
feeble 10
madman 10
they 10
said 10
that 10
if 10
it 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
for 10
the 10
way 10
their 10
strength 10
had 10
been 10
spent 10
in 10
carrying 10
and 10
raising 10
the 10
heavy 10
boxes 10
to 10
the 10
cart 10
they 10
would 10
have 10
made 10
short 10
work 10
of 10
him 10
they 10
gave 10
as 10
another 10
reason 10
for 10
their 10
defeat 10
the 10
extraordinary 10
state 10
of 10
drouth 10
to 10
which 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
reduced 10
by 10
the 10
dusty 10
nature 10
of 10
their 10
occupation 10
and 10
the 10
reprehensible 10
distance 10
from 10
the 10
scene 10
of 10
their 10
labors 10
of 10
any 10
place 10
of 10
public 10
entertainment 10
i 10
quite 10
understood 10
their 10
drift 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
stiff 10
glass 10
of 10
strong 10
grog 10
or 10
rather 10
more 10
of 10
the 10
same 10
and 10
with 10
each 10
a 10
sovereign 10
in 10
hand 10
they 10
made 10
light 10
of 10
the 10
attack 10
and 10
swore 10
that 10
they 10
would 10
encounter 10
a 10
worse 10
madman 10
any 10
day 10
for 10
the 10
pleasure 10
of 10
meeting 10

befallen 10
us 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
has 10
died 10
very 10
suddenly 10
some 10
may 10
not 10
think 10
it 10
so 10
sad 10
for 10
us 10
but 10
we 10
had 10
both 10
come 10
to 10
so 10
love 10
him 10
that 10
it 10
really 10
seems 10
as 10
though 10
we 10
had 10
lost 10
a 10
father 10
i 10
never 10
knew 10
either 10
father 10
or 10
mother 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
dear 10
old 10
mans 10
death 10
is 10
a 10
real 10
blow 10
to 10
me 10
jonathan 10
is 10
greatly 10
distressed 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
only 10
that 10
he 10
feels 10
sorrow 10
deep 10
sorrow 10
for 10
the 10
dear 10
good 10
man 10
who 10
has 10
befriended 10
him 10
all 10
his 10
life 10
and 10
now 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
has 10
treated 10
him 10
like 10
his 10
own 10
son 10
and 10
left 10
him 10
a 10
fortune 10
which 10
to 10
people 10
of 10
our 10
modest 10
bringing 10
up 10
is 10
wealth 10
beyond 10
the 10
dream 10
of 10
avarice 10
but 10
jonathan 10
feels 10
it 10
on 10
another 10
account 10
he 10
says 10
the 10
amount 10
of 10
responsibility 10
which 10
it 10
puts 10
upon 10
him 10
makes 10
him 10
nervous 10
he 10
begins 10
to 10
doubt 10
himself 10
i 10
try 10
to 10
cheer 10
him 10
up 10
and 10
my 10
belief 10
in 10
him 10
helps 10
him 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
belief 10
in 10
himself 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
here 10
that 10
the 10
grave 10
shock 10
that 10
he 10
experienced 10
tells 10
upon 10
him 10
the 10
most 10
oh 10
it 10
is 10
too 10
hard 10
that 10
a 10
sweet 10
simple 10
noble 10
strong 10
nature 10
such 10
as 10
his 10
a 10
nature 10
which 10
enabled 10

rise 10

to 10
master 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
years 10

be 10
so 10
injured 10

the 10
very 10
essence 10
of 10
its 10
strength 10
is 10
gone 10

miserable 10
too 10
low 10
spirited 10
too 10
sick 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
all 10
in 10
it 10
including 10
life 10
itself 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
care 10
if 10
i 10
heard 10
this 10
moment 10
the 10
flapping 10
of 10
the 10
wings 10
of 10
the 10
angel 10
of 10
death 10
and 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
flapping 10
those 10
grim 10
wings 10
to 10
some 10
purpose 10
of 10
late 10

also 10
but 10
he 10
refused 10
at 10
first 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
when 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
want 10
him 10
to 10
help 10
us 10
during 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
that 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
all 10
break 10
down 10
for 10
want 10
of 10
rest 10
lest 10

he 10
said 10
come 10
with 10
me 10
you 10
are 10
sick 10
and 10
weak 10
and 10
have 10
had 10
much 10
sorrow 10
and 10
much 10
mental 10
pain 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
that 10
tax 10
on 10
your 10
strength 10
that 10
we 10
know 10
of 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
be 10
alone 10
for 10
to 10
be 10
alone 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
full 10
of 10
fears 10
and 10
alarms 10
come 10
to 10
the 10
drawing 10
room 10
where 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
big 10
fire 10
and 10
there 10
are 10
two 10
sofas 10

shall 10
lie 10
on 10
one 10
and 10
i 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
and 10
our 10
sympathy 10
will 10
be 10
comfort 10
to 10
each 10
other 10
even 10
though 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
speak 10
and 10
even 10
if 10
we 10
sleep 10
arthur 10
went 10
off 10
with 10
him 10
casting 10
back 10
a 10
longing 10
look 10
on 10
lucys 10
face 10
which 10
lay 10
in 10
her 10
pillow 10
almost 10
whiter 10
than 10
the 10
lawn 10
she 10
lay 10
quite 10
still 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
around 10
the 10
room 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
all 10
was 10
as 10
it 10
should 10
be 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
carried 10
out 10
in 10
this 10
room 10
as 10
in 10
the 10
other 10
his 10
purpose 10
of 10
using 10
the 10
garlic 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
sashes 10
reeked 10
with 10
it 10
and 10
round 10
lucys 10
neck 10
over 10
the 10
silk 10
handkerchief 10
which 10
van 10
helsing 10
made 10
her 10
keep 10
on 10
was 10
a 10
rough 10
chaplet 10
of 10
the 10
same 10
odorous 10
flowers 10
lucy 10
was 10
breathing 10
somewhat 10
stertorously 10
and 10
her 10
face 10
was 10
at 10
its 10
worst 10
for 10
the 10
open 10
mouth 10
showed 10
the 10
pale 10
gums 10
her 10
teeth 10
in 10
the 10
dim 10
uncertain 10
light 10
seemed 10
longer 10
and 10
sharper 10
than 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
in 10
particular 10
by 10
some 10
trick 10
of 10
the 10
light 10
the 10
canine 10
teeth 10
looked 10
longer 10
and 10
sharper 10
than 10
the 10
rest 10
i 10
sat 10
down 10
beside 10
her 10
and 10
presently 10
she 10
moved 10
uneasily 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
moment 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
dull 10
flapping 10
or 10
buffeting 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
went 10
over 10
to 10
it 10
softly 10
and 10
peeped 10
out 10
by 10
the 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
blind 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
full 10
moonlight 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
noise 10
was 10
made 10
by 10
a 10
great 10
bat 10
which 10
wheeled 10
around 10
doubtless 10
attracted 10
by 10
the 10
light 10
although 10
so 10
dim 10
and 10
every 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
struck 10
the 10
window 10
with 10
its 10
wings 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
my 10
seat 10
i 10
found 10
that 10
lucy 10
had 10
moved 10
slightly 10
and 10
had 10
torn 10
away 10
the 10
garlic 10
flowers 10
from 10
her 10
throat 10
i 10
replaced 10
them 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
and 10
sat 10
watching 10
her 10
presently 10
she 10
woke 10
and 10
i 10
gave 10
her 10
food 10
as 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
prescribed 10
she 10
took 10
but 10
a 10
little 10
and 10
that 10
languidly 10
there 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
be 10
with 10
her 10
now 10
the 10
unconscious 10
struggle 10
for 10
life 10
and 10
strength 10
that 10
had 10
hitherto 10
so 10
marked 10
her 10
illness 10
it 10
struck 10
me 10
as 10
curious 10
that 10
the 10
moment 10
she 10
became 10
conscious 10
she 10
pressed 10
the 10
garlic 10
flowers 10
close 10
to 10
her 10
it 10
was 10
certainly 10
odd 10
that 10
whenever 10
she 10
got 10
into 10
that 10
lethargic 10
state 10
with 10
the 10
stertorous 10
breathing 10
she 10
put 10
the 10
flowers 10
from 10
her 10
but 10
that 10
when 10
she 10
waked 10
she 10
clutched 10
them 10
close 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
possibility 10
of 10
making 10
amy 10
mistake 10
about 10
this 10
for 10
in 10
the 10
long 10
hours 10
that 10
followed 10
she 10
had 10
many 10
spells 10
of 10
sleeping 10
and 10
waking 10
and 10
repeated 10
both 10
actions 10
many 10
times 10
at 10
six 10
oclock 10
van 10
helsing 10
came 10
to 10
relieve 10
me 10
arthur 10
had 10
then 10
fallen 10
into 10
a 10
doze 10
and 10
he 10
mercifully 10
let 10
him 10
sleep 10
on 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
lucys 10
face 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
sissing 10
indraw 10
of 10
breath 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
sharp 10
whisperdraw 10
up 10
the 10
blind 10
i 10
want 10
light 10
then 10
he 10
bent 10
down 10
and 10
with 10
his 10
face 10
almost 10
touching 10
lucys 10
examined 10
her 10
carefully 10
he 10
removed 10
the 10
flowers 10
and 10
lifted 10
the 10
silk 10
handkerchief 10
from 10
her 10
throat 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
so 10
he 10
started 10
back 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
his 10
ejaculation 10
mein 10
gott 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
smothered 10
in 10
his 10
throat 10
i 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
looked 10
too 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
noticed 10
some 10
queer 10
chill 10
came 10
over 10
me 10
the 10
wounds 10
on 10
the 10
throat 10
had 10
absolutely 10
disappeared 10
for 10
fully 10
five 10
minutes 10
van 10
helsing 10
stood 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
with 10
his 10
face 10
at 10
its 10
sternest 10
then 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
calmly 10
she 10
is 10
dying 10
it 10
will 10
not 10
be 10
long 10
now 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
much 10
difference 10
mark 10
me 10
whether 10
she 10
dies 10
conscious 10
or 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
wake 10
that 10
poor 10
boy 10
and 10
let 10
him 10
come 10
and 10
see 10
the 10
last 10
he 10
trusts 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
have 10
promised 10
him 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
and 10
waked 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
dazed 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
but 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
the 10
sunlight 10
streaming 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
edges 10
of 10
the 10
shutters 10
he 10
thought 10
he 10
was 10
late 10
and 10
expressed 10
his 10
fear 10
i 10
assured 10
him 10
that 10
lucy 10
was 10
still 10
asleep 10
but 10
told 10
him 10
as 10
gently 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
that 10
both 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
feared 10
that 10
the 10
end 10
was 10
near 10
he 10
covered 10
his 10
face 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
and 10
slid 10
down 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
by 10
the 10
sofa 10
where 10
he 10
remained 10
perhaps 10
a 10
minute 10
with 10
his 10
head 10
buried 10
praying 10
whilst 10
his 10
shoulders 10
shook 10
with 10
grief 10
i 10
took 10
him 10
by 10
the 10
hand 10
and 10
raised 10
him 10
up 10
come 10
i 10
said 10
my 10
dear 10
old 10
fellow 10
summon 10
all 10
your 10
fortitude 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
best 10
and 10
easiest 10
for 10
her 10
when 10
we 10
came 10
into 10
lucys 10
room 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
with 10
his 10
usual 10
forethought 10
been 10
putting 10
matters 10
straight 10
and 10
making 10
everything 10
look 10
as 10
pleasing 10
as 10
possible 10
he 10
had 10
even 10
brushed 10
lucys 10
hair 10
so 10
that 10
it 10
lay 10
on 10
the 10
pillow 10
in 10
its 10
usual 10
sunny 10
ripples 10
when 10
we 10
came 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
seeing 10
him 10
whispered 10
softly 10
arthur 10
oh 10
my 10
love 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
glad 10
you 10
have 10
come 10
he 10
was 10
stooping 10
to 10
kiss 10
her 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
motioned 10
him 10
back 10
no 10
he 10
whispered 10
not 10
yet 10
hold 10
her 10
hand 10
it 10
will 10
comfort 10
her 10
more 10
so 10
arthur 10
took 10
her 10
hand 10
and 10
knelt 10
beside 10
her 10
and 10
she 10
looked 10
her 10
best 10
with 10
all 10
the 10
soft 10
lines 10
matching 10
the 10
angelic 10
beauty 10
of 10
her 10
eyes 10
then 10
gradually 10
her 10
eyes 10
closed 10
and 10
she 10
sank 10
to 10
sleep 10
for 10
a 10
little 10
bit 10
her 10
breast 10
heaved 10
softly 10
and 10
her 10
breath 10
came 10
and 10
went 10
like 10
a 10
tired 10
childs 10
and 10
then 10
insensibly 10
there 10
came 10
the 10
strange 10
change 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
noticed 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
her 10
breathing 10
grew 10
stertorous 10
the 10
mouth 10
opened 10
and 10
the 10
pale 10
gums 10
drawn 10
back 10
made 10
the 10
teeth 10
look 10
longer 10
and 10
sharper 10
than 10
ever 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
sleepwaking 10
vague 10
unconscious 10
way 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
which 10
were 10
now 10
dull 10
and 10
hard 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
soft 10
voluptuous 10
voice 10
such 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
never 10
heard 10
from 10
her 10
lips 10
arthur 10
oh 10
my 10
love 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
glad 10
you 10
have 10
come 10
kiss 10
me 10
arthur 10
bent 10
eagerly 10
over 10
to 10
kiss 10
her 10
but 10
at 10
that 10
instant 10
van 10
helsing 10
who 10
like 10
me 10
had 10
been 10
startled 10
by 10
her 10
voice 10
swooped 10
upon 10
him 10
and 10
catching 10
him 10
by 10
the 10
neck 10
with 10
both 10
hands 10
dragged 10
him 10
back 10
with 10
a 10
fury 10
of 10
strength 10
which 10
i 10
never 10
thought 10
he 10
could 10
have 10
possessed 10
and 10
actually 10
hurled 10
him 10
almost 10
across 10
the 10
room 10
not 10
on 10
your 10
life 10
he 10
said 10
not 10
for 10
your 10
living 10
soul 10
and 10
hers 10
and 10
he 10
stood 10
between 10
them 10
like 10
a 10
lion 10
at 10
bay 10
arthur 10
was 10
so 10
taken 10
aback 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
or 10
say 10
and 10
before 10
any 10
impulse 10
of 10
violence 10
could 10
seize 10
him 10
he 10
realized 10
the 10
place 10
and 10
the 10
occasion 10
and 10
stood 10
silent 10
waiting 10
i 10
kept 10
my 10
eyes 10
fixed 10
on 10
lucy 10
as 10
did 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
we 10
saw 10
a 10
spasm 10
as 10
of 10
rage 10
flit 10
like 10
a 10
shadow 10
over 10
her 10
face 10
the 10
sharp 10
teeth 10
clamped 10
together 10
then 10
her 10
eyes 10
closed 10
and 10
she 10
breathed 10
heavily 10
very 10
shortly 10
after 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
in 10
all 10
their 10
softness 10
and 10
putting 10
out 10
her 10
poor 10
pale 10
thin 10
hand 10
took 10
van 10
helsings 10
great 10
brown 10
one 10
drawing 10
it 10
close 10
to 10
her 10
she 10
kissed 10
it 10
my 10
true 10
friend 10
she 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
faint 10
voice 10
but 10
with 10
untellable 10
pathos 10
my 10
true 10
friend 10
and 10
his 10
oh 10
guard 10
him 10
and 10
give 10
me 10
peace 10
i 10
swear 10
it 10
he 10
said 10
solemnly 10
kneeling 10
beside 10
her 10
and 10
holding 10
up 10
his 10
hand 10
as 10
one 10
who 10
registers 10
an 10
oath 10
then 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
arthur 10
and 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
come 10
my 10
child 10
take 10
her 10
hand 10
in 10
yours 10
and 10
kiss 10
her 10
on 10
the 10
forehead 10
and 10
only 10
once 10
their 10
eyes 10
met 10
instead 10
of 10
their 10
lips 10
and 10
so 10
they 10
parted 10
lucys 10
eyes 10
closed 10
and 10
van 10
helsing 10
who 10
had 10
been 10
watching 10
closely 10
took 10
arthurs 10
arm 10
and 10
drew 10
him 10
away 10
and 10
then 10
lucys 10
breathing 10
became 10
stertorous 10
again 10
and 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
it 10
ceased 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
over 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
she 10
is 10
dead 10
i 10
took 10
arthur 10
by 10
the 10
arm 10
and 10
led 10
him 10
away 10
to 10
the 10
drawing 10
room 10
where 10
he 10
sat 10
down 10
and 10
covered 10
his 10
face 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
sobbing 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
nearly 10
broke 10
me 10
down 10
to 10
see 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
found 10
van 10
helsing 10
looking 10
at 10
poor 10
lucy 10
and 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
sterner 10
than 10
eve 10
some 10
change 10
had 10
come 10
over 10
her 10
body 10
death 10
had 10
given 10
back 10
part 10
of 10
her 10
beauty 10
for 10
her 10
brow 10
and 10
cheeks 10
had 10
recovered 10
some 10
of 10
their 10
flowing 10
lines 10
even 10
the 10
lips 10
had 10
lost 10
their 10
deadly 10
pallor 10
it 10
was 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
blood 10
no 10
longer 10
needed 10
for 10
the 10
working 10
of 10
the 10
heart 10
had 10
gone 10
to 10
make 10
the 10
harshness 10
of 10
death 10
as 10
little 10
rude 10
as 10
might 10
be 10
we 10
thought 10
her 10
dying 10
whilst 10
she 10
slept 10
and 10
sleeping 10
when 10
she 10
died 10
i 10
stood 10
beside 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
said 10
ah 10
well 10
poor 10
girl 10
there 10
is 10
peace 10
for 10
her 10
at 10
last 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
end 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
with 10
grave 10
solemnity 10
not 10
so 10
alas 10
not 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
the 10
beginning 10
when 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
he 10
meant 10
he 10
only 10
shook 10
his 10
head 10
and 10
answered 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
nothing 10
as 10
yet 10
wait 10
and 10
see 10
chapter 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diarycont 10
the 10
funeral 10
was 10
arranged 10
for 10
the 10
next 10
succeeding 10
day 10
so 10
that 10
lucy 10
and 10
her 10
mother 10
might 10
be 10
buried 10
together 10
i 10
attended 10
to 10
all 10
the 10
ghastly 10
formalities 10
and 10
the 10
urbane 10
undertaker 10
proved 10
that 10
his 10
staff 10
was 10
afflicted 10
or 10
blessed 10
with 10
something 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
obsequious 10
suavity 10
even 10
the 10
woman 10
who 10
performed 10
the 10
last 10
offices 10
for 10
the 10
dead 10
remarked 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
confidential 10
brotherprofessional 10
way 10
when 10
she 10
had 10
come 10
out 10
from 10
the 10
death 10
chamber 10
she 10
makes 10
a 10
very 10
beautiful 10
corpse 10
sir 10
its 10
quite 10
a 10
privilege 10
to 10
attend 10
on 10
her 10
its 10
not 10
too 10
much 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
she 10
will 10
do 10
credit 10
to 10
our 10
establishment 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
van 10
helsing 10
never 10
kept 10
far 10
away 10
this 10
was 10
possible 10
from 10
the 10
disordered 10
state 10
of 10
things 10
in 10
the 10
household 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
relatives 10
at 10
hand 10
and 10
as 10
arthur 10
had 10
to 10
be 10
back 10
the 10
next 10
day 10
to 10
attend 10
at 10
his 10
fathers 10
funeral 10
we 10
were 10
unable 10
to 10
notify 10
any 10
one 10
who 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
bidden 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
upon 10
ourselves 10
to 10
examine 10
papers 10
etc 10
he 10
insisted 10
upon 10
looking 10
over 10
lucys 10
papers 10
himself 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
why 10
for 10
i 10
feared 10
that 10
he 10
being 10
a 10
foreigner 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
quite 10
aware 10
of 10
english 10
legal 10
requirements 10
and 10
so 10
might 10
in 10
ignorance 10
make 10
some 10
unnecessary 10
trouble 10
he 10
answered 10
me 10
i 10
know 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
forget 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
lawyer 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
a 10
doctor 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
not 10
altogether 10
for 10
the 10
law 10
you 10
knew 10
that 10
when 10
you 10
avoided 10
the 10
coroner 10
i 10
have 10
more 10
than 10
him 10
to 10
avoid 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
papers 10
more 10
such 10
as 10
this 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
took 10
from 10
his 10
pocket 10
book 10
the 10
memorandum 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
in 10
lucys 10
breast 10
and 10
which 10
she 10
had 10
torn 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
when 10
you 10
find 10
anything 10
of 10
the 10
solicitor 10
who 10
is 10
for 10
the 10
late 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
seal 10
all 10
her 10
papers 10
and 10
write 10
him 10
tonight 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
watch 10
here 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
in 10
miss 10
lucys 10
old 10
room 10
all 10
night 10
and 10
i 10
myself 10
search 10
for 10
what 10
may 10
be 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
well 10
that 10
her 10
very 10
thoughts 10
go 10
into 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
strangers 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
my 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
work 10
and 10
in 10
another 10
half 10
hour 10
had 10
found 10
the 10
name 10
and 10
address 10
of 10
mrs 10
westenras 10
solicitor 10
and 10
had 10
written 10
to 10
him 10
all 10
the 10
poor 10
ladys 10
papers 10
were 10
in 10
order 10
explicit 10
directions 10
regarding 10
the 10
place 10
of 10
burial 10
were 10
given 10
i 10
had 10
hardly 10
sealed 10
the 10
letter 10
when 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
van 10
helsing 10
walked 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
saying 10

looked 10
for 10
i 10
asked 10
to 10
which 10
he 10
replied 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
look 10
for 10
any 10
specific 10
thing 10
i 10
only 10
hoped 10
to 10
find 10
and 10
find 10
i 10
have 10
all 10
that 10
there 10

and 10
a 10
few 10
memoranda 10
and 10
a 10
diary 10

but 10
i 10
have 10
them 10
here 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
for 10
the 10
present 10

nothing 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
shall 10
see 10
that 10
poor 10
lad 10
tomorrow 10
evening 10
and 10
with 10
his 10
sanction 10
i 10
shall 10
use 10
some 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
finished 10
the 10
work 10
in 10
hand 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
now 10
friend 10
john 10

much 10
to 10
do 10
but 10
for 10
the 10
tonight 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
need 10
of 10
us 10
alas 10
before 10
turning 10
in 10
we 10
went 10
to 10
look 10
at 10
poor 10
lucy 10
the 10
undertaker 10
had 10
certainly 10
done 10
his 10
work 10
well 10
for 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
turned 10
into 10
a 10
small 10
chapelle 10
ardente 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
wilderness 10
of 10
beautiful 10
white 10
flowers 10
and 10
death 10
was 10
made 10
as 10
little 10
repulsive 10
as 10
might 10
be 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
the 10
winding 10
sheet 10
was 10
laid 10
over 10
the 10
face 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
turned 10
it 10
gently 10
back 10
we 10
both 10
started 10
at 10
the 10
beauty 10
before 10
us 10
the 10
tall 10
wax 10
candles 10
showing 10
a 10
sufficient 10
light 10
to 10
note 10
it 10
well 10
all 10
lucys 10
loveliness 10
had 10
come 10
back 10
to 10
her 10
in 10
death 10
and 10
the 10
hours 10
that 10
had 10
passed 10
instead 10
of 10
leaving 10
traces 10
of 10
decays 10
effacing 10
fingers 10
had 10
but 10
restored 10
the 10
beauty 10
of 10
life 10
till 10
positively 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
believe 10
my 10
eyes 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
looking 10
at 10
a 10
corpse 10
the 10
professor 10
looked 10
sternly 10
grave 10
he 10
had 10
not 10
loved 10
her 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
need 10
for 10
tears 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
remain 10
till 10
i 10
return 10
and 10
left 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
came 10
back 10
with 10
a 10
handful 10
of 10
wild 10
garlic 10
from 10
the 10
box 10
waiting 10
in 10
the 10
hall 10
but 10
which 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
opened 10
and 10
placed 10
the 10
flowers 10
amongst 10
the 10
others 10
on 10
and 10
around 10
the 10
bed 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
from 10

at 10

all 10
so 10
that 10
none 10
know 10
save 10
we 10
alone 10
but 10
why 10
do 10
it 10
at 10
all 10
the 10
girl 10
is 10
dead 10
why 10
mutilate 10
her 10
poor 10
body 10
without 10
need 10
and 10
if 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
necessity 10
for 10
a 10
postmortem 10
and 10
nothing 10
to 10
gain 10
by 10
it 10
no 10
good 10
to 10
her 10
to 10
us 10
to 10
science 10
to 10
human 10
knowledge 10
why 10
do 10
it 10
without 10
such 10
it 10
is 10
monstrous 10
for 10
answer 10
he 10
put 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
my 10
shoulder 10
and 10
said 10
with 10
infinite 10
tenderness 10
friend 10
john 10
i 10
pity 10
your 10
poor 10
bleeding 10
heart 10
and 10
i 10
love 10
you 10
the 10
more 10
because 10
it 10
does 10
so 10
bleed 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
i 10
would 10
take 10
on 10
myself 10
the 10
burden 10
that 10
you 10
do 10
bear 10
but 10
there 10
are 10
things 10
that 10
you 10
know 10
not 10
but 10
that 10
you 10
shall 10
know 10
and 10
bless 10
me 10
for 10
knowing 10
though 10
they 10
are 10
not 10
pleasant 10
things 10
john 10
my 10
child 10
you 10
have 10
been 10
my 10
friend 10
now 10
many 10
years 10
and 10
yet 10
did 10
you 10
ever 10
know 10
me 10
to 10
do 10
any 10
without 10
good 10
cause 10
i 10
may 10
err 10
i 10
am 10
but 10
man 10
but 10
i 10
believe 10
in 10
all 10
i 10
do 10
was 10
it 10
not 10
for 10
these 10
causes 10
that 10
you 10
send 10
for 10
me 10
when 10
the 10
great 10
trouble 10
came 10
yes 10
were 10
you 10
not 10
amazed 10
nay 10
horrified 10
when 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
let 10
arthur 10
kiss 10
his 10
love 10
though 10
she 10
was 10
dying 10
and 10
snatched 10
him 10
away 10
by 10
all 10
my 10
strength 10
yes 10
and 10
yet 10
you 10
saw 10
how 10
she 10
thanked 10
me 10
with 10
her 10
so 10
beautiful 10
dying 10
eyes 10
her 10
voice 10
too 10
so 10
weak 10
and 10
she 10
kiss 10
my 10
rough 10
old 10
hand 10
and 10
bless 10
me 10
yes 10
and 10
did 10
you 10
not 10
hear 10
me 10
swear 10
promise 10
to 10
her 10
that 10
so 10
she 10
closed 10
her 10
eyes 10
grateful 10
yes 10
well 10
i 10
have 10
good 10
reason 10
now 10
for 10
all 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
do 10
you 10
have 10
for 10
many 10
years 10
trust 10
me 10
you 10
have 10
believe 10
me 10
weeks 10
past 10
when 10
there 10
be 10
things 10
so 10
strange 10
that 10
you 10
might 10
have 10
well 10
doubt 10
believe 10
me 10
yet 10
a 10
little 10
friend 10
john 10
if 10
you 10
trust 10
me 10
not 10
then 10
i 10
must 10
tell 10
what 10
i 10
think 10
and 10
that 10
is 10
not 10
perhaps 10
well 10
and 10
if 10
i 10
work 10
as 10
work 10
i 10
shall 10
no 10
matter 10
trust 10
or 10
no 10
trust 10
without 10
my 10
friend 10
trust 10
in 10
me 10
i 10
work 10
with 10
heavy 10
heart 10
and 10
feel 10
oh 10
so 10
lonely 10
when 10
i 10
want 10
all 10
help 10
and 10
courage 10
that 10
may 10
be 10
he 10
paused 10
a 10
moment 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
solemnly 10
friend 10
john 10
there 10
are 10
strange 10
and 10
terrible 10
days 10
before 10
us 10
let 10
us 10
not 10
be 10
two 10
but 10
one 10
that 10
so 10
we 10
work 10
to 10
a 10
good 10
end 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
have 10
faith 10
in 10
me 10
i 10
took 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
promised 10
him 10
i 10
held 10
my 10
door 10
open 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
away 10
and 10
watched 10
him 10
go 10
to 10
his 10
room 10
and 10
close 10
the 10
door 10
as 10
i 10
stood 10
without 10
moving 10
i 10
saw 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
maids 10
pass 10
silently 10
along 10
the 10
passage 10
she 10
had 10
her 10
back 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
did 10
not 10
see 10
me 10
and 10
go 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
where 10
lucy 10
lay 10
the 10
sight 10
touched 10
me 10
devotion 10
is 10
so 10
rare 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
so 10
grateful 10
to 10
those 10
who 10
show 10
it 10
unasked 10
to 10
those 10
we 10
love 10
here 10
was 10
a 10
poor 10
girl 10
putting 10
aside 10
the 10
terrors 10
which 10
she 10
naturally 10
had 10
of 10
death 10
to 10
go 10
watch 10
alone 10
by 10
the 10
bier 10
of 10
the 10
mistress 10
whom 10
she 10
loved 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
poor 10
clay 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
lonely 10
till 10
laid 10
to 10
eternal 10
rest 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
slept 10
long 10
and 10
soundly 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
broad 10
daylight 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
waked 10
me 10
by 10
coming 10
into 10
my 10
room 10
he 10
came 10
over 10
to 10
my 10
bedside 10
and 10
said 10
you 10
need 10
not 10
trouble 10
about 10
the 10
knives 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
do 10
it 10
why 10
not 10
i 10
asked 10
for 10
his 10
solemnity 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
before 10
had 10
greatly 10
impressed 10
me 10
because 10
he 10
said 10
sternly 10
it 10
is 10
too 10
late 10
or 10
too 10
early 10
see 10
here 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
the 10
little 10
golden 10
crucifix 10
this 10
was 10
stolen 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
how 10
stolen 10
i 10
asked 10
in 10
wonder 10
since 10
you 10
have 10
it 10
now 10
because 10
i 10
get 10
it 10
back 10
from 10
the 10
worthless 10
wretch 10
who 10
stole 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
woman 10
who 10
robbed 10
the 10
dead 10
and 10
the 10
living 10
her 10
punishment 10
will 10
surely 10
come 10
but 10
not 10
through 10
me 10
she 10
knew 10
not 10
altogether 10
what 10
she 10
did 10
and 10
thus 10
unknowing 10
she 10
only 10
stole 10
now 10
we 10
must 10
wait 10
he 10
went 10
away 10
on 10
the 10
word 10
leaving 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
new 10
mystery 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
a 10
new 10
puzzle 10
to 10
grapple 10
with 10
the 10
forenoon 10
was 10
a 10
dreary 10
time 10
but 10
at 10
noon 10
the 10
solicitor 10
came 10
mr 10
marquand 10
of 10
wholeman 10
sons 10
marquand 10
lidderdale 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
genial 10
and 10
very 10
appreciative 10
of 10
what 10
we 10
had 10
done 10
and 10
took 10
off 10
our 10
hands 10
all 10
cares 10
as 10
to 10
details 10
during 10
lunch 10
he 10
told 10
us 10
that 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
had 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
expected 10
sudden 10
death 10
from 10
her 10
heart 10
and 10
had 10
put 10
her 10
affairs 10
in 10
absolute 10
order 10
he 10
informed 10
us 10
that 10
with 10
the 10
exception 10
of 10
a 10
certain 10
entailed 10
property 10
of 10
lucys 10
father 10
which 10
now 10
in 10
default 10
of 10
direct 10
issue 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
a 10
distant 10
branch 10
of 10
the 10
family 10
the 10
whole 10
estate 10
real 10
and 10
personal 10
was 10
left 10
absolutely 10
to 10
arthur 10
holmwood 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
told 10
us 10
so 10
much 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
frankly 10
we 10
did 10
our 10
best 10
to 10
prevent 10
such 10
a 10
testamentary 10
disposition 10
and 10
pointed 10
out 10
certain 10
contingencies 10
that 10
might 10
leave 10
her 10
daughter 10
either 10
penniless 10
or 10
not 10
so 10
free 10
as 10
she 10
should 10
be 10
to 10
act 10
regarding 10
a 10
matrimonial 10
alliance 10
indeed 10
we 10
pressed 10
the 10
matter 10
so 10
far 10
that 10
we 10
almost 10
came 10
into 10
collision 10
for 10
she 10
asked 10
us 10
if 10
we 10
were 10
or 10
were 10
not 10
prepared 10
to 10
carry 10
out 10
her 10
wishes 10
of 10
course 10
we 10
had 10
then 10
no 10
alternative 10
but 10
to 10
accept 10
we 10
were 10
right 10
in 10
principle 10
and 10
ninetynine 10
times 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
hundred 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
proved 10
by 10
the 10
logic 10
of 10
events 10
the 10
accuracy 10
of 10
our 10
judgment 10
frankly 10
however 10
i 10
must 10
admit 10
that 10
in 10
this 10
case 10
any 10
other 10
form 10
of 10
disposition 10
would 10
have 10
rendered 10
impossible 10
the 10
carrying 10
out 10
of 10
her 10
wishes 10
for 10
by 10
her 10
predeceasing 10
her 10
daughter 10
the 10
latter 10
would 10
have 10
come 10
into 10
possession 10
of 10
the 10
property 10
and 10
even 10
had 10
she 10
only 10
survived 10
her 10
mother 10

five 10
minutes 10

been 10
treated 10
at 10

case 10
lord 10
godalming 10
though 10
so 10
dear 10
a 10
friend 10
would 10
have 10
had 10
no 10
claim 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
the 10
inheritors 10
being 10
remote 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
likely 10
to 10
abandon 10
their 10
just 10
rights 10
for 10
sentimental 10
reasons 10
regarding 10
an 10
entire 10
stranger 10
i 10
assure 10
you 10
my 10
dear 10
sirs 10
i 10
am 10
rejoiced 10
at 10
the 10
result 10
perfectly 10
rejoiced 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
good 10
fellow 10
but 10
his 10
rejoicing 10
at 10
the 10
one 10
little 10
part 10
in 10
which 10
he 10
was 10
officially 10
interested 10
of 10
so 10
great 10
a 10
tragedy 10
was 10
an 10
objectlesson 10
in 10
the 10
limitations 10
of 10
sympathetic 10
understanding 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
remain 10
long 10
but 10
said 10
he 10
would 10
look 10
in 10
later 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
see 10
lord 10
godalming 10
his 10
coming 10
however 10
had 10
been 10
a 10
certain 10
comfort 10
to 10
us 10
since 10
it 10
assured 10
us 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
not 10
have 10
to 10
dread 10
hostile 10
criticism 10
as 10
to 10
any 10
of 10
our 10
acts 10
arthur 10
was 10
expected 10
at 10
five 10
oclock 10
so 10
a 10
little 10
before 10
that 10
time 10
we 10
visited 10
the 10
death 10
chamber 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
in 10
very 10
truth 10
for 10
now 10
both 10
mother 10
and 10
daughter 10
lay 10
in 10
it 10
the 10
undertaker 10
true 10
to 10
his 10
craft 10
had 10
made 10
the 10
best 10
display 10
he 10
could 10
of 10
his 10
goods 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
mortuary 10
air 10
about 10
the 10
place 10
that 10
lowered 10
our 10
spirits 10
at 10
once 10
van 10
helsing 10
ordered 10
the 10
former 10
arrangement 10
to 10
be 10
adhered 10
to 10
explaining 10
that 10
as 10
lord 10
godalming 10
was 10
coming 10
very 10
soon 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
less 10
harrowing 10
to 10
his 10
feelings 10
to 10
see 10
all 10
that 10
was 10
left 10
of 10
his 10
fiancee 10
quite 10
alone 10
the 10
undertaker 10
seemed 10
shocked 10
at 10
his 10
own 10
stupidity 10
and 10
exerted 10
himself 10
to 10
restore 10
things 10
to 10
the 10
condition 10
in 10
which 10
we 10
left 10
them 10
the 10
night 10
before 10
so 10
that 10
when 10
arthur 10
came 10
such 10
shocks 10
to 10
his 10
feelings 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
avoid 10
were 10
saved 10
poor 10
fellow 10
he 10
looked 10
desperately 10
sad 10
and 10
broken 10
even 10
his 10
stalwart 10
manhood 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
shrunk 10
somewhat 10
under 10
the 10
strain 10
of 10
his 10
muchtried 10
emotions 10
he 10
had 10
i 10
knew 10
been 10
very 10
genuinely 10
and 10
devotedly 10
attached 10
to 10
his 10
father 10
and 10
to 10
lose 10
him 10
and 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
time 10
was 10
a 10
bitter 10
blow 10
to 10
him 10
with 10
me 10
he 10
was 10
warm 10
as 10
ever 10
and 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
he 10
was 10
sweetly 10
courteous 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
help 10
seeing 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
constraint 10
with 10
him 10
the 10
professor 10
noticed 10
it 10
too 10
and 10
motioned 10
me 10
to 10
bring 10
him 10
upstairs 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
and 10
left 10
him 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
as 10
i 10
felt 10
he 10
would 10
like 10
to 10
be 10
quite 10
alone 10
with 10
her 10
but 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
arm 10
and 10
led 10
me 10
in 10
saying 10
huskily 10
you 10
loved 10
her 10
too 10
old 10
fellow 10
she 10
told 10
me 10
all 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
friend 10
had 10
a 10
closer 10
place 10
in 10
her 10
heart 10
than 10
you 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
how 10
to 10
thank 10
you 10
for 10
all 10
you 10
have 10
done 10
for 10
her 10
i 10
cant 10
think 10
yet 10
here 10
he 10
suddenly 10
broke 10
down 10
and 10
threw 10
his 10
arms 10
round 10
my 10
shoulders 10
and 10
laid 10
his 10
head 10
on 10
my 10
breast 10
crying 10
oh 10
jack 10
jack 10
what 10
shall 10
i 10
do 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
life 10
seems 10
gone 10
from 10
me 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
nothing 10
in 10
the 10
wide 10
world 10
for 10
me 10
to 10
live 10
for 10
i 10
comforted 10
him 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
in 10
such 10
cases 10
men 10
do 10
not 10
need 10
much 10
expression 10
a 10
grip 10
of 10
the 10
hand 10
the 10
tightening 10
of 10
an 10
arm 10
over 10
the 10
shoulder 10
a 10
sob 10
in 10
unison 10
are 10
expressions 10
of 10
sympathy 10
dear 10
to 10
a 10
mans 10
heart 10
i 10
stood 10
still 10
and 10
silent 10
till 10
his 10
sobs 10
died 10
away 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
said 10
softly 10
to 10
him 10
come 10
and 10
look 10
at 10
her 10
together 10
we 10
moved 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
bed 10
and 10
i 10
lifted 10
the 10
lawn 10
from 10
her 10
face 10
god 10
how 10
beautiful 10
she 10
was 10
every 10
hour 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
enhancing 10
her 10
loveliness 10
it 10
frightened 10
and 10
amazed 10
me 10
somewhat 10
and 10
as 10
for 10
arthur 10
he 10
fell 10
to 10
trembling 10
and 10
finally 10
was 10
shaken 10
with 10
doubt 10
as 10
with 10
an 10
ague 10
at 10
last 10
after 10
a 10
long 10
pause 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
faint 10
whisper 10
jack 10
is 10
she 10
really 10
dead 10
i 10
assured 10
him 10
sadly 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
to 10
suggest 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
such 10
a 10
horrible 10
doubt 10
should 10
not 10
have 10
life 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
longer 10
than 10
i 10
could 10
help 10
that 10
it 10
often 10
happened 10
that 10
after 10
death 10
faces 10
become 10
softened 10
and 10
even 10
resolved 10
into 10
their 10
youthful 10
beauty 10
that 10
this 10
was 10
especially 10
so 10
when 10
death 10
had 10
been 10
preceded 10
by 10
any 10
acute 10
or 10
prolonged 10
suffering 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
quite 10
do 10
away 10
with 10
any 10
doubt 10
and 10
after 10
kneeling 10
beside 10
the 10
couch 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
and 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
lovingly 10
and 10
long 10
he 10
turned 10
aside 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
that 10
must 10
be 10
goodbye 10
as 10
the 10
coffin 10
had 10
to 10
be 10
prepared 10
so 10
he 10
went 10
back 10
and 10
took 10
her 10
dead 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
kissed 10
it 10
and 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
kissed 10
her 10
forehead 10
he 10
came 10
away 10
fondly 10
looking 10
back 10
over 10
his 10
shoulder 10
at 10
her 10
as 10
he 10
came 10
i 10
left 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
drawing 10
room 10
and 10
told 10
van 10
helsing 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
said 10
goodbye 10
so 10
the 10
latter 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
kitchen 10
to 10
tell 10
the 10
undertakers 10
men 10
to 10
proceed 10
with 10
the 10
preperations 10
and 10
to 10
screw 10
up 10
the 10
coffin 10
when 10
he 10
came 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
again 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
of 10
arthurs 10
question 10
and 10
he 10
replied 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
surprised 10
just 10
now 10
i 10
doubted 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
myself 10
we 10
all 10
dined 10
together 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
poor 10
art 10
was 10
trying 10
to 10
make 10
the 10
best 10
of 10
things 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
been 10
silent 10
all 10
dinner 10
time 10
but 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
lit 10
our 10
cigars 10
he 10
said 10
lord 10
but 10
arthur 10
interrupted 10
him 10
no 10
no 10
not 10
that 10
for 10
gods 10
sake 10
not 10
yet 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
forgive 10
me 10
sir 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
mean 10
to 10
speak 10
offensively 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
because 10
my 10
loss 10
is 10
so 10
recent 10
the 10
professor 10
answered 10
very 10
sweetly 10
i 10
only 10
used 10
that 10
name 10
because 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
doubt 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
call 10
you 10
mr 10
and 10
i 10
have 10
grown 10
to 10
love 10
you 10
yes 10
my 10
dear 10
boy 10
to 10
love 10
you 10
as 10
arthur 10
arthur 10
held 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
took 10
the 10
old 10
mans 10
warmly 10
call 10
me 10
what 10
you 10
will 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
may 10
always 10
have 10
the 10
title 10
of 10
a 10
friend 10
and 10
let 10
me 10
say 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
at 10
a 10
loss 10
for 10
words 10
to 10
thank 10
you 10
for 10
your 10
goodness 10
to 10
my 10
poor 10
dear 10
he 10
paused 10
a 10
moment 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
she 10
understood 10
your 10
goodness 10
even 10
better 10
than 10
i 10
do 10
and 10
if 10
i 10
was 10
rude 10
or 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
wanting 10
at 10
that 10
time 10
you 10
acted 10
so 10
you 10
remember 10
the 10
professor 10
noddedyou 10
must 10
forgive 10
me 10
he 10
answered 10
with 10
a 10
grave 10
kindness 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
for 10
you 10
to 10
quite 10
trust 10
me 10
then 10
for 10
to 10
trust 10
such 10
violence 10
needs 10
to 10
understand 10
and 10
i 10
take 10
it 10
that 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
that 10
you 10
cannot 10
trust 10
me 10
now 10
for 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
yet 10
understand 10
and 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
more 10

solemnly 10
and 10

through 10
the 10
bitter 10
water 10
before 10
we 10
reach 10
the 10
sweet 10
but 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
brave 10

heart 10
and 10
unselfish 10
and 10

of 10
the 10
room 10
where 10
lucy 10
lay 10
in 10
her 10
coffin 10
strewn 10
with 10
the 10
wild 10
garlic 10
flowers 10
which 10
sent 10
through 10
the 10
odor 10
of 10
lily 10
and 10
rose 10
a 10
heavy 10
overpowering 10
smell 10
into 10

seems 10
only 10
yesterday 10
that 10
the 10
last 10
entry 10
was 10
made 10
and 10
yet 10
how 10
much 10
between 10
then 10
in 10
whitby 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
before 10
me 10
jonathan 10
away 10
and 10
no 10
news 10
of 10
him 10
and 10
now 10
married 10
to 10
jonathan 10
jonathan 10
a 10
solicitor 10
a 10
partner 10
rich 10
master 10
of 10
his 10
business 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
dead 10
and 10
buried 10
and 10
jonathan 10
with 10
another 10
attack 10
that 10
may 10
harm 10
him 10
some 10
day 10
he 10
may 10
ask 10
me 10
about 10
it 10
down 10
it 10
all 10
goes 10
i 10
am 10
rusty 10
in 10
my 10
shorthand 10
see 10
what 10
unexpected 10
prosperity 10
does 10
for 10
us 10
so 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
as 10
well 10
to 10
freshen 10
it 10
up 10
again 10
with 10
an 10
exercise 10
anyhow 10
the 10
service 10
was 10
very 10
simple 10
and 10
very 10
solemn 10
there 10
were 10
only 10
ourselves 10
and 10
the 10
servants 10
there 10
one 10
or 10
two 10
old 10
friends 10
of 10
his 10
from 10
exeter 10
his 10
london 10
agent 10
and 10
a 10
gentleman 10
representing 10
sir 10
john 10
paxton 10
the 10
president 10
of 10
the 10
incorporated 10
law 10
society 10
jonathan 10
and 10
i 10
stood 10
hand 10
in 10
hand 10
and 10
we 10
felt 10
that 10
our 10
best 10
and 10
dearest 10
friend 10
was 10
gone 10
from 10
us 10
we 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
town 10
quietly 10
taking 10
a 10
bus 10
to 10
hyde 10
park 10
corner 10
jonathan 10
thought 10
it 10
would 10
interest 10
me 10
to 10
go 10
into 10
the 10
row 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
so 10
we 10
sat 10
down 10
but 10
there 10
were 10
very 10
few 10
people 10
there 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
sadlooking 10
and 10
desolate 10
to 10
see 10
so 10
many 10
empty 10
chairs 10
it 10
made 10
us 10
think 10
of 10
the 10
empty 10
chair 10
at 10
home 10
so 10
we 10
got 10
up 10
and 10
walked 10
down 10
piccadilly 10
jonathan 10
was 10
holding 10
me 10
by 10
the 10
arm 10
the 10
way 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
days 10
before 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
school 10
i 10
felt 10
it 10
very 10
improper 10
for 10
you 10
cant 10
go 10
on 10
for 10
some 10
years 10
teaching 10
etiquette 10
and 10
decorum 10
to 10
other 10
girls 10
without 10
the 10
pedantry 10
of 10
it 10
biting 10
into 10
yourself 10
a 10
bit 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
jonathan 10
and 10
he 10
was 10
my 10
husband 10
and 10
we 10
didnt 10
know 10
anybody 10
who 10
saw 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
didnt 10
care 10
if 10
they 10
did 10
so 10
on 10
we 10
walked 10
i 10
was 10
looking 10
at 10
a 10
very 10
beautiful 10
girl 10
in 10
a 10
big 10
cartwheel 10
hat 10
sitting 10
in 10
a 10
victoria 10
outside 10
guilianos 10
when 10
i 10
felt 10
jonathan 10
clutch 10
my 10
arm 10
so 10
tight 10
that 10
he 10
hurt 10
me 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
under 10
his 10
breath 10
my 10
god 10
i 10
am 10
always 10
anxious 10
about 10
jonathan 10
for 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
some 10
nervous 10
fit 10
may 10
upset 10
him 10
again 10
so 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
him 10
quickly 10
and 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
disturbed 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
pale 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
seemed 10
bulging 10
out 10
as 10
half 10
in 10
terror 10
and 10
half 10
in 10
amazement 10
he 10
gazed 10
at 10
a 10
tall 10
thin 10
man 10
with 10
a 10
beaky 10
nose 10
and 10
black 10
moustache 10
and 10
pointed 10
beard 10
who 10
was 10
also 10
observing 10
the 10
pretty 10
girl 10
he 10
was 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
so 10
hard 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
see 10
either 10
of 10
us 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
good 10
view 10
of 10
him 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
not 10
a 10
good 10
face 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
and 10
cruel 10
and 10
sensual 10
and 10
big 10
white 10
teeth 10
that 10
looked 10
all 10
the 10
whiter 10
because 10
his 10
lips 10
were 10
so 10
red 10
were 10
pointed 10
like 10
an 10
animals 10
jonathan 10
kept 10
staring 10
at 10
him 10
till 10
i 10
was 10
afraid 10
he 10
would 10
notice 10
i 10
feared 10
he 10
might 10
take 10
it 10
ill 10
he 10
looked 10
so 10
fierce 10
and 10
nasty 10
i 10
asked 10
jonathan 10
why 10
he 10
was 10
disturbed 10
and 10
he 10
answered 10
evidently 10
thinking 10
that 10
i 10
knew 10
as 10
much 10
about 10
it 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
do 10
you 10
see 10
who 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
dear 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
him 10
who 10
is 10
it 10
his 10
answer 10
seemed 10
to 10
shock 10
and 10
thrill 10
me 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
said 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
me 10
mina 10
to 10
whom 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
man 10
himself 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
was 10
evidently 10
terrified 10
at 10
something 10
very 10
greatly 10
terrified 10
i 10
do 10
believe 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
not 10
had 10
me 10
to 10
lean 10
on 10
and 10
to 10
support 10
him 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
sunk 10
down 10
he 10
kept 10
staring 10
a 10
man 10
came 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
shop 10
with 10
a 10
small 10
parcel 10
and 10
gave 10
it 10
to 10
the 10
lady 10
who 10
then 10
drove 10
off 10
th 10
e 10
dark 10
man 10
kept 10
his 10
eyes 10
fixed 10
on 10
her 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
carriage 10
moved 10
up 10
piccadilly 10
he 10
followed 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
direction 10
and 10
hailed 10
a 10
hansom 10
jonathan 10
kept 10
looking 10
after 10
him 10
and 10
said 10
as 10
if 10
to 10
himself 10
i 10
believe 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
count 10
but 10
he 10
has 10
grown 10
young 10
my 10
god 10
if 10
this 10
be 10
so 10
oh 10
my 10
god 10
my 10
god 10
if 10
only 10
i 10
knew 10
if 10
only 10
i 10
knew 10
he 10
was 10
distressing 10
himself 10
so 10
much 10
that 10
i 10
feared 10
to 10
keep 10
his 10
mind 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
by 10
asking 10
him 10
any 10
questions 10
so 10
i 10
remained 10
silent 10
i 10
drew 10
away 10
quietly 10
and 10
he 10
holding 10
my 10
arm 10
came 10
easily 10
we 10
walked 10
a 10
little 10
further 10
and 10
then 10
went 10
in 10
and 10
sat 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
in 10
the 10
green 10
park 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
hot 10
day 10
for 10
autumn 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
comfortable 10
seat 10
in 10
a 10
shady 10
place 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
staring 10
at 10
nothing 10
jonathans 10
eyes 10
closed 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
quickly 10
into 10
a 10
sleep 10
with 10
his 10
head 10
on 10
my 10
shoulder 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
best 10
thing 10
for 10
him 10
so 10
did 10
not 10
disturb 10
him 10
in 10
about 10
twenty 10
minutes 10
he 10
woke 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
quite 10
cheerfully 10
why 10
mina 10
have 10
i 10
been 10
asleep 10
oh 10
do 10
forgive 10
me 10
for 10
being 10
so 10
rude 10
come 10
and 10
well 10
have 10
a 10
cup 10
of 10
tea 10
somewhere 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
forgotten 10
all 10
about 10
the 10
dark 10
stranger 10
as 10
in 10
his 10
illness 10
he 10
had 10
forgotten 10
all 10
that 10
this 10
episode 10
had 10
reminded 10
him 10
of 10
i 10
dont 10
like 10
this 10
lapsing 10
into 10
forgetfulness 10
it 10
may 10
make 10
or 10
continue 10
some 10
injury 10
to 10
the 10
brain 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
ask 10
him 10
for 10
fear 10
i 10
shall 10
do 10
more 10
harm 10
than 10
good 10
but 10
i 10
must 10
somehow 10
learn 10
the 10
facts 10
of 10
his 10
journey 10
abroad 10
the 10
time 10
is 10
come 10
i 10
fear 10
when 10
i 10
must 10
open 10
the 10
parcel 10
and 10
know 10
what 10
is 10
written 10
oh 10
jonathan 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
know 10
forgive 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
do 10
wrong 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
for 10
your 10
own 10
dear 10
sake 10
latera 10
sad 10

but 10
he 10
bore 10
himself 10
through 10
it 10
like 10
a 10
moral 10
viking 10
if 10

lying 10
down 10

a 10
rest 10
preparatory 10
to 10
his 10

amsterdam 10

work 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
london 10
which 10
may 10
take 10
him 10
some 10
time 10
poor 10
old 10
fellow 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
the 10
strain 10
of 10
the 10
past 10
week 10
has 10
broken 10
down 10
even 10
his 10
iron 10
strength 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
the 10
burial 10
he 10
was 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
putting 10
some 10
terrible 10
restraint 10
on 10
himself 10
when 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
over 10
we 10
were 10
standing 10
beside 10
arthur 10
who 10
poor 10
fellow 10
was 10
speaking 10
of 10
his 10
part 10
in 10
the 10
operation 10
where 10
his 10
blood 10
had 10
been 10
transfused 10
to 10
his 10
lucys 10
veins 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
van 10
helsings 10
face 10
grow 10
white 10
and 10
purple 10
by 10
turns 10
arthur 10
was 10
saying 10
that 10
he 10
felt 10
since 10
then 10
as 10
if 10
they 10
two 10
had 10
been 10
really 10
married 10
and 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
his 10
wife 10
in 10
the 10
sight 10
of 10
god 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
said 10
a 10
word 10
of 10
the 10
other 10
operations 10
and 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
ever 10
shall 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
went 10
away 10
together 10
to 10
the 10
station 10
and 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
came 10
on 10
here 10
the 10
moment 10
we 10
were 10
alone 10
in 10
the 10
carriage 10
he 10
gave 10
way 10
to 10
a 10
regular 10
fit 10
of 10
hysterics 10
he 10
has 10
denied 10
to 10
me 10
since 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
hysterics 10
and 10
insisted 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
his 10
sense 10
of 10
humor 10
asserting 10
itself 10
under 10
very 10
terrible 10
conditions 10
he 10
laughed 10
till 10
he 10
cried 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
draw 10
down 10
the 10
blinds 10
lest 10
any 10
one 10
should 10
see 10
us 10
and 10
misjudge 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
cried 10
till 10
he 10
laughed 10
again 10
and 10
laughed 10
and 10
cried 10
together 10
just 10
as 10
a 10
woman 10
does 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
be 10
stern 10
with 10
him 10
as 10
one 10
is 10
to 10
a 10
woman 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
but 10
it 10
had 10
no 10
effect 10
men 10
and 10
women 10
are 10
so 10
different 10
in 10
manifestations 10
of 10
nervous 10
strength 10
or 10
weakness 10
then 10
when 10
his 10
face 10
grew 10
grave 10
and 10
stern 10
again 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
why 10
his 10
mirth 10
and 10
why 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
time 10
his 10
reply 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
characteristic 10
of 10
him 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
logical 10
and 10
forceful 10
and 10
mysterious 10
he 10
said 10
ah 10
you 10
dont 10
comprehend 10
friend 10
john 10
do 10
not 10
think 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
sad 10
though 10
i 10
laugh 10
see 10
i 10
have 10
cried 10
even 10
when 10
the 10
laugh 10
did 10
choke 10
me 10
but 10
no 10
more 10
think 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
all 10
sorry 10
when 10
i 10
cry 10
for 10
the 10
laugh 10
he 10
come 10
just 10
the 10
same 10
keep 10
it 10
always 10
with 10
you 10

laughter 10

at 10
your 10
door 10
and 10
say 10
may 10
i 10
come 10
in 10

not 10
true 10
laughter 10

king 10
and 10
he 10

when 10
and 10
how 10

suitability 10

he 10
play 10
bleeding 10
hearts 10
and 10
dry 10
bones 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
and 10
tears 10
that 10
burn 10
as 10
they 10
fall 10
all 10
dance 10
together 10
to 10
the 10
music 10
that 10
he 10
make 10
with 10
that 10
smileless 10
mouth 10
of 10
him 10
and 10
believe 10
me 10
friend 10
john 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
good 10
to 10
come 10
and 10
kind 10
ah 10
we 10
men 10
and 10
women 10
are 10
like 10
ropes 10
drawn 10
tight 10
with 10
strain 10
that 10
pull 10
us 10
different 10
ways 10
then 10
tears 10
come 10
and 10
like 10
the 10
rain 10
on 10
the 10
ropes 10
they 10
brace 10
us 10
up 10
until 10
perhaps 10
the 10
strain 10
become 10
too 10
great 10
and 10
we 10
break 10
but 10
king 10
laugh 10
he 10
come 10
like 10
the 10
sunshine 10
and 10
he 10
ease 10
off 10
the 10
strain 10
again 10
and 10
we 10
bear 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
with 10
our 10
labor 10
what 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
like 10
to 10
wound 10
him 10
by 10
pretending 10
not 10
to 10
see 10
his 10
idea 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
yet 10
understand 10
the 10
cause 10
of 10
his 10
laughter 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
answered 10
me 10
his 10
face 10
grew 10
stern 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
quite 10
a 10
different 10
tone 10
oh 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
grim 10
irony 10
of 10
it 10
all 10
this 10
so 10
lovely 10
lady 10
garlanded 10
with 10
flowers 10
that 10
looked 10
so 10
fair 10
as 10
life 10
till 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
we 10
wondered 10
if 10
she 10
were 10
truly 10
dead 10
she 10
laid 10
in 10
that 10
so 10
fine 10
marble 10
house 10
in 10
that 10
lonely 10
churchyard 10
where 10
rest 10
so 10
many 10
of 10
her 10
kin 10
laid 10
there 10
with 10
the 10
mother 10
who 10
loved 10
her 10
and 10
whom 10
she 10
loved 10
and 10
that 10
sacred 10
bell 10
going 10
toll 10
toll 10
toll 10
so 10
sad 10
and 10
slow 10
and 10
those 10
holy 10
men 10
with 10
the 10
white 10
garments 10
of 10
the 10
angel 10
pretending 10
to 10
read 10
books 10
and 10
yet 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
their 10
eyes 10
never 10
on 10
the 10
page 10
and 10
all 10
of 10
us 10
with 10
the 10
bowed 10
head 10
and 10
all 10
for 10
what 10
she 10
is 10
dead 10
so 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
well 10
for 10
the 10
life 10
of 10
me 10
professor 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
cant 10
see 10
anything 10
to 10
laugh 10
at 10
in 10
all 10
that 10
why 10
your 10
expression 10
makes 10
it 10
a 10
harder 10
puzzle 10
than 10
before 10
but 10
even 10
if 10
the 10
burial 10
service 10
was 10
comic 10
what 10
about 10
poor 10
art 10
and 10
his 10
trouble 10
why 10
his 10
heart 10
was 10
simply 10
breaking 10
just 10
so 10
said 10
he 10
not 10
that 10
the 10
transfusion 10
of 10
his 10
blood 10
to 10
her 10
veins 10
had 10
made 10
her 10
truly 10
his 10
bride 10
yes 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
sweet 10
and 10
comforting 10
idea 10
for 10
him 10
quite 10
so 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
difficulty 10
friend 10
john 10
if 10
so 10
that 10
then 10
what 10
about 10
the 10
others 10
ho 10
ho 10
then 10
this 10
so 10
sweet 10
maid 10
is 10
a 10
polyandrist 10
and 10
me 10
with 10
my 10
poor 10
wife 10
dead 10
to 10
me 10
but 10
alive 10
by 10
churchs 10
law 10
though 10
no 10
wits 10
all 10
gone 10
even 10
i 10
who 10
am 10
faithful 10
husband 10
to 10
this 10
nownowife 10
am 10
bigamist 10
i 10
dont 10
see 10
where 10
the 10
joke 10
comes 10
in 10
there 10
either 10
i 10
said 10
and 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
feel 10
particularly 10
pleased 10
with 10
him 10
for 10
saying 10
such 10
things 10
he 10
laid 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
my 10
arm 10
and 10
said 10
friend 10
john 10
forgive 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
pain 10
i 10
showed 10
not 10
my 10
feeling 10
to 10
others 10
when 10
it 10
would 10
wound 10
but 10
only 10
to 10
you 10
my 10
old 10
friend 10
whom 10
i 10
can 10
trust 10
if 10
you 10
could 10
have 10
looked 10
into 10
my 10
heart 10
then 10
when 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
laugh 10
if 10
you 10
could 10
have 10
done 10
so 10
when 10
the 10
laugh 10
arrived 10
if 10
you 10
could 10
do 10
so 10
now 10
when 10
king 10
laugh 10
have 10
pack 10
up 10
his 10
crown 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
is 10
to 10
him 10
for 10
he 10
go 10
far 10
far 10
away 10
from 10
me 10
and 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
long 10
time 10
maybe 10
you 10
would 10
perhaps 10
pity 10
me 10
the 10
most 10
of 10
all 10
i 10
was 10
touched 10
by 10
the 10
tenderness 10
of 10
his 10
tone 10
and 10
asked 10
why 10
because 10
i 10
know 10
and 10
now 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
scattered 10
and 10
for 10
many 10
a 10
long 10
day 10
loneliness 10
will 10
sit 10
over 10
our 10
roofs 10
with 10
brooding 10
wings 10
lucy 10
lies 10
in 10
the 10
tomb 10
of 10
her 10
kin 10

lordly 10

house 10
in 10
a 10
lonely 10
churchyard 10
away 10
from 10
teeming 10
london 10
where 10
the 10
air 10
is 10
fresh 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
rises 10
over 10
hampstead 10

and 10
where 10
wild 10
flowers 10
grow 10
of 10

a 10
hampstead 10
mystery 10
the 10
neighborhood 10
of 10
hampstead 10
is 10
just 10
at 10
present 10
exercised 10
with 10
a 10
series 10
of 10
events 10
which 10
seem 10
to 10
run 10
on 10
lines 10
parallel 10
to 10
those 10
of 10
what 10
was 10
known 10
to 10
the 10
writers 10
of 10
headlines 10
and 10
the 10
kensington 10
horror 10
or 10
the 10
stabbing 10
woman 10
or 10
the 10
woman 10
in 10
black 10
during 10
the 10
past 10
two 10
or 10
three 10
days 10
several 10
cases 10
have 10
occurred 10
of 10
young 10
children 10
straying 10
from 10
home 10
or 10
neglecting 10
to 10
return 10
from 10
their 10
playing 10
on 10
the 10
heath 10
in 10
all 10
these 10
cases 10
the 10
children 10
were 10
too 10
young 10
to 10
give 10
any 10
properly 10
intelligible 10
account 10
of 10
themselves 10
but 10
the 10
consensus 10
of 10
their 10
excuses 10
is 10
that 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
with 10
a 10
bloofer 10
lady 10
it 10
has 10
always 10
been 10
late 10
in 10
the 10
evening 10
when 10
they 10
have 10
been 10
missed 10
and 10
on 10
two 10
occasions 10
the 10
children 10
have 10
not 10
been 10
found 10
until 10
early 10
in 10
the 10
following 10
morning 10
it 10
is 10
generally 10
supposed 10
in 10
the 10
neighborhood 10
that 10
as 10
the 10
first 10
child 10
missed 10
gave 10
as 10
his 10
reason 10
for 10
being 10
away 10
that 10
a 10
bloofer 10
lady 10
had 10
asked 10
him 10
to 10
come 10
for 10
a 10
walk 10
the 10
others 10
had 10
picked 10
up 10
the 10
phrase 10
and 10
used 10
it 10
as 10
occasion 10
served 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
more 10
natural 10
as 10
the 10
favorite 10
game 10
of 10
the 10
little 10

of 10

he 10
says 10
take 10
a 10
lesson 10

the 10
irony 10

comparing 10
the 10

the 10

only 10
in 10
accordance 10
with 10
general 10
principles 10
of 10
human 10
nature 10

some 10
of 10
these 10
grubbyfaced 10

children 10
pretend 10
and 10
even 10
imagine 10
themselves 10
to 10
be 10
there 10
is 10
however 10
possibly 10
a 10
serious 10
side 10
to 10
the 10
question 10
for 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
children 10
indeed 10
all 10
who 10
have 10
been 10
missed 10
at 10
night 10
have 10
been 10
slightly 10
torn 10

wounded 10
in 10
the 10
throat 10
the 10
wounds 10

such 10

might 10
be 10
made 10
by 10
a 10

throat 10
as 10
has 10
been 10
noticed 10
in 10
other 10
cases 10
it 10
was 10
terribly 10
weak 10
and 10
looked 10
quite 10
emaciated 10
it 10
too 10
when 10
partially 10
restored 10
had 10
the 10
common 10
story 10
to 10

better 10
after 10
a 10
bad 10
night 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
glad 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
plenty 10
of 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
for 10
that 10
keeps 10
his 10
mind 10
off 10
the 10
terrible 10
things 10
and 10
oh 10
i 10
am 10
rejoiced 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
now 10
weighed 10
down 10
with 10
the 10
responsibility 10
of 10
his 10
new 10
position 10
i 10
knew 10
he 10
would 10
be 10
true 10
to 10
himself 10
and 10
now 10
how 10
proud 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
see 10
my 10
jonathan 10
rising 10
to 10
the 10
height 10
of 10
his 10
advancement 10
and 10
keeping 10
pace 10
in 10
all 10
ways 10
with 10
the 10
duties 10
that 10
come 10
upon 10
him 10
he 10
will 10
be 10
away 10
all 10
day 10
till 10
late 10
for 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
lunch 10
at 10
home 10
my 10
household 10
work 10
is 10
done 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
his 10
foreign 10
journal 10
and 10
lock 10
myself 10
up 10
in 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
read 10
it 10
septemberi 10
hadnt 10
the 10
heart 10
to 10
write 10
last 10
night 10
that 10
terrible 10
record 10
of 10
jonathans 10
upset 10
me 10
so 10
poor 10
dear 10
how 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
suffered 10
whether 10
it 10
be 10
true 10
or 10
only 10
imagination 10
i 10
wonder 10
if 10
there 10
is 10
any 10
truth 10
in 10
it 10
at 10
all 10
did 10
he 10
get 10
his 10
brain 10
fever 10
and 10
then 10
write 10
all 10
those 10
terrible 10
things 10
or 10
had 10
he 10
some 10
cause 10
for 10
it 10
all 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
know 10
for 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
open 10
the 10
subject 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
yet 10
that 10
man 10
we 10
saw 10
yesterday 10
he 10
seemed 10
quite 10
certain 10
of 10
him 10
poor 10
fellow 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
funeral 10
upset 10
him 10
and 10
sent 10
his 10
mind 10
back 10
on 10
some 10
train 10
of 10
thought 10
he 10
believes 10
it 10
all 10
himself 10
i 10
remember 10
how 10
on 10
our 10
wedding 10
day 10
he 10
said 10
unless 10
some 10
solemn 10
duty 10
come 10
upon 10
me 10
to 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
bitter 10
hours 10
asleep 10
or 10
awake 10
mad 10
or 10
sane 10
there 10
seems 10
to 10
be 10
through 10
it 10
all 10
some 10
thread 10
of 10
continuity 10
that 10
fearful 10
count 10
was 10
coming 10
to 10
london 10
if 10
it 10
should 10
be 10
and 10
he 10
came 10
to 10
london 10
with 10
its 10
teeming 10
millions 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
a 10
solemn 10
duty 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
come 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
shrink 10
from 10
it 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
prepared 10
i 10
shall 10
get 10
my 10
typewriter 10
this 10
very 10
hour 10
and 10
begin 10
transcribing 10
then 10
we 10
shall 10
be 10
ready 10
for 10
other 10
eyes 10
if 10
required 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
wanted 10
then 10
perhaps 10
if 10
i 10
am 10
ready 10
poor 10
jonathan 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
upset 10
for 10
i 10
can 10
speak 10
for 10
him 10
and 10
never 10
let 10
him 10
be 10
troubled 10
or 10
worried 10
with 10
it 10
at 10
all 10
if 10
ever 10
jonathan 10
quite 10
gets 10
over 10
the 10
nervousness 10
he 10
may 10
want 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
of 10
it 10
all 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
ask 10
him 10
questions 10
and 10
find 10
out 10
things 10
and 10
see 10
how 10
i 10
may 10
comfort 10

cannot 10
help 10
feeling 10
terribly 10
excited 10
as 10
the 10
time 10

the 10

of 10
dr 10

expect 10
that 10
it 10
will 10
throw 10
some 10
light 10
upon 10
jonathans 10
sad 10
experience 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
attended 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucy 10
in 10
her 10
last 10
illness 10
he 10
can 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
about 10
her 10
that 10
is 10
the 10
reason 10
of 10
his 10
coming 10
it 10
is 10
concerning 10
lucy 10
and 10
her 10
sleepwalking 10
and 10
not 10
about 10
jonathan 10
then 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
know 10
the 10
real 10
truth 10
now 10
how 10
silly 10
i 10
am 10
that 10
awful 10
journal 10
gets 10
hold 10
of 10
my 10
imagination 10
and 10
tinges 10
everything 10
with 10
something 10
of 10
its 10
own 10
color 10
of 10
course 10
it 10
is 10
about 10
lucy 10
that 10
habit 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
and 10
that 10
awful 10
night 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
must 10
have 10
made 10
her 10
ill 10
i 10
had 10
almost 10
forgotten 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
affairs 10
how 10
ill 10
she 10
was 10
afterwards 10
she 10
must 10
have 10
told 10
him 10
of 10
her 10
sleepwalking 10
adventure 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
knew 10
all 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
now 10
he 10
wants 10
me 10
to 10
tell 10
him 10
what 10
i 10
know 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
may 10
understand 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
did 10
right 10
in 10
not 10
saying 10
anything 10
of 10
it 10
to 10
mrs 10
westenra 10
i 10
should 10
never 10
forgive 10
myself 10
if 10
any 10
act 10
of 10
mine 10
were 10
it 10
even 10
a 10
negative 10
one 10
brought 10
harm 10
on 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucy 10
i 10
hope 10
too 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
will 10
not 10
blame 10
me 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
so 10
much 10
trouble 10
and 10
anxiety 10
of 10
late 10
that 10
i 10
feel 10
i 10
cannot 10
bear 10
more 10
just 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
suppose 10
a 10
cry 10
does 10
us 10
all 10
good 10
at 10
times 10
clears 10
the 10
air 10
as 10
other 10
rain 10
does 10
perhaps 10
it 10
was 10
reading 10
the 10
journal 10
yesterday 10
that 10
upset 10
me 10
and 10
then 10
jonathan 10
went 10
away 10
this 10
morning 10
to 10
stay 10
away 10
from 10
me 10
a 10
whole 10
day 10
and 10
night 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
we 10
have 10
been 10
parted 10
since 10
our 10
marriage 10
i 10
do 10
hope 10
the 10
dear 10
fellow 10
will 10
take 10
care 10
of 10
himself 10
and 10
that 10
nothing 10
will 10
occur 10
to 10
upset 10
him 10
it 10
is 10
two 10
oclock 10
and 10
the 10
doctor 10
will 10
be 10
here 10
soon 10
now 10
i 10
shall 10
say 10
nothing 10
of 10
jonathans 10
journal 10
unless 10
he 10
asks 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
glad 10
i 10
have 10
typewritten 10
out 10
my 10
own 10
journal 10
so 10
that 10
in 10
case 10
he 10
asks 10
about 10
lucy 10
i 10
can 10
hand 10
it 10
to 10
him 10
it 10
will 10
save 10
much 10
questioning 10
laterhe 10
has 10
come 10
and 10
gone 10
oh 10
what 10
a 10
strange 10
meeting 10
and 10
how 10
it 10
all 10
makes 10
my 10
head 10
whirl 10
round 10
i 10
feel 10
like 10
one 10
in 10
a 10
dream 10
can 10
it 10
be 10
all 10
possible 10
or 10
even 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
it 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
read 10
jonathans 10
journal 10
first 10
i 10
should 10
never 10
have 10
accepted 10
even 10
a 10
possibility 10
poor 10
poor 10
dear 10
jonathan 10
how 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
suffered 10

the 10
good 10
god 10
all 10
this 10
may 10
not 10
upset 10
him 10
again 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
save 10
him 10
from 10
it 10
but 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
even 10
a 10
consolation 10
and 10
a 10
help 10
to 10
him 10
terrible 10
though 10
it 10
be 10
and 10
awful 10
in 10
its 10
consequences 10
to 10
know 10
for 10
certain 10
that 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
ears 10
and 10
brain 10
did 10
not 10
deceive 10
him 10
and 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
true 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
doubt 10
which 10
haunts 10
him 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
doubt 10
is 10
removed 10
no 10
matter 10
which 10
waking 10
or 10
dreaming 10
may 10
prove 10
the 10
truth 10
he 10
will 10
be 10
more 10
satisfied 10
and 10
better 10
able 10
to 10
bear 10
the 10
shock 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
must 10
be 10
a 10
good 10
man 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
a 10
clever 10
one 10
if 10
he 10
is 10
arthurs 10
friend 10
and 10
dr 10
sewards 10
and 10
if 10
they 10
brought 10
him 10
all 10
the 10
way 10
from 10
holland 10
to 10
look 10
after 10
lucy 10
i 10
feel 10
from 10
having 10
seen 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
good 10
and 10
kind 10
and 10
of 10
a 10
noble 10
nature 10
when 10
he 10
comes 10
tomorrow 10
i 10
shall 10
ask 10
him 10
about 10
jonathan 10
and 10
then 10
please 10
god 10
all 10
this 10
sorrow 10
and 10
anxiety 10
may 10
lead 10
to 10
a 10
good 10
end 10
i 10
used 10
to 10
think 10
i 10
would 10
like 10
to 10
practice 10
interviewing 10
jonathans 10
friend 10
on 10
the 10
exeter 10
news 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
memory 10
is 10
everything 10
in 10
such 10
work 10
that 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
put 10
down 10
exactly 10
almost 10
every 10
word 10
spoken 10
even 10
if 10
you 10
had 10
to 10
refine 10
some 10
of 10
it 10
afterwards 10
here 10
was 10
a 10
rare 10
interview 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
record 10
it 10
verbatim 10
it 10
was 10
halfpast 10
two 10
oclock 10
when 10
the 10
knock 10
came 10
i 10
took 10
my 10
courage 10
a 10
deux 10
mains 10
and 10
waited 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
mary 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
announced 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
rose 10
and 10
bowed 10
and 10
he 10
came 10
towards 10
me 10
a 10
man 10
of 10
medium 10
weight 10
strongly 10
built 10
with 10
his 10
shoulders 10
set 10
back 10
over 10
a 10
broad 10
deep 10
chest 10
and 10
a 10
neck 10
well 10
balanced 10
on 10
the 10
trunk 10
as 10
the 10
head 10
is 10
on 10
the 10
neck 10
the 10
poise 10
of 10
the 10
head 10
strikes 10
me 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
indicative 10
of 10
thought 10
and 10
power 10
the 10
head 10
is 10
noble 10
wellsized 10
broad 10
and 10
large 10
behind 10
the 10
ears 10
the 10
face 10
cleanshaven 10
shows 10
a 10
hard 10
square 10
chin 10
a 10
large 10
resolute 10
mobile 10
mouth 10
a 10
goodsized 10
nose 10
rather 10
straight 10
but 10
with 10
quick 10
sensitive 10
nostrils 10
that 10
seem 10
to 10
broaden 10
as 10
the 10
big 10
bushy 10
brows 10
come 10
down 10
and 10
the 10
mouth 10
tightens 10
the 10
forehead 10
is 10
broad 10
and 10
fine 10
rising 10
at 10
first 10
almost 10
straight 10
and 10
then 10
sloping 10
back 10
above 10
two 10
bumps 10
or 10
ridges 10
wide 10
apart 10
such 10
a 10
forehead 10
that 10
the 10
reddish 10
hair 10
cannot 10
possibly 10
tumble 10
over 10
it 10
but 10
falls 10
naturally 10
back 10
and 10
to 10
the 10
sides 10
big 10
dark 10
blue 10
eyes 10
are 10
set 10
widely 10
apart 10
and 10
are 10
quick 10
and 10
tender 10
or 10
stern 10
with 10
the 10
mans 10
moods 10
he 10
said 10

good 10
but 10
i 10
had 10
yet 10
to 10
learn 10
he 10
finished 10
his 10
speech 10
with 10
a 10
courtly 10
bow 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
about 10

he 10
at 10

your 10
letters 10
to 10

me 10
but 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
begin 10
to 10
inquire 10
somewhere 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
none 10
to 10
ask 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
with 10
her 10
at 10

she 10
sometimes 10
kept 10
a 10
diary 10
you 10
need 10
not 10
look 10
surprised 10
madam 10
mina 10
it 10
was 10
begun 10
after 10
you 10
had 10
left 10
and 10
was 10
an 10
imitation 10
of 10
you 10
and 10
in 10
that 10
diary 10
she 10
traces 10
by 10
inference 10
certain 10
things 10
to 10
a 10
sleepwalking 10
in 10
which 10
she 10
puts 10
down 10
that 10
you 10
saved 10
her 10
in 10
great 10
perplexity 10
then 10
i 10
come 10
to 10
you 10
and 10
ask 10
you 10
out 10
of 10
your 10
so 10
much 10
kindness 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
of 10
it 10
that 10
you 10
can 10

tell 10
you 10

dr 10
van 10
helsing 10

you 10
have 10
good 10
memory 10
for 10
facts 10
for 10
details 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
always 10
so 10
with 10
young 10
ladies 10
no 10
doctor 10
but 10
i 10
wrote 10
it 10
all 10
down 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
can 10
show 10
it 10
to 10
you 10

be 10
grateful 10
you 10
will 10
do 10
me 10
much 10
favor 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
resist 10
the 10
temptation 10
of 10
mystifying 10
him 10
a 10
bit 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
some 10
taste 10
of 10
the 10
original 10
apple 10
that 10
remains 10
still 10
in 10
our 10
mouths 10
so 10
i 10
handed 10
him 10
the 10
shorthand 10
diary 10
he 10
took 10
it 10
with 10
a 10
grateful 10
bow 10
and 10
said 10
may 10
i 10
read 10
it 10
if 10
you 10
wish 10
i 10
answered 10
as 10
demurely 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
he 10
opened 10
it 10
and 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
his 10
face 10
fell 10
then 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
bowed 10
oh 10
you 10
so 10
clever 10
woman 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
knew 10
long 10
that 10
mr 10
jonathan 10
was 10
a 10
man 10
of 10
much 10
thankfulness 10
but 10
see 10
his 10
wife 10
have 10
all 10
the 10
good 10
things 10
and 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
so 10
much 10
honor 10
me 10
and 10
so 10
help 10
me 10
as 10
to 10
read 10
it 10
for 10
me 10
alas 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
the 10
shorthand 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
my 10
little 10
joke 10
was 10
over 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
almost 10
ashamed 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
typewritten 10
copy 10
from 10
my 10
work 10
basket 10
and 10
handed 10
it 10
to 10
him 10
forgive 10
me 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
help 10
it 10
but 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
thinking 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
of 10
dear 10
lucy 10
that 10
you 10
wished 10
to 10
ask 10
and 10
so 10
that 10
you 10
might 10
not 10
have 10
time 10
to 10
wait 10
not 10
on 10
my 10
account 10
but 10
because 10
i 10
know 10
your 10
time 10
must 10
be 10
precious 10
i 10
have 10
written 10
it 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
typewriter 10
for 10
you 10
he 10
took 10
it 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
glistened 10
you 10
are 10
so 10
good 10
he 10
said 10
and 10
may 10
i 10
read 10
it 10
now 10
i 10
may 10
want 10
to 10
ask 10
you 10
some 10
things 10
when 10
i 10
have 10
read 10
by 10
all 10
means 10
i 10
said 10
read 10
it 10
over 10
whilst 10
i 10
order 10
lunch 10
and 10
then 10
you 10
can 10
ask 10
me 10
questions 10
whilst 10
we 10
eat 10
he 10
bowed 10
and 10
settled 10
himself 10
in 10
a 10
chair 10
with 10
his 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
light 10
and 10
became 10
so 10
absorbed 10
in 10
the 10
papers 10
whilst 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
see 10
after 10
lunch 10
chiefly 10
in 10
order 10
that 10
he 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
disturbed 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
walking 10
hurriedly 10
up 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
room 10
his 10
face 10
all 10
ablaze 10
with 10
excitement 10
he 10
rushed 10
up 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
took 10
me 10
by 10
both 10
hands 10
oh 10
madam 10
mina 10
he 10
said 10

what 10
i 10
owe 10
to 10

the 10
gate 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
dazed 10
i 10
am 10
dazzled 10
with 10
so 10
much 10
light 10
and 10
yet 10
clouds 10
roll 10
in 10
behind 10
the 10
light 10
every 10
time 10
but 10
that 10
you 10
do 10

an 10
opening 10
to 10
ask 10

about 10
jonathan 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
he 10
was 10
almost 10
recovered 10
but 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
greatly 10
upset 10
by 10
mr 10
hawkins 10
death 10
he 10
interrupted 10
oh 10

i 10
know 10
i 10
have 10
read 10
your 10
last 10
two 10
letters 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
suppose 10
this 10
upset 10
him 10
for 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
in 10
town 10
on 10
thursday 10
last 10
he 10
had 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
shock 10
a 10
shock 10
and 10
after 10
brain 10
fever 10
so 10
soon 10
that 10
is 10
not 10
good 10
what 10
kind 10
of 10
shock 10
was 10
it 10
he 10
thought 10
he 10
saw 10
some 10
one 10
who 10
recalled 10
something 10
terrible 10
something 10
which 10
led 10
to 10
his 10
brain 10
fever 10
and 10
here 10
the 10
whole 10
thing 10
seemed 10
to 10
overwhelm 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
rush 10
the 10
pity 10
for 10
jonathan 10
the 10
horror 10
which 10
he 10
experienced 10
the 10
whole 10
fearful 10
mystery 10
of 10
his 10
diary 10
and 10
the 10
fear 10
that 10
has 10
been 10
brooding 10
over 10
me 10
ever 10
since 10
all 10
came 10
in 10
a 10
tumult 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
was 10
hysterical 10
for 10
i 10
threw 10
myself 10
on 10
my 10
knees 10
and 10
held 10
up 10
my 10
hands 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
implored 10
him 10
to 10
make 10
my 10
husband 10
well 10
again 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
hands 10
and 10
raised 10
me 10
up 10
and 10
made 10
me 10
sit 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
and 10
sat 10
by 10
me 10
he 10
held 10
my 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
with 10
oh 10
such 10
infinite 10
sweetness 10
my 10
life 10
is 10
a 10
barren 10
and 10
lonely 10
one 10
and 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
work 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
had 10
much 10
time 10
for 10
friendships 10
but 10
since 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
summoned 10
to 10
here 10
by 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
seward 10
i 10
have 10
known 10
so 10
many 10
good 10
people 10
and 10
seen 10
such 10
nobility 10
that 10
i 10
feel 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
it 10
has 10
grown 10
with 10
my 10
advancing 10
years 10
the 10
loneliness 10
of 10
my 10
life 10
believe 10

over 10
what 10
you 10
have 10

eat 10
now 10
afterwards 10
you 10

when 10
we 10
went 10
back 10
to 10

said 10
to 10

me 10
all 10
about 10
him 10
when 10
it 10
came 10
to 10
speaking 10
to 10
this 10
great 10
learned 10
man 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
fear 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
think 10
me 10
a 10
weak 10
fool 10
and 10
jonathan 10
a 10
madman 10
that 10
journal 10
is 10
all 10
so 10
strange 10
and 10
i 10
hesitated 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
but 10
he 10
was 10
so 10
sweet 10
and 10
kind 10
and 10
he 10
had 10
promised 10
to 10
help 10
and 10
i 10
trusted 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
what 10
i 10
have 10
to 10
tell 10
you 10
is 10
so 10
queer 10
that 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
laugh 10
at 10
me 10
or 10
at 10
my 10
husband 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
since 10
yesterday 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
fever 10
of 10
doubt 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
kind 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
not 10
think 10
me 10
foolish 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
even 10
half 10
believed 10
some 10
very 10
strange 10
things 10
he 10
reassured 10
me 10
by 10
his 10
manner 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
his 10
words 10
when 10
he 10
said 10
oh 10
my 10
dear 10
if 10
you 10
only 10
know 10
how 10
strange 10
is 10
the 10
matter 10
regarding 10
which 10
i 10
am 10
here 10
it 10
is 10
you 10
who 10
would 10
laugh 10
i 10
have 10
learned 10
not 10
to 10
think 10
little 10
of 10
any 10
ones 10
belief 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
strange 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
i 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
keep 10
an 10
open 10
mind 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
the 10
ordinary 10
things 10
of 10
life 10
that 10
could 10
close 10
it 10
but 10
the 10
strange 10
things 10
the 10
extraordinary 10
things 10
the 10
things 10
that 10
make 10
one 10
doubt 10
if 10
they 10
be 10
mad 10
or 10
sane 10
thank 10
you 10
thank 10
you 10
a 10
thousand 10
times 10

weight 10
off 10
my 10
mind 10

septemberi 10
thought 10
never 10
to 10
write 10
in 10
this 10
diary 10
again 10
but 10
the 10
time 10
has 10
come 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
home 10
last 10
night 10
mina 10
had 10
supper 10
ready 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
supped 10
she 10
told 10
me 10
of 10
van 10
helsings 10

and 10
of 10
her 10
having 10
given 10
him 10
the 10
two 10
diaries 10
copied 10
out 10
and 10
of 10
how 10
anxious 10
she 10
has 10
been 10
about 10
me 10
she 10
showed 10
me 10
in 10
the 10
doctors 10
letter 10
that 10
all 10
i 10
wrote 10
down 10
was 10
true 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
made 10
a 10
new 10
man 10
of 10
me 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
doubt 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
reality 10
of 10
the 10
whole 10
thing 10
that 10
knocked 10
me 10
over 10
i 10
felt 10
impotent 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
and 10
distrustful 10
but 10
now 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
afraid 10
even 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
he 10
has 10
succeeded 10
after 10
all 10
then 10
in 10
his 10
design 10
in 10
getting 10
to 10
london 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
he 10
i 10
saw 10
he 10
has 10
got 10
younger 10
and 10
how 10
van 10
helsing 10
is 10
the 10
man 10
to 10
unmask 10
him 10
and 10
hunt 10
him 10
out 10
if 10
he 10
is 10
anything 10
like 10
what 10
mina 10
says 10
we 10
sat 10
late 10
and 10
talked 10
it 10
over 10
mina 10

dressing 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
call 10
at 10
the 10
hotel 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
and 10
bring 10
him 10
over 10
he 10
was 10
i 10
think 10
surprised 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
whee 10
he 10
was 10
and 10
introduced 10
myself 10
he 10
took 10
me 10
by 10
the 10
shoulder 10
and 10
turned 10
my 10
face 10
round 10
to 10
the 10
light 10
and 10
said 10
after 10
a 10
sharp 10
scrutiny 10
but 10
madam 10
mina 10
told 10
me 10
you 10
were 10
ill 10
that 10
you 10
had 10
had 10
a 10
shock 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
funny 10
to 10
hear 10
my 10
wife 10
called 10
madam 10
mina 10
by 10
this 10
kindly 10
strongfaced 10
old 10
man 10
i 10
smiled 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
was 10
ill 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
shock 10
but 10
you 10
have 10
cured 10
me 10
already 10
and 10
how 10
by 10
your 10
letter 10
to 10
mina 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
doubt 10
and 10
then 10
everything 10
took 10
a 10
hue 10
of 10
unreality 10
and 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
trust 10
even 10
the 10
evidence 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
senses 10
not 10
knowing 10
what 10
to 10
trust 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
so 10
had 10
only 10
to 10
keep 10
on 10
working 10
in 10
what 10
had 10
hitherto 10
been 10
the 10
groove 10
of 10
my 10
life 10
the 10
groove 10
ceased 10
to 10
avail 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
mistrusted 10
myself 10
doctor 10
you 10
dont 10
know 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
doubt 10
everything 10
even 10
yourself 10
no 10
you 10
dont 10
you 10
couldnt 10
with 10
eyebrows 10
like 10
yours 10
he 10
seemed 10
pleased 10
and 10
laughed 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
so 10
you 10
are 10
a 10
physiognomist 10
i 10
learn 10
more 10
here 10
with 10
each 10
hour 10
i 10
am 10
with 10
so 10
much 10
pleasure 10
coming 10
to 10
you 10
to 10
breakfast 10
and 10
oh 10
sir 10
you 10
will 10
pardon 10
praise 10
from 10
an 10
old 10
man 10
but 10
you 10
are 10
blessed 10
in 10
your 10
wife 10
i 10
would 10
listen 10
to 10
him 10
go 10
on 10
praising 10
mina 10
for 10
a 10
day 10
so 10
i 10
simply 10
nodded 10
and 10
stood 10
silent 10
she 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
gods 10
women 10
fashioned 10
by 10
his 10
own 10
hand 10
to 10
show 10
us 10
men 10
and 10
other 10
women 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
heaven 10
where 10
we 10
can 10
enter 10
and 10
that 10
its 10
light 10
can 10
be 10
here 10
on 10
earth 10
so 10
true 10
so 10
sweet 10
so 10
noble 10
so 10
little 10
an 10
egoist 10
and 10
that 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
is 10
much 10
in 10
this 10
age 10
so 10
sceptical 10
and 10
selfish 10
and 10
you 10
sir 10
i 10
have 10
read 10
all 10
the 10

and 10
some 10
of 10
them 10
speak 10
of 10
you 10
so 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
since 10
some 10
days 10
from 10

of 10
others 10
but 10

us 10
be 10
friends 10
for 10
all 10
our 10
lives 10
we 10
shook 10
hands 10
and 10
he 10
was 10
so 10
earnest 10
and 10
so 10
kind 10
that 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
quite 10
choky 10
and 10
now 10
he 10
said 10

you 10
for 10
some 10
more 10
help 10

may 10
ask 10
more 10
help 10
and 10
of 10
a 10
different 10
kind 10
but 10

after 10

i 10
saw 10
him 10
to 10
the 10
station 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
parting 10
he 10
said 10

waiting 10
for 10

to 10
start 10
he 10
was 10
turning 10
them 10
over 10
his 10
eyes 10
suddenly 10
seemed 10
to 10
catch 10
something 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
the 10
westminster 10
gazette 10
i 10
knew 10
it 10
by 10
the 10
color 10
and 10
he 10
grew 10
quite 10
white 10
he 10
read 10
something 10
intently 10
groaning 10
to 10
himself 10
mein 10
gott 10
mein 10
gott 10
so 10
soon 10
so 10

he 10
remembered 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
just 10
then 10
the 10
whistle 10
blew 10
and 10
the 10
train 10
moved 10
off 10
this 10
recalled 10
him 10
to 10
himself 10
and 10
he 10
leaned 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
waved 10
his 10
hand 10
calling 10
out 10
love 10
to 10
madam 10
mina 10
i 10

there 10

no 10
such 10
thing 10
as 10
finality 10
not 10
a 10
week 10
since 10
i 10
said 10
finis 10
and 10
yet 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
starting 10
fresh 10
again 10
or 10
rather 10
going 10
on 10
with 10
the 10
record 10
until 10
this 10
afternoon 10
i 10
had 10
no 10
cause 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
what 10
is 10
done 10
renfield 10
had 10
become 10
to 10
all 10
intents 10
as 10
sane 10
as 10
he 10
ever 10
was 10
he 10
was 10
already 10
well 10
ahead 10
with 10
his 10
fly 10
business 10
and 10
he 10
had 10
just 10
started 10
in 10
the 10
spider 10
line 10
also 10
so 10
he 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
of 10
any 10
trouble 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
letter 10
from 10
arthur 10
written 10
on 10
sunday 10
and 10
from 10
it 10
i 10
gather 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
bearing 10
up 10
wonderfully 10
well 10
quincey 10
morris 10
is 10
with 10
him 10
and 10
that 10
is 10
much 10
of 10
a 10
help 10
for 10
he 10
himself 10
is 10
a 10
bubbling 10
well 10
of 10
good 10
spirits 10
quincey 10
wrote 10
me 10
a 10
line 10
too 10
and 10
from 10
him 10
i 10
hear 10
that 10
arthur 10
is 10
beginning 10
to 10
recover 10
something 10
of 10
his 10
old 10
buoyancy 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
them 10
all 10
my 10
mind 10
is 10
at 10
rest 10
as 10
for 10
myself 10
i 10
was 10
settling 10
down 10
to 10
my 10
work 10
with 10
the 10
enthusiasm 10
which 10
i 10
used 10
to 10
have 10
for 10
it 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
fairly 10
have 10
said 10
that 10
the 10
wound 10
which 10
poor 10
lucy 10
left 10
on 10
me 10
was 10
becoming 10
cicatrised 10
everything 10
is 10
however 10
now 10
reopened 10
and 10
what 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
the 10
end 10
god 10
only 10
knows 10
i 10
have 10
an 10
idea 10
that 10
van 10
helsing 10
thinks 10
he 10
knows 10
too 10
but 10
he 10
will 10
only 10
let 10
out 10
enough 10
at 10
a 10
time 10
to 10
whet 10
curiosity 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
exeter 10
yesterday 10
and 10
stayed 10
there 10
all 10
night 10
today 10
he 10
came 10
back 10
and 10
almost 10
bounded 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
at 10
about 10
halfpast 10
five 10
oclock 10
and 10
thrust 10
last 10
nights 10
westminster 10
gazette 10
into 10
my 10
hand 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
think 10
of 10
that 10
he 10
asked 10
as 10
he 10
stood 10
back 10
and 10
folded 10
his 10
arms 10
i 10
looked 10
over 10
the 10
paper 10
for 10
i 10
really 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
he 10
meant 10
but 10
he 10
took 10
it 10
from 10
me 10
and 10
pointed 10
out 10
a 10
paragraph 10
about 10
children 10
being 10
decoyed 10
away 10
at 10
hampstead 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
convey 10
much 10
to 10
me 10
until 10
i 10
reached 10
a 10
passage 10
where 10
it 10
described 10
small 10
puncture 10
wounds 10
on 10
their 10
throats 10
an 10
idea 10
struck 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
up 10
well 10
he 10
said 10
it 10
is 10
like 10
poor 10
lucys 10
and 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
make 10
of 10
it 10
simply 10
that 10
there 10
is 10
some 10
cause 10
in 10
common 10
whatever 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
injured 10
her 10
has 10
injured 10
them 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
quite 10
understand 10
his 10
answer 10
that 10
is 10
true 10
indirectly 10
but 10
not 10
directly 10
how 10
do 10
you 10
mean 10
professor 10
i 10
asked 10
i 10
was 10
a 10
little 10
inclined 10
to 10
take 10
his 10
seriousness 10
lightly 10
for 10
after 10
all 10
four 10
days 10
of 10
rest 10
and 10
freedom 10
from 10
burning 10
harrowing 10
anxiety 10
does 10
help 10
to 10
restore 10
ones 10
spirits 10
but 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
his 10
face 10
it 10
sobered 10
me 10
never 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
our 10
despair 10
about 10
poor 10
lucy 10
had 10
he 10
looked 10
more 10
stern 10
tell 10
me 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
can 10
hazard 10
no 10
opinion 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
think 10
and 10
i 10
have 10
no 10
data 10
on 10
which 10
to 10
found 10
a 10
conjecture 10
do 10
you 10
mean 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
friend 10
john 10
that 10
you 10
have 10
no 10
suspicion 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
poor 10
lucy 10
died 10
of 10
not 10
after 10
all 10
the 10
hints 10
given 10
not 10
only 10
by 10
events 10
but 10
by 10
me 10
of 10
nervous 10
prostration 10
following 10
a 10
great 10
loss 10
or 10
waste 10
of 10
blood 10
and 10
how 10
was 10
the 10
blood 10
lost 10
or 10
wasted 10
i 10
shook 10
my 10
head 10
he 10
stepped 10
over 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
beside 10
me 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
you 10
are 10
a 10
clever 10
man 10
friend 10
john 10
you 10
reason 10
well 10
and 10
your 10
wit 10
is 10
bold 10
but 10
you 10
are 10
too 10
prejudiced 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
let 10
your 10
eyes 10
see 10
nor 10
your 10
ears 10
hear 10
and 10
that 10
which 10
is 10
outside 10
your 10
daily 10
life 10
is 10
not 10
of 10
account 10
to 10
you 10
do 10
you 10
not 10
think 10
that 10
there 10
are 10
things 10
which 10
you 10
cannot 10
understand 10
and 10
yet 10
which 10
are 10
that 10
some 10
people 10
see 10
things 10
that 10
others 10
cannot 10
but 10
there 10
are 10
things 10
old 10
and 10
new 10
which 10
must 10
not 10
be 10
contemplated 10
by 10
mens 10
eyes 10
because 10
they 10
know 10
or 10
think 10
they 10
know 10
some 10
things 10
which 10
other 10
men 10
have 10
told 10
them 10
ah 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
fault 10
of 10
our 10
science 10
that 10
it 10
wants 10
to 10
explain 10
all 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
explain 10
not 10
then 10
it 10
says 10
there 10
is 10
nothing 10
to 10
explain 10
but 10
yet 10
we 10
see 10
around 10
us 10
every 10
day 10
the 10
growth 10
of 10
new 10
beliefs 10
which 10
think 10
themselves 10
new 10
and 10
which 10
are 10
yet 10
but 10
the 10
old 10
which 10
pretend 10
to 10
be 10
young 10
like 10
the 10
fine 10
ladies 10
at 10
the 10
opera 10
i 10
suppose 10
now 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
believe 10
in 10
corporeal 10
transference 10
no 10
nor 10
in 10
materialization 10
no 10
nor 10
in 10
astral 10
bodies 10
no 10
nor 10
in 10
the 10
reading 10
of 10
thought 10
no 10
nor 10
in 10
hypnotism 10
yes 10
i 10
said 10
charcot 10
has 10
proved 10
that 10
pretty 10
well 10
he 10
smiled 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
then 10
you 10
are 10
satisfied 10
as 10
to 10
it 10
yes 10
and 10
of 10
course 10
then 10
you 10
understand 10
how 10
it 10
act 10
and 10
can 10
follow 10
the 10
mind 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
charcot 10
alas 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
no 10
more 10
into 10
the 10
very 10
soul 10
of 10
the 10
patient 10
that 10
he 10
influence 10
no 10
then 10
friend 10
john 10
am 10
i 10
to 10
take 10
it 10
that 10
you 10
simply 10
accept 10
fact 10
and 10
are 10
satisfied 10
to 10
let 10
from 10
premise 10
to 10
conclusion 10
be 10
a 10
blank 10
no 10
then 10
tell 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
student 10
of 10
the 10
brain 10
how 10
you 10
accept 10
hypnotism 10
and 10
reject 10
the 10
thought 10
reading 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
my 10
friend 10
that 10
there 10
are 10
things 10
done 10
today 10
in 10
electrical 10
science 10
which 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
deemed 10
unholy 10
by 10
the 10
very 10
man 10
who 10
discovered 10
electricity 10
who 10
would 10
themselves 10
not 10
so 10
long 10
before 10
been 10
burned 10
as 10
wizards 10
there 10
are 10
always 10
mysteries 10
in 10
life 10
why 10
was 10
it 10
that 10
methuselah 10
lived 10
nine 10
hundred 10
years 10
and 10
old 10
parrone 10
hundred 10
and 10
sixtynine 10
and 10
yet 10
that 10
poor 10
lucy 10
with 10
four 10
mens 10
blood 10
in 10
her 10
poor 10
veins 10
could 10
not 10
live 10
even 10
one 10
day 10
for 10
had 10
she 10
live 10
one 10
more 10
day 10
we 10
could 10
save 10
her 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
all 10
the 10
mystery 10
of 10
life 10
and 10
death 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
the 10
altogether 10
of 10
comparative 10
anatomy 10
and 10
can 10
say 10
wherefore 10
the 10
qualities 10
of 10
brutes 10
are 10
in 10
some 10
men 10
and 10
not 10
in 10
others 10
can 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
why 10
when 10
other 10
spiders 10
die 10
small 10
and 10
soon 10
that 10
one 10
great 10
spider 10
lived 10
for 10
centuries 10
in 10
the 10
tower 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
spanish 10
church 10
and 10
grew 10
and 10
grew 10
till 10
on 10
descending 10
he 10
could 10
drink 10
the 10
oil 10
of 10
all 10
the 10
church 10
lamps 10
can 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
why 10
in 10
the 10
pampas 10
ay 10
and 10
elsewhere 10
there 10
are 10
bats 10
that 10
come 10
out 10
at 10
night 10
and 10
open 10
the 10
veins 10
of 10
cattle 10
and 10
horses 10
and 10
suck 10
dry 10
their 10
veins 10
how 10
in 10
some 10
islands 10
of 10
the 10
western 10
seas 10
there 10
are 10
bats 10
which 10
hang 10
on 10
the 10
trees 10
all 10
day 10
and 10
those 10
who 10
have 10
seen 10
describe 10
as 10
like 10
giant 10
nuts 10
or 10
pods 10
and 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
sailors 10
sleep 10
on 10
the 10
deck 10
because 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
hot 10
flit 10
down 10
on 10
them 10
and 10
then 10
and 10
then 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
are 10
found 10
dead 10
men 10
white 10
as 10
even 10
miss 10
lucy 10
was 10
good 10
god 10

men 10
and 10
women 10
who 10
cannot 10
die 10
we 10
all 10
know 10
because 10
science 10
has 10
vouched 10
for 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
there 10
have 10
been 10
toads 10
shut 10
up 10
in 10
rocks 10
for 10
thousands 10
of 10
years 10

one 10
so 10
small 10
hole 10

you 10
tell 10
me 10
how 10
the 10
indian 10
fakir 10
can 10
make 10
himself 10
to 10
die 10
and 10
have 10
been 10
buried 10
and 10
his 10
grave 10
sealed 10
and 10
corn 10
sowed 10
on 10
it 10
and 10
the 10
corn 10
reaped 10
and 10
be 10
cut 10
and 10
sown 10
and 10
reaped 10
and 10
cut 10
again 10
and 10
then 10
men 10
come 10
and 10
take 10
away 10
the 10
unbroken 10
seal 10
and 10
that 10
there 10
lie 10
the 10
indian 10
fakir 10
not 10
dead 10
but 10
that 10
rise 10
up 10
and 10
walk 10
amongst 10
them 10
as 10
before 10
here 10
i 10
interrupted 10
him 10
i 10
was 10
getting 10
bewildered 10
he 10
so 10
crowded 10
on 10
my 10
mind 10
his 10
list 10
of 10
natures 10
eccentricities 10
and 10
possible 10
impossibilities 10
that 10
my 10
imagination 10
was 10
getting 10
fired 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
dim 10
idea 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
teaching 10
me 10
some 10
lesson 10
as 10
long 10
ago 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
his 10
study 10
at 10
amsterdam 10
but 10
he 10
used 10
them 10
to 10
tell 10
me 10
the 10
thing 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
have 10
the 10
object 10
of 10
thought 10
in 10
mind 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
but 10
now 10
i 10
was 10
without 10
his 10
help 10
yet 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
follow 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
professor 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
your 10
pet 10
student 10
again 10
tell 10
me 10
the 10
thesis 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
apply 10
your 10
knowledge 10
as 10
you 10
go 10
on 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
am 10
going 10
in 10
my 10
mind 10
from 10
point 10
to 10
point 10
as 10
a 10
madman 10
and 10
not 10
a 10
sane 10
one 10
follows 10
an 10
idea 10
i 10
feel 10
like 10
a 10
novice 10
lumbering 10
through 10
a 10
bog 10
in 10
a 10
midst 10
jumping 10
from 10
one 10
tussock 10
to 10
another 10
in 10
the 10
mere 10
blind 10
effort 10
to 10
move 10
on 10
without 10
knowing 10
where 10
i 10
am 10
going 10
that 10
is 10
a 10
good 10
image 10
he 10
said 10
well 10
i 10
shall 10
tell 10
you 10
my 10
thesis 10
is 10
this 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
believe 10
to 10
believe 10
what 10
to 10
believe 10
in 10
things 10
that 10
you 10
cannot 10
let 10
me 10
illustrate 10
i 10
heard 10
once 10
of 10
an 10
american 10
who 10
so 10
defined 10
faith 10
that 10
faculty 10
which 10
enables 10
us 10
to 10
believe 10
things 10
which 10
we 10
know 10
to 10
be 10
untrue 10
for 10
one 10
i 10
follow 10
that 10
man 10
he 10
meant 10
that 10
we 10
shall 10
have 10
an 10
open 10
mind 10
and 10
not 10
let 10
a 10
little 10
bit 10
of 10
truth 10
check 10
the 10
rush 10
of 10
the 10
big 10
truth 10
like 10
a 10
small 10
rock 10
does 10
a 10
railway 10
truck 10
we 10
get 10
the 10
small 10
truth 10
first 10
good 10
we 10
keep 10
him 10
and 10
we 10
value 10
him 10
but 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
let 10
him 10
think 10
himself 10
all 10
the 10
truth 10
in 10
the 10
universe 10
then 10
you 10
want 10
me 10
not 10
to 10
let 10
some 10
previous 10
conviction 10
inure 10
the 10
receptivity 10
of 10
my 10
mind 10
with 10
regard 10
to 10
some 10
strange 10
matter 10
do 10
i 10
read 10
your 10
lesson 10

are 10
my 10
favorite 10
pupil 10

is 10
worth 10
to 10
teach 10
you 10
now 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
willing 10
to 10
understand 10
you 10
have 10
taken 10
the 10
first 10
step 10
to 10
understand 10
you 10
think 10
then 10
that 10
those 10
so 10
small 10
holes 10
in 10
the 10
childrens 10
throats 10
were 10
made 10

the 10
holes 10
in 10

himself 10
with 10
a 10
despairing 10
gesture 10
into 10
a 10
chair 10
and 10
placed 10
his 10
elbows 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
covering 10
his 10
face 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
they 10

raised 10
his 10
head 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
somehow 10
the 10
tenderness 10
of 10
his 10
face 10
calmed 10
me 10
at 10
once 10

he 10
went 10
on 10
my 10
friend 10

was 10
because 10
i 10
wished 10

do 10
not 10
expect 10
you 10
to 10
believe 10
it 10
is 10
so 10
hard 10
to 10
accept 10
at 10
once 10
any 10
abstract 10
truth 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
doubt 10
such 10
to 10
be 10
possible 10
when 10
we 10
have 10
always 10
believed 10
the 10
no 10
of 10
it 10
it 10
is 10
more 10
hard 10
still 10
to 10
accept 10
so 10
sad 10
a 10
concrete 10
truth 10
and 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
one 10
as 10

come 10
with 10
me 10
this 10
staggered 10
me 10
a 10
man 10
does 10
not 10
like 10
to 10
prove 10
such 10
a 10
truth 10
byron 10
excepted 10
from 10
the 10
catagory 10
jealousy 10
and 10
prove 10
the 10
very 10
truth 10
he 10
most 10
abhorred 10
he 10
saw 10
my 10
hesitation 10
and 10
spoke 10
the 10
logic 10
is 10
simple 10
no 10
madmans 10
logic 10
this 10
time 10
jumping 10
from 10
tussock 10
to 10
tussock 10
in 10
a 10
misty 10
bog 10
if 10
it 10
not 10
be 10
true 10
then 10
proof 10
will 10
be 10
relief 10
at 10
worst 10
it 10
will 10
not 10
harm 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
true 10
ah 10
there 10
is 10
the 10
dread 10
yet 10
every 10
dread 10
should 10
help 10
my 10
cause 10
for 10
in 10
it 10
is 10
some 10
need 10
of 10
belief 10
come 10
i 10
tell 10
you 10
what 10
i 10
propose 10
first 10
that 10
we 10
go 10
off 10
now 10
and 10
see 10
that 10
child 10
in 10
the 10
hospital 10
dr 10
vincent 10
of 10
the 10
north 10
hospital 10
where 10
the 10
papers 10
say 10
the 10
child 10
is 10
is 10
a 10
friend 10
of 10
mine 10
and 10
i 10
think 10
of 10
yours 10
since 10
you 10
were 10
in 10
class 10
at 10
amsterdam 10
he 10
will 10
let 10
two 10
scientists 10
see 10
his 10
case 10
if 10
he 10
will 10
not 10
let 10
two 10
friends 10
we 10
shall 10
tell 10
him 10
nothing 10
but 10
only 10
that 10
we 10
wish 10
to 10
learn 10
and 10
then 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
a 10
key 10
from 10
his 10
pocket 10
and 10
held 10
it 10
up 10
and 10
then 10
we 10
spend 10
the 10
night 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
in 10
the 10
churchyard 10
where 10
lucy 10
lies 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
key 10
that 10
lock 10
the 10
tomb 10
i 10
had 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
coffin 10
man 10
to 10
give 10
to 10
arthur 10
my 10
heart 10
sank 10
within 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
fearful 10
ordeal 10
before 10
us 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
nothing 10
however 10
so 10
i 10
plucked 10
up 10
what 10
heart 10
i 10
could 10
and 10
said 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
better 10
hasten 10
as 10
the 10
afternoon 10
was 10
passing 10
we 10
found 10
the 10
child 10
awake 10
it 10
had 10
had 10
a 10
sleep 10
and 10
taken 10
some 10
food 10
and 10
altogether 10
was 10
going 10
on 10
well 10
dr 10
vincent 10
took 10
the 10
bandage 10
from 10
its 10
throat 10
and 10
showed 10
us 10
the 10
punctures 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
mistaking 10
the 10
similarity 10
to 10
those 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
on 10
lucys 10
throat 10
they 10
were 10
smaller 10
and 10
the 10
edges 10
looked 10
fresher 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
we 10
asked 10
vincent 10
to 10
what 10
he 10
attributed 10
them 10
and 10
he 10
replied 10
that 10
it 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
a 10
bite 10
of 10
some 10
animal 10
perhaps 10
a 10
rat 10
but 10
for 10
his 10
own 10
part 10
he 10
was 10
inclined 10
to 10
think 10
it 10
was 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
bats 10
which 10
are 10
so 10
numerous 10
on 10
the 10
northern 10
heights 10
of 10
london 10
out 10
of 10
so 10
many 10
harmless 10
ones 10
he 10
said 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
some 10
wild 10
specimen 10
from 10
the 10
south 10
of 10
a 10
more 10
malignant 10
species 10
some 10
sailor 10
may 10
have 10
brought 10
one 10
home 10
and 10
it 10
managed 10
to 10
escape 10
or 10
even 10
from 10
the 10
zoological 10
gardens 10
a 10
young 10
one 10
may 10
have 10
got 10
loose 10
or 10
one 10
be 10
bred 10
there 10
from 10
a 10
vampire 10
these 10
things 10
do 10
occur 10
you 10
know 10
only 10
ten 10
days 10
ago 10
a 10
wolf 10
got 10
out 10
and 10
was 10
i 10
believe 10
traced 10
up 10
in 10
this 10
direction 10
for 10
a 10
week 10
after 10
the 10
children 10
were 10
playing 10
nothing 10
but 10
red 10
riding 10
hood 10
on 10
the 10
heath 10
and 10
in 10
every 10
alley 10
in 10
the 10
place 10
until 10
this 10
bloofer 10
lady 10
scare 10
came 10
along 10
since 10
then 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
quite 10
a 10
gala 10
time 10
with 10
them 10
even 10
this 10
poor 10
little 10
mite 10
when 10
he 10
woke 10
up 10
today 10
asked 10
the 10
nurse 10
if 10
he 10
might 10
go 10
away 10
when 10
she 10
asked 10
him 10
why 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
go 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
play 10
with 10
the 10
bloofer 10
lady 10
i 10
hope 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
that 10
when 10
you 10
are 10
sending 10
the 10
child 10
home 10
you 10
will 10
caution 10
its 10
parents 10
to 10
keep 10
strict 10
watch 10
over 10
it 10
these 10
fancies 10
to 10
stray 10
are 10
most 10
dangerous 10
and 10
if 10
the 10
child 10
were 10
to 10
remain 10
out 10
another 10
night 10
it 10
would 10
probably 10
be 10
fatal 10
but 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
i 10
suppose 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
let 10
it 10
away 10
for 10
some 10
days 10
certainly 10
not 10
not 10
for 10
a 10
week 10
at 10
least 10
longer 10
if 10
the 10
wound 10
is 10
not 10
healed 10
our 10
visit 10
to 10
the 10
hospital 10
took 10
more 10
time 10
than 10
we 10
had 10
reckoned 10
on 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
had 10
dipped 10
before 10
we 10
came 10
out 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
saw 10
how 10
dark 10
it 10
was 10
he 10
said 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
hurry 10
it 10
is 10
more 10
late 10
than 10
i 10
thought 10
come 10
let 10
us 10
seek 10
somewhere 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
eat 10
and 10
then 10
we 10
shall 10
go 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
we 10
dined 10
at 10
jack 10
straws 10
castle 10
along 10
with 10
a 10
little 10
crowd 10
of 10
bicyclists 10
and 10
others 10
who 10
were 10
genially 10
noisy 10
about 10
ten 10
oclock 10
we 10
started 10
from 10
the 10
inn 10
it 10
was 10
then 10
very 10
dark 10
and 10
the 10
scattered 10
lamps 10
made 10
the 10
darkness 10
greater 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
once 10
outside 10
their 10
individual 10
radius 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
evidently 10
noted 10
the 10
road 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
go 10
for 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
unhesitatingly 10
but 10
as 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
quite 10
a 10
mixup 10
as 10
to 10
locality 10
as 10
we 10
went 10
further 10
we 10
met 10
fewer 10
and 10
fewer 10
people 10
till 10
at 10
last 10
we 10
were 10
somewhat 10
surprised 10
when 10
we 10
met 10
even 10
the 10
patrol 10
of 10
horse 10
police 10
going 10
their 10
usual 10
suburban 10
round 10
at 10
last 10
we 10
reached 10
the 10
wall 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
which 10
we 10
climbed 10
over 10
with 10
some 10
little 10
difficulty 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
very 10
dark 10
and 10
the 10
whole 10
place 10
seemed 10
so 10
strange 10
to 10
us 10
we 10
found 10
the 10
westenra 10
tomb 10
the 10
professor 10
took 10
the 10
key 10
opened 10
the 10
creaky 10
door 10
and 10
standing 10
back 10
politely 10
but 10
quite 10
unconsciously 10
motioned 10
me 10
to 10
precede 10
him 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
delicious 10
irony 10
in 10
the 10
offer 10
in 10
the 10
courtliness 10
of 10
giving 10
preference 10
on 10
such 10
a 10
ghastly 10
occasion 10
my 10
companion 10
followed 10
me 10
quickly 10
and 10
cautiously 10
drew 10
the 10
door 10
to 10
after 10
carefully 10
ascertaining 10
that 10
the 10
lock 10
was 10
a 10
falling 10
and 10
not 10
a 10
spring 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
latter 10
case 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
a 10
bad 10
plight 10
then 10
he 10
fumbled 10
in 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
taking 10
out 10
a 10
matchbox 10
and 10
a 10
piece 10
of 10
candle 10
proceeded 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
light 10
the 10
tomb 10
in 10
the 10
daytime 10
and 10
when 10
wreathed 10
with 10
fresh 10
flowers 10
had 10
looked 10
grim 10
and 10
gruesome 10
enough 10
but 10
now 10
some 10
days 10
afterwards 10
when 10
the 10
flowers 10
hung 10
lank 10
and 10
dead 10
their 10
whites 10
turning 10
to 10
rust 10
and 10
their 10
greens 10
to 10
browns 10
when 10
the 10
spider 10
and 10
the 10
beetle 10
had 10
resumed 10
their 10
accustomed 10
dominance 10
when 10
the 10
timediscolored 10
stone 10
and 10
dustencrusted 10
mortar 10
and 10
rusty 10
dank 10
iron 10
and 10
tarnished 10
brass 10
and 10
clouded 10
silverplating 10
gave 10
back 10
the 10
feeble 10
glimmer 10
of 10
a 10
candle 10
the 10
effect 10
was 10
more 10
miserable 10
and 10
sordid 10
than 10
could 10
have 10
been 10
imagined 10
it 10
conveyed 10
irresistibly 10
the 10
idea 10
that 10
life 10
animal 10
life 10
was 10
not 10
the 10
only 10
thing 10
which 10
could 10
pass 10
away 10
van 10
helsing 10
went 10
about 10
his 10
work 10
systematically 10
holding 10
his 10
candle 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
read 10
the 10
coffin 10
plates 10
and 10
so 10
holding 10
it 10
that 10
the 10
sperm 10
dropped 10
in 10
white 10
patches 10
which 10
congealed 10
as 10
they 10
touched 10
the 10
metal 10
he 10
made 10
assurance 10
of 10
lucys 10
coffin 10
another 10
search 10
in 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
he 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
turnscrew 10
what 10
are 10
you 10
going 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
asked 10
to 10
open 10
the 10
coffin 10
you 10
shall 10
yet 10
be 10
convinced 10
straightway 10
he 10
began 10
taking 10
out 10
the 10
screws 10
and 10
finally 10
lifted 10
off 10
the 10
lid 10
showing 10
the 10
casing 10
of 10
lead 10
beneath 10
the 10
sight 10
was 10
almost 10
too 10
much 10
for 10
me 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
as 10
much 10
an 10
affront 10
to 10
the 10
dead 10
as 10
it 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
to 10
have 10
stripped 10
off 10
her 10
clothing 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
whilst 10
living 10
i 10
actually 10
took 10
hold 10
of 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
stop 10
him 10
he 10
only 10
said 10
you 10
shall 10
see 10
and 10
again 10
fumbling 10
in 10
his 10
bag 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
tiny 10
fret 10
saw 10
striking 10
the 10
turnscrew 10
through 10
the 10
lead 10
with 10
a 10
swift 10
downward 10
stab 10
which 10
made 10
me 10
wince 10
he 10
made 10
a 10
small 10
hole 10
which 10
was 10
however 10
big 10
enough 10
to 10
admit 10
the 10
point 10
of 10
the 10
saw 10
i 10
had 10
expected 10
a 10
rush 10
of 10
gas 10
from 10
the 10
weekold 10
corpse 10
we 10
doctors 10
who 10
have 10
had 10
to 10
study 10
our 10
dangers 10
have 10
to 10
become 10
accustomed 10
to 10
such 10
things 10
and 10
i 10
drew 10
back 10
towards 10
the 10
door 10
but 10
the 10
professor 10
never 10
stopped 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
he 10
sawed 10
down 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
feet 10
along 10
one 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
lead 10
coffin 10
and 10
then 10
across 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
other 10
side 10
taking 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
loose 10
flange 10
he 10
bent 10
it 10
back 10
towards 10
the 10
foot 10
of 10
the 10
coffin 10
and 10
holding 10
up 10
the 10
candle 10
into 10
the 10
aperture 10
motioned 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
look 10
i 10
drew 10
near 10
and 10
looked 10
the 10
coffin 10
was 10
empty 10
it 10
was 10
certainly 10
a 10
surprise 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
gave 10
me 10
a 10
considerable 10
shock 10
but 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
unmoved 10
he 10
was 10
now 10
more 10
sure 10
than 10
ever 10
of 10
his 10
ground 10
and 10
so 10
emboldened 10
to 10
proceed 10
in 10
his 10
taskare 10
you 10
satisfied 10
now 10
friend 10
john 10
he 10
asked 10
i 10
felt 10
all 10
the 10
dogged 10
argumentativeness 10
of 10
my 10
nature 10
awake 10
within 10
me 10
as 10
i 10
answered 10
him 10
i 10
am 10
satisfied 10
that 10
lucys 10
body 10
is 10
not 10
in 10
that 10
coffin 10
but 10
that 10
only 10
proves 10
one 10
thing 10
and 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
friend 10
john 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
there 10
that 10
is 10
good 10
logic 10
he 10
said 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
it 10
goes 10
but 10
how 10
do 10
you 10
how 10
can 10
you 10
account 10
for 10
it 10
not 10
being 10
there 10
perhaps 10
a 10
bodysnatcher 10
i 10
suggested 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
undertakers 10
people 10
may 10
have 10
stolen 10
it 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
speaking 10
folly 10
and 10
yet 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
only 10
real 10
cause 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
suggest 10
the 10
professor 10
sighed 10
ah 10
well 10
he 10
said 10
we 10
must 10
have 10
more 10
proof 10
come 10
with 10
me 10
he 10
put 10
on 10
the 10
coffin 10
lid 10
again 10
gathered 10
up 10
all 10
his 10
things 10
and 10
placed 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
bag 10
blew 10
out 10
the 10
light 10
and 10
placed 10
the 10
candle 10
also 10
in 10
the 10
bag 10
we 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
went 10
out 10
behind 10
us 10
he 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
locked 10
it 10
he 10
handed 10
me 10
the 10
key 10
saying 10
will 10
you 10
keep 10
it 10
you 10
had 10
better 10
be 10
assured 10
i 10
laughed 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
a 10
very 10
cheerful 10
laugh 10
i 10
am 10
bound 10
to 10
say 10
as 10
i 10
motioned 10
him 10
to 10
keep 10
it 10
a 10
key 10
is 10
nothing 10
i 10
said 10
thee 10
are 10
many 10
duplicates 10
and 10
anyhow 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
difficult 10
to 10
pick 10
a 10
lock 10
of 10
this 10
kind 10
he 10
said 10
nothing 10
but 10
put 10
the 10
key 10
in 10
his 10
pocket 10
then 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
to 10
watch 10
at 10
one 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
whilst 10
he 10
would 10
watch 10
at 10
the 10
other 10
i 10
took 10
up 10
my 10
place 10
behind 10
a 10
yew 10
tree 10
and 10
i 10
saw 10
his 10
dark 10
figure 10
move 10
until 10
the 10
intervening 10
headstones 10
and 10
trees 10
hid 10
it 10
from 10
my 10
sight 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
lonely 10
vigil 10
just 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
taken 10
my 10
place 10
i 10
heard 10
a 10
distant 10
clock 10
strike 10
twelve 10
and 10
in 10
time 10
came 10
one 10
and 10
two 10
i 10
was 10
chilled 10
and 10
unnerved 10
and 10
angry 10
with 10
the 10
professor 10
for 10
taking 10
me 10
on 10
such 10
an 10
errand 10
and 10
with 10
myself 10
for 10
coming 10
i 10
was 10
too 10
cold 10
and 10
too 10
sleepy 10
to 10
be 10
keenly 10
observant 10
and 10
not 10
sleepy 10
enough 10
to 10
betray 10
my 10
trust 10
so 10
altogether 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
dreary 10
miserable 10
time 10
suddenly 10
as 10
i 10
turned 10
round 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
saw 10
something 10
like 10
a 10
white 10
streak 10
moving 10
between 10
two 10
dark 10
yew 10
trees 10
at 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
farthest 10
from 10
the 10
tomb 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
a 10
dark 10
mass 10
moved 10
from 10
the 10
professors 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
ground 10
and 10
hurriedly 10
went 10
towards 10
it 10
then 10
i 10
too 10
moved 10
but 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
go 10
round 10
headstones 10
and 10
railedoff 10
tombs 10
and 10
i 10
stumbled 10
over 10
graves 10
the 10
sky 10
was 10
overcast 10
and 10
somewhere 10
far 10
off 10
an 10
early 10
cock 10
crew 10
a 10
little 10
ways 10
off 10
beyond 10
a 10
line 10
of 10
scattered 10
juniper 10
trees 10
which 10
marked 10
the 10
pathway 10
to 10
the 10
church 10
a 10
white 10
dim 10
figure 10
flitted 10
in 10
the 10
direction 10
of 10
the 10
tomb 10
the 10
tomb 10
itself 10
was 10
hidden 10
by 10
trees 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
where 10
the 10
figure 10
had 10
disappeared 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
rustle 10
of 10
actual 10
movement 10
where 10
i 10
had 10
first 10
seen 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
and 10
coming 10
over 10
found 10
the 10
professor 10
holding 10
in 10
his 10
arms 10
a 10
tiny 10
child 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
he 10
held 10
it 10
out 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
are 10
you 10
satisfied 10
now 10
no 10
i 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
i 10
felt 10
was 10
aggressive 10
do 10
you 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
child 10
yes 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
child 10
but 10
who 10
brought 10
it 10
here 10
and 10
is 10
it 10
wounded 10
we 10
shall 10
see 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
with 10
one 10
impulse 10
we 10
took 10
our 10
way 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
he 10
carrying 10
the 10
sleeping 10
child 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
got 10
some 10
little 10
distance 10
away 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
a 10
clump 10
of 10
trees 10
and 10
struck 10
a 10
match 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
the 10
childs 10
throat 10
it 10
was 10
without 10
a 10
scratch 10
or 10
scar 10
of 10
any 10
kind 10
was 10
i 10
right 10
i 10
asked 10
triumphantly 10
we 10
were 10
just 10
in 10
time 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
thankfully 10
we 10
had 10
now 10
to 10
decide 10
what 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
do 10
with 10
the 10
child 10
and 10
so 10
consulted 10
about 10
it 10
if 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
take 10
it 10
to 10
a 10
police 10
station 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
to 10
give 10
some 10
account 10
of 10
our 10
movements 10
during 10
the 10
night 10
at 10
least 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
had 10
to 10
make 10
some 10
statement 10
as 10
to 10
how 10
we 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
find 10
the 10
child 10
so 10
finally 10
we 10
decided 10
that 10
we 10
would 10
take 10
it 10
to 10
the 10
heath 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
heard 10
a 10
policeman 10
coming 10
would 10
leave 10
it 10
where 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
fail 10
to 10
find 10
it 10
we 10
would 10
then 10
seek 10
our 10
way 10
home 10
as 10
quickly 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
all 10
fell 10
out 10
well 10
at 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
hampstead 10
heath 10
we 10
heard 10
a 10
policemans 10
heavy 10
tramp 10
and 10
laying 10
the 10
child 10
on 10
the 10
pathway 10
we 10
waited 10
and 10
watched 10
until 10
he 10
saw 10
it 10
as 10
he 10
flashed 10
his 10
lantern 10
to 10
and 10
fro 10
we 10
heard 10
his 10
exclamation 10
of 10
astonishment 10
and 10
then 10
we 10
went 10
away 10
silently 10
by 10
good 10
chance 10
we 10
got 10
a 10
cab 10
near 10
the 10
spainiards 10
and 10
drove 10
to 10
town 10
i 10
cannot 10
sleep 10
so 10
i 10
make 10
this 10
entry 10
but 10
i 10
must 10
try 10
to 10
get 10
a 10
few 10
hours 10
sleep 10
as 10
van 10
helsing 10
is 10
to 10
call 10
for 10
me 10
at 10
noon 10
he 10
insists 10
that 10
i 10
go 10
with 10
him 10
on 10
another 10
expedition 10
septemberit 10
was 10
two 10
oclock 10
before 10
we 10
found 10
a 10
suitable 10
opportunity 10
for 10
our 10
attempt 10
the 10
funeral 10
held 10
at 10
noon 10
was 10
all 10
completed 10
and 10
the 10
last 10
stragglers 10
of 10
the 10
mourners 10
had 10
taken 10
themselves 10
lazily 10
away 10
when 10
looking 10
carefully 10
from 10
behind 10
a 10
clump 10
of 10
alder 10
trees 10
we 10
saw 10
the 10
sexton 10
lock 10
the 10
gate 10
after 10
him 10
we 10
knew 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
safe 10
till 10
morning 10
did 10
we 10
desire 10
it 10
but 10
the 10
professor 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
not 10
want 10
more 10
than 10
an 10
hour 10
at 10
most 10
again 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
horrid 10
sense 10
of 10
the 10
reality 10
of 10
things 10
in 10
which 10
any 10
effort 10
of 10
imagination 10
seemed 10
out 10
of 10
place 10
and 10
i 10
realized 10
distinctly 10
the 10
perils 10
of 10
the 10
law 10
which 10
we 10
were 10
incurring 10
in 10
our 10
unhallowed 10
work 10
besides 10
i 10
felt 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
so 10
useless 10
outrageous 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
open 10
a 10
leaden 10
coffin 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
a 10
woman 10
dead 10
nearly 10
a 10
week 10
were 10
really 10
dead 10
it 10
now 10
seemed 10
the 10
height 10
of 10
folly 10
to 10
open 10
the 10
tomb 10
again 10
when 10
we 10
knew 10
from 10
the 10
evidence 10
of 10
our 10
own 10
eyesight 10
that 10
the 10
coffin 10
was 10
empty 10
i 10
shrugged 10
my 10
shoulders 10
however 10
and 10
rested 10
silent 10
for 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
a 10
way 10
of 10
going 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
road 10
no 10
matter 10
who 10
remonstrated 10
he 10
took 10
the 10
key 10
opened 10
the 10
vault 10
and 10
again 10
courteously 10
motioned 10
me 10
to 10
precede 10
the 10
place 10
was 10
not 10
so 10
gruesome 10
as 10
last 10
night 10
but 10
oh 10
how 10
unutterably 10
mean 10
looking 10
when 10
the 10
sunshine 10
streamed 10
in 10
van 10
helsing 10
walked 10
over 10
to 10
lucys 10
coffin 10
and 10
i 10
followed 10
he 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
again 10
forced 10
back 10
the 10
leaden 10
flange 10
and 10
a 10
shock 10
of 10
surprise 10
and 10
dismay 10
shot 10
through 10
me 10
there 10
lay 10
lucy 10
seemingly 10
just 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
seen 10
her 10
the 10
night 10
before 10
her 10
funeral 10
she 10
was 10
if 10
possible 10
more 10
radiantly 10
beautiful 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
believe 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
dead 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
red 10
nay 10
redder 10
than 10
before 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
cheeks 10
was 10
a 10
delicate 10
bloom 10
is 10
this 10
a 10
juggle 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
are 10
you 10
convinced 10
now 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
in 10
response 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
put 10
over 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
made 10
me 10
shudder 10
pulled 10
back 10
the 10
dead 10
lips 10
and 10
showed 10
the 10
white 10
teeth 10
see 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
they 10
are 10
even 10
sharper 10
than 10
before 10
with 10
this 10
and 10
this 10
and 10
he 10
touched 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
canine 10
teeth 10
and 10
that 10
below 10
it 10
the 10
little 10
children 10
can 10
be 10
bitten 10
are 10
you 10
of 10
belief 10
now 10
friend 10
john 10
once 10
more 10
argumentative 10
hostility 10
woke 10
within 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
accept 10
such 10
an 10
overwhelming 10
idea 10
as 10
he 10
suggested 10
so 10
with 10
an 10
attempt 10
to 10
argue 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
was 10
even 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
ashamed 10
i 10
said 10
she 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
placed 10
here 10
since 10
last 10
night 10
indeed 10
that 10
is 10
so 10
and 10
by 10
whom 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
someone 10
has 10
done 10
it 10
and 10
yet 10
she 10
has 10
been 10
dead 10
one 10
week 10
most 10
peoples 10
in 10
that 10
time 10
would 10
not 10
look 10
so 10
i 10
had 10
no 10
answer 10
for 10
this 10
so 10
was 10
silent 10
van 10
helsing 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
notice 10
my 10
silence 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
he 10
showed 10
neither 10
chagrin 10
nor 10
triumph 10
he 10
was 10
looking 10
intently 10
at 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
the 10
dead 10
woman 10
raising 10
the 10
eyelids 10
and 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
eyes 10
and 10
once 10
more 10
opening 10
the 10
lips 10
and 10
examining 10
the 10
teeth 10
then 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
here 10
there 10
is 10
one 10
thing 10
which 10
is 10
different 10
from 10
all 10
recorded 10
here 10
is 10
some 10
dual 10
life 10
that 10
is 10
not 10
as 10
the 10
common 10
she 10
was 10
bitten 10
by 10
the 10
vampire 10
when 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
trance 10
sleepwalking 10
oh 10
you 10
start 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
that 10
friend 10
john 10
but 10
you 10
shall 10
know 10
it 10
later 10
and 10
in 10
trance 10
could 10
he 10
best 10
come 10
to 10
take 10
more 10
blood 10
in 10
trance 10
she 10
dies 10
and 10
in 10
trance 10
she 10
is 10
undead 10
too 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
that 10
she 10
differ 10
from 10
all 10
other 10
usually 10
when 10
the 10
undead 10
sleep 10
at 10
home 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
made 10
a 10
comprehensive 10
sweep 10
of 10
his 10
arm 10
to 10
designate 10
what 10
to 10
a 10
vampire 10
was 10
home 10
their 10
face 10
show 10
what 10
they 10
are 10
but 10
this 10
so 10
sweet 10
that 10
was 10
when 10
she 10
not 10
undead 10
she 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
nothings 10
of 10
the 10
common 10
dead 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
malign 10
there 10
see 10
and 10
so 10
it 10
make 10
hard 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
kill 10
her 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
this 10
turned 10
my 10
blood 10
cold 10
and 10
it 10
began 10
to 10
dawn 10
upon 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
accepting 10
van 10
helsings 10
theories 10
but 10
if 10
she 10
were 10
really 10
dead 10
what 10
was 10
there 10
of 10
terror 10
in 10
the 10
idea 10
of 10
killing 10
her 10
he 10
looked 10
up 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
evidently 10
saw 10
the 10
change 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
for 10
he 10
said 10
almost 10
joyously 10
ah 10
you 10
believe 10
now 10
i 10
answered 10
do 10
not 10
press 10
me 10
too 10
hard 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
am 10
willing 10
to 10
accept 10
how 10
will 10
you 10
do 10
this 10
bloody 10
work 10
i 10
shall 10
cut 10
off 10
her 10
head 10
and 10
fill 10
her 10
mouth 10
with 10
garlic 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
drive 10
a 10
stake 10
through 10
her 10
body 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
shudder 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
so 10
mutilating 10
the 10
body 10
of 10
the 10
woman 10
whom 10
i 10
had 10
loved 10
and 10
yet 10
the 10
feeling 10
was 10
not 10
so 10
strong 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
expected 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
fact 10
beginning 10
to 10
shudder 10
at 10
the 10
presence 10
of 10
this 10
being 10
this 10
undead 10
as 10
van 10
helsing 10
called 10
it 10
and 10
to 10
loathe 10
it 10
is 10
it 10
possible 10
that 10
love 10
is 10
all 10
subjective 10
or 10
all 10
objective 10
i 10
waited 10
a 10
considerable 10
time 10
for 10
van 10
helsing 10
to 10
begin 10
but 10
he 10
stood 10
as 10
if 10
wrapped 10
in 10
thought 10
presently 10
he 10
closed 10
the 10
catch 10
of 10
his 10
bag 10
with 10
a 10
snap 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
thinking 10
and 10
have 10
made 10
up 10
my 10
mind 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
is 10
best 10
if 10
i 10
did 10
simply 10
follow 10
my 10
inclining 10
i 10
would 10
do 10
now 10
at 10
this 10
moment 10
what 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
but 10
there 10
are 10
other 10
things 10
to 10
follow 10
and 10
things 10
that 10
are 10
thousand 10
times 10
more 10
difficult 10
in 10
that 10
them 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
this 10
is 10
simple 10
she 10
have 10
yet 10
no 10
life 10
taken 10
though 10
that 10
is 10
of 10
time 10
and 10
to 10
act 10
now 10
would 10
be 10
to 10
take 10
danger 10
from 10
her 10
forever 10
but 10
then 10
we 10
may 10
have 10
to 10
want 10
arthur 10
and 10
how 10
shall 10
we 10
tell 10
him 10
of 10
this 10
if 10
you 10
who 10
saw 10
the 10
wounds 10
on 10
lucys 10
throat 10
and 10
saw 10
the 10
wounds 10
so 10
similar 10
on 10
the 10
childs 10
at 10
the 10
hospital 10
if 10
you 10
who 10
saw 10
the 10
coffin 10
empty 10
last 10
night 10
and 10
full 10
today 10
with 10
a 10
woman 10
who 10
have 10
not 10
change 10
only 10
to 10
be 10
more 10
rose 10
and 10
more 10
beautiful 10
in 10
a 10
whole 10
week 10
after 10
she 10
die 10
if 10
you 10
know 10
of 10
this 10
and 10
know 10
of 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
last 10
night 10
that 10
brought 10
the 10
child 10
to 10
the 10
churchyard 10
and 10
yet 10
of 10
your 10
own 10
senses 10
you 10
did 10
not 10
believe 10
how 10
then 10
can 10
i 10
expect 10
arthur 10
who 10
know 10
none 10
of 10
those 10
things 10
to 10
believe 10
he 10
doubted 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
took 10
him 10
from 10
her 10
kiss 10
when 10
she 10
was 10
dying 10
i 10
know 10
he 10
has 10
forgiven 10
me 10
because 10
in 10
some 10
mistaken 10
idea 10
i 10
have 10
done 10
things 10
that 10
prevent 10
him 10
say 10
goodbye 10
as 10
he 10
ought 10
and 10
he 10
may 10
think 10
that 10
in 10
some 10
more 10
mistaken 10
idea 10
this 10
woman 10
was 10
buried 10
alive 10
and 10
that 10
in 10
most 10
mistake 10
of 10
all 10
we 10
have 10
killed 10
her 10
he 10
will 10
then 10
argue 10
back 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
we 10
mistaken 10
ones 10
that 10
have 10
killed 10
her 10
by 10
our 10
ideas 10
and 10
so 10
he 10
will 10
be 10
much 10
unhappy 10
always 10
yet 10
he 10
never 10
can 10
be 10
sure 10
and 10
that 10
is 10
the 10
worst 10
of 10
all 10
and 10
he 10
will 10
sometimes 10
think 10
that 10
she 10
he 10
loved 10
was 10
buried 10
alive 10
and 10
that 10
will 10
paint 10
his 10
dreams 10
with 10
horrors 10
of 10
what 10
she 10
must 10
have 10
suffered 10
and 10
again 10
he 10
will 10
think 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
be 10
right 10
and 10
that 10
his 10
so 10
beloved 10
was 10
after 10
all 10
an 10
undead 10
no 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
once 10
and 10
since 10
then 10
i 10
learn 10
much 10
now 10
since 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
true 10
a 10
hundred 10
thousand 10
times 10
more 10
do 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
pass 10
through 10
the 10
bitter 10
waters 10
to 10
reach 10
the 10
sweet 10
he 10
poor 10
fellow 10
must 10
have 10
one 10
hour 10
that 10
will 10
make 10
the 10
very 10
face 10
of 10
heaven 10
grow 10
black 10
to 10
him 10
then 10
we 10
can 10
act 10
for 10
good 10
all 10
round 10
and 10
send 10
him 10
peace 10
my 10
mind 10
is 10
made 10
up 10
let 10
us 10
go 10

return 10
home 10

spend 10
the 10
night 10
here 10
in 10
this 10
churchyard 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
way 10
tomorrow 10
night 10

will 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
the 10
berkeley 10

shall 10
send 10
for 10
arthur 10
to 10
come 10
too 10
and 10
also 10
that 10
so 10
fine 10
young 10
man 10
of 10
america 10
that 10
gave 10
his 10
blood 10
later 10
we 10
shall 10
all 10
have 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
come 10
with 10
you 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
piccadilly 10
and 10
there 10
dine 10
for 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
back 10
here 10
before 10
the 10
sun 10
set 10
so 10
we 10
locked 10
the 10
tomb 10
and 10
came 10
away 10
and 10
got 10
over 10
the 10
wall 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
which 10
was 10
not 10
much 10
of 10
a 10
task 10
and 10
drove 10
back 10
to 10
piccadilly 10
note 10
left 10
by 10
van 10
helsing 10
in 10
his 10
portmanteau 10
berkeley 10
hotel 10
directed 10
to 10
john 10
seward 10
m 10
d 10
not 10
delivered 10
september 10
friend 10
john 10
i 10
write 10
this 10
in 10
case 10
anything 10
should 10
happen 10
i 10
go 10
alone 10
to 10
watch 10
in 10
that 10
churchyard 10
it 10
pleases 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
undead 10
miss 10
lucy 10
shall 10
not 10
leave 10
tonight 10
that 10
so 10
on 10
the 10
morrow 10
night 10
she 10
may 10
be 10
more 10
eager 10
therefore 10
i 10
shall 10
fix 10
some 10
things 10
she 10
like 10
not 10
garlic 10
and 10
a 10
crucifix 10
and 10
so 10
seal 10
up 10
the 10
door 10
of 10
the 10
tomb 10
she 10
is 10
young 10
as 10
undead 10
and 10
will 10
heed 10
moreover 10
these 10
are 10
only 10
to 10
prevent 10
her 10
coming 10
out 10
they 10
may 10
not 10
prevail 10
on 10
her 10
wanting 10
to 10
get 10
in 10
for 10
then 10
the 10
undead 10
is 10
desperate 10
and 10
must 10
find 10
the 10
line 10
of 10
least 10
resistance 10
whatsoever 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
at 10
hand 10
all 10
the 10
night 10
from 10
sunset 10
till 10
after 10
sunrise 10
and 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
aught 10
that 10
may 10

that 10
other 10
to 10
whom 10

there 10
that 10
she 10
is 10
undead 10

not 10
the 10
power 10
to 10
seek 10
her 10
tomb 10
and 10
find 10
shelter 10
he 10
is 10
cunning 10
as 10
i 10
know 10
from 10
mr 10
jonathan 10
and 10
from 10
the 10
way 10
that 10
all 10
along 10
he 10
have 10
fooled 10
us 10
when 10
he 10
played 10
with 10
us 10
for 10
miss 10
lucys 10
life 10
and 10
we 10
lost 10
and 10
in 10
many 10
ways 10
the 10
undead 10
are 10
strong 10
he 10
have 10
always 10
the 10
strength 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
of 10
twenty 10
men 10
even 10
we 10
four 10
who 10
gave 10
our 10
strength 10
to 10
miss 10
lucy 10
it 10
also 10
is 10
all 10
to 10
him 10
besides 10
he 10
can 10
summon 10
his 10
wolf 10
and 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
what 10
so 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
he 10
came 10
thither 10
on 10
this 10
night 10
he 10
shall 10
find 10
me 10
but 10
none 10
other 10
shall 10
until 10
it 10
be 10
too 10
late 10
but 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
he 10
will 10
not 10
attempt 10
the 10
place 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
reason 10
why 10
he 10
should 10
his 10
hunting 10
ground 10
is 10
more 10
full 10
of 10
game 10
than 10
the 10
churchyard 10
where 10
the 10
undead 10
woman 10
sleeps 10
and 10
the 10
one 10
old 10
man 10
watch 10
therefore 10
i 10
write 10
this 10
in 10
case 10
take 10
the 10
papers 10
that 10
are 10
with 10
this 10
the 10
diaries 10
of 10
harker 10
and 10
the 10
rest 10
and 10
read 10
them 10
and 10
then 10
find 10
this 10
great 10
undead 10
and 10
cut 10
off 10
his 10
head 10
and 10
burn 10
his 10
heart 10
or 10
drive 10
a 10
stake 10
through 10
it 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
world 10
may 10
rest 10
from 10
him 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
so 10
farewell 10

diary 10
septemberit 10
is 10
wonderful 10
what 10
a 10
good 10
nights 10
sleep 10
will 10
do 10
for 10
one 10
yesterday 10
i 10
was 10
almost 10
willing 10
to 10
accept 10
van 10
helsings 10
monstrous 10
ideas 10
but 10
now 10
they 10
seem 10
to 10
start 10
out 10
lurid 10
before 10
me 10
as 10
outrages 10
on 10
common 10
sense 10
i 10
have 10
no 10
doubt 10
that 10
he 10
believes 10
it 10
all 10
i 10
wonder 10
if 10
his 10
mind 10
can 10
have 10
become 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
unhinged 10
surely 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
some 10
rational 10
explanation 10
of 10
all 10
these 10
mysterious 10
things 10
is 10
it 10
possible 10
that 10
the 10
professor 10
can 10
have 10
done 10
it 10
himself 10
he 10
is 10
so 10
abnormally 10
clever 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
went 10
off 10
his 10
head 10
he 10
would 10
carry 10
out 10
his 10
intent 10
with 10
regard 10
to 10
some 10
fixed 10
idea 10
in 10
a 10
wonderful 10
way 10
i 10
am 10
loathe 10
to 10
think 10
it 10
and 10
indeed 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
almost 10
as 10
great 10
a 10
marvel 10
as 10
the 10
other 10
to 10
find 10
that 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
mad 10
but 10
anyhow 10
i 10
shall 10
watch 10
him 10
carefully 10
i 10
may 10
get 10
some 10
light 10
on 10
the 10
mystery 10
septemberlast 10
night 10
at 10
a 10
little 10
before 10
ten 10
oclock 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
came 10
into 10
van 10
helsings 10
room 10
he 10
told 10
us 10
all 10
what 10
he 10
wanted 10
us 10
to 10
do 10
but 10
especially 10
addressing 10
himself 10
to 10
arthur 10
as 10
if 10
all 10
our 10
wills 10
were 10
centered 10
in 10
his 10
he 10
began 10
by 10
saying 10
that 10
he 10
hoped 10
we 10
would 10
all 10
come 10
with 10
him 10
too 10
for 10
he 10
said 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
grave 10
duty 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
there 10
you 10
were 10
doubtless 10
surprised 10
at 10
my 10
letter 10
this 10
query 10
was 10
directly 10
addressed 10
to 10
lord 10
godalming 10
i 10
was 10
it 10
rather 10
upset 10
me 10
for 10
a 10
bit 10
there 10
has 10
been 10
so 10
much 10
trouble 10
around 10
my 10
house 10
of 10
late 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
without 10
any 10
more 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
curious 10
too 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
you 10
mean 10
quincey 10
and 10
i 10
talked 10
it 10
over 10
but 10
the 10
more 10
we 10
talked 10
the 10
more 10
puzzled 10
we 10
got 10
till 10
now 10
i 10
can 10
say 10
for 10
myself 10
that 10
im 10
about 10
up 10
a 10
tree 10
as 10
to 10
any 10
meaning 10
about 10
anything 10
me 10
too 10
said 10
quincey 10
morris 10
laconically 10
oh 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
then 10
you 10
are 10
nearer 10
the 10
beginning 10
both 10
of 10
you 10
than 10
friend 10
john 10
here 10
who 10
has 10
to 10
go 10
a 10
long 10
way 10
back 10
before 10
he 10
can 10
even 10
get 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
to 10
begin 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
he 10
recognized 10
my 10
return 10
to 10
my 10
old 10
doubting 10
frame 10
of 10
mind 10
without 10
my 10
saying 10
a 10
word 10
then 10
turning 10
to 10
the 10
other 10
two 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
intense 10
gravity 10
i 10
want 10
your 10
permission 10
to 10
do 10
what 10
i 10
think 10
good 10
this 10
night 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
know 10
much 10
to 10
ask 10
and 10
when 10
you 10
know 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
propose 10
to 10
do 10
you 10
will 10
know 10
and 10
only 10
then 10
how 10
much 10
therefore 10
may 10
i 10
ask 10
that 10
you 10
promise 10
me 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
so 10
that 10
afterwards 10
though 10
you 10
may 10
be 10
angry 10
with 10
me 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
disguise 10
from 10
myself 10
the 10
possibility 10
that 10
such 10
may 10
be 10
you 10
shall 10
not 10
blame 10
yourselves 10
for 10
anything 10
thats 10
frank 10
anyhow 10
broke 10
in 10
quincey 10
ill 10
answer 10
for 10
the 10
professor 10
i 10
dont 10
quite 10
see 10
his 10
drift 10
but 10
i 10
swear 10
hes 10
honest 10
and 10
thats 10
good 10
enough 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
thank 10
you 10
sir 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
proudly 10
i 10
have 10
done 10
myself 10
the 10
honor 10
of 10
counting 10
you 10
one 10
trusting 10
friend 10
and 10
such 10
endorsement 10
is 10
dear 10
to 10
me 10
he 10
held 10
out 10
a 10
hand 10
which 10
quincey 10
took 10
then 10
arthur 10
spoke 10
out 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
dont 10
quite 10
like 10
to 10
buy 10
a 10
pig 10
in 10
a 10
poke 10
as 10
they 10
say 10
in 10
scotland 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
anything 10
in 10
which 10
my 10
honour 10
as 10
a 10
gentleman 10
or 10
my 10
faith 10
as 10
a 10
christian 10
is 10
concerned 10
i 10
cannot 10
make 10
such 10
a 10
promise 10
if 10
you 10
can 10
assure 10
me 10
that 10
what 10
you 10
intend 10
does 10
not 10
violate 10
either 10
of 10
these 10
two 10
then 10
i 10
give 10
my 10
consent 10
at 10
once 10
though 10
for 10
the 10
life 10
of 10
me 10
i 10
cannot 10
understand 10
what 10
you 10
are 10
driving 10
at 10
i 10
accept 10
your 10
limitation 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
all 10
i 10
ask 10
of 10
you 10
is 10
that 10
if 10
you 10
feel 10
it 10
necessary 10
to 10
condemn 10
any 10
act 10
of 10
mine 10
you 10
will 10
first 10
consider 10
it 10
well 10
and 10
be 10
satisfied 10
that 10
it 10
does 10
not 10
violate 10
your 10
reservations 10
agreed 10
said 10
arthur 10
that 10
is 10
only 10
fair 10
and 10
now 10
that 10
the 10
pourparlers 10
are 10
over 10
may 10
i 10
ask 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
we 10
are 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
come 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
to 10
come 10
in 10
secret 10
to 10
the 10
churchyard 10
at 10
kingstead 10
arthurs 10
face 10
fell 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
an 10
amazed 10
sort 10
of 10
way 10
where 10
poor 10
lucy 10
is 10
buried 10
the 10
professor 10
bowed 10
arthur 10
went 10
on 10
and 10
when 10
there 10
to 10
enter 10
the 10
tomb 10
arthur 10
stood 10
up 10
professor 10
are 10
you 10
in 10
earnest 10
or 10
is 10
it 10
some 10
monstrous 10
joke 10
pardon 10
me 10
i 10
see 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
in 10
earnest 10
he 10
sat 10
down 10
again 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
sat 10
firmly 10
and 10
proudly 10
as 10
one 10
who 10
is 10
on 10
his 10
dignity 10
there 10
was 10
silence 10
until 10
he 10
asked 10
again 10
and 10
when 10
in 10
the 10
tomb 10
to 10
open 10
the 10
coffin 10
this 10
is 10
too 10
much 10
he 10
said 10
angrily 10
rising 10
again 10
i 10
am 10
willing 10
to 10
be 10
patient 10
in 10
all 10
things 10
that 10
are 10
reasonable 10
but 10
in 10
this 10
this 10
desecration 10
of 10
the 10
grave 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
he 10
fairly 10
choked 10
with 10
indignation 10
the 10
professor 10
looked 10
pityingly 10
at 10
himif 10
i 10
could 10
spare 10
you 10
one 10
pang 10
my 10
poor 10
friend 10
he 10
said 10
god 10
knows 10
i 10
would 10
but 10
this 10
night 10
our 10
feet 10
must 10
tread 10
in 10
thorny 10
paths 10
or 10
later 10
and 10
for 10
ever 10
the 10
feet 10
you 10
love 10
must 10
walk 10
in 10
paths 10
of 10
flame 10
arthur 10
looked 10
up 10
with 10
set 10
white 10
face 10
and 10
said 10
take 10
care 10
sir 10
take 10
care 10
would 10
it 10
not 10
be 10
well 10
to 10
hear 10
what 10
i 10
have 10
to 10
say 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
then 10
you 10
will 10
at 10
least 10
know 10
the 10
limit 10
of 10
my 10
purpose 10
shall 10
i 10
go 10
on 10
thats 10
fair 10
enough 10
broke 10
in 10
morris 10
after 10
a 10
pause 10
van 10
helsing 10

his 10
voice 10
broke 10
a 10
little 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
a 10
voice 10
full 10
of 10
pity 10
but 10
i 10

anger 10
with 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
long 10
life 10
of 10
acts 10
which 10
were 10
often 10
not 10
pleasant 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
which 10
sometimes 10
did 10
wring 10
my 10
heart 10
i 10
have 10
never 10
had 10
so 10
heavy 10
a 10
task 10
as 10

me 10
that 10

for 10
you 10

a 10
man 10
can 10
to 10
save 10
you 10
from 10
sorrow 10

for 10
why 10

i 10
give 10
myself 10
so 10
much 10
labor 10
and 10
so 10
much 10
of 10
sorrow 10
i 10
have 10
come 10

for 10
her 10
i 10
am 10
ashamed 10
to 10
say 10
so 10
much 10
but 10
i 10
say 10
it 10
in 10
kindness 10
i 10
gave 10
what 10
you 10
gave 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
my 10
veins 10
i 10
gave 10
it 10
i 10
who 10

not 10
like 10
you 10
her 10
lover 10
but 10
only 10
her 10
physician 10
and 10
her 10
friend 10
i 10
gave 10
her 10
my 10
nights 10
and 10
days 10
before 10
death 10
after 10
death 10
and 10
if 10
my 10
death 10

do 10
her 10
good 10
even 10
now 10
when 10
she 10
is 10
the 10
dead 10
undead 10
she 10
shall 10
have 10
it 10
freely 10
he 10
said 10
this 10
with 10
a 10
very 10
grave 10
sweet 10
pride 10
and 10
arthur 10
was 10
much 10
affected 10
by 10
it 10
he 10
took 10
the 10
old 10
mans 10
hand 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
broken 10
voice 10
oh 10
it 10
is 10
hard 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
and 10
i 10
cannot 10
understand 10
but 10
at 10
least 10
i 10
shall 10
go 10

it 10
was 10
just 10
a 10
quarter 10
before 10
twelve 10
oclock 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
into 10
the 10
churchyard 10
over 10
the 10
low 10
wall 10
the 10
night 10
was 10
dark 10
with 10
occasional 10
gleams 10
of 10
moonlight 10
between 10
the 10
dents 10
of 10
the 10
heavy 10
clouds 10
that 10
scudded 10
across 10
the 10
sky 10
we 10
all 10
kept 10
somehow 10
close 10
together 10
with 10
van 10
helsing 10
slightly 10
in 10
front 10
as 10
he 10
led 10
the 10
way 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
come 10
close 10
to 10
the 10
tomb 10
i 10
looked 10
well 10
at 10
arthur 10
for 10
i 10
feared 10
the 10
proximity 10
to 10
a 10
place 10
laden 10
with 10
so 10
sorrowful 10
a 10
memory 10
would 10
upset 10
him 10
but 10
he 10
bore 10
himself 10
well 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
that 10
the 10
very 10
mystery 10
of 10
the 10
proceeding 10
was 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
a 10
counteractant 10
to 10
his 10
grief 10
the 10
professor 10
unlocked 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
seeing 10
a 10
natural 10
hesitation 10
amongst 10
us 10
for 10
various 10
reasons 10
solved 10
the 10
difficulty 10
by 10
entering 10
first 10
himself 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
us 10
followed 10
and 10
he 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
he 10
then 10
lit 10
a 10
dark 10
lantern 10
and 10
pointed 10
to 10
a 10
coffin 10
arthur 10
stepped 10
forward 10
hesitatingly 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
you 10
were 10
with 10
me 10
here 10
yesterday 10
was 10
the 10
body 10
of 10
miss 10
lucy 10
in 10
that 10
coffin 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
professor 10
turned 10
to 10
the 10
rest 10
saying 10
you 10
hear 10
and 10
yet 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
one 10
who 10
does 10
not 10
believe 10
with 10
me 10
he 10
took 10
his 10
screwdriver 10
and 10
again 10
took 10
off 10
the 10
lid 10
of 10
the 10
coffin 10
arthur 10
looked 10
on 10
very 10
pale 10
but 10
silent 10
when 10
the 10
lid 10
was 10
removed 10
he 10
stepped 10
forward 10
he 10
evidently 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
leaden 10
coffin 10
or 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
had 10
not 10
thought 10
of 10
it 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
the 10
rent 10
in 10
the 10
lead 10
the 10
blood 10
rushed 10
to 10
his 10
face 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
but 10
as 10
quickly 10
fell 10
away 10
again 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
remained 10
of 10
a 10
ghastly 10
whiteness 10
he 10
was 10
still 10
silent 10
van 10
helsing 10
forced 10
back 10
the 10
leaden 10
flange 10
and 10
we 10
all 10
looked 10
in 10
and 10
recoiled 10
the 10
coffin 10
was 10
empty 10
for 10
several 10
minutes 10
no 10
one 10
spoke 10
a 10
word 10
the 10
silence 10
was 10
broken 10
by 10
quincey 10
morris 10
professor 10
i 10
answered 10
for 10
you 10
your 10
word 10
is 10
all 10
i 10
want 10
i 10
wouldnt 10
ask 10
such 10
a 10
thing 10
ordinarily 10
i 10
wouldnt 10
so 10
dishonor 10
you 10
as 10
to 10
imply 10
a 10
doubt 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
mystery 10
that 10
goes 10
beyond 10
any 10
honor 10
or 10
dishonor 10
is 10
this 10
your 10
doing 10
i 10
swear 10
to 10
you 10
by 10
all 10
that 10
i 10
hold 10
sacred 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
removed 10
or 10
touched 10
her 10

two 10
nights 10
ago 10

friend 10
seward 10
and 10
i 10
came 10
here 10
with 10
good 10
purpose 10
believe 10
me 10
i 10
opened 10
that 10
coffin 10
which 10
was 10
then 10
sealed 10
up 10
and 10
we 10
found 10
it 10
as 10
now 10
empty 10
we 10
then 10
waited 10
and 10
saw 10
something 10
white 10
come 10
through 10
the 10
trees 10
the 10
next 10
day 10
we 10
came 10
here 10
in 10
daytime 10
and 10
she 10
lay 10
there 10
did 10
she 10
not 10
friend 10
john 10
yes 10

night 10

time 10

amongst 10
the 10
graves 10

till 10
the 10
sun 10
rose 10
but 10
i 10
saw 10
nothing 10
it 10
was 10
most 10
probable 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
because 10
i 10
had 10
laid 10
over 10
the 10
clamps 10
of 10
those 10
doors 10
garlic 10
which 10
the 10
undead 10
cannot 10
bear 10
and 10
other 10
things 10
which 10
they 10
shun 10
last 10
night 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
exodus 10
so 10
tonight 10
before 10
the 10
sundown 10
i 10
took 10
away 10
my 10
garlic 10
and 10
other 10
things 10
and 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
we 10
find 10
this 10
coffin 10
empty 10
but 10
bear 10
with 10
me 10
so 10
far 10
there 10
is 10
much 10
that 10
is 10
strange 10
wait 10
you 10
with 10
me 10
outside 10
unseen 10
and 10
unheard 10
and 10
things 10
much 10
stranger 10
are 10
yet 10
to 10
be 10
so 10
here 10
he 10
shut 10
the 10
dark 10
slide 10
of 10
his 10
lantern 10
now 10
to 10
the 10
outside 10
he 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
we 10
filed 10
out 10
he 10
coming 10
last 10
and 10
locking 10
the 10
door 10
behind 10
him 10
oh 10
but 10
it 10
seemed 10
fresh 10
and 10
pure 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
air 10
after 10
the 10
terror 10
of 10
that 10
vault 10
how 10
sweet 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
clouds 10
race 10
by 10
and 10
the 10
passing 10
gleams 10
of 10
the 10
moonlight 10
between 10
the 10
scudding 10
clouds 10
crossing 10
and 10
passing 10
like 10
the 10
gladness 10
and 10
sorrow 10
of 10
a 10
mans 10
life 10
how 10
sweet 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
breathe 10
the 10
fresh 10
air 10
that 10
had 10
no 10
taint 10
of 10
death 10
and 10
decay 10
how 10
humanizing 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
red 10
lighting 10
of 10
the 10
sky 10
beyond 10
the 10
hill 10
and 10
to 10
hear 10
far 10
away 10
the 10
muffled 10
roar 10
that 10
marks 10
the 10
life 10
of 10
a 10
great 10
city 10
each 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
way 10
was 10
solemn 10
and 10
overcome 10
arthur 10
was 10
silent 10
and 10
was 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
striving 10
to 10
grasp 10
the 10
purpose 10
and 10
the 10
inner 10
meaning 10
of 10
the 10
mystery 10
i 10
was 10
myself 10
tolerably 10
patient 10
and 10
half 10
inclined 10
again 10
to 10
throw 10
aside 10
doubt 10
and 10
to 10
accept 10
van 10
helsings 10
conclusions 10
quincey 10
morris 10
was 10
phlegmatic 10
in 10
the 10
way 10
of 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
accepts 10
all 10
things 10
and 10
accepts 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
spirit 10
of 10
cool 10
bravery 10
with 10
hazard 10
of 10
all 10
he 10
has 10
at 10
stake 10
not 10
being 10
able 10
to 10
smoke 10
he 10
cut 10
himself 10
a 10
goodsized 10
plug 10
of 10
tobacco 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
chew 10
as 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
he 10
was 10
employed 10
in 10
a 10
definite 10
way 10
first 10
he 10
took 10
from 10
his 10
bag 10
a 10
mass 10
of 10
what 10
looked 10
like 10
thin 10
waferlike 10
biscuit 10
which 10
was 10
carefully 10
rolled 10
up 10
in 10
a 10
white 10
napkin 10
next 10
he 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
double 10
handful 10
of 10
some 10
whitish 10
stuff 10
like 10
dough 10
or 10
putty 10
he 10
crumbled 10
the 10
wafer 10
up 10
fine 10
and 10
worked 10
it 10
into 10
the 10
mass 10
between 10
his 10
hands 10
this 10
he 10
then 10
took 10
and 10
rolling 10
it 10
into 10
thin 10
strips 10
began 10
to 10
lay 10
them 10
into 10
the 10
crevices 10
between 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
its 10
setting 10
in 10
the 10
tomb 10
i 10
was 10
somewhat 10
puzzled 10
at 10
this 10
and 10
being 10
close 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
doing 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
drew 10
near 10
also 10
as 10
they 10
too 10
were 10
curious 10
he 10
answered 10
i 10
am 10
closing 10
the 10
tomb 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
undead 10
may 10
not 10
enter 10
and 10
is 10
that 10
stuff 10
you 10
have 10
there 10
going 10
to 10
do 10
it 10
it 10
is 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
which 10
you 10
are 10
using 10
this 10
time 10
the 10
question 10
was 10
by 10
arthur 10
van 10
helsing 10
reverently 10
lifted 10
his 10
hat 10
as 10
he 10
answered 10
the 10
host 10
i 10
brought 10
it 10
from 10
amsterdam 10
i 10
have 10
an 10
indulgence 10
it 10
was 10
an 10
answer 10
that 10
appalled 10
the 10
most 10
sceptical 10
of 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
felt 10
individually 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
presence 10
of 10
such 10
earnest 10
purpose 10
as 10
the 10
professors 10
a 10
purpose 10
which 10
could 10
thus 10
use 10
the 10
to 10
him 10
most 10
sacred 10
of 10
things 10
it 10
was 10
impossible 10
to 10
distrust 10
in 10
respectful 10
silence 10
we 10
took 10
the 10
places 10
assigned 10
to 10
us 10
close 10
round 10
the 10
tomb 10
but 10
hidden 10
from 10
the 10
sight 10
of 10
any 10
one 10
approaching 10
i 10
pitied 10
the 10
others 10
especially 10
arthur 10
i 10
had 10
myself 10
been 10
apprenticed 10
by 10
my 10
former 10
visits 10
to 10
this 10
watching 10
horror 10
and 10
yet 10
i 10
who 10
had 10
up 10
to 10
an 10
hour 10
ago 10
repudiated 10
the 10
proofs 10
felt 10
my 10
heart 10
sink 10
within 10
me 10
never 10
did 10
tombs 10
look 10
so 10
ghastly 10
white 10
never 10
did 10
cypress 10
or 10
yew 10
or 10
juniper 10
so 10
seem 10
the 10
embodiment 10
of 10
funeral 10
gloom 10
never 10
did 10
tree 10
or 10
grass 10
wave 10
or 10
rustle 10
so 10
ominously 10
never 10
did 10
bough 10
creak 10
so 10
mysteriously 10
and 10
never 10
did 10
the 10
faraway 10
howling 10
of 10
dogs 10
send 10
such 10
a 10
woeful 10
presage 10
through 10
the 10
night 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
long 10
spell 10
of 10
silence 10
big 10
aching 10
void 10
and 10
then 10
from 10
the 10
professor 10
a 10
keen 10
ssss 10
he 10
pointed 10
and 10
far 10
down 10
the 10
avenue 10
of 10
yews 10
we 10
saw 10
a 10
white 10
figure 10
advance 10
a 10
dim 10
white 10
figure 10
which 10
held 10
something 10
dark 10
at 10
its 10
breast 10
the 10
figure 10
stopped 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
a 10
ray 10
of 10
moonlight 10
fell 10
upon 10
the 10
masses 10
of 10
driving 10
clouds 10
and 10
showed 10
in 10
startling 10
prominence 10
a 10
darkhaired 10
woman 10
dressed 10
in 10
the 10
cerements 10
of 10
the 10
grave 10
we 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
face 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
bent 10
down 10
over 10
what 10
we 10
saw 10
to 10
be 10
a 10
fairhaired 10
child 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
pause 10
and 10
a 10
sharp 10
little 10
cry 10
such 10
as 10
a 10
child 10
gives 10
in 10
sleep 10
or 10
a 10
dog 10
as 10
it 10
lies 10
before 10
the 10
fire 10
and 10
dreams 10
we 10
were 10
starting 10
forward 10
but 10
the 10
professors 10
warning 10
hand 10
seen 10
by 10
us 10
as 10
he 10
stood 10
behind 10
a 10
yew 10
tree 10
kept 10
us 10
back 10
and 10
then 10
as 10
we 10
looked 10
the 10
white 10
figure 10
moved 10
forwards 10
again 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
near 10
enough 10
for 10
us 10
to 10
see 10
clearly 10
and 10
the 10
moonlight 10
still 10
held 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
grew 10
cold 10
as 10
ice 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
gasp 10
of 10
arthur 10
as 10
we 10
recognized 10
the 10
features 10
of 10
lucy 10
westenra 10
lucy 10
westenra 10
but 10
yet 10
how 10
changed 10
the 10
sweetness 10
was 10
turned 10
to 10
adamantine 10
heartless 10
cruelty 10
and 10
the 10
purity 10
to 10
voluptuous 10
wantonness 10
van 10
helsing 10
stepped 10
out 10
and 10
obedient 10
to 10
his 10
gesture 10
we 10
all 10
advanced 10
too 10
the 10
four 10
of 10
us 10
ranged 10
in 10
a 10
line 10
before 10
the 10
door 10
of 10
the 10
tomb 10
van 10
helsing 10
raised 10
his 10
lantern 10
and 10
drew 10
the 10
slide 10
by 10
the 10
concentrated 10
light 10
that 10
fell 10
on 10
lucys 10
face 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
crimson 10
with 10
fresh 10
blood 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
stream 10
had 10
trickled 10
over 10
her 10
chin 10
and 10
stained 10
the 10
purity 10
of 10
her 10
lawn 10
death 10
robe 10
we 10
shuddered 10
with 10
horror 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
by 10
the 10
tremulous 10
light 10
that 10
even 10
van 10
helsings 10
iron 10
nerve 10
had 10
failed 10
arthur 10
was 10
next 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
seized 10
his 10
arm 10
and 10
held 10
him 10
up 10
he 10
would 10
have 10
fallen 10
when 10
lucy 10
i 10
call 10
the 10
thing 10
that 10
was 10
before 10
us 10
lucy 10
because 10
it 10
bore 10
her 10
shape 10
saw 10
us 10
she 10
drew 10
back 10
with 10
an 10
angry 10
snarl 10
such 10
as 10
a 10
cat 10
gives 10
when 10
taken 10
unawares 10
then 10
her 10
eyes 10
ranged 10
over 10
us 10
lucys 10
eyes 10
in 10
form 10
and 10
color 10
but 10
lucys 10
eyes 10
unclean 10
and 10
full 10
of 10
hell 10
fire 10
instead 10
of 10
the 10
pure 10
gentle 10
orbs 10
we 10
knew 10
at 10
that 10
moment 10
the 10
remnant 10
of 10
my 10
love 10
passed 10
into 10
hate 10
and 10
loathing 10
had 10
she 10
then 10
to 10
be 10
killed 10
i 10
could 10
have 10
done 10
it 10
with 10
savage 10
delight 10
as 10
she 10
looked 10
her 10
eyes 10
blazed 10
with 10
unholy 10
light 10
and 10
the 10
face 10
became 10
wreathed 10
with 10
a 10
voluptuous 10
smile 10
oh 10
god 10
how 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
shudder 10
to 10
see 10
it 10
with 10
a 10
careless 10
motion 10
she 10
flung 10
to 10
the 10
ground 10
callous 10
as 10
a 10
devil 10
the 10
child 10
that 10
up 10
to 10
now 10
she 10
had 10
clutched 10
strenuously 10
to 10
her 10
breast 10
growling 10
over 10
it 10
as 10
a 10
dog 10
growls 10
over 10
a 10
bone 10
the 10
child 10
gave 10
a 10
sharp 10
cry 10
and 10
lay 10
there 10
moaning 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
coldbloodedness 10
in 10
the 10
act 10
which 10
wrung 10
a 10
groan 10
from 10
arthur 10
when 10
she 10
advanced 10
to 10
him 10
with 10
outstretched 10
arms 10
and 10
a 10
wanton 10
smile 10
he 10
fell 10
back 10
and 10
hid 10
his 10
face 10
in 10
his 10
hands 10
she 10
still 10
advanced 10
however 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
languorous 10
voluptuous 10
grace 10
said 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
arthur 10
leave 10
these 10
others 10
and 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
my 10
arms 10
are 10
hungry 10
for 10
you 10
come 10
and 10
we 10
can 10
rest 10
together 10
come 10
my 10
husband 10
come 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
diabolically 10
sweet 10
in 10
her 10
tones 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
tinkling 10
of 10
glass 10
when 10
struck 10
which 10
rang 10
through 10
the 10
brains 10
even 10
of 10
us 10
who 10
heard 10
the 10
words 10
addressed 10
to 10
another 10
as 10
for 10
arthur 10
he 10
seemed 10
under 10
a 10
spell 10
moving 10
his 10
hands 10
from 10
his 10
face 10
he 10
opened 10
wide 10
his 10
arms 10
she 10
was 10
leaping 10
for 10
them 10
when 10
van 10
helsing 10
sprang 10
forward 10
and 10
held 10
between 10
them 10
his 10
little 10
golden 10
crucifix 10
she 10
recoiled 10
from 10
it 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
suddenly 10
distorted 10
face 10
full 10
of 10
rage 10
dashed 10
past 10
him 10
as 10
if 10
to 10
enter 10
the 10
tomb 10
when 10
within 10
a 10
foot 10
or 10
two 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
however 10
she 10
stopped 10
as 10
if 10
arrested 10
by 10
some 10
irresistible 10
force 10
then 10
she 10
turned 10
and 10
her 10
face 10
was 10
shown 10
in 10
the 10
clear 10
burst 10
of 10
moonlight 10
and 10
by 10
the 10
lamp 10
which 10
had 10
now 10
no 10
quiver 10
from 10
van 10
helsings 10
nerves 10
never 10
did 10
i 10
see 10
such 10
baffled 10
malice 10
on 10
a 10
face 10
and 10
never 10
i 10
trust 10
shall 10
such 10
ever 10
be 10
seen 10
again 10
by 10
mortal 10
eyes 10
the 10
beautiful 10
color 10
became 10
livid 10
the 10
eyes 10
seemed 10
to 10
throw 10
out 10
sparks 10
of 10
hell 10
fire 10
the 10
brows 10
were 10
wrinkled 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
folds 10
of 10
flesh 10
were 10
the 10
coils 10
of 10
medusas 10
snakes 10
and 10
the 10
lovely 10
bloodstained 10
mouth 10
grew 10
to 10
an 10
open 10
square 10
as 10
in 10
the 10
passion 10
masks 10
of 10
the 10
greeks 10
and 10
japanese 10
if 10
ever 10
a 10
face 10
meant 10
death 10
if 10
looks 10
could 10
kill 10
we 10
saw 10
it 10
at 10
that 10
moment 10
and 10
so 10
for 10
full 10
half 10
a 10
minute 10
which 10
seemed 10
an 10
eternity 10
se 10
remained 10
between 10
the 10
lifted 10
crucifix 10
and 10
the 10
sacred 10
closing 10
of 10
her 10
means 10
of 10
entry 10
van 10
helsing 10
broke 10
the 10
silence 10
by 10
asking 10
arthur 10
answer 10
me 10
oh 10
my 10
friend 10
am 10
i 10
to 10
proceed 10
in 10
my 10
work 10
do 10
as 10
you 10
will 10
friend 10
do 10
as 10
you 10
will 10
there 10
can 10
be 10
no 10
horror 10
like 10
this 10
ever 10
any 10
more 10
and 10
he 10
groaned 10
in 10
spirit 10
quincey 10
and 10
i 10
simultaneously 10
moved 10
towards 10
him 10
and 10
took 10
his 10
arms 10
we 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
click 10
of 10
the 10
closing 10
lantern 10
as 10
van 10
helsing 10
held 10
it 10
down 10
coming 10
close 10
to 10
the 10
tomb 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
remove 10
from 10
the 10
chinks 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
sacred 10
emblem 10
which 10
he 10
had 10
placed 10
there 10
we 10
all 10
looked 10
on 10
with 10
horrified 10
amazement 10
as 10
we 10
saw 10
when 10
he 10
stood 10
back 10
the 10
woman 10
with 10
a 10
corporeal 10
body 10
as 10
real 10
at 10
that 10
moment 10
as 10
our 10
own 10
pass 10
through 10
the 10
interstice 10
where 10
scarce 10
a 10
knife 10
blade 10
could 10
have 10
gone 10
we 10
all 10
felt 10
a 10
glad 10
sense 10
of 10
relief 10
when 10
we 10
saw 10
the 10
professor 10
calmly 10
restoring 10
the 10
strings 10
of 10
putty 10
to 10
the 10
edges 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
when 10
this 10
was 10
done 10
he 10
lifted 10
the 10
child 10
and 10
said 10
come 10
now 10
my 10
friends 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
no 10
more 10
till 10
tomorrow 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
funeral 10
at 10
noon 10
so 10
here 10
we 10
shall 10
all 10
come 10
before 10
long 10
after 10
that 10
the 10
friends 10
of 10
the 10
dead 10
will 10
all 10
be 10
gone 10
by 10
two 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
sexton 10
locks 10
the 10
gate 10
we 10
shall 10
remain 10
then 10
there 10
is 10
more 10
to 10
do 10
but 10
not 10
like 10
this 10
of 10
tonight 10
as 10
for 10
this 10
little 10
one 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
much 10
harmed 10
and 10
by 10
tomorrow 10
night 10
he 10
shall 10
be 10
well 10
we 10
shall 10
leave 10
him 10
where 10
the 10
police 10
will 10
find 10
him 10
as 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
night 10
and 10
then 10
to 10
home 10
coming 10
close 10
to 10
arthur 10
he 10
said 10
my 10
friend 10
arthur 10
you 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
sore 10
trial 10
but 10
after 10
when 10
you 10
look 10
back 10
you 10
will 10
see 10
how 10
it 10
was 10
necessary 10
you 10
are 10
now 10
in 10
the 10
bitter 10
waters 10
my 10
child 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
tomorrow 10
you 10
will 10
please 10
god 10
have 10
passed 10
them 10
and 10
have 10
drunk 10
of 10
the 10
sweet 10
waters 10
so 10
do 10
not 10
mourn 10
overmuch 10
till 10
then 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
ask 10
you 10
to 10
forgive 10
me 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
came 10
home 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
we 10
tried 10
to 10
cheer 10
each 10
other 10
on 10
the 10
way 10
we 10
had 10
left 10
behind 10
the 10
child 10
in 10
safety 10
and 10
were 10
tired 10
so 10
we 10
all 10
slept 10
with 10
more 10
or 10
less 10
reality 10
of 10
sleep 10
september 10
nighta 10
little 10
before 10
twelve 10
oclock 10
we 10
three 10
arthur 10
quincey 10
morris 10
and 10
myself 10
called 10
for 10
the 10
professor 10
it 10
was 10
odd 10
to 10
notice 10
that 10
by 10
common 10
consent 10
we 10
had 10
all 10
put 10
on 10
black 10
clothes 10
of 10
course 10
arthur 10
wore 10
black 10
for 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
deep 10
mourning 10
but 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
us 10
wore 10
it 10
by 10
instinct 10
we 10
got 10
to 10
the 10
graveyard 10
by 10
halfpast 10
one 10
and 10
strolled 10
about 10
keeping 10
out 10
of 10
official 10
observation 10
so 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
gravediggers 10
had 10
completed 10
their 10
task 10
and 10
the 10
sexton 10
under 10
the 10
belief 10
that 10
every 10
one 10
had 10
gone 10
had 10
locked 10
the 10
gate 10
we 10
had 10
the 10
place 10
all 10
to 10
ourselves 10
van 10
helsing 10
instead 10
of 10
his 10
little 10
black 10
bag 10
had 10
with 10
him 10
a 10
long 10
leather 10
one 10
something 10
like 10
a 10
cricketing 10
bag 10
it 10
was 10
manifestly 10
of 10
fair 10
weight 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
alone 10
and 10
had 10
heard 10
the 10
last 10
of 10
the 10
footsteps 10
die 10
out 10
up 10
the 10
road 10
we 10
silently 10
and 10
as 10
if 10
by 10
ordered 10
intention 10
followed 10
the 10
professor 10
to 10
the 10
tomb 10
he 10
unlocked 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
we 10
entered 10
closing 10
it 10
behind 10
us 10
then 10
he 10
took 10
from 10
his 10
bag 10
the 10
lantern 10
which 10
he 10
lit 10
and 10
also 10
two 10
wax 10
candles 10
which 10
when 10
lighted 10
he 10
stuck 10
by 10
melting 10
their 10
own 10
ends 10
on 10
other 10
coffins 10
so 10
that 10
they 10
might 10
give 10
light 10
sufficient 10
to 10
work 10
by 10
when 10
he 10
again 10
lifted 10
the 10
lid 10
off 10
lucys 10
coffin 10
we 10
all 10
looked 10
arthur 10
trembling 10
like 10
an 10
aspen 10
and 10
saw 10
that 10
the 10
corpse 10
lay 10
there 10
in 10
all 10
its 10
death 10
beauty 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
love 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
nothing 10
but 10
loathing 10
for 10
the 10
foul 10
thing 10
which 10
had 10
taken 10
lucys 10
shape 10
without 10
her 10
soul 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
even 10
arthurs 10
face 10
grow 10
hard 10
as 10
he 10
looked 10
presently 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
is 10
this 10
really 10
lucys 10
body 10
or 10
only 10
a 10
demon 10
in 10
her 10
shape 10
it 10
is 10
her 10
body 10
and 10
yet 10
not 10
it 10
but 10
wait 10
a 10
while 10
and 10
you 10
shall 10
see 10
her 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
and 10
is 10
she 10
seemed 10
like 10
a 10
nightmare 10
of 10
lucy 10
as 10
she 10
lay 10
there 10
the 10
pointed 10
teeth 10
the 10
blood 10
stained 10
voluptuous 10
mouth 10
which 10
made 10
one 10
shudder 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
whole 10
carnal 10
and 10
unspirited 10
appearance 10
seeming 10
like 10
a 10
devilish 10
mockery 10
of 10
lucys 10
sweet 10
purity 10
van 10
helsing 10
with 10
his 10
usual 10
methodicalness 10
began 10
taking 10
the 10
various 10
contents 10
from 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
placing 10
them 10
ready 10
for 10
use 10
first 10
he 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
soldering 10
iron 10
and 10
some 10
plumbing 10
solder 10
and 10
then 10
small 10
oil 10
lamp 10
which 10
gave 10
out 10
when 10
lit 10
in 10
a 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
tomb 10
gas 10
which 10
burned 10
at 10
a 10
fierce 10
heat 10
with 10
a 10
blue 10
flame 10
then 10
his 10
operating 10
knives 10
which 10
he 10
placed 10
to 10
hand 10
and 10
last 10
a 10
round 10
wooden 10
stake 10
some 10
two 10
and 10
a 10
half 10
or 10
three 10
inches 10
thick 10
and 10
about 10
three 10
feet 10
long 10
one 10
end 10
of 10
it 10
was 10
hardened 10
by 10
charring 10
in 10
the 10
fire 10
and 10
was 10
sharpened 10
to 10
a 10
fine 10
point 10
with 10
this 10
stake 10
came 10
a 10
heavy 10
hammer 10
such 10
as 10
in 10
households 10
is 10
used 10
in 10
the 10
coal 10
cellar 10
for 10
breaking 10
the 10
lumps 10
to 10
me 10
a 10
doctors 10
preperations 10
for 10
work 10
of 10
any 10
kind 10
are 10
stimulating 10
and 10
bracing 10
but 10
the 10
effect 10
of 10
these 10
things 10
on 10
both 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
was 10
to 10
cause 10
them 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
consternation 10
they 10
both 10
however 10
kept 10
their 10
courage 10
and 10
remained 10
silent 10
and 10
quiet 10
when 10
all 10
was 10
ready 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
before 10
we 10
do 10
anything 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
this 10
it 10
is 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
lore 10
and 10
experience 10
of 10
the 10
ancients 10
and 10
of 10
all 10
those 10
who 10
have 10
studied 10
the 10
powers 10
of 10
the 10
undead 10
when 10
they 10
become 10
such 10
there 10
comes 10
with 10
the 10
change 10
the 10
curse 10
of 10
immortality 10
they 10
cannot 10
die 10
but 10
must 10
go 10
on 10
age 10
after 10
age 10
adding 10
new 10
victims 10
and 10
multiplying 10
the 10
evils 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
for 10
all 10
that 10
die 10
from 10
the 10
preying 10
of 10
the 10
undead 10
become 10
themselves 10
undead 10
and 10
prey 10
on 10
their 10
kind 10
and 10
so 10
the 10
circle 10
goes 10
on 10
ever 10
widening 10
like 10
as 10
the 10
ripples 10
from 10
a 10
stone 10
thrown 10
in 10
the 10
water 10
friend 10
arthur 10
if 10
you 10
had 10
met 10
that 10
kiss 10
which 10
you 10
know 10
of 10
before 10
poor 10
lucy 10
die 10
or 10
again 10
last 10
night 10
when 10
you 10
open 10
your 10
arms 10
to 10
her 10
you 10
would 10
in 10
time 10
when 10
you 10
had 10
died 10
have 10
become 10
nosferatu 10
as 10
they 10
call 10
it 10
in 10
eastern 10
europe 10
and 10
would 10
for 10
all 10
time 10
make 10
more 10
of 10
those 10
undeads 10
that 10
so 10
have 10
filled 10
us 10
with 10
horror 10
the 10
career 10
of 10
this 10
so 10
unhappy 10
dear 10
lady 10
is 10
but 10
just 10
begun 10
those 10
children 10
whose 10
blood 10
she 10
sucked 10
are 10
not 10
as 10
yet 10
so 10
much 10
the 10
worse 10
but 10
if 10
she 10
lives 10
on 10
undead 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
they 10
lose 10
their 10
blood 10
and 10
by 10
her 10
power 10
over 10
them 10
they 10
come 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
so 10
she 10
draw 10
their 10
blood 10
with 10
that 10
so 10
wicked 10
mouth 10
but 10
if 10
she 10
die 10
in 10
truth 10
then 10
all 10
cease 10
the 10
tiny 10
wounds 10
of 10
the 10
throats 10
disappear 10
and 10
they 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
their 10
play 10
unknowing 10
ever 10
of 10
what 10
has 10
been 10
but 10
of 10
the 10
most 10
blessed 10
of 10
all 10
when 10
this 10
now 10
undead 10
be 10
made 10
to 10
rest 10
as 10
true 10
dead 10
then 10
the 10
soul 10
of 10
the 10
poor 10
lady 10
whom 10
we 10
love 10
shall 10
again 10
be 10
free 10
instead 10
of 10
working 10
wickedness 10
by 10
night 10
and 10
growing 10
more 10
debased 10
in 10
the 10
assimilating 10
of 10
it 10
by 10
day 10
she 10
shall 10
take 10
her 10
place 10
with 10
the 10
other 10
angels 10
so 10
that 10
my 10
friend 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
blessed 10
hand 10
for 10
her 10
that 10
shall 10
strike 10
the 10
blow 10
that 10
sets 10
her 10
free 10
to 10
this 10
i 10
am 10
willing 10
but 10
is 10
there 10
none 10
amongst 10
us 10
who 10
has 10
a 10
better 10
right 10
will 10
it 10
be 10
no 10
joy 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
hereafter 10
in 10
the 10
silence 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
when 10
sleep 10
is 10
not 10
it 10
was 10
my 10
hand 10
that 10
sent 10
her 10
to 10
the 10
stars 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
hand 10
of 10
him 10
that 10
loved 10
her 10
best 10
the 10
hand 10
that 10
of 10
all 10
she 10
would 10
herself 10
have 10
chosen 10
had 10
it 10
been 10
to 10
her 10
to 10
choose 10
tell 10
me 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
such 10
a 10
one 10
amongst 10
us 10
we 10
all 10
looked 10
at 10
arthur 10
he 10
saw 10
too 10
what 10
we 10
all 10
did 10
the 10
infinite 10
kindness 10
which 10
suggested 10
that 10
his 10
should 10
be 10
the 10
hand 10
which 10
would 10
restore 10
lucy 10
to 10
us 10
as 10
a 10
holy 10
and 10
not 10
an 10
unholy 10
memory 10
he 10
stepped 10
forward 10
and 10
said 10
bravely 10
though 10
his 10
hand 10
trembled 10
and 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
as 10
pale 10
as 10
snow 10
my 10
true 10
friend 10
from 10
the 10
bottom 10
of 10
my 10
broken 10
heart 10
i 10
thank 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
what 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
falter 10
van 10
helsing 10
laid 10
a 10
hand 10
on 10
his 10
shoulder 10
and 10
said 10
brave 10
lad 10
a 10
moments 10
courage 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
done 10
this 10
stake 10
must 10
be 10
driven 10
through 10
her 10
it 10
well 10
be 10
a 10
fearful 10
ordeal 10
be 10
not 10
deceived 10
in 10
that 10
but 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
only 10
a 10
short 10
time 10
and 10
you 10
will 10
then 10
rejoice 10
more 10
than 10
your 10
pain 10
was 10
great 10
from 10
this 10
grim 10
tomb 10
you 10
will 10
emerge 10
as 10
though 10
you 10
tread 10
on 10
air 10
but 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
falter 10
when 10
once 10
you 10
have 10
begun 10
only 10
think 10
that 10
we 10
your 10
true 10
friends 10
are 10
round 10
you 10
and 10
that 10
we 10
pray 10
for 10
you 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
go 10
on 10
said 10
arthur 10
hoarselytell 10
me 10
what 10
i 10
am 10
to 10
do 10
take 10
this 10
stake 10
in 10
your 10
left 10
hand 10
ready 10
to 10
place 10
to 10
the 10
point 10
over 10
the 10
heart 10
and 10
the 10
hammer 10
in 10
your 10
right 10
then 10
when 10
we 10
begin 10
our 10
prayer 10
for 10
the 10
dead 10
i 10
shall 10
read 10
him 10
i 10
have 10
here 10
the 10
book 10
and 10
the 10
others 10
shall 10
follow 10
strike 10
in 10
gods 10
name 10
that 10
so 10
all 10
may 10
be 10
well 10
with 10
the 10
dead 10
that 10
we 10
love 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
undead 10
pass 10
away 10
arthur 10
took 10
the 10
stake 10
and 10
the 10
hammer 10
and 10
when 10
once 10
his 10
mind 10
was 10
set 10
on 10
action 10
his 10
hands 10
never 10
trembled 10
nor 10
even 10
quivered 10
van 10
helsing 10
opened 10
his 10
missal 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
read 10
and 10
quincey 10
and 10
i 10
followed 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
arthur 10
placed 10
the 10
point 10
over 10
the 10
heart 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
its 10
dint 10
in 10
the 10
white 10
flesh 10
then 10
he 10
struck 10
with 10
all 10
his 10
might 10
the 10
thing 10
in 10
the 10
coffin 10
writhed 10
and 10
a 10
hideous 10
bloodcurdling 10
screech 10
came 10
from 10
the 10
opened 10
red 10
lips 10
the 10
body 10
shook 10
and 10
quivered 10
and 10
twisted 10
in 10
wild 10
contortions 10
the 10
sharp 10
white 10
champed 10
together 10
till 10
the 10
lips 10
were 10
cut 10
and 10
the 10
mouth 10
was 10
smeared 10
with 10
a 10
crimson 10
foam 10
but 10
arthur 10
never 10
faltered 10
he 10
looked 10
like 10
a 10
figure 10
of 10
thor 10
as 10
his 10
untrembling 10
arm 10
rose 10
and 10
fell 10
driving 10
deeper 10
and 10
deeper 10
the 10
mercybearing 10
stake 10
whilst 10
the 10
blood 10
from 10
the 10
pierced 10
heart 10
welled 10
and 10
spurted 10
up 10
around 10
it 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
set 10
and 10
high 10
duty 10
seemed 10
to 10
shine 10
through 10
it 10
the 10
sight 10
of 10
it 10
gave 10
us 10
courage 10
so 10
that 10
our 10
voices 10
seemed 10
to 10
ring 10
through 10
the 10
little 10
vault 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
writhing 10
and 10
quivering 10
of 10
the 10
body 10
became 10
less 10
and 10
the 10
teeth 10
seemed 10
to 10
champ 10
and 10
the 10
face 10
to 10
quiver 10
finally 10
it 10
lay 10
still 10
the 10
terrible 10
task 10
was 10
over 10
the 10
hammer 10
fell 10
from 10
arthurs 10
hand 10
he 10
reeled 10
and 10
would 10
have 10
fallen 10
had 10
we 10
not 10
caught 10
him 10
the 10
great 10
drops 10
of 10
sweat 10
sprang 10
from 10
his 10
forehead 10
and 10
his 10
breath 10
came 10
in 10
broken 10
gasps 10
it 10
had 10
indeed 10
been 10
an 10
awful 10
strain 10
on 10
him 10
and 10
had 10
he 10
not 10
been 10
forced 10
to 10
his 10
task 10
by 10
more 10
than 10
human 10
considerations 10
he 10
could 10
never 10
have 10
gone 10
through 10
with 10
it 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
we 10
were 10
so 10
taken 10
up 10
with 10
him 10
that 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
look 10
towards 10
the 10
coffin 10
when 10
we 10
did 10
however 10
a 10
murmur 10
of 10
startled 10
surprise 10
ran 10
from 10
one 10
to 10
the 10
other 10
of 10
us 10
we 10
gazed 10
so 10
eagerly 10
that 10
arthur 10
rose 10
for 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
seated 10
on 10
the 10
ground 10
and 10
came 10
and 10
looked 10
too 10
and 10
then 10
a 10
glad 10
strange 10
light 10
broke 10
over 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
dispelled 10
altogether 10
the 10
gloom 10
of 10
horror 10
that 10
lay 10
upon 10
it 10
there 10
in 10
the 10
coffin 10
lay 10
no 10
longer 10
the 10
foul 10
thing 10
that 10
we 10
has 10
so 10
dreaded 10
and 10
grown 10
to 10
hate 10
that 10
the 10
work 10
of 10
her 10
destruction 10
was 10
yielded 10
as 10
a 10
privilege 10
to 10
the 10
one 10
best 10
entitled 10
to 10
it 10
but 10
lucy 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
seen 10
her 10
in 10
life 10
with 10
her 10
face 10
of 10
unequalled 10
sweetness 10
and 10
purity 10
true 10
that 10
there 10
were 10
there 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
seen 10
them 10
in 10
life 10
the 10
traces 10
of 10
care 10
and 10
pain 10
and 10
waste 10
but 10
these 10
were 10
all 10
dear 10
to 10
us 10
for 10
they 10
marked 10
her 10
truth 10
to 10
what 10
we 10
knew 10
one 10
and 10
all 10
we 10
felt 10
that 10
the 10
holy 10
calm 10

lay 10
like 10
sunshine 10
over 10
the 10
wasted 10
face 10
and 10
form 10
was 10
only 10
an 10
earthly 10
token 10
and 10
symbol 10
of 10
the 10
calm 10
that 10

the 10
reaction 10
of 10

terrible 10
strain 10

as 10

took 10
the 10
old 10
mans 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
raising 10

and 10
laying 10
his 10
head 10
on 10
his 10
breast 10
cried 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
silently 10
whilst 10
we 10
stood 10
unmoving 10
when 10
he 10
raised 10
his 10
head 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
to 10

she 10
would 10
have 10
you 10
to 10
if 10
for 10
her 10
to 10
choose 10
for 10
she 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
grinning 10
devil 10
now 10
not 10
any 10
more 10
a 10
foul 10
thing 10
for 10
all 10
eternity 10
no 10

is 10
with 10
him 10
arthur 10
bent 10
and 10
kissed 10
her 10
and 10
then 10
we 10
sent 10
him 10
and 10
quincey 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
tomb 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
i 10
sawed 10
the 10
top 10
off 10
the 10
stake 10
leaving 10
the 10
point 10
of 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
body 10
then 10
we 10
cut 10
off 10
the 10
head 10
and 10
filled 10
the 10
mouth 10
with 10
garlic 10
we 10
soldered 10
up 10
the 10
leaden 10
coffin 10
screwed 10
on 10
the 10
coffin 10
lid 10
and 10
gathering 10
up 10
our 10
belongings 10
came 10
away 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
locked 10
the 10
door 10
he 10
gave 10
the 10
key 10
to 10
arthur 10
outside 10
the 10
air 10
was 10
sweet 10
the 10
sun 10
shone 10
and 10
the 10
birds 10
sang 10
and 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
all 10
nature 10
were 10
tuned 10
to 10
a 10
different 10
pitch 10
there 10
was 10
gladness 10
and 10
mirth 10
and 10
peace 10
everywhere 10
for 10
we 10
were 10
at 10
rest 10
ourselves 10
on 10
one 10
account 10
and 10
we 10
were 10
glad 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
a 10
tempered 10
joy 10
before 10
we 10
moved 10
away 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
now 10
my 10
friends 10
one 10
step 10
or 10
our 10
work 10
is 10
done 10
one 10
the 10
most 10
harrowing 10
to 10
ourselves 10
but 10
there 10
remains 10
a 10
greater 10
task 10
to 10
find 10
out 10
the 10
author 10
of 10
all 10
this 10
or 10
sorrow 10
and 10
to 10
stamp 10
him 10
out 10
i 10
have 10
clues 10
which 10
we 10
can 10
follow 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
long 10
task 10
and 10
a 10
difficult 10
one 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
danger 10
in 10
it 10
and 10
pain 10
shall 10
you 10
not 10
all 10
help 10
me 10
we 10
have 10
learned 10
to 10
believe 10
all 10
of 10
us 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
and 10
since 10
so 10
do 10
we 10
not 10
see 10
our 10
duty 10
yes 10
and 10
do 10
we 10
not 10
promise 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
to 10
the 10
bitter 10
end 10
each 10
in 10
turn 10
we 10
took 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
the 10
promise 10
was 10
made 10
then 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10

then 10
made 10
ready 10
for 10
his 10
departure 10
and 10
shortly 10
drove 10
off 10
to 10
liverpool 10
street 10
i 10
took 10
my 10
way 10
to 10
paddington 10
where 10
i 10
arrived 10
about 10
fifteen 10
minutes 10
before 10
the 10
train 10
came 10
in 10
the 10
crowd 10
melted 10
away 10
after 10
the 10
bustling 10
fashion 10
common 10
to 10
arrival 10
platforms 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
feel 10
uneasy 10
lest 10
i 10
might 10
miss 10
my 10
guest 10
when 10
a 10
sweetfaced 10
dainty 10
looking 10
girl 10
stepped 10
up 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
quick 10
glance 10
said 10
dr 10
seward 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
and 10
you 10
are 10
mrs 10
harker 10
i 10
answered 10
at 10
once 10
whereupon 10
she 10
held 10
out 10
her 10
hand 10
i 10
knew 10
you 10
from 10
the 10
description 10
of 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucy 10
but 10
she 10
stopped 10
suddenly 10
and 10
a 10
quick 10
blush 10
overspread 10
her 10
face 10
the 10
blush 10
that 10
rose 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
cheeks 10
somehow 10
set 10
us 10
both 10
at 10
ease 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
tacit 10
answer 10
to 10
her 10
own 10
i 10
got 10
her 10
luggage 10
which 10
included 10
a 10
typewriter 10
and 10
we 10
took 10
the 10
underground 10
to 10
fenchurch 10
street 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
sent 10
a 10
wire 10
to 10
my 10
housekeeper 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
sitting 10
room 10
and 10
a 10
bedroom 10
prepared 10
at 10
once 10
for 10
mrs 10
harker 10
in 10
due 10
time 10
we 10
arrived 10
she 10
knew 10
of 10
course 10
that 10
the 10
place 10
was 10
a 10
lunatic 10
asylum 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
unable 10
to 10
repress 10
a 10
shudder 10
when 10
we 10
entered 10
she 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
if 10
she 10
might 10
she 10
would 10
come 10
presently 10
to 10
my 10
study 10
as 10
she 10
had 10
much 10
to 10
say 10
so 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
finishing 10
my 10
entry 10
in 10
my 10
phonograph 10
diary 10
whilst 10
i 10
await 10
her 10
as 10
yet 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
had 10
the 10
chance 10
of 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
papers 10
which 10
van 10
helsing 10
left 10
with 10
me 10
though 10
they 10
lie 10
open 10
before 10
me 10
i 10
must 10
get 10
her 10
interested 10
in 10
something 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
have 10
an 10
opportunity 10
of 10
reading 10
them 10
she 10
does 10
not 10
know 10
how 10
precious 10
time 10
is 10
or 10
what 10
a 10
task 10
we 10
have 10
in 10
hand 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
careful 10
not 10
to 10
frighten 10

to 10
dr 10
sewards 10
study 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
i 10
paused 10
a 10
moment 10
for 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
heard 10
him 10
talking 10
with 10
some 10
one 10
as 10
however 10
he 10
had 10
pressed 10
me 10
to 10
be 10
quick 10
i 10
knocked 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
on 10
his 10
calling 10
out 10
come 10
in 10
i 10
entered 10
to 10
my 10
intense 10
surprise 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
with 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
quite 10
alone 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
opposite 10
him 10
was 10
what 10
i 10
knew 10
at 10
once 10
from 10
the 10
description 10
to 10
be 10
a 10
phonograph 10
i 10
had 10
never 10
seen 10
one 10
and 10
was 10
much 10
interested 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
keep 10
you 10
waiting 10
i 10
said 10
but 10
i 10
stayed 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
as 10
i 10
heard 10
you 10
talking 10
and 10
thought 10
there 10
was 10
someone 10
with 10
you 10
oh 10
he 10
replied 10
with 10
a 10
smile 10
i 10
was 10
only 10
entering 10
my 10
diary 10
your 10
diary 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
in 10
surprise 10
yes 10
he 10
answered 10
i 10
keep 10
it 10
in 10
this 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
laid 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
the 10
phonograph 10
i 10
felt 10
quite 10
excited 10
over 10
it 10
and 10
blurted 10
out 10
why 10
this 10
beats 10
even 10
shorthand 10
may 10
i 10
hear 10
it 10
say 10
something 10
certainly 10
he 10
replied 10
with 10
alacrity 10
and 10
stood 10
up 10
to 10
put 10
it 10
in 10
train 10
for 10
speaking 10
then 10
he 10
paused 10
and 10
a 10
troubled 10
look 10
overspread 10
his 10
face 10
the 10
fact 10
is 10
he 10
began 10
awkwardlyi 10
only 10
keep 10
my 10
diary 10
in 10
it 10
and 10
as 10
it 10
is 10
entirely 10
almost 10
entirely 10
about 10
my 10
cases 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
awkward 10
that 10
is 10
i 10
mean 10
he 10
stopped 10
and 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
help 10
him 10
out 10
of 10
his 10
embarrassment 10
you 10
helped 10
to 10
attend 10
dear 10
lucy 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
let 10
me 10
hear 10
how 10
she 10
died 10
for 10
all 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
of 10
her 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
very 10
grateful 10
she 10
was 10
very 10
very 10
dear 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
he 10
answered 10
with 10
a 10
horrorstruck 10
look 10
in 10
his 10
face 10
tell 10
you 10
of 10
her 10
death 10
not 10
for 10
the 10
wide 10
world 10
why 10
not 10
i 10
asked 10
for 10
some 10
grave 10
terrible 10
feeling 10
was 10
coming 10
over 10
me 10
again 10
he 10
paused 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
trying 10
to 10
invent 10
an 10
excuse 10
at 10
length 10
he 10
stammered 10
out 10
you 10
see 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
how 10
to 10
pick 10
out 10
any 10
particular 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
diary 10
even 10
while 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
an 10
idea 10
dawned 10
upon 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
unconscious 10
simplicity 10
in 10
a 10
different 10
voice 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
naivete 10
of 10
a 10
child 10
thats 10
quite 10
true 10
upon 10
my 10
honor 10
honest 10
indian 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
smile 10
at 10
which 10
he 10
grimacedi 10
gave 10
myself 10
away 10
that 10
time 10
he 10
said 10
but 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
although 10
i 10
have 10
kept 10
the 10
diary 10
for 10
months 10
past 10
it 10
never 10
once 10
struck 10
me 10
how 10
i 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
find 10
any 10
particular 10
part 10
of 10
it 10
in 10
case 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
look 10
it 10
up 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
my 10
mind 10
was 10
made 10
up 10
that 10
the 10
diary 10
of 10
a 10
doctor 10
who 10
attended 10
lucy 10
might 10
have 10
something 10
to 10
add 10
to 10
the 10
sum 10
of 10
our 10
knowledge 10
of 10
that 10
terrible 10
being 10
and 10
i 10
said 10
boldly 10
then 10
dr 10
seward 10
you 10
had 10
better 10
let 10
me 10
copy 10
it 10
out 10
for 10
you 10
on 10
my 10
typewriter 10
he 10
grew 10
to 10
a 10
positively 10
deathly 10
pallor 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
no 10
no 10
no 10
for 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
i 10
wouldnt 10
let 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
terrible 10
story 10
then 10
it 10
was 10
terrible 10
my 10
intuition 10
was 10
right 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
thought 10
and 10
as 10
my 10
eyes 10
ranged 10
the 10
room 10
unconsciously 10
looking 10
for 10
something 10
or 10
some 10
opportunity 10
to 10
aid 10
me 10
they 10
lit 10
on 10
a 10
great 10
batch 10
of 10
typewriting 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
his 10
eyes 10
caught 10
the 10
look 10
in 10
mine 10
and 10
without 10
his 10
thinking 10
followed 10
their 10
direction 10
as 10
they 10
saw 10
the 10
parcel 10
he 10
realized 10
my 10
meaning 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
me 10
i 10
said 10
when 10
you 10
have 10
read 10
those 10
papers 10
my 10
own 10
diary 10
and 10
my 10
husbands 10
also 10
which 10
i 10
have 10
typed 10
you 10
will 10
know 10
me 10
better 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
faltered 10
in 10
giving 10
every 10
thought 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
in 10
this 10
cause 10
but 10
of 10
course 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
me 10
yet 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
expect 10
you 10
to 10
trust 10
me 10
so 10
far 10
he 10
is 10
certainly 10
a 10
man 10
of 10
noble 10
nature 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucy 10
was 10
right 10
about 10
him 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
opened 10
a 10
large 10
drawer 10
in 10
which 10
were 10
arranged 10
in 10
order 10
a 10
number 10
of 10
hollow 10
cylinders 10
of 10
metal 10
covered 10
with 10
dark 10
wax 10
and 10
said 10
you 10
are 10
quite 10
right 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
trust 10
you 10
because 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
you 10
but 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
now 10
and 10
let 10
me 10
say 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
known 10
you 10
long 10
ago 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
lucy 10
told 10
you 10
of 10
me 10
she 10
told 10
me 10
of 10
you 10
too 10
may 10
i 10
make 10
the 10
only 10
atonement 10
in 10
my 10
power 10
take 10
the 10
cylinders 10
and 10
hear 10
them 10
the 10
first 10
halfdozen 10
of 10
them 10
are 10
personal 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
they 10
will 10
not 10
horrify 10
you 10
then 10
you 10
will 10
know 10
me 10
better 10

meantime 10
i 10
shall 10
read 10
over 10
some 10
of 10
these 10
documents 10
and 10
shall 10
be 10
better 10
able 10
to 10
understand 10
certain 10
things 10
he 10
carried 10
the 10
phonograph 10
himself 10
up 10
to 10
my 10
sitting 10
room 10
and 10
adjusted 10
it 10
for 10
me 10
now 10
i 10
shall 10
learn 10
something 10
pleasant 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
for 10
it 10
will 10
tell 10
me 10
the 10
other 10
side 10
of 10
a 10
true 10
love 10
episode 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
know 10
one 10
side 10
already 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
septemberi 10
was 10
so 10
absorbed 10
in 10
that 10
wonderful 10
diary 10
of 10
jonathan 10
harker 10
and 10
that 10
other 10
of 10
his 10
wife 10
that 10
i 10
let 10
the 10
time 10
run 10
on 10
without 10
thinking 10
mrs 10
harker 10
was 10
not 10
down 10
when 10
the 10
maid 10
came 10
to 10
announce 10
dinner 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
she 10
is 10
possibly 10
tired 10
let 10
dinner 10
wait 10
an 10
hour 10
and 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
my 10
work 10
i 10
had 10
just 10
finished 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
diary 10
when 10
she 10
came 10
in 10
she 10
looked 10
sweetly 10
pretty 10
but 10
very 10
sad 10
and 10
her 10
eyes 10
were 10
flushed 10
with 10
crying 10
this 10
somehow 10
moved 10
me 10
much 10
of 10
late 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
cause 10
for 10
tears 10
god 10
knows 10
but 10
the 10
relief 10
of 10
them 10
was 10
denied 10
me 10
and 10
now 10
the 10
sight 10
of 10
those 10
sweet 10
eyes 10
brightened 10
by 10
recent 10
tears 10
went 10
straight 10
to 10
my 10
heart 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
as 10
gently 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
i 10
greatly 10
fear 10
i 10
have 10
distressed 10
you 10
oh 10
no 10
not 10
distressed 10
me 10
she 10
replied 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
more 10
touched 10
than 10
i 10
can 10
say 10
by 10
your 10
grief 10
that 10
is 10
a 10
wonderful 10
machine 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
cruelly 10
true 10
it 10
told 10
me 10
in 10
its 10
very 10
tones 10
the 10
anguish 10
of 10
your 10
heart 10
it 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
soul 10
crying 10
out 10
to 10
almighty 10
god 10
no 10
one 10
must 10
hear 10
them 10
spoken 10
ever 10
again 10
see 10
i 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
be 10
useful 10
i 10
have 10
copied 10
out 10
the 10
words 10
on 10
my 10
typewriter 10
and 10
none 10
other 10
need 10
now 10
hear 10
your 10
heart 10
beat 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
no 10
one 10
need 10
ever 10
know 10
shall 10
ever 10
know 10
i 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
low 10
voice 10
she 10
laid 10
her 10
hand 10
on 10
mine 10
and 10
said 10
very 10
gravely 10
ah 10
but 10
they 10
must 10
must 10
but 10
why 10
i 10
asked 10
because 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
terrible 10
story 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
poor 10
lucys 10
death 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
led 10
to 10
it 10
because 10
in 10
the 10
struggle 10
which 10
we 10
have 10
before 10
us 10
to 10
rid 10
the 10
earth 10
of 10
this 10
terrible 10
monster 10
we 10
must 10
have 10
all 10
the 10
knowledge 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
help 10
which 10
we 10
can 10
get 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
the 10
cylinders 10
which 10

me 10
to 10

lights 10

let 10
me 10
help 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
i 10
know 10
all 10
up 10
to 10
a 10
certain 10
point 10
and 10
i 10
see 10
already 10
though 10
your 10
diary 10
only 10
took 10
me 10
to 10
september 10
how 10
poor 10
lucy 10
was 10
beset 10
and 10
how 10
her 10
terrible 10
doom 10
was 10
being 10
wrought 10
out 10
jonathan 10

working 10
together 10
and 10
with 10
absolute 10
trust 10
we 10
can 10
surely 10
be 10
stronger 10
than 10
if 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
were 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
she 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
so 10
appealingly 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
manifested 10
such 10
courage 10
and 10
resolution 10
in 10
her 10
bearing 10
that 10

wrong 10
there 10
are 10
terrible 10
things 10
yet 10
to 10
learn 10
of 10
but 10
if 10
you 10
have 10
so 10
far 10
traveled 10
on 10
the 10
road 10
to 10
poor 10

for 10
what 10

before 10

a 10
cruel 10
and 10
dreadful 10

anything 10
which 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
understand 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
apparent 10
to 10
us 10
who 10
were 10
present 10
mina 10
harkers 10
journal 10
septemberafter 10
dinner 10
i 10
came 10
with 10
dr 10
seward 10
to 10
his 10
study 10
he 10
brought 10
back 10
the 10
phonograph 10
from 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
i 10
took 10
a 10
chair 10
and 10
arranged 10
the 10
phonograph 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
touch 10
it 10
without 10
getting 10
up 10
and 10
showed 10
me 10
how 10
to 10
stop 10
it 10
in 10
case 10
i 10
should 10
want 10
to 10
pause 10
then 10
he 10
very 10
thoughtfully 10
took 10
a 10
chair 10
with 10
his 10
back 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
might 10
be 10
as 10
free 10
as 10
possible 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
read 10
i 10
put 10
the 10
forked 10
metal 10
to 10
my 10
ears 10
and 10
listened 10
when 10
the 10
terrible 10
story 10
of 10
lucys 10
death 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
followed 10
was 10
done 10
i 10
lay 10
back 10
in 10
my 10
chair 10
powerless 10
fortunately 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
of 10
a 10
fainting 10
disposition 10
when 10
dr 10
seward 10
saw 10
me 10
he 10
jumped 10
up 10
with 10
a 10
horrified 10
exclamation 10
and 10
hurriedly 10
taking 10
a 10
case 10
bottle 10
from 10
the 10
cupboard 10
gave 10
me 10
some 10
brandy 10
which 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
somewhat 10
restored 10
me 10
my 10
brain 10
was 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
whirl 10
and 10
only 10
that 10
there 10
came 10
through 10
all 10
the 10
multitude 10
of 10
horrors 10
the 10
holy 10
ray 10
of 10
light 10
that 10
my 10
dear 10
lucy 10
was 10
at 10
last 10
at 10
peace 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
think 10
i 10
could 10
have 10
borne 10
it 10
without 10
making 10
a 10
scene 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
so 10
wild 10
and 10
mysterious 10
and 10
strange 10
that 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
known 10
jonathans 10
experience 10
in 10
transylvania 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
believed 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
i 10
didnt 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
believe 10
and 10
so 10
got 10
out 10
of 10
my 10
difficulty 10
by 10
attending 10
to 10
something 10
else 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
cover 10
off 10
my 10
typewriter 10
and 10
said 10
to 10
dr 10
seward 10
let 10
me 10
write 10
this 10
all 10
out 10
now 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
ready 10
for 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
when 10
he 10
comes 10
i 10
have 10
sent 10
a 10
telegram 10
to 10
jonathan 10
to 10
come 10
on 10
here 10
when 10
he 10
arrives 10
in 10
london 10
from 10
whitby 10
in 10
this 10
matter 10
dates 10
are 10
everything 10
and 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
if 10
we 10
get 10
all 10
of 10
our 10
material 10
ready 10
and 10
have 10
every 10
item 10
put 10
in 10
chronological 10
order 10
we 10
shall 10
have 10
done 10
much 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
that 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
mr 10
morris 10
are 10
coming 10
too 10
let 10
us 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
tell 10
them 10
when 10
they 10
come 10
he 10
accordingly 10
set 10
the 10
phonograph 10
at 10
a 10
slow 10
pace 10
and 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
typewrite 10
from 10
the 10
beginning 10
of 10
the 10
seventeenth 10
cylinder 10
i 10
used 10
manifold 10
and 10
so 10
took 10
three 10
copies 10
of 10
the 10
diary 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
done 10
with 10
the 10
rest 10
it 10
was 10
late 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
through 10
but 10
dr 10
seward 10
went 10
about 10
his 10
work 10
of 10
going 10
his 10
round 10
of 10
the 10
patients 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
finished 10
he 10
came 10
back 10
and 10
sat 10
near 10
me 10
reading 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
feel 10
too 10
lonely 10
whilst 10
i 10
worked 10
how 10
good 10
and 10
thoughtful 10
he 10
is 10
the 10
world 10
seems 10
full 10
of 10
good 10
men 10
even 10
if 10
there 10
are 10
monsters 10
in 10
it 10
before 10
i 10
left 10
him 10
i 10
remembered 10
what 10
jonathan 10
put 10
in 10
his 10
diary 10
of 10
the 10
professors 10
perturbation 10
at 10
reading 10
something 10
in 10
an 10
evening 10
paper 10
at 10
the 10
station 10
at 10
exeter 10
so 10
seeing 10
that 10
dr 10
seward 10
keeps 10
his 10
newspapers 10
i 10
borrowed 10
the 10
files 10
of 10
the 10
westminster 10
gazette 10
and 10
the 10
pall 10
mall 10
gazette 10
and 10
took 10
them 10
to 10
my 10
room 10
i 10
remember 10
how 10
much 10
the 10
dailygraph 10
and 10
the 10
whitby 10
gazette 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
made 10
cuttings 10
had 10
helped 10
us 10
to 10
understand 10
the 10
terrible 10
events 10
at 10
whitby 10
when 10
count 10
dracula 10
landed 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
look 10
through 10
the 10
evening 10
papers 10
since 10
then 10
and 10
perhaps 10
i 10
shall 10
get 10
some 10
new 10
light 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
sleepy 10
and 10
the 10
work 10
will 10
help 10
to 10
keep 10
me 10
quiet 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
septembermr 10
harker 10
arrived 10
at 10
nine 10
oclock 10
he 10
got 10
his 10
wifes 10
wire 10
just 10
before 10
starting 10
he 10
is 10
uncommonly 10
clever 10
if 10
one 10
can 10
judge 10
from 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
full 10
of 10
energy 10
if 10
this 10
journal 10
be 10
true 10
and 10
judging 10
by 10
ones 10
own 10
wonderful 10
experiences 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
he 10
is 10
also 10
a 10
man 10
of 10
great 10
nerve 10
that 10
going 10
down 10
to 10
the 10
vault 10
a 10
second 10
time 10
was 10
a 10
remarkable 10
piece 10
of 10
daring 10
after 10
reading 10
his 10
account 10
of 10
it 10
i 10
was 10
prepared 10
to 10
meet 10
a 10
good 10
specimen 10
of 10
manhood 10
but 10
hardly 10
the 10
quiet 10
businesslike 10
gentleman 10
who 10
came 10
here 10
today 10
laterafter 10
lunch 10
harker 10
and 10
his 10
wife 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
their 10
own 10
room 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
passed 10
a 10
while 10
ago 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
click 10
of 10
the 10
typewriter 10
they 10
are 10
hard 10
at 10
it 10
mrs 10
harker 10
says 10
that 10
knitting 10
together 10
in 10
chronological 10
order 10
every 10
scrap 10
of 10
evidence 10
they 10
have 10
harker 10
has 10
got 10
the 10
letters 10
between 10
the 10
consignee 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
at 10
whitby 10
and 10
the 10
carriers 10
in 10
london 10
who 10
took 10
charge 10
of 10
them 10
he 10
is 10
now 10
reading 10
his 10
wifes 10
transcript 10
of 10
my 10
diary 10
i 10
wonder 10
what 10
they 10
make 10
out 10
of 10
it 10
here 10
it 10
is 10
strange 10
that 10
it 10
never 10
struck 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
very 10
next 10
house 10
might 10
be 10
the 10
counts 10
hiding 10
place 10
goodness 10
knows 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
enough 10
clues 10
from 10
the 10
conduct 10
of 10
the 10
patient 10
renfield 10
the 10
bundle 10
of 10
letters 10
relating 10
to 10
the 10
purchase 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
were 10
with 10
the 10
transcript 10
oh 10
if 10
we 10
had 10
only 10
had 10
them 10
earlier 10
we 10
might 10
have 10
saved 10
poor 10
lucy 10
stop 10
that 10
way 10
madness 10
lies 10
harker 10
has 10
gone 10
back 10
and 10
is 10
again 10
collecting 10
material 10
he 10
says 10
that 10
by 10
dinner 10
time 10
they 10
will 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
show 10
a 10
whole 10
connected 10
narrative 10
he 10
thinks 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
i 10
should 10
see 10
renfield 10
as 10
hitherto 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
index 10
to 10
the 10
coming 10
and 10
going 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
i 10
hardly 10
see 10
this 10
yet 10
but 10
when 10
i 10
get 10
at 10
the 10
dates 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
shall 10

a 10
good 10
thing 10
that 10
mrs 10
harker 10
put 10
my 10
cylinders 10
into 10
type 10
we 10
never 10
could 10
have 10
found 10
the 10
dates 10
otherwise 10
i 10
found 10
renfield 10
sitting 10
placidly 10
in 10
his 10
room 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
folded 10
smiling 10
benignly 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
he 10
seemed 10
as 10
sane 10
as 10
any 10
one 10
i 10
ever 10
saw 10
i 10
sat 10
down 10
and 10
talked 10
with 10
him 10
on 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
subjects 10
all 10
of 10
which 10
he 10
treated 10
naturally 10
he 10
then 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
accord 10
spoke 10
of 10
going 10
home 10
a 10
subject 10
he 10
has 10
never 10
mentioned 10
to 10
my 10
knowledge 10
during 10
his 10
sojourn 10
here 10
in 10
fact 10
he 10
spoke 10
quite 10
confidently 10
of 10
getting 10
his 10
discharge 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
believe 10
that 10
had 10
i 10
not 10
had 10
the 10
chat 10
with 10
harker 10
and 10
read 10
the 10
letters 10
and 10
the 10
dates 10
of 10
his 10
outbursts 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
prepared 10
to 10
sign 10
for 10
him 10
after 10
a 10
brief 10
time 10
of 10
observation 10
as 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
am 10
darkly 10
suspicious 10
all 10
those 10
outbreaks 10
were 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
linked 10
with 10
the 10
proximity 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
what 10
then 10
does 10
this 10
absolute 10
content 10
mean 10
can 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
his 10
instinct 10
is 10
satisfied 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
vampires 10
ultimate 10
triumph 10
stay 10
he 10
is 10
himself 10
zoophagous 10
and 10
in 10
his 10
wild 10
ravings 10
outside 10
the 10
chapel 10
door 10
of 10
the 10
deserted 10
house 10
he 10
always 10
spoke 10
of 10
master 10
this 10
all 10
seems 10
confirmation 10
of 10
our 10
idea 10
however 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
my 10
friend 10
is 10
just 10
a 10
little 10
too 10
sane 10
at 10
present 10
to 10
make 10
it 10
safe 10
to 10
probe 10
him 10
too 10
deep 10
with 10
questions 10
he 10
might 10
begin 10
to 10
think 10
and 10
then 10
so 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
i 10
mistrust 10
these 10
quiet 10
moods 10
of 10
of 10
his 10
so 10
i 10
have 10
given 10
the 10
attendant 10
a 10
hint 10
to 10
look 10
closely 10
after 10
him 10
and 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
ready 10
in 10
case 10
of 10

met 10
me 10
at 10
the 10

brought 10
me 10
to 10
his 10
fathers 10
house 10
where 10
they 10
had 10
decided 10

everything 10

him 10
to 10
do 10
as 10
he 10
likes 10
they 10
all 10
knew 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
busy 10
and 10
that 10
my 10
stay 10
was 10
short 10
and 10
mr 10
billington 10
had 10
ready 10
in 10
his 10
office 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
concerning 10
the 10
consignment 10
of 10
boxes 10
it 10
gave 10
me 10
almost 10
a 10
turn 10
to 10
see 10
again 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
letters 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
on 10
the 10
counts 10
table 10
before 10
i 10
knew 10
of 10
his 10
diabolical 10
plans 10
everything 10
had 10
been 10
carefully 10
thought 10
out 10
and 10
done 10
systematically 10
and 10
with 10
precision 10
he 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
been 10
prepared 10
for 10
every 10
obstacle 10
which 10
might 10
be 10
placed 10
by 10
accident 10
in 10
the 10
way 10
of 10
his 10
intentions 10
being 10
carried 10
out 10
to 10
use 10
and 10
americanism 10
he 10
had 10
taken 10
no 10
chances 10
and 10
the 10
absolute 10
accuracy 10
with 10
which 10
his 10
instructions 10
were 10
fulfilled 10
was 10
simply 10
the 10
logical 10
result 10
of 10
his 10
care 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
invoice 10
and 10
took 10
note 10
of 10
itfifty 10
cases 10
of 10
common 10
earth 10
to 10
be 10
used 10
for 10
experimental 10
purposes 10
also 10
the 10
copy 10
of 10
the 10
letter 10
to 10
carter 10
paterson 10
and 10
their 10
reply 10
of 10
both 10
these 10
i 10
got 10
copies 10
this 10
was 10
all 10
the 10
information 10
mr 10
billington 10
could 10
give 10
me 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
down 10
to 10
the 10
port 10
and 10
saw 10
the 10
coastguards 10
the 10
customs 10
officers 10
and 10
the 10
harbor 10
master 10
who 10
kindly 10
put 10
me 10
in 10
communication 10
with 10
the 10
men 10
who 10
had 10
actually 10
received 10
the 10
boxes 10
their 10
tally 10
was 10
exact 10
with 10
the 10
list 10
and 10
they 10
had 10
nothing 10
to 10
add 10
to 10
the 10
simple 10
description 10
fifty 10
cases 10
of 10
common 10
earth 10
except 10
that 10
the 10
boxes 10
were 10
main 10
and 10
mortal 10
heavy 10
and 10
that 10
shifting 10
them 10
was 10
dry 10
work 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
added 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
lines 10
that 10
there 10
wasnt 10
any 10
gentleman 10
such 10
like 10
as 10
like 10
yourself 10
squire 10
to 10
show 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
appreciation 10
of 10
their 10
efforts 10
in 10
a 10
liquid 10
form 10
another 10
put 10
in 10
a 10
rider 10
that 10
the 10
thirst 10
then 10
generated 10
was 10
such 10
that 10
even 10
the 10
time 10
which 10
had 10
elapsed 10
had 10
not 10
completely 10
allayed 10
it 10
needless 10
to 10
add 10
i 10
took 10
care 10
before 10
leaving 10
to 10
lift 10
forever 10
and 10
adequately 10
this 10
source 10
of 10
reproach 10
septemberthe 10
station 10
master 10
was 10
good 10
enough 10
to 10
give 10
me 10
a 10
line 10
to 10
his 10
old 10
companion 10
the 10
station 10
master 10
at 10
kings 10
cross 10
so 10
that 10
when 10
i 10
arrived 10
there 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
i 10
was 10
able 10
to 10
ask 10
him 10
about 10
the 10
arrival 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
he 10
too 10
put 10
me 10
at 10
once 10
in 10
communication 10
with 10
the 10
proper 10
officials 10
and 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
their 10
tally 10
was 10
correct 10
with 10
the 10
original 10
invoice 10
the 10
opportunities 10
of 10
acquiring 10
an 10
abnormal 10
thirst 10
had 10
been 10
here 10
limited 10
a 10
noble 10
use 10
of 10
them 10
had 10
however 10
been 10
made 10
and 10
again 10
i 10
was 10
compelled 10
to 10
deal 10
with 10
the 10
result 10
in 10
ex 10
post 10
facto 10
manner 10
from 10
thence 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
carter 10
patersons 10
central 10
office 10
where 10
i 10
met 10
with 10
the 10
utmost 10
courtesy 10
they 10
looked 10
up 10
the 10
transaction 10
in 10
their 10
day 10
book 10
and 10
letter 10
book 10
and 10
at 10
once 10
telephoned 10
to 10
their 10
kings 10
cross 10
office 10
for 10
more 10
details 10
by 10
good 10
fortune 10
the 10
men 10
who 10
did 10
the 10
teaming 10
were 10
waiting 10
for 10
work 10
and 10
the 10
official 10
at 10
once 10
sent 10
them 10
over 10
sending 10
also 10
by 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
the 10
waybill 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
connected 10
with 10
the 10
delivery 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
at 10
carfax 10
here 10
again 10
i 10
found 10
the 10
tally 10
agreeing 10
exactly 10
the 10
carriers 10
men 10
were 10
able 10
to 10
supplement 10
the 10
paucity 10
of 10
the 10
written 10
words 10
with 10
a 10
few 10
more 10
details 10
these 10
were 10
i 10
shortly 10
found 10
connected 10
almost 10
solely 10
with 10
the 10
dusty 10
nature 10
of 10
the 10
job 10
and 10
the 10
consequent 10
thirst 10
engendered 10
in 10
the 10
operators 10
on 10
my 10
affording 10
an 10
opportunity 10
through 10
the 10
medium 10
of 10
the 10
currency 10
of 10

know 10
how 10
to 10
contain 10
myself 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
suppose 10
the 10
reaction 10
from 10
the 10
haunting 10
fear 10
which 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
that 10
this 10
terrible 10
affair 10
and 10
the 10
reopening 10
of 10
his 10
old 10
wound 10
might 10
act 10
detrimentally 10
on 10
jonathan 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
leave 10
for 10
whitby 10
with 10
as 10
brave 10
a 10
face 10
as 10
could 10
but 10
i 10
was 10
sick 10
with 10
apprehension 10
the 10
effort 10
has 10
however 10
done 10
him 10
good 10
he 10
was 10
never 10
so 10
resolute 10
never 10
so 10
strong 10
never 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
volcanic 10
energy 10
as 10
at 10
present 10
it 10
is 10
just 10
as 10
that 10
dear 10
good 10
professor 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
he 10
is 10
true 10
grit 10
and 10
he 10
improves 10
under 10
strain 10
that 10
would 10
kill 10
a 10
weaker 10
nature 10
he 10
came 10
back 10
full 10
of 10
life 10
and 10
hope 10
and 10
determination 10
we 10
have 10
got 10
everything 10
in 10
order 10
for 10
tonight 10
i 10
feel 10
myself 10
quite 10
wild 10
with 10
excitement 10
i 10
suppose 10
one 10
ought 10
to 10
pity 10
anything 10
so 10
hunted 10
as 10
the 10
count 10
that 10
is 10
just 10
it 10
this 10
thing 10
is 10
not 10
human 10
not 10
even 10
a 10
beast 10
to 10
read 10
dr 10
sewards 10
account 10
of 10
poor 10
lucys 10
death 10
and 10
what 10
followed 10
is 10
enough 10
to 10
dry 10
up 10
the 10
springs 10
of 10
pity 10
in 10
ones 10
heart 10
laterlord 10
godalming 10
and 10
mr 10
morris 10
arrived 10
earlier 10
than 10
we 10
expected 10
dr 10
seward 10
was 10
out 10
on 10
business 10
and 10
had 10
taken 10
jonathan 10
with 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
see 10
them 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
me 10
a 10
painful 10
meeting 10
for 10
it 10
brought 10
back 10
all 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucys 10
hopes 10
of 10
only 10
a 10
few 10
months 10
ago 10
of 10
course 10
they 10
had 10
heard 10
lucy 10
speak 10
of 10
me 10
and 10
it 10
seemed 10
that 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
too 10
had 10
been 10
quite 10
blowing 10
my 10
trumpet 10
as 10
mr 10
morris 10
expressed 10
it 10
poor 10
fellows 10
neither 10
of 10
them 10
is 10
aware 10
that 10
i 10
know 10
all 10
about 10
the 10
proposals 10
they 10
made 10
to 10
lucy 10
they 10
did 10
not 10
quite 10
know 10
what 10
to 10
say 10
or 10
do 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
ignorant 10
of 10
the 10
amount 10
of 10
my 10
knowledge 10
so 10
they 10
had 10
to 10
keep 10
on 10
neutral 10
subjects 10
however 10
i 10
thought 10
the 10
matter 10
over 10
and 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
conclusion 10
that 10
the 10
best 10
thing 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
would 10
be 10
to 10
post 10
them 10
on 10
affairs 10
right 10
up 10
to 10
date 10
i 10
knew 10
from 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
that 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
at 10
lucys 10
death 10
her 10
real 10
death 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
need 10
not 10
fear 10
to 10
betray 10
any 10
secret 10
before 10
the 10
time 10
so 10
i 10
told 10
them 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
read 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
and 10
diaries 10
and 10
that 10
my 10
husband 10
and 10
i 10
having 10
typewritten 10
them 10
had 10
just 10
finished 10
putting 10
them 10
in 10
order 10
i 10
gave 10
them 10
each 10
a 10
copy 10
to 10
read 10
in 10
the 10
library 10
when 10
lord 10
godalming 10
got 10
his 10
and 10
turned 10
it 10
over 10
it 10
does 10
make 10
a 10
pretty 10
good 10
pile 10
he 10
said 10
did 10
you 10
write 10
all 10
this 10
mrs 10
harker 10
i 10
nodded 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
dont 10
quite 10
see 10
the 10
drift 10
of 10
it 10
but 10
you 10
people 10
are 10
all 10
so 10
good 10
and 10
kind 10
and 10
have 10
been 10
working 10
so 10
earnestly 10
and 10
so 10
energetically 10
that 10
all 10
i 10
can 10
do 10
is 10
to 10
accept 10
your 10
ideas 10
blindfold 10
and 10
try 10
to 10
help 10
you 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
one 10
lesson 10
already 10
in 10
accepting 10
facts 10
that 10
should 10
make 10
a 10
man 10
humble 10
to 10
the 10
last 10
hour 10
of 10
his 10
life 10
besides 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
loved 10
my 10
lucy 10
here 10
he 10
turned 10
away 10
and 10
covered 10
his 10
face 10
with 10
his 10
hands 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
tears 10
in 10
his 10
voice 10
mr 10
morris 10
with 10
instinctive 10
delicacy 10
just 10
laid 10
a 10
hand 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
on 10
his 10
shoulder 10
and 10
then 10
walked 10
quietly 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
suppose 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
in 10
a 10
womans 10
nature 10
that 10
makes 10
a 10
man 10
free 10
to 10
break 10
down 10
before 10
her 10
and 10
express 10
his 10
feelings 10
on 10
the 10
tender 10
or 10
emotional 10
side 10
without 10
feeling 10
it 10
derogatory 10
to 10
his 10
manhood 10
for 10
when 10
lord 10
godalming 10
found 10
himself 10
alone 10
with 10
me 10
he 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
and 10
gave 10
way 10
utterly 10
and 10
openly 10
i 10
sat 10
down 10
beside 10
him 10
and 10
took 10
his 10
hand 10
i 10
hope 10
he 10
didnt 10
think 10
it 10
forward 10
of 10
me 10
and 10
that 10
if 10
her 10
ever 10
thinks 10
of 10
it 10
afterwards 10
he 10
never 10
will 10
have 10
such 10
a 10
thought 10
there 10
i 10
wrong 10
him 10
i 10
know 10
he 10
never 10
will 10
he 10
is 10
too 10
true 10
a 10
gentleman 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
his 10
heart 10
was 10
breaking 10
i 10
loved 10
dear 10
lucy 10
and 10
i 10
know 10
what 10
she 10
was 10
to 10
you 10
and 10
what 10
you 10
were 10
to 10
her 10
she 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
like 10
sisters 10
and 10
now 10
she 10
is 10
gone 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
like 10
a 10
sister 10
to 10
you 10
in 10
your 10
trouble 10
i 10
know 10
what 10
sorrows 10
you 10
have 10
had 10
though 10
i 10
cannot 10
measure 10
the 10
depth 10
of 10
them 10
if 10
sympathy 10
and 10
pity 10
can 10
help 10
in 10
your 10
affliction 10
wont 10
you 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
of 10
some 10
little 10
service 10
for 10
lucys 10
sake 10
in 10
an 10
instant 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
fellow 10
was 10
overwhelmed 10
with 10
grief 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
all 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
of 10
late 10
been 10
suffering 10
in 10
silence 10
found 10
a 10
vent 10
at 10
once 10
he 10
grew 10
quite 10
hysterical 10
and 10
raising 10
his 10
open 10
hands 10
beat 10
his 10
palms 10
together 10
in 10
a 10
perfect 10
agony 10
of 10
grief 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
then 10
sat 10
down 10
again 10
and 10
the 10
tears 10
rained 10
down 10
his 10
cheeks 10
i 10
felt 10
an 10
infinite 10
pity 10
for 10
him 10
and 10
opened 10
my 10
arms 10
unthinkingly 10
with 10
a 10
sob 10
he 10
laid 10
his 10
head 10
on 10
my 10
shoulder 10
and 10
cried 10
like 10
a 10
wearied 10
child 10
whilst 10
he 10
shook 10
with 10
emotion 10
we 10
women 10
have 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
mother 10
in 10
us 10
that 10
makes 10
us 10
rise 10
above 10
smaller 10
matters 10
when 10
the 10
mother 10
spirit 10
is 10
invoked 10
i 10
felt 10
this 10
big 10
sorrowing 10
mans 10
head 10
resting 10
on 10
me 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
were 10
that 10
of 10
a 10
baby 10
that 10
some 10
day 10
may 10
lie 10
on 10
my 10
bosom 10
and 10
i 10
stroked 10
his 10
hair 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
were 10
my 10
own 10
child 10
i 10
never 10
thought 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
how 10
strange 10
it 10
all 10
was 10
after 10
a 10
little 10
bit 10
his 10
sobs 10
ceased 10
and 10
he 10
raised 10
himself 10
with 10
an 10
apology 10
though 10
he 10
made 10
no 10
disguise 10
of 10
his 10
emotion 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
for 10
days 10
and 10
nights 10
past 10
weary 10
days 10
and 10
sleepless 10
nights 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
unable 10
to 10
speak 10
with 10
any 10
one 10
as 10
a 10
man 10
must 10
speak 10
in 10
his 10
time 10
of 10
sorrow 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
woman 10
whose 10
sympathy 10
could 10
be 10
given 10
to 10
him 10
or 10
with 10
whom 10
owing 10
to 10
the 10
terrible 10
circumstance 10
with 10
which 10
his 10
sorrow 10
was 10
surrounded 10
he 10
could 10
speak 10
freely 10
i 10
know 10
now 10
how 10
i 10
suffered 10
he 10
said 10
as 10
he 10
dried 10
his 10
eyes 10
but 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
even 10
yet 10
and 10
none 10
other 10
can 10
ever 10
know 10
how 10
much 10
your 10
sweet 10
sympathy 10
has 10
been 10
to 10
me 10
today 10
i 10
shall 10
know 10
better 10
in 10
time 10
and 10
believe 10
me 10
that 10
though 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
ungrateful 10
now 10
my 10
gratitude 10
will 10
grow 10
with 10
my 10
understanding 10
you 10
will 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
like 10
a 10
brother 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
for 10
all 10
our 10
lives 10
for 10
dear 10
lucys 10
sake 10
for 10
dear 10
lucys 10
sake 10
i 10
said 10
as 10
we 10
clasped 10
handsay 10
and 10
for 10
your 10
own 10
sake 10
he 10
added 10
for 10
if 10
a 10
mans 10
esteem 10
and 10
gratitude 10
are 10
ever 10
worth 10
the 10
winning 10
you 10
have 10
won 10
mine 10
today 10
if 10
ever 10
the 10
future 10
should 10
bring 10
to 10
you 10
a 10
time 10
when 10
you 10
need 10
a 10
mans 10
help 10
believe 10
me 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
call 10
in 10
vain 10
god 10
grant 10
that 10
no 10
such 10
time 10
may 10
ever 10
come 10
to 10
you 10
to 10
break 10
the 10
sunshine 10
of 10
your 10
life 10
but 10
if 10
it 10
should 10
ever 10
come 10
promise 10
me 10
that 10
you 10
will 10
let 10
me 10
know 10
he 10
was 10
so 10
earnest 10
and 10
his 10
sorrow 10
was 10
so 10
fresh 10
that 10
i 10
felt 10
it 10
would 10
comfort 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
promise 10
as 10
i 10
came 10
along 10
the 10
corridor 10
i 10
say 10
mr 10
morris 10
looking 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
window 10
he 10
turned 10
as 10
he 10
heard 10
my 10
footsteps 10
how 10
is 10
art 10
he 10
said 10
then 10
noticing 10
my 10
red 10
eyes 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
ah 10
i 10
see 10
you 10
have 10
been 10
comforting 10
him 10
poor 10
old 10
fellow 10
he 10
needs 10
it 10
no 10
one 10
but 10
a 10
woman 10
can 10
help 10
a 10
man 10
when 10
he 10
is 10
in 10
trouble 10
of 10
the 10
heart 10
and 10
he 10
had 10
no 10
one 10
to 10
comfort 10
him 10
he 10
bore 10
his 10
own 10
trouble 10
so 10
bravely 10
that 10
my 10
heart 10
bled 10
for 10
him 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
manuscript 10
in 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
when 10
he 10
read 10
it 10
he 10
would 10
realize 10
how 10
much 10
i 10
knew 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
i 10
wish 10
i 10
could 10
comfort 10
all 10
who 10
suffer 10
from 10
the 10
heart 10
will 10
you 10
let 10
me 10
be 10
your 10
friend 10
and 10
will 10
you 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
comfort 10
if 10
you 10
need 10
it 10
you 10
will 10
know 10
later 10
why 10
i 10
speak 10
he 10
saw 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
earnest 10
and 10
stooping 10
took 10
my 10
hand 10
and 10
raising 10
it 10
to 10
his 10
lips 10
kissed 10
it 10
it 10
seemed 10
but 10
poor 10
comfort 10
to 10
so 10
brave 10
and 10
unselfish 10
a 10
soul 10
and 10
impulsively 10
i 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
kissed 10
him 10
the 10
tears 10
rose 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
momentary 10
choking 10
in 10
his 10
throat 10
he 10
said 10
quite 10
calmly 10
little 10
girl 10
you 10
will 10
never 10
forget 10
that 10
true 10
hearted 10
kindness 10
so 10
long 10
as 10
ever 10
you 10
live 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
study 10
to 10
his 10
friend 10
little 10
girl 10
the 10
very 10
words 10
he 10
had 10
used 10
to 10
lucy 10
and 10
oh 10
but 10
he 10
proved 10
himself 10
a 10
friend 10

and 10
morris 10
had 10
not 10
only 10
arrived 10
but 10
had 10
already 10
studied 10
the 10
transcript 10
of 10
the 10
various 10
diaries 10
and 10
letters 10
which 10
harker 10
had 10
not 10
yet 10
returned 10
from 10
his 10
visit 10
to 10
the 10
carriers 10
men 10
of 10
whom 10
dr 10
hennessey 10
had 10
written 10
to 10
me 10
mrs 10
harker 10
gave 10
us 10
a 10
cup 10
of 10
tea 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
honestly 10
say 10
that 10
for 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
since 10
i 10
have 10
lived 10
in 10
it 10
this 10
old 10
house 10
seemed 10
like 10
home 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
finished 10
mrs 10
harker 10
said 10
dr 10
seward 10
may 10
i 10
ask 10
a 10
favor 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
see 10
your 10
patient 10
mr 10
renfield 10
do 10
let 10
me 10
see 10
him 10
what 10
you 10
have 10
said 10
of 10
him 10
in 10
your 10
diary 10
interests 10
me 10
so 10
much 10
she 10
looked 10
so 10
appealing 10
and 10
so 10
pretty 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
refuse 10
her 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
possible 10
reason 10
why 10
i 10
should 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
her 10
with 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
told 10
the 10
man 10
that 10
a 10
lady 10
would 10
like 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
to 10
which 10
he 10
simply 10
answered 10
why 10
she 10
is 10
going 10
through 10
the 10
house 10
and 10
wants 10
to 10
see 10
every 10
one 10
in 10
it 10
i 10
answered 10
oh 10
very 10
well 10
he 10
said 10
let 10
her 10
come 10
in 10
by 10
all 10
means 10
but 10
just 10
wait 10
a 10
minute 10
till 10
i 10
tidy 10
up 10
the 10
place 10
his 10
method 10
of 10
tidying 10
was 10
peculiar 10
he 10
simply 10
swallowed 10
all 10
the 10
flies 10
and 10
spiders 10
in 10
the 10
boxes 10
before 10
i 10
could 10
stop 10
him 10
it 10
was 10
quite 10
evident 10
that 10
he 10
feared 10
or 10
was 10
jealous 10
of 10
some 10
interference 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
got 10
through 10
his 10
disgusting 10
task 10
he 10
said 10
cheerfully 10
let 10
the 10
lady 10
come 10
in 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
his 10
bed 10
with 10
his 10
head 10
down 10
but 10
with 10
his 10
eyelids 10
raised 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
see 10
her 10
as 10
she 10
entered 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
some 10
homicidal 10
intent 10
i 10
remembered 10
how 10
quiet 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
just 10
before 10
he 10
attacked 10
me 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
study 10
and 10
i 10
took 10
care 10
to 10
stand 10
where 10
i 10
could 10
seize 10
him 10
at 10
once 10
if 10
he 10
attempted 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
spring 10
at 10
her 10
she 10
came 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
with 10
an 10
easy 10
gracefulness 10
which 10
would 10
at 10
once 10
command 10
the 10
respect 10
of 10
any 10
lunatic 10
for 10
easiness 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
qualities 10
mad 10
people 10
most 10
respect 10
she 10
walked 10
over 10
to 10
him 10
smiling 10
pleasantly 10
and 10
held 10
out 10
her 10
hand 10
good 10
evening 10
mr 10
renfield 10
said 10
she 10
you 10
see 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
for 10
dr 10
seward 10
has 10
told 10
me 10
of 10
you 10
he 10
made 10
no 10
immediate 10
reply 10
but 10
eyed 10
her 10
all 10
over 10
intently 10
with 10
a 10
set 10
frown 10
on 10
his 10
face 10
this 10
look 10
gave 10
way 10
to 10
one 10
of 10
wonder 10
which 10
merged 10
in 10
doubt 10
then 10
to 10
my 10
intense 10
astonishment 10
he 10
said 10
youre 10
not 10
the 10
girl 10
the 10
doctor 10
wanted 10
to 10
marry 10
are 10
you 10
you 10
cant 10
be 10
you 10
know 10
for 10
shes 10
dead 10
mrs 10
harker 10
smiled 10
sweetly 10
as 10
she 10
replied 10
oh 10
no 10
i 10
have 10
a 10
husband 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
to 10
whom 10
i 10
was 10
married 10
before 10
i 10
ever 10
saw 10
dr 10
seward 10
or 10
he 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
mrs 10
harker 10
then 10
what 10
are 10
you 10
doing 10
here 10
my 10
husband 10
and 10
i 10
are 10
staying 10
on 10
a 10
visit 10
with 10
dr 10
seward 10
then 10
dont 10
stay 10
but 10
why 10
not 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
this 10
style 10
of 10
conversation 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
pleasant 10
to 10
mrs 10
harker 10
any 10
more 10
than 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
i 10
joined 10
in 10
how 10
did 10
you 10
know 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
marry 10
anyone 10
his 10
reply 10
was 10
simply 10
contemptuous 10
given 10
in 10
a 10
pause 10
in 10
which 10
he 10
turned 10
his 10
eyes 10
from 10
mrs 10
harker 10
to 10
me 10
instantly 10
turning 10
them 10
back 10
again 10
what 10
an 10
asinine 10
question 10
i 10
dont 10
see 10
that 10
at 10
all 10
mr 10
renfield 10
said 10
mrs 10
harker 10
at 10
once 10
championing 10
me 10
he 10
replied 10
to 10
her 10
with 10
as 10
much 10
courtesy 10
and 10
respect 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
shown 10
contempt 10
to 10
me 10
you 10
will 10
of 10
course 10
understand 10
mrs 10
harker 10
that 10
when 10
a 10
man 10
is 10
so 10
loved 10
and 10
honored 10
as 10
our 10
host 10
is 10
everything 10
regarding 10
him 10
is 10
of 10
interest 10
in 10
our 10
little 10
community 10
dr 10
seward 10
is 10
loved 10
not 10
only 10
by 10
his 10
household 10
and 10
his 10
friends 10
but 10
even 10
by 10
his 10
patients 10
who 10
being 10
some 10
of 10
them 10
hardly 10
in 10
mental 10
equilibrium 10
are 10
apt 10
to 10
distort 10
causes 10
and 10
effects 10
since 10
i 10
myself 10
have 10
been 10
an 10
inmate 10
of 10
a 10
lunatic 10
asylum 10
i 10
cannot 10
but 10
notice 10
that 10
the 10
sophistic 10
tendencies 10
of 10
some 10
of 10
its 10
inmates 10
lean 10
towards 10
the 10
errors 10
of 10
non 10
causa 10
and 10
ignoratio 10
elenche 10
i 10
positively 10
opened 10
my 10
eyes 10
at 10
this 10
new 10
development 10
here 10
was 10
my 10
own 10
pet 10
lunatic 10
the 10
most 10
pronounced 10
of 10
his 10
type 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
ever 10
met 10
with 10
talking 10
elemental 10
philosophy 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
manner 10
of 10
a 10
polished 10
gentleman 10
i 10
wonder 10
if 10
it 10
was 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
presence 10
which 10
had 10
touched 10
some 10
chord 10
in 10
his 10
memory 10
if 10
this 10
new 10
phase 10
was 10
spontaneous 10
or 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
due 10
to 10
her 10
unconscious 10
influence 10
she 10
must 10
have 10
some 10
rare 10
gift 10
or 10
power 10
we 10
continued 10
to 10
talk 10
for 10
some 10
time 10
and 10
seeing 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
seemingly 10
quite 10
reasonable 10
she 10
ventured 10
looking 10
at 10
me 10
questioningly 10
as 10
she 10
began 10
to 10
lead 10
him 10
to 10
his 10
favorite 10
topic 10
i 10
was 10
again 10
astonished 10
for 10
he 10
addressed 10
himself 10
to 10
the 10
question 10
with 10
the 10
impartiality 10
of 10
the 10
completest 10
sanity 10
he 10
even 10
took 10
himself 10
as 10
an 10
example 10
when 10
he 10
mentioned 10
certain 10
things 10
why 10
i 10
myself 10
am 10
an 10
instance 10
of 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
had 10
a 10
strange 10
belief 10
indeed 10
it 10
was 10
no 10
wonder 10
that 10
my 10
friends 10
were 10
alarmed 10
and 10
insisted 10
on 10
my 10
being 10
put 10
under 10
control 10
i 10
used 10
to 10
fancy 10
that 10
life 10
was 10
a 10
positive 10
and 10
perpetual 10
entity 10
and 10
that 10
by 10
consuming 10
a 10
multitude 10
of 10
live 10
things 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
low 10
in 10
the 10
scale 10
of 10
creation 10
one 10
might 10
indefinitely 10
prolong 10
life 10
at 10
times 10
i 10
held 10
the 10
belief 10
so 10
strongly 10
that 10
i 10
actually 10
tried 10
to 10
take 10
human 10
life 10
the 10
doctor 10
here 10
will 10
bear 10
me 10
out 10
that 10
on 10
one 10
occasion 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
kill 10
him 10
for 10
the 10
purpose 10
of 10
strengthening 10
my 10
vital 10
powers 10
by 10
the 10
assimilation 10
with 10
my 10
own 10
body 10
of 10
his 10
life 10
through 10
the 10
medium 10
of 10
his 10
blood 10
relying 10
of 10
course 10
upon 10
the 10
scriptural 10
phrase 10
for 10
the 10
blood 10
is 10
the 10
life 10
though 10
indeed 10
the 10
vendor 10
of 10
a 10
certain 10
nostrum 10
has 10
vulgarized 10
the 10
truism 10
to 10
the 10
very 10
point 10
of 10
contempt 10
isnt 10
that 10
true 10
doctor 10
i 10
nodded 10
assent 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
so 10
amazed 10
that 10
i 10
hardly 10
knew 10
what 10
to 10
either 10
think 10
or 10
say 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
to 10
imagine 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
eat 10
up 10
his 10
spiders 10
and 10
flies 10
not 10
five 10
minutes 10
before 10
looking 10
at 10
my 10
watch 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
go 10
to 10
the 10
station 10
to 10
meet 10
van 10
helsing 10
so 10
i 10
told 10
mrs 10
harker 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
time 10
to 10
leave 10
she 10
came 10
at 10
once 10
after 10
saying 10
pleasantly 10
to 10
mr 10
renfield 10
goodbye 10
and 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
may 10
see 10
you 10
often 10
under 10
auspices 10
pleasanter 10
to 10
yourself 10
to 10
which 10
to 10
my 10
astonishment 10
he 10
replied 10
goodbye 10
my 10
dear 10
i 10
pray 10
god 10
i 10
may 10
never 10

sweet 10
face 10
again 10
may 10
he 10
bless 10
and 10
keep 10
you 10
when 10
i 10

to 10
the 10

long 10
day 10
van 10
helsing 10
stepped 10
from 10
the 10
carriage 10
with 10
the 10
eager 10
nimbleness 10
of 10
a 10
boy 10
he 10
saw 10
me 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
rushed 10
up 10

wonderful 10
madam 10
mina 10
she 10
has 10
mans 10
brain 10
a 10
brain 10
that 10
a 10
man 10

have 10
were 10
he 10
much 10
gifted 10
and 10
a 10
womans 10
heart 10
the 10
good 10
god 10
fashioned 10
her 10
for 10
a 10
purpose 10
believe 10
me 10
when 10
he 10
made 10
that 10
so 10
good 10
combination 10
friend 10
john 10
up 10
to 10
now 10
fortune 10
has 10
made 10
that 10
woman 10
of 10
help 10
to 10
us 10
after 10
tonight 10
she 10
must 10
not 10
have 10
to 10
do 10
with 10
this 10
so 10
terrible 10
affair 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
good 10
that 10
she 10
run 10
a 10
risk 10
so 10
great 10
we 10
men 10
are 10
determined 10
nay 10
are 10
we 10
not 10
pledged 10
to 10
destroy 10
this 10
monster 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
part 10
for 10
a 10
woman 10
even 10
if 10
she 10
be 10
not 10
harmed 10
her 10
heart 10
may 10
fail 10
her 10
in 10
so 10
much 10
and 10
so 10
many 10
horrors 10
and 10
hereafter 10
she 10
may 10
suffer 10
both 10
in 10
waking 10
from 10
her 10
nerves 10
and 10
in 10
sleep 10
from 10
her 10
dreams 10
and 10
besides 10
she 10
is 10
young 10
woman 10
and 10
not 10
so 10
long 10
married 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
other 10
things 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
some 10
time 10
if 10
not 10
now 10
you 10
tell 10
me 10
she 10
has 10
wrote 10
all 10
then 10
she 10
must 10
consult 10
with 10
us 10
but 10
tomorrow 10
she 10
say 10
goodbye 10
to 10
this 10
work 10
and 10
we 10
go 10
alone 10
i 10
agreed 10
heartily 10
with 10
him 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
what 10
we 10
had 10
found 10
in 10
his 10
absence 10
that 10
the 10
house 10
which 10
dracula 10
had 10
bought 10
was 10
the 10
very 10
next 10
one 10
to 10
my 10
own 10
he 10
was 10
amazed 10
and 10
a 10
great 10
concern 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
on 10
him 10
oh 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
known 10
it 10
before 10
he 10
said 10
for 10
then 10
we 10
might 10
have 10
reached 10
him 10
in 10
time 10
to 10
save 10
poor 10
lucy 10
however 10
the 10
milk 10
that 10
is 10
spilt 10
cries 10
not 10
out 10
afterwardsas 10
you 10
say 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
think 10
of 10
that 10
but 10
go 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
end 10
then 10
he 10
fell 10
into 10
a 10
silence 10
that 10
lasted 10
till 10
we 10
entered 10
my 10
own 10
gateway 10
before 10
we 10
went 10
to 10
prepare 10
for 10
dinner 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
mrs 10
harker 10
i 10
am 10
told 10
madam 10
mina 10
by 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
that 10
you 10
and 10
your 10
husband 10
have 10
put 10
up 10
in 10
exact 10
order 10
all 10
things 10
that 10
have 10
been 10
up 10
to 10
this 10
moment 10
not 10
up 10
to 10
this 10
moment 10
professor 10
she 10
said 10
impulsively 10
but 10
up 10
to 10
this 10
morning 10
but 10
why 10
not 10
up 10
to 10
now 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
hitherto 10
how 10
good 10
light 10
all 10
the 10
little 10
things 10
have 10
made 10
we 10
have 10
told 10
our 10
secrets 10
and 10
yet 10
no 10
one 10
who 10
has 10
told 10
is 10
the 10
worse 10
for 10
it 10
mrs 10
harker 10
began 10
to 10
blush 10
and 10
taking 10
a 10
paper 10
from 10
her 10
pockets 10
she 10
said 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
will 10
you 10
read 10
this 10
and 10
tell 10
me 10
if 10
it 10
must 10
go 10
in 10
it 10
is 10
my 10
record 10
of 10
today 10
i 10
too 10
have 10
seen 10
the 10
need 10
of 10
putting 10
down 10
at 10
present 10
everything 10
however 10
trivial 10
but 10
there 10
is 10
little 10
in 10
this 10
except 10
what 10
is 10
personal 10
must 10
it 10
go 10
in 10
the 10
professor 10
read 10
it 10
over 10
gravely 10
and 10
handed 10
it 10
back 10
saying 10
it 10
need 10
not 10
go 10
in 10
if 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
wish 10
it 10
but 10
i 10
pray 10
that 10
it 10
may 10
it 10
can 10
but 10
make 10
your 10
husband 10
love 10
you 10
the 10
more 10
and 10
all 10
us 10
your 10
friends 10
more 10
honor 10
you 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
more 10
esteem 10
and 10
love 10
she 10
took 10
it 10
back 10
with 10
another 10
blush 10
and 10
a 10
bright 10
smile 10
and 10
so 10
now 10
up 10
to 10
this 10
very 10
hour 10
all 10
the 10
records 10
we 10
have 10
are 10
complete 10
and 10
in 10
order 10
the 10
professor 10
took 10
away 10
one 10
copy 10
to 10
study 10
after 10
dinner 10
and 10
before 10

after 10
dinner 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
at 10
six 10
oclock 10
we 10
unconsciously 10
formed 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
board 10
or 10
committee 10
professor 10
van 10
helsing 10

on 10
his 10

in 10
the 10
center 10
the 10
professor 10
said 10
i 10
may 10
i 10
suppose 10
take 10
it 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
acquainted 10
with 10
the 10
facts 10
that 10

in 10
these 10
papers 10
we 10
all 10
expressed 10
assent 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
then 10
it 10
were 10
i 10
think 10
good 10
that 10
i 10
tell 10
you 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
kind 10
of 10
enemy 10
with 10
which 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
deal 10
i 10
shall 10
then 10
make 10
known 10
to 10
you 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
history 10
of 10
this 10
man 10
which 10
has 10
been 10
ascertained 10
for 10
me 10
so 10
we 10
then 10
can 10
discuss 10
how 10
we 10
shall 10

according 10
there 10
are 10
such 10
beings 10
as 10
vampires 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
have 10
evidence 10
that 10
they 10
exist 10
even 10
had 10
we 10
not 10
the 10

of 10
our 10
own 10
unhappy 10
experience 10
the 10
teachings 10
and 10
the 10
records 10
of 10
the 10
past 10
give 10
proof 10
enough 10
for 10
sane 10
peoples 10
i 10
admit 10
that 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
i 10
was 10
sceptic 10

through 10
long 10
years 10

have 10
trained 10
myself 10
to 10
keep 10
an 10
open 10
mind 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
believed 10
until 10
such 10
time 10
as 10

alas 10
had 10
i 10
known 10
at 10
first 10
what 10
now 10
i 10
know 10
nay 10
had 10
i 10
even 10
guess 10
at 10
him 10
one 10
so 10
precious 10
life 10
had 10
been 10
spared 10
to 10
many 10
of 10
us 10
who 10
did 10
love 10
her 10
but 10
that 10
is 10
gone 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
so 10
work 10
that 10
other 10
poor 10
souls 10
perish 10
not 10
whilst 10
we 10
can 10
save 10
the 10
nosferatu 10
do 10
not 10
die 10
like 10
the 10
bee 10
when 10
he 10
sting 10
once 10
he 10
is 10
only 10
stronger 10
and 10
being 10
stronger 10
have 10
yet 10
more 10
power 10
to 10
work 10
evil 10
this 10
vampire 10
which 10
is 10
amongst 10
us 10
is 10
of 10
himself 10
so 10
strong 10
in 10
person 10
as 10
twenty 10
men 10
he 10
is 10
of 10
cunning 10
more 10
than 10
mortal 10
for 10
his 10
cunning 10
be 10
the 10
growth 10
of 10
ages 10
he 10
have 10
still 10
the 10
aids 10
of 10
necromancy 10
which 10
is 10
as 10
his 10
etymology 10
imply 10
the 10
divination 10
by 10
the 10
dead 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
dead 10
that 10
he 10
can 10
come 10
nigh 10
to 10
are 10
for 10
him 10
at 10
command 10
he 10
is 10
brute 10
and 10
more 10
than 10
brute 10
he 10
is 10
devil 10
in 10
callous 10
and 10
the 10
heart 10
of 10
him 10
is 10
not 10
he 10
can 10
within 10
his 10
range 10
direct 10
the 10
elements 10
the 10
storm 10
the 10
fog 10
the 10
thunder 10
he 10
can 10
command 10
all 10
the 10
meaner 10
things 10
the 10
rat 10
and 10
the 10
owl 10
and 10
the 10
bat 10
the 10
moth 10
and 10
the 10
fox 10
and 10
the 10
wolf 10
he 10
can 10
grow 10
and 10
become 10
small 10
and 10
he 10
can 10
at 10
times 10
vanish 10
and 10
come 10
unknown 10
how 10
then 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
begin 10
our 10
strike 10
to 10
destroy 10
him 10
how 10
shall 10
we 10
find 10
his 10
where 10
and 10
having 10
found 10
it 10
how 10
can 10
we 10
destroy 10
my 10
friends 10
this 10
is 10
much 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
terrible 10
task 10
that 10
we 10
undertake 10
and 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
consequence 10
to 10
make 10
the 10
brave 10
shudder 10
for 10
if 10
we 10
fail 10
in 10
this 10
our 10
fight 10
he 10
must 10
surely 10
win 10
and 10
then 10
where 10
end 10
we 10
life 10
is 10
nothings 10
i 10
heed 10
him 10
not 10
but 10
to 10
fail 10
here 10
is 10
not 10
mere 10
life 10
or 10
death 10
it 10
is 10
that 10
we 10
become 10
as 10
him 10
that 10
we 10
henceforward 10
become 10
foul 10
things 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
like 10
him 10
without 10
heart 10
or 10
conscience 10
preying 10
on 10
the 10
bodies 10
and 10
the 10
souls 10
of 10
those 10
we 10
love 10
best 10
to 10
us 10
forever 10
are 10
the 10
gates 10
of 10
heaven 10
shut 10
for 10
who 10
shall 10
open 10
them 10
to 10
us 10
again 10
we 10
go 10
on 10
for 10
all 10
time 10
abhorred 10
by 10
all 10
a 10
blot 10
on 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
gods 10
sunshine 10
an 10
arrow 10
in 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
him 10
who 10
died 10
for 10
man 10
but 10
we 10
are 10
face 10
to 10
face 10
with 10
duty 10
and 10
in 10
such 10
case 10
must 10
we 10
shrink 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
say 10
no 10
but 10
then 10
i 10
am 10
old 10
and 10
life 10
with 10
his 10
sunshine 10
his 10
fair 10
places 10
his 10
song 10
of 10
birds 10
his 10
music 10
and 10
his 10
love 10
lie 10
far 10
behind 10
you 10
others 10
are 10
young 10
some 10
have 10
seen 10
sorrow 10
but 10
there 10
are 10
fair 10
days 10
yet 10
in 10
store 10
what 10
say 10
you 10
whilst 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
jonathan 10
had 10
taken 10
my 10
hand 10
i 10
feared 10
oh 10
so 10
much 10
that 10
the 10
appalling 10
nature 10
of 10
our 10
danger 10
was 10
overcoming 10
him 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
his 10
hand 10
stretch 10
out 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
life 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
feel 10
its 10
touch 10
so 10
strong 10
so 10
self 10
reliant 10
so 10
resolute 10
a 10
brave 10
mans 10
hand 10
can 10
speak 10
for 10
itself 10
it 10
does 10
not 10
even 10
need 10
a 10
womans 10
love 10
to 10
hear 10
its 10
music 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
done 10
speaking 10
my 10
husband 10
looked 10
in 10
my 10
eyes 10
and 10
i 10
in 10
his 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
need 10
for 10
speaking 10
between 10
us 10
i 10
answer 10
for 10
mina 10
and 10
myself 10
he 10
said 10
count 10
me 10
in 10
professor 10
said 10
mr 10
quincey 10
morris 10
laconically 10
as 10
usual 10
i 10
am 10
with 10
you 10
said 10
lord 10
godalming 10
for 10
lucys 10
sake 10
if 10
for 10
no 10
other 10
reason 10
dr 10
seward 10
simply 10
nodded 10
the 10
professor 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
after 10
laying 10
his 10
golden 10
crucifix 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
held 10
out 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
either 10
side 10
i 10
took 10
his 10
right 10
hand 10
and 10
lord 10
godalming 10
his 10
left 10
jonathan 10
held 10
my 10
right 10
with 10
his 10
left 10
and 10
stretched 10
across 10
to 10
mr 10
morris 10
so 10
as 10
we 10
all 10
took 10
hands 10
our 10
solemn 10
compact 10
was 10
made 10
i 10
felt 10
my 10
heart 10
icy 10
cold 10
but 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
even 10
occur 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
draw 10
back 10
we 10
resumed 10
our 10
places 10
and 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
cheerfulness 10
which 10
showed 10
that 10
the 10
serious 10
work 10
had 10
begun 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
taken 10
as 10
gravely 10
and 10
in 10
as 10
businesslike 10
a 10
way 10
as 10
any 10
other 10
transaction 10
of 10
life 10
well 10
you 10
know 10
what 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
contend 10
against 10
but 10
we 10
too 10
are 10
not 10
without 10
strength 10
we 10
have 10
on 10
our 10
side 10
power 10
of 10
combination 10
a 10
power 10
denied 10
to 10
the 10
vampire 10
kind 10
we 10
have 10
sources 10
of 10
science 10
we 10
are 10
free 10
to 10
act 10
and 10
think 10
and 10
the 10
hours 10
of 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
the 10
night 10
are 10
ours 10
equally 10
in 10
fact 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
our 10
powers 10
extend 10
they 10
are 10
unfettered 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
free 10
to 10
use 10
them 10
we 10
have 10
self 10
devotion 10
in 10
a 10
cause 10
and 10
an 10
end 10
to 10
achieve 10
which 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
selfish 10
one 10
these 10
things 10
are 10
much 10
now 10
let 10
us 10
see 10
how 10
far 10
the 10
general 10
powers 10
arrayed 10
against 10
us 10
are 10
restrict 10
and 10
how 10
the 10
individual 10
cannot 10
in 10
fine 10
let 10
us 10
consider 10
the 10
limitations 10
of 10
the 10
vampire 10
in 10
general 10
and 10
of 10
this 10
one 10
in 10
particular 10
all 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
go 10
upon 10
are 10
traditions 10
and 10
superstitions 10
these 10
do 10
not 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
appear 10
much 10
when 10
the 10
matter 10
is 10
one 10
of 10
life 10
and 10
death 10
nay 10
of 10
more 10
than 10
either 10
life 10
or 10
death 10
yet 10
must 10
we 10
be 10
satisfied 10
in 10
the 10
first 10
place 10
because 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
no 10
other 10
means 10
is 10
at 10
our 10
control 10
and 10
secondly 10
because 10
after 10
all 10
these 10
things 10
tradition 10
and 10
superstition 10
are 10
everything 10
does 10
not 10
the 10
belief 10
in 10
vampires 10
rest 10
for 10
others 10
though 10
not 10
alas 10
for 10
us 10
on 10
them 10
a 10
year 10
ago 10
which 10
of 10
us 10
would 10
have 10
received 10
such 10
a 10
possibility 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
our 10
scientific 10
sceptical 10
matteroffact 10
nineteenth 10
century 10
we 10
even 10
scouted 10
a 10
belief 10
that 10
we 10
saw 10
justified 10
under 10
our 10
very 10
eyes 10
take 10
it 10
then 10
that 10
the 10
vampire 10
and 10
the 10
belief 10
in 10
his 10
limitations 10
and 10
his 10
cure 10
rest 10
for 10
the 10
moment 10
on 10
the 10
same 10
base 10
for 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
he 10
is 10
known 10
everywhere 10
that 10
men 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
old 10
greece 10
in 10
old 10
rome 10
he 10
flourish 10
in 10
germany 10
all 10
over 10
in 10
france 10
in 10
india 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
chermosese 10
and 10
in 10
china 10
so 10
far 10
from 10
us 10
in 10
all 10
ways 10
there 10
even 10
is 10
he 10
and 10
the 10
peoples 10
for 10
him 10
at 10
this 10
day 10
he 10
have 10
follow 10
the 10
wake 10
of 10
the 10
berserker 10
icelander 10
the 10
devilbegotten 10
hun 10
the 10
slav 10
the 10
saxon 10
the 10
magyar 10
so 10
far 10
then 10
we 10
have 10
all 10
we 10
may 10
act 10
upon 10
and 10
let 10
me 10
tell 10
you 10
that 10
very 10
much 10
of 10
the 10
beliefs 10
are 10
justified 10
by 10
what 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
in 10
our 10
own 10
so 10
unhappy 10
experience 10
the 10
vampire 10
live 10
on 10
and 10
cannot 10
die 10
by 10
mere 10
passing 10
of 10
the 10
time 10
he 10
can 10
flourish 10
when 10
that 10
he 10
can 10
fatten 10
on 10
the 10
blood 10
of 10
the 10
living 10
even 10
more 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
amongst 10
us 10
that 10
he 10
can 10
even 10
grow 10
younger 10
that 10
his 10
vital 10
faculties 10
grow 10
strenuous 10
and 10
seem 10
as 10
though 10
they 10
refresh 10
themselves 10
when 10
his 10
special 10
pabulum 10
is 10
plenty 10
but 10
he 10
cannot 10
flourish 10
without 10
this 10
diet 10
he 10
eat 10
not 10
as 10
others 10
even 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
who 10
lived 10
with 10
him 10
for 10
weeks 10
did 10
never 10
see 10
him 10
eat 10
never 10
he 10
throws 10
no 10
shadow 10
he 10
make 10
in 10
the 10
mirror 10
no 10
reflect 10
as 10
again 10
jonathan 10
observe 10
he 10
has 10
the 10
strength 10
of 10
many 10
of 10
his 10
hand 10
witness 10
again 10
jonathan 10
when 10
he 10
shut 10
the 10
door 10
against 10
the 10
wolves 10
and 10
when 10
he 10
help 10
him 10
from 10
the 10
diligence 10
too 10
he 10
can 10
transform 10
himself 10
to 10
wolf 10
as 10
we 10
gather 10
from 10
the 10
ship 10
arrival 10
in 10
whitby 10
when 10
he 10
tear 10
open 10
the 10
dog 10
he 10
can 10
be 10
as 10
bat 10
as 10
madam 10
mina 10
saw 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
at 10
whitby 10
and 10
as 10
friend 10
john 10
saw 10
him 10
fly 10
from 10
this 10
so 10
near 10
house 10
and 10
as 10
my 10
friend 10
quincey 10
saw 10
him 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
of 10
miss 10
lucy 10
he 10
can 10
come 10
in 10
mist 10
which 10
he 10
create 10
that 10
noble 10
ships 10
captain 10
proved 10
him 10
of 10
this 10
but 10
from 10
what 10
we 10
know 10
the 10
distance 10
he 10
can 10
make 10
this 10
mist 10
is 10
limited 10
and 10
it 10
can 10
only 10
be 10
round 10
himself 10
he 10
come 10
on 10
moonlight 10
rays 10
as 10
elemental 10
dust 10
as 10
again 10
jonathan 10
saw 10
those 10
sisters 10
in 10
the 10
castle 10
of 10
dracula 10
he 10
become 10
so 10
small 10
we 10
ourselves 10
saw 10
miss 10
lucy 10
ere 10
she 10
was 10
at 10
peace 10
slip 10
through 10
a 10
hairbreadth 10
space 10
at 10
the 10
tomb 10
door 10
he 10
can 10
when 10
once 10
he 10
find 10
his 10
way 10
come 10
out 10
from 10
anything 10
or 10
into 10
anything 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
close 10
it 10
be 10
bound 10
or 10
even 10
fused 10
up 10
with 10
fire 10
solder 10
you 10
call 10
it 10
he 10
can 10
see 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
no 10
small 10
power 10
this 10
in 10
a 10
world 10
which 10
is 10
one 10
half 10
shut 10
from 10
the 10
light 10
ah 10
but 10
hear 10
me 10
through 10
he 10
can 10
do 10
all 10
these 10
things 10
yet 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
free 10
nay 10
he 10
is 10
even 10
more 10
prisoner 10
than 10
the 10
slave 10
of 10
the 10
galley 10
than 10
the 10
madman 10
in 10
his 10
cell 10
he 10
cannot 10
go 10
where 10
he 10
lists 10
he 10
who 10
is 10
not 10
of 10
nature 10
has 10
yet 10
to 10
obey 10
some 10
of 10
natures 10
laws 10
why 10
we 10
know 10
not 10
he 10
may 10
not 10
enter 10
anywhere 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
unless 10
there 10
be 10
some 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
household 10
who 10
bid 10
him 10
to 10
come 10
though 10
afterwards 10
he 10
can 10
come 10
as 10
he 10
please 10
his 10
power 10
ceases 10
as 10
does 10
that 10
of 10
all 10
evil 10
things 10
at 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
day 10
only 10
at 10
certain 10
times 10
can 10
he 10
have 10
limited 10
freedom 10
if 10
he 10
be 10
not 10
at 10
the 10
place 10
whither 10
he 10
is 10
bound 10
he 10
can 10
only 10
change 10
himself 10
at 10
noon 10
or 10
at 10
exact 10
sunrise 10
or 10
sunset 10
these 10
things 10
we 10
are 10
told 10
and 10
in 10
this 10
record 10
of 10
ours 10
we 10
have 10
proof 10
by 10
inference 10
thus 10
whereas 10
he 10
can 10
do 10
as 10
he 10
will 10
within 10
his 10
limit 10
when 10
he 10
have 10
his 10
earthhome 10
his 10
coffinhome 10
his 10
hellhome 10
the 10
place 10
unhallowed 10
as 10
we 10
saw 10
when 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
grave 10
of 10
the 10
suicide 10
at 10
whitby 10
still 10
at 10
other 10
time 10
he 10
can 10
only 10
change 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
come 10
it 10
is 10
said 10
too 10
that 10
he 10
can 10
only 10
pass 10
running 10
water 10
at 10
the 10
slack 10
or 10
the 10
flood 10
of 10
the 10
tide 10
then 10
there 10
are 10
things 10
which 10
so 10
afflict 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
no 10
power 10
as 10
the 10
garlic 10
that 10
we 10
know 10
of 10
and 10
as 10
for 10
things 10
sacred 10
as 10
this 10
symbol 10
my 10
crucifix 10
that 10
was 10
amongst 10
us 10
even 10
now 10
when 10
we 10
resolve 10
to 10
them 10
he 10
is 10
nothing 10
but 10
in 10
their 10
presence 10
he 10
take 10
his 10
place 10
far 10
off 10
and 10
silent 10
with 10
respect 10
there 10
are 10
others 10
too 10
which 10
i 10
shall 10
tell 10
you 10
of 10
lest 10
in 10
our 10
seeking 10
we 10
may 10
need 10
them 10
the 10
branch 10
of 10
wild 10
rose 10
on 10
his 10
coffin 10
keep 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
move 10
not 10
from 10
it 10
a 10
sacred 10
bullet 10
fired 10
into 10
the 10
coffin 10
kill 10
him 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
be 10
true 10
dead 10
and 10
as 10
for 10
the 10
stake 10
through 10
him 10
we 10
know 10
already 10
of 10
its 10
peace 10
or 10
the 10
cut 10
off 10
head 10
that 10
giveth 10
rest 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
it 10
with 10
our 10
eyes 10
thus 10
when 10
we 10
find 10
the 10
habitation 10
of 10
this 10
manthatwas 10
we 10
can 10
confine 10
him 10
to 10
his 10
coffin 10
and 10
destroy 10
him 10
if 10
we 10
obey 10
what 10
we 10
know 10
but 10
he 10
is 10
clever 10
i 10
have 10
asked 10
my 10
friend 10
arminius 10
of 10
budapesth 10
university 10
to 10
make 10
his 10
record 10
and 10
from 10
all 10
the 10
means 10
that 10
are 10
he 10
tell 10
me 10
of 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
he 10
must 10
indeed 10
have 10
been 10
that 10
voivode 10
dracula 10
who 10
won 10
his 10
name 10
against 10
the 10
turk 10
over 10
the 10
great 10
river 10
on 10
the 10
very 10
frontier 10
of 10
turkeyland 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
so 10
then 10
was 10
he 10
no 10
common 10
man 10
for 10
in 10
that 10
time 10
and 10
for 10
centuries 10
after 10
he 10
was 10
spoken 10
of 10
as 10
the 10
cleverest 10
and 10
the 10
most 10
cunning 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
the 10
bravest 10
of 10
the 10
sons 10
of 10
the 10
land 10
beyond 10
the 10
forest 10
that 10
mighty 10
brain 10
and 10
that 10
iron 10
resolution 10
went 10
with 10
him 10
to 10
his 10
grave 10
and 10
are 10
even 10
now 10
arrayed 10
against 10
us 10
the 10
draculas 10
were 10
says 10
arminius 10
a 10
great 10
and 10
noble 10
race 10
though 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
were 10
scions 10
who 10
were 10
held 10
by 10
their 10
coevals 10
to 10
have 10
had 10
dealings 10
with 10
the 10
evil 10
one 10
they 10
learned 10
his 10
secrets 10
in 10
the 10
scholomance 10
amongst 10
the 10
mountains 10
over 10
lake 10
hermanstadt 10
where 10
the 10
devil 10
claims 10
the 10
tenth 10
scholar 10
as 10
his 10
due 10
in 10
the 10
records 10
are 10
such 10
words 10
as 10
stregoica 10
witch 10
ordog 10
and 10
pokol 10
satan 10
and 10
hell 10
and 10
in 10
one 10
manuscript 10
this 10
very 10
dracula 10
is 10
spoken 10
of 10
as 10
wampyrwhich 10
we 10
all 10
understand 10
too 10
well 10
there 10
have 10
been 10
from 10
the 10
loins 10
of 10
this 10
very 10
one 10
great 10
men 10
and 10
good 10
women 10
and 10
their 10
graves 10
make 10
sacred 10
the 10
earth 10
where 10
alone 10
this 10
foulness 10
can 10
dwell 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
the 10
least 10
of 10
its 10
terrors 10
that 10
this 10
evil 10
thing 10
is 10
rooted 10
deep 10
in 10
all 10
good 10
in 10
soil 10
barren 10
of 10
holy 10
memories 10
it 10
cannot 10
rest 10
whilst 10
they 10
were 10
talking 10
mr 10
morris 10
was 10
looking 10
steadily 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
he 10
now 10
got 10
up 10
quietly 10
and 10
went 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
little 10
pause 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
professor 10
went 10
on 10
and 10
now 10
we 10
must 10
settle 10
what 10
we 10
do 10
we 10
have 10
here 10
much 10
data 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
proceed 10
to 10
lay 10
out 10
our 10
campaign 10
we 10
know 10
from 10
the 10
inquiry 10
of 10
jonathan 10
that 10
from 10
the 10
castle 10
to 10
whitby 10
came 10
fifty 10
boxes 10
of 10
earth 10
all 10
of 10
which 10
were 10
delivered 10
at 10
carfax 10
we 10
also 10
know 10
that 10
at 10
least 10
some 10
of 10
these 10
boxes 10
have 10
been 10
removed 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
our 10
first 10
step 10
should 10
be 10
to 10
ascertain 10
whether 10
all 10
the 10
rest 10
remain 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
beyond 10
that 10
wall 10
where 10
we 10
look 10
today 10
or 10
whether 10
any 10
more 10
have 10
been 10
removed 10
if 10
the 10
latter 10
we 10
must 10
trace 10
here 10
we 10
were 10
interrupted 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
startling 10
way 10
outside 10
the 10
house 10
came 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
a 10
pistol 10
shot 10
the 10
glass 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
was 10
shattered 10
with 10
a 10
bullet 10
which 10
ricochetting 10
from 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
embrasure 10
struck 10
the 10
far 10
wall 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
i 10
am 10
at 10
heart 10
a 10
coward 10
for 10
i 10
shrieked 10
out 10
the 10
men 10
all 10
jumped 10
to 10
their 10
feet 10
lord 10
godalming 10
flew 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
and 10
threw 10
up 10
the 10
sash 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
so 10
we 10
heard 10
mr 10
morris 10
voice 10
without 10
sorry 10
i 10
fear 10
i 10
have 10
alarmed 10
you 10
i 10
shall 10
come 10
in 10
and 10
tell 10
you 10
about 10
it 10
a 10
minute 10
later 10
he 10
came 10
in 10
and 10
said 10
it 10
was 10
an 10
idiotic 10
thing 10
of 10
me 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
i 10
ask 10
your 10
pardon 10
mrs 10
harker 10
most 10
sincerely 10
i 10
fear 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
frightened 10
you 10
terribly 10
but 10
the 10
fact 10
is 10
that 10
whilst 10
the 10
professor 10
was 10
talking 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
big 10
bat 10
and 10
sat 10
on 10
the 10
window 10
sill 10
i 10
have 10
got 10
such 10
a 10
horror 10
of 10
the 10
damned 10
brutes 10
from 10
recent 10
events 10
that 10
i 10
cannot 10
stand 10
them 10
and 10
i 10
went 10
out 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
shot 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
doing 10
of 10
late 10
of 10
evenings 10
whenever 10
i 10
have 10
seen 10
one 10
you 10
used 10
to 10
laugh 10
at 10
me 10
for 10
it 10
then 10
art 10
did 10
you 10
hit 10
it 10
asked 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
i 10
fancy 10
not 10
for 10
it 10
flew 10
away 10
into 10
the 10
wood 10
without 10
saying 10
any 10
more 10
he 10
took 10
his 10
seat 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
began 10
to 10
resume 10
his 10
statement 10
we 10
must 10
trace 10
each 10
of 10
these 10
boxes 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
are 10
ready 10
we 10
must 10
either 10
capture 10
or 10
kill 10
this 10
monster 10
in 10
his 10
lair 10
or 10
we 10
must 10
so 10
to 10
speak 10
sterilize 10
the 10
earth 10
so 10
that 10
no 10
more 10
he 10
can 10
seek 10
safety 10
in 10
it 10
thus 10
in 10
the 10
end 10
we 10
may 10
find 10
him 10
in 10
his 10
form 10
of 10
man 10
between 10
the 10
hours 10
of 10
noon 10
and 10
sunset 10
and 10
so 10
engage 10
with 10
him 10
when 10
he 10
is 10
at 10
his 10
most 10
weak 10
and 10
now 10
for 10
you 10
madam 10
mina 10
this 10
night 10
is 10
the 10
end 10
until 10
all 10
be 10
well 10
you 10
are 10
too 10
precious 10
to 10
us 10
to 10
have 10
such 10
risk 10
when 10
we 10
part 10
tonight 10
you 10
no 10
more 10
must 10
question 10
we 10
shall 10
tell 10
you 10
all 10
in 10
good 10
time 10
we 10
are 10
men 10
and 10
are 10
able 10
to 10
bear 10
but 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
our 10
star 10
and 10
our 10
hope 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
act 10
all 10
the 10
more 10
free 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
not 10
in 10
the 10
danger 10
such 10
as 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
the 10
men 10
even 10
jonathan 10
seemed 10
relieved 10
but 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
me 10
good 10
that 10
they 10
should 10
brave 10
danger 10
and 10
perhaps 10
lessen 10
their 10
safety 10
strength 10
being 10
the 10
best 10
safety 10
through 10
care 10
of 10
me 10
but 10
their 10
minds 10
were 10
made 10
up 10
and 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
bitter 10
pill 10
for 10
me 10
to 10
swallow 10
i 10
could 10
say 10
nothing 10
save 10
to 10
accept 10
their 10
chivalrous 10
care 10
of 10
me 10
mr 10
morris 10
resumed 10
the 10
discussion 10
as 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
time 10
to 10
lose 10
i 10
vote 10
we 10
have 10
a 10
look 10
at 10
his 10
house 10
right 10
now 10
time 10
is 10
everything 10
with 10
him 10
and 10
swift 10
action 10
on 10
our 10
part 10
may 10
save 10
another 10
victim 10
i 10
own 10
that 10
my 10
heart 10
began 10
to 10
fail 10
me 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
for 10
action 10
came 10
so 10
close 10
but 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
say 10
anything 10
for 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
greater 10
fear 10
that 10
if 10
i 10
appeared 10
as 10
a 10
drag 10
or 10
a 10
hindrance 10
to 10
their 10
work 10
they 10
might 10
even 10
leave 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
their 10
counsels 10
altogether 10
they 10
have 10
now 10
gone 10
off 10
to 10
carfax 10
with 10
means 10
to 10
get 10
into 10
the 10
house 10
manlike 10
they 10
had 10
told 10
me 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
and 10
sleep 10
as 10
if 10
a 10
woman 10
can 10
sleep 10
when 10
those 10
she 10
loves 10
are 10
in 10
danger 10
i 10
shall 10
lie 10
down 10
and 10
pretend 10
to 10
sleep 10
lest 10
jonathan 10
have 10
added 10
anxiety 10
about 10
me 10
when 10
he 10
returns 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
october 10
amjust 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
about 10
to 10
leave 10
the 10
house 10
an 10
urgent 10
message 10
was 10
brought 10
to 10
me 10
from 10
renfield 10
to 10
know 10
if 10
i 10
would 10
see 10
him 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
utmost 10
importance 10
to 10
say 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
told 10
the 10
messenger 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
attend 10
to 10
his 10
wishes 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
i 10
was 10
busy 10
just 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
the 10
attendant 10
added 10
he 10
seems 10
very 10
importunate 10
sir 10
i 10
have 10
never 10
seen 10
him 10
so 10
eager 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
but 10
what 10
if 10
you 10
dont 10
see 10
him 10
soon 10
he 10
will 10
have 10
one 10
of 10
his 10
violent 10
fits 10
i 10
knew 10
the 10
man 10
would 10
not 10
have 10
said 10
this 10
without 10
some 10
cause 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
all 10
right 10
ill 10
go 10
now 10
and 10
i 10
asked 10
the 10
others 10
to 10
wait 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
for 10
me 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
go 10
and 10
see 10
my 10
patient 10
take 10
me 10
with 10
you 10
friend 10
john 10
said 10
the 10
professorhis 10
case 10
in 10
your 10
diary 10
interest 10
me 10
much 10
and 10
it 10
had 10
bearing 10
too 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
on 10
our 10
case 10
i 10
should 10
much 10
like 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
and 10
especial 10
when 10
his 10
mind 10
is 10
disturbed 10
may 10
i 10
come 10
also 10
asked 10
lord 10
godalming 10
me 10
too 10
said 10
quincey 10
morris 10
may 10
i 10
come 10
said 10
harker 10
i 10
nodded 10
and 10
we 10
all 10
went 10
down 10
the 10
passage 10
together 10
we 10
found 10
him 10
in 10
a 10
state 10
of 10
considerable 10
excitement 10
but 10
far 10
more 10
rational 10
in 10
his 10
speech 10
and 10
manner 10
than 10
i 10
had 10
ever 10
seen 10
him 10
there 10
was 10
an 10
unusual 10
understanding 10
of 10
himself 10
which 10
was 10
unlike 10
anything 10
i 10
had 10
ever 10
met 10
with 10
in 10
a 10
lunatic 10
and 10
he 10
took 10
it 10
for 10
granted 10
that 10
his 10
reasons 10
would 10
prevail 10
with 10
others 10
entirely 10
sane 10
we 10
all 10
five 10
went 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
but 10
none 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
at 10
first 10
said 10
anything 10
his 10
request 10
was 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
at 10
once 10
release 10
him 10
from 10
the 10
asylum 10
and 10
send 10
him 10
home 10
this 10
he 10
backed 10
up 10
with 10
arguments 10
regarding 10
his 10
complete 10
recovery 10
and 10
adduced 10
his 10
own 10
existing 10
sanity 10
i 10
appeal 10
to 10
your 10
friends 10
he 10
said 10
they 10
will 10
perhaps 10
not 10
mind 10
sitting 10
in 10
judgement 10
on 10
my 10
case 10
by 10
the 10
way 10
you 10
have 10
not 10
introduced 10
me 10
i 10
was 10
so 10
much 10
astonished 10
that 10
the 10
oddness 10
of 10
introducing 10
a 10
madman 10
in 10
an 10
asylum 10
did 10
not 10
strike 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
and 10
besides 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
certain 10
dignity 10
in 10
the 10
mans 10
manner 10
so 10
much 10
of 10
the 10
habit 10
of 10
equality 10
that 10
i 10
at 10
once 10
made 10
the 10
introduction 10
lord 10
godalming 10
professor 10
van 10
helsing 10
mr 10
quincey 10
morris 10
of 10
texas 10
mr 10
jonathan 10
harker 10
mr 10
renfield 10
he 10
shook 10
hands 10
with 10
each 10
of 10
them 10
saying 10
in 10
turn 10
lord 10
godalming 10
i 10
had 10
the 10
honor 10
of 10
seconding 10
your 10
father 10
at 10
the 10
windham 10
i 10
grieve 10
to 10
know 10
by 10
your 10
holding 10
the 10
title 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
no 10
more 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
man 10
loved 10
and 10
honored 10
by 10
all 10
who 10
knew 10
him 10
and 10
in 10
his 10
youth 10
was 10
i 10
have 10
heard 10
the 10
inventor 10
of 10
a 10
burnt 10
rum 10
punch 10
much 10
patronized 10
on 10
derby 10
night 10
mr 10
morris 10
you 10
should 10
be 10
proud 10
of 10
your 10
great 10
state 10
its 10
reception 10
into 10
the 10
union 10
was 10
a 10
precedent 10
which 10
may 10
have 10
farreaching 10
effects 10
hereafter 10
when 10
the 10
pole 10
and 10
the 10
tropics 10
may 10
hold 10
alliance 10
to 10
the 10
stars 10
and 10
stripes 10
the 10
power 10
of 10
treaty 10
may 10
yet 10
prove 10
a 10
vast 10
engine 10
of 10
enlargement 10
when 10
the 10
monroe 10
doctrine 10
takes 10
its 10
true 10
place 10
as 10
a 10
political 10
fable 10
what 10
shall 10
any 10
man 10
say 10
of 10
his 10
pleasure 10
at 10
meeting 10
van 10
helsing 10
sir 10
i 10
make 10
no 10
apology 10
for 10
dropping 10
all 10
forms 10
of 10
conventional 10
prefix 10
when 10
an 10
individual 10
has 10
revolutionized 10
therapeutics 10
by 10
his 10
discovery 10
of 10
the 10
continuous 10
evolution 10
of 10
brain 10
matter 10
conventional 10
forms 10
are 10
unfitting 10
since 10
they 10
would 10
seem 10
to 10
limit 10
him 10
to 10
one 10
of 10
a 10
class 10
you 10
gentlemen 10
who 10
by 10
nationality 10
by 10
heredity 10
or 10
by 10
the 10
possession 10
of 10
natural 10
gifts 10
are 10
fitted 10
to 10
hold 10
your 10
respective 10
places 10
in 10
the 10
moving 10
world 10
i 10
take 10
to 10
witness 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
as 10
sane 10
as 10
at 10
least 10
the 10
majority 10
of 10
men 10
who 10
are 10
in 10
full 10
possession 10
of 10
their 10
liberties 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
that 10
you 10
dr 10
seward 10
humanitarian 10
and 10
medicojurist 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
scientist 10
will 10
deem 10
it 10
a 10
moral 10
duty 10
to 10
deal 10
with 10
me 10
as 10
one 10
to 10
be 10
considered 10
as 10
under 10
exceptional 10
circumstanceshe 10
made 10
this 10
last 10
appeal 10
with 10
a 10
courtly 10
air 10
of 10
conviction 10
which 10
was 10
not 10
without 10
its 10
own 10
charm 10
i 10
think 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
staggered 10
for 10
my 10
own 10
part 10
i 10
was 10
under 10
the 10
conviction 10
despite 10
my 10
knowledge 10
of 10
the 10
mans 10
character 10
and 10
history 10
that 10
his 10
reason 10
had 10
been 10
restored 10
and 10
i 10
felt 10
under 10
a 10
strong 10
impulse 10
to 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
satisfied 10
as 10
to 10
his 10
sanity 10
and 10
would 10
see 10
about 10
the 10
necessary 10
formalities 10
for 10
his 10
release 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
better 10
to 10
wait 10
however 10
before 10
making 10
so 10
grave 10
a 10
statement 10
for 10
of 10
old 10
i 10
knew 10
the 10
sudden 10
changes 10
to 10
which 10
this 10
particular 10
patient 10
was 10
liable 10
so 10
i 10
contented 10
myself 10
with 10
making 10
a 10
general 10
statement 10
that 10
he 10
appeared 10
to 10
be 10
improving 10
very 10
rapidly 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
a 10
longer 10
chat 10
with 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
and 10
would 10
then 10
see 10
what 10
i 10
could 10
do 10
in 10
the 10
direction 10
of 10
meeting 10
his 10
wishes 10
this 10
did 10
not 10
at 10
all 10
satisfy 10
him 10
for 10
he 10
said 10
quickly 10
but 10
i 10
fear 10
dr 10
seward 10
that 10
you 10
hardly 10
apprehend 10
my 10
wish 10
i 10
desire 10
to 10
go 10
at 10
once 10
here 10
now 10
this 10
very 10
hour 10
this 10
very 10
moment 10
if 10
i 10
may 10
time 10
presses 10
and 10
in 10
our 10
implied 10
agreement 10
with 10
the 10
old 10
scytheman 10
it 10
is 10
of 10
the 10
essence 10
of 10
the 10
contract 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
necessary 10
to 10
put 10
before 10
so 10
admirable 10
a 10
practitioner 10
as 10
dr 10
seward 10
so 10
simple 10
yet 10
so 10
momentous 10
a 10
wish 10
to 10
ensure 10
its 10
fulfilment 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
keenly 10
and 10
seeing 10
the 10
negative 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
turned 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
and 10
scrutinized 10
them 10
closely 10
not 10
meeting 10
any 10
sufficient 10
response 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
is 10
it 10
possible 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
erred 10
in 10
my 10
supposition 10
you 10
have 10
i 10
said 10
frankly 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
as 10
i 10
felt 10
brutally 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
considerable 10
pause 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
said 10
slowly 10
then 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
must 10
only 10
shift 10
my 10
ground 10
of 10
request 10
let 10
me 10
ask 10
for 10
this 10
concession 10
boon 10
privilege 10
what 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
am 10
content 10
to 10
implore 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
case 10
not 10
on 10
personal 10
grounds 10
but 10
for 10
the 10
sake 10
of 10
others 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
at 10
liberty 10
to 10
give 10
you 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
my 10
reasons 10
but 10
you 10
may 10
i 10
assure 10
you 10
take 10
it 10
from 10
me 10
that 10
they 10
are 10
good 10
ones 10
sound 10
and 10
unselfish 10
and 10
spring 10
from 10
the 10
highest 10
sense 10
of 10
duty 10
could 10
you 10
look 10
sir 10
into 10
my 10
heart 10
you 10
would 10
approve 10
to 10
the 10
full 10
the 10
sentiments 10
which 10
animate 10
me 10
nay 10
more 10
you 10
would 10
count 10
me 10
amongst 10
the 10
best 10
and 10
truest 10
of 10
your 10
friends 10
again 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
us 10
all 10
keenly 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
growing 10
conviction 10
that 10
this 10
sudden 10
change 10
of 10
his 10
entire 10
intellectual 10
method 10
was 10
but 10
yet 10
another 10
phase 10
of 10
his 10
madness 10
and 10
so 10
determined 10
to 10
let 10
him 10
go 10
on 10
a 10
little 10
longer 10
knowing 10
from 10
experience 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
like 10
all 10
lunatics 10
give 10
himself 10
away 10
in 10
the 10
end 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
gazing 10
at 10
him 10
with 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
utmost 10
intensity 10
his 10
bushy 10
eyebrows 10
almost 10
meeting 10
with 10
the 10
fixed 10
concentration 10
of 10
his 10
look 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
renfield 10
in 10
a 10
tone 10
which 10
did 10
not 10
surprise 10
me 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
but 10
only 10
when 10
i 10
thought 10
of 10
it 10
afterwards 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
as 10
of 10
one 10
addressing 10
an 10
equal 10
can 10
you 10
not 10
tell 10
frankly 10
your 10
real 10
reason 10
for 10
wishing 10
to 10
be 10
free 10
tonight 10
i 10
will 10
undertake 10
that 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
satisfy 10
even 10
me 10
a 10
stranger 10
without 10
prejudice 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
habit 10
of 10
keeping 10
an 10
open 10
mind 10
dr 10
seward 10
will 10
give 10
you 10
at 10
his 10
own 10
risk 10
and 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
responsibility 10
the 10
privilege 10
you 10
seek 10
he 10
shook 10
his 10
head 10
sadly 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
poignant 10
regret 10
on 10
his 10
face 10
the 10
professor 10
went 10
on 10
come 10
sir 10
bethink 10
yourself 10
you 10
claim 10
the 10
privilege 10
of 10
reason 10
in 10
the 10
highest 10
degree 10
since 10
you 10
seek 10
to 10
impress 10
us 10
with 10
your 10
complete 10
reasonableness 10
you 10
do 10
this 10
whose 10
sanity 10
we 10
have 10
reason 10
to 10
doubt 10
since 10
you 10
are 10
not 10
yet 10
released 10
from 10
medical 10
treatment 10
for 10
this 10
very 10
defect 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
help 10
us 10
in 10
our 10
effort 10
to 10
choose 10
the 10
wisest 10
course 10
how 10
can 10
we 10
perform 10
the 10
duty 10
which 10
you 10
yourself 10
put 10
upon 10
us 10
be 10
wise 10
and 10
help 10
us 10
and 10
if 10
we 10
can 10
we 10
shall 10
aid 10
you 10
to 10
achieve 10
your 10
wish 10
he 10
still 10
shook 10
his 10
head 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
have 10
nothing 10
to 10
say 10
your 10
argument 10
is 10
complete 10
and 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
free 10
to 10
speak 10
i 10
should 10
not 10
hesitate 10
a 10
moment 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
my 10
own 10
master 10
in 10
the 10
matter 10
i 10
can 10
only 10
ask 10
you 10
to 10
trust 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
am 10
refused 10
the 10
responsibility 10
does 10
not 10
rest 10
with 10
me 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
time 10
to 10
end 10
the 10
scene 10
which 10
was 10
becoming 10
too 10
comically 10
grave 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
towards 10
the 10
door 10
simply 10
saying 10
come 10
my 10
friends 10
we 10
have 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
goodnight 10
as 10
however 10
i 10
got 10
near 10
the 10
door 10
a 10
new 10
change 10
came 10
over 10
the 10
patient 10
he 10
moved 10
towards 10
me 10
so 10
quickly 10
that 10
for 10
the 10
moment 10
i 10
feared 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
about 10
to 10
make 10
another 10
homicidal 10
attack 10
my 10
fears 10
however 10
were 10
groundless 10
for 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
his 10
two 10
hands 10
imploringly 10
and 10
made 10
his 10
petition 10
in 10
a 10
moving 10
manner 10
as 10
he 10
saw 10
that 10
the 10
very 10
excess 10
of 10
his 10
emotion 10
was 10
militating 10
against 10
him 10
by 10
restoring 10
us 10
more 10
to 10
our 10
old 10
relations 10
he 10
became 10
still 10
more 10
demonstrative 10
i 10
glanced 10
at 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
saw 10
my 10
conviction 10
reflected 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
so 10
i 10
became 10
a 10
little 10
more 10
fixed 10
in 10
my 10
manner 10
if 10
not 10
more 10
stern 10
and 10
motioned 10
to 10
him 10
that 10
his 10
efforts 10
were 10
unavailing 10
i 10
had 10
previously 10
seen 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
same 10
constantly 10
growing 10
excitement 10
in 10
him 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
make 10
some 10
request 10
of 10
which 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
he 10
had 10
thought 10
much 10
such 10
for 10
instance 10
as 10
when 10
he 10
wanted 10
a 10
cat 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
prepared 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
collapse 10
into 10
the 10
same 10
sullen 10
acquiescence 10
on 10
this 10
occasion 10
my 10
expectation 10
was 10
not 10
realized 10
for 10
when 10
he 10
found 10
that 10
his 10
appeal 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
successful 10
he 10
got 10
into 10
quite 10
a 10
frantic 10
condition 10
he 10
threw 10
himself 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
and 10
held 10
up 10
his 10
hands 10
wringing 10
them 10
in 10
plaintive 10
supplication 10
and 10
poured 10
forth 10
a 10
torrent 10
of 10
entreaty 10
with 10
the 10
tears 10
rolling 10
down 10
his 10
cheeks 10
and 10
his 10
whole 10
face 10
and 10
form 10
expressive 10
of 10
the 10
deepest 10
emotion 10
let 10
me 10
entreat 10
you 10
dr 10
seward 10
oh 10
let 10
me 10
implore 10
you 10
to 10
let 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
this 10
house 10
at 10
once 10
send 10
me 10
away 10
how 10
you 10
will 10
and 10
where 10
you 10
will 10
send 10
keepers 10
with 10
me 10
with 10
whips 10
and 10
chains 10
let 10
them 10
take 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
manacled 10
and 10
legironed 10
even 10
to 10
gaol 10
but 10
let 10
me 10
go 10
out 10
of 10
this 10
you 10
dont 10
know 10
what 10
you 10
do 10
by 10
keeping 10
me 10
here 10
i 10
am 10
speaking 10
from 10
the 10
depths 10
of 10
my 10
heart 10
of 10
my 10
very 10
soul 10
you 10
dont 10
know 10
whom 10
you 10
wrong 10
or 10
how 10
and 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
tell 10
woe 10
is 10

sacred 10
by 10
all 10
you 10
hold 10
dear 10
by 10
your 10
love 10
that 10
is 10
lost 10
by 10
your 10
hope 10
that 10
lives 10
for 10
the 10
sake 10
of 10
the 10
almighty 10
take 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
this 10
and 10
save 10
my 10
soul 10
from 10
guilt 10
cant 10
you 10
hear 10
me 10
man 10
cant 10
you 10
understand 10
will 10
you 10
never 10
learn 10
dont 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
sane 10
and 10
earnest 10
now 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
no 10
lunatic 10
in 10
a 10
mad 10
fit 10
but 10
a 10
sane 10
man 10
fighting 10
for 10
his 10
soul 10
oh 10
hear 10
me 10
hear 10
me 10
let 10
me 10
go 10
let 10
me 10
go 10
let 10
me 10
go 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
the 10
longer 10
this 10
went 10
on 10
the 10
wilder 10
he 10
would 10
get 10
and 10
so 10
would 10
bring 10
on 10
a 10
fit 10
so 10
i 10
took 10
him 10
by 10
the 10
hand 10
and 10
raised 10
him 10
up 10
come 10
i 10
said 10
sternly 10
no 10
more 10
of 10
this 10
we 10
have 10
had 10
quite 10
enough 10
already 10
get 10
to 10
your 10
bed 10
and 10
try 10
to 10
behave 10
more 10
discreetly 10
he 10
suddenly 10
stopped 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
intently 10
for 10
several 10
moments 10
then 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
rose 10
and 10
moving 10
over 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
bed 10
the 10
collapse 10
had 10
come 10
as 10
on 10
former 10
occasions 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
expected 10
when 10
i 10
was 10
leaving 10
the 10
room 10
last 10
of 10
our 10
party 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
quiet 10
wellbred 10
voice 10
you 10
will 10
i 10
trust 10
dr 10
seward 10
do 10
me 10
the 10
justice 10
to 10
bear 10
in 10
mind 10
later 10
on 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
what 10
i 10
could 10
to 10
convince 10
you 10
tonight 10

october 10
ami 10
went 10
with 10
the 10
party 10
to 10
the 10
search 10
with 10
an 10
easy 10
mind 10
for 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
never 10
saw 10
mina 10
so 10
absolutely 10
strong 10
and 10
well 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
glad 10
that 10
she 10
consented 10
to 10
hold 10
back 10
and 10
let 10
us 10
men 10
do 10
the 10
work 10
somehow 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
dread 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
this 10
fearful 10
business 10
at 10
all 10
but 10
now 10
that 10
her 10
work 10
is 10
done 10
and 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
due 10
to 10
her 10
energy 10
and 10
brains 10
and 10
foresight 10
that 10
the 10
whole 10
story 10
is 10
put 10
together 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
every 10
point 10
tells 10
she 10
may 10
well 10
feel 10
that 10
her 10
part 10
is 10
finished 10
and 10
that 10
she 10
can 10
henceforth 10
leave 10
the 10
rest 10
to 10
us 10
we 10
were 10
i 10
think 10
all 10
a 10
little 10
upset 10
by 10
the 10
scene 10
with 10
mr 10
renfield 10
when 10
we 10
came 10
away 10
from 10
his 10
room 10
we 10
were 10
silent 10
till 10
we 10
got 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
study 10
then 10
mr 10
morris 10
said 10
to 10
dr 10
seward 10
say 10
jack 10
if 10
that 10
man 10
wasnt 10
attempting 10
a 10
bluff 10
he 10
is 10
about 10
the 10
sanest 10
lunatic 10
i 10
ever 10
saw 10
im 10
not 10
sure 10
but 10
i 10
believe 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
some 10
serious 10
purpose 10
and 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
it 10
was 10
pretty 10
rough 10
on 10
him 10
not 10
to 10
get 10
a 10
chance 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
silent 10
but 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
added 10
friend 10
john 10
you 10
know 10
more 10
lunatics 10
than 10
i 10
do 10
and 10
im 10
glad 10
of 10
it 10
for 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
if 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
decide 10
i 10
would 10
before 10
that 10
last 10
hysterical 10
outburst 10
have 10
given 10
him 10
free 10
but 10
we 10
live 10
and 10
learn 10
and 10
in 10
our 10
present 10
task 10
we 10
must 10
take 10
no 10
chance 10
as 10
my 10
friend 10
quincey 10
would 10
say 10
all 10
is 10
best 10
as 10
they 10
are 10
dr 10
seward 10
seemed 10
to 10
answer 10
them 10
both 10
in 10
a 10
dreamy 10
kind 10
of 10
way 10
i 10
dont 10
know 10
but 10
that 10
i 10
agree 10
with 10
you 10
if 10
that 10
man 10
had 10
been 10
an 10
ordinary 10
lunatic 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
taken 10
my 10
chance 10
of 10
trusting 10
him 10
but 10
he 10
seems 10
so 10
mixed 10
up 10
with 10
the 10
count 10
in 10
an 10
indexy 10
kind 10
of 10
way 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
of 10
doing 10
anything 10
wrong 10
by 10
helping 10
his 10
fads 10
i 10
cant 10
forget 10
how 10
he 10
prayed 10
with 10
almost 10
equal 10
fervor 10
for 10
a 10
cat 10
and 10
then 10
tried 10
to 10
tear 10
my 10
throat 10
out 10
with 10
his 10
teeth 10
besides 10
he 10
called 10
the 10
count 10
lord 10
and 10
master 10
and 10
he 10
may 10
want 10
to 10
get 10
out 10
to 10
help 10
him 10
in 10
some 10
diabolical 10
way 10
that 10
horrid 10
thing 10
has 10
the 10
wolves 10
and 10
the 10
rats 10
and 10
his 10
own 10
kind 10
to 10
help 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
suppose 10
he 10
isnt 10
above 10
trying 10
to 10
use 10
a 10
respectable 10
lunatic 10
he 10
certainly 10
did 10
seem 10
earnest 10
though 10
i 10
only 10
hope 10
we 10
have 10
done 10
what 10
is 10
best 10
these 10
things 10
in 10
conjunction 10
with 10
the 10
wild 10
work 10
we 10
have 10
in 10
hand 10
help 10
to 10
unnerve 10
a 10
man 10
the 10
professor 10
stepped 10
over 10
and 10
laying 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
his 10
shoulder 10
said 10
in 10
his 10
grave 10
kindly 10
way 10
friend 10
john 10
have 10
no 10
fear 10
we 10
are 10
trying 10
to 10
do 10
our 10
duty 10
in 10
a 10
very 10
sad 10
and 10
terrible 10
case 10
we 10
can 10
only 10
do 10
as 10
we 10
deem 10
best 10
what 10
else 10
have 10
we 10
to 10
hope 10
for 10
except 10
the 10
pity 10
of 10
the 10
good 10
god 10
lord 10
godalming 10
had 10
slipped 10
away 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
but 10
now 10
he 10
returned 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
a 10
little 10
silver 10
whistle 10
as 10
he 10
remarked 10
that 10
old 10
place 10
may 10
be 10
full 10
of 10
rats 10
and 10
if 10
so 10
ive 10
got 10
an 10
antidote 10
on 10
call 10
having 10
passed 10
the 10
wall 10
we 10
took 10
our 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
taking 10
care 10
to 10
keep 10
in 10
the 10
shadows 10
of 10
the 10
trees 10
on 10
the 10
lawn 10
when 10
the 10
moonlight 10
shone 10
out 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
to 10
the 10
porch 10
the 10
professor 10
opened 10
his 10
bag 10
and 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
things 10
which 10
he 10
laid 10
on 10
the 10
step 10
sorting 10
them 10
into 10
four 10
little 10
groups 10
evidently 10
one 10
for 10
each 10
then 10
he 10
spoke 10
my 10
friends 10
we 10
are 10
going 10
into 10
a 10
terrible 10
danger 10
and 10
we 10
need 10
arms 10
of 10
many 10
kinds 10
our 10
enemy 10
is 10
not 10
merely 10
spiritual 10
remember 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
the 10
strength 10
of 10
twenty 10
men 10
and 10
that 10
though 10
our 10
necks 10
or 10
our 10
windpipes 10
are 10
of 10
the 10
common 10
kind 10
and 10
therefore 10
breakable 10
or 10
crushable 10
his 10
are 10
not 10
amenable 10
to 10
mere 10
strength 10
a 10
stronger 10
man 10
or 10
a 10
body 10
of 10
men 10
more 10
strong 10
in 10
all 10
than 10
him 10
can 10
at 10
certain 10
times 10
hold 10
him 10
but 10
they 10
cannot 10
hurt 10
him 10
as 10
we 10
can 10
be 10
hurt 10
by 10
him 10
we 10
must 10
therefore 10
guard 10
ourselves 10
from 10
his 10
touch 10
keep 10
this 10
near 10
your 10
heart 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
lifted 10
a 10
little 10
silver 10
crucifix 10
and 10
held 10
it 10
out 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
being 10
nearest 10
to 10
him 10
put 10
these 10
flowers 10
round 10
your 10
neck 10
here 10
he 10
handed 10
to 10
me 10
a 10
wreath 10
of 10
withered 10
garlic 10
blossoms 10
for 10
other 10
enemies 10
more 10
mundane 10
this 10
revolver 10
and 10
this 10
knife 10
and 10
for 10
aid 10
in 10
all 10
these 10
so 10
small 10
electric 10
lamps 10
which 10
you 10
can 10
fasten 10
to 10
your 10
breast 10
and 10
for 10
all 10
and 10
above 10
all 10
at 10
the 10
last 10
this 10
which 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
desecrate 10
needless 10
this 10
was 10
a 10
portion 10
of 10
sacred 10
wafer 10
which 10
he 10
put 10
in 10
an 10
envelope 10
and 10
handed 10
to 10
me 10
each 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
was 10
similarly 10
equipped 10
now 10
he 10
said 10
friend 10
john 10
where 10
are 10
the 10
skeleton 10
keys 10
if 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
can 10
open 10
the 10
door 10
we 10
need 10
not 10
break 10
house 10
by 10
the 10
window 10
as 10
before 10
at 10
miss 10
lucys 10
dr 10
seward 10
tried 10
one 10
or 10
two 10
skeleton 10
keys 10
his 10
mechanical 10
dexterity 10
as 10
a 10
surgeon 10
standing 10
him 10
in 10
good 10
stead 10
presently 10
he 10
got 10
one 10
to 10
suit 10
after 10
a 10
little 10
play 10
back 10
and 10
forward 10
the 10
bolt 10
yielded 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
rusty 10
clang 10
shot 10
back 10
we 10
pressed 10
on 10
the 10
door 10
the 10
rusty 10
hinges 10
creaked 10
and 10
it 10
slowly 10
opened 10
it 10
was 10
startlingly 10
like 10
the 10
image 10
conveyed 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
of 10
the 10
opening 10
of 10
miss 10
westenras 10
tomb 10
i 10
fancy 10
that 10
the 10
same 10
idea 10
seemed 10
to 10
strike 10
the 10
others 10
for 10
with 10
one 10
accord 10
they 10
shrank 10
back 10
the 10
professor 10
was 10
the 10
first 10
to 10
move 10
forward 10
and 10
stepped 10
into 10
the 10
open 10
door 10
in 10
manus 10
tuas 10
dominehe 10
said 10
crossing 10
himself 10
as 10
he 10
passed 10
over 10
the 10
threshold 10
we 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
behind 10
us 10
lest 10
when 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
lit 10
our 10
lamps 10
we 10
should 10
possibly 10
attract 10
attention 10
from 10
the 10
road 10
the 10
professor 10
carefully 10
tried 10
the 10
lock 10
lest 10
we 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
open 10
it 10
from 10
within 10
should 10
we 10
be 10
in 10
a 10
hurry 10
making 10
our 10
exit 10
then 10
we 10
all 10
lit 10
our 10
lamps 10
and 10
proceeded 10
on 10
our 10
search 10
the 10
light 10
from 10
the 10
tiny 10
lamps 10
fell 10
in 10
all 10
sorts 10
of 10
odd 10
forms 10
as 10
the 10
rays 10
crossed 10
each 10
other 10
or 10
the 10
opacity 10
of 10
our 10
bodies 10
threw 10
great 10
shadows 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
for 10
my 10
life 10
get 10
away 10
from 10
the 10
feeling 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
someone 10
else 10
amongst 10
us 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
recollection 10
so 10
powerfully 10
brought 10
home 10
to 10
me 10
by 10
the 10
grim 10
surroundings 10
of 10
that 10
terrible 10
experience 10
in 10
transylvania 10
i 10
think 10
the 10
feeling 10
was 10
common 10
to 10
us 10
all 10
for 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
the 10
others 10
kept 10
looking 10
over 10
their 10
shoulders 10
at 10
every 10
sound 10
and 10
every 10
new 10
shadow 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
felt 10
myself 10
doing 10
the 10
whole 10
place 10
was 10
thick 10
with 10
dust 10
the 10
floor 10
was 10
seemingly 10
inches 10
deep 10
except 10
where 10
there 10
were 10
recent 10
footsteps 10
in 10
which 10
on 10
holding 10
down 10
my 10
lamp 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
marks 10
of 10
hobnails 10
where 10
the 10
dust 10
was 10
cracked 10
the 10
walls 10
were 10
fluffy 10
and 10
heavy 10
with 10
dust 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
corners 10
were 10
masses 10
of 10
spiders 10
webs 10
whereon 10
the 10
dust 10
had 10
gathered 10
till 10
they 10
looked 10
like 10
old 10
tattered 10
rags 10
as 10
the 10
weight 10
had 10
torn 10
them 10
partly 10
down 10
on 10
a 10
table 10
in 10
the 10
hall 10
was 10
a 10
great 10
bunch 10
of 10
keys 10
with 10
a 10
timeyellowed 10
label 10
on 10
each 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
used 10
several 10
times 10
for 10
on 10
the 10
table 10
were 10
several 10
similar 10
rents 10
in 10
the 10
blanket 10
of 10
dust 10
similar 10
to 10
that 10
exposed 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
lifted 10
them 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
you 10
know 10
this 10
place 10
jonathan 10
you 10
have 10
copied 10
maps 10
of 10
it 10
and 10
you 10
know 10
it 10
at 10
least 10
more 10
than 10
we 10
do 10
which 10
is 10
the 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
chapel 10
i 10
had 10
an 10
idea 10
of 10
its 10
direction 10
though 10
on 10
my 10
former 10
visit 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
get 10
admission 10
to 10
it 10
so 10
i 10
led 10
the 10
way 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
few 10
wrong 10
turnings 10
found 10
myself 10
opposite 10
a 10
low 10
arched 10
oaken 10
door 10
ribbed 10
with 10
iron 10
bands 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
spot 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
as 10
he 10
turned 10
his 10
lamp 10
on 10
a 10
small 10
map 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
copied 10
from 10
the 10
file 10
of 10
my 10
original 10
correspondence 10
regarding 10
the 10
purchase 10
with 10
a 10
little 10
trouble 10
we 10
found 10
the 10
key 10
on 10
the 10
bunch 10
and 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
we 10
were 10
prepared 10
for 10
some 10
unpleasantness 10
for 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
opening 10
the 10
door 10
a 10
faint 10
malodorous 10
air 10
seemed 10
to 10
exhale 10
through 10
the 10
gaps 10
but 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
ever 10
expected 10
such 10
an 10
odor 10
as 10
we 10
encountered 10
none 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
had 10
met 10
the 10
count 10
at 10
all 10
at 10
close 10
quarters 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
either 10
in 10
the 10
fasting 10
stage 10
of 10
his 10
existence 10
in 10
his 10
rooms 10
or 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
bloated 10
with 10
fresh 10
blood 10
in 10
a 10
ruined 10
building 10
open 10
to 10
the 10
air 10
but 10
here 10
the 10
place 10
was 10
small 10
and 10
close 10
and 10
the 10
long 10
disuse 10
had 10
made 10
the 10
air 10
stagnant 10
and 10
foul 10
there 10
was 10
an 10
earthy 10
smell 10
as 10
of 10
some 10
dry 10
miasma 10
which 10
came 10
through 10
the 10
fouler 10
air 10
but 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
odor 10
itself 10
how 10
shall 10
i 10
describe 10
it 10
it 10
was 10
not 10
alone 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
composed 10
of 10
all 10
the 10
ills 10
of 10
mortality 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
pungent 10
acrid 10
smell 10
of 10
blood 10
but 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
corruption 10
had 10
become 10
itself 10
corrupt 10
faugh 10
it 10
sickens 10
me 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
every 10
breath 10
exhaled 10
by 10
that 10
monster 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
clung 10
to 10
the 10
place 10
and 10
intensified 10
its 10
loathsomeness 10
under 10
ordinary 10
circumstances 10
such 10
a 10
stench 10
would 10
have 10
brought 10
our 10
enterprise 10
to 10
an 10
end 10
but 10
this 10
was 10
no 10
ordinary 10
case 10
and 10
the 10
high 10
and 10
terrible 10
purpose 10
in 10
which 10
we 10
were 10
involved 10
gave 10
us 10
a 10
strength 10
which 10
rose 10
above 10
merely 10
physical 10
considerations 10
after 10
the 10
involuntary 10
shrinking 10
consequent 10
on 10
the 10
first 10
nauseous 10
whiff 10
we 10
one 10
and 10
all 10
set 10
about 10
our 10
work 10
as 10
though 10
that 10
loathsome 10
place 10
were 10
a 10
garden 10
of 10
roses 10
we 10
made 10
an 10
accurate 10
examination 10
of 10
the 10
place 10
the 10
professor 10
saying 10
as 10
we 10
began 10
the 10
first 10
thing 10
is 10
to 10
see 10
how 10
many 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
are 10
left 10
we 10
must 10
then 10
examine 10
every 10
hole 10
and 10
corner 10
and 10
cranny 10
and 10
see 10
if 10
we 10
cannot 10
get 10
some 10
clue 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
has 10
become 10
of 10
the 10
rest 10
a 10
glance 10
was 10
sufficient 10
to 10
show 10
how 10
many 10
remained 10
for 10
the 10
great 10
earth 10
chests 10
were 10
bulky 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
mistaking 10
them 10
there 10
were 10
only 10
twentynine 10
left 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
fifty 10
once 10
i 10
got 10
a 10
fright 10
for 10
seeing 10
lord 10
godalming 10
suddenly 10
turn 10
and 10
look 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
vaulted 10
door 10
into 10
the 10
dark 10
passage 10
beyond 10
i 10
looked 10
too 10
and 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
my 10
heart 10
stood 10
still 10
somewhere 10
looking 10
out 10
from 10
the 10
shadow 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
high 10
lights 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
evil 10
face 10
the 10
ridge 10
of 10
the 10
nose 10
the 10
red 10
eyes 10
the 10
red 10
lips 10
the 10
awful 10
pallor 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
for 10
as 10
lord 10
godalming 10
said 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
saw 10
a 10
face 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
the 10
shadows 10
and 10
resumed 10
his 10
inquiry 10
i 10
turned 10
my 10
lamp 10
in 10
the 10
direction 10
and 10
stepped 10
into 10
the 10
passage 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
anyone 10
and 10
as 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
corners 10
no 10
doors 10
no 10
aperture 10
of 10
any 10
kind 10
but 10
only 10
the 10
solid 10
walls 10
of 10
the 10
passage 10
there 10
could 10
be 10
no 10
hiding 10
place 10
even 10
for 10
him 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
that 10
fear 10
had 10
helped 10
imagination 10
and 10
said 10
nothing 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
later 10
i 10
saw 10
morris 10
step 10
suddenly 10
back 10
from 10
a 10
corner 10
which 10
he 10
was 10
examining 10
we 10
all 10
followed 10
his 10
movements 10
with 10
our 10
eyes 10
for 10
undoubtedly 10
some 10
nervousness 10
was 10
growing 10
on 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
saw 10
a 10
whole 10
mass 10
of 10
phosphorescence 10
which 10
twinkled 10
like 10
stars 10
we 10
all 10
instinctively 10
drew 10
back 10
the 10
whole 10
place 10
was 10
becoming 10
alive 10
with 10
rats 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
or 10
two 10
we 10
stood 10
appalled 10
all 10
save 10
lord 10
godalming 10
who 10
was 10
seemingly 10
prepared 10
for 10
such 10
an 10
emergency 10
rushing 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
great 10
ironbound 10
oaken 10
door 10
which 10
dr 10
seward 10
had 10
described 10
from 10
the 10
outside 10
and 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
myself 10
he 10
turned 10
the 10
key 10
in 10
the 10
lock 10
drew 10
the 10
huge 10
bolts 10
and 10
swung 10
the 10
door 10
open 10
then 10
taking 10
his 10
little 10
silver 10
whistle 10
from 10
his 10
pocket 10
he 10
blew 10
a 10
low 10
shrill 10
call 10
it 10
was 10
answered 10
from 10
behind 10
dr 10
sewards 10
house 10
by 10
the 10
yelping 10
of 10
dogs 10
and 10
after 10
about 10
a 10
minute 10
three 10
terriers 10
came 10
dashing 10
round 10
the 10
corner 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
unconsciously 10
we 10
had 10
all 10
moved 10
towards 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
moved 10
i 10
noticed 10
that 10
the 10
dust 10
had 10
been 10
much 10
disturbed 10
the 10
boxes 10
which 10
had 10
been 10
taken 10
out 10
had 10
been 10
brought 10
this 10
way 10
but 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
minute 10
that 10
had 10
elapsed 10
the 10
number 10
of 10
the 10
rats 10
had 10
vastly 10
increased 10
they 10
seemed 10
to 10
swarm 10
over 10
the 10
place 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
till 10
the 10
lamplight 10
shining 10
on 10
their 10
moving 10
dark 10
bodies 10
and 10
glittering 10
baleful 10
eyes 10
made 10
the 10
place 10
look 10
like 10
a 10
bank 10
of 10
earth 10
set 10
with 10
fireflies 10
the 10
dogs 10
dashed 10
on 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
threshold 10
suddenly 10
stopped 10
and 10
snarled 10
and 10
then 10
simultaneously 10
lifting 10
their 10
noses 10
began 10
to 10
howl 10
in 10
most 10
lugubrious 10
fashion 10
the 10
rats 10
were 10
multiplying 10
in 10
thousands 10
and 10
we 10
moved 10
out 10
lord 10
godalming 10
lifted 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
dogs 10
and 10
carrying 10
him 10
in 10
placed 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
the 10
instant 10
his 10
feet 10
touched 10
the 10
ground 10
he 10
seemed 10
to 10
recover 10
his 10
courage 10
and 10
rushed 10
at 10
his 10
natural 10
enemies 10
they 10
fled 10
before 10
him 10
so 10
fast 10
that 10
before 10
he 10
had 10
shaken 10
the 10
life 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
score 10
the 10
other 10
dogs 10
who 10
had 10
by 10
now 10
been 10
lifted 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
manner 10
had 10
but 10
small 10
prey 10
ere 10
the 10
whole 10
mass 10
had 10
vanished 10
with 10
their 10
going 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
some 10
evil 10
presence 10
had 10
departed 10
for 10
the 10
dogs 10
frisked 10
about 10
and 10
barked 10
merrily 10
as 10
they 10
made 10
sudden 10
darts 10
at 10
their 10
prostrate 10
foes 10
and 10
turned 10
them 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
and 10
tossed 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
with 10
vicious 10
shakes 10
we 10
all 10
seemed 10
to 10
find 10
our 10
spirits 10
rise 10
whether 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
purifying 10
of 10
the 10
deadly 10
atmosphere 10
by 10
the 10
opening 10
of 10
the 10
chapel 10
door 10
or 10
the 10
relief 10
which 10
we 10
experienced 10
by 10
finding 10
ourselves 10
in 10
the 10
open 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
but 10
most 10
certainly 10
the 10
shadow 10
of 10
dread 10
seemed 10
to 10
slip 10
from 10
us 10
like 10
a 10
robe 10
and 10
the 10
occasion 10
of 10
our 10
coming 10
lost 10
something 10
of 10
its 10
grim 10
significance 10
though 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
slacken 10
a 10
whit 10
in 10
our 10
resolution 10
we 10
closed 10
the 10
outer 10
door 10
and 10
barred 10
and 10
locked 10
it 10
and 10
bringing 10
the 10
dogs 10
with 10
us 10
began 10
our 10
search 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
we 10
found 10
nothing 10
throughout 10
except 10
dust 10
in 10
extraordinary 10
proportions 10
and 10
all 10
untouched 10
save 10
for 10
my 10
own 10
footsteps 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
made 10
my 10
first 10
visit 10
never 10
once 10
did 10
the 10
dogs 10
exhibit 10
any 10
symptom 10
of 10
uneasiness 10
and 10
even 10
when 10
we 10
returned 10
to 10
the 10
chapel 10
they 10
frisked 10
about 10
as 10
though 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
rabbit 10
hunting 10
in 10
a 10
summer 10
wood 10
the 10
morning 10
was 10
quickening 10
in 10
the 10
east 10
when 10
we 10
emerged 10
from 10
the 10
front 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
taken 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
from 10
the 10
bunch 10
and 10
locked 10
the 10
door 10
in 10
orthodox 10
fashion 10
putting 10
the 10
key 10
into 10
his 10
pocket 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
done 10
so 10
far 10
he 10
said 10
our 10
night 10
has 10
been 10
eminently 10
successful 10
no 10
harm 10
has 10
come 10
to 10
us 10
such 10
as 10
i 10
feared 10
might 10
be 10
and 10
yet 10
we 10
have 10
ascertained 10
how 10
many 10
boxes 10
are 10
missing 10
more 10
than 10
all 10
do 10
i 10
rejoice 10
that 10
this 10
our 10
first 10
and 10
perhaps 10
our 10
most 10
difficult 10
and 10
dangerous 10
step 10
has 10
been 10
accomplished 10
without 10
the 10
bringing 10
thereinto 10
our 10
most 10
sweet 10
madam 10
mina 10
or 10
troubling 10
her 10
waking 10
or 10
sleeping 10
thoughts 10
with 10
sights 10
and 10
sounds 10
and 10
smells 10
of 10
horror 10
which 10
she 10
might 10
never 10
forget 10
one 10
lesson 10
too 10
we 10
have 10
learned 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
allowable 10
to 10
argue 10
a 10
particulari 10
that 10
the 10
brute 10
beasts 10
which 10
are 10
to 10
the 10
counts 10
command 10
are 10
yet 10
themselves 10
not 10
amenable 10
to 10
his 10
spiritual 10
power 10
for 10
look 10
these 10
rats 10
that 10
would 10
come 10
to 10
his 10
call 10
just 10
as 10
from 10
his 10
castle 10
top 10
he 10
summon 10
the 10
wolves 10
to 10
your 10
going 10
and 10
to 10
that 10
poor 10
mothers 10
cry 10
though 10
they 10
come 10
to 10
him 10
they 10
run 10
pellmell 10
from 10
the 10
so 10
little 10
dogs 10
of 10
my 10
friend 10
arthur 10
we 10
have 10
other 10
matters 10
before 10
us 10
other 10
dangers 10
other 10
fears 10
and 10
that 10
monster 10
he 10
has 10
not 10
used 10
his 10
power 10
over 10
the 10
brute 10
world 10
for 10
the 10
only 10
or 10
the 10
last 10
time 10
tonight 10
so 10
be 10
it 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
gone 10
elsewhere 10
good 10
it 10
has 10
given 10
us 10
opportunity 10
to 10
cry 10
checkin 10
some 10
ways 10
in 10
this 10
chess 10
game 10
which 10
we 10
play 10
for 10
the 10
stake 10
of 10
human 10
souls 10
and 10
now 10
let 10
us 10
go 10
home 10
the 10
dawn 10
is 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
and 10
we 10
have 10
reason 10
to 10
be 10
content 10
with 10
our 10
first 10
nights 10
work 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
ordained 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
many 10
nights 10
and 10
days 10
to 10
follow 10
if 10
full 10
of 10
peril 10
but 10
we 10
must 10
go 10
on 10
and 10
from 10
no 10
danger 10
shall 10
we 10
shrink 10
the 10
house 10
was 10
silent 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
back 10
save 10
for 10
some 10
poor 10
creature 10
who 10
was 10
screaming 10
away 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
distant 10
wards 10
and 10
a 10
low 10
moaning 10
sound 10
from 10
renfields 10
room 10
the 10
poor 10
wretch 10
was 10
doubtless 10
torturing 10
himself 10
after 10
the 10
manner 10
of 10
the 10
insane 10
with 10
needless 10
thoughts 10
of 10
pain 10
i 10
came 10
tiptoe 10
into 10
our 10
own 10
room 10
and 10
found 10
mina 10
asleep 10
breathing 10
so 10
softly 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
put 10
my 10
ear 10
down 10
to 10
hear 10
it 10
she 10
looks 10
paler 10
than 10
usual 10
i 10
hope 10
the 10
meeting 10
tonight 10
has 10
not 10
upset 10
her 10
i 10
am 10
truly 10
thankful 10
that 10
she 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
left 10
out 10
of 10
our 10
future 10
work 10
and 10
even 10
of 10
our 10
deliberations 10
it 10
is 10
too 10
great 10
a 10
strain 10
for 10
a 10
woman 10
to 10
bear 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
think 10
so 10
at 10
first 10
but 10
i 10
know 10
better 10
now 10
therefore 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
settled 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
things 10
which 10
would 10
frighten 10
her 10
to 10
hear 10
and 10
yet 10
to 10
conceal 10
them 10
from 10
her 10
might 10
be 10
worse 10
than 10
to 10
tell 10
her 10
if 10
once 10
she 10
suspected 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
any 10
concealment 10
henceforth 10
our 10
work 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
a 10
sealed 10
book 10
to 10
her 10
till 10
at 10
least 10
such 10
time 10
as 10
we 10
can 10
tell 10
her 10
that 10
all 10
is 10
finished 10
and 10
the 10
earth 10
free 10
from 10
a 10
monster 10
of 10
the 10
nether 10
world 10
i 10
daresay 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
difficult 10
to 10
begin 10
to 10
keep 10
silence 10
after 10
such 10
confidence 10
as 10
ours 10
but 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
resolute 10
and 10
tomorrow 10
i 10
shall 10
keep 10
dark 10
over 10
tonights 10
doings 10
and 10
shall 10
refuse 10
to 10
speak 10
of 10
anything 10
that 10
has 10
happened 10
i 10
rest 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
so 10
as 10
not 10
to 10
disturb 10
her 10
october 10
lateri 10
suppose 10
it 10
was 10
natural 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
all 10
overslept 10
ourselves 10
for 10
the 10
day 10
was 10
a 10
busy 10
one 10
and 10
the 10
night 10
had 10
no 10
rest 10
at 10
all 10
even 10
mina 10
must 10
have 10
felt 10
its 10
exhaustion 10
for 10
though 10
i 10
slept 10
till 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
high 10
i 10
was 10
awake 10
before 10
her 10
and 10
had 10
to 10
call 10
two 10
or 10
three 10
times 10
before 10
she 10
awoke 10
indeed 10
she 10
was 10
so 10
sound 10
asleep 10
that 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
recognize 10
me 10
but 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
with 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
blank 10
terror 10
as 10
one 10
looks 10
who 10
has 10
been 10
waked 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
bad 10
dream 10
she 10
complained 10
a 10
little 10
of 10
being 10
tired 10
and 10
i 10
let 10
her 10
rest 10
till 10
later 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
we 10
now 10
know 10
of 10
twentyone 10
boxes 10
having 10
been 10
removed 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
several 10
were 10
taken 10
in 10
any 10
of 10
these 10
removals 10
we 10
may 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
trace 10
them 10
all 10
such 10
will 10
of 10
course 10
immensely 10
simplify 10
our 10
labor 10
and 10
the 10
sooner 10
the 10
matter 10
is 10
attended 10
to 10
the 10
better 10
i 10
shall 10
look 10
up 10
thomas 10
snelling 10

octoberit 10
was 10
towards 10
noon 10
when 10
i 10
was 10
awakened 10
by 10
the 10
professor 10
walking 10
into 10
my 10
room 10
he 10
was 10
more 10
jolly 10
and 10
cheerful 10
than 10
usual 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
quite 10
evident 10
that 10
last 10
nights 10
work 10
has 10
helped 10
to 10
take 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
brooding 10
weight 10
off 10
his 10
mind 10
after 10
going 10
over 10
the 10
adventure 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
he 10
suddenly 10
said 10
your 10
patient 10
interests 10
me 10
much 10
may 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
with 10
you 10
i 10
visit 10
him 10
this 10
morning 10
or 10
if 10
that 10
you 10
are 10
too 10
occupy 10
i 10
can 10
go 10
alone 10
if 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
new 10
experience 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
find 10
a 10
lunatic 10
who 10
talk 10
philosophy 10
and 10
reason 10
so 10
sound 10
i 10
had 10
some 10
work 10
to 10
do 10
which 10
pressed 10
so 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
would 10
go 10
alone 10
i 10
would 10
be 10
glad 10
as 10
then 10
i 10
should 10
not 10
have 10
to 10
keep 10
him 10
waiting 10
so 10
i 10
called 10
an 10
attendant 10
and 10
gave 10
him 10
the 10
necessary 10
instructions 10
before 10
the 10
professor 10
left 10
the 10
room 10
i 10
cautioned 10
him 10
against 10
getting 10
any 10
false 10
impression 10
from 10
my 10
patient 10
but 10
he 10
answered 10
i 10
want 10
him 10
to 10
talk 10
of 10
himself 10
and 10
of 10
his 10
delusion 10
as 10
to 10
consuming 10
live 10
things 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
madam 10
mina 10
as 10
i 10
see 10
in 10
your 10
diary 10
of 10
yesterday 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
once 10
had 10
such 10
a 10
belief 10
why 10
do 10
you 10
smile 10
friend 10
john 10
excuse 10
me 10
i 10
said 10
but 10
the 10
answer 10
is 10
here 10
i 10
laid 10
my 10
hand 10
on 10
the 10
typewritten 10
matterwhen 10
our 10
sane 10
and 10
learned 10
lunatic 10
made 10
that 10
very 10
statement 10
of 10
how 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
consume 10
life 10
his 10
mouth 10
was 10
actually 10
nauseous 10
with 10
the 10
flies 10
and 10
spiders 10
which 10
he 10
had 10
eaten 10
just 10
before 10
mrs 10
harker 10
entered 10
the 10
room 10
van 10
helsing 10
smiled 10
in 10
turn 10
good 10
he 10
said 10
your 10
memory 10
is 10
true 10
friend 10
john 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
remembered 10
and 10
yet 10
it 10
is 10
this 10
very 10
obliquity 10
of 10
thought 10
and 10
memory 10
which 10
makes 10
mental 10
disease 10
such 10
a 10
fascinating 10
study 10
perhaps 10
i 10
may 10
gain 10
more 10
knowledge 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
folly 10
of 10
this 10
madman 10
than 10
i 10
shall 10
from 10
the 10
teaching 10
of 10
the 10
most 10
wise 10
who 10
knows 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
my 10
work 10
and 10
before 10
long 10
was 10
through 10
that 10
in 10
hand 10
it 10
seemed 10
that 10
the 10
time 10
had 10
been 10
very 10
short 10
indeed 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
van 10
helsing 10
back 10
in 10
the 10
study 10
do 10
i 10
interrupt 10
he 10
asked 10
politely 10
as 10
he 10
stood 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
not 10
at 10
all 10
i 10
answered 10
come 10
in 10
my 10
work 10
is 10
finished 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
free 10
i 10
can 10
go 10
with 10
you 10
now 10
if 10
you 10
like 10
it 10
is 10
needless 10
i 10
have 10
seen 10
him 10
well 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
appraise 10
me 10
at 10
much 10
our 10
interview 10
was 10
short 10
when 10
i 10
entered 10
his 10
room 10
he 10
was 10
sitting 10
on 10
a 10
stool 10
in 10
the 10
center 10
with 10
his 10
elbows 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
and 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
the 10
picture 10
of 10
sullen 10
discontent 10
i 10
spoke 10
to 10
him 10
as 10
cheerfully 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
and 10
with 10
such 10
a 10
measure 10
of 10
respect 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
assume 10
he 10
made 10
no 10
reply 10
whatever 10
dont 10
you 10
know 10
me 10
i 10
asked 10
his 10
answer 10
was 10
not 10
reassuring 10
i 10
know 10
you 10
well 10
enough 10
you 10
are 10
the 10
old 10
fool 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
wish 10
you 10
would 10
take 10
yourself 10
and 10
your 10
idiotic 10
brain 10
theories 10
somewhere 10
else 10
damn 10
all 10
thickheaded 10
dutchmen 10
not 10
a 10
word 10
more 10
would 10
he 10
say 10
but 10
sat 10
in 10
his 10
implacable 10
sullenness 10
as 10
indifferent 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
though 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
at 10
all 10
thus 10
departed 10
for 10
this 10
time 10
my 10
chance 10
of 10
much 10
learning 10
from 10
this 10
so 10
clever 10
lunatic 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
go 10
if 10
i 10
may 10
and 10
cheer 10
myself 10
with 10
a 10
few 10
happy 10
words 10
with 10
that 10
sweet 10
soul 10
madam 10
mina 10
friend 10
john 10
it 10
does 10
rejoice 10
me 10
unspeakable 10
that 10
she 10
is 10
no 10
more 10
to 10
be 10
pained 10
no 10
more 10
to 10
be 10
worried 10
with 10
our 10
terrible 10
things 10
though 10
we 10
shall 10
much 10
miss 10
her 10
help 10
it 10
is 10
better 10
so 10
i 10
agree 10
with 10
you 10
with 10
all 10
my 10
heart 10
i 10
answered 10
earnestly 10
for 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
want 10
him 10
to 10
weaken 10
in 10
this 10
matter 10
mrs 10
harker 10
is 10
better 10
out 10
of 10
it 10
things 10
are 10
quite 10
bad 10
enough 10
for 10
us 10
all 10
men 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
who 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
many 10
tight 10
places 10
in 10
our 10
time 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
place 10
for 10
a 10
woman 10
and 10
if 10
she 10
had 10
remained 10
in 10
touch 10
with 10
the 10
affair 10
it 10
would 10
in 10
time 10
infallibly 10
have 10
wrecked 10
her 10
so 10
van 10
helsing 10
has 10
gone 10
to 10
confer 10
with 10
mrs 10
harker 10
and 10
harker 10
quincey 10
and 10
art 10
are 10
all 10
out 10
following 10
up 10
the 10
clues 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
earth 10
boxes 10
i 10
shall 10
finish 10
my 10
round 10
of 10
work 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
meet 10
tonight 10
mina 10
harkers 10
journal 10
octoberit 10
is 10
strange 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
be 10
kept 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
as 10
i 10
am 10
today 10
after 10
jonathans 10
full 10
confidence 10
for 10
so 10
many 10
years 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
manifestly 10
avoid 10
certain 10
matters 10
and 10
those 10
the 10
most 10
vital 10
of 10
all 10
this 10
morning 10
i 10
slept 10
late 10
after 10
the 10
fatigues 10
of 10
yesterday 10
and 10
though 10
jonathan 10
was 10
late 10
too 10
he 10
was 10
the 10
earlier 10
he 10
spoke 10
to 10
me 10
before 10
he 10
went 10
out 10
never 10
more 10
sweetly 10
or 10
tenderly 10
but 10
he 10
never 10
mentioned 10
a 10
word 10
of 10
what 10
had 10
happened 10
in 10
the 10
visit 10
to 10
the 10
counts 10
house 10
and 10
yet 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
known 10
how 10
terribly 10
anxious 10
i 10
was 10
poor 10
dear 10
fellow 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
must 10
have 10
distressed 10
him 10
even 10
more 10
than 10
it 10
did 10
me 10
they 10
all 10
agreed 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
best 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
not 10
be 10
drawn 10
further 10
into 10
this 10
awful 10
work 10
and 10
i 10
acquiesced 10
but 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
he 10
keeps 10
anything 10
from 10
me 10
and 10
now 10
i 10
am 10
crying 10
like 10
a 10
silly 10
fool 10
when 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
comes 10
from 10
my 10
husbands 10
great 10
love 10
and 10
from 10
the 10
good 10
good 10
wishes 10
of 10
those 10
other 10
strong 10
men 10
that 10
has 10
done 10
me 10
good 10
well 10
some 10
day 10
jonathan 10
will 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
and 10
lest 10
it 10
should 10
ever 10
be 10
that 10
he 10
should 10
think 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
that 10
i 10
kept 10
anything 10
from 10
him 10
i 10
still 10
keep 10
my 10
journal 10
as 10
usual 10
then 10
if 10
he 10
has 10
feared 10
of 10
my 10
trust 10
i 10
shall 10
show 10
it 10
to 10
him 10
with 10
every 10
thought 10
of 10
my 10
heart 10
put 10
down 10
for 10
his 10
dear 10
eyes 10
to 10
read 10
i 10
feel 10
strangely 10
sad 10
and 10
lowspirited 10
today 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
the 10
reaction 10
from 10
the 10
terrible 10
excitement 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
when 10
the 10
men 10
had 10
gone 10
simply 10
because 10
they 10
told 10
me 10
to 10
i 10
didnt 10
feel 10
sleepy 10
and 10
i 10
did 10
feel 10
full 10
of 10
devouring 10
anxiety 10
i 10
kept 10
thinking 10
over 10
everything 10
that 10
has 10
been 10
ever 10
since 10
jonathan 10
came 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
in 10
london 10
and 10
it 10
all 10
seems 10
like 10
a 10
horrible 10
tragedy 10
with 10
fate 10
pressing 10
on 10
relentlessly 10
to 10
some 10
destined 10
end 10
everything 10
that 10
one 10
does 10
seems 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
right 10
it 10
me 10
be 10
to 10
bring 10
on 10
the 10
very 10
thing 10
which 10
is 10
most 10
to 10
be 10
deplored 10
if 10
i 10
hadnt 10
gone 10
to 10
whitby 10
perhaps 10
poor 10
dear 10
lucy 10
would 10
be 10
with 10
us 10
now 10
she 10
hadnt 10
taken 10
to 10
visiting 10
the 10
churchyard 10
till 10
i 10
came 10
and 10
if 10
she 10
hadnt 10
come 10
there 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
time 10
with 10
me 10
she 10
wouldnt 10
have 10
walked 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
and 10
if 10
she 10
hadnt 10
gone 10
there 10
at 10
night 10
and 10
asleep 10
that 10
monster 10
couldnt 10
have 10
destroyed 10
her 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
oh 10
why 10
did 10
i 10
ever 10
go 10
to 10
whitby 10
there 10
now 10
crying 10
again 10
i 10
wonder 10
what 10
has 10
come 10
over 10
me 10
today 10
i 10
must 10
hide 10
it 10
from 10
jonathan 10
for 10
if 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
crying 10
twice 10
in 10
one 10
morning 10
i 10
who 10
never 10
cried 10
on 10
my 10
own 10
account 10
and 10
whom 10
he 10
has 10
never 10
caused 10
to 10
shed 10
a 10
tear 10
the 10
dear 10
fellow 10
would 10
fret 10
his 10
heart 10
out 10
i 10
shall 10
put 10
a 10
bold 10
face 10
on 10
and 10
if 10
i 10
do 10
feel 10
weepy 10
he 10
shall 10
never 10
see 10
it 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
just 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
lessons 10
that 10
we 10
poor 10
women 10
have 10
to 10
learn 10
i 10
cant 10
quite 10
remember 10
how 10
i 10
fell 10
asleep 10
last 10
night 10
i 10
remember 10
hearing 10
the 10
sudden 10
barking 10
of 10
the 10
dogs 10
and 10
a 10
lot 10
of 10
queer 10
sounds 10
like 10
praying 10
on 10
a 10
very 10
tumultuous 10
scale 10
from 10
mr 10
renfields 10
room 10
which 10
is 10
somewhere 10
under 10
this 10
and 10
then 10
there 10
was 10
silence 10
over 10
everything 10
silence 10
so 10
profound 10
that 10
it 10
startled 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
got 10
up 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
all 10
was 10
dark 10
and 10
silent 10
the 10
black 10
shadows 10
thrown 10
by 10
the 10
moonlight 10
seeming 10
full 10
of 10
a 10
silent 10
mystery 10
of 10
their 10
own 10
not 10
a 10
thing 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
stirring 10
but 10
all 10
to 10
be 10
grim 10
and 10
fixed 10
as 10
death 10
or 10
fate 10
so 10
that 10
a 10
thin 10
streak 10
of 10
white 10
mist 10
that 10
crept 10
with 10
almost 10
imperceptible 10
slowness 10
across 10
the 10
grass 10
towards 10
the 10
house 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
sentience 10
and 10
a 10
vitality 10
of 10
its 10
own 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
the 10
digression 10
of 10
my 10
thoughts 10
must 10
have 10
done 10
me 10
good 10
for 10
when 10
i 10
got 10
back 10
to 10
bed 10
i 10
found 10
a 10
lethargy 10
creeping 10
over 10
me 10
i 10
lay 10
a 10
while 10
but 10
could 10
not 10
quite 10
sleep 10
so 10
i 10
got 10
out 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
again 10
the 10
mist 10
was 10
spreading 10
and 10
was 10
now 10
close 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
it 10
lying 10
thick 10
against 10
the 10
wall 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
were 10
stealing 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
windows 10
the 10
poor 10
man 10
was 10
more 10
loud 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
though 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
distinguish 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
could 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
recognize 10
in 10
his 10
tones 10
some 10
passionate 10
entreaty 10
on 10
his 10
part 10
then 10
there 10
was 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
a 10
struggle 10
and 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
the 10
attendants 10
were 10
dealing 10
with 10
him 10
i 10
was 10
so 10
frightened 10
that 10
i 10
crept 10
into 10
bed 10
and 10
pulled 10
the 10
clothes 10
over 10
my 10
head 10
putting 10
my 10
fingers 10
in 10
my 10
ears 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
then 10
a 10
bit 10
sleepy 10
at 10
least 10
so 10
i 10
thought 10
but 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
fallen 10
asleep 10
for 10
except 10
dreams 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
remember 10
anything 10
until 10
the 10
morning 10
when 10
jonathan 10
woke 10
me 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
it 10
took 10
me 10
an 10
effort 10
and 10
a 10
little 10
time 10
to 10
realize 10
where 10
i 10
was 10
and 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
jonathan 10
who 10
was 10
bending 10
over 10
me 10
my 10
dream 10
was 10
very 10
peculiar 10
and 10
was 10
almost 10
typical 10
of 10
the 10
way 10
that 10
waking 10
thoughts 10
become 10
merged 10
in 10
or 10
continued 10
in 10
dreams 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
asleep 10
and 10
waiting 10
for 10
jonathan 10
to 10
come 10
back 10
i 10
was 10
very 10
anxious 10
about 10
him 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
powerless 10
to 10
act 10
my 10
feet 10
and 10
my 10
hands 10
and 10
my 10
brain 10
were 10
weighted 10
so 10
that 10
nothing 10
could 10
proceed 10
at 10
the 10
usual 10
pace 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
slept 10
uneasily 10
and 10
thought 10
then 10
it 10
began 10
to 10
dawn 10
upon 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
air 10
was 10
heavy 10
and 10
dank 10
and 10
cold 10
i 10
put 10
back 10
the 10
clothes 10
from 10
my 10
face 10
and 10
found 10
to 10
my 10
surprise 10
that 10
all 10
was 10
dim 10
around 10
the 10
gaslight 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
left 10
lit 10
for 10
jonathan 10
but 10
turned 10
down 10
came 10
only 10
like 10
a 10
tiny 10
red 10
spark 10
through 10
the 10
fog 10
which 10
had 10
evidently 10
grown 10
thicker 10
and 10
poured 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
then 10
it 10
occurred 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
shut 10
the 10
window 10
before 10
i 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
bed 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
got 10
out 10
to 10
make 10
certain 10
on 10
the 10
point 10
but 10
some 10
leaden 10
lethargy 10
seemed 10
to 10
chain 10
my 10
limbs 10
and 10
even 10
my 10
will 10
i 10
lay 10
still 10
and 10
endured 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
i 10
closed 10
my 10
eyes 10
but 10
could 10
still 10
see 10
through 10
my 10
eyelids 10
it 10
is 10
wonderful 10
what 10
tricks 10
our 10
dreams 10
play 10
us 10
and 10
how 10
conveniently 10
we 10
can 10
imagine 10
the 10
mist 10
grew 10
thicker 10
and 10
thicker 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
now 10
how 10
it 10
came 10
in 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
it 10
like 10
smoke 10
or 10
with 10
the 10
white 10
energy 10
of 10
boiling 10
water 10
pouring 10
in 10
not 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
but 10
through 10
the 10
joinings 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
it 10
got 10
thicker 10
and 10
thicker 10
till 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
became 10
concentrated 10
into 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
pillar 10
of 10
cloud 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
through 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
light 10
of 10
the 10
gas 10
shining 10
like 10
a 10
red 10
eye 10
things 10
began 10
to 10
whirl 10
through 10
my 10
brain 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
cloudy 10
column 10
was 10
now 10
whirling 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
through 10
it 10
all 10
came 10
the 10
scriptural 10
words 10
a 10
pillar 10
of 10
cloud 10
by 10
day 10
and 10
of 10
fire 10
by 10
night 10
was 10
it 10
indeed 10
such 10
spiritual 10
guidance 10
that 10
was 10
coming 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
my 10
sleep 10
but 10
the 10
pillar 10
was 10
composed 10
of 10
both 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
the 10
night 10
guiding 10
for 10
the 10
fire 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
red 10
eye 10
which 10
at 10
the 10
thought 10
gat 10
a 10
new 10
fascination 10
for 10
me 10
till 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
the 10
fire 10
divided 10
and 10
seemed 10
to 10
shine 10
on 10
me 10
through 10
the 10
fog 10
like 10
two 10
red 10
eyes 10
such 10
as 10
lucy 10
told 10
me 10
of 10
in 10
her 10
momentary 10
mental 10
wandering 10
when 10
on 10
the 10
cliff 10
the 10
dying 10
sunlight 10
struck 10
the 10
windows 10
of 10
st 10
marys 10
church 10
suddenly 10
the 10
horror 10
burst 10
upon 10
me 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
thus 10
that 10
jonathan 10
had 10
seen 10
those 10
awful 10
women 10
growing 10
into 10
reality 10
through 10
the 10
whirling 10
mist 10
in 10
the 10
moonlight 10
and 10
in 10
my 10
dream 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
fainted 10
for 10
all 10
became 10
black 10
darkness 10
the 10
last 10
conscious 10
effort 10
which 10
imagination 10
made 10
was 10
to 10
show 10
me 10
a 10
livid 10
white 10
face 10
bending 10
over 10
me 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
mist 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
careful 10
of 10
such 10
dreams 10
for 10
they 10
would 10
unseat 10
ones 10
reason 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
too 10
much 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
would 10
get 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
or 10
dr 10
seward 10
to 10
prescribe 10
something 10
for 10
me 10
which 10
would 10
make 10
me 10
sleep 10
only 10
that 10
i 10
fear 10
to 10
alarm 10
them 10
such 10
a 10
dream 10
at 10
the 10
present 10
time 10
would 10
become 10
woven 10
into 10
their 10
fears 10
for 10
me 10
tonight 10
i 10
shall 10
strive 10
hard 10
to 10
sleep 10
naturally 10
if 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
i 10
shall 10
tomorrow 10
night 10
get 10
them 10
to 10
give 10
me 10
a 10
dose 10
of 10
chloral 10
that 10
cannot 10
hurt 10
me 10
for 10
once 10
and 10
it 10
will 10
give 10
me 10
a 10
good 10
nights 10
sleep 10
last 10
night 10
tired 10
me 10
more 10
than 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
slept 10
at 10
all 10
october 10
pmlast 10
night 10
i 10
slept 10
but 10
did 10
not 10
dream 10
i 10
must 10
have 10
slept 10
soundly 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
waked 10
by 10
jonathan 10
coming 10
to 10
bed 10
but 10
the 10
sleep 10
has 10
not 10
refreshed 10
me 10
for 10
today 10
i 10
feel 10
terribly 10
weak 10
and 10
spiritless 10
i 10
spent 10
all 10
yesterday 10
trying 10
to 10
read 10
or 10
lying 10
down 10
dozing 10
in 10
the 10
afternoon 10
mr 10
renfield 10
asked 10
if 10
he 10
might 10
see 10
me 10
poor 10
man 10
he 10
was 10
very 10
gentle 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
he 10
kissed 10
my 10
hand 10
and 10
bade 10
god 10
bless 10
me 10
some 10
way 10
it 10
affected 10
me 10
much 10
i 10
am 10
crying 10
when 10
i 10
think 10
of 10
him 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
new 10
weakness 10
of 10
which 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
careful 10
jonathan 10
would 10
be 10
miserable 10
if 10
he 10
knew 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
crying 10
he 10
and 10
the 10
others 10
were 10
out 10
till 10
dinner 10
time 10
and 10
they 10
all 10
came 10
in 10
tired 10
i 10
did 10
what 10
i 10
could 10
to 10
brighten 10
them 10
up 10
and 10
i 10
suppose 10
that 10
the 10
effort 10
did 10
me 10
good 10
for 10
i 10
forgot 10
how 10
tired 10
i 10
was 10
after 10
dinner 10
they 10
sent 10
me 10
to 10
bed 10
and 10
all 10
went 10
off 10
to 10
smoke 10
together 10
as 10
they 10
said 10
but 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
they 10
wanted 10
to 10
tell 10
each 10
other 10
of 10
what 10
had 10
occurred 10
to 10
each 10
during 10
the 10
day 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
from 10
jonathans 10
manner 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
something 10
important 10
to 10
communicate 10
i 10
was 10
not 10
so 10
sleepy 10
as 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
so 10
before 10
they 10
went 10
i 10
asked 10
dr 10
seward 10
to 10
give 10
me 10
a 10
little 10
opiate 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
slept 10
well 10
the 10
night 10
before 10
he 10
very 10
kindly 10
made 10
me 10
up 10
a 10
sleeping 10
draught 10
which 10
he 10
gave 10
to 10
me 10
telling 10
me 10
that 10
it 10
would 10
do 10
me 10
no 10
harm 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
very 10
mild 10
i 10
have 10
taken 10
it 10
and 10
am 10
waiting 10
for 10
sleep 10
which 10
still 10
keeps 10
aloof 10
i 10
hope 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
done 10
wrong 10
for 10
as 10
sleep 10
begins 10
to 10
flirt 10
with 10
me 10
a 10
new 10
fear 10
comes 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
foolish 10
in 10
thus 10
depriving 10
myself 10
of 10
the 10
power 10
of 10
waking 10
i 10
might 10
want 10
it 10
here 10
comes 10
sleep 10
goodnight 10

thomas 10
snelling 10
in 10
his 10
house 10
at 10
bethnal 10
green 10
but 10
unhappily 10
he 10
was 10
not 10
in 10
a 10
condition 10
to 10
remember 10
anything 10
the 10
very 10
prospect 10
of 10
beer 10
which 10
my 10
expected 10
coming 10
had 10
opened 10
to 10
him 10
had 10
proved 10
too 10
much 10
and 10
he 10
had 10
begun 10
too 10
early 10
on 10
his 10
expected 10
debauch 10
i 10
learned 10
however 10
from 10
his 10
wife 10
who 10
seemed 10
a 10
decent 10
poor 10
soul 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
only 10
the 10
assistant 10
of 10
smollet 10
who 10
of 10
the 10
two 10
mates 10
was 10
the 10
responsible 10
person 10
so 10
off 10
i 10
drove 10
to 10
walworth 10
and 10
found 10
mr 10
joseph 10
smollet 10
at 10
home 10
and 10
in 10
his 10
shirtsleeves 10
taking 10
a 10
late 10
tea 10
out 10
of 10
a 10
saucer 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
decent 10
intelligent 10
fellow 10
distinctly 10
a 10
good 10
reliable 10
type 10
of 10
workman 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
headpiece 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
he 10
remembered 10
all 10
about 10
the 10
incident 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
and 10
from 10
a 10
wonderful 10
dogeared 10
notebook 10
which 10
he 10
produced 10
from 10
some 10
mysterious 10
receptacle 10
about 10
the 10
seat 10
of 10
his 10
trousers 10
and 10
which 10
had 10
hieroglyphical 10
entries 10
in 10
thick 10
halfobliterated 10
pencil 10
he 10
gave 10
me 10
the 10
destinations 10
of 10
the 10
boxes 10
there 10
were 10
he 10
said 10
six 10
in 10
the 10
cartload 10
which 10
he 10
took 10
from 10
carfax 10
and 10
left 10
at 10
chicksand 10
street 10
mile 10
end 10
new 10
town 10
and 10
another 10
six 10
which 10
he 10
deposited 10
at 10
jamaica 10
lane 10
bermondsey 10
if 10
then 10
the 10
count 10
meant 10
to 10
scatter 10
these 10
ghastly 10
refuges 10
of 10
his 10
over 10
london 10
these 10
places 10
were 10
chosen 10
as 10
the 10
first 10
of 10
delivery 10
so 10
that 10
later 10
he 10
might 10
distribute 10
more 10
fully 10
the 10
systematic 10
manner 10
in 10
which 10
this 10
was 10
done 10
made 10
me 10
think 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
mean 10
to 10
confine 10
himself 10
to 10
two 10
sides 10
of 10
london 10
he 10
was 10
now 10
fixed 10
on 10
the 10
far 10
east 10
on 10
the 10
northern 10
shore 10
on 10
the 10
east 10
of 10
the 10
southern 10
shore 10
and 10
on 10
the 10
south 10
the 10
north 10
and 10
west 10
were 10
surely 10
never 10
meant 10
to 10
be 10
left 10
out 10
of 10
his 10
diabolical 10
scheme 10
let 10
alone 10
the 10
city 10
itself 10
and 10
the 10
very 10
heart 10
of 10
fashionable 10
london 10
in 10
the 10
southwest 10
and 10
west 10
i 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
smollet 10
and 10
asked 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
could 10
tell 10
us 10
if 10
any 10
other 10
boxes 10
had 10
been 10
taken 10
from 10
carfax 10
he 10
replied 10

it 10
would 10
be 10
worth 10
another 10
half 10

down 10

his 10
tea 10
and 10

fast 10
asleep 10
and 10
looks 10
a 10
little 10
too 10
pale 10
her 10
eyes 10
look 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
had 10
been 10
crying 10
poor 10
dear 10
ive 10
no 10
doubt 10
it 10
frets 10
her 10
to 10
be 10
kept 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
and 10
it 10
may 10
make 10
her 10
doubly 10
anxious 10
about 10
me 10
and 10
the 10
others 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
best 10
as 10
it 10
is 10
it 10
is 10
better 10
to 10
be 10
disappointed 10
and 10
worried 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
way 10
now 10
than 10
to 10
have 10
her 10
nerve 10
broken 10
the 10
doctors 10
were 10
quite 10
right 10
to 10
insist 10
on 10
her 10
being 10
kept 10
out 10
of 10
this 10
dreadful 10
business 10
i 10
must 10
be 10
firm 10
for 10
on 10
me 10
this 10
particular 10
burden 10
of 10
silence 10
must 10
rest 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
ever 10
enter 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
with 10
her 10
under 10
any 10
circumstances 10
indeed 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
a 10
hard 10
task 10
after 10
all 10
for 10
she 10
herself 10
has 10
become 10
reticent 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
and 10
has 10
not 10
spoken 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
or 10
his 10
doings 10
ever 10
since 10
we 10
told 10
her 10
of 10
our 10
decision 10
october 10
eveninga 10
long 10
and 10
trying 10
and 10
exciting 10
day 10
by 10
the 10
first 10
post 10
i 10
got 10
my 10
directed 10
envelope 10
with 10
a 10
dirty 10
scrap 10
of 10
paper 10
enclosed 10
on 10
which 10
was 10
written 10
with 10
a 10

for 10
the 10

i 10
got 10
the 10
letter 10
in 10
bed 10
and 10
rose 10
without 10
waking 10
mina 10
she 10
looked 10
heavy 10
and 10
sleepy 10
and 10
pale 10
and 10
far 10
from 10
well 10
i 10
determined 10
not 10
to 10
wake 10
her 10
but 10
that 10
when 10
i 10
should 10
return 10
from 10

new 10
search 10

would 10
arrange 10
for 10
her 10
going 10
back 10
to 10
exeter 10
i 10
think 10
she 10
would 10
be 10
happier 10
in 10
our 10
own 10
home 10
with 10
her 10
daily 10
tasks 10
to 10
interest 10
her 10
than 10
in 10
being 10
here 10
amongst 10
us 10
and 10
in 10
ignorance 10
i 10
only 10
saw 10
dr 10

a 10
moment 10
and 10

him 10

seemed 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
lesson 10
of 10
the 10
spelling 10
of 10
the 10
name 10
of 10
the 10
court 10
might 10
guide 10
me 10
what 10
are 10
you 10
i 10
asked 10
im 10
the 10
depity 10
he 10
answered 10
i 10
saw 10
at 10
once 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
right 10
track 10
phonetic 10
spelling 10
had 10
again 10
misled 10
me 10
a 10
half 10
crown 10
tip 10
put 10
the 10
deputys 10
knowledge 10
at 10
my 10
disposal 10
and 10
i 10
learned 10
that 10
mr 10
bloxam 10
who 10
had 10
slept 10
off 10
the 10
remains 10
of 10
his 10
beer 10
on 10
the 10
previous 10
night 10
at 10
corcorans 10
had 10
left 10
for 10
his 10
work 10
at 10
poplar 10
at 10
five 10
oclock 10
that 10
morning 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
tell 10
me 10
where 10
the 10
place 10
of 10
work 10
was 10
situated 10
but 10
he 10
had 10
a 10
vague 10
idea 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
some 10
kind 10
of 10
a 10
newfangled 10
wareus 10
and 10
with 10
this 10
slender 10
clue 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
start 10
for 10
poplar 10
it 10
was 10
twelve 10
oclock 10
before 10
i 10
got 10
any 10
satisfactory 10
hint 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
building 10
and 10
this 10
i 10
got 10
at 10
a 10
coffee 10
shop 10
where 10
some 10
workmen 10
were 10
having 10
their 10
dinner 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
suggested 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
being 10
erected 10
at 10
cross 10
angel 10
street 10
a 10
new 10
cold 10
storage 10
building 10
and 10
as 10
this 10
suited 10
the 10
condition 10
of 10
a 10
newfangled 10
wareus 10
i 10
at 10
once 10
drove 10
to 10
it 10
an 10
interview 10
with 10
a 10
surly 10
gatekeeper 10
and 10
a 10
surlier 10
foreman 10
both 10
of 10
whom 10
were 10
appeased 10
with 10
the 10
coin 10
of 10
the 10
realm 10
put 10
me 10
on 10
the 10
track 10
of 10
bloxam 10
he 10
was 10
sent 10
for 10
on 10
my 10
suggestion 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
willing 10
to 10
pay 10
his 10
days 10
wages 10
to 10
his 10
foreman 10
for 10
the 10
privilege 10
of 10
asking 10
him 10
a 10
few 10
questions 10
on 10
a 10
private 10
matter 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
smart 10
enough 10
fellow 10
though 10
rough 10
of 10
speech 10
and 10
bearing 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
promised 10
to 10
pay 10
for 10
his 10
information 10
and 10
given 10
him 10
an 10
earnest 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
made 10
two 10
journeys 10
between 10
carfax 10
and 10
a 10
house 10
in 10

by 10

for 10
this 10
purpose 10
i 10

him 10
if 10

tell 10
me 10
the 10
number 10
of 10

lot 10
of 10
them 10
went 10
away 10
cussin 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
with 10
this 10
description 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
the 10
house 10
so 10
having 10
paid 10
my 10
friend 10
for 10
his 10
information 10
i 10
started 10
off 10
for 10
piccadilly 10
i 10
had 10
gained 10
a 10
new 10
painful 10
experience 10
the 10
count 10
could 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
handle 10
the 10
earth 10
boxes 10
himself 10
if 10
so 10
time 10
was 10
precious 10
for 10
now 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
achieved 10
a 10
certain 10
amount 10
of 10
distribution 10
he 10
could 10
by 10
choosing 10
his 10
own 10
time 10
complete 10
the 10
task 10
unobserved 10
at 10
piccadilly 10
circus 10
i 10
discharged 10
my 10
cab 10
and 10
walked 10
westward 10
beyond 10
the 10
junior 10
constitutional 10
i 10
came 10
across 10
the 10
house 10
described 10
and 10
was 10
satisfied 10
that 10
this 10
was 10
the 10
next 10
of 10
the 10
lairs 10
arranged 10
by 10
dracula 10
the 10
house 10
looked 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
long 10
untenanted 10
the 10
windows 10
were 10
encrusted 10
with 10
dust 10
and 10
the 10
shutters 10
were 10
up 10
all 10
the 10
framework 10
was 10
black 10
with 10
time 10
and 10
from 10
the 10
iron 10
the 10
paint 10
had 10
mostly 10
scaled 10
away 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
up 10
to 10
lately 10
there 10
had 10
been 10
a 10
large 10
notice 10
board 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
the 10
balcony 10
it 10
had 10
however 10
been 10
roughly 10
torn 10
away 10
the 10
uprights 10
which 10
had 10
supported 10
it 10
still 10
remaining 10
behind 10
the 10
rails 10
of 10
the 10
balcony 10
i 10
saw 10
there 10
were 10
some 10
loose 10
boards 10
whose 10
raw 10
edges 10
looked 10
white 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
given 10
a 10
good 10
deal 10
to 10
have 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
notice 10
board 10
intact 10
as 10
it 10
would 10
perhaps 10
have 10
given 10
some 10
clue 10
to 10
the 10
ownership 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
remembered 10
my 10
experience 10
of 10
the 10
investigation 10
and 10
purchase 10
of 10
carfax 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
feel 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
find 10
the 10
former 10
owner 10
there 10
might 10
be 10
some 10
means 10
discovered 10
of 10
gaining 10
access 10
to 10
the 10
house 10
there 10
was 10
at 10
present 10
nothing 10
to 10
be 10
learned 10
from 10
the 10
piccadilly 10
side 10
and 10
nothing 10
could 10
be 10
done 10
so 10
i 10
went 10
around 10
to 10
the 10
back 10
to 10
see 10
if 10
anything 10
could 10
be 10
gathered 10
from 10
this 10
quarter 10
the 10
mews 10
were 10
active 10
the 10
piccadilly 10
houses 10
being 10
mostly 10
in 10
occupation 10
i 10
asked 10
one 10
or 10
two 10
of 10
the 10
grooms 10
and 10
helpers 10
whom 10
i 10
saw 10
around 10
if 10
they 10
could 10
tell 10
me 10
anything 10
about 10
the 10
empty 10
house 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
heard 10
it 10
had 10
lately 10
been 10
taken 10
but 10
he 10
couldnt 10
say 10
from 10
whom 10
he 10
told 10
me 10
however 10
that 10
up 10
to 10
very 10
lately 10
there 10
had 10
been 10
a 10
notice 10
board 10
of 10
for 10
sale 10
up 10
and 10
that 10
perhaps 10
mitchell 10
sons 10
candy 10
the 10
house 10
agents 10
could 10
tell 10
me 10
something 10
as 10
he 10
thought 10
he 10
remembered 10
seeing 10
the 10
name 10
of 10
that 10
firm 10
on 10
the 10
board 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
wish 10
to 10
seem 10
too 10
eager 10
or 10
to 10
let 10
my 10
informant 10
know 10
or 10
guess 10
too 10
much 10
so 10
thanking 10
him 10
in 10
the 10
usual 10
manner 10
i 10
strolled 10
away 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
growing 10
dusk 10
and 10
the 10
autumn 10
night 10
was 10
closing 10
in 10
so 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
lose 10
any 10
time 10
having 10
learned 10
the 10
address 10
of 10
mitchell 10
sons 10
candy 10
from 10
a 10
directory 10
at 10
the 10
berkeley 10
i 10
was 10
soon 10
at 10
their 10
office 10
in 10
sackville 10
street 10
the 10
gentleman 10
who 10
saw 10
me 10
was 10
particularly 10
suave 10
in 10
manner 10
but 10
uncommunicative 10
in 10
equal 10
proportion 10
having 10
once 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
piccadilly 10
house 10
which 10
throughout 10
our 10
interview 10
he 10
called 10
a 10
mansion 10
was 10
sold 10
he 10
considered 10
my 10
business 10
as 10
concluded 10
when 10
i 10
asked 10
who 10
had 10
purchased 10
it 10
he 10
opened 10
his 10
eyes 10
a 10
thought 10
wider 10
and 10
paused 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
before 10
replying 10
it 10
is 10
sold 10
sir 10
pardon 10
me 10
i 10
said 10
with 10
equal 10
politeness 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
a 10
special 10
reason 10
for 10
wishing 10
to 10
know 10
who 10
purchased 10
it 10
again 10
he 10
paused 10
longer 10
and 10
raised 10
his 10
eyebrows 10
still 10
more 10
it 10
is 10
sold 10
sir 10
was 10
again 10
his 10
laconic 10
reply 10
surely 10
i 10
said 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
mind 10
letting 10
me 10
know 10
so 10
much 10
but 10
i 10
do 10
mind 10
he 10
answered 10
the 10
affairs 10
of 10
their 10
clients 10
are 10
absolutely 10
safe 10
in 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
mitchell 10
sons 10
candy 10
this 10
was 10
manifestly 10
a 10
prig 10
of 10
the 10
first 10
water 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
use 10
arguing 10
with 10
him 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
had 10
best 10
meet 10
him 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
ground 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
your 10
clients 10
sir 10
are 10
happy 10
in 10
having 10
so 10
resolute 10
a 10
guardian 10
of 10
their 10
confidence 10
i 10
am 10
myself 10
a 10
professional 10
man 10
here 10
i 10
handed 10
him 10
my 10
card 10
in 10
this 10
instance 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
prompted 10
by 10
curiosity 10
i 10
act 10
on 10
the 10
part 10
of 10
lord 10
godalming 10
who 10
wishes 10
to 10
know 10
something 10
of 10
the 10
property 10
which 10
was 10
he 10
understood 10
lately 10
for 10
sale 10
these 10
words 10
put 10
a 10
different 10
complexion 10
on 10
affairs 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
would 10
like 10
to 10
oblige 10
you 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
mr 10
harker 10
and 10
especially 10
would 10
i 10
like 10
to 10
oblige 10
his 10
lordship 10
we 10
once 10
carried 10
out 10
a 10
small 10
matter 10
of 10
renting 10
some 10
chambers 10
for 10
him 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
the 10
honorable 10
arthur 10
holmwood 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
let 10
me 10
have 10
his 10
lordships 10
address 10
i 10
will 10
consult 10
the 10
house 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
and 10
will 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
communicate 10
with 10
his 10
lordship 10
by 10
tonights 10
post 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
pleasure 10
if 10
we 10
can 10
so 10
far 10
deviate 10
from 10
our 10
rules 10
as 10
to 10
give 10
the 10
required 10
information 10
to 10
his 10
lordship 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
secure 10
a 10
friend 10
and 10
not 10
to 10
make 10
an 10
enemy 10
so 10
i 10
thanked 10
him 10
gave 10
the 10
address 10
at 10
dr 10
sewards 10
and 10
came 10
away 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
dark 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
tired 10
and 10
hungry 10
i 10
got 10
a 10
cup 10
of 10
tea 10
at 10
the 10
aerated 10
bread 10
company 10
and 10
came 10
down 10
to 10
purfleet 10
by 10
the 10
next 10
train 10
i 10
found 10
all 10
the 10
others 10
at 10
home 10
mina 10
was 10
looking 10
tired 10
and 10
pale 10
but 10
she 10
made 10
a 10
gallant 10
effort 10
to 10
be 10
bright 10
and 10
cheerful 10
it 10
wrung 10
my 10
heart 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
had 10
to 10
keep 10
anything 10
from 10
her 10
and 10
so 10
caused 10
her 10
inquietude 10
thank 10
god 10
this 10
will 10
be 10
the 10
last 10
night 10
of 10
her 10
looking 10
on 10
at 10
our 10
conferences 10
and 10
feeling 10
the 10
sting 10
of 10
our 10
not 10
showing 10
our 10
confidence 10
it 10
took 10
all 10
my 10
courage 10
to 10
hold 10
to 10
the 10
wise 10
resolution 10
of 10
keeping 10
her 10
out 10
of 10
our 10
grim 10
task 10
she 10
seems 10
somehow 10
more 10
reconciled 10
or 10
else 10
the 10
very 10
subject 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
become 10
repugnant 10
to 10
her 10
for 10
when 10
any 10
accidental 10
allusion 10
is 10
made 10
she 10
actually 10
shudders 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
we 10
made 10
our 10
resolution 10
in 10
time 10
as 10
with 10
such 10
a 10
feeling 10
as 10
this 10
our 10
growing 10
knowledge 10
would 10
be 10
torture 10
to 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
tell 10
the 10
others 10
of 10
the 10
days 10
discovery 10
till 10
we 10
were 10
alone 10
so 10
after 10
dinner 10
followed 10
by 10
a 10
little 10
music 10
to 10
save 10
appearances 10
even 10
amongst 10
ourselves 10
i 10
took 10
mina 10
to 10
her 10
room 10
and 10
left 10
her 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
the 10
dear 10
girl 10
was 10
more 10
affectionate 10
with 10
me 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
clung 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
would 10
detain 10
me 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
much 10
to 10
be 10
talked 10
of 10
and 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
thank 10
god 10
the 10
ceasing 10
of 10
telling 10
things 10
has 10
made 10
no 10
difference 10
between 10
us 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
down 10
again 10
i 10
found 10
the 10
others 10
all 10
gathered 10
round 10
the 10
fire 10
in 10
the 10
study 10
in 10
the 10
train 10
i 10
had 10
written 10
my 10
diary 10
so 10
far 10
and 10
simply 10
read 10
it 10
off 10
to 10
them 10
as 10
the 10
best 10
means 10
of 10
letting 10
them 10
get 10
abreast 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
information 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
this 10
has 10
been 10
a 10
great 10
days 10
work 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
doubtless 10
we 10
are 10
on 10
the 10
track 10
of 10
the 10
missing 10
boxes 10
if 10
we 10
find 10
them 10
all 10
in 10
that 10
house 10
then 10
our 10
work 10
is 10
near 10
the 10
end 10
but 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
some 10
missing 10
we 10
must 10
search 10
until 10
we 10
find 10
them 10
then 10
shall 10
we 10
make 10
our 10
final 10
coup 10
and 10
hunt 10
the 10
wretch 10
to 10
his 10
real 10
death 10
we 10
all 10
sat 10
silent 10
awhile 10
and 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
mr 10
morris 10
spoke 10
say 10
how 10
are 10
we 10
going 10
to 10
get 10
into 10
that 10
house 10
we 10
got 10
into 10
the 10
other 10
answered 10
lord 10
godalming 10
quickly 10
but 10
art 10
this 10
is 10
different 10
we 10
broke 10
house 10
at 10
carfax 10
but 10
we 10
had 10
night 10
and 10
a 10
walled 10
park 10
to 10
protect 10
us 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
mighty 10
different 10
thing 10
to 10
commit 10
burglary 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
either 10
by 10
day 10
or 10
night 10
i 10
confess 10
i 10
dont 10
see 10
how 10
we 10
are 10
going 10
to 10
get 10
in 10
unless 10
that 10
agency 10
duck 10
can 10
find 10
us 10
a 10
key 10
of 10
some 10
sort 10
lord 10
godalmings 10
brows 10
contracted 10
and 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
walked 10
about 10
the 10
room 10
byandby 10
he 10
stopped 10
and 10
said 10
turning 10
from 10
one 10
to 10
another 10
of 10
us 10
quinceys 10
head 10
is 10
level 10
this 10
burglary 10
business 10
is 10
getting 10
serious 10
we 10
got 10
off 10
once 10
all 10
right 10
but 10
we 10
have 10
now 10
a 10
rare 10
job 10
on 10
hand 10
unless 10
we 10
can 10
find 10
the 10
counts 10
key 10
basket 10
as 10
nothing 10
could 10
well 10
be 10
done 10
before 10
morning 10
and 10
as 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
at 10
least 10
advisable 10
to 10
wait 10
till 10
lord 10
godalming 10
should 10
hear 10
from 10
mitchells 10
we 10
decided 10
not 10
to 10
take 10
any 10
active 10
step 10
before 10
breakfast 10
time 10
for 10
a 10
good 10
while 10
we 10
sat 10
and 10
smoked 10
discussing 10
the 10
matter 10
in 10
its 10
various 10
lights 10
and 10
bearings 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
opportunity 10
of 10
bringing 10
this 10
diary 10
right 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
moment 10
i 10
am 10
very 10
sleepy 10
and 10
shall 10
go 10
to 10
bed 10
just 10
a 10
line 10
mina 10
sleeps 10
soundly 10
and 10
her 10
breathing 10
is 10
regular 10
her 10
forehead 10
is 10
puckered 10
up 10
into 10
little 10
wrinkles 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
thinks 10
even 10
in 10
her 10
sleep 10
she 10
is 10
still 10
too 10
pale 10
but 10
does 10
not 10
look 10
so 10
haggard 10
as 10
she 10
did 10
this 10
morning 10
tomorrow 10
will 10
i 10
hope 10
mend 10
all 10
this 10
she 10
will 10
be 10
herself 10
at 10
home 10
in 10
exeter 10
oh 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
sleepy 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
octoberi 10
am 10
puzzled 10
afresh 10
about 10
renfield 10
his 10
moods 10
change 10
so 10
rapidly 10
that 10
i 10
find 10
it 10
difficult 10
to 10
keep 10
touch 10
of 10
them 10
and 10
as 10
they 10
always 10
mean 10
something 10
more 10
than 10
his 10
own 10
wellbeing 10
they 10
form 10
a 10
more 10
than 10
interesting 10
study 10
this 10
morning 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
after 10
his 10
repulse 10
of 10
van 10
helsing 10
his 10
manner 10
was 10
that 10
of 10
a 10
man 10
commanding 10
destiny 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
fact 10
commanding 10
destiny 10
subjectively 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
really 10
care 10
for 10
any 10
of 10
the 10
things 10
of 10
mere 10
earth 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
clouds 10
and 10
looked 10
down 10
on 10
all 10
the 10
weaknesses 10
and 10
wants 10
of 10
us 10
poor 10
mortals 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
improve 10
the 10
occasion 10
and 10
learn 10
something 10
so 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
what 10
about 10
the 10
flies 10
these 10
times 10
he 10
smiled 10
on 10
me 10
in 10
quite 10
a 10
superior 10
sort 10
of 10
way 10
such 10
a 10
smile 10
as 10
would 10
have 10
become 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
malvolio 10
as 10
he 10
answered 10
me 10
the 10
fly 10
my 10
dear 10
sir 10
has 10
one 10
striking 10
feature 10
its 10
wings 10
are 10
typical 10
of 10
the 10
aerial 10
powers 10
of 10
the 10
psychic 10
faculties 10
the 10
ancients 10
did 10
well 10
when 10
they 10
typified 10
the 10
soul 10
as 10
a 10
butterfly 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
push 10
his 10
analogy 10
to 10
its 10
utmost 10
logically 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
quickly 10
oh 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
soul 10
you 10
are 10
after 10
now 10
is 10
it 10
his 10
madness 10
foiled 10
his 10
reason 10
and 10
a 10
puzzled 10
look 10
spread 10
over 10
his 10
face 10
as 10
shaking 10
his 10
head 10
with 10
a 10
decision 10
which 10
i 10
had 10
but 10
seldom 10
seen 10
in 10
him 10
he 10
said 10
oh 10
no 10
oh 10
no 10
i 10
want 10
no 10
souls 10
life 10
is 10
all 10
i 10
want 10
here 10
he 10
brightened 10
up 10
i 10
am 10
pretty 10
indifferent 10
about 10
it 10
at 10
present 10
life 10
is 10
all 10
right 10
i 10
have 10
all 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
must 10
get 10
a 10
new 10
patient 10
doctor 10
if 10
you 10
wish 10
to 10
study 10
zoophagy 10
this 10
puzzled 10
me 10
a 10
little 10
so 10
i 10
drew 10
him 10
on 10
then 10
you 10
command 10
life 10
you 10
are 10
a 10
god 10
i 10
suppose 10
he 10
smiled 10
with 10
an 10
ineffably 10
benign 10
superiority 10
oh 10
no 10
far 10
be 10
it 10
from 10
me 10
to 10
arrogate 10
to 10
myself 10
the 10
attributes 10
of 10
the 10
deity 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
even 10
concerned 10
in 10
his 10
especially 10
spiritual 10
doings 10
if 10
i 10
may 10
state 10
my 10
intellectual 10
position 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
concerns 10
things 10
purely 10
terrestrial 10
somewhat 10
in 10
the 10
position 10
which 10
enoch 10
occupied 10
spiritually 10
this 10
was 10
a 10
poser 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
recall 10
enochs 10
appositeness 10
so 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
ask 10
a 10
simple 10
question 10
though 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
by 10
so 10
doing 10
i 10
was 10
lowering 10
myself 10
in 10
the 10
eyes 10
of 10
the 10
lunatic 10
and 10
why 10
with 10
enoch 10
because 10
he 10
walked 10
with 10
god 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
the 10
analogy 10
but 10
did 10
not 10
like 10
to 10
admit 10
it 10
so 10
i 10
harked 10
back 10
to 10
what 10
he 10
had 10
denied 10
so 10
you 10
dont 10
care 10
about 10
life 10
and 10
you 10
dont 10
want 10
souls 10
why 10
not 10
i 10
put 10
my 10
question 10
quickly 10
and 10
somewhat 10
sternly 10
on 10
purpose 10
to 10
disconcert 10
him 10
the 10
effort 10
succeeded 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
he 10
unconsciously 10
relapsed 10
into 10
his 10
old 10
servile 10
manner 10
bent 10
low 10
before 10
me 10
and 10
actually 10
fawned 10
upon 10
me 10
as 10
he 10
replied 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
any 10
souls 10
indeed 10
indeed 10
i 10
dont 10
i 10
couldnt 10
use 10
them 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
them 10
they 10
would 10
be 10
no 10
manner 10
of 10
use 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
couldnt 10
eat 10
them 10
or 10
he 10
suddenly 10
stopped 10
and 10
the 10
old 10
cunning 10
look 10
spread 10
over 10
his 10
face 10
like 10
a 10
wind 10
sweep 10
on 10
the 10
surface 10
of 10
the 10
water 10
and 10
doctor 10
as 10
to 10
life 10
what 10
is 10
it 10
after 10
all 10
when 10
youve 10
got 10
all 10
you 10
require 10
and 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
you 10
will 10
never 10
want 10
that 10
is 10
all 10
i 10
have 10
friends 10
good 10
friends 10
like 10
you 10
dr 10
sewardthis 10
was 10
said 10
with 10
a 10
leer 10
of 10
inexpressible 10
cunning 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
lack 10
the 10
means 10
of 10
life 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
through 10
the 10
cloudiness 10
of 10
his 10
insanity 10
he 10
saw 10
some 10
antagonism 10
in 10
me 10
for 10
he 10
at 10
once 10
fell 10
back 10
on 10
the 10
last 10
refuge 10
of 10
such 10
as 10
he 10
a 10
dogged 10
silence 10
after 10
a 10
short 10
time 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
for 10
the 10
present 10
it 10
was 10
useless 10
to 10
speak 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
sulky 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
later 10
in 10
the 10
day 10
he 10
sent 10
for 10
me 10
ordinarily 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
have 10
come 10
without 10
special 10
reason 10
but 10
just 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
interested 10
in 10
him 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
gladly 10
make 10
an 10
effort 10
besides 10
i 10
am 10
glad 10
to 10
have 10
anything 10
to 10
help 10
pass 10
the 10
time 10
harker 10
is 10
out 10
following 10
up 10
clues 10
and 10
so 10
are 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
quincey 10
van 10
helsing 10
sits 10
in 10
my 10
study 10
poring 10
over 10
the 10
record 10
prepared 10
by 10
the 10
harkers 10
he 10
seems 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
by 10
accurate 10
knowledge 10
of 10
all 10
details 10
he 10
will 10
light 10
up 10
on 10
some 10
clue 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
wish 10
to 10
be 10
disturbed 10
in 10
the 10
work 10
without 10
cause 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
taken 10
him 10
with 10
me 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
patient 10
only 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
after 10
his 10
last 10
repulse 10
he 10
might 10
not 10
care 10
to 10
go 10
again 10
there 10
was 10
also 10
another 10
reason 10
renfield 10
might 10
not 10
speak 10
so 10
freely 10
before 10
a 10
third 10
person 10
as 10
when 10
he 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
alone 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
sitting 10
in 10
the 10
middle 10
of 10
the 10
floor 10
on 10
his 10
stool 10
a 10
pose 10
which 10
is 10
generally 10
indicative 10
of 10
some 10
mental 10
energy 10
on 10
his 10
part 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
in 10
he 10
said 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
question 10
had 10
been 10
waiting 10
on 10
his 10
lips 10
what 10
about 10
souls 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
then 10
that 10
my 10
surmise 10
had 10
been 10
correct 10
unconscious 10
cerebration 10
was 10
doing 10
its 10
work 10
even 10
with 10
the 10
lunatic 10
i 10
determined 10
to 10
have 10
the 10
matter 10
out 10
what 10
about 10
them 10
yourself 10
i 10
asked 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
reply 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
but 10
looked 10
all 10
around 10
him 10
and 10
up 10
and 10
down 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
expected 10
to 10
find 10
some 10
inspiration 10
for 10
an 10
answer 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
any 10
souls 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
feeble 10
apologetic 10
way 10
the 10
matter 10
seemed 10
preying 10
on 10
his 10
mind 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
determined 10
to 10
use 10
it 10
to 10
be 10
cruel 10
only 10
to 10
be 10
kind 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
you 10
like 10
life 10
and 10
you 10
want 10
life 10
oh 10
yes 10
but 10
that 10
is 10
all 10
right 10
you 10
neednt 10
worry 10
about 10
that 10
but 10
i 10
asked 10
how 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
get 10
the 10
life 10
without 10
getting 10
the 10
soul 10
also 10
this 10
seemed 10
to 10
puzzle 10
him 10
so 10
i 10
followed 10
it 10
up 10
a 10
nice 10
time 10
youll 10
have 10
some 10
time 10
when 10
youre 10
flying 10
out 10
here 10
with 10
the 10
souls 10
of 10
thousands 10
of 10
flies 10
and 10
spiders 10
and 10
birds 10
and 10
cats 10
buzzing 10
and 10
twittering 10
and 10
moaning 10
all 10
around 10
you 10
youve 10
got 10
their 10
lives 10
you 10
know 10
and 10
you 10
must 10
put 10
up 10
with 10
their 10
souls 10
something 10
seemed 10
to 10
affect 10
his 10
imagination 10
for 10
he 10
put 10
his 10
fingers 10
to 10
his 10
ears 10
and 10
shut 10
his 10
eyes 10
screwing 10
them 10
up 10
tightly 10
just 10
as 10
a 10
small 10
boy 10
does 10
when 10
his 10
face 10
is 10
being 10
soaped 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
pathetic 10
in 10
it 10
that 10
touched 10
me 10
it 10
also 10
gave 10
me 10
a 10
lesson 10
for 10
it 10
seemed 10
that 10
before 10
me 10
was 10
a 10
child 10
only 10
a 10
child 10
though 10
the 10
features 10
were 10
worn 10
and 10
the 10
stubble 10
on 10
the 10
jaws 10
was 10
white 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
undergoing 10
some 10
process 10
of 10
mental 10
disturbance 10
and 10
knowing 10
how 10
his 10
past 10
moods 10
had 10
interpreted 10
things 10
seemingly 10
foreign 10
to 10
himself 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
enter 10
into 10
his 10
mind 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
and 10
go 10
with 10
him 10
the 10
first 10
step 10
was 10
to 10
restore 10
confidence 10
so 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
speaking 10
pretty 10
loud 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
hear 10
me 10
through 10
his 10
closed 10
ears 10
would 10
you 10
like 10
some 10
sugar 10
to 10
get 10
your 10
flies 10
around 10
again 10
he 10
seemed 10
to 10
wake 10
up 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
shook 10
his 10
head 10
with 10
a 10
laugh 10
he 10
replied 10
not 10
much 10
flies 10
are 10
poor 10
things 10
after 10
all 10
after 10
a 10
pause 10
he 10
added 10
but 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
their 10
souls 10
buzzing 10
round 10
me 10
all 10
the 10
same 10
or 10
spiders 10
i 10
went 10
on 10
blow 10
spiders 10
whats 10
the 10
use 10
of 10
spiders 10
there 10
isnt 10
anything 10
in 10
them 10
to 10
eat 10
or 10
he 10
stopped 10
suddenly 10
as 10
though 10
reminded 10
of 10
a 10
forbidden 10
topic 10
so 10
so 10
i 10
thought 10
to 10
myself 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
second 10
time 10
he 10
has 10
suddenly 10
stopped 10
at 10
the 10
word 10
drink 10
what 10
does 10
it 10
mean 10
renfield 10
seemed 10
himself 10
aware 10
of 10
having 10
made 10
a 10
lapse 10
for 10
he 10
hurried 10
on 10
as 10
though 10
to 10
distract 10
my 10
attention 10
from 10
it 10
i 10
dont 10
take 10
any 10
stock 10
at 10
all 10
in 10
such 10
matters 10
rats 10
and 10
mice 10
and 10
such 10
small 10
deer 10
as 10
shakespeare 10
has 10
it 10
chicken 10
feed 10
of 10
the 10
larder 10
they 10
might 10
be 10
called 10
im 10
past 10
all 10
that 10
sort 10
of 10
nonsense 10
you 10
might 10
as 10
well 10
ask 10
a 10
man 10
to 10
eat 10
molecules 10
with 10
a 10
pair 10
of 10
chopsticks 10
as 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
interest 10
me 10
about 10
the 10
less 10
carnivora 10
when 10
i 10
know 10
of 10
what 10
is 10
before 10
me 10
i 10
see 10
i 10
saidyou 10
want 10
big 10
things 10
that 10
you 10
can 10
make 10
your 10
teeth 10
meet 10
in 10
how 10
would 10
you 10
like 10
to 10
breakfast 10
on 10
an 10
elephant 10
what 10
ridiculous 10
nonsense 10
you 10
are 10
talking 10
he 10
was 10
getting 10
too 10
wide 10
awake 10
so 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
would 10
press 10
him 10
hard 10
i 10
wonder 10
i 10
said 10
reflectively 10
what 10
an 10
elephants 10
soul 10
is 10
like 10
the 10
effect 10
i 10
desired 10
was 10
obtained 10
for 10
he 10
at 10
once 10
fell 10
from 10
his 10
highhorse 10
and 10
became 10
a 10
child 10
again 10
i 10
dont 10
want 10
an 10
elephants 10
soul 10
or 10
any 10
soul 10
at 10
all 10
he 10
said 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
he 10
sat 10
despondently 10
suddenly 10
he 10
jumped 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10
with 10
his 10
eyes 10
blazing 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
signs 10
of 10
intense 10
cerebral 10
excitement 10
to 10
hell 10
with 10
you 10
and 10
your 10
souls 10
he 10
shouted 10
why 10
do 10
you 10
plague 10
me 10
about 10
souls 10
havent 10
i 10
got 10
enough 10
to 10
worry 10
and 10
pain 10
to 10
distract 10
me 10
already 10
without 10
thinking 10
of 10
souls 10
he 10
looked 10
so 10
hostile 10
that 10
i 10
thought 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
for 10
another 10
homicidal 10
fit 10
so 10
i 10
blew 10
my 10
whistle 10
the 10
instant 10
however 10
that 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
he 10
became 10
calm 10
and 10
said 10
apologetically 10
forgive 10
me 10
doctor 10
i 10
forgot 10
myself 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
need 10
any 10
help 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
worried 10
in 10
my 10
mind 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
apt 10
to 10
be 10
irritable 10
if 10
you 10
only 10
knew 10
the 10
problem 10
i 10
have 10
to 10
face 10
and 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
working 10
out 10
you 10
would 10
pity 10
and 10
tolerate 10
and 10
pardon 10
me 10
pray 10
do 10
not 10
put 10
me 10
in 10
a 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
think 10
and 10
i 10
cannot 10
think 10
freely 10
when 10
my 10
body 10
is 10
confined 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
you 10
will 10
understand 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
selfcontrol 10
so 10
when 10
the 10
attendants 10
came 10
i 10
told 10
them 10
not 10
to 10
mind 10
and 10
they 10
withdrew 10
renfield 10
watched 10
them 10
go 10
when 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
closed 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
considerable 10
dignity 10
and 10
sweetness 10
dr 10
seward 10
you 10
have 10
been 10
very 10
considerate 10
towards 10
me 10
believe 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
very 10
very 10
grateful 10
to 10
you 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
well 10
to 10
leave 10
him 10
in 10
this 10
mood 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
came 10
away 10
there 10
is 10
certainly 10
something 10
to 10
ponder 10
over 10
in 10
this 10
mans 10
state 10
several 10
points 10
seem 10
to 10
make 10
what 10
the 10
american 10
interviewer 10
calls 10
a 10
story 10
if 10
one 10
could 10
only 10
get 10
them 10
in 10
proper 10
order 10
here 10
they 10
are 10
will 10
not 10
mention 10
drinking 10
fears 10
the 10
thought 10
of 10
being 10
burdened 10
with 10
the 10
soul 10
of 10
anything 10
has 10
no 10
dread 10
of 10
wanting 10
life 10
in 10
the 10
future 10
despises 10
the 10
meaner 10
forms 10
of 10
life 10
altogether 10
though 10
he 10
dreads 10
being 10
haunted 10
by 10
their 10
souls 10
logically 10
all 10
these 10
things 10
point 10
one 10
way 10
he 10
has 10
assurance 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
that 10
he 10
will 10
acquire 10
some 10
higher 10
life 10
he 10
dreads 10
the 10
consequence 10
the 10
burden 10
of 10
a 10
soul 10
then 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
human 10
life 10
he 10
looks 10
to 10
and 10
the 10
assurance 10
merciful 10
god 10
the 10
count 10
has 10
been 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
some 10
new 10
scheme 10
of 10
terror 10
afoot 10
lateri 10
went 10
after 10
my 10
round 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
told 10
him 10
my 10
suspicion 10
he 10
grew 10
very 10
grave 10
and 10
after 10
thinking 10
the 10
matter 10
over 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
asked 10
me 10
to 10
take 10
him 10
to 10
renfield 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
as 10
we 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
door 10
we 10
heard 10
the 10
lunatic 10
within 10
singing 10
gaily 10
as 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
the 10
time 10
which 10
now 10
seems 10
so 10
long 10
ago 10
when 10
we 10
entered 10
we 10
saw 10
with 10
amazement 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
spread 10
out 10
his 10
sugar 10
as 10
of 10
old 10
the 10
flies 10
lethargic 10
with 10
the 10
autumn 10
were 10
beginning 10
to 10
buzz 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
we 10
tried 10
to 10
make 10
him 10
talk 10
of 10
the 10
subject 10
of 10
our 10
previous 10
conversation 10
but 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
attend 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
with 10
his 10
singing 10
just 10
as 10
though 10
we 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
present 10
he 10
had 10
got 10
a 10
scrap 10
of 10
paper 10
and 10
was 10
folding 10
it 10
into 10
a 10
notebook 10
we 10
had 10
to 10
come 10
away 10
as 10
ignorant 10
as 10
we 10
went 10
in 10
his 10
is 10
a 10
curious 10
case 10
indeed 10
we 10
must 10
watch 10

a 10
man 10
in 10
the 10
corridor 10
last 10
night 10
and 10
told 10
him 10
to 10
make 10
an 10
accurate 10
note 10
of 10
any 10
sound 10
he 10
might 10
hear 10
from 10
renfields 10
room 10
and 10
gave 10
him 10
instructions 10
that 10
if 10
there 10
should 10
be 10
anything 10
strange 10
he 10
was 10
to 10
call 10
me 10
after 10
dinner 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
all 10
gathered 10
round 10
the 10
fire 10
in 10
the 10
study 10
mrs 10
harker 10
having 10
gone 10
to 10
bed 10
we 10
discussed 10
the 10
attempts 10
and 10
discoveries 10
of 10
the 10
day 10
harker 10
was 10
the 10
only 10
one 10
who 10
had 10
any 10
result 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
great 10
hopes 10
that 10
his 10
clue 10
may 10
be 10
an 10
important 10
one 10
before 10
going 10
to 10
bed 10
i 10
went 10
round 10
to 10
the 10
patients 10
room 10
and 10
looked 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
observation 10
trap 10
he 10
was 10
sleeping 10
soundly 10
his 10
heart 10
rose 10
and 10
fell 10
with 10
regular 10
respiration 10
this 10
morning 10
the 10
man 10
on 10
duty 10
reported 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
a 10
little 10
after 10
midnight 10
he 10
was 10
restless 10
and 10
kept 10
saying 10
his 10
prayers 10
somewhat 10
loudly 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
if 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
he 10
replied 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
he 10
heard 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
about 10
his 10
manner 10
so 10
suspicious 10
that 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
point 10
blank 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
asleep 10
he 10
denied 10
sleep 10
but 10
admitted 10
to 10
having 10
dozed 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
it 10
is 10
too 10
bad 10
that 10
men 10
cannot 10
be 10
trusted 10
unless 10
they 10
are 10
watched 10
today 10

be 10
well 10
to 10
have 10
horses 10
always 10
in 10
readiness 10
for 10
when 10
we 10
get 10
the 10
information 10
which 10
we 10
seek 10
there 10

demon 10
cures 10
which 10
may 10
be 10
useful 10
to 10
us 10
later 10
i 10
sometimes 10
think 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
all 10
mad 10
and 10
that 10
we 10
shall 10
wake 10
to 10
sanity 10
in 10
strait 10
waistcoats 10
laterwe 10
have 10
met 10
again 10
we 10
seem 10
at 10
last 10
to 10
be 10
on 10
the 10
track 10
and 10
our 10

of 10
tomorrow 10
may 10
be 10
the 10
beginning 10
of 10
the 10
end 10
i 10
wonder 10
if 10
renfields 10
quiet 10
has 10
anything 10
to 10
do 10
with 10
this 10
his 10
moods 10
have 10
so 10
followed 10
the 10
doings 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
that 10
the 10
coming 10
destruction 10
of 10
the 10
monster 10
may 10
be 10
carried 10
to 10
him 10
some 10
subtle 10
way 10
if 10
we 10
could 10
only 10
get 10
some 10
hint 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
passed 10
in 10
his 10
mind 10
between 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
my 10
argument 10
with 10
him 10
today 10
and 10
his 10
resumption 10
of 10
flycatching 10
it 10
might 10
afford 10
us 10
a 10
valuable 10
clue 10
he 10
is 10
now 10
seemingly 10
quiet 10
for 10
a 10
spell 10
is 10
he 10
that 10
wild 10
yell 10
seemed 10
to 10
come 10
from 10
his 10
room 10
the 10
attendant 10
came 10
bursting 10
into 10
my 10
room 10
and 10
told 10
me 10
that 10
renfield 10
had 10
somehow 10
met 10
with 10
some 10
accident 10
he 10
had 10
heard 10
him 10
yell 10
and 10
when 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
him 10
found 10
him 10
lying 10
on 10
his 10
face 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
all 10
covered 10
with 10
blood 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
at 10

me 10
put 10
down 10
with 10
exactness 10
all 10
that 10
happened 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
can 10
remember 10
since 10
last 10
i 10
made 10
an 10
entry 10
not 10
a 10
detail 10
that 10
i 10
can 10
recall 10
must 10
be 10
forgotten 10
in 10
all 10
calmness 10
i 10
must 10
proceed 10
when 10
i 10
came 10
to 10
renfields 10
room 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
lying 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
on 10
his 10
left 10
side 10
in 10
a 10
glittering 10
pool 10
of 10
blood 10
when 10
i 10
went 10
to 10
move 10
him 10
it 10
became 10
at 10
once 10
apparent 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
received 10
some 10
terrible 10
injuries 10
there 10
seemed 10
none 10
of 10
the 10
unity 10
of 10
purpose 10
between 10
the 10
parts 10
of 10
the 10
body 10
which 10
marks 10
even 10
lethargic 10
sanity 10
as 10
the 10
face 10
was 10
exposed 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
horribly 10
bruised 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
beaten 10
against 10
the 10
floor 10
indeed 10
it 10
was 10
from 10
the 10
face 10
wounds 10
that 10
the 10
pool 10
of 10
blood 10
originated 10
the 10
attendant 10
who 10
was 10
kneeling 10
beside 10
the 10
body 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
we 10
turned 10
him 10
over 10
i 10
think 10
sir 10
his 10
back 10
is 10
broken 10
see 10
both 10
his 10
right 10
arm 10
and 10
leg 10
and 10
the 10
whole 10
side 10
of 10
his 10
face 10
are 10
paralysed 10
how 10
such 10
a 10
thing 10
could 10
have 10
happened 10
puzzled 10
the 10
attendant 10
beyond 10
measure 10
he 10
seemed 10
quite 10
bewildered 10
and 10
his 10
brows 10
were 10
gathered 10
in 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
cant 10
understand 10
the 10
two 10
things 10
he 10
could 10
mark 10
his 10
face 10
like 10
that 10
by 10
beating 10
his 10
own 10
head 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
i 10
saw 10
a 10
young 10
woman 10
do 10
it 10
once 10
at 10
the 10
eversfield 10
asylum 10
before 10
anyone 10
could 10
lay 10
hands 10
on 10
her 10
and 10
i 10
suppose 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
broken 10
his 10
neck 10
by 10
falling 10
out 10
of 10
bed 10
if 10
he 10
got 10
in 10
an 10
awkward 10
kink 10
but 10
for 10
the 10
life 10
of 10
me 10
i 10
cant 10
imagine 10
how 10
the 10
two 10
things 10
occurred 10
if 10
his 10
back 10
was 10
broke 10
he 10
couldnt 10
beat 10
his 10
head 10
and 10
if 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
like 10
that 10
before 10
the 10
fall 10
out 10
of 10
bed 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
marks 10
of 10
it 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
him 10
go 10
to 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
ask 10
him 10
to 10
kindly 10
come 10
here 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
want 10
him 10
without 10
an 10
instants 10
delay 10
the 10
man 10
ran 10
off 10
and 10
within 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
the 10
professor 10
in 10
his 10
dressing 10
gown 10
and 10
slippers 10
appeared 10
when 10
he 10
saw 10
renfield 10
on 10
the 10
ground 10
he 10
looked 10
keenly 10
at 10
him 10
a 10
moment 10
and 10
then 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
think 10
he 10
recognized 10
my 10
thought 10
in 10
my 10
eyes 10
for 10
he 10
said 10
very 10
quietly 10
manifestly 10
for 10
the 10
ears 10
of 10
the 10
attendant 10
ah 10
a 10
sad 10
accident 10
he 10
will 10
need 10
very 10
careful 10
watching 10
and 10
much 10
attention 10
i 10
shall 10
stay 10
with 10
you 10
myself 10
but 10
i 10
shall 10
first 10
dress 10
myself 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
remain 10
i 10
shall 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
join 10
you 10
the 10
patient 10
was 10
now 10
breathing 10
stertorously 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
easy 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
suffered 10
some 10
terrible 10
injury 10
van 10
helsing 10
returned 10
with 10
extraordinary 10
celerity 10
bearing 10
with 10
him 10
a 10
surgical 10
case 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
been 10
thinking 10
and 10
had 10
his 10
mind 10
made 10
up 10
for 10
almost 10
before 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
the 10
patient 10
he 10
whispered 10
to 10
me 10
send 10
the 10
attendant 10
away 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
alone 10
with 10
him 10
when 10
he 10
becomes 10
conscious 10
after 10
the 10
operation 10
i 10
said 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
will 10
do 10
now 10
simmons 10
we 10
have 10
done 10
all 10
that 10
we 10
can 10
at 10
present 10
you 10
had 10
better 10
go 10
your 10
round 10
and 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
will 10
operate 10
let 10
me 10
know 10
instantly 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
anything 10
unusual 10
anywhere 10
the 10
man 10
withdrew 10
and 10
we 10
went 10
into 10
a 10
strict 10
examination 10
of 10
the 10
patient 10
the 10
wounds 10
of 10
the 10
face 10
were 10
superficial 10
the 10
real 10
injury 10
was 10
a 10
depressed 10
fracture 10
of 10
the 10
skull 10
extending 10
right 10
up 10
through 10
the 10
motor 10
area 10
the 10
professor 10
thought 10
a 10
moment 10
and 10
said 10
we 10
must 10
reduce 10
the 10
pressure 10
and 10
get 10
back 10
to 10
normal 10
conditions 10
as 10
far 10
as 10
can 10
be 10
the 10
rapidity 10
of 10
the 10
suffusion 10
shows 10
the 10
terrible 10
nature 10
of 10
his 10
injury 10
the 10
whole 10
motor 10
area 10
seems 10
affected 10
the 10
suffusion 10
of 10
the 10
brain 10
will 10
increase 10
quickly 10
so 10
we 10
must 10
trephine 10
at 10
once 10
or 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
too 10
late 10
as 10
he 10
was 10
speaking 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
soft 10
tapping 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
i 10
went 10
over 10
and 10
opened 10
it 10
and 10
found 10
in 10
the 10
corridor 10
without 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
in 10
pajamas 10
and 10
slippers 10
the 10
former 10
spoke 10
i 10
heard 10
your 10
man 10
call 10
up 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
tell 10
him 10
of 10
an 10
accident 10
so 10
i 10
woke 10
quincey 10
or 10
rather 10
called 10
for 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
was 10
not 10
asleep 10
things 10
are 10
moving 10
too 10
quickly 10
and 10
too 10
strangely 10
for 10
sound 10
sleep 10
for 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
these 10
times 10
ive 10
been 10
thinking 10
that 10
tomorrow 10
night 10
will 10
not 10
see 10
things 10
as 10
they 10
have 10
been 10
well 10
have 10
to 10
look 10
back 10
and 10
forward 10
a 10
little 10
more 10
than 10
we 10
have 10
done 10
may 10
we 10
come 10
in 10
i 10
nodded 10
and 10
held 10
the 10
door 10
open 10
till 10
they 10
had 10
entered 10
then 10
i 10
closed 10
it 10
again 10
when 10
quincey 10
saw 10
the 10
attitude 10
and 10
state 10
of 10
the 10
patient 10
and 10
noted 10
the 10
horrible 10
pool 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
he 10
said 10
softly 10
my 10
god 10
what 10
has 10
happened 10
to 10
him 10
poor 10
poor 10
devil 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
briefly 10
and 10
added 10
that 10
we 10
expected 10
he 10
would 10
recover 10
consciousness 10
after 10
the 10
operation 10
for 10
a 10
short 10
time 10
at 10
all 10
events 10
he 10
went 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
bed 10
with 10
godalming 10
beside 10
him 10
we 10
all 10
watched 10
in 10
patience 10
we 10
shall 10
wait 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
just 10
long 10
enough 10
to 10
fix 10
the 10
best 10
spot 10
for 10
trephining 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
most 10
quickly 10
and 10
perfectly 10
remove 10
the 10
blood 10
clot 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
evident 10
that 10
the 10
haemorrhage 10
is 10
increasing 10
the 10
minutes 10
during 10
which 10
we 10
waited 10
passed 10
with 10
fearful 10
slowness 10
i 10
had 10
a 10
horrible 10
sinking 10
in 10
my 10
heart 10
and 10
from 10
van 10
helsings 10
face 10
i 10
gathered 10
that 10
he 10
felt 10
some 10
fear 10
or 10
apprehension 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
was 10
to 10
come 10
i 10
dreaded 10
the 10
words 10
renfield 10
might 10
speak 10
i 10
was 10
positively 10
afraid 10
to 10
think 10
but 10
the 10
conviction 10
of 10
what 10
was 10
coming 10
was 10
on 10
me 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
read 10
of 10
men 10
who 10
have 10
heard 10
the 10
death 10
watch 10
the 10
poor 10
mans 10
breathing 10
came 10
in 10
uncertain 10
gasps 10
each 10
instant 10
he 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
would 10
open 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
speak 10
but 10
then 10
would 10
follow 10
a 10
prolonged 10
stertorous 10
breath 10
and 10
he 10
would 10
relapse 10
into 10
a 10
more 10
fixed 10
insensibility 10
inured 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
to 10
sick 10
beds 10
and 10
death 10
this 10
suspense 10
grew 10
and 10
grew 10
upon 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
almost 10
hear 10
the 10
beating 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
and 10
the 10
blood 10
surging 10
through 10
my 10
temples 10
sounded 10
like 10
blows 10
from 10
a 10
hammer 10
the 10
silence 10
finally 10
became 10
agonizing 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
my 10
companions 10
one 10
after 10
another 10
and 10
saw 10
from 10
their 10
flushed 10
faces 10
and 10
damp 10
brows 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
enduring 10
equal 10
torture 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
nervous 10
suspense 10
over 10
us 10
all 10
as 10
though 10
overhead 10
some 10
dread 10
bell 10
would 10
peal 10
out 10
powerfully 10
when 10
we 10
should 10
least 10
expect 10
it 10
at 10
last 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
time 10
when 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
the 10
patient 10
was 10
sinking 10
fast 10
he 10
might 10
die 10
at 10
any 10
moment 10
i 10
looked 10
up 10
at 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
caught 10
his 10
eyes 10
fixed 10
on 10
mine 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
sternly 10
set 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
time 10
to 10
lose 10
his 10
words 10
may 10
be 10
worth 10
many 10
lives 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
thinking 10
so 10
as 10
i 10
stood 10
here 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
soul 10
at 10
stake 10
we 10
shall 10
operate 10
just 10
above 10
the 10
ear 10
without 10
another 10
word 10
he 10
made 10
the 10
operation 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
the 10
breathing 10
continued 10
to 10
be 10
stertorous 10
then 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
breath 10
so 10
prolonged 10
that 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
would 10
tear 10
open 10
his 10
chest 10
suddenly 10
his 10
eyes 10
opened 10
and 10
became 10
fixed 10
in 10
a 10
wild 10
helpless 10
stare 10
this 10
was 10
continued 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
then 10
it 10
was 10
softened 10
into 10
a 10
glad 10
surprise 10
and 10
from 10
his 10
lips 10
came 10
a 10
sigh 10
of 10
relief 10
he 10
moved 10
convulsively 10
and 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
so 10
said 10
ill 10
be 10
quiet 10
doctor 10
tell 10
them 10
to 10
take 10
off 10
the 10
strait 10
waistcoat 10
i 10
have 10
had 10
a 10
terrible 10
dream 10
and 10
it 10
has 10
left 10
me 10
so 10
weak 10
that 10
i 10
cannot 10
move 10
whats 10
wrong 10
with 10
my 10
face 10
it 10
feels 10
all 10
swollen 10
and 10
it 10
smarts 10
dreadfully 10
he 10
tried 10
to 10
turn 10
his 10
head 10
but 10
even 10
with 10
the 10
effort 10
his 10
eyes 10
seemed 10
to 10
grow 10
glassy 10
again 10
so 10
i 10
gently 10
put 10
it 10
back 10
then 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
quiet 10
grave 10
tone 10
tell 10
us 10
your 10
dream 10
mr 10
renfield 10
as 10
he 10
heard 10
the 10
voice 10
his 10
face 10
brightened 10
through 10
its 10
mutilation 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
is 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
how 10
good 10
it 10
is 10
of 10
you 10
to 10
be 10
here 10
give 10
me 10
some 10
water 10
my 10
lips 10
are 10
dry 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
tell 10
you 10
i 10
dreamed 10
he 10
stopped 10
and 10
seemed 10
fainting 10
i 10
called 10
quietly 10
to 10
quincey 10
the 10
brandy 10
it 10
is 10
in 10
my 10
study 10
quick 10
he 10
flew 10
and 10
returned 10
with 10
a 10
glass 10
the 10
decanter 10
of 10
brandy 10
and 10
a 10
carafe 10
of 10
water 10
we 10
moistened 10
the 10
parched 10
lips 10
and 10
the 10
patient 10
quickly 10
revived 10
it 10
seemed 10
however 10
that 10
his 10
poor 10
injured 10
brain 10
had 10
been 10
working 10
in 10
the 10
interval 10
for 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
quite 10
conscious 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
piercingly 10
with 10
an 10
agonized 10
confusion 10
which 10
i 10
shall 10
never 10
forget 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
deceive 10
myself 10
it 10
was 10
no 10
dream 10
but 10
all 10
a 10
grim 10
reality 10
then 10
his 10
eyes 10
roved 10
round 10
the 10
room 10
as 10
they 10
caught 10
sight 10
of 10
the 10
two 10
figures 10
sitting 10
patiently 10
on 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
bed 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
not 10
sure 10
already 10
i 10
would 10
know 10
from 10
them 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
his 10
eyes 10
closed 10
not 10
with 10
pain 10
or 10
sleep 10
but 10
voluntarily 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
were 10
bringing 10
all 10
his 10
faculties 10
to 10
bear 10
when 10
he 10
opened 10
them 10
he 10
said 10
hurriedly 10
and 10
with 10
more 10
energy 10
than 10
he 10
had 10
yet 10
displayed 10
quick 10
doctor 10
quick 10
i 10
am 10
dying 10
i 10
feel 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
but 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
and 10
then 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
death 10
or 10
worse 10
wet 10
my 10
lips 10
with 10
brandy 10
again 10
i 10
have 10
something 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
say 10
before 10
i 10
die 10
or 10
before 10
my 10
poor 10
crushed 10
brain 10
dies 10
anyhow 10
thank 10
you 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
night 10
after 10
you 10
left 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
implored 10
you 10
to 10
let 10
me 10
go 10
away 10
i 10
couldnt 10
speak 10
then 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
my 10
tongue 10
was 10
tied 10
but 10
i 10
was 10
as 10
sane 10
then 10
except 10
in 10
that 10
way 10
as 10
i 10
am 10
now 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
of 10
despair 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
after 10
you 10
left 10
me 10
it 10
seemed 10
hours 10
then 10
there 10
came 10
a 10
sudden 10
peace 10
to 10
me 10
my 10
brain 10
seemed 10
to 10
become 10
cool 10
again 10
and 10
i 10
realized 10
where 10
i 10
was 10
i 10
heard 10
the 10
dogs 10
bark 10
behind 10
our 10
house 10
but 10
not 10
where 10
he 10
was 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
van 10
helsings 10
eyes 10
never 10
blinked 10
but 10
his 10
hand 10
came 10
out 10
and 10
met 10
mine 10
and 10
gripped 10
it 10
hard 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
however 10
betray 10
himself 10
he 10
nodded 10
slightly 10
and 10
said 10
go 10
on 10
in 10
a 10
low 10
voice 10
renfield 10
proceeded 10
he 10
came 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
in 10
the 10
mist 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
often 10
before 10
but 10
he 10
was 10
solid 10
then 10
not 10
a 10
ghost 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
were 10
fierce 10
like 10
a 10
mans 10
when 10
angry 10
he 10
was 10
laughing 10
with 10
his 10
red 10
mouth 10
the 10
sharp 10
white 10
teeth 10
glinted 10
in 10
the 10
moonlight 10
when 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
look 10
back 10
over 10
the 10
belt 10
of 10
trees 10
to 10
where 10
the 10
dogs 10
were 10
barking 10
i 10
wouldnt 10
ask 10
him 10
to 10
come 10
in 10
at 10
first 10
though 10
i 10
knew 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
just 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
wanted 10
all 10
along 10
then 10
he 10
began 10
promising 10
me 10
things 10
not 10
in 10
words 10
but 10
by 10
doing 10
them 10
he 10
was 10
interrupted 10
by 10
a 10
word 10
from 10
the 10
professor 10
how 10
by 10
making 10
them 10
happen 10
just 10
as 10
he 10
used 10
to 10
send 10
in 10
the 10
flies 10
when 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
shining 10
great 10
big 10
fat 10
ones 10
with 10
steel 10
and 10
sapphire 10
on 10
their 10
wings 10
and 10
big 10
moths 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
with 10
skull 10
and 10
crossbones 10
on 10
their 10
backs 10
van 10
helsing 10
nodded 10
to 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
whispered 10
to 10
me 10
unconsciously 10
the 10
acherontia 10
atropos 10
of 10
the 10
sphinges 10
what 10
you 10
call 10
the 10
deathshead 10
moth 10
the 10
patient 10
went 10
on 10
without 10
stopping 10
then 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
whisperrats 10
rats 10
rats 10
hundreds 10
thousands 10
millions 10
of 10
them 10
and 10
every 10
one 10
a 10
life 10
and 10
dogs 10
to 10
eat 10
them 10
and 10
cats 10
too 10
all 10
lives 10
all 10
red 10
blood 10
with 10
years 10
of 10
life 10
in 10
it 10
and 10
not 10
merely 10
buzzing 10
flies 10
i 10
laughed 10
at 10
him 10
for 10
i 10
wanted 10
to 10
see 10
what 10
he 10
could 10
do 10
then 10
the 10
dogs 10
howled 10
away 10
beyond 10
the 10
dark 10
trees 10
in 10
his 10
house 10
he 10
beckoned 10
me 10
to 10
the 10
window 10
i 10
got 10
up 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
and 10
he 10
raised 10
his 10
hands 10
and 10
seemed 10
to 10
call 10
out 10
without 10
using 10
any 10
words 10
a 10
dark 10
mass 10
spread 10
over 10
the 10
grass 10
coming 10
on 10
like 10
the 10
shape 10
of 10
a 10
flame 10
of 10
fire 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
moved 10
the 10
mist 10
to 10
the 10
right 10
and 10
left 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
there 10
were 10
thousands 10
of 10
rats 10
with 10
their 10
eyes 10
blazing 10
red 10
like 10
his 10
only 10
smaller 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
they 10
all 10
stopped 10
and 10
i 10
thought 10
he 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
saying 10
all 10
these 10
lives 10
will 10
i 10
give 10
you 10
ay 10
and 10
many 10
more 10
and 10
greater 10
through 10
countless 10
ages 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
fall 10
down 10
and 10
worship 10
me 10
and 10
then 10
a 10
red 10
cloud 10
like 10
the 10
color 10
of 10
blood 10
seemed 10
to 10
close 10
over 10
my 10
eyes 10
and 10
before 10
i 10
knew 10
what 10
i 10
was 10
doing 10
i 10
found 10
myself 10
opening 10
the 10
sash 10
and 10
saying 10
to 10
him 10
come 10
in 10
lord 10
and 10
master 10
the 10
rats 10
were 10
all 10
gone 10
but 10
he 10
slid 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
through 10
the 10
sash 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
open 10
an 10
inch 10
wide 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
moon 10
herself 10
has 10
often 10
come 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
tiniest 10
crack 10
and 10
has 10
stood 10
before 10
me 10
in 10
all 10
her 10
size 10
and 10
splendor 10
his 10
voice 10
was 10
weaker 10
so 10
i 10
moistened 10
his 10
lips 10
with 10
the 10
brandy 10
again 10
and 10
he 10
continued 10
but 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
his 10
memory 10
had 10
gone 10
on 10
working 10
in 10
the 10
interval 10
for 10
his 10
story 10
was 10
further 10
advanced 10
i 10
was 10
about 10
to 10
call 10
him 10
back 10
to 10
the 10
point 10
but 10
van 10
helsing 10
whispered 10
to 10
me 10
let 10
him 10
go 10
on 10
do 10
not 10
interrupt 10
him 10
he 10
cannot 10
go 10
back 10
and 10
maybe 10
could 10
not 10
proceed 10
at 10
all 10
if 10
once 10
he 10
lost 10
the 10
thread 10
of 10
his 10
thought 10
he 10
proceeded 10
all 10
day 10
i 10
waited 10
to 10
hear 10
from 10
him 10
but 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
send 10
me 10
anything 10
not 10
even 10
a 10
blowfly 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
moon 10
got 10
up 10
i 10
was 10
pretty 10
angry 10
with 10
him 10
when 10
he 10
did 10
slide 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
window 10
though 10
it 10
was 10
shut 10
and 10
did 10
not 10
even 10
knock 10
i 10
got 10
mad 10
with 10
him 10
he 10
sneered 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
his 10
white 10
face 10
looked 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
mist 10
with 10
his 10
red 10
eyes 10
gleaming 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
as 10
though 10
he 10
owned 10
the 10
whole 10
place 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
he 10
didnt 10
even 10
smell 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
by 10
me 10
i 10
couldnt 10
hold 10
him 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
somehow 10
mrs 10
harker 10
had 10
come 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
two 10
men 10
sitting 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
came 10
over 10
standing 10
behind 10
him 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
them 10
but 10
where 10
they 10
could 10
hear 10
better 10
they 10
were 10
both 10
silent 10
but 10
the 10
professor 10
started 10
and 10
quivered 10
his 10
face 10
however 10
grew 10
grimmer 10
and 10
sterner 10
still 10
renfield 10
went 10
on 10
without 10
noticing 10
when 10
mrs 10
harker 10
came 10
in 10
to 10
see 10
me 10
this 10
afternoon 10
she 10
wasnt 10
the 10
same 10
it 10
was 10
like 10
tea 10
after 10
the 10
teapot 10
has 10
been 10
watered 10
here 10
we 10
all 10
moved 10
but 10
no 10
one 10
said 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
didnt 10
know 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
here 10
till 10
she 10
spoke 10
and 10
she 10
didnt 10
look 10
the 10
same 10
i 10
dont 10
care 10
for 10
the 10
pale 10
people 10
i 10
like 10
them 10
with 10
lots 10
of 10
blood 10
in 10
them 10
and 10
hers 10
all 10
seemed 10
to 10
have 10
run 10
out 10
i 10
didnt 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
but 10
when 10
she 10
went 10
away 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
think 10
and 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
mad 10
to 10
know 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
taking 10
the 10
life 10
out 10
of 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
feel 10
that 10
the 10
rest 10
quivered 10
as 10
i 10
did 10
but 10
we 10
remained 10
otherwise 10
still 10
so 10
when 10
he 10
came 10
tonight 10
i 10
was 10
ready 10
for 10
him 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
mist 10
stealing 10
in 10
and 10
i 10
grabbed 10
it 10
tight 10
i 10
had 10
heard 10
that 10
madmen 10
have 10
unnatural 10
strength 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
knew 10
i 10
was 10
a 10
madman 10
at 10
times 10
anyhow 10
i 10
resolved 10
to 10
use 10
my 10
power 10
ay 10
and 10
he 10
felt 10
it 10
too 10
for 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
come 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
mist 10
to 10
struggle 10
with 10
me 10
i 10
held 10
tight 10
and 10
i 10
thought 10
i 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
win 10
for 10
i 10
didnt 10
mean 10
him 10
to 10
take 10
any 10
more 10
of 10
her 10
life 10
till 10
i 10
saw 10
his 10
eyes 10
they 10
burned 10
into 10
me 10
and 10
my 10
strength 10
became 10
like 10
water 10
he 10
slipped 10
through 10
it 10
and 10
when 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
cling 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
raised 10
me 10
up 10
and 10
flung 10
me 10
down 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
red 10
cloud 10
before 10
me 10
and 10
a 10
noise 10
like 10
thunder 10
and 10
the 10
mist 10
seemed 10
to 10
steal 10
away 10
under 10
the 10
door 10
his 10
voice 10
was 10
becoming 10
fainter 10
and 10
his 10
breath 10
more 10
stertorous 10
van 10
helsing 10
stood 10
up 10
instinctively 10
we 10
know 10
the 10
worst 10
now 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
is 10
here 10
and 10
we 10
know 10
his 10
purpose 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
too 10
late 10
let 10
us 10
be 10
armed 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
the 10
other 10
night 10
but 10
lose 10
no 10
time 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
an 10
instant 10
to 10
spare 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
need 10
to 10
put 10
our 10
fear 10
nay 10
our 10
conviction 10
into 10
words 10
we 10
shared 10
them 10
in 10
common 10
we 10
all 10
hurried 10
and 10
took 10
from 10
our 10
rooms 10
the 10
same 10
things 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
when 10
we 10
entered 10
the 10
counts 10
house 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
his 10
ready 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
met 10
in 10
the 10
corridor 10
he 10
pointed 10
to 10
them 10
significantly 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
they 10
never 10
leave 10
me 10
and 10
they 10
shall 10
not 10
till 10
this 10
unhappy 10
business 10
is 10
over 10
be 10
wise 10
also 10
my 10
friends 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
common 10
enemy 10
that 10
we 10
deal 10
with 10
alas 10
alas 10
that 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
should 10
suffer 10
he 10
stopped 10
his 10
voice 10
was 10
breaking 10
and 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
if 10
rage 10
or 10
terror 10
predominated 10
in 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
outside 10
the 10
harkers 10
door 10
we 10
paused 10
art 10
and 10
quincey 10
held 10
back 10
and 10
the 10
latter 10
said 10
should 10
we 10
disturb 10
her 10
we 10
must 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
grimly 10
if 10
the 10
door 10
be 10
locked 10
i 10
shall 10
break 10
it 10
in 10
may 10
it 10
not 10
frighten 10
her 10
terribly 10
it 10
is 10
unusual 10
to 10
break 10
into 10
a 10
ladys 10
room 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
solemnly 10
you 10
are 10
always 10
right 10
but 10
this 10
is 10
life 10
and 10
death 10
all 10
chambers 10
are 10
alike 10
to 10
the 10
doctor 10
and 10
even 10
were 10
they 10
not 10
they 10
are 10
all 10
as 10
one 10
to 10
me 10
tonight 10
friend 10
john 10
when 10
i 10
turn 10
the 10
handle 10
if 10
the 10
door 10
does 10
not 10
open 10
do 10
you 10
put 10
your 10
shoulder 10
down 10
and 10
shove 10
and 10
you 10
too 10
my 10
friends 10
now 10
he 10
turned 10
the 10
handle 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
but 10
the 10
door 10
did 10
not 10
yield 10
we 10
threw 10
ourselves 10
against 10
it 10
with 10
a 10
crash 10
it 10
burst 10
open 10
and 10
we 10
almost 10
fell 10
headlong 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
professor 10
did 10
actually 10
fall 10
and 10
i 10
saw 10
across 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
gathered 10
himself 10
up 10
from 10
hands 10
and 10
knees 10
what 10
i 10
saw 10
appalled 10
me 10
i 10
felt 10
my 10
hair 10
rise 10
like 10
bristles 10
on 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
my 10
neck 10
and 10
my 10
heart 10
seemed 10
to 10
stand 10
still 10
the 10
moonlight 10
was 10
so 10
bright 10
that 10
through 10
the 10
thick 10
yellow 10
blind 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
light 10
enough 10
to 10
see 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
beside 10
the 10
window 10
lay 10
jonathan 10
harker 10
his 10
face 10
flushed 10
and 10
breathing 10
heavily 10
as 10
though 10
in 10
a 10
stupor 10
kneeling 10
on 10
the 10
near 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
bed 10
facing 10
outwards 10
was 10
the 10
whiteclad 10
figure 10
of 10
his 10
wife 10
by 10
her 10
side 10
stood 10
a 10
tall 10
thin 10
man 10
clad 10
in 10
black 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
turned 10
from 10
us 10
but 10
the 10
instant 10
we 10
saw 10
we 10
all 10
recognized 10
the 10
count 10
in 10
every 10
way 10
even 10
to 10
the 10
scar 10
on 10
his 10
forehead 10
with 10
his 10
left 10
hand 10
he 10
held 10
both 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
hands 10
keeping 10
them 10
away 10
with 10
her 10
arms 10
at 10
full 10
tension 10
his 10
right 10
hand 10
gripped 10
her 10
by 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
neck 10
forcing 10
her 10
face 10
down 10
on 10
his 10
bosom 10
her 10
white 10
nightdress 10
was 10
smeared 10
with 10
blood 10
and 10
a 10
thin 10
stream 10
trickled 10
down 10
the 10
mans 10
bare 10
chest 10
which 10
was 10
shown 10
by 10
his 10
tornopen 10
dress 10
the 10
attitude 10
of 10
the 10
two 10
had 10
a 10
terrible 10
resemblance 10
to 10
a 10
child 10
forcing 10
a 10
kittens 10
nose 10
into 10
a 10
saucer 10
of 10
milk 10
to 10
compel 10
it 10
to 10
drink 10
as 10
we 10
burst 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
count 10
turned 10
his 10
face 10
and 10
the 10
hellish 10
look 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
heard 10
described 10
seemed 10
to 10
leap 10
into 10
it 10
his 10
eyes 10
flamed 10
red 10
with 10
devilish 10
passion 10
the 10
great 10
nostrils 10
of 10
the 10
white 10
aquiline 10
nose 10
opened 10
wide 10
and 10
quivered 10
at 10
the 10
edge 10
and 10
the 10
white 10
sharp 10
teeth 10
behind 10
the 10
full 10
lips 10
of 10
the 10
blood 10
dripping 10
mouth 10
clamped 10
together 10
like 10
those 10
of 10
a 10
wild 10
beast 10
with 10
a 10
wrench 10
which 10
threw 10
his 10
victim 10
back 10
upon 10
the 10
bed 10
as 10
though 10
hurled 10
from 10
a 10
height 10
he 10
turned 10
and 10
sprang 10
at 10
us 10
but 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
gained 10
his 10
feet 10
and 10
was 10
holding 10
towards 10
him 10
the 10
envelope 10
which 10
contained 10
the 10
sacred 10
wafer 10
the 10
count 10
suddenly 10
stopped 10
just 10
as 10
poor 10
lucy 10
had 10
done 10
outside 10
the 10
tomb 10
and 10
cowered 10
back 10
further 10
and 10
further 10
back 10
he 10
cowered 10
as 10
we 10
lifting 10
our 10
crucifixes 10
advanced 10
the 10
moonlight 10
suddenly 10
failed 10
as 10
a 10
great 10
black 10
cloud 10
sailed 10
across 10
the 10
sky 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
gaslight 10
sprang 10
up 10
under 10
quinceys 10
match 10
we 10
saw 10
nothing 10
but 10
a 10
faint 10
vapor 10
this 10
as 10
we 10
looked 10
trailed 10
under 10
the 10
door 10
which 10
with 10
the 10
recoil 10
from 10
its 10
bursting 10
open 10
had 10
swung 10
back 10
to 10
its 10
old 10
position 10
van 10
helsing 10
art 10
and 10
i 10
moved 10
forward 10
to 10
mrs 10
harker 10
who 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
had 10
drawn 10
her 10
breath 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
had 10
given 10
a 10
scream 10
so 10
wild 10
so 10
earpiercing 10
so 10
despairing 10
that 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
now 10
that 10
it 10
will 10
ring 10
in 10
my 10
ears 10
till 10
my 10
dying 10
day 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
she 10
lay 10
in 10
her 10
helpless 10
attitude 10
and 10
disarray 10
her 10
face 10
was 10
ghastly 10
with 10
a 10
pallor 10
which 10
was 10
accentuated 10
by 10
the 10
blood 10
which 10
smeared 10
her 10
lips 10
and 10
cheeks 10
and 10
chin 10
from 10
her 10
throat 10
trickled 10
a 10
thin 10
stream 10
of 10
blood 10
her 10
eyes 10
were 10
mad 10
with 10
terror 10
then 10
she 10
put 10
before 10
her 10
face 10
her 10
poor 10
crushed 10
hands 10
which 10
bore 10
on 10
their 10
whiteness 10
the 10
red 10
mark 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
terrible 10
grip 10
and 10
from 10
behind 10
them 10
came 10
a 10
low 10
desolate 10
wail 10
which 10
made 10
the 10
terrible 10
scream 10
seem 10
only 10
the 10
quick 10
expression 10
of 10
an 10
endless 10
grief 10
van 10
helsing 10
stepped 10
forward 10
and 10
drew 10
the 10
coverlet 10
gently 10
over 10
her 10
body 10
whilst 10
art 10
after 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
face 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
despairingly 10
ran 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
van 10
helsing 10
whispered 10
to 10
me 10

a 10
stupor 10
such 10
as 10

vampire 10
can 10
produce 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
nothing 10
with 10
poor 10
madam 10
mina 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
till 10
she 10
recovers 10
herself 10
i 10
must 10
wake 10
him 10
he 10
dipped 10
the 10
end 10
of 10
a 10
towel 10
in 10
cold 10
water 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
began 10
to 10
flick 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
face 10
his 10
wife 10
all 10
the 10
while 10
holding 10
her 10
face 10
between 10
her 10
hands 10
and 10
sobbing 10
in 10
a 10
way 10
that 10
was 10
heart 10
breaking 10
to 10
hear 10
i 10
raised 10
the 10
blind 10
and 10
looked 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
there 10
was 10
much 10
moonshine 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
quincey 10
morris 10
run 10
across 10
the 10
lawn 10
and 10
hide 10
himself 10
in 10
the 10
shadow 10
of 10
a 10
great 10
yew 10
tree 10
it 10
puzzled 10
me 10
to 10
think 10
why 10
he 10
was 10
doing 10
this 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
instant 10
i 10
heard 10
harkers 10
quick 10
exclamation 10
as 10
he 10
woke 10
to 10
partial 10
consciousness 10
and 10
turned 10
to 10
the 10
bed 10
on 10
his 10
face 10
as 10
there 10
might 10
well 10
be 10
was 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
wild 10
amazement 10
he 10
seemed 10
dazed 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
and 10
then 10
full 10
consciousness 10
seemed 10
to 10
burst 10
upon 10
him 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
he 10
started 10
up 10
his 10
wife 10
was 10
aroused 10
by 10
the 10
quick 10
movement 10
and 10
turned 10
to 10
him 10
with 10
her 10
arms 10
stretched 10
out 10
as 10
though 10
to 10
embrace 10
him 10
instantly 10
however 10
she 10
drew 10
them 10
in 10
again 10
and 10
putting 10
her 10
elbows 10
together 10
held 10
her 10
hands 10
before 10
her 10
face 10
and 10
shuddered 10
till 10

and 10
he 10
yielding 10
to 10
her 10
she 10
pulled 10
him 10
down 10

and 10

silent 10
holding 10
down 10
her 10
head 10
on 10
her 10
husbands 10
breast 10
when 10
she 10
raised 10
it 10
his 10
white 10
nightrobe 10
was 10
stained 10
with 10
blood 10
where 10
her 10
lips 10
had 10
touched 10
and 10
where 10
the 10
thin 10
open 10
wound 10
in 10
the 10
neck 10
had 10
sent 10
forth 10
drops 10
the 10
instant 10
she 10
saw 10
it 10
she 10
drew 10
back 10
with 10
a 10
low 10
wail 10
and 10
whispered 10
amidst 10
choking 10
sobs 10
unclean 10
unclean 10
i 10
must 10
touch 10
him 10
or 10

no 10
more 10
oh 10
that 10

i 10
who 10
am 10
now 10
his 10
worst 10
enemy 10
and 10
whom 10
he 10
may 10
have 10
most 10
cause 10
to 10
fear 10
to 10
this 10
he 10
spoke 10
out 10
resolutely 10
nonsense 10
mina 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
shame 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
hear 10
such 10
a 10
word 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
hear 10
it 10
of 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
hear 10
it 10
from 10
you 10
may 10
god 10
judge 10
me 10
by 10
my 10
deserts 10
and 10
punish 10
me 10
with 10
more 10
bitter 10
suffering 10
than 10
even 10
this 10
hour 10
if 10
by 10
any 10
act 10
or 10
will 10
of 10
mine 10
anything 10
ever 10
come 10
between 10
us 10
he 10
put 10
out 10
his 10
arms 10
and 10
folded 10
her 10
to 10
his 10
breast 10
and 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
she 10
lay 10
there 10
sobbing 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
us 10
over 10
her 10
bowed 10
head 10
with 10
eyes 10
that 10
blinked 10
damply 10
above 10
his 10
quivering 10
nostrils 10
his 10
mouth 10
was 10
set 10
as 10
steel 10
after 10
a 10
while 10
her 10
sobs 10
became 10
less 10
frequent 10
and 10
more 10
faint 10
and 10
then 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
speaking 10
with 10
a 10
studied 10
calmness 10
which 10
i 10
felt 10
tried 10
his 10
nervous 10
power 10
to 10
the 10
utmost 10
and 10
now 10
dr 10
seward 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
about 10
it 10
too 10
well 10

know 10
the 10
broad 10
fact 10
tell 10
me 10
all 10
that 10
has 10
been 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
exactly 10
what 10
had 10
happened 10
and 10
he 10
listened 10
with 10
seeming 10
impassiveness 10
but 10
his 10
nostrils 10
twitched 10
and 10
his 10
eyes 10
blazed 10
as 10
i 10
told 10
how 10
the 10
ruthless 10
hands 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
held 10
his 10
wife 10
in 10
that 10
terrible 10
and 10
horrid 10
position 10
with 10
her 10
mouth 10
to 10
the 10
open 10
wound 10
in 10
his 10
breast 10
it 10
interested 10
me 10
even 10
at 10
that 10
moment 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
whilst 10
the 10
face 10
of 10
white 10
set 10
passion 10
worked 10
convulsively 10
over 10
the 10
bowed 10
head 10
the 10
hands 10
tenderly 10
and 10
lovingly 10
stroked 10
the 10
ruffled 10
hair 10
just 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
finished 10
quincey 10
and 10
godalming 10
knocked 10
at 10
the 10

entered 10
in 10
obedience 10
to 10
our 10
summons 10
van 10
helsing 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
questioningly 10
i 10
understood 10
him 10
to 10
mean 10
if 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
take 10
advantage 10
of 10
their 10
coming 10
to 10
divert 10
if 10
possible 10
the 10
thoughts 10
of 10
the 10
unhappy 10
husband 10
and 10
wife 10
from 10
each 10
other 10
and 10
from 10
themselves 10
so 10
on 10
nodding 10
acquiescence 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
asked 10
them 10
what 10
they 10
had 10
seen 10
or 10
done 10
to 10
which 10
lord 10
godalming 10
answered 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
him 10
anywhere 10
in 10
the 10
passage 10
or 10
in 10
any 10
of 10
our 10
rooms 10
i 10
looked 10
in 10
the 10
study 10
but 10
though 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
there 10
he 10
had 10
gone 10
he 10
had 10
however 10
he 10
stopped 10
suddenly 10
looking 10
at 10
the 10
poor 10
drooping 10
figure 10
on 10
the 10
bed 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
gravely 10
go 10
on 10
friend 10
arthur 10
we 10
want 10
here 10
no 10
more 10
concealments 10
our 10
hope 10
now 10
is 10
in 10
knowing 10
all 10
tell 10
freely 10
so 10
art 10
went 10
on 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
there 10
and 10
though 10
it 10
could 10
only 10
have 10
been 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
he 10
made 10
rare 10
hay 10
of 10
the 10
place 10
all 10
the 10
manuscript 10
had 10
been 10
burned 10
and 10
the 10
blue 10
flames 10
were 10
flickering 10
amongst 10
the 10
white 10
ashes 10
the 10
cylinders 10
of 10
your 10
phonograph 10
too 10
were 10
thrown 10
on 10
the 10
fire 10
and 10
the 10
wax 10
had 10
helped 10
the 10
flames 10
here 10
i 10
interrupted 10
thank 10
god 10
there 10
is 10
the 10
other 10
copy 10
in 10
the 10
safe 10
his 10
face 10
lit 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
but 10
fell 10
again 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
ran 10
downstairs 10
then 10
but 10
could 10
see 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
him 10
i 10
looked 10
into 10
renfields 10
room 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
trace 10
there 10
except 10
again 10
he 10
paused 10
go 10
on 10
said 10
harker 10
hoarsely 10
so 10
he 10
bowed 10
his 10
head 10
and 10
moistening 10
his 10
lips 10
with 10
his 10
tongue 10
added 10
except 10
that 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
is 10
dead 10
mrs 10
harker 10
raised 10
her 10
head 10
looking 10
from 10
one 10
to 10
the 10
other 10
of 10
us 10
she 10
said 10
solemnly 10
gods 10
will 10
be 10
done 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
feel 10
that 10
art 10
was 10
keeping 10
back 10
something 10
but 10
as 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
a 10
purpose 10
i 10
said 10
nothing 10
van 10
helsing 10
turned 10
to 10
morris 10
and 10
asked 10
and 10
you 10
friend 10
quincey 10
have 10
you 10
any 10
to 10
tell 10
a 10
little 10
he 10
answered 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
much 10
eventually 10
but 10
at 10
present 10
i 10
cant 10
say 10
i 10
thought 10
it 10
well 10
to 10
know 10
if 10
possible 10
where 10
the 10
count 10
would 10
go 10
when 10
he 10
left 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
see 10
him 10
but 10
i 10
saw 10
a 10
bat 10
rise 10
from 10
renfields 10
window 10
and 10
flap 10
westward 10
i 10
expected 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
in 10
some 10
shape 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
carfax 10
but 10
he 10
evidently 10
sought 10
some 10
other 10
lair 10
he 10
will 10
not 10
be 10
back 10
tonight 10
for 10
the 10
sky 10
is 10
reddening 10
in 10
the 10
east 10
and 10
the 10
dawn 10
is 10
close 10
we 10
must 10
work 10
tomorrow 10
he 10
said 10
the 10
latter 10
words 10
through 10
his 10
shut 10
teeth 10
for 10
a 10
space 10
of 10
perhaps 10
a 10
couple 10
of 10
minutes 10
there 10
was 10
silence 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
fancy 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
our 10
hearts 10
beating 10
then 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
placing 10
his 10
hand 10
tenderly 10
on 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
head 10
and 10
now 10
madam 10
mina 10
poor 10
dear 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
tell 10
us 10
exactly 10
what 10
happened 10
god 10
knows 10
that 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
want 10
that 10
you 10
be 10
pained 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
need 10
that 10
we 10
know 10
all 10
for 10
now 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
has 10
all 10
work 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
quick 10
and 10
sharp 10
and 10
in 10
deadly 10
earnest 10
the 10
day 10
is 10
close 10
to 10
us 10
that 10
must 10
end 10
all 10
if 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
so 10
and 10
now 10
is 10
the 10
chance 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
live 10
and 10
learn 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
lady 10
shivered 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
tension 10
of 10
her 10
nerves 10
as 10
she 10
clasped 10
her 10
husband 10
closer 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
bent 10
her 10
head 10
lower 10
and 10
lower 10
still 10
on 10
his 10
breast 10
then 10
she 10
raised 10
her 10
head 10
proudly 10
and 10
held 10
out 10
one 10
hand 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
who 10
took 10
it 10
in 10
his 10
and 10
after 10
stooping 10
and 10
kissing 10
it 10
reverently 10
held 10
it 10
fast 10
the 10
other 10
hand 10
was 10
locked 10
in 10
that 10
of 10
her 10
husband 10
who 10
held 10
his 10
other 10
arm 10
thrown 10
round 10
her 10
protectingly 10
after 10
a 10
pause 10
in 10
which 10
she 10
was 10
evidently 10
ordering 10
her 10
thoughts 10
she 10
began 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
sleeping 10
draught 10
which 10
you 10
had 10
so 10
kindly 10
given 10
me 10
but 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
it 10
did 10
not 10
act 10
i 10
seemed 10
to 10
become 10
more 10
wakeful 10
and 10
myriads 10
of 10
horrible 10
fancies 10
began 10
to 10
crowd 10
in 10
upon 10
my 10
mind 10
all 10
of 10
them 10
connected 10
with 10
death 10
and 10
vampires 10
with 10
blood 10
and 10
pain 10
and 10
trouble 10
her 10
husband 10
involuntarily 10
groaned 10
as 10
she 10
turned 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
said 10
lovingly 10
do 10
not 10
fret 10
dear 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
brave 10
and 10
strong 10
and 10
help 10
me 10
through 10
the 10
horrible 10
task 10
if 10
you 10
only 10
knew 10
what 10
an 10
effort 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
tell 10
of 10
this 10
fearful 10
thing 10
at 10
all 10
you 10
would 10
understand 10
how 10
much 10
i 10
need 10
your 10
help 10
well 10
i 10
saw 10
i 10
must 10
try 10
to 10
help 10
the 10
medicine 10
to 10
its 10
work 10
with 10
my 10
will 10
if 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
do 10
me 10
any 10
good 10
so 10
i 10
resolutely 10
set 10
myself 10
to 10
sleep 10
sure 10
enough 10
sleep 10
must 10
soon 10
have 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
for 10
i 10
remember 10
no 10
more 10
jonathan 10
coming 10
in 10
had 10
not 10
waked 10
me 10
for 10
he 10
lay 10
by 10
my 10
side 10
when 10
next 10
i 10
remember 10
there 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
the 10
same 10
thin 10
white 10
mist 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
before 10
noticed 10
but 10
i 10
forget 10
now 10
if 10
you 10
know 10
of 10
this 10
you 10
will 10
find 10
it 10
in 10
my 10
diary 10
which 10
i 10
shall 10
show 10
you 10
later 10
i 10
felt 10
the 10
same 10
vague 10
terror 10
which 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
me 10
before 10
and 10
the 10
same 10
sense 10
of 10
some 10
presence 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
wake 10
jonathan 10
but 10
found 10
that 10
he 10
slept 10
so 10
soundly 10
that 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
it 10
was 10
he 10
who 10
had 10
taken 10
the 10
sleeping 10
draught 10
and 10
not 10
i 10
i 10
tried 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
wake 10
him 10
this 10
caused 10
me 10
a 10
great 10
fear 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
around 10
terrified 10
then 10
indeed 10
my 10
heart 10
sank 10
within 10
me 10
beside 10
the 10
bed 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
stepped 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
mist 10
or 10
rather 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
mist 10
had 10
turned 10
into 10
his 10
figure 10
for 10
it 10
had 10
entirely 10
disappeared 10
stood 10
a 10
tall 10
thin 10
man 10
all 10
in 10
black 10
i 10
knew 10
him 10
at 10
once 10
from 10
the 10
description 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
the 10
waxen 10
face 10
the 10
high 10
aquiline 10
nose 10
on 10
which 10
the 10
light 10
fell 10
in 10
a 10
thin 10
white 10
line 10
the 10
parted 10
red 10
lips 10
with 10
the 10
sharp 10
white 10
teeth 10
showing 10
between 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
eyes 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
seemed 10
to 10
see 10
in 10
the 10
sunset 10
on 10
the 10
windows 10
of 10
st 10
marys 10
church 10
at 10
witby 10
i 10
knew 10
too 10
the 10
red 10
scar 10
on 10
his 10
forehead 10
where 10
jonathan 10
had 10
struck 10
him 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
my 10
heart 10
stood 10
still 10
and 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
screamed 10
out 10
only 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
paralyzed 10
in 10
the 10
pause 10
he 10
spoke 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
keen 10
cutting 10
whisper 10
pointing 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
to 10
jonathan 10
silence 10
if 10
you 10
make 10
a 10
sound 10
i 10
shall 10
take 10
him 10
and 10
dash 10
his 10
brains 10
out 10
before 10
your 10
very 10
eyes 10
i 10
was 10
appalled 10
and 10
was 10
too 10
bewildered 10
to 10
do 10
or 10
say 10
anything 10
with 10
a 10
mocking 10
smile 10
he 10
placed 10
one 10
hand 10
upon 10
my 10
shoulder 10
and 10
holding 10
me 10
tight 10
bared 10
my 10
throat 10
with 10
the 10
other 10
saying 10
as 10
he 10
did 10
so 10
first 10
a 10
little 10
refreshment 10
to 10
reward 10
my 10
exertions 10
you 10
may 10
as 10
well 10
be 10
quiet 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
the 10
first 10
time 10
or 10
the 10
second 10
that 10
your 10
veins 10
have 10
appeased 10
my 10
thirst 10
i 10
was 10
bewildered 10
and 10
strangely 10
enough 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
want 10
to 10
hinder 10
him 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
part 10
of 10
the 10
horrible 10
curse 10
that 10
such 10
is 10
when 10
his 10
touch 10
is 10
on 10
his 10
victim 10
and 10
oh 10
my 10
god 10
my 10
god 10
pity 10
me 10
he 10
placed 10
his 10
reeking 10
lips 10
upon 10
my 10
throat 10
her 10
husband 10
groaned 10
again 10
she 10
clasped 10
his 10
hand 10
harder 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
him 10
pityingly 10
as 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
the 10
injured 10
one 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
i 10
felt 10
my 10
strength 10
fading 10
away 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
a 10
half 10
swoon 10
how 10
long 10
this 10
horrible 10
thing 10
lasted 10
i 10
know 10
not 10
but 10
it 10
seemed 10
that 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
must 10
have 10
passed 10
before 10
he 10
took 10
his 10
foul 10
awful 10
sneering 10
mouth 10
away 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
drip 10
with 10
the 10
fresh 10
bloodthe 10
remembrance 10
seemed 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
to 10
overpower 10
her 10
and 10
she 10
drooped 10
and 10
would 10
have 10
sunk 10
down 10
but 10
for 10
her 10
husbands 10
sustaining 10
arm 10
with 10
a 10
great 10
effort 10
she 10
recovered 10
herself 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
then 10
he 10
spoke 10
to 10
me 10
mockingly 10
and 10
so 10
you 10
like 10
the 10
others 10
would 10
play 10
your 10
brains 10
against 10
mine 10
you 10
would 10
help 10
these 10
men 10
to 10
hunt 10
me 10
and 10
frustrate 10
me 10
in 10
my 10
design 10
you 10
know 10
now 10
and 10
they 10
know 10
in 10
part 10
already 10
and 10
will 10
know 10
in 10
full 10
before 10
long 10
what 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
cross 10
my 10
path 10
they 10
should 10
have 10
kept 10
their 10
energies 10
for 10
use 10
closer 10
to 10
home 10
whilst 10
they 10
played 10
wits 10
against 10
me 10
against 10
me 10
who 10
commanded 10
nations 10
and 10
intrigued 10
for 10
them 10
and 10
fought 10
for 10
them 10
hundreds 10
of 10
years 10
before 10
they 10
were 10
born 10
i 10
was 10
countermining 10
them 10
and 10
you 10

be 10
later 10
on 10
my 10
companion 10
and 10
my 10
helper 10
you 10
shall 10
be 10
avenged 10
in 10
turn 10
for 10
not 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
but 10
shall 10
minister 10
to 10
your 10
needs 10
but 10
as 10
yet 10
you 10
are 10
to 10
be 10
punished 10
for 10
what 10
you 10
have 10
done 10
you 10
have 10
aided 10
in 10
thwarting 10
me 10
now 10
you 10
shall 10
come 10
to 10
my 10
call 10
when 10
my 10
brain 10
says 10
come 10
to 10
you 10
you 10
shall 10
cross 10
land 10
or 10
sea 10
to 10
do 10
my 10
bidding 10
and 10
to 10
that 10
end 10
this 10
with 10
that 10
he 10
pulled 10
open 10
his 10
shirt 10
and 10
with 10
his 10
long 10
sharp 10
nails 10
opened 10
a 10
vein 10
in 10
his 10
breast 10
when 10
the 10
blood 10
began 10
to 10
spurt 10
out 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
hands 10
in 10
one 10
of 10
his 10
holding 10
them 10
tight 10
and 10
with 10
the 10
other 10
seized 10
my 10
neck 10
and 10
pressed 10
my 10
mouth 10
to 10
the 10
wound 10
so 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
either 10
suffocate 10
or 10
swallow 10
some 10
to 10
the 10
oh 10
my 10
god 10
my 10
god 10
what 10
have 10
i 10
done 10
what 10
have 10
i 10
done 10
to 10
deserve 10
such 10
a 10
fate 10
i 10
who 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
walk 10
in 10
meekness 10
and 10
righteousness 10
all 10
my 10
days 10
god 10
pity 10
me 10
look 10
down 10
on 10
a 10
poor 10
soul 10
in 10
worse 10
than 10
mortal 10
peril 10
and 10
in 10
mercy 10
pity 10
those 10
to 10
whom 10
she 10
is 10
dear 10
then 10
she 10
began 10
to 10
rub 10
her 10
lips 10
as 10
though 10
to 10
cleanse 10
them 10
from 10
pollution 10
as 10
she 10
was 10
telling 10
her 10
terrible 10
story 10
the 10
eastern 10
sky 10
began 10
to 10
quicken 10
and 10
everything 10
became 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
clear 10
harker 10
was 10
still 10
and 10
quiet 10
but 10
over 10
his 10
face 10
as 10
the 10
awful 10
narrative 10
went 10
on 10
came 10
a 10
grey 10
look 10
which 10
deepened 10
and 10
deepened 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
light 10
till 10
when 10
the 10
first 10
red 10
streak 10
of 10
the 10
coming 10
dawn 10
shot 10
up 10

out 10
against 10

now 10
with 10
the 10
tears 10
running 10
down 10
her 10
dear 10
cheeks 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
in 10
trouble 10
and 10
trial 10
that 10
our 10
faith 10
is 10
tested 10
that 10
we 10
must 10
keep 10
on 10
trusting 10
and 10
that 10
god 10
will 10
aid 10
us 10
up 10

oh 10
my 10
god 10
what 10
end 10
to 10

to 10
work 10
when 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
dr 10
seward 10
had 10
come 10
back 10
from 10
seeing 10
poor 10
renfield 10
we 10
went 10
gravely 10
into 10
what 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
first 10
dr 10
seward 10
told 10
us 10
that 10
when 10
he 10
and 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
gone 10
down 10
to 10
the 10
room 10
below 10
they 10
had 10
found 10
renfield 10
lying 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
heap 10
his 10
face 10
was 10
all 10
bruised 10
and 10
crushed 10
in 10
and 10
the 10
bones 10
of 10
the 10
neck 10
were 10
broken 10
dr 10
seward 10
asked 10
the 10
attendant 10
who 10
was 10
on 10
duty 10
in 10
the 10
passage 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
heard 10
anything 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
been 10
sitting 10
down 10
he 10
confessed 10
to 10
half 10
dozing 10
when 10
he 10
heard 10
loud 10
voices 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
and 10
then 10
renfield 10
had 10
called 10
out 10
loudly 10
several 10
times 10
god 10
god 10
god 10
after 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
sound 10
of 10
falling 10
and 10
when 10
he 10
entered 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
found 10
him 10
lying 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
face 10
down 10
just 10
as 10
the 10
doctors 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
van 10
helsing 10
asked 10
if 10
he 10
had 10
heard 10
voices 10
or 10
a 10
voice 10
and 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
say 10
that 10
at 10
first 10
it 10
had 10
seemed 10
to 10
him 10
as 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
two 10
but 10
as 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
one 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
it 10
could 10
have 10
been 10
only 10
one 10
he 10
could 10
swear 10
to 10
it 10
if 10
required 10
that 10
the 10
word 10
god 10
was 10
spoken 10
by 10
the 10
patient 10
dr 10
seward 10
said 10
to 10
us 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
alone 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
wish 10
to 10
go 10
into 10
the 10
matter 10
the 10
question 10
of 10
an 10
inquest 10
had 10
to 10
be 10
considered 10
and 10
it 10
would 10
never 10
do 10
to 10
put 10
forward 10
the 10
truth 10
as 10
no 10
one 10
would 10
believe 10
it 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
he 10
thought 10
that 10
on 10
the 10
attendants 10
evidence 10
he 10
could 10
give 10
a 10
certificate 10
of 10
death 10
by 10
misadventure 10
in 10
falling 10
from 10
bed 10
in 10
case 10
the 10
coroner 10
should 10
demand 10
it 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
a 10
formal 10
inquest 10
necessarily 10
to 10
the 10
same 10
result 10
when 10
the 10
question 10
began 10
to 10
be 10
discussed 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
should 10
be 10
our 10
next 10
step 10
the 10
very 10
first 10
thing 10
we 10
decided 10
was 10
that 10
mina 10
should 10
be 10
in 10
full 10
confidence 10
that 10
nothing 10
of 10
any 10
sort 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
painful 10
should 10
be 10
kept 10
from 10
her 10
she 10
herself 10
agreed 10
as 10
to 10
its 10
wisdom 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
pitiful 10
to 10
see 10
her 10
so 10
brave 10
and 10
yet 10
so 10
sorrowful 10
and 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
depth 10
of 10
despair 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
no 10
concealment 10
she 10
said 10
alas 10
we 10
have 10
had 10
too 10
much 10
already 10
and 10
besides 10
there 10
is 10
nothing 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
that 10
can 10
give 10
me 10
more 10
pain 10
than 10
i 10
have 10
already 10
endured 10
than 10
i 10
suffer 10
now 10
whatever 10
may 10
happen 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
of 10
new 10
hope 10
or 10
of 10
new 10
courage 10
to 10
me 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
looking 10
at 10
her 10
fixedly 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
and 10
said 10
suddenly 10
but 10
quietly 10
but 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
are 10
you 10
not 10
afraid 10
not 10
for 10
yourself 10
but 10
for 10
others 10
from 10
yourself 10
after 10
what 10
has 10
happened 10
her 10
face 10
grew 10
set 10
in 10
its 10
lines 10
but 10
her 10
eyes 10
shone 10
with 10
the 10
devotion 10
of 10
a 10
martyr 10
as 10
she 10
answered 10
ah 10
no 10
for 10
my 10
mind 10
is 10
made 10
up 10
to 10
what 10
he 10
asked 10
gently 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
very 10
still 10
for 10
each 10
in 10
our 10
own 10
way 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
vague 10
idea 10
of 10
what 10
she 10
meant 10
her 10
answer 10
came 10
with 10
direct 10
simplicity 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
was 10
simply 10
stating 10
a 10
fact 10
because 10
if 10
i 10
find 10
in 10
myself 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
watch 10
keenly 10
for 10
it 10
a 10
sign 10
of 10
harm 10
to 10
any 10
that 10
i 10
love 10
i 10
shall 10
die 10
you 10
would 10
not 10
kill 10
yourself 10
he 10
asked 10
hoarsely 10
i 10
would 10
if 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
friend 10
who 10
loved 10
me 10
who 10
would 10
save 10
me 10
such 10
a 10
pain 10
and 10
so 10
desperate 10
an 10
effort 10
she 10
looked 10
at 10
him 10
meaningly 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
he 10
was 10
sitting 10
down 10
but 10
now 10
he 10
rose 10
and 10
came 10
close 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
put 10
his 10
hand 10
on 10
her 10
head 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
solemnly 10
my 10
child 10
there 10
is 10
such 10
an 10
one 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
for 10
your 10
good 10
for 10
myself 10
i 10
could 10
hold 10
it 10
in 10
my 10
account 10
with 10
god 10
to 10
find 10
such 10
an 10
euthanasia 10
for 10
you 10
even 10
at 10
this 10
moment 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
best 10
nay 10
were 10
it 10
safe 10
but 10
my 10
child 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
he 10
seemed 10
choked 10
and 10
a 10
great 10
sob 10
rose 10
in 10
his 10
throat 10
he 10
gulped 10
it 10
down 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
there 10
are 10
here 10
some 10
who 10
would 10
stand 10
between 10
you 10
and 10
death 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
die 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
die 10
by 10
any 10
hand 10
but 10
least 10
of 10
all 10
your 10
own 10
until 10
the 10
other 10
who 10
has 10
fouled 10
your 10
sweet 10
life 10
is 10
true 10
dead 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
die 10
for 10
if 10
he 10
is 10
still 10
with 10
the 10
quick 10
undead 10
your 10
death 10
would 10
make 10
you 10
even 10
as 10
he 10
is 10
no 10
you 10
must 10
live 10
you 10
must 10
struggle 10
and 10
strive 10
to 10
live 10
though 10
death 10
would 10
seem 10
a 10
boon 10
unspeakable 10
you 10
must 10
fight 10
death 10
himself 10
though 10
he 10
come 10
to 10
you 10
in 10
pain 10
or 10
in 10
joy 10
by 10
the 10
day 10
or 10
the 10
night 10
in 10
safety 10
or 10
in 10
peril 10
on 10
your 10
living 10
soul 10
i 10
charge 10
you 10
that 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
die 10
nay 10
nor 10
think 10
of 10
death 10
till 10
this 10
great 10
evil 10
be 10
past 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
grew 10
white 10
as 10
death 10
and 10
shook 10
and 10
shivered 10
as 10
i 10
have 10
seen 10
a 10
quicksand 10
shake 10
and 10
shiver 10
at 10
the 10
incoming 10
of 10
the 10
tide 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
silent 10
we 10
could 10
do 10
nothing 10
at 10
length 10
she 10
grew 10
more 10
calm 10
and 10
turning 10
to 10
him 10
said 10
sweetly 10
but 10
oh 10
so 10
sorrowfully 10
as 10
she 10
held 10
out 10
her 10
hand 10
i 10
promise 10
you 10
my 10
dear 10
friend 10
that 10
if 10
god 10
will 10
let 10
me 10
live 10
i 10
shall 10
strive 10
to 10
do 10
so 10
till 10
if 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
in 10
his 10
good 10
time 10
this 10
horror 10
may 10
have 10
passed 10
away 10
from 10
me 10
she 10
was 10
so 10
good 10
and 10
brave 10
that 10
we 10
all 10
felt 10
that 10
our 10
hearts 10
were 10
strengthened 10
to 10
work 10
and 10
endure 10
for 10
her 10
and 10
we 10
began 10
to 10
discuss 10
what 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
told 10
her 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
to 10
have 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
in 10
the 10
safe 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
or 10
diaries 10
and 10
phonographs 10
we 10
might 10
hereafter 10
use 10
and 10
was 10
to 10
keep 10
the 10
record 10
as 10
she 10
had 10
done 10
before 10
she 10
was 10
pleased 10
with 10
the 10
prospect 10
of 10
anything 10
to 10
do 10
if 10
pleased 10
could 10
be 10
used 10
in 10
connection 10
with 10
so 10
grim 10
an 10
interest 10
as 10
usual 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
thought 10
ahead 10
of 10
everyone 10
else 10
and 10
was 10
prepared 10
with 10
an 10
exact 10
ordering 10
of 10
our 10
work 10
it 10
is 10
perhaps 10
well 10
he 10
said 10
that 10
at 10
our 10
meeting 10
after 10
our 10
visit 10
to 10
carfax 10
we 10
decided 10
not 10
to 10
do 10
anything 10
with 10
the 10
earth 10
boxes 10
that 10
lay 10
there 10
had 10
we 10
done 10
so 10
the 10
count 10
must 10
have 10
guessed 10
our 10
purpose 10
and 10
would 10
doubtless 10
have 10
taken 10
measures 10
in 10
advance 10
to 10
frustrate 10
such 10
an 10
effort 10
with 10
regard 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
but 10
now 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
know 10
our 10
intentions 10
nay 10
more 10
in 10
all 10
probability 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
know 10
that 10
such 10
a 10
power 10
exists 10
to 10
us 10
as 10
can 10
sterilize 10
his 10
lairs 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
cannot 10
use 10
them 10
as 10
of 10
old 10
we 10
are 10
now 10
so 10
much 10
further 10
advanced 10
in 10
our 10
knowledge 10
as 10
to 10
their 10
disposition 10
that 10
when 10
we 10
have 10
examined 10
the 10
house 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
we 10
may 10
track 10
the 10
very 10
last 10
of 10
them 10
today 10
then 10
is 10
ours 10
and 10
in 10
it 10
rests 10
our 10
hope 10
the 10
sun 10
that 10
rose 10
on 10
our 10
sorrow 10
this 10
morning 10
guards 10
us 10
in 10
its 10
course 10
until 10
it 10
sets 10
tonight 10
that 10
monster 10
must 10
retain 10
whatever 10
form 10
he 10
now 10
has 10
he 10
is 10
confined 10
within 10
the 10
limitations 10
of 10
his 10
earthly 10
envelope 10
he 10
cannot 10
melt 10
into 10
thin 10
air 10
nor 10
disappear 10
through 10
cracks 10
or 10
chinks 10
or 10
crannies 10
if 10
he 10
go 10
through 10
a 10
doorway 10
he 10
must 10
open 10
the 10
door 10
like 10
a 10
mortal 10
and 10
so 10
we 10
have 10
this 10
day 10
to 10
hunt 10
out 10
all 10
his 10
lairs 10
and 10
sterilize 10
them 10
so 10
we 10
shall 10
if 10
we 10
have 10
not 10
yet 10
catch 10
him 10
and 10
destroy 10
him 10
drive 10
him 10
to 10
bay 10
in 10
some 10
place 10
where 10
the 10
catching 10
and 10
the 10
destroying 10
shall 10
be 10
in 10
time 10
sure 10
here 10
i 10
started 10
up 10
for 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
contain 10
myself 10
at 10
the 10
thought 10
that 10
the 10
minutes 10
and 10
seconds 10
so 10
preciously 10
laden 10
with 10
minas 10
life 10
and 10
happiness 10
were 10
flying 10
from 10
us 10
since 10
whilst 10
we 10
talked 10
action 10
was 10
impossible 10
but 10
van 10
helsing 10
held 10
up 10
his 10
hand 10
warningly 10
nay 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
he 10
said 10
in 10
this 10
the 10
quickest 10
way 10
home 10
is 10
the 10
longest 10
way 10
so 10
your 10
proverb 10
say 10
we 10
shall 10
all 10
act 10
and 10
act 10
with 10
desperate 10
quick 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
has 10
come 10
but 10
think 10
in 10
all 10
probable 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
situation 10
is 10
in 10
that 10
house 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
the 10
count 10
may 10
have 10
many 10
houses 10
which 10
he 10
has 10
bought 10
of 10
them 10
he 10
will 10
have 10
deeds 10
of 10
purchase 10
keys 10
and 10
other 10
things 10
he 10
will 10
have 10
paper 10
that 10
he 10
write 10
on 10
he 10
will 10
have 10
his 10
book 10
of 10
cheques 10
there 10
are 10
many 10
belongings 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
somewhere 10
why 10
not 10
in 10
this 10
place 10
so 10
central 10
so 10
quiet 10
where 10
he 10
come 10
and 10
go 10
by 10
the 10
front 10
or 10
the 10
back 10
at 10
all 10
hours 10
when 10
in 10
the 10
very 10
vast 10
of 10
the 10
traffic 10
there 10
is 10
none 10
to 10
notice 10
we 10
shall 10
go 10
there 10
and 10
search 10
that 10
house 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
learn 10
what 10
it 10
holds 10
then 10
we 10
do 10
what 10
our 10
friend 10
arthur 10
call 10
in 10
his 10
phrases 10
of 10
hunt 10
stop 10
the 10
earths 10
and 10
so 10
we 10
run 10
down 10
our 10
old 10
fox 10
so 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
then 10
let 10
us 10
come 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
cried 10
we 10
are 10
wasting 10
the 10
precious 10
precious 10
time 10
the 10
professor 10
did 10
not 10
move 10
but 10
simply 10
said 10
and 10
how 10
are 10
we 10
to 10
get 10
into 10
that 10
house 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
any 10
way 10
i 10
cried 10
we 10
shall 10
break 10
in 10
if 10
need 10
be 10
and 10
your 10
police 10
where 10
will 10
they 10
be 10
and 10
what 10
will 10
they 10
say 10
i 10
was 10
staggered 10
but 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
wished 10
to 10
delay 10
he 10
had 10
a 10
good 10
reason 10
for 10
it 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
as 10
quietly 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
dont 10
wait 10
more 10
than 10
need 10
be 10
you 10
know 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
what 10
torture 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
ah 10
my 10
child 10
that 10
i 10
do 10
and 10
indeed 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
wish 10
of 10
me 10
to 10
add 10
to 10
your 10
anguish 10
but 10
just 10
think 10
what 10
can 10
we 10
do 10
until 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
be 10
at 10
movement 10
then 10
will 10
come 10
our 10
time 10
i 10
have 10
thought 10
and 10
thought 10
and 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
the 10
simplest 10
way 10
is 10
the 10
best 10
of 10
all 10
now 10
we 10
wish 10
to 10
get 10
into 10
the 10
house 10
but 10
we 10
have 10
no 10
key 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
i 10
nodded 10
now 10
suppose 10
that 10
you 10
were 10
in 10
truth 10
the 10
owner 10
of 10
that 10
house 10
and 10
could 10
not 10
still 10
get 10
in 10
and 10
think 10
there 10
was 10
to 10
you 10
no 10
conscience 10
of 10
the 10
housebreaker 10
what 10
would 10
you 10
do 10
i 10
should 10
get 10
a 10
respectable 10
locksmith 10
and 10
set 10
him 10
to 10
work 10
to 10
pick 10
the 10
lock 10
for 10
me 10
and 10
your 10
police 10
they 10
would 10
interfere 10
would 10
they 10
not 10
oh 10
no 10
not 10
if 10
they 10
knew 10
the 10
man 10
was 10
properly 10
employed 10
then 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
as 10
keenly 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
all 10
that 10
is 10
in 10
doubt 10
is 10
the 10
conscience 10
of 10
the 10
employer 10
and 10
the 10
belief 10
of 10
your 10
policemen 10
as 10
to 10
whether 10
or 10
not 10
that 10
employer 10
has 10
a 10
good 10
conscience 10
or 10
a 10
bad 10
one 10
your 10
police 10
must 10
indeed 10
be 10
zealous 10
men 10
and 10
clever 10
oh 10
so 10
clever 10
in 10
reading 10
the 10
heart 10
that 10
they 10
trouble 10
themselves 10
in 10
such 10
matter 10
no 10
no 10
my 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
you 10
go 10
take 10
the 10
lock 10
off 10
a 10
hundred 10
empty 10
houses 10
in 10
this 10
your 10
london 10
or 10
of 10
any 10
city 10
in 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
if 10
you 10
do 10
it 10
as 10
such 10
things 10
are 10
rightly 10
done 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
such 10
things 10
are 10
rightly 10
done 10
no 10
one 10
will 10
interfere 10
i 10
have 10
read 10
of 10
a 10
gentleman 10
who 10
owned 10
a 10
so 10
fine 10
house 10
in 10
london 10
and 10
when 10
he 10
went 10
for 10
months 10
of 10
summer 10
to 10

and 10

come 10
and 10
broke 10
window 10
at 10
back 10
and 10
got 10
in 10
then 10
he 10
went 10
and 10
made 10
open 10
the 10
shutters 10
in 10
front 10
and 10
walk 10
out 10
and 10
in 10
through 10
the 10
door 10
before 10
the 10
very 10
eyes 10
of 10
the 10
police 10
then 10
he 10
have 10
an 10
auction 10
in 10
that 10
house 10
and 10
advertise 10
it 10
and 10
put 10
up 10
big 10
notice 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
day 10
come 10
he 10

off 10
by 10
a 10
great 10
auctioneer 10
all 10
the 10
goods 10
of 10
that 10
other 10
man 10
who 10
own 10
them 10
then 10
he 10
go 10
to 10
a 10
builder 10
and 10
he 10
sell 10
him 10
that 10
house 10
making 10
an 10
agreement 10
that 10
he 10
pull 10
it 10
down 10
and 10
take 10
all 10
away 10
within 10
a 10
certain 10
time 10
and 10
your 10
police 10
and 10
other 10
authority 10
help 10
him 10
all 10
they 10
can 10
and 10
when 10
that 10
owner 10
come 10
back 10
from 10
his 10
holiday 10
in 10
switzerland 10
he 10
find 10
only 10
an 10
empty 10
hole 10
where 10
his 10
house 10
had 10
been 10
this 10
was 10
all 10
done 10
en 10
regle 10
and 10
in 10
our 10
work 10
we 10
shall 10
be 10
en 10
regle 10
too 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
go 10
so 10
early 10
that 10
the 10
policemen 10
who 10
have 10
then 10
little 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
shall 10
deem 10
it 10
strange 10
but 10
we 10
shall 10
go 10
after 10
ten 10
oclock 10
when 10
there 10
are 10
many 10
about 10
and 10
such 10
things 10
would 10
be 10
done 10
were 10
we 10
indeed 10
owners 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
see 10
how 10
right 10
he 10
was 10
and 10
the 10
terrible 10
despair 10
of 10
minas 10
face 10
became 10
relaxed 10
in 10
thought 10
there 10
was 10
hope 10
in 10
such 10
good 10
counsel 10
van 10
helsing 10
went 10
on 10
when 10
once 10
within 10
that 10
house 10
we 10
may 10
find 10
more 10
clues 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
can 10
remain 10
there 10
whilst 10
the 10
rest 10
find 10
the 10
other 10
places 10
where 10
there 10
be 10
more 10
earth 10
boxes 10
at 10
bermondsey 10
and 10
mile 10
end 10
lord 10
godalming 10
stood 10
up 10
i 10
can 10
be 10
of 10
some 10
use 10
here 10
he 10
said 10
i 10
shall 10
wire 10
to 10
my 10
people 10
to 10
have 10
horses 10
and 10
carriages 10
where 10
they 10
will 10
be 10
most 10
convenient 10
look 10
here 10
old 10
fellow 10
said 10
morris 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
capital 10
idea 10
to 10
have 10
all 10
ready 10
in 10
case 10
we 10
want 10
to 10
go 10
horse 10
backing 10
but 10
dont 10
you 10
think 10
that 10
one 10
of 10
your 10
snappy 10
carriages 10
with 10
its 10
heraldic 10
adornments 10
in 10
a 10
byway 10
of 10
walworth 10
or 10
mile 10
end 10
would 10
attract 10
too 10
much 10
attention 10
for 10
our 10
purpose 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
we 10
ought 10
to 10
take 10
cabs 10
when 10
we 10
go 10
south 10
or 10
east 10
and 10
even 10
leave 10
them 10
somewhere 10
near 10
the 10
neighborhood 10
we 10
are 10
going 10
to 10
friend 10
quincey 10
is 10
right 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
his 10
head 10
is 10
what 10
you 10
call 10
in 10
plane 10
with 10
the 10
horizon 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
difficult 10
thing 10
that 10
we 10
go 10
to 10
do 10
and 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
want 10
no 10
peoples 10
to 10
watch 10
us 10
if 10
so 10
it 10
may 10
mina 10
took 10
a 10
growing 10
interest 10
in 10
everything 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
rejoiced 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
exigency 10
of 10
affairs 10
was 10
helping 10
her 10
to 10
forget 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
the 10
terrible 10
experience 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
she 10
was 10
very 10
very 10
pale 10
almost 10
ghastly 10
and 10
so 10
thin 10
that 10
her 10
lips 10
were 10
drawn 10
away 10
showing 10
her 10
teeth 10
in 10
somewhat 10
of 10
prominence 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
mention 10
this 10
last 10
lest 10
it 10
should 10
give 10
her 10
needless 10
pain 10
but 10
it 10
made 10
my 10
blood 10
run 10
cold 10
in 10
my 10
veins 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
what 10
had 10
occurred 10
with 10
poor 10
lucy 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
sucked 10
her 10
blood 10
as 10
yet 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
the 10
teeth 10
growing 10
sharper 10
but 10
the 10
time 10
as 10
yet 10
was 10
short 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
time 10
for 10
fear 10
when 10
we 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
discussion 10
of 10
the 10
sequence 10
of 10
our 10
efforts 10
and 10
of 10
the 10
disposition 10
of 10
our 10
forces 10
there 10
were 10
new 10
sources 10
of 10
doubt 10
it 10
was 10
finally 10
agreed 10
that 10
before 10
starting 10
for 10
piccadilly 10
we 10
should 10
destroy 10
the 10
counts 10
lair 10
close 10
at 10
hand 10
in 10
case 10
he 10
should 10
find 10
it 10
out 10
too 10
soon 10
we 10
should 10
thus 10
be 10
still 10
ahead 10
of 10
him 10
in 10
our 10
work 10
of 10
destruction 10
and 10
his 10
presence 10
in 10
his 10
purely 10
material 10
shape 10
and 10
at 10
his 10
weakest 10
might 10
give 10
us 10
some 10
new 10
clue 10
a 10
s 10
to 10
the 10
disposal 10
of 10
forces 10
it 10
was 10
suggested 10
by 10
the 10
professor 10
that 10
after 10
our 10
visit 10
to 10
carfax 10
we 10
should 10
all 10
enter 10
the 10
house 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
that 10
the 10
two 10
doctors 10
and 10
i 10
should 10
remain 10
there 10
whilst 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
quincey 10
found 10
the 10
lairs 10
at 10
walworth 10
and 10
mile 10
end 10
and 10
destroyed 10
them 10
it 10
was 10
possible 10
if 10
not 10
likely 10
the 10
professor 10
urged 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
might 10
appear 10
in 10
piccadilly 10
during 10
the 10
day 10
and 10
that 10
if 10
so 10
we 10
might 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
cope 10
with 10
him 10
then 10
and 10
there 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
we 10
might 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
follow 10
him 10
in 10
force 10
to 10
this 10
plan 10
i 10
strenuously 10
objected 10
and 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
my 10
going 10
was 10
concerned 10
for 10
i 10
said 10
that 10
i 10
intended 10
to 10
stay 10
and 10
protect 10
mina 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
my 10
mind 10
was 10
made 10
up 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
but 10
mina 10
would 10
not 10
listen 10
to 10
my 10
objection 10
she 10
said 10
that 10
there 10
might 10
be 10
some 10
law 10
matter 10
in 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
be 10
useful 10
that 10
amongst 10
the 10
counts 10
papers 10
might 10
be 10
some 10
clue 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
understand 10
out 10
of 10
my 10
experience 10
in 10
transylvania 10
and 10
that 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
all 10
the 10
strength 10
we 10
could 10
muster 10
was 10
required 10
to 10
cope 10
with 10
the 10
counts 10
extraordinary 10
power 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
give 10
in 10
for 10
minas 10
resolution 10
was 10
fixed 10
she 10
said 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
last 10
hope 10
for 10
her 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
all 10
work 10
together 10
as 10
for 10
me 10
she 10
said 10
i 10
have 10
no 10
fear 10
things 10
have 10
been 10
as 10
bad 10
as 10
they 10
can 10
be 10
and 10
whatever 10
may 10
happen 10
must 10
have 10
in 10
it 10
some 10
element 10
of 10
hope 10
or 10

as 10
with 10
any 10
one 10
present 10
so 10
i 10
started 10
up 10
crying 10
out 10
then 10
in 10
gods 10
name 10
let 10
us 10
come 10

to 10
piccadilly 10
earlier 10

so 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
holding 10
up 10
his 10
hand 10
but 10
why 10
i 10
asked 10
do 10
you 10
forget 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
actually 10
a 10
smile 10
that 10
last 10
night 10
he 10
banqueted 10
heavily 10
and 10
will 10
sleep 10
late 10
did 10
i 10
forget 10

i 10
ever 10
can 10
i 10
ever 10
can 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
ever 10
forget 10
that 10
terrible 10
scene 10
mina 10
struggled 10
hard 10
to 10
keep 10
her 10
brave 10
countenance 10
but 10
the 10
pain 10
overmastered 10
her 10
and 10
she 10
put 10
her 10
hands 10
before 10
her 10
face 10
and 10
shuddered 10
whilst 10
she 10
moaned 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
not 10
intended 10
to 10
recall 10
her 10
frightful 10
experience 10
he 10
had 10
simply 10
lost 10
sight 10
of 10
her 10
and 10
her 10
part 10
in 10
the 10
affair 10
in 10
his 10
intellectual 10
effort 10
when 10
it 10
struck 10
him 10
what 10
he 10
said 10
he 10
was 10
horrified 10
at 10
his 10
thoughtlessness 10
and 10
tried 10
to 10
comfort 10
her 10
oh 10
madam 10
mina 10
he 10
said 10
dear 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
alas 10
that 10
i 10
of 10
all 10
who 10
so 10
reverence 10
you 10
should 10
have 10
said 10
anything 10
so 10
forgetful 10
these 10
stupid 10
old 10
lips 10
of 10
mine 10
and 10
this 10
stupid 10
old 10
head 10
do 10
not 10
deserve 10
so 10
but 10
you 10
will 10
forget 10
it 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
he 10
bent 10
low 10
beside 10
her 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
she 10
took 10
his 10
hand 10
and 10
looking 10
at 10
him 10
through 10
her 10
tears 10
said 10
hoarsely 10
no 10
i 10
shall 10
not 10
forget 10
for 10
it 10

and 10

so 10
much 10
in 10
memory 10
of 10
you 10
that 10

eat 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
be 10
strong 10
breakfast 10
was 10
a 10
strange 10
meal 10
to 10
us 10
all 10
we 10
tried 10
to 10
be 10
cheerful 10
and 10
encourage 10
each 10
other 10
and 10
mina 10
was 10
the 10
brightest 10
and 10
most 10
cheerful 10
of 10
us 10
when 10
it 10
was 10
over 10
van 10
helsing 10
stood 10
up 10
and 10
said 10
now 10
my 10
dear 10
friends 10
we 10
go 10
forth 10
to 10
our 10
terrible 10
enterprise 10
are 10
we 10
all 10
armed 10
as 10
we 10
were 10
on 10
that 10
night 10
when 10
first 10
we 10
visited 10
our 10
enemys 10
lair 10
armed 10
against 10
ghostly 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
carnal 10
attack 10
we 10
all 10
assured 10
him 10
then 10
it 10
is 10
well 10
now 10
madam 10
mina 10
you 10
are 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
quite 10
safe 10
here 10
until 10
the 10
sunset 10
and 10
before 10
then 10
we 10
shall 10
return 10
if 10
we 10
shall 10
return 10
but 10
before 10
we 10
go 10
let 10
me 10
see 10
you 10
armed 10
against 10
personal 10
attack 10
i 10
have 10
myself 10
since 10
you 10
came 10
down 10
prepared 10
your 10
chamber 10
by 10
the 10
placing 10
of 10
things 10
of 10
which 10
we 10
know 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
may 10
not 10
enter 10
now 10
let 10
me 10
guard 10
yourself 10
on 10
your 10
forehead 10
i 10
touch 10
this 10
piece 10
of 10
sacred 10
wafer 10
in 10
the 10
name 10
of 10
the 10
father 10
the 10
son 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
fearful 10
scream 10
which 10
almost 10
froze 10
our 10
hearts 10
to 10
hear 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
placed 10
the 10
wafer 10
on 10
minas 10
forehead 10
it 10
had 10
seared 10
it 10
had 10
burned 10
into 10
the 10
flesh 10
as 10
though 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
a 10
piece 10
of 10
whitehot 10
metal 10
my 10
poor 10
darlings 10
brain 10
had 10
told 10
her 10
the 10
significance 10
of 10
the 10
fact 10
as 10
quickly 10
as 10
her 10
nerves 10
received 10
the 10
pain 10
of 10
it 10
and 10
the 10
two 10
so 10
overwhelmed 10
her 10
that 10
her 10
overwrought 10
nature 10
had 10
its 10
voice 10
in 10
that 10
dreadful 10
scream 10
but 10
the 10
words 10
to 10
her 10
thought 10
came 10
quickly 10
the 10
echo 10
of 10
the 10
scream 10
had 10
not 10
ceased 10
to 10
ring 10
on 10
the 10
air 10
when 10
there 10
came 10
the 10
reaction 10
and 10
she 10
sank 10
on 10
her 10
knees 10
on 10
the 10
floor 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
of 10
abasement 10
pulling 10
her 10
beautiful 10
hair 10
over 10
her 10
face 10
as 10
the 10
leper 10
of 10
old 10
his 10
mantle 10
she 10
wailed 10
out 10
unclean 10
unclean 10
even 10
the 10
almighty 10
shuns 10
my 10
polluted 10
flesh 10
i 10
must 10
bear 10
this 10
mark 10
of 10
shame 10
upon 10
my 10
forehead 10
until 10
the 10
judgement 10
day 10
they 10
all 10
paused 10
i 10
had 10
thrown 10
myself 10
beside 10
her 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
of 10
helpless 10
grief 10
and 10
putting 10
my 10
arms 10
around 10
held 10
her 10
tight 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
our 10
sorrowful 10
hearts 10
beat 10
together 10
whilst 10
the 10
friends 10
around 10
us 10
turned 10
away 10
their 10
eyes 10
that 10
ran 10
tears 10
silently 10
then 10
van 10
helsing 10
turned 10
and 10
said 10
gravely 10
so 10
gravely 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
help 10
feeling 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
inspired 10
and 10
was 10
stating 10
things 10
outside 10
himself 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
you 10
may 10
have 10
to 10
bear 10
that 10
mark 10
till 10
god 10
himself 10
see 10
fit 10
as 10
he 10
most 10
surely 10
shall 10
on 10
the 10
judgement 10
day 10
to 10
redress 10
all 10
wrongs 10
of 10
the 10
earth 10
and 10
of 10
his 10
children 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
placed 10
thereon 10
and 10
oh 10
madam 10
mina 10
my 10
dear 10
my 10
dear 10
may 10
we 10
who 10
love 10
you 10
be 10
there 10
to 10
see 10
when 10
that 10
red 10
scar 10
the 10
sign 10
of 10
gods 10
knowledge 10
of 10
what 10
has 10
been 10
shall 10
pass 10
away 10
and 10
leave 10
your 10
forehead 10
as 10
pure 10
as 10
the 10
heart 10
we 10
know 10
for 10
so 10
surely 10
as 10
we 10
live 10
that 10
scar 10
shall 10
pass 10
away 10
when 10
god 10
sees 10
right 10
to 10
lift 10
the 10
burden 10
that 10
is 10
hard 10
upon 10
us 10
till 10
then 10
we 10
bear 10
our 10
cross 10
as 10
his 10
son 10
did 10
in 10
obedience 10
to 10
his 10
will 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
chosen 10
instruments 10
of 10
his 10
good 10
pleasure 10
and 10
that 10
we 10
ascend 10
to 10
his 10
bidding 10
as 10
that 10
other 10
through 10
stripes 10
and 10
shame 10
through 10
tears 10
and 10
blood 10
through 10
doubts 10
and 10
fear 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
makes 10
the 10
difference 10
between 10
god 10
and 10
man 10
there 10
was 10
hope 10
in 10
his 10
words 10
and 10
comfort 10
and 10
they 10
made 10
for 10
resignation 10
mina 10
and 10
i 10
both 10
felt 10
so 10
and 10
simultaneously 10
we 10
each 10
took 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
mans 10
hands 10
and 10
bent 10
over 10
and 10
kissed 10
it 10
then 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
we 10
all 10
knelt 10
down 10
together 10
and 10
all 10
holding 10
hands 10
swore 10
to 10
be 10
true 10
to 10
each 10
other 10
we 10
men 10
pledged 10
ourselves 10
to 10
raise 10
the 10
veil 10
of 10
sorrow 10
from 10
the 10
head 10
of 10
her 10
whom 10
each 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
way 10
we 10
loved 10
and 10
we 10
prayed 10
for 10
help 10
and 10
guidance 10
in 10
the 10
terrible 10
task 10
which 10
lay 10
before 10
us 10
it 10
was 10
then 10
time 10
to 10
start 10
so 10
i 10
said 10
farewell 10
to 10
mina 10
a 10
parting 10
which 10
neither 10
of 10
us 10
shall 10
forget 10
to 10
our 10
dying 10
day 10
and 10
we 10
set 10
out 10
to 10
one 10
thing 10
i 10
have 10
made 10
up 10
my 10
mind 10
if 10
we 10
find 10
out 10
that 10
mina 10
must 10
be 10
a 10
vampire 10
in 10
the 10
end 10
then 10
she 10
shall 10
not 10
go 10
into 10
that 10
unknown 10
and 10
terrible 10
land 10
alone 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
thus 10
that 10
in 10
old 10
times 10
one 10
vampire 10
meant 10
many 10
just 10
as 10
their 10
hideous 10
bodies 10
could 10
only 10
rest 10
in 10
sacred 10
earth 10
so 10
the 10
holiest 10
love 10
was 10
the 10
recruiting 10
sergeant 10
for 10
their 10
ghastly 10
ranks 10
we 10
entered 10
carfax 10
without 10
trouble 10
and 10
found 10
all 10
things 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
on 10
the 10
first 10
occasion 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
to 10
believe 10
that 10
amongst 10
so 10
prosaic 10
surroundings 10
of 10
neglect 10
and 10
dust 10
and 10
decay 10
there 10
was 10
any 10
ground 10
for 10
such 10
fear 10
as 10
already 10
we 10
knew 10
had 10
not 10
our 10
minds 10
been 10
made 10
up 10
and 10
had 10
there 10
not 10
been 10
terrible 10
memories 10
to 10
spur 10
us 10
on 10
we 10
could 10
hardly 10
have 10
proceeded 10
with 10
our 10
task 10
we 10
found 10
no 10
papers 10
or 10
any 10
sign 10
of 10
use 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
the 10
great 10
boxes 10
looked 10
just 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
seen 10
them 10
last 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
to 10
us 10
solemnly 10
as 10
we 10
stood 10
before 10
him 10
and 10
now 10
my 10
friends 10
we 10
have 10
a 10
duty 10
here 10
to 10
do 10
we 10
must 10
sterilize 10
this 10
earth 10
so 10
sacred 10
of 10
holy 10
memories 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
brought 10
from 10
a 10
far 10
distant 10
land 10
for 10
such 10
fell 10
use 10
he 10
has 10
chosen 10
this 10
earth 10
because 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
holy 10
thus 10
we 10
defeat 10
him 10
with 10
his 10
own 10
weapon 10
for 10
we 10
make 10
it 10
more 10
holy 10
still 10
it 10
was 10
sanctified 10
to 10
such 10
use 10
of 10
man 10
now 10
we 10
sanctify 10
it 10
to 10
god 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
took 10
from 10
his 10
bag 10
a 10
screwdriver 10
and 10
a 10
wrench 10
and 10
very 10
soon 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
cases 10
was 10
thrown 10
open 10
the 10
earth 10
smelled 10
musty 10
and 10
close 10
but 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
somehow 10
seem 10
to 10
mind 10
for 10
our 10
attention 10
was 10
concentrated 10
on 10
the 10
professor 10
taking 10
from 10
his 10
box 10
a 10
piece 10
of 10
the 10
scared 10
wafer 10
he 10
laid 10
it 10
reverently 10
on 10
the 10
earth 10
and 10
then 10
shutting 10
down 10
the 10
lid 10
began 10
to 10
screw 10
it 10
home 10
we 10
aiding 10
him 10
as 10
he 10
worked 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
we 10
treated 10
in 10
the 10
same 10
way 10
each 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
boxes 10
and 10
left 10
them 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
found 10
them 10
to 10
all 10
appearance 10
but 10
in 10
each 10
was 10
a 10
portion 10
of 10
the 10
host 10
when 10
we 10
closed 10
the 10
door 10
behind 10
us 10
the 10
professor 10
said 10
solemnly 10
so 10
much 10
is 10
already 10
done 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
with 10
all 10
the 10
others 10
we 10
can 10
be 10
so 10
successful 10
then 10
the 10
sunset 10
of 10
this 10
evening 10
may 10
shine 10
of 10
madam 10
minas 10
forehead 10
all 10
white 10
as 10
ivory 10
and 10
with 10
no 10
stain 10
as 10
we 10
passed 10
across 10
the 10
lawn 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
station 10
to 10
catch 10
our 10
train 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
front 10
of 10
the 10
asylum 10
i 10
looked 10
eagerly 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
window 10
of 10
my 10
own 10
room 10
saw 10
mina 10
i 10
waved 10
my 10
hand 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
nodded 10
to 10
tell 10
that 10
our 10
work 10
there 10
was 10
successfully 10
accomplished 10
she 10
nodded 10
in 10
reply 10
to 10
show 10
that 10
she 10
understood 10
the 10
last 10
i 10
saw 10
she 10
was 10
waving 10
her 10
hand 10
in 10
farewell 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
a 10
heavy 10
heart 10
that 10
we 10
sought 10
the 10
station 10
and 10
just 10
caught 10
the 10
train 10
which 10
was 10
steaming 10
in 10
as 10
we 10
reached 10
the 10
platform 10

before 10
we 10

should 10
be 10
any 10
difficulty 10
for 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
it 10
wouldnt 10
seem 10
so 10
bad 10
for 10
us 10
to 10
break 10
into 10
an 10
empty 10
house 10
but 10
you 10

a 10
solicitor 10

the 10
incorporated 10

to 10
my 10
not 10
sharing 10
any 10
danger 10
even 10
of 10
odium 10
but 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
besides 10
it 10
will 10
attract 10
less 10
attention 10
if 10
there 10
are 10
not 10
too 10
many 10
of 10
us 10
my 10
title 10
will 10
make 10
it 10
all 10
right 10
with 10
the 10
locksmith 10
and 10
with 10
any 10
policeman 10
that 10
may 10
come 10
along 10
you 10
had 10
better 10
go 10
with 10
jack 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
stay 10
in 10
the 10
green 10
park 10
somewhere 10
in 10
sight 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
and 10
when 10
you 10
see 10
the 10
door 10
opened 10
and 10
the 10
smith 10
has 10
gone 10
away 10
do 10
you 10
all 10
come 10
across 10

shall 10
be 10
on 10
the 10
lookout 10
for 10
you 10
and 10
shall 10
let 10
you 10
in 10
the 10
advice 10
is 10
good 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
so 10
we 10
said 10
no 10
more 10
godalming 10
and 10
morris 10
hurried 10
off 10
in 10
a 10
cab 10
we 10
following 10
in 10
another 10
at 10
the 10
corner 10
of 10
arlington 10
street 10
our 10
contingent 10
got 10
out 10
and 10
strolled 10
into 10
the 10
green 10
park 10
my 10
heart 10
beat 10
as 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
house 10
on 10
which 10
so 10
much 10
of 10
our 10
hope 10
was 10
centered 10
looming 10
up 10
grim 10
and 10
silent 10
in 10
its 10
deserted 10
condition 10
amongst 10
its 10
more 10
lively 10
and 10
sprucelooking 10
neighbors 10
we 10
sat 10
down 10
on 10
a 10
bench 10
within 10
good 10
view 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
smoke 10
cigars 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
attract 10
as 10
little 10
attention 10
as 10
possible 10
the 10
minutes 10
seemed 10
to 10
pass 10
with 10
leaden 10
feet 10
as 10
we 10
waited 10
for 10
the 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
at 10
length 10
we 10
saw 10
a 10
fourwheeler 10
drive 10
up 10
out 10
of 10
it 10
in 10
leisurely 10
fashion 10
got 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
morris 10
and 10
down 10
from 10
the 10
box 10
descended 10
a 10
thickset 10
working 10
man 10
with 10
his 10
rushwoven 10
basket 10
of 10
tools 10
morris 10
paid 10
the 10
cabman 10
who 10
touched 10
his 10
hat 10
and 10
drove 10
away 10
together 10
the 10
two 10
ascended 10
the 10
steps 10
and 10
lord 10
godalming 10
pointed 10
out 10
what 10
he 10
wanted 10
done 10
the 10
workman 10
took 10
off 10
his 10
coat 10
leisurely 10
and 10
hung 10
it 10
on 10
one 10
of 10
the 10
spikes 10
of 10
the 10
rail 10
saying 10
something 10
to 10
a 10
policeman 10
who 10
just 10
then 10
sauntered 10
along 10
the 10
policeman 10
nodded 10
acquiescence 10
and 10
the 10
man 10
kneeling 10
down 10
placed 10
his 10
bag 10
beside 10
him 10
after 10
searching 10
through 10
it 10
he 10
took 10
out 10
a 10
selection 10
of 10
tools 10
which 10
he 10
proceeded 10
to 10
lay 10
beside 10
him 10
in 10
orderly 10
fashion 10
then 10
he 10
stood 10
up 10
looked 10
in 10
the 10
keyhole 10
blew 10
into 10
it 10
and 10
turning 10
to 10
his 10
employers 10
made 10
some 10
remark 10
lord 10
godalming 10
smiled 10
and 10
the 10
man 10
lifted 10
a 10
good 10
sized 10
bunch 10
of 10
keys 10
selecting 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
probe 10
the 10
lock 10
as 10
if 10
feeling 10
his 10
way 10
with 10
it 10
after 10
fumbling 10
about 10
for 10
a 10
bit 10
he 10
tried 10
a 10
second 10
and 10
then 10
a 10
third 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
the 10
door 10
opened 10
under 10
a 10
slight 10
push 10
from 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
and 10
the 10
two 10
others 10
entered 10
the 10
hall 10
we 10
sat 10
still 10
my 10
own 10
cigar 10
burnt 10
furiously 10
but 10
van 10
helsings 10
went 10
cold 10
altogether 10
we 10
waited 10
patiently 10
as 10
we 10
saw 10
the 10
workman 10
come 10
out 10
and 10
bring 10
his 10
bag 10
then 10
he 10
held 10
the 10
door 10
partly 10
open 10
steadying 10
it 10
with 10
his 10
knees 10
whilst 10
he 10
fitted 10
a 10
key 10
to 10
the 10
lock 10
this 10
he 10
finally 10
handed 10
to 10
lord 10
godalming 10
who 10
took 10
out 10
his 10
purse 10
and 10
gave 10
him 10
something 10
the 10
man 10
touched 10
his 10
hat 10
took 10
his 10
bag 10
put 10
on 10
his 10
coat 10
and 10
departed 10
not 10
a 10
soul 10
took 10
the 10
slightest 10
notice 10
of 10
the 10
whole 10
transaction 10
when 10
the 10
man 10
had 10
fairly 10
gone 10
we 10
three 10
crossed 10
the 10
street 10
and 10
knocked 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
it 10
was 10
immediately 10
opened 10
by 10
quincey 10
morris 10
beside 10
whom 10
stood 10
lord 10
godalming 10
lighting 10
a 10
cigar 10
the 10
place 10
smells 10
so 10
vilely 10
said 10
the 10
latter 10
as 10
we 10
came 10
in 10
it 10
did 10
indeed 10
smell 10
vilely 10
like 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
at 10
carfax 10
and 10
with 10
our 10
previous 10
experience 10
it 10
was 10
plain 10
to 10
us 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
been 10
using 10
the 10
place 10
pretty 10
freely 10
we 10
moved 10
to 10
explore 10
the 10
house 10
all 10
keeping 10
together 10
in 10
case 10
of 10
attack 10
for 10
we 10
knew 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
strong 10
and 10
wily 10
enemy 10
to 10
deal 10
with 10
and 10
as 10
yet 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
know 10
whether 10
the 10
count 10
might 10
not 10
be 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
in 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
which 10
lay 10
at 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
hall 10
we 10
found 10
eight 10
boxes 10
of 10
earth 10
eight 10
boxes 10
only 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
nine 10
which 10
we 10
sought 10
our 10
work 10
was 10
not 10
over 10
and 10
would 10
never 10
be 10
until 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
found 10
the 10
missing 10
box 10
first 10
we 10
opened 10
the 10
shutters 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
which 10
looked 10
out 10
across 10
a 10
narrow 10
stone 10
flagged 10
yard 10
at 10
the 10
blank 10
face 10
of 10
a 10
stable 10
pointed 10
to 10
look 10
like 10
the 10
front 10
of 10
a 10
miniature 10
house 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
windows 10
in 10
it 10
so 10
we 10
were 10
not 10
afraid 10
of 10
being 10
overlooked 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
lose 10
any 10
time 10
in 10
examining 10
the 10
chests 10
with 10
the 10
tools 10
which 10
we 10
had 10
brought 10
with 10
us 10
we 10
opened 10
them 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
and 10
treated 10
them 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
treated 10
those 10
others 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
to 10
us 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
was 10
not 10
at 10
present 10
in 10
the 10
house 10
and 10
we 10
proceeded 10
to 10
search 10
for 10
any 10
of 10
his 10
effects 10
after 10
a 10
cursory 10
glance 10
at 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
the 10
rooms 10
from 10
basement 10
to 10
attic 10
we 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
conclusion 10
that 10
the 10
dining 10
room 10
contained 10
any 10
effects 10
which 10
might 10
belong 10
to 10
the 10
count 10
and 10
so 10
we 10
proceeded 10
to 10
minutely 10
examine 10
them 10
they 10
lay 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
orderly 10
disorder 10
on 10
the 10
great 10

there 10
were 10
title 10

of 10
the 10
piccadilly 10

in 10
a 10
great 10
bundle 10

of 10

all 10
were 10
covered 10
up 10
in 10
thin 10
wrapping 10
paper 10
to 10
keep 10
them 10
from 10

a 10

and 10

and 10
a 10
jug 10
and 10
basin 10
the 10
latter 10
containing 10
dirty 10
water 10
which 10
was 10
reddened 10
as 10
if 10
with 10
blood 10
last 10
of 10
all 10
was 10
a 10
little 10
heap 10
of 10
keys 10
of 10
all 10
sorts 10
and 10
sizes 10
probably 10
those 10
belonging 10
to 10
the 10
other 10

when 10
we 10
had 10
examined 10

took 10
with 10
them 10
the 10

in 10
a 10
great 10

and 10
set 10
out 10
to 10

whilst 10

were 10

for 10

of 10

the 10

tried 10
to 10
keep 10
our 10
minds 10
active 10
by 10
using 10
them 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
his 10
beneficent 10
purpose 10
by 10
the 10
side 10
glances 10
which 10
he 10
threw 10
from 10

to 10
time 10
at 10
harker 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
is 10
overwhelmed 10
in 10
a 10
misery 10
that 10
is 10
appalling 10
to 10
see 10
last 10
night 10
he 10
was 10
a 10
frank 10
happylooking 10
man 10
with 10
strong 10
youthful 10
face 10
full 10
of 10
energy 10
and 10
with 10
dark 10
brown 10
hair 10
today 10
he 10
is 10
a 10
drawn 10
haggard 10
old 10
man 10
whose 10
white 10
hair 10
matches 10
well 10
with 10
the 10
hollow 10
burning 10
eyes 10
and 10
griefwritten 10
lines 10
of 10
his 10
face 10
his 10
energy 10
is 10
still 10
intact 10
in 10
fact 10
he 10
is 10
like 10
a 10
living 10
flame 10
this 10
may 10
yet 10
be 10
his 10
salvation 10
for 10
if 10
all 10
go 10
well 10
it 10
will 10
tide 10
him 10
over 10
the 10
despairing 10
period 10
he 10
will 10
then 10
in 10
a 10
kind 10
of 10
way 10
wake 10
again 10
to 10
the 10
realities 10
o 10
f 10
life 10
poor 10
fellow 10
i 10
thought 10
my 10
own 10
trouble 10
was 10
bad 10
enough 10
but 10
his 10
the 10
professor 10
knows 10
this 10
well 10
enough 10
and 10
is 10
doing 10
his 10
best 10
to 10
keep 10
his 10
mind 10
active 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
saying 10
was 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
of 10
absorbing 10
interest 10
so 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
can 10
remember 10
here 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
have 10
studied 10
over 10
and 10
over 10
again 10
since 10
they 10
came 10
into 10
my 10
hands 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
relating 10
to 10
this 10
monster 10
and 10
the 10
more 10
i 10
have 10
studied 10
the 10
greater 10
seems 10
the 10
necessity 10
to 10
utterly 10
stamp 10
him 10
out 10
all 10
through 10
there 10
are 10
signs 10
of 10
his 10
advance 10
not 10
only 10
of 10
his 10
power 10
but 10
of 10
his 10
knowledge 10
of 10
it 10
as 10
i 10
learned 10
from 10
the 10
researches 10
of 10
my 10
friend 10
arminius 10
of 10
budapesth 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
life 10
a 10
most 10
wonderful 10
man 10
soldier 10
statesman 10
and 10
alchemist 10
which 10
latter 10
was 10
the 10
highest 10
development 10
of 10
the 10
science 10
knowledge 10
of 10
his 10
time 10
he 10
had 10
a 10
mighty 10
brain 10
a 10
learning 10
beyond 10
compare 10
and 10
a 10
heart 10
that 10
knew 10
no 10
fear 10
and 10
no 10
remorse 10
he 10
dared 10
even 10
to 10
attend 10
the 10
scholomance 10
and 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
branch 10
of 10
knowledge 10
of 10
his 10
time 10
that 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
essay 10
well 10
in 10
him 10
the 10
brain 10
powers 10
survived 10
the 10
physical 10
death 10
though 10
it 10
would 10
seem 10
that 10
memory 10
was 10
not 10
all 10
complete 10
in 10
some 10
faculties 10
of 10
mind 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
and 10
is 10
only 10
a 10
child 10
but 10
he 10
is 10
growing 10
and 10
some 10
things 10
that 10
were 10
childish 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
are 10
now 10
of 10
mans 10
stature 10
he 10
is 10
experimenting 10
and 10
doing 10
it 10
well 10
and 10
if 10
it 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
crossed 10
his 10
path 10
he 10
would 10
be 10
yet 10
he 10
may 10
be 10
yet 10
if 10
we 10
fail 10
the 10
father 10
or 10
furtherer 10
of 10
a 10
new 10
order 10
of 10
beings 10
whose 10
road 10
must 10
lead 10
through 10
death 10
not 10
life 10
harker 10
groaned 10
and 10
said 10
and 10
this 10
is 10
all 10
arrayed 10
against 10
my 10
darling 10
but 10
how 10
is 10
he 10
experimenting 10
the 10
knowledge 10
may 10
help 10
us 10
to 10
defeat 10
him 10
he 10
has 10
all 10
along 10
since 10
his 10
coming 10
been 10
trying 10
his 10
power 10
slowly 10
but 10
surely 10
that 10
big 10
childbrain 10
of 10
his 10
is 10
working 10
well 10
for 10
us 10
it 10
is 10
as 10
yet 10
a 10
childbrain 10
for 10
had 10
he 10
dared 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
to 10
attempt 10
certain 10
things 10
he 10
would 10
long 10
ago 10
have 10
been 10
beyond 10
our 10
power 10
however 10
he 10
means 10
to 10
succeed 10
and 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
has 10
centuries 10
before 10
him 10
can 10
afford 10
to 10
wait 10
and 10
to 10
go 10
slow 10
festina 10
lente 10
may 10
well 10
be 10
his 10
motto 10
i 10
fail 10
to 10
understand 10
said 10
harker 10
wearily 10
oh 10
do 10
be 10
more 10
plain 10
to 10
me 10
perhaps 10
grief 10
and 10
trouble 10
are 10
dulling 10
my 10
brain 10
the 10
professor 10
laid 10
his 10
hand 10
tenderly 10
on 10
his 10
shoulder 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
ah 10
my 10
child 10
i 10
will 10
be 10
plain 10
do 10
you 10
not 10
see 10
how 10
of 10
late 10
this 10
monster 10
has 10
been 10
creeping 10
into 10
knowledge 10
experimentally 10
how 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
making 10
use 10
of 10
the 10
zoophagous 10
patient 10
to 10
effect 10
his 10
entry 10
into 10
friend 10
johns 10
home 10
for 10
your 10
vampire 10
though 10
in 10
all 10
afterwards 10
he 10
can 10
come 10
when 10
and 10
how 10
he 10
will 10
must 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
make 10
entry 10
only 10
when 10
asked 10
thereto 10
by 10
an 10
inmate 10
but 10
these 10
are 10
not 10
his 10
most 10
important 10
experiments 10
do 10
we 10
not 10
see 10
how 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
all 10
these 10
so 10
great 10
boxes 10
were 10
moved 10
by 10
others 10
he 10
knew 10
not 10
then 10
but 10
that 10
must 10
be 10
so 10
but 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
that 10
so 10
great 10
childbrain 10
of 10
his 10
was 10
growing 10
and 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
consider 10
whether 10
he 10
might 10
not 10
himself 10
move 10
the 10
box 10
so 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
help 10
and 10
then 10
when 10
he 10
found 10
that 10
this 10
be 10
all 10
right 10
he 10
try 10
to 10
move 10
them 10
all 10
alone 10
and 10
so 10
he 10
progress 10
and 10
he 10
scatter 10
these 10
graves 10
of 10
him 10
and 10
none 10
but 10
he 10
know 10
where 10
they 10
are 10
hidden 10
he 10
may 10
have 10
intend 10
to 10
bury 10
them 10
deep 10
in 10
the 10
ground 10
so 10
that 10
only 10
he 10
use 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
or 10
at 10
such 10
time 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
change 10
his 10
form 10
they 10
do 10
him 10
equal 10
well 10
and 10
none 10
may 10
know 10
these 10
are 10
his 10
hiding 10
place 10
but 10
my 10
child 10
do 10
not 10
despair 10
this 10
knowledge 10
came 10
to 10
him 10
just 10
too 10
late 10
already 10
all 10
of 10
his 10
lairs 10
but 10
one 10
be 10
sterilize 10
as 10
for 10
him 10
and 10
before 10
the 10
sunset 10
this 10
shall 10
be 10
so 10
then 10
he 10
have 10
no 10
place 10
where 10
he 10
can 10
move 10
and 10
hide 10
i 10
delayed 10
this 10
morning 10
that 10
so 10
we 10
might 10
be 10
sure 10
is 10
there 10
not 10
more 10
at 10
stake 10
for 10
us 10
than 10
for 10
him 10
then 10
why 10
not 10
be 10
more 10
careful 10
than 10
him 10
by 10
my 10
clock 10
it 10
is 10
one 10
hour 10
and 10
already 10
if 10
all 10
be 10
well 10
friend 10
arthur 10
and 10
quincey 10
are 10
on 10
their 10
way 10
to 10
us 10
today 10
is 10
our 10
day 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
go 10
sure 10
if 10
slow 10
and 10
lose 10
no 10
chance 10
see 10
there 10
are 10
five 10
of 10
us 10
when 10
those 10
absent 10
ones 10
return 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
speaking 10
we 10
were 10
startled 10

a 10
quiet 10
resolute 10
knock 10
at 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10

was 10
just 10
an 10
ordinary 10
knock 10
such 10
as 10
is 10
given 10
hourly 10
by 10
thousands 10
of 10
gentlemen 10
but 10
it 10
made 10
the 10
professors 10

and 10
mine 10
beat 10
loudly 10
we 10
looked 10
at 10

other 10
and 10
together 10
moved 10
out 10
into 10
the 10
hall 10

each 10
held 10
ready 10
to 10

back 10
the 10
latch 10
and 10
holding 10
the 10
door 10
half 10
open 10
stood 10
back 10
having 10
both 10
hands 10
ready 10
for 10
action 10
the 10
gladness 10
of 10
our 10
hearts 10
must 10
have 10
shown 10
upon 10
our 10
faces 10
when 10
on 10
the 10
step 10
close 10
to 10
the 10

they 10
came 10
quickly 10

behind 10
them 10
the 10
former 10

moved 10
along 10
the 10
hall 10

is 10
all 10
right 10
we 10
found 10
both 10
places 10
six 10
boxes 10
in 10
each 10
and 10
we 10
destroyed 10
them 10
all 10
destroyed 10
asked 10
the 10
professor 10
for 10
him 10
we 10
were 10
silent 10
for 10
a 10
minute 10
and 10
then 10
quincey 10
said 10

said 10
van 10
helsing 10
who 10
had 10
been 10
consulting 10
his 10
pocketbook 10
nota 10
bene 10
in 10
madams 10
telegram 10
he 10
went 10
south 10
from 10
carfax 10
that 10
means 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
cross 10
the 10
river 10
and 10
he 10
could 10
only 10
do 10
so 10
at 10
slack 10
of 10
tide 10
which 10
should 10
be 10
something 10
before 10
one 10
oclock 10
that 10
he 10
went 10
south 10
has 10
a 10
meaning 10
for 10
us 10
he 10
is 10
as 10
yet 10
only 10
suspicious 10
and 10
he 10
went 10
from 10
carfax 10
first 10
to 10
the 10
place 10
where 10
he 10
would 10
suspect 10
interference 10
least 10
you 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
at 10
bermondsey 10
only 10
a 10
short 10
time 10
before 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
here 10
already 10
shows 10
that 10
he 10
went 10
to 10
mile 10
end 10
next 10
this 10
took 10
him 10
some 10
time 10
for 10
he 10
would 10
then 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
carried 10
over 10
the 10
river 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
believe 10
me 10
my 10
friends 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
have 10
long 10
to 10
wait 10
now 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
ready 10
some 10
plan 10
of 10
attack 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
throw 10
away 10
no 10
chance 10
hush 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
time 10
now 10
have 10
all 10
your 10
arms 10
be 10
ready 10
he 10
held 10
up 10
a 10
warning 10
hand 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
for 10
we 10
all 10
could 10
hear 10
a 10
key 10
softly 10
inserted 10
in 10
the 10
lock 10
of 10
the 10
hall 10
door 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
admire 10
even 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
moment 10
the 10
way 10
in 10
which 10
a 10
dominant 10
spirit 10
asserted 10
itself 10
in 10
all 10
our 10
hunting 10
parties 10
and 10
adventures 10
in 10
different 10
parts 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
quincey 10
morris 10
had 10
always 10
been 10
the 10
one 10
to 10
arrange 10
the 10
plan 10
of 10
action 10
and 10
arthur 10
and 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
accustomed 10
to 10
obey 10
him 10
implicitly 10
now 10
the 10
old 10
habit 10
seemed 10
to 10
be 10
renewed 10
instinctively 10
with 10
a 10
swift 10
glance 10
around 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
at 10
once 10
laid 10
out 10
our 10
plan 10
of 10
attack 10
and 10
without 10
speaking 10
a 10
word 10
with 10
a 10
gesture 10
placed 10
us 10
each 10
in 10
position 10
van 10
helsing 10
harker 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
just 10
behind 10
the 10
door 10
so 10
that 10
when 10
it 10
was 10
opened 10
the 10
professor 10
could 10
guard 10
it 10
whilst 10
we 10
two 10
stepped 10
between 10
the 10
incomer 10
and 10
the 10
door 10
godalming 10
behind 10
and 10
quincey 10
in 10
front 10
stood 10
just 10
out 10
of 10
sight 10
ready 10
to 10
move 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
the 10
window 10
we 10
waited 10
in 10
a 10
suspense 10
that 10
made 10
the 10
seconds 10
pass 10
with 10
nightmare 10
slowness 10
the 10
slow 10
careful 10
steps 10
came 10
along 10
the 10
hall 10
the 10
count 10
was 10
evidently 10
prepared 10
for 10
some 10
surprise 10
at 10
least 10
he 10
feared 10
it 10
suddenly 10
with 10
a 10
single 10
bound 10
he 10
leaped 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
winning 10
a 10
way 10
past 10
us 10
before 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
could 10
raise 10
a 10
hand 10
to 10
stay 10
him 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
so 10
pantherlike 10
in 10
the 10
movement 10
something 10
so 10
unhuman 10
that 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
sober 10
us 10
all 10
from 10
the 10
shock 10
of 10
his 10
coming 10
the 10
first 10
to 10
act 10
was 10
harker 10
who 10
with 10
a 10
quick 10
movement 10
threw 10
himself 10
before 10
the 10
door 10
leading 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
in 10
the 10
front 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
as 10
the 10
count 10
saw 10
us 10
a 10
horrible 10
sort 10
of 10
snarl 10
passed 10
over 10
his 10
face 10
showing 10
the 10
eyeteeth 10
long 10
and 10
pointed 10
but 10
the 10
evil 10
smile 10
as 10
quickly 10
passed 10
into 10
a 10
cold 10
stare 10
of 10
lionlike 10
disdain 10
his 10
expression 10
again 10
changed 10
as 10
with 10
a 10
single 10
impulse 10
we 10
all 10
advanced 10
upon 10
him 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
pity 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
not 10
some 10
better 10
organized 10
plan 10
of 10
attack 10
for 10
even 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
i 10
wondered 10
what 10
we 10
were 10
to 10
do 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
myself 10
know 10
whether 10
our 10
lethal 10
weapons 10
would 10
avail 10
us 10
anything 10
harker 10
evidently 10
meant 10
to 10
try 10
the 10
matter 10
for 10
he 10
had 10
ready 10
his 10
great 10
kukri 10
knife 10
and 10
made 10
a 10
fierce 10
and 10
sudden 10
cut 10
at 10
him 10
the 10
blow 10
was 10
a 10
powerful 10
one 10
only 10
the 10
diabolical 10
quickness 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
leap 10
back 10
saved 10
him 10
a 10
second 10
less 10
and 10
the 10
trenchant 10
blade 10
had 10
shorn 10
through 10
his 10
coat 10
making 10
a 10
wide 10
gap 10
whence 10
a 10
bundle 10
of 10
bank 10
notes 10
and 10
a 10
stream 10
of 10
gold 10
fell 10
out 10
the 10
expression 10
of 10
the 10
counts 10
face 10
was 10
so 10
hellish 10
that 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
i 10
feared 10
for 10
harker 10
though 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
throw 10
the 10
terrible 10
knife 10
aloft 10
again 10
for 10
another 10
stroke 10
instinctively 10
i 10
moved 10
forward 10
with 10
a 10
protective 10
impulse 10
holding 10
the 10
crucifix 10
and 10
wafer 10
in 10
my 10
left 10
hand 10
i 10
felt 10
a 10
mighty 10
power 10
fly 10
along 10
my 10
arm 10
and 10
it 10
was 10
without 10
surprise 10
that 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
monster 10
cower 10
back 10
before 10
a 10
similar 10
movement 10
made 10
spontaneously 10
by 10
each 10
one 10
of 10
us 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
impossible 10
to 10
describe 10
the 10
expression 10
of 10
hate 10
and 10
baffled 10
malignity 10
of 10
anger 10
and 10
hellish 10
rage 10
which 10
came 10
over 10
the 10
counts 10
face 10
his 10
waxen 10
hue 10
became 10
greenishyellow 10
by 10
the 10
contrast 10
of 10
his 10
burning 10
eyes 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
scar 10
on 10
the 10
forehead 10
showed 10
on 10
the 10
pallid 10
skin 10
like 10
a 10
palpitating 10
wound 10
the 10
next 10
instant 10
with 10
a 10
sinuous 10
dive 10
he 10
swept 10
under 10
harkers 10
arm 10
ere 10
his 10
blow 10
could 10
fall 10
and 10
grasping 10
a 10
handful 10
of 10
the 10
money 10
from 10
the 10
floor 10
dashed 10
across 10
the 10
room 10
threw 10
himself 10
at 10
the 10
window 10
amid 10
the 10
crash 10
and 10
glitter 10
of 10
the 10
falling 10
glass 10
he 10
tumbled 10
into 10
the 10
flagged 10
area 10
below 10
through 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
the 10
shivering 10
glass 10
i 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
ting 10
of 10
the 10
gold 10
as 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
sovereigns 10
fell 10
on 10
the 10
flagging 10
we 10
ran 10
over 10
and 10
saw 10
him 10
spring 10
unhurt 10
from 10
the 10
ground 10
he 10
rushing 10
up 10
the 10
steps 10
crossed 10
the 10
flagged 10
yard 10
and 10
pushed 10
open 10
the 10
stable 10
door 10
there 10
he 10
turned 10
and 10
spoke 10
to 10
us 10
you 10
think 10
to 10
baffle 10
me 10
you 10
with 10
your 10
pale 10
faces 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
row 10
like 10
sheep 10
in 10
a 10
butchers 10
you 10
shall 10
be 10
sorry 10
yet 10
each 10
one 10
of 10
you 10
you 10
think 10
you 10
have 10
left 10
me 10
without 10
a 10
place 10
to 10
rest 10
but 10
i 10
have 10
more 10
my 10
revenge 10
is 10
just 10
begun 10
i 10
spread 10
it 10
over 10
centuries 10
and 10
time 10
is 10
on 10
my 10
side 10
your 10
girls 10
that 10
you 10
all 10
love 10
are 10
mine 10
already 10
and 10
through 10
them 10
you 10
and 10
others 10
shall 10
yet 10
be 10
mine 10
my 10
creatures 10
to 10
do 10
my 10
bidding 10
and 10
to 10
be 10
my 10
jackals 10
when 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
feed 10
bah 10
with 10
a 10
contemptuous 10
sneer 10
he 10
passed 10
quickly 10
through 10
the 10
door 10
and 10
we 10
heard 10
the 10
rusty 10
bolt 10
creak 10
as 10
he 10
fastened 10
it 10
behind 10
him 10
a 10
door 10
beyond 10
opened 10
and 10
shut 10
the 10
first 10
of 10
us 10
to 10
speak 10
was 10
the 10
professor 10
realizing 10
the 10
difficulty 10
of 10
following 10
him 10
through 10
the 10
stable 10
we 10
moved 10
toward 10
the 10
hall 10
we 10
have 10
learnt 10
something 10
much 10
notwithstanding 10
his 10
brave 10
words 10
he 10
fears 10
us 10
he 10
fears 10
time 10
he 10
fears 10
want 10
for 10
if 10
not 10
why 10
he 10
hurry 10
so 10
his 10
very 10
tone 10
betray 10
him 10
or 10
my 10
ears 10
deceive 10
why 10
take 10
that 10
money 10
you 10
follow 10
quick 10
you 10
are 10
hunters 10
of 10
the 10
wild 10
beast 10
and 10
understand 10
it 10
so 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
make 10
sure 10
that 10
nothing 10
here 10
may 10
be 10
of 10
use 10
to 10
him 10
if 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
returns 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
he 10
put 10
the 10
money 10
remaining 10
in 10
his 10
pocket 10
took 10
the 10
title 10
deeds 10
in 10
the 10
bundle 10
as 10
harker 10
had 10
left 10
them 10
and 10
swept 10
the 10
remaining 10
things 10
into 10
the 10
open 10
fireplace 10
where 10
he 10
set 10
fire 10
to 10
them 10
with 10
a 10
match 10
godalming 10
and 10
morris 10
had 10
rushed 10
out 10
into 10
the 10
yard 10
and 10
harker 10
had 10
lowered 10
himself 10
from 10
the 10
window 10
to 10
follow 10
the 10
count 10
he 10
had 10
however 10
bolted 10
the 10
stable 10
door 10
and 10
by 10
the 10
time 10
they 10
had 10
forced 10
it 10
open 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
sign 10
of 10
him 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
make 10
inquiry 10
at 10
the 10
back 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
but 10
the 10
mews 10
was 10
deserted 10
and 10
no 10
one 10
had 10
seen 10
him 10
depart 10
it 10
was 10
now 10
late 10
in 10
the 10
afternoon 10
and 10
sunset 10
was 10
not 10
far 10
off 10
we 10
had 10
to 10
recognize 10
that 10
our 10
game 10
was 10
up 10
with 10
heavy 10
hearts 10
we 10
agreed 10
with 10
the 10
professor 10
when 10
he 10
said 10
let 10
us 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
madam 10
mina 10
poor 10
poor 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
all 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
just 10
now 10
is 10
done 10
and 10
we 10
can 10
there 10
at 10
least 10
protect 10
her 10
but 10
we 10
need 10
not 10
despair 10
there 10
is 10
but 10
one 10
more 10
earth 10
box 10
and 10
we 10
must 10
try 10
to 10
find 10
it 10
when 10
that 10
is 10
done 10
all 10
may 10
yet 10
be 10
well 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
spoke 10
as 10
bravely 10
as 10
he 10
could 10
to 10
comfort 10
harker 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
was 10
quite 10
broken 10
down 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
he 10
gave 10
a 10
low 10
groan 10
which 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
suppress 10
he 10
was 10
thinking 10
of 10
his 10
wife 10
with 10
sad 10
hearts 10
we 10
came 10
back 10
to 10
my 10
house 10
where 10
we 10
found 10
mrs 10
harker 10
waiting 10
us 10
with 10
an 10
appearance 10
of 10
cheerfulness 10
which 10
did 10
honor 10
to 10
her 10
bravery 10
and 10
unselfishness 10
when 10
she 10
saw 10
our 10
faces 10
her 10
own 10
became 10
as 10
pale 10
as 10
death 10
for 10
a 10
second 10
or 10
two 10
her 10
eyes 10
were 10
closed 10
as 10
if 10
she 10
were 10
in 10
secret 10
prayer 10
and 10
then 10
she 10
said 10
cheerfully 10
i 10
can 10
never 10
thank 10
you 10
all 10
enough 10
oh 10
my 10
poor 10
darling 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
she 10
took 10
her 10
husbands 10
grey 10
head 10
in 10
her 10
hands 10
and 10
kissed 10
it 10
lay 10
your 10
poor 10
head 10
here 10
and 10
rest 10
it 10
all 10
will 10
yet 10
be 10
well 10
dear 10
god 10
will 10
protect 10
us 10
if 10
he 10
so 10
will 10
it 10
in 10
his 10
good 10
intent 10
the 10
poor 10
fellow 10
groaned 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
place 10
for 10
words 10
in 10
his 10
sublime 10
misery 10
we 10
had 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
perfunctory 10
supper 10
together 10
and 10
i 10
think 10
it 10
cheered 10
us 10
all 10
up 10
somewhat 10
it 10
was 10
perhaps 10
the 10
mere 10
animal 10
heat 10
of 10
food 10
to 10
hungry 10
people 10
for 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
had 10
eaten 10
anything 10
since 10
breakfast 10
or 10
the 10
sense 10
of 10
companionship 10
may 10
have 10
helped 10
us 10
but 10
anyhow 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
less 10
miserable 10
and 10
saw 10
the 10
morrow 10
as 10
not 10
altogether 10
without 10
hope 10
true 10
to 10
our 10
promise 10
we 10
told 10
mrs 10
harker 10
everything 10
which 10
had 10
passed 10
and 10
although 10
she 10
grew 10
snowy 10
white 10
at 10
times 10
when 10
danger 10
had 10
seemed 10
to 10
threaten 10
her 10
husband 10
and 10
red 10
at 10
others 10
when 10
his 10
devotion 10
to 10
her 10
was 10
manifested 10
she 10
listened 10
bravely 10
and 10
with 10
calmness 10
when 10
we 10
came 10
to 10
the 10
part 10
where 10
harker 10
had 10
rushed 10
at 10
the 10
count 10
so 10
recklessly 10
she 10
clung 10
to 10
her 10
husbands 10
arm 10
and 10
held 10
it 10
tight 10
as 10
though 10
her 10
clinging 10
could 10
protect 10
him 10
from 10
any 10
harm 10
that 10
might 10
come 10
she 10
said 10
nothing 10
however 10
till 10
the 10
narration 10
was 10
all 10
done 10
and 10
matters 10
had 10
been 10
brought 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
present 10
time 10
then 10
without 10
letting 10
go 10
her 10
husbands 10
hand 10
she 10
stood 10
up 10
amongst 10
us 10
and 10
spoke 10
oh 10
that 10
i 10
could 10
give 10
any 10
idea 10
of 10
the 10
scene 10
of 10
that 10
sweet 10
sweet 10
good 10
good 10
woman 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
radiant 10
beauty 10
of 10
her 10
youth 10
and 10
animation 10
with 10
the 10
red 10
scar 10
on 10
her 10
forehead 10
of 10
which 10
she 10
was 10
conscious 10
and 10
which 10
we 10
saw 10
with 10
grinding 10
of 10
our 10
teeth 10
remembering 10
whence 10
and 10
how 10
it 10
came 10
her 10
loving 10
kindness 10
against 10
our 10
grim 10
hate 10
her 10
tender 10
faith 10
against 10
all 10
our 10
fears 10
and 10
doubting 10
and 10
we 10
knowing 10
that 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
symbols 10
went 10
she 10
with 10
all 10
her 10
goodness 10
and 10
purity 10
and 10
faith 10
was 10
outcast 10
from 10
god 10
jonathan 10
she 10
said 10
and 10
the 10
word 10
sounded 10
like 10
music 10
on 10
her 10
lips 10
it 10
was 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
love 10
and 10
tenderness 10
jonathan 10
dear 10
and 10
you 10
all 10
my 10
true 10
true 10
friends 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
bear 10
something 10
in 10
mind 10
through 10
all 10
this 10
dreadful 10
time 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
you 10
must 10
fight 10
that 10
you 10
must 10
destroy 10
even 10
as 10
you 10
destroyed 10
the 10
false 10
lucy 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
true 10
lucy 10
might 10
live 10
hereafter 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
work 10
of 10
hate 10
that 10
poor 10
soul 10
who 10
has 10
wrought 10
all 10
this 10
misery 10
is 10
the 10
saddest 10
case 10
of 10
all 10
just 10
think 10
what 10
will 10
be 10
his 10
joy 10
when 10
he 10
too 10
is 10
destroyed 10
in 10
his 10
worser 10
part 10
that 10
his 10
better 10
part 10
may 10
have 10
spiritual 10
immortality 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
pitiful 10
to 10
him 10
too 10
though 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
hold 10
your 10
hands 10
from 10
his 10
destruction 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
her 10
husbands 10
face 10
darken 10
and 10
draw 10
together 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
passion 10
in 10
him 10
were 10
shriveling 10
his 10
being 10
to 10
its 10
core 10
instinctively 10
the 10
clasp 10
on 10
his 10
wifes 10
hand 10
grew 10
closer 10
till 10
his 10
knuckles 10
looked 10
white 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
flinch 10
from 10
the 10
pain 10
which 10
i 10
knew 10
she 10
must 10
have 10
suffered 10
but 10
looked 10
at 10
him 10
with 10
eyes 10
that 10
were 10
more 10
appealing 10
than 10
ever 10
as 10
she 10
stopped 10
speaking 10
he 10
leaped 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10
almost 10
tearing 10
his 10
hand 10
from 10
hers 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
may 10
god 10
give 10
him 10
into 10
my 10
hand 10
just 10
for 10
long 10
enough 10
to 10
destroy 10
that 10
earthly 10
life 10
of 10
him 10
which 10
we 10
are 10
aiming 10
at 10
if 10
beyond 10
it 10
i 10
could 10
send 10
his 10
soul 10
forever 10
and 10
ever 10
to 10
burning 10
hell 10
i 10
would 10
do 10
it 10
oh 10
hush 10
oh 10
hush 10
in 10
the 10
name 10
of 10
the 10
good 10
god 10
dont 10
say 10
such 10
things 10
jonathan 10
my 10
husband 10
or 10
you 10
will 10
crush 10
me 10
with 10
fear 10
and 10
horror 10
just 10
think 10
my 10
dear 10
i 10
have 10
been 10
thinking 10
all 10
this 10
long 10
long 10
day 10
of 10
it 10
that 10
perhaps 10
some 10
day 10
i 10
too 10
may 10
need 10
such 10
pity 10
and 10
that 10
some 10
other 10
like 10
you 10
and 10
with 10
equal 10
cause 10
for 10
anger 10
may 10
deny 10
it 10
to 10
me 10
oh 10
my 10
husband 10
my 10
husband 10
indeed 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
spared 10
you 10
such 10
a 10
thought 10
had 10
there 10
been 10
another 10
way 10
but 10
i 10
pray 10
that 10
god 10
may 10
not 10
have 10
treasured 10
your 10
wild 10
words 10
except 10
as 10
the 10
heartbroken 10
wail 10
of 10
a 10
very 10
loving 10
and 10
sorely 10
stricken 10
man 10
oh 10
god 10
let 10
these 10
poor 10
white 10
hairs 10
go 10
in 10
evidence 10
of 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
suffered 10
who 10
all 10
his 10
life 10
has 10
done 10
no 10
wrong 10
and 10
on 10
whom 10
so 10
many 10
sorrows 10
have 10
come 10
we 10
men 10
were 10
all 10
in 10
tears 10
now 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
resisting 10
them 10
and 10
we 10
wept 10
openly 10
she 10
wept 10
too 10
to 10
see 10
that 10
her 10
sweeter 10
counsels 10
had 10
prevailed 10
her 10
husband 10
flung 10
himself 10
on 10
his 10
knees 10
beside 10
her 10
and 10
putting 10
his 10
arms 10
round 10
her 10
hid 10
his 10
face 10
in 10
the 10
folds 10
of 10
her 10
dress 10
van 10
helsing 10
beckoned 10
to 10
us 10
and 10
we 10
stole 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
leaving 10
the 10
two 10
loving 10
hearts 10
alone 10
with 10
their 10
god 10
before 10
they 10
retired 10
the 10
professor 10
fixed 10
up 10
the 10
room 10
against 10
any 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
vampire 10
and 10
assured 10
mrs 10
harker 10
that 10
she 10
might 10
rest 10
in 10
peace 10
she 10
tried 10
to 10
school 10
herself 10
to 10
the 10
belief 10
and 10
manifestly 10
for 10
her 10
husbands 10
sake 10
tried 10
to 10
seem 10
content 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
brave 10
struggle 10
and 10
was 10
i 10
think 10
and 10
believe 10
not 10
without 10
its 10
reward 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
placed 10
at 10
hand 10
a 10
bell 10
which 10
either 10
of 10
them 10
was 10
to 10
sound 10
in 10
case 10
of 10
any 10
emergency 10
when 10
they 10
had 10
retired 10

i 10
arranged 10
that 10

thought 10
yesterday 10
would 10
never 10
end 10
there 10
was 10
over 10
me 10
a 10
yearning 10
for 10
sleep 10
in 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
blind 10
belief 10
that 10
to 10
wake 10
would 10
be 10
to 10
find 10
things 10
changed 10
and 10
that 10
any 10
change 10
must 10
now 10
be 10
for 10
the 10
better 10
before 10
we 10
parted 10
we 10
discussed 10
what 10
our 10
next 10
step 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
but 10
we 10
could 10
arrive 10
at 10
no 10
result 10
all 10
we 10
knew 10
was 10
that 10
one 10
earth 10
box 10
remained 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
alone 10
knew 10
where 10
it 10
was 10
if 10
he 10
chooses 10
to 10
lie 10
hidden 10
he 10
may 10
baffle 10
us 10
for 10
years 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
the 10
thought 10
is 10
too 10
horrible 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
even 10
now 10
this 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
if 10
ever 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
woman 10
who 10
was 10
all 10
perfection 10
that 10
one 10
is 10
my 10
poor 10
wronged 10
darling 10
i 10
loved 10
her 10
a 10
thousand 10
times 10
more 10
for 10
her 10
sweet 10
pity 10
of 10
last 10
night 10
a 10
pity 10
that 10
made 10
my 10
own 10
hate 10
of 10
the 10
monster 10
seem 10
despicable 10
surely 10
god 10
will 10
not 10
permit 10
the 10
world 10
to 10
be 10
the 10
poorer 10
by 10
the 10
loss 10
of 10
such 10
a 10
creature 10
this 10
is 10
hope 10
to 10
me 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
drifting 10
reefwards 10
now 10
and 10
faith 10
is 10
our 10
only 10

god 10
mina 10
is 10
sleeping 10
and 10
sleeping 10
without 10
dreams 10
i 10
fear 10
what 10
her 10
dreams 10
might 10
be 10
like 10
with 10
such 10
terrible 10
memories 10
to 10
ground 10
them 10
in 10
she 10
has 10
not 10
been 10
so 10
calm 10
within 10
my 10
seeing 10
since 10
the 10
sunset 10
then 10
for 10
a 10
while 10
there 10
came 10
over 10
her 10
face 10
a 10
repose 10
which 10
was 10
like 10
spring 10
after 10
the 10
blasts 10
of 10
march 10
i 10
thought 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
softness 10
of 10
the 10
red 10
sunset 10
on 10
her 10
face 10
but 10
somehow 10
now 10
i 10
think 10
it 10
has 10
a 10
deeper 10
meaning 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
sleepy 10
myself 10
though 10
i 10
am 10
weary 10
weary 10
to 10
death 10
however 10
i 10
must 10
try 10
to 10
sleep 10
for 10
there 10
is 10
tomorrow 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
rest 10
for 10
me 10
until 10
lateri 10
must 10
have 10
fallen 10
asleep 10
for 10
i 10
was 10
awakened 10
by 10
mina 10
who 10
was 10
sitting 10
up 10
in 10
bed 10
with 10
a 10
startled 10
look 10
on 10
her 10
face 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
easily 10
for 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
leave 10
the 10
room 10
in 10
darkness 10
she 10
had 10
placed 10
a 10
warning 10
hand 10
over 10
my 10
mouth 10
and 10
now 10
she 10
whispered 10
in 10
my 10
ear 10
hush 10
there 10
is 10
someone 10
in 10
the 10
corridor 10
i 10
got 10
up 10
softly 10
and 10
crossing 10
the 10
room 10
gently 10
opened 10
the 10
door 10
just 10
outside 10
stretched 10
on 10
a 10
mattress 10
lay 10
mr 10
morris 10
wide 10
awake 10
he 10
raised 10
a 10
warning 10
hand 10
for 10
silence 10
as 10
he 10
whispered 10
to 10
me 10
hush 10

back 10
to 10

dont 10
mean 10
to 10
take 10
any 10
chances 10
his 10
look 10
and 10
gesture 10
forbade 10
discussion 10
so 10
i 10
came 10
back 10
and 10
told 10
mina 10
she 10
sighed 10
and 10
positively 10
a 10
shadow 10
of 10
a 10
smile 10
stole 10
over 10
her 10
poor 10
pale 10
face 10
as 10
she 10
put 10
her 10
arms 10
round 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
softly 10
oh 10
thank 10
god 10
for 10
good 10
brave 10
men 10
with 10
a 10
sigh 10
she 10
sank 10
back 10
again 10
to 10
sleep 10
i 10
write 10
this 10
now 10
as 10
i 10

during 10
the 10

time 10
we 10

a 10
good 10
sleep 10
for 10
the 10
grey 10
of 10
the 10
coming 10
dawn 10
was 10
making 10
the 10
windows 10
into 10
sharp 10
oblongs 10
and 10
the 10
gas 10
flame 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
speck 10
rather 10
than 10
a 10
disc 10
of 10
light 10
she 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
hurriedly 10

the 10
night 10
and 10
matured 10
without 10
my 10

it 10
he 10
must 10
hypnotize 10
me 10
before 10

and 10

sprang 10
to 10
his 10
feet 10

said 10
and 10
hurried 10
into 10
the 10
professors 10
room 10
two 10
or 10
three 10
minutes 10
later 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
in 10
his 10
dressing 10

with 10
dr 10
seward 10
at 10
the 10
door 10
asking 10
questions 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
saw 10
mina 10
a 10
smile 10
a 10
positive 10
smile 10
ousted 10
the 10
anxiety 10
of 10
his 10
face 10
he 10
rubbed 10
his 10
hands 10
as 10
he 10
said 10
oh 10

back 10
to 10
us 10
today 10
then 10
turning 10
to 10
her 10
he 10
said 10
cheerfully 10
and 10
what 10
am 10
i 10
to 10
do 10
for 10
you 10
for 10
at 10
this 10
hour 10

for 10
nothing 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
me 10
she 10
said 10
do 10
it 10
before 10
the 10
dawn 10
for 10
i 10
feel 10
that 10
then 10
i 10
can 10
speak 10
and 10
speak 10
freely 10
be 10
quick 10
for 10
the 10
time 10
is 10
short 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
he 10
motioned 10
her 10
to 10
sit 10
up 10
in 10
bed 10
looking 10
fixedly 10
at 10
her 10
he 10
commenced 10
to 10
make 10
passes 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
her 10
from 10
over 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
her 10
head 10
downward 10
with 10
each 10
hand 10
in 10
turn 10
mina 10
gazed 10
at 10
him 10
fixedly 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
minutes 10
during 10
which 10
my 10
own 10
heart 10
beat 10
like 10
a 10
trip 10
hammer 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
some 10
crisis 10
was 10
at 10
hand 10
gradually 10
her 10
eyes 10
closed 10
and 10
she 10
sat 10
stock 10
still 10
only 10
by 10
the 10
gentle 10
heaving 10
of 10
her 10
bosom 10
could 10
one 10
know 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
alive 10
the 10
professor 10
made 10
a 10
few 10
more 10
passes 10
and 10
then 10
stopped 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
his 10
forehead 10
was 10
covered 10
with 10
great 10
beads 10
of 10
perspiration 10
mina 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
but 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
the 10
same 10
woman 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
faraway 10
look 10
in 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
her 10
voice 10
had 10
a 10
sad 10
dreaminess 10
which 10
was 10
new 10
to 10
me 10
raising 10
his 10
hand 10
to 10
impose 10
silence 10
the 10
professor 10
motioned 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
bring 10
the 10
others 10
in 10
they 10
came 10
on 10
tiptoe 10
closing 10
the 10
door 10
behind 10
them 10
and 10
stood 10
at 10
the 10
foot 10
of 10
the 10
bed 10
looking 10
on 10
mina 10
appeared 10
not 10
to 10
see 10
them 10
the 10
stillness 10
was 10
broken 10
by 10
van 10
helsings 10
voice 10
speaking 10
in 10
a 10
low 10
level 10
tone 10
which 10
would 10
not 10
break 10
the 10
current 10
of 10
her 10
thoughts 10
where 10
are 10
you 10
the 10
answer 10
came 10
in 10
a 10
neutral 10
way 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
sleep 10
has 10
no 10
place 10
it 10
can 10
call 10
its 10
own 10
for 10
several 10
minutes 10
there 10
was 10
silence 10
mina 10
sat 10
rigid 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
stood 10
staring 10
at 10
her 10
fixedly 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
us 10
hardly 10
dared 10
to 10
breathe 10
the 10
room 10
was 10
growing 10
lighter 10
without 10
taking 10
his 10
eyes 10
from 10
minas 10
face 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
motioned 10
me 10
to 10
pull 10
up 10
the 10
blind 10
i 10
did 10
so 10
and 10
the 10
day 10
seemed 10
just 10
upon 10
us 10
a 10
red 10
streak 10
shot 10
up 10
and 10
a 10
rosy 10
light 10
seemed 10
to 10
diffuse 10
itself 10
through 10
the 10
room 10
on 10
the 10
instant 10
the 10
professor 10
spoke 10
again 10
where 10
are 10
you 10
now 10
the 10
answer 10
came 10
dreamily 10
but 10
with 10
intention 10
it 10
were 10
as 10
though 10
she 10
were 10
interpreting 10
something 10
i 10
have 10
heard 10
her 10
use 10
the 10
same 10
tone 10
when 10
reading 10
her 10
shorthand 10
notes 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
strange 10
to 10
me 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
see 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
nothing 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
dark 10
what 10
do 10
you 10
hear 10
i 10
could 10
detect 10
the 10
strain 10
in 10
the 10
professors 10
patient 10
voice 10
the 10
lapping 10
of 10
water 10
it 10
is 10
gurgling 10
by 10
and 10
little 10
waves 10
leap 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
them 10
on 10
the 10
outside 10
then 10
you 10
are 10
on 10
a 10
ship 10
we 10
all 10
looked 10
at 10
each 10
other 10
trying 10
to 10
glean 10
something 10
each 10
from 10
the 10
other 10
we 10
were 10
afraid 10
to 10
think 10
the 10
answer 10
came 10
quick 10
oh 10
yes 10
what 10
else 10
do 10
you 10
hear 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
men 10
stamping 10
overhead 10
as 10
they 10
run 10
about 10
there 10
is 10
the 10
creaking 10
of 10
a 10
chain 10
and 10
the 10
loud 10
tinkle 10
as 10
the 10
check 10
of 10
the 10
capstan 10
falls 10
into 10
the 10
ratchet 10
what 10
are 10
you 10
doing 10
i 10
am 10
still 10
oh 10
so 10
still 10
it 10
is 10
like 10
death 10
the 10
voice 10
faded 10
away 10
into 10
a 10
deep 10
breath 10
as 10
of 10
one 10
sleeping 10
and 10
the 10
open 10
eyes 10
closed 10
again 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
the 10
sun 10
had 10
risen 10
and 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
in 10
the 10
full 10
light 10
of 10
day 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
placed 10
his 10
hands 10
on 10
minas 10
shoulders 10
and 10
laid 10
her 10
head 10
down 10
softly 10
on 10
her 10
pillow 10
she 10
lay 10
like 10
a 10
sleeping 10
child 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
moments 10
and 10
then 10
with 10
a 10
long 10
sigh 10
awoke 10
and 10
stared 10
in 10
wonder 10
to 10
see 10
us 10
all 10
around 10
her 10
have 10
i 10
been 10
talking 10
in 10
my 10
sleep 10
was 10
all 10
she 10
said 10
she 10
seemed 10
however 10
to 10
know 10
the 10
situation 10
without 10
telling 10
though 10
she 10
was 10
eager 10
to 10
know 10
what 10
she 10
had 10
told 10
the 10
professor 10
repeated 10
the 10
conversation 10
and 10
she 10
said 10
then 10
there 10
is 10
not 10
a 10
moment 10
to 10
lose 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
yet 10
too 10
late 10
mr 10
morris 10
and 10
lord 10
godalming 10
started 10
for 10
the 10
door 10
but 10
the 10
professors 10
calm 10
voice 10
called 10
them 10
back 10
stay 10
my 10
friends 10
that 10
ship 10
wherever 10
it 10
was 10
was 10
weighing 10
anchor 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
in 10
your 10
so 10
great 10
port 10
of 10
london 10
which 10
of 10
them 10
is 10
it 10
that 10
you 10
seek 10
god 10
be 10
thanked 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
once 10
again 10
a 10
clue 10
though 10
whither 10
it 10
may 10
lead 10
us 10
we 10
know 10
not 10
we 10
have 10
been 10
blind 10
somewhat 10
blind 10
after 10
the 10
manner 10
of 10
men 10
since 10
we 10
can 10
look 10
back 10
we 10
see 10
what 10
we 10
might 10
have 10
seen 10
looking 10
forward 10
if 10
we 10
had 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
see 10
what 10
we 10
might 10
have 10
seen 10
alas 10
but 10
that 10
sentence 10
is 10
a 10
puddle 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
we 10
can 10
know 10
now 10
what 10

the 10
counts 10
mind 10
when 10

fierce 10
knife 10

him 10
in 10

and 10
which 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
if 10

would 10
unless 10
the 10
ship 10
were 10
to 10
touch 10
the 10

appealingly 10
as 10

grew 10
paler 10
as 10

the 10
poor 10

brightened 10
up 10
considerably 10
already 10
the 10

that 10
the 10

out 10

the 10

horrible 10

is 10
not 10

with 10

it 10
seems 10
almost 10
impossible 10
to 10
believe 10

even 10
my 10
own 10
terrible 10
experiences 10
in 10

seem 10
like 10
a 10
long 10
forgotten 10
dream 10
here 10
in 10
the 10
crisp 10
autumn 10
air 10
in 10
the 10

alas 10
how 10

been 10

again 10
somehow 10
although 10
the 10

seem 10
greater 10
each 10
time 10
the 10
pain 10
and 10
the 10
fear 10
seem 10
less 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
of 10
a 10
guiding 10
purpose 10
manifest 10
throughout 10
which 10
is 10
comforting 10

he 10
wanted 10
to 10
get 10
back 10
to 10
transylvania 10
i 10
felt 10
sure 10
that 10
he 10
must 10
go 10
by 10
the 10
danube 10
mouth 10
or 10
by 10
somewhere 10
in 10
the 10
black 10
sea 10
since 10
by 10
that 10
way 10
he 10
come 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
dreary 10
blank 10

before 10

omme 10

your 10
list 10
of 10
the 10

he 10
had 10
better 10

for 10
that 10
his 10
ship 10
will 10
leave 10
the 10
place 10
of 10
blood 10
before 10
the 10
turn 10
of 10
the 10
tide 10
with 10
blood 10
then 10
the 10
thin 10
man 10
smile 10
and 10
say 10
that 10
of 10
course 10
he 10
must 10
go 10

fit 10
but 10
he 10
will 10
be 10
surprise 10
if 10
he 10
go 10
quite 10
so 10
soon 10
the 10
captain 10
swear 10
again 10
polyglot 10
and 10
the 10
thin 10
man 10
make 10
him 10
bow 10
and 10
thank 10
him 10
and 10
say 10
that 10
he 10
will 10
so 10
far 10
intrude 10
on 10
his 10
kindness 10
as 10
to 10
come 10
aboard 10
before 10
the 10
sailing 10
final 10
the 10
captain 10
more 10
red 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
in 10
more 10
tongues 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
he 10
doesnt 10
want 10
no 10
frenchmen 10
with 10
bloom 10
upon 10
them 10
and 10
also 10
with 10
blood 10
in 10
his 10
ship 10
with 10
blood 10
on 10
her 10
also 10
and 10
so 10
after 10
asking 10
where 10
he 10
might 10
purchase 10
ship 10
forms 10
he 10
departed 10
no 10
one 10
knew 10
where 10
he 10
went 10
or 10
bloomin 10
well 10
cared 10
as 10
they 10
said 10
for 10
they 10
had 10
something 10
else 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
well 10
with 10
blood 10
again 10
for 10
it 10
soon 10
became 10
apparent 10
to 10
all 10
that 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
would 10
not 10
sail 10
as 10
was 10
expected 10
a 10
thin 10
mist 10
began 10
to 10
creep 10
up 10
from 10
the 10
river 10
and 10
it 10
grew 10
and 10
grew 10
till 10
soon 10
a 10
dense 10
fog 10
enveloped 10
the 10
ship 10
and 10
all 10
around 10
her 10
the 10
captain 10
swore 10
polyglot 10
very 10
polyglot 10
polyglot 10
with 10
bloom 10
and 10
blood 10
but 10
he 10
could 10
do 10
nothing 10
the 10
water 10
rose 10
and 10
rose 10
and 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
fear 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
lose 10
the 10
tide 10
altogether 10
he 10
was 10
in 10
no 10
friendly 10
mood 10
when 10
just 10
at 10
full 10
tide 10
the 10
thin 10
man 10
came 10
up 10
the 10
gangplank 10
again 10
and 10
asked 10
to 10
see 10
where 10
his 10
box 10
had 10
been 10
stowed 10
then 10
the 10
captain 10
replied 10
that 10
he 10
wished 10
that 10
he 10
and 10
his 10
box 10
old 10
and 10
with 10
much 10
bloom 10
and 10
blood 10
were 10
in 10
hell 10
but 10
the 10
thin 10
man 10
did 10
not 10
be 10
offend 10
and 10
went 10
down 10
with 10
the 10
mate 10
and 10
saw 10
where 10
it 10
was 10
place 10
and 10
came 10
up 10
and 10
stood 10
awhile 10
on 10
deck 10
in 10
fog 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
come 10
off 10
by 10
himself 10
for 10
none 10
notice 10
him 10
indeed 10
they 10
thought 10
not 10
of 10
him 10
for 10
soon 10
the 10
fog 10
begin 10
to 10
melt 10
away 10
and 10
all 10
was 10
clear 10
again 10
my 10
friends 10
of 10
the 10
thirst 10
and 10
the 10
language 10
that 10
was 10
of 10
bloom 10
and 10
blood 10
laughed 10
as 10
they 10
told 10
how 10
the 10
captains 10
swears 10
exceeded 10
even 10
his 10
usual 10
polyglot 10
and 10
was 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
full 10
of 10
picturesque 10
when 10
on 10
questioning 10
other 10
mariners 10
who 10
were 10
on 10
movement 10
up 10
and 10
down 10
the 10
river 10
that 10
hour 10
he 10
found 10
that 10
few 10
of 10
them 10
had 10
seen 10
any 10
of 10
fog 10
at 10
all 10
except 10
where 10
it 10
lay 10
round 10
the 10
wharf 10
however 10
the 10
ship 10
went 10
out 10
on 10
the 10
ebb 10
tide 10
and 10
was 10
doubtless 10
by 10
morning 10
far 10
down 10
the 10
river 10
mouth 10
she 10
was 10
then 10
when 10
they 10
told 10
us 10
well 10
out 10
to 10
sea 10
and 10
so 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
it 10
is 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
rest 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
for 10
our 10
enemy 10
is 10
on 10
the 10
sea 10
with 10
the 10
fog 10
at 10
his 10
command 10
on 10
his 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
danube 10
mouth 10
to 10
sail 10
a 10
ship 10
takes 10
time 10
go 10
she 10
never 10
so 10
quick 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
start 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
land 10
more 10
quick 10
and 10
we 10
meet 10
him 10
there 10
our 10
best 10
hope 10
is 10
to 10
come 10
on 10
him 10
when 10
in 10
the 10
box 10
between 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
for 10
then 10
he 10
can 10
make 10
no 10
struggle 10
and 10
we 10
may 10
deal 10
with 10
him 10
as 10
we 10
should 10
there 10
are 10
days 10
for 10
us 10
in 10
which 10
we 10
can 10
make 10
ready 10
our 10
plan 10
we 10
know 10
all 10
about 10
where 10
he 10
go 10
for 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
the 10
owner 10
of 10
the 10
ship 10
who 10
have 10
shown 10
us 10
invoices 10
and 10
all 10
papers 10
that 10
can 10
be 10
the 10
box 10
we 10
seek 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
landed 10
in 10
varna 10
and 10
to 10
be 10
given 10
to 10
an 10
agent 10
one 10
ristics 10
who 10
will 10
there 10
present 10
his 10
credentials 10
and 10
so 10
our 10
merchant 10
friend 10
will 10
have 10
done 10
his 10
part 10
when 10
he 10
ask 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
any 10
wrong 10
for 10
that 10
so 10
he 10
can 10
telegraph 10
and 10
have 10
inquiry 10
made 10
at 10
varna 10
we 10
say 10
no 10
for 10
what 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
is 10
not 10
for 10
police 10
or 10
of 10
the 10
customs 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
done 10
by 10
us 10
alone 10
and 10
in 10
our 10
own 10
way 10
when 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
had 10
done 10
speaking 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
if 10
he 10
were 10
certain 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
remained 10
on 10
board 10
the 10
ship 10
he 10
replied 10
we 10
have 10
the 10
best 10
proof 10
of 10
that 10
your 10
own 10
evidence 10
when 10
in 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
trance 10
this 10
morning 10
i 10
asked 10
him 10
again 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
really 10
necessary 10
that 10
they 10
should 10
pursue 10
the 10
count 10
for 10
oh 10
i 10
dread 10
jonathan 10
leaving 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
he 10
would 10
surely 10
go 10
if 10
the 10
others 10
went 10
he 10
answered 10
in 10
growing 10
passion 10
at 10
first 10
quietly 10
as 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
however 10
he 10
grew 10
more 10
angry 10
and 10
more 10
forceful 10
till 10
in 10
the 10
end 10
we 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
see 10
wherein 10
was 10
at 10
least 10
some 10
of 10
that 10
personal 10
dominance 10
which 10
made 10
him 10
so 10
long 10
a 10
master 10
amongst 10
men 10
yes 10
it 10
is 10
necessary 10
necessary 10
necessary 10
for 10
your 10
sake 10
in 10
the 10
first 10
and 10
then 10
for 10
the 10
sake 10
of 10
humanity 10
this 10
monster 10
has 10
done 10
much 10
harm 10
already 10
in 10
the 10
narrow 10
scope 10
where 10
he 10
find 10
himself 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
short 10
time 10
when 10
as 10
yet 10
he 10
was 10
only 10
as 10
a 10
body 10
groping 10
his 10
so 10
small 10
measure 10
in 10
darkness 10
and 10
not 10
knowing 10
all 10
this 10
have 10
i 10
told 10
these 10
others 10
you 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
will 10
learn 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
phonograph 10
of 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
or 10
in 10
that 10
of 10
your 10
husband 10
i 10
have 10
told 10
them 10
how 10
the 10
measure 10
of 10
leaving 10
his 10
own 10
barren 10
land 10
barren 10
of 10
peoples 10
and 10
coming 10
to 10
a 10
new 10
land 10
where 10
life 10
of 10
man 10
teems 10
till 10
they 10
are 10
like 10
the 10
multitude 10
of 10
standing 10
corn 10
was 10
the 10
work 10
of 10
centuries 10
were 10
another 10
of 10
the 10
undead 10
like 10
him 10
to 10
try 10
to 10
do 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
done 10
perhaps 10
not 10
all 10
the 10
centuries 10
of 10
the 10
world 10
that 10
have 10
been 10
or 10
that 10
will 10
be 10
could 10
aid 10
him 10
with 10
this 10
one 10
all 10
the 10
forces 10
of 10
nature 10
that 10
are 10
occult 10
and 10
deep 10
and 10
strong 10
must 10
have 10
worked 10
together 10
in 10
some 10
wonderous 10
way 10
the 10
very 10
place 10
where 10
he 10
have 10
been 10
alive 10
undead 10
for 10
all 10
these 10
centuries 10
is 10
full 10
of 10
strangeness 10
of 10
the 10
geologic 10
and 10
chemical 10
world 10
there 10
are 10
deep 10
caverns 10
and 10
fissures 10
that 10
reach 10
none 10
know 10
whither 10
there 10
have 10
been 10
volcanoes 10
some 10
of 10
whose 10
openings 10
still 10
send 10
out 10
waters 10
of 10
strange 10
properties 10
and 10
gases 10
that 10
kill 10
or 10
make 10
to 10
vivify 10
doubtless 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
magnetic 10
or 10
electric 10
in 10
some 10
of 10
these 10
combinations 10
of 10
occult 10
forces 10
which 10
work 10
for 10
physical 10
life 10
in 10
strange 10
way 10
and 10
in 10
himself 10
were 10
from 10
the 10
first 10
some 10
great 10
qualities 10
in 10
a 10
hard 10
and 10
warlike 10
time 10
he 10
was 10
celebrate 10
that 10
he 10
have 10
more 10
iron 10
nerve 10
more 10
subtle 10
brain 10
more 10
braver 10
heart 10
than 10
any 10
man 10
in 10
him 10
some 10
vital 10
principle 10
have 10
in 10
strange 10
way 10
found 10
their 10
utmost 10
and 10
as 10
his 10
body 10
keep 10
strong 10
and 10
grow 10
and 10
thrive 10
so 10
his 10
brain 10
grow 10
too 10
all 10
this 10
without 10
that 10
diabolic 10
aid 10
which 10
is 10
surely 10
to 10
him 10
for 10
it 10
have 10
to 10
yield 10
to 10
the 10
powers 10
that 10
come 10
from 10
and 10
are 10
symbolic 10
of 10
good 10
and 10
now 10
this 10
is 10
what 10
he 10
is 10
to 10
us 10
he 10
have 10
infect 10
you 10
oh 10
forgive 10
me 10
my 10
dear 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
say 10
such 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
for 10
good 10
of 10
you 10
that 10
i 10
speak 10
he 10
infect 10
you 10
in 10
such 10
wise 10
that 10
even 10
if 10
he 10
do 10
no 10
more 10
you 10
have 10
only 10
to 10
live 10
to 10
live 10
in 10
your 10
own 10
old 10
sweet 10
way 10
and 10
so 10
in 10
time 10
death 10
which 10
is 10
of 10
mans 10
common 10
lot 10
and 10
with 10
gods 10
sanction 10
shall 10
make 10
you 10
like 10
to 10
him 10
this 10
must 10
not 10
be 10
we 10
have 10
sworn 10
together 10
that 10
it 10
must 10
not 10
thus 10
are 10
we 10
ministers 10
of 10
gods 10
own 10
wish 10
that 10
the 10
world 10
and 10
men 10
for 10
whom 10
his 10
son 10
die 10
will 10
not 10
be 10
given 10
over 10
to 10
monsters 10
whose 10
very 10
existence 10
would 10
defame 10
him 10
he 10
have 10
allowed 10
us 10
to 10
redeem 10
one 10
soul 10
already 10
and 10
we 10
go 10
out 10
as 10
the 10
old 10
knights 10
of 10
the 10
cross 10
to 10
redeem 10
more 10
like 10
them 10
we 10
shall 10
travel 10
towards 10
the 10
sunrise 10
and 10
like 10
them 10
if 10
we 10
fall 10
we 10
fall 10
in 10
good 10
cause 10
he 10
paused 10
and 10
i 10
said 10
but 10
will 10
not 10
the 10
count 10
take 10
his 10
rebuff 10
wisely 10
since 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
driven 10
from 10
england 10
will 10
he 10
not 10
avoid 10
it 10
as 10
a 10
tiger 10
does 10
the 10
village 10
from 10
which 10
he 10
has 10
been 10
hunted 10
aha 10
he 10
said 10
your 10
simile 10
of 10
the 10
tiger 10
good 10
for 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
adopt 10
him 10
your 10
maneater 10
as 10
they 10
of 10
india 10
call 10
the 10
tiger 10
who 10
has 10
once 10
tasted 10
blood 10
of 10
the 10
human 10
care 10
no 10
more 10
for 10
the 10
other 10
prey 10
but 10
prowl 10
unceasing 10
till 10
he 10
get 10
him 10
this 10
that 10
we 10
hunt 10
from 10
our 10
village 10
is 10
a 10
tiger 10
too 10
a 10
maneater 10
and 10
he 10
never 10
cease 10
to 10
prowl 10
nay 10
in 10
himself 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
one 10
to 10
retire 10
and 10
stay 10
afar 10
in 10
his 10
life 10
his 10
living 10
life 10
he 10
go 10
over 10
the 10
turkey 10
frontier 10
and 10
attack 10
his 10
enemy 10
on 10
his 10
own 10
ground 10
he 10
be 10
beaten 10
back 10
but 10
did 10
he 10
stay 10
no 10
he 10
come 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
look 10
at 10
his 10
persistence 10
and 10
endurance 10
with 10
the 10
childbrain 10
that 10
was 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
have 10
long 10
since 10
conceive 10
the 10
idea 10
of 10
coming 10
to 10
a 10
great 10
city 10
what 10
does 10
he 10
do 10
he 10
find 10
out 10
the 10
place 10
of 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
most 10
of 10
promise 10
for 10
him 10
then 10
he 10
deliberately 10
set 10
himself 10
down 10
to 10
prepare 10
for 10
the 10
task 10
he 10
find 10
in 10
patience 10
just 10
how 10
is 10
his 10
strength 10
and 10
what 10
are 10
his 10
powers 10
he 10
study 10
new 10
tongues 10
he 10
learn 10
new 10
social 10
life 10
new 10
environment 10
of 10
old 10
ways 10
the 10
politics 10
the 10
law 10
the 10
finance 10
the 10
science 10
the 10
habit 10
of 10
a 10
new 10
land 10
and 10
a 10
new 10
people 10
who 10
have 10
come 10
to 10
be 10
since 10
he 10
was 10
his 10
glimpse 10
that 10
he 10
have 10
had 10
whet 10
his 10
appetite 10
only 10
and 10
enkeen 10
his 10
desire 10
nay 10
it 10
help 10
him 10
to 10
grow 10
as 10
to 10
his 10
brain 10
for 10
it 10
all 10
prove 10
to 10
him 10
how 10
right 10
he 10
was 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
in 10
his 10
surmises 10
he 10
have 10
done 10
this 10
alone 10
all 10
alone 10
from 10
a 10
ruin 10
tomb 10
in 10
a 10
forgotten 10
land 10
what 10
more 10
may 10
he 10
not 10
do 10
when 10
the 10
greater 10
world 10
of 10
thought 10
is 10
open 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
that 10
can 10
smile 10
at 10
death 10
as 10
we 10
know 10
him 10
who 10
can 10
flourish 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
diseases 10
that 10
kill 10
off 10
whole 10
peoples 10
oh 10
if 10
such 10
an 10
one 10
was 10
to 10
come 10
from 10
god 10
and 10
not 10
the 10
devil 10
what 10
a 10
force 10
for 10
good 10
might 10
he 10
not 10
be 10
in 10
this 10
old 10
world 10
of 10
ours 10
but 10
we 10
are 10
pledged 10
to 10
set 10
the 10
world 10
free 10
our 10
toil 10
must 10
be 10
in 10
silence 10
and 10
our 10
efforts 10
all 10
in 10
secret 10
for 10
in 10
this 10
enlightened 10
age 10
when 10
men 10
believe 10
not 10
even 10
what 10
they 10
see 10
the 10
doubting 10
of 10
wise 10
men 10
would 10
be 10
his 10
greatest 10
strength 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
at 10
once 10
his 10
sheath 10
and 10
his 10
armor 10
and 10
his 10
weapons 10
to 10
destroy 10
us 10
his 10
enemies 10
who 10
are 10
willing 10
to 10
peril 10
even 10
our 10
own 10
souls 10
for 10
the 10
safety 10
of 10
one 10
we 10
love 10
for 10
the 10
good 10
of 10
mankind 10
and 10
for 10
the 10
honor 10
and 10
glory 10
of 10
god 10
after 10
a 10
general 10
discussion 10
it 10
was 10
determined 10
that 10
for 10
tonight 10
nothing 10
be 10
definitely 10
settled 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
all 10
sleep 10
on 10
the 10
facts 10
and 10
try 10
to 10
think 10
out 10
the 10
proper 10
conclusions 10
tomorrow 10
at 10
breakfast 10
we 10
are 10
to 10
meet 10
again 10
and 10
after 10
making 10
our 10
conclusions 10
known 10
to 10
one 10
another 10
we 10
shall 10
decide 10
on 10
some 10
definite 10
cause 10
of 10
action 10
i 10
feel 10
a 10
wonderful 10
peace 10
and 10
rest 10
tonight 10
it 10
is 10
as 10
if 10
some 10
haunting 10
presence 10
were 10
removed 10
from 10
me 10
perhaps 10
my 10
surmise 10
was 10
not 10
finished 10
could 10
not 10
be 10
for 10
i 10
caught 10
sight 10
in 10
the 10
mirror 10
of 10
the 10
red 10
mark 10
upon 10
my 10
forehead 10
and 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
still 10
unclean 10
dr 10
sewards 10
diary 10
octoberwe 10
all 10
arose 10
early 10
and 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
sleep 10
did 10
much 10
for 10
each 10
and 10
all 10
of 10
us 10
when 10
we 10
met 10
at 10
early 10
breakfast 10
there 10
was 10
more 10
general 10
cheerfulness 10
than 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
had 10
ever 10
expected 10
to 10
experience 10
again 10
it 10
is 10
really 10
wonderful 10
how 10
much 10
resilience 10
there 10
is 10
in 10
human 10
nature 10
let 10
any 10
obstructing 10
cause 10
no 10
matter 10
what 10
be 10
removed 10
in 10
any 10
way 10
even 10
by 10
death 10
and 10
we 10
fly 10
back 10
to 10
first 10
principles 10
of 10
hope 10
and 10
enjoyment 10
more 10
than 10
once 10
as 10
we 10
sat 10
around 10
the 10
table 10
my 10
eyes 10
opened 10
in 10
wonder 10
whether 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
the 10
past 10
days 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
a 10
dream 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
when 10
i 10
caught 10
sight 10
of 10
the 10
red 10
blotch 10
on 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
forehead 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
brought 10
back 10
to 10
reality 10
even 10
now 10
when 10
i 10
am 10
gravely 10
revolving 10
the 10
matter 10
it 10
is 10
almost 10
impossible 10
to 10
realize 10
that 10
the 10
cause 10
of 10
all 10
our 10
trouble 10
is 10
still 10
existent 10
even 10
mrs 10
harker 10
seems 10
to 10
lose 10
sight 10
of 10
her 10
trouble 10
for 10
whole 10
spells 10
it 10
is 10
only 10
now 10
and 10
again 10
when 10
something 10
recalls 10
it 10
to 10
her 10
mind 10
that 10
she 10
thinks 10
of 10
her 10
terrible 10
scar 10
we 10
are 10
to 10
meet 10
here 10
in 10
my 10
study 10
in 10
half 10
an 10
hour 10
and 10
decide 10
on 10
our 10
course 10
of 10
action 10
i 10
see 10
only 10
one 10
immediate 10
difficulty 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
by 10
instinct 10
rather 10
than 10
reason 10
we 10
shall 10
all 10
have 10
to 10
speak 10
frankly 10
and 10
yet 10
i 10
fear 10
that 10
in 10
some 10
mysterious 10
way 10
poor 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
tongue 10
is 10
tied 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
she 10
forms 10
conclusions 10
of 10
her 10
own 10
and 10
from 10
all 10
that 10
has 10
been 10
i 10
can 10
guess 10
how 10
brilliant 10
and 10
how 10
true 10
they 10
must 10
be 10
but 10
she 10
will 10
not 10
or 10
cannot 10
give 10
them 10
utterance 10
i 10
have 10
mentioned 10
this 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
he 10
and 10
i 10
are 10
to 10
talk 10
it 10
over 10
when 10
we 10
are 10
alone 10
i 10
suppose 10
it 10
is 10
some 10
of 10
that 10
horrid 10
poison 10
which 10
has 10
got 10
into 10
her 10
veins 10
beginning 10
to 10
work 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
his 10
own 10
purposes 10
when 10
he 10
gave 10
her 10
what 10
van 10
helsing 10
called 10
the 10
vampires 10
baptism 10
of 10
blood 10
well 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
a 10
poison 10
that 10
distills 10
itself 10
out 10
of 10
good 10
things 10
in 10
an 10
age 10
when 10
the 10
existence 10
of 10
ptomaines 10
is 10
a 10
mystery 10
we 10
should 10
not 10
wonder 10
at 10
anything 10
one 10
thing 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
if 10
my 10
instinct 10
be 10
true 10
regarding 10
poor 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
silences 10
then 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
terrible 10
difficulty 10
an 10
unknown 10
danger 10
in 10
the 10
work 10
before 10
us 10
the 10
same 10
power 10
that 10
compels 10
her 10
silence 10
may 10
compel 10
her 10
speech 10
i 10
dare 10
not 10
think 10
further 10
for 10
so 10
i 10
should 10
in 10
my 10
thoughts 10
dishonor 10
a 10
noble 10
woman 10
laterwhen 10
the 10
professor 10
came 10
in 10
we 10
talked 10
over 10
the 10
state 10
of 10
things 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
something 10
on 10
his 10
mind 10
which 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
say 10
but 10
felt 10
some 10
hesitancy 10
about 10
broaching 10
the 10
subject 10
after 10
beating 10
about 10
the 10
bush 10
a 10
little 10
he 10
said 10
friend 10
john 10
there 10
is 10
something 10
that 10
you 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
talk 10
of 10
alone 10
just 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
later 10
we 10
may 10
have 10
to 10
take 10
the 10
others 10
into 10
our 10
confidence 10
then 10
he 10
stopped 10
so 10
i 10
waited 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
madam 10
mina 10
our 10
poor 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
is 10
changing 10
a 10
cold 10
shiver 10
ran 10
through 10
me 10
to 10
find 10
my 10
worst 10
fears 10
thus 10
endorsed 10
van 10
helsing 10
continued 10
with 10
the 10
sad 10
experience 10
of 10
miss 10
lucy 10
we 10
must 10
this 10
time 10
be 10
warned 10
before 10
things 10
go 10
too 10
far 10
our 10
task 10
is 10
now 10
in 10
reality 10
more 10
difficult 10
than 10
ever 10
and 10
this 10
new 10
trouble 10
makes 10
every 10
hour 10
of 10
the 10
direst 10
importance 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
the 10
characteristics 10
of 10
the 10
vampire 10
coming 10
in 10
her 10
face 10
it 10
is 10
now 10
but 10
very 10
very 10
slight 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
seen 10
if 10
we 10
have 10
eyes 10
to 10
notice 10
without 10
prejudge 10
her 10
teeth 10
are 10
sharper 10
and 10
at 10
times 10
her 10
eyes 10
are 10
more 10
hard 10
but 10
these 10
are 10
not 10
all 10
there 10
is 10
to 10
her 10
the 10
silence 10
now 10
often 10
as 10
so 10
it 10
was 10
with 10
miss 10
lucy 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
speak 10
even 10
when 10
she 10
wrote 10
that 10
which 10
she 10
wished 10
to 10
be 10
known 10
later 10
now 10
my 10
fear 10
is 10
this 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
she 10
can 10
by 10
our 10
hypnotic 10
trance 10
tell 10
what 10
the 10
count 10
see 10
and 10
hear 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
more 10
true 10
that 10
he 10
who 10
have 10
hypnotize 10
her 10
first 10
and 10
who 10
have 10
drink 10
of 10
her 10
very 10
blood 10
and 10
make 10
her 10
drink 10
of 10
his 10
should 10
if 10
he 10
will 10
compel 10
her 10
mind 10
to 10
disclose 10
to 10
him 10
that 10
which 10
she 10
know 10
i 10
nodded 10
acquiescence 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
then 10
what 10
we 10
must 10
do 10
is 10
to 10
prevent 10
this 10
we 10
must 10
keep 10
her 10
ignorant 10
of 10
our 10
intent 10
and 10
so 10
she 10
cannot 10
tell 10
what 10
she 10
know 10
not 10
this 10
is 10
a 10
painful 10
task 10
oh 10
so 10
painful 10
that 10
it 10
heartbreak 10
me 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
it 10
but 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
when 10
today 10
we 10
meet 10
i 10
must 10
tell 10
her 10
that 10
for 10
reason 10
which 10
we 10
will 10
not 10
to 10
speak 10
she 10
must 10
not 10
more 10
be 10
of 10
our 10
council 10
but 10
be 10
simply 10
guarded 10
by 10
us 10
he 10
wiped 10
his 10
forehead 10
which 10
had 10
broken 10
out 10
in 10
profuse 10
perspiration 10
at 10
the 10
thought 10
of 10
the 10
pain 10
which 10
he 10
might 10
have 10
to 10
inflict 10
upon 10
the 10
poor 10
soul 10
already 10
so 10
tortured 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
some 10
sort 10
of 10
comfort 10
to 10
him 10
if 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
that 10
i 10
also 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
the 10
same 10
conclusion 10
for 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
it 10
would 10
take 10
away 10
the 10
pain 10
of 10
doubt 10
i 10
told 10
him 10
and 10
the 10
effect 10
was 10
as 10
i 10
expected 10
it 10
is 10
now 10
close 10
to 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
our 10
general 10
gathering 10
van 10
helsing 10
has 10
gone 10
away 10
to 10
prepare 10
for 10
the 10
meeting 10
and 10
his 10
painful 10
part 10
of 10
it 10
i 10
really 10
believe 10
his 10
purpose 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
pray 10
alone 10
laterat 10
the 10
very 10
outset 10
of 10
our 10
meeting 10
a 10
great 10
personal 10
relief 10
was 10
experienced 10
by 10
both 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
myself 10
mrs 10
harker 10
had 10
sent 10
a 10
message 10
by 10
her 10
husband 10
to 10
say 10
that 10
she 10
would 10
not 10
join 10
us 10
at 10
present 10
as 10
she 10
thought 10
it 10
better 10
that 10
we 10
should 10
be 10
free 10
to 10
discuss 10
our 10
movements 10
without 10
her 10
presence 10
to 10
embarrass 10
us 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
each 10
other 10
for 10
an 10
instant 10
and 10
somehow 10
we 10
both 10
seemed 10
relieved 10
for 10
my 10
own 10
part 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
if 10
mrs 10
harker 10
realized 10
the 10
danger 10
herself 10
it 10
was 10
much 10
pain 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
much 10
danger 10
averted 10
under 10
the 10
circumstances 10
we 10
agreed 10
by 10
a 10
questioning 10
look 10
and 10
answer 10
with 10
finger 10
on 10
lip 10
to 10
preserve 10
silence 10
in 10
our 10
suspicions 10
until 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
able 10
to 10
confer 10
alone 10
again 10
we 10
went 10
at 10
once 10
into 10
our 10
plan 10
of 10
campaign 10
van 10
helsing 10
roughly 10
put 10
the 10
facts 10
before 10
us 10
first 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
left 10
the 10
thames 10
yesterday 10
morning 10
it 10
will 10
take 10
her 10
at 10
the 10
quickest 10
speed 10
she 10
has 10
ever 10
made 10
at 10
least 10
three 10
weeks 10
to 10
reach 10
varna 10
but 10
we 10
can 10
travel 10
overland 10
to 10
the 10
same 10
place 10
in 10
three 10
days 10
now 10
if 10
we 10
allow 10
for 10
two 10
days 10
less 10
for 10
the 10
ships 10
voyage 10
owing 10
to 10
such 10
weather 10
influences 10
as 10
we 10
know 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
can 10
bring 10
to 10
bear 10
and 10
if 10
we 10
allow 10
a 10
whole 10
day 10
and 10
night 10
for 10
any 10
delays 10
which 10
may 10
occur 10
to 10
us 10
then 10
we 10
have 10
a 10
margin 10
of 10
nearly 10
two 10
weeks 10
thus 10
in 10
order 10
to 10
be 10
quite 10
safe 10
we 10
must 10
leave 10
here 10
on 10
th 10
at 10
latest 10
then 10
we 10
shall 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
be 10
in 10
varna 10
a 10
day 10
before 10
the 10
ship 10
arrives 10
and 10
able 10
to 10
make 10
such 10
preparations 10
as 10
may 10
be 10
necessary 10
of 10
course 10
we 10
shall 10
all 10
go 10
armed 10
armed 10
against 10
evil 10
things 10
spiritual 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
physical 10
here 10
quincey 10
morris 10
added 10
i 10
understand 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
comes 10
from 10
a 10
wolf 10
country 10
and 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
he 10
shall 10
get 10
there 10
before 10
us 10
i 10
propose 10
that 10
we 10
add 10
winchesters 10
to 10
our 10
armament 10
i 10
have 10
a 10
kind 10
of 10
belief 10
in 10
a 10
winchester 10
when 10
there 10
is 10
any 10
trouble 10
of 10
that 10
sort 10
around 10
do 10
you 10
remember 10
art 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
the 10
pack 10
after 10
us 10
at 10
tobolsk 10
what 10
wouldnt 10
we 10
have 10
given 10
then 10
for 10
a 10
repeater 10
apiece 10
good 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
winchesters 10
it 10
shall 10
be 10
quinceys 10
head 10
is 10
level 10
at 10
times 10
but 10
most 10
so 10
when 10
there 10
is 10
to 10
hunt 10
metaphor 10
be 10
more 10
dishonor 10
to 10
science 10
than 10
wolves 10
be 10
of 10
danger 10
to 10
man 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
we 10
can 10
do 10
nothing 10
here 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
varna 10
is 10
not 10
familiar 10
to 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
why 10
not 10
go 10
there 10
more 10
soon 10
it 10
is 10
as 10
long 10
to 10
wait 10
here 10
as 10
there 10
tonight 10
and 10
tomorrow 10
we 10
can 10
get 10
ready 10
and 10
then 10
if 10
all 10
be 10
well 10
we 10
four 10
can 10
set 10
out 10
on 10
our 10
journey 10
we 10
four 10
said 10
harker 10
interrogatively 10
looking 10
from 10
one 10
to 10
another 10
of 10
us 10
of 10
course 10
answered 10
the 10
professor 10
quickly 10
you 10
must 10
remain 10
to 10
take 10
care 10
of 10
your 10
so 10
sweet 10
wife 10
harker 10
was 10
silent 10
for 10
awhile 10
and 10
then 10
said 10
in 10
a 10
hollow 10
voice 10
let 10
us 10
talk 10
of 10
that 10
part 10
of 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
i 10
want 10
to 10
consult 10
with 10
mina 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
now 10
was 10
the 10
time 10
for 10
van 10
helsing 10
to 10
warn 10
him 10
not 10
to 10
disclose 10
our 10
plan 10
to 10
her 10
but 10
he 10
took 10
no 10
notice 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
him 10
significantly 10
and 10
coughed 10
for 10
answer 10
he 10
put 10
his 10
finger 10
to 10
his 10
lips 10
and 10
turned 10
away 10

afternoonfor 10
some 10
time 10
after 10
our 10
meeting 10
this 10
morning 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
think 10
the 10
new 10
phases 10
of 10
things 10
leave 10
my 10
mind 10
in 10
a 10
state 10
of 10
wonder 10
which 10
allows 10
no 10
room 10
for 10
active 10
thought 10
minas 10
determination 10
not 10
to 10
take 10
any 10
part 10
in 10
the 10
discussion 10
set 10
me 10
thinking 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
argue 10
the 10
matter 10
with 10
her 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
guess 10
i 10
am 10
as 10
far 10
as 10
ever 10
from 10
a 10
solution 10
now 10
the 10
way 10
the 10
others 10
received 10
it 10
too 10
puzzled 10
me 10
the 10
last 10
time 10
we 10
talked 10
of 10
the 10
subject 10
we 10
agreed 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
to 10
be 10
no 10
more 10
concealment 10
of 10
anything 10
amongst 10
us 10
mina 10
is 10
sleeping 10
now 10
calmly 10
and 10
sweetly 10
like 10
a 10
little 10
child 10
her 10
lips 10
are 10
curved 10
and 10
her 10
face 10
beams 10
with 10
happiness 10
thank 10
god 10
there 10
are 10
such 10
moments 10
still 10
for 10
her 10
laterhow 10
strange 10
it 10
all 10
is 10
i 10
sat 10
watching 10
minas 10
happy 10
sleep 10
and 10
i 10
came 10
as 10
near 10
to 10
being 10
happy 10
myself 10
as 10
i 10
suppose 10
i 10
shall 10
ever 10
be 10
as 10
the 10
evening 10
drew 10
on 10
and 10
the 10
earth 10
took 10
its 10
shadows 10
from 10
the 10
sun 10
sinking 10
lower 10
the 10
silence 10
of 10
the 10
room 10
grew 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
solemn 10
to 10
me 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
mina 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
looking 10
at 10
me 10
tenderly 10
said 10
jonathan 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
promise 10
me 10
something 10
on 10
your 10
word 10
of 10
honor 10
a 10
promise 10
made 10
to 10
me 10
but 10
made 10
holily 10
in 10
gods 10
hearing 10
and 10
not 10
to 10
be 10
broken 10
though 10
i 10
should 10
go 10
down 10
on 10
my 10
knees 10
and 10
implore 10
you 10
with 10
bitter 10
tears 10
quick 10
you 10
must 10
make 10
it 10
to 10
me 10
at 10
once 10
mina 10
i 10
said 10
a 10
promise 10
like 10
that 10
i 10
cannot 10
make 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
may 10
have 10
no 10
right 10
to 10
make 10
it 10
but 10
dear 10
one 10
she 10
said 10
with 10
such 10
spiritual 10
intensity 10
that 10
her 10
eyes 10
were 10
like 10
pole 10
stars 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
who 10
wish 10
it 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
for 10
myself 10
you 10
can 10
ask 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
if 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
right 10
if 10
he 10
disagrees 10
you 10
may 10
do 10
as 10
you 10
will 10
nay 10
more 10
if 10
you 10
all 10
agree 10
later 10
you 10
are 10
absolved 10
from 10
the 10
promise 10
i 10
promisei 10
said 10
and 10
for 10
a 10
moment 10
she 10
looked 10
supremely 10
happy 10
though 10
to 10
me 10
all 10
happiness 10
for 10
her 10
was 10
denied 10
by 10
the 10
red 10
scar 10
on 10
her 10
forehead 10
she 10
said 10
promise 10
me 10
that 10
you 10
will 10
not 10
tell 10
me 10
anything 10
of 10
the 10
plans 10
formed 10
for 10
the 10
campaign 10
against 10
the 10
count 10
not 10
by 10
word 10
or 10
inference 10
or 10
implication 10
not 10
at 10
any 10
time 10
whilst 10
this 10
remains 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
she 10
solemnly 10
pointed 10
to 10
the 10
scar 10
i 10
saw 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
in 10
earnest 10
and 10
said 10
solemnly 10
i 10
promise 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
said 10
it 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
from 10
that 10
instant 10
a 10
door 10
had 10
been 10
shut 10
between 10
us 10
later 10
midnightmina 10
has 10
been 10
bright 10
and 10
cheerful 10
all 10
the 10
evening 10
so 10
much 10
so 10
that 10
all 10
the 10
rest 10
seemed 10
to 10
take 10
courage 10
as 10
if 10
infected 10
somewhat 10
with 10
her 10
gaiety 10
as 10
a 10
result 10
even 10
i 10
myself 10
felt 10
as 10
if 10
the 10
pall 10
of 10
gloom 10
which 10
weighs 10
us 10
down 10
were 10
somewhat 10
lifted 10
we 10
all 10
retired 10
early 10
mina 10
is 10
now 10
sleeping 10
like 10
a 10
little 10
child 10
it 10
is 10
wonderful 10
thing 10
that 10
her 10
faculty 10
of 10
sleep 10
remains 10
to 10
her 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
her 10
terrible 10
trouble 10
thank 10
god 10
for 10
it 10
for 10
then 10
at 10
least 10
she 10
can 10
forget 10
her 10
care 10
perhaps 10
her 10
example 10
may 10
affect 10
me 10
as 10
her 10
gaiety 10
did 10
tonight 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
it 10
oh 10
for 10
a 10
dreamless 10
sleep 10
october 10
morninganother 10
surprise 10
mina 10
woke 10
me 10
early 10
about 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
as 10
yesterday 10
and 10
asked 10
me 10
to 10
bring 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
another 10
occassion 10
for 10
hypnotism 10
and 10
without 10
question 10
went 10
for 10
the 10
professor 10
he 10
had 10
evidently 10
expected 10
some 10
such 10
call 10
for 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
dressed 10
in 10
his 10
room 10
his 10
door 10
was 10
ajar 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
opening 10
of 10
the 10
door 10
of 10
our 10
room 10
he 10
came 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
he 10
passed 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
he 10
asked 10
mina 10
if 10
the 10
others 10
might 10
come 10
too 10
no 10
she 10
said 10
quite 10
simply 10
it 10
will 10
not 10
be 10
necessary 10
you 10
can 10
tell 10
them 10
just 10
as 10
well 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
with 10
you 10
on 10
your 10
journey 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
as 10
startled 10
as 10
i 10
was 10
after 10
a 10
moments 10
pause 10
he 10
asked 10
but 10
why 10
you 10
must 10
take 10
me 10
with 10
you 10
i 10
am 10
safer 10
with 10
you 10
and 10
you 10
shall 10
be 10
safer 10
too 10
but 10
why 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
your 10
safety 10
is 10
our 10
solemnest 10
duty 10
we 10
go 10
into 10
danger 10
to 10
which 10
you 10
are 10
or 10
may 10
be 10
more 10
liable 10
than 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
from 10
from 10
circumstances 10
things 10
that 10
have 10
been 10
he 10
paused 10
embarrassed 10
as 10
she 10
replied 10
she 10
raised 10
her 10
finger 10
and 10
pointed 10
to 10
her 10
forehead 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
is 10
why 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
i 10
can 10
tell 10
you 10
now 10
whilst 10
the 10
sun 10
is 10
coming 10
up 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
able 10
again 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
count 10
wills 10
me 10
i 10
must 10
go 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
if 10
he 10
tells 10
me 10
to 10
come 10
in 10
secret 10
i 10
must 10
by 10
wile 10
by 10
any 10
device 10
to 10
hoodwink 10
even 10
jonathan 10
god 10
saw 10
the 10
look 10
that 10
she 10
turned 10
on 10
me 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
and 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
indeed 10
a 10
recording 10
angel 10
that 10
look 10
is 10
noted 10
to 10
her 10
everlasting 10
honor 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
clasp 10
her 10
hand 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
speak 10
my 10
emotion 10
was 10
too 10
great 10
for 10
even 10
the 10
relief 10
of 10
tears 10
she 10
went 10
on 10
you 10
men 10
are 10
brave 10
and 10
strong 10
you 10
are 10
strong 10
in 10
your 10
numbers 10
for 10
you 10
can 10
defy 10
that 10
which 10
would 10
break 10
down 10
the 10
human 10
endurance 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
had 10
to 10
guard 10
alone 10
besides 10
i 10
may 10
be 10
of 10
service 10
since 10
you 10
can 10
hypnotize 10
me 10
and 10
so 10
learn 10
that 10
which 10
even 10
i 10
myself 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
gravely 10
madam 10
mina 10
you 10
are 10
as 10
always 10
most 10
wise 10
you 10
shall 10
with 10
us 10
come 10
and 10
together 10
we 10
shall 10
do 10
that 10
which 10
we 10
go 10
forth 10
to 10
achieve 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
spoken 10
minas 10
long 10
spell 10
of 10
silence 10
made 10
me 10
look 10
at 10
her 10
she 10
had 10
fallen 10
back 10
on 10
her 10
pillow 10
asleep 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
even 10
wake 10
when 10
i 10
had 10
pulled 10
up 10
the 10
blind 10
and 10
let 10
in 10
the 10
sunlight 10
which 10
flooded 10
the 10
room 10
van 10
helsing 10
motioned 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
come 10
with 10
him 10
quietly 10
we 10
went 10
to 10
his 10
room 10
and 10
within 10
a 10
minute 10
lord 10
godalming 10
dr 10
seward 10
and 10
mr 10
morris 10
were 10
with 10
us 10
also 10
he 10
told 10
them 10
what 10
mina 10
had 10
said 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
we 10
shall 10
leave 10
for 10
varna 10
we 10
have 10
now 10
to 10
deal 10
with 10
a 10
new 10
factor 10
madam 10
mina 10
oh 10
but 10
her 10
soul 10
is 10
true 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
her 10
an 10
agony 10
to 10
tell 10
us 10
so 10
much 10
as 10
she 10
has 10
done 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
most 10
right 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
warned 10
in 10
time 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
no 10
chance 10
lost 10
and 10
in 10
varna 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
ready 10
to 10
act 10
the 10
instant 10
when 10
that 10

at 10
the 10

its 10
root 10
in 10
faith 10
still 10
then 10
when 10
we 10
get 10
the 10
opportunity 10
that 10
we 10

wiped 10
out 10
for 10
it 10
the 10
next 10
moment 10
i 10
grasped 10
his 10
hand 10
instinctively 10
and 10
found 10
it 10
as 10
firm 10
as 10
a 10
piece 10
of 10
steel 10
i 10

harrowing 10
times 10
for 10
us 10
all 10
for 10
each 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
opens 10
up 10
some 10
new 10
danger 10
some 10
new 10

harker 10
has 10
asked 10
me 10
to 10
note 10
this 10
as 10
he 10
says 10
he 10
is 10
hardly 10
equal 10
to 10
the 10
task 10
and 10
he 10
wants 10
an 10
exact 10
record 10
kept 10
i 10
think 10
that 10
none 10
of 10
us 10
were 10
surprised 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
asked 10
to 10
see 10
mrs 10
harker 10
a 10
little 10
before 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
sunset 10
we 10
have 10
of 10
late 10
come 10
to 10
understand 10
that 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
are 10
to 10
her 10
times 10
of 10
peculiar 10
freedom 10
when 10
her 10
old 10
self 10
can 10
be 10
manifest 10
without 10
any 10
controlling 10
force 10
subduing 10
or 10
restraining 10
her 10
or 10
inciting 10
her 10
to 10
action 10
this 10
mood 10
or 10
condition 10
begins 10
some 10
half 10
hour 10
or 10
more 10
before 10
actual 10
sunrise 10
or 10
sunset 10
and 10
lasts 10
till 10
either 10
the 10
sun 10
is 10
high 10
or 10
whilst 10
the 10
clouds 10
are 10
still 10
aglow 10
with 10
the 10
rays 10
streaming 10
above 10
the 10
horizon 10
at 10
first 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
negative 10
condition 10
as 10
if 10
some 10
tie 10
were 10
loosened 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
absolute 10
freedom 10
quickly 10
follows 10
when 10
however 10
the 10
freedom 10
ceases 10
the 10
change 10
back 10
or 10
relapse 10
comes 10
quickly 10
preceeded 10
only 10
by 10
a 10
spell 10
of 10
warning 10
silence 10
tonight 10
when 10
we 10
met 10
she 10
was 10
somewhat 10
constrained 10
and 10
bore 10
all 10
the 10
signs 10
of 10
an 10
internal 10
struggle 10
i 10
put 10
it 10
down 10
myself 10
to 10
her 10
making 10
a 10
violent 10
effort 10
at 10
the 10
earliest 10
instant 10
she 10
could 10
do 10
so 10
a 10
very 10
few 10
minutes 10
however 10
gave 10
her 10
complete 10
control 10
of 10
herself 10
then 10
motioning 10
her 10
husband 10
to 10
sit 10
beside 10
her 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
where 10
she 10
was 10
half 10
reclining 10
she 10
made 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
us 10
bring 10
chairs 10
up 10
close 10
taking 10
her 10
husbands 10
hand 10
in 10
hers 10
she 10
began 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
here 10
together 10
in 10
freedom 10
for 10
perhaps 10
the 10
last 10
time 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
you 10
will 10
always 10
be 10
with 10
me 10
to 10
the 10
end 10
this 10
was 10
to 10
her 10
husband 10
whose 10
hand 10
had 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
tightened 10
upon 10
her 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
we 10
go 10
out 10
upon 10
our 10
task 10
and 10
god 10
alone 10
knows 10
what 10
may 10
be 10
in 10
store 10
for 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
you 10
are 10
going 10
to 10
be 10
so 10
good 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
take 10
me 10
with 10
you 10
i 10
know 10
that 10
all 10
that 10
brave 10
earnest 10
men 10
can 10
do 10
for 10
a 10
poor 10
weak 10
woman 10
whose 10
soul 10
perhaps 10
is 10
lost 10
no 10
no 10
not 10
yet 10
but 10
is 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
at 10
stake 10
you 10
will 10
do 10
but 10
you 10
must 10
remember 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
as 10
you 10
are 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
poison 10
in 10
my 10
blood 10
in 10
my 10
soul 10
which 10
may 10
destroy 10
me 10
which 10
must 10
destroy 10
me 10
unless 10
some 10
relief 10
comes 10
to 10
us 10
oh 10
my 10
friends 10
you 10
know 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
do 10
that 10
my 10
soul 10
is 10
at 10
stake 10
and 10
though 10
i 10
know 10
there 10
is 10
one 10
way 10
out 10
for 10
me 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
and 10
i 10
must 10
not 10
take 10
it 10
she 10
looked 10
appealingly 10
to 10
us 10
all 10
in 10
turn 10
beginning 10
and 10
ending 10
with 10
her 10
husband 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
way 10
asked 10
van 10
helsing 10
in 10
a 10
hoarse 10
voice 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
way 10
which 10
we 10
must 10
not 10
may 10
not 10
take 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
die 10
now 10
either 10
by 10
my 10
own 10
hand 10
or 10
that 10
of 10
another 10
before 10
the 10
greater 10
evil 10
is 10
entirely 10
wrought 10
i 10
know 10
and 10
you 10
know 10
that 10
were 10
i 10
once 10
dead 10
you 10
could 10
and 10
would 10
set 10
free 10
my 10
immortal 10
spirit 10
even 10
as 10
you 10
did 10
my 10
poor 10
lucys 10
were 10
death 10
or 10
the 10
fear 10
of 10
death 10
the 10
only 10
thing 10
that 10
stood 10
in 10
the 10
way 10
i 10
would 10
not 10
shrink 10
to 10
die 10
here 10
now 10
amidst 10
the 10
friends 10
who 10
love 10
me 10
but 10
death 10
is 10
not 10
all 10
i 10
cannot 10
believe 10
that 10
to 10
die 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
case 10
when 10
there 10
is 10
hope 10
before 10
us 10
and 10
a 10
bitter 10
task 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
is 10
gods 10
will 10
therefore 10
i 10
on 10
my 10
part 10
give 10
up 10
here 10
the 10
certainty 10
of 10
eternal 10
rest 10
and 10
go 10
out 10
into 10
the 10
dark 10
where 10
may 10
be 10
the 10
blackest 10
things 10
that 10
the 10
world 10
or 10
the 10
nether 10
world 10
holds 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
silent 10
for 10
we 10
knew 10
instinctively 10
that 10
this 10
was 10
only 10
a 10
prelude 10
the 10
faces 10
of 10
the 10
others 10
were 10
set 10
and 10
harkers 10
grew 10
ashen 10
grey 10
perhaps 10
he 10
guessed 10
better 10
than 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
what 10
was 10
coming 10
she 10
continued 10
this 10
is 10
what 10
i 10
can 10
give 10
into 10
the 10
hotchpot 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
but 10
note 10
the 10
quaint 10
legal 10
phrase 10
which 10
she 10
used 10
in 10
such 10
a 10
place 10
and 10
with 10
all 10
seriousness 10
what 10
will 10
each 10
of 10
you 10
give 10
your 10
lives 10
i 10
know 10
she 10
went 10
on 10
quickly 10
that 10
is 10
easy 10
for 10
brave 10
men 10
your 10
lives 10
are 10
gods 10
and 10
you 10
can 10
give 10
them 10
back 10
to 10
him 10
but 10
what 10
will 10
you 10
give 10
to 10
me 10
she 10
looked 10
again 10
questionly 10
but 10
this 10
time 10
avoided 10
her 10
husbands 10
face 10
quincey 10
seemed 10
to 10
understand 10
he 10
nodded 10
and 10
her 10
face 10
lit 10
up 10
then 10
i 10
shall 10
tell 10
you 10
plainly 10
what 10
i 10
want 10
for 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
no 10
doubtful 10
matter 10
in 10
this 10
connection 10
between 10
us 10
now 10
you 10
must 10
promise 10
me 10
one 10
and 10
all 10
even 10
you 10
my 10
beloved 10
husband 10
that 10
should 10
the 10
time 10
come 10
you 10
will 10
kill 10
me 10
what 10
is 10
that 10
time 10
the 10
voice 10
was 10
quinceys 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
low 10
and 10
strained 10
when 10
you 10
shall 10
be 10
convinced 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
so 10
changed 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
better 10
that 10
i 10
die 10
that 10
i 10
may 10
live 10
when 10
i 10
am 10
thus 10
dead 10
in 10
the 10
flesh 10
then 10
you 10
will 10
without 10
a 10
moments 10
delay 10
drive 10
a 10
stake 10
through 10
me 10
and 10
cut 10
off 10
my 10
head 10
or 10
do 10
whatever 10
else 10
may 10
be 10
wanting 10
to 10
give 10
me 10

was 10
the 10
first 10
to 10
rise 10
after 10
the 10
pause 10
he 10
knelt 10
down 10
before 10
her 10
and 10
taking 10
her 10
hand 10
in 10
his 10
said 10
solemnly 10

only 10
a 10
rough 10
fellow 10
who 10
hasnt 10
perhaps 10
lived 10
as 10

a 10
distinction 10

from 10
the 10

set 10
us 10
and 10

promise 10
you 10
too 10
that 10

take 10
it 10
that 10
the 10
time 10
has 10
come 10
my 10
true 10
friend 10
was 10
all 10
she 10
could 10
say 10
amid 10
her 10
fastfalling 10
tears 10
as 10
bending 10
over 10
she 10
kissed 10
his 10

my 10
dear 10
madam 10
minasaid 10
van 10

and 10
i 10
said 10
lord 10
godalming 10
each 10
of 10
them 10
in 10
turn 10
kneeling 10
to 10
her 10
to 10
take 10
the 10
oath 10
i 10
followed 10
myself 10
then 10
her 10
husband 10
turned 10
to 10
her 10
waneyed 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
greenish 10
pallor 10
which 10
subdued 10
the 10
snowy 10
whiteness 10
of 10
his 10
hair 10
and 10
asked 10
and 10
must 10
i 10
too 10
make 10
such 10
a 10
promise 10
oh 10
my 10
wife 10

too 10
my 10
dearest 10
she 10
said 10
with 10
infinite 10
yearning 10
of 10
pity 10
in 10
her 10
voice 10
and 10
eyes 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
shrink 10
you 10

nearest 10
and 10

all 10
the 10
world 10

are 10
knit 10
into 10
one 10
for 10
all 10
life 10
and 10
all 10
time 10
think 10
dear 10
that 10
there 10
have 10
been 10
times 10
when 10
brave 10
men 10
have 10
killed 10
their 10
wives 10
and 10
their 10
womenkind 10
to 10
keep 10
them 10
from 10
falling 10
into 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
the 10
enemy 10
their 10
hands 10
did 10
not 10
falter 10
any 10
the 10
more 10
because 10
those 10
that 10
they 10
loved 10
implored 10
them 10
to 10
slay 10
them 10
it 10
is 10
mens 10
duty 10
towards 10
those 10
whom 10
they 10
love 10
in 10
such 10
times 10
of 10
sore 10
trial 10
and 10
oh 10
my 10
dear 10
if 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
that 10
i 10
must 10
meet 10
death 10
at 10
any 10
hand 10
let 10
it 10
be 10
at 10
the 10
hand 10
of 10
him 10
that 10
loves 10
me 10
best 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
forgotten 10
your 10
mercy 10
in 10
poor 10
lucys 10
case 10
to 10
him 10
who 10
loved 10
she 10
stopped 10
with 10
a 10
flying 10
blush 10
and 10
changed 10
her 10
phrase 10
to 10
him 10
who 10
had 10
best 10
right 10
to 10
give 10
her 10
peace 10
if 10
that 10
time 10
shall 10
come 10
again 10
i 10
look 10
to 10
you 10
to 10
make 10
it 10
a 10
happy 10
memory 10
of 10
my 10
husbands 10
life 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
his 10
loving 10
hand 10
which 10
set 10
me 10
free 10
from 10
the 10
awful 10
thrall 10
upon 10
me 10
again 10
i 10
swear 10
came 10
the 10
professors 10
resonant 10
voice 10
mrs 10
harker 10
smiled 10
positively 10
smiled 10
as 10
with 10
a 10
sigh 10
of 10
relief 10
she 10
leaned 10
back 10
and 10
said 10
and 10
now 10
one 10
word 10
of 10
warning 10
a 10
warning 10
which 10
you 10
must 10
never 10
forget 10
this 10
time 10
if 10
it 10
ever 10
come 10
may 10
come 10
quickly 10
and 10
unexpectedly 10
and 10
in 10
such 10
case 10
you 10
must 10
lose 10
no 10
time 10
in 10
using 10
your 10
opportunity 10
at 10
such 10
a 10
time 10
i 10
myself 10
might 10
be 10
nay 10
if 10
the 10
time 10
ever 10
come 10
shall 10
be 10
leagued 10
with 10
your 10
enemy 10
against 10
you 10
one 10
more 10
request 10
she 10
became 10
very 10
solemn 10
as 10
she 10
said 10
this 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
vital 10
and 10
necessary 10
like 10
the 10
other 10
but 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
do 10
one 10
thing 10
for 10
me 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
we 10
all 10
acquiesced 10
but 10
no 10
one 10
spoke 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
need 10
to 10
speak 10
i 10
want 10
you 10
to 10
read 10
the 10
burial 10
service 10
she 10
was 10
interrupted 10
by 10
a 10
deep 10
groan 10
from 10
her 10
husband 10
taking 10
his 10
hand 10
in 10
hers 10
she 10
held 10
it 10
over 10
her 10
heart 10
and 10
continued 10
you 10
must 10
read 10
it 10
over 10
me 10
some 10
day 10
whatever 10
may 10
be 10
the 10
issue 10
of 10
all 10
this 10
fearful 10
state 10
of 10
things 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
sweet 10
thought 10
to 10
all 10
or 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
you 10
my 10
dearest 10
will 10
i 10
hope 10
read 10
it 10
for 10
then 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
in 10
your 10
voice 10
in 10
my 10
memory 10
forever 10
come 10
what 10
may 10
but 10
oh 10
my 10
dear 10
one 10
he 10
pleaded 10
death 10
is 10
afar 10
off 10
from 10
you 10
nay 10
she 10
said 10
holding 10
up 10
a 10
warning 10
hand 10
i 10
am 10
deeper 10
in 10
death 10
at 10
this 10
moment 10
than 10
if 10
the 10
weight 10
of 10
an 10
earthly 10
grave 10
lay 10
heavy 10
upon 10
me 10
oh 10
my 10
wife 10
must 10
i 10
read 10
it 10
he 10
said 10
before 10
he 10
began 10
it 10
would 10
comfort 10
me 10
my 10
husband 10
was 10
all 10
she 10
said 10
and 10
he 10
began 10
to 10
read 10
when 10
she 10
had 10
got 10
the 10
book 10
ready 10
how 10
can 10
i 10
how 10
could 10
anyone 10
tell 10
of 10
that 10
strange 10
scene 10
its 10
solemnity 10
its 10
gloom 10
its 10
sadness 10
its 10
horror 10
and 10
withal 10
its 10
sweetness 10
even 10
a 10
sceptic 10
who 10
can 10
see 10
nothing 10
but 10
a 10
travesty 10
of 10
bitter 10
truth 10
in 10
anything 10
holy 10
or 10
emotional 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
melted 10
to 10
the 10
heart 10
had 10
he 10
seen 10
that 10
little 10
group 10
of 10
loving 10
and 10
devoted 10
friends 10
kneeling 10
round 10
that 10
stricken 10
and 10
sorrowing 10
lady 10
or 10
heard 10
the 10
tender 10
passion 10
of 10
her 10
husbands 10
voice 10
as 10
in 10
tones 10
so 10
broken 10
and 10
emotional 10
that 10
often 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
pause 10
he 10
read 10
the 10
simple 10
and 10
beautiful 10
service 10
from 10
the 10
burial 10
of 10

she 10
was 10
right 10
in 10
her 10
instinct 10
strange 10
as 10
it 10
was 10
bizarre 10
as 10
it 10
may 10
hereafter 10
seem 10
even 10
to 10
us 10
who 10
felt 10
its 10
potent 10
influence 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
it 10
comforted 10
us 10
much 10
and 10
the 10
silence 10
which 10
showed 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
coming 10
relapse 10
from 10
her 10
freedom 10
of 10
soul 10

not 10
seem 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
despair 10
to 10
any 10
of 10

god 10
mina 10
is 10
well 10
and 10
looks 10
to 10
be 10
getting 10
stronger 10
her 10
color 10
is 10
coming 10
back 10
she 10
sleeps 10
a 10
great 10
deal 10
throughout 10
the 10
journey 10
she 10
slept 10
nearly 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
before 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
however 10
she 10
is 10
very 10
wakeful 10
and 10
alert 10
and 10
it 10
has 10
become 10
a 10
habit 10
for 10
van 10
helsing 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
her 10
at 10
such 10
times 10
at 10
first 10
some 10
effort 10
was 10
needed 10
and 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
make 10
many 10
passes 10
but 10
now 10
she 10
seems 10
to 10
yield 10
at 10
once 10
as 10
if 10
by 10
habit 10
and 10
scarcely 10
any 10
action 10
is 10
needed 10
he 10
seems 10
to 10
have 10
power 10
at 10
these 10
particular 10
moments 10
to 10
simply 10
will 10
and 10
her 10
thoughts 10
obey 10
him 10
he 10
always 10
asks 10
her 10
what 10
she 10
can 10
see 10
and 10
hear 10
she 10
answers 10
to 10
the 10
first 10
nothing 10
all 10
is 10
dark 10
and 10
to 10
the 10
second 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
the 10
waves 10
lapping 10
against 10
the 10
ship 10
and 10
the 10
water 10
rushing 10
by 10
canvas 10
and 10
cordage 10
strain 10
and 10
masts 10
and 10
yards 10
creak 10
the 10
wind 10
is 10
high 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
it 10
in 10
the 10
shrouds 10
and 10
the 10
bow 10
throws 10
back 10
the 10
foam 10
it 10
is 10
evident 10
that 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
is 10
still 10
at 10
sea 10
hastening 10
on 10
her 10
way 10
to 10
varna 10
lord 10
godalming 10
has 10
just 10
returned 10
he 10
had 10
four 10
telegrams 10
one 10
each 10
day 10
since 10
we 10
started 10
and 10
all 10
to 10
the 10
same 10
effect 10
that 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
had 10
not 10
been 10
reported 10
to 10
lloyds 10
from 10
anywhere 10
he 10
had 10
arranged 10
before 10
leaving 10
london 10
that 10
his 10
agent 10
should 10
send 10
him 10
every 10
day 10
a 10
telegram 10
saying 10
if 10
the 10
ship 10
had 10
been 10
reported 10
he 10
was 10
to 10
have 10
a 10
message 10
even 10
if 10
she 10
were 10
not 10
reported 10
so 10
that 10
he 10
might 10
be 10
sure 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
watch 10
being 10
kept 10
at 10
the 10
other 10
end 10
of 10
the 10
wire 10
we 10
had 10
dinner 10
and 10
went 10
to 10
bed 10
early 10
tomorrow 10
we 10
are 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
vice 10
consul 10
and 10
to 10
arrange 10
if 10
we 10
can 10
about 10
getting 10
on 10
board 10
the 10
ship 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
she 10
arrives 10
van 10
helsing 10
says 10
that 10
our 10
chance 10
will 10
be 10
to 10
get 10
on 10
the 10
boat 10
between 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
the 10
count 10
even 10
if 10
he 10
takes 10
the 10
form 10
of 10
a 10
bat 10
cannot 10
cross 10
the 10
running 10
water 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
volition 10
and 10
so 10
cannot 10
leave 10
the 10
ship 10
as 10
he 10
dare 10
not 10
change 10
to 10
mans 10
form 10
without 10
suspicion 10
which 10
he 10
evidently 10
wishes 10
to 10
avoid 10
he 10
must 10
remain 10
in 10
the 10
box 10
if 10
then 10
we 10
can 10
come 10
on 10
board 10
after 10
sunrise 10
he 10
is 10
at 10
our 10
mercy 10
for 10
we 10
can 10
open 10
the 10
box 10
and 10
make 10
sure 10
of 10
him 10
as 10
we 10
did 10
of 10
poor 10
lucy 10
before 10
he 10
wakes 10
what 10
mercy 10
he 10
shall 10
get 10
from 10
us 10
all 10
will 10
not 10
count 10
for 10
much 10
we 10
think 10
that 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
have 10
much 10
trouble 10
with 10
officials 10
or 10
the 10
seamen 10
thank 10
god 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
country 10
where 10
bribery 10
can 10
do 10
anything 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
well 10
supplied 10
with 10
money 10
we 10
have 10
only 10
to 10
make 10
sure 10
that 10
the 10
ship 10
cannot 10
come 10
into 10
port 10
between 10
sunset 10
and 10
sunrise 10
without 10
our 10
being 10
warned 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
be 10
safe 10
judge 10
moneybag 10
will 10
settle 10
this 10
case 10
i 10
think 10
octoberminas 10
report 10
still 10
the 10
same 10
lapping 10
waves 10
and 10
rushing 10
water 10
darkness 10
and 10
favoring 10
winds 10
we 10
are 10
evidently 10
in 10
good 10
time 10
and 10
when 10
we 10
hear 10
of 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
we 10
shall 10
be 10
ready 10
as 10
she 10
must 10
pass 10
the 10
dardanelles 10
we 10
are 10
sure 10
to 10
have 10
some 10
report 10
octobereverything 10
is 10
pretty 10
well 10
fixed 10
now 10
i 10
think 10
to 10
welcome 10
the 10
count 10
on 10
his 10
return 10
from 10
his 10
tour 10
godalming 10
told 10
the 10
shippers 10
that 10
he 10
fancied 10
that 10
the 10
box 10
sent 10
aboard 10
might 10
contain 10
something 10
stolen 10
from 10
a 10
friend 10
of 10
his 10
and 10
got 10
a 10
half 10
consent 10
that 10
he 10
might 10
open 10
it 10
at 10
his 10
own 10
risk 10
the 10
owner 10
gave 10
him 10
a 10
paper 10
telling 10
the 10
captain 10
to 10
give 10
him 10
every 10
facility 10
in 10
doing 10
whatever 10
he 10
chose 10
on 10
board 10
the 10
ship 10
and 10
also 10
a 10
similar 10
authorization 10
to 10
his 10
agent 10
at 10
varna 10
we 10
have 10
seen 10
the 10
agent 10
who 10
was 10
much 10
impressed 10
with 10
godalmings 10
kindly 10
manner 10
to 10
him 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
all 10
satisfied 10
that 10
whatever 10
he 10
can 10
do 10
to 10
aid 10
our 10
wishes 10
will 10
be 10
done 10
we 10
have 10
already 10
arranged 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
in 10
case 10
we 10
get 10
the 10
box 10
open 10
if 10
the 10
count 10
is 10
there 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
seward 10
will 10
cut 10
off 10
his 10
head 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
drive 10
a 10
stake 10
through 10
his 10
heart 10
morris 10
and 10
godalming 10
and 10
i 10
shall 10
prevent 10
interference 10
even 10
if 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
use 10
the 10
arms 10
which 10
we 10
shall 10
have 10
ready 10
the 10
professor 10
says 10
that 10
if 10
we 10
can 10
so 10
treat 10
the 10
counts 10
body 10
it 10
will 10
soon 10
after 10
fall 10
into 10
dust 10
in 10
such 10
case 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
no 10
evidence 10
against 10
us 10
in 10
case 10
any 10
suspicion 10
of 10
murder 10
were 10
aroused 10
but 10
even 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
not 10
we 10
should 10
stand 10
or 10
fall 10
by 10
our 10
act 10
and 10
perhaps 10
some 10
day 10
this 10
very 10
script 10
may 10
be 10
evidence 10
to 10
come 10
between 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
and 10
a 10
rope 10
for 10
myself 10
i 10
should 10
take 10
the 10
chance 10
only 10
too 10
thankfully 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
to 10
come 10
we 10
mean 10
to 10
leave 10
no 10
stone 10
unturned 10
to 10
carry 10
out 10
our 10
intent 10
we 10
have 10
arranged 10
with 10
certain 10
officials 10
that 10
the 10
instant 10
the 10
czarina 10

van 10
helsing 10
says 10
i 10
must 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
wild 10
with 10
excitement 10
yesterday 10
when 10
godalming 10
got 10
his 10
telegram 10
from 10
lloyds 10
i 10
know 10
now 10
what 10
men 10
feel 10
in 10
battle 10
when 10
the 10
call 10
to 10
action 10
is 10
heard 10
mrs 10
harker 10
alone 10
of 10
our 10
party 10
did 10
not 10
show 10
any 10
signs 10
of 10
emotion 10
after 10
all 10
it 10
is 10
not 10
strange 10
that 10
she 10
did 10
not 10
for 10
we 10
took 10
special 10
care 10
not 10
to 10
let 10
her 10
know 10
anything 10
about 10
it 10
and 10
we 10
all 10
tried 10
not 10
to 10
show 10
any 10
excitement 10
when 10
we 10
were 10
in 10
her 10
presence 10
in 10
old 10
days 10
she 10
would 10
i 10
am 10
sure 10
have 10
noticed 10
no 10
matter 10
how 10
we 10
might 10
have 10
tried 10
to 10
conceal 10
it 10
but 10
in 10
this 10
way 10
she 10
is 10
greatly 10
changed 10
during 10
the 10
past 10
three 10
weeks 10
the 10
lethargy 10
grows 10
upon 10
her 10
and 10
though 10
she 10
seems 10
strong 10
and 10
well 10
and 10
is 10
getting 10
back 10
some 10
of 10
her 10
color 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
are 10
not 10
satisfied 10
we 10
talk 10
of 10
her 10
often 10
we 10
have 10
not 10
however 10
said 10
a 10
word 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
it 10
would 10
break 10
poor 10
harkers 10
heart 10
certainly 10
his 10
nerve 10
if 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
we 10
had 10
even 10
a 10
suspicion 10
on 10
the 10
subject 10
van 10
helsing 10
examines 10
he 10
tells 10
me 10
her 10
teeth 10
very 10
carefully 10
whilst 10
she 10
is 10
in 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
condition 10
for 10
he 10
says 10
that 10
so 10
long 10
as 10
they 10
do 10
not 10
begin 10
to 10
sharpen 10
there 10
is 10
no 10
active 10
danger 10
of 10
a 10
change 10
in 10
her 10
if 10
this 10
change 10
should 10
come 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
necessary 10
to 10
take 10
steps 10
we 10
both 10
know 10
what 10
those 10
steps 10
would 10
have 10
to 10
be 10
though 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
mention 10
our 10
thoughts 10
to 10
each 10
other 10
we 10
should 10
neither 10
of 10
us 10
shrink 10
from 10
the 10
task 10
awful 10
though 10
it 10
be 10
to 10
contemplate 10
euthanasia 10
is 10
an 10
excellent 10
and 10
a 10
comforting 10
word 10
i 10
am 10
grateful 10

the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
has 10
come 10
from 10

she 10

arrive 10
some 10
time 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
but 10
as 10
she 10

possibly 10
get 10

before 10
noon 10
we 10

about 10
to 10

hypnotic 10
report 10
this 10
morning 10
was 10
the 10
same 10
as 10
usual 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
possible 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
get 10
news 10
at 10
any 10
moment 10
we 10
men 10
are 10
all 10
in 10
a 10
fever 10
of 10
excitement 10
except 10
harker 10
who 10
is 10
calm 10
his 10
hands 10
are 10
cold 10
as 10
ice 10
and 10
an 10
hour 10
ago 10
i 10
found 10
him 10
whetting 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
ghoorka 10
knife 10
which 10
he 10
now 10
always 10
carries 10
with 10
him 10
it 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
bad 10
lookout 10
for 10
the 10
count 10
if 10
the 10
edge 10
of 10
that 10
kukri 10
ever 10
touches 10

van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
were 10
a 10
little 10
alarmed 10
about 10
mrs 10
harker 10
today 10
about 10
noon 10
she 10
got 10
into 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
lethargy 10
which 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
like 10
although 10
we 10
kept 10
silence 10
to 10
the 10
others 10
we 10
were 10
neither 10
of 10
us 10
happy 10
about 10
it 10
she 10
had 10
been 10
restless 10
all 10
the 10
morning 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
at 10
first 10
glad 10
to 10
know 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
sleeping 10
when 10
however 10
her 10
husband 10
mentioned 10
casually 10
that 10
she 10
was 10
sleeping 10
so 10
soundly 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
not 10
wake 10
her 10
we 10
went 10
to 10
her 10
room 10
to 10
see 10
for 10
ourselves 10
she 10
was 10
breathing 10
naturally 10
and 10
looked 10
so 10
well 10
and 10
peaceful 10
that 10
we 10
agreed 10
that 10
the 10
sleep 10
was 10
better 10
for 10
her 10
than 10
anything 10
else 10
poor 10
girl 10
she 10
has 10
so 10
much 10
to 10
forget 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
no 10
wonder 10
that 10
sleep 10
if 10
it 10
brings 10
oblivion 10
to 10
her 10
does 10
her 10
good 10
laterour 10
opinion 10
was 10
justified 10
for 10
when 10
after 10
a 10
refreshing 10
sleep 10
of 10
some 10
hours 10
she 10
woke 10
up 10
she 10
seemed 10
brighter 10
and 10
better 10
than 10
she 10
had 10
been 10
for 10
days 10
at 10
sunset 10
she 10
made 10
the 10
usual 10
hypnotic 10
report 10
wherever 10

the 10

announcing 10
the 10
arrival 10
in 10
galatz 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
think 10
it 10
was 10
such 10
a 10
shock 10
to 10
any 10
of 10
us 10
as 10
might 10
have 10
been 10
expected 10
true 10
we 10

not 10
know 10
whence 10
or 10
how 10
or 10
when 10
the 10

would 10

i 10
think 10
we 10
all 10
expected 10
that 10
something 10
strange 10
would 10
happen 10
the 10
day 10
of 10
arrival 10
at 10
varna 10
made 10
us 10
individually 10
satisfied 10
that 10
things 10
would 10
not 10
be 10
just 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
expected 10
we 10
only 10
waited 10
to 10
learn 10
where 10
the 10
change 10
would 10
occur 10
none 10
the 10
less 10
however 10
it 10
was 10
a 10
surprise 10
i 10
suppose 10
that 10
nature 10
works 10
on 10
such 10
a 10
hopeful 10
basis 10
that 10
we 10
believe 10
against 10
ourselves 10
that 10
things 10
will 10
be 10
as 10
they 10
ought 10
to 10
be 10
not 10
as 10
we 10
should 10
know 10
that 10

will 10

raised 10
his 10

over 10
his 10

for 10
a 10
moment 10
as 10
though 10
in 10
remonstrance 10
with 10
the 10
almighty 10
but 10
he 10
said 10
not 10
a 10
word 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
stood 10
up 10
with 10
his 10
face 10
sternly 10
set 10
lord 10
godalming 10
grew 10
very 10
pale 10
and 10
sat 10
breathing 10
heavily 10
i 10
was 10
myself 10
half 10
stunned 10
and 10
looked 10
in 10
wonder 10
at 10
one 10
after 10
another 10
quincey 10
morris 10
tightened 10
his 10
belt 10
with 10
that 10
quick 10
movement 10
which 10
i 10
knew 10
so 10
well 10
in 10
our 10
old 10
wandering 10
days 10
it 10
meant 10
action 10
mrs 10
harker 10
grew 10
ghastly 10
white 10
so 10
that 10
the 10
scar 10
on 10
her 10
forehead 10
seemed 10
to 10
burn 10
but 10
she 10
folded 10
her 10
hands 10
meekly 10
and 10
looked 10
up 10
in 10
prayer 10
harker 10
smiled 10
actually 10
smiled 10
the 10
dark 10
bitter 10
smile 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
is 10
without 10
hope 10
but 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
his 10
action 10
belied 10
his 10
words 10
for 10
his 10
hands 10
instinctively 10
sought 10
the 10
hilt 10
of 10
the 10
great 10
kukri 10
knife 10
and 10
rested 10
there 10
when 10
does 10
the 10
next 10
train 10
start 10
for 10
galatz 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
to 10
us 10
generally 10
at 10
tomorrow 10
morning 10
we 10
all 10
started 10
for 10
the 10
answer 10
came 10
from 10
mrs 10
harker 10
how 10
on 10
earth 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
said 10
art 10
you 10
forget 10
or 10
perhaps 10
you 10
do 10
not 10
know 10
though 10
jonathan 10
does 10
and 10
so 10
does 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
the 10
train 10
fiend 10
at 10
home 10
in 10
exeter 10
i 10
always 10
used 10
to 10
make 10
up 10
the 10
time 10
tables 10
so 10
as 10
to 10
be 10
helpful 10
to 10
my 10
husband 10
i 10
found 10
it 10
so 10
useful 10
sometimes 10
that 10
i 10
always 10
make 10
a 10
study 10
of 10
the 10
time 10
tables 10
now 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
if 10
anything 10
were 10
to 10
take 10
us 10
to 10
castle 10
dracula 10
we 10
should 10
go 10
by 10
galatz 10
or 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
through 10
bucharest 10
so 10
i 10
learned 10
the 10
times 10
very 10
carefully 10
unhappily 10
there 10
are 10
not 10
many 10
to 10
learn 10
as 10
the 10
only 10

asked 10
lord 10
godalming 10
van 10
helsing 10
shook 10
his 10
head 10
i 10
fear 10
not 10
this 10
land 10
is 10
very 10
different 10
from 10
yours 10
or 10
mine 10
even 10
if 10
we 10
did 10
have 10
a 10
special 10
it 10
would 10
probably 10
not 10
arrive 10
as 10
soon 10
as 10
our 10
regular 10
train 10
moreover 10
we 10
have 10
something 10
to 10
prepare 10
we 10
must 10
think 10
now 10

that 10
all 10

ready 10
for 10
us 10
to 10
go 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
do 10
you 10

to 10
the 10
agent 10
in 10
galatz 10
with 10
authority 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
search 10
of 10
the 10

happier 10
at 10
the 10
moment 10
as 10
they 10
seemed 10
to 10
realize 10
the 10
significance 10
of 10
her 10
words 10
but 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
turning 10
to 10
each 10
other 10
met 10
each 10
a 10
grave 10
and 10
troubled 10
glance 10
we 10
said 10
nothing 10
at 10
the 10
time 10
however 10
when 10
the 10
three 10
men 10
had 10
gone 10
out 10
to 10
their 10
tasks 10
van 10
helsing 10
asked 10
mrs 10
harker 10

at 10
the 10
castle 10
she 10
went 10
away 10
to 10
get 10
it 10
when 10
the 10
door 10
was 10
shut 10
upon 10
her 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
we 10
mean 10
the 10
same 10
speak 10
out 10
here 10
is 10
some 10
change 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
hope 10
that 10
makes 10
me 10
sick 10
for 10
it 10
may 10
deceive 10
us 10
quite 10
so 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
why 10
i 10
asked 10
her 10
to 10
get 10
the 10
manuscript 10
no 10
said 10
i 10
unless 10
it 10
was 10
to 10
get 10
an 10
opportunity 10
of 10
seeing 10
me 10
alone 10
you 10
are 10
in 10
part 10
right 10
friend 10

in 10
part 10
i 10

friend 10

am 10
taking 10
a 10
great 10
a 10
terrible 10
risk 10
but 10
i 10
believe 10
it 10
is 10
right 10
in 10
the 10
moment 10
when 10
madam 10
mina 10
said 10
those 10
words 10
that 10
arrest 10
both 10
our 10
understanding 10
an 10
inspiration 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
in 10
the 10
trance 10
of 10
three 10
days 10
ago 10
the 10
count 10
sent 10
her 10
his 10
spirit 10
to 10
read 10
her 10
mind 10
or 10
more 10
like 10
he 10
took 10
her 10
to 10
see 10
him 10
in 10
his 10
earth 10
box 10
in 10
the 10
ship 10
with 10
water 10
rushing 10
just 10
as 10
it 10
go 10
free 10
at 10
rise 10
and 10
set 10
of 10
sun 10
he 10
learn 10
then 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
here 10
for 10
she 10
have 10
more 10
to 10
tell 10
in 10
her 10
open 10
life 10
with 10
eyes 10
to 10
see 10
ears 10
to 10
hear 10
than 10
he 10
shut 10
as 10
he 10
is 10
in 10
his 10
coffin 10
box 10
now 10
he 10
make 10
his 10
most 10
effort 10
to 10
escape 10
us 10
at 10
present 10
he 10
want 10
her 10
not 10
he 10
is 10
sure 10
with 10
his 10
so 10
great 10
knowledge 10
that 10
she 10
will 10
come 10
at 10
his 10
call 10
but 10
he 10
cut 10
her 10
off 10
take 10
her 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
do 10
out 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
power 10
that 10
so 10
she 10
come 10
not 10
to 10
him 10
ah 10
there 10
i 10
have 10
hope 10
that 10
our 10
man 10
brains 10
that 10
have 10
been 10
of 10
man 10
so 10
long 10
and 10
that 10
have 10
not 10
lost 10
the 10
grace 10
of 10
god 10
will 10
come 10
higher 10
than 10
his 10
childbrain 10
that 10
lie 10
in 10
his 10
tomb 10
for 10
centuries 10
that 10
grow 10
not 10
yet 10
to 10
our 10
stature 10
and 10
that 10
do 10
only 10
work 10
selfish 10
and 10
therefore 10
small 10
here 10
comes 10
madam 10
mina 10
not 10
a 10
word 10
to 10
her 10
of 10
her 10
trance 10
she 10
knows 10
it 10
not 10
and 10
it 10
would 10
overwhelm 10
her 10
and 10
make 10
despair 10
just 10
when 10
we 10
want 10
all 10
her 10
hope 10
all 10
her 10
courage 10
when 10
most 10
we 10
want 10
all 10
her 10
great 10
brain 10
which 10
is 10
trained 10
like 10
mans 10
brain 10
but 10
is 10
of 10
sweet 10
woman 10
and 10
have 10
a 10
special 10
power 10
which 10
the 10
count 10
give 10
her 10
and 10
which 10
he 10
may 10
not 10
take 10
away 10
altogether 10
though 10
he 10
think 10
not 10
so 10
hush 10
let 10
me 10
speak 10
and 10
you 10
shall 10
learn 10
oh 10
john 10
my 10
friend 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
awful 10
straits 10
i 10
fear 10
as 10
i 10
never 10
feared 10
before 10
we 10
can 10
only 10
trust 10
the 10
good 10
god 10
silence 10
here 10
she 10
comes 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
the 10
professor 10
was 10
going 10
to 10
break 10
down 10
and 10
have 10
hysterics 10
just 10
as 10
he 10
had 10
when 10
lucy 10
died 10
but 10
with 10
a 10
great 10
effort 10
he 10
controlled 10
himself 10
and 10
was 10
at 10
perfect 10
nervous 10
poise 10
when 10
mrs 10
harker 10
tripped 10
into 10
the 10
room 10
bright 10
and 10
happy 10
looking 10
and 10
in 10
the 10
doing 10
of 10
work 10
seemingly 10
forgetful 10
of 10
her 10
misery 10
as 10
she 10
came 10
in 10
she 10
handed 10
a 10
number 10
of 10
sheets 10
of 10
typewriting 10
to 10
van 10
helsing 10
he 10
looked 10
over 10
them 10
gravely 10
his 10
face 10
brightening 10
up 10
as 10
he 10
read 10
then 10
holding 10
the 10
pages 10
between 10
his 10
finger 10
and 10
thumb 10
he 10
said 10
friend 10
john 10

so 10
much 10
experience 10
already 10

a 10
lesson 10
do 10
not 10
fear 10
ever 10
to 10
think 10
a 10
half 10
thought 10
has 10
been 10
buzzing 10
often 10
in 10
my 10
brain 10
but 10
i 10
fear 10
to 10
let 10
him 10
loose 10
his 10
wings 10
here 10
now 10
with 10
more 10
knowledge 10
i 10
go 10
back 10
to 10
where 10
that 10
half 10
thought 10
come 10
from 10
and 10
i 10
find 10
that 10
he 10
be 10
no 10
half 10
thought 10
at 10
all 10
that 10
be 10
a 10
whole 10
thought 10
though 10
so 10
young 10
that 10
he 10
is 10
not 10
yet 10
strong 10
to 10
use 10
his 10
little 10
wings 10
nay 10
like 10
the 10
ugly 10
duck 10
of 10
my 10
friend 10
hans 10
andersen 10
he 10
be 10
no 10
duck 10
thought 10
at 10
all 10
but 10
a 10
big 10
swan 10
thought 10
that 10
sail 10
nobly 10
on 10
big 10
wings 10
when 10
the 10
time 10
come 10
for 10
him 10
to 10
try 10
them 10
see 10
i 10
read 10
here 10
what 10
jonathan 10
have 10
written 10
that 10
other 10
of 10
his 10
race 10
who 10
in 10
a 10
later 10
age 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
brought 10
his 10
forces 10
over 10
the 10
great 10
river 10
into 10
turkey 10
land 10
who 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
beaten 10
back 10
came 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
and 10
again 10
though 10
he 10
had 10
to 10
come 10
alone 10
from 10
the 10
bloody 10
field 10
where 10
his 10
troops 10
were 10
being 10
slaughtered 10
since 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
he 10
alone 10
could 10
ultimately 10
triumph 10
what 10
does 10
this 10
tell 10
us 10
not 10
much 10
no 10
the 10
counts 10
child 10
thought 10
see 10
nothing 10
therefore 10
he 10
speak 10
so 10
free 10
your 10
man 10
thought 10
see 10
nothing 10

nothing 10
till 10
just 10
now 10
no 10
but 10
there 10
comes 10
another 10
word 10
from 10
some 10
one 10
who 10
speak 10
without 10
thought 10
because 10
she 10
too 10
know 10
not 10
what 10
it 10
mean 10
what 10
it 10
might 10
mean 10
just 10
as 10
there 10
are 10
elements 10
which 10
rest 10
yet 10
when 10
in 10
natures 10
course 10
they 10
move 10
on 10
their 10
way 10
and 10
they 10
touch 10
the 10
pouf 10
and 10
there 10
comes 10
a 10
flash 10
of 10
light 10
heaven 10
wide 10
that 10
blind 10
and 10
kill 10
and 10
destroy 10
some 10
but 10
that 10
show 10
up 10
all 10
earth 10
below 10
for 10
leagues 10
and 10
leagues 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
so 10
well 10
i 10
shall 10
explain 10
to 10
begin 10
hav 10
e 10

and 10
argues 10
not 10
a 10
particulari 10
ad 10
universale 10
there 10
is 10
this 10
peculiarity 10
in 10
criminals 10
it 10
is 10
so 10
constant 10
in 10
all 10
countries 10
and 10
at 10
all 10
times 10
that 10
even 10
police 10
who 10
know 10
not 10
much 10
from 10
philosophy 10
come 10
to 10
know 10
it 10
empirically 10
that 10
it 10
is 10

at 10
one 10
crime 10
that 10
is 10
the 10
true 10
criminal 10
who 10
seems 10
predestinate 10
to 10
crime 10
and 10
who 10
will 10
of 10
none 10
other 10
this 10
criminal 10
has 10
not 10
full 10
man 10
brain 10
he 10
is 10
clever 10
and 10
cunning 10
and 10
resourceful 10
but 10
he 10
be 10
not 10
of 10
man 10

mrs 10
harker 10
began 10
to 10
clap 10
her 10
hands 10
and 10
her 10
eyes 10
sparkled 10
he 10
went 10
on 10
now 10
you 10
shall 10
speak 10
tell 10
us 10
two 10
dry 10
men 10
of 10
science 10
what 10
you 10
see 10
with 10
those 10
so 10
bright 10
eyes 10
he 10
took 10
her 10
hand 10
and 10
held 10
it 10
whilst 10
he 10
spoke 10
his 10
finger 10
and 10
thumb 10
closed 10
on 10
her 10
pulse 10
as 10
i 10
thought 10
instinctively 10
and 10
unconsciously 10
as 10
she 10
spoke 10
the 10
count 10
is 10
a 10
criminal 10
and 10
of 10
criminal 10
type 10
nordau 10
and 10
lombroso 10
would 10
so 10
classify 10
him 10
and 10
qua 10
criminal 10
he 10
is 10
of 10
an 10
imperfectly 10
formed 10
mind 10
thus 10
in 10
a 10
difficulty 10
he 10
has 10
to 10
seek 10
resource 10
in 10
habit 10
his 10
past 10
is 10
a 10
clue 10
and 10
the 10
one 10
page 10
of 10
it 10
that 10
we 10
know 10
and 10
that 10
from 10
his 10
own 10
lips 10
tells 10
that 10
once 10
before 10
when 10
in 10
what 10
mr 10
morris 10
would 10
call 10
atight 10
place 10
he 10
went 10
back 10
to 10
his 10
own 10
country 10
from 10
the 10
land 10
he 10
had 10
tried 10
to 10
invade 10
and 10
thence 10
without 10
losing 10
purpose 10
prepared 10
himself 10
for 10
a 10
new 10
effort 10
he 10
came 10
again 10
better 10
equipped 10
for 10
his 10
work 10
and 10
won 10
so 10
he 10
came 10
to 10
london 10
to 10
invade 10
a 10
new 10
land 10
he 10
was 10
beaten 10
and 10
when 10
all 10
hope 10
of 10
success 10
was 10
lost 10
and 10
his 10
existence 10
in 10
danger 10
he 10
fled 10
back 10
over 10
the 10
sea 10
to 10
his 10
home 10
just 10
as 10
formerly 10
he 10
had 10
fled 10
back 10
over 10
the 10
danube 10
from 10
turkey 10
land 10
good 10
good 10
oh 10
you 10
so 10
clever 10
lady 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
enthusiastically 10
as 10
he 10
stooped 10
and 10
kissed 10
her 10
hand 10
a 10
moment 10
later 10
he 10
said 10
to 10
me 10
as 10
calmly 10
as 10
though 10
we 10
had 10
been 10
having 10
a 10
sick 10
room 10
consultation 10
seventytwo 10
only 10
and 10
in 10
all 10
this 10
excitement 10
i 10
have 10
hope 10
turning 10
to 10
her 10
again 10
he 10
said 10
with 10
keen 10
expectation 10
but 10
go 10
on 10
go 10
on 10
there 10
is 10
more 10
to 10
tell 10
if 10
you 10
will 10
be 10
not 10
afraid 10
john 10
and 10
i 10
know 10
i 10
do 10
in 10
any 10
case 10
and 10
shall 10
tell 10
you 10
if 10
you 10
are 10
right 10
speak 10
without 10
fear 10
i 10
will 10
try 10
to 10
but 10
you 10
will 10
forgive 10
me 10
if 10
i 10
seem 10
too 10
egotistical 10
nay 10
fear 10
not 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
egotist 10
for 10
it 10
is 10
of 10
you 10
that 10
we 10
think 10
then 10
as 10
he 10
is 10
criminal 10
he 10
is 10
selfish 10
and 10
as 10
his 10
intellect 10
is 10
small 10
and 10
his 10
action 10
is 10
based 10
on 10
selfishness 10
he 10
confines 10
himself 10
to 10
one 10
purpose 10
that 10
purpose 10
is 10
remorseless 10
as 10
he 10
fled 10
back 10
over 10
the 10
danube 10
leaving 10
his 10
forces 10
to 10
be 10
cut 10
to 10
pieces 10
so 10
now 10
he 10
is 10
intent 10
on 10
being 10
safe 10
careless 10
of 10
all 10
so 10
his 10
own 10
selfishness 10
frees 10
my 10
soul 10
somewhat 10
from 10
the 10
terrible 10
power 10
which 10
he 10
acquired 10
over 10
me 10
on 10
that 10
dreadful 10
night 10
i 10
felt 10
it 10
oh 10
i 10
felt 10
it 10
thank 10
god 10
for 10
his 10
great 10
mercy 10
my 10
soul 10
is 10
freer 10
than 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
since 10
that 10
awful 10
hour 10
and 10
all 10
that 10
haunts 10
me 10
is 10
a 10
fear 10
lest 10
in 10
some 10
trance 10
or 10
dream 10
he 10
may 10
have 10
used 10
my 10
knowledge 10
for 10
his 10
ends 10
the 10
professor 10
stood 10
up 10
he 10
has 10
so 10
used 10
your 10
mind 10
and 10
by 10
it 10
he 10
has 10
left 10
us 10
here 10
in 10
varna 10
whilst 10
the 10
ship 10
that 10
carried 10
him 10
rushed 10
through 10
enveloping 10
fog 10
up 10
to 10
galatz 10
where 10
doubtless 10
he 10
had 10
made 10
preparation 10
for 10
escaping 10
from 10
us 10
but 10
his 10
child 10
mind 10
only 10
saw 10
so 10
far 10
and 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
that 10
as 10
ever 10
is 10
in 10
gods 10
providence 10
the 10
very 10
thing 10
that 10
the 10
evil 10
doer 10
most 10
reckoned 10
on 10
for 10
his 10
selfish 10
good 10
turns 10
out 10
to 10
be 10
his 10
chiefest 10
harm 10
the 10
hunter 10
is 10
taken 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
snare 10
as 10
the 10
great 10
psalmist 10
says 10
for 10
now 10
that 10
he 10
think 10
he 10
is 10
free 10
from 10
every 10
trace 10
of 10
us 10
all 10
and 10
that 10
he 10
has 10
escaped 10
us 10
with 10
so 10
many 10
hours 10
to 10
him 10
then 10
his 10
selfish 10
child 10
brain 10
will 10
whisper 10
him 10
to 10
sleep 10
he 10
think 10
too 10
that 10
as 10
he 10
cut 10
himself 10
off 10
from 10
knowing 10
your 10
mind 10
there 10
can 10
be 10
no 10
knowledge 10
of 10
him 10
to 10
you 10
there 10
is 10
where 10
he 10
fail 10
that 10
terrible 10
baptism 10
of 10
blood 10
which 10
he 10
give 10
you 10
makes 10
you 10
free 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
him 10
in 10
spirit 10
as 10
you 10
have 10
as 10
yet 10
done 10
in 10
your 10
times 10
of 10
freedom 10
when 10
the 10
sun 10
rise 10
and 10
set 10
at 10
such 10
times 10
you 10
go 10
by 10
my 10
volition 10
and 10
not 10
by 10
his 10
and 10
this 10
power 10
to 10
good 10
of 10
you 10
and 10
others 10
you 10
have 10
won 10
from 10
your 10
suffering 10
at 10
his 10
hands 10
this 10
is 10
now 10
all 10
more 10
precious 10
that 10
he 10
know 10
it 10
not 10
and 10
to 10
guard 10
himself 10
have 10
even 10
cut 10
himself 10
off 10
from 10
his 10
knowledge 10
of 10
our 10
where 10
we 10
however 10
are 10
not 10
selfish 10
and 10
we 10
believe 10
that 10
god 10
is 10
with 10
us 10
through 10
all 10
this 10
blackness 10
and 10
these 10
many 10
dark 10
hours 10
we 10
shall 10
follow 10
him 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
flinch 10
even 10
if 10
we 10
peril 10
ourselves 10
that 10
we 10
become 10
like 10
him 10
friend 10
john 10
this 10
has 10
been 10
a 10
great 10
hour 10
and 10
it 10
have 10
done 10
much 10
to 10
advance 10
us 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
you 10
must 10
be 10
scribe 10
and 10
write 10
him 10
all 10
down 10
so 10
that 10
when 10
the 10
others 10
return 10
from 10
their 10
work 10
you 10
can 10
give 10
it 10
to 10
them 10
then 10
they 10
shall 10
know 10
as 10
we 10
do 10
and 10
so 10
i 10
have 10
written 10
it 10
whilst 10
we 10
wait 10
their 10
return 10
and 10
mrs 10
harker 10
has 10

in 10
the 10
train 10
from 10
varna 10
to 10
galatz 10
last 10
night 10
we 10
all 10
assembled 10
a 10
little 10
before 10
the 10
time 10
of 10
sunset 10
each 10
of 10
us 10
had 10
done 10
his 10
work 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
he 10
could 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
thought 10
and 10
endeavor 10
and 10
opportunity 10
go 10
we 10
are 10
prepared 10
for 10
the 10
whole 10
of 10
our 10
journey 10
and 10
for 10
our 10
work 10
when 10
we 10
get 10
to 10
galatz 10
when 10
the 10
usual 10
time 10
came 10
round 10
mrs 10
harker 10
prepared 10
herself 10
for 10
her 10
hypnotic 10
effort 10
and 10
after 10
a 10
longer 10
and 10
more 10
serious 10
effort 10
on 10
the 10
part 10
of 10
van 10
helsing 10
than 10
has 10
been 10
usually 10
necessary 10
she 10
sank 10
into 10
the 10
trance 10
usually 10
she 10
speaks 10
on 10
a 10
hint 10
but 10
this 10
time 10
the 10
professor 10
had 10
to 10
ask 10
her 10
questions 10
and 10
to 10
ask 10
them 10
pretty 10
resolutely 10
before 10
we 10
could 10
learn 10
anything 10
at 10
last 10
her 10
answer 10
came 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
nothing 10
we 10
are 10
still 10
there 10
are 10
no 10
waves 10
lapping 10
but 10
only 10
a 10
steady 10
swirl 10
of 10
water 10
softly 10
running 10
against 10
the 10
hawser 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
mens 10
voices 10
calling 10
near 10
and 10
far 10
and 10
the 10
roll 10
and 10
creak 10
of 10
oars 10
in 10
the 10
rowlocks 10
a 10
gun 10
is 10
fired 10
somewhere 10
the 10
echo 10
of 10
it 10
seems 10
far 10
away 10
there 10
is 10
tramping 10
of 10
feet 10
overhead 10
and 10
ropes 10
and 10
chains 10
are 10
dragged 10
along 10
what 10
is 10
this 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
gleam 10
of 10
light 10
i 10
can 10
feel 10
the 10
air 10
blowing 10
upon 10
me 10
here 10
she 10
stopped 10
she 10
had 10
risen 10
as 10
if 10
impulsively 10
from 10
where 10
she 10
lay 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
and 10
raised 10
both 10
her 10
hands 10
palms 10
upwards 10
as 10
if 10
lifting 10
a 10
weight 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
each 10
other 10
with 10
understanding 10
quincey 10
raised 10
his 10
eyebrows 10
slightly 10
and 10
looked 10
at 10
her 10
intently 10
whilst 10
harkers 10
hand 10
instinctively 10
closed 10
round 10
the 10
hilt 10
of 10
his 10
kukri 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
long 10
pause 10
we 10
all 10
knew 10
that 10
the 10
time 10
when 10
she 10
could 10
speak 10
was 10
passing 10
but 10
we 10
felt 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
useless 10
to 10
say 10
anything 10
suddenly 10
she 10
sat 10
up 10
and 10
as 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
said 10
sweetly 10
would 10
none 10
of 10
you 10
like 10
a 10
cup 10
of 10
tea 10
you 10
must 10
all 10
be 10
so 10
tired 10
we 10
could 10
only 10
make 10
her 10
happy 10
and 10
so 10
acqueisced 10
she 10
bustled 10
off 10
to 10
get 10
tea 10
when 10
she 10
had 10
gone 10
van 10
helsing 10
said 10
you 10
see 10
my 10
friends 10
he 10
is 10
close 10
to 10
land 10
he 10
has 10
left 10
his 10
earth 10
chest 10
but 10
he 10
has 10
yet 10
to 10
get 10
on 10
shore 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
he 10
may 10
lie 10
hidden 10
somewhere 10
but 10
if 10
he 10
be 10
not 10
carried 10
on 10
shore 10
or 10
if 10
the 10
ship 10
do 10
not 10
touch 10
it 10
he 10
cannot 10
achieve 10
the 10
land 10
in 10
such 10
case 10
he 10
can 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
change 10
his 10
form 10
and 10
jump 10
or 10
fly 10
on 10
shore 10
then 10
unless 10
he 10
be 10
carried 10
he 10
cannot 10
escape 10
and 10
if 10
he 10
be 10
carried 10
then 10
the 10
customs 10
men 10
may 10
discover 10
what 10
the 10
box 10
contain 10
thus 10
in 10
fine 10
if 10
he 10
escape 10
not 10
on 10
shore 10
tonight 10
or 10
before 10
dawn 10
there 10
will 10
be 10
the 10
whole 10
day 10
lost 10
to 10
him 10
we 10
may 10
then 10
arrive 10
in 10
time 10
for 10
if 10
he 10
escape 10
not 10
at 10
night 10
we 10
shall 10
come 10
on 10
him 10
in 10
daytime 10
boxed 10
up 10
and 10
at 10
our 10
mercy 10
for 10
he 10
dare 10
not 10
be 10
his 10
true 10
self 10
awake 10
and 10
visible 10
lest 10
he 10
be 10
discovered 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
more 10
to 10
be 10
said 10
so 10
we 10
waited 10
in 10
patience 10
until 10
the 10
dawn 10
at 10
which 10
time 10
we 10
might 10
learn 10
more 10
from 10
mrs 10
harker 10
early 10
this 10
morning 10
we 10
listened 10
with 10
breathless 10
anxiety 10
for 10
her 10
response 10
in 10
her 10
trance 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
stage 10
was 10
even 10
longer 10
in 10
coming 10
than 10
before 10
and 10
when 10
it 10
came 10
the 10
time 10
remaining 10
until 10
full 10
sunrise 10
was 10
so 10
short 10
that 10
we 10
began 10
to 10
despair 10
van 10
helsing 10
seemed 10
to 10
throw 10
his 10
whole 10
soul 10
into 10
the 10
effort 10
at 10
last 10
in 10
obedience 10
to 10
his 10
will 10
she 10
made 10
reply 10
all 10
is 10
dark 10
i 10
hear 10
lapping 10
water 10
level 10
with 10
me 10
and 10
some 10
creaking 10
as 10
of 10
wood 10
on 10
wood 10
she 10
paused 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
sun 10
shot 10
up 10
we 10
must 10
wait 10
till 10
tonight 10
and 10
so 10
it 10
is 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
travelling 10
towards 10
galatz 10
in 10
an 10
agony 10
of 10
expectation 10
we 10
are 10
due 10
to 10
arrive 10
between 10
two 10
and 10
three 10
in 10
the 10
morning 10
but 10
already 10
at 10
bucharest 10
we 10
are 10
three 10
hours 10
late 10
so 10
we 10
cannot 10
possibly 10
get 10
in 10
till 10
well 10
after 10
sunup 10
thus 10
we 10
shall 10
have 10
two 10
more 10
hypnotic 10
messages 10
from 10
mrs 10
harker 10
either 10
or 10
both 10
may 10
possibly 10
throw 10
more 10
light 10
on 10
what 10
is 10
happening 10
latersunset 10
has 10
come 10
and 10
gone 10
fortunately 10
it 10
came 10
at 10
a 10
time 10
when 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
distraction 10
for 10
had 10
it 10
occurred 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
at 10
a 10
station 10
we 10
might 10
not 10
have 10
secured 10
the 10
necessary 10
calm 10
and 10
isolation 10
mrs 10
harker 10
yielded 10
to 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
influence 10
even 10
less 10
readily 10
than 10
this 10
morning 10
i 10
am 10
in 10
fear 10
that 10
her 10
power 10
of 10
reading 10
the 10
counts 10
sensations 10
may 10
die 10
away 10
just 10
when 10
we 10
want 10
it 10
most 10
it 10
seems 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
her 10
imagination 10
is 10
beginning 10
to 10
work 10
whilst 10
she 10
has 10
been 10
in 10
the 10
trance 10
hitherto 10
she 10
has 10
confined 10
herself 10
to 10
the 10
simplest 10
of 10
facts 10
if 10
this 10
goes 10
on 10
it 10
may 10
ultimately 10
mislead 10
us 10
if 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
the 10
counts 10
power 10
over 10
her 10
would 10
die 10
away 10
equally 10
with 10
her 10
power 10
of 10
knowledge 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
a 10
happy 10
thought 10
but 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
that 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
so 10
when 10
she 10
did 10
speak 10
her 10
words 10
were 10
enigmatical 10
something 10
is 10
going 10
out 10
i 10
can 10
feel 10
it 10
pass 10
me 10
like 10
a 10
cold 10
wind 10
i 10
can 10
hear 10
far 10
off 10
confused 10
sounds 10
as 10
of 10
men 10
talking 10
in 10
strange 10
tongues 10
fierce 10
falling 10
water 10
and 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
she 10
stopped 10
and 10
a 10
shudder 10
ran 10
through 10
her 10
increasing 10
in 10
intensity 10
for 10
a 10
few 10
seconds 10
till 10
at 10
the 10
end 10
she 10
shook 10
as 10
though 10
in 10
a 10
palsy 10
she 10
said 10
no 10
more 10
even 10
in 10
answer 10
to 10
the 10
professors 10
imperative 10
questioning 10
when 10
she 10
woke 10
from 10
the 10
trance 10
she 10
was 10
cold 10
and 10
exhausted 10
and 10
languid 10
but 10
her 10
mind 10
was 10
all 10
alert 10
she 10
could 10
not 10
remember 10
anything 10
but 10
asked 10
what 10
she 10
had 10
said 10
when 10
she 10
was 10
told 10
she 10
pondered 10
over 10
it 10
deeply 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
time 10
and 10
in 10
silence 10
october 10
amwe 10
are 10
near 10
galatz 10
now 10
and 10
i 10
may 10
not 10
have 10
time 10
to 10
write 10
later 10
sunrise 10
this 10
morning 10
was 10
anxiously 10
looked 10
for 10
by 10
us 10
all 10
knowing 10
of 10
the 10
increasing 10
difficulty 10
of 10
procuring 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
trance 10
van 10
helsing 10
began 10
his 10
passes 10
earlier 10
than 10
usual 10
they 10
produced 10
no 10
effect 10
however 10
until 10
the 10
regular 10
time 10
when 10
she 10
yielded 10
with 10
a 10
still 10
greater 10
difficulty 10
only 10
a 10
minute 10
before 10
the 10
sun 10
rose 10
the 10
professor 10
lost 10
no 10
time 10
in 10
his 10
questioning 10
her 10
answer 10
came 10
with 10
equal 10
quickness 10
all 10
is 10
dark 10
i 10
hear 10
water 10
swirling 10
by 10
level 10
with 10
my 10
ears 10
and 10
the 10
creaking 10
of 10
wood 10
on 10
wood 10
cattle 10
low 10
far 10
off 10
there 10
is 10
another 10
sound 10
a 10
queer 10
one 10
like 10
she 10
stopped 10
and 10
grew 10
white 10
and 10
whiter 10
still 10
go 10
on 10
go 10
on 10
speak 10
i 10
command 10
you 10
said 10
van 10
helsing 10
in 10
an 10
agonized 10
voice 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
there 10
was 10
despair 10
in 10
his 10
eyes 10
for 10
the 10
risen 10
sun 10
was 10
reddening 10
even 10
mrs 10
harkers 10
pale 10
face 10
she 10
opened 10
her 10
eyes 10
and 10
we 10
all 10
started 10
as 10
she 10
said 10
sweetly 10
and 10
seemingly 10
with 10
the 10
utmost 10
unconcern 10
oh 10
professor 10
why 10
ask 10
me 10
to 10
do 10
what 10
you 10
know 10
i 10
cant 10
i 10
dont 10
remember 10
anything 10
then 10
seeing 10
the 10
look 10
of 10
amazement 10
on 10
our 10
faces 10
she 10
said 10
turning 10
from 10
one 10
to 10
the 10
other 10
with 10
a 10
troubled 10
look 10
what 10
have 10
i 10
said 10
what 10
have 10
i 10
done 10
i 10
know 10
nothing 10
only 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
lying 10
here 10
half 10
asleep 10
and 10
heard 10
you 10
say 10
go 10
on 10
speak 10
i 10
command 10
you 10
it 10
seemed 10
so 10
funny 10
to 10
hear 10
you 10
order 10
me 10
about 10
as 10
if 10
i 10
were 10
a 10
bad 10
child 10
oh 10
madam 10

said 10
sadly 10
it 10
is 10
proof 10
if 10
proof 10
be 10
needed 10
of 10
how 10
i 10
love 10
and 10
honor 10
you 10
when 10
a 10
word 10
for 10
your 10
good 10
spoken 10
more 10
earnest 10
than 10
ever 10
can 10
seem 10
so 10
strange 10
because 10
it 10
is 10
to 10
order 10
her 10
whom 10
i 10
am 10
proud 10
to 10
obey 10
the 10
whistles 10
are 10
sounding 10
we 10
are 10
nearing 10

took 10
me 10
to 10
the 10
hotel 10
where 10
our 10
rooms 10
had 10
been 10
ordered 10
by 10
telegraph 10
he 10
being 10
the 10
one 10
who 10
could 10
best 10
be 10
spared 10
since 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
speak 10
any 10
foreign 10
language 10
the 10
forces 10
were 10
distributed 10
much 10
as 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
at 10
varna 10
except 10
that 10
lord 10
godalming 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
vice 10
consul 10
as 10
his 10

might 10
serve 10

we 10
doing 10
the 10
punctuation 10

with 10
a 10
little 10
bargaining 10
he 10
told 10
us 10
what 10
he 10
knew 10
this 10
turned 10
out 10
to 10
be 10
simple 10
but 10
important 10
he 10
had 10
received 10
a 10
letter 10
from 10
mr 10

him 10

to 10
avoid 10
customs 10
a 10
box 10
which 10
would 10
arrive 10
at 10
galatz 10
in 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
this 10

charge 10
to 10
a 10
certain 10
petrof 10
skinsky 10

slovaks 10
who 10
traded 10
down 10
the 10
river 10

for 10
his 10
work 10
by 10
an 10
english 10

international 10
bank 10
when 10
skinsky 10
had 10
come 10
to 10
him 10
he 10
had 10
taken 10
him 10
to 10
the 10
ship 10
and 10
handed 10
over 10
the 10

so 10
as 10
to 10
save 10
parterage 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
he 10
knew 10
we 10
then 10
sought 10
for 10
skinsky 10
but 10
were 10
unable 10
to 10
find 10
him 10
one 10
of 10
his 10
neighbors 10
who 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
bear 10
him 10
any 10
affection 10
said 10
that 10
he 10
had 10
gone 10
away 10
two 10
days 10
before 10
no 10
one 10
knew 10
whither 10
this 10
was 10
corroborated 10
by 10
his 10
landlord 10
who 10
had 10
received 10
by 10
messenger 10
the 10
key 10
of 10
the 10
house 10
together 10
with 10
the 10

this 10
had 10
been 10
between 10
ten 10
and 10
eleven 10
oclock 10
last 10
night 10
we 10
were 10
at 10
a 10
standstill 10
again 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
talking 10
one 10
came 10
running 10
and 10
breathlessly 10
gasped 10
out 10
that 10
the 10
body 10
of 10
skinsky 10
had 10
been 10
found 10
inside 10
the 10
wall 10
of 10
the 10
churchyard 10
of 10
st 10
peter 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
throat 10
had 10
been 10
torn 10
open 10
as 10
if 10
by 10
some 10
wild 10
animal 10
those 10
we 10
had 10
been 10
speaking 10
with 10
ran 10
off 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
horror 10
the 10
women 10
crying 10
out 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
work 10
of 10
a 10
slovak 10
we 10
hurried 10
away 10
lest 10
we 10
should 10
have 10
been 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
drawn 10
into 10
the 10
affair 10
and 10
so 10
detained 10
as 10
we 10
came 10
home 10
we 10
could 10
arrive 10
at 10
no 10
definite 10
conclusion 10
we 10
were 10
all 10
convinced 10
that 10
the 10
box 10
was 10
on 10
its 10
way 10
by 10
water 10
to 10
somewhere 10
but 10
where 10
that 10
might 10
be 10
we 10
would 10
have 10
to 10
discover 10
with 10
heavy 10
hearts 10
we 10
came 10
home 10
to 10
the 10
hotel 10
to 10
mina 10
when 10
we 10
met 10
together 10
the 10
first 10
thing 10
was 10
to 10
consult 10
as 10
to 10
taking 10
mina 10
again 10
into 10
our 10
confidence 10
things 10
are 10
getting 10
desperate 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
at 10
least 10
a 10
chance 10
though 10
a 10
hazardous 10
one 10
as 10
a 10
preliminary 10
step 10
i 10
was 10
released 10
from 10
my 10
promise 10
to 10
her 10
mina 10

october 10
eveningthey 10
were 10
so 10
tired 10
and 10
worn 10
out 10
and 10
dispirited 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
nothing 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
till 10
they 10
had 10
some 10
rest 10
so 10
i 10
asked 10
them 10
all 10
to 10
lie 10
down 10
for 10
half 10
an 10
hour 10
whilst 10
i 10
should 10
enter 10
everything 10
up 10
to 10
the 10
moment 10
i 10
feel 10
so 10
grateful 10
to 10
the 10
man 10
who 10
invented 10
the 10
travellers 10
typewriter 10
and 10
to 10
mr 10
morris 10
for 10
getting 10
this 10
one 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
felt 10
quite 10
astray 10
doing 10
the 10
work 10
if 10
i 10
had 10
to 10
write 10
with 10
a 10
pen 10
it 10
is 10
all 10
done 10

what 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
suffered 10
what 10
he 10
must 10
be 10
suffering 10
now 10
he 10
lies 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
hardly 10
seeming 10
to 10
breathe 10
and 10
his 10
whole 10
body 10
appears 10
in 10
collapse 10
his 10
brows 10
are 10
knit 10
his 10
face 10
is 10
drawn 10
with 10
pain 10
poor 10
fellow 10
maybe 10
he 10
is 10
thinking 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
see 10
his 10
face 10
all 10
wrinkled 10
up 10
with 10
the 10
concentration 10
of 10
his 10
thoughts 10
oh 10
if 10
i 10
could 10
only 10
help 10
at 10
all 10
i 10
shall 10
do 10
what 10
i 10
can 10
i 10
have 10
asked 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
he 10
has 10
got 10
me 10
all 10
the 10
papers 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
not 10
yet 10
seen 10
whilst 10
they 10
are 10
resting 10
i 10
shall 10
go 10
over 10
all 10
carefully 10
and 10
perhaps 10
i 10
may 10
arrive 10
at 10
some 10
conclusion 10
i 10
shall 10
try 10
to 10
follow 10
the 10
professors 10
example 10
and 10
think 10
without 10
prejudice 10
on 10
the 10
facts 10
before 10
me 10
i 10
do 10
believe 10
that 10
under 10
gods 10
providence 10
i 10
have 10
made 10
a 10
discovery 10
i 10
shall 10
get 10
the 10
maps 10
and 10
look 10
over 10
them 10
i 10
am 10
more 10
than 10
ever 10
sure 10
that 10
i 10
am 10
right 10
my 10
new 10
conclusion 10
is 10
ready 10
so 10
i 10
shall 10
get 10
our 10
party 10
together 10
and 10
read 10
it 10
they 10
can 10
judge 10
it 10
it 10
is 10
well 10
to 10
be 10
accurate 10
and 10

between 10

doubt 10
as 10
to 10
what 10
might 10
be 10
in 10

would 10
destroy 10

pass 10
z 10
his 10
pursuers 10
might 10
follow 10
this 10
is 10
his 10
highest 10
fear 10
and 10
in 10
order 10
to 10
prevent 10
his 10
being 10
betrayed 10
he 10
has 10
repelled 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
he 10
can 10
even 10
his 10
victim 10
me 10
by 10
railthere 10
is 10
no 10
one 10
in 10
charge 10
of 10
the 10
box 10
it 10
would 10
have 10
to 10
take 10
its 10
chance 10
of 10
being 10
delayed 10
and 10
delay 10
would 10
be 10
fatal 10
with 10
enemies 10
on 10
the 10
track 10
true 10
he 10
might 10
escape 10
at 10
night 10
but 10
what 10
would 10
he 10
be 10
if 10
left 10
in 10
a 10
strange 10
place 10
with 10
no 10
refuge 10
that 10
he 10
could 10
fly 10
to 10
this 10
is 10
not 10
what 10
he 10
intends 10
and 10
he 10
does 10
not 10
mean 10
to 10
risk 10
it 10
by 10
waterhere 10
is 10
the 10
safest 10
way 10
in 10
one 10
respect 10
but 10
with 10
most 10
danger 10
in 10
another 10
on 10
the 10
water 10
he 10
is 10
powerless 10
except 10
at 10
night 10
even 10
then 10
he 10
can 10
only 10
summon 10
fog 10
and 10
storm 10
and 10
snow 10
and 10
his 10
wolves 10
but 10
were 10
he 10
wrecked 10
the 10
living 10
water 10
would 10
engulf 10
him 10
helpless 10
and 10
he 10
would 10
indeed 10
be 10
lost 10
he 10
could 10
have 10
the 10
vessel 10
drive 10
to 10
land 10
but 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
unfriendly 10
land 10
wherein 10
he 10
was 10
not 10
free 10
to 10
move 10
his 10
position 10
would 10
still 10
be 10
desperate 10
we 10
know 10
from 10
the 10
record 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
on 10
the 10
water 10
so 10
what 10
we 10
have 10
to 10
do 10
is 10
to 10
ascertain 10
what 10
water 10
the 10
first 10
thing 10
is 10
to 10
realize 10
exactly 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
done 10
as 10
yet 10
we 10
may 10
then 10
get 10
a 10
light 10
on 10
what 10
his 10
task 10
is 10
to 10
be 10
firstlywe 10
must 10
differentiate 10
between 10
what 10
he 10
did 10
in 10
london 10
as 10
part 10
of 10
his 10
general 10
plan 10
of 10
action 10
when 10
he 10
was 10
pressed 10
for 10
moments 10
and 10
had 10
to 10
arrange 10
as 10
best 10
he 10
could 10
secondly 10
we 10
must 10
see 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
we 10
can 10
surmise 10
it 10
from 10
the 10
facts 10
we 10
know 10
of 10
what 10
he 10
has 10
done 10
here 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
first 10
he 10
evidently 10
intended 10
to 10
arrive 10
at 10
galatz 10
and 10
sent 10
invoice 10
to 10
varna 10
to 10
deceive 10
us 10
lest 10
we 10
should 10
ascertain 10
his 10
means 10
of 10
exit 10
from 10
england 10
his 10
immediate 10
and 10
sole 10
purpose 10
then 10
was 10
to 10
escape 10
the 10
proof 10
of 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
letter 10
of 10
instructions 10
sent 10
ot 10
immanuel 10
hildesheim 10
to 10
clear 10
and 10
take 10
away 10
the 10
box 10
before 10
sunrise 10
there 10
is 10
also 10
the 10
instruction 10
to 10
petrof 10
skinsky 10
these 10
we 10
must 10
only 10
guess 10
at 10
but 10
there 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
some 10
letter 10
or 10
message 10
since 10
skinsky 10
came 10
to 10
hildesheim 10
that 10
so 10
far 10
his 10
plans 10
were 10
successful 10
we 10
know 10
the 10
czarina 10
catherine 10
made 10
a 10
phenomenally 10
quick 10
journey 10
so 10
much 10
so 10
that 10
captain 10
donelsons 10
suspicions 10
were 10
aroused 10
but 10
his 10
superstition 10
united 10
with 10
his 10
canniness 10
played 10
the 10
counts 10
game 10
for 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
ran 10
with 10
his 10
favoring 10
wind 10
through 10
fogs 10
and 10
all 10
till 10
he 10
brought 10
up 10
blindfold 10
at 10
galatz 10
that 10
the 10
counts 10
arrangements 10
were 10
well 10
made 10
has 10
been 10
proved 10
hildesheim 10
cleared 10
the 10
box 10
took 10
it 10
off 10
and 10
gave 10
it 10
to 10
skinsky 10
skinsky 10
took 10
it 10
and 10
here 10
we 10
lose 10
the 10
trail 10
we 10
only 10
know 10
that 10
the 10
box 10
is 10
somewhere 10
on 10
the 10
water 10
moving 10
along 10
the 10
customs 10
and 10
the 10
octroi 10
if 10
there 10
be 10
any 10
have 10
been 10
avoided 10
now 10
we 10
come 10
to 10
what 10
the 10
count 10
must 10
have 10
done 10
after 10
his 10
arrival 10
on 10
land 10
at 10
galatz 10
the 10
box 10
was 10
given 10
to 10
skinsky 10
before 10
sunrise 10
at 10
sunrise 10
the 10
count 10
could 10
appear 10
in 10
his 10
own 10
form 10
here 10
we 10
ask 10
why 10
skinsky 10
was 10
chosen 10
at 10
all 10
to 10
aid 10
in 10
the 10
work 10
in 10
my 10
husbands 10
diary 10
skinsky 10
is 10
mentioned 10
as 10
dealing 10
with 10
the 10
slovaks 10
who 10
trade 10
down 10
the 10
river 10
to 10
the 10
port 10
and 10
the 10
mans 10
remark 10
that 10
the 10
murder 10
was 10
the 10
work 10
of 10
a 10
slovak 10
showed 10
the 10
general 10
feeling 10
against 10
his 10
class 10
the 10
count 10
wanted 10
isolation 10
my 10
surmise 10
is 10
this 10
that 10
in 10
london 10
the 10
count 10
decided 10
to 10
get 10
back 10
to 10
his 10
castle 10
by 10
water 10
as 10
the 10
most 10
safe 10
and 10
secret 10
way 10
he 10
was 10
brought 10
from 10
the 10
castle 10
by 10
szgany 10
and 10
probably 10
they 10
delivered 10
their 10
cargo 10
to 10
slovaks 10
who 10
took 10
the 10
boxes 10
to 10
varna 10
for 10
there 10
they 10
were 10
shipped 10
to 10
london 10
thus 10
the 10
count 10
had 10
knowledge 10
of 10
the 10
persons 10
who 10
could 10
arrange 10
this 10
service 10
when 10
the 10
box 10
was 10
on 10
land 10
before 10
sunrise 10
or 10
after 10
sunset 10
he 10
came 10
out 10
from 10
his 10
box 10
met 10
skinsky 10
and 10
instructed 10
him 10
what 10
to 10
do 10
as 10
to 10
arranging 10
the 10
carriage 10
of 10
the 10
box 10
up 10
some 10
river 10
when 10
this 10
was 10
done 10
and 10
he 10
knew 10
that 10
all 10
was 10
in 10
train 10
he 10
blotted 10
out 10
his 10
traces 10
as 10
he 10
thought 10
by 10
murdering 10
his 10
agent 10
i 10
have 10
examined 10
the 10
map 10
and 10
find 10
that 10
the 10
river 10
most 10
suitable 10
for 10
the 10
slovaks 10
to 10
have 10
ascended 10
is 10
either 10
the 10
pruth 10
or 10
the 10
sereth 10
i 10
read 10
in 10
the 10
typescript 10
that 10
in 10
my 10
trance 10
i 10
heard 10
cows 10
low 10
and 10
water 10
swirling 10
level 10
with 10
my 10
ears 10
and 10
the 10
creaking 10
of 10
wood 10
the 10
count 10
in 10
his 10
box 10
then 10
was 10
on 10
a 10
river 10
in 10
an 10
open 10
boat 10
propelled 10
probably 10
either 10
by 10
oars 10
or 10
poles 10
for 10
the 10
banks 10
are 10
near 10
and 10
it 10
is 10
working 10
against 10
stream 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
no 10
such 10
if 10
floating 10
down 10
stream 10
of 10
course 10
it 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
either 10
the 10
sereth 10
or 10
the 10
pruth 10
but 10
we 10
may 10
possibly 10
investigate 10
further 10
now 10
of 10
these 10
two 10
the 10
pruth 10
is 10
the 10
more 10
easily 10
navigated 10
but 10
the 10
sereth 10
is 10
at 10
fundu 10
joined 10
by 10
the 10
bistritza 10
which 10
runs 10
up 10
round 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
the 10
loop 10
it 10
makes 10
is 10
manifestly 10
as 10
close 10
to 10
draculas 10
castle 10
as 10
can 10
be 10
got 10

when 10
i 10
had 10
done 10
reading 10
jonathan 10
took 10
me 10
in 10
his 10
arms 10
and 10
kissed 10
me 10
the 10
others 10

we 10
were 10
blinded 10
now 10
we 10
are 10
on 10
the 10
track 10
once 10
again 10
and 10
this 10
time 10
we 10
may 10
succeed 10
our 10
enemy 10
is 10
at 10
his 10
most 10
helpless 10

if 10

by 10
day 10
on 10

our 10
task 10
will 10
be 10
over 10
he 10
has 10
a 10
start 10
but 10
he 10
is 10
powerless 10
to 10
hasten 10
as 10
he 10
may 10
not 10
leave 10
this 10
box 10
lest 10
those 10
who 10
carry 10
him 10
may 10
suspect 10
for 10
them 10
to 10

would 10
be 10
to 10
prompt 10
them 10
to 10
throw 10
him 10
in 10
the 10

all 10
shall 10
do 10
i 10
shall 10

good 10
said 10
the 10
professor 10
both 10
good 10
but 10
neither 10
must 10
go 10
alone 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
force 10
to 10
overcome 10
force 10
if 10
need 10
be 10
the 10
slovak 10
is 10
strong 10
and 10
rough 10
and 10
he 10
carries 10
rude 10
arms 10

for 10
amongst 10

mr 10
morris 10
i 10
have 10
brought 10
some 10
winchesters 10
they 10
are 10
pretty 10
handy 10
in 10
a 10
crowd 10
and 10
there 10
may 10
be 10
wolves 10
the 10
count 10
if 10
you 10
remember 10
took 10
some 10
other 10
precautions 10
he 10
made 10
some 10
requisitions 10
on 10
others 10
that 10
mrs 10
harker 10
could 10
not 10
quite 10
hear 10
or 10
understand 10
we 10
must 10
be 10
ready 10
at 10
all 10
points 10
dr 10
seward 10
said 10
i 10
think 10
i 10
had 10
better 10
go 10
with 10
quincey 10
we 10
have 10
been 10
accustomed 10
to 10
hunt 10
together 10
and 10
we 10
two 10
well 10
armed 10
will 10
be 10
a 10
match 10
for 10
whatever 10
may 10
come 10
along 10
you 10
must 10
not 10
be 10
alone 10
art 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
necessary 10
to 10
fight 10
the 10
slovaks 10
and 10
a 10
chance 10
thrust 10
for 10
i 10
dont 10
suppose 10
these 10
fellows 10
carry 10
guns 10
would 10
undo 10
all 10
our 10
plans 10
there 10
must 10
be 10
no 10
chances 10
this 10
time 10
we 10
shall 10
not 10
rest 10
until 10
the 10
counts 10
head 10
and 10
body 10
have 10
been 10
separated 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
sure 10
that 10
he 10
cannot 10
reincarnate 10
he 10
looked 10
at 10
jonathan 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
and 10
jonathan 10
looked 10
at 10
me 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
the 10
poor 10
dear 10
was 10
torn 10
about 10
in 10
his 10
mind 10
of 10
course 10
he 10
wanted 10
to 10
be 10
with 10
me 10
but 10
then 10
the 10
boat 10
service 10
would 10
most 10
likely 10
be 10
the 10
one 10
which 10
would 10
destroy 10
the 10
the 10
vampire 10
why 10
did 10
i 10
hesitate 10
to 10
write 10
the 10
word 10
he 10
was 10
silent 10
awhile 10
and 10
during 10
his 10
silence 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
spoke 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
this 10
is 10
to 10
you 10
for 10
twice 10
reasons 10
first 10
because 10
you 10
are 10
young 10
and 10
brave 10
and 10
can 10
fight 10
and 10
all 10
energies 10
may 10
be 10
needed 10
at 10
the 10
last 10
and 10
again 10
that 10
it 10
is 10
your 10
right 10
to 10
destroy 10
him 10
that 10
which 10
has 10
wrought 10
such 10
woe 10
to 10
you 10
and 10
yours 10
be 10
not 10
afraid 10
for 10
madam 10
mina 10
she 10
will 10
be 10
my 10
care 10
if 10
i 10
may 10
i 10
am 10
old 10
my 10
legs 10
are 10
not 10
so 10
quick 10
to 10
run 10
as 10
once 10
and 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
used 10
to 10
ride 10
so 10
long 10
or 10
to 10
pursue 10
as 10
need 10
be 10
or 10
to 10
fight 10
with 10
lethal 10
weapons 10
but 10
i 10
can 10
be 10
of 10
other 10
service 10
i 10
can 10
fight 10
in 10
other 10
way 10
and 10
i 10
can 10
die 10
if 10
need 10
be 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
younger 10
men 10
now 10
let 10
me 10
say 10
that 10
what 10
i 10
would 10
is 10
this 10
while 10
you 10
my 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
friend 10
jonathan 10
go 10
in 10
your 10
so 10
swift 10
little 10
steamboat 10
up 10
the 10
river 10
and 10
whilst 10
john 10
and 10
quincey 10
guard 10
the 10
bank 10
where 10
perchance 10
he 10
might 10
be 10
landed 10
i 10
will 10
take 10
madam 10
mina 10
right 10
into 10
the 10
heart 10
of 10
the 10
enemys 10
country 10
whilst 10
the 10
old 10
fox 10
is 10
tied 10
in 10
his 10
box 10
floating 10
on 10
the 10
running 10
stream 10
whence 10
he 10
cannot 10
escape 10
to 10
land 10
where 10
he 10
dares 10
not 10
raise 10
the 10
lid 10
of 10
his 10
coffin 10
box 10
lest 10
his 10
slovak 10
carriers 10
should 10
in 10
fear 10
leave 10
him 10
to 10
perish 10
we 10
shall 10
go 10
in 10
the 10
track 10
where 10
jonathan 10
went 10
from 10
bistritz 10
over 10
the 10
borgo 10
and 10
find 10
our 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
castle 10
of 10
dracula 10
here 10
madam 10
minas 10
hypnotic 10
power 10
will 10
surely 10
help 10
and 10
we 10
shall 10
find 10
our 10
way 10
all 10
dark 10
and 10
unknown 10
otherwise 10
after 10
the 10
first 10
sunrise 10
when 10
we 10
are 10
near 10
that 10
fateful 10
place 10
there 10
is 10
much 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
and 10
other 10
places 10
to 10
be 10
made 10
sanctify 10
so 10
that 10
that 10
nest 10
of 10
vipers 10
be 10
obliterated 10
here 10
jonathan 10
interrupted 10
him 10
hotly 10
do 10
you 10
mean 10
to 10
say 10
professor 10
van 10
helsing 10
that 10
you 10
would 10
bring 10
mina 10
in 10
her 10
sad 10
case 10
and 10
tainted 10
as 10
she 10
is 10
with 10
that 10
devils 10
illness 10
right 10
into 10
the 10
jaws 10
of 10
his 10
deathtrap 10
not 10
for 10
the 10
world 10
not 10
for 10
heaven 10
or 10
hell 10
he 10
became 10
almost 10
speechless 10
for 10
a 10
minute 10
and 10
then 10
went 10
on 10
do 10
you 10
know 10
what 10
the 10
place 10
is 10
have 10
you 10
seen 10
that 10
awful 10
den 10
of 10
hellish 10
infamy 10
with 10
the 10
very 10
moonlight 10
alive 10
with 10
grisly 10
shapes 10
and 10
ever 10
speck 10
of 10
dust 10
that 10
whirls 10
in 10
the 10
wind 10
a 10
devouring 10
monster 10
in 10
embryo 10
have 10
you 10
felt 10
the 10
vampires 10
lips 10
upon 10
your 10
throat 10
here 10
he 10
turned 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
as 10
his 10
eyes 10
lit 10
on 10
my 10
forehead 10
he 10
threw 10
up 10
his 10
arms 10
with 10
a 10
cry 10
oh 10
my 10
god 10
what 10
have 10
we 10
done 10
to 10
have 10
this 10
terror 10
upon 10
us 10
and 10
he 10
sank 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
sofa 10
in 10
a 10
collapse 10
of 10
misery 10
the 10
professors 10
voice 10
as 10
he 10
spoke 10
in 10
clear 10
sweet 10
tones 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
vibrate 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
calmed 10
us 10
all 10
oh 10
my 10
friend 10
it 10
is 10
because 10
i 10
would 10
save 10
madam 10
mina 10
from 10
that 10
awful 10
place 10
that 10
i 10
would 10
go 10
god 10
forbid 10
that 10
i 10
should 10
take 10
her 10
into 10
that 10
place 10
there 10
is 10
work 10
wild 10
work 10
to 10
be 10
done 10
before 10
that 10
place 10
can 10
be 10
purify 10
remember 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
terrible 10
straits 10
if 10
the 10
count 10
escape 10
us 10
this 10
time 10
and 10
he 10
is 10
strong 10
and 10
subtle 10
and 10
cunning 10
he 10
may 10
choose 10
to 10
sleep 10
him 10
for 10
a 10
century 10
and 10
then 10
in 10
time 10
our 10
dear 10
one 10
he 10
took 10
my 10
hand 10
would 10
come 10
to 10
him 10
to 10
keep 10
him 10
company 10
and 10
would 10
be 10
as 10
those 10
others 10
that 10
you 10
jonathan 10
saw 10
you 10
have 10
told 10
us 10
of 10
their 10
gloating 10
lips 10
you 10
heard 10
their 10
ribald 10
laugh 10
as 10
they 10
clutched 10
the 10
moving 10
bag 10
that 10
the 10
count 10
threw 10
to 10
them 10
you 10
shudder 10
and 10
well 10
may 10
it 10
be 10
forgive 10
me 10
that 10
i 10
make 10
you 10
so 10
much 10
pain 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
necessary 10
my 10
friend 10
is 10
it 10
not 10
a 10
dire 10
need 10
for 10
that 10
which 10
i 10
am 10
giving 10
possibly 10
my 10
life 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
that 10
any 10
one 10
went 10
into 10
that 10
place 10
to 10
stay 10
it 10
is 10
i 10
who 10
would 10
have 10
to 10
go 10
to 10
keep 10
them 10
company 10
do 10
as 10
you 10
will 10
said 10
jonathan 10
with 10
a 10
sob 10
that 10
shook 10
him 10
all 10
over 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
god 10
lateroh 10
it 10
did 10
me 10
good 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
way 10
that 10
these 10
brave 10
men 10
worked 10
how 10
can 10
women 10
help 10
loving 10
men 10
when 10
they 10
are 10
so 10
earnest 10
and 10
so 10
true 10
and 10
so 10
brave 10
and 10
too 10
it 10
made 10
me 10
think 10
of 10
the 10
wonderful 10
power 10
of 10
money 10
what 10
can 10
it 10
not 10
do 10
when 10
basely 10
used 10
i 10
felt 10
so 10
thankful 10
that 10
lord 10
godalming 10

also 10
has 10
plenty 10
of 10
money 10
are 10
willing 10
to 10
spend 10
it 10
so 10
freely 10
for 10
if 10
they 10
did 10
not 10
our 10
little 10

we 10
finally 10
decided 10
that 10

correct 10

be 10

it 10
that 10
somewhere 10
about 10
the 10
th 10
degree 10

in 10
running 10
at 10
good 10
speed 10
up 10
the 10
river 10
at 10
night 10
there 10
is 10
plenty 10
of 10
water 10
and 10
the 10
banks 10
are 10
wide 10
enough 10
apart 10
to 10
make 10

even 10
in 10

tells 10
me 10
to 10
sleep 10
for 10

i 10
cannot 10

i 10
with 10
the 10
terrible 10
danger 10
hanging 10
over 10
my 10
darling 10
and 10
her 10
going 10
out 10
into 10
that 10
awful 10
place 10
my 10
only 10
comfort 10
is 10
that 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
the 10
hands 10
of 10
god 10
only 10
for 10
that 10
faith 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
easier 10
to 10
die 10
than 10
to 10

off 10

their 10
long 10
ride 10
before 10
we 10
started 10
they 10
are 10
to 10
keep 10
up 10
the 10
right 10
bank 10
far 10
enough 10
off 10
to 10
get 10
on 10
higher 10
lands 10
where 10
they 10
can 10
see 10
a 10
good 10
stretch 10
of 10
river 10
and 10
avoid 10
the 10
following 10
of 10
its 10

they 10
have 10
for 10
the 10

two 10
men 10
to 10
ride 10

lead 10
their 10
spare 10
horses 10
four 10
in 10
all 10
so 10
as 10
not 10
to 10
excite 10
curiosity 10
when 10
they 10
dismiss 10
the 10
men 10
which 10
shall 10
be 10
shortly 10
they 10
shall 10
themselves 10
look 10
after 10
the 10
horses 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
necessary 10
for 10
us 10
to 10
join 10

so 10
they 10
can 10

easily 10
adapted 10

kind 10
we 10
seek 10
we 10
have 10
now 10
passed 10
into 10
the 10
bistritza 10
and 10
if 10
we 10
are 10
wrong 10
in 10
our 10
surmise 10
our 10
chance 10
is 10
gone 10
we 10
have 10
overhauled 10
every 10
boat 10
big 10
and 10
little 10
early 10
this 10
morning 10
one 10
crew 10
took 10
us 10
for 10
a 10
government 10
boat 10
and 10
treated 10
us 10
accordingly 10
we 10
saw 10
in 10
this 10
a 10
way 10
of 10
smoothing 10
matters 10
so 10
at 10
fundu 10
where 10
the 10
bistritza 10
runs 10
into 10
the 10
sereth 10
we 10
got 10
a 10
roumanian 10
flag 10
which 10
we 10
now 10
fly 10
conspicuously 10
with 10
every 10
boat 10
which 10
we 10
have 10
overhauled 10
since 10
then 10
this 10
trick 10
has 10
succeeded 10
we 10
have 10
had 10
every 10
deference 10
shown 10
to 10
us 10
and 10
not 10
once 10
any 10
objection 10
to 10
whatever 10
we 10
chose 10
to 10
ask 10
or 10
do 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
slovaks 10
tell 10
us 10
that 10
a 10
big 10
boat 10
passed 10
them 10
going 10
at 10
more 10
than 10
usual 10
speed 10
as 10
she 10
had 10
a 10
double 10
crew 10
on 10
board 10
this 10
was 10
before 10
they 10
came 10
to 10
fundu 10
so 10
they 10
could 10
not 10
tell 10
us 10
whether 10
the 10
boat 10
turned 10
into 10
the 10
bistritza 10
or 10
continued 10
on 10
up 10
the 10
sereth 10
at 10
fundu 10
we 10
could 10
not 10
hear 10
of 10
any 10
such 10
boat 10
so 10
she 10
must 10
have 10
passed 10
there 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
i 10
am 10
feeling 10
very 10
sleepy 10
the 10
cold 10
is 10
perhaps 10
beginning 10
to 10
tell 10
upon 10
me 10
and 10
nature 10
must 10
have 10
rest 10
some 10
time 10

insists 10
that 10

shall 10
keep 10

november 10
morningit 10
is 10
broad 10
daylight 10
that 10
good 10
fellow 10
would 10
not 10
wake 10
me 10
he 10
says 10
it 10
would 10
have 10
been 10
a 10
sin 10
to 10
for 10
i 10
slept 10
peacefully 10
and 10
was 10
forgetting 10
my 10
trouble 10
it 10
seems 10
brutally 10
selfish 10
to 10
me 10
to 10
have 10
slept 10
so 10
long 10
and 10
let 10
him 10
watch 10
all 10
night 10
but 10
he 10
was 10
quite 10
right 10
i 10
am 10
a 10
new 10
man 10
this 10
morning 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
sit 10
here 10
and 10
watch 10
him 10
sleeping 10
i 10
can 10
do 10
all 10
that 10
is 10
necessary 10
both 10
as 10
to 10
minding 10
the 10
engine 10
steering 10
and 10
keeping 10
watch 10
i 10
can 10
feel 10
that 10
my 10
strength 10
and 10
energy 10
are 10
coming 10
back 10
to 10
me 10
i 10
wonder 10
where 10
mina 10
is 10
now 10
and 10

they 10
should 10
have 10
got 10
to 10
veresti 10
about 10
noon 10
on 10
wednesday 10
it 10
would 10
take 10
them 10
some 10
time 10
to 10
get 10
the 10
carriage 10
and 10
horses 10
so 10
if 10
they 10
had 10
started 10
and 10
travelled 10
hard 10
they 10
would 10
be 10
about 10
now 10
at 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
god 10
guide 10
and 10
help 10
them 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
to 10
think 10
what 10
may 10
happen 10
if 10
we 10
could 10
only 10
go 10
faster 10
but 10
we 10
cannot 10
the 10
engines 10
are 10
throbbing 10
and 10
doing 10
their 10
utmost 10
i 10
wonder 10
how 10
dr 10
seward 10
and 10
mr 10
morris 10
are 10
getting 10
on 10
there 10
seem 10
to 10
be 10
endless 10
streams 10
running 10
down 10
the 10
mountains 10
into 10
this 10
river 10
but 10
as 10
none 10
of 10
them 10
are 10
very 10
large 10
at 10
present 10
at 10
all 10

though 10
they 10
are 10
doubtless 10
terrible 10
in 10
winter 10
and 10
when 10
the 10
snow 10
melts 10
the 10

may 10
not 10
have 10

we 10
may 10
see 10
them 10

by 10
that 10

we 10
have 10
not 10
overtaken 10

it 10
may 10
be 10

an 10

himself 10

evidently 10
it 10

who 10
put 10
the 10

again 10
so 10
long 10
as 10
she 10
was 10

later 10

buy 10
additional 10

more 10

the 10
country 10
is 10
lovely 10

most 10
interesting 10
if 10
only 10
we 10
were 10
under 10
different 10

how 10
delightful 10
it 10
would 10

all 10

through 10
it 10

what 10
a 10
pleasure 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
to 10
stop 10

see 10
people 10
and 10
learn 10
something 10

or 10
tea 10
and 10
off 10
we 10
go 10
it 10
is 10
a 10
lovely 10
country 10
full 10
of 10
beauties 10
of 10
all 10
imaginable 10
kinds 10
and 10
the 10
people 10
are 10
brave 10
and 10
strong 10
and 10
simple 10
and 10
seem 10
full 10
of 10
nice 10
qualities 10
they 10
are 10
very 10
very 10
superstitious 10
in 10
the 10
first 10
house 10
where 10
we 10
stopped 10
when 10
the 10
woman 10
who 10
served 10
us 10
saw 10
the 10
scar 10
on 10
my 10
forehead 10
she 10
crossed 10
herself 10
and 10
put 10
out 10
two 10
fingers 10
towards 10
me 10
to 10
keep 10
off 10
the 10
evil 10
eye 10
i 10
believe 10
they 10
went 10
to 10
the 10
trouble 10
of 10
putting 10
an 10
extra 10
amount 10
of 10
garlic 10
into 10
our 10
food 10
and 10
i 10
cant 10
abide 10
garlic 10
ever 10
since 10
then 10
i 10
have 10
taken 10
care 10
not 10
to 10
take 10
off 10
my 10
hat 10
or 10
veil 10
and 10
so 10
have 10
escaped 10
their 10
suspicions 10
we 10
are 10
travelling 10
fast 10
and 10
as 10
we 10
have 10
no 10
driver 10
with 10
us 10
to 10
carry 10
tales 10
we 10
go 10
ahead 10
of 10
scandal 10
but 10
i 10
daresay 10
that 10
fear 10
of 10
the 10
evil 10
eye 10
will 10
follow 10
hard 10
behind 10
us 10
all 10
the 10
way 10
the 10
professor 10
seems 10
tireless 10
all 10
day 10
he 10
would 10
not 10
take 10
any 10
rest 10
though 10
he 10
made 10
me 10
sleep 10
for 10
a 10
long 10
spell 10
at 10
sunset 10
time 10
he 10
hypnotized 10
me 10
and 10
he 10
says 10
i 10
answered 10
as 10
usual 10
darkness 10
lapping 10
water 10
and 10
creaking 10
wood 10
so 10
our 10
enemy 10
is 10
still 10
on 10
the 10
river 10
i 10
am 10
afraid 10
to 10
think 10
of 10
jonathan 10
but 10
somehow 10
i 10
have 10
now 10
no 10
fear 10
for 10
him 10
or 10
for 10
myself 10
i 10
write 10
this 10
whilst 10
we 10
wait 10
in 10
a 10
farmhouse 10
for 10
the 10
horses 10
to 10
be 10
ready 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
is 10
sleeping 10
poor 10
dear 10
he 10
looks 10
very 10
tired 10
and 10
old 10
and 10
grey 10
but 10
his 10
mouth 10
is 10
set 10
as 10
firmly 10
as 10
a 10
conquerors 10
even 10
in 10
his 10
sleep 10
he 10
is 10
intense 10
with 10
resolution 10
when 10
we 10
have 10
well 10
started 10
i 10
must 10
make 10
him 10
rest 10
whilst 10
i 10
drive 10
i 10
shall 10
tell 10
him 10
that 10
we 10
have 10
days 10
before 10
us 10
and 10
he 10
must 10
not 10
break 10
down 10
when 10
most 10
of 10
all 10
his 10
strength 10
will 10
be 10
needed 10
all 10
is 10
ready 10
we 10
are 10
off 10
shortly 10
november 10
morningi 10
was 10
successful 10
and 10
we 10
took 10
turns 10
driving 10
all 10
night 10
now 10
the 10
day 10
is 10
on 10
us 10
bright 10
though 10
cold 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
strange 10
heaviness 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
i 10
say 10
heaviness 10
for 10
want 10
of 10
a 10
better 10
word 10
i 10
mean 10
that 10
it 10
oppresses 10
us 10
both 10
it 10
is 10
very 10
cold 10
and 10
only 10
our 10
warm 10
furs 10
keep 10
us 10
comfortable 10
at 10
dawn 10
van 10
helsing 10
hypnotized 10
me 10
he 10
says 10
i 10
answered 10
darkness 10
creaking 10
wood 10
and 10
roaring 10
water 10
so 10
the 10
river 10
is 10
changing 10
as 10
they 10
ascend 10
i 10
do 10
hope 10
that 10
my 10
darling 10
will 10
not 10
run 10
any 10
chance 10
of 10
danger 10
more 10
than 10
need 10
be 10
but 10
we 10
are 10
in 10
gods 10
hands 10
november 10
nightall 10
day 10
long 10
driving 10
the 10
country 10
gets 10
wilder 10
as 10
we 10
go 10
and 10
the 10
great 10
spurs 10
of 10
the 10
carpathians 10
which 10
at 10
veresti 10
seemed 10
so 10
far 10
from 10
us 10
and 10
so 10
low 10
on 10
the 10
horizon 10
now 10
seem 10
to 10
gather 10
round 10
us 10
and 10
tower 10
in 10
front 10
we 10
both 10
seem 10
in 10
good 10
spirits 10
i 10
think 10
we 10
make 10
an 10
effort 10
each 10
to 10
cheer 10
the 10
other 10
in 10
the 10
doing 10
so 10
we 10
cheer 10
ourselves 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
says 10
that 10
by 10
morning 10
we 10
shall 10
reach 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
the 10
houses 10
are 10
very 10
few 10
here 10
now 10
and 10
the 10
professor 10
says 10
that 10
the 10
last 10
horse 10
we 10
got 10
will 10
have 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
with 10
us 10
as 10
we 10
may 10
not 10
be 10
able 10
to 10
change 10
he 10
got 10
two 10
in 10
addition 10
to 10
the 10
two 10
we 10
changed 10
so 10
that 10
now 10
we 10
have 10
a 10
rude 10
fourinhand 10
the 10
dear 10
horses 10
are 10
patient 10
and 10
good 10
and 10
they 10
give 10
us 10
no 10
trouble 10
we 10
are 10
not 10
worried 10
with 10
other 10
travellers 10
and 10
so 10
even 10
i 10
can 10
drive 10
we 10
shall 10
get 10
to 10
the 10
pass 10
in 10
daylight 10
we 10
do 10
not 10
want 10
to 10
arrive 10
before 10
so 10
we 10
take 10
it 10
easy 10
and 10
have 10
each 10
a 10
long 10
rest 10
in 10
turn 10
oh 10
what 10
will 10
tomorrow 10
bring 10
to 10
us 10
we 10
go 10
to 10
seek 10
the 10
place 10
where 10
my 10
poor 10
darling 10
suffered 10
so 10
much 10
god 10
grant 10
that 10
we 10
may 10
be 10
guided 10
aright 10
and 10
that 10
he 10
will 10
deign 10
to 10
watch 10
over 10
my 10
husband 10
and 10
those 10
dear 10
to 10
us 10
both 10
and 10
who 10
are 10
in 10
such 10
deadly 10
peril 10
as 10
for 10
me 10
i 10
am 10
not 10
worthy 10
in 10
his 10
sight 10
alas 10
i 10
am 10
unclean 10
to 10
his 10
eyes 10
and 10
shall 10
be 10
until 10
he 10
may 10
deign 10
to 10
let 10
me 10
stand 10
forth 10
in 10
his 10
sight 10
as 10
one 10
of 10
those 10
who 10

full 10
of 10
snow 10

been 10
so 10
heavy 10
of 10

that 10
she 10
was 10
not 10
like 10

sleeps 10
and 10
sleeps 10
and 10
sleeps 10
she 10
who 10

so 10
alert 10
have 10
done 10
literally 10
nothing 10
all 10
the 10
day 10
she 10
even 10
have 10
lost 10
her 10
appetite 10
she 10
make 10
no 10

something 10
whisper 10
to 10

that 10
all 10

not 10
well 10
however 10
tonight 10
she 10
is 10
more 10
vif 10
her 10
long 10
sleep 10
all 10
day 10
have 10
refresh 10
and 10
restore 10
her 10
for 10
now 10
she 10
is 10
all 10
sweet 10
and 10
bright 10
as 10
ever 10
at 10
sunset 10
i 10
try 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
her 10
but 10
alas 10
with 10
no 10
effect 10
the 10
power 10
has 10
grown 10
less 10
and 10
less 10
with 10
each 10
day 10
and 10
tonight 10

stenography 10
i 10
must 10
in 10
my 10
cumbrous 10
old 10
fashion 10
that 10
so 10
each 10
day 10
of 10
us 10
may 10
not 10
go 10
unrecorded 10
we 10
got 10
to 10
the 10
borgo 10
pass 10
just 10
after 10
sunrise 10
yesterday 10
morning 10
when 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
signs 10
of 10
the 10
dawn 10
i 10
got 10
ready 10
for 10
the 10
hypnotism 10
we 10
stopped 10
our 10
carriage 10
and 10
got 10
down 10
so 10
that 10
there 10
might 10
be 10
no 10
disturbance 10
i 10
made 10
a 10
couch 10
with 10
furs 10
and 10
madam 10
mina 10
lying 10
down 10
yield 10
herself 10
as 10
usual 10
but 10
more 10
slow 10
and 10
more 10
short 10
time 10
than 10
ever 10
to 10
the 10
hypnotic 10
sleep 10
as 10
before 10
came 10
the 10
answer 10
darkness 10
and 10
the 10
swirling 10
of 10
water 10
then 10
she 10
woke 10
bright 10
and 10
radiant 10
and 10
we 10
go 10
on 10
our 10
way 10
and 10
soon 10
reach 10
the 10
pass 10
at 10
this 10
time 10
and 10
place 10
she 10
become 10
all 10
on 10
fire 10
with 10
zeal 10
some 10
new 10
guiding 10
power 10
be 10
in 10
her 10
manifested 10
for 10
she 10
point 10
to 10
a 10
road 10
and 10
say 10
this 10
is 10
the 10
way 10
how 10
know 10
you 10
it 10
i 10
ask 10
of 10
course 10
i 10
know 10
it 10
she 10
answer 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
pause 10
add 10
have 10
not 10
my 10
jonathan 10
travelled 10
it 10
and 10
wrote 10
of 10
his 10
travel 10
at 10
first 10
i 10
think 10
somewhat 10
strange 10
but 10
soon 10
i 10
see 10
that 10
there 10
be 10
only 10
one 10
such 10
byroad 10
it 10
is 10
used 10
but 10
little 10
and 10
very 10
different 10
from 10
the 10
coach 10
road 10
from 10
the 10
bukovina 10
to 10
bistritz 10
which 10
is 10
more 10
wide 10
and 10
hard 10
and 10
more 10
of 10
use 10
so 10
we 10
came 10
down 10
this 10
road 10
when 10
we 10
meet 10
other 10
ways 10
not 10
always 10

at 10
the 10
last 10
turn 10
my 10
brain 10
all 10
yesterday 10
we 10
travel 10
always 10
getting 10
closer 10
to 10
the 10
mountains 10
and 10
moving 10
into 10
a 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
wild 10
and 10
desert 10
land 10
there 10
are 10
great 10
frowning 10
precipices 10
and 10
much 10
falling 10
water 10
and 10
nature 10

her 10
carnival 10
madam 10

hunger 10
and 10
appeased 10
it 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
waken 10
her 10
even 10
for 10
food 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
fear 10
that 10
the 10
fatal 10
spell 10
of 10
the 10
place 10
was 10
upon 10
her 10
tainted 10
as 10
she 10
is 10
with 10
that 10
vampire 10
baptism 10
well 10
said 10
i 10
to 10
myself 10
if 10
it 10
be 10
that 10
she 10
sleep 10
all 10
the 10
day 10
it 10
shall 10
also 10
be 10
that 10
i 10
do 10
not 10
sleep 10
at 10
night 10
as 10
we 10
travel 10
on 10
the 10
rough 10
road 10
for 10
a 10
road 10
of 10
an 10
ancient 10
and 10
imperfect 10
kind 10
there 10
was 10
i 10
held 10
down 10
my 10
head 10
and 10
slept 10
again 10
i 10
waked 10
with 10
a 10
sense 10
of 10
guilt 10
and 10
of 10
time 10
passed 10
and 10
found 10
madam 10
mina 10
still 10
sleeping 10
and 10
the 10
sun 10
low 10
down 10
but 10
all 10
was 10
indeed 10
changed 10
the 10
frowning 10
mountains 10
seemed 10
further 10
away 10
and 10
we 10
were 10
near 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
a 10
steep 10
rising 10
hill 10
on 10
summit 10
of 10
which 10
was 10
such 10
a 10
castle 10
as 10
jonathan 10
tell 10
of 10
in 10
his 10
diary 10
at 10
once 10
i 10
exulted 10
and 10
feared 10
for 10
now 10
for 10
good 10
or 10
ill 10
the 10
end 10
was 10
near 10
i 10
woke 10
madam 10
mina 10
and 10
again 10
tried 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
her 10
but 10
alas 10
unavailing 10
till 10
too 10
late 10
then 10
ere 10
the 10
great 10
dark 10
came 10
upon 10
us 10
for 10
even 10
after 10
down 10
sun 10
the 10
heavens 10
reflected 10
the 10
gone 10
sun 10
on 10
the 10
snow 10
and 10
all 10
was 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
in 10
a 10
great 10
twilight 10
i 10
took 10
out 10
the 10
horses 10
and 10
fed 10
them 10
in 10
what 10
shelter 10
i 10
could 10
then 10
i 10
make 10
a 10
fire 10
and 10
near 10
it 10
i 10
make 10
madam 10
mina 10
now 10
awake 10
and 10
more 10
charming 10
than 10
ever 10
sit 10
comfortable 10
amid 10
her 10
rugs 10
i 10
got 10
ready 10
food 10
but 10
she 10
would 10
not 10
eat 10
simply 10
saying 10
that 10
she 10
had 10
not 10
hunger 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
press 10
her 10
knowing 10
her 10
unavailingness 10
but 10
i 10
myself 10
eat 10
for 10
i 10
must 10
needs 10
now 10
be 10
strong 10
for 10
all 10
then 10
with 10
the 10
fear 10
on 10
me 10
of 10
what 10
might 10
be 10
i 10
drew 10
a 10
ring 10
so 10
big 10
for 10
her 10
comfort 10
round 10
where 10
madam 10
mina 10
sat 10
and 10
over 10
the 10
ring 10
i 10
passed 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
wafer 10
and 10
i 10
broke 10
it 10
fine 10
so 10
that 10
all 10
was 10
well 10
guarded 10
she 10
sat 10
still 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
so 10
still 10
as 10
one 10
dead 10
and 10
she 10
grew 10
whiter 10
and 10
even 10
whiter 10
till 10
the 10
snow 10
was 10
not 10
more 10
pale 10
and 10
no 10
word 10
she 10
said 10
but 10
when 10
i 10
drew 10
near 10
she 10
clung 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
know 10
that 10
the 10
poor 10
soul 10
shook 10
her 10
from 10
head 10
to 10
feet 10
with 10
a 10
tremor 10
that 10
was 10
pain 10
to 10
feel 10
i 10
said 10
to 10
her 10
presently 10
when 10
she 10
had 10
grown 10
more 10
quiet 10
will 10
you 10
not 10
come 10
over 10
to 10
the 10
fire 10
for 10
i 10
wished 10
to 10
make 10
a 10
test 10
of 10
what 10
she 10
could 10
she 10
rose 10
obedient 10
but 10
when 10
she 10
have 10
made 10
a 10
step 10
she 10
stopped 10
and 10
stood 10
as 10
one 10
stricken 10
why 10
not 10
go 10
on 10
i 10
asked 10
she 10
shook 10
her 10
head 10
and 10
coming 10
back 10
sat 10
down 10
in 10
her 10
place 10
then 10
looking 10
at 10
me 10
with 10
open 10
eyes 10
as 10
of 10
one 10
waked 10
from 10
sleep 10
she 10
said 10
simply 10
i 10
cannot 10
and 10
remained 10
silent 10
i 10
rejoiced 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
what 10
she 10
could 10
not 10
none 10
of 10
those 10
that 10
we 10
dreaded 10
could 10
though 10
there 10
might 10
be 10
danger 10
to 10
her 10
body 10
yet 10
her 10
soul 10
was 10
safe 10
presently 10
the 10
horses 10
began 10
to 10
scream 10
and 10
tore 10
at 10
their 10
tethers 10
till 10
i 10
came 10
to 10
them 10
and 10
quieted 10
them 10
when 10
they 10
did 10
feel 10
my 10
hands 10
on 10
them 10
they 10
whinnied 10
low 10
as 10
in 10
joy 10
and 10
licked 10
at 10
my 10
hands 10
and 10
were 10
quiet 10
for 10
a 10
time 10
many 10
times 10
through 10
the 10
night 10
did 10
i 10
come 10
to 10
them 10
till 10
it 10
arrive 10
to 10
the 10
cold 10
hour 10
when 10
all 10
nature 10
is 10
at 10
lowest 10
and 10
every 10
time 10
my 10
coming 10
was 10
with 10
quiet 10
of 10
them 10
in 10
the 10
cold 10
hour 10
the 10
fire 10
began 10
to 10
die 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
about 10
stepping 10
forth 10
to 10
replenish 10
it 10
for 10
now 10
the 10
snow 10
came 10
in 10
flying 10
sweeps 10
and 10
with 10
it 10
a 10
chill 10
mist 10
even 10
in 10
the 10
dark 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
light 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
as 10
there 10
ever 10
is 10
over 10
snow 10
and 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
snow 10
flurries 10
and 10
the 10
wreaths 10
of 10
mist 10
took 10
shape 10
as 10
of 10
women 10
with 10
trailing 10
garments 10
all 10
was 10
in 10
dead 10
grim 10
silence 10
only 10
that 10
the 10
horses 10
whinnied 10
and 10
cowered 10
as 10
if 10
in 10
terror 10
of 10
the 10
worst 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
fear 10
horrible 10
fears 10
but 10
then 10
came 10
to 10
me 10
the 10
sense 10
of 10
safety 10
in 10
that 10
ring 10
wherein 10
i 10
stood 10
i 10
began 10
too 10
to 10
think 10
that 10
my 10
imaginings 10
were 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
and 10
the 10
gloom 10
and 10
the 10
unrest 10
that 10
i 10
have 10
gone 10
through 10
and 10
all 10
the 10
terrible 10
anxiety 10
it 10
was 10
as 10
though 10
my 10
memories 10
of 10
all 10
jonathans 10
horrid 10
experience 10
were 10
befooling 10
me 10
for 10
the 10
snow 10
flakes 10
and 10
the 10
mist 10
began 10
to 10
wheel 10
and 10
circle 10
round 10
till 10
i 10
could 10
get 10
as 10
though 10
a 10
shadowy 10
glimpse 10
of 10
those 10
women 10
that 10
would 10
have 10
kissed 10
him 10
and 10
then 10
the 10
horses 10
cowered 10
lower 10
and 10
lower 10
and 10
moaned 10
in 10
terror 10
as 10
men 10
do 10
in 10
pain 10
even 10
the 10
madness 10
of 10
fright 10
was 10
not 10
to 10
them 10
so 10
that 10
they 10
could 10
break 10
away 10
i 10
feared 10
for 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
when 10
these 10
weird 10
figures 10
drew 10
near 10
and 10
circled 10
round 10
i 10
looked 10
at 10
her 10
but 10
she 10
sat 10
calm 10
and 10
smiled 10
at 10
me 10
when 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
stepped 10
to 10
the 10
fire 10
to 10
replenish 10
it 10
she 10
caught 10
me 10
and 10
held 10
me 10
back 10
and 10
whispered 10
like 10
a 10
voice 10
that 10
one 10
hears 10
in 10
a 10
dream 10
so 10
low 10
it 10
was 10
no 10
no 10
do 10
not 10
go 10
without 10
here 10
you 10
are 10
safe 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
looking 10
in 10
her 10
eyes 10
said 10
but 10
you 10
it 10
is 10
for 10
you 10
that 10
i 10
fear 10
whereat 10
she 10
laughed 10
a 10
laugh 10
low 10
and 10
unreal 10
and 10
said 10
fear 10
for 10
me 10
why 10
fear 10
for 10
me 10
none 10
safer 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
world 10
from 10
them 10
than 10
i 10
am 10
and 10
as 10
i 10
wondered 10
at 10
the 10
meaning 10
of 10
her 10
words 10
a 10
puff 10
of 10
wind 10
made 10
the 10
flame 10
leap 10
up 10
and 10
i 10
see 10
the 10
red 10
scar 10
on 10
her 10
forehead 10
then 10
alas 10
i 10
knew 10
did 10
i 10
not 10
i 10
would 10
soon 10
have 10
learned 10
for 10
the 10
wheeling 10
figures 10
of 10
mist 10
and 10
snow 10
came 10
closer 10
but 10
keeping 10
ever 10
without 10
the 10
holy 10
circle 10
then 10
they 10
began 10
to 10
materialize 10
till 10
if 10
god 10
have 10
not 10
taken 10
away 10
my 10
reason 10
for 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
through 10
my 10
eyes 10
there 10
were 10
before 10
me 10
in 10
actual 10
flesh 10
the 10
same 10
three 10
women 10
that 10
jonathan 10
saw 10
in 10
the 10
room 10
when 10
they 10
would 10
have 10
kissed 10
his 10
throat 10
i 10
knew 10
the 10
swaying 10
round 10
forms 10
the 10
bright 10
hard 10
eyes 10
the 10
white 10
teeth 10
the 10
ruddy 10
color 10
the 10
voluptuous 10
lips 10
they 10
smiled 10
ever 10
at 10
poor 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
and 10
as 10
their 10
laugh 10
came 10
through 10
the 10
silence 10
of 10
the 10
night 10
they 10
twined 10
their 10
arms 10
and 10
pointed 10
to 10
her 10
and 10
said 10
in 10
those 10
so 10
sweet 10
tingling 10
tones 10
that 10
jonathan 10
said 10
were 10
of 10
the 10
intolerable 10
sweetness 10
of 10
the 10
water 10
glasses 10
come 10
sister 10
come 10
to 10
us 10
come 10
in 10
fear 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
my 10
poor 10
madam 10
mina 10
and 10
my 10
heart 10
with 10
gladness 10
leapt 10
like 10
flame 10
for 10
oh 10
the 10
terror 10
in 10
her 10
sweet 10
eyes 10
the 10
repulsion 10
the 10
horror 10
told 10
a 10
story 10
to 10
my 10
heart 10
that 10
was 10
all 10
of 10
hope 10
god 10
be 10
thanked 10
she 10
was 10
not 10
yet 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
seized 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
firewood 10
which 10
was 10
by 10
me 10
and 10
holding 10
out 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
wafer 10
advanced 10
on 10
them 10
towards 10
the 10
fire 10
they 10
drew 10
back 10
before 10
me 10
and 10
laughed 10
their 10
low 10
horrid 10
laugh 10
i 10
fed 10
the 10
fire 10
and 10
feared 10
them 10
not 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
we 10
were 10
safe 10
within 10
the 10
ring 10
which 10
she 10
could 10
not 10
leave 10
no 10
more 10
than 10
they 10
could 10
enter 10
the 10
horses 10
had 10
ceased 10
to 10
moan 10
and 10
lay 10
still 10
on 10
the 10
ground 10
the 10
snow 10
fell 10
on 10
them 10
softly 10
and 10
they 10
grew 10
whiter 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
there 10
was 10
for 10
the 10
poor 10
beasts 10
no 10
more 10
of 10
terror 10
and 10
so 10
we 10
remained 10
till 10
the 10
red 10
of 10
the 10
dawn 10
began 10
to 10
fall 10
through 10
the 10
snow 10
gloom 10
i 10
was 10
desolate 10
and 10
afraid 10
and 10
full 10
of 10
woe 10
and 10
terror 10
but 10
when 10
that 10
beautiful 10
sun 10
began 10
to 10
climb 10
the 10
horizon 10
life 10
was 10
to 10
me 10
again 10
at 10
the 10
first 10
coming 10
of 10
the 10
dawn 10
the 10
horrid 10
figures 10
melted 10
in 10
the 10
whirling 10
mist 10
and 10
snow 10
the 10
wreaths 10
of 10
transparent 10
gloom 10
moved 10
away 10
towards 10
the 10
castle 10
and 10
were 10
lost 10
instinctively 10
with 10
the 10
dawn 10
coming 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
madam 10
mina 10
intending 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
her 10
but 10
she 10
lay 10
in 10
a 10
deep 10
and 10
sudden 10
sleep 10
from 10
which 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
wake 10
her 10
i 10
tried 10
to 10
hypnotize 10
through 10
her 10
sleep 10
but 10
she 10
made 10
no 10
response 10
none 10
at 10
all 10
and 10
the 10
day 10
broke 10
i 10
fear 10
yet 10
to 10
stir 10
i 10
have 10
made 10
my 10
fire 10
and 10

they 10
surrounded 10
it 10
in 10
a 10
cluster 10
and 10
hurried 10
along 10
as 10
though 10
beset 10
the 10
snow 10
is 10
falling 10
lightly 10
and 10
there 10
is 10
a 10
strange 10
excitement 10
in 10
the 10
air 10
it 10
may 10
be 10
our 10
own 10
feelings 10
but 10
the 10
depression 10
is 10
strange 10
far 10
off 10
i 10
hear 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
the 10
snow 10
brings 10
them 10
down 10
from 10
the 10
mountains 10

there 10
are 10
dangers 10
to 10

from 10
all 10
sides 10
the 10

are 10
nearly 10
ready 10
and 10
we 10
are 10
soon 10
off 10
we 10
ride 10
to 10
death 10
of 10
some 10
one 10

though 10
the 10
proving 10
it 10
has 10
been 10
dreadful 10
when 10
i 10
left 10
madam 10
mina 10
sleeping 10
within 10
the 10
holy 10
circle 10
i 10
took 10
my 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
castle 10
the 10
blacksmith 10
hammer 10
which 10
i 10
took 10
in 10
the 10
carriage 10
from 10
veresti 10
was 10
useful 10
though 10
the 10
doors 10
were 10
all 10
open 10
i 10
broke 10
them 10
off 10
the 10
rusty 10
hinges 10
lest 10
some 10
ill 10
intent 10
or 10
ill 10
chance 10
should 10
close 10
them 10
so 10
that 10
being 10
entered 10
i 10
might 10
not 10
get 10
out 10
jonathans 10
bitter 10
experience 10
served 10
me 10
here 10
by 10
memory 10
of 10
his 10
diary 10
i 10
found 10
my 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
old 10
chapel 10
for 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
here 10
my 10
work 10
lay 10
the 10
air 10
was 10
oppressive 10
it 10
seemed 10
as 10
if 10
there 10
was 10
some 10
sulphurous 10
fume 10
which 10
at 10
times 10
made 10
me 10
dizzy 10
either 10
there 10
was 10
a 10
roaring 10
in 10
my 10
ears 10
or 10
i 10
heard 10
afar 10
off 10
the 10
howl 10
of 10
wolves 10
then 10
i 10
bethought 10
me 10
of 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
and 10
i 10
was 10
in 10
terrible 10
plight 10
the 10
dilemma 10
had 10
me 10
between 10
his 10
horns 10
her 10
i 10
had 10
not 10
dare 10
to 10
take 10
into 10
this 10
place 10
but 10
left 10
safe 10
from 10
the 10
vampire 10
in 10
that 10
holy 10
circle 10
and 10
yet 10
even 10
there 10
would 10
be 10
the 10
wolf 10
i 10
resolve 10
me 10
that 10
my 10
work 10
lay 10
here 10
and 10
that 10
as 10
to 10
the 10
wolves 10
we 10
must 10
submit 10
if 10
it 10
were 10
gods 10
will 10
at 10
any 10
rate 10
it 10
was 10
only 10
death 10
and 10
freedom 10
beyond 10
so 10
did 10
i 10
choose 10
for 10
her 10
had 10
it 10
but 10
been 10
for 10
myself 10
the 10
choice 10
had 10
been 10
easy 10
the 10
maw 10
of 10
the 10
wolf 10
were 10
better 10
to 10
rest 10
in 10
than 10
the 10
grave 10
of 10
the 10
vampire 10
so 10
i 10
make 10
my 10
choice 10
to 10
go 10
on 10
with 10
my 10
work 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
there 10
were 10
at 10
least 10
three 10
graves 10
to 10
find 10
graves 10
that 10
are 10
inhabit 10
so 10
i 10
search 10
and 10
search 10
and 10
i 10
find 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
she 10
lay 10
in 10
her 10
vampire 10
sleep 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
life 10
and 10
voluptuous 10
beauty 10
that 10
i 10
shudder 10
as 10
though 10
i 10
have 10
come 10
to 10
do 10
murder 10
ah 10
i 10
doubt 10
not 10
that 10
in 10
the 10
old 10
time 10
when 10
such 10
things 10
were 10
many 10
a 10
man 10
who 10
set 10
forth 10
to 10
do 10
such 10
a 10
task 10
as 10
mine 10
found 10
at 10
the 10
last 10
his 10
heart 10
fail 10
him 10
and 10
then 10
his 10
nerve 10
so 10
he 10
delay 10
and 10
delay 10
and 10
delay 10
till 10
the 10
mere 10
beauty 10
and 10
the 10
fascination 10
of 10
the 10
wanton 10
undead 10
have 10
hypnotize 10
him 10
and 10
he 10
remain 10
on 10
and 10
on 10
till 10
sunset 10
come 10
and 10
the 10
vampire 10
sleep 10
be 10
over 10
then 10
the 10
beautiful 10
eyes 10
of 10
the 10
fair 10
woman 10
open 10
and 10
look 10
love 10
and 10
the 10
voluptuous 10
mouth 10
present 10
to 10
a 10
kiss 10
and 10
the 10
man 10
is 10
weak 10
and 10
there 10
remain 10
one 10
more 10
victim 10
in 10
the 10
vampire 10
fold 10
one 10
more 10
to 10
swell 10
the 10
grim 10
and 10
grisly 10
ranks 10
of 10
the 10
undead 10
there 10
is 10
some 10
fascination 10
surely 10
when 10
i 10
am 10
moved 10
by 10
the 10
mere 10
presence 10
of 10
such 10
an 10
one 10
even 10
lying 10
as 10
she 10
lay 10
in 10
a 10
tomb 10
fretted 10
with 10
age 10
and 10
heavy 10
with 10
the 10
dust 10
of 10
centuries 10
though 10
there 10
be 10
that 10
horrid 10
odor 10
such 10
as 10
the 10
lairs 10
of 10
the 10
count 10
have 10
had 10
yes 10
i 10
was 10
moved 10
i 10
van 10
helsing 10
with 10
all 10
my 10
purpose 10
and 10
with 10
my 10
motive 10
for 10
hate 10
i 10
was 10
moved 10
to 10
a 10
yearning 10
for 10
delay 10
which 10
seemed 10
to 10
paralyze 10
my 10
faculties 10
and 10
to 10
clog 10
my 10
very 10
soul 10
it 10
may 10
have 10
been 10
that 10
the 10
need 10
of 10
natural 10
sleep 10
and 10
the 10
strange 10
oppression 10
of 10
the 10
air 10
were 10
beginning 10
to 10
overcome 10
me 10
certain 10
it 10
was 10
that 10
i 10
was 10
lapsing 10
into 10
sleep 10
the 10
open 10
eyed 10
sleep 10
of 10
one 10
who 10
yields 10
to 10
a 10
sweet 10
fascination 10
when 10
there 10
came 10
through 10
the 10
snow 10
stilled 10
air 10
a 10
long 10
low 10
wail 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
woe 10
and 10
pity 10
that 10
it 10
woke 10
me 10
like 10
the 10
sound 10
of 10
a 10
clarion 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
the 10
voice 10
of 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
that 10
i 10
heard 10
then 10
i 10
braced 10
myself 10
again 10
to 10
my 10
horrid 10
task 10
and 10
found 10
by 10
wrenching 10
away 10
tomb 10
tops 10
one 10
other 10
of 10
the 10
sisters 10
the 10
other 10
dark 10
one 10
i 10
dared 10
not 10
pause 10
to 10
look 10
on 10
her 10
as 10
i 10
had 10
on 10
her 10
sister 10
lest 10
once 10
more 10
i 10
should 10
begin 10
to 10
be 10
enthrall 10
but 10
i 10
go 10
on 10
searching 10
until 10
presently 10
i 10
find 10
in 10
a 10
high 10
great 10
tomb 10
as 10
if 10
made 10
to 10
one 10
much 10
beloved 10
that 10
other 10
fair 10
sister 10
which 10
like 10
jonathan 10
i 10
had 10
seen 10
to 10
gather 10
herself 10
out 10
of 10
the 10
atoms 10
of 10
the 10
mist 10
she 10
was 10
so 10
fair 10
to 10
look 10
on 10
so 10
radiantly 10
beautiful 10
so 10
exquisitely 10
voluptuous 10
that 10
the 10
very 10
instinct 10
of 10
man 10
in 10
me 10
which 10
calls 10
some 10
of 10
my 10
sex 10
to 10
love 10
and 10
to 10
protect 10
one 10
of 10
hers 10
made 10
my 10
head 10
whirl 10
with 10
new 10
emotion 10
but 10
god 10
be 10
thanked 10
that 10
soul 10
wail 10
of 10
my 10
dear 10
madam 10
mina 10
had 10
not 10
died 10
out 10
of 10
my 10
ears 10
and 10
before 10
the 10
spell 10
could 10
be 10
wrought 10
further 10
upon 10
me 10
i 10
had 10
nerved 10
myself 10
to 10
my 10
wild 10
work 10
by 10
this 10
tim 10
e 10
i 10
had 10
searched 10
all 10
the 10
tombs 10
in 10
the 10
chapel 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
i 10
could 10
tell 10
and 10
as 10
there 10
had 10
been 10
only 10
three 10
of 10
these 10
undead 10
phantoms 10
around 10
us 10
in 10
the 10
night 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
that 10
there 10
were 10
no 10
more 10
of 10
active 10
undead 10
existent 10
there 10
was 10
one 10
great 10
tomb 10
more 10
lordly 10
than 10
all 10
the 10
rest 10
huge 10
it 10
was 10
and 10
nobly 10
proportioned 10
on 10
it 10
was 10
but 10
one 10
word 10
dracula 10
this 10
then 10
was 10
the 10
undead 10
home 10
of 10
the 10
king 10
vampire 10
to 10
whom 10
so 10
many 10
more 10
were 10
due 10
its 10
emptiness 10
spoke 10
eloquent 10
to 10
make 10
certain 10
what 10
i 10
knew 10
before 10
i 10
began 10
to 10
restore 10
these 10
women 10
to 10
their 10
dead 10
selves 10
through 10
my 10
awful 10
work 10
i 10
laid 10
in 10
draculas 10
tomb 10
some 10
of 10
the 10
wafer 10
and 10
so 10
banished 10
him 10
from 10
it 10
undead 10
for 10
ever 10
then 10
began 10
my 10
terrible 10
task 10
and 10
i 10
dreaded 10
it 10
had 10
it 10
been 10
but 10
one 10
it 10
had 10
been 10
easy 10
comparative 10
but 10
three 10
to 10
begin 10
twice 10
more 10
after 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
through 10
a 10
deed 10
of 10
horror 10
for 10
it 10
was 10
terrible 10
with 10
the 10
sweet 10
miss 10
lucy 10
what 10
would 10
it 10
not 10
be 10
with 10
these 10
strange 10
ones 10
who 10
had 10
survived 10
through 10
centuries 10
and 10
who 10
had 10
been 10
strenghtened 10
by 10
the 10
passing 10
of 10
the 10
years 10
who 10
would 10
if 10
they 10
could 10
have 10
fought 10
for 10
their 10
foul 10
lives 10
oh 10
my 10
friend 10
john 10
but 10
it 10
was 10
butcher 10
work 10
had 10
i 10
not 10
been 10
nerved 10
by 10
thoughts 10
of 10
other 10
dead 10
and 10
of 10
the 10
living 10
over 10
whom 10
hung 10
such 10
a 10
pall 10
of 10
fear 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
gone 10
on 10
i 10
tremble 10
and 10
tremble 10
even 10
yet 10
though 10
till 10
all 10
was 10
over 10
god 10
be 10
thanked 10
my 10
nerve 10
did 10
stand 10
had 10
i 10
not 10
seen 10
the 10
repose 10
in 10
the 10
first 10
place 10
and 10
the 10
gladness 10
that 10
stole 10
over 10
it 10
just 10
ere 10
the 10
final 10
dissolution 10
came 10
as 10
realization 10
that 10
the 10
soul 10
had 10
been 10
won 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
gone 10
further 10
with 10
my 10
butchery 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
have 10
endured 10
the 10
horrid 10
screeching 10
as 10
the 10
stake 10
drove 10
home 10
the 10
plunging 10
of 10
writhing 10
form 10
and 10
lips 10
of 10
bloody 10
foam 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
fled 10
in 10
terror 10
and 10
left 10
my 10
work 10
undone 10
but 10
it 10
is 10
over 10
and 10
the 10
poor 10
souls 10
i 10
can 10
pity 10
them 10
now 10
and 10
weep 10
as 10
i 10
think 10
of 10
them 10
placid 10
each 10
in 10
her 10
full 10
sleep 10
of 10
death 10
for 10
a 10
short 10
moment 10
ere 10
fading 10
for 10
friend 10
john 10
hardly 10
had 10
my 10
knife 10
severed 10
the 10
head 10
of 10
each 10
before 10
the 10
whole 10
body 10
began 10
to 10
melt 10
away 10
and 10
crumble 10
into 10
its 10
native 10
dust 10
as 10
though 10
the 10
death 10
that 10
should 10
have 10
come 10
centuries 10
agone 10
had 10
at 10
last 10
assert 10
himself 10
and 10
say 10
at 10
once 10
and 10
loud 10
i 10
am 10
here 10
before 10
i 10
left 10
the 10
castle 10
i 10
so 10
fixed 10
its 10
entrances 10
that 10
never 10
more 10
can 10
the 10
count 10
enter 10
there 10
undead 10
when 10
i 10
stepped 10
into 10
the 10
circle 10
where 10
madam 10
mina 10
slept 10
she 10
woke 10
from 10
her 10
sleep 10
and 10
seeing 10
me 10
cried 10
out 10
in 10
pain 10
that 10
i 10
had 10
endured 10
too 10
much 10
come 10
she 10
said 10
come 10
away 10
from 10
this 10
awful 10
place 10
let 10
us 10
go 10
to 10
meet 10
my 10
husband 10
who 10
is 10
i 10
know 10
coming 10
towards 10
us 10
she 10
was 10
looking 10
thin 10
and 10
pale 10
and 10
weak 10
but 10
her 10
eyes 10
were 10
pure 10
and 10
glowed 10
with 10
fervor 10
i 10
was 10
glad 10
to 10
see 10
her 10
paleness 10
and 10
her 10
illness 10
for 10
my 10
mind 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
the 10
fresh 10
horror 10
of 10
that 10
ruddy 10
vampire 10
sleep 10
and 10
so 10
with 10
trust 10
and 10
hope 10
and 10
yet 10
full 10
of 10
fear 10
we 10
go 10
eastward 10
to 10
meet 10
our 10
friends 10
and 10
him 10

journal 10
novemberit 10
was 10
late 10
in 10
the 10
afternoon 10
when 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
i 10
took 10
our 10
way 10
towards 10
the 10
east 10
whence 10
i 10
knew 10
jonathan 10
was 10
coming 10
we 10
did 10
not 10
go 10
fast 10
though 10
the 10
way 10
was 10
steeply 10
downhill 10
for 10
w 10
e 10
had 10
to 10
take 10
heavy 10
rugs 10
and 10
wraps 10
with 10
us 10
we 10
dared 10
not 10
face 10
the 10
possibility 10
of 10
being 10
left 10
without 10
warmth 10
in 10
the 10
cold 10
and 10
the 10
snow 10
we 10
had 10
to 10
take 10
some 10
of 10
our 10
provisions 10
too 10
for 10
we 10
were 10
in 10
a 10
perfect 10
desolation 10
and 10
so 10
far 10
as 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
through 10
the 10
snowfall 10
there 10
was 10
not 10
even 10
the 10
sign 10
of 10
habitation 10
when 10
we 10
had 10
gone 10
about 10
a 10
mile 10
i 10
was 10
tired 10
with 10
the 10
heavy 10
walking 10
and 10
sat 10
down 10
to 10
rest 10
then 10
we 10
looked 10
back 10
and 10
saw 10
where 10
the 10
clear 10
line 10
of 10
draculas 10
castle 10
cut 10
the 10
sky 10
for 10
we 10
were 10
so 10
deep 10
under 10
the 10
hill 10
whereon 10
it 10
was 10
set 10
that 10
the 10
angle 10
of 10
perspective 10
of 10
the 10
carpathian 10
mountains 10
was 10
far 10
below 10
it 10
we 10
saw 10
it 10
in 10
all 10
its 10
grandeur 10
perched 10
a 10
thousand 10
feet 10
on 10
the 10
summit 10
of 10
a 10
sheer 10
precipice 10
and 10
with 10
seemingly 10
a 10
great 10
gap 10
between 10
it 10
and 10
the 10
steep 10
of 10
the 10
adjacent 10
mountain 10
on 10
any 10
side 10
there 10
was 10
something 10
wild 10
and 10
uncanny 10
about 10
the 10
place 10
we 10
could 10
hear 10
the 10
distant 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
they 10
were 10
far 10
off 10
but 10
the 10
sound 10
even 10
though 10
coming 10
muffled 10
through 10
the 10
deadening 10
snowfall 10
was 10
full 10
of 10
terror 10
i 10
knew 10
from 10
the 10
way 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
was 10
searching 10
about 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
trying 10
to 10
seek 10
some 10
strategic 10
point 10
where 10
we 10
would 10
be 10
less 10
exposed 10
in 10
case 10
of 10
attack 10
the 10
rough 10
roadway 10
still 10
led 10
downwards 10
we 10
could 10
trace 10
it 10
through 10
the 10
drifted 10
snow 10
in 10
a 10
little 10
while 10
the 10
professor 10
signalled 10
to 10
me 10
so 10
i 10
got 10
up 10
and 10
joined 10
him 10
he 10
had 10
found 10
a 10
wonderful 10
spot 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
natural 10
hollow 10
in 10
a 10
rock 10
with 10
an 10
entrance 10
like 10
a 10
doorway 10
between 10
two 10
boulders 10
he 10
took 10
me 10
by 10
the 10
hand 10
and 10
drew 10
me 10
in 10
see 10
he 10
said 10
here 10
you 10
will 10
be 10
in 10
shelter 10
and 10
if 10
the 10
wolves 10
do 10
come 10
i 10
can 10
meet 10
them 10
one 10
by 10
one 10
he 10
brought 10
in 10
our 10
furs 10
and 10
made 10
a 10
snug 10
nest 10
for 10
me 10
and 10
got 10
out 10
some 10
provisions 10
and 10
forced 10
them 10
upon 10
me 10
but 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
eat 10
to 10
even 10
try 10
to 10
do 10
so 10
was 10
repulsive 10
to 10
me 10
and 10
much 10
as 10
i 10
would 10
have 10
liked 10
to 10
please 10
him 10
i 10
could 10
not 10
bring 10
myself 10
to 10
the 10
attempt 10
he 10
looked 10
very 10
sad 10
but 10
did 10
not 10
reproach 10
me 10
taking 10
his 10
field 10
glasses 10
from 10
the 10
case 10
he 10
stood 10
on 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
rock 10
and 10
began 10
to 10
search 10
the 10
horizon 10
suddenly 10
he 10
called 10
out 10
look 10
madam 10
mina 10
look 10
look 10
i 10
sprang 10
up 10
and 10
stood 10
beside 10
him 10
on 10
the 10
rock 10
he 10
handed 10
me 10
his 10
glasses 10
and 10
pointed 10
the 10
snow 10
was 10
now 10
falling 10
more 10
heavily 10
and 10
swirled 10
about 10
fiercely 10
for 10
a 10
high 10
wind 10
was 10
beginning 10
to 10
blow 10
however 10
there 10
were 10
times 10
when 10
there 10
were 10
pauses 10
between 10
the 10
snow 10
flurries 10
and 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
a 10
long 10
way 10
round 10
from 10
the 10
height 10
where 10
we 10
were 10
it 10
was 10
possible 10
to 10
see 10
a 10
great 10
distance 10
and 10
far 10
off 10
beyond 10
the 10
white 10
waste 10
of 10
snow 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
the 10
river 10
lying 10
like 10
a 10
black 10
ribbon 10
in 10
kinks 10
and 10
curls 10
as 10
it 10
wound 10
its 10
way 10
straight 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
us 10
and 10
not 10
far 10
off 10
in 10
fact 10
so 10
near 10
that 10
i 10
wondered 10
we 10
had 10
not 10
noticed 10
before 10
came 10
a 10
group 10
of 10
mounted 10
men 10
hurrying 10
along 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
them 10
was 10
a 10
cart 10
a 10
long 10
leiter 10
wagon 10
which 10
swept 10
from 10
side 10
to 10
side 10
like 10
a 10
dogs 10
tail 10
wagging 10
with 10
each 10
stern 10
inequality 10
of 10
the 10
road 10
outlined 10
against 10
the 10
snow 10
as 10
they 10
were 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
from 10
the 10
mens 10
clothes 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
peasants 10
or 10
gypsies 10
of 10
some 10
kind 10
on 10
the 10
cart 10
was 10
a 10
great 10
square 10
chest 10
my 10
heart 10
leaped 10
as 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
for 10
i 10
felt 10
that 10
the 10
end 10
was 10
coming 10
the 10
evening 10
was 10
now 10
drawing 10
close 10
and 10
well 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
at 10
sunset 10
the 10
thing 10
which 10
was 10
till 10
then 10
imprisoned 10
there 10
would 10
take 10
new 10
freedom 10
and 10
could 10
in 10
any 10
of 10
many 10
forms 10
elude 10
pursuit 10
in 10
fear 10
i 10
turned 10
to 10
the 10
professor 10
to 10
my 10
consternation 10
however 10
he 10
was 10
not 10
there 10
an 10
instant 10
later 10
i 10
saw 10
him 10
below 10
me 10
round 10
the 10
rock 10
he 10
had 10
drawn 10
a 10
circle 10
such 10
as 10
we 10
had 10
found 10
shelter 10
in 10
last 10
night 10
when 10
he 10
had 10
completed 10
it 10
he 10
stood 10
beside 10
me 10
again 10
saying 10
at 10
least 10
you 10
shall 10
be 10
safe 10
here 10
from 10
him 10
he 10
took 10
the 10
glasses 10
from 10
me 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
next 10
lull 10
of 10
the 10
snow 10
swept 10
the 10
whole 10
space 10
below 10
us 10
see 10
he 10
said 10
they 10
come 10
quickly 10
they 10
are 10
flogging 10
the 10
horses 10
and 10
galloping 10
as 10
hard 10
as 10
they 10
can 10
he 10
paused 10
and 10
went 10
on 10
in 10
a 10
hollow 10
voice 10
they 10
are 10
racing 10
for 10
the 10
sunset 10
we 10
may 10
be 10
too 10
late 10
gods 10
will 10
be 10
done 10
down 10
came 10
another 10
blinding 10
rush 10
of 10
driving 10
snow 10
and 10
the 10
whole 10
landscape 10
was 10
blotted 10
out 10
it 10
soon 10
passed 10
however 10
and 10
once 10
more 10
his 10
glasses 10
were 10
fixed 10
on 10
the 10
plain 10
then 10
came 10
a 10
sudden 10
cry 10
look 10
look 10
look 10
see 10
two 10
horsemen 10
follow 10
fast 10
coming 10
up 10
from 10
the 10
south 10
it 10
must 10
be 10
quincey 10
and 10
john 10
take 10
the 10
glass 10
look 10
before 10
the 10
snow 10
blots 10
it 10
all 10
out 10
i 10
took 10
it 10
and 10
looked 10
the 10
two 10
men 10

all 10
events 10
that 10
neither 10
of 10
them 10
was 10
jonathan 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
time 10
i 10
knew 10
that 10
jonathan 10
was 10
not 10
far 10
off 10
looking 10
around 10
i 10
saw 10
on 10
the 10
north 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
coming 10
party 10
two 10
other 10
men 10
riding 10
at 10
breakneck 10
speed 10
one 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
knew 10
was 10
jonathan 10
and 10
the 10
other 10
i 10
took 10
of 10
course 10
to 10
be 10
lord 10
godalming 10
they 10
too 10
were 10
pursuing 10
the 10
party 10
with 10
the 10
cart 10
when 10
i 10
told 10
the 10
professor 10
he 10
shouted 10
in 10
glee 10
like 10
a 10
schoolboy 10
and 10
after 10
looking 10
intently 10
till 10
a 10
snow 10
fall 10
made 10
sight 10
impossible 10
he 10
laid 10
his 10
winchester 10
rifle 10
ready 10
for 10
use 10
against 10
the 10
boulder 10
at 10
the 10
opening 10
of 10
our 10
shelter 10
they 10
are 10
all 10
converging 10
he 10
saidwhen 10
the 10
time 10
comes 10
we 10
shall 10
have 10
gypsies 10
on 10
all 10
sides 10
i 10
got 10
out 10
my 10
revolver 10
ready 10
to 10
hand 10
for 10
whilst 10
we 10
were 10
speaking 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
wolves 10
came 10
louder 10
and 10
closer 10
when 10
the 10
snow 10
storm 10
abated 10
a 10
moment 10
we 10
looked 10
again 10
it 10
was 10
strange 10
to 10
see 10
the 10
snow 10
falling 10
in 10
such 10
heavy 10
flakes 10
close 10
to 10
us 10
and 10
beyond 10
the 10
sun 10
shining 10
more 10
and 10
more 10
brightly 10
as 10
it 10
sank 10
down 10
towards 10
the 10
far 10
mountain 10
tops 10
sweeping 10
the 10
glass 10
all 10
around 10
us 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
here 10
and 10
there 10
dots 10
moving 10
singly 10
and 10
in 10
twos 10
and 10
threes 10
and 10
larger 10
numbers 10
the 10
wolves 10
were 10
gathering 10
for 10
their 10
prey 10
every 10
instant 10
seemed 10
an 10
age 10
whilst 10
we 10
waited 10
the 10
wind 10
came 10
now 10
in 10
fierce 10
bursts 10
and 10
the 10
snow 10
was 10
driven 10
with 10
fury 10
as 10
it 10
swept 10
upon 10
us 10
in 10
circling 10
eddies 10
at 10
times 10
we 10
could 10
not 10
see 10
an 10
arms 10
length 10
before 10
us 10
but 10
at 10
others 10
as 10
the 10
hollow 10
sounding 10
wind 10
swept 10
by 10
us 10
it 10
seemed 10
to 10
clear 10
the 10
air 10
space 10
around 10
us 10
so 10
that 10
we 10
could 10
see 10
afar 10
off 10
we 10
had 10
of 10
late 10
been 10
so 10
accustomed 10
to 10
watch 10
for 10
sunrise 10
and 10
sunset 10
that 10
we 10
knew 10
with 10
fair 10
accuracy 10
when 10
it 10
would 10
be 10
and 10
we 10
knew 10
that 10
before 10
long 10
the 10
sun 10
would 10
set 10
it 10
was 10
hard 10
to 10
believe 10
that 10
by 10
our 10
watches 10
it 10
was 10
less 10
than 10
an 10
hour 10
that 10
we 10
waited 10
in 10
that 10
rocky 10
shelter 10
before 10
the 10
various 10
bodies 10
began 10
to 10
converge 10
close 10
upon 10
us 10
the 10
wind 10
came 10
now 10
with 10
fiercer 10
and 10
more 10
bitter 10
sweeps 10
and 10
more 10
steadily 10
from 10
the 10
north 10
it 10
seemingly 10
had 10
driven 10
the 10
snow 10
clouds 10
from 10
us 10
for 10
with 10
only 10
occasional 10
bursts 10
the 10
snow 10
fell 10
we 10
could 10
distinguish 10
clearly 10
the 10
individuals 10
of 10
each 10
party 10
the 10
pursued 10
and 10
the 10
pursuers 10
strangely 10
enough 10
those 10
pursued 10
did 10
not 10
seem 10
to 10
realize 10
or 10
at 10
least 10
to 10
care 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
pursued 10
they 10
seemed 10
however 10
to 10
hasten 10
with 10
redoubled 10
speed 10
as 10
the 10
sun 10
dropped 10
lower 10
and 10
lower 10
on 10
the 10
mountain 10
tops 10
closer 10
and 10
closer 10
they 10
drew 10
the 10
professor 10
and 10
i 10
crouched 10
down 10
behind 10
our 10
rock 10
and 10
held 10
our 10
weapons 10
ready 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
he 10
was 10
determined 10
that 10
they 10
should 10
not 10
pass 10
one 10
and 10
all 10
were 10
quite 10
unaware 10
of 10
our 10
presence 10
all 10
at 10
once 10
two 10
voices 10
shouted 10
out 10
to 10
halt 10
one 10
was 10
my 10
jonathans 10
raised 10
in 10
a 10
high 10
key 10
of 10
passion 10
the 10
other 10
mr 10
morris 10
strong 10
resolute 10
tone 10
of 10
quiet 10
command 10
the 10
gypsies 10
may 10
not 10
have 10
known 10
the 10
language 10
but 10
there 10
was 10
no 10
mistaking 10
the 10
tone 10
in 10
whatever 10
tongue 10
the 10
words 10
were 10
spoken 10
instinctively 10
they 10
reined 10
in 10
and 10
at 10
the 10
instant 10
lord 10
godalming 10
and 10
jonathan 10
dashed 10
up 10
at 10
one 10
side 10
and 10
dr 10
seward 10
and 10
mr 10
morris 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
the 10
leader 10
of 10
the 10
gypsies 10
a 10
splendid 10
looking 10
fellow 10
who 10
sat 10
his 10
horse 10
like 10
a 10
centaur 10
waved 10
them 10
back 10
and 10
in 10
a 10
fierce 10
voice 10
gave 10
to 10
his 10
companions 10
some 10
word 10
to 10
proceed 10
they 10
lashed 10
the 10
horses 10
which 10
sprang 10
forward 10
but 10
the 10
four 10
men 10
raised 10
their 10
winchester 10
rifles 10
and 10
in 10
an 10
unmistakable 10
way 10
commanded 10
them 10
to 10
stop 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
moment 10
dr 10
van 10
helsing 10
and 10
i 10
rose 10
behind 10
the 10
rock 10
and 10
pointed 10
our 10
weapons 10
at 10
them 10
seeing 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
surrounded 10
the 10
men 10
tightened 10
their 10
reins 10
and 10
drew 10
up 10
the 10
leader 10
turned 10
to 10
them 10
and 10
gave 10
a 10
word 10
at 10
which 10
every 10
man 10
of 10
the 10
gypsy 10
party 10
drew 10
what 10
weapon 10
he 10
carried 10
knife 10
or 10
pistol 10
and 10
held 10
himself 10
in 10
readiness 10
to 10
attack 10
issue 10
was 10
joined 10
in 10
an 10
instant 10
the 10
leader 10
with 10
a 10
quick 10
movement 10
of 10
his 10
rein 10
threw 10
his 10
horse 10
out 10
in 10
front 10
and 10
pointed 10
first 10
to 10
the 10
sun 10
now 10
close 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
hill 10
tops 10
and 10
then 10
to 10
the 10
castle 10
said 10
something 10
which 10
i 10
did 10
not 10
understand 10
for 10
answer 10
all 10
four 10
men 10
of 10
our 10
party 10
threw 10
themselves 10
from 10
their 10
horses 10
and 10
dashed 10
towards 10
the 10
cart 10
i 10
should 10
have 10
felt 10
terrible 10
fear 10
at 10
seeing 10
jonathan 10
in 10
such 10
danger 10
but 10
that 10
the 10
ardor 10
of 10
battle 10
must 10
have 10
been 10
upon 10
me 10
as 10
well 10
as 10
the 10
rest 10
of 10
them 10
i 10
felt 10
no 10
fear 10
but 10
only 10
a 10
wild 10
surging 10
desire 10
to 10
do 10
something 10
seeing 10
the 10
quick 10
movement 10
of 10
our 10
parties 10
the 10
leader 10
of 10
the 10
gypsies 10
gave 10
a 10
command 10
his 10
men 10
instantly 10
formed 10
round 10
the 10
cart 10
in 10
a 10
sort 10
of 10
undisciplined 10
endeavor 10
each 10
one 10
shouldering 10
and 10
pushing 10
the 10
other 10
in 10
his 10
eagerness 10
to 10
carry 10
out 10
the 10
order 10
in 10
the 10
midst 10
of 10
this 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
jonathan 10
on 10
one 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
ring 10
of 10
men 10
and 10
quincey 10
on 10
the 10
other 10
were 10
forcing 10
a 10
way 10
to 10
the 10
cart 10
it 10
was 10
evident 10
that 10
they 10
were 10
bent 10
on 10
finishing 10
their 10
task 10
before 10
the 10
sun 10
should 10
set 10
nothing 10
seemed 10
to 10
stop 10
or 10
even 10
to 10
hinder 10
them 10
neither 10
the 10
levelled 10
weapons 10
nor 10
the 10
flashing 10
knives 10
of 10
the 10
gypsies 10
in 10
front 10
nor 10
the 10
howling 10
of 10
the 10
wolves 10
behind 10
appeared 10
to 10
even 10
attract 10
their 10
attention 10
jonathans 10
impetuosity 10
and 10
the 10
manifest 10
singleness 10
of 10
his 10
purpose 10
seemed 10
to 10
overawe 10
those 10
in 10
front 10
of 10
him 10
instinctively 10
they 10
cowered 10
aside 10
and 10
let 10
him 10
pass 10
in 10
an 10
instant 10
he 10
had 10
jumped 10
upon 10
the 10
cart 10
and 10
with 10
a 10
strength 10
which 10
seemed 10
incredible 10
raised 10
the 10
great 10
box 10
and 10
flung 10
it 10
over 10
the 10
wheel 10
to 10
the 10
ground 10
in 10
the 10
meantime 10
mr 10
morris 10
had 10
had 10
to 10
use 10
force 10
to 10
pass 10
through 10
his 10
side 10
of 10
the 10
ring 10
of 10
szgany 10
all 10
the 10
time 10
i 10
had 10
been 10
breathlessly 10
watching 10
jonathan 10
i 10
had 10
with 10
the 10
tail 10
of 10
my 10
eye 10
seen 10
him 10
pressing 10
desperately 10
forward 10
and 10
had 10
seen 10
the 10
knives 10
of 10
the 10
gypsies 10
flash 10
as 10
he 10
won 10
a 10
way 10
through 10
them 10
and 10
they 10
cut 10
at 10
him 10
he 10
had 10
parried 10
with 10
his 10
great 10
bowie 10
knife 10
and 10
at 10
first 10
i 10
thought 10
that 10
he 10
too 10
had 10
come 10
through 10
in 10
safety 10
but 10
as 10
he 10
sprang 10
beside 10
jonathan 10
who 10
had 10
by 10
now 10
jumped 10
from 10
the 10
cart 10
i 10
could 10
see 10
that 10
with 10
his 10
left 10
hand 10
he 10
was 10
clutching 10
at 10
his 10
side 10
and 10
that 10
the 10
blood 10
was 10
spurting 10
through 10
his 10
fingers 10
he 10
did 10
not 10
delay 10
notwithstanding 10
this 10
for 10
as 10
jonathan 10
with 10
desperate 10
energy 10
attacked 10
one 10
end 10
of 10
the 10
chest 10
attempting 10
to 10
prize 10
off 10
the 10
lid 10
with 10
his 10
great 10
kukri 10
knife 10
he 10
attacked 10
the 10
other 10
frantically 10
with 10
his 10
bowie 10
under 10
the 10
efforts 10
of 10
both 10
men 10
the 10
lid 10
began 10
to 10
yield 10
the 10
nails 10
drew 10
with 10
a 10
screeching 10
sound 10
and 10
the 10
top 10
of 10
the 10
box 10
was 10
thrown 10
back 10
by 10
this 10
time 10
the 10
gypsies 10
seeing 10
themselves 10
covered 10

the 10

lord 10
godalming 10

had 10
given 10
in 10
and 10
made 10
no 10
further 10
resistance 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
almost 10
down 10
on 10
the 10
mountain 10
tops 10
and 10
the 10
shadows 10
of 10
the 10
whole 10
group 10
fell 10
upon 10
the 10
snow 10
i 10
saw 10
the 10
count 10
lying 10
within 10
the 10
box 10
upon 10
the 10
earth 10
some 10
of 10
which 10
the 10
rude 10
falling 10
from 10
the 10
cart 10
had 10
scattered 10
over 10
him 10
he 10
was 10
deathly 10
pale 10
just 10
like 10
a 10
waxen 10
image 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
eyes 10
glared 10
with 10
the 10
horrible 10
vindictive 10
look 10
which 10
i 10
knew 10
so 10
well 10
as 10
i 10
looked 10
the 10
eyes 10
saw 10
the 10
sinking 10
sun 10
and 10
the 10
look 10
of 10
hate 10
in 10
them 10
turned 10
to 10
triumph 10
but 10
on 10
the 10
instant 10
came 10
the 10
sweep 10
and 10
flash 10
of 10
jonathans 10
great 10
knife 10
i 10
shrieked 10
as 10
i 10
saw 10
it 10
shear 10
through 10
the 10
throat 10
whilst 10
at 10
the 10
same 10
moment 10
mr 10
morriss 10
bowie 10
knife 10
plunged 10
into 10
the 10
heart 10
it 10
was 10
like 10
a 10
miracle 10
but 10
before 10
our 10
very 10
eyes 10
and 10
almost 10
in 10
the 10
drawing 10
of 10
a 10
breath 10
the 10
whole 10
body 10
crumbled 10
into 10
dust 10
and 10
passed 10
from 10
our 10
sight 10
i 10
shall 10
be 10
glad 10
as 10
long 10
as 10
i 10
live 10
that 10
even 10
in 10
that 10
moment 10
of 10
final 10
dissolution 10
there 10
was 10
in 10
the 10
face 10
a 10
look 10
of 10
peace 10
such 10
as 10
i 10
never 10
could 10
have 10
imagined 10
might 10
have 10
rested 10
there 10
the 10
castle 10
of 10
dracula 10
now 10
stood 10
out 10
against 10
the 10
red 10
sky 10
and 10
every 10
stone 10
of 10
its 10
broken 10
battlements 10
was 10
articulated 10
against 10
the 10
light 10
of 10
the 10
setting 10
sun 10
the 10
gypsies 10
taking 10
us 10
as 10
in 10
some 10
way 10
the 10
cause 10
of 10
the 10
extraordinary 10
disappearance 10
of 10
the 10
dead 10
man 10
turned 10
without 10
a 10
word 10
and 10
rode 10
away 10
as 10
if 10
for 10
their 10
lives 10
those 10
who 10
were 10
unmounted 10
jumped 10
upon 10
the 10
leiter 10
wagon 10
and 10
shouted 10
to 10
the 10
horsemen 10
not 10
to 10
desert 10
them 10
the 10
wolves 10
which 10
had 10
withdrawn 10
to 10
a 10
safe 10
distance 10
followed 10
in 10
their 10
wake 10
leaving 10
us 10
alone 10
mr 10
morris 10
who 10
had 10
sunk 10
to 10
the 10
ground 10
leaned 10
on 10
his 10
elbow 10
holding 10
his 10
hand 10
pressed 10
to 10
his 10
side 10
the 10
blood 10
still 10
gushed 10
through 10
his 10
fingers 10
i 10
flew 10
to 10
him 10
for 10
the 10
holy 10
circle 10
did 10
not 10
now 10
keep 10
me 10
back 10
so 10
did 10
the 10
two 10
doctors 10
jonathan 10
knelt 10
behind 10
him 10
and 10
the 10
wounded 10
man 10
laid 10
back 10
his 10
head 10
on 10
his 10
shoulder 10
with 10
a 10
sigh 10
he 10
took 10
with 10
a 10
feeble 10
effort 10
my 10
hand 10
in 10
that 10
of 10
his 10
own 10
which 10
was 10
unstained 10
he 10
must 10
have 10
seen 10
the 10
anguish 10
of 10
my 10
heart 10
in 10
my 10
face 10
for 10
he 10
smiled 10
at 10
me 10
and 10
said 10
i 10
am 10
only 10
too 10
happy 10
to 10
have 10
been 10
of 10
service 10
oh 10
god 10
he 10
cried 10
suddenly 10
struggling 10
to 10
a 10
sitting 10
posture 10
and 10
pointing 10
to 10
me 10
it 10
was 10
worth 10
for 10
this 10
to 10
die 10
look 10
look 10
the 10
sun 10
was 10
now 10
right 10
down 10
upon 10
the 10
mountain 10
top 10
and 10
the 10
red 10
gleams 10
fell 10
upon 10
my 10
face 10
so 10
that 10
it 10
was 10
bathed 10
in 10
rosy 10
light 10
with 10
one 10
impulse 10
the 10
men 10
sank 10
on 10
their 10
knees 10
and 10
a 10
deep 10
and 10
earnest 10
amen 10
broke 10
from 10
all 10
as 10
their 10
eyes 10
followed 10
the 10
pointing 10
of 10
his 10
finger 10
the 10
dying 10
man 10
spoke 10
now 10
god 10
be 10
thanked 10
that 10
all 10
has 10
not 10
been 10
in 10
vain 10
see 10
the 10
snow 10
is 10
not 10
more 10
stainless 10
than 10
her 10
forehead 10
the 10
curse 10
has 10
passed 10
away 10
and 10
to 10
our 10
bitter 10
grief 10
with 10
a 10
smile 10
and 10
in 10
silence 10
he 10
died 10
a 10
gallant 10
gentleman 10
note 10
seven 10
years 10
ago 10
we 10
all 10
went 10
through 10
the 10
flames 10
and 10
the 10
happiness 10
of 10
some 10
of 10
us 10
since 10
then 10
is 10
we 10
think 10
well 10
worth 10
the 10
pain 10
we 10
endured 10
it 10
is 10
an 10
added 10
joy 10
to 10
mina 10
and 10
to 10
me 10
that 10
our 10
boys 10
birthday 10
is 10
the 10
same 10
day 10
as 10
that 10
on 10
which 10
quincey 10
morris 10
died 10
his 10
mother 10
holds 10
i 10
know 10
the 10
secret 10
belief 10
that 10
some 10
of 10
our 10
brave 10
friends 10
spirit 10
has 10
passed 10
into 10
him 10
his 10
bundle 10
of 10
names 10
links 10
all 10
our 10
little 10
band 10
of 10
men 10
together 10
but 10
we 10
call 10
him 10
quincey 10
in 10
the 10
summer 10
of 10
this 10
year 10
we 10
made 10
a 10
journey 10
to 10
transylvania 10
and 10
went 10
over 10
the 10
old 10
ground 10
which 10
was 10
and 10
is 10
to 10
us 10
so 10
full 10
of 10
vivid 10
and 10
terrible 10
memories 10
it 10
was 10
almost 10
impossible 10
to 10
believe 10
that 10
the 10
things 10
which 10
we 10
had 10
seen 10
with 10
our 10
own 10
eyes 10
and 10
heard 10
with 10
our 10
own 10
ears 10
were 10
living 10
truths 10
every 10
trace 10
of 10
all 10
that 10
had 10
been 10
was 10
blotted 10
out 10
the 10
castle 10
stood 10
as 10
before 10
reared 10
high 10
above 10
a 10
waste 10
of 10
desolation 10
when 10
we 10
got 10
home 10
we 10
were 10
talking 10
of 10
the 10
old 10
time 10
which 10
we 10
could 10
all 10
look 10
back 10
on 10
without 10
despair 10
for 10
godalming 10
and 10
seward 10
are 10
both 10
happily 10
married 10
i 10
took 10
the 10
papers 10
from 10
the 10
safe 10
where 10
they 10
had 10
been 10
ever 10
since 10
our 10
return 10
so 10
long 10
ago 10
we 10
were 10
struck 10
with 10
the 10
fact 10
that 10
in 10
all 10
the 10
mass 10
of 10
material 10
of 10
which 10
the 10
record 10
is 10
composed 10
there 10
is 10
hardly 10
one 10
authentic 10
document 10
nothing 10
but 10
a 10
mass 10
of 10
typewriting 10
except 10
the 10
later 10
notebooks 10
of 10

we 10
could 10
hardly 10
ask 10
any 10
one 10
even 10
did 10
we 10
wish 10
to 10
to 10
accept 10
these 10
as 10
proofs 10
of 10
so 10

up 10

said 10
with 10
our 10

no 10

us 10
this 10

some 10
day 10

her 10

will 10
understand 10
how 10
some 10

adam 11
salton 11
sauntered 11
into 11
the 11
empire 11
club 11
sydney 11
and 11
found 11
awaiting 11
him 11
a 11
letter 11
from 11
his 11
granduncle 11
he 11
had 11
first 11
heard 11
from 11
the 11
old 11
gentleman 11
less 11
than 11
a 11
year 11
before 11
when 11
richard 11
salton 11
had 11
claimed 11
kinship 11
stating 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
unable 11
to 11
write 11
earlier 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
found 11
it 11
very 11
difficult 11
to 11
trace 11
his 11
grandnephews 11
address 11
adam 11
was 11
delighted 11
and 11
replied 11
cordially 11
he 11
had 11
often 11
heard 11
his 11
father 11
speak 11
of 11
the 11
older 11
branch 11
of 11
the 11
family 11
with 11
whom 11
his 11
people 11
had 11
long 11
lost 11
touch 11
some 11
interesting 11
correspondence 11
had 11
ensued 11
adam 11
eagerly 11
opened 11
the 11
letter 11
which 11
had 11
only 11
just 11
arrived 11
and 11
conveyed 11
a 11
cordial 11
invitation 11
to 11
stop 11
with 11
his 11
granduncle 11
at 11
lesser 11
hill 11
for 11
as 11
long 11
a 11
time 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
spare 11
indeed 11
richard 11
salton 11
went 11

and 11
though 11
we 11
have 11
been 11
a 11
longlived 11
race 11
the 11
span 11
of 11
life 11
cannot 11
be 11
prolonged 11
beyond 11
reasonable 11
bounds 11

a 11

early 11
on 11
the 11
important 11
day 11
to 11
start 11
for 11
stafford 11
where 11
he 11
would 11
catch 11
the 11
am 11
train 11
he 11
would 11
stay 11
that 11
night 11
with 11
his 11
grandnephew 11
either 11
on 11
the 11
ship 11
which 11
would 11
be 11
a 11
new 11
experience 11
for 11
him 11
or 11
if 11
his 11
guest 11
should 11
prefer 11
it 11
at 11
a 11
hotel 11
in 11
either 11
case 11
they 11
would 11
start 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
for 11
home 11
he 11
had 11
given 11
instructions 11
to 11
his 11
bailiff 11
to 11
send 11
the 11
postillion 11

to 11
be 11
ready 11
for 11
their 11
journey 11
home 11
and 11
to 11
arrange 11
for 11
relays 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
horses 11
to 11
be 11
sent 11
on 11
at 11
once 11
he 11
intended 11
that 11
his 11
grandnephew 11
who 11
had 11
been 11
all 11
his 11
life 11
in 11
australia 11
should 11
see 11
something 11
of 11
rural 11
england 11
on 11
the 11
drive 11
he 11
had 11
plenty 11
of 11
young 11
horses 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
breeding 11
and 11
breaking 11
and 11
could 11
depend 11
on 11
a 11
journey 11
memorable 11
to 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
the 11
luggage 11
would 11
be 11
sent 11
on 11
by 11
rail 11
to 11
stafford 11
where 11
one 11
of 11
his 11
carts 11
would 11
meet 11
it 11
mr 11
salton 11
during 11
the 11
journey 11
to 11
southampton 11
often 11
wondered 11
if 11
his 11
grandnephew 11
was 11
as 11
much 11
excited 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
at 11
the 11
idea 11
of 11
meeting 11
so 11
near 11
a 11
relation 11
for 11
the 11
first 11
time 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
with 11
an 11
effort 11
that 11
he 11
controlled 11
himself 11
the 11
endless 11
railway 11
lines 11
and 11
switches 11
round 11
the 11
southampton 11
docks 11
fired 11
his 11
anxiety 11
afresh 11
as 11
the 11
train 11
drew 11
up 11
on 11
the 11
dockside 11
he 11
was 11
getting 11
his 11
hand 11
traps 11
together 11
when 11
the 11
carriage 11
door 11
was 11
wrenched 11
open 11
and 11
a 11
young 11
man 11
jumped 11
in 11
how 11
are 11
you 11
uncle 11
i 11
recognised 11
you 11
from 11
the 11
photo 11
you 11
sent 11
me 11
i 11
wanted 11
to 11
meet 11
you 11
as 11
soon 11
as 11
i 11
could 11
but 11
everything 11
is 11
so 11
strange 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
i 11
didnt 11
quite 11
know 11
what 11
to 11
do 11
however 11
here 11
i 11
am 11
i 11
am 11
glad 11
to 11
see 11
you 11
sir 11
i 11
have 11
been 11
dreaming 11
of 11
this 11
happiness 11
for 11
thousands 11
of 11
miles 11
now 11
i 11
find 11
that 11
the 11
reality 11
beats 11
all 11
the 11
dreaming 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
and 11
the 11
young 11
one 11
were 11
heartily 11
wringing 11
each 11
others 11
hands 11
the 11
meeting 11
so 11
auspiciously 11
begun 11
proceeded 11
well 11
adam 11
seeing 11
that 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
was 11
interested 11
in 11
the 11
novelty 11
of 11
the 11
ship 11
suggested 11
that 11
he 11
should 11
stay 11
the 11
night 11
on 11
board 11
and 11
that 11
he 11
would 11
himself 11
be 11
ready 11
to 11
start 11
at 11
any 11
hour 11
and 11
go 11
anywhere 11
that 11
the 11
other 11
suggested 11
this 11
affectionate 11
willingness 11
to 11
fall 11
in 11
with 11
his 11
own 11
plans 11
quite 11
won 11
the 11
old 11
mans 11
heart 11
he 11
warmly 11
accepted 11
the 11
invitation 11
and 11
at 11
once 11
they 11
became 11
not 11
only 11
on 11
terms 11
of 11
affectionate 11
relationship 11
but 11
almost 11
like 11
old 11
friends 11
the 11
heart 11
of 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
empty 11
for 11
so 11
long 11
found 11
a 11
new 11
delight 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
found 11
on 11
landing 11
in 11
the 11
old 11
country 11
a 11
welcome 11
and 11
a 11
surrounding 11
in 11
full 11
harmony 11
with 11
all 11
his 11
dreams 11
throughout 11
his 11
wanderings 11
and 11
solitude 11
and 11
the 11
promise 11
of 11
a 11
fresh 11
and 11
adventurous 11
life 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
long 11
before 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
accepted 11
him 11
to 11
full 11
relationship 11
by 11
calling 11
him 11
by 11
his 11
christian 11
name 11
after 11
a 11
long 11
talk 11
on 11
affairs 11
of 11
interest 11
they 11
retired 11
to 11
the 11
cabin 11
which 11
the 11
elder 11
was 11
to 11
share 11
richard 11
salton 11
put 11
his 11
hands 11
affectionately 11
on 11
the 11
boys 11
shouldersthough 11
adam 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
twentyseventh 11
year 11
he 11
was 11
a 11
boy 11
and 11
always 11
would 11
be 11
to 11
his 11
granduncle 11
i 11
am 11
so 11
glad 11
to 11
find 11
you 11
as 11
you 11
are 11
my 11
dear 11
boyjust 11
such 11
a 11
young 11
man 11
as 11
i 11
had 11
always 11
hoped 11
for 11
as 11
a 11
son 11
in 11
the 11
days 11
when 11
i 11
still 11
had 11
such 11
hopes 11
however 11
that 11
is 11
all 11
past 11
but 11
thank 11
god 11
there 11
is 11
a 11
new 11
life 11
to 11
begin 11
for 11
both 11
of 11
us 11
to 11
you 11
must 11
be 11
the 11
larger 11
part 11
but 11
there 11
is 11
still 11
time 11
for 11
some 11
of 11
it 11
to 11
be 11
shared 11
in 11
common 11
i 11
have 11
waited 11
till 11
we 11
should 11
have 11
seen 11
each 11
other 11
to 11
enter 11
upon 11
the 11
subject 11
for 11
i 11
thought 11
it 11
better 11
not 11
to 11
tie 11
up 11
your 11
young 11
life 11
to 11
my 11
old 11
one 11
till 11
we 11
should 11
have 11
sufficient 11
personal 11
knowledge 11
to 11
justify 11
such 11
a 11
venture 11
now 11
i 11
can 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
i 11
am 11
concerned 11
enter 11
into 11
it 11
freely 11
since 11
from 11
the 11
moment 11
my 11
eyes 11
rested 11
on 11
you 11
i 11
saw 11
my 11
sonas 11
he 11
shall 11
be 11
god 11
willingif 11
he 11
chooses 11
such 11
a 11
course 11
himself 11
indeed 11
i 11
do 11
sirwith 11
all 11
my 11
heart 11
thank 11
you 11
adam 11
for 11
that 11
the 11
old 11
mans 11
eyes 11
filled 11
and 11
his 11
voice 11
trembled 11
then 11
after 11
a 11
long 11
silence 11
between 11
them 11
he 11
went 11
on 11
when 11
i 11
heard 11
you 11
were 11
coming 11
i 11
made 11
my 11

that 11

mr 11
salton 11
had 11
all 11
his 11
life 11
been 11
an 11
early 11
riser 11
and 11
necessarily 11
an 11
early 11
waker 11
but 11
early 11
as 11
he 11
woke 11
on 11
the 11
next 11
morningand 11
although 11
there 11
was 11
an 11
excuse 11
for 11
not 11
prolonging 11
sleep 11
in 11
the 11
constant 11
whirr 11
and 11
rattle 11
of 11
the 11
donkey 11
engine 11
winches 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
shiphe 11
met 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
adam 11
fixed 11
on 11
him 11
from 11
his 11
berth 11
his 11
grandnephew 11
had 11
given 11
him 11
the 11
sofa 11
occupying 11
the 11
lower 11
berth 11
himself 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
despite 11
his 11
great 11
strength 11
and 11
normal 11
activity 11
was 11
somewhat 11
tired 11
by 11
his 11
long 11
journey 11
of 11
the 11
day 11
before 11
and 11
the 11
prolonged 11
and 11
exciting 11
interview 11
which 11
followed 11
it 11
so 11
he 11
was 11
glad 11
to 11
lie 11
still 11
and 11
rest 11
his 11
body 11
whilst 11
his 11
mind 11
was 11
actively 11
exercised 11
in 11
taking 11
in 11
all 11
he 11
could 11
of 11
his 11
strange 11
surroundings 11
adam 11
too 11
after 11
the 11
pastoral 11
habit 11
to 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
bred 11
woke 11
with 11
the 11
dawn 11
and 11
was 11
ready 11
to 11
enter 11
on 11
the 11
experiences 11
of 11
the 11
new 11
day 11
whenever 11
it 11
might 11
suit 11
his 11
elder 11
companion 11
it 11
was 11
little 11
wonder 11
then 11
that 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
each 11
realised 11
the 11
others 11
readiness 11
they 11
simultaneously 11
jumped 11
up 11
and 11
began 11
to 11
dress 11
the 11
steward 11
had 11
by 11
previous 11
instructions 11
early 11
breakfast 11
prepared 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
long 11
before 11
they 11
went 11
down 11
the 11
gangway 11
on 11
shore 11
in 11
search 11
of 11
the 11
carriage 11
they 11
found 11
mr 11
saltons 11
bailiff 11
looking 11
out 11
for 11
them 11
on 11
the 11
dock 11
and 11
he 11
brought 11
them 11
at 11
once 11
to 11
where 11
the 11
carriage 11
was 11
waiting 11
in 11
the 11
street 11
richard 11
salton 11
pointed 11
out 11
with 11
pride 11
to 11
his 11
young 11
companion 11
the 11
suitability 11
of 11
the 11
vehicle 11
for 11
every 11
need 11
of 11
travel 11
to 11
it 11
were 11
harnessed 11
four 11
useful 11
horses 11
with 11
a 11
postillion 11
to 11
each 11
pair 11
see 11
said 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
proudly 11
how 11
it 11
has 11
all 11
the 11
luxuries 11
of 11
useful 11
travelsilence 11
and 11
isolation 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
speed 11
there 11
is 11
nothing 11
to 11
obstruct 11
the 11
view 11
of 11
those 11
travelling 11
and 11
no 11
one 11
to 11
overhear 11
what 11
they 11
may 11
say 11
i 11
have 11
used 11
that 11
trap 11
for 11
a 11
quarter 11
of 11
a 11
century 11
and 11
i 11
never 11
saw 11
one 11
more 11
suitable 11
for 11
travel 11
you 11
shall 11
test 11
it 11
shortly 11
we 11
are 11
going 11
to 11
drive 11
through 11
the 11
heart 11
of 11
england 11
and 11
as 11
we 11
go 11
ill 11
tell 11
you 11
what 11
i 11
was 11
speaking 11
of 11
last 11
night 11
our 11
route 11
is 11
to 11
be 11
by 11
salisbury 11
bath 11
bristol 11
cheltenham 11
worcester 11
stafford 11
and 11
so 11
home 11
adam 11
remained 11
silent 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
during 11
which 11
he 11
seemed 11
all 11
eyes 11
for 11
he 11
perpetually 11
ranged 11
the 11
whole 11
circle 11
of 11
the 11
horizon 11
has 11
our 11
journey 11
today 11
sir 11
he 11
asked 11
any 11
special 11
relation 11
to 11
what 11
you 11
said 11
last 11
night 11
that 11
you 11
wanted 11
to 11
tell 11
me 11
not 11
directly 11
but 11
indirectly 11
everything 11
wont 11
you 11
tell 11
me 11
nowi 11
see 11
we 11
cannot 11
be 11
overheardand 11
if 11
anything 11
strikes 11
you 11
as 11
we 11
go 11
along 11
just 11
run 11
it 11
in 11
i 11
shall 11
understand 11
so 11
old 11
salton 11
spoke 11
to 11
begin 11
at 11
the 11
beginning 11
adam 11
that 11
lecture 11
of 11
yours 11
on 11
the 11
romans 11
in 11
britain 11
a 11
report 11
of 11
which 11
you 11
posted 11
to 11
me 11
set 11
me 11
thinkingin 11
addition 11
to 11
telling 11
me 11
your 11
tastes 11
i 11
wrote 11
to 11
you 11
at 11
once 11
and 11
asked 11
you 11
to 11
come 11
home 11
for 11
it 11
struck 11
me 11
that 11
if 11
you 11
were 11
fond 11
of 11
historical 11
researchas 11
seemed 11
a 11
factthis 11
was 11
exactly 11
the 11
place 11
for 11
you 11
in 11
addition 11
to 11
its 11
being 11
the 11
home 11
of 11
your 11
own 11
forbears 11
if 11
you 11
could 11
learn 11
so 11
much 11
of 11
the 11
british 11
romans 11
so 11
far 11
away 11
in 11
new 11
south 11
wales 11
where 11
there 11
cannot 11
be 11
even 11
a 11
tradition 11
of 11
them 11
what 11
might 11
you 11
not 11
make 11
of 11
the 11
same 11
amount 11
of 11
study 11
on 11
the 11
very 11
spot 11
where 11
we 11
are 11
going 11
is 11
in 11
the 11
real 11
heart 11
of 11
the 11
old 11
kingdom 11
of 11
mercia 11
where 11
there 11
are 11
traces 11
of 11
all 11
the 11
various 11
nationalities 11
which 11
made 11
up 11
the 11
conglomerate 11
which 11
became 11
britain 11
i 11
rather 11
gathered 11
that 11
you 11
had 11
some 11
more 11
definitemore 11
personal 11
reason 11
for 11
my 11
hurrying 11
after 11
all 11
history 11
can 11
keepexcept 11
in 11
the 11
making 11
quite 11
right 11
my 11
boy 11
i 11
had 11
a 11
reason 11
such 11
as 11
you 11
very 11
wisely 11
guessed 11
i 11
was 11
anxious 11
for 11
you 11
to 11
be 11
here 11
when 11
a 11
rather 11
important 11
phase 11
of 11
our 11
local 11
history 11
occurred 11
what 11
is 11
that 11
if 11
i 11
may 11
ask 11
sir 11
certainly 11
the 11
principal 11
landowner 11
of 11
our 11
part 11
of 11
the 11
county 11
is 11
on 11
his 11
way 11
home 11
and 11
there 11
will 11
be 11
a 11
great 11
homecoming 11
which 11
you 11
may 11
care 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
fact 11
is 11
for 11
more 11
than 11
a 11
century 11
the 11
various 11
owners 11
in 11
the 11
succession 11
here 11
with 11
the 11
exception 11
of 11
a 11
short 11
time 11
have 11
lived 11
abroad 11
how 11
is 11
that 11
sir 11
if 11
i 11
may 11
ask 11
the 11
great 11
house 11
and 11
estate 11
in 11
our 11
part 11
of 11

the 11
man 11
who 11
is 11
coming 11
hereand 11
he 11
was 11
the 11
only 11
one 11
who 11
stayed 11
even 11
a 11
short 11
time 11

up 11
any 11
intercourse 11
good 11
or 11
bad 11
with 11
his 11
relatives 11
although 11
this 11
particular 11
edgar 11
as 11
i 11
told 11
you 11
did 11
visit 11
his 11
family 11
estate 11
yet 11
his 11
son 11
was 11
born 11
and 11
lived 11
and 11
died 11
abroad 11
while 11
his 11
grandson 11

over 11
thirtyhis 11
present 11
age 11
this 11
was 11
the 11
second 11

of 11
absentees 11
the 11
great 11
estate 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
has 11
had 11
no 11
knowledge 11
of 11
its 11
owner 11
for 11
five 11
generationscovering 11
more 11
than 11
a 11
hundred 11
and 11
twenty 11
years 11
it 11
has 11
been 11
well 11
administered 11
however 11
and 11
no 11
tenant 11
or 11
other 11
connected 11
with 11
it 11
has 11
had 11
anything 11
of 11
which 11
to 11
complain 11
all 11
the 11
same 11
there 11
has 11
been 11
much 11
natural 11
anxiety 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
new 11
owner 11
and 11
we 11
are 11
all 11
excited 11
about 11
the 11
event 11
of 11
his 11
coming 11
even 11
i 11
am 11

after 11
dinner 11
he 11
is 11
also 11
our 11
local 11
geologist 11
and 11
natural 11
historian 11
so 11
you 11
and 11
he 11
will 11
have 11
many 11
interests 11
in 11
common 11
amongst 11
other 11
things 11
he 11
has 11
a 11
special 11
knowledge 11
of 11
the 11
peak 11
and 11
its 11
caverns 11
and 11
knows 11
all 11
the 11
old 11
legends 11
of 11
prehistoric 11
times 11
they 11
spent 11
the 11
night 11
at 11
cheltenham 11
and 11
on 11
the 11
following 11
morning 11
resumed 11
their 11
journey 11
to 11
stafford 11
adams 11
eyes 11
were 11
in 11
constant 11
employment 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
till 11
salton 11
declared 11
that 11
they 11
had 11
now 11
entered 11
on 11
the 11
last 11
stage 11
of 11
their 11
journey 11
that 11
he 11
referred 11
to 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
coming 11
as 11
the 11
dusk 11
was 11
closing 11
down 11
they 11
drove 11
on 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
mr 11
saltons 11
house 11
it 11
was 11
now 11
too 11
dark 11
to 11
see 11
any 11
details 11
of 11
their 11
surroundings 11
adam 11
could 11
just 11
see 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
on 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
a 11
hill 11
not 11
quite 11
so 11
high 11
as 11
that 11
which 11
was 11
covered 11
by 11
the 11
castle 11
on 11
whose 11
tower 11
flew 11
the 11
flag 11
and 11
which 11
was 11
all 11
ablaze 11
with 11
moving 11
lights 11
manifestly 11
used 11
in 11
the 11
preparations 11
for 11
the 11
festivities 11
on 11
the 11
morrow 11
so 11
adam 11
deferred 11
his 11
curiosity 11
till 11
daylight 11
his 11
grand 11
uncle 11
was 11
met 11
at 11
the 11
door 11
by 11
a 11
fine 11
old 11
man 11
who 11
greeted 11
him 11
warmly 11
i 11
came 11
over 11
early 11
as 11
you 11
wished 11
i 11
suppose 11
this 11
is 11
your 11
grand 11
nephewi 11
am 11
glad 11
to 11
meet 11
you 11
mr 11
adam 11
salton 11
i 11
am 11
nathaniel 11
de 11
salis 11
and 11
your 11
uncle 11
is 11
one 11
of 11
my 11
oldest 11
friends 11
adam 11
from 11
the 11
moment 11
of 11
their 11
eyes 11
meeting 11
felt 11
as 11
if 11
they 11
were 11
already 11
friends 11
the 11
meeting 11
was 11
a 11
new 11
note 11
of 11
welcome 11
to 11
those 11
that 11
had 11
already 11
sounded 11
in 11
his 11
ears 11
the 11
cordiality 11
with 11
which 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
adam 11
met 11
made 11
the 11
imparting 11
of 11
information 11
easy 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
a 11
clever 11
man 11
of 11
the 11
world 11
who 11
had 11
travelled 11
much 11
and 11
within 11
a 11
certain 11
area 11
studied 11
deeply 11
he 11
was 11
a 11
brilliant 11
conversationalist 11
as 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
expected 11
from 11
a 11
successful 11
diplomatist 11
even 11
under 11
unstimulating 11
conditions 11
but 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
touched 11
and 11
to 11
a 11
certain 11
extent 11
fired 11
by 11
the 11
younger 11
mans 11
evident 11
admiration 11
and 11
willingness 11
to 11
learn 11
from 11
him 11
accordingly 11
the 11
conversation 11
which 11
began 11
on 11
the 11
most 11
friendly 11
basis 11
soon 11
warmed 11
to 11
an 11
interest 11
above 11
proof 11
as 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
spoke 11
of 11
it 11
next 11
day 11
to 11
richard 11
salton 11
he 11
knew 11
already 11
that 11
his 11
old 11
friend 11
wanted 11
his 11
grandnephew 11
to 11
learn 11
all 11
he 11
could 11
of 11
the 11
subject 11
in 11
hand 11
and 11
so 11
had 11
during 11
his 11
journey 11
from 11
the 11
peak 11
put 11
his 11
thoughts 11
in 11
sequence 11
for 11
narration 11
and 11
explanation 11
accordingly 11
adam 11
had 11
only 11
to 11
listen 11
and 11
he 11
must 11
learn 11
much 11
that 11
he 11
wanted 11
to 11
know 11
when 11
dinner 11
was 11
over 11
and 11
the 11
servants 11
had 11
withdrawn 11
leaving 11
the 11
three 11
men 11
at 11
their 11
wine 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
began 11
i 11
gather 11
from 11
your 11
uncleby 11
the 11
way 11
i 11
suppose 11
we 11
had 11
better 11
speak 11
of 11
you 11
as 11
uncle 11
and 11
nephew 11
instead 11
of 11
going 11
into 11
exact 11
relationship 11
in 11
fact 11
your 11
uncle 11
is 11
so 11
old 11
and 11
dear 11
a 11
friend 11
that 11
with 11
your 11
permission 11
i 11
shall 11
drop 11
formality 11
with 11
you 11
altogether 11
and 11
speak 11
of 11
you 11
and 11
to 11
you 11
as 11
adam 11
as 11
though 11
you 11
were 11
his 11
son 11
i 11
should 11
like 11
answered 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
nothing 11
better 11
the 11
answer 11
warmed 11
the 11
hearts 11
of 11
both 11
the 11
old 11
men 11
but 11
with 11
the 11
usual 11
avoidance 11
of 11
englishmen 11
of 11
emotional 11
subjects 11
personal 11
to 11
themselves 11
they 11
instinctively 11
returned 11
to 11
the 11
previous 11
question 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
took 11
the 11
lead 11
i 11
understand 11
adam 11
that 11
your 11
uncle 11
has 11
posted 11
you 11
regarding 11
the 11
relationships 11
of 11
the 11
caswall 11
family 11
partly 11
sir 11
but 11
i 11
understood 11
that 11
i 11
was 11
to 11
hear 11
minuter 11
details 11
from 11
youif 11
you 11
would 11
be 11
so 11
good 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
delighted 11
to 11
tell 11
you 11
anything 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
my 11
knowledge 11
goes 11
well 11
the 11
first 11
caswall 11
in 11
our 11
immediate 11
record 11
is 11
an 11
edgar 11
head 11
of 11
the 11
family 11
and 11
owner 11
of 11
the 11
estate 11
who 11
came 11
into 11
his 11
kingdom 11
just 11
about 11
the 11
time 11
that 11
george 11
iii 11
did 11
he 11
had 11
one 11
son 11
of 11
about 11
twentyfour 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
violent 11
quarrel 11
between 11
the 11
two 11
no 11
one 11
of 11
this 11
generation 11
has 11
any 11
idea 11
of 11
the 11
cause 11
but 11
considering 11
the 11
family 11
characteristics 11
we 11
may 11
take 11
it 11
for 11
granted 11
that 11
though 11
it 11
was 11
deep 11
and 11
violent 11
it 11
was 11
on 11
the 11
surface 11
trivial 11
the 11
result 11
of 11
the 11
quarrel 11
was 11
that 11
the 11
son 11
left 11
the 11
house 11
without 11
a 11
reconciliation 11
or 11
without 11
even 11
telling 11
his 11
father 11
where 11
he 11
was 11
going 11
he 11
never 11
came 11
back 11
again 11
a 11
few 11
years 11
after 11
he 11
died 11
without 11
having 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
exchanged 11
a 11
word 11
or 11
a 11
letter 11
with 11
his 11
father 11
he 11
married 11
abroad 11
and 11
left 11
one 11
son 11
who 11
seems 11
to 11
have 11
been 11
brought 11
up 11
in 11
ignorance 11
of 11
all 11
belonging 11
to 11
him 11
the 11
gulf 11
between 11
them 11
appears 11
to 11
have 11
been 11
unbridgable 11
for 11
in 11
time 11
this 11
son 11
married 11
and 11
in 11
turn 11
had 11
a 11
son 11
but 11
neither 11
joy 11
nor 11
sorrow 11
brought 11
the 11
sundered 11
together 11
under 11
such 11
conditions 11
no 11
rapprochement 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
looked 11
for 11
and 11
an 11
utter 11
indifference 11
founded 11
at 11
best 11
on 11
ignorance 11
took 11
the 11
place 11
of 11
family 11
affectioneven 11
on 11
community 11
of 11
interests 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
due 11
to 11
the 11
watchfulness 11
of 11
the 11
lawyers 11
that 11
the 11
birth 11
of 11
this 11
new 11
heir 11
was 11
ever 11
made 11
known 11
he 11
actually 11
spent 11
a 11
few 11
months 11
in 11
the 11
ancestral 11
home 11
after 11
this 11
the 11
family 11
interest 11
merely 11
rested 11
on 11
heirship 11
of 11
the 11
estate 11
as 11
no 11
other 11
children 11
have 11
been 11
born 11
to 11
any 11
of 11
the 11
newer 11
generations 11
in 11
the 11
intervening 11
years 11
all 11
hopes 11
of 11
heritage 11
are 11
now 11
centred 11
in 11
the 11
grandson 11
of 11
this 11
man 11
now 11
it 11
will 11
be 11
well 11
for 11
you 11
to 11
bear 11
in 11
mind 11
the 11
prevailing 11
characteristics 11
of 11
this 11
race 11
these 11
were 11
well 11
preserved 11
and 11
unchanging 11
one 11
and 11
all 11
they 11
are 11
the 11
same 11
cold 11
selfish 11
dominant 11
reckless 11
of 11
consequences 11
in 11
pursuit 11
of 11
their 11
own 11
will 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
that 11
they 11
did 11
not 11
keep 11
faith 11
though 11
that 11
was 11
a 11
matter 11
which 11
gave 11
them 11
little 11
concern 11
but 11
that 11
they 11
took 11
care 11
to 11
think 11
beforehand 11
of 11
what 11
they 11
should 11
do 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
gain 11
their 11
own 11
ends 11
if 11
they 11
should 11
make 11
a 11
mistake 11
someone 11
else 11
should 11
bear 11
the 11
burthen 11
of 11
it 11
this 11
was 11
so 11
perpetually 11
recurrent 11
that 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
part 11
of 11
a 11
fixed 11
policy 11
it 11
was 11
no 11
wonder 11
that 11
whatever 11
changes 11
took 11
place 11
they 11
were 11
always 11
ensured 11
in 11
their 11
own 11
possessions 11
they 11
were 11
absolutely 11
cold 11
and 11
hard 11
by 11
nature 11
not 11
one 11
of 11
themso 11
far 11
as 11
we 11
have 11
any 11
knowledgewas 11
ever 11
known 11
to 11
be 11
touched 11
by 11
the 11
softer 11
sentiments 11
to 11
swerve 11
from 11
his 11
purpose 11
or 11
hold 11
his 11
hand 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
the 11
dictates 11
of 11
his 11
heart 11
the 11
pictures 11
and 11
effigies 11
of 11
them 11
all 11
show 11
their 11
adherence 11
to 11
the 11
early 11
roman 11
type 11
their 11
eyes 11
were 11
full 11
their 11
hair 11
of 11
raven 11
blackness 11
grew 11
thick 11
and 11
close 11
and 11
curly 11
their 11
figures 11
were 11
massive 11
and 11
typical 11
of 11
strength 11
the 11
thick 11
black 11
hair 11
growing 11
low 11
down 11
on 11
the 11
neck 11
told 11
of 11
vast 11
physical 11
strength 11
and 11
endurance 11
but 11
the 11
most 11
remarkable 11
characteristic 11
is 11
the 11
eyes 11
black 11
piercing 11
almost 11
unendurable 11
they 11
seem 11
to 11
contain 11
in 11
themselves 11
a 11
remarkable 11
will 11
power 11
which 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
gainsaying 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
power 11
that 11
is 11
partly 11
racial 11
and 11
partly 11
individual 11
a 11
power 11
impregnated 11
with 11
some 11
mysterious 11
quality 11
partly 11
hypnotic 11
partly 11
mesmeric 11
which 11
seems 11

you 11

adam 11
that 11
all 11
this 11
is 11
imagination 11
on 11
my 11
part 11
especially 11
as 11
i 11
have 11
never 11
seen 11
any 11
of 11
them 11
so 11
it 11
is 11
but 11
imagination 11
based 11
on 11
deep 11
study 11
i 11
have 11
made 11
use 11
of 11
all 11
i 11
know 11
or 11
can 11
surmise 11
logically 11
regarding 11
this 11
strange 11
race 11
with 11
such 11
strange 11
compelling 11
qualities 11
is 11
it 11
any 11
wonder 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
abroad 11
an 11
idea 11
that 11
in 11
the 11
race 11
there 11
is 11
some 11
demoniac 11
possession 11
which 11
tends 11
to 11
a 11
more 11
definite 11
belief 11
that 11
certain 11
individuals 11
have 11
in 11
the 11
past 11
sold 11
themselves 11
to 11
the 11
devil 11
but 11
i 11
think 11
we 11
had 11
better 11
go 11
to 11
bed 11
now 11
we 11
have 11
a 11
lot 11
to 11
get 11
through 11
tomorrow 11
and 11
i 11
want 11
you 11
to 11
have 11
your 11
brain 11
clear 11
and 11
all 11
your 11
susceptibilities 11
fresh 11
moreover 11
i 11
want 11
you 11
to 11
come 11
with 11
me 11
for 11
an 11
early 11
walk 11
during 11
which 11
we 11
may 11
notice 11
whilst 11
the 11
matter 11
is 11
fresh 11
in 11
our 11

the 11

around 11
it 11
there 11
are 11
many 11
things 11
on 11
which 11
we 11
may 11
seekand 11
perhaps 11
find 11
enlightenment 11
the 11
more 11
we 11
know 11
at 11

the 11

salton 11
out 11
of 11
bed 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
but 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
dressed 11
and 11
gone 11
downstairs 11
he 11
found 11
that 11
early 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
ahead 11
of 11
him 11
the 11
old 11
gentleman 11
was 11
quite 11
prepared 11
for 11
a 11
long 11
walk 11
and 11
they 11
started 11
at 11
once 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
without 11
speaking 11
led 11
the 11
way 11
to 11
the 11
east 11
down 11
the 11
hill 11
when 11
they 11
had 11
descended 11
and 11
risen 11
again 11
they 11
found 11
themselves 11
on 11
the 11
eastern 11
brink 11
of 11
a 11
steep 11
hill 11
it 11
was 11
of 11
lesser 11
height 11
than 11
that 11
on 11
which 11
the 11
castle 11
was 11
situated 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
so 11
placed 11
that 11
it 11
commanded 11
the 11
various 11
hills 11
that 11
crowned 11
the 11
ridge 11
all 11
along 11
the 11
ridge 11
the 11
rock 11
cropped 11
out 11
bare 11
and 11
bleak 11
but 11
broken 11
in 11
rough 11
natural 11
castellation 11
the 11
form 11
of 11
the 11
ridge 11
was 11
a 11
segment 11
of 11
a 11
circle 11
with 11
the 11
higher 11
points 11
inland 11
to 11
the 11
west 11
in 11
the 11
centre 11
rose 11
the 11
castle 11
on 11
the 11
highest 11
point 11
of 11
all 11
between 11
the 11
various 11
rocky 11
excrescences 11
were 11
groups 11
of 11
trees 11
of 11
various 11
sizes 11
and 11
heights 11
amongst 11
some 11
of 11
which 11
were 11
what 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
light 11
looked 11
like 11
ruins 11

werewere 11

massive 11
grey 11

were 11
not 11
shaped 11
naturally 11
the 11
fall 11
of 11
the 11
ground 11
was 11
steep 11
all 11
along 11
the 11
ridge 11
so 11
steep 11
that 11
here 11
and 11
there 11
both 11
trees 11
and 11
rocks 11
and 11
buildings 11
seemed 11
to 11
overhang 11
the 11
plain 11
far 11
below 11
through 11
which 11
ran 11
many 11
streams 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
stopped 11
and 11
looked 11
around 11
as 11
though 11
to 11
lose 11
nothing 11
of 11
the 11
effect 11
the 11
sun 11
had 11
climbed 11
the 11
eastern 11
sky 11
and 11
was 11
making 11
all 11
details 11
clear 11
he 11
pointed 11
with 11
a 11
sweeping 11
gesture 11
as 11
though 11
calling 11
adams 11
attention 11
to 11
the 11
extent 11
of 11
the 11
view 11
having 11
done 11
so 11
he 11
covered 11
the 11
ground 11
more 11
slowly 11
as 11
though 11
inviting 11
attention 11
to 11
detail 11
adam 11
was 11
a 11
willing 11

brought 11
you 11
here 11
adam 11
because 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
this 11
is 11
the 11
spot 11
on 11
which 11
to 11
begin 11
our 11
investigations 11
you 11
have 11
now 11
in 11

the 11

is 11
covered 11
by 11

those 11

are 11
hidden 11
from 11

well 11
to 11
have 11
it 11
in 11
our 11

when 11
we 11

are 11
trying 11

the 11
rationale 11
of 11
them 11
each 11
legend 11
each 11
superstition 11
which 11
we 11
receive 11
will 11

in 11
the 11
understanding 11
and 11
possible 11
elucidation 11
of 11
the 11
others 11

as 11
all 11
such 11
have 11
a 11
local 11

we 11
can 11

knowing 11
the 11
local 11

along 11
it 11
will 11

us 11
to 11
bring 11
to 11

such 11
geological 11
truth 11

we 11
may 11

for 11

the 11
building 11
materials 11

in 11

sir 11
said 11
adam 11
venturing 11
a 11
question 11
well 11
look 11
at 11
those 11
hills 11
which 11
surround 11
the 11
main 11
one 11
where 11
the 11
site 11
for 11
the 11
castle 11
was 11
wisely 11
chosenon 11
the 11
highest 11
ground 11
take 11
the 11
others 11
there 11
is 11
something 11
ostensible 11
in 11
each 11
of 11
them 11
and 11
in 11
all 11
probability 11
something 11
unseen 11
and 11
unproved 11
but 11
to 11
be 11
imagined 11
also 11
for 11

continued 11
adam 11

us 11
take 11
them 11

to 11
the 11
east 11
where 11
the 11
trees 11
are 11
lower 11
downthat 11
was 11
once 11
the 11
location 11
of 11
a 11
roman 11
temple 11
possibly 11
founded 11
on 11
a 11
preexisting 11
druidical 11
one 11
its 11
name 11
implies 11
the 11
former 11
and 11
the 11
grove 11
of 11
ancient 11
oaks 11
suggests 11
the 11
latter 11
please 11
explain 11
the 11
old 11
name 11
translated 11

the 11
next 11

just 11
beyond 11
it 11
is 11
called 11
mercyin 11
all 11
probability 11
a 11
corruption 11
or 11
familiarisation 11
of 11
the 11
word 11
mercia 11
with 11
a 11
roman 11
pun 11
included 11
we 11
learn 11
from 11
early 11
manuscripts 11
that 11
the 11
place 11
was 11
called 11
vilula 11
misericordiae 11
it 11
was 11
originally 11
a 11
nunnery 11
founded 11
by 11
queen 11
bertha 11
but 11
done 11
away 11

though 11
it 11
is 11
so 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
castle 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
connected 11
with 11
it 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
freehold 11
and 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
we 11
know 11
of 11
equal 11
age 11
it 11
has 11
always 11
belonged 11
to 11
your 11

then 11
there 11
only 11
remains 11
the 11

that 11
is 11
all 11
but 11
its 11
history 11
contains 11
the 11
histories 11
of 11
all 11

the 11
expectant 11
look 11

went 11
on 11
the 11
history 11
of 11
the 11

has 11
no 11
beginning 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
we 11
know 11
the 11
furthest 11

some 11
of 11
theseguesses 11
let 11
us 11
call 11
themseem 11
to 11
show 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
structure 11
there 11
when 11
the 11
romans 11
came 11
therefore 11
it 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
a 11
place 11
of 11
importance 11
in 11
druid 11
timesif 11
indeed 11
that 11
was 11
the 11
beginning 11
naturally 11
the 11
romans 11
accepted 11
it 11
as 11
they 11
did 11
everything 11
of 11
the 11
kind 11
that 11
was 11
or 11
might 11
be 11
useful 11
the 11

is 11
shown 11
or 11
inferred 11
in 11
the 11
name 11
castra 11
it 11
was 11
the 11
highest 11
protected 11
ground 11
and 11
so 11
naturally 11
became 11
the 11
most 11
important 11
of 11

that 11

important 11

both 11
protected 11
the 11
advances 11
already 11
made 11
to 11
the 11
north 11

helped 11
to 11
dominate 11
the 11

round 11
which 11
lay 11
the 11
great 11

the 11

all 11

such 11
a 11
centre 11
already 11
known 11
and 11
organised 11
we 11
can 11
easily 11
see 11

angles 11
the 11
saxons 11

danes 11
and 11
the 11
normansfound 11
it 11
a 11
desirable 11
possession 11
and 11
so 11
ensured 11
its 11
upholding 11
in 11
the 11
earlier 11
centuries 11
it 11
was 11
merely 11
a 11
vantage 11
ground 11
but 11
when 11
the 11
victorious 11
romans 11
brought 11
with 11
them 11
the 11
heavy 11
solid 11
fortifications 11
impregnable 11
to 11
the 11
weapons 11
of 11
the 11
time 11
its 11
commanding 11
position 11
alone 11
ensured 11
its 11
adequate 11
building 11
and 11
equipment 11
then 11
it 11
was 11
that 11
the 11
fortified 11
camp 11
of 11
the 11
caesars 11
developed 11
into 11
the 11
castle 11
of 11
the 11
king 11
as 11
we 11
are 11
as 11
yet 11
ignorant 11
of 11
the 11
names 11
of 11
the 11
first 11
kings 11
of 11
mercia 11
no 11
historian 11
has 11
been 11
able 11
to 11
guess 11
which 11
of 11
them 11
made 11
it 11
his 11
ultimate 11
defence 11
and 11
i 11
suppose 11
we 11
shall 11
never 11
know 11
now 11
in 11
process 11
of 11
time 11
as 11
the 11
arts 11
of 11
war 11
developed 11
it 11
increased 11
in 11
size 11
and 11
strength 11
and 11
although 11
recorded 11
details 11
are 11
lacking 11
the 11
history 11
is 11
written 11
not 11
merely 11
in 11
the 11
stone 11
of 11
its 11
building 11
but 11
is 11
inferred 11
in 11
the 11
changes 11
of 11
structure 11
then 11
the 11
sweeping 11
changes 11
which 11
followed 11
the 11
norman 11
conquest 11
wiped 11
out 11
all 11
lesser 11
records 11
than 11
its 11
own 11
today 11
we 11
must 11
accept 11
it 11
as 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
earliest 11
castles 11
of 11
the 11
conquest 11
probably 11
not 11
later 11
than 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
henry 11
i 11
roman 11
and 11
norman 11
were 11
both 11
wise 11
in 11
their 11
retention 11
of 11
places 11
of 11
approved 11
strength 11
or 11
utility 11
so 11
it 11
was 11
that 11
these 11
surrounding 11
heights 11
already 11
established 11
and 11
to 11
a 11
certain 11
extent 11
proved 11
were 11
retained 11
indeed 11
such 11
characteristics 11
as 11
already 11
pertained 11
to 11
them 11
were 11
preserved 11
and 11
today 11
afford 11
to 11
us 11
lessons 11
regarding 11
things 11
which 11
have 11
themselves 11
long 11
since 11
passed 11
away 11
so 11
much 11
for 11
the 11
fortified 11
heights 11
but 11
the 11
hollows 11
too 11
have 11
their 11
own 11
story 11
but 11
how 11
the 11
time 11
passes 11
we 11
must 11
hurry 11
home 11
or 11
your 11
uncle 11
will 11
wonder 11
what 11
has 11
become 11
of 11
us 11
he 11
started 11
with 11
long 11
steps 11
towards 11

and 11
adam 11
was 11
soon 11
furtively 11
running 11
in 11
order 11

beforehand 11

confidence 11
in 11

their 11
orders 11

were 11
quickly 11
on 11
their 11
way 11
at 11
an 11
exhilarating 11
pace 11
presently 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
mr 11
saltons 11
signal 11
the 11

not 11
pass 11
by 11

of 11
such 11
accurate 11
knowledge 11
as 11
there 11
is 11
whilst 11
they 11
were 11
looking 11
at 11
the 11
heap 11
of 11
stones 11
they 11
noticed 11
that 11
another 11
carriage 11
had 11
drawn 11
up 11
beside 11
them 11
and 11

curiously 11

an 11
old 11
heavy 11
travelling 11
one 11
with 11
arms 11
blazoned 11
on 11
it 11
gorgeously 11
the 11
men 11
took 11
off 11
their 11
hats 11
as 11
the 11
occupant 11
a 11
lady 11
addressed 11

at 11

as 11
she 11
spoke 11
she 11
pointed 11
to 11
where 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
heavy 11
springs 11
was 11
broken 11
across 11
the 11
broken 11
metal 11
showing 11
bright 11
adam 11
spoke 11
up 11
at 11
once 11
oh 11

she 11
looked 11
incredulously 11
at 11

dapper 11
young 11

who 11
spoke 11

wish 11
to 11
meet 11
mr 11
caswall 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
who 11
arrives 11
home 11
from 11
africa 11
today 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
notable 11
homecoming 11
all 11
the 11
countryside 11
want 11
to 11
do 11
him 11
honour 11
she 11
looked 11
at 11
the 11
old 11
men 11
and 11
quickly 11
made 11
up 11
her 11
mind 11
as 11
to 11
the 11
identity 11
of 11
the 11
stranger 11
you 11
must 11
be 11
mr 11
adam 11
salton 11
of 11

i 11
am 11
lady 11
arabella 11
march 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
as 11
she 11
spoke 11
she 11
turned 11
slightly 11
to 11
mr 11
salton 11
who 11
took 11
the 11
hint 11
and 11
made 11
a 11
formal 11
introduction 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
this 11
was 11
done 11
adam 11
took 11
some 11
tools 11
from 11
his 11
uncles 11
carriage 11
and 11
at 11
once 11
began 11
work 11
on 11
the 11
broken 11
spring 11
he 11
was 11
an 11
expert 11
workman 11
and 11
the 11
breach 11
was 11
soon 11
made 11
good 11
adam 11
was 11
gathering 11
the 11
tools 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
usingwhich 11
after 11
the 11
manner 11
of 11
all 11
workmen 11
had 11
been 11
scattered 11
aboutwhen 11
he 11
noticed 11
that 11
several 11
black 11
snakes 11
had 11
crawled 11
out 11
from 11
the 11
heap 11
of 11
stones 11
and 11
were 11
gathering 11
round 11
him 11
this 11
naturally 11
occupied 11
his 11
mind 11
and 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
thinking 11
of 11
anything 11
else 11
when 11
he 11
noticed 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
had 11
opened 11
the 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
carriage 11
slip 11
from 11
it 11
with 11
a 11
quick 11
gliding 11
motion 11
she 11
was 11
already 11
among 11
the 11
snakes 11
when 11
he 11
called 11
out 11
to 11
warn 11
her 11
but 11
there 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
no 11
need 11
of 11
warning 11
the 11
snakes 11
had 11
turned 11
and 11
were 11
wriggling 11
back 11
to 11
the 11
mound 11
as 11
quickly 11
as 11
they 11
could 11
he 11
laughed 11
to 11
himself 11
behind 11
his 11
teeth 11
as 11
he 11
whispered 11
no 11
need 11
to 11
fear 11
there 11
they 11
seem 11
much 11
more 11
afraid 11
of 11
her 11
than 11
she 11
of 11
them 11
all 11
the 11
same 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
beat 11
on 11
the 11
ground 11
with 11
a 11
stick 11
which 11
was 11
lying 11
close 11
to 11
him 11
with 11
the 11
instinct 11
of 11
one 11
used 11
to 11
such 11
vermin 11
in 11
an 11
instant 11
he 11
was 11
alone 11
beside 11
the 11
mound 11
with 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
appeared 11
quite 11
unconcerned 11
at 11
the 11
incident 11
then 11
he 11
took 11
a 11
long 11
look 11
at 11
her 11
and 11
her 11
dress 11
alone 11
was 11
sufficient 11
to 11
attract 11
attention 11
she 11
was 11
clad 11
in 11
some 11
kind 11
of 11
soft 11
white 11
stuff 11
which 11
clung 11
close 11
to 11
her 11
form 11
showing 11
to 11
the 11
full 11
every 11
movement 11
of 11
her 11
sinuous 11
figure 11
she 11
wore 11
a 11
closefitting 11
cap 11
of 11
some 11
fine 11
fur 11
of 11
dazzling 11
white 11
coiled 11
round 11
her 11
white 11
throat 11
was 11
a 11
large 11
necklace 11
of 11
emeralds 11
whose 11
profusion 11
of 11
colour 11
dazzled 11
when 11
the 11
sun 11
shone 11
on 11
them 11
her 11
voice 11
was 11
peculiar 11
very 11
low 11
and 11
sweet 11
and 11
so 11
soft 11
that 11
the 11
dominant 11
note 11
was 11
of 11
sibilation 11
her 11
hands 11
too 11
were 11
peculiarlong 11
flexible 11
white 11
with 11
a 11
strange 11
movement 11
as 11
of 11
waving 11
gently 11
to 11
and 11
fro 11
she 11
appeared 11
quite 11
at 11
ease 11
and 11
after 11
thanking 11
adam 11
said 11
that 11
if 11
any 11
of 11
his 11
uncles 11
party 11
were 11
going 11
to 11
liverpool 11
she 11
would 11
be 11
most 11
happy 11
to 11
join 11
forces 11
whilst 11
you 11
are 11
staying 11
here 11
mr 11
salton 11
you 11
must 11
look 11
on 11
the 11
grounds 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
as 11
your 11
own 11
so 11
that 11
you 11
may 11
come 11
and 11
go 11
just 11
as 11
you 11
do 11
in 11
lesser 11
hill 11
there 11
are 11
some 11
fine 11
views 11
and 11
not 11
a 11
few 11
natural 11
curiosities 11
which 11
are 11
sure 11
to 11
interest 11
you 11
if 11
you 11
are 11
a 11
student 11
of 11
natural 11
historyspecially 11
of 11
an 11
earlier 11
kind 11
when 11
the 11
world 11
was 11
younger 11
the 11
heartiness 11
with 11
which 11
she 11
spoke 11
and 11
the 11
warmth 11
of 11
her 11
words 11
not 11
of 11
her 11
manner 11
which 11
was 11
cold 11
and 11
distantmade 11
him 11
suspicious 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
both 11
his 11
uncle 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
thanked 11
her 11
for 11
the 11
invitationof 11
which 11
however 11
they 11
said 11
they 11
were 11
unable 11
to 11
avail 11
themselves 11
adam 11
had 11
a 11
suspicion 11
that 11
though 11
she 11
answered 11
regretfully 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
reality 11
relieved 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
got 11
into 11
the 11
carriage 11
with 11
the 11
two 11
old 11
men 11
and 11
they 11
had 11
driven 11
off 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
surprised 11
when 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
spoke 11
i 11
could 11
not 11
but 11
feel 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
glad 11
to 11
be 11
rid 11
of 11
us 11
she 11
can 11
play 11
her 11
game 11
better 11
alone 11
what 11
is 11
her 11
game 11
asked 11
adam 11
unthinkingly 11
all 11
the 11
county 11
knows 11
it 11
my 11
boy 11
caswall 11
is 11
a 11
very 11
rich 11
man 11
her 11
husband 11
was 11
rich 11
when 11
she 11
married 11
himor 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
when 11
he 11
committed 11
suicide 11
it 11
was 11
found 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
nothing 11
left 11
and 11
the 11
estate 11
was 11
mortgaged 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
hilt 11
her 11
only 11
hope 11
is 11
in 11
a 11
rich 11
marriage 11
i 11
suppose 11
i 11
need 11
not 11
draw 11
any 11
conclusion 11
you 11
can 11
do 11
that 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
i 11
can 11
adam 11
remained 11
silent 11
nearly 11
all 11
the 11
time 11
they 11
were 11
travelling 11
through 11
the 11
alleged 11
vale 11
of 11
cheshire 11
he 11
thought 11
much 11
during 11
that 11
journey 11
and 11
came 11
to 11
several 11
conclusions 11
though 11
his 11
lips 11
were 11
unmoved 11
one 11
of 11
these 11
conclusions 11
was 11
that 11
he 11
would 11
be 11
very 11
careful 11
about 11
paying 11
any 11
attention 11
to 11
lady 11
arabella 11
he 11
was 11
himself 11
a 11
rich 11
man 11
how 11
rich 11
not 11
even 11
his 11
uncle 11
had 11
the 11
least 11
idea 11
and 11
would 11
have 11
been 11
surprised 11
had 11
he 11
known 11
the 11
remainder 11
of 11
the 11
journey 11
was 11
uneventful 11
and 11
upon 11
arrival 11
at 11
liverpool 11
they 11
went 11
aboard 11
the 11
west 11
african 11
which 11
had 11
just 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
landingstage 11
there 11
his 11
uncle 11
introduced 11
himself 11
to 11
mr 11
caswall 11
and 11
followed 11
this 11
up 11
by 11
introducing 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
then 11
adam 11
the 11
newcomer 11
received 11
them 11
graciously 11
and 11
said 11
what 11
a 11
pleasure 11
it 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
coming 11
home 11
after 11
so 11
long 11
an 11
absence 11
of 11
his 11
family 11
from 11
their 11
old 11
seat 11
adam 11
was 11
pleased 11
at 11
the 11
warmth 11
of 11
the 11
reception 11
but 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
avoid 11
a 11
feeling 11
of 11
repugnance 11
at 11
the 11
mans 11
face 11
he 11
was 11
trying 11
hard 11
to 11
overcome 11
this 11
when 11
a 11
diversion 11
was 11
caused 11
by 11
the 11
arrival 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
the 11
diversion 11
was 11
welcome 11
to 11
all 11
the 11
two 11
saltons 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
were 11
shocked 11
at 11
caswalls 11
faceso 11
hard 11
so 11
ruthless 11
so 11
selfish 11
so 11
dominant 11
god 11
help 11
any 11
was 11
the 11
common 11
thought 11
who 11
is 11
under 11
the 11
domination 11
of 11
such 11
a 11
man 11
presently 11
his 11
african 11
servant 11
approached 11
him 11
and 11
at 11
once 11
their 11
thoughts 11
changed 11
to 11
a 11
larger 11
toleration 11
caswall 11
looked 11
indeed 11
a 11
savagebut 11
a 11
cultured 11
savage 11
in 11
him 11
were 11
traces 11
of 11
the 11
softening 11
civilisation 11
of 11
agesof 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
higher 11
instincts 11
and 11
education 11
of 11
man 11
no 11
matter 11
how 11
rudimentary 11
these 11
might 11
be 11
but 11
the 11
face 11
of 11
oolanga 11
as 11
his 11
master 11
called 11
him 11
was 11
unreformed 11
unsoftened 11
savage 11
and 11
inherent 11
in 11
it 11
were 11
all 11
the 11
hideous 11
possibilities 11
of 11
a 11
lost 11
devilridden 11
child 11
of 11
the 11
forest 11
and 11
the 11
swampthe 11
lowest 11
of 11
all 11
created 11
things 11
that 11
could 11
be 11
regarded 11
as 11
in 11
some 11
form 11
ostensibly 11
human 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
oolanga 11
arrived 11
almost 11
simultaneously 11
and 11
adam 11
was 11
surprised 11
to 11
notice 11
what 11
effect 11
their 11
appearance 11
had 11
on 11
each 11
other 11
the 11
woman 11
seemed 11
as 11
if 11
she 11
would 11
notcould 11
not 11
condescend 11
to 11
exhibit 11
any 11
concern 11
or 11
interest 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
creature 11
on 11
the 11
other 11
hand 11
the 11
negros 11
bearing 11
was 11
such 11
as 11
in 11
itself 11
to 11
justify 11
her 11
pride 11
he 11
treated 11
her 11
not 11
merely 11
as 11
a 11
slave 11
treats 11
his 11
master 11
but 11
as 11
a 11
worshipper 11
would 11
treat 11
a 11
deity 11
he 11
knelt 11
before 11
her 11
with 11
his 11
hands 11
outstretched 11
and 11
his 11
forehead 11
in 11
the 11
dust 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
she 11
remained 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
move 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
when 11
she 11
went 11
over 11
to 11
caswall 11
that 11
he 11
relaxed 11
his 11
attitude 11
of 11
devotion 11
and 11
stood 11
by 11
respectfully 11
adam 11
spoke 11
to 11
his 11
own 11
man 11
davenport 11
who 11
was 11
standing 11
by 11
having 11
arrived 11
with 11
the 11
bailiff 11
of 11
lesser 11
hill 11
who 11
had 11
followed 11
mr 11
salton 11
in 11
a 11
pony 11
trap 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
he 11
pointed 11
to 11
an 11
attentive 11
ships 11
steward 11
and 11
presently 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
were 11
conversing 11
i 11
think 11
we 11
ought 11
to 11
be 11
moving 11
mr 11
salton 11
said 11
to 11
adam 11

some 11
things 11
to 11

am 11
sure 11
that 11
both 11
mr 11
caswall 11
and 11
lady 11
arabella 11
would 11
like 11
to 11

the 11

of 11

explanation 11

needed 11
when 11

with 11
curiosity 11

thought 11

come 11

returned 11
home 11
leaving 11

to 11

following 11
day 11

lesser 11
hill 11
party 11
set 11
out 11
for 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
for 11
the 11
time 11
adam 11
thought 11
no 11
more 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
or 11
of 11
what 11
mysteries 11
it 11
had 11
containedor 11
might 11
still 11
contain 11
the 11
guests 11
were 11
crowding 11
in 11
and 11
special 11
places 11
were 11
marked 11
for 11
important 11
people 11
adam 11
seeing 11
so 11
many 11
persons 11
of 11
varied 11
degree 11
looked 11
round 11
for 11
lady 11
arabella 11
but 11
could 11
not 11
locate 11
her 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
when 11
he 11
saw 11
the 11
oldfashioned 11
travelling 11
carriage 11
approach 11
and 11
heard 11
the 11
sound 11
of 11
cheering 11
which 11
went 11
with 11
it 11
that 11
he 11
realised 11
that 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
had 11
arrived 11
then 11
on 11
looking 11
more 11
closely 11
he 11
saw 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
dressed 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
seen 11
her 11
last 11
was 11
seated 11
beside 11
him 11
when 11
the 11
carriage 11
drew 11
up 11
at 11
the 11
great 11
flight 11
of 11
steps 11
the 11
host 11
jumped 11
down 11
and 11
gave 11
her 11
his 11
hand 11
it 11
was 11
evident 11
to 11
all 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
the 11
chief 11
guest 11
at 11
the 11
festivities 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
long 11
before 11
the 11
seats 11
on 11
the 11
dais 11
were 11
filled 11
while 11
the 11
tenants 11
and 11
guests 11
of 11
lesser 11
importance 11
had 11
occupied 11
all 11
the 11
coigns 11
of 11
vantage 11
not 11
reserved 11
the 11
order 11
of 11
the 11
day 11
had 11
been 11
carefully 11
arranged 11
by 11
a 11
committee 11
there 11
were 11
some 11
speeches 11
happily 11
neither 11
many 11
nor 11
long 11
and 11
then 11
festivities 11
were 11
suspended 11
till 11
the 11
time 11
for 11
feasting 11
arrived 11
in 11
the 11
interval 11
caswall 11
walked 11
among 11
his 11
guests 11
speaking 11
to 11
all 11
in 11
a 11
friendly 11
manner 11
and 11
expressing 11
a 11
general 11
welcome 11
the 11
other 11
guests 11
came 11
down 11
from 11
the 11
dais 11
and 11
followed 11
his 11
example 11
so 11
there 11
was 11
unceremonious 11
meeting 11
and 11
greeting 11
between 11
gentle 11
and 11
simple 11
adam 11
salton 11
naturally 11
followed 11
with 11
his 11
eyes 11
all 11
that 11
went 11
on 11
within 11
their 11
scope 11
taking 11
note 11
of 11
all 11
who 11
seemed 11
to 11
afford 11
any 11
interest 11
he 11
was 11
young 11
and 11
a 11
man 11
and 11
a 11
stranger 11
from 11
a 11
far 11
distance 11
so 11
on 11
all 11
these 11
accounts 11
he 11
naturally 11
took 11
stock 11
rather 11
of 11
the 11
women 11
than 11
of 11
the 11
men 11
and 11
of 11
these 11
those 11
who 11
were 11
young 11
and 11
attractive 11
there 11
were 11
lots 11
of 11
pretty 11
girls 11
among 11
the 11
crowd 11
and 11
adam 11
who 11
was 11
a 11
handsome 11
young 11
man 11
and 11
well 11
set 11
up 11
got 11
his 11
full 11
share 11
of 11
admiring 11
glances 11
these 11
did 11
not 11
concern 11
him 11
much 11
and 11
he 11
remained 11
unmoved 11
until 11
there 11
came 11
along 11
a 11
group 11
of 11
three 11
by 11
their 11
dress 11
and 11
bearing 11
of 11
the 11
farmer 11
class 11
one 11
was 11
a 11
sturdy 11
old 11
man 11
the 11
other 11
two 11
were 11
goodlooking 11
girls 11
one 11
of 11
a 11
little 11
over 11
twenty 11
the 11
other 11
not 11
quite 11
so 11
old 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
adams 11
eyes 11
met 11
those 11
of 11
the 11
younger 11
girl 11
who 11
stood 11
nearest 11
to 11
him 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
electricity 11
flashedthat 11
divine 11
spark 11
which 11
begins 11
by 11
recognition 11
and 11
ends 11
in 11
obedience 11
men 11
call 11
it 11
love 11
both 11
his 11
companions 11
noticed 11
how 11
much 11
adam 11
was 11
taken 11
by 11
the 11
pretty 11
girl 11
and 11
spoke 11
of 11
her 11
to 11
him 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
which 11
made 11
his 11
heart 11
warm 11
to 11
them 11
did 11

the 11
girls 11

his 11
granddaughters 11

being 11
the 11
only 11
child 11
of 11
his 11
elder 11
son 11
who 11
died 11
when 11
she 11
was 11
less 11
than 11
a 11
year 11
old 11
his 11
wife 11
died 11
on 11
the 11
same 11
day 11
she 11
is 11
a 11
good 11
girlas 11
good 11
as 11
she 11
is 11
pretty 11
the 11
other 11

her 11
first 11
cousin 11
the 11
daughter 11
of 11
watfords 11
second 11
son 11
he 11
went 11
for 11
a 11
soldier 11
when 11
he 11
was 11
just 11
over 11
twenty 11
and 11
was 11
drafted 11
abroad 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
a 11
good 11
correspondent 11
though 11
he 11
was 11
a 11
good 11
enough 11
son 11
a 11
few 11
letters 11
came 11
and 11
then 11
his 11
father 11
heard 11
from 11
the 11
colonel 11
of 11
his 11
regiment 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
killed 11
by 11
dacoits 11
in 11
burmah 11
he 11
heard 11
from 11
the 11
same 11
source 11
that 11
his 11
boy 11
had 11
been 11
married 11
to 11
a 11
burmese 11
and 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
daughter 11
only 11
a 11
year 11
old 11
watford 11
had 11
the 11
child 11
brought 11
home 11
and 11
she 11
grew 11
up 11
beside 11
lilla 11
the 11
only 11
thing 11
that 11
they 11
heard 11
of 11
her 11
birth 11
was 11
that 11
her 11
name 11
was 11
mimi 11
the 11
two 11
children 11
adored 11
each 11
other 11
and 11
do 11
to 11
this 11
day 11
strange 11
how 11
different 11
they 11
are 11
lilla 11
all 11
fair 11
like 11
the 11
old 11
saxon 11
stock 11
from 11
which 11
she 11
is 11
sprung 11
mimi 11
showing 11
a 11
trace 11
of 11
her 11
mothers 11
race 11
lilla 11
is 11
as 11
gentle 11
as 11
a 11
dove 11
but 11
mimis 11
black 11
eyes 11
can 11
glow 11
whenever 11
she 11
is 11
upset 11
the 11
only 11
thing 11
that 11
upsets 11
her 11
is 11
when 11
anything 11
happens 11
to 11
injure 11
or 11
threaten 11
or 11
annoy 11
lilla 11
then 11
her 11
eyes 11
glow 11
as 11
do 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
a 11
bird 11
when 11
her 11
young 11
are 11
menaced 11

worm 11
mr 11
salton 11
introduced 11
adam 11
to 11
mr 11
watford 11
and 11
his 11
granddaughters 11
and 11
they 11
all 11
moved 11
on 11
together 11
of 11
course 11
neighbours 11
in 11
the 11
position 11
of 11
the 11
watfords 11
knew 11
all 11
about 11
adam 11
salton 11
his 11
relationship 11
circumstances 11
and 11
prospects 11
so 11
it 11
would 11
have 11
been 11
strange 11
indeed 11
if 11
both 11
girls 11
did 11
not 11
dream 11
of 11
possibilities 11
of 11
the 11
future 11
in 11
agricultural 11
england 11
eligible 11
men 11
of 11
any 11
class 11
are 11
rare 11
this 11
particular 11
man 11
was 11
specially 11
eligible 11
for 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
belong 11
to 11
a 11
class 11
in 11
which 11
barriers 11
of 11
caste 11
were 11
strong 11
so 11
when 11
it 11
began 11
to 11
be 11
noticed 11
that 11
he 11
walked 11
beside 11
mimi 11
watford 11
and 11
seemed 11
to 11
desire 11
her 11
society 11
all 11
their 11
friends 11
endeavoured 11
to 11
give 11
the 11
promising 11
affair 11
a 11
helping 11
hand 11
when 11
the 11
gongs 11
sounded 11
for 11
the 11
banquet 11
he 11
went 11
with 11
her 11
into 11
the 11
tent 11
where 11
her 11
grandfather 11
had 11
seats 11
mr 11
salton 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
noticed 11
that 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
did 11
not 11
come 11
to 11
claim 11
his 11
appointed 11
place 11
at 11
the 11
dais 11
table 11
but 11
they 11
understood 11
and 11
made 11
no 11
remark 11
or 11
indeed 11
did 11
not 11
seem 11

absence 11
lady 11
arabella 11
sat 11
as 11
before 11
at 11
edgar 11
caswalls 11
right 11
hand 11
she 11
was 11
certainly 11
a 11
striking 11
and 11
unusual 11
woman 11
and 11
to 11
all 11
it 11
seemed 11
fitting 11
from 11
her 11
rank 11
and 11
personal 11
qualities 11
that 11
she 11
should 11
be 11
the 11
chosen 11
partner 11
of 11
the 11
heir 11
on 11
his 11
first 11
appearance 11
of 11
course 11
nothing 11
was 11
said 11
openly 11
by 11
those 11
of 11
her 11
own 11
class 11
who 11
were 11
present 11
but 11
words 11
were 11
not 11
necessary 11
when 11
so 11
much 11
could 11
be 11
expressed 11
by 11
nods 11
and 11
smiles 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
an 11
accepted 11
thing 11
that 11
at 11
last 11
there 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
mistress 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
present 11
amongst 11
them 11
there 11
were 11
not 11
lacking 11
some 11
who 11
whilst 11
admitting 11
all 11
her 11
charm 11
and 11
beauty 11
placed 11
her 11
in 11
the 11
second 11
rank 11
lilla 11
watford 11
being 11
marked 11
as 11
first 11
there 11
was 11
sufficient 11
divergence 11
of 11
type 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
of 11
individual 11
beauty 11
to 11
allow 11
of 11
fair 11
comment 11
lady 11
arabella 11
represented 11
the 11
aristocratic 11
type 11
and 11
lilla 11
that 11
of 11
the 11
commonalty 11
when 11
the 11
dusk 11
began 11
to 11
thicken 11
mr 11
salton 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
walked 11
homethe 11
trap 11
had 11
been 11
sent 11
away 11
early 11
in 11
the 11
dayleaving 11
adam 11
to 11
follow 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
time 11
he 11
came 11
in 11
earlier 11
than 11
was 11
expected 11
and 11
seemed 11
upset 11
about 11
something 11
neither 11
of 11
the 11
elders 11
made 11
any 11
comment 11
they 11
all 11
lit 11
cigarettes 11
and 11
as 11
dinnertime 11
was 11
close 11
at 11
hand 11
went 11
to 11
their 11
rooms 11
to 11
get 11
ready 11
adam 11
had 11
evidently 11
been 11
thinking 11
in 11
the 11
interval 11
he 11
joined 11
the 11
others 11
in 11
the 11
drawingroom 11
looking 11
ruffled 11
and 11
impatienta 11
condition 11
of 11
things 11
seen 11
for 11
the 11
first 11
time 11
the 11
others 11
with 11
the 11
patienceor 11
the 11
experienceof 11
age 11
trusted 11
to 11
time 11
to 11
unfold 11
and 11
explain 11
things 11
they 11
had 11
not 11
long 11
to 11
wait 11
after 11
sitting 11
down 11
and 11
standing 11
up 11
several 11
times 11
adam 11
suddenly 11
burst 11
out 11
that 11
fellow 11
seems 11
to 11
think 11
he 11
owns 11
the 11
earth 11
cant 11
he 11
let 11
people 11
alone 11
he 11
seems 11
to 11
think 11
that 11
he 11
has 11
only 11
to 11
throw 11
his 11
handkerchief 11
to 11
any 11
woman 11
and 11
be 11
her 11
master 11
this 11
outburst 11
was 11
in 11
itself 11
enlightening 11
only 11
thwarted 11
affection 11
in 11
some 11
guise 11
could 11
produce 11
this 11
feeling 11
in 11
an 11
amiable 11
young 11
man 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
as 11
an 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
had 11
a 11
way 11
of 11
understanding 11
as 11
if 11
by 11
foreknowledge 11
the 11
true 11
inwardness 11
of 11
things 11
and 11
asked 11
suddenly 11
but 11
in 11
a 11
matteroffact 11
indifferent 11
voice 11
was 11
he 11
after 11
lilla 11
yes 11
and 11
the 11
fellow 11
didnt 11
lose 11
any 11
time 11
either 11
almost 11
as 11
soon 11
as 11
they 11
met 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
butter 11
her 11
up 11
and 11
tell 11
her 11
how 11
beautiful 11
she 11
was 11
why 11
before 11
he 11
left 11
her 11
side 11
he 11
had 11
asked 11
himself 11
to 11
tea 11
to 11
morrow 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
stupid 11
ass 11
he 11
might 11
see 11
that 11
the 11
girl 11
isnt 11
his 11
sort 11
i 11
never 11
saw 11
anything 11
like 11
it 11
it 11
was 11
just 11
like 11
a 11
hawk 11
and 11
a 11
pigeon 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
turned 11
and 11
looked 11
at 11
mr 11
saltona 11
keen 11
look 11
which 11
implied 11
a 11
full 11
understanding 11
tell 11
us 11
all 11
about 11
it 11
adam 11
there 11
are 11
still 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
before 11
dinner 11
and 11
we 11
shall 11
all 11
have 11
better 11
appetites 11
when 11
we 11
have 11
come 11
to 11
some 11
conclusion 11
on 11
this 11
matter 11
there 11
is 11
nothing 11
to 11
tell 11
sir 11
that 11
is 11
the 11
worst 11
of 11
it 11
i 11
am 11
bound 11
to 11
say 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
not 11
a 11
word 11
said 11
that 11
a 11
human 11
being 11
could 11
object 11
to 11
he 11
was 11
very 11
civil 11
and 11
all 11
that 11
was 11
properjust 11
what 11
a 11
landlord 11
might 11
be 11
to 11
a 11
tenants 11
daughter 11
yetyetwell 11
i 11
dont 11
know 11
how 11
it 11
was 11
but 11
it 11
made 11
my 11
blood 11
boil 11
how 11
did 11
the 11
hawk 11
and 11
the 11
pigeon 11
come 11
in 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
voice 11
was 11
soft 11
and 11
soothing 11
nothing 11
of 11
contradiction 11
or 11
overdone 11
curiosity 11
in 11
ita 11
tone 11
eminently 11
suited 11
to 11
win 11
confidence 11
i 11
can 11
hardly 11
explain 11
i 11
can 11
only 11
say 11
that 11
he 11
looked 11
like 11
a 11
hawk 11
and 11
she 11
like 11
a 11
doveand 11
now 11
that 11
i 11
think 11
of 11
it 11
that 11
is 11
what 11
they 11
each 11
did 11
look 11
like 11
and 11
do 11
look 11
like 11
in 11
their 11
normal 11
condition 11
that 11
is 11
so 11
came 11
the 11
soft 11
voice 11
of 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
adam 11
went 11
on 11
perhaps 11
that 11
early 11
roman 11
look 11
of 11
his 11
set 11
me 11
off 11
but 11
i 11
wanted 11
to 11
protect 11
her 11
she 11
seemed 11
in 11
danger 11
she 11
seems 11
in 11
danger 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
from 11
all 11
you 11
young 11
men 11
i 11
couldnt 11
help 11
noticing 11
the 11
way 11
that 11
even 11
you 11
lookedas 11
if 11
you 11
wished 11
to 11
absorb 11
her 11
i 11
hope 11
both 11
you 11
young 11
men 11
will 11
keep 11
your 11
heads 11
cool 11
put 11
in 11
mr 11
salton 11
you 11
know 11
adam 11
it 11
wont 11
do 11
to 11
have 11
any 11
quarrel 11
between 11
you 11
especially 11
so 11
soon 11
after 11
his 11
homecoming 11
and 11
your 11
arrival 11
here 11
we 11
must 11
think 11
of 11
the 11
feelings 11
and 11
happiness 11
of 11
our 11
neighbours 11
mustnt 11
we 11
i 11
hope 11
so 11
sir 11
i 11
assure 11
you 11
that 11
whatever 11
may 11
happen 11
or 11
even 11
threaten 11
i 11
shall 11
obey 11
your 11
wishes 11
in 11
this 11
as 11
in 11
all 11
things 11
hush 11
whispered 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
who 11
heard 11
the 11
servants 11
in 11
the 11
passage 11
bringing 11
dinner 11
after 11
dinner 11
over 11
the 11
walnuts 11
and 11
the 11
wine 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
returned 11
to 11
the 11
subject 11
of 11
the 11
local 11
legends 11
it 11
will 11
perhaps 11
be 11
a 11
less 11
dangerous 11
topic 11
for 11
us 11
to 11
discuss 11
than 11
more 11
recent 11
ones 11
all 11
right 11
sir 11
said 11
adam 11
heartily 11
i 11
think 11
you 11
may 11
depend 11
on 11
me 11
now 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
any 11
topic 11
i 11
can 11
even 11
discuss 11
mr 11
caswall 11
indeed 11
i 11
may 11
meet 11
him 11
tomorrow 11
he 11
is 11
going 11
as 11
i 11
said 11
to 11
call 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
at 11
three 11
oclockbut 11
i 11
have 11
an 11
appointment 11
at 11
two 11
i 11
notice 11
said 11
mr 11
salton 11
that 11
you 11
do 11
not 11
lose 11
any 11
time 11
the 11
two 11
old 11
men 11
once 11
more 11
looked 11
at 11
each 11
other 11
steadily 11
then 11
lest 11
the 11
mood 11
of 11
his 11
listener 11
should 11
change 11
with 11
delay 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
began 11
at 11
once 11
i 11
dont 11
propose 11
to 11
tell 11
you 11
all 11
the 11
legends 11
of 11
mercia 11
or 11
even 11
to 11
make 11
a 11
selection 11
of 11
them 11
it 11
will 11
be 11
better 11
i 11
think 11
for 11
our 11
purpose 11
if 11
we 11
consider 11
a 11
few 11
factsrecorded 11
or 11
unrecordedabout 11
this 11
neighbourhood 11
i 11
think 11
we 11
might 11
begin 11
with 11
dianas 11
grove 11
it 11
has 11
roots 11
in 11
the 11
different 11
epochs 11
of 11
our 11
history 11
and 11
each 11
has 11
its 11
special 11
crop 11
of 11
legend 11
the 11
druid 11
and 11
the 11
roman 11
are 11
too 11
far 11
off 11
for 11
matters 11
of 11
detail 11
but 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
the 11
saxon 11
and 11
the 11
angles 11
are 11
near 11
enough 11
to 11
yield 11
material 11
for 11
legendary 11
lore 11
we 11
find 11
that 11
this 11
particular 11
place 11
had 11
another 11
name 11
besides 11
dianas 11
grove 11
this 11
was 11
manifestly 11
of 11
roman 11
origin 11
or 11
of 11
grecian 11
accepted 11
as 11
roman 11
the 11
other 11
is 11
more 11
pregnant 11
of 11
adventure 11
and 11
romance 11
than 11
the 11
roman 11
name 11
in 11
mercian 11
tongue 11
it 11
was 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
this 11
needs 11
a 11
word 11
of 11
explanation 11
at 11
the 11
beginning 11
in 11
the 11
dawn 11
of 11
the 11
language 11
the 11
word 11
worm 11
had 11
a 11
somewhat 11
different 11
meaning 11
from 11
that 11
in 11
use 11
today 11
it 11
was 11
an 11
adaptation 11
of 11
the 11
anglosaxon 11
wyrm 11
meaning 11
a 11
dragon 11
or 11
snake 11
or 11
from 11
the 11
gothic 11
waurms 11
a 11
serpent 11
or 11
the 11
icelandic 11
ormur 11
or 11
the 11
german 11
wurm 11
we 11
gather 11
that 11
it 11
conveyed 11
originally 11
an 11
idea 11
of 11
size 11
and 11
power 11
not 11
as 11
now 11
in 11
the 11
diminutive 11
of 11
both 11
these 11
meanings 11
here 11
legendary 11
history 11
helps 11
us 11
we 11
have 11
the 11
wellknown 11
legend 11
of 11
the 11
worm 11
well 11
of 11
lambton 11
castle 11
and 11
that 11
of 11
the 11
laidly 11
worm 11
of 11
spindleston 11
heugh 11
near 11
bamborough 11
in 11
both 11
these 11
legends 11
the 11
worm 11
was 11

was 11

a 11
glance 11
at 11
a 11
geological 11

will 11
show 11
that 11
whatever 11
truth 11
there 11
may 11
have 11
been 11
of 11
the 11
actuality 11
of 11
such 11
monsters 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
geologic 11
periods 11
at 11
least 11
there 11
was 11
plenty 11
of 11
possibility 11
in 11
england 11
there 11
were 11
originally 11
vast 11
plains 11
where 11
the 11
plentiful 11
supply 11
of 11
water 11
could 11
gather 11
the 11
streams 11
were 11
deep 11
and 11
slow 11
and 11
there 11
were 11
holes 11
of 11
abysmal 11
depth 11
where 11
any 11
kind 11
and 11
size 11
of 11
antediluvian 11
monster 11
could 11
find 11
a 11
habitat 11
in 11
places 11
which 11
now 11
we 11
can 11
see 11
from 11
our 11
windows 11
were 11
mudholes 11
a 11
hundred 11
or 11
more 11
feet 11
deep 11
who 11
can 11
tell 11
us 11
when 11
the 11
age 11
of 11
the 11
monsters 11
which 11
flourished 11
in 11
slime 11
came 11
to 11
an 11
end 11
there 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
places 11
and 11
conditions 11
which 11
made 11
for 11
greater 11
longevity 11
greater 11
size 11
greater 11
strength 11
than 11
was 11
usual 11
such 11
overlappings 11
may 11
have 11
come 11
down 11
even 11
to 11
our 11
earlier 11
centuries 11
nay 11
are 11
there 11
not 11
now 11
creatures 11
of 11
a 11
vastness 11
of 11
bulk 11
regarded 11
by 11
the 11
generality 11
of 11
men 11
as 11
impossible 11
even 11
in 11
our 11
own 11
day 11
there 11
are 11
seen 11
the 11
traces 11
of 11

not 11

survivals 11
from 11

ages 11
preserved 11
by 11
some 11
special 11
qualities 11
in 11
their 11
habitats 11
i 11
remember 11
meeting 11
a 11
distinguished 11
man 11
in 11
india 11
who 11
had 11
the 11
reputation 11
of 11
being 11
a 11
great 11
shikaree 11
who 11
told 11
me 11
that 11
the 11
greatest 11
temptation 11
he 11
had 11
ever 11
had 11
in 11
his 11
life 11
was 11
to 11
shoot 11
a 11
giant 11
snake 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
come 11
across 11
in 11
the 11
terai 11
of 11
upper 11
india 11
he 11
was 11
on 11
a 11
tigershooting 11
expedition 11
and 11
as 11
his 11
elephant 11
was 11
crossing 11
a 11
nullah 11
it 11
squealed 11
he 11
looked 11
down 11
from 11
his 11
howdah 11
and 11
saw 11
that 11
the 11
elephant 11
had 11
stepped 11
across 11
the 11
body 11
of 11
a 11
snake 11
which 11
was 11
dragging 11
itself 11
through 11
the 11
jungle 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
i 11
could 11
see 11
he 11
said 11
it 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
eighty 11
or 11
one 11
hundred 11
feet 11
in 11
length 11
fully 11
forty 11
or 11
fifty 11
feet 11
was 11
on 11
each 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
track 11
and 11
though 11
the 11
weight 11
which 11
it 11
dragged 11
had 11
thinned 11
it 11
it 11
was 11
as 11
thick 11
round 11
as 11
a 11
mans 11
body 11
i 11
suppose 11
you 11
know 11
that 11
when 11
you 11
are 11
after 11
tiger 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
point 11
of 11
honour 11
not 11
to 11
shoot 11
at 11
anything 11
else 11
as 11
life 11
may 11
depend 11
on 11
it 11
i 11
could 11
easily 11
have 11
spined 11
this 11
monster 11
but 11
i 11
felt 11
that 11
i 11
must 11
notso 11
with 11
regret 11
i 11
had 11
to 11
let 11
it 11
go 11
just 11
imagine 11
such 11
a 11
monster 11
anywhere 11
in 11
this 11
country 11
and 11
at 11
once 11
we 11
could 11
get 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
idea 11
of 11
the 11
worms 11
which 11
possibly 11
did 11
frequent 11
the 11
great 11
morasses 11
which 11
spread 11
round 11
the 11
mouths 11
of 11
many 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
european 11
rivers 11
i 11
havent 11
the 11
least 11
doubt 11
sir 11
that 11
there 11
may 11
have 11
been 11
such 11
monsters 11
as 11
you 11
have 11
spoken 11
of 11
still 11
existing 11
at 11
a 11
much 11
later 11
period 11
than 11
is 11
generally 11
accepted 11
replied 11
adam 11
also 11
if 11
there 11
were 11
such 11
things 11
that 11
this 11
was 11
the 11
very 11
place 11
for 11
them 11
i 11
have 11
tried 11
to 11
think 11
over 11
the 11
matter 11
since 11
you 11
pointed 11
out 11
the 11
configuration 11
of 11
the 11
ground 11
but 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
a 11
hiatus 11
somewhere 11
are 11
there 11
not 11
mechanical 11
difficulties 11
in 11
what 11
way 11
well 11
our 11
antique 11
monster 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
mighty 11
heavy 11
and 11
the 11
distances 11
he 11
had 11
to 11
travel 11
were 11
long 11
and 11
the 11
ways 11
difficult 11
from 11
where 11
we 11
are 11
now 11
sitting 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
level 11
of 11
the 11
mudholes 11
is 11
a 11
distance 11
of 11
several 11
hundred 11
feeti 11
am 11
leaving 11
out 11
of 11
consideration 11
altogether 11
any 11
lateral 11
distance 11
is 11
it 11
possible 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
way 11
by 11
which 11
a 11
monster 11
could 11
travel 11
up 11
and 11
down 11
and 11
yet 11
no 11
chance 11
recorder 11
have 11
ever 11
seen 11
him 11
of 11
course 11
we 11
have 11
the 11
legends 11
but 11
is 11
not 11
some 11
more 11
exact 11
evidence 11
necessary 11
in 11
a 11
scientific 11
investigation 11
my 11
dear 11
adam 11
all 11
you 11
say 11
is 11
perfectly 11
right 11
and 11
were 11
we 11
starting 11
on 11
such 11
an 11
investigation 11
we 11
could 11
not 11
do 11
better 11
than 11
follow 11
your 11
reasoning 11
but 11
my 11
dear 11
boy 11
you 11
must 11
remember 11
that 11
all 11
this 11
took 11
place 11
thousands 11
of 11
years 11
ago 11
you 11
must 11
remember 11
too 11
that 11
all 11
records 11
of 11
the 11
kind 11
that 11
would 11
help 11
us 11
are 11
lacking 11
also 11
that 11
the 11
places 11
to 11
be 11
considered 11
were 11
desert 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
human 11
habitation 11
or 11
population 11
are 11
considered 11
in 11
the 11
vast 11
desolation 11
of 11
such 11
a 11
place 11
as 11
complied 11
with 11
the 11
necessary 11
conditions 11
there 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
such 11
profusion 11
of 11
natural 11
growth 11
as 11
would 11
bar 11
the 11
progress 11
of 11
men 11
formed 11
as 11
we 11
are 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
such 11
a 11
monster 11
would 11
not 11
have 11
been 11
disturbed 11
for 11
hundredsor 11
thousandsof 11
years 11
moreover 11
these 11
creatures 11
must 11
have 11
occupied 11
places 11
quite 11
inaccessible 11
to 11
man 11
a 11
snake 11
who 11
could 11
make 11
himself 11
comfortable 11
in 11
a 11
quagmire 11
a 11
hundred 11
feet 11
deep 11
would 11
be 11
protected 11
on 11
the 11
outskirts 11
by 11
such 11
stupendous 11
morasses 11
as 11
now 11
no 11
longer 11
exist 11
or 11
which 11
if 11
they 11
exist 11
anywhere 11
at 11
all 11
can 11
be 11
on 11
very 11
few 11
places 11
on 11
the 11
earths 11
surface 11
far 11
be 11
it 11
from 11
me 11
to 11
say 11
that 11
in 11
more 11
elemental 11
times 11
such 11
things 11
could 11
not 11
have 11
been 11
the 11
condition 11
belongs 11
to 11
the 11
geologic 11
agethe 11
great 11
birth 11
and 11
growth 11
of 11
the 11
world 11
when 11
natural 11
forces 11
ran 11
riot 11
when 11
the 11
struggle 11
for 11
existence 11
was 11
so 11
savage 11
that 11
no 11
vitality 11
which 11
was 11
not 11
founded 11
in 11
a 11
gigantic 11
form 11
could 11
have 11
even 11
a 11
possibility 11
of 11
survival 11
that 11
such 11
a 11
time 11
existed 11
we 11
have 11
evidences 11
in 11
geology 11
but 11
there 11
only 11
we 11
can 11
never 11
expect 11
proofs 11
such 11
as 11
this 11
age 11

only 11
imagine 11

surmise 11
such 11

breakfasttime 11
next 11
morning 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
mr 11
salton 11
were 11
seated 11
when 11
adam 11
came 11
hurriedly 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
any 11
news 11
asked 11
his 11
uncle 11
mechanically 11
four 11
four 11
what 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
snakes 11
said 11
adam 11
helping 11
himself 11
to 11
a 11
grilled 11
kidney 11
four 11
snakes 11
i 11
dont 11
understand 11
mongoose 11
said 11
adam 11
and 11
then 11
added 11
explanatorily 11
i 11
was 11
out 11
with 11
the 11
mongoose 11
just 11
after 11
three 11
four 11
snakes 11
in 11
one 11
morning 11
why 11
i 11
didnt 11
know 11
there 11
were 11
so 11
many 11
on 11
the 11
browthe 11
local 11
name 11
for 11
the 11
western 11
cliff 11
i 11
hope 11
that 11
wasnt 11
the 11
consequence 11
of 11
our 11
talk 11
of 11
last 11
night 11
it 11
was 11
sir 11
but 11
not 11
directly 11
but 11
god 11
bless 11
my 11
soul 11
you 11
didnt 11
expect 11
to 11
get 11
a 11
snake 11
like 11
the 11
lambton 11
worm 11
did 11
you 11
why 11
a 11
mongoose 11
to 11
tackle 11
a 11
monster 11
like 11
thatif 11
there 11
were 11
onewould 11
have 11
to 11
be 11
bigger 11
than 11
a 11
haystack 11
these 11
were 11
ordinary 11
snakes 11
about 11
as 11
big 11
as 11
a 11
walkingstick 11
well 11
its 11
pleasant 11
to 11
be 11
rid 11
of 11
them 11
big 11
or 11
little 11
that 11
is 11
a 11
good 11
mongoose 11
i 11
am 11
sure 11
hell 11
clear 11
out 11
all 11
such 11
vermin 11
round 11
here 11
said 11
mr 11
salton 11
adam 11
went 11
quietly 11
on 11
with 11
his 11
breakfast 11
killing 11
a 11
few 11
snakes 11
in 11
a 11
morning 11
was 11
no 11
new 11
experience 11
to 11
him 11
he 11
left 11
the 11
room 11
the 11
moment 11
breakfast 11
was 11
finished 11
and 11
went 11
to 11
the 11
study 11
that 11
his 11
uncle 11
had 11
arranged 11
for 11
him 11
both 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
mr 11
salton 11
took 11
it 11
that 11
he 11
wanted 11
to 11
be 11
by 11
himself 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
avoid 11
any 11
questioning 11
or 11
talk 11
of 11
the 11
visit 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
to 11
make 11
that 11
afternoon 11
they 11
saw 11
nothing 11
further 11
of 11
him 11
till 11
about 11
halfanhour 11
before 11
dinnertime 11
then 11
he 11
came 11
quietly 11
into 11
the 11
smokingroom 11
where 11
mr 11
salton 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
were 11
sitting 11
together 11
ready 11
dressed 11
i 11
suppose 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
use 11
waiting 11
we 11
had 11
better 11
get 11
it 11
over 11
at 11
once 11
remarked 11
adam 11
his 11
uncle 11
thinking 11
to 11
make 11
things 11
easier 11
for 11
him 11
said 11
get 11
what 11
over 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
sign 11
of 11
shyness 11
about 11
him 11
at 11
this 11
he 11
stammered 11
a 11
little 11
at 11
first 11
but 11
his 11
voice 11
became 11
more 11
even 11
as 11
he 11
went 11
on 11
my 11
visit 11
to 11
mercy 11
farm 11
mr 11
salton 11
waited 11
eagerly 11
the 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
simply 11
smiled 11
i 11
suppose 11
you 11
both 11
know 11
that 11
i 11
was 11
much 11
interested 11
yesterday 11
in 11
the 11
watfords 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
denial 11
or 11
fending 11
off 11
the 11
question 11
both 11
the 11
old 11
men 11
smiled 11
acquiescence 11
adam 11
went 11
on 11
i 11
meant 11
you 11
to 11
see 11
itboth 11
of 11
you 11
you 11
uncle 11
because 11
you 11
are 11
my 11
uncle 11
and 11
the 11
nearest 11
of 11
my 11
own 11
kin 11
and 11
moreover 11
you 11
couldnt 11
have 11
been 11
more 11
kind 11
to 11
me 11
or 11
made 11
me 11
more 11
welcome 11
if 11
you 11
had 11
been 11
my 11
own 11
father 11
mr 11
salton 11
said 11
nothing 11
he 11
simply 11
held 11
out 11
his 11
hand 11
and 11
the 11
other 11
took 11
it 11
and 11
held 11
it 11
for 11
a 11
few 11
seconds 11
and 11
you 11
sir 11
because 11
you 11
have 11
shown 11
me 11
something 11
of 11
the 11
same 11
affection 11
which 11
in 11
my 11
wildest 11
dreams 11
of 11
home 11
i 11
had 11
no 11
right 11
to 11
expect 11
he 11
stopped 11
for 11
an 11
instant 11
much 11
moved 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
answered 11
softly 11
laying 11
his 11
hand 11
on 11
the 11
youths 11
shoulder 11
you 11
are 11
right 11
my 11
boy 11
quite 11
right 11
that 11
is 11
the 11
proper 11
way 11
to 11
look 11
at 11
it 11
and 11
i 11
may 11
tell 11
you 11
that 11
we 11
old 11
men 11
who 11
have 11
no 11
children 11
of 11
our 11
own 11
feel 11
our 11
hearts 11
growing 11
warm 11
when 11
we 11
hear 11
words 11
like 11
those 11
then 11
adam 11
hurried 11
on 11
speaking 11
with 11
a 11
rush 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
wanted 11
to 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
crucial 11
point 11
mr 11
watford 11
had 11
not 11
come 11
in 11
but 11
lilla 11
and 11
mimi 11
were 11
at 11
home 11
and 11
they 11
made 11
me 11
feel 11
very 11
welcome 11
they 11
have 11
all 11
a 11
great 11
regard 11
for 11
my 11
uncle 11
i 11
am 11
glad 11
of 11
that 11
any 11
way 11
for 11
i 11
like 11
them 11
allmuch 11
we 11
were 11
having 11
tea 11
when 11
mr 11
caswall 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
attended 11
by 11
the 11
negro 11
lilla 11
opened 11
the 11
door 11
herself 11
the 11
window 11
of 11
the 11
living 11
room 11
at 11
the 11
farm 11
is 11
a 11
large 11
one 11
and 11
from 11
within 11
you 11
cannot 11
help 11
seeing 11
anyone 11
coming 11
mr 11
caswall 11
said 11
he 11
had 11
ventured 11
to 11
call 11
as 11
he 11
wished 11
to 11
make 11
the 11
acquaintance 11
of 11
all 11
his 11
tenants 11
in 11
a 11
less 11
formal 11
way 11
and 11
more 11
individually 11
than 11
had 11
been 11
possible 11
to 11
him 11
on 11
the 11
previous 11
day 11
the 11
girls 11
made 11
him 11
welcomethey 11
are 11
very 11
sweet 11
girls 11
those 11
sir 11
someone 11
will 11
be 11
very 11
happy 11
some 11
day 11
therewith 11
either 11
of 11
them 11
and 11
that 11
man 11
may 11
be 11
you 11
adam 11
said 11
mr 11
salton 11
heartily 11
a 11
sad 11
look 11
came 11
over 11
the 11
young 11
mans 11
eyes 11
and 11
the 11
fire 11
his 11
uncle 11
had 11
seen 11
there 11
died 11
out 11
likewise 11
the 11
timbre 11
left 11
his 11
voice 11
making 11
it 11
sound 11
lonely 11
such 11
might 11
crown 11
my 11
life 11
but 11
that 11
happiness 11
i 11
fear 11
is 11
not 11
for 11
meor 11
not 11
without 11
pain 11
and 11
loss 11
and 11
woe 11
well 11
its 11
early 11
days 11
yet 11
cried 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
heartily 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
turned 11
on 11
him 11
his 11
eyes 11
which 11
had 11
now 11
grown 11
excessively 11
sad 11
yesterdaya 11
few 11
hours 11
agothat 11
remark 11
would 11
have 11
given 11
me 11
new 11
hopenew 11
courage 11
but 11
since 11
then 11
i 11
have 11
learned 11
too 11
much 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
skilled 11
in 11
the 11
human 11
heart 11
did 11
not 11
attempt 11
to 11
argue 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
matter 11
too 11
early 11
to 11
give 11
in 11
my 11
boy 11
i 11
am 11
not 11
of 11
a 11
givingin 11
kind 11
replied 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
earnestly 11
but 11
after 11
all 11
it 11
is 11
wise 11
to 11
realise 11
a 11
truth 11
and 11
when 11
a 11
man 11
though 11
he 11
is 11
young 11
feels 11
as 11
i 11
doas 11
i 11
have 11
felt 11
ever 11
since 11
yesterday 11
when 11
i 11
first 11
saw 11
mimis 11
eyeshis 11
heart 11
jumps 11
he 11
does 11
not 11
need 11
to 11
learn 11
things 11
he 11
knows 11
there 11
was 11
silence 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
during 11
which 11
the 11
twilight 11
stole 11
on 11
imperceptibly 11
it 11
was 11
adam 11
who 11
again 11
broke 11
the 11
silence 11
do 11
you 11
know 11
uncle 11
if 11
we 11
have 11
any 11
second 11
sight 11
in 11
our 11
family 11
no 11
not 11
that 11
i 11
ever 11
heard 11
about 11
why 11
because 11
he 11
answered 11
slowly 11
i 11
have 11
a 11
conviction 11
which 11
seems 11
to 11
answer 11
all 11
the 11
conditions 11
of 11
second 11
sight 11
and 11
then 11
asked 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
much 11
perturbed 11
and 11
then 11
the 11
usual 11
inevitable 11
what 11
in 11
the 11
hebrides 11
and 11
other 11
places 11
where 11
the 11
sight 11
is 11
a 11
culta 11
beliefis 11
called 11
the 11
doom 11
the 11
court 11
from 11
which 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
appeal 11
i 11
have 11
often 11
heard 11
of 11
second 11
sightwe 11
have 11
many 11
western 11
scots 11
in 11
australia 11
but 11
i 11
have 11
realised 11
more 11
of 11
its 11
true 11
inwardness 11
in 11
an 11
instant 11
of 11
this 11
afternoon 11
than 11
i 11
did 11
in 11
the 11
whole 11
of 11
my 11
life 11
previouslya 11
granite 11
wall 11
stretching 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
very 11
heavens 11
so 11
high 11
and 11
so 11
dark 11
that 11
the 11
eye 11
of 11
god 11
himself 11
cannot 11
see 11
beyond 11
well 11
if 11
the 11
doom 11
must 11
come 11
it 11
must 11
that 11
is 11
all 11
the 11
voice 11
of 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
broke 11
in 11
smooth 11
and 11
sweet 11
and 11
grave 11
can 11
there 11
not 11
be 11
a 11
fight 11
for 11
it 11
there 11
can 11
for 11
most 11
things 11
for 11
most 11
things 11
yes 11
but 11
for 11
the 11
doom 11
no 11
what 11
a 11
man 11
can 11
do 11
i 11
shall 11
do 11
there 11
will 11
bemust 11
bea 11
fight 11
when 11
and 11
where 11
and 11
how 11
i 11
know 11
not 11
but 11
a 11
fight 11
there 11
will 11
be 11
but 11
after 11
all 11
what 11
is 11
a 11
man 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
case 11
adam 11
there 11
are 11
three 11
of 11
us 11
salton 11
looked 11
at 11
his 11
old 11
friend 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
and 11
that 11
old 11
friends 11
eyes 11
blazed 11
ay 11
three 11
of 11
us 11
he 11
said 11
and 11
his 11
voice 11
rang 11
there 11
was 11
again 11
a 11
pause 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
endeavoured 11
to 11
get 11
back 11
to 11
less 11
emotional 11
and 11
more 11
neutral 11
ground 11
tell 11
us 11
of 11
the 11
rest 11
of 11
the 11
meeting 11
remember 11
we 11
are 11
all 11
pledged 11
to 11
this 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
fight 11
e 11
loutrance 11
and 11
we 11
can 11
afford 11
to 11
throw 11
away 11
or 11
forgo 11
no 11
chance 11
we 11
shall 11
throw 11
away 11
or 11
lose 11
nothing 11
that 11
we 11
can 11
help 11
we 11
fight 11
to 11
win 11
and 11
the 11
stake 11
is 11
a 11
lifeperhaps 11
more 11
than 11
onewe 11
shall 11
see 11
then 11
he 11
went 11
on 11
in 11
a 11
conversational 11
tone 11
such 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
used 11
when 11
he 11
spoke 11
of 11
the 11
coming 11
to 11
the 11
farm 11
of 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
when 11
mr 11
caswall 11
came 11
in 11
the 11
negro 11
went 11
a 11
short 11
distance 11
away 11
and 11
there 11
remained 11
it 11
gave 11
me 11
the 11
idea 11
that 11
he 11
expected 11
to 11
be 11
called 11
and 11
intended 11
to 11
remain 11
in 11
sight 11
or 11
within 11
hail 11
then 11
mimi 11
got 11
another 11
cup 11
and 11
made 11
fresh 11
tea 11
and 11
we 11
all 11
went 11
on 11
together 11
was 11
there 11
anything 11
uncommonwere 11
you 11
all 11
quite 11
friendly 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
quietly 11
quite 11
friendly 11
there 11
was 11
nothing 11
that 11
i 11
could 11
notice 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
commonexcept 11
he 11
went 11
on 11
with 11
a 11
slight 11
hardening 11
of 11
the 11
voice 11
except 11
that 11
he 11
kept 11
his 11
eyes 11
fixed 11
on 11
lilla 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
which 11
was 11
quite 11
intolerable 11
to 11
any 11
man 11
who 11
might 11
hold 11
her 11
dear 11
now 11
in 11
what 11
way 11
did 11
he 11
look 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
there 11
was 11
nothing 11
in 11
itself 11
offensive 11
but 11
no 11
one 11
could 11
help 11
noticing 11
it 11
you 11
did 11
miss 11
watford 11
herself 11
who 11
was 11
the 11
victim 11
and 11
mr 11
caswall 11
who 11
was 11
the 11
offender 11
are 11
out 11
of 11

anyone 11

her 11
face 11
flamed 11
with 11
anger 11
as 11
she 11
saw 11
the 11
look 11
what 11
kind 11
of 11
look 11
was 11

overardent 11

too 11
admiring 11

what 11
was 11
it 11
the 11
look 11
of 11
a 11

one 11
who 11
fain 11
would 11

you 11
understand 11
yes 11
sir 11
i 11
quite 11
understand 11
anything 11
of 11
that 11
sort 11
i 11
should 11
of 11
course 11
notice 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
part 11
of 11
my 11
preparation 11
for 11
keeping 11
my 11
selfcontrolto 11
which 11
i 11
am 11
pledged 11
if 11
it 11
were 11
not 11
amatory 11
was 11
it 11
threatening 11
where 11
was 11
the 11
offence 11
adam 11
smiled 11
kindly 11
at 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
amatory 11
even 11
if 11
it 11
was 11
such 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
expected 11
i 11
should 11
be 11
the 11
last 11
man 11
in 11
the 11
world 11
to 11
object 11
since 11
i 11
am 11
myself 11
an 11
offender 11
in 11
that 11
respect 11
moreover 11
not 11
only 11
have 11
i 11
been 11
taught 11
to 11
fight 11
fair 11
but 11
by 11
nature 11
i 11
believe 11
i 11
am 11
just 11
i 11
would 11
be 11
as 11
tolerant 11
of 11
and 11
as 11
liberal 11
to 11
a 11
rival 11
as 11
i 11
should 11
expect 11
him 11
to 11
be 11
to 11
me 11
no 11
the 11
look 11
i 11
mean 11
was 11
nothing 11
of 11
that 11
kind 11
and 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
it 11
did 11
not 11
lack 11
proper 11
respect 11
i 11
should 11
not 11
of 11
my 11
own 11
part 11
condescend 11
to 11
notice 11
it 11
did 11
you 11
ever 11
study 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
a 11
hound 11
at 11
rest 11
no 11
when 11
he 11
is 11
following 11
his 11
instincts 11
or 11
better 11
still 11
adam 11
went 11
on 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
a 11
bird 11
of 11
prey 11
when 11
he 11
is 11
following 11
his 11
instincts 11
not 11
when 11
he 11
is 11
swooping 11
but 11
merely 11
when 11
he 11
is 11
watching 11
his 11
quarry 11
no 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
i 11
dont 11
know 11
that 11
i 11
ever 11
did 11
why 11
may 11
i 11
ask 11
that 11
was 11
the 11
look 11
certainly 11
not 11
amatory 11
or 11
anything 11
of 11
that 11
kind 11
yet 11
it 11
was 11
it 11
struck 11
me 11
more 11
dangerous 11
if 11
not 11
so 11
deadly 11
as 11
an 11
actual 11
threatening 11
again 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
silence 11
which 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
broke 11
as 11
he 11
stood 11
up 11
i 11
think 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
well 11
if 11
we 11
all 11
thought 11
over 11
this 11
by 11
ourselves 11
then 11
we 11
can 11
renew 11
the 11
subject 11
chapter 11
viioolanga 11
mr 11
salton 11
had 11
an 11
appointment 11
for 11
six 11
oclock 11
at 11
liverpool 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
driven 11
off 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
took 11
adam 11
by 11
the 11
arm 11
may 11
i 11
come 11
with 11
you 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
to 11
your 11
study 11
i 11
want 11
to 11
speak 11
to 11
you 11
privately 11
without 11
your 11
uncle 11
knowing 11
about 11
it 11
or 11
even 11
what 11
the 11
subject 11
is 11
you 11
dont 11
mind 11
do 11
you 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
idle 11
curiosity 11
no 11
no 11
it 11
is 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
to 11
which 11
we 11
are 11
all 11
committed 11
is 11
it 11
necessary 11
to 11
keep 11
my 11
uncle 11
in 11
the 11
dark 11
about 11
it 11
he 11
might 11
be 11
offended 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
necessary 11
but 11
it 11
is 11
advisable 11
it 11
is 11
for 11
his 11
sake 11
that 11
i 11
asked 11
my 11
friend 11
is 11
an 11
old 11
man 11
and 11
it 11
might 11
concern 11
him 11
unduly 11
even 11
alarm 11
him 11
i 11
promise 11
you 11
there 11
shall 11
be 11
nothing 11
that 11
could 11
cause 11
him 11
anxiety 11
in 11
our 11
silence 11
or 11
at 11
which 11
he 11
could 11
take 11
umbrage 11
go 11
on 11
sir 11
said 11
adam 11
simply 11
you 11
see 11
your 11
uncle 11
is 11
now 11
an 11
old 11
man 11
i 11
know 11
it 11
for 11
we 11
were 11
boys 11
together 11
he 11
has 11
led 11
an 11
uneventful 11
and 11
somewhat 11
selfcontained 11
life 11
so 11
that 11
any 11
such 11
condition 11
of 11
things 11
as 11
has 11
now 11
arisen 11
is 11
apt 11
to 11
perplex 11
him 11
from 11
its 11
very 11
strangeness 11
in 11
fact 11
any 11
new 11
matter 11
is 11
trying 11
to 11
old 11
people 11
it 11
has 11
its 11
own 11
disturbances 11
and 11
its 11
own 11
anxieties 11
and 11
neither 11
of 11
these 11
things 11
are 11
good 11
for 11
lives 11
that 11
should 11
be 11
restful 11
your 11
uncle 11
is 11
a 11
strong 11
man 11
with 11
a 11
very 11
happy 11
and 11
placid 11
nature 11
given 11
health 11
and 11
ordinary 11
conditions 11
of 11
life 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
reason 11
why 11
he 11
should 11
not 11
live 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
hundred 11
you 11
and 11
i 11
therefore 11
who 11
both 11
love 11
him 11
though 11
in 11
different 11
ways 11
should 11
make 11
it 11
our 11
business 11
to 11
protect 11
him 11
from 11
all 11
disturbing 11
influences 11
i 11
am 11
sure 11
you 11
will 11
agree 11
with 11
me 11
that 11
any 11
labour 11
to 11
this 11
end 11
would 11
be 11
well 11
spent 11
all 11
right 11
my 11
boy 11
i 11
see 11
your 11
answer 11
in 11
your 11
eyes 11
so 11
we 11
need 11
say 11
no 11
more 11
of 11
that 11
and 11
now 11
here 11
his 11
voice 11
changed 11
tell 11
me 11
all 11
that 11
took 11
place 11
at 11
that 11
interview 11
there 11
are 11
strange 11
things 11
in 11
front 11
of 11
ushow 11
strange 11
we 11
cannot 11
at 11
present 11
even 11
guess 11
doubtless 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
difficult 11
things 11
to 11
understand 11
which 11
lie 11
behind 11
the 11
veil 11
will 11
in 11
time 11
be 11
shown 11
to 11
us 11
to 11
see 11
and 11
to 11
understand 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
all 11
we 11
can 11
do 11
is 11
to 11
work 11
patiently 11
fearlessly 11
and 11
unselfishly 11
to 11
an 11
end 11
that 11
we 11
think 11
is 11
right 11
you 11
had 11
got 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
where 11
lilla 11
opened 11
the 11
door 11
to 11
mr 11
caswall 11
and 11
the 11
negro 11
you 11
also 11
observed 11
that 11
mimi 11
was 11
disturbed 11
in 11
her 11
mind 11
at 11
the 11
way 11
mr 11
caswall 11
looked 11
at 11
her 11
cousin 11
certainlythough 11
disturbed 11
is 11
a 11
poor 11
way 11
of 11
expressing 11
her 11
objection 11
can 11
you 11
remember 11
well 11
enough 11
to 11
describe 11
caswalls 11
eyes 11
and 11
how 11
lilla 11
looked 11
and 11
what 11
mimi 11
said 11
and 11
did 11
also 11
oolanga 11
caswalls 11
west 11
african 11
servant 11
ill 11
do 11
what 11
i 11
can 11
sir 11
all 11
the 11
time 11
mr 11
caswall 11
was 11
staring 11
he 11
kept 11
his 11
eyes 11
fixed 11
and 11
motionlessbut 11
not 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
trance 11
his 11
forehead 11
was 11
wrinkled 11
up 11
as 11
it 11
is 11
when 11
one 11
is 11
trying 11
to 11
see 11
through 11
or 11
into 11
something 11
at 11
the 11
best 11
of 11
times 11
his 11
face 11
has 11
not 11
a 11
gentle 11
expression 11
but 11
when 11
it 11
was 11
screwed 11
up 11
like 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
almost 11
diabolical 11
it 11
frightened 11
poor 11
lilla 11
so 11
that 11
she 11
trembled 11
and 11
after 11
a 11
bit 11
got 11
so 11
pale 11
that 11
i 11
thought 11
she 11
had 11
fainted 11
however 11
she 11
held 11
up 11
and 11
tried 11
to 11
stare 11
back 11
but 11
in 11
a 11
feeble 11
kind 11
of 11
way 11
then 11
mimi 11
came 11
close 11
and 11
held 11
her 11
hand 11
that 11
braced 11
her 11
up 11
andstill 11
never 11
ceasing 11
her 11
return 11
stareshe 11
got 11
colour 11
again 11
and 11
seemed 11
more 11
like 11
herself 11
did 11
he 11
stare 11
too 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
the 11
weaker 11
lilla 11
seemed 11
the 11
stronger 11
he 11
became 11
just 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
were 11
feeding 11
on 11
her 11
strength 11
all 11
at 11
once 11
she 11
turned 11
round 11
threw 11
up 11
her 11
hands 11
and 11
fell 11
down 11
in 11
a 11
faint 11
i 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
what 11
else 11
happened 11
just 11
then 11
for 11
mimi 11
had 11
thrown 11
herself 11
on 11
her 11
knees 11
beside 11
her 11
and 11
hid 11
her 11
from 11
me 11
then 11
there 11
was 11
something 11
like 11
a 11
black 11
shadow 11
between 11
us 11
and 11
there 11
was 11
the 11
nigger 11
looking 11
more 11
like 11
a 11
malignant 11
devil 11
than 11
ever 11
i 11
am 11
not 11
usually 11
a 11
patient 11
man 11
and 11
the 11
sight 11
of 11
that 11
ugly 11
devil 11
is 11
enough 11
to 11
make 11
ones 11
blood 11
boil 11
when 11
he 11
saw 11
my 11
face 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
realise 11
dangerimmediate 11
danger 11
and 11
slunk 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
as 11
noiselessly 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
blown 11
out 11
i 11
learned 11
one 11
thing 11
howeverhe 11
is 11
an 11
enemy 11
if 11
ever 11
a 11
man 11
had 11
one 11
that 11
still 11
leaves 11
us 11
three 11
to 11
two 11
put 11
in 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
then 11
caswall 11
slunk 11
out 11
much 11
as 11
the 11
nigger 11
had 11
done 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
gone 11
lilla 11
recovered 11
at 11
once 11
now 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
anxious 11
to 11
restore 11
peace 11
have 11
you 11
found 11
out 11
anything 11
yet 11
regarding 11
the 11
negro 11
i 11
am 11
anxious 11
to 11
be 11
posted 11
regarding 11
him 11
i 11
fear 11
there 11
will 11
be 11
or 11
may 11
be 11
grave 11
trouble 11
with 11
him 11
yes 11
sir 11
ive 11
heard 11
a 11
good 11
deal 11
about 11
himof 11
course 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
official 11
but 11
hearsay 11

devoted 11
to 11

and 11
has 11
my 11
full 11
confidence 11
i 11

on 11

the 11
west 11
african 11
and 11
have 11
a 11
good 11
look 11
round 11
and 11
find 11
out 11
what 11
he 11
could 11
about 11
mr 11
caswall 11
naturally 11
he 11
was 11
struck 11
with 11
the 11
aboriginal 11
savage 11
he 11
found 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
ships 11
stewards 11
who 11
had 11
been 11
on 11
the 11
regular 11
voyages 11
to 11
south 11
africa 11
he 11
knew 11
oolanga 11
and 11
had 11
made 11
a 11
study 11
of 11
him 11
he 11
is 11
a 11
man 11
who 11
gets 11
on 11
well 11
with 11
niggers 11
and 11
they 11
open 11
their 11
hearts 11
to 11
him 11
it 11
seems 11
that 11
this 11
oolanga 11
is 11
quite 11
a 11
great 11
person 11
in 11
the 11
nigger 11
world 11
of 11
the 11
african 11
west 11
coast 11
he 11
has 11
the 11
two 11
things 11
which 11
men 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
colour 11
respect 11
he 11
can 11
make 11
them 11
afraid 11
and 11
he 11
is 11
lavish 11
with 11
money 11
i 11
dont 11
know 11
whose 11
moneybut 11
that 11
does 11
not 11
matter 11
they 11
are 11
always 11
ready 11
to 11
trumpet 11
his 11
greatness 11
evil 11
greatness 11
it 11
is 11
but 11
neither 11
does 11
that 11
matter 11
briefly 11
this 11
is 11
his 11
history 11
he 11
was 11
originally 11
a 11
witchfinderabout 11
as 11
low 11
an 11
occupation 11
as 11
exists 11
amongst 11
aboriginal 11
savages 11
then 11
he 11
got 11
up 11
in 11
the 11
world 11
and 11
became 11
an 11
obiman 11
which 11
gives 11
an 11
opportunity 11
to 11
wealth 11
via 11
blackmail 11
finally 11
he 11
reached 11
the 11
highest 11
honour 11
in 11
hellish 11
service 11
he 11
became 11
a 11
user 11
of 11
voodoo 11
which 11
seems 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
service 11
of 11
the 11
utmost 11
baseness 11
and 11
cruelty 11
i 11
was 11
told 11
some 11
of 11
his 11
deeds 11
of 11
cruelty 11
which 11
are 11
simply 11
sickening 11
they 11
made 11
me 11
long 11
for 11
an 11
opportunity 11
of 11
helping 11
to 11
drive 11
him 11
back 11
to 11
hell 11
you 11
might 11
think 11
to 11
look 11
at 11
him 11
that 11
you 11
could 11
measure 11
in 11
some 11
way 11
the 11
extent 11
of 11
his 11
vileness 11
but 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
a 11
vain 11
hope 11
monsters 11
such 11
as 11
he 11
is 11
belong 11
to 11
an 11
earlier 11
and 11
more 11
rudimentary 11
stage 11
of 11
barbarism 11
he 11
is 11
in 11
his 11
way 11
a 11
clever 11
fellowfor 11
a 11
nigger 11
but 11
is 11
none 11
the 11
less 11
dangerous 11
or 11
the 11
less 11
hateful 11
for 11
that 11
the 11
men 11
in 11
the 11
ship 11
told 11
me 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
a 11
collector 11
some 11
of 11
them 11
had 11
seen 11
his 11
collections 11
such 11
collections 11
all 11
that 11
was 11
potent 11
for 11
evil 11
in 11
bird 11
or 11
beast 11
or 11
even 11
in 11
fish 11
beaks 11
that 11
could 11
break 11
and 11
rend 11
and 11
tearall 11
the 11
birds 11
represented 11
were 11
of 11
a 11
predatory 11
kind 11
even 11
the 11
fishes 11
are 11
those 11
which 11
are 11
born 11
to 11
destroy 11
to 11
wound 11
to 11
torture 11
the 11
collection 11
i 11
assure 11
you 11
was 11
an 11
object 11
lesson 11
in 11
human 11
malignity 11
this 11
being 11
has 11
enough 11
evil 11
in 11
his 11
face 11
to 11
frighten 11
even 11
a 11
strong 11
man 11
it 11
is 11
little 11
wonder 11
that 11
the 11
sight 11
of 11
it 11
put 11
that 11
poor 11
girl 11
into 11
a 11
dead 11
faint 11
nothing 11
more 11
could 11
be 11
done 11
at 11
the 11
moment 11
so 11
they 11
separated 11
adam 11
was 11
up 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
and 11
took 11
a 11
smart 11
walk 11
round 11
the 11
brow 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
passing 11
dianas 11
grove 11
he 11
looked 11
in 11
on 11
the 11
short 11
avenue 11
of 11
trees 11
and 11
noticed 11
the 11
snakes 11
killed 11
on 11
the 11
previous 11
morning 11
by 11
the 11
mongoose 11
they 11
all 11
lay 11
in 11
a 11
row 11
straight 11
and 11
rigid 11
as 11
if 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
placed 11
by 11
hands 11
their 11
skins 11
seemed 11
damp 11
and 11
sticky 11
and 11
they 11
were 11
covered 11
all 11
over 11
with 11
ants 11
and 11
other 11
insects 11
they 11
looked 11
loathsome 11
so 11
after 11
a 11
glance 11
he 11
passed 11
on 11
a 11
little 11
later 11
when 11
his 11
steps 11
took 11
him 11
naturally 11
enough 11
past 11
the 11
entrance 11
to 11
mercy 11
farm 11
he 11
was 11
passed 11
by 11
the 11
negro 11
moving 11
quickly 11
under 11
the 11
trees 11
wherever 11
there 11
was 11
shadow 11
laid 11
across 11
one 11
extended 11
arm 11
looking 11
like 11
dirty 11
towels 11
across 11
a 11
rail 11
he 11
had 11
the 11
horrid 11
looking 11
snakes 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
seem 11
to 11
see 11
adam 11
no 11
one 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
at 11
mercy 11
except 11
a 11
few 11
workmen 11
in 11
the 11
farmyard 11
so 11
after 11
waiting 11
on 11
the 11
chance 11
of 11
seeing 11
mimi 11
adam 11
began 11
to 11
go 11
slowly 11
home 11
once 11
more 11
he 11
was 11
passed 11
on 11
the 11
way 11
this 11
time 11
it 11
was 11
by 11
lady 11
arabella 11
walking 11
hurriedly 11
and 11
so 11
furiously 11
angry 11
that 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
recognise 11
him 11
even 11
to 11
the 11
extent 11
of 11
acknowledging 11
his 11
bow 11
when 11
adam 11
got 11
back 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
he 11
went 11
to 11
the 11
coachhouse 11
where 11
the 11
box 11
with 11
the 11
mongoose 11
was 11
kept 11
and 11
took 11
it 11
with 11
him 11
intending 11
to 11
finish 11
at 11
the 11
mound 11
of 11
stone 11
what 11
he 11
had 11
begun 11
the 11
previous 11
morning 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
the 11
extermination 11
he 11
found 11
that 11
the 11
snakes 11
were 11
even 11
more 11
easily 11
attacked 11
than 11
on 11
the 11
previous 11
day 11
no 11
less 11
than 11
six 11
were 11
killed 11
in 11
the 11
first 11
halfhour 11
as 11
no 11
more 11
appeared 11
he 11
took 11
it 11
for 11
granted 11
that 11
the 11
mornings 11
work 11
was 11
over 11
and 11
went 11
towards 11
home 11
the 11
mongoose 11
had 11
by 11
this 11
time 11
become 11
accustomed 11
to 11
him 11
and 11
was 11
willing 11
to 11
let 11
himself 11
be 11
handled 11
freely 11
adam 11
lifted 11
him 11
up 11
and 11
put 11
him 11
on 11
his 11
shoulder 11
and 11
walked 11
on 11
presently 11
he 11
saw 11
a 11
lady 11
advancing 11
towards 11
him 11
and 11
recognised 11
lady 11
arabella 11
hitherto 11
the 11
mongoose 11
had 11
been 11
quiet 11
like 11
a 11
playful 11
affectionate 11
kitten 11
but 11
when 11
the 11
two 11
got 11
close 11
adam 11
was 11
horrified 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
mongoose 11
in 11
a 11
state 11
of 11
the 11
wildest 11
fury 11
with 11
every 11
hair 11
standing 11
on 11
end 11
jump 11
from 11
his 11
shoulder 11
and 11
run 11
towards 11
lady 11
arabella 11
it 11
looked 11
so 11
furious 11
and 11
so 11
intent 11
on 11
attack 11
that 11
he 11
called 11
a 11
warning 11
look 11
outlook 11
out 11
the 11
animal 11
is 11
furious 11
and 11
means 11
to 11
attack 11
lady 11
arabella 11
looked 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
disdainful 11
and 11
was 11
passing 11
on 11
the 11
mongoose 11
jumped 11
at 11
her 11
in 11
a 11
furious 11
attack 11
adam 11
rushed 11
forward 11
with 11
his 11
stick 11
the 11
only 11
weapon 11
he 11
had 11
but 11
just 11
as 11
he 11
got 11
within 11
striking 11
distance 11
the 11
lady 11
drew 11
out 11
a 11
revolver 11
and 11
shot 11
the 11
animal 11
breaking 11
his 11
backbone 11
not 11
satisfied 11
with 11
this 11
she 11
poured 11
shot 11
after 11
shot 11
into 11
him 11
till 11
the 11
magazine 11
was 11
exhausted 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
coolness 11
or 11
hauteur 11
about 11
her 11
now 11
she 11
seemed 11
more 11
furious 11
even 11
than 11
the 11
animal 11
her 11
face 11
transformed 11
with 11
hate 11
and 11
as 11
determined 11
to 11
kill 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
appeared 11
to 11
be 11
adam 11
not 11
knowing 11
exactly 11
what 11
to 11
do 11
lifted 11
his 11
hat 11
in 11
apology 11
and 11
hurried 11
on 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
chapter 11
viiisurvivals 11
at 11
breakfast 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
noticed 11
that 11
adam 11
was 11
put 11
out 11
about 11
something 11
but 11
he 11
said 11
nothing 11
the 11
lesson 11
of 11
silence 11
is 11
better 11
remembered 11
in 11
age 11
than 11
in 11
youth 11
when 11
they 11
were 11
both 11
in 11
the 11
study 11
where 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
followed 11
him 11
adam 11
at 11
once 11
began 11
to 11
tell 11
his 11
companion 11
of 11
what 11
had 11
happened 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
looked 11
graver 11
and 11
graver 11
as 11
the 11
narration 11
proceeded 11
and 11
when 11
adam 11
had 11
stopped 11
he 11
remained 11
silent 11
for 11
several 11
minutes 11
before 11
speaking 11
this 11
is 11
very 11
grave 11
i 11
have 11
not 11
formed 11
any 11
opinion 11
yet 11
but 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
at 11
first 11
impression 11
that 11
this 11
is 11
worse 11
than 11
anything 11
i 11
had 11
expected 11
why 11
sir 11
said 11
adam 11
is 11
the 11
killing 11
of 11
a 11
mongooseno 11
matter 11
by 11
whomso 11
serious 11
a 11
thing 11
as 11
all 11
that 11
his 11
companion 11
smoked 11
on 11
quietly 11
for 11
quite 11
another 11
few 11
minutes 11
before 11
he 11
spoke 11
when 11
i 11
have 11
properly 11
thought 11
it 11
over 11
i 11
may 11
moderate 11
my 11
opinion 11
but 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
something 11
dreadful 11
behind 11
all 11
thissomething 11
that 11
may 11
affect 11
all 11
our 11
livesthat 11
may 11
mean 11
the 11
issue 11
of 11
life 11
or 11
death 11
to 11
any 11
of 11
us 11
adam 11
sat 11
up 11
quickly 11
do 11
tell 11
me 11
sir 11
what 11
is 11
in 11
your 11
mindif 11
of 11
course 11
you 11
have 11
no 11
objection 11
or 11
do 11
not 11
think 11
it 11
better 11
to 11
withhold 11
it 11
i 11
have 11
no 11
objection 11
adamin 11
fact 11
if 11
i 11
had 11
i 11
should 11
have 11
to 11
overcome 11
it 11
i 11
fear 11
there 11
can 11
be 11
no 11
more 11
reserved 11
thoughts 11
between 11
us 11
indeed 11
sir 11
that 11
sounds 11
serious 11
worse 11
than 11
serious 11
adam 11
i 11
greatly 11
fear 11
that 11
the 11
time 11
has 11
come 11
for 11
usfor 11
you 11
and 11
me 11
at 11
all 11
eventsto 11
speak 11
out 11
plainly 11
to 11
one 11
another 11
does 11
not 11
there 11
seem 11
something 11
very 11
mysterious 11
about 11
this 11
i 11
have 11
thought 11
so 11
sir 11
all 11
along 11
the 11
only 11
difficulty 11
one 11
has 11
is 11
what 11
one 11
is 11
to 11
think 11
and 11
where 11
to 11
begin 11
let 11
us 11
begin 11
with 11
what 11
you 11
have 11
told 11
me 11
first 11
take 11
the 11
conduct 11
of 11
the 11
mongoose 11
he 11
was 11
quiet 11
even 11
friendly 11
and 11
affectionate 11
with 11
you 11
he 11
only 11
attacked 11
the 11
snakes 11
which 11
is 11
after 11
all 11
his 11
business 11
in 11
life 11
that 11
is 11
so 11
then 11
we 11
must 11
try 11
to 11
find 11
some 11
reason 11
why 11
he 11
attacked 11
lady 11
arabella 11
may 11
it 11
not 11
be 11
that 11
a 11
mongoose 11
may 11
have 11
merely 11
the 11
instinct 11
to 11
attack 11
that 11
nature 11
does 11
not 11
allow 11
or 11
provide 11
him 11
with 11
the 11
fine 11
reasoning 11
powers 11
to 11
discriminate 11
who 11
he 11
is 11
to 11
attack 11
of 11
course 11
that 11
may 11
be 11
so 11
but 11
on 11
the 11
other 11
hand 11
should 11
we 11
not 11
satisfy 11
ourselves 11
why 11
he 11
does 11
wish 11
to 11
attack 11
anything 11
if 11
for 11
centuries 11
this 11
particular 11
animal 11
is 11
known 11
to 11
attack 11
only 11
one 11
kind 11
of 11
other 11
animal 11
are 11
we 11
not 11
justified 11
in 11
assuming 11
that 11
when 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
attacks 11
a 11
hitherto 11
unclassed 11
animal 11
he 11
recognises 11
in 11
that 11
animal 11
some 11
quality 11
which 11
it 11
has 11
in 11
common 11
with 11
the 11
hereditary 11
enemy 11
that 11
is 11
a 11
good 11
argument 11
sir 11
adam 11
went 11
on 11
but 11
a 11
dangerous 11
one 11
if 11
we 11
followed 11
it 11
out 11
it 11
would 11
lead 11
us 11
to 11
believe 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
is 11
a 11
snake 11
we 11
must 11
be 11
sure 11
before 11
going 11
to 11
such 11
an 11
end 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
point 11
as 11
yet 11
unconsidered 11
which 11
would 11
account 11
for 11
the 11
unknown 11
thing 11
which 11
puzzles 11
us 11
in 11
what 11
way 11
well 11
suppose 11
the 11
instinct 11
works 11
on 11
some 11
physical 11
basisfor 11
instance 11
smell 11
if 11
there 11
were 11
anything 11
in 11
recent 11
juxtaposition 11
to 11
the 11
attacked 11
which 11
would 11
carry 11
the 11
scent 11
surely 11
that 11
would 11
supply 11
the 11
missing 11
cause 11
of 11
course 11
adam 11
spoke 11
with 11
conviction 11
now 11
from 11
what 11
you 11
tell 11
me 11
the 11
negro 11
had 11
just 11
come 11
from 11
the 11
direction 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
carrying 11
the 11
dead 11
snakes 11
which 11
the 11
mongoose 11
had 11
killed 11
the 11
previous 11
morning 11
might 11
not 11
the 11
scent 11
have 11
been 11
carried 11
that 11
way 11
of 11
course 11
it 11
might 11
and 11
probably 11
was 11
i 11
never 11
thought 11
of 11
that 11
is 11
there 11
any 11
possible 11
way 11
of 11
guessing 11
approximately 11
how 11
long 11
a 11
scent 11
will 11
remain 11
you 11
see 11
this 11
is 11
a 11
natural 11
scent 11
and 11
may 11
derive 11
from 11
a 11
place 11
where 11
it 11
has 11
been 11
effective 11
for 11
thousands 11
of 11
years 11
then 11
does 11
a 11
scent 11
of 11
any 11
kind 11
carry 11
with 11
it 11
any 11
form 11
or 11
quality 11
of 11
another 11
kind 11
either 11
good 11
or 11
evil 11
i 11
ask 11
you 11
because 11
one 11
ancient 11
name 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
lived 11
in 11
by 11
the 11
lady 11
who 11
was 11
attacked 11
by 11
the 11
mongoose 11
was 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
if 11
any 11
of 11
these 11
things 11
be 11
so 11
our 11
difficulties 11
have 11
multiplied 11
indefinitely 11
they 11
may 11
even 11
change 11
in 11
kind 11
we 11
may 11
get 11
into 11
moral 11
entanglements 11
before 11
we 11
know 11
it 11
we 11
may 11
be 11
in 11
the 11
midst 11
of 11
a 11
struggle 11
between 11
good 11
and 11
evil 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
smiled 11
gravely 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
the 11
first 11
questionso 11
far 11
as 11
i 11
know 11
there 11
are 11
no 11
fixed 11
periods 11
for 11
which 11
a 11
scent 11
may 11
be 11
activei 11
think 11
we 11
may 11
take 11
it 11
that 11
that 11
period 11
does 11
not 11
run 11
into 11
thousands 11
of 11
years 11
as 11
to 11
whether 11
any 11
moral 11
change 11
accompanies 11
a 11
physical 11
one 11
i 11
can 11
only 11
say 11
that 11
i 11
have 11
met 11
no 11
proof 11
of 11
the 11
fact 11
at 11
the 11
same 11
time 11
we 11
must 11
remember 11
that 11
good 11
and 11
evil 11
are 11
terms 11
so 11
wide 11
as 11
to 11
take 11
in 11
the 11
whole 11
scheme 11
of 11
creation 11
and 11
all 11
that 11
is 11
implied 11
by 11
them 11
and 11
by 11
their 11
mutual 11
action 11
and 11
reaction 11
generally 11
i 11
would 11
say 11
that 11
in 11
the 11
scheme 11
of 11
a 11
first 11
cause 11
anything 11
is 11
possible 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
the 11
inherent 11
forces 11
or 11
tendencies 11
of 11
any 11
one 11
thing 11
are 11
veiled 11
from 11
us 11
we 11
must 11
expect 11
mystery 11
there 11
is 11
one 11
other 11
question 11
on 11
which 11
i 11
should 11
like 11
to 11
ask 11
your 11
opinion 11
suppose 11
that 11
there 11
are 11
any 11
permanent 11
forces 11
appertaining 11
to 11
the 11
past 11
what 11
we 11
may 11
call 11
survivals 11
do 11
these 11
belong 11
to 11
good 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
to 11
evil 11
for 11
instance 11
if 11
the 11
scent 11
of 11
the 11
primaeval 11
monster 11
can 11
so 11
remain 11
in 11
proportion 11
to 11
the 11
original 11
strength 11
can 11
the 11
same 11
be 11
true 11
of 11
things 11
of 11
good 11
import 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
thought 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
before 11
he 11
answered 11
we 11
must 11
be 11
careful 11
not 11
to 11
confuse 11
the 11
physical 11
and 11
the 11
moral 11
i 11
can 11
see 11
that 11
already 11
you 11
have 11
switched 11
on 11
the 11
moral 11
entirely 11
so 11
perhaps 11
we 11
had 11
better 11
follow 11
it 11
up 11
first 11
on 11
the 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
moral 11
we 11
have 11
certain 11
justification 11
for 11
belief 11
in 11
the 11
utterances 11
of 11
revealed 11
religion 11
for 11
instance 11
the 11
effectual 11
fervent 11
prayer 11
of 11
a 11
righteous 11
man 11
availeth 11
much 11
is 11
altogether 11
for 11
good 11
we 11
have 11
nothing 11
of 11
a 11
similar 11
kind 11
on 11
the 11
side 11
of 11
evil 11
but 11
if 11
we 11
accept 11
this 11
dictum 11
we 11
need 11
have 11
no 11
more 11
fear 11
of 11
mysteries 11
these 11
become 11
thenceforth 11
merely 11
obstacles 11
adam 11
suddenly 11
changed 11
to 11
another 11
phase 11
of 11
the 11
subject 11
and 11
now 11
sir 11
may 11
i 11
turn 11
for 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
to 11
purely 11
practical 11
things 11
or 11
rather 11
to 11
matters 11
of 11
historical 11
fact 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
bowed 11
acquiescence 11
we 11
have 11
already 11
spoken 11
of 11
the 11
history 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
it 11
is 11
known 11
of 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
places 11
round 11
uscastra 11
regis 11
dianas 11
grove 11
and 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
i 11
would 11
like 11
to 11
ask 11
if 11
there 11
is 11
anything 11
not 11
necessarily 11
of 11
evil 11
import 11
about 11
any 11
of 11
the 11
places 11
which 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
shrewdly 11
well 11
for 11
instance 11
this 11
house 11
and 11
mercy 11
farm 11
here 11
we 11
turn 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
to 11
the 11
other 11
side 11
the 11
light 11
side 11
of 11
things 11
let 11
us 11
take 11
mercy 11
farm 11
first 11
when 11
augustine 11
was 11
sent 11
by 11
pope 11
gregory 11
to 11
christianise 11
england 11
in 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
the 11
romans 11
he 11
was 11
received 11
and 11
protected 11
by 11
ethelbert 11
king 11
of 11
kent 11
whose 11
wife 11
daughter 11
of 11
charibert 11
king 11
of 11
paris 11
was 11
a 11
christian 11
and 11
did 11
much 11
for 11
augustine 11
she 11
founded 11
a 11
nunnery 11
in 11
memory 11
of 11
columba 11
which 11
was 11
named 11
sedes 11
misericordioe 11
the 11
house 11
of 11
mercy 11
and 11
as 11
the 11
region 11
was 11
mercian 11
the 11
two 11
names 11
became 11
involved 11
as 11
columba 11
is 11
the 11
latin 11
for 11
dove 11
the 11
dove 11
became 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
signification 11
of 11
the 11
nunnery 11
she 11
seized 11
on 11
the 11
idea 11
and 11
made 11
the 11
newlyfounded 11
nunnery 11
a 11
house 11
of 11
doves 11
someone 11
sent 11
her 11
a 11
freshly 11
discovered 11
dove 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
carrier 11
but 11
which 11
had 11
in 11
the 11
white 11
feathers 11
of 11
its 11
head 11
and 11
neck 11
the 11
form 11
of 11
a 11
religious 11
cowl 11
the 11
nunnery 11
flourished 11
for 11
more 11
than 11
a 11
century 11
when 11
in 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
penda 11
who 11
was 11
the 11
reactionary 11
of 11
heathendom 11
it 11
fell 11
into 11
decay 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
the 11
doves 11
protected 11
by 11
religious 11
feeling 11
had 11
increased 11
mightily 11
and 11
were 11
known 11
in 11
all 11
catholic 11
communities 11
when 11
king 11
offa 11
ruled 11
in 11

under 11

protection 11
the 11
nunnery 11
of 11

religious 11

before 11

thank 11
you 11
sir 11
said 11
adam 11
earnestly 11
and 11
was 11
silent 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
understood 11
after 11
lunch 11
that 11
day 11
adam 11
casually 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
to 11
come 11
for 11
a 11
walk 11
with 11
him 11
the 11
keenwitted 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
guessed 11
that 11
there 11
must 11
be 11
some 11
motive 11
behind 11
the 11
suggestion 11
and 11
he 11
at 11
once 11
agreed 11
as 11
soon 11
as 11
they 11
were 11
free 11
from 11
observation 11
adam 11
began 11
i 11
am 11
afraid 11
sir 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
more 11
going 11
on 11
in 11
this 11
neighbourhood 11
than 11
most 11
people 11
imagine 11
i 11
was 11
out 11
this 11
morning 11
and 11
on 11
the 11
edge 11
of 11
the 11
small 11
wood 11
i 11
came 11
upon 11
the 11
body 11
of 11
a 11
child 11
by 11
the 11
roadside 11
at 11
first 11
i 11
thought 11
she 11
was 11
dead 11
and 11
while 11
examining 11
her 11
i 11
noticed 11
on 11
her 11
neck 11
some 11
marks 11
that 11
looked 11
like 11
those 11
of 11
teeth 11
some 11
wild 11
dog 11
perhaps 11
put 11
in 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
possibly 11
sir 11
though 11
i 11
think 11
notbut 11
listen 11
to 11
the 11
rest 11
of 11
my 11
news 11
i 11
glanced 11
around 11
and 11
to 11
my 11
surprise 11
i 11
noticed 11
something 11
white 11
moving 11
among 11
the 11
trees 11
i 11
placed 11
the 11
child 11
down 11
carefully 11
and 11
followed 11
but 11
i 11
could 11
not 11
find 11
any 11
further 11
traces 11
so 11
i 11
returned 11
to 11
the 11
child 11
and 11
resumed 11
my 11
examination 11
and 11
to 11
my 11
delight 11
i 11
discovered 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
still 11
alive 11
i 11
chafed 11
her 11
hands 11
and 11
gradually 11
she 11
revived 11
but 11
to 11
my 11
disappointment 11
she 11
remembered 11
nothingexcept 11
that 11
something 11
had 11
crept 11
up 11
quietly 11
from 11
behind 11
and 11
had 11
gripped 11
her 11
round 11
the 11
throat 11
then 11
apparently 11
she 11
fainted 11
gripped 11
her 11
round 11
the 11
throat 11
then 11
it 11
cannot 11
have 11
been 11
a 11
dog 11
no 11
sir 11
that 11
is 11
my 11
difficulty 11
and 11
explains 11
why 11
i 11
brought 11
you 11
out 11
here 11
where 11
we 11
cannot 11
possibly 11
be 11
overheard 11
you 11
have 11
noticed 11
of 11
course 11
the 11
peculiar 11
sinuous 11
way 11
in 11
which 11
lady 11
arabella 11
moveswell 11
i 11
feel 11
certain 11
that 11
the 11
white 11
thing 11
that 11
i 11
saw 11
in 11
the 11
wood 11
was 11
the 11
mistress 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
good 11
god 11
boy 11
be 11
careful 11
what 11
you 11
say 11
yes 11
sir 11
i 11
fully 11
realise 11
the 11
gravity 11
of 11
my 11
accusation 11
but 11
i 11
feel 11
convinced 11
that 11
the 11
marks 11
on 11
the 11
childs 11
throat 11
were 11
humanand 11
made 11
by 11
a 11
woman 11
adams 11
companion 11
remained 11
silent 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
deep 11
in 11
thought 11
adam 11
my 11
boy 11
he 11
said 11
at 11
last 11
this 11
matter 11
appears 11
to 11
me 11
to 11
be 11
far 11
more 11
serious 11
even 11
than 11
you 11
think 11
it 11
forces 11
me 11
to 11
break 11
confidence 11
with 11
my 11
old 11
friend 11
your 11
unclebut 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
spare 11
him 11
i 11
must 11
do 11
so 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
now 11
things 11
have 11
been 11
happening 11
in 11
this 11
district 11
that 11
have 11
been 11
worrying 11
him 11
dreadfullyseveral 11
people 11
have 11
disappeared 11
without 11
leaving 11
the 11
slightest 11
trace 11
a 11
dead 11
child 11
was 11
found 11
by 11
the 11
roadside 11
with 11
no 11
visible 11
or 11
ascertainable 11
cause 11
of 11
deathsheep 11
and 11
other 11
animals 11
have 11
been 11
found 11
in 11
the 11
fields 11
bleeding 11
from 11
open 11
wounds 11
there 11
have 11
been 11
other 11
mattersmany 11
of 11
them 11
apparently 11
trivial 11
in 11
themselves 11
some 11
sinister 11
influence 11
has 11
been 11
at 11
work 11
and 11
i 11
admit 11
that 11
i 11
have 11
suspected 11
lady 11
arabellathat 11
is 11
why 11
i 11
questioned 11
you 11
so 11
closely 11
about 11
the 11
mongoose 11
and 11
its 11
strange 11
attack 11
upon 11
lady 11
arabella 11
you 11
will 11
think 11
it 11
strange 11
that 11
i 11
should 11
suspect 11
the 11
mistress 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
a 11
beautiful 11
woman 11
of 11

is 11
near 11
my 11
own 11
place 11
doom 11
tower 11
and 11
at 11
one 11
time 11
i 11
knew 11
the 11
family 11
well 11
when 11
still 11
a 11
young 11
girl 11
lady 11
arabella 11
wandered 11
into 11
a 11
small 11
wood 11
near 11
her 11
home 11
and 11
did 11
not 11
return 11
she 11
was 11
found 11
unconscious 11
and 11
in 11
a 11
high 11
feverthe 11
doctor 11
said 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
received 11
a 11
poisonous 11
bite 11
and 11
the 11
girl 11
being 11
at 11
a 11
delicate 11
and 11
critical 11
age 11
the 11
result 11
was 11
seriousso 11
much 11
so 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
not 11
expected 11
to 11
recover 11
a 11
great 11
london 11
physician 11
came 11
down 11
but 11
could 11
do 11
nothingindeed 11
he 11
said 11
that 11
the 11
girl 11
would 11
not 11
survive 11
the 11
night 11
all 11
hope 11
had 11
been 11
abandoned 11
when 11
to 11
everyones 11
surprise 11
lady 11
arabella 11
made 11
a 11
sudden 11
and 11
startling 11
recovery 11
within 11
a 11
couple 11
of 11
days 11
she 11
was 11
going 11
about 11
as 11
usual 11
but 11
to 11
the 11
horror 11
of 11
her 11
people 11
she 11
developed 11
a 11
terrible 11
craving 11
for 11
cruelty 11
maiming 11
and 11
injuring 11
birds 11
and 11
small 11
animals 11
even 11
killing 11
them 11
this 11
was 11
put 11
down 11
to 11
a 11
nervous 11
disturbance 11
due 11
to 11
her 11
age 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
hoped 11
that 11
her 11
marriage 11
to 11
captain 11
march 11
would 11
put 11
this 11
right 11
however 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
a 11
happy 11
marriage 11
and 11
eventually 11
her 11
husband 11
was 11
found 11
shot 11
through 11
the 11
head 11
i 11
have 11
always 11
suspected 11
suicide 11
though 11
no 11
pistol 11
was 11
found 11
near 11
the 11
body 11
he 11
may 11
have 11
discovered 11
somethinggod 11
knows 11
whatso 11
possibly 11
lady 11
arabella 11
may 11
herself 11
have 11
killed 11
him 11
putting 11
together 11
many 11
small 11
matters 11
that 11
have 11
come 11
to 11
my 11
knowledge 11
i 11
have 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
the 11
foul 11
white 11
worm 11
obtained 11
control 11
of 11
her 11
body 11
just 11
as 11
her 11
soul 11
was 11
leaving 11
its 11
earthly 11
tenementthat 11
would 11
explain 11
the 11
sudden 11
revival 11
of 11
energy 11
the 11
strange 11
and 11
inexplicable 11
craving 11
for 11
maiming 11
and 11
killing 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
many 11
other 11
matters 11
with 11
which 11
i 11
need 11
not 11
trouble 11
you 11
now 11
adam 11
as 11
i 11
said 11
just 11
now 11
god 11
alone 11
knows 11
what 11
poor 11
captain 11
march 11
discoveredit 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
something 11
too 11
ghastly 11
for 11
human 11
endurance 11
if 11
my 11
theory 11
is 11
correct 11
that 11
the 11
once 11
beautiful 11
human 11
body 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
is 11
under 11
the 11
control 11
of 11
this 11
ghastly 11
white 11
worm 11
adam 11
nodded 11
but 11
what 11
can 11
we 11
do 11
sirit 11
seems 11
a 11
most 11
difficult 11
problem 11
we 11
can 11
do 11
nothing 11
my 11
boythat 11
is 11
the 11
important 11
part 11
of 11
it 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
impossible 11
to 11
take 11
actionall 11
we 11
can 11
do 11
is 11
to 11
keep 11
careful 11
watch 11
especially 11
as 11
regards 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
be 11
ready 11
to 11
act 11
promptly 11
and 11
decisively 11
if 11
the 11
opportunity 11
occurs 11

the 11

had 11
undertaken 11
or 11
in 11
which 11
he 11
was 11
interested 11
he 11
had 11
agreed 11
with 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
that 11
they 11
should 11
not 11
do 11
anything 11

regard 11

of 11

fear 11
of 11
the 11

but 11
he 11
steadily 11
pursued 11
his 11
course 11
in 11
being 11
prepared 11
to 11
act 11
whenever 11
the 11
opportunity 11
might 11
come 11
he 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
mind 11
perpetually 11
casting 11
about 11
for 11
information 11
or 11
clues 11
which 11
might 11
lead 11
to 11
possible 11
lines 11
of 11
action 11
baffled 11
by 11
the 11
killing 11
of 11
the 11
mongoose 11
he 11
looked 11
around 11
for 11
another 11
line 11
to 11
follow 11
he 11
was 11
fascinated 11
by 11
the 11
idea 11
of 11
there 11
being 11
a 11
mysterious 11
link 11
between 11
the 11
woman 11
and 11
the 11
animal 11
but 11
he 11
was 11
already 11
preparing 11
a 11
second 11
string 11
to 11
his 11
bow 11
his 11
new 11
idea 11
was 11
to 11
use 11
the 11
faculties 11
of 11
oolanga 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
in 11
the 11
service 11

his 11

the 11
steward 11
of 11
the 11
west 11
african 11
who 11
had 11
told 11
him 11
about 11
oolanga 11
and 11
if 11
possible 11
secure 11
any 11
further 11
information 11
and 11
then 11
try 11
to 11
induce 11
by 11
bribery 11
or 11
other 11
means 11
the 11
nigger 11
to 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
brow 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
he 11
himself 11
could 11
have 11
speech 11
of 11
the 11
voodooman 11
he 11
would 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
learn 11
from 11
him 11
something 11
useful 11
davenport 11
was 11
successful 11
in 11
his 11
missions 11
for 11
he 11
had 11
to 11
get 11
another 11
mongoose 11
and 11
he 11
was 11
able 11
to 11
tell 11
adam 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
seen 11
the 11
steward 11
who 11
told 11
him 11
much 11
that 11
he 11
wanted 11
to 11
know 11
and 11
had 11
also 11
arranged 11
for 11
oolanga 11
to 11
come 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
the 11
following 11
day 11
at 11
this 11
point 11
adam 11
saw 11
his 11
way 11
sufficiently 11
clear 11
to 11
admit 11
davenport 11
to 11
some 11
extent 11
into 11
his 11
confidence 11
he 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
bettercertainly 11
at 11
firstnot 11
himself 11
to 11
appear 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
with 11
which 11
davenport 11
was 11
fully 11
competent 11
to 11
deal 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
time 11
for 11
himself 11
to 11
take 11
a 11
personal 11
part 11
when 11
matters 11
had 11
advanced 11
a 11
little 11
further 11
if 11
what 11
the 11
nigger 11
said 11
was 11
in 11
any 11
wise 11
true 11
the 11
man 11
had 11
a 11
rare 11
gift 11
which 11
might 11
be 11
useful 11
in 11
the 11
quest 11
they 11
were 11
after 11
he 11
could 11
as 11
it 11
were 11
smell 11
death 11
if 11
any 11
one 11
was 11
dead 11
if 11
any 11
one 11
had 11
died 11
or 11
if 11
a 11
place 11
had 11
been 11
used 11
in 11
connection 11
with 11
death 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
know 11
the 11
broad 11
fact 11
by 11
intuition 11
adam 11
made 11
up 11
his 11
mind 11
that 11
to 11
test 11
this 11
faculty 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
several 11
places 11
would 11
be 11
his 11
first 11
task 11
naturally 11
he 11
was 11
anxious 11
and 11
the 11
time 11
passed 11
slowly 11
the 11
only 11
comfort 11
was 11
the 11
arrival 11
the 11
next 11
morning 11
of 11
a 11
strong 11
packing 11
case 11
locked 11
from 11
ross 11
the 11
key 11
being 11
in 11
the 11
custody 11
of 11
davenport 11
in 11
the 11
case 11
were 11
two 11
smaller 11
boxes 11
both 11
locked 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
contained 11
a 11
mongoose 11
to 11
replace 11
that 11
killed 11
by 11
lady 11
arabella 11
the 11
other 11
was 11
the 11
special 11
mongoose 11
which 11
had 11
already 11
killed 11
the 11
kingcobra 11
in 11
nepaul 11
when 11
both 11
the 11
animals 11
had 11
been 11
safely 11
put 11
under 11
lock 11
and 11
key 11
he 11
felt 11
that 11
he 11
might 11
breathe 11
more 11
freely 11
no 11
one 11
was 11
allowed 11
to 11
know 11
the 11
secret 11
of 11
their 11
existence 11
in 11
the 11
house 11
except 11
himself 11
and 11
davenport 11
he 11
arranged 11
that 11
davenport 11
should 11
take 11
oolanga 11
round 11
the 11
neighbourhood 11
for 11
a 11
walk 11
stopping 11
at 11
each 11
of 11
the 11
places 11
which 11
he 11
designated 11
having 11
gone 11
all 11
along 11
the 11
brow 11
he 11
was 11
to 11
return 11
the 11
same 11
way 11
and 11
induce 11
him 11
to 11
touch 11
on 11
the 11
same 11
subjects 11
in 11
talking 11
with 11
adam 11
who 11
was 11
to 11
meet 11
them 11
as 11
if 11
by 11
chance 11
at 11
the 11
farthest 11
partthat 11
beyond 11
mercy 11
farm 11
the 11
incidents 11
of 11
the 11
day 11
proved 11
much 11
as 11
adam 11
expected 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
at 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
a 11
few 11
other 11
spots 11
the 11
negro 11
stopped 11
and 11
opening 11
his 11
wide 11
nostrils 11
as 11
if 11
to 11
sniff 11
boldly 11
said 11
that 11
he 11
smelled 11
death 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
always 11
in 11
the 11
same 11
form 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
he 11
said 11
there 11
were 11
many 11
small 11
deaths 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
his 11
bearing 11
was 11
different 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
distinct 11
sense 11
of 11
enjoyment 11
about 11
him 11
especially 11
when 11
he 11
spoke 11
of 11
many 11
great 11
deaths 11
here 11
too 11
he 11
sniffed 11
in 11
a 11
strange 11
way 11
like 11
a 11
bloodhound 11
at 11
check 11
and 11
looked 11
puzzled 11
he 11
said 11
no 11
word 11
in 11
either 11
praise 11
or 11
disparagement 11
but 11
in 11
the 11
centre 11
of 11
the 11
grove 11
where 11
hidden 11
amongst 11
ancient 11
oak 11
stumps 11
was 11
a 11
block 11
of 11
granite 11
slightly 11
hollowed 11
on 11
the 11
top 11
he 11
bent 11
low 11
and 11
placed 11
his 11
forehead 11
on 11
the 11
ground 11
this 11
was 11
the 11
only 11
place 11
where 11
he 11
showed 11
distinct 11
reverence 11
at 11
the 11
castle 11
though 11
he 11
spoke 11
of 11
much 11
death 11
he 11
showed 11
no 11
sign 11
of 11
respect 11
there 11
was 11
evidently 11
something 11
about 11
dianas 11
grove 11
which 11
both 11
interested 11
and 11
baffled 11
him 11
before 11
leaving 11
he 11
moved 11
all 11
over 11
the 11
place 11
unsatisfied 11
and 11
in 11
one 11
spot 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
edge 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
where 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
deep 11
hollow 11
he 11
appeared 11
to 11
be 11
afraid 11
after 11
returning 11
several 11
times 11
to 11
this 11
place 11
he 11
suddenly 11
turned 11
and 11
ran 11
in 11
a 11
panic 11
of 11
fear 11
to 11
the 11
higher 11
ground 11
crossing 11
as 11
he 11
did 11
so 11
the 11
outcropping 11
rock 11
then 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
breathe 11
more 11
freely 11
and 11
recovered 11
some 11
of 11
his 11
jaunty 11
impudence 11
all 11
this 11
seemed 11
to 11
satisfy 11
adams 11
expectations 11
he 11
went 11
back 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
with 11
a 11
serene 11
and 11
settled 11
calm 11
upon 11
him 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
followed 11
him 11
into 11
his 11
study 11
by 11
the 11
way 11
i 11
forgot 11
to 11
ask 11
you 11
details 11
about 11
one 11
thing 11
when 11
that 11
extraordinary 11
staring 11
episode 11
of 11
mr 11
caswall 11
went 11
on 11
how 11
did 11
lilla 11
take 11
ithow 11
did 11
she 11
bear 11
herself 11
she 11
looked 11
frightened 11
and 11
trembled 11
just 11
as 11
i 11
have 11
seen 11
a 11
pigeon 11
with 11
a 11
hawk 11
or 11
a 11
bird 11
with 11
a 11
serpent 11
thanks 11
it 11
is 11
just 11
as 11
i 11
expected 11
there 11
have 11
been 11
circumstances 11
in 11
the 11
caswall 11
family 11
which 11
lead 11
one 11
to 11
believe 11
that 11
they 11
have 11
had 11
from 11
the 11
earliest 11
times 11
some 11
extraordinary 11
mesmeric 11
or 11
hypnotic 11
faculty 11
indeed 11
a 11
skilled 11
eye 11
could 11
read 11
so 11
much 11
in 11
their 11
physiognomy 11
that 11
shot 11
of 11
yours 11
whether 11
by 11
instinct 11
or 11
intention 11
of 11
the 11
hawk 11
and 11
the 11
pigeon 11
was 11
peculiarly 11
apposite 11
i 11
think 11
we 11
may 11
settle 11
on 11
that 11
as 11
a 11
fixed 11
trait 11
to 11
be 11
accepted 11
throughout 11
our 11
investigation 11
when 11
dusk 11
had 11
fallen 11
adam 11
took 11
the 11
new 11
mongoosenot 11
the 11
one 11
from 11
nepauland 11
carrying 11
the 11
box 11
slung 11
over 11
his 11
shoulder 11
strolled 11
towards 11
dianas 11
grove 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
gateway 11
he 11
met 11
lady 11
arabella 11
clad 11
as 11
usual 11
in 11
tightly 11
fitting 11
white 11
which 11
showed 11
off 11
her 11
slim 11
figure 11
to 11
his 11
intense 11
astonishment 11
the 11
mongoose 11
allowed 11
her 11
to 11
pet 11
him 11
take 11
him 11
up 11
in 11
her 11
arms 11
and 11
fondle 11
him 11
as 11
she 11
was 11
going 11
in 11
his 11
direction 11
they 11
walked 11
on 11
together 11
round 11
the 11
roadway 11
between 11
the 11
entrances 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
and 11
lesser 11
hill 11
were 11
many 11
trees 11
with 11
not 11
much 11
foliage 11
except 11
at 11
the 11
top 11
in 11
the 11
dusk 11
this 11
place 11
was 11
shadowy 11
and 11
the 11
view 11
was 11
hampered 11
by 11
the 11
clustering 11
trunks 11
in 11
the 11
uncertain 11
tremulous 11
light 11
which 11
fell 11
through 11
the 11
treetops 11
it 11
was 11
hard 11
to 11
distinguish 11
anything 11
clearly 11
and 11
at 11
last 11
somehow 11
he 11
lost 11
sight 11
of 11
her 11
altogether 11
and 11
turned 11
back 11
on 11
his 11
track 11
to 11
find 11
her 11
presently 11
he 11
came 11
across 11
her 11
close 11
to 11
her 11
own 11
gate 11
she 11
was 11
leaning 11
over 11
the 11
paling 11
of 11
split 11
oak 11
branches 11
which 11
formed 11
the 11
paling 11
of 11
the 11
avenue 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
the 11
mongoose 11
so 11
he 11
asked 11
her 11
where 11
it 11
had 11
gone 11
he 11
slipt 11
out 11
of 11
my 11
arms 11
while 11
i 11
was 11
petting 11
him 11
she 11
answered 11
and 11
disappeared 11
under 11
the 11
hedges 11
they 11
found 11
him 11
at 11
a 11
place 11
where 11
the 11
avenue 11
widened 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
let 11
carriages 11
pass 11
each 11
other 11
the 11
little 11
creature 11
seemed 11
quite 11
changed 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
ebulliently 11
active 11
now 11
he 11
was 11
dull 11
and 11
spiritlessseemed 11
to 11
be 11
dazed 11
he 11
allowed 11
himself 11
to 11
be 11
lifted 11
by 11
either 11
of 11
the 11
pair 11
but 11
when 11
he 11
was 11
alone 11
with 11
lady 11
arabella 11
he 11
kept 11
looking 11
round 11
him 11
in 11
a 11
strange 11
way 11
as 11
though 11
trying 11
to 11
escape 11
when 11
they 11
had 11
come 11
out 11
on 11
the 11
roadway 11
adam 11
held 11
the 11
mongoose 11
tight 11
to 11
him 11
and 11
lifting 11
his 11
hat 11
to 11
his 11
companion 11
moved 11
quickly 11
towards 11
lesser 11
hill 11
he 11
and 11
lady 11
arabella 11
lost 11
sight 11
of 11
each 11
other 11
in 11
the 11
thickening 11
gloom 11
when 11
adam 11
got 11
home 11
he 11
put 11
the 11
mongoose 11
in 11
his 11
box 11
and 11
locked 11
the 11
door 11

safely 11
locked 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
box 11
but 11
he 11
lay 11
quiet 11
and 11
did 11
not 11
stir 11
when 11
he 11
got 11
to 11
his 11
study 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
came 11
in 11
shutting 11
the 11
door 11
behind 11
him 11
i 11
have 11
come 11
he 11
said 11
while 11
we 11
have 11
an 11
opportunity 11
of 11
being 11
alone 11
to 11
tell 11
you 11
something 11
of 11
the 11
caswall 11
family 11
which 11
i 11
think 11
will 11
interest 11
you 11
there 11
is 11
or 11
used 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
belief 11
in 11
this 11
part 11
of 11
the 11
world 11
that 11
the 11
caswall 11
family 11
had 11
some 11
strange 11
power 11
of 11
making 11
the 11
wills 11
of 11
other 11
persons 11
subservient 11
to 11
their 11
own 11
there 11
are 11
many 11
allusions 11
to 11
the 11
subject 11
in 11
memoirs 11
and 11
other 11
unimportant 11
works 11
but 11
i 11
only 11
know 11
of 11
one 11
where 11
the 11
subject 11
is 11
spoken 11
of 11
definitely 11
it 11
is 11
mercia 11

its 11

more 11
than 11
a 11
hundred 11
years 11
ago 11
the 11
author 11
goes 11
into 11
the 11
question 11
of 11
the 11
close 11
association 11
of 11
the 11
then 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
with 11
mesmer 11
in 11
paris 11
he 11
speaks 11
of 11
caswall 11
being 11
a 11
pupil 11
and 11
the 11
fellow 11
worker 11
of 11
mesmer 11
and 11
states 11
that 11
though 11
when 11
the 11
latter 11
left 11
france 11
he 11
took 11
away 11
with 11
him 11
a 11
vast 11
quantity 11
of 11
philosophical 11
and 11
electric 11
instruments 11
he 11
was 11
never 11
known 11
to 11
use 11
them 11
again 11
he 11
once 11
made 11
it 11
known 11
to 11
a 11
friend 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
given 11
them 11
to 11
his 11
old 11
pupil 11
the 11
term 11
he 11
used 11
was 11
odd 11
for 11
it 11
was 11
bequeathed 11
but 11
no 11
such 11
bequest 11
of 11
mesmer 11
was 11
ever 11
made 11
known 11
at 11
any 11
rate 11
the 11
instruments 11
were 11
missing 11
and 11
never 11
turned 11
up 11
a 11
servant 11
came 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
to 11
tell 11
adam 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
some 11
strange 11
noise 11
coming 11
from 11
the 11
locked 11
room 11
into 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
gone 11
when 11
he 11
came 11
in 11
he 11
hurried 11
off 11
to 11
the 11
place 11
at 11
once 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
going 11
with 11
him 11
having 11
locked 11
the 11
door 11
behind 11
them 11
adam 11
opened 11
the 11
packingcase 11
where 11
the 11
boxes 11
of 11
the 11
two 11
mongooses 11
were 11
locked 11
up 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
sound 11
from 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
but 11
from 11
the 11
other 11
a 11
queer 11
restless 11
struggling 11
having 11
opened 11
both 11
boxes 11
he 11
found 11
that 11
the 11
noise 11
was 11
from 11
the 11
nepaul 11
animal 11
which 11
however 11
became 11
quiet 11
at 11
once 11
in 11
the 11
other 11
box 11
the 11
new 11
mongoose 11
lay 11
dead 11
with 11
every 11
appearance 11
of 11
having 11
been 11
strangled 11

xthe 11
kite 11
on 11
the 11
following 11
day 11
a 11
little 11
after 11
four 11
oclock 11
adam 11
set 11
out 11
for 11
mercy 11
he 11
was 11
home 11
just 11
as 11
the 11
clocks 11
were 11
striking 11
six 11
he 11
was 11
pale 11
and 11
upset 11
but 11
otherwise 11
looked 11
strong 11
and 11
alert 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
summed 11
up 11
his 11
appearance 11
and 11
manner 11
thus 11
braced 11
up 11
for 11
battle 11
now 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
settled 11
down 11
to 11
listen 11
looking 11
at 11
adam 11
steadily 11
and 11
listening 11
attentively 11
that 11
he 11
might 11
miss 11
nothing 11
even 11
the 11
inflection 11
of 11
a 11
word 11
i 11
found 11
lilla 11
and 11
mimi 11
at 11
home 11
watford 11
had 11
been 11
detained 11
by 11
business 11
on 11
the 11
farm 11
miss 11
watford 11
received 11
me 11
as 11
kindly 11
as 11
before 11
mimi 11
too 11
seemed 11
glad 11
to 11
see 11
me 11
mr 11
caswall 11
came 11
so 11
soon 11
after 11
i 11
arrived 11
that 11
he 11
or 11
someone 11
on 11
his 11
behalf 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
watching 11
for 11
me 11
he 11
was 11
followed 11
closely 11
by 11
the 11
negro 11
who 11
was 11
puffing 11
hard 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
runningso 11
it 11
was 11
probably 11
he 11
who 11
watched 11
mr 11
caswall 11
was 11
very 11
cool 11
and 11
collected 11
but 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
more 11
than 11
usually 11
iron 11
look 11
about 11
his 11
face 11
that 11
i 11
did 11
not 11
like 11
however 11
we 11
got 11
on 11
very 11
well 11
he 11
talked 11
pleasantly 11
on 11
all 11
sorts 11
of 11
questions 11
the 11
nigger 11
waited 11
a 11
while 11
and 11
then 11
disappeared 11
as 11
on 11
the 11
other 11
occasion 11
mr 11
caswalls 11
eyes 11
were 11
as 11
usual 11
fixed 11
on 11
lilla 11
true 11
they 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
very 11
deep 11
and 11
earnest 11
but 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
offence 11
in 11
them 11
had 11
it 11
not 11
been 11
for 11
the 11
drawing 11
down 11
of 11
the 11
brows 11
and 11
the 11
stern 11
set 11
of 11
the 11
jaws 11
i 11
should 11
not 11
at 11
first 11
have 11
noticed 11
anything 11
but 11
the 11
stare 11
when 11
presently 11
it 11
began 11
increased 11
in 11
intensity 11
i 11
could 11
see 11
that 11
lilla 11
began 11
to 11
suffer 11
from 11
nervousness 11
as 11
on 11
the 11
first 11
occasion 11
but 11
she 11
carried 11
herself 11
bravely 11
however 11
the 11
more 11
nervous 11
she 11
grew 11
the 11
harder 11
mr 11
caswall 11
stared 11
it 11
was 11
evident 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
come 11
prepared 11
for 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
mesmeric 11
or 11
hypnotic 11
battle 11
after 11
a 11
while 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
throw 11
glances 11
round 11
him 11
and 11
then 11
raised 11
his 11
hand 11
without 11
letting 11
either 11
lilla 11
or 11
mimi 11
see 11
the 11
action 11
it 11
was 11
evidently 11
intended 11
to 11
give 11
some 11
sign 11
to 11
the 11
negro 11
for 11
he 11
came 11
in 11
his 11
usual 11
stealthy 11
way 11
quietly 11
in 11
by 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
which 11
was 11
open 11
then 11
mr 11
caswalls 11
efforts 11
at 11
staring 11
became 11
intensified 11
and 11
poor 11
lillas 11
nervousness 11
grew 11
greater 11
mimi 11
seeing 11
that 11
her 11
cousin 11
was 11
distressed 11
came 11
close 11
to 11
her 11
as 11
if 11
to 11
comfort 11
or 11
strengthen 11
her 11
with 11
the 11
consciousness 11
of 11
her 11
presence 11
this 11
evidently 11
made 11
a 11
difficulty 11
for 11
mr 11
caswall 11
for 11
his 11
efforts 11
without 11
appearing 11
to 11
get 11
feebler 11
seemed 11
less 11
effective 11
this 11
continued 11
for 11
a 11
little 11
while 11
to 11
the 11
gain 11
of 11
both 11
lilla 11
and 11
mimi 11
then 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
diversion 11
without 11
word 11
or 11
apology 11
the 11
door 11
opened 11
and 11
lady 11
arabella 11
march 11
entered 11
the 11
room 11
i 11
had 11
seen 11
her 11
coming 11
through 11
the 11
great 11
window 11
without 11
a 11
word 11
she 11
crossed 11
the 11
room 11
and 11
stood 11
beside 11
mr 11
caswall 11
it 11
really 11
was 11
very 11
like 11
a 11
fight 11
of 11
a 11
peculiar 11
kind 11
and 11
the 11
longer 11
it 11
was 11
sustained 11
the 11
more 11
earnestthe 11
fiercerit 11
grew 11
that 11
combination 11
of 11
forcesthe 11
overlord 11
the 11
white 11
woman 11
and 11
the 11
black 11
manwould 11
have 11
cost 11
some 11
probably 11
all 11
of 11
themtheir 11
lives 11
in 11
the 11
southern 11
states 11
of 11
america 11
to 11
us 11
it 11
was 11
simply 11
horrible 11
but 11
all 11
that 11
you 11
can 11
understand 11
this 11
time 11
to 11
go 11
on 11
in 11
sporting 11
phrase 11
it 11
was 11
understood 11
by 11
all 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
fight 11
to 11
a 11
finish 11
and 11
the 11
mixed 11
group 11
did 11
not 11
slacken 11
a 11
moment 11
or 11
relax 11
their 11
efforts 11
on 11
lilla 11
the 11
strain 11
began 11
to 11
tell 11
disastrously 11
she 11
grew 11
palea 11
patchy 11
pallor 11
which 11
meant 11
that 11
her 11
nerves 11
were 11
out 11
of 11
order 11
she 11
trembled 11
like 11
an 11
aspen 11
and 11
though 11
she 11
struggled 11
bravely 11
i 11
noticed 11
that 11
her 11
legs 11
would 11
hardly 11
support 11
her 11
a 11
dozen 11
times 11
she 11
seemed 11
about 11
to 11
collapse 11
in 11
a 11
faint 11
but 11
each 11
time 11
on 11
catching 11
sight 11
of 11
mimis 11
eyes 11
she 11
made 11
a 11
fresh 11
struggle 11
and 11
pulled 11
through 11
by 11
now 11
mr 11
caswalls 11
face 11
had 11
lost 11
its 11
appearance 11
of 11
passivity 11
his 11
eyes 11
glowed 11
with 11
a 11
fiery 11
light 11
he 11
was 11
still 11
the 11
old 11
roman 11
in 11
inflexibility 11
of 11
purpose 11
but 11
grafted 11
on 11
to 11
the 11
roman 11
was 11
a 11
new 11
berserker 11
fury 11
his 11
companions 11
in 11
the 11
baleful 11
work 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
taken 11
on 11
something 11
of 11
his 11
feeling 11
lady 11
arabella 11
looked 11
like 11
a 11
soulless 11
pitiless 11
being 11
not 11
human 11
unless 11
it 11
revived 11
old 11
legends 11
of 11
transformed 11
human 11
beings 11
who 11
had 11
lost 11
their 11
humanity 11
in 11
some 11
transformation 11
or 11
in 11
the 11
sweep 11
of 11
natural 11
savagery 11
as 11
for 11
the 11
negrowell 11
i 11
can 11
only 11
say 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
solely 11
due 11
to 11
the 11
self 11
restraint 11
which 11
you 11
impressed 11
on 11
me 11
that 11
i 11
did 11
not 11
wipe 11
him 11
out 11
as 11
he 11
stoodwithout 11
warning 11
without 11
fair 11
playwithout 11
a 11
single 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
graces 11
of 11
life 11
and 11
death 11
lilla 11
was 11
silent 11
in 11
the 11
helpless 11
concentration 11
of 11
deadly 11
fear 11
mimi 11
was 11
all 11
resolve 11
and 11
self 11
forgetfulness 11
so 11
intent 11
on 11
the 11
soulstruggle 11
in 11
which 11
she 11
was 11
engaged 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
possibility 11
of 11
any 11
other 11
thought 11
as 11
for 11
myself 11
the 11
bonds 11
of 11
will 11
which 11
held 11
me 11
inactive 11
seemed 11
like 11
bands 11
of 11
steel 11
which 11
numbed 11
all 11
my 11
faculties 11
except 11
sight 11
and 11
hearing 11
we 11
seemed 11
fixed 11
in 11
an 11
impasse 11
something 11
must 11
happen 11
though 11
the 11
power 11
of 11
guessing 11
was 11
inactive 11
as 11
in 11
a 11
dream 11
i 11
saw 11
mimis 11
hand 11
move 11
restlessly 11
as 11
if 11
groping 11
for 11
something 11
mechanically 11
it 11
touched 11
that 11
of 11
lilla 11
and 11
in 11
that 11
instant 11
she 11
was 11
transformed 11
it 11
was 11
as 11
if 11
youth 11
and 11
strength 11
entered 11
afresh 11
into 11
something 11
already 11
dead 11
to 11
sensibility 11
and 11
intention 11
as 11
if 11
by 11
inspiration 11
she 11
grasped 11
the 11
others 11
band 11
with 11
a 11
force 11
which 11
blenched 11
the 11
knuckles 11
her 11
face 11
suddenly 11
flamed 11
as 11
if 11
some 11
divine 11
light 11
shone 11
through 11
it 11
her 11
form 11
expanded 11
till 11
it 11
stood 11
out 11
majestically 11
lifting 11
her 11
right 11
hand 11
she 11
stepped 11
forward 11
towards 11
caswall 11
and 11
with 11
a 11
bold 11
sweep 11
of 11
her 11
arm 11
seemed 11
to 11
drive 11
some 11
strange 11
force 11
towards 11
him 11
again 11
and 11
again 11
was 11
the 11
gesture 11
repeated 11
the 11
man 11
falling 11
back 11
from 11
her 11
at 11
each 11
movement 11
towards 11
the 11
door 11
he 11
retreated 11
she 11
following 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
sound 11
as 11
of 11
the 11
cooing 11
sob 11
of 11
doves 11
which 11
seemed 11
to 11
multiply 11
and 11
intensify 11
with 11
each 11
second 11
the 11
sound 11
from 11
the 11
unseen 11
source 11
rose 11
and 11
rose 11
as 11
he 11
retreated 11
till 11
finally 11
it 11
swelled 11
out 11
in 11
a 11
triumphant 11
peal 11
as 11
she 11
with 11
a 11
fierce 11
sweep 11
of 11
her 11
arm 11
seemed 11
to 11
hurl 11
something 11
at 11
her 11
foe 11
and 11
he 11
moving 11
his 11
hands 11
blindly 11
before 11
his 11
face 11
appeared 11
to 11
be 11
swept 11
through 11
the 11
doorway 11
and 11
out 11
into 11
the 11
open 11
sunlight 11
all 11
at 11
once 11
my 11
own 11
faculties 11
were 11
fully 11
restored 11
i 11
could 11
see 11
and 11
hear 11
everything 11
and 11
be 11
fully 11
conscious 11
of 11
what 11
was 11
going 11
on 11
even 11
the 11
figures 11
of 11
the 11
baleful 11
group 11
were 11
there 11
though 11
dimly 11
seen 11
as 11
through 11
a 11
veila 11
shadowy 11
veil 11
i 11
saw 11
lilla 11
sink 11
down 11
in 11
a 11
swoon 11
and 11
mimi 11
throw 11
up 11
her 11
arms 11
in 11
a 11
gesture 11
of 11
triumph 11
as 11
i 11
saw 11
her 11
through 11
the 11
great 11
window 11
the 11
sunshine 11
flooded 11
the 11
landscape 11
which 11
however 11
was 11
momentarily 11
becoming 11
eclipsed 11
by 11
an 11
onrush 11
of 11
a 11
myriad 11
birds 11
by 11
the 11
next 11
morning 11
daylight 11
showed 11
the 11
actual 11
danger 11
which 11
threatened 11
from 11
every 11
part 11
of 11
the 11
eastern 11
counties 11
reports 11
were 11
received 11
concerning 11
the 11
enormous 11
immigration 11
of 11
birds 11
experts 11
were 11
sendingon 11
their 11
own 11
account 11
on 11

of 11

with 11

matter 11
and 11
suggesting 11
remedies 11
the 11
reports 11
closer 11
to 11
home 11
were 11
even 11
more 11
disturbing 11
all 11
day 11
long 11
it 11
would 11
seem 11
that 11
the 11
birds 11
were 11
coming 11
thicker 11
from 11
all 11
quarters 11
doubtless 11
many 11
were 11
going 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
coming 11
but 11
the 11
mass 11
seemed 11
never 11
to 11
get 11
less 11
each 11
bird 11
seemed 11
to 11
sound 11
some 11
note 11
of 11
fear 11
or 11
anger 11
or 11
seeking 11
and 11
the 11
whirring 11
of 11
wings 11
never 11
ceased 11
nor 11
lessened 11
the 11
air 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
a 11
muttered 11
throb 11
no 11
window 11
or 11
barrier 11
could 11
shut 11
out 11
the 11
sound 11
till 11
the 11
ears 11
of 11
any 11
listener 11
became 11
dulled 11
by 11
the 11
ceaseless 11
murmur 11
so 11
monotonous 11
it 11
was 11
so 11
cheerless 11
so 11
disheartening 11
so 11
melancholy 11
that 11
all 11
longed 11
but 11
in 11
vain 11
for 11
any 11
variety 11
no 11
matter 11
how 11
terrible 11
it 11
might 11
be 11
the 11
second 11
morning 11
the 11
reports 11
from 11
all 11
the 11
districts 11
round 11
were 11
more 11
alarming 11
than 11
ever 11
farmers 11
began 11
to 11
dread 11
the 11
coming 11
of 11
winter 11
as 11
they 11
saw 11
the 11
dwindling 11
of 11
the 11
timely 11
fruitfulness 11
of 11
the 11
earth 11
and 11
as 11
yet 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
a 11
warning 11
of 11
evil 11
not 11
the 11
evil 11
accomplished 11
the 11
ground 11
began 11
to 11
look 11
bare 11
whenever 11
some 11
passing 11
sound 11
temporarily 11
frightened 11
the 11
birds 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
tortured 11
his 11
brain 11
for 11
a 11
long 11
time 11
unavailingly 11
to 11
think 11
of 11
some 11
means 11
of 11
getting 11
rid 11
of 11
what 11
he 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
his 11
neighbours 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
regard 11
as 11
a 11
plague 11
of 11
birds 11
at 11
last 11
he 11
recalled 11
a 11
circumstance 11
which 11
promised 11
a 11
solution 11
of 11
the 11
difficulty 11
the 11
experience 11
was 11
of 11
some 11
years 11
ago 11
in 11
china 11
far 11
upcountry 11
towards 11
the 11
headwaters 11
of 11
the 11
yangtzekiang 11
where 11
the 11
smaller 11
tributaries 11
spread 11
out 11
in 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
natural 11
irrigation 11
scheme 11
to 11
supply 11
the 11
wilderness 11
of 11
paddyfields 11
it 11
was 11
at 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
the 11
ripening 11
rice 11
and 11
the 11
myriads 11
of 11
birds 11
which 11
came 11
to 11
feed 11
on 11
the 11
coming 11
crop 11
was 11
a 11
serious 11
menace 11
not 11
only 11
to 11
the 11
district 11
but 11
to 11
the 11
country 11
at 11
large 11
the 11
farmers 11
who 11
were 11
more 11
or 11
less 11
afflicted 11
with 11
the 11
same 11
trouble 11
every 11
season 11
knew 11
how 11
to 11
deal 11
with 11
it 11
they 11
made 11
a 11
vast 11
kite 11
which 11
they 11
caused 11
to 11
be 11
flown 11
over 11
the 11
centre 11
spot 11
of 11
the 11
incursion 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
shaped 11
like 11
a 11
great 11
hawk 11
and 11
the 11
moment 11
it 11
rose 11
into 11
the 11
air 11
the 11
birds 11
began 11
to 11
cower 11
and 11
seek 11
protectionand 11
then 11
to 11
disappear 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
that 11
kite 11
was 11
flying 11
overhead 11
the 11
birds 11
lay 11
low 11
and 11
the 11
crop 11
was 11
saved 11
accordingly 11
caswall 11
ordered 11
his 11
men 11
to 11
construct 11
an 11
immense 11
kite 11
adhering 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
they 11
could 11
to 11
the 11
lines 11
of 11
a 11
hawk 11
then 11
he 11
and 11
his 11
men 11
with 11
a 11
sufficiency 11
of 11
cord 11
began 11
to 11
fly 11
it 11
high 11
overhead 11
the 11
experience 11
of 11
china 11
was 11
repeated 11
the 11
moment 11
the 11
kite 11
rose 11
the 11
birds 11
hid 11
or 11
sought 11
shelter 11
the 11
following 11
morning 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
still 11
flying 11
high 11
no 11
bird 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
as 11
far 11
as 11
the 11
eye 11
could 11
reach 11
from 11
castra 11
regis 11
but 11
there 11
followed 11
in 11
turn 11
what 11
proved 11
even 11
a 11
worse 11
evil 11
all 11
the 11
birds 11
were 11
cowed 11
their 11
sounds 11
stopped 11
neither 11
song 11
nor 11
chirp 11
was 11
heardsilence 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
taken 11
the 11
place 11
of 11
the 11
normal 11
voices 11
of 11
bird 11
life 11
but 11
that 11
was 11
not 11
all 11
the 11
silence 11
spread 11
to 11
all 11
animals 11
the 11
fear 11
and 11
restraint 11
which 11
brooded 11
amongst 11
the 11
denizens 11
of 11
the 11
air 11
began 11
to 11
affect 11
all 11
life 11
not 11
only 11
did 11
the 11
birds 11
cease 11
song 11
or 11
chirp 11
but 11
the 11
lowing 11
of 11
the 11
cattle 11
ceased 11
in 11
the 11
fields 11
and 11
the 11
varied 11
sounds 11
of 11
life 11
died 11
away 11
in 11
place 11
of 11
these 11
things 11
was 11
only 11
a 11
soundless 11
gloom 11
more 11
dreadful 11
more 11
disheartening 11
more 11
soul 11
killing 11
than 11
any 11
concourse 11
of 11
sounds 11
no 11
matter 11
how 11
full 11
of 11
fear 11
and 11
dread 11
pious 11
individuals 11
put 11
up 11
constant 11
prayers 11
for 11
relief 11
from 11
the 11
intolerable 11
solitude 11
after 11
a 11
little 11
there 11
were 11
signs 11
of 11
universal 11
depression 11
which 11
those 11
who 11
ran 11
might 11
read 11
one 11
and 11
all 11
the 11
faces 11
of 11
men 11
and 11
women 11
seemed 11
bereft 11
of 11
vitality 11
of 11
interest 11
of 11
thought 11
and 11
most 11
of 11
all 11
of 11
hope 11
men 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
lost 11
the 11
power 11
of 11
expression 11
of 11
their 11
thoughts 11
the 11
soundless 11
air 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
the 11
same 11
effect 11
as 11
the 11
universal 11
darkness 11
when 11
men 11
gnawed 11
their 11
tongues 11
with 11
pain 11
from 11
this 11
infliction 11
of 11
silence 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
relief 11
everything 11
was 11
affected 11
gloom 11
was 11
the 11
predominant 11
note 11
joy 11
appeared 11
to 11
have 11
passed 11
away 11
as 11
a 11
factor 11
of 11
life 11
and 11
this 11
creative 11
impulse 11
had 11
nothing 11
to 11
take 11
its 11
place 11
that 11
giant 11
spot 11
in 11
high 11
air 11
was 11
a 11
plague 11
of 11
evil 11
influence 11
it 11
seemed 11
like 11
a 11
new 11
misanthropic 11
belief 11
which 11
had 11
fallen 11
on 11
human 11
beings 11
carrying 11
with 11
it 11
the 11
negation 11
of 11

very 11
words 11

well 11
as 11
their 11

seemed 11
to 11
be 11
in 11
chains 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
again 11
tortured 11
his 11
brain 11
to 11
find 11
any 11
antidote 11
or 11
palliative 11
of 11
this 11
greater 11
evil 11
than 11
before 11
he 11
would 11
gladly 11
have 11
destroyed 11
the 11
kite 11
or 11
caused 11
its 11
flying 11
to 11
cease 11
but 11
the 11
instant 11
it 11
was 11
pulled 11
down 11
the 11

rose 11
up 11
in 11

depended 11
in 11

pitiful 11
protests 11
to 11

it 11
was 11
strange 11
indeed 11
what 11
influence 11
that 11
weird 11
kite 11
seemed 11
to 11
exercise 11
even 11
human 11
beings 11
were 11
affected 11
by 11
it 11
as 11
if 11
both 11
it 11
and 11
they 11
were 11
realities 11
as 11
for 11
the 11
people 11
at 11
mercy 11

it 11
was 11
like 11
a 11
taste 11
of 11
actual 11
death 11
lilla 11
felt 11
it 11
most 11
if 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
indeed 11
a 11
real 11
dove 11
with 11
a 11
real 11
kite 11
hanging 11
over 11
her 11
in 11
the 11
air 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
have 11
been 11
more 11
frightened 11
or 11
more 11
affected 11
by 11
the 11
terror 11
this 11
created 11
of 11
course 11
some 11
of 11
those 11
already 11
drawn 11
into 11
the 11
vortex 11
noticed 11
the 11
effect 11
on 11
individuals 11
those 11
who 11
were 11
interested 11
took 11
care 11
to 11
compare 11
their 11
information 11
strangely 11
enough 11
as 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
the 11
others 11
the 11
person 11
who 11
took 11
the 11
ghastly 11
silence 11

the 11

he 11
was 11
not 11
sensitive 11
to 11

afflicted 11
by 11
nerves 11
this 11
alone 11
would 11
not 11
have 11
produced 11
the 11
seeming 11
indifference 11
so 11
they 11
set 11
their 11
minds 11
to 11
discover 11
the 11
real 11
cause 11
adam 11
came 11
quickly 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
for 11
him 11
some 11
compensation 11
that 11
the 11
others 11
did 11
not 11
share 11
and 11
he 11
soon 11
believed 11
that 11
that 11
compensation 11
was 11
in 11
one 11
form 11
or 11
another 11
the 11
enjoyment 11
of 11
the 11

of 11

the 11

to 11
give 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
a 11
new 11
zest 11
for 11
life 11
he 11
was 11
never 11
tired 11
of 11
looking 11
at 11
its 11
movements 11
he 11
had 11
a 11
comfortable 11
armchair 11
put 11
out 11
on 11
the 11
tower 11
wherein 11
he 11
sat 11
sometimes 11
all 11
day 11
long 11
watching 11
as 11
though 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
a 11
new 11
toy 11
and 11
he 11
a 11
child 11
lately 11
come 11
into 11

to 11
have 11
lost 11
interest 11
in 11

for 11
he 11
still 11
paid 11
an 11
occasional 11
visit 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
indeed 11
his 11
feeling 11
towards 11
her 11
whatever 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
at 11
first 11
had 11
now 11
so 11
far 11
changed 11
that 11
it 11
had 11
become 11
a 11
distinct 11
affection 11
of 11
a 11
purely 11
animal 11
kind 11
indeed 11
it 11
seemed 11
as 11
though 11
the 11
mans 11
nature 11
had 11
become 11
corrupted 11
and 11
that 11
all 11
the 11
baser 11
and 11
more 11
selfish 11
and 11
more 11
reckless 11
qualities 11
had 11
become 11
more 11
conspicuous 11
there 11
was 11
not 11
so 11
much 11
sternness 11
apparent 11
in 11
his 11
nature 11
because 11
there 11
was 11
less 11
selfrestraint 11
determination 11
had 11
become 11
indifference 11
the 11
visible 11
change 11
in 11
edgar 11
was 11
that 11
he 11
grew 11
morbid 11
sad 11
silent 11
the 11
neighbours 11
thought 11
he 11
was 11
going 11
mad 11
he 11
became 11
absorbed 11
in 11
the 11
kite 11
and 11
watched 11
it 11
not 11
only 11
by 11
day 11
but 11
often 11
all 11
night 11
long 11
it 11
became 11
an 11
obsession 11
to 11
him 11
caswall 11
took 11
a 11
personal 11
interest 11
in 11
the 11
keeping 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
flying 11
he 11
had 11
a 11
vast 11
coil 11
of 11
cord 11
efficient 11
for 11
the 11
purpose 11
which 11
worked 11
on 11
a 11
roller 11
fixed 11
on 11
the 11
parapet 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
winch 11
for 11
the 11
pulling 11
in 11
of 11
the 11
slack 11
the 11
outgoing 11
line 11
being 11
controlled 11
by 11
a 11
racket 11
there 11
was 11
invariably 11
one 11
man 11
at 11
least 11
day 11
and 11
night 11
on 11
the 11
tower 11
to 11
attend 11
to 11
it 11
at 11
such 11
an 11
elevation 11
there 11
was 11
always 11
a 11
strong 11
wind 11
and 11
at 11
times 11
the 11
kite 11
rose 11
to 11
an 11
enormous 11
height 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
travelling 11
for 11
great 11
distances 11
laterally 11
in 11
fact 11
the 11
kite 11
became 11
in 11
a 11
short 11
time 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
curiosities 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
all 11
around 11
it 11
edgar 11
began 11
to 11
attribute 11
to 11
it 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
mind 11
almost 11
human 11
qualities 11
it 11
became 11
to 11
him 11
a 11
separate 11
entity 11
with 11
a 11
mind 11
and 11
a 11
soul 11
of 11
its 11
own 11
being 11
idlehanded 11
all 11
day 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
apply 11
to 11
what 11
he 11
considered 11
the 11
service 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
some 11
of 11
his 11
spare 11
time 11
and 11
found 11
a 11
new 11
pleasurea 11
new 11
object 11
in 11
lifein 11
the 11
old 11
schoolboy 11
game 11
of 11
sending 11
up 11
runners 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
the 11
way 11
this 11
is 11
done 11
is 11
to 11
get 11
round 11
pieces 11
of 11
paper 11
so 11
cut 11
that 11
there 11
is 11
a 11
hole 11
in 11
the 11
centre 11
through 11
which 11
the 11
string 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
passes 11
the 11
natural 11
action 11
of 11

windpressure 11
takes 11
the 11
paper 11
along 11
the 11
string 11
and 11
so 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
itself 11
no 11
matter 11
how 11
high 11
or 11
how 11
far 11
it 11
may 11
have 11
gone 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
days 11
of 11
this 11
amusement 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
spent 11
hours 11
hundreds 11
of 11
such 11
messengers 11
flew 11
along 11
the 11
string 11
until 11
soon 11
he 11
bethought 11
him 11
of 11
writing 11
messages 11
on 11
these 11
papers 11
so 11
that 11
he 11
could 11
make 11
known 11
his 11
ideas 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
that 11
his 11
brain 11
gave 11
way 11
under 11
the 11
opportunities 11
given 11
by 11
his 11
illusion 11
of 11
the 11
entity 11
of 11
the 11
toy 11
and 11
its 11
power 11
of 11
separate 11
thought 11
from 11
sending 11
messages 11
he 11
came 11
to 11
making 11
direct 11
speech 11
to 11
the 11
kitewithout 11
however 11
ceasing 11
to 11
send 11
the 11
runners 11
doubtless 11
the 11
height 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
seated 11
as 11
it 11
was 11
on 11
the 11
hilltop 11
the 11
rushing 11
of 11
the 11
ceaseless 11
wind 11
the 11
hypnotic 11
effect 11
of 11
the 11
lofty 11
altitude 11
of 11
the 11
speck 11
in 11
the 11
sky 11
at 11
which 11
he 11
gazed 11
and 11
the 11
rushing 11
of 11
the 11
paper 11
messengers 11
up 11
the 11
string 11
till 11
sight 11
of 11
them 11
was 11
lost 11
in 11
distance 11
all 11
helped 11
to 11
further 11
affect 11
his 11
brain 11
undoubtedly 11
giving 11
way 11
under 11
the 11
strain 11
of 11
beliefs 11
and 11
circumstances 11
which 11
were 11
at 11
once 11
stimulating 11
to 11
the 11
imagination 11
occupative 11
of 11
his 11
mind 11
and 11
absorbing 11

caswall 11
who 11
had 11
never 11
before 11
seen 11
any 11
of 11
these 11
things 11
except 11
those 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
collected 11
himself 11
found 11
a 11
constant 11
amusement 11
and 11
interest 11
in 11
them 11
he 11
studied 11
them 11
their 11
uses 11
their 11
mechanism 11
where 11
there 11
was 11
suchand 11
their 11
places 11
of 11
origin 11
until 11
he 11
had 11
an 11
ample 11
and 11
real 11
knowledge 11
of 11
all 11
concerning 11
them 11
many 11
were 11
secret 11
and 11
intricate 11
but 11
he 11
never 11
rested 11
till 11
he 11
found 11
out 11
all 11
the 11
secrets 11
when 11
once 11
he 11
had 11
become 11
interested 11
in 11
strange 11
objects 11
and 11
the 11
way 11
to 11
use 11
them 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
explore 11
various 11
likely 11
places 11
for 11
similar 11
finds 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
inquire 11
of 11
his 11
household 11
where 11
strange 11
lumber 11
was 11
kept 11
several 11
of 11
the 11
men 11
spoke 11
of 11
old 11
simon 11
chester 11
as 11
one 11
who 11
knew 11
everything 11
in 11
and 11
about 11
the 11
house 11
accordingly 11
he 11
sent 11
for 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
who 11
came 11
at 11
once 11
he 11
was 11
very 11
old 11
nearly 11
ninety 11
years 11
of 11
age 11
and 11
very 11
infirm 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
born 11
in 11
the 11
castle 11
and 11
had 11
served 11
its 11
succession 11
of 11
masterspresent 11
or 11
absent 11
ever 11
since 11
when 11
edgar 11
began 11
to 11
question 11
him 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
regarding 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
sent 11
for 11
him 11
old 11
simon 11
exhibited 11
much 11
perturbation 11
in 11
fact 11
he 11
became 11
so 11
frightened 11
that 11
his 11
master 11
fully 11
believing 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
concealing 11
something 11
ordered 11
him 11
to 11
tell 11
at 11
once 11
what 11
remained 11
unseen 11
and 11
where 11
it 11
was 11
hidden 11
away 11
face 11
to 11
face 11
with 11
discovery 11
of 11
his 11
secret 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
in 11
a 11
pitiable 11
state 11
of 11
concern 11
spoke 11
out 11
even 11
more 11
fully 11
than 11
mr 11
caswall 11
had 11
expected 11
indeed 11
indeed 11

away 11
in 11
my 11
time 11

to 11

edgar 11
sharply 11
that 11
i 11
do 11
not 11

round 11
it 11
but 11
no 11

or 11

was 11
carried 11
in 11
by 11
two 11
men 11
shortly 11
afterwards 11
old 11
simon 11
attended 11
his 11
master 11
when 11
he 11
came 11
into 11
the 11

mr 11
caswall 11
himself 11
went 11
and 11
closed 11
the 11
door 11
then 11
he 11
asked 11

i 11
do 11
not 11

the 11
other 11
things 11
by 11
my 11
master 11
to 11
open 11
it 11
would 11
have 11
been 11
a 11
breach 11
of 11
trust 11
caswall 11
sneered 11
quite 11
remarkable 11
leave 11

simon 11

pale 11
and 11
put 11
his 11
trembling 11
hands 11
together 11
oh 11
sir 11
i 11
entreat 11
you 11
not 11
to 11
touch 11
it 11
that 11
trunk 11
probably 11
contains 11
secrets 11
which 11
dr 11
mesmer 11
told 11
my 11
master 11
told 11
them 11
to 11

evil 11

that 11
that 11
time 11
and 11
the 11
evil 11
of 11
it 11
had 11
all 11
passed 11
away 11
that 11
will 11
do 11
go 11

may 11
want 11
you 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
bowed 11
deeply 11
and 11
went 11
out 11

left 11

in 11
the 11
turretroom 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
carefully 11
locked 11
the 11
door 11
and 11
hung 11
a 11
handkerchief 11
over 11
the 11
keyhole 11
next 11
he 11
inspected 11
the 11
windows 11
and 11
saw 11
that 11
they 11
were 11
not 11
overlooked 11
from 11
any 11
angle 11
of 11
the 11
main 11
building 11
then 11
he 11
carefully 11
examined 11
the 11
trunk 11
going 11
over 11
it 11
with 11
a 11
magnifying 11
glass 11
he 11
found 11
it 11
intact 11
the 11
steel 11
bands 11
were 11
flawless 11
the 11
whole 11
trunk 11
was 11
compact 11
after 11
sitting 11
opposite 11
to 11
it 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
and 11
the 11
shades 11
of 11
evening 11
beginning 11
to 11
melt 11
into 11
darkness 11
he 11
gave 11
up 11
the 11
task 11
and 11
went 11
to 11
his 11
bedroom 11
after 11
locking 11
the 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
turretroom 11
behind 11
him 11
and 11
taking 11
away 11
the 11
key 11
he 11
woke 11
in 11
the 11
morning 11
at 11
daylight 11
and 11
resumed 11
his 11
patient 11
but 11
unavailing 11
study 11
of 11
the 11
metal 11
trunk 11
this 11
he 11
continued 11
during 11
the 11
whole 11
day 11
with 11
the 11
same 11
resulthumiliating 11
disappointment 11
which 11
overwrought 11
his 11
nerves 11
and 11
made 11
his 11
head 11
ache 11
the 11
result 11
of 11
the 11
long 11
strain 11
was 11
seen 11
later 11
in 11
the 11
afternoon 11
when 11
he 11
sat 11
locked 11
within 11
the 11
turretroom 11
before 11
the 11
still 11
baffling 11
trunk 11
distrait 11
listless 11
and 11
yet 11
agitated 11
sunk 11
in 11
a 11
settled 11
gloom 11
as 11
the 11
dusk 11
was 11
falling 11
he 11
told 11
the 11
steward 11
to 11
send 11
him 11
two 11
men 11
strong 11
ones 11
these 11
he 11
ordered 11
to 11
take 11
the 11
trunk 11
to 11
his 11
bedroom 11
in 11
that 11
room 11
he 11
then 11
sat 11
on 11
into 11
the 11
night 11
without 11
pausing 11
even 11
to 11
take 11
any 11
food 11
his 11
mind 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
whirl 11
a 11
fever 11
of 11
excitement 11
the 11
result 11
was 11
that 11
when 11
late 11
in 11
the 11
night 11
he 11
locked 11
himself 11
in 11
his 11
room 11
his 11
brain 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
odd 11
fancies 11
he 11
was 11
on 11
the 11
high 11
road 11
to 11
mental 11
disturbance 11
he 11
lay 11
down 11
on 11
his 11
bed 11
in 11
the 11
dark 11
still 11
brooding 11
over 11
the 11
mystery 11
of 11
the 11
closed 11
trunk 11
gradually 11
he 11
yielded 11
to 11
the 11
influences 11
of 11
silence 11
and 11
darkness 11
after 11
lying 11
there 11
quietly 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
his 11
mind 11
became 11
active 11
again 11
but 11
this 11
time 11
there 11
were 11
round 11
him 11
no 11
disturbing 11
influences 11
his 11
brain 11
was 11
active 11
and 11
able 11
to 11
work 11
freely 11
and 11
to 11
deal 11
with 11
memory 11
a 11
thousand 11
forgottenor 11
only 11

fragments 11
of 11
conversations 11
or 11
theories 11
long 11
ago 11
guessed 11
at 11
and 11
long 11
forgotten 11
crowded 11
on 11
his 11
mind 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
hear 11
again 11
around 11
him 11
the 11
legions 11
of 11
whirring 11
wings 11
to 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
so 11
lately 11
accustomed 11
even 11
to 11
himself 11
he 11
knew 11
that 11
that 11
was 11
an 11
effort 11
of 11
imagination 11
founded 11
on 11
imperfect 11
memory 11
but 11
he 11
was 11
content 11
that 11
imagination 11
should 11
work 11
for 11
out 11
of 11
it 11
might 11
come 11
some 11
solution 11
of 11
the 11
mystery 11
which 11
surrounded 11
him 11
and 11
in 11
this 11
frame 11
of 11
mind 11
sleep 11
made 11
another 11
and 11
more 11
successful 11
essay 11
this 11
time 11
he 11
enjoyed 11
peaceful 11
slumber 11
restful 11
alike 11
to 11
his 11
wearied 11
body 11
and 11
his 11
overwrought 11
brain 11
in 11
his 11
sleep 11
he 11
arose 11
and 11
as 11
if 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
some 11
influence 11
beyond 11
and 11
greater 11
than 11
himself 11
lifted 11
the 11
great 11
trunk 11
and 11
set 11
it 11
on 11
a 11
strong 11
table 11
at 11
one 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
from 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
previously 11
removed 11
a 11
quantity 11
of 11
books 11
to 11
do 11
this 11
he 11
had 11
to 11
use 11
an 11
amount 11
of 11
strength 11
which 11
was 11
he 11
knew 11
far 11
beyond 11
him 11
in 11
his 11
normal 11
state 11
as 11
it 11
was 11
it 11
seemed 11
easy 11
enough 11
everything 11
yielded 11
before 11
his 11
touch 11
then 11
he 11
became 11
conscious 11
that 11
somehowhow 11
he 11
never 11
could 11
rememberthe 11
chest 11
was 11
open 11
he 11
unlocked 11
his 11
door 11
and 11
taking 11
the 11
chest 11
on 11
his 11
shoulder 11
carried 11
it 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
turret 11
room 11
the 11
door 11
of 11
which 11
also 11
he 11
unlocked 11
even 11
at 11
the 11
time 11
he 11
was 11
amazed 11
at 11
his 11
own 11
strength 11
and 11
wondered 11
whence 11
it 11
had 11
come 11
his 11
mind 11
lost 11
in 11
conjecture 11
was 11
too 11
far 11
off 11
to 11
realise 11
more 11
immediate 11
things 11
he 11
knew 11
that 11
the 11
chest 11
was 11
enormously 11
heavy 11
he 11
seemed 11
in 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
vision 11
which 11
lit 11
up 11
the 11
absolute 11
blackness 11
around 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
two 11
sturdy 11
servant 11
men 11
staggering 11
under 11
its 11
great 11
weight 11
he 11
locked 11
himself 11
again 11
in 11
the 11
turretroom 11
and 11
laid 11
the 11
opened 11
chest 11
on 11
a 11
table 11
and 11
in 11
the 11
darkness 11
began 11
to 11
unpack 11
it 11
laying 11
out 11
the 11
contents 11
which 11
were 11
mainly 11
of 11
metal 11
and 11
glassgreat 11
pieces 11
in 11
strange 11
formson 11
another 11
table 11
he 11
was 11
conscious 11
of 11
being 11
still 11
asleep 11
and 11
of 11
acting 11
rather 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
some 11
unseen 11
and 11
unknown 11
command 11
than 11
in 11
accordance 11
with 11
any 11
reasonable 11
plan 11
to 11
be 11
followed 11
by 11
results 11
which 11
he 11
understood 11
this 11
phase 11
completed 11
he 11
proceeded 11
to 11
arrange 11
in 11
order 11
the 11
component 11
parts 11
of 11
some 11
large 11
instruments 11
formed 11
mostly 11
of 11
glass 11
his 11
fingers 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
acquired 11
a 11
new 11
and 11
exquisite 11
subtlety 11
and 11
even 11
a 11
volition 11
of 11
their 11
own 11
then 11
weariness 11
of 11
brain 11
came 11
upon 11
him 11
his 11
head 11
sank 11
down 11
on 11
his 11
breast 11
and 11
little 11
by 11
little 11
everything 11
became 11
wrapped 11
in 11
gloom 11
he 11
awoke 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
in 11
his 11
bedroom 11
and 11
looked 11
around 11
him 11
now 11
clearheaded 11
in 11
amazement 11
in 11
its 11
usual 11
place 11
on 11
the 11
strong 11
table 11
stood 11
the 11
great 11
steelhooped 11
chest 11
without 11
lock 11
or 11
key 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
now 11
locked 11
he 11
arose 11
quietly 11
and 11
stole 11
to 11
the 11
turretroom 11
there 11
everything 11
was 11
as 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
on 11
the 11
previous 11
evening 11
he 11
looked 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
window 11
where 11
high 11
in 11
air 11
flew 11
as 11
usual 11
the 11
giant 11
kite 11
he 11
unlocked 11
the 11
wicket 11
gate 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
stair 11
and 11
went 11
out 11
on 11
the 11
roof 11
close 11
to 11
him 11
was 11
the 11
great 11
coil 11
of 11
cord 11
on 11
its 11
reel 11
it 11
was 11
humming 11
in 11
the 11
morning 11
breeze 11
and 11
when 11
he 11
touched 11
the 11
string 11
it 11
sent 11
a 11
quick 11
thrill 11
through 11
hand 11
and 11
arm 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
sign 11
anywhere 11
that 11
there 11
had 11
been 11
any 11
disturbance 11
or 11
displacement 11
of 11
anything 11
during 11
the 11
night 11
utterly 11
bewildered 11
he 11
sat 11
down 11
in 11
his 11
room 11
to 11
think 11
now 11
for 11
the 11
first 11
time 11
he 11
felt 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
asleep 11
and 11
dreaming 11
presently 11
he 11
fell 11
asleep 11
again 11
and 11
slept 11
for 11
a 11
long 11
time 11
he 11
awoke 11
hungry 11
and 11
made 11
a 11
hearty 11
meal 11
then 11
towards 11
evening 11
having 11
locked 11
himself 11
in 11
he 11
fell 11
asleep 11
again 11
when 11
he 11
woke 11
he 11
was 11
in 11
darkness 11
and 11
was 11
quite 11
at 11
sea 11
as 11
to 11
his 11
whereabouts 11
he 11
began 11
feeling 11
about 11
the 11
dark 11
room 11
and 11
was 11
recalled 11
to 11
the 11
consequences 11
of 11
his 11
position 11
by 11
the 11
breaking 11
of 11
a 11
large 11
piece 11
of 11
glass 11
having 11
obtained 11
a 11
light 11
he 11
discovered 11
this 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
glass 11
wheel 11
part 11
of 11
an 11
elaborate 11
piece 11
of 11
mechanism 11
which 11
he 11
must 11
in 11
his 11
sleep 11
have 11
taken 11
from 11
the 11
chest 11
which 11
was 11
now 11
opened 11
he 11
had 11
once 11
again 11
opened 11
it 11
whilst 11
asleep 11
but 11
he 11
had 11
no 11
recollection 11
of 11
the 11
circumstances 11
caswall 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
there 11
had 11
been 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
dual 11
action 11
of 11
his 11
mind 11
which 11
might 11
lead 11
to 11
some 11
catastrophe 11
or 11
some 11
discovery 11
of 11
his 11
secret 11
plans 11
so 11
he 11
resolved 11
to 11
forgo 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
the 11
pleasure 11
of 11
making 11
discoveries 11
regarding 11
the 11
chest 11
to 11
this 11
end 11
he 11
applied 11
himself 11
to 11
quite 11
another 11
matteran 11
investigation 11
of 11
the 11
other 11
treasures 11
and 11
rare 11
objects 11
in 11
his 11
collections 11
he 11
went 11
amongst 11
them 11
in 11
simple 11
idle 11
curiosity 11
his 11
main 11
object 11
being 11
to 11
discover 11
some 11
strange 11
item 11
which 11
he 11
might 11
use 11
for 11
experiment 11
with 11
the 11
kite 11
he 11
had 11
already 11
resolved 11
to 11
try 11
some 11
runners 11
other 11
than 11
those 11
made 11
of 11
paper 11
he 11
had 11
a 11
vague 11
idea 11
that 11
with 11
such 11
a 11
force 11
as 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
straining 11
at 11
its 11
leash 11
this 11
might 11
be 11
used 11
to 11
lift 11
to 11
the 11
altitude 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
itself 11
heavier 11
articles 11
his 11
first 11
experiment 11
with 11
articles 11
of 11
little 11
but 11
increasing 11
weight 11
was 11
eminently 11
successful 11
so 11
he 11
added 11
by 11
degrees 11
more 11
and 11
more 11
weight 11
until 11
he 11
found 11
out 11
that 11
the 11
lifting 11
power 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
considerable 11
he 11
then 11
determined 11
to 11
take 11
a 11
step 11
further 11
and 11
send 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
articles 11
which 11
lay 11
in 11
the 11
steelhooped 11
chest 11
the 11
last 11
time 11
he 11
had 11
opened 11
it 11
in 11
sleep 11
it 11
had 11
not 11
been 11
shut 11
again 11
and 11
he 11
had 11
inserted 11
a 11
wedge 11
so 11
that 11
he 11
could 11
open 11
it 11
at 11
will 11
he 11
made 11
examination 11
of 11
the 11
contents 11
but 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
the 11
glass 11
objects 11
were 11
unsuitable 11
they 11
were 11
too 11
light 11
for 11
testing 11
weight 11
and 11
they 11
were 11
so 11
frail 11
as 11
to 11
be 11
dangerous 11
to 11
send 11
to 11
such 11
a 11
height 11
so 11
he 11
looked 11
around 11
for 11
something 11
more 11
solid 11
with 11
which 11
to 11
experiment 11
his 11
eye 11
caught 11
sight 11
of 11
an 11
object 11
which 11
at 11
once 11
attracted 11
him 11
this 11
was 11
a 11
small 11
copy 11
of 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
ancient 11
egyptian 11
godsthat 11
of 11
bes 11
who 11
represented 11
the 11
destructive 11
power 11
of 11
nature 11
it 11
was 11
so 11
bizarre 11
and 11
mysterious 11
as 11
to 11
commend 11
itself 11
to 11
his 11
mad 11
humour 11
in 11
lifting 11
it 11
from 11
the 11
cabinet 11
he 11
was 11
struck 11
by 11
its 11
great 11
weight 11
in 11
proportion 11
to 11
its 11
size 11
he 11
made 11
accurate 11
examination 11
of 11
it 11
by 11
the 11
aid 11
of 11
some 11
instruments 11
and 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
carved 11
from 11
a 11
lump 11
of 11
lodestone 11
he 11
remembered 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
read 11
somewhere 11
of 11
an 11
ancient 11
egyptian 11
god 11
cut 11
from 11
a 11
similar 11
substance 11
and 11
thinking 11
it 11
over 11
he 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
he 11
must 11
have 11
read 11
it 11
in 11
sir 11
thomas 11
browns 11
popular 11
errors 11
a 11
book 11
of 11
the 11
seventeenth 11
century 11
he 11
got 11
the 11
book 11
from 11
the 11
library 11
and 11
looked 11
out 11
the 11
passage 11
a 11
great 11
example 11
we 11
have 11
from 11
the 11
observation 11
of 11
our 11
learned 11

from 11
the 11
very 11
first 11
he 11
seemed 11
difficile 11
but 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
keeping 11
to 11
his 11
own 11
room 11
ever 11
since 11
his 11

with 11

on 11
that 11
occasion 11
lady 11

shown 11
him 11
in 11
an 11
unmistakable 11
way 11
what 11
her 11
feelings 11
were 11
indeed 11
she 11
had 11
made 11
it 11
known 11
to 11
him 11
in 11
a 11
more 11

way 11
than 11

the 11
moment 11

she 11
had 11
gone 11
across 11
the 11
room 11
to 11
stand 11
beside 11
him 11
in 11
his 11
mesmeric 11
struggle 11
had 11
been 11
the 11
very 11
limit 11
of 11
her 11
voluntary 11
action 11
it 11
was 11
quite 11
bitter 11
enough 11
she 11
felt 11
that 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
come 11
to 11
her 11
but 11
now 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
made 11
that 11
advance 11
she 11
felt 11
that 11
any 11
withdrawal 11
on 11
his 11
part 11
would 11
to 11
a 11
woman 11
of 11
her 11
class 11
be 11
nothing 11
less 11
than 11
a 11
flaming 11
insult 11
had 11
she 11
not 11
classed 11
herself 11
with 11
his 11
nigger 11
servant 11
an 11
unreformed 11
savage 11
had 11
she 11
not 11
shown 11
her 11
preference 11
for 11
him 11
at 11
the 11
festival 11
of 11
his 11
homecoming 11
had 11
she 11
not 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
coldblooded 11
and 11
she 11
was 11
prepared 11
to 11
go 11
through 11
all 11
that 11
might 11
be 11
necessary 11
of 11
indifference 11
and 11
even 11
insult 11
to 11
become 11

show 11
no 11
hurryshe 11
must 11
wait 11
she 11
might 11
in 11
an 11
unostentatious 11
way 11
come 11
to 11
him 11
again 11
she 11
knew 11
him 11
now 11
and 11
could 11
make 11
a 11
keen 11
guess 11
at 11
his 11
desires 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
lilla 11
watford 11
with 11
that 11
secret 11
in 11
her 11
possession 11
she 11
could 11
bring 11
pressure 11
to 11
bear 11
on 11
caswall 11
which 11
would 11
make 11
it 11
no 11
easy 11
matter 11
for 11
him 11
to 11
evade 11
her 11
the 11
great 11
difficulty 11
was 11
how 11
to 11
get 11
near 11
him 11
he 11
was 11
shut 11
up 11
within 11
his 11
castle 11
and 11
guarded 11
by 11
a 11
defence 11
of 11
convention 11
which 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
pass 11
without 11
danger 11
of 11
ill 11
repute 11
to 11
herself 11
over 11
this 11
question 11
she 11
thought 11
and 11
thought 11
for 11
days 11
and 11
nights 11
at 11
last 11
she 11
decided 11
that 11
the 11
only 11
way 11
would 11
be 11
to 11
go 11
to 11
him 11
openly 11
at 11
castra 11
regis 11
her 11
rank 11
and 11
position 11
would 11
make 11
such 11
a 11
thing 11
possible 11
if 11
carefully 11
done 11
she 11
could 11
explain 11
matters 11
afterwards 11
if 11
necessary 11
then 11
when 11
they 11
were 11
alone 11
she 11
would 11
use 11
her 11
arts 11
and 11
her 11
experience 11
to 11
make 11
him 11
commit 11
himself 11
after 11
all 11
he 11
was 11
only 11
a 11
man 11
with 11
a 11
mans 11
dislike 11
of 11
difficult 11
or 11
awkward 11
situations 11
she 11
felt 11
quite 11
sufficient 11
confidence 11
in 11
her 11
own 11
womanhood 11
to 11
carry 11
her 11
through 11
any 11
difficulty 11
which 11
might 11
arise 11
from 11
dianas 11
grove 11
she 11
heard 11
each 11
day 11
the 11
luncheongong 11
from 11
castra 11
regis 11
sound 11
and 11
knew 11
the 11
hour 11
when 11
the 11
servants 11
would 11
be 11
in 11
the 11
back 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
she 11
would 11
enter 11
the 11
house 11
at 11
that 11
hour 11
and 11
pretending 11
that 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
make 11
anyone 11
hear 11
her 11
would 11
seek 11
him 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
rooms 11
the 11
tower 11
was 11
she 11
knew 11
away 11
from 11
all 11
the 11
usual 11
sounds 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
and 11
moreover 11
she 11
knew 11
that 11
the 11
servants 11
had 11
strict 11
orders 11
not 11
to 11
interrupt 11
him 11
when 11
he 11
was 11
in 11
the 11
turret 11
chamber 11
she 11
had 11
found 11
out 11
partly 11
by 11
the 11
aid 11
of 11
an 11
operaglass 11
and 11
partly 11
by 11
judicious 11
questioning 11
that 11
several 11
times 11
lately 11
a 11
heavy 11
chest 11
had 11
been 11
carried 11
to 11
and 11
from 11
his 11
room 11
and 11
that 11
it 11
rested 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
each 11
night 11
she 11
was 11
therefore 11
confident 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
some 11
important 11
work 11
on 11
hand 11
which 11
would 11
keep 11
him 11
busy 11
for 11
long 11
spells 11
meanwhile 11
another 11
member 11
of 11
the 11
household 11
at 11
castra 11
regis 11
had 11
schemes 11
which 11
he 11
thought 11
were 11
working 11
to 11
fruition 11
a 11
man 11
in 11
the 11
position 11
of 11
a 11
servant 11
has 11
plenty 11
of 11
opportunity 11
of 11
watching 11
his 11
betters 11
and 11
forming 11
opinions 11
regarding 11
them 11
oolanga 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
way 11
a 11
clever 11
unscrupulous 11
rogue 11
and 11
he 11
felt 11
that 11
with 11
things 11
moving 11
round 11
him 11
in 11
this 11
great 11
household 11
there 11
should 11
be 11
opportunities 11
of 11
selfadvancement 11
being 11
unscrupulous 11
and 11
stealthyand 11
a 11
savagehe 11
looked 11
to 11
dishonest 11
means 11
he 11
saw 11
plainly 11
enough 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
making 11
a 11
dead 11
set 11
at 11
his 11
master 11
and 11
he 11
was 11
watchful 11
of 11
the 11
slightest 11
sign 11
of 11
anything 11
which 11
might 11
enhance 11
this 11
knowledge 11
like 11
the 11
other 11
men 11
in 11
the 11
house 11
he 11
knew 11
of 11
the 11
carrying 11
to 11
and 11
fro 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
chest 11
and 11
had 11
got 11
it 11
into 11
his 11
head 11
that 11
the 11
care 11
exercised 11
in 11
its 11
porterage 11
indicated 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
treasure 11
he 11
was 11
for 11
ever 11
lurking 11
around 11
the 11
turretrooms 11
on 11
the 11
chance 11
of 11
making 11
some 11
useful 11
discovery 11
but 11
he 11
was 11
as 11
cautious 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
stealthy 11
and 11
took 11
care 11
that 11
no 11
one 11
else 11
watched 11
him 11
it 11
was 11
thus 11
that 11
the 11
negro 11
became 11
aware 11
of 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
venture 11
into 11
the 11
house 11
as 11
she 11
thought 11
unseen 11
he 11
took 11
more 11
care 11
than 11
ever 11
since 11
he 11
was 11
watching 11
another 11
that 11
the 11
positions 11
were 11
not 11
reversed 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
he 11
kept 11
his 11
eyes 11
and 11
ears 11
open 11
and 11
his 11
mouth 11
shut 11
seeing 11
lady 11
arabella 11
gliding 11
up 11
the 11
stairs 11
towards 11
his 11
masters 11
room 11
he 11
took 11
it 11
for 11
granted 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
there 11
for 11
no 11
good 11
and 11
doubled 11
his 11
watching 11
intentness 11
and 11
caution 11
oolanga 11
was 11
disappointed 11
but 11
he 11
dared 11
not 11
exhibit 11
any 11
feeling 11
lest 11
it 11
should 11
betray 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
hiding 11
therefore 11
he 11
slunk 11
downstairs 11
again 11
noiselessly 11
and 11
waited 11
for 11
a 11
more 11
favourable 11
opportunity 11
of 11
furthering 11
his 11
plans 11
it 11
must 11
be 11
borne 11
in 11
mind 11
that 11
he 11
thought 11
that 11
the 11
heavy 11
trunk 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
valuables 11
and 11
that 11
he 11
believed 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
try 11
to 11
steal 11
it 11
his 11
purpose 11
of 11
using 11
for 11
his 11
own 11
advantage 11
the 11
combination 11
of 11
these 11
two 11
ideas 11
was 11
seen 11
later 11
in 11
the 11
day 11
oolanga 11
secretly 11
followed 11
her 11
home 11
he 11
was 11
an 11
expert 11
at 11
this 11
game 11
and 11
succeeded 11
admirably 11
on 11
this 11
occasion 11
he 11
watched 11
her 11
enter 11
the 11
private 11
gate 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
and 11
then 11
taking 11
a 11
roundabout 11
course 11
and 11
keeping 11
out 11
of 11
her 11
sight 11
he 11
at 11
last 11
overtook 11
her 11
in 11
a 11
thick 11
part 11
of 11
the 11
grove 11
where 11
no 11
one 11
could 11
see 11
the 11
meeting 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
much 11
surprised 11
she 11
had 11
not 11
seen 11
the 11
negro 11
for 11
several 11
days 11
and 11
had 11
almost 11
forgotten 11
his 11
existence 11
oolanga 11
would 11
have 11
been 11
startled 11
had 11
he 11
known 11
and 11
been 11
capable 11
of 11
understanding 11
the 11
real 11
value 11
placed 11
on 11
him 11
his 11
beauty 11
his 11
worthiness 11
by 11
other 11
persons 11
and 11
compared 11
it 11
with 11
the 11
value 11
in 11
these 11
matters 11
in 11
which 11
he 11
held 11
himself 11
doubtless 11
oolanga 11
had 11
his 11
dreams 11
like 11
other 11
men 11
in 11
such 11
cases 11
he 11
saw 11
himself 11
as 11
a 11
young 11
sungod 11
as 11
beautiful 11
as 11
the 11
eye 11
of 11
dusky 11
or 11
even 11
white 11
womanhood 11
had 11
ever 11
dwelt 11
upon 11
he 11
would 11
have 11
been 11
filled 11
with 11
all 11
noble 11
and 11
captivating 11
qualitiesor 11
those 11
regarded 11
as 11
such 11
in 11
west 11
africa 11
women 11
would 11
have 11
loved 11
him 11
and 11
would 11
have 11
told 11
him 11
so 11
in 11
the 11
overt 11
and 11
fervid 11
manner 11
usual 11
in 11
affairs 11
of 11
the 11
heart 11
in 11
the 11
shadowy 11
depths 11
of 11
the 11
forest 11
of 11
the 11
gold 11
coast 11
oolanga 11
came 11
close 11
behind 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
in 11
a 11
hushed 11
voice 11
suitable 11
to 11
the 11
importance 11
of 11
his 11
task 11
and 11
in 11
deference 11
to 11
the 11
respect 11
he 11
had 11
for 11
her 11
and 11
the 11
place 11
began 11
to 11
unfold 11
the 11
story 11
of 11
his 11
love 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
not 11
usually 11
a 11
humorous 11
person 11
but 11
no 11
man 11
or 11
woman 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
race 11
could 11
have 11
checked 11
the 11
laughter 11
which 11
rose 11
spontaneously 11
to 11
her 11
lips 11
the 11
circumstances 11
were 11
too 11
grotesque 11
the 11
contrast 11
too 11
violent 11
for 11
subdued 11
mirth 11
the 11
man 11
a 11
debased 11
specimen 11
of 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
most 11
primitive 11
races 11
of 11
the 11
earth 11
and 11
of 11
an 11
ugliness 11
which 11
was 11
simply 11
devilish 11
the 11
woman 11
of 11
high 11
degree 11
beautiful 11
accomplished 11
she 11
thought 11
that 11
her 11
first 11
moments 11
consideration 11
of 11
the 11
outrageit 11
was 11
nothing 11
less 11
in 11
her 11
eyeshad 11
given 11
her 11
the 11
full 11
material 11
for 11
thought 11
but 11
every 11
instant 11
after 11
threw 11
new 11
and 11
varied 11
lights 11
on 11
the 11
affront 11
her 11
indignation 11
was 11
too 11
great 11
for 11
passion 11
only 11
irony 11
or 11
satire 11
would 11
meet 11
the 11
situation 11
her 11
cold 11
cruel 11
nature 11
helped 11
and 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
shrink 11
to 11
subject 11
this 11
ignorant 11
savage 11
to 11
the 11
merciless 11
firelash 11
of 11
her 11
scorn 11
oolanga 11
was 11
dimly 11
conscious 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
being 11
flouted 11
but 11
his 11
anger 11
was 11
no 11
less 11
keen 11
because 11
of 11
the 11
measure 11
of 11
his 11
ignorance 11
so 11
he 11
gave 11
way 11
to 11
it 11
as 11
does 11
a 11
tortured 11
beast 11
he 11
ground 11
his 11
great 11
teeth 11
together 11
raved 11
stamped 11
and 11
swore 11
in 11
barbarous 11
tongues 11
and 11
with 11
barbarous 11
imagery 11
even 11
lady 11
arabella 11
felt 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
well 11
she 11
was 11
within 11
reach 11
of 11
help 11
or 11
he 11
might 11
have 11
offered 11
her 11
brutal 11
violence 11
even 11
have 11
killed 11
her 11
am 11
i 11
to 11
understand 11
she 11
said 11
with 11
cold 11
disdain 11
so 11
much 11
more 11
effective 11
to 11
wound 11
than 11
hot 11
passion 11
that 11
you 11
are 11
offering 11
me 11
your 11
love 11
yourlove 11
for 11
reply 11
he 11
nodded 11
his 11
head 11
the 11
scorn 11
of 11
her 11
voice 11
in 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
baleful 11
hiss 11
soundedand 11
feltlike 11

lash 11

of 11
a 11

a 11

rid 11
the 11
earth 11
of 11
you 11
as 11
she 11
was 11
speaking 11
she 11
had 11
taken 11
out 11
her 11
revolver 11
and 11
was 11
pointing 11
it 11
at 11
him 11
in 11
the 11
immediate 11
presence 11
of 11
death 11
his 11
impudence 11
forsook 11
him 11
and 11
he 11
made 11
a 11
weak 11
effort 11
to 11
justify 11
himself 11
his 11
speech 11
was 11
short 11
consisting 11
of 11
single 11
words 11
to 11
lady 11
arabella 11
it 11
sounded 11
mere 11
gibberish 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
dialect 11
and 11
meant 11
love 11
marriage 11
wife 11
from 11
the 11
intonation 11
of 11
the 11
words 11
she 11
guessed 11
with 11
her 11
womans 11
quick 11
intuition 11
at 11
their 11
meaning 11
but 11
she 11
quite 11
failed 11
to 11
follow 11
when 11
becoming 11
more 11
pressing 11
he 11
continued 11
to 11
urge 11
his 11
suit 11
in 11
a 11
mixture 11
of 11
the 11
grossest 11
animal 11
passion 11
and 11
ridiculous 11
threats 11
he 11
warned 11
her 11
that 11
he 11
knew 11
she 11
had 11
tried 11
to 11
steal 11
his 11
masters 11
treasure 11
and 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
caught 11
her 11
in 11
the 11
act 11
but 11
if 11
she 11
would 11
be 11
his 11
he 11
would 11
share 11
the 11
treasure 11
with 11
her 11
and 11
they 11
could 11
live 11
in 11
luxury 11
in 11
the 11
african 11
forests 11
but 11
if 11
she 11
refused 11
he 11
would 11
tell 11
his 11
master 11
who 11
would 11
flog 11
and 11
torture 11
her 11
and 11
then 11
give 11
her 11
to 11
the 11
police 11
who 11
would 11
kill 11
her 11

the 11
consequences 11
of 11

of 11

farreaching 11
and 11
not 11

the 11
two 11
engaged 11
in 11
it 11
from 11
oolanga 11
this 11
might 11
have 11
been 11
expected 11
by 11
anyone 11
who 11
knew 11
the 11
character 11
of 11
the 11

left 11
the 11
grove 11
with 11
an 11
absorbing 11
hatred 11
in 11
his 11
heart 11
his 11
lust 11
and 11
greed 11
were 11
afire 11
while 11
his 11
vanity 11
had 11
been 11
wounded 11
to 11
the 11
core 11
lady 11

icy 11
nature 11
was 11
not 11
so 11
deeply 11
stirred 11
though 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
seething 11
passion 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
she 11
was 11
set 11
upon 11
bringing 11
edgar 11

to 11
her 11
feet 11
the 11
obstacles 11
she 11
had 11
encountered 11
the 11
insults 11
she 11
had 11
endured 11
were 11
only 11
as 11
fuel 11
to 11
the 11
purpose 11
of 11
revenge 11
which 11
consumed 11
her 11
as 11
she 11
sought 11
her 11
own 11
rooms 11
in 11
dianas 11
grove 11
she 11
went 11
over 11
the 11
whole 11
subject 11
again 11
and 11
again 11
always 11
finding 11
in 11
the 11
face 11
of 11
lilla 11
watford 11
a 11
key 11
to 11

wrote 11
a 11
note 11
taking 11
so 11
much 11
trouble 11
over 11
it 11
that 11

copied 11
out 11
the 11

afresh 11

then 11
carefully 11
burned 11

caswall 11
called 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
lady 11
arabella 11
met 11
him 11
on 11
the 11
roadway 11
outside 11
the 11
gate 11
she 11
wished 11
to 11
take 11
the 11
servants 11
into 11
her 11
confidence 11
as 11
little 11
as 11
possible 11
she 11
turned 11
when 11
she 11
saw 11
him 11
coming 11
and 11
walked 11
beside 11
him 11
towards 11
mercy 11
farm 11
keeping 11
step 11
with 11
him 11
as 11
they 11
walked 11
when 11
they 11
got 11
near 11
mercy 11
she 11
turned 11
and 11
looked 11
around 11
her 11
expecting 11
to 11
see 11
oolanga 11
or 11
some 11
sign 11
of 11
him 11
he 11
was 11
however 11
not 11
visible 11
he 11
had 11
received 11
from 11
his 11
master 11
peremptory 11
orders 11
to 11
keep 11
out 11
of 11
sightan 11
order 11
for 11
which 11
the 11
african 11
scored 11
a 11
new 11
offence 11
up 11
against 11
her 11
they 11
found 11
lilla 11
and 11
mimi 11
at 11
home 11
and 11
seemingly 11
glad 11
to 11
see 11
them 11
though 11
both 11
the 11
girls 11
were 11
surprised 11
at 11
the 11
visit 11
coming 11
so 11
soon 11
after 11
the 11
other 11
the 11
proceedings 11
were 11
a 11
repetition 11
of 11
the 11
battle 11
of 11
souls 11
of 11
the 11
former 11
visit 11
on 11
this 11
occasion 11
however 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
had 11
only 11
the 11
presence 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
to 11

being 11
absent 11
but 11
mimi 11
lacked 11
the 11
support 11
of 11
adam 11
salton 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
of 11
such 11
effective 11
service 11
before 11
this 11
time 11
the 11
struggle 11
for 11
supremacy 11
of 11
will 11
was 11
longer 11
and 11
more 11
determined 11
caswall 11
felt 11
that 11
if 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
achieve 11
supremacy 11
he 11
had 11
better 11
give 11
up 11
the 11
idea 11
so 11
all 11
his 11
pride 11
was 11
enlisted 11
against 11
mimi 11
when 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
waiting 11
for 11
the 11
door 11

opened 11
lady 11
arabella 11
believing 11
in 11
a 11
sudden 11
attack 11
had 11
said 11
to 11
him 11
in 11
a 11
low 11
voice 11
which 11
somehow 11
carried 11
conviction 11
this 11
time 11
you 11
should 11
win 11
mimi 11

unbeaten 11
even 11
if 11
not 11
victorious 11
hush 11
they 11
are 11
coming 11
the 11
two 11
girls 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
together 11
strange 11
sounds 11
were 11
coming 11
up 11
over 11
the 11
brow 11
from 11
the 11
west 11
it 11
was 11
the 11
rustling 11
and 11
crackling 11
of 11
the 11
dry 11
reeds 11
and 11
rushes 11
from 11
the 11
low 11
lands 11
the 11
season 11
had 11
been 11
an 11
unusually 11
dry 11
one 11
also 11
the 11
strong 11
east 11
wind 11
was 11
helping 11
forward 11
enormous 11
flocks 11
of 11
birds 11
most 11
of 11
them 11
pigeons 11
with 11
white 11
cowls 11
not 11
only 11
were 11
their 11
wings 11
whirring 11
but 11
their 11
cooing 11
was 11
plainly 11
audible 11
from 11
such 11
a 11
multitude 11
of 11
birds 11
the 11
mass 11
of 11
sound 11
individually 11
small 11
assumed 11
the 11
volume 11
of 11
a 11
storm 11
surprised 11
at 11
the 11
influx 11
of 11
birds 11
to 11
which 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
strangers 11
so 11
long 11
they 11
all 11
looked 11
towards 11
castra 11
regis 11
from 11
whose 11
high 11
tower 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
had 11
been 11
flying 11
as 11
usual 11
but 11
even 11
as 11
they 11
looked 11
the 11
cord 11
broke 11
and 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
fell 11
headlong 11
in 11
a 11
series 11
of 11
sweeping 11
dives 11
its 11
own 11
weight 11
and 11
the 11
aerial 11
force 11
opposed 11
to 11
it 11
which 11
caused 11
it 11
to 11
rise 11
combined 11
with 11
the 11
strong 11
easterly 11
breeze 11
had 11
been 11
too 11
much 11
for 11
the 11
great 11
length 11
of 11
cord 11
holding 11
it 11
somehow 11
the 11
mishap 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
gave 11
new 11
hope 11
to 11
mimi 11
it 11
was 11
as 11
though 11
the 11
side 11
issues 11
had 11
been 11
shorn 11
away 11
so 11
that 11
the 11
main 11
struggle 11
was 11
thenceforth 11
on 11
simpler 11
lines 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
feeling 11
in 11
her 11
heart 11
as 11
though 11
some 11
religious 11
chord 11
had 11
been 11
newly 11
touched 11
it 11
may 11
of 11
course 11
have 11
been 11
that 11
with 11
the 11
renewal 11
of 11
the 11
bird 11
voices 11
a 11
fresh 11
courage 11
a 11
fresh 11
belief 11
in 11
the 11
good 11
issue 11
of 11
the 11
struggle 11
came 11
too 11
in 11
the 11
misery 11
of 11
silence 11
from 11
which 11
they 11
had 11
all 11
suffered 11
for 11
so 11
long 11
any 11
new 11
train 11
of 11
thought 11
was 11
almost 11
bound 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
boon 11
as 11
the 11
inrush 11
of 11
birds 11
continued 11
their 11
wings 11
beating 11
against 11
the 11
crackling 11
rushes 11
lady 11
arabella 11
grew 11
pale 11
and 11
almost 11
fainted 11
what 11
is 11
that 11
she 11
asked 11
suddenly 11
to 11
mimi 11
born 11
and 11
bred 11
in 11
siam 11
the 11
sound 11
was 11
strangely 11
like 11
an 11
exaggeration 11
of 11
the 11
sound 11
produced 11
by 11
a 11
snakecharmer 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
was 11
the 11
first 11
to 11
recover 11
from 11
the 11
interruption 11
of 11
the 11
falling 11
kite 11
after 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
quite 11
recovered 11
his 11
sang 11
froid 11
and 11
was 11
able 11
to 11
use 11
his 11
brains 11
to 11
the 11
end 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
in 11
view 11
mimi 11
too 11
quickly 11
recovered 11
herself 11
but 11
from 11
a 11
different 11
cause 11
with 11
her 11
it 11
was 11
a 11
deep 11
religious 11
conviction 11
that 11
the 11
struggle 11
round 11
her 11
was 11
of 11
the 11
powers 11
of 11
good 11
and 11
evil 11
and 11
that 11
good 11
was 11
triumphing 11
the 11
very 11
appearance 11
of 11
the 11
snowy 11
birds 11
with 11
the 11
cowls 11
of 11
saint 11
columba 11
heightened 11
the 11
impression 11
with 11
this 11
conviction 11
strong 11
upon 11
her 11
she 11
continued 11
the 11
strange 11
battle 11
with 11
fresh 11
vigour 11
she 11
seemed 11
to 11
tower 11
over 11
caswall 11
and 11
he 11
to 11
give 11
back 11
before 11
her 11
oncoming 11
once 11
again 11
her 11
vigorous 11
passes 11
drove 11
him 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
he 11
was 11
just 11
going 11
out 11
backward 11
when 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
had 11
been 11
gazing 11
at 11
him 11
with 11
fixed 11
eyes 11
caught 11
his 11
hand 11
and 11
tried 11
to 11
stop 11
his 11
movement 11
she 11
was 11
however 11
unable 11
to 11
do 11
any 11
good 11
and 11
so 11
holding 11
hands 11
they 11
passed 11
out 11
together 11
as 11
they 11
did 11
so 11
the 11
strange 11
music 11
which 11
had 11
so 11
alarmed 11
lady 11
arabella 11
suddenly 11
stopped 11
instinctively 11
they 11
all 11
looked 11
towards 11
the 11
tower 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
saw 11
that 11
the 11
workmen 11
had 11
refixed 11
the 11
kite 11
which 11
had 11
risen 11
again 11
and 11
was 11
beginning 11
to 11
float 11
out 11
to 11
its 11
former 11
station 11
as 11
they 11
were 11
looking 11
the 11
door 11
opened 11
and 11
michael 11
watford 11
came 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
by 11
that 11
time 11
all 11
had 11
recovered 11
their 11
selfpossession 11
and 11
there 11
was 11
nothing 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
common 11
to 11
attract 11
his 11
attention 11
as 11
he 11
came 11
in 11
seeing 11
inquiring 11
looks 11
all 11
around 11
him 11
he 11
said 11
the 11
new 11
influx 11
of 11
birds 11
is 11
only 11
the 11
annual 11
migration 11
of 11
pigeons 11
from 11
africa 11
i 11
am 11
told 11
that 11
it 11
will 11
soon 11
be 11
over 11
the 11
second 11
victory 11
of 11
mimi 11
watford 11
made 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
more 11
moody 11
than 11
ever 11
he 11
felt 11
thrown 11
back 11
on 11
himself 11
and 11
this 11
added 11
to 11
his 11
absorbing 11
interest 11
in 11
the 11
hope 11
of 11
a 11
victory 11
of 11
his 11
mesmeric 11
powers 11
became 11
a 11
deep 11
and 11
settled 11
purpose 11
of 11
revenge 11
the 11
chief 11
object 11
of 11
his 11
animosity 11
was 11
of 11
course 11
mimi 11
whose 11
will 11
had 11
overcome 11
his 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
obscured 11
in 11
greater 11
or 11
lesser 11
degree 11
by 11
all 11
who 11
had 11
opposed 11
him 11
lilla 11
was 11
next 11
to 11
mimi 11
in 11
his 11
hatelilla 11
the 11
harmless 11
tenderhearted 11
sweetnatured 11
girl 11
whose 11
heart 11
was 11
so 11
full 11
of 11
love 11
for 11
all 11
things 11
that 11
in 11
it 11
was 11
no 11
room 11
for 11
the 11
passions 11
of 11
ordinary 11
lifewhose 11
nature 11
resembled 11
those 11
doves 11
of 11

colour 11
she 11
wore 11

reflected 11

came 11
nextafter 11
a 11
gap 11
for 11
against 11
him 11
caswall 11
had 11
no 11
direct 11
animosity 11
he 11
regarded 11
him 11
as 11
an 11
interference 11
a 11
difficulty 11
to 11
be 11
got 11
rid 11
of 11
or 11
destroyed 11
the 11
young 11
australian 11
had 11
been 11
so 11
discreet 11
that 11
the 11
most 11
he 11
had 11
against 11
him 11
was 11
his 11
knowledge 11
of 11
what 11
had 11
been 11
caswall 11
did 11
not 11
understand 11
him 11
and 11
to 11
such 11
a 11
nature 11
as 11
his 11
ignorance 11
was 11
a 11
cause 11
of 11
alarm 11
of 11
dread 11
caswall 11
resumed 11
his 11
habit 11
of 11
watching 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
straining 11
at 11
its 11
cord 11
varying 11
his 11
vigils 11
in 11
this 11
way 11
by 11
a 11
further 11
examination 11
of 11
the 11
mysterious 11
treasures 11
of 11
his 11
house 11
especially 11
mesmers 11
chest 11
he 11
sat 11
much 11
on 11
the 11
roof 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
brooding 11
over 11
his 11
thwarted 11
passion 11
the 11
vast 11
extent 11
of 11
his 11
possessions 11
visible 11
to 11
him 11
at 11
that 11
altitude 11
might 11
one 11
would 11
have 11
thought 11
have 11
restored 11
some 11
of 11
his 11
complacency 11
but 11
the 11
very 11
extent 11
of 11
his 11
ownership 11
thus 11
perpetually 11
brought 11
before 11
him 11
created 11
a 11
fresh 11
sense 11
of 11
grievance 11
how 11
was 11
it 11
he 11
thought 11
that 11
with 11
so 11
much 11
at 11
command 11
that 11
others 11
wished 11
for 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
achieve 11
the 11
dearest 11
wishes 11
of 11
his 11
heart 11
in 11
this 11
state 11
of 11
intellectual 11
and 11
moral 11
depravity 11
he 11
found 11
a 11
solace 11
in 11
the 11
renewal 11
of 11

was 11
always 11
on 11

neither 11
did 11

with 11
anything 11
that 11
might 11
affect 11
his 11
friends 11
he 11
called 11
at 11
the 11
farm 11
and 11
heard 11
from 11
mimi 11
of 11
the 11
last 11
battle 11
of 11
wills 11
but 11
it 11
had 11
only 11
one 11
consequence 11
he 11
got 11
from 11
ross 11

more 11
mongooses 11
including 11
a 11
second 11
kingcobra 11

he 11
generally 11
carried 11
with 11
him 11

box 11

experiments 11
with 11
the 11
kite 11
went 11
on 11
successfully 11
each 11
day 11
he 11
tried 11
the 11
lifting 11
of 11
greater 11
weight 11
and 11
it 11
seemed 11
almost 11
as 11
if 11
the 11
machine 11
had 11
a 11
sentience 11
of 11
its 11
own 11
which 11
was 11
increasing 11
with 11
the 11
obstacles 11
placed 11
before 11
it 11
all 11
this 11
time 11
the 11
kite 11
hung 11
in 11
the 11
sky 11
at 11
an 11
enormous 11
height 11
the 11
wind 11
was 11
steadily 11
from 11
the 11
north 11
so 11
the 11
trend 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
to 11
the 11
south 11
all 11
day 11
long 11
runners 11
of 11
increasing 11
magnitude 11
were 11
sent 11
up 11
these 11
were 11
only 11
of 11
paper 11
or 11
thin 11
cardboard 11
or 11
leather 11
or 11
other 11
flexible 11
materials 11
the 11
great 11
height 11
at 11
which 11
the 11
kite 11
hung 11
made 11
a 11
great 11
concave 11
curve 11
in 11
the 11
string 11
so 11
that 11
as 11
the 11
runners 11
went 11
up 11
they 11
made 11
a 11
flapping 11
sound 11
if 11
one 11
laid 11
a 11
finger 11
on 11
the 11
string 11
the 11
sound 11
answered 11
to 11
the 11
flapping 11
of 11
the 11
runner 11
in 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
hollow 11
intermittent 11
murmur 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
who 11
was 11
now 11
wholly 11
obsessed 11
by 11
the 11
kite 11
and 11
all 11
belonging 11
to 11
it 11
found 11
a 11
distinct 11
resemblance 11
between 11
that 11
intermittent 11
rumble 11
and 11
the 11
snakecharming 11
music 11
produced 11
by 11
the 11
pigeons 11
flying 11
through 11
the 11
dry 11
reeds 11
one 11
day 11
he 11
made 11
a 11
discovery 11
in 11
mesmers 11
chest 11
which 11
he 11
thought 11
he 11
would 11
utilise 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
the 11
runners 11
this 11
was 11
a 11
great 11
length 11
of 11
wire 11
fine 11
as 11
human 11
hair 11
coiled 11
round 11
a 11
finely 11
made 11
wheel 11
which 11
ran 11
to 11
a 11
wondrous 11
distance 11
freely 11
and 11
as 11
lightly 11
he 11
tried 11
this 11
on 11
runners 11
and 11
found 11
it 11
work 11
admirably 11
whether 11
the 11
runner 11
was 11
alone 11
or 11
carried 11
something 11
much 11
more 11
weighty 11
than 11
itself 11
it 11
worked 11
equally 11
well 11
also 11
it 11
was 11
strong 11
enough 11
and 11
light 11
enough 11
to 11
draw 11
back 11
the 11
runner 11
without 11
undue 11
strain 11
he 11
tried 11
this 11
a 11
good 11
many 11
times 11
successfully 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
now 11
growing 11
dusk 11
and 11
he 11
found 11
some 11
difficulty 11
in 11
keeping 11
the 11
runner 11
in 11
sight 11
so 11
he 11
looked 11
for 11
something 11
heavy 11
enough 11
to 11
keep 11
it 11
still 11
he 11
placed 11
the 11
egyptian 11
image 11
of 11
bes 11
on 11
the 11
fine 11
wire 11
which 11
crossed 11
the 11
wooden 11
ledge 11
which 11
protected 11
it 11
then 11
the 11
darkness 11
growing 11
he 11
went 11
indoors 11
and 11
forgot 11
all 11
about 11
it 11
he 11
had 11
a 11
strange 11
feeling 11
of 11
uneasiness 11
that 11
nightnot 11
sleeplessness 11
for 11
he 11
seemed 11
conscious 11
of 11
being 11
asleep 11
at 11
daylight 11
he 11
rose 11
and 11
as 11
usual 11
looked 11
out 11
for 11
the 11
kite 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
see 11
it 11
in 11
its 11
usual 11
position 11
in 11
the 11
sky 11
so 11
looked 11
round 11
the 11
points 11
of 11
the 11
compass 11
he 11
was 11
more 11
than 11
astonished 11
when 11
presently 11
he 11
saw 11
the 11
missing 11
kite 11
struggling 11
as 11
usual 11
against 11
the 11
controlling 11
cord 11
but 11
it 11
had 11
gone 11
to 11
the 11
further 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
and 11
now 11
hung 11
and 11
strained 11
against 11
the 11
wind 11
to 11
the 11
north 11
he 11
thought 11
it 11
so 11
strange 11
that 11
he 11
determined 11
to 11
investigate 11
the 11
phenomenon 11
and 11
to 11
say 11
nothing 11
about 11
it 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
in 11
his 11
many 11
travels 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
had 11
been 11
accustomed 11
to 11
use 11
the 11
sextant 11
and 11
was 11
now 11
an 11
expert 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
by 11
the 11
aid 11
of 11
this 11
and 11
other 11
instruments 11
he 11
was 11
able 11
to 11
fix 11
the 11
position 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
and 11
the 11
point 11
over 11
which 11
it 11
hung 11
he 11
was 11
startled 11
to 11
find 11
that 11
exactly 11
under 11
itso 11
far 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
ascertainwas 11
dianas 11
grove 11
he 11
had 11
an 11
inclination 11
to 11
take 11
lady 11
arabella 11
into 11
his 11
confidence 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
but 11
he 11
thought 11
better 11
of 11
it 11
and 11
wisely 11
refrained 11
for 11
some 11
reason 11
which 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
try 11
to 11
explain 11
to 11
himself 11
he 11
was 11
glad 11
of 11
his 11
silence 11
when 11
on 11
the 11
following 11
morning 11
he 11
found 11
on 11
looking 11
out 11
that 11
the 11
point 11
over 11
which 11
the 11
kite 11
then 11
hovered 11
was 11
mercy 11
farm 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
verified 11
this 11
with 11
his 11
instruments 11
he 11
sat 11
before 11
the 11
window 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
looking 11
out 11
and 11
thinking 11
the 11
new 11
locality 11
was 11
more 11
to 11
his 11
liking 11
than 11
the 11
other 11
but 11
the 11
why 11
of 11
it 11
puzzled 11
him 11
all 11
the 11
same 11
he 11
spent 11
the 11
rest 11
of 11
the 11
day 11
in 11
the 11
turretroom 11
which 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
leave 11
all 11
day 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
him 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
now 11
drawn 11
by 11
forces 11
which 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
controlof 11
which 11
indeed 11
he 11
had 11
no 11
knowledgein 11
directions 11
which 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
understand 11
and 11
which 11
were 11
without 11
his 11
own 11
volition 11
in 11
sheer 11
helpless 11
inability 11
to 11
think 11
the 11
problem 11
out 11
satisfactorily 11
he 11
called 11
up 11
a 11
servant 11
and 11
told 11
him 11
to 11
tell 11
oolanga 11
that 11
he 11
wanted 11
to 11
see 11
him 11
at 11
once 11
in 11
the 11
turret 11
room 11
the 11
answer 11
came 11
back 11
that 11
the 11
african 11
had 11
not 11
been 11
seen 11
since 11
the 11
previous 11
evening 11
caswall 11
was 11
now 11
so 11
irritable 11
that 11
even 11
this 11
small 11
thing 11
upset 11
him 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
distrait 11
and 11
wanted 11
to 11
talk 11
to 11
somebody 11
he 11
sent 11
for 11
simon 11
chester 11
who 11
came 11
at 11
once 11
breathless 11
with 11
hurrying 11
and 11
upset 11
by 11
the 11
unexpected 11
summons 11
caswall 11
bade 11
him 11
sit 11
down 11
and 11
when 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
less 11
uneasy 11
frame 11
of 11
mind 11
he 11
again 11
asked 11
him 11
if 11
he 11
had 11
ever 11
seen 11
what 11
was 11
in 11
mesmers 11
chest 11
or 11
heard 11
it 11
spoken 11
about 11
chester 11
admitted 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
once 11
in 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
the 11
then 11
mr 11
edgar 11
seen 11
the 11
chest 11
open 11
which 11
knowing 11
something 11
of 11
its 11
history 11
and 11
guessing 11
more 11
so 11
upset 11
him 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
fainted 11
when 11
he 11
recovered 11
the 11
chest 11
was 11
closed 11
from 11
that 11
time 11
the 11
then 11
mr 11
edgar 11
had 11
never 11
spoken 11
about 11
it 11
again 11
when 11
caswall 11
asked 11
him 11
to 11
describe 11
what 11
he 11
had 11
seen 11
when 11
the 11
chest 11
was 11
open 11
he 11
got 11
very 11
agitated 11
and 11
despite 11
all 11
his 11
efforts 11
to 11
remain 11
calm 11
he 11
suddenly 11
went 11
off 11
into 11
a 11
faint 11
caswall 11
summoned 11
servants 11
who 11
applied 11
the 11
usual 11
remedies 11
still 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
did 11
not 11
recover 11
after 11
the 11
lapse 11
of 11
a 11
considerable 11
time 11
the 11
doctor 11
who 11
had 11
been 11
summoned 11
made 11
his 11
appearance 11
a 11
glance 11
was 11
sufficient 11
for 11
him 11
to 11
make 11
up 11
his 11
mind 11
still 11
he 11
knelt 11
down 11
by 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
and 11
made 11
a 11
careful 11
examination 11
then 11
he 11
rose 11
to 11
his 11
feet 11
and 11
in 11
a 11
hushed 11
voice 11
said 11
i 11
grieve 11
to 11
say 11
sir 11
that 11
he 11
has 11
passed 11
away 11
chapter 11
xvon 11
the 11
track 11
those 11
who 11
had 11
seen 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
familiarly 11
since 11
his 11
arrival 11
and 11
had 11
already 11
estimated 11
his 11
coldblooded 11
nature 11
at 11
something 11
of 11
its 11
true 11
value 11
were 11
surprised 11
that 11
he 11
took 11
so 11
to 11
heart 11
the 11
death 11
of 11
old 11
chester 11
the 11
fact 11
was 11
that 11
not 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
had 11
guessed 11
correctly 11
at 11
his 11
character 11
they 11
thought 11
naturally 11
enough 11
that 11
the 11
concern 11
which 11
he 11
felt 11
was 11
that 11
of 11
a 11
master 11
for 11
a 11
faithful 11
old 11
servant 11
of 11
his 11
family 11
they 11
little 11
thought 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
merely 11
the 11
selfish 11
expression 11
of 11
his 11
disappointment 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
thus 11
lost 11
the 11
only 11
remaining 11
clue 11
to 11
an 11
interesting 11
piece 11
of 11
family 11
historyone 11
which 11
was 11
now 11
and 11
would 11
be 11
for 11
ever 11
wrapped 11
in 11
mystery 11
caswall 11
knew 11
enough 11
about 11
the 11
life 11
of 11
his 11
ancestor 11
in 11
paris 11
to 11
wish 11
to 11
know 11
more 11
fully 11
and 11
more 11
thoroughly 11
all 11
that 11
had 11
been 11
the 11
period 11
covered 11
by 11
that 11
ancestors 11
life 11
in 11
paris 11
was 11
one 11
inviting 11
every 11
form 11
of 11
curiosity 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
had 11
her 11
own 11
game 11
to 11
play 11
saw 11
in 11
the 11
metier 11
of 11
sympathetic 11
friend 11
a 11
series 11
of 11
meetings 11
with 11
the 11
man 11
she 11
wanted 11
to 11
secure 11
she 11
made 11
the 11
first 11
use 11
of 11
the 11
opportunity 11
the 11
day 11
after 11
old 11
chesters 11
death 11
indeed 11
as 11
soon 11
as 11
the 11
news 11
had 11
filtered 11
in 11
through 11
the 11
back 11
door 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
at 11
that 11
meeting 11
she 11
played 11
her 11
part 11
so 11
well 11
that 11
even 11
caswalls 11
cold 11
nature 11
was 11
impressed 11
oolanga 11
was 11
the 11
only 11
one 11
who 11
did 11
not 11
credit 11
her 11
with 11
at 11
least 11
some 11
sense 11
of 11
fine 11
feeling 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
in 11
emotional 11
as 11
in 11
other 11
matters 11
oolanga 11
was 11
distinctly 11
a 11
utilitarian 11
and 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
understand 11
anyone 11
feeling 11
grief 11
except 11
for 11
his 11
own 11
suffering 11
pain 11
or 11
for 11
the 11
loss 11
of 11
money 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
understand 11
anyone 11
simulating 11
such 11
an 11
emotion 11
except 11
for 11
show 11
intended 11
to 11
deceive 11
he 11
thought 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
castra 11
regis 11
again 11
for 11
the 11
opportunity 11
of 11
stealing 11
something 11
and 11
was 11
determined 11
that 11
on 11
this 11
occasion 11
the 11
chance 11
of 11
pressing 11
his 11
advantage 11
over 11
her 11
should 11
not 11
pass 11
he 11
felt 11
therefore 11
that 11
the 11
occasion 11
was 11
one 11
for 11
extra 11
carefulness 11
in 11
the 11
watching 11
of 11
all 11
that 11
went 11
on 11
ever 11
since 11
he 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
trying 11
to 11
steal 11
the 11
treasure 11
chest 11
he 11
suspected 11
nearly 11
everyone 11
of 11
the 11
same 11
design 11
and 11
made 11
it 11
a 11
point 11
to 11
watch 11
all 11
suspicious 11
persons 11
and 11
places 11
as 11
adam 11
was 11
engaged 11
on 11
his 11
own 11
researches 11
regarding 11
lady 11
arabella 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
natural 11
that 11
there 11
should 11
be 11
some 11
crossing 11
of 11
each 11
others 11
tracks 11
this 11
is 11
what 11
did 11
actually 11
happen 11
adam 11
had 11
gone 11
for 11
an 11
early 11
morning 11
survey 11
of 11
the 11
place 11
in 11
which 11
he 11
was 11
interested 11
taking 11
with 11
him 11
the 11
mongoose 11
in 11
its 11
box 11
he 11
arrived 11
at 11
the 11
gate 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
just 11
as 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
preparing 11
to 11
set 11
out 11
for 11
castra 11
regis 11
on 11
what 11
she 11
considered 11
her 11
mission 11
of 11
comfort 11
seeing 11
adam 11
from 11
her 11
window 11
going 11
through 11
the 11
shadows 11
of 11
the 11
trees 11
round 11
the 11
gate 11
she 11
thought 11
that 11
he 11
must 11
be 11
engaged 11
on 11
some 11
purpose 11
similar 11
to 11
her 11
own 11
so 11
quickly 11
making 11
her 11
toilet 11
she 11
quietly 11
left 11
the 11
house 11
and 11
taking 11
advantage 11
of 11
every 11
shadow 11
and 11
substance 11
which 11
could 11
hide 11
her 11
followed 11
him 11
on 11
his 11
walk 11
oolanga 11
the 11
experienced 11
tracker 11
followed 11
her 11
but 11
succeeded 11
in 11
hiding 11
his 11
movements 11
better 11
than 11
she 11
did 11
he 11
saw 11
that 11
adam 11
had 11
on 11
his 11
shoulder 11
a 11
mysterious 11
box 11
which 11
he 11
took 11
to 11
contain 11
something 11
valuable 11
seeing 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
secretly 11
following 11
adam 11
he 11
was 11
confirmed 11
in 11
this 11
idea 11
his 11
mindsuch 11
as 11
it 11
waswas 11
fixed 11
on 11
her 11
trying 11
to 11
steal 11
and 11
he 11
credited 11
her 11
at 11
once 11
with 11
making 11
use 11
of 11
this 11
new 11
opportunity 11
in 11
his 11
walk 11
adam 11
went 11
into 11
the 11
grounds 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
oolanga 11
saw 11
her 11
follow 11
him 11
with 11
great 11
secrecy 11
he 11
feared 11
to 11
go 11
closer 11
as 11
now 11
on 11
both 11
sides 11
of 11
him 11
were 11
enemies 11
who 11
might 11
make 11
discovery 11
when 11
he 11
realised 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
bound 11
for 11
the 11
castle 11
he 11
devoted 11
himself 11
to 11
following 11
her 11
with 11
singleness 11
of 11
purpose 11
he 11
therefore 11
missed 11
seeing 11
that 11
adam 11
branched 11
off 11
the 11
track 11
and 11
returned 11
to 11
the 11
high 11
road 11
that 11
night 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
had 11
slept 11
badly 11
the 11
tragic 11
occurrence 11
of 11
the 11
day 11
was 11
on 11
his 11
mind 11
and 11
he 11
kept 11
waking 11
and 11
thinking 11
of 11
it 11
after 11
an 11
early 11
breakfast 11
he 11
sat 11
at 11
the 11
open 11
window 11
watching 11
the 11
kite 11
and 11
thinking 11
of 11
many 11
things 11
from 11
his 11
room 11
he 11
could 11
see 11
all 11
round 11
the 11
neighbourhood 11
but 11
the 11
two 11
places 11
that 11
interested 11
him 11
most 11
were 11
mercy 11
farm 11
and 11
dianas 11
grove 11
at 11
first 11
the 11
movements 11
about 11
those 11
spots 11
were 11
of 11
a 11
humble 11
kindthose 11
that 11
belong 11
to 11
domestic 11
service 11
or 11
agricultural 11
needsthe 11
opening 11
of 11
doors 11
and 11
windows 11
the 11
sweeping 11
and 11
brushing 11
and 11
generally 11
the 11
restoration 11
of 11
habitual 11
order 11
from 11
his 11
high 11
windowwhose 11
height 11
made 11
it 11
a 11
screen 11
from 11
the 11
observation 11
of 11
othershe 11
saw 11
the 11
chain 11
of 11
watchers 11
move 11
into 11
his 11
own 11
grounds 11
and 11
then 11
presently 11
break 11
upadam 11
salton 11
going 11
one 11
way 11
and 11
lady 11
arabella 11
followed 11
by 11
the 11
nigger 11
another 11
then 11
oolanga 11
disappeared 11
amongst 11
the 11
trees 11
but 11
caswall 11
could 11
see 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
still 11
watching 11
lady 11
arabella 11
after 11
looking 11
around 11
her 11
slipped 11
in 11
by 11
the 11
open 11
door 11
and 11
he 11
could 11
of 11
course 11
see 11
her 11
no 11
longer 11
presently 11
however 11
he 11
heard 11
a 11
light 11
tap 11
at 11
his 11
door 11
then 11
the 11
door 11
opened 11
slowly 11
and 11
he 11
could 11
see 11
the 11
flash 11
of 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
white 11
dress 11
through 11
the 11
opening 11
chapter 11
xvia 11
visit 11
of 11
sympathy 11
caswall 11
was 11
genuinely 11
surprised 11
when 11
he 11
saw 11
lady 11
arabella 11
though 11
he 11
need 11
not 11
have 11
been 11
after 11
what 11
had 11
already 11
occurred 11
in 11
the 11
same 11
way 11
the 11
look 11
of 11
surprise 11
on 11
his 11
face 11
was 11
so 11
much 11
greater 11
than 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
expectedthough 11
she 11
thought 11
she 11
was 11
prepared 11
to 11
meet 11
anything 11
that 11
might 11
occurthat 11
she 11
stood 11
still 11
in 11
sheer 11
amazement 11
coldblooded 11
as 11
she 11
was 11
and 11
ready 11
for 11
all 11
social 11
emergencies 11
she 11
was 11
nonplussed 11
how 11
to 11
go 11
on 11
she 11
was 11
plucky 11
however 11
and 11
began 11
to 11
speak 11
at 11
once 11
although 11
she 11
had 11
not 11
the 11
slightest 11
idea 11
what 11
she 11
was 11
going 11
to 11
say 11
i 11
came 11
to 11
offer 11
you 11
my 11
very 11
warm 11
sympathy 11
with 11
the 11
grief 11
you 11
have 11
so 11
lately 11
experienced 11
my 11
grief 11
im 11
afraid 11
i 11
must 11
be 11
very 11
dull 11
but 11
i 11
really 11
do 11
not 11
understand 11
already 11
she 11
felt 11
at 11
a 11
disadvantage 11
and 11
hesitated 11
i 11
mean 11
about 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
who 11
died 11
so 11
suddenlyyour 11
old 11
retainer 11
caswalls 11
face 11
relaxed 11
something 11
of 11
its 11
puzzled 11
concentration 11
oh 11
he 11
was 11
only 11
a 11
servant 11
and 11
he 11
had 11
overstayed 11
his 11
threescore 11
and 11
ten 11
years 11
by 11
something 11
like 11
twenty 11
years 11
he 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
ninety 11
still 11
as 11
an 11
old 11
servant 11
caswalls 11
words 11
were 11
not 11
so 11
cold 11
as 11
their 11
inflection 11
i 11
never 11
interfere 11
with 11
servants 11
he 11
was 11
kept 11
on 11
here 11
merely 11
because 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
so 11
long 11
on 11
the 11
premises 11
i 11
suppose 11
the 11
steward 11
thought 11
it 11
might 11
make 11
him 11
unpopular 11
if 11
the 11
old 11
fellow 11
had 11
been 11
dismissed 11
how 11
on 11
earth 11
was 11
she 11
to 11
proceed 11
on 11
such 11
a 11
task 11
as 11
hers 11
if 11
this 11
was 11
the 11
utmost 11
geniality 11
she 11
could 11
expect 11
so 11
she 11
at 11
once 11
tried 11
another 11
tackthis 11
time 11
a 11
personal 11
one 11
i 11
am 11
sorry 11
i 11
disturbed 11
you 11
i 11
am 11
really 11
not 11
unconventionalthough 11
certainly 11
no 11
slave 11
to 11
convention 11
still 11
there 11
are 11
limits 11
it 11
is 11
bad 11
enough 11
to 11
intrude 11
in 11
this 11
way 11
and 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
know 11
what 11
you 11
can 11
say 11
or 11
think 11
of 11
the 11
time 11
selected 11
for 11
the 11
intrusion 11
after 11
all 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
was 11
a 11
gentleman 11
by 11
custom 11
and 11
habit 11
so 11
he 11
rose 11
to 11
the 11
occasion 11
i 11
can 11
only 11
say 11
lady 11
arabella 11
that 11
you 11
are 11
always 11
welcome 11
at 11
any 11
time 11
you 11
may 11
deign 11
to 11
honour 11
my 11
house 11
with 11
your 11
presence 11
she 11
smiled 11
at 11
him 11
sweetly 11
thank 11
you 11
so 11
much 11
you 11
do 11
put 11
one 11
at 11
ease 11
my 11
breach 11
of 11
convention 11
makes 11
me 11
glad 11
rather 11
than 11
sorry 11
i 11
feel 11
that 11
i 11
can 11
open 11
my 11
heart 11
to 11
you 11
about 11
anything 11
forthwith 11
she 11
proceeded 11
to 11
tell 11
him 11
about 11
oolanga 11
and 11
his 11
strange 11
suspicions 11
of 11
her 11
honesty 11
caswall 11
laughed 11
and 11
made 11
her 11
explain 11
all 11
the 11
details 11
his 11
final 11
comment 11
was 11
enlightening 11
let 11
me 11
give 11
you 11
a 11
word 11
of 11
advice 11
if 11
you 11
have 11
the 11
slightest 11
fault 11
to 11
find 11
with 11
that 11
infernal 11
nigger 11
shoot 11
him 11
at 11
sight 11
a 11
swelled 11
headed 11
nigger 11
with 11
a 11
bee 11
in 11
his 11
bonnet 11
is 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
worst 11
difficulties 11
in 11
the 11
world 11
to 11
deal 11
with 11
so 11
better 11
make 11
a 11
clean 11
job 11
of 11
it 11
and 11
wipe 11
him 11
out 11
at 11
once 11
but 11
what 11
about 11
the 11
law 11
mr 11
caswall 11
oh 11
the 11
law 11
doesnt 11
concern 11
itself 11
much 11
about 11
dead 11
niggers 11
a 11
few 11
more 11
or 11
less 11
do 11
not 11
matter 11
to 11
my 11
mind 11
its 11
rather 11
a 11
relief 11
im 11
afraid 11
of 11
you 11
was 11
her 11
only 11
comment 11
made 11
with 11
a 11
sweet 11
smile 11
and 11
in 11
a 11
soft 11
voice 11
all 11
right 11
he 11
said 11
let 11
us 11
leave 11
it 11
at 11
that 11
anyhow 11
we 11
shall 11
be 11
rid 11
of 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
i 11
dont 11
love 11
niggers 11
any 11
more 11
than 11
you 11
do 11
she 11
replied 11
and 11
i 11
suppose 11
one 11
mustnt 11
be 11
too 11
particular 11
where 11
that 11
sort 11
of 11
cleaning 11
up 11
is 11
concerned 11
then 11
she 11
changed 11
in 11
voice 11
and 11
manner 11
and 11
asked 11
genially 11
and 11
now 11
tell 11
me 11
am 11
i 11
forgiven 11
you 11
are 11
dear 11
ladyif 11
there 11
is 11
anything 11
to 11
forgive 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
seeing 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
moved 11
to 11
go 11
he 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
with 11
her 11
and 11
in 11
the 11
most 11
natural 11
way 11
accompanied 11
her 11
downstairs 11
he 11
passed 11
through 11
the 11
hall 11
with 11
her 11
and 11
down 11
the 11
avenue 11
as 11
he 11
went 11
back 11
to 11
the 11
house 11
she 11
smiled 11
to 11
herself 11
well 11
that 11
is 11
all 11
right 11
i 11
dont 11
think 11
the 11
morning 11
has 11
been 11
altogether 11
thrown 11
away 11
and 11
she 11
walked 11
slowly 11
back 11
to 11
dianas 11
grove 11
adam 11
salton 11
followed 11
the 11
line 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
and 11
refreshed 11
his 11
memory 11
as 11
to 11
the 11
various 11
localities 11
he 11
got 11
home 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
just 11
as 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
beginning 11
lunch 11
mr 11
salton 11
had 11
gone 11
to 11
walsall 11
to 11
keep 11
an 11
early 11
appointment 11
so 11
he 11
was 11
all 11
alone 11
when 11
the 11
meal 11
was 11
overseeing 11
in 11
adams 11
face 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
something 11
to 11
speak 11
abouthe 11
followed 11
into 11
the 11
study 11
and 11
shut 11
the 11
door 11
when 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
had 11
lighted 11
their 11
pipes 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
began 11
i 11
have 11
remembered 11
an 11
interesting 11
fact 11
about 11
dianas 11
grovethere 11
is 11
i 11
have 11
long 11
understood 11
some 11
strange 11
mystery 11
about 11
that 11
house 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
of 11
some 11
interest 11
or 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
trivial 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
tangled 11
skein 11
as 11
we 11
are 11
trying 11
to 11
unravel 11
please 11
tell 11
me 11
all 11
you 11
know 11
or 11
suspect 11
to 11
begin 11
then 11
of 11
what 11
sort 11
is 11
the 11
mysteryphysical 11
mental 11
moral 11
historical 11
scientific 11
occult 11
any 11
kind 11
of 11
hint 11
will 11
help 11
me 11
quite 11
right 11
i 11
shall 11
try 11
to 11
tell 11
you 11
what 11
i 11
think 11
but 11
i 11
have 11
not 11
put 11
my 11
thoughts 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
in 11
sequence 11
so 11
you 11
must 11
forgive 11
me 11
if 11
due 11
order 11
is 11
not 11
observed 11
in 11
my 11
narration 11
i 11
suppose 11
you 11
have 11
seen 11
the 11
house 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
the 11
outside 11
of 11
it 11
but 11
i 11
have 11
that 11
in 11
my 11
minds 11
eye 11
and 11
i 11
can 11
fit 11
into 11
my 11
memory 11
whatever 11
you 11
may 11
mention 11
the 11
house 11
is 11
very 11
oldprobably 11
the 11
first 11
house 11
of 11
some 11
sort 11
that 11
stood 11
there 11
was 11
in 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
the 11
romans 11
this 11
was 11
probably 11
renewedperhaps 11
several 11
times 11
at 11
later 11
periods 11
the 11
house 11
stands 11
or 11
rather 11
used 11
to 11
stand 11
here 11
when 11
mercia 11
was 11
a 11
kingdomi 11
do 11
not 11
suppose 11
that 11
the 11
basement 11
can 11
be 11
later 11
than 11
the 11
norman 11
conquest 11
some 11
years 11
ago 11
when 11
i 11
was 11
president 11
of 11
the 11
mercian 11
archaeological 11
society 11
i 11
went 11
all 11
over 11
it 11
very 11
carefully 11
this 11
was 11
when 11
it 11
was 11
purchased 11
by 11
captain 11
march 11
the 11
house 11
had 11
then 11
been 11
done 11
up 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
be 11
suitable 11
for 11
the 11
bride 11
the 11
basement 11
is 11
very 11
strongalmost 11
as 11
strong 11
and 11
as 11
heavy 11
as 11
if 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
intended 11
as 11
a 11
fortress 11
there 11
are 11
a 11
whole 11
series 11
of 11
rooms 11
deep 11
underground 11
one 11
of 11
them 11
in 11
particular 11
struck 11
me 11
the 11
room 11
itself 11
is 11
of 11
considerable 11
size 11
but 11
the 11
masonry 11
is 11
more 11
than 11
massive 11
in 11
the 11
middle 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
is 11
a 11
sunk 11
well 11
built 11
up 11
to 11
floor 11
level 11
and 11
evidently 11
going 11
deep 11
underground 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
windlass 11
nor 11
any 11
trace 11
of 11
there 11
ever 11
having 11
been 11
anyno 11
ropenothing 11
now 11
we 11
know 11
that 11
the 11
romans 11
had 11
wells 11
of 11
immense 11
depth 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
water 11
was 11
lifted 11
by 11
the 11
old 11
rag 11
rope 11
that 11
at 11
woodhull 11
used 11
to 11
be 11
nearly 11
a 11
thousand 11
feet 11
here 11
then 11
we 11
have 11
simply 11
an 11
enormously 11
deep 11
wellhole 11
the 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
was 11
massive 11
and 11
was 11
fastened 11
with 11
a 11
lock 11
nearly 11
a 11
foot 11
square 11
it 11
was 11
evidently 11
intended 11
for 11
some 11
kind 11
of 11
protection 11
to 11
someone 11
or 11
something 11
but 11
no 11
one 11
in 11
those 11
days 11
had 11
ever 11
heard 11
of 11
anyone 11
having 11
been 11
allowed 11
even 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
room 11
all 11
this 11
is 11
e 11
propos 11
of 11
a 11
suggestion 11
on 11
my 11
part 11
that 11
the 11
wellhole 11
was 11
a 11
way 11
by 11
which 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
whatever 11
it 11
was 11
went 11
and 11
came 11
at 11
that 11
time 11
i 11
would 11
have 11
had 11
a 11
search 11
madeeven 11
excavation 11
if 11
necessaryat 11
my 11
own 11
expense 11
but 11
all 11
suggestions 11
were 11
met 11
with 11
a 11
prompt 11
and 11
explicit 11
negative 11
so 11
of 11
course 11
i 11
took 11
no 11
further 11
step 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
then 11
it 11
died 11
out 11
of 11
recollectioneven 11
of 11
mine 11
do 11
you 11
remember 11
sir 11
asked 11
adam 11
what 11
was 11
the 11
appearance 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
where 11
the 11
wellhole 11
was 11
was 11
there 11
furniturein 11
fact 11
any 11
sort 11
of 11
thing 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
the 11
only 11
thing 11
i 11
remember 11
was 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
green 11
lightvery 11
clouded 11
very 11
dimwhich 11
came 11
up 11
from 11
the 11
well 11
not 11
a 11
fixed 11
light 11
but 11
intermittent 11
and 11
irregularquite 11
unlike 11
anything 11
i 11
had 11
ever 11
seen 11
do 11
you 11
remember 11
how 11
you 11
got 11
into 11
the 11
wellroom 11
was 11
there 11
a 11
separate 11
door 11
from 11
outside 11
or 11
was 11
there 11
any 11
interior 11
room 11
or 11
passage 11
which 11
opened 11
into 11
it 11
i 11
think 11
there 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
some 11
room 11
with 11
a 11
way 11
into 11
it 11
i 11
remember 11
going 11
up 11
some 11
steep 11
steps 11
they 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
worn 11
smooth 11
by 11
long 11
use 11
or 11
something 11
of 11
the 11
kind 11
for 11
i 11
could 11
hardly 11
keep 11
my 11
feet 11
as 11
i 11
went 11
up 11
once 11
i 11
stumbled 11
and 11
nearly 11
fell 11
into 11
the 11
well 11
hole 11
was 11
there 11
anything 11
strange 11
about 11
the 11
placeany 11
queer 11
smell 11
for 11
instance 11
queer 11
smellyes 11
like 11
bilge 11
or 11
a 11
rank 11
swamp 11
it 11
was 11
distinctly 11
nauseating 11
when 11
i 11
came 11
out 11
i 11
felt 11
as 11
if 11
i 11
had 11
just 11
been 11
going 11
to 11
be 11
sick 11
i 11
shall 11
try 11
back 11
on 11
my 11
visit 11
and 11
see 11
if 11
i 11
can 11
recall 11
any 11
more 11
of 11
what 11
i 11
saw 11
or 11
felt 11
then 11
perhaps 11
sir 11
later 11
in 11
the 11
day 11
you 11
will 11
tell 11
me 11
anything 11
you 11
may 11
chance 11
to 11
recollect 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
delighted 11
adam 11
if 11
your 11
uncle 11
has 11
not 11
returned 11
by 11
then 11
ill 11
join 11
you 11
in 11
the 11
study 11
after 11
dinner 11
and 11
we 11
can 11
resume 11
this 11
interesting 11
chat 11
chapter 11
xviithe 11
mystery 11
of 11
the 11
grove 11
that 11
afternoon 11
adam 11
decided 11
to 11
do 11
a 11
little 11
exploring 11
as 11
he 11
passed 11
through 11
the 11
wood 11
outside 11
the 11
gate 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
he 11
thought 11
he 11
saw 11
the 11
africans 11
face 11
for 11
an 11
instant 11
so 11
he 11
went 11
deeper 11
into 11
the 11
undergrowth 11
and 11
followed 11
along 11
parallel 11
to 11
the 11
avenue 11
to 11
the 11
house 11
he 11
was 11
glad 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
workman 11
or 11
servant 11
about 11
for 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
care 11
that 11
any 11
of 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
people 11
should 11
find 11
him 11
wandering 11
about 11
her 11
grounds 11
taking 11
advantage 11
of 11
the 11
denseness 11
of 11
the 11
trees 11
he 11
came 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
house 11
and 11
skirted 11
round 11
it 11
he 11
was 11
repaid 11
for 11
his 11
trouble 11
for 11
on 11
the 11
far 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
close 11
to 11
where 11
the 11
rocky 11
frontage 11
of 11
the 11
cliff 11
fell 11
away 11
he 11
saw 11
oolanga 11
crouched 11
behind 11
the 11
irregular 11
trunk 11
of 11
a 11
great 11
oak 11
the 11
man 11
was 11
so 11
intent 11
on 11
watching 11
someone 11
or 11
something 11
that 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
guard 11
against 11
being 11
himself 11
watched 11
this 11
suited 11
adam 11
for 11
he 11
could 11
thus 11
make 11
scrutiny 11
at 11
will 11
the 11
thick 11
wood 11
though 11
the 11
trees 11
were 11
mostly 11
of 11
small 11
girth 11
threw 11
a 11
heavy 11
shadow 11
so 11
that 11
the 11
steep 11
declension 11
in 11
front 11
of 11
which 11
grew 11
the 11
tree 11
behind 11
which 11
the 11
african 11
lurked 11
was 11
almost 11
in 11
darkness 11
adam 11
drew 11
as 11
close 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
and 11
was 11
amazed 11
to 11
see 11
a 11
patch 11
of 11
light 11
on 11
the 11
ground 11
before 11
him 11
when 11
he 11
realised 11
what 11
it 11
was 11
he 11
was 11
determined 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
to 11
follow 11
on 11
his 11
quest 11
the 11
nigger 11
had 11
a 11
dark 11
lantern 11
in 11
his 11
hand 11
and 11
was 11
throwing 11
the 11
light 11
down 11
the 11
steep 11
incline 11
the 11
glare 11
showed 11
a 11
series 11
of 11
stone 11
steps 11
which 11
ended 11
in 11
a 11
lowlying 11
heavy 11
iron 11
door 11
fixed 11
against 11
the 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
all 11
the 11
strange 11
things 11
he 11
had 11
heard 11
from 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
all 11
those 11
little 11
and 11
big 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
himself 11
noticed 11
crowded 11
into 11
his 11
mind 11
in 11
a 11
chaotic 11
way 11
instinctively 11
he 11
took 11
refuge 11
behind 11
a 11
thick 11
oak 11
stem 11
and 11
set 11
himself 11
down 11
to 11
watch 11
what 11
might 11
occur 11
after 11
a 11
short 11
time 11
it 11
became 11
apparent 11
that 11
the 11
african 11
was 11
trying 11
to 11
find 11
out 11
what 11
was 11
behind 11
the 11
heavy 11
door 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
way 11
of 11
looking 11
in 11
for 11
the 11
door 11
fitted 11
tight 11
into 11
the 11
massive 11
stone 11
slabs 11
the 11
only 11
opportunity 11
for 11
the 11
entrance 11
of 11
light 11
was 11
through 11
a 11
small 11
hole 11
between 11
the 11
great 11
stones 11
above 11
the 11
door 11
this 11
hole 11
was 11
too 11
high 11
up 11
to 11
look 11
through 11
from 11
the 11
ground 11
level 11
oolanga 11
having 11
tried 11
standing 11
tiptoe 11
on 11
the 11
highest 11
point 11
near 11
and 11
holding 11
the 11
lantern 11
as 11
high 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
threw 11
the 11
light 11
round 11
the 11
edges 11
of 11
the 11
door 11
to 11
see 11
if 11
he 11
could 11
find 11
anywhere 11
a 11
hole 11
or 11
a 11
flaw 11
in 11
the 11
metal 11
through 11
which 11
he 11
could 11
obtain 11
a 11
glimpse 11
foiled 11
in 11
this 11
he 11
brought 11
from 11
the 11
shrubbery 11
a 11
plank 11
which 11
he 11
leant 11
against 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
door 11
and 11
then 11
climbed 11
up 11
with 11
great 11
dexterity 11
this 11
did 11
not 11
bring 11
him 11
near 11
enough 11
to 11
the 11
windowhole 11
to 11
look 11
in 11
or 11
even 11
to 11
throw 11
the 11
light 11
of 11
the 11
lantern 11
through 11
it 11
so 11
he 11
climbed 11
down 11
and 11
carried 11
the 11
plank 11
back 11
to 11
the 11
place 11
from 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
got 11
it 11
then 11
he 11
concealed 11
himself 11
near 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
and 11
waited 11
manifestly 11
with 11
the 11
intent 11
of 11
remaining 11
there 11
till 11
someone 11
came 11
near 11
presently 11
lady 11
arabella 11
moving 11
noiselessly 11
through 11
the 11
shade 11
approached 11
the 11
door 11
when 11
he 11
saw 11
her 11
close 11
enough 11
to 11
touch 11
it 11
oolanga 11
stepped 11
forward 11
from 11
his 11
concealment 11
and 11
spoke 11
in 11
a 11
whisper 11
which 11
through 11
the 11
gloom 11
sounded 11
like 11
a 11
hiss 11
i 11
want 11
to 11
see 11
you 11
missysoon 11
and 11
secret 11
what 11
do 11
you 11
want 11
you 11
know 11
well 11
missy 11
i 11
told 11
you 11
already 11
she 11
turned 11
on 11
him 11
with 11
blazing 11
eyes 11
the 11
green 11
tint 11
in 11
them 11
glowing 11
like 11
emeralds 11
come 11
none 11
of 11
that 11
if 11
there 11
is 11
anything 11
sensible 11
which 11
you 11
wish 11
to 11
say 11
to 11
me 11
you 11
can 11
see 11
me 11
here 11
just 11
where 11
we 11
are 11
at 11
seven 11
oclock 11
he 11
made 11
no 11
reply 11
in 11
words 11
but 11
putting 11
the 11
backs 11
of 11
his 11
hands 11
together 11
bent 11
lower 11
and 11
lower 11
till 11
his 11
forehead 11
touched 11
the 11
earth 11
then 11
he 11
rose 11
and 11
went 11
slowly 11
away 11
adam 11
salton 11
from 11
his 11
hidingplace 11
saw 11
and 11
wondered 11
in 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
he 11
moved 11
from 11
his 11
place 11
and 11
went 11
home 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
fully 11
determined 11
that 11
seven 11
oclock 11
would 11
find 11
him 11
in 11
some 11
hidden 11
place 11
behind 11
dianas 11
grove 11
at 11
a 11
little 11
before 11
seven 11
adam 11
stole 11
softly 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
and 11
took 11
the 11
backway 11
to 11
the 11
rear 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
the 11
place 11
seemed 11
silent 11
and 11
deserted 11
so 11
he 11
took 11
the 11
opportunity 11
of 11
concealing 11
himself 11
near 11
the 11
spot 11
whence 11
he 11
had 11
seen 11
oolanga 11
trying 11
to 11
investigate 11
whatever 11
was 11
concealed 11
behind 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
he 11
waited 11
perfectly 11
still 11
and 11
at 11
last 11
saw 11
a 11
gleam 11
of 11
white 11
passing 11
soundlessly 11
through 11
the 11
undergrowth 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
surprised 11
when 11
he 11
recognised 11
the 11
colour 11
of 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
dress 11
she 11
came 11
close 11
and 11
waited 11
with 11
her 11
face 11
to 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
from 11
some 11
place 11
of 11
concealment 11
near 11
at 11
hand 11
oolanga 11
appeared 11
and 11
came 11
close 11
to 11
her 11
adam 11
noticed 11
with 11
surprised 11
amusement 11
that 11
over 11
his 11
shoulder 11
was 11
the 11
box 11
with 11
the 11
mongoose 11
of 11
course 11
the 11
african 11
did 11
not 11
know 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
seen 11
by 11
anyone 11
least 11
of 11
all 11
by 11
the 11
man 11
whose 11
property 11
he 11
had 11
with 11
him 11
silentfooted 11
as 11
he 11
was 11
lady 11
arabella 11
heard 11
him 11
coming 11
and 11
turned 11
to 11
meet 11
him 11
it 11
was 11
somewhat 11
hard 11
to 11
see 11
in 11
the 11
gloom 11
for 11
as 11
usual 11
he 11
was 11
all 11
in 11
black 11
only 11
his 11
collar 11
and 11
cuffs 11
showing 11
white 11
lady 11
arabella 11
opened 11
the 11
conversation 11
which 11
ensued 11
between 11
the 11
two 11
what 11
do 11
you 11
want 11
to 11
rob 11
me 11
or 11

frightened 11
her 11
a 11
little 11
and 11
she 11
tried 11
to 11
change 11
the 11
tone 11
is 11
that 11
a 11
coffin 11

with 11

are 11
wasting 11
your 11
time 11

not 11
hold 11
me 11
when 11
a 11
nigger 11
suspects 11
he 11
is 11
being 11
laughed 11
at 11
all 11
the 11
ferocity 11
of 11
his 11
nature 11
comes 11
to 11
the 11
front 11
and 11
this 11
man 11
was 11
of 11
the 11
lowest 11
kind 11
dis 11
aint 11

him 11
to 11
you 11
still 11
anxious 11
to 11
keep 11
off 11
the 11
subject 11
of 11
affection 11
on 11
which 11
she 11
believed 11
him 11
to 11
have 11
become 11
crazed 11
she 11
made 11
another 11
effort 11
to 11
keep 11
his 11
mind 11
elsewhere 11
is 11
this 11
why 11
you 11
want 11
to 11
see 11
me 11
he 11
nodded 11
then 11
come 11
round 11
to 11
the 11
other 11
door 11
but 11
be 11
quiet 11
i 11
have 11
no 11
desire 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
so 11
close 11
to 11
my 11
own 11
house 11
in 11
conversation 11
with 11
aaa 11
nigger 11
like 11
you 11
she 11
had 11
chosen 11
the 11
word 11
deliberately 11
she 11
wished 11
to 11
meet 11
his 11
passion 11
with 11
another 11
kind 11
such 11
would 11
at 11
all 11
events 11
help 11
to 11
keep 11
him 11
quiet 11
in 11
the 11
deep 11
gloom 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
the 11
anger 11
which 11
suffused 11
his 11
face 11
rolling 11
eyeballs 11
and 11
grinding 11
teeth 11
are 11
however 11
sufficient 11
signs 11
of 11
anger 11
to 11
be 11
decipherable 11
in 11
the 11
dark 11
she 11
moved 11
round 11
the 11
corner 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
to 11
her 11
right 11
oolanga 11
was 11
following 11
her 11
when 11
she 11
stopped 11
him 11
by 11
raising 11
her 11
hand 11
no 11
not 11
that 11
door 11
she 11
said 11
that 11
is 11
not 11
for 11
niggers 11
the 11
other 11
door 11
will 11
do 11
well 11
enough 11
for 11
you 11
lady 11
arabella 11
took 11
in 11
her 11
hand 11
a 11
small 11
key 11
which 11
hung 11
at 11
the 11
end 11
of 11
her 11
watchchain 11
and 11
moved 11
to 11
a 11
small 11
door 11
low 11
down 11

the 11
brow 11
oolanga 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
her 11
gesture 11
went 11
back 11
to 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
adam 11
looked 11
carefully 11
at 11
the 11
mongoose 11
box 11
as 11
the 11
african 11
went 11
by 11
and 11
was 11
glad 11
to 11
see 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
intact 11
unconsciously 11
as 11
he 11
looked 11
he 11
fingered 11
the 11
key 11
that 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
waistcoat 11

when 11

the 11
woman 11
turned 11
sharply 11
as 11
adam 11
touched 11
her 11
shoulder 11
one 11
moment 11
whilst 11
we 11
are 11
alone 11
you 11
had 11
better 11
not 11
trust 11
that 11
nigger 11
he 11
whispered 11
her 11
answer 11
was 11
crisp 11
and 11
concise 11
i 11

if 11

why 11
do 11
you 11
mistrust 11
him 11
my 11
friend 11
you 11
have 11
no 11
idea 11
of 11
that 11
mans 11
impudence 11
would 11
you 11
believe 11
that 11
he 11
wants 11
me 11
to 11
marry 11
him 11
no 11
said 11
adam 11
incredulously 11
amused 11
in 11
spite 11
of 11
himself 11
yes 11
and 11
wanted 11
to 11
bribe 11
me 11
to 11
do 11
it 11
by 11
sharing 11
a 11
chest 11
of 11
treasureat 11

he 11
thought 11

why 11
do 11
you 11
distrust 11
him 11
mr 11
salton 11
did 11
you 11
notice 11
that 11
box 11
he 11
had 11
slung 11
on 11
his 11
shoulder 11
that 11
belongs 11
to 11
me 11
i 11
left 11
it 11
in 11
the 11
gunroom 11
when 11
i 11
went 11
to 11
lunch 11
he 11
must 11
have 11
crept 11
in 11
and 11
stolen 11
it 11
doubtless 11
he 11
thinks 11
that 11
it 11
too 11
is 11
full 11
of 11
treasure 11
he 11
does 11
how 11
on 11

do 11
you 11

asked 11
adam 11
a 11
little 11
while 11
ago 11
he 11
offered 11
to 11
give 11
it 11
to 11
meanother 11
bribe 11
to 11
accept 11
him 11
faugh 11
i 11
am 11
ashamed 11
to 11
tell 11
you 11
such 11
a 11
thing 11
the 11
beast 11
whilst 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
speaking 11
she 11
had 11
opened 11
the 11
door 11
a 11
narrow 11
iron 11
one 11
well 11
hung 11
for 11
it 11
opened 11
easily 11
and 11
closed 11
tightly 11
without 11
any 11
creaking 11
or 11
sound 11
of 11
any 11
kind 11
within 11
all 11
was 11
dark 11
but 11
she 11
entered 11
as 11
freely 11
and 11
with 11
as 11
little 11
misgiving 11
or 11
restraint 11
as 11
if 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
broad 11
daylight 11
for 11
adam 11
there 11
was 11
just 11
sufficient 11
green 11
light 11
from 11
somewhere 11
for 11
him 11
to 11
see 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
broad 11
flight 11
of 11
heavy 11
stone 11
steps 11
leading 11
upward 11
but 11
lady 11
arabella 11
after 11
shutting 11
the 11
door 11
behind 11
her 11
when 11
it 11
closed 11
tightly 11
without 11
a 11
clang 11
tripped 11
up 11
the 11
steps 11
lightly 11
and 11
swiftly 11
for 11
an 11
instant 11
all 11
was 11
dark 11
but 11
there 11
came 11
again 11
the 11
faint 11
green 11
light 11
which 11
enabled 11
him 11
to 11
see 11
the 11
outlines 11
of 11
things 11
another 11
iron 11
door 11
narrow 11
like 11
the 11
first 11
and 11
fairly 11
high 11
led 11
into 11
another 11
large 11
room 11
the 11
walls 11
of 11
which 11
were 11
of 11
massive 11
stones 11
so 11
closely 11
joined 11
together 11
as 11
to 11
exhibit 11
only 11
one 11
smooth 11
surface 11
this 11
presented 11
the 11
appearance 11
of 11
having 11
at 11
one 11
time 11
been 11
polished 11
on 11
the 11
far 11
side 11
also 11
smooth 11
like 11
the 11
walls 11
was 11
the 11
reverse 11
of 11
a 11
wide 11
but 11
not 11
high 11
iron 11
door 11
here 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
little 11
more 11
light 11
for 11
the 11
highup 11
aperture 11
over 11
the 11
door 11
opened 11
to 11
the 11
air 11
lady 11
arabella 11
took 11
from 11
her 11
girdle 11
another 11
small 11
key 11
which 11
she 11
inserted 11
in 11
a 11
keyhole 11
in 11
the 11
centre 11
of 11
a 11
massive 11
lock 11
the 11
great 11
bolt 11
seemed 11
wonderfully 11
hung 11
for 11
the 11
moment 11
the 11
small 11
key 11
was 11
turned 11
the 11
bolts 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
lock 11
moved 11
noiselessly 11
and 11
the 11
iron 11
doors 11
swung 11
open 11
on 11
the 11
stone 11
steps 11
outside 11
stood 11
oolanga 11
with 11
the 11
mongoose 11
box 11
slung 11
over 11
his 11
shoulder 11
lady 11
arabella 11
stood 11
a 11
little 11
on 11
one 11
side 11
and 11
the 11
african 11
accepting 11
the 11
movement 11
as 11
an 11
invitation 11
entered 11
in 11
an 11
obsequious 11
way 11
the 11
moment 11
however 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
inside 11
he 11
gave 11
a 11
quick 11
look 11
around 11
him 11
much 11
death 11
herebig 11
death 11
many 11
deaths 11
good 11
good 11
he 11
sniffed 11
round 11
as 11
if 11
he 11
was 11
enjoying 11
the 11
scent 11
the 11
matter 11
and 11
manner 11
of 11
his 11
speech 11
were 11
so 11
revolting 11
that 11
instinctively 11
adams 11
hand 11
wandered 11
to 11
his 11
revolver 11
and 11
with 11
his 11
finger 11
on 11
the 11
trigger 11
he 11
rested 11
satisfied 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
ready 11
for 11
any 11
emergency 11
there 11
was 11
certainly 11
opportunity 11
for 11
the 11
niggers 11
enjoyment 11
for 11
the 11
open 11
wellhole 11
was 11
almost 11
under 11
his 11
nose 11
sending 11
up 11
such 11
a 11
stench 11
as 11
almost 11
made 11
adam 11
sick 11
though 11
lady 11
arabella 11
seemed 11
not 11
to 11
mind 11
it 11
at 11
all 11
it 11
was 11
like 11
nothing 11
that 11
adam 11
had 11
ever 11
met 11
with 11
he 11
compared 11
it 11
with 11
all 11
the 11
noxious 11
experiences 11
he 11
had 11
ever 11
hadthe 11
drainage 11
of 11
war 11
hospitals 11
of 11
slaughterhouses 11
the 11
refuse 11
of 11
dissecting 11
rooms 11
none 11
of 11
these 11
was 11
like 11
it 11
though 11
it 11
had 11
something 11
of 11
them 11
all 11
with 11
added 11
the 11
sourness 11
of 11
chemical 11
waste 11
and 11
the 11
poisonous 11
effluvium 11
of 11
the 11
bilge 11
of 11
a 11
waterlogged 11
ship 11
whereon 11
a 11
multitude 11
of 11
rats 11
had 11
been 11
drowned 11
then 11
quite 11
unexpectedly 11
the 11
negro 11
noticed 11
the 11
presence 11
of 11
a 11
third 11
personadam 11
salton 11
he 11
pulled 11
out 11
a 11
pistol 11
and 11
shot 11
at 11
him 11
happily 11
missing 11
adam 11
was 11
himself 11
usually 11
a 11
quick 11
shot 11
but 11
this 11
time 11
his 11
mind 11
had 11
been 11
on 11
something 11
else 11
and 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
ready 11
however 11
he 11
was 11
quick 11
to 11
carry 11
out 11
an 11
intention 11
and 11
he 11
was 11
not 11
a 11
coward 11
in 11
another 11
moment 11
both 11
men 11
were 11
in 11
grips 11
beside 11
them 11
was 11
the 11
dark 11
wellhole 11
with 11
that 11
horrid 11
effluvium 11
stealing 11
up 11
from 11
its 11
mysterious 11
depths 11
adam 11
and 11
oolanga 11
both 11
had 11
pistols 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
had 11
not 11
one 11
was 11
probably 11
the 11
most 11
ready 11
of 11
them 11
all 11
in 11
the 11
theory 11
of 11
shooting 11
but 11
that 11
being 11
impossible 11
she 11
made 11
her 11
effort 11
in 11
another 11
way 11
gliding 11
forward 11
she 11
tried 11
to 11
seize 11
the 11
african 11
but 11
he 11
eluded 11
her 11
grasp 11
just 11
missing 11
in 11
doing 11
so 11
falling 11
into 11
the 11
mysterious 11
hole 11
as 11
he 11
swayed 11
back 11
to 11
firm 11
foothold 11
he 11
turned 11
his 11
own 11
gun 11
on 11
her 11
and 11
shot 11
instinctively 11
adam 11
leaped 11
at 11
his 11
assailant 11
clutching 11
at 11
each 11
other 11
they 11
tottered 11
on 11
the 11
very 11
brink 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
anger 11
now 11
fully 11
awake 11
was 11
all 11
for 11
oolanga 11
she 11
moved 11
towards 11
him 11
with 11
her 11
hands 11
extended 11
and 11
had 11
just 11
seized 11
him 11
when 11
the 11
catch 11
of 11
the 11
locked 11
boxdue 11
to 11
some 11
movement 11
from 11
within 11
flew 11
open 11
and 11
the 11
kingcobrakiller 11
flew 11
at 11
her 11
with 11
a 11
venomous 11
fury 11
impossible 11
to 11
describe 11
as 11
it 11
seized 11
her 11
throat 11
she 11
caught 11
hold 11
of 11
it 11
and 11
with 11
a 11
fury 11
superior 11
to 11
its 11
own 11
tore 11
it 11
in 11
two 11
just 11
as 11
if 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
a 11
sheet 11
of 11
paper 11
the 11
strength 11
used 11
for 11
such 11
an 11
act 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
terrific 11
in 11
an 11
instant 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
spout 11
blood 11
and 11
entrails 11
and 11
was 11
hurled 11
into 11
the 11
wellhole 11
in 11
another 11
instant 11
she 11
had 11
seized 11
oolanga 11
and 11
with 11
a 11
swift 11
rush 11
had 11
drawn 11
him 11
her 11
white 11
arms 11
encircling 11
him 11
down 11
with 11
her 11
into 11
the 11
gaping 11
aperture 11
adam 11
saw 11
a 11
medley 11
of 11
green 11
and 11
red 11
lights 11
blaze 11
in 11
a 11
whirling 11
circle 11
and 11
as 11
it 11
sank 11
down 11
into 11
the 11
well 11
a 11
pair 11
of 11
blazing 11
green 11
eyes 11
became 11
fixed 11
sank 11
lower 11
and 11
lower 11
with 11
frightful 11
rapidity 11
and 11
disappeared 11
throwing 11
upward 11
the 11
green 11
light 11
which 11
grew 11
more 11
and 11
more 11
vivid 11
every 11
moment 11
as 11
the 11
light 11
sank 11
into 11
the 11
noisome 11
depths 11
there 11
came 11
a 11
shriek 11
which 11
chilled 11
adams 11
blooda 11
prolonged 11
agony 11
of 11
pain 11
and 11
terror 11
which 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
no 11
end 11
adam 11
salton 11
felt 11
that 11
he 11
would 11
never 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
free 11
his 11
mind 11
from 11
the 11
memory 11
of 11
those 11
dreadful 11
moments 11
the 11
gloom 11
which 11
surrounded 11
that 11
horrible 11
charnel 11
pit 11
which 11
seemed 11
to 11
go 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
very 11
bowels 11
of 11
the 11
earth 11
conveyed 11
from 11
far 11
down 11
the 11
sights 11
and 11
sounds 11
of 11
the 11
nethermost 11
hell 11
the 11
ghastly 11
fate 11
of 11
the 11
african 11
as 11
he 11
sank 11
down 11
to 11
his 11
terrible 11
doom 11
his 11
black 11
face 11
growing 11
grey 11
with 11
terror 11
his 11
white 11
eyeballs 11
now 11
like 11
veined 11
bloodstone 11
rolling 11
in 11
the 11
helpless 11
extremity 11
of 11
fear 11
the 11
mysterious 11
green 11
light 11
was 11
in 11
itself 11
a 11
milieu 11
of 11
horror 11
and 11
through 11
it 11
all 11
the 11
awful 11
cry 11
came 11
up 11
from 11
that 11
fathomless 11
pit 11
whose 11
entrance 11
was 11
flooded 11
with 11
spots 11
of 11
fresh 11
blood 11
even 11
the 11
death 11

fierce 11
so 11
frightful 11
as 11
if 11
stained 11
with 11
a 11
ferocity 11
which 11
told 11
of 11
no 11
living 11
force 11
above 11

adam 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
state 11
of 11
intellectual 11
tumult 11
which 11
had 11
no 11
parallel 11
in 11
his 11
experience 11
he 11
tried 11
to 11
rush 11
away 11
from 11
the 11
horrible 11
place 11
even 11
the 11
baleful 11
green 11
light 11
thrown 11
up 11
through 11
the 11
gloomy 11
wellshaft 11
was 11
dying 11
away 11
as 11
its 11
source 11
sank 11
deeper 11
into 11
the 11
primeval 11
ooze 11
the 11
darkness 11
was 11
closing 11
in 11
on 11
him 11
in 11
overwhelming 11
densitydarkness 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
place 11
and 11
with 11
such 11
a 11
memory 11
of 11
it 11
he 11
made 11
a 11
wild 11
rush 11
forwardslipt 11
on 11
the 11
steps 11
in 11
some 11

that 11
felt 11
and 11
smelt 11
like 11
blood 11
and 11
falling 11
forward 11
felt 11
his 11
way 11
into 11
the 11
inner 11
room 11
where 11
the 11
wellshaft 11
was 11
not 11
then 11
he 11
rubbed 11
his 11
eyes 11
in 11
sheer 11
amazement 11
up 11
the 11
stone 11
steps 11
from 11
the 11
narrow 11
door 11
by 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
entered 11
glided 11
the 11
whiteclad 11
figure 11
of 11

on 11
her 11
face 11
and 11
hands 11
and 11
throat 11
otherwise 11
she 11
was 11
calm 11
and 11
unruffled 11
as 11
when 11
earlier 11
she 11
stood 11
aside 11
for 11
him 11
to 11
pass 11

salton 11
went 11
for 11
a 11
walk 11
before 11
returning 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
he 11
felt 11
that 11
it 11
might 11
be 11
well 11
not 11
only 11
to 11
steady 11
his 11
nerves 11
shaken 11
by 11
the 11
horrible 11
scene 11
but 11
to 11
get 11
his 11
thoughts 11
into 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
order 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
be 11
ready 11
to 11
enter 11
on 11
the 11
matter 11
with 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
he 11
was 11
a 11
little 11
embarrassed 11
as 11
to 11
telling 11
his 11
uncle 11
for 11
affairs 11
had 11
so 11
vastly 11
progressed 11
beyond 11
his 11
original 11
view 11
that 11
he 11
felt 11
a 11
little 11
doubtful 11
as 11
to 11
what 11
would 11
be 11
the 11
old 11
gentlemans 11
attitude 11
when 11
he 11
should 11
hear 11
of 11
the 11
strange 11
events 11
for 11
the 11
first 11
time 11
mr 11
salton 11
would 11
certainly 11
not 11
be 11
satisfied 11
at 11
being 11
treated 11
as 11
an 11
outsider 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
such 11
things 11
most 11
of 11
which 11
had 11
points 11
of 11
contact 11
with 11
the 11
inmates 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
house 11
it 11
was 11
with 11
an 11
immense 11
sense 11
of 11
relief 11
that 11
adam 11
heard 11
that 11
his 11
uncle 11
had 11
telegraphed 11
to 11
the 11
housekeeper 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
detained 11
by 11
business 11
at 11
walsall 11
where 11
he 11
would 11
remain 11
for 11
the 11
night 11
and 11
that 11
he 11
would 11
be 11
back 11
in 11
the 11
morning 11
in 11
time 11
for 11
lunch 11
when 11
adam 11
got 11
home 11
after 11
his 11
walk 11
he 11
found 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
just 11
going 11
to 11
bed 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
say 11
anything 11
to 11
him 11
then 11
of 11
what 11
had 11
happened 11
but 11
contented 11
himself 11
with 11
arranging 11
that 11
they 11
would 11
walk 11
together 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
morning 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
much 11
to 11
say 11
that 11
would 11
require 11
serious 11
attention 11
strangely 11
enough 11
he 11
slept 11
well 11
and 11
awoke 11
at 11
dawn 11
with 11
his 11
mind 11
clear 11
and 11
his 11
nerves 11
in 11
their 11
usual 11
unshaken 11
condition 11
the 11
maid 11
brought 11
up 11
with 11
his 11
early 11
morning 11
cup 11
of 11
tea 11
a 11
note 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
found 11
in 11
the 11
letterbox 11
it 11
was 11
from 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
was 11
evidently 11
intended 11
to 11
put 11
him 11
on 11
his 11
guard 11
as 11
to 11
what 11
he 11
should 11
say 11
about 11
the 11
previous 11
evening 11
he 11
read 11
it 11
over 11
carefully 11
several 11
times 11
before 11
he 11
was 11
satisfied 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
taken 11
in 11
its 11
full 11
import 11
dear 11
mr 11
salton 11
i 11
cannot 11
go 11
to 11
bed 11
until 11
i 11
have 11
written 11
to 11
you 11
so 11
you 11
must 11
forgive 11
me 11
if 11
i 11
disturb 11
you 11
and 11
at 11
an 11
unseemly 11
time 11
indeed 11
you 11
must 11
also 11
forgive 11
me 11
if 11
in 11
trying 11
to 11
do 11
what 11
is 11
right 11
i 11
err 11
in 11
saying 11
too 11
much 11
or 11
too 11
little 11
the 11
fact 11
is 11
that 11
i 11
am 11
quite 11
upset 11
and 11
unnerved 11
by 11
all 11
that 11
has 11
happened 11
in 11
this 11
terrible 11
night 11
i 11
find 11
it 11
difficult 11
even 11
to 11
write 11
my 11
hands 11
shake 11
so 11
that 11
they 11
are 11
not 11
under 11
control 11
and 11
i 11
am 11
trembling 11
all 11
over 11
with 11
memory 11
of 11
the 11
horrors 11
we 11
saw 11
enacted 11
before 11
our 11
eyes 11
i 11
am 11
grieved 11
beyond 11
measure 11
that 11
i 11
should 11
be 11
however 11
remotely 11
a 11
cause 11
of 11
this 11
horror 11
coming 11
on 11
you 11
forgive 11
me 11
if 11
you 11
can 11
and 11
do 11
not 11
think 11
too 11
hardly 11
of 11
me 11
this 11
i 11
ask 11
with 11
confidence 11
for 11
since 11
we 11
shared 11
together 11
the 11
dangerthe 11
very 11
pangsof 11
death 11
i 11
feel 11
that 11
we 11
should 11
be 11
to 11
one 11
another 11
something 11
more 11
than 11
mere 11
friends 11
that 11
i 11
may 11
lean 11
on 11
you 11
and 11
trust 11
you 11
assured 11
that 11
your 11
sympathy 11
and 11
pity 11
are 11
for 11
me 11
you 11
really 11
must 11
let 11
me 11
thank 11
you 11
for 11
the 11
friendliness 11
the 11
help 11
the 11
confidence 11
the 11
real 11
aid 11
at 11
a 11
time 11
of 11
deadly 11
danger 11
and 11
deadly 11
fear 11
which 11
you 11
showed 11
me 11
that 11
awful 11
mani 11
shall 11
see 11
him 11
for 11
ever 11
in 11
my 11
dreams 11
his 11
black 11
malignant 11
face 11
will 11
shut 11
out 11
all 11
memory 11
of 11
sunshine 11
and 11
happiness 11
i 11
shall 11
eternally 11
see 11
his 11
evil 11
eyes 11
as 11
he 11
threw 11
himself 11
into 11
that 11
wellhole 11
in 11
a 11
vain 11
effort 11
to 11
escape 11
from 11
the 11
consequences 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
misdoing 11
the 11
more 11
i 11
think 11
of 11
it 11
the 11
more 11
apparent 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
premeditated 11
the 11
whole 11
thingof 11
course 11
except 11
his 11
own 11
horrible 11
death 11
perhaps 11
you 11
have 11
noticed 11
a 11
fur 11
collar 11
i 11
occasionally 11
wear 11
it 11
is 11
one 11
of 11
my 11
most 11
valued 11
treasuresan 11
ermine 11
collar 11
studded 11
with 11
emeralds 11
i 11
had 11
often 11
seen 11
the 11
niggers 11
eyes 11
gleam 11
covetously 11
when 11
he 11
looked 11
at 11
it 11
unhappily 11
i 11
wore 11
it 11
yesterday 11
that 11
may 11
have 11
been 11
the 11
cause 11
that 11
lured 11
the 11
poor 11
man 11
to 11
his 11
doom 11
on 11
the 11
very 11
brink 11
of 11
the 11
abyss 11
he 11
tore 11
the 11
collar 11
from 11
my 11
neckthat 11
was 11
the 11
last 11
i 11
saw 11
of 11
him 11
when 11
he 11
sank 11
into 11
the 11
hole 11
i 11
was 11
rushing 11
to 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
which 11
i 11
pulled 11
behind 11
me 11
when 11
i 11
heard 11
that 11
soul 11
sickening 11
yell 11
which 11
marked 11
his 11
disappearance 11
in 11
the 11
chasm 11
i 11
was 11
more 11
glad 11
than 11
i 11
can 11
say 11
that 11
my 11
eyes 11
were 11
spared 11
the 11
pain 11
and 11
horror 11
which 11
my 11
ears 11
had 11
to 11
endure 11
when 11
i 11
tore 11
myself 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
negros 11
grasp 11
as 11
he 11
sank 11
into 11
the 11
wellhole 11
i 11
realised 11
what 11
freedom 11
meant 11
freedom 11
freedom 11
not 11
only 11
from 11
that 11
noisome 11
prisonhouse 11
which 11
has 11
now 11
such 11
a 11
memory 11
but 11
from 11
the 11
more 11
noisome 11
embrace 11
of 11
that 11
hideous 11
monster 11
whilst 11
i 11
live 11
i 11
shall 11
always 11
thank 11
you 11
for 11
my 11
freedom 11
a 11
woman 11
must 11
sometimes 11
express 11
her 11
gratitude 11
otherwise 11
it 11
becomes 11
too 11
great 11
to 11
bear 11
i 11
am 11
not 11
a 11
sentimental 11
girl 11
who 11
merely 11
likes 11
to 11
thank 11
a 11
man 11
i 11
am 11
a 11
woman 11
who 11
knows 11
all 11
of 11
bad 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
good 11
that 11
life 11
can 11
give 11
i 11
have 11
known 11
what 11
it 11
is 11
to 11
love 11
and 11
to 11
lose 11
but 11
you 11
must 11
not 11
let 11
me 11
bring 11
any 11
unhappiness 11
into 11

must 11
live 11
onas 11
i 11
have 11
livedalone 11
and 11
in 11
addition 11
bear 11
with 11
other 11
woes 11
the 11
memory 11
of 11
this 11
latest 11
insult 11
and 11
horror 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
i 11
must 11

away 11
as 11
quickly 11
as 11
possible 11
from 11

a 11
weeki 11

think 11
however 11
that 11
a 11
week 11
in 11
the 11
rush 11
of 11
busy 11
london 11
surrounded 11
with 11
multitudes 11
of 11
commonplace 11
people 11

help 11
to 11
softeni 11
cannot 11
expect 11
total 11
obliterationthe 11
terrible 11
images 11
of 11
the 11
bygone 11
night 11
when 11
i 11
can 11
sleep 11
easilywhich 11
will 11
be 11

hope 11
after 11
a 11
day 11
or 11
two 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
fit 11
to 11
return 11
home 11
and 11
take 11
up 11
again 11
the 11
burden 11
which 11
will 11
i 11
suppose 11
always 11
be 11
with 11
me 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
most 11
happy 11
to 11
see 11
you 11
on 11
my 11
returnor 11
earlier 11
if 11
my 11
good 11
fortune 11
sends 11
you 11
on 11
any 11
errand 11
to 11
london 11
i 11
shall 11
stay 11
at 11
the 11
mayfair 11
hotel 11
in 11
that 11
busy 11
spot 11
we 11
may 11
forget 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
dangers 11
and 11
horrors 11
we 11
have 11
shared 11
together 11
adieu 11
and 11
thank 11
you 11
again 11
and 11
again 11
for 11
all 11
your 11
kindness 11
and 11
consideration 11
to 11
me 11
arabella 11
marsh 11
adam 11
was 11
surprised 11
by 11
this 11
effusive 11
epistle 11
but 11
he 11
determined 11
to 11
say 11
nothing 11
of 11
it 11
to 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
until 11
he 11
should 11
have 11
thought 11
it 11
well 11
over 11
when 11
adam 11
met 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
at 11
breakfast 11
he 11
was 11
glad 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
taken 11
time 11
to 11
turn 11
things 11
over 11
in 11
his 11
mind 11
the 11
result 11
had 11
been 11
that 11
not 11
only 11
was 11
he 11
familiar 11
with 11
the 11
facts 11
in 11
all 11
their 11
bearings 11
but 11
he 11
had 11
already 11
so 11
far 11
differentiated 11
them 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
able 11
to 11
arrange 11
them 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
mind 11
according 11
to 11
their 11
values 11
breakfast 11
had 11
been 11
a 11
silent 11
function 11
so 11
it 11
did 11
not 11
interfere 11
in 11
any 11
way 11
with 11
the 11
process 11
of 11
thought 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
the 11
door 11
was 11
closed 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
began 11
i 11
see 11
adam 11
that 11
something 11
has 11
occurred 11
and 11
that 11
you 11
have 11
much 11
to 11
tell 11
me 11
that 11
is 11
so 11
sir 11
i 11
suppose 11
i 11
had 11
better 11
begin 11
by 11
telling 11
you 11
all 11
i 11
knowall 11
that 11
has 11
happened 11
since 11
i 11
left 11
you 11
yesterday 11
accordingly 11
adam 11
gave 11
him 11
details 11
of 11
all 11
that 11
had 11
happened 11
during 11
the 11
previous 11
evening 11
he 11
confined 11
himself 11
rigidly 11
to 11
the 11
narration 11
of 11
circumstances 11
taking 11
care 11
not 11
to 11
colour 11
events 11
by 11
any 11
comment 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
or 11
any 11
opinion 11
of 11
the 11
meaning 11
of 11
things 11
which 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
fully 11
understand 11
at 11
first 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
seemed 11
disposed 11
to 11
ask 11
questions 11
but 11
shortly 11
gave 11
this 11
up 11
when 11
he 11
recognised 11
that 11
the 11
narration 11
was 11
concise 11
and 11
selfexplanatory 11
thenceforth 11
he 11
contented 11
himself 11
with 11
quick 11
looks 11
and 11
glances 11
easily 11
interpreted 11
or 11
by 11
some 11
acquiescent 11
motions 11
of 11
his 11
hands 11
when 11
such 11
could 11
be 11
convenient 11
to 11
emphasise 11
his 11
idea 11
of 11
the 11
correctness 11
of 11
any 11
inference 11
until 11
adam 11
ceased 11
speaking 11
having 11
evidently 11
come 11
to 11
an 11
end 11
of 11
what 11
he 11
had 11
to 11
say 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
this 11
section 11
of 11
his 11
story 11
the 11
elder 11
man 11
made 11
no 11
comment 11
whatever 11
even 11
when 11
adam 11
took 11
from 11
his 11
pocket 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
letter 11
with 11
the 11
manifest 11
intention 11
of 11
reading 11
it 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
make 11
any 11
comment 11
finally 11
when 11
adam 11
folded 11
up 11
the 11
letter 11
and 11
put 11
it 11
in 11
its 11
envelope 11
back 11
in 11
his 11
pocket 11
as 11
an 11
intimation 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
now 11
quite 11
finished 11
the 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
carefully 11
made 11
a 11
few 11
notes 11
in 11
his 11
pocketbook 11
your 11
narrative 11
my 11
dear 11
adam 11
is 11
altogether 11
admirable 11
i 11
think 11
i 11
may 11
now 11
take 11
it 11
that 11
we 11
are 11
both 11
well 11
versed 11
in 11
the 11
actual 11
facts 11
and 11
that 11
our 11
conference 11
had 11
better 11
take 11
the 11
shape 11
of 11
a 11
mutual 11
exchange 11
of 11
ideas 11
let 11
us 11
both 11
ask 11
questions 11
as 11
they 11
may 11
arise 11
and 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
doubt 11
that 11
we 11
shall 11
arrive 11
at 11
some 11
enlightening 11
conclusions 11
will 11
you 11
kindly 11
begin 11
sir 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
doubt 11
that 11
with 11
your 11
longer 11
experience 11
you 11
will 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
dissipate 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
fog 11
which 11
envelops 11
certain 11
of 11
the 11
things 11
which 11
we 11
have 11
to 11
consider 11
i 11
hope 11
so 11
my 11
dear 11
boy 11
for 11
a 11
beginning 11
then 11
let 11
me 11
say 11
that 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
letter 11
makes 11
clear 11
some 11
things 11
which 11
she 11
intended 11
and 11
also 11
some 11
things 11
which 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
intend 11
but 11
before 11
i 11
begin 11
to 11
draw 11
deductions 11
let 11
me 11
ask 11
you 11
a 11
few 11
questions 11
adam 11
are 11
you 11
heartwhole 11
quite 11
heartwhole 11
in 11
the 11
matter 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
his 11
companion 11
answered 11
at 11
once 11
each 11
looking 11
the 11
other 11
straight 11
in 11
the 11
eyes 11
during 11
question 11
and 11
answer 11
lady 11
arabella 11
sir 11
is 11
a 11
charming 11
woman 11
and 11
i 11
should 11
have 11
deemed 11
it 11
a 11
privilege 11
to 11
meet 11
herto 11
talk 11
to 11
herevensince 11
i 11
am 11
in 11
the 11
confessionalto 11
flirt 11
a 11
little 11
with 11
her 11
but 11
if 11
you 11
mean 11
to 11
ask 11
if 11
my 11
affections 11
are 11
in 11
any 11
way 11
engaged 11
i 11
can 11
emphatically 11
answer 11
noas 11
indeed 11
you 11
will 11
understand 11
when 11
presently 11
i 11
give 11
you 11
the 11
reason 11
apart 11
from 11
that 11
there 11
are 11
the 11
unpleasant 11
details 11
we 11
discussed 11
the 11
other 11
day 11
could 11
youwould 11
you 11
mind 11
giving 11
me 11
the 11
reason 11
now 11
it 11
will 11
help 11
us 11
to 11
understand 11
what 11
is 11
before 11
us 11
in 11
the 11
way 11
of 11
difficulty 11
certainly 11
sir 11
my 11
reason 11
on 11
which 11
i 11
can 11
fully 11
depend 11
is 11
that 11
i 11
love 11
another 11
woman 11
that 11
clinches 11
it 11
may 11
i 11
offer 11
my 11
good 11
wishes 11
and 11
i 11
hope 11
my 11
congratulations 11
i 11
am 11
proud 11
of 11
your 11
good 11
wishes 11
sir 11
and 11
i 11
thank 11
you 11
for 11
them 11
but 11
it 11
is 11
too 11
soon 11
for 11
congratulationsthe 11
lady 11
does 11
not 11
even 11
know 11
my 11
hopes 11
yet 11
indeed 11
i 11
hardly 11
knew 11
them 11
myself 11
as 11
definite 11
till 11
this 11
moment 11
i 11
take 11
it 11
then 11
adam 11
that 11
at 11
the 11
right 11
time 11
i 11
may 11
be 11
allowed 11
to 11
know 11
who 11
the 11
lady 11
is 11
adam 11
laughed 11
a 11
low 11
sweet 11
laugh 11
such 11
as 11
ripples 11
from 11
a 11
happy 11
heart 11
there 11
need 11
not 11
be 11
an 11
hours 11
a 11
minutes 11
delay 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
glad 11
to 11
share 11
my 11
secret 11
with 11
you 11
sir 11
the 11
lady 11
sir 11
whom 11
i 11
am 11
so 11
happy 11
as 11
to 11
love 11
and 11
in 11
whom 11
my 11
dreams 11
of 11
lifelong 11
happiness 11
are 11
centred 11
is 11
mimi 11
watford 11
then 11
my 11
dear 11
adam 11
i 11
need 11
not 11
wait 11
to 11
offer 11
congratulations 11
she 11
is 11
indeed 11
a 11
very 11
charming 11
young 11
lady 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
think 11
i 11
ever 11
saw 11
a 11
girl 11
who 11
united 11
in 11
such 11
perfection 11
the 11
qualities 11
of 11
strength 11
of 11
character 11
and 11
sweetness 11
of 11
disposition 11
with 11
all 11
my 11
heart 11
i 11
congratulate 11
you 11
then 11
i 11
may 11
take 11
it 11
that 11
my 11
question 11
as 11
to 11
your 11
heartwholeness 11
is 11
answered 11
in 11
the 11
affirmative 11
yes 11
and 11
now 11
sir 11
may 11
i 11
ask 11
in 11
turn 11
why 11
the 11
question 11
certainly 11
i 11
asked 11
because 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
we 11
are 11
coming 11
to 11
a 11
point 11
where 11
my 11
questions 11
might 11
be 11
painful 11
to 11
you 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
merely 11
that 11
i 11
love 11
mimi 11
but 11
i 11
have 11
reason 11
to 11
look 11
on 11
lady 11
arabella 11
as 11
her 11
enemy 11
adam 11
continued 11
her 11
enemy 11
yes 11
a 11
rank 11
and 11
unscrupulous 11
enemy 11
who 11
is 11
bent 11
on 11
her 11
destruction 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
went 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
looked 11
outside 11
it 11
and 11
returned 11
locking 11
it 11
carefully 11
behind 11
him 11
chapter 11
xxmetabolism 11
am 11
i 11
looking 11
grave 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
inconsequently 11
when 11
he 11
re 11
entered 11
the 11
room 11
you 11
certainly 11
are 11
sir 11
we 11
little 11
thought 11
when 11
first 11
we 11
met 11
that 11
we 11
should 11
be 11
drawn 11
into 11
such 11
a 11
vortex 11

of 11

most 11
unnerving 11
kind 11

had 11
their 11
origin 11
in 11
an 11
age 11

the 11

was 11

the 11

the 11
origin 11

must 11

conclusion 11
however 11

almost 11
impossible 11
it 11

and 11
death 11
is 11
hanging 11
on 11
our 11
judgment 11
not 11
only 11
for 11
ourselves 11
but 11
for 11
others 11
whom 11
we 11
love 11
remember 11
i 11
count 11
on 11
you 11
as 11
i 11
hope 11
you 11
count 11
on 11
me 11
i 11
do 11
with 11
all 11
confidence 11
then 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
let 11
us 11
think 11
justly 11
and 11
boldly 11
and 11
fear 11
nothing 11
however 11
terrifying 11
it 11
may 11
seem 11
i 11
suppose 11
i 11
am 11
to 11
take 11
as 11
exact 11
in 11
every 11
detail 11
your 11
account 11
of 11
all 11
the 11
strange 11
things 11
which 11
happened 11
whilst 11
you 11
were 11
in 11
dianas 11
grove 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
i 11
know 11
yes 11
of 11
course 11
i 11
may 11
be 11
mistaken 11
in 11
recollection 11
of 11
some 11
detail 11
or 11
another 11
but 11
i 11
am 11
certain 11
that 11
in 11
the 11
main 11
what 11
i 11
have 11
said 11
is 11
correct 11
you 11
feel 11
sure 11
that 11
you 11
saw 11
lady 11
arabella 11
seize 11
the 11
negro 11
round 11
the 11
neck 11
and 11
drag 11
him 11
down 11
with 11
her 11
into 11
the 11
hole 11
absolutely 11
certain 11
sir 11
otherwise 11
i 11
should 11
have 11
gone 11
to 11
her 11
assistance 11
we 11
have 11
then 11
an 11
account 11
of 11
what 11
happened 11
from 11
an 11
eyewitness 11
whom 11
we 11
trustthat 11
is 11
yourself 11
we 11
have 11
also 11
another 11
account 11
written 11
by 11
lady 11
arabella 11
under 11
her 11
own 11
hand 11
these 11
two 11
accounts 11
do 11
not 11
agree 11
therefore 11
we 11
must 11
take 11
it 11
that 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
two 11
is 11
lying 11
apparently 11
sir 11
and 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
is 11
the 11
liar 11
apparentlyas 11
i 11
am 11
not 11
we 11
must 11
therefore 11
try 11
to 11
find 11
a 11
reason 11
for 11
her 11
lying 11
she 11
has 11
nothing 11
to 11
fear 11
from 11
oolanga 11
who 11
is 11
dead 11
therefore 11
the 11
only 11
reason 11
which 11
could 11
actuate 11
her 11
would 11
be 11
to 11
convince 11
someone 11
else 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
blameless 11
this 11
someone 11
could 11
not 11
be 11
you 11
for 11
you 11
had 11
the 11
evidence 11
of 11
your 11
own 11
eyes 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
one 11
else 11
present 11
therefore 11
it 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
an 11
absent 11
person 11
that 11
seems 11
beyond 11
dispute 11
sir 11
there 11
is 11
only 11
one 11
other 11
person 11
whose 11
good 11
opinion 11
she 11
could 11
wish 11
to 11
keepedgar 11
caswall 11
he 11
is 11
the 11
only 11
one 11
who 11
fills 11
the 11
bill 11
her 11
lies 11
point 11
to 11
other 11
things 11
besides 11
the 11
death 11
of 11
the 11
african 11
she 11
evidently 11
wanted 11
it 11
to 11
be 11
accepted 11
that 11
his 11
falling 11
into 11
the 11
well 11
was 11
his 11
own 11
act 11
i 11
cannot 11
suppose 11
that 11
she 11
expected 11
to 11
convince 11
you 11
the 11
eyewitness 11
but 11
if 11
she 11
wished 11
later 11
on 11
to 11
spread 11
the 11
story 11
it 11
was 11
wise 11
of 11
her 11
to 11
try 11
to 11
get 11
your 11
acceptance 11
of 11
it 11
that 11
is 11
so 11
then 11
there 11
were 11
other 11
matters 11
of 11
untruth 11
that 11
for 11
instance 11
of 11
the 11
ermine 11
collar 11
embroidered 11
with 11
emeralds 11
if 11
an 11
understandable 11
reason 11
be 11
required 11
for 11
this 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
to 11
draw 11
attention 11
away 11
from 11
the 11
green 11
lights 11
which 11
were 11
seen 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
and 11
especially 11
in 11
the 11
wellhole 11
any 11
unprejudiced 11
person 11
would 11
accept 11
the 11
green 11
lights 11
to 11
be 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
a 11
great 11
snake 11
such 11
as 11
tradition 11
pointed 11
to 11
living 11
in 11
the 11
wellhole 11
in 11
fine 11
therefore 11
lady 11
arabella 11
wanted 11
the 11
general 11
belief 11
to 11
be 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
snake 11
of 11
the 11
kind 11
in 11
dianas 11
grove 11
for 11
my 11
own 11
part 11
i 11
dont 11
believe 11
in 11
a 11
partial 11
liarthis 11
art 11
does 11
not 11
deal 11
in 11
veneer 11
a 11
liar 11
is 11
a 11
liar 11
right 11
through 11
selfinterest 11
may 11
prompt 11
falsity 11
of 11
the 11
tongue 11
but 11
if 11
one 11
prove 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
liar 11
nothing 11
that 11
he 11
says 11
can 11
ever 11
be 11
believed 11
this 11
leads 11
us 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
because 11
she 11
said 11
or 11
inferred 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
snake 11
we 11
should 11
look 11
for 11
oneand 11
expect 11
to 11
find 11
it 11
too 11
now 11
let 11
me 11
digress 11
i 11
live 11
and 11
have 11
for 11
many 11
years 11
lived 11
in 11
derbyshire 11
a 11
county 11
more 11
celebrated 11
for 11
its 11
caves 11
than 11
any 11
other 11
county 11
in 11
england 11
i 11
have 11
been 11
through 11
them 11
all 11
and 11
am 11
familiar 11
with 11
every 11
turn 11
of 11
them 11
as 11
also 11
with 11
other 11
great 11
caves 11
in 11
kentucky 11
in 11
france 11
in 11
germany 11
and 11
a 11
host 11
of 11
other 11
placesin 11
many 11
of 11
these 11
are 11
tremendously 11
deep 11
caves 11
of 11
narrow 11
aperture 11
which 11
are 11
valued 11
by 11
intrepid 11
explorers 11
who 11
descend 11
narrow 11
gullets 11
of 11
abysmal 11
depthand 11
sometimes 11
never 11
return 11
in 11
many 11
of 11
the 11
caverns 11
in 11
the 11
peak 11
i 11
am 11
convinced 11
that 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
smaller 11
passages 11
were 11
used 11
in 11
primeval 11
times 11
as 11
the 11
lairs 11
of 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
serpents 11
of 11
legend 11
and 11
tradition 11
it 11
may 11
have 11
been 11
that 11
such 11
caverns 11
were 11
formed 11
in 11
the 11
usual 11
geologic 11
waybubbles 11
or 11
flaws 11
in 11
the 11
earths 11
crustwhich 11
were 11
later 11
used 11
by 11
the 11
monsters 11
of 11
the 11
period 11
of 11
the 11
young 11
world 11
it 11
may 11
have 11
been 11
of 11
course 11
that 11
some 11
of 11
them 11
were 11
worn 11
originally 11
by 11
water 11
but 11
in 11
time 11
they 11
all 11
found 11
a 11
use 11
when 11
suitable 11
for 11
living 11
monsters 11
this 11
brings 11
us 11
to 11
another 11
point 11
more 11
difficult 11
to 11
accept 11
and 11
understand 11
than 11
any 11
other 11
requiring 11
belief 11
in 11
a 11
base 11
not 11
usually 11
accepted 11
or 11
indeed 11
entered 11
onwhether 11
such 11
abnormal 11
growths 11
could 11
have 11
ever 11
changed 11
in 11
their 11
nature 11
some 11
day 11
the 11
study 11
of 11
metabolism 11
may 11
progress 11
so 11
far 11
as 11
to 11
enable 11
us 11
to 11
accept 11
structural 11
changes 11
proceeding 11
from 11
an 11
intellectual 11
or 11
moral 11
base 11
we 11
may 11
lean 11
towards 11
a 11
belief 11
that 11
great 11
animal 11
strength 11
may 11
be 11
a 11
sound 11
base 11
for 11
changes 11
of 11
all 11
sorts 11
if 11
this 11
be 11
so 11
what 11
could 11
be 11
a 11
more 11
fitting 11
subject 11
than 11
primeval 11
monsters 11
whose 11
strength 11
was 11
such 11
as 11
to 11
allow 11
a 11
survival 11
of 11
thousands 11
of 11
years 11
we 11
do 11
not 11
know 11
yet 11
if 11
brain 11
can 11
increase 11
and 11
develop 11
independently 11
of 11
other 11
parts 11
of 11
the 11
living 11
structure 11
after 11
all 11
the 11
mediaeval 11
belief 11
in 11
the 11
philosophers 11
stone 11
which 11
could 11
transmute 11
metals 11
has 11
its 11
counterpart 11
in 11
the 11
accepted 11
theory 11
of 11
metabolism 11
which 11
changes 11
living 11
tissue 11
in 11
an 11
age 11
of 11
investigation 11
like 11
our 11
own 11
when 11
we 11
are 11
returning 11

science 11
as 11
the 11
base 11
of 11

however 11
impossible 11

us 11

its 11
own 11
process 11

change 11
much 11
of 11
its 11

should 11
at 11
once 11
arrive 11
at 11
a 11
new 11
class 11
of 11
creaturemore 11
dangerous 11
perhaps 11
than 11
the 11
world 11
has 11
ever 11
had 11
any 11
experience 11
ofa 11
force 11
which 11
can 11
think 11
which 11
has 11
no 11
soul 11
and 11
no 11
morals 11
and 11
therefore 11
no 11
acceptance 11
of 11
responsibility 11
a 11
snake 11
would 11
be 11
a 11
good 11
illustration 11
of 11
this 11
for 11
it 11
is 11
coldblooded 11
and 11
therefore 11
removed 11
from 11
the 11
temptations 11
which 11
often 11
weaken 11
or 11
restrict 11
warmblooded 11
creatures 11
if 11
for 11
instance 11
the 11
worm 11

such 11
ever 11
existedwere 11
guided 11
to 11
its 11
own 11
ends 11
by 11
an 11
organised 11
intelligence 11
capable 11
of 11
expansion 11
what 11
form 11
of 11
creature 11
could 11
we 11
imagine 11
which 11
would 11
equal 11
it 11
in 11
potentialities 11
of 11
evil 11
why 11
such 11
a 11
being 11
would 11
devastate 11
a 11
whole 11
country 11
now 11
all 11
these 11
things 11
require 11
much 11
thought 11
and 11
we 11
want 11
to 11
apply 11
the 11
knowledge 11
usefully 11
and 11
we 11
should 11
therefore 11
be 11
exact 11
would 11
it 11
not 11
be 11
well 11
to 11
resume 11
the 11
subject 11
later 11
in 11
the 11
day 11
i 11
quite 11
agree 11
sir 11
i 11
am 11
in 11
a 11
whirl 11
already 11
and 11
want 11
to 11
attend 11
carefully 11
to 11
what 11
you 11
say 11
so 11
that 11
i 11
may 11
try 11
to 11
digest 11
it 11
both 11
men 11
seemed 11
fresher 11
and 11
better 11
for 11
the 11
easy 11
and 11
when 11
they 11
met 11
in 11
the 11
afternoon 11
each 11
of 11
them 11
had 11
something 11
to 11
contribute 11
to 11
the 11
general 11
stock 11
of 11
information 11
adam 11
who 11
was 11
by 11
nature 11
of 11
a 11
more 11
militant 11
disposition 11
than 11
his 11
elderly 11
friend 11
was 11
glad 11
to 11
see 11
that 11
the 11
conference 11
at 11
once 11
assumed 11
a 11
practical 11
trend 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
recognised 11
this 11
and 11
like 11
an 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
turned 11
it 11
to 11
present 11
use 11
tell 11
me 11
now 11
adam 11
what 11
is 11
the 11
outcome 11
in 11
your 11
own 11
mind 11
of 11
our 11
conversation 11
that 11
the 11
whole 11
difficulty 11
already 11
assumes 11
practical 11
shape 11
but 11
with 11
added 11
dangers 11
that 11
at 11
first 11
i 11
did 11
not 11
imagine 11
what 11
is 11
the 11
practical 11
shape 11
and 11
what 11
are 11
the 11
added 11
dangers 11
i 11
am 11
not 11
disputing 11
but 11
only 11
trying 11
to 11
clear 11
my 11
own 11
ideas 11
by 11
the 11
consideration 11
of 11
yours 11
so 11
adam 11
went 11
on 11
in 11
the 11
past 11
in 11
the 11
early 11
days 11
of 11
the 11
world 11
there 11
were 11
monsters 11
who 11
were 11
so 11
vast 11
that 11
they 11
could 11
exist 11
for 11
thousands 11
of 11
years 11
some 11
of 11
them 11
must 11
have 11
overlapped 11
the 11
christian 11
era 11
they 11
may 11
have 11
progressed 11
intellectually 11
in 11
process 11
of 11
time 11
if 11
they 11
had 11
in 11
any 11
way 11
so 11
progressed 11
or 11
even 11
got 11
the 11
most 11
rudimentary 11
form 11
of 11
brain 11
they 11
would 11
be 11
the 11
most 11
dangerous 11
things 11
that 11
ever 11
were 11
in 11
the 11
world 11
tradition 11
says 11
that 11
one 11
of 11
these 11
monsters 11
lived 11
in 11
the 11
marsh 11
of 11
the 11
east 11
and 11
came 11
up 11
to 11
a 11
cave 11
in 11
dianas 11
grove 11
which 11
was 11
also 11
called 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
such 11
creatures 11
may 11
have 11
grown 11
down 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
up 11
they 11
may 11
have 11
grown 11
into 11
or 11
something 11
like 11
human 11

lady 11
arabella 11

she 11
has 11
committed 11
crimes 11
to 11
our 11
knowledge 11
she 11
retains 11
something 11
of 11
the 11
vast 11
strength 11
of 11
her 11
primal 11
beingcan 11
see 11
in 11
the 11
darkhas 11
the 11
eyes 11
of 11
a 11
snake 11
she 11
used 11
the 11
nigger 11
and 11
then 11
dragged 11
him 11
through 11
the 11
snakes 11
hole 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
swamp 11
she 11
is 11
intent 11
on 11
evil 11
and 11
hates 11
some 11
one 11
we 11
love 11
result 11
yes 11
the 11
result 11
first 11
that 11
mimi 11
watford 11
should 11
be 11
taken 11
away 11
at 11
oncethen 11
yes 11
the 11
monster 11
must 11
be 11
destroyed 11
bravo 11
that 11
is 11
a 11
true 11
and 11
fearless 11
conclusion 11
at 11
whatever 11
cost 11
it 11
must 11
be 11
carried 11
out 11
at 11
once 11
soon 11
at 11
all 11
events 11
that 11
creatures 11
very 11
existence 11
is 11
a 11
danger 11
her 11
presence 11
in 11
this 11
neighbourhood 11
makes 11
the 11
danger 11
immediate 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
mouth 11
hardened 11
and 11
his 11
eyebrows 11
came 11
down 11
till 11
they 11
met 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
doubting 11
his 11
concurrence 11
in 11
the 11
resolution 11
or 11
his 11
readiness 11
to 11
help 11
in 11
carrying 11
it 11
out 11
but 11
he 11
was 11
an 11
elderly 11
man 11
with 11
much 11
experience 11
and 11
knowledge 11
of 11
law 11
and 11
diplomacy 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
him 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
stern 11
duty 11
to 11
prevent 11
anything 11
irrevocable 11
taking 11
place 11
till 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
thought 11
out 11
and 11
all 11
was 11
ready 11
there 11
were 11
all 11
sorts 11
of 11
legal 11
cruxes 11
to 11
be 11
thought 11
out 11
not 11
only 11
regarding 11
the 11
taking 11
of 11
life 11
even 11
of 11
a 11
monstrosity 11

the 11
ground 11
she 11
moved 11
in 11
according 11
to 11
british 11
law 11
and 11
the 11
law 11
is 11
jealous 11
and 11
swift 11
to 11
avenge 11
wrongs 11
done 11
within 11
its 11
ken 11
all 11
such 11
difficulties 11
should 11
bemust 11

for 11

sake 11
for 11

and 11
most 11
of 11
all 11
for 11
mimi 11
watfords 11
sake 11
before 11
he 11
spoke 11
again 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
made 11
up 11
his 11
mind 11
that 11
he 11
must 11
try 11
to 11
postpone 11
decisive 11
action 11
until 11
the 11
circumstances 11
on 11
which 11
they 11
dependedwhich 11
after 11
all 11
were 11
only 11
problematical 11
should 11
have 11
been 11
tested 11
satisfactorily 11
one 11
way 11
or 11
another 11
when 11
he 11
did 11
speak 11
adam 11
at 11
first 11
thought 11
that 11
his 11
friend 11
was 11
wavering 11
in 11
his 11
intention 11
or 11
funking 11
the 11
responsibility 11
however 11
his 11
respect 11
for 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
so 11
great 11
that 11
he 11
would 11
not 11
act 11
or 11
even 11
come 11
to 11
a 11
conclusion 11
on 11
a 11
vital 11
point 11
without 11
his 11
sanction 11
he 11
came 11
close 11
and 11
whispered 11
in 11
his 11
ear 11
we 11
will 11
prepare 11
our 11
plans 11
to 11
combat 11
and 11
destroy 11
this 11
horrible 11
menace 11
after 11
we 11
have 11
cleared 11
up 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
more 11
baffling 11
points 11
meanwhile 11
we 11
must 11
wait 11
for 11
the 11
nighti 11
hear 11
my 11
uncles 11
footsteps 11
echoing 11
down 11
the 11
hall 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
nodded 11
his 11
approval 11

light 11
when 11
old 11
mr 11
salton 11
had 11
retired 11
for 11
the 11
night 11
adam 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
returned 11
to 11
the 11
study 11
things 11
went 11
with 11
great 11
regularity 11
at 11
lesser 11
hill 11
so 11
they 11
knew 11
that 11
there 11
would 11
be 11
no 11
interruption 11
to 11
their 11
talk 11
when 11
their 11
cigars 11
were 11
lighted 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
began 11
i 11
hope 11
adam 11
that 11
you 11
do 11
not 11
think 11
me 11
either 11
slack 11
or 11
changeable 11
of 11
purpose 11
i 11
mean 11
to 11
go 11
through 11
this 11
business 11
to 11
the 11
bitter 11
end 11
whatever 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
be 11
satisfied 11
that 11
my 11
first 11
care 11
is 11
and 11
shall 11
be 11
the 11
protection 11
of 11
mimi 11
watford 11
to 11
that 11
i 11
am 11
pledged 11
my 11
dear 11
boy 11
we 11
who 11
are 11
interested 11
are 11
all 11
in 11
the 11
same 11
danger 11
that 11
semi 11
human 11
monster 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
pit 11
hates 11
and 11
means 11
to 11
destroy 11
us 11
allyou 11
and 11
me 11
certainly 11
and 11
probably 11
your 11
uncle 11
i 11
wanted 11
especially 11
to 11
talk 11
with 11
you 11
tonight 11
for 11
i 11
cannot 11
help 11
thinking 11
that 11
the 11
time 11
is 11
fast 11
comingif 11
it 11
has 11
not 11
come 11
alreadywhen 11
we 11
must 11
take 11
your 11
uncle 11
into 11
our 11
confidence 11
it 11
was 11
one 11
thing 11
when 11
fancied 11
evils 11
threatened 11
but 11
now 11
he 11
is 11
probably 11
marked 11
for 11
death 11
and 11
it 11
is 11
only 11
right 11
that 11
he 11
should 11
know 11
all 11
i 11
am 11
with 11
you 11
sir 11
things 11
have 11
changed 11
since 11
we 11
agreed 11
to 11
keep 11
him 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
trouble 11
now 11
we 11
dare 11
not 11
consideration 11
for 11
his 11
feelings 11
might 11
cost 11
his 11
life 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
dutyand 11
no 11
light 11
or 11
pleasant 11
one 11
either 11
i 11
have 11
not 11
a 11
shadow 11
of 11
doubt 11
that 11
he 11
will 11
want 11
to 11
be 11
one 11
with 11
us 11
in 11
this 11
but 11
remember 11
we 11
are 11
his 11
guests 11
his 11
name 11
his 11
honour 11
have 11
to 11
be 11
thought 11
of 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
his 11
safety 11
all 11
shall 11
be 11
as 11
you 11
wish 11
adam 11
and 11
now 11
as 11
to 11
what 11
we 11
are 11
to 11
do 11
we 11
cannot 11
murder 11
lady 11
arabella 11
offhand 11
therefore 11
we 11
shall 11
have 11
to 11
put 11
things 11
in 11
order 11
for 11
the 11
killing 11
and 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
way 11
that 11
we 11
cannot 11
be 11
taxed 11
with 11
a 11
crime 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
sir 11
that 11
we 11
are 11
in 11
an 11
exceedingly 11
tight 11
place 11
our 11
first 11
difficulty 11
is 11
to 11
know 11
where 11
to 11
begin 11
i 11
never 11
thought 11
this 11
fighting 11
an 11
antediluvian 11
monster 11
would 11
be 11
such 11
a 11
complicated 11
job 11
this 11
one 11
is 11
a 11
woman 11
with 11
all 11
a 11
womans 11
wit 11
combined 11
with 11
the 11
heartlessness 11
of 11
a 11
cocotte 11
she 11
has 11
the 11
strength 11
and 11
impregnability 11
of 11
a 11
diplodocus 11
we 11
may 11
be 11
sure 11
that 11
in 11
the 11
fight 11
that 11
is 11
before 11
us 11
there 11
will 11
be 11
no 11
semblance 11
of 11
fairplay 11
also 11
that 11
our 11
unscrupulous 11
opponent 11
will 11
not 11
betray 11
herself 11
that 11
is 11
sobut 11
being 11
feminine 11
she 11
will 11
probably 11
overreach 11
herself 11
now 11
adam 11
it 11
strikes 11
me 11
that 11
as 11
we 11
have 11
to 11
protect 11
ourselves 11
and 11
others 11
against 11
feminine 11
nature 11
our 11
strong 11
game 11
will 11
be 11
to 11
play 11
our 11
masculine 11
against 11
her 11
feminine 11
perhaps 11
we 11
had 11
better 11
sleep 11
on 11
it 11
she 11
is 11
a 11
thing 11
of 11
the 11
night 11
and 11
the 11
night 11
may 11
give 11
us 11
some 11
ideas 11
so 11
they 11
both 11
turned 11
in 11
adam 11
knocked 11
at 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
door 11
in 11
the 11
grey 11
of 11
the 11
morning 11
and 11
on 11
being 11
bidden 11
came 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
he 11
had 11
several 11
letters 11
in 11
his 11
hand 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
sat 11
up 11
in 11
bed 11
well 11
i 11
should 11
like 11
to 11
read 11
you 11
a 11
few 11
letters 11
but 11
of 11
course 11
i 11
shall 11
not 11
send 11
them 11
unless 11
you 11
approve 11
in 11
factwith 11
a 11
smile 11
and 11
a 11
blushthere 11
are 11
several 11
things 11
which 11
i 11
want 11
to 11
do 11
but 11
i 11
hold 11
my 11
hand 11
and 11
my 11
tongue 11
till 11
i 11
have 11
your 11
approval 11
go 11
on 11
said 11
the 11
other 11
kindly 11
tell 11
me 11
all 11
and 11
count 11
at 11
any 11
rate 11
on 11
my 11
sympathy 11
and 11
on 11
my 11
approval 11
and 11
help 11
if 11
i 11
can 11
see 11
my 11
way 11
accordingly 11
adam 11
proceeded 11
when 11
i 11
told 11
you 11
the 11
conclusions 11
at 11
which 11
i 11
had 11
arrived 11
i 11
put 11
in 11
the 11
foreground 11
that 11
mimi 11
watford 11
should 11
for 11
the 11
sake 11
of 11
her 11
own 11
safety 11
be 11
removedand 11
that 11
the 11
monster 11
which 11
had 11
wrought 11
all 11
the 11
harm 11
should 11
be 11
destroyed 11
yes 11
that 11
is 11
so 11
to 11
carry 11
this 11
into 11
practice 11
sir 11
one 11
preliminary 11
is 11
required 11
unless 11
harm 11
of 11
another 11
kind 11
is 11
to 11
be 11
faced 11
mimi 11
should 11
have 11
some 11
protector 11
whom 11
all 11
the 11
world 11
would 11
recognise 11
the 11
only 11
form 11
recognised 11
by 11
convention 11
is 11
marriage 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
smiled 11
in 11
a 11
fatherly 11
way 11
to 11
marry 11
a 11
husband 11
is 11
required 11
and 11
that 11
husband 11
should 11
be 11
you 11
yes 11
yes 11
and 11
the 11
marriage 11
should 11
be 11
immediate 11
and 11
secretor 11
at 11
least 11
not 11
spoken 11
of 11
outside 11
ourselves 11
would 11
the 11
young 11
lady 11
be 11
agreeable 11
to 11
that 11
proceeding 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
know 11
sir 11
then 11
how 11
are 11
we 11
to 11
proceed 11
i 11
suppose 11
that 11
weor 11
one 11
of 11
usmust 11
ask 11
her 11
is 11
this 11
a 11
sudden 11
idea 11
adam 11
a 11
sudden 11
resolution 11
a 11
sudden 11
resolution 11
sir 11
but 11
not 11
a 11
sudden 11
idea 11
if 11
she 11
agrees 11
all 11
is 11
well 11
and 11
good 11
the 11
sequence 11
is 11
obvious 11
and 11
it 11
is 11
to 11
be 11
kept 11
a 11
secret 11
amongst 11
ourselves 11
i 11
want 11
no 11
secret 11
sir 11
except 11
for 11
mimis 11
good 11
for 11
myself 11
i 11
should 11
like 11
to 11
shout 11
it 11
from 11
the 11
housetops 11
but 11
we 11
must 11
be 11
discreet 11
untimely 11
knowledge 11
to 11
our 11
enemy 11
might 11
work 11
incalculable 11
harm 11
and 11
how 11
would 11
you 11
suggest 11
adam 11
that 11
we 11
could 11
combine 11
the 11
momentous 11
question 11
with 11
secrecy 11
adam 11
grew 11
red 11
and 11
moved 11
uneasily 11
someone 11
must 11
ask 11
heras 11
soon 11
as 11
possible 11
and 11
that 11
someone 11
i 11
thought 11
that 11
you 11
sir 11
would 11
be 11
so 11
good 11
god 11
bless 11
my 11
soul 11
this 11
is 11
a 11
new 11
kind 11
of 11
duty 11
to 11
take 11
onat 11
my 11
time 11
of 11
life 11
adam 11
i 11
hope 11
you 11
know 11
that 11
you 11
can 11
count 11
on 11
me 11
to 11
help 11
in 11
any 11
way 11
i 11
can 11
i 11
have 11
already 11
counted 11
on 11
you 11
sir 11
when 11
i 11
ventured 11
to 11
make 11
such 11
a 11
suggestion 11
i 11
can 11
only 11
ask 11
he 11
added 11
that 11
you 11
will 11
be 11
more 11
than 11
ever 11
kind 11
to 11
meto 11
usand 11
look 11
on 11
the 11
painful 11
duty 11
as 11
a 11
voluntary 11
act 11
of 11
grace 11
prompted 11
by 11
kindness 11
and 11
affection 11
painful 11
duty 11
yes 11
said 11
adam 11
boldly 11
painful 11
to 11
you 11
though 11
to 11
me 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
all 11
joyful 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
strange 11
job 11
for 11
an 11
early 11
morning 11
well 11
we 11
all 11
live 11
and 11
learn 11
i 11
suppose 11
the 11
sooner 11
i 11
go 11
the 11
better 11
you 11
had 11
better 11
write 11
a 11
line 11
for 11
me 11
to 11
take 11
with 11
me 11
for 11
you 11
see 11
this 11
is 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
somewhat 11
unusual 11
transaction 11
and 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
embarrassing 11
to 11
the 11
lady 11
even 11
to 11
myself 11
so 11
we 11
ought 11
to 11
have 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
warrant 11
something 11
to 11
show 11
that 11
we 11
have 11
been 11
mindful 11
of 11
her 11
feelings 11
it 11
will 11
not 11
do 11
to 11
take 11
acquiescence 11
for 11
grantedalthough 11
we 11
act 11
for 11
her 11
good 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
you 11
are 11
a 11
true 11
friend 11
i 11
am 11
sure 11
that 11
both 11
mimi 11
and 11
i 11
shall 11
be 11
grateful 11
to 11
you 11
for 11
all 11
our 11
liveshowever 11
long 11
they 11
may 11
be 11
so 11
the 11
two 11
talked 11
it 11
over 11
and 11
agreed 11
as 11
to 11
points 11
to 11
be 11
borne 11
in 11
mind 11
by 11
the 11
ambassador 11
it 11
was 11
striking 11
ten 11
when 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
left 11
the 11
house 11
adam 11
seeing 11
him 11
quietly 11
off 11
as 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
followed 11
him 11
with 11
wistful 11
eyesalmost 11
jealous 11
of 11
the 11
privilege 11
which 11
his 11
kind 11
deed 11
was 11
about 11
to 11
bring 11
himhe 11
felt 11
that 11
his 11
own 11
heart 11
was 11
in 11
his 11
friends 11
breast 11
the 11
memory 11
of 11
that 11
morning 11
was 11
like 11
a 11
dream 11
to 11
all 11
those 11
concerned 11
in 11
it 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
a 11
confused 11
recollection 11
of 11
detail 11
and 11
sequence 11
though 11
the 11
main 11
facts 11
stood 11
out 11
in 11
his 11
memory 11
boldly 11
and 11
clearly 11
adam 11
saltons 11
recollection 11
was 11
of 11
an 11
illimitable 11
wait 11
filled 11
with 11
anxiety 11
hope 11
and 11
chagrin 11
all 11
dominated 11
by 11
a 11
sense 11
of 11
the 11
slow 11
passage 11
of 11
time 11
and 11
accompanied 11
by 11
vague 11
fears 11
mimi 11
could 11
not 11
for 11
a 11
long 11
time 11
think 11
at 11
all 11
or 11
recollect 11
anything 11
except 11
that 11
adam 11
loved 11
her 11
and 11
was 11
saving 11
her 11
from 11
a 11
terrible 11
danger 11
when 11
she 11
had 11
time 11
to 11
think 11
later 11
on 11
she 11
wondered 11
when 11
she 11
had 11
any 11
ignorance 11
of 11
the 11
fact 11
that 11
adam 11
loved 11
her 11
and 11
that 11
she 11
loved 11
him 11
with 11
all 11
her 11
heart 11
everything 11
every 11
recollection 11
however 11
small 11
every 11
feeling 11
seemed 11
to 11
fit 11
into 11
those 11
elemental 11
facts 11
as 11
though 11
they 11
had 11
all 11
been 11
moulded 11
together 11
the 11
main 11
and 11
crowning 11
recollection 11
was 11
her 11
saying 11
goodbye 11
to 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
and 11
entrusting 11
to 11
him 11
loving 11
messages 11
straight 11
from 11
her 11
heart 11
to 11
adam 11
salton 11
and 11
of 11
his 11
bearing 11
when 11
with 11
an 11
impulse 11
which 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
checkshe 11
put 11
her 11
lips 11
to 11
his 11
and 11
kissed 11
him 11
later 11
when 11
she 11
was 11
alone 11
and 11
had 11
time 11
to 11
think 11
it 11
was 11
a 11
passing 11
grief 11
to 11
her 11
that 11
she 11
would 11
have 11
to 11
be 11
silent 11
for 11
a 11
time 11
to 11
lilla 11
on 11
the 11
happy 11
events 11
of 11
that 11
strange 11
mission 11
she 11
had 11
of 11
course 11
agreed 11
to 11
keep 11
all 11
secret 11
until 11
adam 11
should 11
give 11
her 11
leave 11
to 11
speak 11
the 11
advice 11
and 11
assistance 11
of 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
a 11
great 11
help 11
to 11
adam 11
in 11
carrying 11
out 11
his 11
idea 11
of 11
marrying 11
mimi 11
watford 11
without 11
publicity 11
he 11
went 11
with 11
him 11
to 11
london 11
and 11
with 11
his 11
influence 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
obtained 11
the 11
license 11
of 11
the 11
archbishop 11
of 11
canterbury 11
for 11
a 11
private 11
marriage 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
then 11
persuaded 11
old 11
mr 11
salton 11
to 11
allow 11
his 11
nephew 11
to 11
spend 11
a 11
few 11
weeks 11
with 11
him 11
at 11
doom 11
tower 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
here 11
that 11
mimi 11
became 11
adams 11
wife 11
but 11
that 11
was 11
only 11
the 11
first 11
step 11
in 11
their 11
plans 11
before 11
going 11
further 11
however 11
adam 11
took 11
his 11
bride 11
off 11
to 11
the 11
isle 11
of 11
man 11
he 11
wished 11
to 11
place 11
a 11
stretch 11
of 11
sea 11
between 11
mimi 11
and 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
while 11
things 11
matured 11
on 11
their 11
return 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
met 11
them 11
and 11
drove 11
them 11
at 11
once 11
to 11
doom 11
taking 11
care 11
to 11
avoid 11
any 11
one 11
that 11
he 11
knew 11
on 11
the 11
journey 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
taken 11
care 11
to 11
have 11
the 11
doors 11
and 11
windows 11
shut 11
and 11
lockedall 11
but 11
the 11
door 11
used 11
for 11
their 11
entry 11
the 11
shutters 11
were 11
up 11
and 11
the 11
blinds 11
down 11
moreover 11
heavy 11
curtains 11
were 11
drawn 11
across 11
the 11
windows 11
when 11
adam 11
commented 11
on 11
this 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
said 11
in 11
a 11
whisper 11
wait 11
till 11
we 11
are 11
alone 11
and 11
ill 11
tell 11
you 11
why 11
this 11
is 11
done 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
not 11
a 11
word 11
or 11
a 11
sign 11
you 11
will 11
approve 11
when 11
we 11
have 11
had 11
a 11
talk 11
together 11
they 11
said 11
no 11
more 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
till 11
after 11
dinner 11
when 11
they 11
were 11
ensconced 11
in 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
study 11
which 11
was 11
on 11
the 11
top 11
storey 11
doom 11
tower 11
was 11
a 11
lofty 11
structure 11
situated 11
on 11
an 11
eminence 11
high 11
up 11
in 11
the 11
peak 11
the 11
top 11
commanded 11
a 11
wide 11
prospect 11
ranging 11
from 11
the 11
hills 11
above 11
the 11
ribble 11
to 11
the 11
near 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
which 11
marked 11
the 11
northern 11
bound 11
of 11
ancient 11
mercia 11
it 11
was 11
of 11
the 11
early 11
norman 11
period 11
less 11
than 11
a 11
century 11
younger 11
than 11
castra 11
regis 11
the 11
windows 11
of 11
the 11
study 11
were 11
barred 11
and 11
locked 11
and 11
heavy 11
dark 11
curtains 11
closed 11
them 11
in 11
when 11
this 11
was 11
done 11
not 11
a 11
gleam 11
of 11
light 11
from 11
the 11
tower 11
could 11
be 11
seen 11
from 11
outside 11
when 11
they 11
were 11
alone 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
explained 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
taken 11
his 11
old 11
friend 11
mr 11
salton 11
into 11
full 11
confidence 11
and 11
that 11
in 11
future 11
all 11
would 11
work 11
together 11
it 11
is 11
important 11
for 11
you 11
to 11
be 11
extremely 11
careful 11
in 11
spite 11
of 11
the 11
fact 11
that 11
our 11
marriage 11
was 11
kept 11
secret 11
as 11
also 11
your 11
temporary 11
absence 11
both 11
are 11
known 11
how 11
to 11
whom 11
how 11
i 11
know 11
not 11
but 11
i 11
am 11
beginning 11
to 11
have 11
an 11
idea 11
to 11
her 11
asked 11
adam 11
in 11
momentary 11
consternation 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
shivered 11
perceptibly 11
the 11
white 11
wormyes 11
adam 11
noticed 11
that 11
from 11
now 11
on 11
his 11
friend 11
never 11
spoke 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
otherwise 11
except 11
when 11
he 11
wished 11
to 11
divert 11
the 11
suspicion 11
of 11
others 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
switched 11
off 11
the 11
electric 11
light 11
and 11
when 11
the 11
room 11
was 11
pitch 11
dark 11
he 11
came 11
to 11
adam 11
took 11
him 11
by 11
the 11
hand 11
and 11
led 11
him 11
to 11
a 11
seat 11
set 11
in 11
the 11
southern 11
window 11
then 11
he 11
softly 11
drew 11
back 11
a 11
piece 11
of 11
the 11
curtain 11
and 11
motioned 11
his 11
companion 11
to 11
look 11
out 11
adam 11
did 11
so 11
and 11
immediately 11
shrank 11
back 11
as 11
though 11
his 11
eyes 11
had 11
opened 11
on 11
pressing 11
danger 11
his 11
companion 11
set 11
his 11
mind 11
at 11
rest 11
by 11
saying 11
in 11
a 11
low 11
voice 11
it 11
is 11
all 11
right 11
you 11
may 11
speak 11
but 11
speak 11
low 11
there 11
is 11
no 11
danger 11
hereat 11
present 11
adam 11
leaned 11
forward 11
taking 11
care 11
however 11
not 11
to 11
press 11
his 11
face 11
against 11
the 11
glass 11
what 11
he 11
saw 11
would 11
not 11
under 11
ordinary 11
circumstances 11
have 11
caused 11
concern 11
to 11
anybody 11
with 11
his 11
special 11
knowledge 11
it 11
was 11
appallingthough 11
the 11
night 11
was 11
now 11
so 11
dark 11
that 11
in 11
reality 11
there 11
was 11
little 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
on 11
the 11
western 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
stood 11
a 11
grove 11
of 11
old 11
trees 11
of 11
forest 11
dimensions 11
they 11
were 11
not 11
grouped 11
closely 11
but 11
stood 11
a 11
little 11
apart 11
from 11
each 11
other 11
producing 11
the 11
effect 11
of 11
a 11
row 11
widely 11
planted 11
over 11
the 11
tops 11
of 11
them 11
was 11
seen 11
a 11
green 11
light 11
something 11
like 11
the 11
danger 11
signal 11
at 11
a 11
railwaycrossing 11
it 11
seemed 11
at 11
first 11
quite 11
still 11
but 11
presently 11
when 11
adams 11
eye 11
became 11
accustomed 11
to 11
it 11
he 11
could 11
see 11
that 11
it 11
moved 11
as 11
if 11
trembling 11
this 11
at 11
once 11
recalled 11
to 11
adams 11
mind 11
the 11
light 11
quivering 11
above 11
the 11
wellhole 11
in 11
the 11
darkness 11
of 11
that 11
inner 11
room 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
oolangas 11
awful 11
shriek 11
and 11
the 11
hideous 11
black 11
face 11
now 11
grown 11
grey 11
with 11
terror 11
disappearing 11
into 11
the 11
impenetrable 11
gloom 11
of 11
the 11
mysterious 11
orifice 11
instinctively 11
he 11
laid 11
his 11
hand 11
on 11
his 11
revolver 11
and 11
stood 11
up 11
ready 11
to 11
protect 11
his 11
wife 11
then 11
seeing 11
that 11
nothing 11
happened 11
and 11
that 11
the 11
light 11
and 11
all 11
outside 11
the 11
tower 11
remained 11
the 11
same 11
he 11
softly 11
pulled 11
the 11
curtain 11
over 11
the 11
window 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
switched 11
on 11
the 11
light 11
again 11
and 11
in 11
its 11
comforting 11
glow 11
they 11
began 11
to 11
talk 11
freely 11
chapter 11
xxiiat 11
close 11
quarters 11
she 11
has 11
diabolical 11
cunning 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
ever 11
since 11
you 11
left 11
she 11
has 11
ranged 11
along 11
the 11
brow 11
and 11
wherever 11
you 11
were 11
accustomed 11
to 11
frequent 11
i 11
have 11
not 11
heard 11
whence 11
the 11
knowledge 11
of 11
your 11
movements 11
came 11
to 11
her 11
nor 11
have 11
i 11
been 11
able 11
to 11
learn 11
any 11
data 11
whereon 11
to 11
found 11
an 11
opinion 11
she 11
seems 11
to 11
have 11
heard 11
both 11
of 11
your 11
marriage 11
and 11
your 11
absence 11
but 11
i 11
gather 11
by 11
inference 11
that 11
she 11
does 11
not 11
actually 11
know 11
where 11
you 11
and 11
mimi 11
are 11
or 11
of 11
your 11
return 11
so 11
soon 11
as 11
the 11
dusk 11
fails 11
she 11
goes 11
out 11
on 11
her 11
rounds 11
and 11
before 11
dawn 11
covers 11
the 11
whole 11
ground 11
round 11
the 11
brow 11
and 11
away 11
up 11
into 11
the 11
heart 11
of 11
the 11
peak 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
in 11
her 11
own 11
proper 11
shape 11
certainly 11
has 11
great 11
facilities 11
for 11
the 11
business 11
on 11
which 11
she 11
is 11
now 11
engaged 11
she 11
can 11
look 11
into 11
windows 11
of 11
any 11
ordinary 11
kind 11
happily 11
this 11
house 11
is 11
beyond 11
her 11
reach 11
if 11
she 11
wishesas 11
she 11
manifestly 11
doesto 11
remain 11
unrecognised 11
but 11
even 11
at 11
this 11
height 11
it 11
is 11
wise 11
to 11
show 11
no 11
lights 11
lest 11
she 11
might 11
learn 11
something 11
of 11
our 11
presence 11
or 11
absence 11
would 11
it 11
not 11
be 11
well 11
sir 11
if 11
one 11
of 11
us 11
could 11
see 11
this 11
monster 11
in 11
her 11
real 11
shape 11
at 11
close 11
quarters 11
i 11
am 11
willing 11
to 11
run 11
the 11
riskfor 11
i 11
take 11
it 11
there 11
would 11
be 11
no 11
slight 11
risk 11
in 11
the 11
doing 11
i 11
dont 11
suppose 11
anyone 11
of 11
our 11
time 11
has 11
seen 11
her 11
close 11
and 11
lived 11
to 11
tell 11
the 11
tale 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
held 11
up 11
an 11
expostulatory 11
hand 11
good 11
god 11
lad 11
what 11
are 11
you 11
suggesting 11
think 11
of 11
your 11
wife 11
and 11
all 11
that 11
is 11
at 11
stake 11
it 11
is 11
of 11
mimi 11
that 11
i 11
thinkfor 11
her 11
sake 11
that 11
i 11
am 11
willing 11
to 11
risk 11
whatever 11
is 11
to 11
be 11
risked 11
adams 11
young 11
bride 11
was 11
proud 11
of 11
her 11
man 11
but 11
she 11
blanched 11
at 11
the 11
thought 11
of 11
the 11
ghastly 11
white 11
worm 11
adam 11
saw 11
this 11
and 11
at 11
once 11
reassured 11
her 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
her 11
ladyship 11
does 11
not 11
know 11
whereabout 11
i 11
am 11
i 11
shall 11
have 11
as 11
much 11
safety 11
as 11
remains 11
to 11
us 11
bear 11
in 11
mind 11
my 11
darling 11
that 11
we 11
cannot 11
be 11
too 11
careful 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
realised 11
that 11
adam 11
was 11
right 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
had 11
no 11
supernatural 11
powers 11
and 11
could 11
not 11
harm 11
them 11
until 11
she 11
discovered 11
their 11
hiding 11
place 11
it 11
was 11
agreed 11
therefore 11
that 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
should 11
go 11
together 11
when 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
slipped 11
out 11
by 11
the 11
back 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
they 11
walked 11
cautiously 11
along 11
the 11
avenue 11
which 11
trended 11
towards 11
the 11
west 11
everything 11
was 11
pitch 11
darkso 11
dark 11
that 11
at 11
times 11
they 11
had 11
to 11
feel 11
their 11
way 11
by 11
the 11
palings 11
and 11
treetrunks 11
they 11
could 11
still 11
see 11
seemingly 11
far 11
in 11
front 11
of 11
them 11
and 11
high 11
up 11
the 11
baleful 11
light 11
which 11
at 11
the 11
height 11
and 11
distance 11
seemed 11
like 11
a 11
faint 11
line 11
as 11
they 11
were 11
now 11
on 11
the 11
level 11
of 11
the 11
ground 11
the 11
light 11
seemed 11
infinitely 11
higher 11
than 11
it 11
had 11
from 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
at 11
the 11
sight 11
adams 11
heart 11
fell 11
the 11
danger 11
of 11
the 11
desperate 11
enterprise 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
undertaken 11
burst 11
upon 11
him 11
but 11
this 11
feeling 11
was 11
shortly 11
followed 11
by 11
another 11
which 11
restored 11
him 11
to 11
himselfa 11
fierce 11
loathing 11
and 11
a 11
desire 11
to 11
kill 11
such 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
never 11
experienced 11
before 11
they 11
went 11
on 11
for 11
some 11
distance 11
on 11
a 11
level 11
road 11
fairly 11
wide 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
green 11
light 11
was 11
visible 11
here 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
spoke 11
softly 11
placing 11
his 11
lips 11
to 11
adams 11
ear 11
for 11
safety 11
we 11
know 11
nothing 11
whatever 11
of 11
this 11
creatures 11
power 11
of 11
hearing 11
or 11
smelling 11
though 11
i 11
presume 11
that 11
both 11
are 11
of 11
no 11
great 11
strength 11
as 11
to 11
seeing 11
we 11
may 11
presume 11
the 11
opposite 11
but 11
in 11
any 11
case 11
we 11
must 11
try 11
to 11
keep 11
in 11
the 11
shade 11
behind 11
the 11
treetrunks 11
the 11
slightest 11
error 11
would 11
be 11
fatal 11
to 11
us 11
adam 11
only 11
nodded 11
in 11
case 11
there 11
should 11
be 11
any 11
chance 11
of 11
the 11
monster 11
seeing 11
the 11
movement 11
after 11
a 11
time 11
that 11
seemed 11
interminable 11
they 11
emerged 11
from 11
the 11
circling 11
wood 11
it 11
was 11
like 11
coming 11
out 11
into 11
sunlight 11
by 11
comparison 11
with 11
the 11
misty 11
blackness 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
around 11
them 11
there 11
was 11
light 11
enough 11
to 11
see 11
by 11
though 11
not 11
sufficient 11
to 11
distinguish 11
things 11
at 11
a 11
distance 11
adams 11
eyes 11
sought 11
the 11
green 11
light 11
in 11
the 11
sky 11
it 11
was 11
still 11
in 11
about 11
the 11
same 11
place 11
but 11
its 11
surroundings 11
were 11
more 11
visible 11
it 11
was 11
now 11
at 11
the 11
summit 11
of 11
what 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
long 11
white 11
pole 11
near 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
which 11
were 11
two 11
pendant 11
white 11
masses 11
like 11
rudimentary 11
arms 11
or 11
fins 11
the 11
green 11
light 11
strangely 11
enough 11
did 11
not 11
seem 11
lessened 11
by 11
the 11
surrounding 11
starlight 11
but 11
had 11
a 11
clearer 11
effect 11
and 11
a 11
deeper 11
green 11
whilst 11
they 11
were 11
carefully 11
regarding 11
thisadam 11
with 11
the 11
aid 11
of 11
an 11
operaglasstheir 11
nostrils 11
were 11
assailed 11
by 11
a 11
horrid 11
stench 11
something 11
like 11
that 11
which 11
rose 11
from 11
the 11
wellhole 11
in 11
dianas 11
grove 11
by 11
degrees 11
as 11
their 11
eyes 11
got 11
the 11
right 11
focus 11
they 11
saw 11
an 11
immense 11
towering 11
mass 11
that 11
seemed 11
snowy 11
white 11
it 11
was 11
tall 11
and 11
thin 11
the 11
lower 11
part 11
was 11
hidden 11
by 11
the 11
trees 11
which 11
lay 11
between 11
but 11
they 11
could 11
follow 11
the 11
tall 11
white 11
shaft 11
and 11
the 11
duplicate 11
green 11
lights 11
which 11
topped 11
it 11
as 11
they 11
looked 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
movementthe 11
shaft 11
seemed 11
to 11
bend 11
and 11
the 11
line 11
of 11
green 11
light 11
descended 11
amongst 11
the 11
trees 11
they 11
could 11
see 11
the 11
green 11
light 11
twinkle 11
as 11
it 11
passed 11
between 11
the 11
obstructing 11
branches 11
seeing 11
where 11
the 11
head 11
of 11
the 11
monster 11
was 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
ventured 11
a 11
little 11
further 11
forward 11
and 11
saw 11
that 11
the 11
hidden 11
mass 11
at 11
the 11
base 11
of 11
the 11
shaft 11
was 11
composed 11
of 11
vast 11
coils 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
serpents 11
body 11
forming 11
a 11
base 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
upright 11
mass 11
rose 11
as 11
they 11
looked 11
this 11
lower 11
mass 11
moved 11
the 11
glistening 11
folds 11
catching 11
the 11
moonlight 11
and 11
they 11
could 11
see 11
that 11
the 11
monsters 11
progress 11
was 11
along 11
the 11
ground 11
it 11
was 11
coming 11
towards 11
them 11
at 11
a 11
swift 11
pace 11
so 11
they 11
turned 11
and 11
ran 11
taking 11
care 11
to 11
make 11
as 11
little 11
noise 11
as 11
possible 11
either 11
by 11
their 11
footfalls 11
or 11
by 11
disturbing 11
the 11
undergrowth 11
close 11
to 11
them 11
they 11
did 11
not 11
stop 11
or 11
pause 11
till 11
they 11
saw 11
before 11
them 11

high 11
dark 11

sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
in 11
the 11
library 11
next 11
morning 11
after 11
breakfast 11
when 11
adam 11
came 11
to 11
him 11
carrying 11
a 11
letter 11
her 11
ladyship 11
doesnt 11
lose 11
any 11
time 11
she 11
has 11
begun 11
work 11
already 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
who 11
was 11
writing 11
at 11
a 11
table 11
near 11
the 11
window 11
looked 11
up 11
what 11
is 11
it 11
said 11
he 11
adam 11
held 11
out 11
the 11
letter 11
he 11
was 11
carrying 11
it 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
blazoned 11
envelope 11
ha 11
said 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
from 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
i 11
expected 11
something 11
of 11
the 11
kind 11
but 11
said 11
adam 11
how 11
could 11
she 11
have 11
known 11
we 11
were 11
here 11
she 11
didnt 11
know 11
last 11
night 11
i 11
dont 11
think 11
we 11
need 11
trouble 11
about 11
that 11
adam 11
there 11
is 11
so 11
much 11
we 11
do 11
not 11
understand 11
this 11
is 11
only 11
another 11
mystery 11
suffice 11
it 11
that 11
she 11
does 11
knowperhaps 11
it 11
is 11
all 11
the 11
better 11
and 11
safer 11
for 11
us 11
how 11
is 11
that 11
asked 11
adam 11
with 11
a 11
puzzled 11
look 11
general 11
process 11
of 11
reasoning 11
my 11
boy 11
and 11
the 11
experience 11
of 11
some 11
years 11
in 11
the 11
diplomatic 11
world 11
this 11
creature 11
is 11
a 11
monster 11
without 11
heart 11
or 11
consideration 11
for 11
anything 11
or 11
anyone 11
she 11
is 11
not 11
nearly 11
so 11
dangerous 11
in 11
the 11
open 11
as 11
when 11
she 11
has 11
the 11
dark 11
to 11
protect 11
her 11
besides 11
we 11
know 11
by 11
our 11
own 11
experience 11
of 11
her 11
movements 11
that 11
for 11
some 11
reason 11
she 11
shuns 11
publicity 11
in 11
spite 11
of 11
her 11
vast 11
bulk 11
and 11
abnormal 11
strength 11
she 11
is 11
afraid 11
to 11
attack 11
openly 11
after 11
all 11
she 11
is 11
only 11
a 11
snake 11
and 11
with 11
a 11
snakes 11
nature 11
which 11
is 11
to 11
keep 11
low 11
and 11
squirm 11
and 11
proceed 11
by 11
stealth 11
and 11
cunning 11
she 11
will 11
never 11
attack 11
when 11
she 11
can 11
run 11
away 11
although 11
she 11
knows 11
well 11
that 11
running 11
away 11
would 11
probably 11
be 11
fatal 11
to 11
her 11
what 11
is 11
the 11
letter 11
about 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
voice 11
was 11
calm 11
and 11
selfpossessed 11
when 11
he 11
was 11
engaged 11
in 11
any 11
struggle 11
of 11
wits 11
he 11
was 11
all 11
diplomatist 11
she 11
asks 11
mimi 11
and 11
me 11
to 11
tea 11
this 11
afternoon 11
at 11
dianas 11

and 11
hopes 11
that 11
you 11
also 11
will 11
favour 11
her 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
smiled 11
please 11
ask 11
mrs 11
salton 11
to 11
accept 11
for 11
us 11
all 11
she 11
means 11
some 11
deadly 11
mischief 11
surelysurely 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
wiser 11
not 11
it 11
is 11
an 11
old 11
trick 11
that 11
we 11
learn 11
early 11
in 11
diplomacy 11
adamto 11
fight 11
on 11
ground 11
of 11
your 11
own 11
choice 11
it 11
is 11
true 11
that 11
she 11
suggested 11
the 11
place 11
on 11
this 11
occasion 11
but 11
by 11
accepting 11
it 11
we 11
make 11
it 11
ours 11
moreover 11
she 11
will 11
not 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
understand 11
our 11
reason 11
for 11
doing 11
so 11
and 11
her 11
own 11
bad 11

she 11
has 11
any 11
bad 11
or 11
goodand 11
her 11
own 11
fears 11
and 11
doubts 11
will 11
play 11

game 11
for 11

no 11
my 11
dear 11
boy 11
let 11
us 11
accept 11
by 11
all 11

adam 11
said 11
nothing 11
but 11
silently 11
held 11
out 11
his 11
hand 11
which 11
his 11
companion 11
shook 11
no 11
words 11
were 11
necessary 11
when 11
it 11
was 11
getting 11
near 11
teatime 11
mimi 11
asked 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
how 11
they 11
were 11
going 11
we 11
must 11
make 11
a 11
point 11
of 11
going 11
in 11
state 11
we 11
want 11
all 11
possible 11
publicity 11
mimi 11
looked 11
at 11
him 11
inquiringly 11
certainly 11
my 11
dear 11
in 11
the 11
present 11
circumstances 11
publicity 11
is 11
a 11
part 11
of 11
safety 11
do 11
not 11
be 11
surprised 11
if 11
whilst 11
we 11

the 11
next 11
couple 11
of 11
hours 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
voice 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
seriousness 11
and 11
it 11
brought 11
to 11
mimi 11
in 11
a 11
convincing 11
way 11
the 11
awful 11
gravity 11
of 11
the 11
occasion 11
in 11
due 11
course 11
they 11
set 11
out 11
in 11
a 11
carriage 11
drawn 11
by 11
a 11
fine 11
pair 11
of 11
horses 11
who 11
soon 11
devoured 11
the 11
few 11
miles 11
of 11
their 11
journey 11
before 11
they 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
gate 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
turned 11
to 11
mimi 11
i 11
have 11
arranged 11
with 11
adam 11
certain 11
signals 11
which 11
may 11
be 11
necessary 11
if 11
certain 11
eventualities 11
occur 11
these 11
need 11
be 11
nothing 11
to 11
do 11
with 11
you 11
directly 11
but 11
bear 11
in 11
mind 11
that 11
if 11
i 11
ask 11
you 11
or 11
adam 11
to 11
do 11
anything 11
do 11
not 11
lose 11
a 11
second 11
in 11
the 11
doing 11
of 11
it 11
we 11
must 11
try 11
to 11
pass 11
off 11
such 11
moments 11
with 11
an 11
appearance 11
of 11
unconcern 11
in 11
all 11
probability 11
nothing 11
requiring 11
such 11
care 11
will 11
occur 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
will 11
not 11
try 11
force 11
though 11
she 11
has 11
so 11
much 11
of 11
it 11
to 11
spare 11
whatever 11
she 11
may 11
attempt 11
today 11
of 11
harm 11
to 11
any 11
of 11
us 11

secret 11

some 11
other 11
time 11
she 11
may 11
try 11

butif 11
i 11
am 11
able 11
to 11
judge 11
such 11
a 11
thingnot 11
today 11
the 11
messengers 11
who 11
may 11
ask 11
for 11
any 11

they 11
may 11
help 11
to 11
stave 11
off 11
danger 11
seeing 11
query 11
in 11
her 11
face 11
he 11
went 11
on 11
of 11
what 11
kind 11
the 11
danger 11
may 11
be 11
i 11
know 11
not 11
and 11
cannot 11
guess 11
it 11
will 11
doubtless 11
be 11
some 11
ordinary 11
circumstance 11
but 11
none 11
the 11
less 11
dangerous 11
on 11
that 11
account 11
here 11
we 11
are 11
at 11
the 11
gate 11
now 11
be 11
careful 11
in 11
all 11
matters 11
however 11
small 11
to 11
keep 11
your 11
head 11
is 11
half 11
the 11
battle 11
there 11
were 11
a 11
number 11
of 11
men 11
in 11
livery 11
in 11
the 11
hall 11
when 11
they 11
arrived 11
the 11
doors 11
of 11
the 11
drawingroom 11
were 11
thrown 11
open 11
and 11
lady 11
arabella 11
came 11
forth 11
and 11
offered 11
them 11
cordial 11
welcome 11
this 11
having 11
been 11
got 11
over 11
lady 11
arabella 11
led 11
them 11
into 11
another 11
room 11
where 11
tea 11
was 11
served 11
adam 11
was 11
acutely 11
watchful 11
and 11
suspicious 11
of 11
everything 11
and 11
saw 11
on 11
the 11
far 11
side 11
of 11
this 11
room 11
a 11
panelled 11
iron 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
same 11
colour 11
and 11
configuration 11
as 11
the 11
outer 11
door 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
where 11
was 11
the 11
well 11
hole 11
wherein 11
oolanga 11
had 11
disappeared 11
something 11
in 11
the 11
sight 11
alarmed 11
him 11
and 11
he 11
quietly 11
stood 11
near 11
the 11
door 11
he 11
made 11
no 11
movement 11
even 11
of 11
his 11
eyes 11
but 11
he 11
could 11
see 11
that 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
was 11
watching 11
him 11
intently 11
and 11
he 11
fancied 11
with 11
approval 11
they 11
all 11
sat 11
near 11
the 11
table 11
spread 11
for 11
tea 11
adam 11
still 11
near 11
the 11
door 11
lady 11
arabella 11
fanned 11
herself 11
complaining 11
of 11
heat 11
and 11
told 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
footmen 11
to 11
throw 11
all 11
the 11
outer 11
doors 11
open 11
tea 11
was 11
in 11
progress 11
when 11
mimi 11
suddenly 11
started 11
up 11
with 11
a 11
look 11
of 11
fright 11
on 11
her 11
face 11
at 11
the 11
same 11
moment 11
the 11
men 11
became 11
cognisant 11
of 11
a 11
thick 11
smoke 11
which 11
began 11
to 11
spread 11
through 11
the 11
rooma 11
smoke 11
which 11
made 11
those 11
who 11
experienced 11
it 11
gasp 11
and 11
choke 11
the 11
footmen 11
began 11
to 11
edge 11
uneasily 11
towards 11
the 11
inner 11
door 11
denser 11
and 11
denser 11
grew 11
the 11
smoke 11
and 11
more 11
acrid 11
its 11
smell 11
mimi 11
towards 11
whom 11
the 11
draught 11
from 11
the 11
open 11
door 11
wafted 11
the 11
smoke 11
rose 11
up 11
choking 11
and 11
ran 11
to 11
the 11
inner 11
door 11
which 11
she 11
threw 11
open 11
to 11
its 11
fullest 11
extent 11
disclosing 11
on 11
the 11
outside 11
a 11
curtain 11
of 11
thin 11
silk 11
fixed 11
to 11
the 11
doorposts 11
the 11
draught 11
from 11
the 11
open 11
door 11
swayed 11
the 11
thin 11
silk 11
towards 11
her 11
and 11
in 11
her 11
fright 11
she 11
tore 11
down 11
the 11
curtain 11
which 11
enveloped 11
her 11
from 11
head 11
to 11
foot 11
then 11
she 11
ran 11
through 11
the 11
still 11
open 11
door 11
heedless 11
of 11
the 11
fact 11
that 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
where 11
she 11
was 11
going 11
adam 11
followed 11
by 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
rushed 11
forward 11
and 11
joined 11
heradam 11
catching 11
his 11
wife 11
by 11
the 11
arm 11
and 11
holding 11
her 11
tight 11
it 11
was 11
well 11
that 11
he 11
did 11
so 11
for 11
just 11
before 11
her 11
lay 11
the 11
black 11
orifice 11
of 11
the 11
wellhole 11
which 11
of 11
course 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
with 11
the 11
silk 11
curtain 11
round 11
her 11
head 11
the 11
floor 11
was 11
extremely 11
slippery 11
something 11
like 11
thick 11
oil 11
had 11
been 11
spilled 11
where 11
she 11
had 11
to 11
pass 11
and 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
edge 11
of 11
the 11
hole 11
her 11
feet 11
shot 11
from 11
under 11
her 11
and 11
she 11
stumbled 11
forward 11
towards 11
the 11
well 11
hole 11
when 11
adam 11
saw 11
mimi 11
slip 11
he 11
flung 11
himself 11
backward 11
still 11
holding 11
her 11
his 11
weight 11
told 11
and 11
he 11
dragged 11
her 11
up 11
from 11
the 11
hole 11
and 11
they 11
fell 11
together 11
on 11
the 11
floor 11
outside 11
the 11
zone 11
of 11
slipperiness 11
in 11
a 11
moment 11
he 11
had 11
raised 11
her 11
up 11
and 11
together 11
they 11
rushed 11
out 11
through 11
the 11
open 11
door 11
into 11
the 11
sunlight 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
close 11
behind 11
them 11
they 11
were 11
all 11
pale 11
except 11
the 11
old 11
diplomatist 11
who 11
looked 11
both 11
calm 11
and 11
cool 11
it 11
sustained 11
and 11
cheered 11
adam 11
and 11
his 11
wife 11
to 11
see 11
him 11
thus 11
master 11
of 11
himself 11
both 11
managed 11
to 11
follow 11
his 11
example 11
to 11
the 11
wonderment 11
of 11
the 11
footmen 11
who 11
saw 11
the 11
three 11
who 11
had 11
just 11
escaped 11
a 11
terrible 11
danger 11
walking 11
together 11
gaily 11
as 11
under 11
the 11
guiding 11
pressure 11
of 11
sir 11
nathaniels 11
hand 11
they 11
turned 11
to 11
reenter 11
the 11
house 11
lady 11
arabella 11
whose 11
face 11
had 11
blanched 11
to 11
a 11
deadly 11
white 11
now 11
resumed 11
her 11
ministrations 11
at 11
the 11
teaboard 11
as 11
though 11
nothing 11
unusual 11
had 11
happened 11
the 11
slopbasin 11
was 11
full 11
of 11
halfburned 11
brown 11
paper 11
over 11
which 11
tea 11
had 11
been 11
poured 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
been 11
narrowly 11
observing 11
his 11
hostess 11
and 11
took 11
the 11
first 11
opportunity 11
afforded 11
him 11
of 11
whispering 11
to 11
adam 11
the 11
real 11
attack 11
is 11
to 11
comeshe 11
is 11
too 11
quiet 11
when 11

give 11
my 11
hand 11
to 11
your 11
wife 11
to 11
lead 11

with 11
usand 11
caution 11
her 11
to 11
hurry 11
dont 11
lose 11
a 11
second 11
even 11
if 11
you 11
have 11
to 11
make 11
a 11
scene 11
hs 11
ssh 11
then 11
they 11
resumed 11
their 11
places 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
table 11
and 11
the 11
servants 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
order 11
brought 11
in 11
fresh 11
tea 11
thence 11
on 11
that 11
teaparty 11
seemed 11
to 11
adam 11
whose 11
faculties 11
were 11
at 11
their 11
utmost 11
intensity 11
like 11
a 11
terrible 11
dream 11
as 11
for 11
poor 11
mimi 11
she 11
was 11
so 11
overwrought 11
both 11
with 11
present 11
and 11
future 11
fear 11
and 11
with 11
horror 11
at 11
the 11
danger 11
she 11
had 11
escaped 11
that 11
her 11
faculties 11
were 11
numb 11
however 11
she 11
was 11
braced 11
up 11
for 11
a 11
trial 11
and 11
she 11
felt 11
assured 11
that 11
whatever 11
might 11
come 11
she 11
would 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
go 11
through 11
with 11
it 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
seemed 11
just 11
as 11
usualsuave 11
dignified 11
and 11
thoughtful 11
perfect 11
master 11
of 11
himself 11
to 11
her 11
husband 11
it 11
was 11
evident 11
that 11
mimi 11
was 11
ill 11
at 11
ease 11
the 11
way 11
she 11
kept 11
turning 11
her 11
head 11
to 11
look 11
around 11
her 11
the 11
quick 11
coming 11
and 11
going 11
of 11
the 11
colour 11
of 11
her 11
face 11
her 11
hurried 11
breathing 11
alternating 11
with 11
periods 11
of 11
suspicious 11
calm 11
were 11
evidences 11
of 11
mental 11
perturbation 11
to 11
her 11
the 11
attitude 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
seemed 11
compounded 11
of 11
social 11
sweetness 11
and 11
personal 11
consideration 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
hard 11
to 11
imagine 11
more 11
thoughtful 11
and 11
tender 11
kindness 11
towards 11
an 11
honoured 11
guest 11
when 11
tea 11
was 11
over 11
and 11
the 11
servants 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
clear 11
away 11
the 11
cups 11
lady 11
arabella 11
putting 11
her 11
arm 11
round 11
mimis 11
waist 11
strolled 11
with 11
her 11
into 11
an 11
adjoining 11
room 11
where 11
she 11
collected 11
a 11
number 11
of 11
photographs 11
which 11
were 11
scattered 11
about 11
and 11
sitting 11
down 11
beside 11
her 11
guest 11
began 11
to 11
show 11
them 11
to 11
her 11
while 11
she 11
was 11
doing 11
this 11
the 11
servants 11
closed 11
all 11
the 11
doors 11
of 11
the 11
suite 11
of 11
rooms 11

into 11
the 11

suddenly 11
without 11
any 11
seeming 11
cause 11
the 11
light 11
in 11
the 11

sir 11
nathaniel 11
who 11
was 11
sitting 11
close 11
to 11
mimi 11
rose 11
to 11
his 11
feet 11
and 11
crying 11
quick 11
caught 11
hold 11
of 11
her 11
hand 11
and 11
began 11
to 11
drag 11
her 11
from 11
the 11
room 11
adam 11
caught 11
her 11
other 11
hand 11
and 11
between 11
them 11
they 11
drew 11
her 11
through 11
the 11
outer 11
door 11
which 11
the 11
servants 11
were 11
beginning 11
to 11
close 11
it 11
was 11
difficult 11
at 11
first 11
to 11
find 11
the 11
way 11
the 11
darkness 11
was 11
so 11
great 11
but 11
to 11
their 11
relief 11
when 11
adam 11
whistled 11
shrilly 11
the 11
carriage 11
and 11
horses 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
waiting 11
in 11
the 11
angle 11
of 11
the 11
avenue 11
dashed 11
up 11

and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11

into 11
the 11
carriage 11
the 11
postillion 11
plied 11
whip 11
and 11
spur 11
and 11
the 11
vehicle 11
rocking 11
with 11
its 11
speed 11
swept 11
through 11
the 11
gate 11
and 11
tore 11
up 11
the 11
road 11
behind 11
them 11
was 11
a 11
hubbub 11
servants 11
rushing 11
about 11
orders 11
being 11
shouted 11
out 11
doors 11
shutting 11
and 11
somewhere 11
seemingly 11
far 11
back 11
in 11
the 11
house 11
a 11
strange 11
noise 11
every 11
nerve 11
of 11
the 11
horses 11
was 11
strained 11
as 11
they 11
dashed 11
recklessly 11
along 11
the 11
road 11
the 11
two 11
men 11
held 11
mimi 11
between 11
them 11
the 11
arms 11
of 11
both 11
of 11
them 11
round 11
her 11
as 11
though 11
protectingly 11
as 11
they 11
went 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
sudden 11
rise 11
in 11
the 11
ground 11
but 11
the 11
horses 11
breathing 11
heavily 11
dashed 11
up 11
it 11
at 11
racing 11
speed 11
not 11
slackening 11
their 11
pace 11
when 11
the 11
hill 11
fell 11
away 11
again 11
leaving 11
them 11
to 11
hurry 11
along 11
the 11
downgrade 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
foolish 11
to 11
say 11
that 11
neither 11
adam 11
nor 11
mimi 11
had 11
any 11
fear 11
in 11
returning 11
to 11
doom 11
tower 11
mimi 11
felt 11
it 11
more 11
keenly 11
than 11
her 11
husband 11
whose 11
nerves 11
were 11
harder 11
and 11
who 11
was 11
more 11
inured 11
to 11
danger 11
still 11
she 11
bore 11
up 11
bravely 11
and 11
as 11
usual 11
the 11
effort 11
was 11
helpful 11
to 11
her 11
when 11
once 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
the 11
study 11
in 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
she 11
almost 11
forgot 11
the 11
terrors 11
which 11
lay 11
outside 11
in 11
the 11
dark 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
attempt 11
to 11
peep 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
window 11
but 11
adam 11
didand 11
saw 11
nothing 11
the 11
moonlight 11
showed 11
all 11
the 11
surrounding 11
country 11
but 11
nowhere 11
was 11
to 11
be 11
observed 11
that 11
tremulous 11
line 11
of 11
green 11
light 11
the 11
peaceful 11
night 11
had 11
a 11
good 11
effect 11
on 11
them 11
all 11
danger 11
being 11
unseen 11
seemed 11
far 11
off 11
at 11
times 11
it 11
was 11
hard 11
to 11
realise 11
that 11
it 11
had 11
ever 11
been 11
with 11
courage 11
restored 11
adam 11
rose 11
early 11
and 11
walked 11
along 11
the 11
brow 11
seeing 11
no 11
change 11
in 11
the 11
signs 11
of 11
life 11
in 11
castra 11
regis 11
what 11
he 11
did 11
see 11
to 11
his 11
wonder 11
and 11
concern 11
on 11
his 11
returning 11
homeward 11
was 11
lady 11
arabella 11
in 11
her 11
tightfitting 11
white 11
dress 11
and 11
ermine 11
collar 11
but 11
without 11
her 11
emeralds 11
she 11
was 11
emerging 11
from 11
the 11
gate 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
and 11
walking 11
towards 11
the 11
castle 11
pondering 11
on 11
this 11
and 11
trying 11
to 11
find 11
some 11
meaning 11
in 11
it 11
occupied 11
his 11
thoughts 11
till 11
he 11
joined 11
mimi 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
at 11
breakfast 11
they 11
began 11
the 11
meal 11
in 11
silence 11
what 11
had 11
been 11
had 11
been 11
and 11
was 11
known 11
to 11
them 11
all 11
moreover 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
a 11
pleasant 11
topic 11
a 11
fillip 11
was 11
given 11
to 11
the 11
conversation 11
when 11
adam 11
told 11
of 11
his 11
seeing 11
lady 11
arabella 11
on 11
her 11
way 11
to 11
castra 11
regis 11
they 11
each 11
had 11
something 11
to 11
say 11
of 11
her 11
and 11
of 11
what 11
her 11
wishes 11
or 11
intentions 11
were 11
towards 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
mimi 11
spoke 11
bitterly 11
of 11
her 11
in 11
every 11
aspect 11
she 11
had 11
not 11
forgottenand 11
never 11
wouldnever 11
couldthe 11
occasion 11
when 11
to 11
harm 11
lilla 11
the 11
woman 11
had 11
consorted 11
even 11
with 11
the 11
nigger 11
as 11
a 11
social 11
matter 11
she 11
was 11
disgusted 11
with 11
her 11
for 11
following 11
up 11
the 11
rich 11
landownerthrowing 11
herself 11
at 11
his 11
head 11
so 11
shamelessly 11
was 11
how 11
she 11
expressed 11
it 11
she 11
was 11
interested 11
to 11
know 11
that 11
the 11
great 11
kite 11
still 11
flew 11
from 11
caswalls 11
tower 11
but 11
beyond 11
such 11
matters 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
try 11
to 11
go 11
the 11
only 11
comment 11
she 11
made 11
was 11
of 11
strongly 11
expressed 11
surprise 11
at 11
her 11
ladyships 11
cheek 11
in 11
ignoring 11
her 11
own 11
criminal 11
acts 11
and 11
her 11
impudence 11
in 11
taking 11
it 11
for 11
granted 11
that 11
others 11
had 11
overlooked 11
them 11
also 11
chapter 11
xxiva 11
startling 11
proposition 11
the 11
more 11
mimi 11
thought 11
over 11
the 11
late 11
events 11
the 11
more 11
puzzled 11
she 11
was 11
what 11
did 11
it 11
all 11
meanwhat 11
could 11
it 11
mean 11
except 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
an 11
error 11
of 11
fact 11
somewhere 11
could 11
it 11
be 11
possible 11
that 11
some 11
of 11
themall 11
of 11
them 11
had 11
been 11
mistaken 11
that 11
there 11
had 11
been 11
no 11
white 11
worm 11
at 11
all 11
on 11
either 11
side 11
of 11
her 11
was 11
a 11
belief 11
impossible 11
of 11
reception 11
not 11
to 11
believe 11
in 11
what 11
seemed 11
apparent 11
was 11
to 11
destroy 11
the 11
very 11
foundations 11
of 11
belief 11
yet 11
in 11
old 11
days 11
there 11
had 11
been 11
monsters 11
on 11
the 11
earth 11
and 11
certainly 11
some 11
people 11
had 11
believed 11
in 11
just 11
such 11
mysterious 11
changes 11
of 11
identity 11
it 11
was 11
all 11
very 11
strange 11
just 11
fancy 11
how 11
any 11
strangersay 11
a 11
doctorwould 11
regard 11
her 11
if 11
she 11
were 11
to 11
tell 11
him 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
to 11
a 11
teaparty 11
with 11
an 11
antediluvian 11
monster 11
and 11
that 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
waited 11
on 11
by 11
uptodate 11
menservants 11
adam 11
had 11
returned 11
exhilarated 11
by 11
his 11
walk 11
and 11
more 11
settled 11
in 11
his 11
mind 11
than 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
like 11
mimi 11
he 11
had 11
gone 11
through 11
the 11
phase 11
of 11
doubt 11
and 11
inability 11
to 11
believe 11
in 11
the 11
reality 11
of 11
things 11
though 11
it 11
had 11
not 11
affected 11
him 11
to 11
the 11
same 11
extent 11
the 11
idea 11
however 11
that 11
his 11
wife 11
was 11
suffering 11
illeffects 11
from 11
her 11
terrible 11
ordeal 11
braced 11
him 11
up 11
he 11
remained 11
with 11
her 11
for 11
a 11
time 11
then 11
he 11
sought 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
talk 11
over 11
the 11
matter 11
with 11
him 11
he 11
knew 11
that 11
the 11
calm 11
common 11
sense 11
and 11
selfreliance 11
of 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
his 11
experience 11
would 11
be 11
helpful 11
to 11
them 11
all 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
come 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
for 11
some 11
reason 11
which 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
understand 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
changed 11
her 11
plans 11
and 11
for 11
the 11
present 11
at 11
all 11
events 11
was 11
pacific 11
he 11
was 11
inclined 11
to 11
attribute 11
her 11
changed 11
demeanour 11
to 11
the 11
fact 11
that 11
her 11
influence 11
over 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
was 11
so 11
far 11
increased 11
as 11
to 11
justify 11
a 11
more 11
fixed 11
belief 11
in 11
his 11
submission 11
to 11
her 11
charms 11
as 11
a 11
matter 11
of 11
fact 11
she 11
had 11
seen 11
caswall 11
that 11
morning 11
when 11
she 11
visited 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
they 11
had 11
had 11
a 11
long 11
talk 11
together 11
during 11
which 11
the 11
possibility 11
of 11
their 11
union 11
had 11
been 11
discussed 11
caswall 11
without 11
being 11
enthusiastic 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
had 11
been 11
courteous 11
and 11
attentive 11
as 11
she 11
had 11
walked 11
back 11
to 11
dianas 11
grove 11
she 11
almost 11
congratulated 11
herself 11
on 11
her 11
new 11
settlement 11
in 11
life 11
that 11
the 11
idea 11
was 11
becoming 11
fixed 11
in 11
her 11
mind 11
was 11
shown 11
by 11
a 11
letter 11
which 11
she 11
wrote 11
later 11
in 11
the 11
day 11
to 11
adam 11
salton 11
and 11
sent 11
to 11

ran 11
as 11

matter 11
of 11

then 11
his 11
mind 11
being 11
made 11
up 11
he 11
went 11
to 11
mimi 11

asked 11
if 11
she 11
had 11
any 11
objection 11
she 11
answered 11
after 11
a 11
shudderthat 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
this 11
as 11
in 11
all 11
things 11
willing 11

salton 11
went 11
straight 11
to 11
the 11
study 11
in 11
the 11
tower 11
where 11
he 11
knew 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
would 11
be 11
at 11
that 11
hour 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
was 11
alone 11
so 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
entered 11
in 11
obedience 11
to 11
the 11
come 11
in 11
which 11
answered 11
his 11
query 11
he 11
closed 11
the 11
door 11
and 11
sat 11
down 11
beside 11
him 11
do 11
you 11
think 11
sir 11
that 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
well 11
for 11
me 11
to 11
buy 11
dianas 11
grove 11
god 11
bless 11
my 11
soul 11
said 11
the 11
old 11
man 11
startled 11
why 11
on 11
earth 11
would 11
you 11
want 11
to 11
do 11
that 11
well 11
i 11
have 11
vowed 11
to 11
destroy 11
that 11
white 11
worm 11
and 11
my 11
being 11
able 11
to 11
do 11
whatever 11
i 11
may 11
choose 11
with 11
the 11
lair 11
would 11
facilitate 11
matters 11
and 11
avoid 11
complications 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
hesitated 11
longer 11
than 11
usual 11
before 11
speaking 11
he 11
was 11
thinking 11
deeply 11
yes 11
adam 11
there 11
is 11
much 11
common 11
sense 11
in 11
your 11
suggestion 11
though 11
it 11
startled 11
me 11
at 11
first 11
i 11
think 11
that 11
for 11
all 11
reasons 11
you 11
would 11
do 11
well 11
to 11
buy 11
the 11
property 11
and 11
to 11
have 11
the 11
conveyance 11
settled 11
at 11
once 11
if 11
you 11
want 11
more 11
money 11
than 11
is 11
immediately 11
convenient 11
let 11
me 11
know 11
so 11
that 11
i 11
may 11
be 11
your 11
banker 11
thank 11
you 11
sir 11
most 11
heartily 11
but 11
i 11
have 11
more 11
money 11
at 11
immediate 11
call 11
than 11
i 11
shall 11
want 11
i 11
am 11
glad 11
you 11
approve 11
the 11
property 11
is 11
historic 11
and 11
as 11
time 11
goes 11
on 11
it 11
will 11
increase 11
in 11
value 11
moreover 11
i 11
may 11
tell 11
you 11
something 11
which 11
indeed 11
is 11
only 11
a 11
surmise 11
but 11
which 11
if 11
i 11
am 11
right 11
will 11
add 11
great 11
value 11
to 11
the 11
place 11
adam 11
listened 11
has 11
it 11
ever 11
struck 11
you 11
why 11
the 11
old 11
name 11
the 11
lair 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
was 11
given 11
we 11
know 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
snake 11
which 11
in 11
early 11
days 11
was 11
called 11
a 11
worm 11
but 11
why 11
white 11
i 11
really 11
dont 11
know 11
sir 11
i 11
never 11
thought 11
of 11
it 11
i 11
simply 11
took 11
it 11
for 11
granted 11
so 11
did 11
i 11
at 11
firstlong 11
ago 11
but 11
later 11
i 11
puzzled 11
my 11
brain 11
for 11
a 11
reason 11
and 11
what 11
was 11
the 11
reason 11
sir 11
simply 11
and 11
solely 11
because 11
the 11
snake 11
or 11
worm 11
was 11
white 11
we 11
are 11
near 11
the 11
county 11
of 11
stafford 11
where 11
the 11
great 11
industry 11
of 11
chinaburning 11
was 11
originated 11
and 11
grew 11
stafford 11
owes 11
much 11
of 11
its 11
wealth 11
to 11
the 11
large 11
deposits 11
of 11
the 11
rare 11
china 11
clay 11
found 11
in 11
it 11
from 11
time 11
to 11
time 11
these 11
deposits 11
become 11
in 11
time 11
pretty 11
well 11
exhausted 11
but 11
for 11
centuries 11
stafford 11
adventurers 11
looked 11
for 11
the 11
special 11
clay 11
as 11
ohio 11
and 11
pennsylvania 11
farmers 11
and 11
explorers 11
looked 11
for 11
oil 11
anyone 11
owning 11
real 11
estate 11
on 11
which 11
china 11
clay 11
can 11
be 11
discovered 11
strikes 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
gold 11
mine 11
yes 11
and 11
then 11
the 11
young 11
man 11
looked 11
puzzled 11
the 11
original 11
worm 11
socalled 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
name 11
of 11
the 11
place 11
came 11
had 11
to 11
find 11
a 11
direct 11
way 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
marshes 11
and 11
the 11
mud 11
holes 11
now 11
the 11
clay 11
is 11
easily 11
penetrable 11
and 11
the 11
original 11
hole 11
probably 11
pierced 11
a 11
bed 11
of 11
china 11
clay 11
when 11
once 11
the 11
way 11
was 11
made 11
it 11
would 11
become 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
highway 11
for 11
the 11
worm 11
but 11
as 11
much 11
movement 11
was 11
necessary 11
to 11
ascend 11
such 11
a 11
great 11
height 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
clay 11
would 11
become 11
attached 11
to 11
its 11
rough 11
skin 11
by 11
attrition 11
the 11
downway 11
must 11
have 11
been 11
easy 11
work 11
but 11
the 11
ascent 11
was 11
different 11
and 11
when 11
the 11
monster 11
came 11
to 11
view 11
in 11
the 11
upper 11
world 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
fresh 11
from 11
contact 11
with 11
the 11
white 11
clay 11
hence 11
the 11
name 11
which 11
has 11
no 11
cryptic 11
significance 11
but 11
only 11
fact 11
now 11
if 11
that 11
surmise 11
be 11
trueand 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
see 11
why 11
notthere 11
must 11
be 11
a 11

old 11
gentleman 11
i 11
have 11
it 11
in 11
my 11
bones 11
sir 11
that 11
you 11

struckor 11
rather 11
reasoned 11
outa 11
great 11
truth 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
went 11
on 11
cheerfully 11
when 11
the 11
world 11
of 11
commerce 11
wakes 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
value 11
of 11
your 11
find 11
it 11
will 11
be 11
as 11
well 11
that 11
your 11
title 11
to 11
ownership 11
has 11
been 11
perfectly 11
secured 11
if 11
anyone 11
ever 11
deserved 11
such 11

gain 11
it 11
is 11
you 11

friends 11
aid 11
adam 11
secured 11
the 11
property 11
without 11
loss 11
of 11
time 11
then 11
he 11
went 11
to 11
see 11
his 11
uncle 11
and 11
told 11
him 11
about 11
it 11
mr 11
salton 11
was 11
delighted 11
to 11
find 11
his 11
young 11
relative 11
already 11
constructively 11
the 11
owner 11
of 11
so 11
fine 11
an 11
estateone 11
which 11
gave 11
him 11
an 11
important 11
status 11
in 11
the 11
county 11
he 11
made 11
many 11
anxious 11
enquiries 11
about 11
mimi 11
and 11
the 11
doings 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
but 11
adam 11
reassured 11
him 11
the 11
next 11
morning 11
when 11
adam 11
went 11
to 11
his 11
host 11
in 11
the 11
smokingroom 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
asked 11
him 11
how 11
he 11
purposed 11
to 11
proceed 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
keeping 11
his 11
vow 11
it 11
is 11
a 11
difficult 11
matter 11
which 11
you 11
have 11
undertaken 11
to 11
destroy 11
such 11
a 11
monster 11
is 11
something 11
like 11
one 11
of 11
the 11
labours 11
of 11
hercules 11
in 11
that 11
not 11
only 11
its 11
size 11
and 11
weight 11
and 11
power 11
of 11
using 11
them 11
in 11
little 11
known 11
ways 11
are 11
against 11
you 11
but 11
the 11
occult 11
side 11
is 11
alone 11
an 11
unsurpassable 11
difficulty 11
the 11
worm 11
is 11
already 11
master 11
of 11
all 11
the 11

except 11
fireand 11
i 11
do 11
not 11
see 11
how 11
fire 11
can 11
be 11
used 11
for 11
the 11
attack 11
it 11
has 11
only 11
to 11
sink 11
into 11
the 11
earth 11
in 11
its 11
usual 11
way 11
and 11
you 11
could 11
not 11
overtake 11
it 11
if 11
you 11
had 11
the 11
resources 11
of 11
the 11
biggest 11
coalmine 11
in 11
existence 11
but 11
i 11
daresay 11
you 11
have 11
mapped 11
out 11
some 11
plan 11
in 11
your 11
mind 11
he 11
added 11
courteously 11
i 11
have 11
sir 11
but 11
of 11
course 11
it 11
may 11
not 11
stand 11
the 11
test 11
of 11
practice 11
may 11
i 11
know 11
the 11
idea 11
well 11
sir 11
this 11
was 11
my 11
argument 11
at 11
the 11
time 11
of 11
the 11
chartist 11
trouble 11
an 11
idea 11
spread 11
amongst 11
financial 11
circles 11
that 11
an 11
attack 11
was 11
going 11
to 11
be 11
made 11
on 11
the 11
bank 11
of 11
england 11
accordingly 11
the 11
directors 11
of 11
that 11
institution 11
consulted 11
many 11
persons 11
who 11
were 11
supposed 11
to 11
know 11
what 11
steps 11
should 11
be 11
taken 11
and 11
it 11
was 11
finally 11
decided 11
that 11
the 11
best 11
protection 11
against 11
firewhich 11
is 11
what 11
was 11
fearedwas 11
not 11
water 11
but 11
sand 11
to 11
carry 11
the 11
scheme 11
into 11
practice 11
great 11
store 11
of 11
fine 11

kind 11

blows 11
about 11

is 11

to 11
fill 11

was 11
provided 11
throughout 11
the 11
building 11
especially 11
at 11
the 11
points 11
liable 11
to 11
attack 11
from 11
which 11
it 11
could 11
be 11
brought 11
into 11
use 11
i 11
propose 11
to 11
provide 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
as 11
soon 11
as 11
it 11
comes 11
into 11
my 11
possession 11
an 11
enormous 11
amount 11
of 11
such 11
sand 11
and 11
shall 11
take 11
an 11
early 11
occasion 11
of 11
pouring 11
it 11
into 11
the 11
wellhole 11
which 11
it 11
will 11
in 11
time 11
choke 11
thus 11
lady 11
arabella 11
in 11
her 11
guise 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
will 11
find 11
herself 11
cut 11
off 11
from 11
her 11
refuge 11
the 11
hole 11
is 11
a 11
narrow 11
one 11
and 11
is 11
some 11
hundreds 11
of 11
feet 11
deep 11
the 11
weight 11
of 11
the 11
sand 11
this 11
can 11
contain 11
would 11
not 11
in 11
itself 11
be 11
sufficient 11
to 11
obstruct 11
but 11
the 11
friction 11
of 11
such 11
a 11
body 11
working 11
up 11
against 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
tremendous 11
one 11
moment 11
what 11
use 11
would 11
the 11
sand 11
be 11
for 11
destruction 11
none 11
directly 11
but 11
it 11
would 11
hold 11
the 11
struggling 11
body 11
in 11
place 11
till 11
the 11
rest 11
of 11
my 11
scheme 11
came 11
into 11
practice 11
and 11
what 11
is 11
the 11
rest 11
as 11
the 11
sand 11
is 11
being 11
poured 11
into 11
the 11
wellhole 11
quantities 11
of 11
dynamite 11
can 11
also 11
be 11
thrown 11
in 11
good 11
but 11
how 11
would 11
the 11
dynamite 11
explodefor 11
of 11
course 11
that 11
is 11
what 11
you 11
intend 11
would 11
not 11
some 11
sort 11
of 11
wire 11
or 11
fuse 11
he 11
required 11
for 11
each 11
parcel 11
of 11

adam 11
smiled 11
not 11
in 11
these 11
days 11
sir 11
that 11
was 11
proved 11
in 11
new 11

a 11
thousand 11
pounds 11
of 11
dynamite 11
in 11
sealed 11
canisters 11
was 11
placed 11
about 11
some 11
workings 11
at 11
the 11
last 11
a 11
charge 11
of 11
gunpowder 11
was 11
fired 11
and 11
the 11
concussion 11
exploded 11
the 11
dynamite 11
it 11
was 11
most 11
successful 11
those 11
who 11
were 11
nonexperts 11
in 11
high 11
explosives 11
expected 11
that 11
every 11
pane 11
of 11
glass 11
in 11
new 11
york 11
would 11
be 11
shattered 11
but 11
in 11
reality 11
the 11
explosive 11
did 11
no 11
harm 11
outside 11
the 11
area 11
intended 11
although 11
sixteen 11
acres 11
of 11
rock 11
had 11
been 11
mined 11
and 11
only 11
the 11
supporting 11
walls 11
and 11
pillars 11
had 11
been 11
left 11
intact 11
the 11
whole 11
of 11
the 11
rocks 11
were 11
shattered 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
nodded 11
approval 11
that 11
seems 11
a 11
good 11
plana 11
very 11
excellent 11
one 11
but 11
if 11
it 11
has 11
to 11
tear 11
down 11
so 11
many 11
feet 11
of 11
precipice 11
it 11
may 11
wreck 11
the 11
whole 11
neighbourhood 11
and 11
free 11
it 11
for 11
ever 11
from 11
a 11
monster 11

adam 11

hurry 11
on 11
with 11
the 11
conveyance 11

no 11

was 11
lost 11
in 11
letting 11
adam 11
salton 11
have 11
formal 11
possession 11
of 11
the 11
estate 11
after 11
his 11
interview 11
with 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
he 11
had 11
taken 11
steps 11
to 11
begin 11
putting 11
his 11
plan 11
into 11
action 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
accumulate 11
the 11
necessary 11
amount 11
of 11
fine 11
seasand 11
he 11
ordered 11
the 11
steward 11
to 11
prepare 11
for 11
an 11
elaborate 11
system 11
of 11
topdressing 11
all 11
the 11
grounds 11

great 11
heap 11

brought 11
from 11
bays 11
on 11
the 11
welsh 11
coast 11

to 11
grow 11
at 11
the 11
back 11
of 11
the 11
grove 11
no 11
one 11
seemed 11
to 11
suspect 11
that 11
it 11
was 11
there 11
for 11
any 11
purpose 11
other 11
than 11
what 11
had 11
been 11
given 11

alone 11
could 11
have 11
guessed 11

now 11
so 11
absorbed 11
in 11
her 11
matrimonial 11
pursuit 11
of 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
neither 11
time 11
nor 11
inclination 11
for 11
thought 11
extraneous 11
to 11
this 11
she 11
had 11
not 11
yet 11
moved 11
from 11
the 11
house 11
though 11
she 11
had 11
formally 11
handed 11
over 11
the 11

put 11
up 11
a 11
rough 11
corrugatediron 11
shed 11
behind 11
the 11
grove 11
in 11
which 11
he 11
stored 11
his 11
explosives 11
all 11
being 11
ready 11
for 11
his 11
great 11
attempt 11
whenever 11
the 11
time 11
should 11
come 11
he 11
was 11
now 11
content 11
to 11
wait 11
and 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
pass 11

the 11
mound 11
of 11
fine 11
sand 11
grew 11
to 11
proportions 11
so 11
vast 11
as 11
to 11
puzzle 11
the 11
bailiffs 11
and 11

round 11

in 11
vainfor 11
an 11
opportunity 11
which 11
would 11
appear 11
to 11
be 11
natural 11
of 11
visiting 11
caswall 11
in 11
the 11
turret 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
at 11
last 11
one 11
morning 11
he 11
met 11
lady 11
arabella 11
moving 11
towards 11
the 11
castle 11
so 11
he 11
took 11
his 11
courage 11
e 11
deux 11
mains 11
and 11
asked 11
to 11
be 11
allowed 11
to 11
accompany 11
her 11
she 11
was 11
glad 11
for 11
her 11
own 11
purposes 11
to 11
comply 11
with 11
his 11
wishes 11
so 11
together 11
they 11
entered 11
and 11
found 11
their 11
way 11
to 11
the 11
turretroom 11
caswall 11
was 11
much 11
surprised 11
to 11
see 11
adam 11
come 11
to 11
his 11
house 11
but 11
lent 11
himself 11
to 11
the 11
task 11
of 11
seeming 11
to 11
be 11
pleased 11
he 11
played 11
the 11
host 11
so 11
well 11
as 11
to 11
deceive 11
even 11
adam 11
they 11
all 11
went 11
out 11
on 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
where 11
he 11
explained 11
to 11
his 11
guests 11
the 11
mechanism 11
for 11
raising 11
and 11
lowering 11
the 11
kite 11
taking 11
also 11
the 11
opportunity 11
of 11
testing 11
the 11
movements 11
of 11
the 11
multitudes 11
of 11
birds 11
how 11
they 11
answered 11
almost 11
instantaneously 11
to 11
the 11
lowering 11
or 11
raising 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
as 11
lady 11
arabella 11
walked 11
home 11
with 11
adam 11
from 11
castra 11
regis 11
she 11
asked 11
him 11
if 11
she 11
might 11
make 11
a 11
request 11
permission 11
having 11
been 11
accorded 11
she 11
explained 11
that 11
before 11
she 11
finally 11
left 11
dianas 11
grove 11
where 11
she 11
had 11
lived 11
so 11
long 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
desire 11
to 11
know 11
the 11
depth 11
of 11
the 11
well 11
hole 11
adam 11
was 11
really 11
happy 11
to 11
meet 11
her 11
wishes 11
not 11
from 11
any 11
sentiment 11
but 11
because 11
he 11
wished 11
to 11
give 11
some 11
valid 11
and 11
ostensible 11
reason 11
for 11
examining 11
the 11
passage 11
of 11
the 11
worm 11
which 11
would 11
obviate 11
any 11
suspicion 11
resulting 11
from 11
his 11
being 11
on 11
the 11
premises 11
he 11
brought 11
from 11
london 11
a 11
kelvin 11
sounding 11
apparatus 11
with 11
a 11
sufficient 11
length 11
of 11
pianowire 11
for 11
testing 11
any 11
probable 11
depth 11
the 11
wire 11
passed 11
easily 11
over 11
the 11
running 11
wheel 11
and 11
when 11
this 11
was 11
once 11
fixed 11
over 11
the 11
hole 11
he 11
was 11
satisfied 11
to 11
wait 11
till 11
the 11
most 11
advantageous 11
time 11
for 11
his 11
final 11
experiment 11
in 11
the 11
meantime 11
affairs 11
had 11
been 11
going 11
quietly 11
at 11
mercy 11
farm 11
lilla 11
of 11
course 11
felt 11
lonely 11
in 11
the 11
absence 11
of 11
her 11
cousin 11
but 11
the 11
even 11
tenor 11
of 11
life 11
went 11
on 11
for 11
her 11
as 11
for 11
others 11
after 11
the 11
first 11
shock 11
of 11
parting 11
was 11
over 11
things 11
went 11
back 11
to 11
their 11
accustomed 11
routine 11
in 11
one 11
respect 11
however 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
marked 11
difference 11
so 11
long 11
as 11
home 11
conditions 11
had 11
remained 11
unchanged 11
lilla 11
was 11
content 11
to 11
put 11
ambition 11
far 11
from 11
her 11
and 11
to 11
settle 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
life 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
hers 11
as 11
long 11
as 11
she 11
could 11
remember 11
but 11
mimis 11
marriage 11
set 11
her 11
thinking 11
naturally 11
she 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
conclusion 11
that 11
she 11
too 11
might 11
have 11
a 11
mate 11
there 11
was 11
not 11
for 11
her 11
much 11
choicethere 11
was 11
little 11
movement 11
in 11
the 11
matrimonial 11
direction 11
at 11
the 11
farmhouse 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
approve 11
of 11
the 11
personality 11
of 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
and 11
his 11
struggle 11
with 11
mimi 11
had 11
frightened 11
her 11
but 11
he 11
was 11
unmistakably 11
an 11
excellent 11
parti 11
much 11
better 11
than 11
she 11
could 11
have 11
any 11
right 11
to 11
expect 11
this 11
weighs 11
much 11
with 11
a 11
woman 11
and 11
more 11
particularly 11
one 11
of 11
her 11
class 11
so 11
on 11
the 11
whole 11
she 11
was 11
content 11
to 11
let 11
things 11
take 11
their 11
course 11
and 11
to 11
abide 11
by 11
the 11
issue 11
as 11
time 11
went 11
on 11
she 11
had 11
reason 11
to 11
believe 11
that 11
things 11
did 11
not 11
point 11
to 11
happiness 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
shut 11
her 11
eyes 11
to 11
certain 11
disturbing 11
facts 11
amongst 11
which 11
were 11
the 11
existence 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
her 11
growing 11
intimacy 11
with 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
his 11
own 11
cold 11
and 11
haughty 11
nature 11
so 11
little 11
in 11
accord 11
with 11
the 11
ardour 11
which 11
is 11
the 11
foundation 11
of 11
a 11
young 11
maids 11
dreams 11
of 11
happiness 11
how 11
things 11
would 11
of 11
necessity 11
alter 11
if 11
she 11
were 11
to 11
marry 11
she 11
was 11
afraid 11
to 11
think 11
all 11
told 11
the 11
prospect 11
was 11
not 11
happy 11
for 11
her 11
and 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
secret 11
longing 11
that 11
something 11
might 11
occur 11
to 11
upset 11
the 11
order 11
of 11
things 11
as 11
at 11
present 11
arranged 11
when 11
lilla 11
received 11
a 11
note 11
from 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
asking 11
if 11
he 11
might 11
come 11
to 11
tea 11
on 11
the 11
following 11
afternoon 11
her 11
heart 11
sank 11
within 11
her 11
if 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
for 11
her 11
fathers 11
sake 11
she 11
must 11
not 11
refuse 11
him 11
or 11
show 11
any 11
disinclination 11
which 11
he 11
might 11
construe 11
into 11
incivility 11
she 11
missed 11
mimi 11
more 11
than 11
she 11
could 11
say 11
or 11
even 11
dared 11
to 11
think 11
hitherto 11
she 11
had 11
always 11
looked 11
to 11
her 11
cousin 11
for 11
sympathy 11
for 11
understanding 11
for 11
loyal 11
support 11
now 11
she 11
and 11
all 11
these 11
things 11
and 11
a 11
thousand 11
othersgentle 11
assuring 11
supportingwere 11
gone 11
and 11
instead 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
horrible 11
aching 11
void 11
for 11
the 11
whole 11
afternoon 11
and 11
evening 11
and 11
for 11
the 11
following 11
forenoon 11
poor 11
lillas 11
loneliness 11
grew 11
to 11
be 11
a 11
positive 11
agony 11
for 11
the 11
first 11
time 11
she 11
began 11
to 11
realise 11
the 11
sense 11
of 11
her 11
loss 11
as 11
though 11
all 11
the 11
previous 11
suffering 11
had 11
been 11
merely 11
a 11
preparation 11
everything 11
she 11
looked 11
at 11
everything 11
she 11
remembered 11
or 11
thought 11
of 11
became 11
laden 11
with 11
poignant 11
memory 11
then 11
on 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
all 11
was 11
a 11
new 11
sense 11
of 11
dread 11
the 11
reaction 11
from 11
the 11
sense 11
of 11
security 11
which 11
had 11
surrounded 11
her 11
all 11
her 11
life 11
to 11
a 11
neverquieted 11
apprehension 11
was 11
at 11
times 11
almost 11
more 11
than 11
she 11
could 11
bear 11
it 11
so 11
filled 11
her 11
with 11
fear 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
haunting 11
feeling 11
that 11
she 11
would 11
as 11
soon 11
die 11
as 11
live 11
however 11
whatever 11
might 11
be 11
her 11
own 11
feelings 11
duty 11
had 11
to 11
be 11
done 11
and 11
as 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
brought 11
up 11
to 11
consider 11
duty 11
first 11
she 11
braced 11
herself 11
to 11
go 11
through 11
to 11
the 11
very 11
best 11
of 11
her 11
ability 11
what 11
was 11
before 11
her 11
still 11
the 11
severe 11
and 11
prolonged 11
struggle 11
for 11
selfcontrol 11
told 11
upon 11
lilla 11
she 11
looked 11
as 11
she 11
felt 11
ill 11
and 11
weak 11
she 11
was 11
really 11
in 11
a 11
nerveless 11
and 11
prostrate 11
condition 11
with 11
black 11
circles 11
round 11
her 11
eyes 11
pale 11
even 11
to 11
her 11
lips 11
and 11
with 11
an 11
instinctive 11
trembling 11
which 11
she 11
was 11
quite 11
unable 11
to 11
repress 11
it 11
was 11
for 11
her 11
a 11
sad 11
mischance 11
that 11
mimi 11
was 11
away 11
for 11
her 11
love 11
would 11
have 11
seen 11
through 11
all 11
obscuring 11
causes 11
and 11
have 11
brought 11
to 11
light 11
the 11
girls 11
unhappy 11
condition 11
of 11
health 11
lilla 11
was 11
utterly 11
unable 11
to 11
do 11
anything 11
to 11
escape 11
from 11
the 11
ordeal 11
before 11
her 11
but 11
her 11
cousin 11
with 11
the 11
experience 11
of 11
her 11
former 11
struggles 11
with 11
mr 11
caswall 11
and 11
of 11
the 11
condition 11
in 11
which 11
these 11
left 11
her 11
would 11
have 11
taken 11
stepseven 11
peremptory 11
ones 11
if 11
necessaryto 11
prevent 11
a 11
repetition 11
edgar 11
arrived 11
punctually 11
to 11
the 11
time 11
appointed 11
by 11
herself 11
when 11
lilla 11
through 11
the 11
great 11
window 11
saw 11
him 11
approaching 11
the 11
house 11
her 11
condition 11
of 11
nervous 11
upset 11
was 11
pitiable 11
she 11
braced 11
herself 11
up 11
however 11
and 11
managed 11
to 11
get 11
through 11
the 11
interview 11
in 11
its 11
preliminary 11
stages 11
without 11
any 11
perceptible 11
change 11
in 11
her 11
normal 11
appearance 11
and 11
bearing 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
to 11
her 11
an 11
added 11
terror 11
that 11
the 11
black 11
shadow 11
of 11
oolanga 11
whom 11
she 11
dreaded 11
would 11
follow 11
hard 11
on 11
his 11
master 11
a 11
load 11
was 11
lifted 11
from 11
her 11
mind 11
when 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
make 11
his 11
usual 11
stealthy 11
approach 11
she 11
had 11
also 11
feared 11
though 11
in 11
lesser 11
degree 11
lest 11
lady 11
arabella 11
should 11
be 11
present 11
to 11
make 11
trouble 11
for 11
her 11
as 11
before 11
with 11
a 11
womans 11
natural 11
forethought 11
in 11
a 11
difficult 11
position 11
she 11
had 11
provided 11
the 11
furnishing 11
of 11
the 11
teatable 11
as 11
a 11
subtle 11
indication 11
of 11
the 11
social 11
difference 11
between 11
her 11
and 11
her 11
guest 11
she 11
had 11
chosen 11
the 11
implements 11
of 11
service 11
as 11
well 11
as 11
all 11
the 11
provender 11
set 11
forth 11
of 11
the 11
humblest 11
kind 11
instead 11
of 11
arranging 11
the 11
silver 11
teapot 11
and 11
china 11
cups 11
she 11
had 11
set 11
out 11
an 11
earthen 11
teapot 11
such 11
as 11
was 11
in 11
common 11
use 11
in 11
the 11
farm 11
kitchen 11
the 11
same 11
idea 11
was 11
carried 11
out 11
in 11
the 11
cups 11
and 11
saucers 11
of 11
thick 11
homely 11
delft 11
and 11
in 11
the 11
creamjug 11
of 11
similar 11
kind 11
the 11
bread 11
was 11
of 11
simple 11
wholemeal 11
homebaked 11
the 11
butter 11
was 11
good 11
since 11
she 11
had 11
made 11
it 11
herself 11
while 11
the 11
preserves 11
and 11
honey 11
came 11
from 11
her 11
own 11
garden 11
her 11
face 11
beamed 11
with 11
satisfaction 11
when 11
the 11
guest 11
eyed 11
the 11
appointments 11
with 11
a 11
supercilious 11
glance 11
it 11
was 11
a 11
shock 11
to 11
the 11
poor 11
girl 11
herself 11
for 11
she 11
enjoyed 11
offering 11
to 11
a 11
guest 11
the 11
little 11
hospitalities 11
possible 11
to 11
her 11
but 11
that 11
had 11
to 11
be 11
sacrificed 11
with 11
other 11
pleasures 11
caswalls 11
face 11
was 11
more 11
set 11
and 11
ironclad 11
than 11
everhis 11
piercing 11
eyes 11
seemed 11
from 11
the 11
very 11
beginning 11
to 11
look 11
her 11
through 11
and 11
through 11
her 11
heart 11
quailed 11
when 11
she 11
thought 11
of 11
what 11
would 11
followof 11
what 11
would 11
be 11
the 11
end 11
when 11
this 11
was 11
only 11
the 11
beginning 11
as 11
some 11
protection 11
though 11
it 11
could 11
be 11
only 11
of 11
a 11
sentimental 11
kind 11
she 11
brought 11
from 11
her 11
own 11
room 11
the 11
photographs 11
of 11
mimi 11
of 11
her 11
grandfather 11
and 11
of 11
adam 11
salton 11
whom 11
by 11
now 11
she 11
had 11
grown 11
to 11
look 11
on 11
with 11
reliance 11
as 11
a 11
brother 11
whom 11
she 11
could 11
trust 11
she 11
kept 11
the 11
pictures 11
near 11
her 11
heart 11
to 11
which 11
her 11
hand 11
naturally 11
strayed 11
when 11
her 11
feelings 11
of 11
constraint 11
distrust 11
or 11
fear 11
became 11
so 11
poignant 11
as 11
to 11
interfere 11
with 11
the 11
calm 11
which 11
she 11
felt 11
was 11
necessary 11
to 11
help 11
her 11
through 11
her 11
ordeal 11
at 11
first 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
was 11
courteous 11
and 11
polite 11
even 11
thoughtful 11
but 11
after 11
a 11
little 11
while 11
when 11
he 11
found 11
her 11
resistance 11
to 11
his 11
domination 11
grow 11
he 11
abandoned 11
all 11
forms 11
of 11
selfcontrol 11
and 11
appeared 11
in 11
the 11
same 11
dominance 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
previously 11
shown 11
she 11
was 11
prepared 11
however 11
for 11
this 11
both 11
by 11
her 11
former 11
experience 11
and 11
the 11
natural 11
fighting 11
instinct 11
within 11
her 11
by 11
this 11
means 11
as 11
the 11
minutes 11
went 11
on 11
both 11
developed 11
the 11
power 11
and 11
preserved 11
the 11
equality 11
in 11
which 11
they 11
had 11
begun 11
without 11
warning 11
the 11
psychic 11
battle 11
between 11
the 11
two 11
individualities 11
began 11
afresh 11
this 11
time 11
both 11
the 11
positive 11
and 11
negative 11
causes 11
were 11
all 11
in 11
favour 11
of 11
the 11
man 11
the 11
woman 11
was 11
alone 11
and 11
in 11
bad 11
spirits 11
unsupported 11
nothing 11
at 11
all 11
was 11
in 11
her 11
favour 11
except 11
the 11
memory 11
of 11
the 11
two 11
victorious 11
contests 11
whereas 11
the 11
man 11
though 11
unaided 11
as 11
before 11
by 11
either 11
lady 11
arabella 11
or 11

in 11
flourishing 11
circumstances 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
therefore 11
to 11
be 11
wondered 11
at 11
that 11
his 11
native 11
dominance 11
of 11
character 11
had 11
full 11
opportunity 11
of 11
asserting 11
itself 11
he 11
began 11
his 11
preliminary 11
stare 11
with 11
a 11
conscious 11
sense 11
of 11
power 11
and 11
as 11
it 11
appeared 11
to 11
have 11
immediate 11
effect 11
on 11
the 11
girl 11
he 11
felt 11
an 11
evergrowing 11
conviction 11
of 11
ultimate 11
victory 11
after 11
a 11
little 11
lillas 11
resolution 11
began 11
to 11
flag 11
she 11
felt 11
that 11
the 11
contest 11
was 11
unequalthat 11
she 11
was 11
unable 11
to 11
put 11
forth 11
her 11
best 11
efforts 11
as 11
she 11
was 11
an 11
unselfish 11
person 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
fight 11
so 11
well 11
in 11
her 11
own 11
battle 11
as 11
in 11
that 11
of 11
someone 11
whom 11
she 11
loved 11
and 11
to 11
whom 11
she 11
was 11
devoted 11
edgar 11
saw 11
the 11
relaxing 11
of 11
the 11
muscles 11
of 11
face 11
and 11
brow 11
and 11
the 11
almost 11
collapse 11
of 11
the 11
heavy 11
eyelids 11
which 11
seemed 11
tumbling 11
downward 11
in 11
sleep 11
lilla 11
made 11
gallant 11
efforts 11
to 11
brace 11
her 11
dwindling 11
powers 11
but 11
for 11
a 11
time 11
unsuccessfully 11
at 11
length 11
there 11
came 11
an 11
interruption 11
which 11
seemed 11
like 11
a 11
powerful 11
stimulant 11
through 11
the 11
wide 11
window 11
she 11
saw 11
lady 11
arabella 11
enter 11
the 11
plain 11
gateway 11
of 11
the 11
farm 11
and 11
advance 11
towards 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
she 11
was 11
clad 11
as 11
usual 11
in 11
tightfitting 11
white 11
which 11
accentuated 11
her 11
thin 11
sinuous 11
figure 11
the 11
sight 11
did 11
for 11
lilla 11
what 11
no 11
voluntary 11
effort 11
could 11
have 11
done 11
her 11
eyes 11
flashed 11
and 11
in 11
an 11
instant 11
she 11
felt 11
as 11
though 11
a 11
new 11
life 11
had 11
suddenly 11
developed 11
within 11
her 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
entry 11
in 11
her 11
usual 11
unconcerned 11
haughty 11
supercilious 11
way 11
heightened 11
the 11
effect 11
so 11
that 11
when 11
the 11
two 11
stood 11
close 11
to 11
each 11
other 11
battle 11
was 11
joined 11
mr 11
caswall 11
too 11
took 11
new 11
courage 11
from 11
her 11
coming 11
and 11
all 11
his 11
masterfulness 11
and 11
power 11
came 11
back 11
to 11
him 11
his 11
looks 11
intensified 11
had 11
more 11
obvious 11
effect 11
than 11
had 11
been 11
noticeable 11
that 11
day 11
lilla 11
seemed 11
at 11
last 11
overcome 11
by 11
his 11
dominance 11
her 11
face 11
became 11
red 11
and 11
paleviolently 11
red 11
and 11
ghastly 11
paleby 11
rapid 11
turns 11
her 11
strength 11
seemed 11
gone 11
her 11
knees 11
collapsed 11
and 11
she 11
was 11
actually 11
sinking 11
on 11
the 11
floor 11
when 11
to 11
her 11
surprise 11
and 11
joy 11
mimi 11
came 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
running 11
hurriedly 11
and 11
breathing 11
heavily 11
lilla 11
rushed 11
to 11
her 11
and 11
the 11
two 11
clasped 11
hands 11
with 11
that 11
a 11
new 11
sense 11
of 11
power 11
greater 11
than 11
lilla 11
had 11
ever 11
seen 11
in 11
her 11
seemed 11
to 11
quicken 11
her 11
cousin 11
her 11
hand 11
swept 11
the 11
air 11
in 11
front 11
of 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
seeming 11
to 11
drive 11
him 11
backward 11
more 11
and 11
more 11
by 11
each 11
movement 11
till 11
at 11
last 11
he 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
actually 11
hurled 11
through 11
the 11
door 11
which 11
mimis 11
entrance 11
had 11
left 11
open 11
and 11
fell 11
at 11
full 11
length 11
on 11
the 11
gravel 11
path 11
without 11
then 11
came 11
the 11
final 11
and 11
complete 11
collapse 11
of 11
lilla 11
who 11
without 11
a 11
sound 11
sank 11
down 11
on 11
the 11
floor 11
chapter 11
xxviface 11
to 11
face 11
mimi 11
was 11
greatly 11
distressed 11
when 11
she 11
saw 11
her 11
cousin 11
lying 11
prone 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
few 11
times 11
in 11
her 11
life 11
seen 11
lilla 11
on 11
the 11
verge 11
of 11
fainting 11
but 11
never 11
senseless 11
and 11
now 11
she 11
was 11
frightened 11
she 11
threw 11
herself 11
on 11
her 11
knees 11
beside 11
lilla 11
and 11
tried 11
by 11
rubbing 11
her 11
hands 11
and 11
other 11
measures 11
commonly 11
known 11
to 11
restore 11
her 11
but 11
all 11
her 11
efforts 11
were 11
unavailing 11
lilla 11
still 11
lay 11
white 11
and 11
senseless 11
in 11
fact 11
each 11
moment 11
she 11
looked 11
worse 11
her 11
breast 11
that 11
had 11
been 11
heaving 11
with 11
the 11
stress 11
became 11
still 11
and 11
the 11
pallor 11
of 11
her 11
face 11
grew 11
like 11
marble 11
at 11
these 11
succeeding 11
changes 11
mimis 11
fright 11
grew 11
till 11
it 11
altogether 11
mastered 11
her 11
she 11
succeeded 11
in 11
controlling 11
herself 11
only 11
to 11
the 11
extent 11
that 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
scream 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
followed 11
caswall 11
when 11
he 11
had 11
recovered 11
sufficiently 11
to 11
get 11
up 11
and 11
walkthough 11
stumblinglyin 11
the 11
direction 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
when 11
mimi 11
was 11
quite 11
alone 11
with 11
lilla 11
and 11
the 11
need 11
for 11
effort 11
had 11
ceased 11
she 11
felt 11
weak 11
and 11
trembled 11
in 11
her 11
own 11
mind 11
she 11
attributed 11
it 11
to 11
a 11
sudden 11
change 11
in 11
the 11
weatherit 11
was 11
momentarily 11
becoming 11
apparent 11
that 11
a 11
storm 11
was 11
coming 11
on 11
she 11
raised 11
lillas 11
head 11
and 11
laid 11
it 11
on 11
her 11
warm 11
young 11
breast 11
but 11
all 11
in 11
vain 11
the 11
cold 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
features 11
thrilled 11
through 11
her 11
and 11
she 11
utterly 11
collapsed 11
when 11
it 11
was 11
borne 11
in 11
on 11
her 11
that 11
lilla 11
had 11
passed 11
away 11
the 11
dusk 11
gradually 11
deepened 11
and 11
the 11
shades 11
of 11
evening 11
closed 11
in 11
but 11
mimi 11
did 11
not 11
seem 11
to 11
notice 11
or 11
to 11
care 11
she 11
sat 11
on 11
the 11
floor 11
with 11
her 11
arms 11
round 11
the 11
body 11
of 11
the 11
girl 11
whom 11
she 11
loved 11
darker 11
and 11
blacker 11
grew 11
the 11
sky 11
as 11
the 11
coming 11
storm 11
and 11
the 11
closing 11
night 11
joined 11
forces 11
still 11
she 11
sat 11
onalonetearlessunable 11
to 11
think 11
mimi 11
did 11
not 11
know 11
how 11
long 11
she 11
sat 11
there 11
though 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
her 11
that 11
ages 11
had 11
passed 11
it 11
could 11
not 11
have 11
been 11
more 11
than 11
halfanhour 11
she 11
suddenly 11
came 11
to 11
herself 11
and 11
was 11
surprised 11
to 11
find 11
that 11
her 11
grandfather 11
had 11
not 11
returned 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
she 11
lay 11
quiet 11
thinking 11
of 11
the 11
immediate 11
past 11
lillas 11
hand 11
was 11
still 11
in 11
hers 11
and 11
to 11
her 11
surprise 11
it 11
was 11
still 11
warm 11
somehow 11
this 11
helped 11
her 11
consciousness 11
and 11
without 11
any 11
special 11
act 11
of 11
will 11
she 11
stood 11
up 11
she 11
lit 11
a 11
lamp 11
and 11
looked 11
at 11
her 11
cousin 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
doubt 11
that 11
lilla 11
was 11
dead 11
but 11
when 11
the 11
lamplight 11
fell 11
on 11
her 11
eyes 11
they 11
seemed 11
to 11
look 11
at 11
mimi 11
with 11
intentwith 11
meaning 11
in 11
this 11
state 11
of 11
dark 11
isolation 11
a 11
new 11
resolution 11
came 11
to 11
her 11
and 11
grew 11
and 11
grew 11
until 11
it 11
became 11
a 11
fixed 11
definite 11
purpose 11
she 11
would 11
face 11
caswall 11
and 11
call 11
him 11
to 11
account 11
for 11
his 11
murder 11
of 11
lillathat 11
was 11
what 11
she 11
called 11
it 11
to 11
herself 11
she 11
would 11
also 11
take 11
stepsshe 11
knew 11
not 11
what 11
or 11
howto 11
avenge 11
the 11
part 11
taken 11
by 11
lady 11
arabella 11
in 11
this 11
frame 11
of 11
mind 11
she 11
lit 11
all 11
the 11
lamps 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
got 11
water 11
and 11
linen 11
from 11
her 11
room 11
and 11
set 11
about 11
the 11
decent 11
ordering 11
of 11
lillas 11
body 11
this 11
took 11
some 11
time 11
but 11
when 11
it 11
was 11
finished 11
she 11
put 11
on 11
her 11
hat 11
and 11
cloak 11
put 11
out 11
the 11
lights 11
and 11
set 11
out 11
quietly 11
for 11
castra 11
regis 11
as 11
mimi 11
drew 11
near 11
the 11
castle 11
she 11
saw 11
no 11
lights 11
except 11
those 11
in 11
and 11
around 11
the 11
tower 11
room 11
the 11
lights 11
showed 11
her 11
that 11
mr 11
caswall 11
was 11
there 11
so 11
she 11
entered 11
by 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
which 11
as 11
usual 11
was 11
open 11
and 11
felt 11
her 11
way 11
in 11
the 11
darkness 11
up 11
the 11
staircase 11
to 11
the 11
lobby 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
the 11
door 11
was 11
ajar 11
and 11
the 11
light 11
from 11
within 11
showed 11
brilliantly 11
through 11
the 11
opening 11
she 11
saw 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
walking 11
restlessly 11
to 11
and 11
fro 11
in 11
the 11
room 11
with 11
his 11
hands 11
clasped 11
behind 11
his 11
back 11
she 11
opened 11
the 11
door 11
without 11
knocking 11
and 11
walked 11
right 11
into 11
the 11
room 11
as 11
she 11
entered 11
he 11
ceased 11
walking 11
and 11
stared 11
at 11
her 11
in 11
surprise 11
she 11
made 11
no 11
remark 11
no 11
comment 11
but 11
continued 11
the 11
fixed 11
look 11
which 11
he 11
had 11
seen 11
on 11
her 11
entrance 11
for 11
a 11
time 11
silence 11
reigned 11
and 11
the 11
two 11
stood 11
looking 11
fixedly 11
at 11
each 11
other 11
mimi 11
was 11
the 11
first 11
to 11
speak 11

myself 11
but 11
you 11
dont 11
care 11
for 11
god 11
or 11
believe 11
in 11
him 11
your 11
god 11
is 11
your 11
great 11
kite 11
which 11
cows 11
the 11
birds 11
of 11
a 11
whole 11
district 11
but 11
be 11
sure 11
that 11
his 11
hand 11
when 11
it 11
rises 11
always 11
falls 11
at 11
the 11
appointed 11
time 11
it 11
may 11
be 11
that 11
your 11
name 11
is 11
being 11
called 11
even 11
at 11
this 11
very 11
moment 11
at 11
the 11
great 11
assize 11
repent 11
while 11
there 11
is 11
still 11
time 11
happy 11
you 11
if 11
you 11
may 11
be 11
allowed 11
to 11
enter 11
those 11
mighty 11
halls 11
in 11
the 11
company 11
of 11
the 11
puresouled 11
angel 11
whose 11
voice 11
has 11
only 11
to 11
whisper 11
one 11
word 11
of 11
justice 11
and 11
you 11
disappear 11
for 11
ever 11
into 11
everlasting 11
torment 11
the 11
sudden 11
death 11
of 11
lilla 11
caused 11
consternation 11
among 11
mimis 11
friends 11
and 11
wellwishers 11
such 11
a 11
tragedy 11
was 11
totally 11
unexpected 11
as 11
adam 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
been 11
expecting 11
the 11
white 11
worms 11
vengeance 11
to 11
fall 11
upon 11
themselves 11
adam 11
leaving 11
his 11
wife 11
free 11
to 11
follow 11
her 11
own 11
desires 11
with 11
regard 11
to 11
lilla 11
and 11
her 11
grandfather 11
busied 11
himself 11
with 11
filling 11
the 11
wellhole 11
with 11
the 11
fine 11
sand 11
prepared 11
for 11
the 11
purpose 11
taking 11
care 11
to 11
have 11
lowered 11
at 11
stated 11
intervals 11
quantities 11
of 11
the 11
store 11
of 11
dynamite 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
be 11
ready 11
for 11
the 11
final 11
explosion 11
he 11
had 11
under 11
his 11
immediate 11
supervision 11
a 11
corps 11
of 11
workmen 11
and 11
was 11
assisted 11
by 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
who 11
had 11
come 11
over 11
for 11
the 11
purpose 11
and 11
all 11
were 11
now 11
staying 11
at 11
lesser 11
hill 11
mr 11
salton 11
too 11
showed 11
much 11
interest 11
in 11
the 11
job 11
and 11
was 11
constantly 11
coming 11
in 11
and 11
out 11
nothing 11
escaping 11
his 11
observation 11
since 11
her 11
marriage 11
to 11
adam 11
and 11
their 11
coming 11
to 11
stay 11
at 11
doom 11
tower 11
mimi 11
had 11
been 11
fettered 11
by 11
fear 11
of 11
the 11
horrible 11
monster 11
at 11
dianas 11
grove 11
but 11
now 11
she 11
dreaded 11
it 11
no 11
longer 11
she 11
accepted 11
the 11
fact 11
of 11
its 11
assuming 11
at 11
will 11
the 11
form 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
she 11
had 11
still 11
to 11
tax 11
and 11
upbraid 11
her 11
for 11
her 11
part 11
in 11
the 11
unhappiness 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
wrought 11
on 11
lilla 11
and 11
for 11
her 11
share 11
in 11
causing 11
her 11
death 11
one 11
evening 11
when 11
mimi 11
entered 11
her 11
own 11
room 11
she 11
went 11
to 11
the 11
window 11
and 11
threw 11
an 11
eager 11
look 11
round 11
the 11
whole 11
circle 11
of 11
sight 11
a 11
single 11
glance 11
satisfied 11
her 11
that 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
in 11
propria 11
persona 11
was 11
not 11
visible 11
so 11
she 11
sat 11
down 11
in 11
the 11
windowseat 11
and 11
enjoyed 11
the 11
pleasure 11
of 11
a 11
full 11
view 11
from 11
which 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
so 11
long 11
cut 11
off 11
the 11
maid 11
who 11
waited 11
on 11
her 11
had 11
told 11
her 11
that 11
mr 11
salton 11
had 11
not 11
yet 11
returned 11
home 11
so 11
she 11
felt 11
free 11
to 11
enjoy 11
the 11
luxury 11
of 11
peace 11
and 11
quiet 11
as 11
she 11
looked 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
window 11
she 11
saw 11
something 11
thin 11
and 11
white 11
move 11
along 11
the 11
avenue 11
she 11
thought 11
she 11
recognised 11
the 11
figure 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
instinctively 11
drew 11
back 11
behind 11
the 11
curtain 11
when 11
she 11
had 11
ascertained 11
by 11
peeping 11
out 11
several 11
times 11
that 11
the 11
lady 11
had 11
not 11
seen 11
her 11
she 11
watched 11
more 11
carefully 11
all 11
her 11
instinctive 11
hatred 11
flooding 11
back 11
at 11
the 11
sight 11
of 11
her 11
lady 11
arabella 11
was 11
moving 11
swiftly 11
and 11
stealthily 11
looking 11
back 11
and 11
around 11
her 11
at 11
intervals 11
as 11
if 11
she 11
feared 11
to 11
be 11
followed 11
this 11
gave 11
mimi 11
an 11
idea 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
up 11
to 11
no 11
good 11
so 11
she 11
determined 11
to 11
seize 11
the 11
occasion 11
for 11
watching 11
her 11
in 11
more 11
detail 11
hastily 11
putting 11
on 11
a 11
dark 11
cloak 11
and 11
hat 11
she 11
ran 11
downstairs 11
and 11
out 11
into 11
the 11
avenue 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
moved 11
but 11
the 11
sheen 11
of 11
her 11
white 11
dress 11
was 11
still 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
among 11
the 11
young 11
oaks 11
around 11
the 11
gateway 11
keeping 11
in 11
shadow 11
mimi 11
followed 11
taking 11
care 11
not 11
to 11
come 11
so 11
close 11
as 11
to 11
awake 11
the 11
others 11
suspicion 11
and 11
watched 11
her 11
quarry 11
pass 11
along 11
the 11
road 11
in 11
the 11
direction 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
she 11
followed 11
on 11
steadily 11
through 11
the 11
gloom 11
of 11
the 11
trees 11
depending 11
on 11
the 11
glint 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
dress 11
to 11
keep 11
her 11
right 11
the 11
wood 11
began 11
to 11
thicken 11
and 11
presently 11
when 11
the 11
road 11
widened 11
and 11
the 11
trees 11
grew 11
farther 11
back 11
she 11
lost 11
sight 11
of 11
any 11
indication 11
of 11
her 11
whereabouts 11
under 11
the 11
present 11
conditions 11
it 11
was 11
impossible 11
for 11
her 11
to 11
do 11
any 11
more 11
so 11
after 11
waiting 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
still 11
hidden 11
in 11
the 11
shadow 11
to 11
see 11
if 11
she 11
could 11
catch 11
another 11
glimpse 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
frock 11
she 11
determined 11
to 11
go 11
on 11
slowly 11
towards 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
trust 11
to 11
the 11
chapter 11
of 11
accidents 11
to 11
pick 11
up 11
the 11
trail 11
again 11
she 11
went 11
on 11
slowly 11
taking 11
advantage 11
of 11
every 11
obstacle 11
and 11
shadow 11
to 11
keep 11
herself 11
concealed 11
at 11
last 11
she 11
entered 11
on 11
the 11
grounds 11
of 11
the 11
castle 11
at 11
a 11
spot 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
windows 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
were 11
dimly 11
visible 11
without 11
having 11
seen 11
again 11
any 11
sign 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
meanwhile 11
during 11
most 11
of 11
the 11
time 11
that 11
mimi 11
salton 11
had 11
been 11
moving 11
warily 11
along 11
in 11
the 11
gloom 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
reality 11
being 11
followed 11
by 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
had 11
caught 11
sight 11
of 11
her 11
leaving 11
the 11
house 11
and 11
had 11
never 11
again 11
lost 11
touch 11
with 11
her 11
it 11
was 11
a 11
case 11
of 11
the 11
hunter 11
being 11
hunted 11
for 11
a 11
time 11
mimis 11
many 11
turnings 11
with 11
the 11
natural 11
obstacles 11
that 11
were 11
perpetually 11
intervening 11
caused 11
lady 11
arabella 11
some 11
trouble 11
but 11
when 11
she 11
was 11
close 11
to 11
castra 11
regis 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
more 11
possibility 11
of 11
concealment 11
and 11
the 11
strange 11
double 11
following 11
went 11
swiftly 11
on 11
when 11
she 11
saw 11
mimi 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
ascending 11
the 11
steps 11
she 11
followed 11
when 11
mimi 11
entered 11
the 11
dark 11
hall 11
and 11
felt 11
her 11
way 11
up 11
the 11
staircase 11
still 11
as 11
she 11
believed 11
following 11
lady 11
arabella 11
the 11
latter 11
kept 11
on 11
her 11
way 11
when 11
they 11
reached 11
the 11
lobby 11
of 11
the 11
turretrooms 11
mimi 11
believed 11
that 11
the 11
object 11
of 11
her 11
search 11
was 11
ahead 11
of 11
her 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
sat 11
in 11
the 11
gloom 11
of 11
the 11
great 11
room 11
occasionally 11
stirred 11
to 11
curiosity 11
when 11
the 11
drifting 11
clouds 11
allowed 11
a 11
little 11
light 11
to 11
fall 11
from 11
the 11
stormswept 11
sky 11
but 11
nothing 11
really 11
interested 11
him 11
now 11
since 11
he 11
had 11
heard 11
of 11
lillas 11
death 11
the 11
gloom 11
of 11
his 11
remorse 11
emphasised 11
by 11
mimis 11
upbraiding 11
had 11
made 11
more 11
hopeless 11
his 11
cruel 11
selfish 11
saturnine 11
nature 11
he 11
heard 11
no 11
sound 11
for 11
his 11
normal 11
faculties 11
seemed 11
benumbed 11
mimi 11
when 11
she 11
came 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
which 11
stood 11
ajar 11
gave 11
a 11
light 11
tap 11
so 11
light 11
was 11
it 11
that 11
it 11
did 11
not 11
reach 11
caswalls 11
ears 11
then 11
taking 11
her 11
courage 11
in 11
both 11
hands 11
she 11
boldly 11
pushed 11
the 11
door 11

entered 11
as 11
she 11
did 11
so 11
her 11
heart 11
sank 11
for 11
now 11
she 11
was 11
face 11
to 11
face 11
with 11
a 11
difficulty 11
which 11
had 11
not 11

the 11
turret 11
roof 11
the 11
storm 11
which 11
was 11
coming 11
was 11
already 11
making 11
itself 11
manifest 11
not 11
only 11
in 11
the 11
wide 11
scope 11
of 11
nature 11
but 11
in 11
the 11
hearts 11
and 11
natures 11
of 11
human 11

electrical 11
disturbance 11
in 11
the 11

and 11
the 11

is 11
reproduced 11
in 11
animals 11
of 11
all 11

so 11
it 11
was 11
with 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
despite 11
his 11
selfish 11
nature 11
and 11
coldness 11
of 11
blood 11
so 11
it 11
was 11
with 11
mimi 11
salton 11
despite 11
her 11
unselfish 11
unchanging 11
devotion 11
for 11
those 11
she 11
loved 11
so 11
it 11
was 11
even 11
with 11
lady 11
arabella 11
who 11
under 11
the 11
instincts 11
of 11
a 11
primeval 11
serpent 11
carried 11
the 11
evervarying 11
wishes 11
and 11
customs 11
of 11
womanhood 11
which 11
is 11

after 11
he 11
had 11
turned 11
his 11
eyes 11
on 11
mimi 11
resumed 11
his 11
apathetic 11
position 11
and 11
sullen 11
silence 11
mimi 11
quietly 11
took 11
a 11
seat 11
a 11
little 11
way 11
apart 11
whence 11
she 11
could 11
look 11
on 11
the 11
progress 11
of 11
the 11
coming 11
storm 11
and 11
study 11
its 11
appearance 11
throughout 11
the 11
whole 11
visible 11
circle 11
of 11
the 11
neighbourhood 11
she 11
was 11
in 11
brighter 11
and 11
better 11
spirits 11
than 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
for 11
many 11
days 11
past 11
lady 11
arabella 11
tried 11
to 11
efface 11
herself 11
behind 11
the 11
now 11
open 11
door 11
without 11
the 11
clouds 11
grew 11
thicker 11
and 11
blacker 11
as 11
the 11
stormcentre 11
came 11
closer 11
as 11
yet 11
the 11
forces 11
from 11
whose 11
linking 11
the 11
lightning 11
springs 11
were 11
held 11
apart 11
and 11
the 11
silence 11
of 11
nature 11
proclaimed 11
the 11
calm 11
before 11
the 11
storm 11
caswall 11
felt 11
the 11
effect 11
of 11
the 11
gathering 11
electric 11
force 11
a 11
sort 11
of 11
wild 11
exultation 11
grew 11
upon 11
him 11
such 11
as 11
he 11
had 11
sometimes 11
felt 11
just 11
before 11
the 11
breaking 11
of 11
a 11
tropical 11
storm 11
as 11
he 11
became 11
conscious 11
of 11
this 11
he 11
raised 11
his 11
head 11
and 11
caught 11
sight 11
of 11
mimi 11
he 11
was 11
in 11
the 11
grip 11
of 11
an 11
emotion 11
greater 11
than 11
himself 11
in 11
the 11
mood 11
in 11
which 11
he 11
was 11
he 11
felt 11
the 11
need 11
upon 11
him 11
of 11
doing 11
some 11
desperate 11
deed 11
he 11
was 11
now 11
absolutely 11
reckless 11
and 11
as 11
mimi 11
was 11
associated 11
with 11
him 11
in 11
the 11
memory 11
which 11
drove 11
him 11
on 11
he 11
wished 11
that 11
she 11
too 11
should 11
be 11
engaged 11
in 11
this 11
enterprise 11
he 11
had 11
no 11
knowledge 11
of 11
the 11
proximity 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
and 11
thought 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
far 11
removed 11
from 11
all 11
he 11
knew 11
and 11
whose 11
interests 11
he 11
sharedalone 11
with 11
the 11
wild 11
elements 11
which 11
were 11
being 11
lashed 11
to 11
fury 11
and 11
with 11
the 11
woman 11
who 11
had 11
struggled 11
with 11
him 11
and 11
vanquished 11
him 11
and 11
on 11
whom 11
he 11
would 11
shower 11
the 11
full 11
measure 11
of 11
his 11
hate 11
the 11
fact 11
was 11
that 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
was 11
if 11
not 11
mad 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
borderline 11

first 11
stagemonomaniais 11

lack 11
of 11

so 11
long 11
as 11
this 11
is 11
general 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
always 11
noticeable 11
for 11
the 11
uninspired 11
onlooker 11
is 11
without 11
the 11
necessary 11
means 11
of 11
comparison 11
but 11
in 11
monomania 11
the 11
errant 11
faculty 11
protrudes 11
itself 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
that 11
may 11
not 11

rather 11
perhaps 11
an 11
intuitionof 11
the 11
true 11
state 11
of 11
things 11
when 11
she 11
heard 11
him 11
speak 11
and 11
at 11
the 11
same 11
time 11
noticed 11
the 11
abnormal 11
flush 11
on 11
his 11
face 11
and 11
his 11
rolling 11
eyes 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
certain 11
want 11
of 11
fixedness 11
of 11
purpose 11
which 11
she 11
had 11
certainly 11
not 11
noticed 11
beforea 11
quick 11
spasmodic 11
utterance 11
which 11
belongs 11
rather 11
to 11
the 11
insane 11
than 11
to 11
those 11
of 11
intellectual 11
equilibrium 11
she 11
was 11
a 11
little 11
frightened 11
not 11
only 11
by 11
his 11
thoughts 11
but 11
by 11
his 11
staccato 11
way 11
of 11
expressing 11
them 11
caswall 11
moved 11
to 11
the 11
door 11
leading 11
to 11
the 11
turret 11
stair 11
by 11
which 11
the 11
roof 11
was 11
reached 11
and 11
spoke 11
in 11
a 11
peremptory 11
way 11
whose 11
tone 11
alone 11
made 11
her 11
feel 11
defiant 11
come 11
i 11
want 11
you 11
she 11
instinctively 11
drew 11
backshe 11
was 11
not 11
accustomed 11
to 11
such 11
words 11
more 11
especially 11
to 11
such 11
a 11
tone 11
her 11
answer 11
was 11
indicative 11
of 11
a 11
new 11
contest 11
why 11
should 11
i 11
go 11
what 11
for 11
he 11
did 11
not 11
at 11
once 11
replyanother 11
indication 11
of 11
his 11
overwhelming 11
egotism 11
she 11
repeated 11
her 11
questions 11
habit 11
reasserted 11
itself 11
and 11
he 11
spoke 11
without 11
thinking 11
the 11
words 11
which 11
were 11
in 11
his 11
heart 11
i 11
want 11
you 11
if 11
you 11
will 11
be 11
so 11
good 11
to 11
come 11
with 11
me 11
to 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
i 11
am 11
much 11
interested 11
in 11
certain 11
experiments 11
with 11
the 11
kite 11
which 11
would 11
be 11
if 11
not 11
a 11
pleasure 11
at 11

a 11
novel 11
experience 11
to 11
you 11
you 11
would 11
see 11
something 11
not 11
easily 11
seen 11
otherwise 11
i 11
will 11
come 11
she 11
answered 11
simply 11
edgar 11
moved 11
in 11
the 11
direction 11
of 11
the 11
stair 11
she 11
following 11
close 11
behind 11
him 11
she 11
did 11
not 11
like 11
to 11
be 11
left 11
alone 11
at 11
such 11
a 11
height 11
in 11
such 11
a 11
place 11
in 11
the 11
darkness 11
with 11
a 11
storm 11
about 11
to 11
break 11
of 11
himself 11
she 11
had 11
no 11
fear 11
all 11
that 11
had 11
been 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
passed 11
away 11
with 11
her 11
two 11
victories 11
over 11
him 11
in 11
the 11
struggle 11
of 11
wills 11
moreover 11
the 11
more 11
recent 11
apprehensionthat 11
of 11
his 11
madnesshad 11
also 11
ceased 11
in 11
the 11
conversation 11
of 11
the 11
last 11
few 11
minutes 11
he 11
seemed 11
so 11
rational 11
so 11
clear 11
so 11
unaggressive 11
that 11
she 11
no 11
longer 11
saw 11
reason 11
for 11
doubt 11
so 11
satisfied 11
was 11
she 11
that 11
even 11
when 11
he 11
put 11
out 11
a 11
hand 11
to 11
guide 11
her 11
to 11
the 11
steep 11
narrow 11
stairway 11
she 11
took 11
it 11
without 11
thought 11
in 11
the 11
most 11
conventional 11
way 11
lady 11
arabella 11
crouching 11
in 11
the 11
lobby 11
behind 11
the 11
door 11
heard 11
every 11
word 11
that 11
had 11
been 11
said 11
and 11
formed 11
her 11
own 11
opinion 11
of 11
it 11
it 11
seemed 11
evident 11
to 11
her 11
that 11
there 11
had 11
been 11
some 11
rapprochement 11
between 11
the 11
two 11
who 11
had 11
so 11
lately 11
been 11
hostile 11
to 11
each 11
other 11
and 11
that 11
made 11
her 11
furiously 11
angry 11
mimi 11
was 11
interfering 11
with 11
her 11
plans 11
she 11
had 11
made 11
certain 11
of 11
her 11
capture 11
of 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
and 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
tolerate 11
even 11
the 11
lightest 11
and 11
most 11
contemptuous 11
fancy 11
on 11
his 11
part 11
which 11
might 11
divert 11
him 11
from 11
the 11
main 11
issue 11
when 11
she 11
became 11
aware 11
that 11
he 11
wished 11
mimi 11
to 11
come 11
with 11
him 11
to 11
the 11
roof 11
and 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
acquiesced 11
her 11
rage 11
got 11
beyond 11
bounds 11
she 11
became 11
oblivious 11
to 11
any 11
danger 11
there 11
might 11
be 11
in 11
a 11
visit 11
to 11
such 11
an 11
exposed 11
place 11
at 11
such 11
a 11
time 11
and 11
to 11
all 11
lesser 11
considerations 11
and 11
made 11
up 11
her 11
mind 11
to 11
forestall 11
them 11
she 11
stealthily 11
and 11
noiselessly 11
crept 11
through 11
the 11
wicket 11
and 11
ascending 11
the 11
stair 11
stepped 11
out 11
on 11
the 11
roof 11
it 11
was 11
bitterly 11
cold 11
for 11
the 11
fierce 11
gusts 11
of 11
the 11
storm 11
which 11
swept 11
round 11
the 11
turret 11
drove 11
in 11
through 11
every 11
unimpeded 11
way 11
whistling 11
at 11
the 11
sharp 11
corners 11
and 11
singing 11
round 11
the 11
trembling 11
flagstaff 11
the 11
kite 11
string 11
and 11
the 11
wire 11
which 11
controlled 11
the 11
runners 11
made 11
a 11
concourse 11
of 11
weird 11
sounds 11
which 11
somehow 11
perhaps 11
from 11
the 11
violence 11
which 11
surrounded 11
them 11
acting 11
on 11
their 11
length 11
resolved 11
themselves 11
into 11
some 11
kind 11
of 11
harmonya 11
fitting 11
accompaniment 11
to 11
the 11
tragedy 11
which 11
seemed 11
about 11
to 11
begin 11
mimis 11
heart 11
beat 11
heavily 11
just 11
before 11
leaving 11
the 11
turretchamber 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
shock 11
which 11
she 11
could 11
not 11
shake 11
off 11
the 11
lights 11
of 11
the 11
room 11
had 11
momentarily 11
revealed 11
to 11
her 11
as 11
they 11
passed 11
out 11
edgars 11
face 11
concentrated 11
as 11
it 11
was 11
whenever 11
he 11
intended 11
to 11
use 11
his 11
mesmeric 11
power 11
now 11
the 11
black 11
eyebrows 11
made 11
a 11
thick 11
line 11
across 11
his 11
face 11
under 11
which 11
his 11
eyes 11
shone 11
and 11
glittered 11
ominously 11
mimi 11
recognised 11
the 11
danger 11
and 11
assumed 11
the 11
defiant 11
attitude 11
that 11
had 11
twice 11
already 11
served 11
her 11
so 11
well 11
she 11
had 11
a 11
fear 11
that 11
the 11
circumstances 11
and 11
the 11
place 11
were 11
against 11
her 11
and 11
she 11
wanted 11
to 11
be 11
forearmed 11
the 11
sky 11
was 11
now 11
somewhat 11
lighter 11
than 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
either 11
there 11
was 11
lightning 11
afar 11
off 11
whose 11
reflections 11
were 11
carried 11
by 11
the 11
rolling 11
clouds 11
or 11
else 11
the 11
gathered 11
force 11
though 11
not 11
yet 11
breaking 11
into 11
lightning 11
had 11
an 11
incipient 11
power 11
of 11
light 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
affect 11
both 11
the 11
man 11
and 11
the 11
woman 11
edgar 11
seemed 11
altogether 11
under 11
its 11
influence 11
his 11
spirits 11
were 11
boisterous 11
his 11
mind 11
exalted 11
he 11
was 11
now 11
at 11
his 11
worst 11
madder 11
than 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
earlier 11
in 11
the 11
night 11
mimi 11
trying 11
to 11
keep 11
as 11
far 11
from 11
him 11
as 11
possible 11
moved 11
across 11
the 11
stone 11
floor 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
and 11
found 11
a 11
niche 11
which 11
concealed 11
her 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
far 11
from 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
place 11
of 11
hiding 11
edgar 11
left 11
thus 11
alone 11
on 11
the 11
centre 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
found 11
himself 11
altogether 11
his 11
own 11
master 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
which 11
tended 11
to 11
increase 11
his 11
madness 11
he 11
knew 11
that 11
mimi 11
was 11
close 11
at 11
hand 11
though 11
he 11
had 11
lost 11
sight 11
of 11
her 11
he 11
spoke 11
loudly 11
and 11
the 11
sound 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
voice 11
though 11
it 11
was 11
carried 11
from 11
him 11
on 11
the 11
sweeping 11
wind 11
as 11
fast 11
as 11
the 11
words 11
were 11
spoken 11
seemed 11
to 11
exalt 11
him 11
still 11
more 11
even 11
the 11
raging 11
of 11
the 11
elements 11
round 11
him 11
appeared 11
to 11
add 11
to 11
his 11
exaltation 11
to 11
him 11
it 11
seemed 11
that 11
these 11
manifestations 11
were 11
obedient 11
to 11
his 11
own 11
will 11
he 11
had 11
reached 11
the 11
sublime 11
of 11
his 11
madness 11
he 11
was 11
now 11
in 11
his 11
own 11
mind 11
actually 11
the 11
almighty 11
and 11
whatever 11
might 11
happen 11
would 11
be 11
the 11
direct 11
carrying 11
out 11
of 11
his 11
own 11
commands 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
mimi 11
nor 11
fix 11
whereabout 11
she 11
was 11
he 11
shouted 11
loudly 11
come 11
to 11
me 11
you 11
shall 11
see 11
now 11
what 11
you 11
are 11
despising 11
what 11
you 11
are 11
warring 11
against 11
all 11
that 11
you 11

shall 11
be 11
when 11
the 11
master 11
of 11
evil 11
took 11
christ 11
up 11
on 11
a 11
high 11
place 11
and 11
showed 11
him 11
all 11
the 11
kingdoms 11
of 11
the 11
earth 11
he 11
was 11
doing 11
what 11

thought 11
no 11

light 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
very 11
ramparts 11
of 11
heaven 11
a 11
light 11
so 11
great 11
that 11
it 11
shall 11
dissipate 11
those 11
black 11
clouds 11
that 11
are 11
rushing 11
up 11
and 11
piling 11
around 11
us 11
look 11
look 11
at 11
the 11
very 11
touch 11
of 11
my 11
hand 11

light 11
springs 11
into 11
being 11
and 11
mounts 11
upand 11

up 11
he 11
made 11
his 11
way 11
whilst 11
he 11
was 11
speaking 11
to 11
the 11
corner 11
of 11
the 11
turret 11
whence 11
flew 11
the 11
giant 11
kite 11
and 11
from 11
which 11
the 11
runners 11
ascended 11
mimi 11
looked 11
on 11
appalled 11
and 11
afraid 11
to 11
speak 11
lest 11
she 11
should 11
precipitate 11
some 11
calamity 11
within 11
the 11
niche 11
lady 11
arabella 11
cowered 11
in 11
a 11
paroxysm 11
of 11
fear 11
edgar 11
took 11
up 11
a 11
small 11
wooden 11
box 11
through 11
a 11
hole 11
in 11
which 11
the 11
wire 11
of 11
the 11
runner 11
ran 11
this 11
evidently 11
set 11
some 11
machinery 11
in 11
motion 11
for 11
a 11
sound 11
as 11
of 11
whirring 11
came 11
from 11
one 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
box 11
floated 11
what 11
looked 11
like 11
a 11
piece 11
of 11
stiff 11
ribbon 11
which 11
snapped 11
and 11
crackled 11
as 11
the 11
wind 11
took 11
it 11
for 11
a 11
few 11
seconds 11
mimi 11
saw 11
it 11
as 11
it 11
rushed 11
along 11
the 11
sagging 11
line 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
when 11
close 11
to 11
it 11
there 11
was 11
a 11
loud 11
crack 11
and 11
a 11
sudden 11
light 11
appeared 11
to 11
issue 11
from 11
every 11
chink 11
in 11
the 11
box 11
then 11
a 11
quick 11
flame 11
flashed 11
along 11
the 11
snapping 11
ribbon 11
which 11
glowed 11
with 11
an 11
intense 11
lighta 11
light 11
so 11
great 11
that 11
the 11
whole 11
of 11
the 11
countryside 11
around 11
stood 11
out 11
against 11
the 11
background 11
of 11
black 11
driving 11
clouds 11
for 11
a 11
few 11
seconds 11
the 11
light 11
remained 11
then 11
suddenly 11
disappeared 11
in 11
the 11
blackness 11
around 11
it 11
was 11
simply 11
a 11
magnesium 11
light 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
fired 11
by 11
the 11
mechanism 11
within 11
the 11
box 11
and 11
carried 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
kite 11
edgar 11
was 11
in 11
a 11
state 11
of 11
tumultuous 11
excitement 11
shouting 11
and 11
yelling 11
at 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
his 11
voice 11
and 11
dancing 11
about 11
like 11
a 11
lunatic 11
this 11
was 11
more 11
than 11
lady 11
arabellas 11
curious 11
dual 11
nature 11
could 11
stand 11
the 11
ghoulish 11
element 11
in 11
her 11
rose 11
triumphant 11
and 11
she 11
abandoned 11
all 11
idea 11
of 11
marriage 11
with 11
edgar 11
caswall 11
gloating 11
fiendishly 11
over 11
the 11
thought 11
of 11
revenge 11
she 11
must 11
lure 11
him 11
to 11
the 11
white 11
worms 11
holebut 11
how 11
she 11
glanced 11
around 11
and 11
quickly 11
made 11
up 11
her 11
mind 11
the 11
mans 11
whole 11
thoughts 11
were 11
absorbed 11
by 11
his 11
wonderful 11
kite 11
which 11
he 11
was 11
showing 11
off 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
fascinate 11
her 11
imaginary 11
rival 11
mimi 11
on 11
the 11
instant 11
she 11
glided 11
through 11
the 11
darkness 11
to 11
the 11
wheel 11
whereon 11
the 11
string 11
of 11
the 11
kite 11
was 11
wound 11
with 11
deft 11
fingers 11
she 11
unshipped 11
this 11
took 11
it 11
with 11
her 11
reeling 11
out 11
the 11
wire 11
as 11
she 11
went 11
thus 11
keeping 11
in 11
a 11
way 11
in 11
touch 11
with 11
the 11
kite 11
then 11
she 11
glided 11
swiftly 11
to 11
the 11
wicket 11
through 11
which 11
she 11
passed 11
locking 11
the 11
gate 11
behind 11
her 11
as 11
she 11
went 11
down 11
the 11
turret 11
stair 11
she 11
ran 11
quickly 11
letting 11
the 11
wire 11
run 11
from 11
the 11
wheel 11
which 11
she 11
carried 11
carefully 11
and 11
passing 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
hurried 11
down 11
the 11
avenue 11
with 11
all 11
her 11
speed 11
she 11
soon 11
reached 11
her 11
own 11
gate 11
ran 11
down 11
the 11
avenue 11
and 11
with 11
her 11
key 11
opened 11
the 11
iron 11
door 11
leading 11
to 11
the 11

she 11
felt 11
well 11
satisfied 11
with 11

felt 11
that 11
she 11
might 11
pause 11
a 11
while 11
and 11
rest 11
she 11
tore 11
off 11
her 11
clothes 11
with 11
feverish 11
fingers 11
and 11
in 11
full 11

stretched 11
her 11

remained 11
for 11
a 11
while 11
in 11
their 11
places 11
on 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
caswall 11
because 11
he 11
had 11
nothing 11
to 11
say 11
mimi 11
because 11
she 11
had 11
much 11
to 11
say 11
and 11
wished 11
to 11
put 11
her 11
thoughts 11
in 11
order 11
for 11
quite 11
a 11
whilewhich 11
seemed 11
interminablesilence 11
reigned 11
between 11
them 11
at 11
last 11
mimi 11
made 11
a 11
beginningshe 11
had 11
made 11
up 11
her 11
mind 11
how 11
to 11
act 11
mr 11
caswall 11
she 11
said 11
loudly 11
so 11
as 11
to 11
make 11
sure 11
of 11
being 11
heard 11
through 11
the 11
blustering 11
of 11
the 11
wind 11
and 11
the 11
perpetual 11
cracking 11
of 11
the 11
electricity 11
caswall 11
said 11
something 11
in 11
reply 11
but 11
his 11
words 11
were 11
carried 11
away 11
on 11
the 11
storm 11
however 11
one 11
of 11
her 11
objects 11
was 11
effected 11
she 11
knew 11
now 11
exactly 11
whereabout 11
on 11
the 11
roof 11
he 11
was 11
so 11
she 11
moved 11
close 11
to 11
the 11
spot 11
before 11
she 11
spoke 11
again 11
raising 11
her 11
voice 11
almost 11
to 11
a 11
shout 11
the 11
wicket 11
is 11
shut 11
please 11
to 11
open 11
it 11
i 11
cant 11
get 11
out 11
as 11
she 11
spoke 11
she 11
was 11
quietly 11
fingering 11
a 11
revolver 11
which 11
adam 11
had 11
given 11
to 11
her 11
in 11
case 11
of 11
emergency 11
and 11
which 11
now 11
lay 11
in 11
her 11
breast 11
she 11
felt 11
that 11
she 11
was 11
caged 11
like 11
a 11
rat 11
in 11
a 11
trap 11
but 11
did 11
not 11
mean 11
to 11
be 11
taken 11
at 11
a 11
disadvantage 11
whatever 11
happened 11
caswall 11
also 11
felt 11
trapped 11
and 11
all 11
the 11
brute 11
in 11
him 11
rose 11
to 11
the 11
emergency 11
in 11
a 11
voice 11
which 11
was 11
raucous 11
and 11
brutalmuch 11
like 11
that 11
which 11
is 11
heard 11
when 11
a 11
wife 11
is 11
being 11
beaten 11
by 11
her 11
husband 11
in 11
a 11
slumhe 11
hissed 11
out 11
his 11
syllables 11
cutting 11
through 11
the 11
roaring 11
of 11
the 11
storm 11
you 11
came 11
of 11
your 11
own 11
accordwithout 11
permission 11
or 11
even 11
asking 11
it 11
now 11
you 11
can 11
stay 11
or 11
go 11
as 11
you 11
choose 11
but 11
you 11
must 11
manage 11
it 11
for 11
yourself 11
ill 11
have 11
nothing 11
to 11
do 11
with 11
it 11
her 11
answer 11
was 11
spoken 11
with 11
dangerous 11
suavity 11
i 11
am 11
going 11
blame 11
yourself 11
if 11
you 11
do 11
not 11
like 11
the 11
time 11
and 11
manner 11
of 11
it 11
i 11
daresay 11
adammy 11
husbandwill 11
have 11
a 11
word 11
to 11
say 11
to 11
you 11
about 11
it 11
let 11
him 11
say 11
and 11
be 11
damned 11
to 11
him 11
and 11
to 11
you 11
too 11
ill 11
show 11
you 11
a 11
light 11
you 11
shant 11
be 11
able 11
to 11
say 11
that 11
you 11
could 11
not 11
see 11
what 11
you 11
were 11
doing 11
as 11
he 11
spoke 11
he 11
was 11
lighting 11
another 11
piece 11
of 11
the 11
magnesium 11
ribbon 11
which 11
made 11
a 11
blinding 11
glare 11
in 11
which 11
everything 11
was 11
plainly 11
discernible 11
down 11
to 11
the 11
smallest 11
detail 11
this 11
exactly 11
suited 11
mimi 11
she 11
took 11
accurate 11
note 11
of 11
the 11
wicket 11
and 11
its 11
fastening 11
before 11
the 11
glare 11
had 11
died 11
away 11
she 11
took 11
her 11
revolver 11
out 11
and 11
fired 11
into 11
the 11
lock 11
which 11
was 11
shivered 11
on 11
the 11
instant 11
the 11
pieces 11
flying 11
round 11
in 11
all 11
directions 11
but 11
happily 11
without 11
causing 11
hurt 11
to 11
anyone 11
then 11
she 11
pushed 11
the 11
wicket 11
open 11
and 11
ran 11
down 11
the 11
narrow 11
stair 11
and 11
so 11
to 11
the 11
hall 11
door 11
opening 11
this 11
also 11
she 11
ran 11
down 11
the 11
avenue 11
never 11
lessening 11
her 11
speed 11
till 11
she 11
stood 11
outside 11
the 11
door 11
of 11
lesser 11
hill 11
the 11
door 11
was 11
opened 11
at 11
once 11
on 11
her 11
ringing 11
is 11
mr 11
adam 11
salton 11
in 11
she 11
asked 11
he 11
has 11
just 11
come 11
in 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
ago 11
he 11
has 11
gone 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
study 11
replied 11
a 11
servant 11
she 11
ran 11
upstairs 11
at 11
once 11
and 11
joined 11
him 11
he 11
seemed 11
relieved 11
when 11
he 11
saw 11
her 11
but 11
scrutinised 11
her 11
face 11
keenly 11
he 11
saw 11
that 11
she 11
had 11
been 11
in 11
some 11
concern 11
so 11
led 11
her 11
over 11
to 11
the 11
sofa 11
in 11
the 11
window 11
and 11
sat 11
down 11
beside 11
her 11
now 11
dear 11
tell 11
me 11
all 11
about 11
it 11
he 11
said 11
she 11
rushed 11
breathlessly 11
through 11
all 11
the 11
details 11
of 11
her 11
adventure 11
on 11
the 11
turret 11
roof 11
adam 11
listened 11
attentively 11
helping 11
her 11
all 11
he 11
could 11
and 11
not 11
embarrassing 11
her 11
by 11
any 11
questioning 11
his 11
thoughtful 11
silence 11
was 11
a 11
great 11
help 11
to 11
her 11
for 11
it 11
allowed 11
her 11
to 11
collect 11
and 11
organise 11
her 11
thoughts 11
i 11
must 11
go 11
and 11
see 11
caswall 11
tomorrow 11
to 11
hear 11
what 11
he 11
has 11
to 11
say 11
on 11
the 11
subject 11
but 11
dear 11
for 11
my 11
sake 11
dont 11
have 11
any 11
quarrel 11
with 11
mr 11
caswall 11
i 11
have 11
had 11
too 11
much 11
trial 11
and 11
pain 11
lately 11
to 11
wish 11
it 11
increased 11
by 11
any 11
anxiety 11
regarding 11
you 11
you 11
shall 11
not 11
dearif 11
i 11
can 11
help 11
itplease 11
god 11
he 11
said 11
solemnly 11
and 11
he 11
kissed 11
her 11
then 11
in 11
order 11
to 11
keep 11
her 11
interested 11
so 11
that 11
she 11
might 11
forget 11
the 11
fears 11
and 11
anxieties 11
that 11
had 11
disturbed 11
her 11
he 11
began 11
to 11
talk 11
over 11
the 11
details 11
of 11
her 11
adventure 11
making 11
shrewd 11
comments 11
which 11
attracted 11
and 11
held 11
her 11
attention 11
presently 11
inter 11
alia 11
he 11
said 11
thats 11
a 11
dangerous 11
game 11
caswall 11
is 11
up 11
to 11
it 11
seems 11
to 11
me 11
that 11
that 11
young 11
manthough 11
he 11
doesnt 11
appear 11
to 11
know 11
itis 11
riding 11
for 11
a 11
fall 11
how 11
dear 11
i 11
dont 11
understand 11
kite 11
flying 11
on 11
a 11
night 11
like 11
this 11
from 11
a 11
place 11
like 11
the 11
tower 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
is 11
to 11
say 11
the 11
least 11
of 11
it 11
dangerous 11
it 11
is 11
not 11
merely 11
courting 11
death 11
or 11
other 11
accident 11
from 11
lightning 11
but 11
it 11
is 11
bringing 11
the 11
lightning 11
into 11
where 11
he 11
lives 11
every 11
cloud 11
that 11
is 11
blowing 11
up 11
hereand 11
they 11
all 11
make 11
for 11
the 11
highest 11
pointis 11
bound 11
to 11
develop 11
into 11
a 11
flash 11
of 11
lightning 11
that 11
kite 11
is 11
up 11
in 11
the 11
air 11
and 11
is 11
bound 11
to 11
attract 11
the 11
lightning 11
its 11
cord 11
makes 11
a 11
road 11
for 11
it 11
on 11
which 11
to 11
travel 11
to 11
earth 11
when 11
it 11
does 11
come 11
it 11
will 11
strike 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
tower 11
with 11
a 11
weight 11
a 11
hundred 11
times 11
greater 11
than 11
a 11
whole 11
park 11
of 11
artillery 11
and 11
will 11
knock 11
castra 11
regis 11
into 11
pieces 11
where 11
it 11
will 11
go 11
after 11
that 11
no 11
one 11
can 11
tell 11
if 11
there 11
should 11
be 11
any 11
metal 11
by 11
which 11
it 11
can 11
travel 11
such 11
will 11
not 11
only 11
point 11
the 11
road 11
but 11
be 11
the 11
road 11
itself 11
would 11
it 11
be 11
dangerous 11
to 11
be 11
out 11
in 11
the 11
open 11
air 11
when 11
such 11
a 11
thing 11
is 11
taking 11
place 11
she 11
asked 11
no 11
little 11
woman 11
it 11
would 11
be 11
the 11
safest 11
possible 11
placeso 11
long 11
as 11
one 11
was 11
not 11
in 11
the 11
line 11
of 11
the 11
electric 11
current 11
then 11
do 11
let 11
us 11
go 11
outside 11
i 11
dont 11
want 11
to 11
run 11
into 11
any 11
foolish 11
dangeror 11
far 11
more 11
to 11
ask 11
you 11
to 11
do 11
so 11
but 11
surely 11
if 11
the 11
open 11
is 11
safest 11
that 11
is 11
the 11
place 11
for 11
us 11
without 11
another 11
word 11
she 11
put 11
on 11
again 11
the 11
cloak 11
she 11
had 11
thrown 11
off 11
and 11
a 11
small 11
tightfitting 11
cap 11
adam 11
too 11
put 11
on 11
his 11
cap 11
and 11
after 11
seeing 11
that 11
his 11
revolver 11
was 11
all 11
right 11
gave 11
her 11
his 11
hand 11
and 11
they 11
left 11
the 11
house 11
together 11
i 11
think 11
the 11
best 11
thing 11
we 11
can 11
do 11
will 11
be 11
to 11
go 11
round 11
all 11
the 11
places 11
which 11
are 11
mixed 11
up 11
in 11
this 11
affair 11
all 11
right 11
dear 11
i 11
am 11
ready 11
but 11
if 11
you 11
dont 11
mind 11
we 11
might 11
go 11
first 11
to 11
mercy 11
i 11
am 11
anxious 11
about 11
grandfather 11
and 11
we 11
might 11
see 11
thatas 11
yet 11
at 11
all 11
eventsnothing 11
has 11
happened 11
there 11
so 11
they 11
went 11
on 11
the 11
highhung 11
road 11
along 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
the 11
wind 11
here 11
was 11
of 11
great 11
force 11
and 11
made 11
a 11
strange 11
booming 11
noise 11
as 11
it 11
swept 11
high 11
overhead 11
though 11
not 11
the 11
sound 11
of 11
cracking 11
and 11
tearing 11
as 11
it 11
passed 11
through 11
the 11
woods 11
of 11
high 11
slender 11
trees 11
which 11
grew 11
on 11
either 11
side 11
of 11
the 11
road 11
mimi 11
could 11
hardly 11
keep 11
her 11
feet 11
she 11
was 11
not 11
afraid 11
but 11
the 11
force 11
to 11
which 11
she 11
was 11
opposed 11
gave 11
her 11
a 11
good 11
excuse 11
to 11
hold 11
on 11
to 11
her 11
husband 11
extra 11
tight 11
at 11
mercy 11
there 11
was 11
no 11
one 11
upat 11
least 11
all 11
the 11
lights 11
were 11
out 11
but 11
to 11
mimi 11
accustomed 11
to 11
the 11
nightly 11
routine 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
there 11
were 11
manifest 11
signs 11
that 11
all 11
was 11
well 11
except 11
in 11
the 11
little 11
room 11
on 11
the 11
first 11
floor 11
where 11
the 11
blinds 11
were 11
down 11
mimi 11
could 11
not 11
bear 11
to 11
look 11
at 11
that 11
to 11
think 11
of 11
it 11
adam 11
understood 11
her 11
pain 11
for 11
he 11
had 11
been 11
keenly 11
interested 11
in 11
poor 11
lilla 11
he 11
bent 11
over 11
and 11
kissed 11
her 11
and 11
then 11
took 11
her 11
hand 11
and 11
held 11
it 11
hard 11
thus 11
they 11
passed 11
on 11
together 11
returning 11
to 11
the 11
high 11
road 11
towards 11
castra 11
regis 11
at 11
the 11
gate 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
they 11
were 11
extra 11
careful 11
when 11
drawing 11
near 11
adam 11
stumbled 11
upon 11
the 11
wire 11
that 11
lady 11
arabella 11
had 11
left 11
trailing 11
on 11
the 11
ground 11
adam 11
drew 11
his 11
breath 11
at 11
this 11
and 11
spoke 11
in 11
a 11
low 11
earnest 11
whisper 11
i 11
dont 11
want 11
to 11
frighten 11
you 11
mimi 11
dear 11
but 11
wherever 11
that 11
wire 11
is 11
there 11
is 11
danger 11
danger 11
how 11
that 11
is 11
the 11
track 11
where 11
the 11
lightning 11
will 11
go 11
at 11
any 11
moment 11
even 11
now 11
whilst 11
we 11
are 11
speaking 11
and 11
searching 11
a 11
fearful 11
force 11
may 11
be 11
loosed 11
upon 11
us 11
run 11
on 11
dear 11
you 11
know 11
the 11
way 11
to 11
where 11
the 11
avenue 11
joins 11
the 11
highroad 11
if 11
you 11
see 11
any 11
sign 11
of 11
the 11
wire 11
keep 11
away 11
from 11
it 11
for 11
gods 11
sake 11
i 11
shall 11
join 11
you 11
at 11
the 11
gateway 11
are 11
you 11
going 11
to 11
follow 11
that 11
wire 11
alone 11
yes 11
dear 11
one 11
is 11
sufficient 11
for 11
that 11
work 11
i 11
shall 11
not 11
lose 11
a 11
moment 11
till 11
i 11
am 11
with 11
you 11
adam 11
when 11
i 11
came 11
with 11
you 11
into 11
the 11
open 11
my 11
main 11
wish 11
was 11
that 11
we 11
should 11
be 11
together 11
if 11
anything 11
serious 11
happened 11
you 11
wouldnt 11
deny 11
me 11
that 11
right 11
would 11
you 11
dear 11
no 11
dear 11
not 11
that 11
or 11
any 11
right 11
thank 11
god 11
that 11
my 11
wife 11
has 11
such 11
a 11
wish 11
come 11
we 11
will 11
go 11
together 11
we 11
are 11
in 11
the 11
hands 11
of 11
god 11
if 11
he 11
wishes 11
we 11
shall 11
be 11
together 11
at 11
the 11
end 11
whenever 11
or 11
wherever 11
that 11
may 11
be 11
they 11
picked 11
up 11
the 11
trail 11
of 11
the 11
wire 11
on 11
the 11
steps 11
and 11
followed 11
it 11
down 11
the 11
avenue 11
taking 11
care 11
not 11
to 11
touch 11
it 11
with 11
their 11
feet 11
it 11
was 11
easy 11
enough 11
to 11
follow 11
for 11
the 11
wire 11
if 11
not 11
bright 11
was 11
self 11
coloured 11
and 11
showed 11
clearly 11
they 11
followed 11
it 11
out 11
of 11
the 11
gateway 11
and 11
into 11
the 11
avenue 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
here 11
a 11
new 11
gravity 11
clouded 11
adams 11
face 11
though 11
mimi 11
saw 11
no 11
cause 11
for 11
fresh 11
concern 11
this 11
was 11
easily 11
enough 11
explained 11
adam 11
knew 11
of 11
the 11
explosive 11
works 11
in 11
progress 11
regarding 11
the 11
wellhole 11
but 11
the 11
matter 11
had 11
been 11
kept 11
from 11
his 11
wife 11
as 11
they 11
stood 11
near 11
the 11
house 11
adam 11
asked 11
mimi 11
to 11
return 11
to 11
the 11
road 11
ostensibly 11
to 11
watch 11
the 11
course 11
of 11
the 11
wire 11
telling 11
her 11
that 11
there 11
might 11
be 11
a 11
branch 11
wire 11
leading 11
somewhere 11
else 11
she 11
was 11
to 11
search 11
the 11
undergrowth 11
and 11
if 11
she 11
found 11
it 11
was 11
to 11
warn 11
him 11
by 11
the 11
australian 11
native 11
cooee 11
whilst 11
they 11
were 11
standing 11
together 11
there 11
came 11
a 11
blinding 11
flash 11
of 11
lightning 11
which 11
lit 11
up 11
for 11
several 11
seconds 11
the 11
whole 11
area 11
of 11
earth 11
and 11
sky 11
it 11
was 11
only 11
the 11
first 11
note 11
of 11
the 11
celestial 11
prelude 11
for 11
it 11
was 11
followed 11
in 11
quick 11
succession 11
by 11
numerous 11
flashes 11
whilst 11
the 11
crash 11
and 11
roll 11
of 11
thunder 11
seemed 11
continuous 11
adam 11
appalled 11
drew 11
his 11
wife 11
to 11
him 11
and 11
held 11
her 11
close 11
as 11
far 11
as 11
he 11
could 11
estimate 11
by 11
the 11
interval 11
between 11
lightning 11
and 11
thunder 11
clap 11
the 11
heart 11
of 11
the 11
storm 11
was 11
still 11
some 11
distance 11
off 11
so 11
he 11
felt 11
no 11
present 11
concern 11
for 11
their 11
safety 11
still 11
it 11
was 11
apparent 11
that 11
the 11
course 11
of 11
the 11
storm 11
was 11
moving 11
swiftly 11
in 11
their 11
direction 11
the 11
lightning 11
flashes 11
came 11
faster 11
and 11
faster 11
and 11
closer 11
together 11
the 11
thunderroll 11
was 11
almost 11
continuous 11
not 11
stopping 11
for 11
a 11
momenta 11
new 11
crash 11
beginning 11
before 11
the 11
old 11
one 11
had 11
ceased 11
adam 11
kept 11
looking 11
up 11
in 11
the 11
direction 11
where 11
the 11
kite 11
strained 11
and 11
struggled 11
at 11
its 11
detaining 11
cord 11
but 11
of 11
course 11
the 11
dull 11
evening 11
light 11
prevented 11
any 11
distinct 11
scrutiny 11
at 11
length 11
there 11
came 11
a 11
flash 11
so 11
appallingly 11
bright 11
that 11
in 11
its 11
glare 11
nature 11
seemed 11
to 11
be 11
standing 11
still 11
so 11
long 11
did 11
it 11
last 11
that 11
there 11
was 11
time 11
to 11
distinguish 11
its 11
configuration 11
it 11
seemed 11
like 11
a 11
mighty 11
tree 11
inverted 11
pendent 11
from 11
the 11
sky 11
the 11
whole 11
country 11
around 11
within 11
the 11
angle 11
of 11
vision 11
was 11
lit 11
up 11
till 11
it 11
seemed 11
to 11
glow 11
then 11
a 11
broad 11
ribbon 11
of 11
fire 11
seemed 11
to 11
drop 11
on 11
to 11
the 11
tower 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
just 11
as 11
the 11
thunder 11
crashed 11
by 11
the 11
glare 11
adam 11
could 11
see 11
the 11
tower 11
shake 11
and 11
tremble 11
and 11
finally 11
fall 11
to 11
pieces 11
like 11
a 11
house 11
of 11
cards 11
the 11
passing 11
of 11
the 11
lightning 11
left 11
the 11
sky 11
again 11
dark 11
but 11
a 11
blue 11
flame 11
fell 11
downward 11
from 11
the 11
tower 11
and 11
with 11
inconceivable 11
rapidity 11
running 11
along 11
the 11
ground 11
in 11
the 11
direction 11
of 11
dianas 11
grove 11
reached 11
the 11
dark 11
silent 11
house 11
which 11
in 11
the 11
instant 11
burst 11
into 11
flame 11
at 11
a 11
hundred 11
different 11
points 11
at 11
the 11
same 11
moment 11
there 11
rose 11
from 11
the 11
house 11
a 11
rending 11
crashing 11
sound 11
of 11
woodwork 11
broken 11
or 11
thrown 11
about 11
mixed 11
with 11
a 11
quick 11
scream 11
so 11
appalling 11
that 11
adam 11
stout 11
of 11
heart 11
as 11
he 11
undoubtedly 11
was 11
felt 11
his 11
blood 11
turn 11
into 11
ice 11
instinctively 11
despite 11
the 11
danger 11
and 11
their 11
consciousness 11
of 11
it 11
husband 11
and 11
wife 11
took 11
hands 11
and 11
listened 11
trembling 11
something 11
was 11
going 11
on 11
close 11
to 11
them 11
mysterious 11
terrible 11
deadly 11
the 11
shrieks 11
continued 11
though 11
less 11
sharp 11
in 11
sound 11
as 11
though 11
muffled 11
in 11
the 11
midst 11
of 11
them 11
was 11
a 11
terrific 11
explosion 11
seemingly 11
from 11
deep 11
in 11
the 11
earth 11
the 11
flames 11
from 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
from 11
dianas 11
grove 11
made 11
all 11
around 11
almost 11
as 11
light 11
as 11
day 11
and 11
now 11
that 11
the 11
lightning 11
had 11
ceased 11
to 11
flash 11
their 11
eyes 11
unblinded 11
were 11
able 11
to 11
judge 11
both 11
perspective 11
and 11
detail 11
the 11
heat 11
of 11
the 11
burning 11
house 11
caused 11
the 11
iron 11
doors 11
to 11
warp 11
and 11
collapse 11
seemingly 11
of 11
their 11
own 11
accord 11
they 11
fell 11
open 11
and 11
exposed 11
the 11
interior 11
the 11
saltons 11
could 11
now 11
look 11
through 11
to 11
the 11
room 11
beyond 11
where 11
the 11
wellhole 11
yawned 11
a 11
deep 11
narrow 11
circular 11
chasm 11
from 11
this 11
the 11
agonised 11
shrieks 11
were 11
rising 11
growing 11
ever 11
more 11
terrible 11
with 11
each 11
second 11
that 11
passed 11
but 11
it 11
was 11
not 11
only 11
the 11
heartrending 11
sound 11
that 11
almost 11
paralysed 11
poor 11
mimi 11
with 11
terror 11
what 11
she 11
saw 11
was 11
sufficient 11
to 11
fill 11
her 11
with 11
evil 11
dreams 11
for 11
the 11
remainder 11
of 11
her 11
life 11
the 11
whole 11
place 11
looked 11
as 11
if 11
a 11
sea 11
of 11
blood 11
had 11
been 11
beating 11
against 11
it 11
each 11
of 11
the 11
explosions 11
from 11
below 11
had 11
thrown 11
out 11
from 11
the 11
wellhole 11
as 11
if 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
the 11
mouth 11
of 11
a 11
cannon 11
a 11
mass 11
of 11
fine 11
sand 11
mixed 11
with 11
blood 11
and 11
a 11
horrible 11
repulsive 11
slime 11
in 11
which 11
were 11
great 11
red 11
masses 11
of 11
rent 11
and 11
torn 11
flesh 11
and 11
fat 11
as 11
the 11
explosions 11
kept 11
on 11
more 11
and 11
more 11
of 11
this 11
repulsive 11
mass 11
was 11
shot 11
up 11
the 11
great 11
bulk 11
of 11
it 11
falling 11
back 11
again 11
many 11
of 11
the 11
awful 11
fragments 11
were 11
of 11
something 11
which 11
had 11
lately 11
been 11
alive 11
they 11
quivered 11
and 11
trembled 11
and 11
writhed 11
as 11
though 11
they 11
were 11
still 11
in 11
torment 11
a 11
supposition 11
to 11
which 11
the 11
unending 11
scream 11
gave 11
a 11
horrible 11
credence 11
at 11
moments 11
some 11
mountainous 11
mass 11
of 11
flesh 11
surged 11
up 11
through 11
the 11
narrow 11
orifice 11
as 11
though 11
forced 11

of 11
these 11
fragments 11
were 11
partially 11
covered 11
with 11
white 11
skin 11

of 11

rose 11
after 11
the 11
manner 11
of 11
a 11
bubbling 11
spring 11
and 11
adam 11
saw 11
part 11
of 11
the 11
thin 11
form 11
of 11
lady 11
arabella 11
forced 11
up 11
to 11
the 11
top 11
amid 11
a 11
mass 11
of 11
blood 11
and 11
slime 11
and 11
what 11
looked 11
as 11
if 11
it 11
had 11
been 11
the 11
entrails 11
of 11
a 11
monster 11
torn 11
into 11
shreds 11
several 11
times 11
some 11
masses 11
of 11
enormous 11
bulk 11
were 11
forced 11
up 11
through 11
the 11
wellhole 11
with 11
inconceivable 11
violence 11
and 11
suddenly 11
expanding 11
as 11
they 11
came 11
into 11
larger 11
space 11
disclosed 11
sections 11
of 11
the 11
white 11
worm 11
which 11
adam 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
had 11
seen 11
looking 11
over 11
the 11
trees 11
with 11
its 11
enormous 11
eyes 11
of 11
emerald 11
green 11
flickering 11
like 11
great 11
lamps 11
in 11
a 11
gale 11
at 11
last 11
the 11
explosive 11
power 11
which 11
was 11
not 11
yet 11
exhausted 11
evidently 11
reached 11
the 11
main 11
store 11
of 11
dynamite 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
lowered 11
into 11
the 11
worm 11
hole 11
the 11
result 11
was 11
appalling 11
the 11
ground 11
for 11
far 11
around 11
quivered 11
and 11
opened 11
in 11
long 11
deep 11
chasms 11
whose 11
edges 11
shook 11
and 11
fell 11
in 11
throwing 11
up 11
clouds 11
of 11
sand 11
which 11
fell 11
back 11
and 11
hissed 11
amongst 11
the 11
rising 11
water 11
the 11
heavily 11
built 11
house 11
shook 11
to 11
its 11
foundations 11
great 11
stones 11
were 11
thrown 11
up 11
as 11
from 11
a 11
volcano 11
some 11
of 11
them 11
great 11
masses 11
of 11
hard 11
stone 11
squared 11
and 11
grooved 11
with 11
implements 11
wrought 11
by 11
human 11
hands 11
breaking 11
up 11
and 11
splitting 11
in 11
mid 11

riven 11
by 11
some 11
infernal 11
power 11

near 11
the 11
houseand 11
therefore 11
presumably 11
in 11
some 11
way 11
above 11
the 11
hole 11
which 11
sent 11
up 11
clouds 11
of 11
dust 11
and 11
steam 11
and 11
fine 11
sand 11
mingled 11
and 11
which 11
carried 11
an 11
appalling 11
stench 11
which 11
sickened 11
the 11
spectatorswere 11
torn 11
up 11
by 11
the 11
roots 11
and 11
hurled 11
into 11
the 11
air 11
by 11
now 11
flames 11
were 11
bursting 11
violently 11
from 11
all 11
over 11
the 11
ruins 11
so 11
dangerously 11
that 11
adam 11
caught 11
up 11
his 11
wife 11
in 11
his 11
arms 11
and 11
ran 11
with 11
her 11
from 11
the 11
proximity 11
of 11
the 11
flames 11
then 11
almost 11
as 11
quickly 11
as 11
it 11
had 11
begun 11
the 11
whole 11
cataclysm 11
ceased 11
though 11
a 11
deepdown 11
rumbling 11
continued 11
intermittently 11
for 11
some 11
time 11
then 11
silence 11
brooded 11
over 11
allsilence 11
so 11
complete 11
that 11
it 11
seemed 11
in 11
itself 11
a 11
sentient 11
thingsilence 11
which 11
seemed 11
like 11
incarnate 11
darkness 11
and 11
conveyed 11
the 11
same 11
idea 11
to 11
all 11
who 11
came 11
within 11
its 11
radius 11
to 11
the 11
young 11
people 11
who 11
had 11
suffered 11
the 11
long 11
horror 11
of 11
that 11
awful 11
night 11
it 11
brought 11
reliefrelief 11
from 11
the 11
presence 11
or 11
the 11
fear 11
of 11
all 11
that 11
was 11
horriblerelief 11
which 11
seemed 11
perfected 11
when 11
the 11
red 11
rays 11
of 11
sunrise 11
shot 11
up 11
over 11
the 11
far 11
eastern 11
sea 11
bringing 11
a 11
promise 11
of 11
a 11
new 11
order 11
of 11
things 11
with 11
the 11
coming 11
day 11
his 11
bed 11
saw 11
little 11
of 11
adam 11
salton 11
for 11
the 11
remainder 11
of 11
that 11
night 11
he 11
and 11
mimi 11
walked 11
hand 11
in 11
hand 11
in 11
the 11
brightening 11
dawn 11
round 11
by 11
the 11
brow 11
to 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
on 11
to 11
lesser 11
hill 11
they 11
did 11
so 11
deliberately 11
in 11
an 11
attempt 11
to 11
think 11
as 11
little 11
as 11
possible 11
of 11
the 11
terrible 11
experiences 11
of 11
the 11
night 11
the 11
morning 11
was 11
bright 11
and 11
cheerful 11
as 11
a 11
morning 11
sometimes 11
is 11
after 11
a 11
devastating 11
storm 11
the 11
clouds 11
of 11
which 11
there 11
were 11
plenty 11
in 11
evidence 11
brought 11
no 11
lingering 11
idea 11
of 11
gloom 11
all 11
nature 11
was 11
bright 11
and 11
joyous 11
being 11
in 11
striking 11
contrast 11
to 11
the 11
scenes 11
of 11
wreck 11
and 11
devastation 11
the 11
effects 11
of 11
obliterating 11
fire 11
and 11
lasting 11
ruin 11
the 11
only 11
evidence 11
of 11
the 11
once 11
stately 11
pile 11
of 11
castra 11
regis 11
and 11
its 11
inhabitants 11
was 11
a 11
shapeless 11
huddle 11
of 11
shattered 11
architecture 11
dimly 11
seen 11
as 11
the 11
keen 11
breeze 11
swept 11
aside 11
the 11
cloud 11
of 11
acrid 11
smoke 11
which 11
marked 11
the 11
site 11
of 11
the 11
once 11
lordly 11
castle 11
as 11
for 11
dianas 11
grove 11
they 11
looked 11
in 11
vain 11
for 11
a 11
sign 11
which 11
had 11
a 11
suggestion 11
of 11
permanence 11
the 11
oak 11
trees 11
of 11
the 11
grove 11
were 11
still 11
to 11
be 11
seensome 11
of 11
them 11
emerging 11
from 11
a 11
haze 11
of 11
smoke 11
the 11
great 11
trunks 11
solid 11
and 11
erect 11
as 11
ever 11
but 11
the 11
larger 11
branches 11
broken 11
and 11
twisted 11
and 11
rent 11
with 11
bark 11
stripped 11
and 11
chipped 11
and 11
the 11
smaller 11
branches 11
broken 11
and 11
dishevelled 11
looking 11
from 11
the 11
constant 11
stress 11
and 11
threshing 11
of 11
the 11
storm 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
as 11
such 11
there 11
was 11
even 11
at 11
the 11
short 11
distance 11
from 11
which 11
they 11
looked 11
no 11
trace 11
adam 11
resolutely 11
turned 11
his 11
back 11
on 11
the 11
devastation 11
and 11
hurried 11
on 11
mimi 11
was 11
not 11
only 11
upset 11
and 11
shocked 11
in 11
many 11
ways 11
but 11
she 11
was 11
physically 11
dog 11
tired 11
and 11
falling 11
asleep 11
on 11
her 11
feet 11
adam 11
took 11
her 11
to 11
her 11
room 11
and 11
made 11
her 11
undress 11
and 11
get 11
into 11
bed 11
taking 11
care 11
that 11
the 11
room 11
was 11
well 11
lighted 11
both 11
by 11
sunshine 11
and 11
lamps 11
the 11
only 11
obstruction 11
was 11
from 11
a 11
silk 11
curtain 11
drawn 11
across 11
the 11
window 11
to 11
keep 11
out 11
the 11
glare 11
he 11
sat 11
beside 11
her 11
holding 11
her 11
hand 11
well 11
knowing 11
that 11
the 11
comfort 11
of 11
his 11
presence 11
was 11
the 11
best 11
restorative 11
for 11
her 11
he 11
stayed 11
with 11
her 11
till 11
sleep 11
had 11
overmastered 11
her 11
wearied 11
body 11
then 11
he 11
went 11
softly 11
away 11
he 11
found 11
his 11
uncle 11
and 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
in 11
the 11
study 11
having 11
an 11
early 11
cup 11
of 11
tea 11
amplified 11
to 11
the 11
dimensions 11
of 11
a 11
possible 11
breakfast 11
adam 11
explained 11
that 11
he 11
had 11
not 11
told 11
his 11
wife 11
that 11
he 11
was 11
going 11
over 11
the 11
horrible 11
places 11
again 11
lest 11
it 11
should 11
frighten 11
her 11
for 11
the 11
rest 11
and 11
sleep 11
in 11
ignorance 11
would 11
help 11
her 11
and 11
make 11
a 11
gap 11
of 11
peacefulness 11
between 11
the 11
horrors 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
agreed 11
we 11
know 11
my 11
boy 11
he 11
said 11
that 11
the 11
unfortunate 11
lady 11
arabella 11
is 11
dead 11
and 11
that 11
the 11
foul 11
carcase 11
of 11
the 11
worm 11
has 11
been 11
torn 11
to 11
pieces 11
pray 11
god 11
that 11
its 11
evil 11
soul 11
will 11
never 11
more 11
escape 11
from 11
the 11
nethermost 11
hell 11
they 11
visited 11
dianas 11
grove 11
first 11
not 11
only 11
because 11
it 11
was 11
nearer 11
but 11
also 11
because 11
it 11
was 11
the 11
place 11
where 11
most 11
description 11
was 11
required 11
and 11
adam 11
felt 11
that 11
he 11
could 11
tell 11
his 11
story 11
best 11
on 11
the 11
spot 11
the 11
absolute 11
destruction 11
of 11
the 11
place 11
and 11
everything 11
in 11
it 11
seen 11
in 11
the 11
broad 11
daylight 11
was 11
almost 11
inconceivable 11
to 11
sir 11
nathaniel 11
it 11
was 11
as 11
a 11
story 11
of 11
horror 11
full 11
and 11
complete 11
but 11
to 11
adam 11
it 11
was 11
as 11
it 11
were 11
only 11
on 11
the 11
fringes 11
he 11
knew 11
what 11
was 11
still 11
to 11
be 11
seen 11
when 11
his 11
friends 11
had 11
got 11
over 11
the 11
knowledge 11
of 11
externals 11
as 11
yet 11
they 11
had 11
only 11
seen 11
the 11
outside 11
of 11
the 11
houseor 11
rather 11
where 11
the 11
outside 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
once 11
had 11
been 11
the 11
great 11
horror 11
lay 11
within 11
however 11
ageand 11
the 11
experience 11
of 11
agecounts 11
a 11
strange 11
almost 11
elemental 11
change 11
in 11
the 11
aspect 11
had 11
taken 11
place 11
in 11
the 11
time 11
which 11
had 11
elapsed 11
since 11
the 11
dawn 11
it 11
would 11
almost 11
seem 11
as 11
if 11
nature 11
herself 11
had 11
tried 11
to 11
obliterate 11
the 11
evil 11
signs 11
of 11
what 11
had 11
occurred 11
true 11
the 11
utter 11
ruin 11
of 11
the 11
house 11
was 11
made 11
even 11
more 11
manifest 11
in 11
the 11
searching 11
daylight 11
but 11
the 11
more 11
appalling 11
destruction 11
which 11
lay 11
beneath 11
was 11
not 11
visible 11
the 11
rent 11
torn 11
and 11
dislocated 11
stonework 11
looked 11
worse 11
than 11
before 11
the 11
upheaved 11
foundations 11
the 11
piledup 11
fragments 11
of 11
masonry 11
the 11
fissures 11

were 11
at 11
the 11
worst 11
the 11
worms 11
hole 11
was 11
still 11
evident 11
a 11
round 11
fissure 11
seemingly 11
leading 11
down 11
into 11
the 11
very 11
bowels 11
of 11
the 11
earth 11
but 11
all 11
the 11
horrid 11
mass 11
of 11
blood 11
and 11
slime 11
of 11
torn 11
evilsmelling 11
flesh 11
and 11
the 11
sickening 11
remnants 11
of 11
violent 11
death 11
were 11
gone 11
either 11
some 11
of 11
the 11
later 11
explosions 11
had 11
thrown 11
up 11
from 11
the 11
deep 11
quantities 11
of 11
water 11
which 11
though 11
foul 11
and 11
corrupt 11
itself 11
had 11
still 11
some 11
cleansing 11
power 11
left 11
or 11
else 11
the 11
writhing 11
mass 11
which 11
stirred 11
from 11
far 11
below 11
had 11
helped 11
to 11
drag 11
down 11
and 11
obliterate 11
the 11
items 11
of 11
horror 11
a 11
grey 11
dust 11
partly 11
of 11
fine 11
sand 11
partly 11
of 11
the 11
waste 11
of 11
the 11
falling 11
ruin 11
covered 11
everything 11
and 11
though 11
ghastly 11
itself 11
helped 11
to 11
mask 11
something 11
still 11
worse 11
after 11
a 11
few 11
minutes 11
of 11
watching 11
it 11
became 11
apparent 11
to 11
the 11
three 11
men 11
that 11
the 11
turmoil 11
far 11
below 11
had 11
not 11
yet 11
ceased 11
at 11
short 11
irregular 11
intervals 11
the 11
hellbroth 11
in 11
the 11
hole 11
seemed 11
as 11
if 11
boiling 11
up 11
it 11
rose 11
and 11
fell 11
again 11
and 11
turned 11
over 11
showing 11
in 11
fresh 11
form 11
much 11
of 11
the 11
nauseous 11
detail 11
which 11
had 11
been 11
visible 11
earlier 11
the 11
worst 11
parts 11
were 11
the 11
great 11
masses 11
of 11
the 11
flesh 11
of 11
the 11
monstrous 11
worm 11
in 11
all 11
its 11
red 11
and 11
sickening 11
aspect 11
such 11
fragments 11
had 11
been 11
bad 11
enough 11
before 11
but 11
now 11
they 11
were 11
infinitely 11
worse 11
corruption 11
comes 11
with 11
startling 11
rapidity 11
to 11
beings 11
whose 11
destruction 11
has 11
been 11
due 11
wholly 11
or 11
in 11
part 11
to 11
lightningthe 11
whole 11
mass 11
seemed 11
to 11
have 11
become 11
all 11
at 11
once 11
corrupt 11
the 11
whole 11
surface 11
of 11
the 11
fragments 11
once 11
alive 11
was 11
covered 11
with 11
insects 11
worms 11
and 11
vermin 11
of 11
all 11
kinds 11
the 11
sight 11
was 11
horrible 11
enough 11
but 11
with 11
the 11
awful 11
smell 11
added 11
was 11
simply 11
unbearable 11
the 11
worms 11
hole 11
appeared 11
to 11
breathe 11
forth 11
death 11
in 11
its 11
most 11
repulsive 11
forms 11
the 11
friends 11
with 11
one 11
impulse 11
moved 11
to 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
where 11
a 11
fresh 11
breeze 11
from 11
the 11
sea 11
was 11
blowing 11
up 11
at 11
the 11
top 11
of 11
the 11
brow 11
beneath 11
them 11
as 11
they 11
looked 11
down 11
they 11
saw 11
a 11
shining 11
mass 11
of 11
white 11
which 11
looked 11
strangely 11
out 11
of 11
place 11
amongst 11
such 11
wreckage 11
as 11
they 11
had 11
been 11
viewing 11
it 11
appeared 11
so 11
strange 11

trying 11
to 11

a 11

orange 12

with 12

of 12
what 12

next 12
he 12
flicked 12
the 12

and 12
the 12
house 12
jumped 12
up 12
in 12
a 12

burned 12

shove 12

on 12
a 12

in 12
the 12

while 12
the 12
flapping 12
pigeonwinged 12
books 12
died 12
on 12
the 12
porch 12
and 12
lawn 12
of 12
the 12
house 12
while 12
the 12
books 12
went 12
up 12
in 12
sparkling 12

and 12
blew 12
away 12

the 12
fierce 12

all 12
men 12
singed 12
and 12
driven 12
back 12
by 12
flame 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
when 12
he 12
returned 12
to 12
the 12
firehouse 12
he 12
might 12
wink 12
at 12
himself 12
a 12
minstrel 12
man 12
burntcorked 12
in 12
the 12
mirror 12
later 12
going 12
to 12
sleep 12
he 12
would 12
feel 12
the 12
fiery 12
smile 12
still 12
gripped 12
by 12
his 12
face 12
muscles 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
it 12
never 12
went 12
away 12

smile 12
it 12
never 12
ever 12
went 12
away 12
as 12
long 12
as 12
he 12
remembered 12
he 12
hung 12
up 12
his 12
blackbeetlecoloured 12
helmet 12
and 12
shined 12
it 12
he 12
hung 12
his 12
flameproof 12
jacket 12
neatly 12
he 12
showered 12
luxuriously 12
and 12
then 12
whistling 12
hands 12
in 12
pockets 12
walked 12
across 12
the 12
upper 12
floor 12
of 12
the 12
fire 12
station 12
and 12
fell 12
down 12
the 12
hole 12
at 12
the 12
last 12
moment 12
when 12
disaster 12
seemed 12
positive 12
he 12
pulled 12
his 12
hands 12
from 12
his 12
pockets 12
and 12
broke 12
his 12
fall 12
by 12
grasping 12
the 12
golden 12
pole 12
he 12
slid 12
to 12
a 12
squeaking 12
halt 12
the 12
heels 12
one 12
inch 12
from 12
the 12
concrete 12
floor 12
downstairs 12
he 12
walked 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
fire 12
station 12
and 12
along 12
the 12
midnight 12
street 12
toward 12
the 12
subway 12
where 12
the 12
silent 12
airpropelled 12
train 12
slid 12
soundlessly 12
down 12
its 12
lubricated 12
flue 12
in 12
the 12
earth 12
and 12
let 12
him 12
out 12
with 12
a 12
great 12
puff 12
of 12
warm 12
air 12
to 12
the 12
creamtiled 12
escalator 12
rising 12
to 12
the 12
suburb 12
whistling 12
he 12
let 12
the 12
escalator 12
waft 12
him 12
into 12
the 12
still 12
night 12
air 12
he 12
walked 12
toward 12
the 12
corner 12
thinking 12
little 12
at 12
all 12
about 12
nothing 12
in 12
particular 12
before 12
he 12
reached 12
the 12
corner 12
however 12
he 12
slowed 12
as 12
if 12
a 12
wind 12
had 12
sprung 12
up 12
from 12
nowhere 12
as 12
if 12
someone 12
had 12
called 12
his 12
name 12
the 12
last 12
few 12
nights 12
he 12
had 12
had 12
the 12
most 12
uncertain 12
feelings 12
about 12
the 12
sidewalk 12
just 12
around 12
the 12
corner 12
here 12
moving 12
in 12
the 12
starlight 12
toward 12
his 12
house 12
he 12
had 12
felt 12
that 12
a 12
moment 12
before 12
his 12
making 12
the 12
turn 12
someone 12
had 12
been 12
there 12
the 12
air 12
seemed 12
charged 12
with 12
a 12
special 12
calm 12
as 12
if 12
someone 12
had 12
waited 12
there 12
quietly 12
and 12
only 12
a 12
moment 12
before 12
he 12
came 12
simply 12
turned 12
to 12
a 12
shadow 12
and 12
let 12
him 12
through 12
perhaps 12
his 12
nose 12
detected 12
a 12
faint 12
perfume 12
perhaps 12
the 12
skin 12
on 12
the 12
backs 12
of 12
his 12
hands 12
on 12
his 12
face 12
felt 12
the 12
temperature 12
rise 12
at 12
this 12
one 12
spot 12
where 12
a 12
persons 12
standing 12
might 12
raise 12
the 12
immediate 12
atmosphere 12
ten 12
degrees 12
for 12
an 12
instant 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
understanding 12
it 12
each 12
time 12
he 12
made 12
the 12
turn 12
he 12
saw 12
only 12
the 12
white 12
unused 12
buckling 12
sidewalk 12
with 12
perhaps 12
on 12
one 12
night 12
something 12
vanishing 12
swiftly 12
across 12
a 12
lawn 12
before 12
he 12
could 12
focus 12
his 12
eyes 12
or 12
speak 12
but 12
now 12
tonight 12
he 12
slowed 12
almost 12
to 12
a 12
stop 12
his 12
inner 12
mind 12
reaching 12
out 12
to 12
turn 12
the 12
corner 12
for 12
him 12
had 12
heard 12
the 12
faintest 12
whisper 12
breathing 12
or 12
was 12
the 12
atmosphere 12
compressed 12
merely 12
by 12
someone 12
standing 12
very 12
quietly 12
there 12
waiting 12
he 12
turned 12
the 12
corner 12
the 12
autumn 12
leaves 12
blew 12
over 12
the 12
moonlit 12
pavement 12
in 12
such 12
a 12
way 12
as 12
to 12
make 12
the 12
girl 12
who 12
was 12
moving 12
there 12
seem 12
fixed 12
to 12
a 12
sliding 12
walk 12
letting 12
the 12
motion 12
of 12
the 12
wind 12
and 12
the 12
leaves 12
carry 12
her 12
forward 12
her 12
head 12
was 12
half 12
bent 12
to 12
watch 12
her 12
shoes 12
stir 12
the 12
circling 12
leaves 12
her 12
face 12
was 12
slender 12
and 12
milkwhite 12
and 12
in 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
kind 12
of 12
gentle 12
hunger 12
that 12
touched 12
over 12
everything 12
with 12
tireless 12
curiosity 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
look 12
almost 12
of 12
pale 12
surprise 12
the 12
dark 12
eyes 12
were 12
so 12
fixed 12
to 12
the 12
world 12
that 12
no 12
move 12
escaped 12
them 12
her 12
dress 12
was 12
white 12
and 12
it 12
whispered 12
he 12
almost 12
thought 12
he 12
heard 12
the 12
motion 12
of 12
her 12
hands 12
as 12
she 12
walked 12
and 12
the 12
infinitely 12
small 12
sound 12
now 12
the 12
white 12
stir 12
of 12
her 12
face 12
turning 12
when 12
she 12
discovered 12
she 12
was 12
a 12
moment 12
away 12
from 12
a 12
man 12
who 12
stood 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
the 12
pavement 12
waiting 12
the 12
trees 12
overhead 12
made 12
a 12
great 12
sound 12
of 12
letting 12
down 12
their 12
dry 12
rain 12
the 12
girl 12
stopped 12
and 12
looked 12
as 12
if 12
she 12
might 12
pull 12
back 12
in 12
surprise 12
but 12
instead 12
stood 12
regarding 12
montag 12
with 12
eyes 12
so 12
dark 12
and 12
shining 12
and 12
alive 12
that 12
he 12
felt 12
he 12
had 12
said 12
something 12
quite 12
wonderful 12
but 12
he 12
knew 12
his 12
mouth 12
had 12
only 12
moved 12
to 12
say 12
hello 12
and 12
then 12
when 12
she 12
seemed 12
hypnotized 12
by 12
the 12
salamander 12
on 12
his 12
arm 12
and 12
the 12
phoenixdisc 12
on 12
his 12
chest 12
he 12
spoke 12
again 12
of 12
course 12
he 12
said 12
youre 12
a 12
new 12
neighbour 12
arent 12
you 12
and 12
you 12
must 12
be 12
she 12
raised 12
her 12
eyes 12
from 12
his 12
professional 12
symbols 12
the 12
fireman 12
her 12
voice 12
trailed 12
off 12
how 12
oddly 12
you 12
say 12
that 12
id 12
id 12
have 12
known 12
it 12
with 12
my 12
eyes 12
shut 12
she 12
said 12
slowly 12
what 12
the 12
smell 12
of 12
kerosene 12
my 12
wife 12
always 12
complains 12
he 12
laughed 12
you 12
never 12
wash 12
it 12
off 12
completely 12
no 12
you 12
dont 12
she 12
said 12
in 12
awe 12
he 12
felt 12
she 12
was 12
walking 12
in 12
a 12
circle 12
about 12
him 12
turning 12
him 12
end 12
for 12
end 12
shaking 12
him 12
quietly 12
and 12
emptying 12
his 12
pockets 12
without 12
once 12
moving 12
herself 12
kerosene 12
he 12
said 12
because 12
the 12
silence 12
had 12
lengthened 12
is 12
nothing 12
but 12
perfume 12
to 12
me 12
does 12
it 12
seem 12
like 12
that 12
really 12
of 12
course 12
why 12
not 12
she 12
gave 12
herself 12
time 12
to 12
think 12
of 12
it 12
i 12
dont 12
know 12
she 12
turned 12
to 12
face 12
the 12
sidewalk 12
going 12
toward 12
their 12
homes 12
do 12
you 12
mind 12
if 12
i 12
walk 12
back 12
with 12
you 12
im 12
clarisse 12
mcclellan 12
clarisse 12
guy 12
montag 12
come 12
along 12
what 12
are 12
you 12
doing 12
out 12
so 12
late 12
wandering 12
around 12
how 12
old 12
are 12
you 12
they 12
walked 12
in 12
the 12
warmcool 12
blowing 12
night 12
on 12
the 12
silvered 12
pavement 12
and 12
there 12
was 12
the 12
faintest 12
breath 12
of 12
fresh 12
apricots 12
and 12
strawberries 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
and 12
he 12
looked 12
around 12
and 12
realized 12
this 12
was 12
quite 12
impossible 12
so 12
late 12
in 12
the 12
year 12
there 12
was 12
only 12
the 12
girl 12
walking 12
with 12
him 12
now 12
her 12
face 12
bright 12
as 12
snow 12
in 12
the 12
moonlight 12
and 12
he 12
knew 12
she 12
was 12
working 12
his 12
questions 12
around 12
seeking 12
the 12
best 12
answers 12
she 12
could 12
possibly 12
give 12
well 12
she 12
said 12
im 12
seventeen 12
and 12
im 12
crazy 12
my 12
uncle 12
says 12
the 12
two 12
always 12
go 12
together 12
when 12
people 12
ask 12
your 12
age 12
he 12
said 12
always 12
say 12
seventeen 12
and 12
insane 12
isnt 12
this 12
a 12
nice 12
time 12
of 12
night 12
to 12
walk 12
i 12
like 12
to 12
smell 12
things 12
and 12
look 12
at 12
things 12
and 12
sometimes 12
stay 12
up 12
all 12
night 12
walking 12
and 12
watch 12
the 12
sun 12
rise 12
they 12
walked 12
on 12
again 12
in 12
silence 12
and 12
finally 12
she 12
said 12
thoughtfully 12
you 12
know 12
im 12
not 12
afraid 12
of 12
you 12
at 12
all 12
he 12
was 12
surprised 12
why 12
should 12
you 12
be 12
so 12
many 12
people 12
are 12
afraid 12
of 12
firemen 12
i 12
mean 12
but 12
youre 12
just 12
a 12
man 12
after 12
all 12
he 12
saw 12
himself 12
in 12
her 12
eyes 12
suspended 12
in 12
two 12
shining 12
drops 12
of 12
bright 12
water 12
himself 12
dark 12
and 12
tiny 12
in 12
fine 12
detail 12
the 12
lines 12
about 12
his 12
mouth 12
everything 12
there 12
as 12
if 12
her 12
eyes 12
were 12
two 12
miraculous 12
bits 12
of 12
violet 12
amber 12
that 12
might 12
capture 12
and 12
hold 12
him 12
intact 12
her 12
face 12
turned 12
to 12
him 12
now 12
was 12
fragile 12
milk 12
crystal 12
with 12
a 12
soft 12
and 12
constant 12
light 12
in 12
it 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
the 12
hysterical 12
light 12
of 12
electricity 12
but 12
what 12
but 12
the 12
strangely 12
comfortable 12
and 12
rare 12
and 12
gently 12
flattering 12
light 12
of 12
the 12
candle 12
one 12
time 12
when 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
child 12
in 12
a 12
powerfailure 12
his 12
mother 12
had 12
found 12
and 12
lit 12
a 12
last 12
candle 12
and 12
there 12
had 12
been 12
a 12
brief 12
hour 12
of 12
rediscovery 12
of 12
such 12
illumination 12
that 12
space 12
lost 12
its 12
vast 12
dimensions 12
and 12
drew 12
comfortably 12
around 12
them 12
and 12
they 12
mother 12
and 12
son 12
alone 12
transformed 12
hoping 12
that 12
the 12
power 12
might 12
not 12
come 12
on 12
again 12
too 12
soon 12
and 12
then 12
clarisse 12
mcclellan 12
said 12
do 12
you 12
mind 12
if 12
i 12
ask 12
how 12
long 12
have 12
you 12
worked 12
at 12
being 12
a 12
fireman 12
since 12
i 12
was 12
twenty 12
ten 12
years 12
ago 12

you 12
ever 12
read 12
any 12
of 12
the 12
books 12

he 12
laughed 12
thats 12
against 12
the 12
law 12
oh 12
of 12
course 12
its 12

then 12

the 12
ashes 12
thats 12
our 12
official 12
slogan 12
they 12
walked 12
still 12
further 12
and 12
the 12
girl 12
said 12
is 12
it 12
true 12
that 12
long 12
ago 12
firemen 12
put 12
fires 12
out 12
instead 12
of 12
going 12
to 12
start 12
them 12
no 12
houses 12
have 12
always 12
been 12
fireproof 12
take 12
my 12
word 12
for 12
it 12
strange 12
i 12
heard 12
once 12
that 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
ago 12
houses 12
used 12
to 12
burn 12
by 12
accident 12
and 12
they 12
needed 12
firemen 12
to 12
stop 12
the 12
flames 12
he 12
laughed 12
she 12
glanced 12
quickly 12
over 12
why 12
are 12
you 12
laughing 12
i 12
dont 12
know 12
he 12
started 12
to 12
laugh 12
again 12
and 12
stopped 12
why 12
you 12
laugh 12
when 12
i 12
havent 12
been 12
funny 12
and 12
you 12
answer 12
right 12
off 12
you 12
never 12
stop 12
to 12
think 12
what 12
ive 12
asked 12
you 12
he 12
stopped 12
walking 12
you 12
are 12
an 12
odd 12
one 12
he 12
said 12
looking 12
at 12
her 12
havent 12
you 12
any 12
respect 12
i 12
dont 12
mean 12
to 12
be 12
insulting 12
its 12
just 12
i 12
love 12
to 12
watch 12
people 12
too 12
much 12
i 12
guess 12
well 12
doesnt 12
this 12
mean 12
anything 12
to 12
you 12
he 12
tapped 12
the 12
numerals 12
stitched 12
on 12
his 12
charcoloured 12
sleeve 12
yes 12
she 12
whispered 12
she 12
increased 12
her 12
pace 12
have 12
you 12
ever 12
watched 12
the 12
jet 12
cars 12
racing 12
on 12
the 12
boulevards 12
down 12
that 12
way 12
youre 12
changing 12
the 12
subject 12
i 12
sometimes 12
think 12
drivers 12
dont 12
know 12
what 12
grass 12
is 12
or 12
flowers 12
because 12
they 12
never 12
see 12
them 12
slowly 12
she 12
said 12
if 12
you 12
showed 12
a 12
driver 12
a 12
green 12
blur 12
oh 12
yes 12
hed 12
say 12
thats 12
grass 12
a 12
pink 12
blur 12
thats 12
a 12
rosegarden 12
white 12
blurs 12
are 12
houses 12
brown 12
blurs 12
are 12
cows 12
my 12
uncle 12
drove 12
slowly 12
on 12
a 12
highway 12
once 12
he 12
drove 12
forty 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
and 12
they 12
jailed 12
him 12
for 12
two 12
days 12
isnt 12
that 12
funny 12
and 12
sad 12
too 12
you 12
think 12
too 12
many 12
things 12
said 12
montag 12
uneasily 12
i 12
rarely 12
watch 12
the 12
parlour 12
walls 12
or 12
go 12
to 12
races 12
or 12
fun 12
parks 12
so 12
ive 12
lots 12
of 12
time 12
for 12
crazy 12
thoughts 12
i 12
guess 12
have 12
you 12
seen 12
the 12
twohundredfootlong 12
billboards 12
in 12
the 12
country 12
beyond 12
town 12
did 12
you 12
know 12
that 12
once 12
billboards 12
were 12
only 12
twenty 12
feet 12
long 12
but 12
cars 12
started 12
rushing 12
by 12
so 12
quickly 12
they 12
had 12
to 12
stretch 12
the 12
advertising 12
out 12
so 12
it 12
would 12
last 12
i 12
didnt 12
know 12
that 12
montag 12
laughed 12
abruptly 12
bet 12
i 12
know 12
something 12
else 12
you 12
dont 12
theres 12
dew 12
on 12
the 12
grass 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
he 12
suddenly 12
couldnt 12
remember 12
if 12
he 12
had 12
known 12
this 12
or 12
not 12
and 12
it 12
made 12
him 12
quite 12
irritable 12
and 12
if 12
you 12
look 12
she 12
nodded 12
at 12
the 12
sky 12
theres 12
a 12
man 12
in 12
the 12
moon 12
he 12
hadnt 12
looked 12
for 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
they 12
walked 12
the 12
rest 12
of 12
the 12
way 12
in 12
silence 12
hers 12
thoughtful 12
his 12
a 12
kind 12
of 12
clenching 12
and 12
uncomfortable 12
silence 12
in 12
which 12
he 12
shot 12
her 12
accusing 12
glances 12
when 12
they 12
reached 12
her 12
house 12
all 12
its 12
lights 12
were 12
blazing 12
whats 12
going 12
on 12
montag 12
had 12
rarely 12
seen 12
that 12
many 12
house 12
lights 12
oh 12
just 12
my 12
mother 12
and 12
father 12
and 12
uncle 12
sitting 12
around 12
talking 12
its 12
like 12
being 12
a 12
pedestrian 12
only 12
rarer 12
my 12
uncle 12
was 12
arrested 12
another 12
time 12
did 12
i 12
tell 12
you 12
for 12
being 12
a 12
pedestrian 12
oh 12
were 12
most 12
peculiar 12
but 12
what 12
do 12
you 12
talk 12
about 12
she 12
laughed 12
at 12
this 12
good 12
night 12
she 12
started 12
up 12
her 12
walk 12
then 12
she 12
seemed 12
to 12
remember 12
something 12
and 12
came 12
back 12
to 12
look 12
at 12
him 12
with 12
wonder 12
and 12
curiosity 12
are 12
you 12
happy 12
she 12
said 12
am 12
i 12
what 12
he 12
cried 12
but 12
she 12
was 12
gone 12
running 12
in 12
the 12
moonlight 12
her 12
front 12
door 12
shut 12
gently 12
happy 12
of 12
all 12
the 12
nonsense 12
he 12
stopped 12
laughing 12
he 12
put 12
his 12
hand 12
into 12
the 12
glovehole 12
of 12
his 12
front 12
door 12
and 12
let 12
it 12
know 12
his 12
touch 12
the 12
front 12
door 12
slid 12
open 12
of 12
course 12
im 12
happy 12
what 12
does 12
she 12
think 12
im 12
not 12
he 12
asked 12
the 12
quiet 12
rooms 12
he 12
stood 12
looking 12
up 12
at 12
the 12
ventilator 12
grille 12
in 12
the 12
hall 12
and 12
suddenly 12
remembered 12
that 12
something 12
lay 12
hidden 12
behind 12
the 12
grille 12
something 12
that 12
seemed 12
to 12
peer 12
down 12
at 12
him 12
now 12
he 12
moved 12
his 12
eyes 12
quickly 12
away 12
what 12
a 12
strange 12
meeting 12
on 12
a 12
strange 12
night 12
he 12
remembered 12
nothing 12
like 12
it 12
save 12
one 12
afternoon 12
a 12
year 12
ago 12
when 12
he 12
had 12
met 12
an 12
old 12
man 12
in 12
the 12
park 12
and 12
they 12
had 12
talked 12
montag 12
shook 12
his 12
head 12
he 12
looked 12
at 12
a 12
blank 12
wall 12
the 12
girls 12
face 12
was 12
there 12
really 12
quite 12
beautiful 12
in 12
memory 12
astonishing 12
in 12
fact 12
she 12
had 12
a 12
very 12
thin 12
face 12
like 12
the 12
dial 12
of 12
a 12
small 12
clock 12
seen 12
faintly 12
in 12
a 12
dark 12
room 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
a 12
night 12
when 12
you 12
waken 12
to 12
see 12
the 12
time 12
and 12
see 12
the 12
clock 12
telling 12
you 12
the 12
hour 12
and 12
the 12
minute 12
and 12
the 12
second 12
with 12
a 12
white 12
silence 12
and 12
a 12
glowing 12
all 12
certainty 12
and 12
knowing 12
what 12
it 12
has 12
to 12
tell 12
of 12
the 12
night 12
passing 12
swiftly 12
on 12
toward 12
further 12
darknesses 12
but 12
moving 12
also 12
toward 12
a 12
new 12
sun 12
what 12
asked 12
montag 12
of 12
that 12
other 12
self 12
the 12
subconscious 12
idiot 12
that 12
ran 12
babbling 12
at 12
times 12
quite 12
independent 12
of 12
will 12
habit 12
and 12
conscience 12
he 12
glanced 12
back 12
at 12
the 12
wall 12
how 12
like 12
a 12
mirror 12
too 12
her 12
face 12
impossible 12
for 12
how 12
many 12
people 12
did 12
you 12
know 12
that 12
refracted 12
your 12
own 12
light 12
to 12
you 12
people 12
were 12
more 12
often 12
he 12
searched 12
for 12
a 12
simile 12
found 12
one 12
in 12
his 12
work 12
torches 12
blazing 12
away 12
until 12
they 12
whiffed 12
out 12
how 12
rarely 12
did 12
other 12
peoples 12
faces 12
take 12
of 12
you 12
and 12
throw 12
back 12
to 12
you 12
your 12
own 12
expression 12
your 12
own 12
innermost 12
trembling 12
thought 12
what 12
incredible 12
power 12
of 12
identification 12
the 12
girl 12
had 12
she 12
was 12
like 12
the 12
eager 12
watcher 12
of 12
a 12
marionette 12
show 12
anticipating 12
each 12
flicker 12
of 12
an 12
eyelid 12
each 12
gesture 12
of 12
his 12
hand 12
each 12
flick 12
of 12
a 12
finger 12
the 12
moment 12
before 12
it 12
began 12
how 12
long 12
had 12
they 12
walked 12
together 12
three 12
minutes 12
five 12
yet 12
how 12
large 12
that 12
time 12
seemed 12
now 12
how 12
immense 12
a 12
figure 12
she 12
was 12
on 12
the 12
stage 12
before 12
him 12
what 12
a 12
shadow 12
she 12
threw 12
on 12
the 12
wall 12
with 12
her 12
slender 12
body 12
he 12
felt 12
that 12
if 12
his 12
eye 12
itched 12
she 12
might 12
blink 12
and 12
if 12
the 12
muscles 12
of 12
his 12
jaws 12
stretched 12
imperceptibly 12
she 12
would 12
yawn 12
long 12
before 12
he 12
would 12
why 12
he 12
thought 12
now 12
that 12
i 12
think 12
of 12
it 12
she 12
almost 12
seemed 12
to 12
be 12
waiting 12
for 12
me 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
street 12
so 12
damned 12
late 12
at 12
night 12
he 12
opened 12
the 12
bedroom 12
door 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
coming 12
into 12
the 12
cold 12
marbled 12
room 12
of 12
a 12
mausoleum 12
after 12
the 12
moon 12
had 12
set 12
complete 12
darkness 12
not 12
a 12
hint 12
of 12
the 12
silver 12
world 12
outside 12
the 12
windows 12
tightly 12
shut 12
the 12
chamber 12
a 12
tombworld 12
where 12
no 12
sound 12
from 12
the 12
great 12
city 12
could 12
penetrate 12
the 12
room 12
was 12
not 12
empty 12
he 12
listened 12
the 12
little 12
mosquitodelicate 12
dancing 12
hum 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
the 12
electrical 12
murmur 12
of 12
a 12
hidden 12
wasp 12
snug 12
in 12
its 12
special 12
pink 12
warm 12
nest 12
the 12
music 12
was 12
almost 12
loud 12
enough 12
so 12
he 12
could 12
follow 12
the 12
tune 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
smile 12
slide 12
away 12
melt 12
fold 12
over 12
and 12
down 12
on 12
itself 12
like 12
a 12
tallow 12
skin 12
like 12
the 12
stuff 12
of 12
a 12
fantastic 12
candle 12
burning 12
too 12
long 12
and 12
now 12
collapsing 12
and 12
now 12
blown 12
out 12
darkness 12
he 12
was 12
not 12
happy 12
he 12
was 12
not 12
happy 12
he 12
said 12
the 12
words 12
to 12
himself 12
he 12
recognized 12
this 12
as 12
the 12
true 12
state 12
of 12
affairs 12
he 12
wore 12
his 12
happiness 12
like 12
a 12
mask 12
and 12
the 12
girl 12
had 12
run 12
off 12
across 12
the 12
lawn 12
with 12
the 12
mask 12
and 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
way 12
of 12
going 12
to 12
knock 12
on 12
her 12
door 12
and 12
ask 12
for 12
it 12
back 12
without 12
turning 12
on 12
the 12
light 12
he 12
imagined 12
how 12
this 12
room 12
would 12
look 12
his 12
wife 12
stretched 12
on 12
the 12
bed 12
uncovered 12
and 12
cold 12
like 12
a 12
body 12
displayed 12
on 12
the 12
lid 12
of 12
a 12
tomb 12
her 12
eyes 12
fixed 12
to 12
the 12
ceiling 12
by 12
invisible 12
threads 12
of 12
steel 12
immovable 12
and 12
in 12
her 12
ears 12
the 12
little 12
seashells 12
the 12
thimble 12
radios 12
tamped 12
tight 12
and 12
an 12
electronic 12
ocean 12
of 12
sound 12
of 12
music 12
and 12
talk 12
and 12
music 12
and 12
talk 12
coming 12
in 12
coming 12
in 12
on 12
the 12
shore 12
of 12
her 12
unsleeping 12
mind 12
the 12
room 12
was 12
indeed 12
empty 12
every 12
night 12
the 12
waves 12
came 12
in 12
and 12
bore 12
her 12
off 12
on 12
their 12
great 12
tides 12
of 12
sound 12
floating 12
her 12
wideeyed 12
toward 12
morning 12
there 12
had 12
been 12
no 12
night 12
in 12
the 12
last 12
two 12
years 12
that 12
mildred 12
had 12
not 12
swum 12
that 12
sea 12
had 12
not 12
gladly 12
gone 12
down 12
in 12
it 12
for 12
the 12
third 12
time 12
the 12
room 12
was 12
cold 12
but 12
nonetheless 12
he 12
felt 12
he 12
could 12
not 12
breathe 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
wish 12
to 12
open 12
the 12
curtains 12
and 12
open 12
the 12
french 12
windows 12
for 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
want 12
the 12
moon 12
to 12
come 12
into 12
the 12
room 12
so 12
with 12
the 12
feeling 12
of 12
a 12
man 12
who 12
will 12
die 12
in 12
the 12
next 12
hour 12
for 12
lack 12
of 12
air 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
way 12
toward 12
his 12
open 12
separate 12
and 12
therefore 12
cold 12
bed 12
an 12
instant 12
before 12
his 12
foot 12
hit 12
the 12
object 12
on 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
knew 12
he 12
would 12
hit 12
such 12
an 12
object 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
unlike 12
the 12
feeling 12
he 12
had 12
experienced 12
before 12
turning 12
the 12
corner 12
and 12
almost 12
knocking 12
the 12
girl 12
down 12
his 12
foot 12
sending 12
vibrations 12
ahead 12
received 12
back 12
echoes 12
of 12
the 12
small 12
barrier 12
across 12
its 12
path 12
even 12
as 12
the 12
foot 12
swung 12
his 12
foot 12
kicked 12
the 12
object 12
gave 12
a 12
dull 12
clink 12
and 12
slid 12
off 12
in 12
darkness 12
he 12
stood 12
very 12
straight 12
and 12
listened 12
to 12
the 12
person 12
on 12
the 12
dark 12
bed 12
in 12
the 12
completely 12
featureless 12
night 12
the 12
breath 12
coming 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
nostrils 12
was 12
so 12
faint 12
it 12
stirred 12
only 12
the 12
furthest 12
fringes 12
of 12
life 12
a 12
small 12
leaf 12
a 12
black 12
feather 12
a 12
single 12
fibre 12
of 12
hair 12
he 12
still 12
did 12
not 12
want 12
outside 12
light 12
he 12
pulled 12
out 12
his 12
igniter 12
felt 12
the 12
salamander 12
etched 12
on 12
its 12
silver 12
disc 12
gave 12
it 12
a 12
flick 12
two 12
moonstones 12
looked 12
up 12
at 12
him 12
in 12
the 12
light 12
of 12
his 12
small 12
handheld 12
fire 12
two 12
pale 12
moonstones 12
buried 12
in 12
a 12
creek 12
of 12
clear 12
water 12
over 12
which 12
the 12
life 12
of 12
the 12
world 12
ran 12
not 12
touching 12
them 12
mildred 12
her 12
face 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
snowcovered 12
island 12
upon 12
which 12
rain 12
might 12
fall 12
but 12
it 12
felt 12
no 12
rain 12
over 12
which 12
clouds 12
might 12
pass 12
their 12
moving 12
shadows 12
but 12
she 12
felt 12
no 12
shadow 12
there 12
was 12
only 12
the 12
singing 12
of 12
the 12
thimblewasps 12
in 12
her 12
tampedshut 12
ears 12
and 12
her 12
eyes 12
all 12
glass 12
and 12
breath 12
going 12
in 12
and 12
out 12
softly 12
faintly 12
in 12
and 12
out 12
of 12
her 12
nostrils 12
and 12
her 12
not 12
caring 12
whether 12
it 12
came 12
or 12
went 12
went 12
or 12
came 12
the 12
object 12
he 12
had 12
sent 12
tumbling 12
with 12
his 12
foot 12
now 12
glinted 12
under 12
the 12
edge 12
of 12
his 12
own 12
bed 12
the 12
small 12
crystal 12
bottle 12
of 12
sleepingtablets 12
which 12
earlier 12
today 12
had 12
been 12
filled 12
with 12
thirty 12
capsules 12
and 12
which 12
now 12
lay 12
uncapped 12
and 12
empty 12
in 12
the 12
light 12
of 12
the 12
tiny 12
flare 12
as 12
he 12
stood 12
there 12
the 12
sky 12
over 12
the 12
house 12
screamed 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
tremendous 12
ripping 12
sound 12
as 12
if 12
two 12
giant 12
hands 12
had 12
torn 12
ten 12
thousand 12
miles 12
of 12
black 12
linen 12
down 12
the 12
seam 12
montag 12
was 12
cut 12
in 12
half 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
chest 12
chopped 12
down 12
and 12
split 12
apart 12
the 12
jetbombs 12
going 12
over 12
going 12
over 12
going 12
over 12
one 12
two 12
one 12
two 12
one 12
two 12
six 12
of 12
them 12
nine 12
of 12
them 12
twelve 12
of 12
them 12
one 12
and 12
one 12
and 12
one 12
and 12
another 12
and 12
another 12
and 12
another 12
did 12
all 12
the 12
screaming 12
for 12
him 12
he 12
opened 12
his 12
own 12
mouth 12
and 12
let 12
their 12
shriek 12
come 12
down 12
and 12
out 12
between 12
his 12
bared 12
teeth 12
the 12
house 12
shook 12
the 12
flare 12
went 12
out 12
in 12
his 12
hand 12
the 12
moonstones 12
vanished 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
hand 12
plunge 12
toward 12
the 12
telephone 12
the 12
jets 12
were 12
gone 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
lips 12
move 12
brushing 12
the 12
mouthpiece 12
of 12
the 12
phone 12
emergency 12
hospital 12
a 12
terrible 12
whisper 12
he 12
felt 12
that 12
the 12
stars 12
had 12
been 12
pulverized 12
by 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
the 12
black 12
jets 12
and 12
that 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
the 12
earth 12
would 12
be 12
thought 12
as 12
he 12
stood 12
shivering 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
and 12
let 12
his 12
lips 12
go 12
on 12
moving 12
and 12
moving 12
they 12
had 12
this 12
machine 12
they 12
had 12
two 12
machines 12
really 12
one 12
of 12
them 12
slid 12
down 12
into 12
your 12
stomach 12
like 12
a 12
black 12
cobra 12
down 12
an 12
echoing 12
well 12
looking 12
for 12
all 12
the 12
old 12
water 12
and 12
the 12
old 12
time 12
gathered 12
there 12
it 12
drank 12
up 12
the 12
green 12
matter 12
that 12
flowed 12
to 12
the 12
top 12
in 12
a 12
slow 12
boil 12
did 12
it 12
drink 12
of 12
the 12
darkness 12
did 12
it 12
suck 12
out 12
all 12
the 12
poisons 12
accumulated 12
with 12
the 12
years 12
it 12
fed 12
in 12
silence 12
with 12
an 12
occasional 12
sound 12
of 12
inner 12
suffocation 12
and 12
blind 12
searching 12
it 12
had 12
an 12
eye 12
the 12
impersonal 12
operator 12
of 12
the 12
machine 12
could 12
by 12
wearing 12
a 12
special 12
optical 12
helmet 12
gaze 12
into 12
the 12
soul 12
of 12
the 12
person 12
whom 12
he 12
was 12
pumping 12
out 12
what 12
did 12
the 12
eye 12
see 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
say 12
he 12
saw 12
but 12
did 12
not 12
see 12
what 12
the 12
eye 12
saw 12
the 12
entire 12
operation 12
was 12
not 12
unlike 12
the 12
digging 12
of 12
a 12
trench 12
in 12
ones 12
yard 12
the 12
woman 12
on 12
the 12
bed 12
was 12
no 12
more 12
than 12
a 12
hard 12
stratum 12
of 12
marble 12
they 12
had 12
reached 12
go 12
on 12
anyway 12
shove 12
the 12
bore 12
down 12
slush 12
up 12
the 12
emptiness 12
if 12
such 12
a 12
thing 12
could 12
be 12
brought 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
throb 12
of 12
the 12
suction 12
snake 12
the 12
operator 12
stood 12
smoking 12
a 12
cigarette 12
the 12
other 12
machine 12
was 12
working 12
too 12
the 12
other 12
machine 12
was 12
operated 12
by 12
an 12
equally 12
impersonal 12
fellow 12
in 12
nonstainable 12
reddishbrown 12
overalls 12
this 12
machine 12
pumped 12
all 12
of 12
the 12
blood 12
from 12
the 12
body 12
and 12
replaced 12

that 12
stuff 12
in 12
the 12
blood 12
and 12
the 12
blood 12
hits 12
the 12
brain 12
like 12
a 12
mallet 12
bang 12
a 12
couple 12
of 12
thousand 12
times 12

so 12
long 12
and 12
the 12
men 12
with 12
the 12
cigarettes 12
in 12
their 12
straightlined 12
mouths 12
the 12
men 12
with 12
the 12
eyes 12
of 12
puffadders 12
took 12
up 12
their 12
load 12
of 12
machine 12
and 12
tube 12
their 12
case 12
of 12
liquid 12
melancholy 12
and 12
the 12
slow 12
dark 12
sludge 12
of 12
nameless 12
stuff 12
and 12
strolled 12
out 12
the 12
door 12
montag 12
sank 12
down 12
into 12
a 12
chair 12
and 12
looked 12
at 12
this 12
woman 12
her 12
eyes 12
were 12
closed 12
now 12
gently 12
and 12
he 12
put 12
out 12
his 12
hand 12
to 12
feel 12
the 12
warmness 12
of 12
breath 12
on 12
his 12
palm 12
mildred 12
he 12
said 12
at 12
last 12
there 12
are 12
too 12
many 12
of 12
us 12

billions 12
of 12
us 12
and 12
thats 12
too 12
many 12

and 12
violate 12
you 12
strangers 12
come 12
and 12
cut 12
your 12
heart 12
out 12
strangers 12
come 12
and 12
take 12
your 12
blood 12
good 12
god 12
who 12
were 12
those 12
men 12
i 12
never 12
saw 12
them 12
before 12
in 12
my 12
life 12
half 12
an 12
hour 12
passed 12
the 12
bloodstream 12
in 12
this 12
woman 12
was 12
new 12
and 12
it 12
seemed 12
to 12
have 12
done 12
a 12
new 12
thing 12
to 12
her 12
her 12
cheeks 12
were 12
very 12
pink 12
and 12
her 12
lips 12
were 12
very 12
fresh 12
and 12
full 12
of 12
colour 12
and 12
they 12
looked 12
soft 12
and 12
relaxed 12
someone 12
elses 12
blood 12
there 12
if 12
only 12
someone 12
elses 12
flesh 12
and 12
brain 12
and 12
memory 12
if 12
only 12
they 12
could 12
have 12
taken 12
her 12
mind 12
along 12
to 12
the 12
drycleaners 12
and 12
emptied 12
the 12
pockets 12
and 12
steamed 12
and 12
cleansed 12
it 12
and 12
reblocked 12
it 12
and 12
brought 12
it 12
back 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
if 12
only 12
he 12
got 12
up 12
and 12
put 12
back 12
the 12
curtains 12
and 12
opened 12
the 12
windows 12
wide 12
to 12
let 12
the 12
night 12
air 12
in 12
it 12
was 12
two 12
oclock 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
was 12
it 12
only 12
an 12
hour 12
ago 12
clarisse 12
mcclellan 12
in 12
the 12
street 12
and 12
him 12
coming 12
in 12
and 12
the 12
dark 12
room 12
and 12
his 12
foot 12
kicking 12
the 12
little 12
crystal 12
bottle 12
only 12
an 12
hour 12
but 12
the 12
world 12
had 12
melted 12
down 12
and 12
sprung 12
up 12
in 12
a 12
new 12
and 12
colourless 12
form 12
laughter 12
blew 12
across 12
the 12
mooncoloured 12
lawn 12
from 12
the 12
house 12
of 12
clarisse 12
and 12
her 12
father 12
and 12
mother 12
and 12
the 12
uncle 12
who 12
smiled 12
so 12
quietly 12
and 12
so 12
earnestly 12
above 12
all 12
their 12
laughter 12
was 12
relaxed 12
and 12
hearty 12
and 12
not 12
forced 12
in 12
any 12
way 12
coming 12
from 12
the 12
house 12
that 12
was 12
so 12
brightly 12
lit 12
this 12
late 12
at 12
night 12
while 12
all 12

centre 12
of 12
the 12
sidewalk 12
with 12
her 12

under 12

the 12
moon 12
you 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
moon 12
last 12
night 12
the 12
others 12
would 12
never 12
do 12
that 12
the 12
others 12
would 12
walk 12
off 12

of 12
the 12
few 12
who 12

up 12
with 12
me 12
thats 12
why 12
i 12
think 12
its 12
so 12
strange 12
youre 12
a 12
fireman 12
it 12
just 12
doesnt 12
seem 12
right 12
for 12
you 12
somehow 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
body 12
divide 12
itself 12
into 12
a 12
hotness 12
and 12
a 12
coldness 12
a 12
softness 12
and 12
a 12
hardness 12
a 12
trembling 12
and 12
a 12
not 12
trembling 12
the 12
two 12
halves 12
grinding 12
one 12
upon 12
the 12
other 12
youd 12
better 12
run 12
on 12
to 12
your 12
appointment 12
he 12
said 12
and 12
she 12
ran 12
off 12
and 12
left 12
him 12
standing 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
rain 12
only 12
after 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
did 12
he 12
move 12
and 12
then 12
very 12
slowly 12
as 12
he 12
walked 12
he 12
tilted 12
his 12
head 12
back 12
in 12
the 12
rain 12
for 12
just 12
a 12
few 12
moments 12
and 12
opened 12
his 12
mouth 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
slept 12
but 12
did 12
not 12
sleep 12
lived 12
but 12
did 12
not 12
live 12
in 12
its 12
gently 12
humming 12
gently 12
vibrating 12
softly 12
illuminated 12
kennel 12
back 12
in 12
a 12
dark 12
corner 12
of 12
the 12
firehouse 12
the 12
dim 12
light 12
of 12
one 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
the 12
moonlight 12
from 12
the 12
open 12
sky 12
framed 12
through 12
the 12
great 12
window 12
touched 12
here 12
and 12
there 12
on 12
the 12
brass 12
and 12
the 12
copper 12
and 12
the 12
steel 12
of 12
the 12
faintly 12
trembling 12
beast 12
light 12
flickered 12
on 12
bits 12
of 12
ruby 12
glass 12
and 12
on 12
sensitive 12
capillary 12
hairs 12
in 12
the 12
nylonbrushed 12
nostrils 12
of 12
the 12
creature 12
that 12
quivered 12
gently 12
gently 12
gently 12
its 12
eight 12
legs 12
spidered 12
under 12
it 12
on 12
rubberpadded 12
paws 12
montag 12
slid 12
down 12
the 12
brass 12
pole 12
he 12
went 12
out 12
to 12
look 12
at 12
the 12
city 12
and 12
the 12
clouds 12
had 12
cleared 12
away 12
completely 12
and 12
he 12
lit 12
a 12
cigarette 12
and 12
came 12
back 12
to 12
bend 12
down 12
and 12
look 12
at 12
the 12
hound 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
great 12
bee 12
come 12
home 12
from 12
some 12
field 12
where 12
the 12
honey 12
is 12
full 12
of 12
poison 12
wildness 12
of 12
insanity 12
and 12
nightmare 12
its 12
body 12
crammed 12
with 12
that 12
overrich 12
nectar 12
and 12
now 12
it 12
was 12
sleeping 12
the 12
evil 12
out 12
of 12
itself 12
hello 12
whispered 12
montag 12
fascinated 12
as 12
always 12
with 12
the 12
dead 12
beast 12
the 12
living 12
beast 12
at 12
night 12
when 12
things 12
got 12
dull 12
which 12
was 12
every 12
night 12
the 12
men 12
slid 12
down 12
the 12
brass 12
poles 12
and 12
set 12
the 12
ticking 12
combinations 12
of 12
the 12
olfactory 12
system 12
of 12
the 12
hound 12
and 12
let 12
loose 12
rats 12
in 12
the 12
firehouse 12
areaway 12
and 12
sometimes 12
chickens 12
and 12
sometimes 12
cats 12
that 12
would 12
have 12
to 12
be 12
drowned 12
anyway 12
and 12
there 12
would 12
be 12
betting 12
to 12
see 12
which 12
the 12
hound 12
would 12
seize 12
first 12
the 12
animals 12
were 12
turned 12
loose 12
three 12
seconds 12
later 12
the 12
game 12
was 12
done 12
the 12
rat 12
cat 12
or 12
chicken 12
caught 12
half 12
across 12
the 12
areaway 12
gripped 12
in 12
gentling 12
paws 12
while 12
a 12
fourinch 12
hollow 12
steel 12
needle 12
plunged 12
down 12
from 12
the 12
proboscis 12
of 12
the 12
hound 12
to 12
inject 12
massive 12
jolts 12
of 12
morphine 12
or 12
procaine 12
the 12
pawn 12
was 12
then 12
tossed 12
in 12
the 12
incinerator 12
a 12
new 12
game 12
began 12
montag 12
stayed 12
upstairs 12
most 12
nights 12
when 12
this 12
went 12
on 12
there 12
had 12
been 12
a 12
time 12
two 12
years 12
ago 12
when 12
he 12
had 12
bet 12
with 12
the 12
best 12
of 12
them 12
and 12
lost 12
a 12
weeks 12
salary 12
and 12
faced 12
mildreds 12
insane 12
anger 12
which 12
showed 12
itself 12
in 12
veins 12
and 12
blotches 12
but 12
now 12
at 12
night 12
he 12
lay 12
in 12
his 12
bunk 12
face 12
turned 12
to 12
the 12
wall 12
listening 12
to 12
whoops 12
of 12
laughter 12
below 12
and 12
the 12
pianostring 12
scurry 12
of 12
rat 12
feet 12
the 12
violin 12
squeaking 12
of 12
mice 12
and 12
the 12
great 12
shadowing 12
motioned 12
silence 12
of 12
the 12
hound 12
leaping 12
out 12
like 12
a 12
moth 12
in 12
the 12
raw 12
light 12
finding 12
holding 12
its 12
victim 12
inserting 12
the 12
needle 12
and 12
going 12
back 12
to 12
its 12
kennel 12
to 12
die 12
as 12
if 12
a 12
switch 12
had 12
been 12
turned 12
montag 12
touched 12
the 12
muzzle 12
the 12
hound 12
growled 12
montag 12
jumped 12
back 12
the 12
hound 12
half 12
rose 12
in 12
its 12
kennel 12
and 12
looked 12
at 12
him 12
with 12
greenblue 12
neon 12
light 12
flickering 12
in 12
its 12
suddenly 12
activated 12
eyebulbs 12
it 12
growled 12
again 12
a 12
strange 12
rasping 12
combination 12
of 12
electrical 12
sizzle 12
a 12
frying 12
sound 12
a 12
scraping 12
of 12
metal 12
a 12
turning 12
of 12
cogs 12
that 12
seemed 12
rusty 12
and 12
ancient 12
with 12
suspicion 12
no 12
no 12
boy 12
said 12
montag 12
his 12
heart 12
pounding 12
he 12
saw 12
the 12
silver 12
needle 12
extended 12
upon 12
the 12
air 12
an 12
inch 12
pull 12
back 12
extend 12
pull 12
back 12
the 12
growl 12
simmered 12
in 12
the 12
beast 12
and 12
it 12
looked 12
at 12
him 12
montag 12
backed 12
up 12
the 12
hound 12
took 12
a 12
step 12
from 12
its 12
kennel 12
montag 12
grabbed 12
the 12
brass 12
pole 12
with 12
one 12
hand 12
the 12
pole 12
reacting 12
slid 12
upward 12
and 12
took 12
him 12
through 12
the 12
ceiling 12
quietly 12
he 12
stepped 12
off 12
in 12
the 12
halflit 12
deck 12
of 12
the 12
upper 12
level 12
he 12
was 12
trembling 12
and 12
his 12
face 12
was 12
greenwhite 12
below 12
the 12
hound 12
had 12
sunk 12
back 12
down 12
upon 12
its 12
eight 12
incredible 12
insect 12
legs 12
and 12
was 12
humming 12
to 12
itself 12
again 12
its 12
multifaceted 12
eyes 12
at 12
peace 12
montag 12
stood 12
letting 12
the 12
fears 12
pass 12
by 12
the 12
drophole 12
behind 12
him 12
four 12
men 12
at 12
a 12
card 12
table 12
under 12
a 12
greenlidded 12
light 12
in 12
the 12
corner 12
glanced 12
briefly 12
but 12
said 12
nothing 12
only 12
the 12
man 12
with 12
the 12
captains 12
hat 12
and 12
the 12
sign 12
of 12
the 12
phoenix 12
on 12
his 12
hat 12
at 12
last 12
curious 12
his 12
playing 12
cards 12
in 12
his 12
thin 12
hand 12
talked 12
across 12
the 12
long 12
room 12
montag 12
it 12
doesnt 12
like 12
me 12
said 12
montag 12
what 12
the 12
hound 12
the 12
captain 12
studied 12
his 12
cards 12
come 12
off 12
it 12
it 12
doesnt 12
like 12
or 12
dislike 12
it 12
just 12
functions 12
its 12
like 12
a 12
lesson 12
in 12
ballistics 12
it 12
has 12
a 12
trajectory 12
we 12
decide 12
for 12
it 12
it 12
follows 12
through 12
it 12
targets 12
itself 12
homes 12
itself 12
and 12
cuts 12
off 12
its 12
only 12
copper 12
wire 12
storage 12
batteries 12
and 12
electricity 12
montag 12
swallowed 12
its 12
calculators 12
can 12
be 12
set 12
to 12
any 12
combination 12
so 12
many 12
amino 12
acids 12
so 12
much 12
sulphur 12
so 12
much 12
butterfat 12
and 12
alkaline 12
right 12
we 12
all 12
know 12
that 12
all 12
of 12
those 12
chemical 12
balances 12
and 12
percentages 12
on 12
all 12
of 12
us 12
here 12
in 12
the 12
house 12
are 12
recorded 12
in 12
the 12
master 12
file 12
downstairs 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
easy 12
for 12
someone 12
to 12
set 12
up 12
a 12
partial 12
combination 12
on 12
the 12
hounds 12
memory 12
a 12
touch 12
of 12
amino 12
acids 12
perhaps 12
that 12
would 12
account 12
for 12
what 12
the 12
animal 12
did 12
just 12
now 12
reacted 12
toward 12
me 12
hell 12
said 12
the 12
captain 12
irritated 12
but 12
not 12
completely 12
angry 12
just 12
enough 12
memory 12
set 12
up 12
in 12
it 12
by 12
someone 12
so 12
it 12
growled 12
when 12
i 12
touched 12
it 12
who 12
would 12
do 12
a 12
thing 12
like 12
that 12
asked 12
the 12
captain 12
you 12
havent 12
any 12
enemies 12
here 12
guy 12
none 12
that 12
i 12
know 12
of 12
well 12
have 12
the 12
hound 12
checked 12
by 12
our 12
technicians 12
tomorrow 12
this 12
isnt 12
the 12
first 12
time 12
its 12
threatened 12
me 12
said 12
montag 12
last 12
month 12
it 12
happened 12
twice 12
well 12
fix 12
it 12
up 12
dont 12
worry 12
but 12
montag 12
did 12
not 12
move 12
and 12
only 12
stood 12
thinking 12
of 12
the 12
ventilator 12
grille 12
in 12
the 12
hall 12
at 12
home 12
and 12
what 12
lay 12
hidden 12
behind 12
the 12
grille 12
if 12
someone 12
here 12
in 12
the 12
firehouse 12
knew 12
about 12
the 12
ventilator 12
then 12
mightnt 12
they 12
tell 12
the 12
hound 12
the 12
captain 12
came 12
over 12
to 12
the 12
drophole 12
and 12
gave 12
montag 12
a 12
questioning 12
glance 12
i 12
was 12
just 12
figuring 12
said 12
montag 12
what 12
does 12
the 12
hound 12
think 12
about 12
down 12
there 12
nights 12
is 12
it 12
coming 12
alive 12
on 12
us 12
really 12
it 12
makes 12
me 12
cold 12
it 12
doesnt 12
think 12
anything 12
we 12
dont 12
want 12
it 12
to 12
think 12
thats 12
sad 12
said 12
montag 12
quietly 12
because 12
all 12
we 12
put 12
into 12
it 12
is 12
hunting 12
and 12
finding 12
and 12
killing 12
what 12
a 12
shame 12
if 12
thats 12
all 12
it 12
can 12
ever 12
know 12
beatty 12
snorted 12
gently 12
hell 12
its 12
a 12
fine 12
bit 12
of 12
craftsmanship 12
a 12
good 12
rifle 12
that 12
can 12
fetch 12
its 12
own 12
target 12
and 12
guarantees 12
the 12
bullseye 12
every 12
time 12
thats 12
why 12
said 12
montag 12
i 12
wouldnt 12
want 12
to 12
be 12
its 12
next 12
victim 12
why 12
you 12
got 12
a 12
guilty 12
conscience 12
about 12
something 12
montag 12
glanced 12
up 12
swiftly 12
beatty 12
stood 12
there 12
looking 12
at 12
him 12
steadily 12
with 12
his 12
eyes 12
while 12
his 12
mouth 12
opened 12
and 12
began 12
to 12
laugh 12
very 12
softly 12
one 12
two 12
three 12
four 12
five 12
six 12
seven 12
days 12
and 12
as 12
many 12
times 12
he 12
came 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
house 12
and 12
clarisse 12
was 12
there 12
somewhere 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
once 12
he 12
saw 12
her 12
shaking 12
a 12
walnut 12
tree 12
once 12
he 12
saw 12
her 12
sitting 12
on 12
the 12
lawn 12
knitting 12
a 12
blue 12
sweater 12
three 12
or 12
four 12
times 12
he 12
found 12
a 12
bouquet 12
of 12
late 12
flowers 12
on 12
his 12
porch 12
or 12
a 12
handful 12
of 12
chestnuts 12
in 12
a 12
little 12
sack 12
or 12
some 12
autumn 12
leaves 12
neatly 12
pinned 12
to 12
a 12
sheet 12
of 12
white 12
paper 12
and 12
thumbtacked 12
to 12
his 12
door 12
every 12
day 12
clarisse 12
walked 12
him 12
to 12
the 12
corner 12
one 12
day 12
it 12
was 12
raining 12
the 12
next 12
it 12
was 12
clear 12
the 12
day 12
after 12
that 12
the 12
wind 12
blew 12
strong 12
and 12
the 12
day 12
after 12
that 12
it 12
was 12
mild 12
and 12
calm 12
and 12
the 12
day 12
after 12
that 12
calm 12
day 12
was 12
a 12
day 12
like 12
a 12
furnace 12
of 12
summer 12
and 12
clarisse 12
with 12
her 12
face 12
all 12
sunburnt 12
by 12
late 12
afternoon 12

good 12
question 12

a 12
long 12
time 12

it 12
much 12
more 12
relaxed 12
he 12
felt 12
at 12
ease 12
and 12
comfortable 12
why 12
arent 12
you 12
in 12
school 12

social 12

it 12
social 12

talking 12
about 12

social 12
to 12

a 12
bunch 12
of 12
people 12
together 12
and 12

his 12
own 12
chemical 12
complex 12

didnt 12
know 12
what 12
there 12
was 12
about 12
the 12
afternoon 12
but 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
seeing 12
her 12
somewhere 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
the 12
lawn 12
was 12
empty 12
the 12
trees 12
empty 12
the 12
street 12
empty 12
and 12
while 12
at 12
first 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
even 12
know 12
he 12
missed 12
her 12
or 12
was 12
even 12
looking 12
for 12
her 12
the 12
fact 12
was 12
that 12
by 12
the 12
time 12
he 12
reached 12
the 12
subway 12
there 12
were 12
vague 12
stirrings 12
of 12
unease 12
in 12
him 12
something 12
was 12
the 12
matter 12
his 12
routine 12
had 12
been 12
disturbed 12
a 12
simple 12
routine 12
true 12
established 12
in 12
a 12
short 12
few 12
days 12
and 12
yet 12
he 12
almost 12
turned 12
back 12
to 12
make 12
the 12
walk 12
again 12
to 12
give 12
her 12
time 12
to 12
appear 12
he 12
was 12
certain 12
if 12
he 12
tried 12
the 12
same 12
route 12
everything 12
would 12
work 12
out 12
fine 12

in 12
his 12

a 12
cool 12
wind 12

up 12
and 12

out 12
of 12
the 12
ventilator 12
grille 12
at 12
home 12
softly 12
softly 12
chilling 12
his 12
face 12
and 12
again 12
he 12
saw 12
himself 12
in 12
a 12
green 12
park 12
talking 12
to 12
an 12
old 12
man 12
a 12

completely 12
fireproofed 12
suddenly 12
it 12

much 12
younger 12
voice 12
was 12
speaking 12
for 12

the 12

in 12
the 12

kicked 12
itself 12
two 12
hundred 12
times 12
suddenly 12
there 12
were 12
four 12
empty 12
chairs 12
the 12
cards 12
fell 12
in 12
a 12
flurry 12
of 12

the 12
brass 12

shivered 12
the 12

in 12
his 12

below 12
the 12

coughed 12
into 12
life 12
montag 12
slid 12
down 12
the 12
pole 12
like 12
a 12
man 12
in 12
a 12
dream 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
leapt 12
up 12
in 12
its 12

its 12

all 12
green 12
flame 12
montag 12
you 12
forgot 12
your 12
helmet 12
he 12
seized 12
it 12
off 12
the 12
wall 12
behind 12
him 12
ran 12
leapt 12
and 12
they 12
were 12
off 12
the 12
night 12
wind 12
hammering 12
about 12
their 12
siren 12
scream 12
and 12
their 12
mighty 12
metal 12
thunder 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
flaking 12
threestorey 12
house 12
in 12
the 12
ancient 12
part 12
of 12
the 12
city 12
a 12
century 12
old 12
if 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
day 12
but 12
like 12
all 12
houses 12
it 12
had 12
been 12
given 12
a 12
thin 12
fireproof 12
plastic 12
sheath 12
many 12
years 12
ago 12
and 12
this 12
preservative 12
shell 12
seemed 12
to 12
be 12
the 12
only 12
thing 12
holding 12
it 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
here 12
we 12
are 12
the 12
engine 12
slammed 12
to 12
a 12
stop 12
beatty 12
stoneman 12
and 12
black 12
ran 12
up 12
the 12
sidewalk 12
suddenly 12
odious 12
and 12
fat 12
in 12
the 12
plump 12
fireproof 12
slickers 12
montag 12
followed 12
they 12
crashed 12
the 12
front 12
door 12
and 12
grabbed 12
at 12
a 12
woman 12
though 12
she 12
was 12
not 12
running 12
she 12
was 12
not 12
trying 12
to 12
escape 12
she 12
was 12
only 12
standing 12
weaving 12
from 12
side 12
to 12
side 12
her 12
eyes 12
fixed 12
upon 12
a 12
nothingness 12
in 12
the 12
wall 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
had 12
struck 12
her 12
a 12
terrible 12
blow 12
upon 12
the 12
head 12
her 12
tongue 12
was 12
moving 12
in 12
her 12
mouth 12
and 12
her 12
eyes 12
seemed 12
to 12
be 12
trying 12
to 12
remember 12
something 12
and 12
then 12
they 12
remembered 12
and 12
her 12
tongue 12
moved 12
again 12
play 12

beatty 12
where 12

they 12
he 12
slapped 12
her 12
face 12
with 12
amazing 12
objectivity 12
and 12
repeated 12
the 12
question 12
the 12
old 12
womans 12
eyes 12
came 12
to 12
a 12
focus 12
upon 12

with 12

next 12
thing 12
they 12
were 12
up 12
in 12
musty 12
blackness 12
swinging 12
silver 12
hatchets 12
at 12
doors 12
that 12
were 12
after 12
all 12
unlocked 12
tumbling 12
through 12
like 12
boys 12
all 12
rollick 12
and 12
shout 12
hey 12
a 12
fountain 12
of 12
books 12
sprang 12
down 12
upon 12
montag 12
as 12
he 12
climbed 12
shuddering 12
up 12
the 12
sheer 12
stairwell 12
how 12
inconvenient 12
always 12
before 12
it 12
had 12
been 12
like 12
snuffing 12
a 12
candle 12
the 12
police 12
went 12
first 12
and 12
adhesivetaped 12
the 12
victims 12
mouth 12
and 12
bandaged 12
him 12
off 12
into 12
their 12
glittering 12
beetle 12
cars 12
so 12
when 12
you 12
arrived 12
you 12
found 12
an 12
empty 12
house 12
you 12
werent 12
hurting 12
anyone 12
you 12
were 12
hurting 12
only 12
things 12
and 12
since 12
things 12
really 12
couldnt 12
be 12
hurt 12
since 12
things 12
felt 12
nothing 12
and 12
things 12
dont 12
scream 12
or 12
whimper 12
as 12
this 12
woman 12
might 12
begin 12
to 12
scream 12
and 12
cry 12
out 12
there 12
was 12
nothing 12
to 12
tease 12
your 12
conscience 12
later 12
you 12
were 12
simply 12
cleaning 12
up 12
janitorial 12
work 12
essentially 12
everything 12
to 12
its 12
proper 12
place 12
quick 12
with 12
the 12
kerosene 12
whos 12
got 12
a 12
match 12
but 12
now 12
tonight 12
someone 12
had 12
slipped 12
this 12
woman 12
was 12
spoiling 12
the 12
ritual 12
the 12
men 12
were 12
making 12
too 12
much 12
noise 12
laughing 12
joking 12
to 12
cover 12
her 12
terrible 12
accusing 12
silence 12
below 12
she 12
made 12
the 12
empty 12
rooms 12
roar 12
with 12
accusation 12
and 12
shake 12
down 12
a 12
fine 12
dust 12
of 12
guilt 12
that 12
was 12
sucked 12
in 12
their 12
nostrils 12
as 12
they 12
plunged 12
about 12
it 12
was 12
neither 12
cricket 12
nor 12
correct 12
montag 12
felt 12
an 12
immense 12
irritation 12
she 12
shouldnt 12
be 12
here 12
on 12
top 12
of 12
everything 12
books 12
bombarded 12
his 12
shoulders 12
his 12
arms 12
his 12
upturned 12
face 12
a 12
book 12
alighted 12
almost 12
obediently 12
like 12
a 12
white 12
pigeon 12
in 12
his 12
hands 12
wings 12
fluttering 12
in 12
the 12
dim 12
wavering 12
light 12
a 12
page 12
hung 12
open 12
and 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
snowy 12
feather 12
the 12
words 12
delicately 12
painted 12
thereon 12
in 12
all 12
the 12
rush 12
and 12
fervour 12
montag 12
had 12
only 12
an 12
instant 12
to 12
read 12
a 12
line 12
but 12
it 12
blazed 12
in 12
his 12
mind 12
for 12
the 12
next 12
minute 12
as 12
if 12
stamped 12
there 12
with 12
fiery 12
steel 12
time 12
has 12
fallen 12
asleep 12
in 12
the 12
afternoon 12
sunshine 12
he 12
dropped 12
the 12
book 12
immediately 12
another 12
fell 12
into 12
his 12
arms 12
montag 12
up 12
here 12
montags 12
hand 12
closed 12
like 12
a 12
mouth 12
crushed 12
the 12
book 12
with 12
wild 12
devotion 12
with 12
an 12
insanity 12
of 12
mindlessness 12
to 12
his 12
chest 12
the 12
men 12
above 12
were 12
hurling 12
shovelfuls 12
of 12
magazines 12
into 12
the 12
dusty 12
air 12
they 12
fell 12
like 12
slaughtered 12
birds 12
and 12
the 12
woman 12
stood 12
below 12
like 12
a 12
small 12
girl 12
among 12
the 12
bodies 12
montag 12
had 12
done 12
nothing 12
his 12
hand 12
had 12
done 12
it 12
all 12
his 12
hand 12
with 12
a 12
brain 12
of 12
its 12
own 12
with 12
a 12
conscience 12
and 12
a 12
curiosity 12
in 12
each 12
trembling 12
finger 12
had 12
turned 12
thief 12
now 12
it 12
plunged 12
the 12
book 12
back 12
under 12
his 12
arm 12
pressed 12
it 12
tight 12
to 12
sweating 12
armpit 12
rushed 12
out 12
empty 12
with 12
a 12
magicians 12
flourish 12
look 12
here 12
innocent 12
look 12
he 12
gazed 12
shaken 12
at 12
that 12
white 12
hand 12
he 12
held 12
it 12
way 12
out 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
were 12
farsighted 12
he 12
held 12
it 12
close 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
were 12
blind 12
montag 12
he 12
jerked 12
about 12
dont 12

a 12

through 12
the 12

his 12
pink 12
face 12
burnt 12
and 12
shiny 12
from 12

heart 12
against 12
his 12
chest 12

the 12
woman 12
and 12
montag 12
felt 12
himself 12
back 12
away 12

across 12
the 12

where 12
the 12
path 12
of 12
kerosene 12
lay 12
like 12
the 12
track 12
of 12
some 12
evil 12
snail 12
on 12
the 12
front 12
porch 12
where 12
she 12
had 12
come 12
to 12
weigh 12
them 12
quietly 12
with 12
her 12
eyes 12
her 12
quietness 12
a 12
condemnation 12
the 12
woman 12
stood 12
motionless 12
beatty 12
flicked 12
his 12
fingers 12
to 12

the 12
kerosene 12

the 12
porch 12
reached 12
out 12
with 12
contempt 12
for 12
them 12
all 12
and 12
struck 12
the 12
kitchen 12
match 12
against 12
the 12
railing 12

ran 12
out 12

out 12
of 12
the 12

of 12
the 12
great 12
salamander 12
as 12

the 12

that 12
to 12
a 12
man 12

went 12
back 12
to 12
looking 12
at 12

moved 12
under 12
the 12
engine 12

by 12
the 12
corner 12
where 12
we 12

for 12
the 12
firehouse 12
who 12

said 12
montag 12
leaning 12
back 12
against 12
the 12
closed 12
door 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
his 12
wife 12

to 12

he 12
heard 12
her 12
roll 12
impatiently 12
the 12
bedsprings 12
squealed 12
are 12
you 12
drunk 12
she 12
said 12
so 12
it 12
was 12
the 12
hand 12
that 12
started 12
it 12
all 12
he 12
felt 12
one 12
hand 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
other 12
work 12
his 12
coat 12
free 12
and 12
let 12
it 12
slump 12
to 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
held 12
his 12
pants 12
out 12
into 12
an 12
abyss 12
and 12
let 12
them 12
fall 12
into 12
darkness 12
his 12
hands 12
had 12
been 12
infected 12
and 12
soon 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
his 12
arms 12
he 12
could 12
feel 12
the 12
poison 12
working 12
up 12
his 12
wrists 12
and 12
into 12
his 12
elbows 12
and 12
his 12
shoulders 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
jumpover 12
from 12
shoulderblade 12
to 12
shoulderblade 12
like 12
a 12
spark 12
leaping 12
a 12
gap 12
his 12
hands 12
were 12
ravenous 12
and 12
his 12
eyes 12
were 12
beginning 12
to 12
feel 12
hunger 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
must 12
look 12
at 12
something 12
anything 12
everything 12
his 12
wife 12
said 12
what 12
are 12
you 12
doing 12
he 12
balanced 12
in 12
space 12
with 12
the 12
book 12
in 12
his 12
sweating 12
cold 12
fingers 12
a 12
minute 12
later 12
she 12
said 12
well 12
just 12
dont 12
stand 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
made 12
a 12
small 12
sound 12
what 12
she 12
asked 12
he 12
made 12
more 12
soft 12
sounds 12
he 12
stumbled 12
towards 12
the 12
bed 12
and 12
shoved 12
the 12
book 12
clumsily 12
under 12
the 12
cold 12
pillow 12
he 12
fell 12
into 12
bed 12
and 12
his 12
wife 12
cried 12
out 12
startled 12
he 12
lay 12
far 12
across 12
the 12
room 12
from 12
her 12
on 12
a 12
winter 12
island 12
separated 12
by 12
an 12
empty 12
sea 12
she 12
talked 12
to 12
him 12
for 12
what 12
seemed 12
a 12
long 12
while 12
and 12
she 12
talked 12
about 12
this 12
and 12
she 12
talked 12
about 12
that 12
and 12
it 12
was 12
only 12
words 12
like 12
the 12
words 12
he 12
had 12
heard 12
once 12
in 12
a 12
nursery 12
at 12
a 12
friends 12
house 12
a 12
twoyearold 12
child 12
building 12
word 12
patterns 12
talking 12
jargon 12
making 12
pretty 12
sounds 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
but 12
montag 12
said 12
nothing 12
and 12
after 12
a 12
long 12
while 12
when 12
he 12
only 12
made 12
the 12
small 12
sounds 12
he 12
felt 12
her 12
move 12
in 12
the 12
room 12
and 12
come 12
to 12
his 12
bed 12
and 12
stand 12
over 12
him 12
and 12
put 12
her 12
hand 12
down 12
to 12
feel 12
his 12
cheek 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
when 12
she 12
pulled 12
her 12
hand 12
away 12
from 12
his 12
face 12
it 12
was 12
wet 12
late 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
he 12
looked 12
over 12
at 12
mildred 12
she 12
was 12
awake 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
tiny 12
dance 12
of 12
melody 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
her 12
seashell 12
was 12
tamped 12
in 12
her 12
ear 12
again 12
and 12
she 12
was 12
listening 12
to 12
far 12
people 12
in 12
far 12
places 12
her 12
eyes 12
wide 12
and 12
staring 12
at 12
the 12
fathoms 12
of 12
blackness 12
above 12
her 12
in 12
the 12
ceiling 12
wasnt 12
there 12
an 12
old 12
joke 12
about 12
the 12
wife 12
who 12
talked 12
so 12
much 12
on 12
the 12
telephone 12
that 12
her 12
desperate 12
husband 12
ran 12
out 12
to 12
the 12
nearest 12
store 12
and 12
telephoned 12
her 12
to 12
ask 12
what 12
was 12
for 12
dinner 12
well 12
then 12
why 12
didnt 12

what 12

suddenly 12

asked 12
i 12

originally 12
he 12
knew 12
she 12
must 12
be 12
frowning 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
he 12
clarified 12
it 12
the 12
first 12
time 12
we 12
ever 12
met 12
where 12
was 12

and 12

was 12
at 12
she 12
stopped 12
i 12
dont 12

she 12
said 12
he 12
was 12
cold 12
cant 12
you 12

its 12
been 12
so 12
long 12
only 12
ten 12
years 12
thats 12
all 12
only 12
ten 12
dont 12
get 12
excited 12
im 12
trying 12
to 12
think 12
she 12
laughed 12
an 12
odd 12
little 12
laugh 12
that 12
went 12
up 12
and 12
up 12
funny 12
how 12
funny 12
not 12
to 12
remember 12
where 12
or 12
when 12
you 12
met 12
your 12
husband 12
or 12
wife 12
he 12
lay 12
massaging 12
his 12
eyes 12
his 12
brow 12
and 12
the 12
back 12
of 12
his 12
neck 12
slowly 12
he 12
held 12
both 12
hands 12
over 12
his 12
eyes 12
and 12
applied 12
a 12
steady 12
pressure 12
there 12
as 12
if 12
to 12
crush 12
memory 12
into 12
place 12
it 12
was 12
suddenly 12
more 12
important 12
than 12
any 12
other 12
thing 12
in 12
a 12
lifetime 12
that 12
he 12
knew 12
where 12
he 12
had 12
met 12
mildred 12
it 12
doesnt 12
matter 12
she 12
was 12
up 12
in 12
the 12
bathroom 12
now 12
and 12
he 12
heard 12
the 12
water 12
running 12
and 12
the 12
swallowing 12
sound 12
she 12
made 12
no 12
i 12
guess 12
not 12
he 12
said 12
he 12
tried 12
to 12
count 12
how 12
many 12
times 12
she 12
swallowed 12
and 12
he 12
thought 12
of 12
the 12
visit 12
from 12
the 12
two 12
zincoxidefaced 12
men 12
with 12
the 12
cigarettes 12
in 12
their 12
straightlined 12
mouths 12
and 12
the 12
electroniceyed 12
snake 12
winding 12
down 12
into 12
the 12
layer 12
upon 12
layer 12
of 12
night 12
and 12
stone 12
and 12
stagnant 12
spring 12
water 12
and 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
call 12
out 12
to 12
her 12
how 12
many 12
have 12
you 12
taken 12
tonight 12
the 12
capsules 12
how 12
many 12
will 12
you 12
take 12
later 12
and 12
not 12
know 12
and 12
so 12
on 12
every 12
hour 12
or 12
maybe 12
not 12
tonight 12
tomorrow 12
night 12
and 12
me 12
not 12
sleeping 12
tonight 12
or 12
tomorrow 12
night 12
or 12
any 12
night 12
for 12
a 12
long 12
while 12
now 12
that 12
this 12
has 12
started 12
and 12
he 12
thought 12
of 12
her 12
lying 12
on 12
the 12
bed 12
with 12
the 12
two 12
technicians 12
standing 12
straight 12
over 12
her 12
not 12
bent 12
with 12
concern 12
but 12
only 12
standing 12
straight 12
arms 12
folded 12
and 12
he 12
remembered 12
thinking 12
then 12
that 12
if 12
she 12
died 12
he 12
was 12
certain 12
he 12
wouldnt 12
cry 12
for 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
the 12
dying 12
of 12
an 12
unknown 12
a 12
street 12
face 12
a 12
newspaper 12
image 12
and 12
it 12
was 12
suddenly 12
so 12
very 12
wrong 12
that 12
he 12
had 12
begun 12
to 12
cry 12
not 12
at 12
death 12
but 12
at 12
the 12
thought 12
of 12
not 12
crying 12
at 12
death 12
a 12
silly 12
empty 12
man 12
near 12
a 12
silly 12
empty 12
woman 12
while 12
the 12
hungry 12
snake 12
made 12
her 12
still 12
more 12
empty 12
how 12
do 12
you 12
get 12
so 12
empty 12
he 12
wondered 12
who 12
takes 12
it 12
out 12
of 12
you 12
and 12
that 12
awful 12
flower 12
the 12
other 12
day 12
the 12
dandelion 12
it 12
had 12
summed 12
up 12
everything 12
hadnt 12
it 12
what 12
a 12
shame 12
youre 12
not 12
in 12
love 12
with 12
anyone 12
and 12
why 12
not 12
well 12
wasnt 12
there 12
a 12
wall 12
between 12
him 12
and 12
mildred 12
when 12
you 12
came 12
down 12
to 12
it 12
literally 12
not 12
just 12
one 12
wall 12
but 12
so 12
far 12
three 12
and 12
expensive 12
too 12
and 12
the 12
uncles 12
the 12
aunts 12
the 12
cousins 12
the 12
nieces 12
the 12
nephews 12
that 12
lived 12
in 12
those 12
walls 12
the 12
gibbering 12
pack 12
of 12
treeapes 12
that 12
said 12
nothing 12
nothing 12
nothing 12
and 12
said 12
it 12
loud 12
loud 12
loud 12
he 12
had 12
taken 12
to 12
calling 12
them 12
relatives 12
from 12
the 12
very 12
first 12
hows 12
uncle 12
louis 12
today 12
who 12
and 12
aunt 12
maude 12
the 12
most 12
significant 12
memory 12
he 12
had 12
of 12
mildred 12
really 12
was 12
of 12
a 12
little 12
girl 12
in 12
a 12
forest 12
without 12
trees 12
how 12
odd 12
or 12
rather 12
a 12
little 12
girl 12
lost 12
on 12
a 12
plateau 12
where 12
there 12
used 12
to 12
be 12
trees 12
you 12
could 12
feel 12
the 12
memory 12
of 12
their 12
shapes 12
all 12
about 12
sitting 12
in 12
the 12
centre 12
of 12
the 12
livingroom 12
the 12
livingroom 12
what 12
a 12
good 12
job 12
of 12
labelling 12
that 12
was 12
now 12
no 12
matter 12
when 12
he 12
came 12
in 12
the 12
walls 12
were 12
always 12
talking 12
to 12
mildred 12
something 12
must 12
be 12
done 12
yes 12
something 12
must 12
be 12
done 12
well 12
lets 12
not 12
stand 12
and 12
talk 12
lets 12
do 12
it 12
im 12
so 12
mad 12
i 12
could 12
spit 12
what 12
was 12
it 12
all 12
about 12
mildred 12
couldnt 12
say 12
who 12
was 12
mad 12
at 12
whom 12
mildred 12
didnt 12
quite 12
know 12
what 12
were 12
they 12
going 12
to 12
do 12
well 12
said 12
mildred 12
wait 12
around 12
and 12
see 12
he 12
had 12
waited 12
around 12
to 12
see 12
a 12
great 12
thunderstorm 12
of 12
sound 12
gushed 12
from 12
the 12
walls 12
music 12
bombarded 12
him 12
at 12
such 12
an 12
immense 12
volume 12
that 12
his 12
bones 12
were 12
almost 12
shaken 12
from 12
their 12
tendons 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
jaw 12
vibrate 12
his 12
eyes 12
wobble 12
in 12
his 12
head 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
victim 12
of 12
concussion 12
when 12
it 12
was 12
all 12
over 12
he 12
felt 12
like 12
a 12
man 12
who 12
had 12
been 12
thrown 12
from 12
a 12
cliff 12
whirled 12
in 12
a 12
centrifuge 12
and 12
spat 12
out 12
over 12
a 12
waterfall 12
that 12
fell 12
and 12
fell 12
into 12
emptiness 12
and 12
emptiness 12
and 12
neverquitetouchedbottomneverneverquiteno 12
not 12
quitetouchedbottom 12
and 12
you 12
fell 12
so 12
fast 12
you 12
didnt 12
touch 12
the 12
sides 12
either 12
never 12
quite 12
touched 12
anything 12
the 12
thunder 12
faded 12
the 12
music 12
died 12
there 12
said 12
mildred 12
and 12
it 12
was 12
indeed 12
remarkable 12
something 12
had 12
happened 12
even 12
though 12
the 12
people 12
in 12
the 12
walls 12
of 12
the 12
room 12
had 12
barely 12
moved 12
and 12
nothing 12
had 12
really 12
been 12
settled 12
you 12
had 12
the 12
impression 12
that 12
someone 12
had 12
turned 12
on 12
a 12
washingmachine 12
or 12
sucked 12
you 12
up 12
in 12
a 12
gigantic 12
vacuum 12
you 12
drowned 12
in 12
music 12
and 12
pure 12
cacophony 12
he 12
came 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
room 12
sweating 12
and 12
on 12
the 12
point 12
of 12
collapse 12
behind 12
him 12
mildred 12
sat 12
in 12
her 12
chair 12
and 12
the 12
voices 12
went 12
on 12
again 12
well 12
everything 12
will 12
be 12
all 12
right 12
now 12
said 12
an 12
aunt 12
oh 12

be 12
too 12
sure 12
said 12
a 12
cousin 12

angry 12

montag 12
but 12
what 12

mad 12
about 12

people 12

man 12
and 12

said 12
mildred 12
well 12

had 12
this 12
fight 12

think 12

why 12
and 12
if 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
the 12
three 12
walls 12
soon 12
to 12
be 12
four 12
walls 12
and 12
the 12
dream 12
complete 12
then 12
it 12
was 12
the 12
open 12
car 12
and 12
mildred 12
driving 12
a 12
hundred 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
across 12
town 12
he 12
shouting 12
at 12
her 12
and 12
she 12
shouting 12
back 12
and 12
both 12
trying 12
to 12
hear 12
what 12
was 12
said 12
but 12
hearing 12
only 12
the 12
scream 12
of 12
the 12
car 12
at 12
least 12
keep 12
it 12
down 12
to 12
the 12
minimum 12
he 12
yelled 12
what 12
she 12
cried 12
keep 12
it 12
down 12
to 12
fiftyfive 12
the 12
minimum 12
he 12
shouted 12
the 12
what 12
she 12
shrieked 12
speed 12
he 12
shouted 12
and 12
she 12
pushed 12
it 12
up 12
to 12
one 12
hundred 12
and 12
five 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
and 12
tore 12
the 12
breath 12
from 12
his 12
mouth 12
when 12
they 12
stepped 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
car 12
she 12
had 12
the 12
seashells 12
stuffed 12
in 12
her 12
ears 12
silence 12

there 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
room 12

he 12
heard 12
a 12
faint 12
rustle 12
her 12
hands 12
moved 12
the 12
electric 12
thimble 12
moved 12
like 12
a 12
praying 12
mantis 12
on 12
the 12
pillow 12
touched 12
by 12
her 12
hand 12
now 12
it 12
was 12
in 12
her 12
ear 12
again 12
humming 12
he 12
listened 12
and 12
his 12
wife 12
was 12
singing 12
under 12
her 12
breath 12
outside 12
the 12
house 12
a 12
shadow 12
moved 12
an 12
autumn 12
wind 12
rose 12
up 12
and 12
faded 12
away 12
but 12
there 12
was 12
something 12
else 12
in 12
the 12
silence 12
that 12
he 12
heard 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
breath 12
exhaled 12
upon 12
the 12
window 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
faint 12
drift 12
of 12
greenish 12
luminescent 12
smoke 12
the 12
motion 12
of 12
a 12
single 12
huge 12
october 12
leaf 12
blowing 12
across 12
the 12
lawn 12
and 12
away 12
the 12
hound 12

the 12
parlour 12
mildred 12
stood 12
over 12
his 12
bed 12
curiously 12
he 12
felt 12
her 12
there 12
he 12
saw 12
her 12
without 12
opening 12
his 12
eyes 12
her 12
hair 12
burnt 12
by 12
chemicals 12
to 12
a 12
brittle 12
straw 12
her 12
eyes 12
with 12
a 12
kind 12
of 12
cataract 12
unseen 12
but 12
suspect 12
far 12
behind 12
the 12
pupils 12
the 12
reddened 12
pouting 12
lips 12
the 12
body 12
as 12
thin 12
as 12
a 12
praying 12
mantis 12
from 12
dieting 12
and 12
her 12
flesh 12
like 12

them 12
the 12
parlour 12
was 12
playing 12
a 12
dance 12
tune 12
this 12
is 12
the 12
day 12
you 12
go 12
on 12
the 12
early 12
shift 12
said 12
mildred 12
you 12
should 12
have 12
gone 12
two 12
hours 12
ago 12
i 12
just 12
noticed 12
its 12
not 12

the 12
woman 12
that 12
died 12
said 12
montag 12
last 12
night 12
i 12
thought 12
about 12
all 12
the 12
kerosene 12
ive 12
used 12
in 12
the 12
past 12
ten 12
years 12
and 12
i 12
thought 12
about 12
books 12
and 12
for 12
the 12
first 12
time 12
i 12
realized 12
that 12
a 12
man 12
was 12
behind 12
each 12
one 12
of 12
the 12
books 12
a 12
man 12
had 12
to 12
think 12
them 12
up 12
a 12
man 12
had 12
to 12
take 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
to 12
put 12
them 12
down 12
on 12
paper 12
and 12
id 12
never 12
even 12
thought 12
that 12
thought 12
before 12
he 12
got 12
out 12
of 12
bed 12
it 12
took 12
some 12
man 12
a 12
lifetime 12
maybe 12
to 12
put 12
some 12
of 12
his 12
thoughts 12
down 12
looking 12
around 12
at 12
the 12
world 12
and 12
life 12
and 12
then 12
i 12
came 12
along 12
in 12
two 12
minutes 12
and 12
boom 12
its 12
all 12
over 12
let 12
me 12
alone 12
said 12
mildred 12

do 12
anything 12
let 12
you 12
alone 12

all 12
very 12
well 12
but 12
how 12
can 12
i 12
leave 12
myself 12
alone 12
we 12
need 12
not 12
to 12
be 12
let 12
alone 12
we 12
need 12
to 12
be 12
really 12
bothered 12
once 12
in 12
a 12
while 12
how 12
long 12
is 12
it 12
since 12
you 12
were 12
really 12
bothered 12
about 12
something 12
important 12
about 12
something 12
real 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
shut 12
up 12
for 12
he 12
remembered 12
last 12
week 12
and 12
the 12
two 12
white 12
stones 12
staring 12
up 12

and 12
the 12
pumpsnake 12
with 12
the 12
probing 12

the 12
two 12
soapfaced 12
men 12
with 12
the 12
cigarettes 12
moving 12
in 12

a 12
full 12
minute 12
to 12
settle 12
himself 12
in 12
and 12
think 12
back 12
for 12
what 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
say 12
when 12
did 12

all 12
start 12
you 12
ask 12
this 12

how 12
did 12
it 12
come 12
about 12
where 12
when 12
well 12
id 12

about 12
a 12
thing 12
called 12

our 12
rulebook 12
claims 12
it 12
was 12
founded 12
earlier 12
the 12
fact 12
is 12
we 12
didnt 12
get 12
along 12
well 12
until 12

beatty 12

afford 12
to 12

the 12

beatty 12
leaned 12
forward 12
in 12
the 12
faint 12
mist 12
of 12
smoke 12
from 12
his 12
pipe 12
what 12
more 12
easily 12

and 12
imaginative 12
creators 12
the 12
word 12
intellectual 12
of 12

became 12
the 12
swear 12
word 12
it 12
deserved 12
to 12
be 12
you 12
always 12
dread 12
the 12
unfamiliar 12
surely 12
you 12
remember 12
the 12
boy 12
in 12
your 12
own 12
school 12
class 12
who 12
was 12
exceptionally 12
bright 12
did 12
most 12
of 12
the 12
reciting 12
and 12
answering 12
while 12
the 12
others 12
sat 12
like 12
so 12
many 12
leaden 12
idols 12
hating 12
him 12
and 12
wasnt 12
it 12
this 12
bright 12
boy 12
you 12
selected 12
for 12
beatings 12
and 12
tortures 12
after 12
hours 12
of 12
course 12
it 12
was 12
we 12
must 12
all 12
be 12
alike 12
not 12
everyone 12
born 12
free 12
and 12
equal 12
as 12
the 12
constitution 12
says 12
but 12
everyone 12
made 12
equal 12
each 12
man 12
the 12
image 12
of 12
every 12
other 12
then 12
all 12
are 12
happy 12
for 12
there 12
are 12
no 12
mountains 12
to 12
make 12
them 12
cower 12
to 12
judge 12
themselves 12
against 12
so 12
a 12
book 12
is 12
a 12
loaded 12
gun 12
in 12
the 12
house 12
next 12
door 12
burn 12
it 12
take 12
the 12
shot 12
from 12
the 12
weapon 12
breach 12
mans 12
mind 12
who 12
knows 12
who 12
might 12
be 12
the 12
target 12
of 12
the 12
wellread 12
man 12
me 12
i 12
wont 12
stomach 12
them 12
for 12
a 12
minute 12
and 12
so 12
when 12
houses 12
were 12
finally 12
fireproofed 12
completely 12
all 12
over 12
the 12
world 12
you 12
were 12
correct 12
in 12
your 12
assumption 12
the 12
other 12
night 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
longer 12
need 12
of 12
firemen 12
for 12
the 12
old 12
purposes 12
they 12
were 12
given 12
the 12
new 12
job 12
as 12
custodians 12
of 12
our 12
peace 12
of 12
mind 12
the 12
focus 12
of 12
our 12
understandable 12
and 12
rightful 12
dread 12
of 12
being 12
inferior 12
official 12
censors 12
judges 12
and 12
executors 12
thats 12
you 12
montag 12
and 12
thats 12
me 12
the 12
door 12
to 12
the 12
parlour 12
opened 12
and 12
mildred 12
stood 12
there 12
looking 12
in 12
at 12
them 12
looking 12
at 12
beatty 12
and 12
then 12
at 12
montag 12
behind 12
her 12
the 12
walls 12
of 12
the 12
room 12
were 12
flooded 12
with 12
green 12
and 12
yellow 12
and 12
orange 12
fireworks 12
sizzling 12
and 12
bursting 12
to 12
some 12
music 12
composed 12
almost 12
completely 12
of 12
trapdrums 12
tomtoms 12
and 12
cymbals 12
her 12
mouth 12
moved 12
and 12
she 12
was 12
saying 12
something 12
but 12
the 12
sound 12
covered 12
it 12
beatty 12
knocked 12
his 12
pipe 12
into 12
the 12
palm 12
of 12
his 12
pink 12
hand 12
studied 12
the 12
ashes 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
were 12
a 12
symbol 12
to 12
be 12
diagnosed 12
and 12
searched 12
for 12
meaning 12
you 12
must 12
understand 12
that 12
our 12
civilization 12
is 12
so 12
vast 12
that 12
we 12
cant 12
have 12
our 12
minorities 12
upset 12
and 12
stirred 12
ask 12
yourself 12

funny 12
things 12
you 12
cant 12
rid 12
yourselves 12
of 12
all 12
the 12
odd 12
ducks 12
in 12
just 12
a 12
few 12
years 12
the 12
home 12
environment 12
can 12
undo 12
a 12
lot 12
you 12
try 12
to 12
do 12
at 12
school 12
thats 12
why 12
weve 12
lowered 12
the 12

them 12
from 12
the 12
cradle 12
we 12
had 12
some 12
false 12
alarms 12
on 12
the 12
mcclellans 12
when 12
they 12
lived 12
in 12
chicago 12
never 12

from 12
what 12
i 12
saw 12
of 12
her 12
school 12

she 12
didnt 12
want 12
to 12
know 12
how 12
a 12
thing 12
was 12
done 12
but 12
why 12
that 12
can 12
be 12
embarrassing 12
you 12
ask 12
why 12
to 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
things 12
and 12
you 12
wind 12
up 12
very 12
unhappy 12
indeed 12
if 12
you 12
keep 12
at 12

her 12
dont 12
happen 12
often 12
we 12
know 12
how 12
to 12
nip 12
most 12
of 12
them 12
in 12
the 12
bud 12
early 12
you 12
cant 12
build 12
a 12
house 12
without 12
nails 12
and 12
wood 12
if 12
you 12
dont 12
want 12
a 12
house 12
built 12
hide 12
the 12
nails 12
and 12
wood 12
if 12
you 12
dont 12
want 12
a 12
man 12
unhappy 12
politically 12
dont 12

such 12
a 12
thing 12
as 12
war 12
if 12
the 12
government 12
is 12
inefficient 12
topheavy 12
and 12
taxmad 12
better 12
it 12
be 12
all 12
those 12
than 12
that 12
people 12
worry 12
over 12

peace 12
montag 12
give 12
the 12
people 12
contests 12

by 12
remembering 12
the 12
words 12
to 12
more 12
popular 12
songs 12
or 12
the 12
names 12

stuffed 12
but 12
absolutely 12
brilliant 12
with 12
information 12
then 12
theyll 12
feel 12
theyre 12
thinking 12
theyll 12
get 12
a 12
sense 12
of 12
motion 12
without 12
moving 12
and 12
theyll 12
be 12
happy 12
because 12
facts 12
of 12
that 12
sort 12
dont 12
change 12
dont 12
give 12
them 12
any 12
slippery 12
stuff 12
like 12
philosophy 12
or 12
sociology 12
to 12
tie 12
things 12
up 12

most 12
men 12
can 12
nowadays 12

happier 12
than 12
any 12
man 12
who 12
tries 12
to 12
sliderule 12
measure 12
and 12
equate 12
the 12
universe 12
which 12
just 12
wont 12
be 12
measured 12
or 12
equated 12
without 12

small 12
tide 12
of 12
those 12
who 12
want 12
to 12
make 12
everyone 12
unhappy 12
with 12
conflicting 12
theory 12
and 12
thought 12
we 12
have 12
our 12
fingers 12
in 12
the 12
dyke 12
hold 12
steady 12
dont 12
let 12
the 12
torrent 12

drear 12
philosophy 12
drown 12
our 12
world 12
we 12
depend 12
on 12
you 12
i 12
dont 12
think 12

realize 12
how 12
important 12
you 12
are 12
to 12
our 12
happy 12
world 12
as 12

montags 12
limp 12
hand 12
montag 12

as 12
if 12
the 12
house 12
were 12
collapsing 12
about 12
him 12
and 12
he 12
could 12
not 12
move 12
in 12
the 12
bed 12
mildred 12
had 12
vanished 12
from 12
the 12
door 12
one 12
last 12
thing 12
said 12
beatty 12
at 12
least 12
once 12
in 12
his 12
career 12
every 12
fireman 12
gets 12
an 12
itch 12
what 12
do 12
the 12
books 12

for 12
it 12
ive 12
had 12
to 12
read 12
a 12
few 12
in 12
my 12
time 12
to 12
know 12
what 12
i 12
was 12
about 12
and 12
the 12
books 12
say 12
nothing 12
nothing 12
you 12
can 12
teach 12
or 12
believe 12
theyre 12
about 12
nonexistent 12
people 12
figments 12
of 12
imagination 12
if 12
theyre 12
fiction 12
and 12
if 12
theyre 12
nonfiction 12
its 12
worse 12
one 12
professor 12
calling 12
another 12
an 12
idiot 12
one 12
philosopher 12
screaming 12
down 12
anothers 12
gullet 12
all 12
of 12
them 12
running 12
about 12
putting 12
out 12
the 12
stars 12
and 12
extinguishing 12
the 12
sun 12
you 12
come 12
away 12
lost 12
well 12
then 12
what 12
if 12
a 12
fireman 12
accidentally 12
really 12
not 12
intending 12
anything 12
takes 12
a 12
book 12
home 12
with 12
him 12
montag 12
twitched 12
the 12
open 12
door 12
looked 12
at 12
him 12
with 12
its 12
great 12
vacant 12
eye 12
a 12
natural 12
error 12
curiosity 12
alone 12
said 12
beatty 12
we 12
dont 12
get 12
overanxious 12
or 12
mad 12
we 12
let 12
the 12
fireman 12
keep 12
the 12
book 12
twentyfour 12
hours 12
if 12
he 12
hasnt 12
burned 12
it 12
by 12
then 12
we 12
simply 12
come 12
and 12
burn 12
it 12
for 12
him 12
of 12
course 12
montags 12
mouth 12
was 12
dry 12
well 12
montag 12
will 12
you 12
take 12
another 12
later 12

we 12
see 12
you 12
tonight 12
perhaps 12
i 12
dont 12
know 12
said 12
montag 12
what 12
beatty 12
looked 12
faintly 12
surprised 12
montag 12
shut 12
his 12
eyes 12
ill 12
be 12
in 12
later 12
maybe 12
wed 12
certainly 12
miss 12
you 12
if 12
you 12
didnt 12
show 12
said 12
beatty 12
putting 12
his 12
pipe 12
in 12
his 12
pocket 12
thoughtfully 12
ill 12
never 12
come 12
in 12
again 12
thought 12
montag 12
get 12
well 12
and 12
keep 12
well 12
said 12
beatty 12
he 12
turned 12
and 12
went 12
out 12
through 12
the 12
open 12
door 12
montag 12
watched 12
through 12
the 12
window 12
as 12
beatty 12
drove 12
away 12
in 12
his 12
gleaming 12
yellowflamecoloured 12
beetle 12
with 12
the 12
black 12
charcoloured 12
tyres 12
across 12
the 12
street 12
and 12
down 12
the 12
way 12
the 12
other 12
houses 12
stood 12
with 12
their 12
flat 12
fronts 12
what 12
was 12
it 12
clarisse 12
had 12
said 12
one 12
afternoon 12
no 12
front 12
porches 12
my 12
uncle 12
says 12
there 12
used 12
to 12
be 12
front 12
porches 12
and 12
people 12
sat 12
there 12
sometimes 12
at 12
night 12
talking 12
when 12
they 12
wanted 12
to 12
talk 12
rocking 12
and 12
not 12
talking 12
when 12
they 12
didnt 12
want 12
to 12
talk 12
sometimes 12
they 12
just 12
sat 12
there 12
and 12
thought 12
about 12
things 12
turned 12
things 12
over 12
my 12
uncle 12
says 12
the 12
architects 12
got 12
rid 12
of 12
the 12
front 12
porches 12
because 12
they 12
didnt 12
look 12
well 12
but 12
my 12
uncle 12
says 12
that 12
was 12
merely 12
rationalizing 12
it 12
the 12
real 12
reason 12
hidden 12
underneath 12
might 12
be 12
they 12
didnt 12
want 12
people 12
sitting 12
like 12
that 12
doing 12
nothing 12
rocking 12
talking 12
that 12
was 12
the 12
wrong 12
kind 12
of 12
social 12
life 12
people 12
talked 12
too 12
much 12
and 12
they 12
had 12
time 12
to 12
think 12
so 12
they 12
ran 12
off 12
with 12
the 12
porches 12
and 12
the 12
gardens 12
too 12
not 12
many 12
gardens 12
any 12
more 12
to 12
sit 12
around 12
in 12
and 12
look 12
at 12
the 12
furniture 12
no 12
rockingchairs 12
any 12
more 12
theyre 12
too 12
comfortable 12
get 12
people 12
up 12
and 12
running 12
around 12
my 12
uncle 12
says 12
and 12
my 12
uncle 12
and 12
my 12
uncle 12
her 12
voice 12
faded 12
montag 12
turned 12
and 12
looked 12
at 12
his 12

sat 12
in 12
the 12

of 12

her 12
name 12
whenever 12
the 12
announcer 12
addressed 12
his 12
anonymous 12
audience 12
leaving 12
a 12
blank 12
where 12
the 12
proper 12
syllables 12
could 12
be 12
filled 12
in 12
a 12
special 12
spotwavescrambler 12

during 12
the 12
past 12
year 12

and 12
again 12
once 12
in 12
a 12
while 12

and 12
i 12
never 12

he 12
took 12
hold 12
of 12
a 12
straightbacked 12
chair 12
and 12
moved 12
it 12
slowly 12
and 12
steadily 12
into 12
the 12
hall 12
near 12
the 12
front 12
door 12
and 12
climbed 12
up 12
on 12
it 12
and 12
stood 12
for 12
a 12
moment 12
like 12
a 12
statue 12
on 12
a 12
pedestal 12
his 12
wife 12
standing 12
under 12
him 12
waiting 12
then 12
he 12
reached 12
up 12
and 12
pulled 12
back 12
the 12
grille 12
of 12
the 12
airconditioning 12
system 12
and 12
reached 12
far 12
back 12
inside 12
to 12
the 12
right 12
and 12
moved 12
still 12
another 12
sliding 12
sheet 12
of 12
metal 12
and 12
took 12
out 12
a 12
book 12
without 12
looking 12
at 12
it 12
he 12
dropped 12
it 12
to 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
put 12
his 12
hand 12
back 12
up 12
and 12
took 12
out 12
two 12
books 12
and 12
moved 12
his 12
hand 12
down 12
and 12
dropped 12
the 12
two 12
books 12
to 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
kept 12
moving 12
his 12
hand 12
and 12
dropping 12
books 12
small 12
ones 12
fairly 12
large 12
ones 12
yellow 12
red 12
green 12
ones 12
when 12
he 12
was 12
done 12
he 12
looked 12
down 12
upon 12
some 12
twenty 12
books 12
lying 12
at 12
his 12
wifes 12
feet 12
im 12
sorry 12
he 12
said 12
i 12
didnt 12
really 12
think 12
but 12
now 12
it 12
looks 12
as 12
if 12
were 12
in 12
this 12
together 12
mildred 12
backed 12
away 12
as 12
if 12
she 12
were 12
suddenly 12
confronted 12
by 12
a 12
pack 12
of 12
mice 12
that 12
had 12
come 12
up 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
floor 12
he 12
could 12
hear 12
her 12
breathing 12
rapidly 12
and 12
her 12
face 12
was 12
paled 12
out 12
and 12
her 12
eyes 12
were 12
fastened 12
wide 12
she 12
said 12
his 12
name 12
over 12
twice 12
three 12
times 12
then 12
moaning 12
she 12
ran 12
forward 12
seized 12
a 12
book 12
and 12
ran 12
toward 12
the 12
kitchen 12
incinerator 12
he 12
caught 12
her 12
shrieking 12
he 12
held 12
her 12
and 12
she 12
tried 12
to 12
fight 12
away 12
from 12
him 12
scratching 12
no 12
millie 12

he 12
slapped 12
her 12
face 12
he 12
grabbed 12
her 12
again 12
and 12
shook 12
her 12
she 12
said 12
his 12
name 12
and 12
began 12
to 12
cry 12

looked 12
down 12
into 12
her 12
face 12
and 12
took 12
hold 12
of 12
her 12
chin 12
and 12
held 12
her 12
firmly 12
he 12
was 12
looking 12
not 12
only 12
at 12
her 12
but 12
for 12
himself 12
and 12
what 12
he 12
must 12
do 12
in 12
her 12
face 12

on 12
to 12
someone 12
else 12
she 12

he 12
let 12
her 12
go 12
she 12
sagged 12
away 12
from 12
him 12
and 12
slid 12
down 12
the 12
wall 12
and 12
sat 12
on 12
the 12
floor 12
looking 12
at 12
the 12
books 12
her 12
foot 12
touched 12
one 12
and 12
she 12

bewilderedly 12
with 12
his 12
thumb 12
his 12
forefinger 12

door 12
waiting 12
listening 12
then 12
the 12

with 12
a 12
terrible 12
selfconsciousness 12

upon 12

and 12
threw 12
the 12
book 12
down 12
montag 12
he 12
said 12
youre 12
really 12
stupid 12
where 12

from 12
here 12

turn 12
the 12
books 12
in 12
forget 12
it 12
he 12
opened 12
the 12
book 12
to 12
read 12
over 12
mildreds 12
laughter 12
poor 12
millie 12
he 12
thought 12
poor 12
montag 12
its 12
mud 12
to 12
you 12
too 12
but 12
where 12
do 12
you 12
get 12
help 12
where 12
do 12
you 12
find 12
a 12
teacher 12
this 12
late 12
hold 12
on 12
he 12
shut 12
his 12
eyes 12
yes 12
of 12
course 12
again 12
he 12
found 12
himself 12
thinking 12
of 12
the 12
green 12
park 12
a 12
year 12
ago 12
the 12
thought 12
had 12
been 12
with 12
him 12
many 12
times 12
recently 12
but 12
now 12
he 12
remembered 12
how 12
it 12
was 12
that 12
day 12
in 12
the 12
city 12
park 12
when 12
he 12
had 12
seen 12
that 12
old 12
man 12
in 12
the 12
black 12
suit 12
hide 12
something 12
quickly 12
in 12
his 12
coat 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
leapt 12
up 12
as 12
if 12
to 12
run 12
and 12
montag 12
said 12
wait 12
i 12
havent 12
done 12
anything 12
cried 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
trembling 12
no 12
one 12
said 12
you 12
did 12
they 12
had 12
sat 12
in 12
the 12
green 12
soft 12
light 12
without 12
saying 12
a 12
word 12
for 12
a 12
moment 12
and 12
then 12
montag 12
talked 12
about 12
the 12
weather 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
responded 12
with 12
a 12
pale 12
voice 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
strange 12
quiet 12
meeting 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
admitted 12
to 12
being 12
a 12
retired 12
english 12
professor 12
who 12
had 12
been 12
thrown 12
out 12
upon 12
the 12
world 12
forty 12
years 12
ago 12
when 12
the 12
last 12
liberal 12
arts 12
college 12
shut 12
for 12
lack 12
of 12
students 12
and 12
patronage 12
his 12
name 12
was 12
faber 12
and 12
when 12
he 12
finally 12
lost 12
his 12
fear 12
of 12
montag 12
he 12
talked 12
in 12
a 12
cadenced 12
voice 12
looking 12
at 12
the 12
sky 12
and 12
the 12
trees 12
and 12
the 12
green 12
park 12
and 12
when 12
an 12
hour 12
had 12
passed 12
he 12
said 12
something 12
to 12
montag 12
and 12
montag 12
sensed 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
rhymeless 12
poem 12
then 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
grew 12
even 12
more 12
courageous 12
and 12
said 12
something 12
else 12
and 12
that 12
was 12
a 12
poem 12
too 12
faber 12
held 12
his 12
hand 12
over 12
his 12
left 12
coatpocket 12
and 12
spoke 12
these 12
words 12
gently 12
and 12
montag 12
knew 12
if 12
he 12
reached 12
out 12
he 12
might 12
pull 12
a 12
book 12
of 12
poetry 12
from 12
the 12
mans 12
coat 12
but 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
reach 12
out 12
his 12
hands 12
stayed 12
on 12
his 12
knees 12
numbed 12
and 12
useless 12
i 12
dont 12
talk 12
things 12
sir 12
said 12
faber 12
i 12
talk 12
the 12
meaning 12
of 12
things 12
i 12
sit 12
here 12
and 12

im 12
alive 12
that 12
was 12
all 12
there 12
was 12
to 12
it 12
really 12
an 12
hour 12
of 12
monologue 12
a 12
poem 12
a 12
comment 12
and 12
then 12
without 12
even 12
acknowledging 12
the 12
fact 12
that 12
montag 12
was 12
a 12
fireman 12
faber 12
with 12
a 12
certain 12
trembling 12
wrote 12
his 12
address 12
on 12
a 12
slip 12
of 12
paper 12
for 12
your 12
file 12
he 12
said 12
in 12
case 12
you 12
decide 12
to 12
be 12
angry 12
with 12
me 12
im 12
not 12
angry 12
montag 12
said 12
surprised 12
mildred 12
shrieked 12
with 12
laughter 12
in 12
the 12
hall 12
montag 12
went 12
to 12
his 12
bedroom 12
closet 12
and 12
flipped 12
through 12
his 12
filewallet 12
to 12
the 12
heading 12
future 12
investigations 12

it 12
in 12
and 12
he 12
hadnt 12
erased 12
it 12

dialled 12
the 12

on 12
a 12
secondary 12
phone 12

phone 12
on 12

name 12
a 12
dozen 12
times 12
before 12
the 12
professor 12
answered 12
in 12
a 12
faint 12
voice 12
montag 12

secondhand 12

timeworn 12
philosophies 12
there 12

beatty 12
perspiring 12
gently 12
the 12
floor 12
littered 12
with 12
swarms 12
of 12
black 12
moths 12
that 12
had 12
died 12
in 12
a 12

mildred 12
montag 12

at 12
the 12
door 12
with 12
his 12
back 12
turned 12
millie 12
a 12

millie 12
he 12
felt 12
her 12
blinking 12
slowly 12
at 12
the 12
back 12
of 12
his 12
neck 12
whyd 12
you 12
ask 12
a 12
silly 12
question 12
like 12
that 12
he 12
felt 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
cry 12
but 12
nothing 12
would 12
happen 12
to 12
his 12
eyes 12
or 12
his 12
mouth 12
if 12
you 12
see 12
that 12
dog 12
outside 12
said 12
mildred 12
give 12
him 12
a 12
kick 12
for 12
me 12
he 12
hesitated 12
listening 12
at 12
the 12
door 12
he 12
opened 12
it 12
and 12
stepped 12
out 12
the 12
rain 12
had 12
stopped 12
and 12
the 12
sun 12
was 12
setting 12
in 12
the 12
clear 12
sky 12
the 12
street 12
and 12
the 12
lawn 12
and 12
the 12
porch 12
were 12
empty 12
he 12
let 12
his 12
breath 12
go 12
in 12
a 12
great 12
sigh 12
he 12
slammed 12
the 12
door 12
he 12
was 12
on 12
the 12
subway 12
im 12
numb 12

thought 12
when 12
did 12
the 12
numbness 12
really 12
begin 12
in 12
my 12
face 12
in 12
my 12

in 12
the 12
dark 12
like 12
kicking 12
a 12
buried 12
mine 12
the 12
numbness 12
will 12
go 12

thought 12
itll 12
take 12
time 12
but 12

it 12
or 12

and 12
the 12
old 12

the 12

the 12
total 12
adding 12
itself 12
once 12
as 12
a 12

he 12
had 12
sat 12
upon 12
a 12
yellow 12
dune 12
by 12
the 12

because 12
some 12
cruel 12
cousin 12
had 12
said 12
fill 12
this 12
sieve 12
and 12
youll 12
get 12
a 12
dime 12
and 12
the 12
faster 12
he 12
poured 12
the 12
faster 12
it 12
sifted 12
through 12
with 12
a 12
hot 12
whispering 12
his 12
hands 12
were 12
tired 12
the 12
sand 12
was 12
boiling 12
the 12
sieve 12
was 12
empty 12
seated 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
midst 12
of 12
july 12
without 12
a 12
sound 12
he 12
felt 12
the 12
tears 12
move 12
down 12
his 12
cheeks 12
now 12
as 12
the 12
vacuumunderground 12
rushed 12
him 12
through 12
the 12
dead 12
cellars 12
of 12
town 12
jolting 12
him 12
he 12
remembered 12
the 12
terrible 12
logic 12
of 12
that 12
sieve 12
and 12
he 12
looked 12
down 12
and 12
saw 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
carrying 12
the 12
bible 12
open 12
there 12
were 12
people 12
in 12
the 12
suction 12
train 12
but 12
he 12
held 12
the 12
book 12
in 12
his 12
hands 12
and 12
the 12
silly 12
thought 12
came 12
to 12
him 12
if 12
you 12
read 12
fast 12
and 12
read 12
all 12
maybe 12
some 12
of 12
the 12
sand 12
will 12
stay 12
in 12
the 12
sieve 12
but 12
he 12
read 12
and 12
the 12
words 12
fell 12
through 12
and 12
he 12
thought 12
in 12
a 12
few 12
hours 12
there 12
will 12
be 12
beatty 12
and 12
here 12
will 12
be 12
me 12
handing 12
this 12
over 12
so 12
no 12
phrase 12
must 12
escape 12
me 12
each 12
line 12
must 12
be 12
memorized 12
i 12
will 12
myself 12
to 12
do 12
it 12
he 12
clenched 12
the 12
book 12
in 12
his 12
fists 12

flicked 12
the 12
pages 12
and 12
felt 12
them 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
were 12
blind 12
he 12
picked 12
at 12

the 12
front 12
door 12
opened 12
slowly 12
faber 12
peered 12
out 12
looking 12
very 12
old 12
in 12
the 12
light 12
and 12
very 12
fragile 12
and 12
very 12
much 12
afraid 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
looked 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
had 12
not 12
been 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
house 12
in 12
years 12
he 12
and 12
the 12
white 12
plaster 12
walls 12
inside 12
were 12
much 12
the 12
same 12
there 12
was 12
white 12
in 12
the 12
flesh 12
of 12
his 12
mouth 12
and 12
his 12
cheeks 12
and 12
his 12
hair 12
was 12
white 12
and 12
his 12
eyes 12
had 12
faded 12
with 12
white 12
in 12
the 12
vague 12
blueness 12
there 12
then 12
his 12
eyes 12
touched 12
on 12
the 12
book 12
under 12
montags 12
arm 12
and 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
look 12
so 12
old 12
any 12
more 12
and 12
not 12
quite 12
as 12
fragile 12
slowly 12
his 12
fear 12
went 12
im 12
sorry 12
one 12
has 12
to 12
be 12
careful 12
he 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
book 12
under 12
montags 12
arm 12
and 12
could 12
not 12
stop 12
so 12
its 12
true 12
montag 12
stepped 12
inside 12
the 12
door 12
shut 12
sit 12
down 12
faber 12
backed 12
up 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
feared 12
the 12
book 12
might 12
vanish 12
if 12
he 12
took 12
his 12
eyes 12
from 12
it 12
behind 12
him 12
the 12
door 12
to 12
a 12
bedroom 12
stood 12
open 12
and 12
in 12
that 12
room 12
a 12
litter 12
of 12
machinery 12
and 12
steel 12
tools 12
was 12
strewn 12
upon 12
a 12
desktop 12
montag 12
had 12
only 12
a 12
glimpse 12
before 12
faber 12
seeing 12
montags 12
attention 12
diverted 12
turned 12
quickly 12
and 12
shut 12
the 12
bedroom 12
door 12
and 12
stood 12
holding 12
the 12
knob 12
with 12
a 12
trembling 12
hand 12
his 12
gaze 12
returned 12
unsteadily 12
to 12
montag 12
who 12
was 12
now 12
seated 12
with 12
the 12
book 12
in 12
his 12
lap 12
the 12
book 12
where 12
did 12
you 12
i 12
stole 12
it 12
faber 12
for 12
the 12
first 12
time 12
raised 12
his 12
eyes 12
and 12
looked 12

not 12
a 12
religious 12
man 12
but 12
its 12
been 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
faber 12
turned 12
the 12
pages 12
stopping 12
here 12
and 12
there 12
to 12
read 12
its 12
as 12
good 12
as 12
i 12
remember 12
lord 12
how 12
theyve 12

of 12
the 12

veiled 12
references 12
to 12
certain 12
commercial 12
products 12
that 12
every 12
worshipper 12
absolutely 12
needs 12
faber 12
sniffed 12
the 12
book 12
do 12
you 12
know 12
that 12
books 12
smell 12
like 12
nutmeg 12
or 12
some 12
spice 12
from 12
a 12
foreign 12
land 12
i 12
loved 12
to 12
smell 12
them 12
when 12
i 12
was 12
a 12
boy 12
lord 12
there 12
were 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
lovely 12
books 12
once 12
before 12
we 12
let 12
them 12
go 12
faber 12
turned 12
the 12
pages 12
mr 12
montag 12
you 12
are 12
looking 12
at 12
a 12
coward 12
i 12
saw 12
the 12
way 12
things 12
were 12
going 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
back 12
i 12
said 12
nothing 12
im 12
one 12
of 12
the 12
innocents 12
who 12
could 12
have 12
spoken 12
up 12
and 12
out 12
when 12
no 12
one 12
would 12
listen 12
to 12
the 12
guilty 12
but 12
i 12
did 12
not 12
speak 12
and 12
thus 12
became 12
guilty 12
myself 12
and 12
when 12
finally 12
they 12
set 12
the 12
structure 12
to 12
burn 12
the 12
books 12
using 12
the 12
firemen 12
i 12
grunted 12
a 12
few 12
times 12
and 12
subsided 12
for 12
there 12
were 12
no 12
others 12
grunting 12
or 12
yelling 12
with 12
me 12
by 12

now 12
its 12
too 12
late 12

to 12
teach 12
me 12
to 12
understand 12
what 12
i 12
read 12
faber 12
examined 12
montags 12
thin 12
bluejowled 12
face 12
how 12
did 12
you 12
get 12
shaken 12
up 12
what 12
knocked 12
the 12
torch 12
out 12
of 12
your 12
hands 12
i 12
dont 12
know 12
we 12
have 12
everything 12
we 12
need 12
to 12
be 12
happy 12
but 12
we 12
arent 12
happy 12
somethings 12
missing 12
i 12
looked 12
around 12
the 12
only 12
thing 12
i 12
positively 12
knew 12
was 12
gone 12
was 12
the 12
books 12
id 12
burned 12
in 12
ten 12
or 12
twelve 12
years 12
so 12
i 12
thought 12
books 12
might 12
help 12
youre 12
a 12
hopeless 12
romantic 12
said 12
faber 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
funny 12
if 12
it 12
were 12
not 12
serious 12
its 12
not 12
books 12
you 12
need 12
its 12
some 12
of 12
the 12
things 12
that 12
once 12
were 12
in 12
books 12
the 12
same 12
things 12
could 12
be 12
in 12
the 12
parlour 12
families 12
today 12
the 12
same 12
infinite 12
detail 12
and 12
awareness 12
could 12
be 12
projected 12
through 12
the 12
radios 12
and 12
televisors 12
but 12
are 12
not 12
no 12
no 12
its 12
not 12
books 12
at 12
all 12
youre 12
looking 12
for 12
take 12
it 12
where 12
you 12
can 12
find 12
it 12
in 12
old 12
phonograph 12
records 12
old 12
motion 12
pictures 12
and 12
in 12
old 12
friends 12
look 12
for 12
it 12
in 12
nature 12
and 12
look 12
for 12
it 12
in 12
yourself 12
books 12
were 12
only 12
one 12
type 12
of 12
receptacle 12
where 12
we 12
stored 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
things 12
we 12
were 12
afraid 12
we 12
might 12
forget 12
there 12
is 12
nothing 12
magical 12
in 12
them 12
at 12
all 12
the 12
magic 12
is 12
only 12
in 12
what 12
books 12
say 12
how 12
they 12
stitched 12
the 12
patches 12
of 12
the 12
universe 12
together 12
into 12
one 12
garment 12
for 12
us 12
of 12
course 12
you 12
couldnt 12
know 12
this 12
of 12
course 12
you 12
still 12
cant 12
understand 12
what 12
i 12
mean 12
when 12
i 12
say 12
all 12
this 12
you 12
are 12
intuitively 12
right 12
thats 12
what 12
counts 12
three 12
things 12
are 12
missing 12
number 12
one 12
do 12
you 12
know 12
why 12
books 12
such 12
as 12
this 12
are 12
so 12
important 12
because 12
they 12
have 12
quality 12
and 12
what 12
does 12
the 12
word 12
quality 12
mean 12
to 12
me 12
it 12
means 12
texture 12
this 12
book 12
has 12
pores 12
it 12
has 12
features 12
this 12
book 12
can 12
go 12
under 12
the 12
microscope 12
youd 12
find 12
life 12
under 12
the 12
glass 12
streaming 12
past 12
in 12
infinite 12
profusion 12
the 12
more 12
pores 12
the 12
more 12
truthfully 12
recorded 12
details 12
of 12
life 12
per 12
square 12
inch 12
you 12
can 12
get 12
on 12
a 12
sheet 12
of 12
paper 12
the 12
more 12
literary 12
you 12
are 12
thats 12
my 12
definition 12
anyway 12
telling 12
detail 12
fresh 12
detail 12
the 12
good 12
writers 12
touch 12
life 12
often 12
the 12
mediocre 12
ones 12
run 12
a 12
quick 12
hand 12
over 12
her 12
the 12
bad 12
ones 12
rape 12
her 12
and 12
leave 12
her 12
for 12
the 12
flies 12
so 12
now 12
do 12
you 12
see 12
why 12
books 12
are 12
hated 12
and 12
feared 12
they 12
show 12
the 12
pores 12
in 12
the 12
face 12
of 12
life 12
the 12
comfortable 12
people 12
want 12
only 12
wax 12
moon 12
faces 12
poreless 12
hairless 12
expressionless 12
we 12
are 12
living 12
in 12
a 12
time 12
when 12
flowers 12
are 12
trying 12
to 12
live 12
on 12
flowers 12
instead 12
of 12
growing 12
on 12
good 12
rain 12
and 12
black 12
loam 12
even 12
fireworks 12
for 12
all 12
their 12
prettiness 12
come 12
from 12
the 12
chemistry 12
of 12
the 12
earth 12
yet 12
somehow 12
we 12
think 12
we 12
can 12
grow 12
feeding 12
on 12
flowers 12
and 12
fireworks 12
without 12
completing 12
the 12
cycle 12
back 12
to 12
reality 12
do 12
you 12
know 12
the 12
legend 12
of 12
hercules 12
and 12
antaeus 12
the 12
giant 12
wrestler 12
whose 12
strength 12
was 12
incredible 12
so 12
long 12
as 12
he 12
stood 12
firmly 12
on 12
the 12
earth 12
but 12
when 12
he 12
was 12
held 12
rootless 12
in 12
midair 12
by 12
hercules 12
he 12
perished 12
easily 12
if 12
there 12
isnt 12
something 12
in 12
that 12
legend 12
for 12
us 12
today 12
in 12
this 12
city 12
in 12
our 12
time 12
then 12
i 12
am 12
completely 12
insane 12
well 12
there 12
we 12
have 12
the 12
first 12
thing 12
i 12
said 12
we 12
needed 12
quality 12
texture 12
of 12
information 12
and 12
the 12
second 12
leisure 12
oh 12
but 12
weve 12
plenty 12
of 12
offhours 12
offhours 12
yes 12
but 12
time 12
to 12
think 12
if 12
youre 12
not 12
driving 12
a 12
hundred 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
at 12
a 12
clip 12
where 12
you 12
cant 12
think 12
of 12
anything 12
else 12
but 12
the 12
danger 12
then 12
youre 12
playing 12
some 12
game 12
or 12
sitting 12
in 12
some 12
room 12
where 12
you 12
cant 12
argue 12
with 12
the 12
fourwall 12
televisor 12
why 12
the 12
televisor 12
is 12
real 12
it 12
is 12
immediate 12
it 12
has 12
dimension 12
it 12
tells 12
you 12
what 12
to 12
think 12
and 12
blasts 12
it 12
in 12
it 12
must 12
be 12
right 12
it 12
seems 12
so 12
right 12
it 12
rushes 12
you 12
on 12
so 12
quickly 12
to 12
its 12
own 12
conclusions 12
your 12
mind 12
hasnt 12
time 12
to 12
protest 12
what 12
nonsense 12
only 12
the 12
family 12
is 12
people 12
i 12
beg 12
your 12
pardon 12
my 12
wife 12
says 12
books 12
arent 12
real 12
thank 12
god 12
for 12
that 12
you 12
can 12
shut 12
them 12
say 12
hold 12
on 12
a 12
moment 12
you 12
play 12
god 12
to 12
it 12
but 12
who 12
has 12
ever 12
torn 12
himself 12
from 12
the 12
claw 12
that 12
encloses 12
you 12
when 12
you 12
drop 12
a 12
seed 12
in 12
a 12
tv 12
parlour 12
it 12
grows 12
you 12
any 12
shape 12
it 12
wishes 12
it 12
is 12
an 12
environment 12
as 12
real 12
as 12
the 12
world 12
it 12
becomes 12
and 12
is 12
the 12
truth 12
books 12
can 12
be 12
beaten 12
down 12
with 12
reason 12
but 12
with 12
all 12
my 12
knowledge 12
and 12
scepticism 12
i 12
have 12
never 12
been 12
able 12
to 12
argue 12
with 12
a 12
onehundredpiece 12
symphony 12
orchestra 12
full 12
colour 12
three 12
dimensions 12
and 12
i 12
being 12
in 12
and 12
part 12
of 12
those 12
incredible 12
parlours 12
as 12
you 12
see 12
my 12
parlour 12
is 12
nothing 12
but 12
four 12
plaster 12
walls 12
and 12
here 12
he 12
held 12
out 12
two 12
small 12
rubber 12
plugs 12
for 12
my 12
ears 12
when 12
i 12
ride 12
the 12
subwayjets 12
denhams 12
dentifrice 12
they 12
toil 12
not 12
neither 12
do 12
they 12
spin 12
said 12
montag 12
eyes 12
shut 12
where 12
do 12
we 12
go 12
from 12
here 12
would 12
books 12
help 12
us 12
only 12
if 12
the 12
third 12
necessary 12
thing 12
could 12
be 12
given 12
us 12
number 12
one 12
as 12
i 12
said 12
quality 12
of 12
information 12
number 12
two 12
leisure 12
to 12
digest 12
it 12
and 12
number 12
three 12
the 12
right 12
to 12
carry 12
out 12
actions 12
based 12
on 12
what 12
we 12
learn 12
from 12
the 12
interaction 12
of 12
the 12
first 12
two 12
and 12
i 12
hardly 12
think 12
a 12
very 12
old 12
man 12
and 12
a 12
fireman 12
turned 12
sour 12
could 12
do 12
much 12
this 12
late 12
in 12
the 12
game 12
i 12
can 12
get 12
books 12
youre 12
running 12
a 12
risk 12
thats 12
the 12
good 12
part 12
of 12
dying 12
when 12
youve 12
nothing 12
to 12
lose 12
you 12
run 12
any 12
risk 12
you 12
want 12
there 12
youve 12
said 12
an 12
interesting 12
thing 12
laughed 12
faber 12
without 12
having 12
read 12
it 12
are 12
things 12
like 12
that 12
in 12
books 12
but 12
it 12
came 12
off 12
the 12
top 12
of 12
my 12
mind 12
all 12
the 12
better 12
you 12
didnt 12
fancy 12
it 12
up 12
for 12
me 12
or 12
anyone 12
even 12
yourself 12
montag 12
leaned 12
forward 12
this 12
afternoon 12
i 12
thought 12
that 12
if 12
it 12
turned 12
out 12
that 12
books 12
were 12
worth 12
while 12
we 12
might 12
get 12
a 12
press 12
and 12
print 12
some 12
extra 12
copies 12
we 12
you 12
and 12
i 12
oh 12
no 12
faber 12
sat 12
up 12
but 12
let 12
me 12
tell 12
you 12
my 12
plan 12
if 12
you 12
insist 12
on 12
telling 12
me 12
i 12
must 12
ask 12
you 12
to 12
leave 12
but 12
arent 12
you 12
interested 12
not 12
if 12
you 12
start 12
talking 12
the 12
sort 12
of 12
talk 12
that 12
might 12
get 12
me 12
burnt 12
for 12
my 12
trouble 12
the 12
only 12
way 12
i 12
could 12
possibly 12
listen 12
to 12
you 12
would 12
be 12
if 12
somehow 12
the 12
fireman 12
structure 12
itself 12
could 12
be 12
burnt 12
now 12
if 12
you 12
suggest 12
that 12
we 12
print 12
extra 12
books 12
and 12
arrange 12
to 12
have 12
them 12
hidden 12
in 12
firemens 12
houses 12
all 12
over 12
the 12
country 12
so 12
that 12
seeds 12
of 12
suspicion 12
would 12
be 12
sown 12
among 12
these 12
arsonists 12
bravo 12
id 12
say 12
plant 12
the 12
books 12
turn 12
in 12
an 12
alarm 12
and 12
see 12
the 12
firemens 12
houses 12
burn 12
is 12
that 12
what 12
you 12
mean 12
faber 12
raised 12
his 12
brows 12
and 12
looked 12
at 12
montag 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
were 12
seeing 12
a 12
new 12
man 12
i 12
was 12
joking 12
if 12
you 12
thought 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
a 12
plan 12
worth 12
trying 12
id 12
have 12
to 12
take 12
your 12
word 12
it 12
would 12
help 12
you 12
cant 12
guarantee 12
things 12
like 12
that 12
after 12
all 12
when 12
we 12
had 12
all 12
the 12
books 12
we 12
needed 12
we 12
still 12
insisted 12
on 12
finding 12
the 12
highest 12
cliff 12
to 12
jump 12
off 12
but 12
we 12
do 12
need 12
a 12
breather 12
we 12
do 12
need 12
knowledge 12
and 12
perhaps 12
in 12
a 12
thousand 12
years 12
we 12
might 12
pick 12
smaller 12

up 12
and 12
began 12
to 12
pace 12
the 12
room 12
well 12
asked 12
montag 12
youre 12
absolutely 12
serious 12
absolutely 12
its 12
an 12
insidious 12
plan 12
if 12
i 12
do 12
say 12
so 12
myself 12
faber 12
glanced 12
nervously 12
at 12
his 12
bedroom 12
door 12
to 12
see 12
the 12
firehouses 12
burn 12
across 12
the 12
land 12
destroyed 12
as 12
hotbeds 12
of 12
treason 12
the 12
salamander 12
devours 12
his 12
tail 12
ho 12
god 12
ive 12
a 12
list 12
of 12
firemens 12
residences 12
everywhere 12
with 12
some 12
sort 12
of 12
underground 12
cant 12
trust 12
people 12
thats 12
the 12
dirty 12
part 12
you 12
and 12
i 12
and 12
who 12
else 12
will 12
set 12
the 12
fires 12
arent 12
there 12
professors 12
like 12
yourself 12
former 12
writers 12
historians 12
linguists 12
dead 12
or 12
ancient 12
the 12
older 12
the 12
better 12
theyll 12
go 12
unnoticed 12
you 12
know 12
dozens 12
admit 12
it 12
oh 12
there 12
are 12
many 12
actors 12
alone 12
who 12
havent 12
acted 12
pirandello 12
or 12
shaw 12
or 12
shakespeare 12
for 12
years 12
because 12
their 12
plays 12
are 12
too 12
aware 12
of 12
the 12
world 12
we 12
could 12
use 12
their 12
anger 12
and 12
we 12
could 12
use 12
the 12
honest 12
rage 12
of 12
those 12
historians 12
who 12
havent 12
written 12
a 12
line 12
for 12
forty 12
years 12
true 12
we 12
might 12
form 12
classes 12
in 12
thinking 12
and 12
reading 12
yes 12
but 12
that 12
would 12
just 12
nibble 12
the 12
edges 12
the 12
whole 12
cultures 12
shot 12
through 12
the 12
skeleton 12
needs 12
melting 12
and 12
reshaping 12
good 12
god 12
it 12
isnt 12
as 12
simple 12
as 12
just 12
picking 12
up 12
a 12
book 12
you 12
laid 12
down 12
half 12
a 12
century 12
ago 12
remember 12
the 12
firemen 12
are 12
rarely 12
necessary 12
the 12
public 12
itself 12
stopped 12
reading 12
of 12
its 12
own 12
accord 12
you 12
firemen 12
provide 12
a 12
circus 12
now 12
and 12
then 12
at 12
which 12
buildings 12
are 12
set 12
off 12
and 12
crowds 12
gather 12
for 12
the 12
pretty 12
blaze 12
but 12
its 12
a 12
small 12
sideshow 12
indeed 12
and 12
hardly 12
necessary 12
to 12
keep 12
things 12
in 12
line 12
so 12
few 12
want 12
to 12
be 12
rebels 12
any 12
more 12
and 12
out 12
of 12
those 12
few 12
most 12
like 12
myself 12
scare 12
easily 12
can 12
you 12
dance 12
faster 12
than 12
the 12
white 12
clown 12
shout 12
louder 12
than 12
mr 12
gimmick 12
and 12
the 12
parlour 12
families 12
if 12
you 12
can 12
youll 12
win 12
your 12
way 12
montag 12
in 12
any 12
event 12
youre 12
a 12
fool 12
people 12

having 12
fun 12
committing 12
suicide 12
murdering 12
a 12
bomber 12
flight 12
had 12
been 12
moving 12
east 12
all 12
the 12
time 12
they 12
talked 12
and 12
only 12
now 12
did 12
the 12
two 12
men 12
stop 12
and 12
listen 12
feeling 12
the 12
great 12
jet 12
sound 12
tremble 12
inside 12
themselves 12
patience 12
montag 12
let 12
the 12
war 12
turn 12
off 12
the 12
families 12
our 12
civilization 12

flinging 12
itself 12
to 12
pieces 12

back 12
from 12
the 12
centrifuge 12
there 12

someone 12
ready 12
when 12

the 12
survivors 12

man 12

his 12
good 12
side 12
too 12

thing 12
to 12
happen 12
his 12
hands 12
by 12

let 12
his 12
hands 12

six 12
more 12
pages 12

to 12
the 12
floor 12

paper 12
and 12
flatten 12
it 12
out 12
as 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
watched 12
tiredly 12
faber 12
shook 12
his 12
head 12

four 12
five 12
hundred 12
dollars 12
why 12
bring 12
it 12
i 12
know 12
a 12
man 12
who 12
printed 12
our 12
college 12
paper 12
half 12
a 12
century 12
ago 12
that 12
was 12
the 12
year 12
i 12
came 12
to 12
class 12
at 12
the 12
start 12
of 12
the 12
new 12
semester 12
and 12
found 12
only 12
one 12
student 12
to 12
sign 12
up 12
for 12
drama 12
from 12
aeschylus 12
to 12
oneill 12
you 12
see 12
how 12
like 12
a 12
beautiful 12
statue 12
of 12
ice 12
it 12
was 12
melting 12
in 12
the 12
sun 12
i 12
remember 12
the 12
newspapers 12
dying 12
like 12
huge 12
moths 12
no 12
one 12
wanted 12
them 12
back 12
no 12
one 12
missed 12
them 12
and 12
the 12
government 12
seeing 12
how 12
advantageous 12
it 12
was 12
to 12
have 12
people 12
reading 12
only 12
about 12
passionate 12
lips 12
and 12
the 12
fist 12
in 12
the 12
stomach 12
circled 12
the 12
situation 12
with 12
your 12
fireeaters 12
so 12
montag 12
theres 12
this 12
unemployed 12
printer 12
we 12
might 12
start 12
a 12
few 12
books 12
and 12
wait 12
on 12
the 12
war 12
to 12
break 12
the 12
pattern 12
and 12
give 12
us 12
the 12
push 12
we 12
need 12
a 12
few 12
bombs 12
and 12
the 12
families 12
in 12
the 12
walls 12
of 12
all 12
the 12
houses 12
like 12
harlequin 12
rats 12
will 12
shut 12
up 12
in 12
silence 12
our 12
stagewhisper 12
might 12
carry 12
they 12

the 12
table 12

man 12

who 12

as 12
old 12
as 12

juvenile 12
delinquents 12
so 12
thats 12
what 12
i 12

of 12

me 12
again 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
said 12
nothing 12
but 12
glanced 12
once 12
more 12
nervously 12
at 12
his 12
bedroom 12
montag 12
caught 12
the 12
glance 12
well 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
took 12
a 12
deep 12
breath 12
held 12
it 12
and 12
let 12
it 12
out 12
he 12
took 12
another 12
eyes 12
closed 12
his 12
mouth 12
tight 12
and 12
at 12
last 12
exhaled 12
montag 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
turned 12
at 12
last 12
and 12
said 12

actually 12

my 12
house 12

montag 12
into 12
a 12
small 12
chamber 12
where 12

a 12
table 12
upon 12
which 12
a 12
number 12
of 12
metal 12
tools 12

with 12
my 12
imagination 12
fiddling 12

been 12
my 12
hobby 12
my 12
cowardice 12
is 12
of 12
such 12
a 12
passion 12
complementing 12
the 12
revolutionary 12
spirit 12
that 12
lives 12
in 12
its 12
shadow 12
i 12
was 12
forced 12
to 12
design 12

he 12
picked 12
up 12
a 12
small 12
greenmetal 12
object 12
no 12
larger 12
than 12
a 12
bullet 12

that 12
night 12
the 12

the 12
clouds 12

the 12
stars 12
looked 12
a 12
million 12
of 12
them 12
swimming 12
between 12
the 12
clouds 12
like 12
the 12
enemy 12
discs 12
and 12
the 12
feeling 12
that 12
the 12
sky 12
might 12
fall 12
upon 12
the 12
city 12
and 12

it 12
to 12
chalk 12
dust 12
and 12
the 12
moon 12
go 12
up 12

the 12

in 12
the 12
sky 12
as 12
montag 12
walked 12
his 12
lips 12
moving 12
just 12
a 12
trifle 12
he 12
was 12
eating 12
a 12
light 12
supper 12
at 12
nine 12
in 12
the 12
evening 12
when 12
the 12
front 12
door 12
cried 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
hall 12
and 12
mildred 12
ran 12
from 12
the 12
parlour 12
like 12
a 12
native 12
fleeing 12
an 12
eruption 12
of 12
vesuvius 12
mrs 12

through 12
the 12
front 12
door 12
and 12
vanished 12
into 12
the 12
volcanos 12
mouth 12
with 12
martinis 12
in 12
their 12
hands 12
montag 12
stopped 12
eating 12
they 12
were 12
like 12
a 12
monstrous 12
crystal 12
chandelier 12
tinkling 12
in 12
a 12
thousand 12
chimes 12
he 12
saw 12
their 12
cheshire 12
cat 12
smiles 12
burning 12
through 12
the 12
walls 12
of 12
the 12
house 12
and 12
now 12
they 12
were 12
screaming 12
at 12

above 12
the 12
din 12
montag 12

himself 12
at 12
the 12
parlour 12
door 12
with 12
his 12

on 12
one 12
wall 12
a 12
woman 12
smiled 12
and 12
drank 12
orange 12
juice 12
simultaneously 12
how 12
does 12
she 12
do 12
both 12
at 12
once 12
thought 12
montag 12
insanely 12
in 12
the 12
other 12
walls 12
an 12
xray 12
of 12
the 12
same 12
woman 12
revealed 12
the 12
contracting 12
journey 12
of 12
the 12
refreshing 12
beverage 12
on 12
its 12
way 12
to 12
her 12
delightful 12
stomach 12
abruptly 12
the 12
room 12
took 12
off 12
on 12
a 12
rocket 12
flight 12
into 12
the 12
clouds 12
it 12
plunged 12
into 12
a 12
limegreen 12
sea 12
where 12
blue 12
fish 12
ate 12
red 12
and 12
yellow 12
fish 12
a 12
minute 12
later 12
three 12
white 12
cartoon 12
clowns 12
chopped 12
off 12
each 12
others 12
limbs 12
to 12
the 12
accompaniment 12
of 12
immense 12
incoming 12
tides 12
of 12
laughter 12
two 12
minutes 12
more 12
and 12
the 12
room 12
whipped 12
out 12
of 12
town 12
to 12
the 12
jet 12
cars 12
wildly 12
circling 12
an 12
arena 12
bashing 12
and 12
backing 12
up 12
and 12
bashing 12
each 12

again 12

fiveminute 12
romance 12
last 12
night 12
in 12
your 12
wall 12
well 12
it 12
was 12
all 12
about 12
this 12
woman 12
who 12
montag 12
said 12
nothing 12
but 12
stood 12
looking 12
at 12
the 12
womens 12
faces 12
as 12
he 12
had 12
once 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
faces 12
of 12
saints 12
in 12
a 12
strange 12
church 12
he 12
had 12
entered 12
when 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
child 12
the 12
faces 12
of 12
those 12
enamelled 12
creatures 12
meant 12
nothing 12
to 12
him 12
though 12
he 12
talked 12
to 12
them 12
and 12
stood 12
in 12
that 12
church 12
for 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
trying 12
to 12
be 12
of 12
that 12
religion 12
trying 12
to 12
know 12
what 12
that 12
religion 12
was 12
trying 12
to 12
get 12
enough 12
of 12
the 12
raw 12
incense 12
and 12
special 12
dust 12
of 12
the 12
place 12
into 12
his 12
lungs 12
and 12
thus 12
into 12
his 12
blood 12
to 12
feel 12
touched 12
and 12
concerned 12
by 12
the 12
meaning 12
of 12
the 12
colourful 12
men 12
and 12
women 12
with 12
the 12
porcelain 12
eyes 12
and 12
the 12
bloodruby 12
lips 12
but 12
there 12
was 12
nothing 12
nothing 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
stroll 12
through 12
another 12
store 12
and 12
his 12
currency 12
strange 12
and 12
unusable 12
there 12
and 12
his 12
passion 12
cold 12
even 12
when 12
he 12
touched 12
the 12
wood 12
and 12
plaster 12
and 12
clay 12
so 12
it 12
was 12
now 12
in 12
his 12
own 12
parlour 12
with 12
these 12
women 12
twisting 12
in 12
their 12
chairs 12
under 12
his 12
gaze 12
lighting 12
cigarettes 12
blowing 12
smoke 12
touching 12
their 12
sunfired 12
hair 12
and 12
examining 12
their 12
blazing 12
fingernails 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
had 12
caught 12
fire 12
from 12
his 12
look 12
their 12
faces 12
grew 12
haunted 12
with 12
silence 12
they 12
leaned 12
forward 12
at 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
montags 12
swallowing 12
his 12
final 12
bite 12
of 12
food 12
they 12
listened 12
to 12
his 12
feverish 12
breathing 12
the 12
three 12
empty 12
walls 12
of 12
the 12
room 12
were 12
like 12
the 12
pale 12
brows 12
of 12
sleeping 12
giants 12
now 12
empty 12
of 12
dreams 12
montag 12
felt 12
that 12
if 12
you 12
touched 12
these 12
three 12
staring 12
brows 12
you 12
would 12
feel 12
a 12
fine 12
salt 12
sweat 12
on 12
your 12
fingertips 12
the 12
perspiration 12
gathered 12
with 12
the 12
silence 12
and 12
the 12
subaudible 12
trembling 12
around 12
and 12
about 12
and 12
in 12
the 12
women 12
who 12
were 12
burning 12
with 12
tension 12
any 12
moment 12
they 12
might 12
hiss 12
a 12
long 12
sputtering 12
hiss 12
and 12
explode 12
montag 12
moved 12

lips 12

in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
an 12
empty 12
desert 12
with 12
three 12
chairs 12
and 12
him 12
standing 12

from 12

hair 12
then 12
he 12
began 12
to 12
read 12
in 12
a 12
low 12
stumbling 12
voice 12
that 12
grew 12
firmer 12
as 12
he 12
progressed 12
from 12
line 12
to 12
line 12
and 12
his 12
voice 12
went 12
out 12
across 12
the 12
desert 12
into 12
the 12
whiteness 12
and 12
around 12
the 12
three 12
sitting 12
women 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
great 12
hot 12
emptiness 12
the 12
sea 12
of 12
faith 12
was 12
once 12
too 12
at 12
the 12
full 12
and 12
round 12
earths 12
shore 12
lay 12
like 12
the 12
folds 12
of 12
a 12
bright 12
girdle 12
furled 12
but 12
now 12
i 12
only 12
hear 12
its 12
melancholy 12
long 12
withdrawing 12
roar 12
retreating 12
to 12
the 12
breath 12
of 12
the 12
nightwind 12
down 12
the 12
vast 12
edges 12
drear 12
and 12
naked 12
shingles 12
of 12
the 12
world 12
the 12
chairs 12
creaked 12
under 12
the 12
three 12
women 12

for 12
the 12
world 12
which 12
seems 12
to 12
lie 12
before 12
us 12
like 12
a 12
land 12
of 12
dreams 12

a 12
darkling 12
plain 12
swept 12
with 12
confused 12
alarms 12
of 12
struggle 12
and 12
flight 12
where 12

and 12
kick 12
you 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
door 12
doors 12
slammed 12
and 12
the 12
house 12
was 12
empty 12
montag 12
stood 12
alone 12
in 12
the 12
winter 12
weather 12
with 12
the 12
parlour 12
walls 12
the 12
colour 12
of 12
dirty 12
snow 12
in 12
the 12
bathroom 12
water 12
ran 12
he 12
heard 12
mildred 12
shake 12
the 12
sleeping 12
tablets 12
into 12
her 12
hand 12
fool 12
montag 12
fool 12
fool 12
oh 12
god 12
you 12
silly 12
fool 12
shut 12
up 12
he 12
pulled 12
the 12
green 12
bullet 12
from 12
his 12
ear 12
and 12
jammed 12
it 12
into 12
his 12
pocket 12
it 12
sizzled 12
faintly 12
fool 12
fool 12
he 12
searched 12
the 12
house 12
and 12
found 12
the 12
books 12
where 12
mildred 12
had 12
stacked 12
them 12
behind 12
the 12
refrigerator 12
some 12
were 12
missing 12
and 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
she 12
had 12
started 12
on 12
her 12
own 12
slow 12
process 12
of 12
dispersing 12
the 12
dynamite 12
in 12
her 12
house 12
stick 12
by 12
stick 12
but 12
he 12
was 12
not 12
angry 12
now 12
only 12
exhausted 12
and 12
bewildered 12
with 12
himself 12
he 12
carried 12
the 12
books 12
into 12
the 12
backyard 12
and 12
hid 12
them 12
in 12
the 12
bushes 12
near 12
the 12
alley 12
fence 12
for 12
tonight 12
only 12
he 12
thought 12
in 12
case 12
she 12
decides 12
to 12
do 12
any 12
more 12
burning 12
he 12
went 12
back 12
through 12
the 12
house 12
mildred 12
he 12
called 12
at 12
the 12
door 12
of 12
the 12
darkened 12
bedroom 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
sound 12
outside 12
crossing 12
the 12
lawn 12
on 12
his 12
way 12
to 12
work 12
he 12
tried 12
not 12
to 12
see 12
how 12
completely 12
dark 12
and 12
deserted 12
clarisse 12
mcclellans 12
house 12
was 12
on 12
the 12
way 12
downtown 12
he 12
was 12
so 12
completely 12
alone 12
with 12
his 12
terrible 12
error 12
that 12
he 12
felt 12
the 12
necessity 12
for 12
the 12
strange 12
warmness 12
and 12
goodness 12
that 12
came 12
from 12
a 12
familiar 12
and 12
gentle 12
voice 12
speaking 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
already 12
in 12
a 12
few 12
short 12
hours 12
it 12
seemed 12
that 12
he 12
had 12
known 12
faber 12
a 12
lifetime 12
now 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
two 12
people 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
above 12
all 12
montag 12
who 12
knew 12
nothing 12
who 12
did 12
not 12
even 12
know 12
himself 12
a 12
fool 12
but 12
only 12
suspected 12
it 12
and 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
also 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
who 12
talked 12
to 12
him 12
and 12
talked 12
to 12
him 12
as 12
the 12
train 12
was 12
sucked 12
from 12
one 12
end 12
of 12
the 12
night 12
city 12
to 12
the 12
other 12
on 12
one 12
long 12
sickening 12
gasp 12
of 12
motion 12
in 12
the 12
days 12
to 12
follow 12
and 12
in 12
the 12
nights 12
when 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
moon 12
and 12
in 12
the 12
nights 12
when 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
very 12
bright 12
moon 12
shining 12
on 12
the 12
earth 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
would 12
go 12
on 12
with 12
this 12
talking 12
and 12
this 12
talking 12
drop 12
by 12
drop 12
stone 12
by 12
stone 12
flake 12
by 12
flake 12
his 12
mind 12
would 12
well 12
over 12
at 12
last 12
and 12
he 12
would 12
not 12
be 12
montag 12
any 12
more 12
this 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
told 12
him 12
assured 12
him 12
promised 12
him 12
he 12
would 12
be 12
montagplusfaber 12
fire 12
plus 12
water 12
and 12
then 12
one 12
day 12
after 12
everything 12
had 12
mixed 12
and 12
simmered 12
and 12
worked 12
away 12
in 12
silence 12
there 12
would 12
be 12
neither 12
fire 12
nor 12
water 12
but 12
wine 12
out 12
of 12
two 12
separate 12
and 12
opposite 12
things 12
a 12
third 12
and 12
one 12
day 12
he 12
would 12
look 12
back 12
upon 12
the 12
fool 12
and 12
know 12
the 12
fool 12
even 12
now 12
he 12
could 12
feel 12
the 12
start 12
of 12
the 12
long 12
journey 12
the 12
leavetaking 12
the 12
going 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
self 12
he 12
had 12
been 12
it 12
was 12
good 12
listening 12
to 12
the 12
beetle 12
hum 12
the 12
sleepy 12
mosquito 12
buzz 12
and 12
delicate 12
filigree 12
murmur 12
of 12
the 12
old 12
mans 12
voice 12
at 12
first 12
scolding 12
him 12
and 12
then 12
consoling 12
him 12
in 12
the 12
late 12
hour 12
of 12
night 12
as 12
he 12
emerged 12
from 12
the 12
steaming 12
subway 12
toward 12
the 12

all 12
about 12
in 12
plaster 12
silence 12
and 12
the 12

salamander 12

the 12
brass 12
pole 12
and 12
slid 12
up 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12

at 12

a 12
very 12

in 12
all 12

called 12
a 12
fool 12

beatty 12
tossed 12
the 12
book 12
into 12
the 12
trashbasket 12
and 12
lit 12
a 12
cigarette 12

over 12

in 12
for 12
a 12
hand 12
of 12
poker 12
they 12
sat 12
and 12
the 12
cards 12
were 12
dealt 12
in 12
beattys 12
sight 12
montag 12
felt 12
the 12
guilt 12
of 12
his 12
hands 12
his 12
fingers 12
were 12
like 12
ferrets 12
that 12
had 12
done 12
some 12
evil 12
and 12
now 12
never 12
rested 12
always 12
stirred 12
and 12
picked 12
and 12
hid 12
in 12

so 12
much 12
as 12
breathed 12
on 12
them 12
montag 12
felt 12
that 12
his 12
hands 12
might 12
wither 12
turn 12
over 12
on 12
their 12
sides 12
and 12
never 12
be 12
shocked 12
to 12
life 12
again 12
they 12
would 12
be 12
buried 12
the 12
rest 12
of 12
his 12
life 12
in 12
his 12
coatsleeves 12
forgotten 12
for 12
these 12
were 12
the 12
hands 12
that 12
had 12
acted 12
on 12
their 12
own 12
no 12
part 12
of 12
him 12
here 12
was 12
where 12
the 12
conscience 12
first 12
manifested 12
itself 12
to 12
snatch 12
books 12
dart 12
off 12
with 12
job 12
and 12
ruth 12
and 12
willie 12
shakespeare 12
and 12
now 12
in 12
the 12
firehouse 12
these 12
hands 12
seemed 12
gloved 12
with 12
blood 12
twice 12
in 12
half 12
an 12
hour 12
montag 12
had 12
to 12
rise 12
from 12
the 12
game 12
and 12
go 12
to 12
the 12
latrine 12
to 12
wash 12
his 12
hands 12
when 12
he 12
came 12
back 12
he 12
hid 12
his 12
hands 12
under 12
the 12
table 12
beatty 12
laughed 12
lets 12
have 12
your 12
hands 12
in 12

not 12
that 12

all 12
laughed 12

the 12
crisis 12
is 12
past 12
and 12
all 12

well 12
the 12
sheep 12

you 12
quoting 12
dr 12
johnson 12

more 12
than 12

i 12
said 12
well 12
dr 12
johnson 12

good 12
humour 12
oh 12
god 12
he 12
speaks 12
only 12
of 12
his 12
horse 12
and 12
the 12
devil 12
can 12
cite 12
scripture 12
for 12
his 12
purpose 12
and 12
you 12
yelled 12
this 12
age 12
thinks 12
better 12
of 12
a 12
gilded 12
fool 12
than 12
of 12
a 12
threadbare 12
saint 12
in 12
wisdoms 12
school 12
and 12
i 12
whispered 12
gently 12
the 12
dignity 12
of 12
truth 12
is 12
lost 12
with 12
much 12
protesting 12
and 12
you 12
screamed 12
carcasses 12
bleed 12
at 12
the 12
sight 12
of 12
the 12
murderer 12

shoulders 12
of 12
the 12
furthest 12
of 12
the 12
two 12
and 12
i 12
summed 12
my 12
side 12
up 12
with 12
rare 12
serenity 12
in 12
the 12
folly 12
of 12
mistaking 12
a 12
metaphor 12
for 12
a 12
proof 12
a 12
torrent 12
of 12
verbiage 12
for 12
a 12
spring 12
of 12
capital 12

a 12
terrible 12
thing 12
in 12
using 12
the 12
very 12
books 12

to 12
to 12

you 12
on 12
every 12

there 12
you 12
are 12
lost 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
the 12
moor 12
in 12
a 12
great 12
welter 12
of 12
nouns 12
and 12
verbs 12
and 12
adjectives 12
and 12
at 12
the 12
very 12
end 12
of 12
my 12
dream 12
along 12
i 12
came 12
with 12
the 12
salamander 12

said 12
going 12
my 12
way 12
and 12
you 12
got 12
in 12
and 12
we 12
drove 12
back 12
to 12
the 12
firehouse 12
in 12
beatific 12
silence 12
all 12
dwindled 12
away 12
to 12
peace 12
beatty 12
let 12
montags 12
wrist 12
go 12

the 12

limply 12
on 12
the 12
table 12
alls 12
well 12
that 12
is 12
well 12
in 12
the 12
end 12
silence 12
montag 12
sat 12
like 12
a 12
carved 12
white 12
stone 12
the 12
echo 12
of 12
the 12
final 12
hammer 12
on 12
his 12
skull 12
died 12
slowly 12
away 12
into 12
the 12
black 12
cavern 12
where 12
faber 12
waited 12
for 12
the 12
echoes 12
to 12
subside 12
and 12
then 12
when 12
the 12
startled 12
dust 12
had 12
settled 12
down 12
about 12
montags 12
mind 12
faber 12
began 12
softly 12
all 12
right 12
hes 12
had 12
his 12
say 12
you 12
must 12
take 12
it 12
in 12
ill 12
say 12
my 12
say 12
too 12
in 12
the 12
next 12
few 12
hours 12
and 12
youll 12
take 12
it 12
in 12
and 12
youll 12
try 12
to 12
judge 12
them 12
and 12
make 12
your 12
decision 12
as 12
to 12
which 12
way 12
to 12
jump 12
or 12
fall 12
but 12
i 12
want 12
it 12
to 12
be 12
your 12
decision 12
not 12
mine 12
and 12
not 12
the 12
captains 12
but 12
remember 12
that 12
the 12
captain 12
belongs 12
to 12
the 12
most 12
dangerous 12
enemy 12
of 12
truth 12
and 12
freedom 12
the 12
solid 12
unmoving 12
cattle 12
of 12
the 12
majority 12
oh 12
god 12
the 12
terrible 12
tyranny 12
of 12
the 12
majority 12
we 12
all 12
have 12
our 12
harps 12
to 12
play 12
and 12
its 12
up 12
to 12
you 12
now 12
to 12
know 12
with 12
which 12
ear 12
youll 12
listen 12
montag 12
opened 12
his 12
mouth 12
to 12
answer 12
faber 12
and 12
was 12
saved 12
this 12
error 12
in 12
the 12
presence 12
of 12
others 12
when 12
the 12
station 12
bell 12
rang 12

his 12
poker 12
cards 12
in 12
one 12
pink 12
hand 12
walked 12
with 12
exaggerated 12
slowness 12
to 12
the 12
phone 12
and 12
ripped 12
out 12
the 12
address 12
when 12
the 12
report 12
was 12
finished 12
he 12
glanced 12
perfunctorily 12
at 12
it 12
and 12
shoved 12
it 12
in 12
his 12
pocket 12
he 12
came 12
back 12
and 12
sat 12
down 12
the 12
others 12
looked 12
at 12
him 12
it 12
can 12
wait 12
exactly 12
forty 12
seconds 12
while 12

money 12
away 12
from 12

his 12
cards 12
down 12

of 12

this 12
hand 12
later 12
just 12

your 12
cards 12

down 12
and 12
hustle 12
the 12
equipment 12
on 12
the 12
double 12
now 12
and 12
beatty 12
rose 12
up 12
again 12
montag 12
you 12
dont 12
look 12
well 12

another 12
fever 12

a 12
special 12
case 12

on 12
jump 12
for 12
it 12
they 12
leaped 12
into 12
the 12
air 12
and 12
clutched 12
the 12
brass 12
pole 12
as 12
if 12
it 12
were 12
the 12
last 12
vantage 12
point 12
above 12
a 12
tidal 12
wave 12
passing 12
below 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
brass 12
pole 12
to 12
their 12
dismay 12
slid 12
them 12
down 12
into 12
darkness 12
into 12
the 12
blast 12
and 12
cough 12
and 12
suction 12
of 12
the 12
gaseous 12
dragon 12
roaring 12
to 12
life 12
hey 12
they 12
rounded 12
a 12
corner 12
in 12
thunder 12
and 12
siren 12
with 12
concussion 12
of 12
tyres 12
with 12
scream 12
of 12
rubber 12
with 12
a 12
shift 12
of 12
kerosene 12
bulk 12
in 12
the 12
glittery 12
brass 12
tank 12
like 12
the 12
food 12
in 12
the 12
stomach 12
of 12
a 12
giant 12
with 12
montags 12
fingers 12
jolting 12
off 12
the 12
silver 12
rail 12
swinging 12
into 12
cold 12
space 12
with 12
the 12
wind 12
tearing 12
his 12
hair 12
back 12
from 12
his 12
head 12
with 12
the 12
wind 12
whistling 12
in 12
his 12
teeth 12
and 12
him 12
all 12
the 12
while 12
thinking 12
of 12
the 12
women 12
the 12
chaff 12
women 12
in 12
his 12
parlour 12
tonight 12
with 12
the 12
kernels 12
blown 12
out 12
from 12
under 12
them 12
by 12
a 12
neon 12
wind 12
and 12
his 12
silly 12
damned 12
reading 12
of 12
a 12
book 12
to 12
them 12
how 12
like 12
trying 12
to 12
put 12
out 12
fires 12
with 12
waterpistols 12
how 12
senseless 12
and 12
insane 12
one 12
rage 12
turned 12
in 12
for 12
another 12
one 12
anger 12
displacing 12
another 12
when 12
would 12
he 12
stop 12
being 12
entirely 12
mad 12
and 12
be 12
quiet 12

was 12
driving 12
tonight 12
slamming 12
the 12
salamander 12
around 12
corners 12
leaning 12
forward 12
high 12
on 12
the 12
drivers 12
throne 12
his 12
massive 12
black 12
slicker 12
flapping 12
out 12
behind 12
so 12
that 12
he 12
seemed 12
a 12
great 12
black 12
bat 12
flying 12
above 12
the 12
engine 12
over 12
the 12
brass 12
numbers 12
taking 12
the 12
full 12
wind 12
here 12
we 12

phosphorescent 12
cheeks 12
glimmered 12
in 12
the 12
high 12
darkness 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
smiling 12
furiously 12
here 12
we 12
are 12
the 12
salamander 12
boomed 12
to 12
a 12
halt 12
throwing 12
men 12
off 12
in 12
slips 12
and 12
clumsy 12
hops 12
montag 12
stood 12
fixing 12
his 12
raw 12
eyes 12
to 12
the 12
cold 12
bright 12
rail 12
under 12
his 12
clenched 12
fingers 12

the 12
men 12
ran 12
like 12
cripples 12
in 12
their 12
clumsy 12
boots 12
as 12
quietly 12
as 12
spiders 12
at 12
last 12
montag 12
raised 12
his 12
eyes 12
and 12

with 12
dry 12
satisfaction 12
the 12
other 12
with 12
disbelief 12
at 12
the 12
house 12
before 12
them 12
this 12
main 12
ring 12
in 12

stone 12
carving 12
to 12

one 12
suitcase 12

with 12
a 12
dreamlike 12
clenching 12
rigidity 12
in 12
her 12

away 12
and 12

seventy 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
far 12
down 12
the 12
street 12
gone 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
crash 12
like 12
the 12
falling 12
parts 12
of 12
a 12
dream 12
fashioned 12
out 12
of 12
warped 12
glass 12
mirrors 12
and 12
crystal 12
prisms 12
montag 12
drifted 12
about 12
as 12
if 12
still 12
another 12
incomprehensible 12
storm 12
had 12
turned 12
him 12
to 12
see 12
stoneman 12
and 12
black 12
wielding 12
axes 12
shattering 12
windowpanes 12
to 12
provide 12
crossventilation 12
the 12
brush 12
of 12
a 12
deathshead 12
moth 12
against 12
a 12
cold 12
black 12
screen 12
montag 12

happening 12
this 12
is 12
happening 12
to 12
me 12
said 12
montag 12
what 12
a 12
dreadful 12
surprise 12
said 12
beatty 12
for 12
everyone 12
nowadays 12
knows 12
absolutely 12
is 12
certain 12
that 12
nothing 12
will 12
ever 12
happen 12
to 12
me 12
others 12
die 12
i 12
go 12
on 12
there 12
are 12
no 12
consequences 12
and 12
no 12
responsibilities 12
except 12
that 12
there 12
are 12
but 12
lets 12
not 12
talk 12
about 12
them 12
eh 12
by 12
the 12
time 12
the 12
consequences 12
catch 12
up 12
with 12
you 12
its 12
too 12
late 12
isnt 12
it 12
montag 12
montag 12
can 12
you 12
get 12
away 12
run 12
asked 12
faber 12
montag 12
walked 12
but 12
did 12
not 12
feel 12
his 12
feet 12
touch 12
the 12
cement 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
night 12
grasses 12
beatty 12
flicked 12
his 12
igniter 12
nearby 12
and 12
the 12
small 12
orange 12
flame 12
drew 12
his 12
fascinated 12
gaze 12
what 12
is 12
there 12
about 12
fire 12
thats 12
so 12
lovely 12
no 12
matter 12
what 12
age 12
we 12
are 12
what 12
draws 12
us 12
to 12
it 12
beatty 12
blew 12
out 12
the 12
flame 12
and 12
lit 12
it 12
again 12
its 12
perpetual 12
motion 12
the 12
thing 12
man 12
wanted 12
to 12
invent 12
but 12
never 12
did 12
or 12
almost 12
perpetual 12
motion 12
if 12
you 12
let 12
it 12
go 12
on 12
itd 12
burn 12
our 12
lifetimes 12
out 12
what 12
is 12
fire 12
its 12
a 12
mystery 12
scientists 12
give 12
us 12
gobbledegook 12
about 12
friction 12
and 12
molecules 12
but 12
they 12
dont 12
really 12
know 12
its 12
real 12
beauty 12
is 12
that 12
it 12
destroys 12
responsibility 12
and 12
consequences 12
a 12
problem 12
gets 12
too 12
burdensome 12
then 12
into 12
the 12
furnace 12
with 12
it 12
now 12
montag 12
youre 12
a 12
burden 12
and 12
fire 12
will 12
lift 12
you 12
off 12
my 12
shoulders 12
clean 12
quick 12
sure 12
nothing 12
to 12
rot 12
later 12
antibiotic 12
aesthetic 12
practical 12
montag 12
stood 12
looking 12
in 12
now 12
at 12
this 12
queer 12
house 12
made 12
strange 12
by 12
the 12
hour 12
of 12
the 12
night 12
by 12
murmuring 12
neighbour 12
voices 12
by 12
littered 12
glass 12
and 12
there 12
on 12
the 12
floor 12
their 12
covers 12
torn 12
off 12
and 12
spilled 12
out 12
like 12
swanfeathers 12
the 12
incredible 12
books 12
that 12
looked 12
so 12
silly 12
and 12
really 12
not 12
worth 12
bothering 12
with 12
for 12
these 12
were 12
nothing 12
but 12
black 12
type 12
and 12
yellowed 12
paper 12
and 12
ravelled 12
binding 12
mildred 12
of 12
course 12
she 12
must 12
have 12
watched 12
him 12
hide 12
the 12
books 12
in 12
the 12
garden 12
and 12
brought 12
them 12
back 12
in 12
mildred 12
mildred 12
i 12
want 12
you 12
to 12
do 12
this 12
job 12
all 12
by 12
your 12
lonesome 12
montag 12
not 12
with 12
kerosene 12
and 12
a 12
match 12
but 12
piecework 12
with 12
a 12
flamethrower 12
your 12
house 12
your 12
cleanup 12
montag 12
cant 12
you 12
run 12
get 12
away 12
no 12
cried 12
montag 12
helplessly 12
the 12
hound 12
because 12
of 12
the 12
hound 12
faber 12
heard 12
and 12
beatty 12
thinking 12
it 12
was 12
meant 12
for 12
him 12
heard 12
yes 12
the 12
hounds 12
somewhere 12
about 12
the 12
neighbourhood 12
so 12
dont 12
try 12
anything 12
ready 12
ready 12
montag 12
snapped 12
the 12
safetycatch 12
on 12
the 12
flamethrower 12
fire 12
a 12
great 12
nuzzling 12
gout 12
of 12
flame 12
leapt 12
out 12
to 12
lap 12
at 12
the 12
books 12
and 12
knock 12
them 12
against 12
the 12
wall 12
he 12
stepped 12
into 12
the 12
bedroom 12
and 12
fired 12
twice 12
and 12
the 12
twin 12
beds 12
went 12
up 12
in 12
a 12
great 12
simmering 12
whisper 12
with 12
more 12
heat 12
and 12
passion 12
and 12
light 12
than 12
he 12
would 12
have 12
supposed 12
them 12
to 12
contain 12
he 12
burnt 12
the 12
bedroom 12
walls 12
and 12
the 12
cosmetics 12
chest 12
because 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
change 12
everything 12
the 12
chairs 12
the 12
tables 12
and 12
in 12
the 12
diningroom 12
the 12
silverware 12
and 12
plastic 12
dishes 12
everything 12
that 12
showed 12
that 12
he 12
had 12
lived 12
here 12
in 12
this 12
empty 12
house 12
with 12
a 12
strange 12
woman 12
who 12
would 12
forget 12
him 12
tomorrow 12
who 12
had 12
gone 12
and 12
quite 12
forgotten 12
him 12
already 12
listening 12
to 12
her 12
seashell 12
radio 12
pour 12
in 12
on 12
her 12
and 12
in 12
on 12
her 12
as 12
she 12
rode 12
across 12
town 12
alone 12
and 12
as 12
before 12
it 12
was 12
good 12
to 12
burn 12
he 12
felt 12
himself 12
gush 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
fire 12
snatch 12
rend 12
rip 12
in 12
half 12
with 12
flame 12
and 12
put 12
away 12
the 12
senseless 12
problem 12
if 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
solution 12
well 12
then 12
now 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
problem 12
either 12
fire 12
was 12
best 12
for 12
everything 12
the 12
books 12
montag 12
the 12
books 12
leapt 12
and 12
danced 12
like 12
roasted 12
birds 12
their 12
wings 12
ablaze 12
with 12
red 12
and 12
yellow 12
feathers 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
came 12
to 12
the 12
parlour 12
where 12
the 12
great 12
idiot 12
monsters 12
lay 12
asleep 12
with 12
their 12
white 12
thoughts 12
and 12
their 12
snowy 12
dreams 12
and 12
he 12
shot 12
a 12
bolt 12
at 12
each 12
of 12
the 12
three 12
blank 12
walls 12
and 12
the 12
vacuum 12
hissed 12
out 12
at 12
him 12
the 12
emptiness 12
made 12
an 12
even 12
emptier 12
whistle 12
a 12
senseless 12
scream 12
he 12
tried 12
to 12
think 12
about 12
the 12
vacuum 12
upon 12
which 12
the 12
nothingness 12
had 12
performed 12
but 12
he 12
could 12
not 12
he 12
held 12
his 12
breath 12
so 12
the 12
vacuum 12
could 12
not 12
get 12
into 12
his 12
lungs 12
he 12
cut 12
off 12
its 12
terrible 12
emptiness 12
drew 12
back 12
and 12
gave 12
the 12
entire 12
room 12
a 12
gift 12
of 12
one 12
huge 12
bright 12
yellow 12
flower 12
of 12
burning 12
the 12
fireproof 12
plastic 12
sheath 12
on 12
everything 12
was 12
cut 12
wide 12
and 12
the 12
house 12
began 12
to 12
shudder 12
with 12
flame 12
when 12
youre 12
quite 12
finished 12
said 12
beatty 12
behind 12
him 12
youre 12
under 12
arrest 12
the 12
house 12
fell 12
in 12
red 12
coals 12
and 12
black 12
ash 12
it 12
bedded 12
itself 12
down 12
in 12
sleepy 12
pinkgrey 12
cinders 12
and 12
a 12
smoke 12
plume 12
blew 12
over 12
it 12
rising 12
and 12
waving 12
slowly 12
back 12
and 12
forth 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
it 12
was 12
threethirty 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
the 12
crowd 12
drew 12
back 12
into 12
the 12
houses 12
the 12
great 12
tents 12
of 12
the 12
circus 12
had 12
slumped 12
into 12
charcoal 12
and 12
rubble 12
and 12
the 12
show 12
was 12
well 12
over 12
montag 12
stood 12
with 12
the 12
flamethrower 12
in 12
his 12
limp 12
hands 12
great 12
islands 12
of 12
perspiration 12
drenching 12
his 12
armpits 12
his 12
face 12
smeared 12
with 12
soot 12
the 12
other 12
firemen 12
waited 12
behind 12
him 12
in 12
the 12
darkness 12
their 12
faces 12
illuminated 12
faintly 12
by 12
the 12
smouldering 12
foundation 12
montag 12
started 12
to 12
speak 12
twice 12
and 12
then 12
finally 12
managed 12
to 12
put 12
his 12
thought 12
together 12
was 12

wife 12

and 12
levelled 12

earthquake 12
was 12
still 12
shaking 12
and 12
falling 12
and 12
shivering 12
inside 12
him 12
and 12
he 12
stood 12
there 12
his 12
knees 12
halfbent 12
under 12
the 12
great 12
load 12
of 12
tiredness 12
and 12
bewilderment 12
and 12
outrage 12
letting 12

a 12
hand 12
montag 12

he 12
was 12
running 12
with 12
his 12
mind 12
he 12
was 12
gone 12
leaving 12
this 12
dead 12
sootcovered 12
body 12
to 12

in 12

of 12

out 12
of 12

said 12
faber 12
montag 12
listened 12
beatty 12
struck 12
him 12
a 12
blow 12
on 12
the 12
head 12
that 12
sent 12
him 12
reeling 12
back 12
the 12
green 12
bullet 12
in 12
which 12
fabers 12
voice 12
whispered 12
and 12
cried 12
fell 12
to 12
the 12
sidewalk 12
beatty 12
snatched 12
it 12
up 12
grinning 12
he 12
held 12
it 12
half 12
in 12
half 12
out 12
of 12
his 12
ear 12
montag 12
heard 12
the 12
distant 12
voice 12
calling 12
montag 12
you 12
all 12
right 12
beatty 12
switched 12
the 12
green 12
bullet 12
off 12
and 12
thrust 12
it 12
in 12
his 12
pocket 12
well 12
so 12
theres 12
more 12
here 12

i 12
saw 12
you 12
tilt 12
your 12
head 12
listening 12
first 12
i 12
thought 12
you 12
had 12
a 12
seashell 12
but 12
when 12
you 12
turned 12
clever 12
later 12
i 12
wondered 12
well 12

this 12
and 12
drop 12
it 12
on 12
your 12
friend 12

said 12
montag 12
he 12
twitched 12
the 12
safety 12
catch 12
on 12
the 12
flamethrower 12
beatty 12
glanced 12
instantly 12
at 12
montags 12
fingers 12
and 12
his 12
eyes 12
widened 12
the 12
faintest 12
bit 12
montag 12
saw 12
the 12
surprise 12
there 12
and 12
himself 12
glanced 12
to 12
his 12
hands 12
to 12
see 12
what 12
new 12
thing 12
they 12
had 12
done 12
thinking 12
back 12
later 12
he 12
could 12
never 12
decide 12
whether 12
the 12
hands 12
or 12
beattys 12
reaction 12
to 12
the 12
hands 12
gave 12
him 12
the 12
final 12
push 12
toward 12
murder 12
the 12
last 12
rolling 12
thunder 12
of 12
the 12
avalanche 12
stoned 12
down 12
about 12
his 12
ears 12
not 12
touching 12
him 12
beatty 12
grinned 12
his 12
most 12
charming 12
grin 12
well 12
thats 12
one 12
way 12
to 12

audience 12

gun 12
on 12
a 12
man 12
and 12

to 12
your 12
speech 12

so 12
strong 12
in 12
honesty 12
that 12
they 12

by 12

as 12

idle 12

secondhand 12
litterateur 12
pull 12
the 12
trigger 12
he 12
took 12
one 12
step 12
toward 12
montag 12
montag 12
only 12
said 12
we 12
never 12

over 12
guy 12
said 12
beatty 12
with 12
a 12
fixed 12
smile 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
shrieking 12
blaze 12
a 12
jumping 12
sprawling 12
gibbering 12
mannikin 12
no 12
longer 12
human 12
or 12
known 12
all 12
writhing 12
flame 12
on 12
the 12
lawn 12
as 12
montag 12
shot 12
one 12
continuous 12
pulse 12
of 12
liquid 12
fire 12
on 12
him 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
hiss 12
like 12
a 12
great 12
mouthful 12
of 12
spittle 12
banging 12
a 12
redhot 12
stove 12
a 12
bubbling 12
and 12
frothing 12
as 12
if 12
salt 12
had 12
been 12
poured 12
over 12
a 12
monstrous 12
black 12
snail 12
to 12
cause 12
a 12
terrible 12
liquefaction 12
and 12
a 12
boiling 12
over 12
of 12
yellow 12
foam 12
montag 12
shut 12
his 12
eyes 12
shouted 12
shouted 12
and 12
fought 12
to 12
get 12
his 12
hands 12
at 12
his 12
ears 12
to 12
clamp 12
and 12
to 12
cut 12
away 12
the 12
sound 12
beatty 12
flopped 12
over 12
and 12
over 12
and 12
over 12
and 12
at 12
last 12
twisted 12
in 12
on 12
himself 12
like 12
a 12
charred 12
wax 12
doll 12
and 12
lay 12
silent 12
the 12
other 12
two 12
firemen 12
did 12
not 12
move 12
montag 12
kept 12
his 12
sickness 12
down 12
long 12
enough 12
to 12
aim 12
the 12
flamethrower 12
turn 12
around 12
they 12
turned 12
their 12
faces 12
like 12
blanched 12
meat 12
streaming 12
sweat 12
he 12
beat 12
their 12
heads 12
knocking 12
off 12
their 12
helmets 12
and 12
bringing 12
them 12
down 12
on 12
themselves 12
they 12
fell 12
and 12
lay 12
without 12
moving 12
the 12
blowing 12
of 12
a 12
single 12
autumn 12
leaf 12
he 12
turned 12
and 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
was 12
there 12
it 12
was 12
half 12
across 12
the 12
lawn 12
coming 12
from 12
the 12
shadows 12
moving 12
with 12
such 12
drifting 12
ease 12
that 12
it 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
single 12
solid 12
cloud 12
of 12
blackgrey 12
smoke 12
blown 12
at 12
him 12
in 12
silence 12
it 12
made 12
a 12
single 12
last 12
leap 12
into 12
the 12
air 12
coming 12
down 12
at 12
montag 12
from 12
a 12
good 12
three 12
feet 12
over 12
his 12
head 12
its 12
spidered 12
legs 12
reaching 12
the 12
procaine 12
needle 12
snapping 12
out 12
its 12
single 12
angry 12
tooth 12
montag 12
caught 12
it 12
with 12
a 12
bloom 12
of 12
fire 12
a 12
single 12
wondrous 12
blossom 12
that 12
curled 12
in 12
petals 12
of 12
yellow 12
and 12
blue 12
and 12
orange 12
about 12
the 12
metal 12
dog 12
clad 12
it 12
in 12
a 12
new 12
covering 12
as 12
it 12
slammed 12
into 12
montag 12
and 12
threw 12
him 12
ten 12
feet 12
back 12
against 12
the 12
bole 12
of 12
a 12
tree 12
taking 12
the 12
flamegun 12
with 12
him 12
he 12
felt 12
it 12
scrabble 12
and 12
seize 12
his 12
leg 12
and 12
stab 12
the 12
needle 12
in 12
for 12
a 12
moment 12
before 12
the 12
fire 12
snapped 12
the 12
hound 12
up 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
burst 12
its 12
metal 12
bones 12
at 12
the 12
joints 12
and 12
blew 12
out 12
its 12
interior 12
in 12
the 12
single 12
flushing 12
of 12
red 12
colour 12
like 12
a 12
skyrocket 12
fastened 12
to 12
the 12
street 12
montag 12
lay 12
watching 12
the 12
deadalive 12
thing 12
fiddle 12
the 12
air 12
and 12
die 12
even 12
now 12
it 12
seemed 12
to 12
want 12
to 12
get 12
back 12
at 12
him 12
and 12
finish 12
the 12
injection 12
which 12
was 12
now 12
working 12
through 12
the 12
flesh 12
of 12
his 12
leg 12
he 12
felt 12
all 12
of 12
the 12
mingled 12
relief 12
and 12
horror 12
at 12
having 12
pulled 12
back 12
only 12
in 12
time 12
to 12
have 12
just 12
his 12
knee 12
slammed 12
by 12
the 12
fender 12
of 12
a 12
car 12
hurtling 12
by 12
at 12
ninety 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
he 12
was 12
afraid 12
to 12
get 12
up 12
afraid 12
he 12
might 12
not 12
be 12
able 12
to 12
gain 12
his 12
feet 12
at 12
all 12
with 12
an 12
anaesthetized 12
leg 12
a 12
numbness 12
in 12
a 12
numbness 12
hollowed 12
into 12
a 12
numbness 12
and 12
now 12
the 12
street 12
empty 12
the 12
house 12
burnt 12
like 12
an 12
ancient 12
bit 12
of 12
stagescenery 12
the 12
other 12
homes 12
dark 12
the 12
hound 12
here 12
beatty 12
there 12
the 12
three 12
other 12
firemen 12
another 12
place 12
and 12
the 12
salamander 12
he 12
gazed 12
at 12
the 12
immense 12
engine 12
that 12
would 12
have 12
to 12
go 12
too 12
well 12
he 12
thought 12
lets 12
see 12
how 12
badly 12
off 12
you 12
are 12
on 12
your 12
feet 12
now 12
easy 12
easy 12
there 12
he 12
stood 12
and 12
he 12
had 12
only 12
one 12
leg 12
the 12
other 12
was 12
like 12
a 12
chunk 12
of 12
burnt 12
pinelog 12
he 12
was 12
carrying 12
along 12
as 12
a 12
penance 12
for 12
some 12
obscure 12
sin 12
when 12
he 12
put 12
his 12
weight 12
on 12
it 12
a 12
shower 12
of 12
silver 12
needles 12
gushed 12
up 12
the 12
length 12
of 12
the 12
calf 12
and 12
went 12
off 12
in 12
the 12
knee 12
he 12
wept 12
come 12
on 12
come 12
on 12
you 12
you 12
cant 12
stay 12
here 12
a 12
few 12
houselights 12
were 12
going 12
on 12
again 12
down 12
the 12
street 12
whether 12
from 12
the 12
incidents 12
just 12
passed 12
or 12
because 12
of 12
the 12
abnormal 12
silence 12
following 12
the 12
fight 12
montag 12
did 12
not 12
know 12
he 12
hobbled 12
around 12
the 12
ruins 12
seizing 12
at 12
his 12
bad 12
leg 12
when 12
it 12
lagged 12
talking 12
and 12
whimpering 12
and 12
shouting 12
directions 12
at 12
it 12
and 12
cursing 12
it 12
and 12
pleading 12
with 12
it 12
to 12
work 12
for 12
him 12
now 12
when 12
it 12
was 12
vital 12
he 12
heard 12
a 12
number 12
of 12
people 12
crying 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
darkness 12
and 12
shouting 12
he 12
reached 12
the 12
back 12
yard 12
and 12
the 12
alley 12
beatty 12
he 12
thought 12

and 12
he 12
stumbled 12
along 12
the 12
alley 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
a 12
shotgun 12
blast 12
went 12
off 12
in 12
his 12
leg 12
every 12
time 12
he 12
put 12
it 12
down 12
and 12
he 12

a 12
few 12
more 12
with 12

here 12
he 12
remembered 12
the 12
books 12
and 12
turned 12
back 12
just 12
on 12
the 12
off 12
chance 12
he 12
found 12
a 12
few 12
books 12
where 12
he 12
had 12
left 12
them 12
near 12
the 12
garden 12
fence 12
mildred 12
god 12
bless 12
her 12
had 12
missed 12
a 12
few 12
four 12
books 12
still 12
lay 12
hidden 12
where 12
he 12
had 12
put 12
them 12
voices 12
were 12
wailing 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
and 12
flashbeams 12
swirled 12
about 12
other 12
salamanders 12
were 12
roaring 12
their 12
engines 12
far 12
away 12
and 12
police 12
sirens 12
were 12
cutting 12
their 12
way 12
across 12
town 12
with 12
their 12
sirens 12
montag 12
took 12
the 12
four 12
remaining 12
books 12
and 12
hopped 12
jolted 12
hopped 12
his 12
way 12
down 12
the 12
alley 12
and 12
suddenly 12
fell 12
as 12
if 12
his 12
head 12
had 12
been 12
cut 12
off 12
and 12
only 12
his 12
body 12
lay 12
there 12
something 12
inside 12
had 12
jerked 12
him 12
to 12
a 12
halt 12
and 12
flopped 12
him 12
down 12
he 12
lay 12
where 12
he 12
had 12
fallen 12
and 12
sobbed 12
his 12
legs 12
folded 12
his 12
face 12
pressed 12
blindly 12
to 12
the 12
gravel 12
beatty 12
wanted 12
to 12
die 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
the 12
crying 12
montag 12
knew 12
it 12
for 12
the 12
truth 12
beatty 12
had 12
wanted 12
to 12
die 12
he 12
had 12
just 12
stood 12
there 12
not 12
really 12
trying 12
to 12
save 12
himself 12
just 12
stood 12
there 12
joking 12
needling 12
thought 12
montag 12
and 12
the 12
thought 12
was 12
enough 12
to 12
stifle 12
his 12
sobbing 12
and 12
let 12
him 12
pause 12
for 12
air 12
how 12
strange 12
strange 12
to 12
want 12
to 12
die 12
so 12
much 12
that 12
you 12
let 12
a 12
man 12
walk 12
around 12
armed 12
and 12
then 12
instead 12
of 12
shutting 12
up 12
and 12
staying 12
alive 12
you 12
go 12
on 12
yelling 12
at 12
people 12
and 12
making 12
fun 12
of 12
them 12
until 12
you 12
get 12
them 12
mad 12
and 12
then 12
at 12
a 12
distance 12
running 12
feet 12
montag 12
sat 12
up 12
lets 12
get 12
out 12
of 12
here 12
come 12
on 12
get 12
up 12
get 12
up 12
you 12
just 12
cant 12
sit 12
but 12
he 12
was 12
still 12
crying 12
and 12
that 12
had 12
to 12
be 12
finished 12
it 12
was 12
going 12
away 12
now 12
he 12
hadnt 12
wanted 12
to 12
kill 12
anyone 12
not 12
even 12
beatty 12
his 12
flesh 12
gripped 12
him 12
and 12
shrank 12
as 12
if 12
it 12
had 12
been 12
plunged 12
in 12
acid 12
he 12
gagged 12
he 12
saw 12
beatty 12
a 12
torch 12
not 12
moving 12
fluttering 12
out 12
on 12
the 12
grass 12
he 12
bit 12
at 12
his 12
knuckles 12
im 12
sorry 12
im 12
sorry 12
oh 12
god 12
sorry 12
he 12
tried 12
to 12
piece 12
it 12
all 12
together 12
to 12
go 12
back 12
to 12
the 12
normal 12
pattern 12
of 12
life 12
a 12
few 12
short 12
days 12
ago 12
before 12
the 12
sieve 12
and 12
the 12
sand 12
denhams 12
dentifrice 12
mothvoices 12
fireflies 12
the 12
alarms 12
and 12
excursions 12
too 12
much 12
for 12
a 12
few 12
short 12
days 12
too 12
much 12
indeed 12
for 12
a 12
lifetime 12
feet 12
ran 12
in 12
the 12
far 12
end 12
of 12
the 12
alley 12
get 12
up 12
he 12
told 12
himself 12
damn 12
it 12
get 12
up 12
he 12
said 12
to 12
the 12
leg 12
and 12
stood 12
the 12
pains 12
were 12
spikes 12
driven 12
in 12
the 12
kneecap 12
and 12
then 12
only 12
darning 12
needles 12
and 12
then 12
only 12
common 12
ordinary 12
safety 12
pins 12
and 12
after 12
he 12
had 12
dragged 12
along 12
fifty 12
more 12
hops 12
and 12
jumps 12
filling 12
his 12
hand 12
with 12
slivers 12
from 12
the 12
board 12
fence 12
the 12
prickling 12
was 12
like 12
someone 12
blowing 12
a 12
spray 12
of 12
scalding 12
water 12
on 12
that 12
leg 12
and 12
the 12
leg 12
was 12
at 12
last 12
his 12
own 12
leg 12
again 12
he 12
had 12
been 12
afraid 12
that 12
running 12
might 12
break 12
the 12
loose 12
ankle 12
now 12
sucking 12
all 12
the 12
night 12
into 12
his 12
open 12
mouth 12
and 12
blowing 12
it 12
out 12
pale 12
with 12
all 12
the 12
blackness 12
left 12
heavily 12
inside 12
himself 12
he 12
set 12
out 12
in 12
a 12
steady 12
jogging 12
pace 12
he 12
carried 12
the 12
books 12
in 12
his 12
hands 12
he 12
thought 12
of 12
faber 12
faber 12
was 12
back 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
steaming 12
lump 12
of 12
tar 12
that 12
had 12
no 12
name 12
or 12
identity 12
now 12
he 12
had 12
burnt 12
faber 12
too 12
he 12
felt 12
so 12
suddenly 12
shocked 12
by 12
this 12
that 12
he 12
felt 12
faber 12
was 12
really 12
dead 12
baked 12
like 12
a 12
roach 12
in 12
that 12
small 12
green 12
capsule 12
shoved 12
and 12
lost 12
in 12
the 12
pocket 12
of 12
a 12
man 12
who 12
was 12
now 12
nothing 12
but 12
a 12
frame 12
skeleton 12
strung 12
with 12
asphalt 12
tendons 12
you 12
must 12
remember 12
burn 12
them 12
or 12
theyll 12
burn 12
you 12
he 12
thought 12
right 12
now 12
its 12
as 12
simple 12
as 12
that 12
he 12
searched 12
his 12
pockets 12
the 12
money 12
was 12
there 12
and 12
in 12
his 12
other 12
pocket 12
he 12
found 12
the 12
usual 12
seashell 12
upon 12
which 12
the 12
city 12
was 12
talking 12
to 12
itself 12
in 12
the 12
cold 12
black 12
morning 12
police 12
alert 12
wanted 12
fugitive 12
in 12
city 12
has 12
committed 12
murder 12
and 12
crimes 12
against 12
the 12
state 12
name 12
guy 12
montag 12
occupation 12
fireman 12
last 12
seen 12
he 12
ran 12
steadily 12
for 12
six 12
blocks 12
in 12
the 12
alley 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
alley 12
opened 12
out 12
on 12
to 12
a 12
wide 12
empty 12
thoroughfare 12
ten 12
lanes 12
wide 12
it 12
seemed 12
like 12
a 12
boatless 12
river 12
frozen 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
raw 12
light 12
of 12
the 12
high 12
white 12
arclamps 12
you 12
could 12
drown 12
trying 12
to 12
cross 12
it 12
he 12
felt 12
it 12
was 12
too 12
wide 12
it 12
was 12
too 12
open 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
vast 12
stage 12
without 12
scenery 12
inviting 12
him 12
to 12
run 12
across 12
easily 12
seen 12
in 12
the 12
blazing 12
illumination 12
easily 12
caught 12
easily 12
shot 12
down 12
the 12
seashell 12
hummed 12
in 12
his 12
ear 12
watch 12
for 12
a 12
man 12
running 12
watch 12
for 12
the 12
running 12
man 12
watch 12
for 12
a 12
man 12
alone 12
on 12
foot 12
watch 12
montag 12
pulled 12
back 12
into 12
the 12
shadows 12
directly 12
ahead 12
lay 12
a 12
gas 12
station 12
a 12
great 12
chunk 12
of 12
porcelain 12
snow 12
shining 12
there 12
and 12
two 12
silver 12
beetles 12
pulling 12
in 12
to 12
fill 12
up 12
now 12
he 12
must 12
be 12
clean 12
and 12
presentable 12
if 12
he 12
wished 12
to 12
walk 12
not 12
run 12
stroll 12
calmly 12
across 12
that 12
wide 12
boulevard 12
it 12
would 12
give 12
him 12
an 12
extra 12
margin 12
of 12
safety 12
if 12
he 12
washed 12
up 12
and 12
combed 12
his 12
hair 12
before 12
he 12
went 12
on 12
his 12
way 12
to 12
get 12
where 12
yes 12
he 12
thought 12
where 12
am 12
i 12
running 12
nowhere 12
there 12
was 12
nowhere 12
to 12
go 12
no 12
friend 12
to 12
turn 12
to 12
really 12
except 12
faber 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
realized 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
indeed 12
running 12
toward 12
fabers 12
house 12
instinctively 12
but 12
faber 12
couldnt 12
hide 12
him 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
suicide 12
even 12
to 12
try 12
but 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
he 12
would 12
go 12
to 12
see 12
faber 12
anyway 12
for 12
a 12
few 12
short 12
minutes 12
fabers 12
would 12
be 12
the 12
place 12
where 12
he 12
might 12
refuel 12
his 12
fast 12
draining 12
belief 12
in 12
his 12
own 12
ability 12
to 12
survive 12
he 12
just 12
wanted 12
to 12
know 12
that 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
man 12
like 12
faber 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
see 12
the 12
man 12
alive 12
and 12
not 12
burned 12
back 12
there 12
like 12
a 12
body 12
shelled 12
in 12
another 12
body 12
and 12
some 12
of 12
the 12
money 12
must 12
be 12
left 12
with 12
faber 12
of 12
course 12
to 12
be 12
spent 12
after 12
montag 12
ran 12
on 12
his 12
way 12
perhaps 12
he 12
could 12
make 12
the 12
open 12
country 12
and 12
live 12
on 12
or 12
near 12
the 12
rivers 12
and 12
near 12
the 12
highways 12
in 12
the 12
fields 12
and 12
hills 12
a 12
great 12
whirling 12
whisper 12
made 12
him 12
look 12
to 12
the 12
sky 12
the 12
police 12
helicopters 12
were 12
rising 12
so 12
far 12
away 12
that 12
it 12
seemed 12
someone 12
had 12
blown 12
the 12
grey 12
head 12
off 12
a 12
dry 12
dandelion 12
flower 12
two 12
dozen 12
of 12
them 12
flurried 12
wavering 12
indecisive 12
three 12
miles 12
off 12
like 12
butterflies 12
puzzled 12
by 12
autumn 12
and 12
then 12
they 12
were 12
plummeting 12
down 12
to 12
land 12
one 12
by 12
one 12
here 12
there 12
softly 12
kneading 12
the 12
streets 12
where 12
turned 12
back 12
to 12
beetles 12
they 12
shrieked 12
along 12
the 12
boulevards 12
or 12
as 12
suddenly 12
leapt 12
back 12
into 12
the 12
sir 12
continuing 12
their 12
search 12
and 12
here 12
was 12
the 12
gas 12
station 12
its 12
attendants 12
busy 12
now 12
with 12
customers 12
approaching 12
from 12
the 12
rear 12
montag 12
entered 12
the 12
mens 12
washroom 12
through 12
the 12
aluminium 12
wall 12
he 12
heard 12
a 12
radio 12
voice 12
saying 12
war 12
has 12
been 12
declared 12
the 12
gas 12
was 12
being 12
pumped 12
outside 12
the 12
men 12
in 12
the 12
beetles 12
were 12
talking 12
and 12
the 12
attendants 12
were 12
talking 12
about 12
the 12
engines 12
the 12
gas 12
the 12
money 12
owed 12
montag 12
stood 12
trying 12
to 12
make 12
himself 12
feel 12
the 12
shock 12
of 12
the 12
quiet 12
statement 12
from 12
the 12
radio 12
but 12
nothing 12
would 12
happen 12
the 12
war 12
would 12
have 12
to 12
wait 12
for 12
him 12
to 12
come 12
to 12
it 12
in 12
his 12
personal 12
file 12
an 12
hour 12
two 12
hours 12
from 12
now 12
he 12
washed 12
his 12
hands 12
and 12
face 12
and 12
towelled 12
himself 12
dry 12
making 12
little 12
sound 12
he 12
came 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
washroom 12
and 12
shut 12
the 12
door 12
carefully 12
and 12
walked 12
into 12
the 12
darkness 12
and 12
at 12
last 12
stood 12
again 12
on 12
the 12
edge 12
of 12
the 12
empty 12
boulevard 12
there 12
it 12
lay 12
a 12
game 12
for 12
him 12
to 12
win 12
a 12
vast 12
bowling 12
alley 12
in 12
the 12
cool 12
morning 12
the 12
boulevard 12
was 12
as 12
clean 12
as 12
the 12
surface 12
of 12
an 12
arena 12
two 12
minutes 12
before 12
the 12
appearance 12
of 12
certain 12
unnamed 12
victims 12
and 12
certain 12
unknown 12
killers 12
the 12
air 12
over 12
and 12
above 12
the 12
vast 12
concrete 12
river 12
trembled 12
with 12
the 12
warmth 12
of 12
montags 12
body 12
alone 12
it 12
was 12
incredible 12
how 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
temperature 12
could 12
cause 12
the 12
whole 12
immediate 12
world 12
to 12
vibrate 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
phosphorescent 12
target 12
he 12
knew 12
it 12
he 12
felt 12
it 12
and 12
now 12
he 12
must 12
begin 12
his 12
little 12
walk 12
three 12
blocks 12
away 12
a 12
few 12
headlights 12
glared 12
montag 12
drew 12
a 12
deep 12
breath 12
his 12
lungs 12
were 12
like 12
burning 12
brooms 12
in 12
his 12
chest 12
his 12
mouth 12
was 12
sucked 12
dry 12
from 12
running 12
his 12
throat 12
tasted 12
of 12
bloody 12
iron 12
and 12
there 12
was 12
rusted 12
steel 12
in 12
his 12
feet 12
what 12
about 12
those 12
lights 12
there 12
once 12
you 12
started 12
walking 12
youd 12
have 12
to 12
gauge 12
how 12
fast 12
those 12
beetles 12
could 12
make 12
it 12
down 12
here 12
well 12
how 12
far 12
was 12
it 12
to 12
the 12
other 12
curb 12
it 12
seemed 12
like 12
a 12
hundred 12
yards 12
probably 12
not 12
a 12
hundred 12
but 12
figure 12
for 12
that 12
anyway 12
figure 12
that 12
with 12
him 12
going 12
very 12
slowly 12
at 12
a 12
nice 12
stroll 12
it 12
might 12
take 12
as 12
much 12
as 12
thirty 12
seconds 12
forty 12
seconds 12
to 12
walk 12
all 12
the 12
way 12
the 12
beetles 12
once 12
started 12
they 12
could 12
leave 12
three 12
blocks 12
behind 12
them 12
in 12
about 12
fifteen 12
seconds 12
so 12
even 12
if 12
halfway 12
across 12
he 12
started 12
to 12
run 12
he 12
put 12
his 12
right 12
foot 12
out 12
and 12
then 12
his 12
left 12
foot 12
and 12
then 12
his 12
right 12
he 12
walked 12
on 12
the 12
empty 12
avenue 12
even 12
if 12
the 12
street 12
were 12
entirely 12
empty 12
of 12
course 12
you 12
couldnt 12
be 12
sure 12
of 12
a 12
safe 12
crossing 12
for 12
a 12
car 12
could 12
appear 12
suddenly 12
over 12
the 12
rise 12
four 12
blocks 12
further 12
on 12
and 12
be 12
on 12
and 12
past 12
you 12
before 12
you 12
had 12
taken 12
a 12
dozen 12
breaths 12
he 12
decided 12
not 12
to 12
count 12
his 12
steps 12
he 12
looked 12
neither 12
to 12
left 12
nor 12
right 12
the 12
light 12
from 12
the 12
overhead 12
lamps 12
seemed 12
as 12
bright 12
and 12
revealing 12
as 12
the 12
midday 12
sun 12
and 12
just 12
as 12
hot 12
he 12
listened 12
to 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
the 12
car 12
picking 12
up 12
speed 12
two 12
blocks 12
away 12
on 12
his 12
right 12
its 12
movable 12
headlights 12
jerked 12
back 12
and 12
forth 12
suddenly 12
and 12
caught 12
at 12
montag 12
keep 12
going 12
montag 12
faltered 12
got 12
a 12
grip 12
on 12
the 12
books 12
and 12
forced 12
himself 12
not 12
to 12
freeze 12
instinctively 12
he 12
took 12
a 12
few 12
quick 12
running 12
steps 12
then 12
talked 12
out 12
loud 12
to 12
himself 12
and 12
pulled 12
up 12
to 12
stroll 12
again 12
he 12
was 12
now 12
half 12
across 12
the 12
street 12
but 12
the 12
roar 12
from 12
the 12
beetles 12
engines 12
whined 12
higher 12
as 12
it 12
put 12
on 12
speed 12
the 12
police 12
of 12
course 12
they 12
see 12
me 12
but 12
slow 12
now 12
slow 12
quiet 12
dont 12
turn 12
dont 12
look 12
dont 12
seem 12
concerned 12
walk 12
thats 12
it 12
walls 12
walk 12
the 12
beetle 12
was 12
rushing 12
the 12
beetle 12
was 12
roaring 12
the 12
beetle 12
raised 12
its 12
speed 12
the 12
beetle 12
was 12
whining 12
the 12
beetle 12
was 12
in 12
high 12
thunder 12
the 12
beetle 12
came 12
skimming 12
the 12
beetle 12
came 12
in 12
a 12
single 12
whistling 12
trajectory 12
fired 12
from 12
an 12
invisible 12
rifle 12
it 12
was 12
up 12
to 12
mph 12
it 12
was 12
up 12
to 12
at 12
least 12
montag 12
clamped 12
his 12
jaws 12
the 12
heat 12
of 12
the 12
racing 12
headlights 12
burnt 12
his 12
cheeks 12
it 12
seemed 12
and 12
jittered 12
his 12
eyelids 12
and 12
flushed 12
the 12
sour 12
sweat 12
out 12
all 12
over 12
his 12
body 12
he 12
began 12
to 12
shuffle 12
idiotically 12
and 12
talk 12
to 12
himself 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
broke 12
and 12
just 12
ran 12
he 12
put 12
out 12
his 12
legs 12
as 12
far 12
as 12
they 12
would 12
go 12
and 12
down 12
and 12
then 12

his 12
mind 12
plunged 12
on 12
yelling 12
in 12
concrete 12

now 12
as 12
his 12
head 12
jerked 12
about 12
to 12
confront 12
the 12
flashing 12
glare 12
now 12
the 12
beetle 12
was 12
swallowed 12
in 12
its 12
own 12
light 12
now 12
it 12
was 12
nothing 12
but 12
a 12
torch 12
hurtling 12
upon 12
him 12

and 12
fell 12
im 12
done 12
its 12
over 12
but 12
the 12
falling 12
made 12
a 12
difference 12
an 12
instant 12
before 12
reaching 12
him 12
the 12
wild 12
beetle 12
cut 12
and 12
swerved 12
out 12
it 12
was 12
gone 12
montag 12
lay 12
flat 12
his 12
head 12
down 12
wisps 12
of 12
laughter 12
trailed 12
back 12
to 12
him 12
with 12
the 12
blue 12
exhaust 12
from 12
the 12
beetle 12
his 12
right 12
hand 12
was 12
extended 12
above 12
him 12
flat 12
across 12
the 12
extreme 12
tip 12
of 12
his 12
middle 12
finger 12
he 12
saw 12
now 12
as 12
he 12
lifted 12
that 12
hand 12
a 12
faint 12
sixteenth 12
of 12
an 12
inch 12
of 12
black 12
tread 12
where 12
tyre 12
had 12
touched 12
in 12
passing 12
he 12
looked 12
at 12
that 12
black 12
line 12
with 12
disbelief 12
getting 12
to 12
his 12
feet 12
that 12
wasnt 12
the 12
police 12
he 12
thought 12
he 12
looked 12
down 12
the 12
boulevard 12
it 12
was 12
clear 12
now 12
a 12
carful 12
of 12
children 12
all 12
ages 12
god 12
knew 12
from 12
twelve 12
to 12
sixteen 12
out 12
whistling 12
yelling 12
hurrahing 12
had 12
seen 12
a 12
man 12
a 12
very 12
extraordinary 12
sight 12
a 12
man 12
strolling 12
a 12
rarity 12
and 12
simply 12
said 12
lets 12
get 12
him 12
not 12
knowing 12
he 12
was 12
the 12
fugitive 12
mr 12
montag 12
simply 12
a 12
number 12
of 12
children 12
out 12
for 12
a 12
long 12
night 12
of 12
roaring 12
five 12
or 12
six 12
hundred 12
miles 12
in 12
a 12
few 12
moonlit 12
hours 12
their 12
faces 12
icy 12
with 12
wind 12
and 12
coming 12
home 12
or 12
not 12
coming 12
at 12
dawn 12
alive 12
or 12
not 12
alive 12
that 12
made 12
the 12
adventure 12
they 12
would 12
have 12
killed 12
me 12
thought 12
montag 12
swaying 12
the 12
air 12
still 12
torn 12
and 12
stirring 12
about 12
him 12
in 12
dust 12
touching 12
his 12
bruised 12
cheek 12
for 12
no 12
reason 12
at 12
all 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
they 12
would 12
have 12
killed 12
me 12
he 12
walked 12
toward 12
the 12
far 12
kerb 12
telling 12
each 12
foot 12
to 12
go 12
and 12
keep 12
going 12
somehow 12
he 12
had 12
picked 12
up 12
the 12
spilled 12
books 12
he 12
didnt 12
remember 12
bending 12
or 12
touching 12
them 12
he 12
kept 12
moving 12
them 12
from 12
hand 12
to 12
hand 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
were 12
a 12
poker 12
hand 12
he 12
could 12
not 12
figure 12
i 12
wonder 12
if 12
they 12
were 12
the 12
ones 12
who 12
killed 12
clarisse 12
he 12
stopped 12
and 12
his 12
mind 12
said 12
it 12
again 12
very 12
loud 12
i 12
wonder 12
if 12
they 12
were 12
the 12
ones 12
who 12
killed 12
clarisse 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
run 12
after 12
them 12
yelling 12
his 12
eyes 12
watered 12
the 12
thing 12
that 12
had 12
saved 12
him 12
was 12
falling 12
flat 12
the 12
driver 12
of 12
that 12
car 12
seeing 12
montag 12
down 12
instinctively 12
considered 12
the 12
probability 12
that 12
running 12
over 12
a 12
body 12
at 12
that 12
speed 12
might 12
turn 12
the 12
car 12
upside 12
down 12
and 12
spill 12
them 12
out 12
if 12
montag 12
had 12
remained 12
an 12
upright 12
target 12
montag 12
gasped 12
far 12
down 12
the 12
boulevard 12
four 12
blocks 12
away 12
the 12
beetle 12
had 12
slowed 12
spun 12
about 12
on 12
two 12
wheels 12
and 12
was 12
now 12
racing 12
back 12
slanting 12
over 12
on 12
the 12
wrong 12
side 12
of 12
the 12
street 12
picking 12
up 12
speed 12
but 12
montag 12
was 12
gone 12
hidden 12
in 12
the 12
safety 12
of 12
the 12
dark 12
alley 12
for 12
which 12
he 12
had 12
set 12
out 12
on 12
a 12
long 12
journey 12
an 12
hour 12
or 12
was 12
it 12
a 12
minute 12
ago 12
he 12
stood 12
shivering 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
looking 12
back 12
out 12
as 12
the 12
beetle 12
ran 12
by 12
and 12
skidded 12
back 12
to 12
the 12
centre 12
of 12
the 12
avenue 12
whirling 12
laughter 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
all 12
about 12
it 12
gone 12
further 12
on 12
as 12
montag 12
moved 12
in 12
darkness 12
he 12
could 12
see 12
the 12
helicopters 12
falling 12
falling 12
like 12
the 12
first 12
flakes 12
of 12
snow 12
in 12
the 12
long 12
winter 12
to 12
come 12
the 12
house 12
was 12
silent 12
montag 12
approached 12
from 12
the 12
rear 12
creeping 12
through 12
a 12
thick 12
nightmoistened 12
scent 12
of 12
daffodils 12
and 12
roses 12
and 12
wet 12
grass 12
he 12
touched 12
the 12
screen 12
door 12
in 12
back 12
found 12
it 12
open 12
slipped 12
in 12
moved 12
across 12
the 12
porch 12
listening 12
mrs 12
black 12
are 12
you 12
asleep 12
in 12
there 12
he 12
thought 12
this 12
isnt 12
good 12
but 12
your 12
husband 12
did 12
it 12
to 12
others 12
and 12
never 12
asked 12
and 12
never 12
wondered 12
and 12
never 12
worried 12
and 12
now 12
since 12
youre 12
a 12
firemans 12
wife 12
its 12
your 12
house 12
and 12
your 12
turn 12
for 12
all 12
the 12
houses 12
your 12
husband 12
burned 12
and 12
the 12
people 12
he 12
hurt 12
without 12
thinking 12
the 12
house 12
did 12
not 12
reply 12
he 12
hid 12
the 12
books 12
in 12
the 12
kitchen 12
and 12
moved 12
from 12
the 12
house 12
again 12
to 12
the 12
alley 12
and 12
looked 12
back 12
and 12
the 12
house 12
was 12
still 12
dark 12
and 12
quiet 12
sleeping 12
on 12
his 12
way 12
across 12
town 12
with 12
the 12
helicopters 12
fluttering 12
like 12
torn 12
bits 12
of 12
paper 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
he 12
phoned 12
the 12
alarm 12
at 12
a 12
lonely 12
phone 12
booth 12
outside 12
a 12
store 12
that 12
was 12
closed 12
for 12
the 12
night 12
then 12
he 12
stood 12
in 12
the 12
cold 12
night 12
air 12
waiting 12
and 12
at 12
a 12
distance 12
he 12
heard 12
the 12
fire 12
sirens 12
start 12
up 12
and 12
run 12
and 12
the 12
salamanders 12
coming 12
coming 12
to 12
burn 12
mr 12
blacks 12
house 12
while 12
he 12
was 12
away 12
at 12
work 12
to 12
make 12
his 12
wife 12
stand 12
shivering 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
air 12
while 12
the 12
roof 12
let 12
go 12
and 12
dropped 12
in 12
upon 12
the 12
fire 12
but 12
now 12
she 12
was 12
still 12
asleep 12
good 12
night 12
mrs 12
black 12
he 12
thought 12
faber 12
another 12
rap 12
a 12
whisper 12
and 12
a 12
long 12
waiting 12
then 12
after 12
a 12
minute 12
a 12
small 12
light 12
flickered 12
inside 12
fabers 12
small 12
house 12
after 12
another 12
pause 12
the 12
back 12
door 12
opened 12
they 12
stood 12
looking 12
at 12
each 12
other 12
in 12
the 12
halflight 12
faber 12
and 12
montag 12
as 12
if 12
each 12
did 12
not 12
believe 12
in 12
the 12
others 12
existence 12
then 12
faber 12
moved 12
and 12
put 12
out 12
his 12
hand 12
and 12
grabbed 12
montag 12
and 12
moved 12
him 12
in 12
and 12
sat 12
him 12
down 12
and 12
went 12
back 12
and 12
stood 12
in 12
the 12
door 12
listening 12
the 12
sirens 12
were 12
wailing 12
off 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
distance 12
he 12
came 12
in 12
and 12
shut 12
the 12
door 12
montag 12
said 12

for 12
a 12
little 12
while 12

the 12
right 12
thing 12
at 12

the 12
old 12
man 12
it 12

faber 12
nodded 12
youd 12
better 12
head 12
for 12
the 12
river 12
if 12
you 12
can 12
follow 12
along 12
it 12
and 12
if 12
you 12
can 12
hit 12
the 12
old 12
railroad 12
lines 12
going 12
out 12
into 12
the 12
country 12
follow 12
them 12
even 12
though 12
practically 12
everythings 12
airborne 12
these 12
days 12
and 12
most 12
of 12
the 12
tracks 12
are 12
abandoned 12
the 12
rails 12
are 12
still 12
there 12
rusting 12
ive 12
heard 12
there 12
are 12
still 12
hobo 12
camps 12
all 12
across 12
the 12
country 12
here 12
and 12
there 12
walking 12
camps 12
they 12
call 12
them 12
and 12
if 12
you 12
keep 12
walking 12
far 12
enough 12
and 12
keep 12
an 12
eye 12
peeled 12
they 12
say 12
theres 12
lots 12
of 12
old 12
harvard 12
degrees 12
on 12
the 12
tracks 12
between 12
here 12
and 12
los 12
angeles 12
most 12
of 12
them 12
are 12
wanted 12
and 12
hunted 12
in 12
the 12
cities 12
they 12
survive 12
i 12
guess 12
there 12
arent 12
many 12
of 12
them 12
and 12
i 12
guess 12
the 12
governments 12
never 12
considered 12
them 12
a 12
great 12
enough 12
danger 12
to 12
go 12
in 12
and 12
track 12
them 12
down 12
you 12
might 12
hole 12
up 12
with 12
them 12
for 12
a 12
time 12
and 12
get 12
in 12
touch 12
with 12
me 12
in 12
st 12

lets 12
check 12
he 12
took 12
montag 12
quickly 12
into 12
the 12
bedroom 12
and 12
lifted 12
a 12
picture 12
frame 12
aside 12
revealing 12
a 12
television 12
screen 12
the 12
size 12
of 12
a 12
postal 12
card 12
i 12
always 12
wanted 12
something 12
very 12
small 12
something 12
i 12
could 12
talk 12
to 12
something 12
i 12
could 12
blot 12
out 12
with 12
the 12
palm 12
of 12
my 12
hand 12
if 12
necessary 12
nothing 12
that 12
could 12
shout 12
me 12
down 12
nothing 12
monstrous 12
big 12
so 12
you 12
see 12
he 12
snapped 12
it 12
on 12
montag 12
the 12
tv 12
set 12
said 12
and 12
lit 12
up 12
montag 12
the 12
name 12
was 12
spelled 12
out 12
by 12
the 12
voice 12
guy 12
montag 12
still 12
running 12
police 12
helicopters 12
are 12
up 12
a 12
new 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
has 12
been 12
brought 12
from 12
another 12
district 12
montag 12
and 12
faber 12
looked 12
at 12
each 12
other 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
never 12
fails 12
never 12
since 12
its 12
first 12
use 12
in 12
tracking 12
quarry 12
has 12
this 12
incredible 12
invention 12
made 12
a 12
mistake 12
tonight 12
this 12
network 12
is 12
proud 12
to 12
have 12
the 12
opportunity 12
to 12
follow 12
the 12
hound 12
by 12
camera 12
helicopter 12
as 12
it 12
starts 12
on 12
its 12
way 12
to 12
the 12
target 12
faber 12
poured 12
two 12
glasses 12
of 12
whisky 12
well 12
need 12
these 12
they 12
drank 12
nose 12
so 12
sensitive 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
can 12
remember 12
and 12
identify 12
ten 12
thousand 12
odourindexes 12
on 12
ten 12
thousand 12
men 12
without 12
resetting 12
faber 12
trembled 12
the 12
least 12
bit 12
and 12
looked 12
about 12
at 12
his 12
house 12
at 12
the 12
walls 12
the 12
door 12
the 12
doorknob 12
and 12
the 12
chair 12
where 12
montag 12
now 12
sat 12
montag 12
saw 12
the 12
look 12
they 12
both 12
looked 12
quickly 12
about 12
the 12
house 12
and 12
montag 12
felt 12
his 12
nostrils 12
dilate 12
and 12
he 12
knew 12
that 12
he 12
was 12
trying 12
to 12
track 12
himself 12
and 12
his 12
nose 12
was 12
suddenly 12
good 12
enough 12
to 12
sense 12
the 12
path 12
he 12
had 12
made 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
of 12
the 12
room 12
and 12
the 12
sweat 12
of 12
his 12
hand 12
hung 12
from 12
the 12
doorknob 12
invisible 12
but 12
as 12
numerous 12
as 12
the 12
jewels 12
of 12
a 12
small 12
chandelier 12
he 12
was 12
everywhere 12
in 12
and 12
on 12
and 12
about 12
everything 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
luminous 12
cloud 12
a 12
ghost 12
that 12
made 12
breathing 12
once 12
more 12
impossible 12
he 12
saw 12
faber 12
stop 12
up 12
his 12
own 12
breath 12
for 12
fear 12
of 12
drawing 12
that 12
ghost 12
into 12
his 12
own 12
body 12
perhaps 12
being 12
contaminated 12
with 12
the 12
phantom 12
exhalations 12
and 12
odours 12
of 12
a 12
running 12
man 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
is 12
now 12
landing 12
by 12
helicopter 12
at 12
the 12
site 12
of 12
the 12
burning 12
and 12
there 12
on 12
the 12
small 12
screen 12
was 12
the 12
burnt 12
house 12
and 12
the 12
crowd 12
and 12
something 12
with 12
a 12
sheet 12
over 12
it 12
and 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
sky 12
fluttering 12
came 12
the 12
helicopter 12
like 12
a 12
grotesque 12
flower 12
so 12
they 12
must 12
have 12
their 12
game 12
out 12
thought 12
montag 12
the 12
circus 12
must 12
go 12
on 12
even 12
with 12
war 12
beginning 12
within 12
the 12
hour 12
he 12
watched 12
the 12
scene 12
fascinated 12
not 12
wanting 12
to 12
move 12
it 12
seemed 12
so 12
remote 12
and 12
no 12
part 12
of 12
him 12
it 12
was 12
a 12
play 12
apart 12
and 12
separate 12
wondrous 12
to 12
watch 12
not 12
without 12
its 12
strange 12
pleasure 12
thats 12
all 12
for 12
me 12
you 12
thought 12
thats 12
all 12
taking 12
place 12
just 12
for 12
me 12
by 12
god 12
if 12
he 12
wished 12
he 12
could 12
linger 12
here 12
in 12
comfort 12
and 12
follow 12
the 12
entire 12
hunt 12
on 12
through 12
its 12
swift 12
phases 12
down 12
alleys 12
across 12
streets 12
over 12
empty 12
running 12
avenues 12
crossing 12
lots 12
and 12
playgrounds 12
with 12
pauses 12
here 12
or 12
there 12
for 12
the 12
necessary 12
commercials 12
up 12
other 12
alleys 12
to 12
the 12
burning 12
house 12
of 12
mr 12
and 12
mrs 12
black 12
and 12
so 12
on 12
finally 12
to 12
this 12
house 12
with 12
faber 12
and 12
himself 12
seated 12
drinking 12
while 12
the 12
electric 12
hound 12
snuffed 12
down 12
the 12
last 12
trail 12
silent 12
as 12
a 12
drift 12
of 12
death 12
itself 12
skidded 12
to 12
a 12
halt 12
outside 12
that 12
window 12
there 12
then 12
if 12
he 12
wished 12
montag 12
might 12
rise 12
walk 12
to 12
the 12
window 12
keep 12
one 12
eye 12
on 12
the 12
tv 12
screen 12
open 12
the 12
window 12
lean 12
out 12
look 12
back 12
and 12
see 12
himself 12
dramatized 12
described 12
made 12
over 12
standing 12
there 12
limned 12
in 12
the 12
bright 12
small 12
television 12
screen 12
from 12
outside 12
a 12
drama 12
to 12
be 12
watched 12
objectively 12
knowing 12
that 12
in 12
other 12
parlours 12
he 12
was 12
large 12
as 12
life 12
in 12
full 12
colour 12
dimensionally 12
perfect 12
and 12
if 12
he 12
kept 12
his 12
eye 12
peeled 12
quickly 12
he 12
would 12
see 12
himself 12
an 12
instant 12
before 12
oblivion 12
being 12
punctured 12
for 12
the 12
benefit 12
of 12
how 12
many 12
civilian 12
parloursitters 12
who 12
had 12
been 12
wakened 12
from 12
sleep 12
a 12
few 12
minutes 12
ago 12
by 12
the 12
frantic 12
sirening 12
of 12
their 12
livingroom 12
walls 12
to 12
come 12
watch 12
the 12
big 12
game 12
the 12
hunt 12
the 12
oneman 12
carnival 12
would 12
he 12
have 12
time 12
for 12
a 12
speech 12
as 12
the 12
hound 12
seized 12
him 12
in 12
view 12
of 12
ten 12
or 12
twenty 12
or 12
thirty 12
million 12
people 12
mightnt 12
he 12
sum 12
up 12
his 12
entire 12
life 12
in 12
the 12
last 12
week 12
in 12
one 12
single 12
phrase 12
or 12
a 12
word 12
that 12
would 12
stay 12
with 12
them 12
long 12
after 12
the 12
hound 12
had 12
turned 12
clenching 12
him 12
in 12
its 12
metalplier 12
jaws 12
and 12
trotted 12
off 12
in 12
darkness 12
while 12
the 12
camera 12
remained 12
stationary 12
watching 12
the 12
creature 12
dwindle 12
in 12
the 12
distance 12
a 12
splendid 12
fadeout 12
what 12
could 12
he 12
say 12
in 12
a 12
single 12
word 12
a 12
few 12
words 12
that 12
would 12
sear 12
all 12
their 12
faces 12
and 12
wake 12
them 12
up 12
there 12
whispered 12
faber 12
out 12
of 12
a 12
helicopter 12
glided 12
something 12
that 12
was 12
not 12
machine 12
not 12
animal 12
not 12
dead 12

the 12
cardboard 12
valise 12
with 12
clear 12
tape 12
to 12

shook 12
hands 12
again 12
and 12
going 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
door 12
they 12
glanced 12
at 12
the 12
tv 12
the 12
hound 12
was 12
on 12
its 12
way 12
followed 12
by 12
hovering 12
helicopter 12
cameras 12
silently 12
silently 12
sniffing 12
the 12
great 12
night 12
wind 12
it 12
was 12
running 12
down 12
the 12
first 12
alley 12
goodbye 12
and 12
montag 12
was 12
out 12
the 12
back 12
door 12
lightly 12
running 12
with 12
the 12
halfempty 12
valise 12
behind 12
him 12
he 12
heard 12
the 12
lawnsprinkling 12
system 12
jump 12
up 12
filling 12
the 12
dark 12
air 12
with 12
rain 12
that 12
fell 12
gently 12
and 12
then 12
with 12
a 12
steady 12
pour 12
all 12
about 12
washing 12
on 12
the 12
sidewalks 12
and 12
draining 12
into 12
the 12
alley 12
he 12
carried 12
a 12
few 12
drops 12
of 12
this 12
rain 12
with 12
him 12
on 12
his 12
face 12
he 12
thought 12
he 12
heard 12
the 12
old 12
man 12
call 12
goodbye 12
but 12
hewasnt 12
certain 12
he 12
ran 12
very 12
fast 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
house 12
down 12
toward 12
the 12
river 12
montag 12
ran 12
he 12
could 12
feel 12
the 12
hound 12
like 12
autumn 12
come 12
cold 12
and 12
dry 12
and 12
swift 12
like 12
a 12
wind 12
that 12
didnt 12
stir 12
grass 12
that 12
didnt 12
jar 12
windows 12
or 12
disturb 12
leafshadows 12
on 12
the 12
white 12
sidewalks 12
as 12
it 12
passed 12
the 12
hound 12
did 12
not 12
touch 12
the 12
world 12
it 12
carried 12
its 12
silence 12
with 12
it 12
so 12
you 12
could 12
feel 12
the 12
silence 12
building 12
up 12
a 12
pressure 12
behind 12
you 12
all 12
across 12
town 12
montag 12
felt 12
the 12
pressure 12
rising 12
and 12
ran 12
he 12
stopped 12
for 12
breath 12
on 12
his 12
way 12
to 12
the 12
river 12
to 12
peer 12
through 12
dimly 12
lit 12
windows 12
of 12
wakened 12
houses 12
and 12
saw 12
the 12
silhouettes 12
of 12
people 12
inside 12
watching 12
their 12
parlour 12
walls 12
and 12
there 12
on 12
the 12
walls 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
a 12
breath 12
of 12
neon 12
vapour 12
spidered 12
along 12
here 12
and 12
gone 12
here 12
and 12
gone 12
now 12
at 12
elm 12
terrace 12
lincoln 12
oak 12
park 12
and 12
up 12
the 12
alley 12
toward 12
fabers 12
house 12
go 12
past 12
thought 12
montag 12
dont 12
stop 12
go 12
on 12
dont 12
turn 12
in 12
on 12
the 12
parlour 12
wall 12
fabers 12
house 12
with 12
its 12
sprinkler 12
system 12
pulsing 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
air 12
the 12
hound 12
paused 12
quivering 12
no 12
montag 12
held 12
to 12
the 12
window 12
sill 12
this 12
way 12
here 12
the 12
procaine 12
needle 12
flicked 12
out 12
and 12
in 12
out 12
and 12
in 12
a 12
single 12
clear 12
drop 12
of 12
the 12
stuff 12
of 12
dreams 12
fell 12
from 12
the 12
needle 12
as 12
it 12
vanished 12
in 12
the 12
hounds 12
muzzle 12
montag 12
held 12
his 12
breath 12
like 12
a 12
doubled 12
fist 12
in 12
his 12
chest 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
turned 12
and 12
plunged 12
away 12
from 12
fabers 12
house 12
down 12
the 12
alley 12
again 12
montag 12
snapped 12
his 12
gaze 12
to 12
the 12
sky 12
the 12
helicopters 12
were 12
closer 12
a 12
great 12
blowing 12
of 12
insects 12
to 12
a 12
single 12
light 12
source 12
with 12
an 12
effort 12
montag 12
reminded 12
himself 12
again 12
that 12
this 12
was 12
no 12
fictional 12
episode 12
to 12
be 12
watched 12
on 12
his 12
run 12
to 12
the 12
river 12
it 12
was 12
in 12
actuality 12
his 12
own 12
chessgame 12
he 12
was 12
witnessing 12
move 12
by 12
move 12
he 12
shouted 12
to 12
give 12
himself 12
the 12
necessary 12
push 12
away 12
from 12
this 12
last 12
house 12
window 12
and 12
the 12
fascinating 12
seance 12
going 12
on 12
in 12
there 12
hell 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
away 12
and 12
gone 12
the 12
alley 12
a 12
street 12
the 12
alley 12
a 12
street 12
and 12
the 12

of 12
the 12

leg 12
out 12
leg 12

out 12

down 12
twenty 12

if 12
the 12
cameras 12
caught 12
him 12
twenty 12
million 12
montags 12
running 12
running 12

behind 12
him 12
now 12
twenty 12
million 12
silently 12

at 12

he 12
felt 12
the 12
city 12

he 12
felt 12
the 12
city 12
turn 12
to 12
its 12
thousands 12
of 12
doors 12
faster 12

four 12
the 12
people 12
sleepwalking 12
in 12
their 12
hallways 12
five 12
he 12
felt 12
their 12
hands 12
on 12
the 12
doorknobs 12
the 12
smell 12
of 12
the 12
river 12
was 12
cool 12
and 12
like 12
a 12
solid 12
rain 12
his 12
throat 12
was 12
burnt 12
rust 12
and 12
his 12
eyes 12
were 12
wept 12
dry 12
with 12
running 12
he 12
yelled 12
as 12
if 12
this 12
yell 12
would 12
jet 12
him 12
on 12
fling 12
him 12
the 12
last 12
hundred 12
yards 12
six 12
seven 12
eight 12
the 12
doorknobs 12
turned 12
on 12
five 12
thousand 12
doors 12
nine 12
he 12
ran 12
out 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
last 12
row 12
of 12
houses 12
on 12
a 12
slope 12
leading 12
down 12
to 12
a 12
solid 12
moving 12
blackness 12
ten 12
the 12
doors 12
opened 12
he 12
imagined 12
thousands 12
on 12
thousands 12
of 12
faces 12
peering 12
into 12
yards 12
into 12
alleys 12
and 12
into 12
the 12
sky 12
faces 12
hid 12
by 12
curtains 12
pale 12
nightfrightened 12
faces 12
like 12
grey 12
animals 12
peering 12
from 12
electric 12
caves 12
faces 12
with 12
grey 12
colourless 12
eyes 12
grey 12
tongues 12
and 12
grey 12
thoughts 12
looking 12
out 12
through 12
the 12
numb 12
flesh 12
of 12
the 12
face 12
but 12
he 12
was 12
at 12
the 12
river 12
he 12
touched 12
it 12
just 12
to 12
be 12
sure 12
it 12
was 12
real 12
he 12
waded 12
in 12
and 12
stripped 12
in 12
darkness 12
to 12
the 12
skin 12
splashed 12
his 12
body 12
arms 12
legs 12
and 12
head 12
with 12
raw 12
liquor 12
drank 12
it 12
and 12
snuffed 12
some 12
up 12
his 12
nose 12
then 12
he 12
dressed 12
in 12
fabers 12
old 12
clothes 12
and 12
shoes 12
he 12
tossed 12
his 12
own 12
clothing 12
into 12
the 12
river 12
and 12
watched 12
it 12
swept 12
away 12
then 12
holding 12
the 12
suitcase 12
he 12
walked 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
river 12
until 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
bottom 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
swept 12
away 12
in 12
the 12
dark 12
he 12
was 12
three 12
hundred 12
yards 12
downstream 12
when 12
the 12
hound 12
reached 12
the 12
river 12
overhead 12
the 12
great 12
racketing 12
fans 12
of 12
the 12
helicopters 12
hovered 12
a 12
storm 12
of 12
light 12
fell 12
upon 12
the 12
river 12
and 12
montag 12
dived 12
under 12
the 12
great 12
illumination 12
as 12
if 12
the 12
sun 12
had 12
broken 12
the 12
clouds 12
he 12
felt 12
the 12
river 12
pull 12
him 12
further 12
on 12
its 12
way 12
into 12
darkness 12
then 12
the 12
lights 12
switched 12
back 12
to 12
the 12
land 12
the 12
helicopters 12
swerved 12
over 12
the 12
city 12
again 12
as 12
if 12
they 12
had 12
picked 12
up 12
another 12
trail 12
they 12
were 12
gone 12
the 12
hound 12
was 12
gone 12
now 12
there 12
was 12
only 12
the 12
cold 12
river 12
and 12
montag 12
floating 12
in 12
a 12
sudden 12
peacefulness 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
city 12
and 12
the 12
lights 12
and 12
the 12
chase 12
away 12
from 12
everything 12
he 12
felt 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
had 12
left 12
a 12
stage 12
behind 12
and 12
many 12
actors 12
he 12
felt 12
as 12
if 12
he 12
had 12
left 12
the 12
great 12
seance 12
and 12
all 12
the 12
murmuring 12
ghosts 12
he 12
was 12
moving 12
from 12
an 12
unreality 12
that 12
was 12
frightening 12
into 12
a 12
reality 12
that 12
was 12
unreal 12
because 12
it 12
was 12
new 12
the 12
black 12
land 12
slid 12
by 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
going 12
into 12
the 12
country 12
among 12
the 12
hills 12
for 12
the 12
first 12
time 12
in 12
a 12
dozen 12
years 12
the 12
stars 12
were 12
coming 12
out 12
above 12
him 12
in 12
great 12
processions 12
of 12
wheeling 12
fire 12
he 12
saw 12
a 12
great 12
juggernaut 12
of 12
stars 12
form 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
and 12
threaten 12
to 12
roll 12
over 12
and 12
crush 12
him 12
he 12
floated 12
on 12
his 12
back 12
when 12
the 12
valise 12
filled 12
and 12
sank 12
the 12
river 12
was 12
mild 12
and 12
leisurely 12
going 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
people 12
who 12
ate 12
shadows 12
for 12
breakfast 12
and 12
steam 12
for 12
lunch 12
and 12
vapours 12
for 12
supper 12
the 12
river 12
was 12
very 12
real 12
it 12
held 12
him 12
comfortably 12
and 12
gave 12
him 12
the 12
time 12
at 12
last 12
the 12
leisure 12
to 12
consider 12
this 12
month 12
this 12
year 12
and 12
a 12
lifetime 12
of 12
years 12
he 12
listened 12
to 12
his 12
heart 12
slow 12
his 12
thoughts 12
stopped 12
rushing 12
with 12
his 12
blood 12
he 12
saw 12
the 12
moon 12
low 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
now 12
the 12
moon 12
there 12
and 12
the 12
light 12
of 12
the 12
moon 12
caused 12
by 12
what 12
by 12
the 12
sun 12
of 12
course 12
and 12
what 12
lights 12
the 12
sun 12
its 12
own 12
fire 12
and 12
the 12
sun 12
goes 12
on 12
day 12
after 12
day 12
burning 12
and 12
burning 12
the 12
sun 12
and 12
time 12
the 12
sun 12
and 12
time 12
and 12
burning 12
burning 12
the 12
river 12
bobbled 12
him 12
along 12
gently 12
burning 12
the 12
sun 12
and 12
every 12
clock 12
on 12
the 12
earth 12
it 12
all 12
came 12
together 12
and 12
became 12
a 12
single 12
thing 12
in 12
his 12
mind 12
after 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
of 12
floating 12
on 12
the 12
land 12
and 12
a 12
short 12
time 12
of 12
floating 12
in 12
the 12
river 12
he 12
knew 12
why 12
he 12
must 12
never 12
burn 12
again 12
in 12
his 12
life 12
the 12
sun 12
burned 12
every 12
day 12
it 12
burned 12
time 12
the 12
world 12
rushed 12
in 12
a 12
circle 12
and 12
turned 12
on 12
its 12
axis 12
and 12
time 12
was 12
busy 12
burning 12
the 12
years 12
and 12
the 12
people 12
anyway 12
without 12
any 12
help 12
from 12
him 12
so 12
if 12
he 12
burnt 12
things 12
with 12
the 12
firemen 12
and 12
the 12
sun 12
burnt 12
time 12
that 12
meant 12
that 12
everything 12
burned 12
one 12
of 12
them 12
had 12
to 12
stop 12
burning 12
the 12
sun 12
wouldnt 12
certainly 12
so 12
it 12
looked 12
as 12
if 12
it 12
had 12
to 12
be 12
montag 12
and 12
the 12
people 12
he 12
had 12
worked 12
with 12
until 12
a 12
few 12
short 12
hours 12
ago 12
somewhere 12
the 12
saving 12
and 12
putting 12
away 12
had 12
to 12
begin 12
again 12
and 12
someone 12
had 12
to 12
do 12
the 12
saving 12
and 12
keeping 12
one 12
way 12
or 12
another 12
in 12
books 12
in 12
records 12
in 12
peoples 12
heads 12
any 12
way 12
at 12
all 12
so 12
long 12
as 12
it 12
was 12
safe 12
free 12
from 12
moths 12
silverfish 12
rust 12
and 12
dryrot 12
and 12
men 12
with 12
matches 12
the 12
world 12
was 12
full 12
of 12
burning 12
of 12
all 12
types 12
and 12
sizes 12
now 12
the 12
guild 12
of 12
the 12
asbestosweaver 12
must 12
open 12
shop 12
very 12
soon 12
he 12
felt 12
his 12
heel 12
bump 12
land 12
touch 12
pebbles 12
and 12
rocks 12
scrape 12
sand 12
the 12
river 12
had 12
moved 12
him 12
toward 12
shore 12
he 12
looked 12
in 12
at 12
the 12
great 12
black 12
creature 12
without 12
eyes 12
or 12
light 12
without 12
shape 12
with 12
only 12
a 12
size 12
that 12
went 12
a 12
thousand 12
miles 12
without 12
wanting 12
to 12
stop 12
with 12
its 12
grass 12
hills 12
and 12
forests 12
that 12
were 12
waiting 12
for 12
him 12
he 12
hesitated 12
to 12
leave 12
the 12
comforting 12
flow 12
of 12
the 12
water 12
he 12
expected 12
the 12
hound 12
there 12
suddenly 12
the 12
trees 12
might 12
blow 12
under 12
a 12
great 12
wind 12
of 12
helicopters 12
but 12
there 12
was 12
only 12
the 12
normal 12
autumn 12
wind 12
high 12
up 12
going 12
by 12
like 12
another 12
river 12
why 12
wasnt 12
the 12
hound 12
running 12
why 12
had 12
the 12
search 12
veered 12
inland 12
montag 12
listened 12
nothing 12
nothing 12
millie 12
he 12
thought 12
all 12
this 12
country 12
here 12
listen 12
to 12
it 12
nothing 12
and 12
nothing 12
so 12
much 12
silence 12
millie 12
i 12
wonder 12
how 12
youd 12
take 12
it 12
would 12
you 12
shout 12
shut 12
up 12
shut 12
up 12
millie 12
millie 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
sad 12
millie 12
was 12
not 12
here 12
and 12
the 12
hound 12
was 12
not 12
here 12
but 12
the 12
dry 12
smell 12
of 12
hay 12
blowing 12
from 12
some 12
distant 12
field 12
put 12
montag 12
on 12
the 12
land 12
he 12
remembered 12
a 12
farm 12
he 12
had 12
visited 12
when 12
he 12
was 12
very 12
young 12
one 12
of 12
the 12
rare 12
times 12
he 12
had 12
discovered 12
that 12
somewhere 12
behind 12
the 12
seven 12
veils 12
of 12
unreality 12
beyond 12
the 12
walls 12
of 12
parlours 12
and 12
beyond 12
the 12
tin 12
moat 12
of 12
the 12
city 12
cows 12
chewed 12
grass 12
and 12
pigs 12
sat 12
in 12
warm 12
ponds 12
at 12
noon 12
and 12
dogs 12
barked 12
after 12
white 12
sheep 12
on 12
a 12
hill 12
now 12
the 12
dry 12
smell 12
of 12
hay 12
the 12
motion 12
of 12
the 12
waters 12
made 12
him 12
think 12
of 12
sleeping 12
in 12
fresh 12
hay 12
in 12
a 12
lonely 12
barn 12
away 12
from 12
the 12
loud 12
highways 12
behind 12
a 12
quiet 12
farmhouse 12
and 12
under 12
an 12
ancient 12
windmill 12
that 12
whirred 12
like 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
the 12
passing 12
years 12
overhead 12
he 12
lay 12
in 12
the 12
high 12
barn 12
loft 12
all 12
night 12
listening 12
to 12
distant 12
animals 12
and 12
insects 12
and 12
trees 12
the 12
little 12
motions 12
and 12
stirrings 12
during 12
the 12
night 12
he 12
thought 12
below 12
the 12
loft 12
he 12
would 12
hear 12
a 12
sound 12
like 12
feet 12
moving 12
perhaps 12
he 12
would 12
tense 12
and 12
sit 12
up 12
the 12
sound 12
would 12
move 12
away 12
he 12
would 12
lie 12
back 12
and 12
look 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
loft 12
window 12
very 12
late 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
and 12
see 12
the 12
lights 12
go 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
farmhouse 12
itself 12
until 12
a 12
very 12
young 12
and 12
beautiful 12
woman 12
would 12
sit 12
in 12
an 12
unlit 12
window 12
braiding 12
her 12
hair 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
hard 12
to 12
see 12
her 12
but 12
her 12
face 12
would 12
be 12
like 12
the 12
face 12
of 12
the 12
girl 12
so 12
long 12
ago 12
in 12
his 12
past 12
now 12
so 12
very 12
long 12
ago 12
the 12
girl 12
who 12
had 12
known 12
the 12
weather 12
and 12
never 12
been 12
burned 12
by 12
the 12
fireflies 12
the 12
girl 12
who 12
had 12
known 12
what 12
dandelions 12
meant 12
rubbed 12
off 12
on 12
your 12
chin 12
then 12
she 12
would 12
be 12
gone 12
from 12
the 12
warm 12
window 12
and 12
appear 12
again 12
upstairs 12
in 12
her 12
moonwhitened 12
room 12
and 12
then 12
to 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
death 12
the 12
sound 12
of 12
the 12
jets 12
cutting 12
the 12
sky 12
into 12
two 12
black 12
pieces 12
beyond 12
the 12
horizon 12
he 12
would 12
lie 12
in 12
the 12
loft 12
hidden 12
and 12
safe 12
watching 12
those 12
strange 12
new 12
stars 12
over 12
the 12
rim 12
of 12
the 12
earth 12
fleeing 12
from 12
the 12
soft 12
colour 12
of 12
dawn 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
he 12
would 12
not 12
have 12
needed 12
sleep 12
for 12
all 12
the 12
warm 12
odours 12
and 12
sights 12
of 12
a 12
complete 12
country 12
night 12
would 12
have 12
rested 12
and 12
slept 12
him 12
while 12
his 12
eyes 12
were 12
wide 12
and 12
his 12
mouth 12
when 12
he 12
thought 12
to 12
test 12
it 12
was 12
half 12
a 12
smile 12
and 12
there 12
at 12
the 12
bottom 12
of 12
the 12
hayloft 12
stair 12
waiting 12
for 12
him 12
would 12
be 12
the 12
incredible 12
thing 12
he 12
would 12
step 12
carefully 12
down 12
in 12
the 12
pink 12
light 12
of 12
early 12
morning 12
so 12
fully 12
aware 12
of 12
the 12
world 12
that 12
he 12
would 12
be 12
afraid 12
and 12
stand 12
over 12
the 12
small 12
miracle 12
and 12
at 12
last 12
bend 12
to 12
touch 12
it 12
a 12
cool 12
glass 12
of 12
fresh 12
milk 12
and 12
a 12
few 12
apples 12
and 12
pears 12
laid 12
at 12
the 12
foot 12
of 12
the 12
steps 12
this 12
was 12
all 12
he 12
wanted 12
now 12
some 12
sign 12
that 12
the 12
immense 12
world 12
would 12
accept 12
him 12
and 12
give 12
him 12
the 12
long 12
time 12
needed 12
to 12
think 12
all 12
the 12
things 12
that 12
must 12
be 12
thought 12
a 12
glass 12
of 12
milk 12
an 12
apple 12
a 12
pear 12
he 12
stepped 12
from 12
the 12
river 12
the 12
land 12
rushed 12
at 12
him 12
a 12
tidal 12
wave 12
he 12
was 12
crushed 12
by 12
darkness 12
and 12
the 12
look 12
of 12
the 12
country 12
and 12
the 12
million 12
odours 12
on 12
a 12
wind 12
that 12
iced 12
his 12
body 12
he 12
fell 12
back 12
under 12
the 12
breaking 12
curve 12
of 12
darkness 12
and 12
sound 12
and 12
smell 12
his 12
ears 12
roaring 12
he 12
whirled 12
the 12
stars 12
poured 12
over 12
his 12
sight 12
like 12
flaming 12
meteors 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
plunge 12
in 12
the 12
river 12
again 12
and 12
let 12
it 12
idle 12
him 12
safely 12
on 12
down 12
somewhere 12
this 12
dark 12
land 12
rising 12
was 12
like 12
that 12
day 12
in 12
his 12
childhood 12
swimming 12
when 12
from 12
nowhere 12
the 12
largest 12
wave 12
in 12
the 12
history 12
of 12
remembering 12
slammed 12
him 12
down 12
in 12
salt 12
mud 12
and 12
green 12
darkness 12
water 12
burning 12
mouth 12
and 12
nose 12
retching 12
his 12
stomach 12
screaming 12
too 12
much 12
water 12
too 12
much 12
land 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
black 12
wall 12
before 12
him 12
a 12
whisper 12
a 12
shape 12
in 12
the 12
shape 12
two 12
eyes 12
the 12
night 12
looking 12
at 12
him 12
the 12
forest 12
seeing 12
him 12
the 12
hound 12
after 12
all 12
the 12
running 12
and 12
rushing 12
and 12
sweating 12
it 12
out 12
and 12
halfdrowning 12
to 12
come 12
this 12
far 12
work 12
this 12
hard 12
and 12
think 12
yourself 12
safe 12
and 12
sigh 12
with 12
relief 12
and 12
come 12
out 12
on 12
the 12
land 12
at 12
last 12
only 12
to 12
find 12
the 12
hound 12
montag 12
gave 12
one 12
last 12
agonized 12
shout 12
as 12
if 12
this 12
were 12
too 12
much 12
for 12
any 12
man 12
the 12
shape 12
exploded 12
away 12
the 12
eyes 12
vanished 12
the 12
leafpiles 12
flew 12
up 12
in 12
a 12
dry 12
shower 12
montag 12
was 12
alone 12
in 12
the 12
wilderness 12
a 12
deer 12
he 12
smelled 12
the 12
heavy 12
musklike 12
perfume 12
mingled 12
with 12
blood 12
and 12
the 12
gummed 12
exhalation 12
of 12
the 12
animals 12
breath 12
all 12
cardamon 12
and 12
moss 12
and 12
ragweed 12
odour 12
in 12
this 12
huge 12
night 12
where 12
the 12
trees 12
ran 12
at 12
him 12
pulled 12
away 12
ran 12
pulled 12
away 12
to 12
the 12
pulse 12
of 12
the 12
heart 12
behind 12
his 12
eyes 12
there 12
must 12
have 12
been 12
a 12
billion 12
leaves 12
on 12
the 12
land 12
he 12
waded 12
in 12
them 12
a 12
dry 12
river 12
smelling 12
of 12
hot 12
cloves 12
and 12
warm 12
dust 12
and 12
the 12
other 12
smells 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
smell 12
like 12
a 12
cut 12
potato 12
from 12
all 12
the 12
land 12
raw 12
and 12
cold 12
and 12
white 12
from 12
having 12
the 12
moon 12
on 12
it 12
most 12
of 12
the 12
night 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
smell 12
like 12
pickles 12
from 12
a 12
bottle 12
and 12
a 12
smell 12
like 12
parsley 12
on 12
the 12
table 12
at 12
home 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
faint 12
yellow 12
odour 12
like 12
mustard 12
from 12
a 12
jar 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
smell 12
like 12
carnations 12
from 12
the 12
yard 12
next 12
door 12
he 12
put 12
down 12
his 12
hand 12
and 12
felt 12
a 12
weed 12
rise 12
up 12
like 12
a 12
child 12
brushing 12
him 12
his 12
fingers 12
smelled 12
of 12
liquorice 12
he 12
stood 12
breathing 12
and 12
the 12
more 12
he 12
breathed 12
the 12
land 12
in 12
the 12
more 12
he 12
was 12
filled 12
up 12
with 12
all 12
the 12
details 12
of 12
the 12
land 12
he 12
was 12
not 12
empty 12
there 12
was 12
more 12
than 12
enough 12
here 12
to 12
fill 12
him 12
there 12
would 12
always 12
be 12
more 12
than 12
enough 12
he 12
walked 12
in 12
the 12
shallow 12
tide 12
of 12
leaves 12
stumbling 12
and 12
in 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
the 12
strangeness 12
a 12
familiarity 12
his 12
foot 12
hit 12
something 12
that 12
rang 12
dully 12
he 12
moved 12
his 12
hand 12
on 12
the 12
ground 12
a 12
yard 12
this 12
way 12
a 12
yard 12
that 12
the 12
railroad 12
track 12
the 12
track 12
that 12
came 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
city 12
and 12
rusted 12
across 12
the 12
land 12
through 12
forests 12
and 12
woods 12
deserted 12
now 12
by 12
the 12
river 12
here 12
was 12
the 12
path 12
to 12
wherever 12
he 12
was 12
going 12
here 12
was 12
the 12
single 12
familiar 12
thing 12
the 12
magic 12
charm 12
he 12
might 12
need 12
a 12
little 12
while 12
to 12
touch 12
to 12
feel 12
beneath 12
his 12
feet 12
as 12
he 12
moved 12
on 12
into 12
the 12
bramble 12
bushes 12
and 12
the 12
lakes 12
of 12
smelling 12
and 12
feeling 12
and 12
touching 12
among 12
the 12
whispers 12
and 12
the 12
blowing 12
down 12
of 12
leaves 12
he 12
walked 12
on 12
the 12
track 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
surprised 12
to 12
learn 12
how 12
certain 12
he 12
suddenly 12
was 12
of 12
a 12
single 12
fact 12
he 12
could 12
not 12
prove 12
once 12
long 12
ago 12
clarisse 12
had 12
walked 12
here 12
where 12
he 12
was 12
walking 12
now 12
half 12
an 12
hour 12
later 12
cold 12
and 12
moving 12
carefully 12
on 12
the 12
tracks 12
fully 12
aware 12
of 12
his 12
entire 12
body 12
his 12
face 12
his 12
mouth 12
his 12
eyes 12
stuffed 12
with 12
blackness 12
his 12
ears 12
stuffed 12
with 12
sound 12
his 12
legs 12
prickled 12
with 12
burrs 12
and 12
nettles 12
he 12
saw 12
the 12
fire 12
ahead 12
the 12
fire 12
was 12
gone 12
then 12
back 12
again 12
like 12
a 12
winking 12
eye 12
he 12
stopped 12
afraid 12
he 12
might 12
blow 12
the 12
fire 12
out 12
with 12
a 12
single 12
breath 12
but 12
the 12
fire 12
was 12
there 12
and 12
he 12
approached 12
warily 12
from 12
a 12
long 12
way 12
off 12
it 12
took 12
the 12
better 12
part 12
of 12
fifteen 12
minutes 12
before 12
he 12
drew 12
very 12
close 12
indeed 12
to 12
it 12
and 12
then 12
he 12
stood 12
looking 12
at 12
it 12
from 12
cover 12
that 12
small 12
motion 12
the 12
white 12
and 12
red 12
colour 12
a 12
strange 12
fire 12
because 12
it 12
meant 12
a 12
different 12
thing 12
to 12
him 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
burning 12
it 12
was 12
warming 12
he 12
saw 12
many 12
hands 12
held 12
to 12
its 12
warmth 12
hands 12
without 12
arms 12
hidden 12
in 12
darkness 12
above 12
the 12
hands 12
motionless 12
faces 12
that 12
were 12
only 12
moved 12
and 12
tossed 12
and 12
flickered 12
with 12
firelight 12
he 12
hadnt 12
known 12
fire 12
could 12
look 12
this 12
way 12
he 12
had 12
never 12
thought 12
in 12
his 12
life 12
that 12
it 12
could 12
give 12
as 12
well 12
as 12
take 12
even 12
its 12
smell 12
was 12
different 12
how 12
long 12
he 12
stood 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
know 12
but 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
foolish 12
and 12
yet 12
delicious 12
sense 12
of 12
knowing 12
himself 12
as 12
an 12
animal 12
come 12
from 12
the 12
forest 12
drawn 12
by 12
the 12
fire 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
thing 12
of 12
brush 12
and 12
liquid 12
eye 12
of 12
fur 12
and 12
muzzle 12
and 12
hoof 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
thing 12
of 12
horn 12
and 12
blood 12
that 12
would 12
smell 12
like 12
autumn 12
if 12
you 12
bled 12
it 12
out 12
on 12
the 12
ground 12
he 12
stood 12
a 12
long 12
long 12
time 12
listening 12
to 12
the 12
warm 12
crackle 12
of 12
the 12
flames 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
silence 12
gathered 12
all 12
about 12
that 12
fire 12
and 12
the 12
silence 12
was 12
in 12
the 12
mens 12
faces 12
and 12
time 12
was 12
there 12
time 12
enough 12
to 12
sit 12
by 12
this 12
rusting 12
track 12
under 12
the 12
trees 12
and 12
look 12
at 12
the 12
world 12
and 12
turn 12
it 12
over 12
with 12
the 12
eyes 12
as 12
if 12
it 12
were 12
held 12
to 12
the 12
centre 12
of 12
the 12
bonfire 12
a 12
piece 12
of 12
steel 12
these 12
men 12
were 12
all 12
shaping 12
it 12
was 12
not 12
only 12
the 12
fire 12
that 12
was 12
different 12
it 12
was 12
the 12
silence 12
montag 12
moved 12
toward 12
this 12
special 12
silence 12
that 12
was 12
concerned 12
with 12
all 12
of 12
the 12
world 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
voices 12
began 12
and 12
they 12
were 12
talking 12
and 12
he 12
could 12
hear 12
nothing 12
of 12
what 12
the 12
voices 12
said 12
but 12
the 12
sound 12
rose 12
and 12
fell 12
quietly 12
and 12
the 12
voices 12
were 12
turning 12
the 12
world 12
over 12
and 12
looking 12
at 12
it 12
the 12
voices 12
knew 12
the 12
land 12
and 12
the 12
trees 12
and 12
the 12
city 12
which 12
lay 12
down 12
the 12
track 12
by 12
the 12
river 12
the 12
voices 12
talked 12
of 12
everything 12
there 12
was 12
nothing 12
they 12
could 12
not 12
talk 12
about 12
he 12
knew 12
from 12
the 12
very 12
cadence 12
and 12
motion 12
and 12
continual 12
stir 12
of 12
curiosity 12
and 12
wonder 12
in 12
them 12
and 12
then 12
one 12
of 12
the 12
men 12
looked 12
up 12
and 12
saw 12
him 12
for 12
the 12
first 12
or 12
perhaps 12
the 12
seventh 12
time 12
and 12
a 12
voice 12
called 12
to 12
montag 12
all 12
right 12
you 12
can 12
come 12
out 12
now 12
montag 12
stepped 12
back 12
into 12
the 12
shadows 12
its 12
all 12
right 12
the 12
voice 12
said 12
youre 12
welcome 12
here 12
montag 12
walked 12
slowly 12
toward 12
the 12
fire 12
and 12
the 12
five 12
old 12
men 12
sitting 12
there 12
dressed 12
in 12
dark 12
blue 12
denim 12
pants 12
and 12
jackets 12
and 12
dark 12
blue 12
suits 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
know 12
what 12
to 12
say 12
to 12
them 12
sit 12
down 12
said 12
the 12
man 12
who 12
seemed 12
to 12
be 12
the 12
leader 12
of 12
the 12
small 12
group 12
have 12
some 12
coffee 12
he 12
watched 12
the 12
dark 12
steaming 12
mixture 12
pour 12
into 12
a 12
collapsible 12
tin 12
cup 12
which 12
was 12
handed 12
him 12
straight 12
off 12
he 12
sipped 12
it 12
gingerly 12
and 12
felt 12
them 12
looking 12
at 12
him 12
with 12
curiosity 12
his 12
lips 12
were 12
scalded 12
but 12
that 12
was 12
good 12
the 12
faces 12
around 12
him 12
were 12
bearded 12
but 12
the 12
beards 12
were 12
clean 12
neat 12
and 12
their 12
hands 12
were 12
clean 12
they 12
had 12
stood 12
up 12
as 12
if 12
to 12
welcome 12
a 12
guest 12
and 12
now 12
they 12
sat 12
down 12
again 12
montag 12
sipped 12
thanks 12
he 12
said 12

very 12
much 12

welcome 12
montag 12
my 12
names 12
granger 12
he 12
held 12
out 12
a 12
small 12
bottle 12
of 12
colourless 12
fluid 12
drink 12
this 12
too 12
itll 12
change 12
the 12
chemical 12
index 12
of 12
your 12
perspiration 12
half 12
an 12
hour 12
from 12
now 12
youll 12
smell 12
like 12
two 12
other 12
people 12
with 12
the 12
hound 12
after 12
you 12
the 12
best 12
thing 12
is 12
bottoms 12
up 12
montag 12
drank 12
the 12
bitter 12
fluid 12
youll 12
stink 12
like 12
a 12
bobcat 12
but 12
thats 12
all 12
right 12
said 12
granger 12
you 12
know 12
my 12
name 12
said 12
montag 12
granger 12
nodded 12
to 12
a 12
portable 12
battery 12
tv 12
set 12
by 12
the 12
fire 12
weve 12
watched 12
the 12
chase 12
figured 12
youd 12
wind 12
up 12
south 12
along 12
the 12
river 12
when 12
we 12
heard 12
you 12
plunging 12
around 12
out 12
in 12
the 12
forest 12
like 12
a 12
drunken 12
elk 12
we 12
didnt 12
hide 12
as 12
we 12
usually 12
do 12
we 12
figured 12
you 12
were 12
in 12
the 12
river 12
when 12
the 12
helicopter 12
cameras 12
swung 12
back 12
in 12
over 12
the 12
city 12
something 12
funny 12
there 12
the 12
chase 12
is 12
still 12
running 12
the 12
other 12
way 12
though 12
the 12
other 12
way 12
lets 12
have 12
a 12
look 12
granger 12
snapped 12
the 12
portable 12
viewer 12
on 12
the 12
picture 12
was 12
a 12
nightmare 12
condensed 12
easily 12
passed 12
from 12
hand 12
to 12
hand 12
in 12
the 12
forest 12
all 12
whirring 12
colour 12
and 12
flight 12
a 12
voice 12
cried 12
the 12
chase 12
continues 12
north 12
in 12
the 12
city 12
police 12
helicopters 12
are 12
converging 12
on 12
avenue 12
and 12
elm 12
grove 12
park 12
granger 12
nodded 12
theyre 12
faking 12
you 12
threw 12
them 12
off 12
at 12
the 12
river 12
they 12
cant 12
admit 12
it 12
they 12
know 12
they 12
can 12
hold 12
their 12
audience 12
only 12
so 12
long 12
the 12
shows 12
got 12
to 12
have 12
a 12
snap 12
ending 12
quick 12
if 12
they 12
started 12
searching 12
the 12
whole 12
damn 12
river 12
it 12
might 12
take 12
all 12
night 12
so 12
theyre 12
sniffing 12
for 12
a 12
scapegoat 12
to 12
end 12
things 12
with 12
a 12
bang 12
watch 12
theyll 12
catch 12
montag 12
in 12
the 12
next 12
five 12
minutes 12
but 12
how 12
watch 12
the 12
camera 12
hovering 12
in 12
the 12
belly 12
of 12
a 12
helicopter 12
now 12
swung 12
down 12
at 12
an 12
empty 12
street 12
see 12
that 12
whispered 12
granger 12
itll 12
be 12
you 12
right 12
up 12
at 12
the 12
end 12
of 12
that 12
street 12
is 12
our 12
victim 12
see 12
how 12
our 12
camera 12
is 12
coming 12
in 12
building 12
the 12
scene 12
suspense 12
long 12
shot 12
right 12
now 12
some 12
poor 12
fellow 12
is 12
out 12
for 12
a 12
walk 12
a 12
rarity 12
an 12
odd 12
one 12
dont 12
think 12
the 12
police 12
dont 12
know 12
the 12
habits 12
of 12
queer 12
ducks 12
like 12
that 12
men 12
who 12
walk 12
mornings 12
for 12
the 12
hell 12
of 12
it 12
or 12
for 12
reasons 12
of 12
insomnia 12
anyway 12
the 12
police 12
have 12
had 12
him 12
charted 12
for 12
months 12
years 12
never 12
know 12
when 12
that 12
sort 12
of 12
information 12
might 12
be 12
handy 12
and 12
today 12
it 12
turns 12
out 12
its 12
very 12
usable 12
indeed 12
it 12
saves 12
face 12
oh 12
god 12
look 12
there 12
the 12
men 12
at 12
the 12
fire 12
bent 12
forward 12
on 12
the 12
screen 12
a 12
man 12
turned 12
a 12
corner 12
the 12
mechanical 12
hound 12
rushed 12
forward 12
into 12
the 12
viewer 12
suddenly 12
the 12
helicopter 12
light 12
shot 12
down 12
a 12
dozen 12
brilliant 12
pillars 12
that 12
built 12
a 12
cage 12
all 12
about 12
the 12
man 12
a 12
voice 12
cried 12
theres 12
montag 12
the 12
search 12
is 12
done 12
the 12
innocent 12
man 12
stood 12
bewildered 12
a 12
cigarette 12
burning 12
in 12
his 12
hand 12
he 12
stared 12
at 12
the 12
hound 12
not 12
knowing 12
what 12
it 12
was 12
he 12
probably 12
never 12
knew 12
he 12
glanced 12
up 12
at 12
the 12
sky 12
and 12
the 12
wailing 12
sirens 12
the 12
cameras 12
rushed 12
down 12
the 12
hound 12
leapt 12
up 12
into 12
the 12
air 12
with 12
a 12
rhythm 12
and 12
a 12
sense 12
of 12
timing 12
that 12
was 12
incredibly 12
beautiful 12
its 12
needle 12
shot 12
out 12
it 12
was 12
suspended 12
for 12
a 12
moment 12
in 12
their 12
gaze 12
as 12
if 12
to 12
give 12
the 12
vast 12
audience 12
time 12
to 12
appreciate 12
everything 12
the 12
raw 12
look 12
of 12
the 12
victims 12
face 12
the 12
empty 12
street 12
the 12
steel 12

a 12
bullet 12
nosing 12
the 12
target 12
montag 12
dont 12

said 12
a 12
voice 12
from 12
the 12
sky 12
the 12
camera 12
fell 12
upon 12
the 12
victim 12
even 12
as 12
did 12
the 12
hound 12
both 12
reached 12
him 12
simultaneously 12
the 12
victim 12
was 12
seized 12
by 12
hound 12
and 12
camera 12
in 12
a 12
great 12
spidering 12
clenching 12

out 12
in 12
the 12
silence 12
and 12
turned 12
away 12
silence 12
and 12
then 12
after 12
a 12
time 12
of 12
the 12
men 12
sitting 12
around 12
the 12
fire 12
their 12
faces 12
expressionless 12
an 12
announcer 12
on 12

to 12
bury 12
the 12
film 12
and 12
come 12
back 12
later 12
always 12
the 12
chance 12
of 12
discovery 12
better 12
to 12
keep 12
it 12
in 12
the 12
old 12
heads 12
where 12
no 12
one 12
can 12
see 12
it 12
or 12
suspect 12
it 12
we 12
are 12
all 12
bits 12
and 12
pieces 12
of 12
history 12
and 12
literature 12

tom 12
paine 12
machiavelli 12

christ 12
its 12
here 12
and 12
the 12
hour 12
is 12
late 12
and 12
the 12
wars 12
begun 12
and 12
we 12
are 12
out 12
here 12
and 12
the 12
city 12
is 12
there 12
all 12
wrapped 12
up 12
in 12
its 12
own 12
coat 12
of 12
a 12
thousand 12
colours 12
what 12
do 12
you 12
think 12
montag 12
i 12
think 12
i 12
was 12
blind 12
trying 12
to 12
do 12
things 12
my 12
way 12
planting 12
books 12
in 12
firemens 12
houses 12
and 12
sending 12
in 12
alarms 12
you 12
did 12
what 12
you 12
had 12
to 12
do 12
carried 12
out 12
on 12
a 12
national 12
scale 12
it 12
might 12
have 12
worked 12
beautifully 12
but 12
our 12
way 12
is 12
simpler 12
and 12
we 12
think 12
better 12
all 12
we 12
want 12
to 12
do 12
is 12
keep 12
the 12
knowledge 12
we 12
think 12
we 12
will 12
need 12
intact 12
and 12
safe 12
were 12
not 12
out 12
to 12
incite 12
or 12
anger 12
anyone 12
yet 12
for 12
if 12
we 12
are 12
destroyed 12
the 12
knowledge 12
is 12
dead 12
perhaps 12
for 12
good 12
we 12
are 12
model 12
citizens 12
in 12
our 12
own 12
special 12
way 12
we 12
walk 12
the 12
old 12
tracks 12
we 12
lie 12
in 12
the 12
hills 12
at 12
night 12
and 12
the 12
city 12
people 12
let 12
us 12
be 12
were 12
stopped 12
and 12
searched 12
occasionally 12
but 12
theres 12
nothing 12
on 12
our 12
persons 12
to 12
incriminate 12
us 12
the 12
organization 12
is 12
flexible 12
very 12
loose 12
and 12
fragmentary 12
some 12
of 12
us 12
have 12
had 12
plastic 12
surgery 12
on 12
our 12
faces 12
and 12
fingerprints 12
right 12
now 12
we 12
have 12
a 12
horrible 12
job 12
were 12
waiting 12
for 12
the 12
war 12
to 12
begin 12
and 12
as 12
quickly 12
end 12
its 12
not 12
pleasant 12
but 12
then 12
were 12
not 12
in 12
control 12
were 12
the 12
odd 12
minority 12
crying 12
in 12
the 12
wilderness 12
when 12
the 12
wars 12
over 12
perhaps 12
we 12
can 12
be 12
of 12
some 12
use 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
do 12
you 12
really 12
think 12
theyll 12
listen 12
then 12
if 12
not 12
well 12
just 12
have 12
to 12
wait 12
well 12
pass 12
the 12
books 12
on 12
to 12
our 12
children 12
by 12
word 12
of 12
mouth 12
and 12
let 12
our 12
children 12
wait 12
in 12
turn 12
on 12
the 12
other 12
people 12
a 12
lot 12
will 12
be 12
lost 12
that 12
way 12
of 12
course 12
but 12
you 12
cant 12
make 12
people 12
listen 12
they 12
have 12
to 12
come 12
round 12
in 12
their 12
own 12
time 12
wondering 12
what 12
happened 12
and 12
why 12
the 12
world 12
blew 12
up 12
under 12
them 12
it 12
cant 12
last 12
how 12
many 12
of 12
you 12
are 12
there 12
thousands 12
on 12
the 12
roads 12
the 12
abandoned 12
railtracks 12
tonight 12
burns 12
on 12
the 12
outside 12
libraries 12
inside 12
it 12
wasnt 12
planned 12
at 12
first 12
each 12
man 12
had 12
a 12
book 12
he 12
wanted 12
to 12
remember 12
and 12
did 12
then 12
over 12
a 12
period 12
of 12
twenty 12
years 12
or 12
so 12
we 12
met 12
each 12
other 12
travelling 12
and 12
got 12
the 12
loose 12
network 12
together 12
and 12
set 12
out 12
a 12
plan 12
the 12
most 12
important 12
single 12
thing 12
we 12
had 12
to 12
pound 12
into 12
ourselves 12
was 12
that 12
we 12
were 12
not 12
important 12
we 12
mustnt 12
be 12
pedants 12
we 12
were 12
not 12
to 12
feel 12
superior 12
to 12
anyone 12
else 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
were 12
nothing 12
more 12
than 12
dustjackets 12
for 12
books 12
of 12
no 12
significance 12

pick 12
up 12
that 12
town 12
almost 12
and 12
flip 12
the 12
pages 12
so 12
many 12
pages 12
to 12
a 12
person 12
and 12
when 12
the 12
wars 12
over 12
some 12
day 12
some 12
year 12
the 12
books 12
can 12
be 12
written 12
again 12
the 12
people 12
will 12
be 12
called 12
in 12
one 12
by 12
one 12
to 12
recite 12
what 12
they 12
know 12
and 12
well 12
set 12
it 12
up 12
in 12
type 12
until 12
another 12
dark 12
age 12
when 12
we 12
might 12
have 12
to 12
do 12
the 12
whole 12
damn 12
thing 12
over 12
again 12
but 12
thats 12
the 12
wonderful 12
thing 12
about 12
man 12
he 12
never 12
gets 12
so 12
discouraged 12
or 12
disgusted 12
that 12
he 12
gives 12
up 12
doing 12
it 12
all 12
over 12
again 12
because 12
he 12
knows 12
very 12
well 12
it 12
is 12
important 12
and 12
worth 12
the 12
doing 12
what 12
do 12
we 12
do 12
tonight 12
asked 12
montag 12
wait 12
said 12
granger 12
and 12
move 12
downstream 12
a 12
little 12
way 12
just 12
in 12
case 12
he 12
began 12
throwing 12
dust 12
and 12
dirt 12
on 12
the 12
fire 12
the 12
other 12
men 12
helped 12
and 12
montag 12
helped 12
and 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
wilderness 12
the 12
men 12
all 12
moved 12
their 12
hands 12
putting 12
out 12
the 12
fire 12
together 12
they 12
stood 12
by 12
the 12
river 12
in 12
the 12
starlight 12
montag 12
saw 12
the 12
luminous 12
dial 12
of 12
his 12
waterproof 12
five 12
five 12
oclock 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
another 12
year 12
ticked 12
by 12
in 12
a 12
single 12
hour 12
and 12
dawn 12
waiting 12
beyond 12
the 12
far 12
bank 12
of 12
the 12
river 12
why 12
do 12
you 12
trust 12
me 12
said 12
montag 12
a 12
man 12
moved 12
in 12
the 12
darkness 12
the 12
look 12
of 12
yous 12
enough 12
you 12
havent 12
seen 12
yourself 12
in 12
a 12
mirror 12
lately 12
beyond 12
that 12
the 12
city 12
has 12
never 12
cared 12
so 12
much 12
about 12
us 12
to 12
bother 12
with 12
an 12
elaborate 12
chase 12
like 12
this 12
to 12
find 12
us 12
a 12
few 12
crackpots 12
with 12
verses 12
in 12
their 12
heads 12
cant 12
touch 12
them 12
and 12
they 12
know 12
it 12
and 12
we 12
know 12
it 12
everyone 12
knows 12
it 12
so 12
long 12
as 12
the 12
vast 12
population 12
doesnt 12
wander 12
about 12
quoting 12
the 12
magna 12
charta 12
and 12
the 12
constitution 12
its 12
all 12
right 12
the 12
firemen 12
were 12
enough 12
to 12
check 12
that 12
now 12
and 12
then 12
no 12
the 12
cities 12
dont 12
bother 12
us 12
and 12
you 12
look 12
like 12
hell 12
they 12
moved 12
along 12
the 12
bank 12
of 12
the 12
river 12
going 12
south 12
montag 12
tried 12
to 12
see 12
the 12
mens 12
faces 12
the 12
old 12
faces 12
he 12
remembered 12
from 12
the 12
firelight 12
lined 12
and 12
tired 12
he 12
was 12
looking 12
for 12
a 12
brightness 12
a 12
resolve 12
a 12
triumph 12
over 12
tomorrow 12
that 12
hardly 12
seemed 12
to 12
be 12
there 12
perhaps 12
he 12
had 12
expected 12
their 12
faces 12
to 12
burn 12
and 12
glitter 12
with 12
the 12
knowledge 12
they 12
carried 12
to 12
glow 12
as 12
lanterns 12
glow 12
with 12
the 12
light 12
in 12
them 12
but 12
all 12
the 12
light 12
had 12
come 12
from 12
the 12
camp 12
fire 12
and 12
these 12
men 12
had 12
seemed 12
no 12
different 12
from 12
any 12
others 12
who 12
had 12
run 12
a 12
long 12
race 12
searched 12
a 12
long 12
search 12
seen 12
good 12
things 12
destroyed 12
and 12
now 12
very 12
late 12
were 12
gathering 12
to 12
wait 12
for 12
the 12
end 12
of 12
the 12
party 12
and 12
the 12
blowing 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
lamps 12
they 12
werent 12
at 12
all 12
certain 12
that 12
the 12
things 12
they 12
carried 12
in 12
their 12
heads 12
might 12
make 12
every 12
future 12
dawn 12
glow 12
with 12
a 12
purer 12
light 12
they 12
were 12
sure 12
of 12
nothing 12
save 12
that 12
the 12
books 12
were 12
on 12
file 12
behind 12
their 12
quiet 12
eyes 12
the 12
books 12
were 12
waiting 12
with 12
their 12
pages 12
uncut 12
for 12
the 12
customers 12
who 12
might 12
come 12
by 12
in 12
later 12
years 12
some 12
with 12
clean 12
and 12
some 12
with 12
dirty 12
fingers 12
montag 12
squinted 12
from 12
one 12
face 12
to 12
another 12
as 12
they 12
walked 12
dont 12
judge 12
a 12
book 12
by 12
its 12
cover 12
someone 12
said 12
and 12
they 12
all 12
laughed 12
quietly 12
moving 12
downstream 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
shriek 12
and 12
the 12
jets 12
from 12
the 12
city 12
were 12
gone 12
overhead 12
long 12
before 12
the 12
men 12
looked 12
up 12
montag 12
stared 12
back 12
at 12
the 12
city 12
far 12
down 12
the 12
river 12
only 12
a 12
faint 12
glow 12
now 12
my 12
wifes 12
back 12
there 12
im 12
sorry 12
to 12
hear 12
that 12
the 12
cities 12
wont 12
do 12
well 12
in 12
the 12
next 12
few 12
days 12

granger 12
its 12
strange 12
i 12

montag 12
even 12

a 12
moment 12

feel 12
sad 12

with 12

said 12
granger 12
taking 12
his 12
arm 12
and 12
walking 12
with 12
him 12
holding 12
aside 12
the 12
bushes 12
to 12
let 12
him 12
pass 12
when 12
i 12
was 12
a 12
boy 12
my 12
grandfather 12
died 12
and 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
sculptor 12
he 12
was 12
also 12
a 12
very 12
kind 12
man 12
who 12
had 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
love 12
to 12
give 12
the 12
world 12
and 12
he 12
helped 12
clean 12
up 12
the 12
slum 12
in 12
our 12
town 12
and 12
he 12
made 12
toys 12
for 12
us 12
and 12
he 12
did 12
a 12
million 12
things 12
in 12
his 12
lifetime 12
he 12
was 12
always 12
busy 12
with 12
his 12
hands 12
and 12
when 12
he 12
died 12
i 12
suddenly 12
realized 12
i 12
wasnt 12
crying 12
for 12
him 12
at 12
all 12
but 12
for 12
the 12
things 12
he 12
did 12
i 12
cried 12
because 12
he 12
would 12
never 12
do 12
them 12
again 12
he 12
would 12
never 12
carve 12
another 12
piece 12
of 12
wood 12
or 12
help 12
us 12
raise 12
doves 12
and 12
pigeons 12
in 12
the 12
back 12
yard 12
or 12
play 12
the 12
violin 12
the 12
way 12
he 12
did 12
or 12
tell 12
us 12
jokes 12
the 12
way 12
he 12
did 12
he 12
was 12
part 12
of 12
us 12
and 12
when 12
he 12
died 12
all 12
the 12
actions 12
stopped 12
dead 12
and 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
one 12
to 12
do 12
them 12
just 12
the 12
way 12
he 12
did 12
he 12
was 12
individual 12
he 12
was 12
an 12
important 12
man 12
ive 12
never 12
gotten 12
over 12
his 12
death 12
often 12
i 12
think 12
what 12
wonderful 12
carvings 12
never 12
came 12
to 12
birth 12
because 12
he 12
died 12
how 12
many 12
jokes 12
are 12
missing 12
from 12
the 12
world 12
and 12
how 12
many 12
homing 12
pigeons 12
untouched 12
by 12
his 12
hands 12
he 12
shaped 12
the 12
world 12
he 12
did 12
things 12
to 12
the 12
world 12
the 12
world 12
was 12
bankrupted 12
of 12
ten 12
million 12
fine 12
actions 12
the 12
night 12
he 12
passed 12
on 12
montag 12
walked 12
in 12
silence 12
millie 12
millie 12
he 12
whispered 12
millie 12
what 12
my 12
wife 12
my 12
wife 12
poor 12
millie 12
poor 12
millie 12
i 12
cant 12
remember 12
anything 12
i 12
think 12
of 12
her 12
hands 12
but 12
i 12
dont 12
see 12
them 12
doing 12
anything 12
at 12
all 12
they 12
just 12
hang 12
there 12
at 12
her 12
sides 12
or 12
they 12
lie 12
there 12
on 12
her 12
lap 12
or 12
theres 12
a 12
cigarette 12
in 12
them 12
but 12
thats 12
all 12
montag 12
turned 12
and 12
glanced 12
back 12
what 12
did 12
you 12
give 12
to 12
the 12
city 12
montag 12
ashes 12
what 12
did 12
the 12
others 12
give 12
to 12
each 12
other 12
nothingness 12
granger 12
stood 12
looking 12
back 12
with 12
montag 12
everyone 12
must 12
leave 12
something 12
behind 12
when 12
he 12
dies 12
my 12
grandfather 12
said 12
a 12
child 12
or 12
a 12
book 12
or 12
a 12
painting 12
or 12
a 12
house 12
or 12
a 12
wall 12
built 12
or 12
a 12
pair 12
of 12
shoes 12
made 12
or 12
a 12
garden 12
planted 12
something 12
your 12
hand 12
touched 12
some 12
way 12
so 12
your 12
soul 12
has 12
somewhere 12
to 12
go 12
when 12
you 12
die 12
and 12
when 12
people 12
look 12
at 12
that 12
tree 12
or 12
that 12
flower 12
you 12
planted 12
youre 12
there 12
it 12
doesnt 12
matter 12
what 12
you 12
do 12
he 12
said 12
so 12
long 12
as 12
you 12
change 12
something 12
from 12
the 12
way 12
it 12
was 12
before 12
you 12
touched 12
it 12
into 12
something 12
thats 12
like 12
you 12
after 12
you 12
take 12
your 12
hands 12
away 12
the 12
difference 12
between 12
the 12
man 12
who 12
just 12
cuts 12
lawns 12
and 12
a 12
real 12
gardener 12
is 12
in 12
the 12
touching 12
he 12
said 12
the 12
lawncutter 12
might 12
just 12
as 12
well 12
not 12
have 12
been 12
there 12
at 12
all 12
the 12
gardener 12
will 12
be 12
there 12
a 12
lifetime 12
granger 12
moved 12
his 12
hand 12
my 12
grandfather 12
showed 12
me 12
some 12
v 12
rocket 12
films 12
once 12
fifty 12
years 12
ago 12
have 12
you 12
ever 12
seen 12
the 12
atombomb 12
mushroom 12
from 12
two 12
hundred 12
miles 12
up 12
its 12
a 12
pinprick 12
its 12
nothing 12
with 12
the 12
wilderness 12
all 12
around 12
it 12
my 12
grandfather 12
ran 12
off 12
the 12
v 12
rocket 12
film 12
a 12
dozen 12
times 12
and 12
then 12
hoped 12
that 12
some 12
day 12
our 12
cities 12
would 12
open 12
up 12
and 12
let 12
the 12
green 12
and 12
the 12
land 12
and 12
the 12
wilderness 12
in 12
more 12
to 12
remind 12
people 12
that 12
were 12
allotted 12
a 12
little 12
space 12
on 12
earth 12
and 12
that 12
we 12
survive 12
in 12
that 12
wilderness 12
that 12
can 12
take 12
back 12
what 12
it 12
has 12
given 12
as 12
easily 12
as 12
blowing 12
its 12
breath 12
on 12
us 12
or 12
sending 12
the 12
sea 12
to 12
tell 12
us 12
we 12
are 12
not 12
so 12
big 12
when 12
we 12
forget 12
how 12
close 12
the 12
wilderness 12
is 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
my 12
grandpa 12
said 12
some 12
day 12
it 12
will 12
come 12
in 12
and 12
get 12
us 12
for 12
we 12
will 12
have 12
forgotten 12
how 12
terrible 12
and 12
real 12
it 12
can 12
be 12
you 12
see 12
granger 12
turned 12
to 12
montag 12
grandfathers 12
been 12
dead 12
for 12
all 12
these 12
years 12
but 12
if 12
you 12
lifted 12
my 12
skull 12
by 12
god 12
in 12
the 12
convolutions 12
of 12
my 12
brain 12
youd 12
find 12
the 12
big 12
ridges 12
of 12
his 12
thumbprint 12
he 12
touched 12
me 12
as 12
i 12
said 12
earlier 12
he 12
was 12
a 12
sculptor 12
i 12
hate 12
a 12
roman 12
named 12
status 12
quo 12
he 12
said 12
to 12
me 12
stuff 12
your 12
eyes 12
with 12
wonder 12
he 12
said 12
live 12
as 12
if 12
youd 12
drop 12
dead 12
in 12
ten 12
seconds 12
see 12
the 12
world 12
its 12
more 12
fantastic 12
than 12
any 12
dream 12
made 12
or 12
paid 12
for 12
in 12
factories 12
ask 12
no 12
guarantees 12
ask 12
for 12
no 12
security 12
there 12
never 12
was 12
such 12
an 12
animal 12
and 12
if 12
there 12
were 12
it 12
would 12
be 12
related 12
to 12
the 12
great 12
sloth 12
which 12
hangs 12
upside 12
down 12
in 12
a 12
tree 12
all 12
day 12
every 12
day 12
sleeping 12
its 12
life 12
away 12
to 12
hell 12
with 12
that 12
he 12
said 12
shake 12
the 12
tree 12
and 12
knock 12
the 12
great 12
sloth 12
down 12
on 12
his 12
ass 12
look 12
cried 12
montag 12
and 12
the 12
war 12
began 12
and 12
ended 12
in 12
that 12
instant 12
later 12
the 12
men 12
around 12
montag 12
could 12
not 12
say 12
if 12
they 12
had 12
really 12
seen 12
anything 12
perhaps 12
the 12
merest 12
flourish 12
of 12
light 12
and 12
motion 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
perhaps 12
the 12
bombs 12
were 12
there 12
and 12
the 12
jets 12
ten 12
miles 12
five 12
miles 12
one 12
mile 12
up 12
for 12
the 12
merest 12
instant 12
like 12
grain 12
thrown 12
over 12
the 12
heavens 12
by 12
a 12
great 12
sowing 12
hand 12
and 12
the 12
bombs 12
drifting 12
with 12
dreadful 12
swiftness 12
yet 12
sudden 12
slowness 12
down 12
upon 12
the 12
morning 12
city 12
they 12
had 12
left 12
behind 12
the 12
bombardment 12
was 12
to 12
all 12
intents 12
and 12
purposes 12
finished 12
once 12
the 12
jets 12
had 12
sighted 12
their 12
target 12
alerted 12
their 12
bombardiers 12
at 12
five 12
thousand 12
miles 12
an 12
hour 12
as 12
quick 12
as 12
the 12
whisper 12
of 12
a 12
scythe 12
the 12
war 12
was 12
finished 12
once 12
the 12
bombrelease 12
was 12
yanked 12
it 12
was 12
over 12
now 12
a 12
full 12
three 12
seconds 12
all 12
of 12
the 12
time 12
in 12
history 12
before 12
the 12
bombs 12
struck 12
the 12
enemy 12
ships 12
themselves 12
were 12
gone 12
half 12
around 12
the 12
visible 12
world 12
like 12
bullets 12
in 12
which 12
a 12
savage 12
islander 12
might 12
not 12
believe 12
because 12
they 12
were 12
invisible 12
yet 12
the 12
heart 12
is 12
suddenly 12
shattered 12
the 12
body 12
falls 12
in 12
separate 12
motions 12
and 12
the 12
blood 12
is 12
astonished 12
to 12
be 12
freed 12
on 12
the 12
air 12
the 12
brain 12
squanders 12
its 12
few 12
precious 12
memories 12
and 12
puzzled 12
dies 12
this 12
was 12
not 12
to 12
be 12
believed 12
it 12
was 12
merely 12
a 12
gesture 12
montag 12
saw 12
the 12
flirt 12
of 12
a 12
great 12
metal 12
fist 12
over 12
the 12
far 12
city 12
and 12
he 12
knew 12
the 12
scream 12
of 12
the 12
jets 12
that 12
would 12
follow 12
would 12
say 12
after 12
the 12
deed 12
disintegrate 12
leave 12
no 12
stone 12
on 12
another 12
perish 12
die 12
montag 12
held 12
the 12
bombs 12
in 12
the 12
sky 12
for 12
a 12
single 12
moment 12
with 12
his 12
mind 12
and 12
his 12
hands 12
reaching 12
helplessly 12
up 12
at 12
them 12
run 12
he 12
cried 12
to 12
faber 12
to 12
clarisse 12
run 12
to 12
mildred 12
get 12
out 12
get 12
out 12
of 12
there 12
but 12
clarisse 12
he 12
remembered 12
was 12
dead 12
and 12
faber 12
was 12
out 12
there 12
in 12
the 12
deep 12
valleys 12
of 12
the 12
country 12
somewhere 12
the 12
five 12
am 12
bus 12
was 12
on 12
its 12
way 12
from 12
one 12
desolation 12
to 12
another 12
though 12
the 12
desolation 12
had 12
not 12
yet 12
arrived 12
was 12
still 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
it 12
was 12
certain 12
as 12
man 12
could 12
make 12
it 12
before 12
the 12
bus 12
had 12
run 12
another 12
fifty 12
yards 12
on 12
the 12
highway 12
its 12
destination 12
would 12
be 12
meaningless 12
and 12
its 12
point 12
of 12
departure 12
changed 12
from 12
metropolis 12
to 12
junkyard 12
and 12
mildred 12
get 12
out 12
run 12
he 12
saw 12
her 12
in 12
her 12
hotel 12
room 12
somewhere 12
now 12
in 12
the 12
halfsecond 12
remaining 12
with 12
the 12
bombs 12
a 12
yard 12
a 12
foot 12
an 12
inch 12
from 12
her 12
building 12
he 12
saw 12
her 12
leaning 12
toward 12
the 12
great 12
shimmering 12
walls 12
of 12
colour 12
and 12
motion 12
where 12
the 12
family 12
talked 12
and 12
talked 12
and 12
talked 12
to 12
her 12
where 12
the 12
family 12
prattled 12
and 12
chatted 12
and 12
said 12
her 12
name 12
and 12
smiled 12
at 12
her 12
and 12
said 12
nothing 12
of 12
the 12
bomb 12
that 12
was 12
an 12
inch 12
now 12
a 12
halfinch 12
now 12
a 12
quarterinch 12
from 12
the 12
top 12
of 12
the 12
hotel 12
leaning 12
into 12
the 12
wall 12
as 12
if 12
all 12
of 12
the 12
hunger 12
of 12
looking 12
would 12
find 12
the 12
secret 12
of 12
her 12
sleepless 12
unease 12
there 12
mildred 12
leaning 12
anxiously 12
nervously 12
as 12
if 12
to 12
plunge 12
drop 12
fall 12
into 12
that 12
swarming 12
immensity 12
of 12
colour 12
to 12
drown 12
in 12
its 12
bright 12
happiness 12
the 12
first 12
bomb 12
struck 12
mildred 12
perhaps 12
who 12
would 12
ever 12
know 12
perhaps 12
the 12
great 12
broadcasting 12
stations 12
with 12
their 12
beams 12
of 12
colour 12
and 12
light 12
and 12
talk 12
and 12
chatter 12
went 12
first 12
into 12
oblivion 12
montag 12
falling 12
flat 12
going 12
down 12
saw 12
or 12
felt 12
or 12
imagined 12
he 12
saw 12
or 12
felt 12
the 12
walls 12
go 12
dark 12
in 12
millies 12
face 12
heard 12
her 12
screaming 12
because 12
in 12
the 12
millionth 12
part 12
of 12
time 12
left 12
she 12
saw 12
her 12
own 12
face 12
reflected 12
there 12
in 12
a 12
mirror 12
instead 12
of 12
a 12
crystal 12
ball 12
and 12
it 12
was 12
such 12
a 12
wildly 12
empty 12
face 12
all 12
by 12
itself 12
in 12
the 12
room 12
touching 12
nothing 12
starved 12
and 12
eating 12
of 12
itself 12
that 12
at 12
last 12
she 12
recognized 12
it 12
as 12
her 12
own 12
and 12
looked 12
quickly 12
up 12
at 12
the 12
ceiling 12
as 12
it 12
and 12
the 12
entire 12
structure 12
of 12
the 12
hotel 12
blasted 12
down 12
upon 12
her 12
carrying 12
her 12
with 12
a 12
million 12
pounds 12
of 12
brick 12
metal 12
plaster 12
and 12
wood 12
to 12
meet 12
other 12
people 12
in 12
the 12
hives 12
below 12
all 12
on 12
their 12
quick 12
way 12
down 12
to 12
the 12
cellar 12
where 12
the 12
explosion 12
rid 12
itself 12
of 12
them 12
in 12
its 12
own 12
unreasonable 12
way 12
i 12
remember 12
montag 12
clung 12
to 12
the 12
earth 12
i 12
remember 12
chicago 12
chicago 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
ago 12
millie 12
and 12
i 12
thats 12
where 12
we 12
met 12
i 12
remember 12
now 12
chicago 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
ago 12
the 12
concussion 12
knocked 12
the 12
air 12
across 12
and 12
down 12
the 12
river 12
turned 12
the 12
men 12
over 12
like 12
dominoes 12
in 12
a 12
line 12
blew 12
the 12
water 12
in 12
lifting 12
sprays 12
and 12
blew 12
the 12
dust 12
and 12
made 12
the 12
trees 12
above 12
them 12
mourn 12
with 12
a 12
great 12
wind 12
passing 12
away 12
south 12
montag 12
crushed 12
himself 12
down 12
squeezing 12
himself 12
small 12
eyes 12
tight 12
he 12
blinked 12
once 12
and 12
in 12
that 12
instant 12
saw 12
the 12
city 12
instead 12
of 12
the 12
bombs 12
in 12
the 12
air 12
they 12
had 12
displaced 12
each 12
other 12
for 12
another 12
of 12
those 12
impossible 12
instants 12
the 12
city 12
stood 12
rebuilt 12
and 12
unrecognizable 12
taller 12
than 12
it 12
had 12
ever 12
hoped 12
or 12
strived 12
to 12
be 12
taller 12
than 12
man 12
had 12
built 12
it 12
erected 12
at 12
last 12
in 12
gouts 12
of 12
shattered 12
concrete 12
and 12
sparkles 12
of 12
torn 12
metal 12
into 12
a 12
mural 12
hung 12
like 12
a 12
reversed 12
avalanche 12
a 12
million 12
colours 12
a 12
million 12
oddities 12
a 12
door 12
where 12
a 12
window 12
should 12
be 12
a 12
top 12
for 12
a 12
bottom 12
a 12
side 12
for 12
a 12
back 12
and 12
then 12
the 12
city 12
rolled 12
over 12
and 12
fell 12
down 12
dead 12
montag 12
lying 12
there 12
eyes 12
gritted 12
shut 12
with 12
dust 12
a 12
fine 12
wet 12
cement 12
of 12
dust 12
in 12
his 12
now 12
shut 12
mouth 12
gasping 12
and 12
crying 12
now 12
thought 12
again 12
i 12
remember 12
i 12
remember 12
i 12
remember 12
something 12
else 12
what 12
is 12
it 12
yes 12
yes 12
part 12
of 12
the 12
ecclesiastes 12
and 12
revelation 12
part 12
of 12
that 12
book 12
part 12
of 12
it 12
quick 12
now 12
quick 12
before 12
it 12
gets 12
away 12
before 12
the 12
shock 12
wears 12
off 12
before 12
the 12
wind 12
dies 12
book 12
of 12
ecclesiastes 12
here 12
he 12
said 12
it 12
over 12
to 12
himself 12
silently 12
lying 12
flat 12
to 12
the 12
trembling 12
earth 12
he 12
said 12
the 12
words 12
of 12
it 12
many 12
times 12
and 12
they 12
were 12
perfect 12
without 12
trying 12
and 12
there 12
was 12
no 12
denhams 12
dentifrice 12
anywhere 12
it 12
was 12
just 12
the 12
preacher 12
by 12
himself 12
standing 12
there 12
in 12
his 12
mind 12
looking 12
at 12
him 12
there 12
said 12
a 12
voice 12
the 12
men 12
lay 12
gasping 12
like 12
fish 12
laid 12
out 12
on 12
the 12
grass 12
they 12
held 12
to 12
the 12
earth 12
as 12
children 12
hold 12
to 12
familiar 12
things 12
no 12
matter 12
how 12
cold 12
or 12
dead 12
no 12
matter 12
what 12
has 12
happened 12
or 12
will 12
happen 12
their 12
fingers 12
were 12
clawed 12
into 12
the 12
dirt 12
and 12
they 12
were 12
all 12
shouting 12
to 12
keep 12
their 12
eardrums 12
from 12
bursting 12
to 12
keep 12
their 12
sanity 12
from 12
bursting 12
mouths 12
open 12
montag 12
shouting 12
with 12
them 12
a 12
protest 12
against 12
the 12
wind 12
that 12
ripped 12
their 12
faces 12
and 12
tore 12
at 12
their 12
lips 12
making 12
their 12
noses 12
bleed 12
montag 12
watched 12
the 12
great 12
dust 12
settle 12
and 12
the 12
great 12
silence 12
move 12
down 12
upon 12
their 12
world 12
and 12
lying 12
there 12
it 12
seemed 12
that 12
he 12
saw 12
every 12
single 12
grain 12
of 12
dust 12
and 12
every 12
blade 12
of 12
grass 12
and 12
that 12
he 12
heard 12
every 12
cry 12
and 12
shout 12
and 12
whisper 12
going 12
up 12
in 12
the 12
world 12
now 12
silence 12
fell 12
down 12
in 12
the 12
sifting 12
dust 12
and 12
all 12
the 12
leisure 12
they 12
might 12
need 12
to 12
look 12
around 12
to 12
gather 12
the 12
reality 12
of 12
this 12
day 12
into 12
their 12
senses 12
montag 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
river 12
well 12
go 12
on 12
the 12
river 12
he 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
old 12
railroad 12
tracks 12
or 12
well 12
go 12
that 12
way 12
or 12
well 12
walk 12
on 12
the 12
highways 12
now 12
and 12
well 12
have 12
time 12
to 12
put 12
things 12
into 12
ourselves 12
and 12
some 12
day 12
after 12
it 12
sets 12
in 12
us 12

long 12
time 12

out 12
of 12
our 12
hands 12
and 12
our 12
mouths 12
and 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
it 12
will 12
be 12
wrong 12
but 12
just 12
enough 12
of 12
it 12
will 12
be 12

dusty 12
eyelids 12

breathing 12
fast 12

slower 12
then 12
slow 12
montag 12
sat 12
up 12
he 12
did 12
not 12
move 12
any 12
further 12
however 12
the 12
other 12
men 12
did 12
likewise 12
the 12
sun 12
was 12
touching 12
the 12
black 12
horizon 12
with 12
a 12
faint 12
red 12
tip 12
the 12
air 12
was 12
cold 12
and 12
smelled 12
of 12
a 12
coming 12
rain 12
silently 12
granger 12
arose 12
felt 12
his 12
arms 12
and 12
legs 12
swearing 12
swearing 12
incessantly 12
under 12
his 12
breath 12
tears 12
dripping 12
from 12
his 12
face 12
he 12
shuffled 12
down 12
to 12
the 12
river 12
to 12
look 12
upstream 12
its 12
flat 12
he 12
said 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
later 12
city 12
looks 12
like 12
a 12
heap 12
of 12
bakingpowder 12
its 12
gone 12
and 12
a 12
long 12
time 12
after 12
that 12
i 12
wonder 12
how 12
many 12
knew 12
it 12
was 12
coming 12
i 12
wonder 12
how 12
many 12
were 12
surprised 12
and 12
across 12
the 12
world 12
thought 12
montag 12
how 12
many 12
other 12
cities 12
dead 12
and 12
here 12
in 12
our 12
country 12
how 12
many 12
a 12
hundred 12
a 12
thousand 12
someone 12
struck 12
a 12
match 12
and 12
touched 12
it 12
to 12
a 12
piece 12
of 12
dry 12
paper 12
taken 12
from 12
their 12
pocket 12
and 12
shoved 12
this 12
under 12
a 12
bit 12
of 12
grass 12
and 12
leaves 12
and 12
after 12
a 12
while 12
added 12
tiny 12
twigs 12
which 12
were 12
wet 12
and 12
sputtered 12
but 12
finally 12
caught 12
and 12
the 12
fire 12
grew 12
larger 12
in 12
the 12
early 12
morning 12
as 12
the 12
sun 12
came 12
up 12
and 12
the 12
men 12
slowly 12
turned 12
from 12
looking 12
up 12
river 12
and 12
were 12
drawn 12
to 12
the 12
fire 12
awkwardly 12
with 12
nothing 12
to 12
say 12
and 12
the 12
sun 12
coloured 12
the 12
backs 12
of 12
their 12
necks 12
as 12
they 12
bent 12
down 12
granger 12
unfolded 12
an 12
oilskin 12
with 12
some 12
bacon 12
in 12
it 12
well 12
have 12
a 12
bite 12
then 12
well 12
turn 12
around 12
and 12
walk 12
upstream 12
theyll 12
be 12
needing 12
us 12
up 12
that 12
way 12
someone 12
produced 12
a 12
small 12
fryingpan 12
and 12
the 12
bacon 12
went 12
into 12
it 12
and 12
the 12
fryingpan 12
was 12
set 12
on 12
the 12
fire 12
after 12
a 12
moment 12
the 12
bacon 12
began 12
to 12
flutter 12
and 12
dance 12
in 12
the 12
pan 12
and 12
the 12
sputter 12
of 12
it 12
filled 12
the 12
morning 12
air 12
with 12
its 12
aroma 12
the 12
men 12
watched 12
this 12
ritual 12
silently 12
granger 12
looked 12
into 12
the 12
fire 12
phoenix 12
what 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
silly 12
damn 12
bird 12
called 12
a 12
phoenix 12
back 12
before 12
christ 12
every 12
few 12
hundred 12
years 12
he 12
built 12
a 12
pyre 12
and 12
burned 12
himself 12
up 12
he 12
must 12
have 12
been 12
first 12
cousin 12
to 12
man 12
but 12
every 12
time 12
he 12
burnt 12
himself 12
up 12
he 12
sprang 12
out 12
of 12
the 12
ashes 12
he 12
got 12
himself 12
born 12
all 12
over 12
again 12
and 12
it 12
looks 12
like 12
were 12
doing 12
the 12
same 12
thing 12
over 12
and 12
over 12
but 12
weve 12
got 12
one 12
damn 12
thing 12
the 12
phoenix 12
never 12
had 12
we 12
know 12
the 12
damn 12
silly 12
thing 12
we 12
just 12
did 12
we 12
know 12
all 12
the 12
damn 12
silly 12
things 12
weve 12
done 12
for 12
a 12
thousand 12
years 12
and 12
as 12
long 12
as 12
we 12
know 12
that 12
and 12
always 12
have 12
it 12

jumping 12
into 12
the 12
middle 12
of 12
them 12
we 12
pick 12
up 12
a 12
few 12
more 12
people 12
that 12
remember 12
every 12
generation 12
he 12
took 12
the 12
pan 12
off 12
the 12
fire 12
and 12
let 12
the 12
bacon 12
cool 12
and 12
they 12
ate 12
it 12
slowly 12
thoughtfully 12
now 12
lets 12
get 12
on 12
upstream 12

granger 12
and 12

time 12

a 12
lot 12
of 12
lonely 12
people 12
in 12
the 12
next 12
week 12
and 12
the 12
next 12
month 12
and 12
the 12
next 12
year 12
and 12
when 12
they 12
ask 12

what 12
were 12
doing 12

the 12
long 12

much 12
that 12
well 12
build 12

dig 12
the 12
biggest 12
grave 12
of 12
all 12
time 12

and 12

up 12
come 12
on 12
now 12
were 12
going 12
to 12
go 12
build 12
a 12
mirrorfactory 12
first 12
and 12
put 12
out 12
nothing 12
but 12
mirrors 12
for 12
the 12
next 12
year 12
and 12
take 12
a 12
long 12
look 12
in 12
them 12
they 12
finished 12
eating 12
and 12
put 12
out 12
the 12
fire 12
the 12
day 12
was 12
brightening 12
all 12
about 12
them 12
as 12
if 12
a 12
pink 12
lamp 12
had 12
been 12
given 12
more 12
wick 12
in 12
the 12
trees 12
the 12
birds 12
that 12
had 12
flown 12
away 12
now 12
came 12
back 12
and 12
settled 12
down 12
montag 12
began 12
walking 12
and 12
after 12
a 12
moment 12
found 12
that 12
the 12
others 12
had 12
fallen 12
in 12
behind 12
him 12
going 12
north 12
he 12
was 12
surprised 12
and 12
moved 12
aside 12
to 12
let 12
granger 12
pass 12
but 12
granger 12
looked 12
at 12
him 12
and 12
nodded 12
him 12
on 12
montag 12
went 12
ahead 12
he 12
looked 12
at 12
the 12
river 12
and 12
the 12
sky 12
and 12
the 12
rusting 12
track 12
going 12
back 12
down 12
to 12
where 12
the 12
farms 12
lay 12
where 12
the 12
barns 12
stood 12
full 12
of 12
hay 12
where 12
a 12
lot 12
of 12
people 12
had 12
walked 12
by 12
in 12
the 12
night 12
on 12
their 12
way 12
from 12
the 12
city 12
later 12
in 12
a 12
month 12
or 12
six 12
months 12
and 12
certainly 12
not 12
more 12
than 12
a 12
year 12
he 12
would 12
walk 12
along 12
here 12
again 12
alone 12
and 12
keep 12
right 12
on 12
going 12
until 12
he 12
caught 12
up 12
with 12
the 12
people 12
but 12
now 12
there 12
was 12
a 12
long 12
mornings 12
walk 12
until 12
noon 12
and 12
if 12
the 12
men 12
were 12
silent 12
it 12
was 12
because 12
there 12
was 12
everything 12
to 12
think 12
about 12
and 12
much 12
to 12
remember 12
perhaps 12
later 12
in 12
the 12
morning 12
when 12
the 12
sun 12
was 12
up 12
and 12
had 12
warmed 12
them 12
they 12
would 12
begin 12
to 12
talk 12
or 12
just 12
say 12
the 12
things 12
they 12
remembered 12
to 12
be 12
sure 12
they 12
were 12
there 12
to 12
be 12
absolutely 12
certain 12
that 12
things 12
were 12
safe 12
in 12
them 12
montag 12
felt 12
the 12
slow 12
stir 12
of 12
words 12
the 12
slow 12
simmer 12
and 12
when 12
it 12
came 12
to 12
his 12
turn 12
what 12
could 12
he 12
say 12
what 12
could 12
he 12
offer 12
on 12
a 12
day 12
like 12
this 12
to 12
make 12
the 12
trip 12
a 12
little 12
easier 12
to 12
everything 12
there 12
is 12
a 12
season 12
yes 12
a 12
time 12
to 12
break 12
down 12
and 12
a 12
time 12
to 12
build 12
up 12
yes 12
a 12
time 12
to 12
keep 12
silence 12
and 12
a 12
time 12
to 12
speak 12
yes 12
all 12
that 12
but 12
what 12
else 12
what 12
else 12
something 12
something 12
and 12
on 12
either 12
side 12
of 12
the 12
river 12
was 12
there 12
a 12
tree 12
of 12
life 12
which 12
bare 12
twelve 12
manner 12
of 12
fruits 12
and 12
yielded 12
her 12
fruit 12

month 12
and 12
the 12
leaves 12
of 12

in 13
my 13
younger 13
and 13
more 13
vulnerable 13
years 13
my 13
father 13
gave 13
me 13
some 13
advice 13
that 13
ive 13
been 13
turning 13
over 13
in 13
my 13
mind 13
ever 13
since 13
whenever 13
you 13
feel 13
like 13
criticizing 13
any 13
one 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
just 13
remember 13
that 13
all 13
the 13
people 13
in 13
this 13
world 13
havent 13
had 13
the 13
advantages 13
that 13
youve 13
had 13
he 13
didnt 13
say 13
any 13
more 13
but 13
weve 13
always 13
been 13
unusually 13
communicative 13
in 13
a 13
reserved 13
way 13
and 13
i 13
understood 13
that 13
he 13
meant 13
a 13
great 13
deal 13
more 13
than 13
that 13
in 13
consequence 13
im 13
inclined 13
to 13
reserve 13
all 13
judgments 13
a 13
habit 13
that 13
has 13
opened 13
up 13
many 13
curious 13
natures 13
to 13
me 13
and 13
also 13
made 13
me 13
the 13
victim 13
of 13
not 13
a 13
few 13
veteran 13
bores 13
the 13
abnormal 13
mind 13
is 13
quick 13
to 13
detect 13
and 13
attach 13
itself 13
to 13
this 13
quality 13
when 13
it 13
appears 13
in 13
a 13
normal 13
person 13
and 13
so 13
it 13
came 13
about 13
that 13
in 13
college 13
i 13
was 13
unjustly 13
accused 13
of 13
being 13
a 13
politician 13
because 13
i 13
was 13
privy 13
to 13
the 13
secret 13
griefs 13
of 13
wild 13
unknown 13
men 13
most 13
of 13
the 13
confidences 13
were 13
unsoughtfrequently 13
i 13
have 13
feigned 13
sleep 13
preoccupation 13
or 13
a 13
hostile 13
levity 13
when 13
i 13
realized 13
by 13
some 13
unmistakable 13
sign 13
that 13
an 13
intimate 13
revelation 13
was 13
quivering 13
on 13
the 13
horizon 13
for 13
the 13
intimate 13
revelations 13
of 13
young 13
men 13
or 13
at 13
least 13
the 13
terms 13
in 13
which 13
they 13
express 13
them 13
are 13
usually 13
plagiaristic 13
and 13
marred 13
by 13
obvious 13
suppressions 13
reserving 13
judgments 13
is 13
a 13
matter 13
of 13
infinite 13
hope 13
i 13
am 13
still 13
a 13
little 13
afraid 13
of 13
missing 13
something 13
if 13
i 13
forget 13
that 13
as 13
my 13
father 13
snobbishly 13
suggested 13
and 13
i 13
snobbishly 13
repeat 13
a 13
sense 13
of 13
the 13
fundamental 13
decencies 13
is 13
parcelled 13
out 13
unequally 13
at 13
birth 13
and 13
after 13
boasting 13
this 13
way 13
of 13
my 13
tolerance 13
i 13
come 13
to 13
the 13
admission 13
that 13
it 13
has 13
a 13
limit 13
conduct 13
may 13
be 13
founded 13
on 13
the 13
hard 13
rock 13
or 13
the 13
wet 13
marshes 13
but 13
after 13
a 13
certain 13
point 13
i 13
dont 13
care 13
what 13
its 13
founded 13
on 13
when 13
i 13
came 13
back 13
from 13
the 13
east 13
last 13
autumn 13
i 13
felt 13
that 13
i 13
wanted 13
the 13
world 13
to 13
be 13
in 13
uniform 13
and 13
at 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
moral 13
attention 13
forever 13
i 13
wanted 13
no 13
more 13
riotous 13
excursions 13
with 13
privileged 13
glimpses 13
into 13
the 13
human 13
heart 13
only 13
gatsby 13
the 13
man 13
who 13
gives 13
his 13
name 13
to 13
this 13
book 13
was 13
exempt 13
from 13
my 13
reactiongatsby 13
who 13
represented 13
everything 13
for 13
which 13
i 13
have 13
an 13
unaffected 13
scorn 13
if 13
personality 13
is 13
an 13
unbroken 13
series 13
of 13
successful 13
gestures 13
then 13
there 13
was 13
something 13
gorgeous 13
about 13
him 13
some 13
heightened 13
sensitivity 13
to 13
the 13
promises 13
of 13
life 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
were 13
related 13
to 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
intricate 13
machines 13
that 13
register 13
earthquakes 13
ten 13
thousand 13
miles 13
away 13
this 13
responsiveness 13
had 13
nothing 13
to 13
do 13
with 13
that 13
flabby 13
impressionability 13
which 13
is 13
dignified 13
under 13
the 13
name 13
of 13
the 13
creative 13
temperamentit 13
was 13
an 13
extraordinary 13
gift 13
for 13
hope 13
a 13
romantic 13
readiness 13
such 13
as 13
i 13
have 13
never 13
found 13
in 13
any 13
other 13
person 13
and 13
which 13
it 13
is 13
not 13
likely 13
i 13
shall 13
ever 13
find 13
again 13
nogatsby 13
turned 13
out 13
all 13
right 13
at 13
the 13
end 13
it 13
is 13
what 13
preyed 13
on 13
gatsby 13
what 13
foul 13
dust 13
floated 13
in 13
the 13
wake 13
of 13
his 13
dreams 13
that 13
temporarily 13
closed 13
out 13
my 13
interest 13
in 13
the 13
abortive 13
sorrows 13
and 13
shortwinded 13
elations 13
of 13
men 13
my 13
family 13
have 13
been 13
prominent 13
welltodo 13
people 13
in 13
this 13
middle 13
western 13
city 13
for 13
three 13
generations 13
the 13
carraways 13
are 13
something 13
of 13
a 13
clan 13
and 13
we 13
have 13
a 13
tradition 13
that 13
were 13
descended 13
from 13
the 13
dukes 13
of 13
buccleuch 13
but 13
the 13
actual 13
founder 13
of 13
my 13
line 13
was 13
my 13
grandfathers 13
brother 13
who 13
came 13
here 13
in 13
fiftyone 13
sent 13
a 13
substitute 13
to 13
the 13
civil 13
war 13
and 13
started 13
the 13
wholesale 13
hardware 13
business 13
that 13
my 13
father 13
carries 13
on 13
today 13
i 13
never 13
saw 13
this 13
greatuncle 13
but 13
im 13
supposed 13
to 13
look 13
like 13
himwith 13
special 13
reference 13
to 13
the 13
rather 13
hardboiled 13
painting 13
that 13
hangs 13
in 13
fathers 13
office 13
i 13
graduated 13
from 13
new 13
haven 13
in 13
just 13
a 13
quarter 13
of 13
a 13
century 13
after 13
my 13
father 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
later 13
i 13
participated 13
in 13
that 13
delayed 13
teutonic 13
migration 13
known 13
as 13
the 13
great 13
war 13
i 13
enjoyed 13
the 13
counterraid 13
so 13
thoroughly 13
that 13
i 13
came 13
back 13
restless 13
instead 13
of 13
being 13
the 13
warm 13
centre 13
of 13
the 13
world 13
the 13
middle 13
west 13
now 13
seemed 13
like 13
the 13
ragged 13
edge 13
of 13
the 13
universeso 13
i 13
decided 13
to 13
go 13
east 13
and 13
learn 13
the 13
bond 13
business 13
everybody 13
i 13
knew 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
bond 13
business 13
so 13
i 13
supposed 13
it 13
could 13
support 13
one 13
more 13
single 13
man 13
all 13
my 13
aunts 13
and 13
uncles 13
talked 13
it 13
over 13
as 13
if 13
they 13
were 13
choosing 13
a 13
prep 13
school 13
for 13
me 13
and 13
finally 13
said 13
whyyees 13
with 13
very 13
grave 13
hesitant 13
faces 13
father 13
agreed 13
to 13
finance 13
me 13
for 13
a 13
year 13
and 13
after 13
various 13
delays 13
i 13
came 13
east 13
permanently 13
i 13
thought 13
in 13
the 13
spring 13
of 13
twentytwo 13
the 13
practical 13
thing 13
was 13
to 13
find 13
rooms 13
in 13
the 13
city 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
warm 13
season 13
and 13
i 13
had 13
just 13
left 13
a 13
country 13
of 13
wide 13
lawns 13
and 13
friendly 13
trees 13
so 13
when 13
a 13
young 13
man 13
at 13
the 13
office 13
suggested 13
that 13
we 13
take 13
a 13
house 13
together 13
in 13
a 13
commuting 13
town 13
it 13
sounded 13
like 13
a 13
great 13
idea 13
he 13
found 13
the 13
house 13
a 13
weatherbeaten 13
cardboard 13
bungalow 13
at 13
eighty 13
a 13
month 13
but 13
at 13
the 13
last 13
minute 13
the 13
firm 13
ordered 13
him 13
to 13
washington 13
and 13
i 13
went 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
country 13
alone 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
dogat 13
least 13
i 13
had 13
him 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
days 13
until 13
he 13
ran 13
awayand 13
an 13
old 13
dodge 13
and 13
a 13
finnish 13
woman 13
who 13
made 13
my 13
bed 13
and 13
cooked 13
breakfast 13
and 13
muttered 13
finnish 13
wisdom 13
to 13
herself 13
over 13
the 13
electric 13
stove 13
it 13
was 13
lonely 13
for 13
a 13
day 13
or 13
so 13
until 13
one 13
morning 13
some 13
man 13
more 13
recently 13
arrived 13
than 13
i 13
stopped 13
me 13
on 13
the 13
road 13
how 13
do 13
you 13
get 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
village 13
he 13
asked 13
helplessly 13
i 13
told 13
him 13
and 13
as 13
i 13
walked 13
on 13
i 13
was 13
lonely 13
no 13
longer 13
i 13
was 13
a 13
guide 13
a 13
pathfinder 13
an 13
original 13
settler 13
he 13
had 13
casually 13
conferred 13
on 13
me 13
the 13
freedom 13
of 13
the 13
neighborhood 13
and 13
so 13
with 13
the 13
sunshine 13
and 13
the 13
great 13
bursts 13
of 13
leaves 13
growing 13
on 13
the 13
trees 13
just 13
as 13
things 13
grow 13
in 13
fast 13
movies 13
i 13
had 13
that 13
familiar 13
conviction 13
that 13
life 13
was 13
beginning 13
over 13
again 13
with 13
the 13
summer 13
there 13
was 13
so 13
much 13
to 13
read 13
for 13
one 13
thing 13
and 13
so 13
much 13
fine 13
health 13
to 13
be 13
pulled 13
down 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
young 13
breathgiving 13
air 13
i 13
bought 13
a 13
dozen 13
volumes 13
on 13
banking 13
and 13
credit 13
and 13

they 13
stood 13
on 13
my 13
shelf 13
in 13

gold 13
like 13
new 13

of 13
reading 13
many 13
other 13

literary 13

obvious 13

to 13
bring 13
back 13
all 13
such 13
things 13
into 13

at 13
from 13
a 13
single 13
window 13
after 13
all 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
matter 13
of 13
chance 13

i 13
should 13
have 13

a 13

in 13
one 13
of 13
the 13

a 13

superficial 13
tag 13
to 13
express 13
the 13
bizarre 13
and 13
not 13
a 13
little 13
sinister 13
contrast 13
between 13
them 13
my 13
house 13
was 13
at 13
the 13
very 13
tip 13
of 13

fifty 13

a 13

the 13
one 13

was 13
a 13
colossal 13
affair 13
by 13
any 13
standardit 13
was 13
a 13
factual 13
imitation 13
of 13
some 13
hotel 13
de 13

in 13
normandy 13
with 13
a 13

on 13

more 13
than 13
forty 13

rather 13
as 13
i 13
didnt 13
know 13

it 13
was 13
a 13
mansion 13

by 13
a 13
gentleman 13
of 13
that 13
name 13
my 13
own 13
house 13
was 13
an 13
eyesore 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
small 13
eyesore 13
and 13
it 13
had 13
been 13
overlooked 13
so 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
view 13
of 13
the 13
water 13
a 13
partial 13
view 13
of 13
my 13

and 13
the 13
consoling 13
proximity 13
of 13

for 13
eighty 13

of 13
the 13

really 13
begins 13
on 13
the 13
evening 13
i 13
drove 13
over 13
there 13
to 13
have 13
dinner 13
with 13
the 13
tom 13
buchanans 13

my 13
second 13
cousin 13
once 13
removed 13
and 13
id 13
known 13
tom 13
in 13
college 13
and 13
just 13
after 13
the 13
war 13
i 13
spent 13
two 13
days 13
with 13
them 13
in 13
chicago 13
her 13
husband 13
among 13
various 13
physical 13
accomplishments 13
had 13
been 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
most 13
powerful 13
ends 13
that 13
ever 13
played 13
football 13
at 13
new 13
havena 13
national 13
figure 13
in 13
a 13
way 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
men 13
who 13
reach 13
such 13
an 13
acute 13
limited 13
excellence 13
at 13
twentyone 13
that 13
everything 13
afterward 13
savors 13
of 13
anticlimax 13
his 13
family 13
were 13
enormously 13
wealthyeven 13
in 13
college 13
his 13
freedom 13
with 13
money 13
was 13
a 13
matter 13
for 13
reproachbut 13
now 13
hed 13
left 13
chicago 13
and 13
come 13
east 13
in 13
a 13
fashion 13
that 13
rather 13
took 13
your 13
breath 13
away 13
for 13
instance 13
hed 13
brought 13
down 13
a 13
string 13
of 13
polo 13
ponies 13
from 13
lake 13
forest 13
it 13
was 13
hard 13
to 13
realize 13
that 13
a 13
man 13
in 13
my 13
own 13
generation 13
was 13
wealthy 13
enough 13
to 13
do 13
that 13
why 13
they 13
came 13
east 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
they 13
had 13
spent 13
a 13
year 13
in 13
france 13
for 13
no 13
particular 13
reason 13
and 13
then 13
drifted 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
unrestfully 13
wherever 13
people 13
played 13
polo 13
and 13
were 13
rich 13
together 13
this 13
was 13
a 13
permanent 13
move 13
said 13
daisy 13
over 13
the 13
telephone 13
but 13
i 13
didnt 13
believe 13
iti 13
had 13
no 13
sight 13
into 13
daisys 13
heart 13
but 13
i 13
felt 13
that 13
tom 13
would 13
drift 13
on 13
forever 13
seeking 13
a 13
little 13
wistfully 13
for 13
the 13
dramatic 13
turbulence 13
of 13
some 13
irrecoverable 13
football 13
game 13
and 13
so 13
it 13
happened 13
that 13
on 13
a 13
warm 13
windy 13
evening 13
i 13
drove 13
over 13
to 13
east 13
egg 13
to 13
see 13
two 13
old 13
friends 13
whom 13
i 13
scarcely 13
knew 13
at 13
all 13
their 13
house 13
was 13
even 13
more 13
elaborate 13
than 13
i 13
expected 13
a 13
cheerful 13
redandwhite 13
georgian 13
colonial 13
mansion 13
overlooking 13
the 13
bay 13
the 13
lawn 13
started 13
at 13
the 13
beach 13
and 13
ran 13
toward 13
the 13
front 13
door 13
for 13
a 13
quarter 13
of 13
a 13
mile 13
jumping 13
over 13
sundials 13
and 13
brick 13
walks 13
and 13
burning 13
gardensfinally 13
when 13
it 13
reached 13
the 13
house 13
drifting 13
up 13
the 13
side 13
in 13
bright 13
vines 13
as 13
though 13
from 13
the 13
momentum 13
of 13
its 13
run 13
the 13
front 13
was 13
broken 13
by 13
a 13
line 13
of 13
french 13
windows 13
glowing 13
now 13
with 13
reflected 13
gold 13
and 13
wide 13
open 13
to 13
the 13
warm 13
windy 13
afternoon 13
and 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
in 13
riding 13
clothes 13
was 13
standing 13
with 13
his 13
legs 13
apart 13
on 13
the 13
front 13
porch 13
he 13
had 13
changed 13
since 13
his 13
new 13
haven 13
years 13
now 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
sturdy 13
strawhaired 13
man 13
of 13
thirty 13
with 13
a 13
rather 13
hard 13
mouth 13
and 13
a 13
supercilious 13
manner 13
two 13
shining 13
arrogant 13
eyes 13
had 13
established 13
dominance 13
over 13
his 13
face 13
and 13
gave 13
him 13
the 13
appearance 13
of 13
always 13
leaning 13
aggressively 13
forward 13
not 13
even 13
the 13
effeminate 13
swank 13
of 13
his 13
riding 13
clothes 13
could 13
hide 13
the 13
enormous 13
power 13
of 13
that 13
bodyhe 13
seemed 13
to 13
fill 13
those 13
glistening 13
boots 13
until 13
he 13
strained 13
the 13
top 13
lacing 13
and 13
you 13
could 13
see 13
a 13
great 13
pack 13
of 13
muscle 13
shifting 13
when 13
his 13
shoulder 13
moved 13
under 13
his 13
thin 13
coat 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
body 13
capable 13
of 13
enormous 13
leveragea 13
cruel 13
body 13
his 13
speaking 13
voice 13
a 13
gruff 13
husky 13
tenor 13
added 13
to 13
the 13
impression 13
of 13
fractiousness 13
he 13
conveyed 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
touch 13
of 13
paternal 13
contempt 13
in 13
it 13
even 13
toward 13
people 13
he 13
likedand 13
there 13
were 13
men 13
at 13
new 13
haven 13
who 13
had 13
hated 13
his 13
guts 13
now 13
dont 13
think 13
my 13
opinion 13
on 13
these 13
matters 13
is 13
final 13
he 13
seemed 13
to 13
say 13
just 13
because 13
im 13
stronger 13
and 13
more 13
of 13
a 13
man 13
than 13
you 13
are 13
we 13
were 13
in 13
the 13
same 13
senior 13
society 13
and 13
while 13
we 13
were 13
never 13
intimate 13
i 13
always 13
had 13
the 13
impression 13
that 13
he 13
approved 13
of 13
me 13
and 13
wanted 13
me 13
to 13
like 13
him 13
with 13
some 13
harsh 13
defiant 13
wistfulness 13
of 13
his 13
own 13
we 13
talked 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
minutes 13
on 13
the 13
sunny 13
porch 13
ive 13
got 13
a 13
nice 13
place 13
here 13
he 13
said 13
his 13
eyes 13
flashing 13
about 13
restlessly 13
turning 13
me 13
around 13
by 13
one 13
arm 13
he 13
moved 13
a 13
broad 13
flat 13
hand 13
along 13
the 13
front 13
vista 13
including 13
in 13
its 13
sweep 13
a 13
sunken 13
italian 13
garden 13
a 13
half 13
acre 13
of 13
deep 13
pungent 13
roses 13
and 13
a 13
snubnosed 13
motorboat 13
that 13
bumped 13
the 13
tide 13
offshore 13
it 13
belonged 13
to 13
demaine 13
the 13
oil 13
man 13
he 13
turned 13
me 13
around 13
again 13
politely 13
and 13
abruptly 13
well 13
go 13
inside 13
we 13
walked 13
through 13
a 13
high 13
hallway 13
into 13
a 13
bright 13
rosycolored 13
space 13
fragilely 13
bound 13
into 13
the 13
house 13
by 13
french 13
windows 13
at 13
either 13
end 13
the 13
windows 13
were 13
ajar 13
and 13
gleaming 13
white 13
against 13
the 13
fresh 13
grass 13
outside 13
that 13
seemed 13
to 13
grow 13
a 13
little 13
way 13
into 13
the 13
house 13
a 13
breeze 13
blew 13
through 13
the 13
room 13
blew 13
curtains 13
in 13
at 13
one 13
end 13
and 13
out 13
the 13
other 13
like 13
pale 13
flags 13
twisting 13
them 13
up 13
toward 13
the 13
frosted 13
weddingcake 13
of 13
the 13
ceiling 13
and 13
then 13
rippled 13
over 13
the 13
winecolored 13
rug 13
making 13
a 13
shadow 13
on 13
it 13
as 13
wind 13
does 13
on 13
the 13
sea 13
the 13
only 13
completely 13
stationary 13
object 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
was 13
an 13
enormous 13
couch 13
on 13
which 13
two 13
young 13
women 13
were 13
buoyed 13
up 13
as 13
though 13
upon 13
an 13
anchored 13
balloon 13
they 13
were 13
both 13
in 13
white 13
and 13
their 13
dresses 13
were 13
rippling 13
and 13
fluttering 13
as 13
if 13
they 13
had 13
just 13
been 13
blown 13
back 13
in 13
after 13
a 13
short 13
flight 13
around 13
the 13
house 13
i 13
must 13
have 13
stood 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
moments 13
listening 13
to 13
the 13
whip 13
and 13
snap 13
of 13
the 13
curtains 13
and 13
the 13
groan 13
of 13
a 13
picture 13
on 13
the 13
wall 13
then 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
boom 13
as 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
shut 13
the 13
rear 13
windows 13
and 13
the 13
caught 13
wind 13
died 13
out 13
about 13
the 13
room 13
and 13
the 13
curtains 13
and 13
the 13
rugs 13
and 13
the 13
two 13
young 13
women 13
ballooned 13
slowly 13
to 13
the 13
floor 13
the 13
younger 13
of 13
the 13
two 13
was 13
a 13
stranger 13
to 13
me 13
she 13
was 13
extended 13
full 13
length 13
at 13
her 13
end 13
of 13
the 13
divan 13
completely 13
motionless 13
and 13
with 13
her 13
chin 13
raised 13
a 13
little 13
as 13
if 13
she 13
were 13
balancing 13
something 13
on 13
it 13
which 13
was 13
quite 13
likely 13
to 13
fall 13
if 13
she 13
saw 13
me 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
corner 13
of 13
her 13
eyes 13
she 13
gave 13
no 13
hint 13
of 13
itindeed 13
i 13
was 13
almost 13
surprised 13
into 13
murmuring 13
an 13
apology 13
for 13
having 13
disturbed 13
her 13
by 13
coming 13
in 13
the 13
other 13
girl 13
daisy 13
made 13
an 13
attempt 13
to 13
riseshe 13
leaned 13
slightly 13
forward 13
with 13
a 13
conscientious 13
expressionthen 13
she 13
laughed 13
an 13
absurd 13
charming 13
little 13
laugh 13
and 13
i 13
laughed 13
too 13
and 13
came 13
forward 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
im 13
pparalyzed 13
with 13
happiness 13
she 13
laughed 13
again 13
as 13
if 13
she 13
said 13
something 13
very 13
witty 13
and 13
held 13
my 13
hand 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
looking 13
up 13
into 13
my 13
face 13
promising 13
that 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
one 13
in 13
the 13
world 13
she 13
so 13
much 13
wanted 13
to 13
see 13
that 13
was 13
a 13
way 13
she 13
had 13
she 13
hinted 13
in 13
a 13
murmur 13
that 13
the 13
surname 13
of 13
the 13
balancing 13
girl 13
was 13
baker 13
ive 13
heard 13
it 13
said 13
that 13
daisys 13
murmur 13
was 13
only 13
to 13
make 13
people 13
lean 13
toward 13
her 13
an 13
irrelevant 13
criticism 13
that 13
made 13
it 13
no 13
less 13
charming 13
at 13
any 13
rate 13
miss 13
bakers 13
lips 13
fluttered 13
she 13
nodded 13
at 13
me 13
almost 13
imperceptibly 13
and 13
then 13
quickly 13
tipped 13
her 13
head 13
back 13
againthe 13
object 13
she 13
was 13
balancing 13
had 13
obviously 13
tottered 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
given 13
her 13
something 13
of 13
a 13
fright 13
again 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
apology 13
arose 13
to 13
my 13
lips 13
almost 13
any 13
exhibition 13
of 13
complete 13
selfsufficiency 13
draws 13
a 13
stunned 13
tribute 13
from 13
me 13
i 13
looked 13
back 13
at 13
my 13
cousin 13
who 13
began 13
to 13
ask 13
me 13
questions 13
in 13
her 13
low 13
thrilling 13
voice 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
kind 13
of 13
voice 13
that 13
the 13
ear 13
follows 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
as 13
if 13
each 13
speech 13
is 13
an 13
arrangement 13
of 13
notes 13
that 13
will 13
never 13
be 13
played 13
again 13
her 13
face 13
was 13
sad 13
and 13
lovely 13
with 13
bright 13
things 13
in 13
it 13
bright 13
eyes 13
and 13
a 13
bright 13
passionate 13
mouth 13
but 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
excitement 13
in 13
her 13
voice 13
that 13
men 13
who 13
had 13
cared 13
for 13
her 13
found 13
difficult 13
to 13
forget 13
a 13
singing 13
compulsion 13
a 13
whispered 13
listen 13
a 13
promise 13
that 13
she 13
had 13
done 13
gay 13
exciting 13
things 13
just 13
a 13
while 13
since 13
and 13
that 13
there 13
were 13
gay 13
exciting 13
things 13
hovering 13
in 13
the 13
next 13
hour 13
i 13
told 13
her 13
how 13
i 13
had 13
stopped 13
off 13
in 13
chicago 13
for 13
a 13
day 13
on 13
my 13
way 13
east 13
and 13
how 13
a 13
dozen 13
people 13
had 13
sent 13
their 13
love 13
through 13
me 13
do 13
they 13
miss 13
me 13
she 13
cried 13
ecstatically 13
the 13
whole 13
town 13
is 13
desolate 13
all 13
the 13
cars 13
have 13
the 13
left 13
rear 13
wheel 13
painted 13
black 13
as 13
a 13
mourning 13
wreath 13
and 13
theres 13
a 13
persistent 13
wail 13
all 13
night 13
along 13
the 13
north 13
shore 13
how 13
gorgeous 13
lets 13

tom 13

she 13
added 13
irrelevantly 13

baby 13

tom 13
buchanan 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
hovering 13
restlessly 13
about 13
the 13
room 13
stopped 13
and 13
rested 13
his 13
hand 13
on 13
my 13
shoulder 13
what 13

he 13
said 13
glancing 13
at 13
daisy 13
and 13
then 13
back 13
at 13
me 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
were 13
alert 13
for 13
something 13
more 13

a 13
god 13
damned 13
fool 13
to 13
live 13
anywhere 13
else 13
at 13
this 13
point 13
miss 13
baker 13
said 13
absolutely 13
with 13
such 13
suddenness 13
that 13
i 13
startedit 13
was 13
the 13
first 13
word 13
she 13
uttered 13
since 13
i 13
came 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
evidently 13
it 13
surprised 13
her 13
as 13
much 13
as 13
it 13
did 13
me 13
for 13
she 13
yawned 13
and 13
with 13
a 13
series 13
of 13
rapid 13
deft 13
movements 13
stood 13
up 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
im 13
stiff 13
she 13
complained 13
ive 13
been 13
lying 13
on 13
that 13
sofa 13
for 13
as 13
long 13
as 13
i 13
can 13
remember 13
dont 13
look 13
at 13

daisy 13

miss 13
baker 13
to 13
the 13
four 13
cocktails 13
just 13
in 13
from 13
the 13
pantry 13
im 13
absolutely 13
in 13
training 13
her 13
host 13
looked 13
at 13
her 13
incredulously 13
you 13
are 13
he 13
took 13
down 13
his 13
drink 13
as 13
if 13
it 13
were 13
a 13
drop 13
in 13
the 13
bottom 13
of 13
a 13
glass 13
how 13
you 13
ever 13
get 13
anything 13
done 13
is 13
beyond 13
me 13
i 13
looked 13
at 13
miss 13
baker 13
wondering 13
what 13
it 13
was 13
she 13
got 13
done 13
i 13
enjoyed 13
looking 13
at 13
her 13
she 13
was 13
a 13
slender 13
smallbreasted 13
girl 13
with 13
an 13
erect 13
carriage 13
which 13
she 13
accentuated 13
by 13
throwing 13
her 13
body 13
backward 13
at 13
the 13
shoulders 13
like 13
a 13
young 13
cadet 13
her 13
gray 13
sunstrained 13
eyes 13
looked 13
back 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
polite 13
reciprocal 13
curiosity 13
out 13
of 13
a 13
wan 13
charming 13
discontented 13
face 13
it 13
occurred 13
to 13
me 13
now 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
seen 13
her 13
or 13
a 13
picture 13
of 13
her 13
somewhere 13
before 13
you 13
live 13
in 13
west 13
egg 13
she 13
remarked 13
contemptuously 13
i 13

somebody 13
there 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
a 13
single 13

must 13
know 13
gatsby 13
gatsby 13
demanded 13
daisy 13
what 13
gatsby 13
before 13
i 13
could 13
reply 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
my 13
neighbor 13
dinner 13
was 13
announced 13
wedging 13
his 13
tense 13
arm 13
imperatively 13
under 13
mine 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
compelled 13
me 13
from 13
the 13
room 13
as 13
though 13
he 13
were 13
moving 13
a 13
checker 13
to 13
another 13
square 13
slenderly 13
languidly 13
their 13
hands 13
set 13
lightly 13
on 13
their 13
hips 13
the 13
two 13
young 13
women 13
preceded 13
us 13
out 13
onto 13
a 13
rosycolored 13
porch 13
open 13
toward 13
the 13
sunset 13
where 13
four 13
candles 13
flickered 13
on 13
the 13
table 13
in 13
the 13
diminished 13
wind 13
why 13
candles 13
objected 13
daisy 13
frowning 13
she 13
snapped 13
them 13
out 13
with 13
her 13
fingers 13
in 13
two 13
weeks 13
itll 13

it 13

miss 13
baker 13
sitting 13
down 13
at 13
the 13
table 13
as 13
if 13
she 13
were 13
getting 13
into 13

right 13
said 13
daisy 13
whatll 13

she 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
helplessly 13
what 13

people 13
plan 13
before 13
i 13
could 13
answer 13
her 13
eyes 13
fastened 13
with 13
an 13
awed 13
expression 13
on 13
her 13
little 13
finger 13
look 13

i 13
get 13
for 13
marrying 13
a 13
brute 13
of 13
a 13
man 13
a 13
great 13
big 13
hulking 13
physical 13
specimen 13
of 13
a 13
i 13
hate 13
that 13
word 13
hulking 13
objected 13
tom 13
crossly 13
even 13
in 13
kidding 13
hulking 13
insisted 13
daisy 13
sometimes 13
she 13
and 13
miss 13
baker 13
talked 13
at 13
once 13
unobtrusively 13
and 13
with 13
a 13
bantering 13
inconsequence 13
that 13
was 13
never 13
quite 13
chatter 13
that 13
was 13
as 13
cool 13
as 13
their 13
white 13
dresses 13
and 13
their 13
impersonal 13
eyes 13
in 13
the 13
absence 13
of 13
all 13
desire 13
they 13
were 13
here 13
and 13
they 13
accepted 13
tom 13
and 13
me 13
making 13
only 13
a 13
polite 13
pleasant 13
effort 13
to 13
entertain 13
or 13
to 13
be 13
entertained 13
they 13
knew 13
that 13
presently 13
dinner 13
would 13
be 13
over 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
later 13
the 13
evening 13
too 13
would 13
be 13
over 13
and 13
casually 13
put 13
away 13
it 13
was 13
sharply 13
different 13
from 13
the 13
west 13
where 13
an 13
evening 13
was 13
hurried 13
from 13
phase 13
to 13
phase 13
toward 13
its 13
close 13
in 13
a 13
continually 13
disappointed 13
anticipation 13
or 13
else 13
in 13
sheer 13
nervous 13
dread 13
of 13
the 13
moment 13
itself 13
you 13
make 13
me 13
feel 13
uncivilized 13
daisy 13
i 13
confessed 13
on 13
my 13
second 13
glass 13
of 13
corky 13
but 13
rather 13
impressive 13
claret 13
cant 13
you 13
talk 13
about 13
crops 13
or 13
something 13
i 13
meant 13
nothing 13
in 13
particular 13
by 13
this 13
remark 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
taken 13
up 13
in 13
an 13
unexpected 13
way 13
civilizations 13
going 13
to 13
pieces 13
broke 13
out 13
tom 13
violently 13
ive 13
gotten 13
to 13
be 13
a 13
terrible 13
pessimist 13
about 13
things 13
have 13
you 13
read 13
the 13
rise 13
of 13
the 13
colored 13
empires 13
by 13
this 13
man 13
goddard 13
why 13
no 13
i 13
answered 13
rather 13
surprised 13
by 13
his 13
tone 13
well 13
its 13
a 13
fine 13
book 13
and 13
everybody 13
ought 13
to 13
read 13
it 13
the 13
idea 13
is 13
if 13
we 13
dont 13
look 13
out 13
the 13
white 13
race 13
will 13
bewill 13
be 13
utterly 13
submerged 13
its 13
all 13
scientific 13
stuff 13
its 13
been 13
proved 13
toms 13
getting 13
very 13
profound 13
said 13
daisy 13
with 13
an 13
expression 13
of 13
unthoughtful 13
sadness 13
he 13
reads 13
deep 13
books 13
with 13
long 13
words 13
in 13
them 13
what 13
was 13
that 13
word 13
we 13
well 13
these 13
books 13
are 13
all 13
scientific 13
insisted 13
tom 13
glancing 13
at 13
her 13
impatiently 13
this 13
fellow 13
has 13
worked 13
out 13
the 13
whole 13
thing 13
its 13
up 13
to 13
us 13
who 13
are 13
the 13
dominant 13
race 13
to 13
watch 13
out 13
or 13
these 13
other 13
races 13
will 13
have 13
control 13
of 13
things 13
weve 13
got 13
to 13
beat 13
them 13
down 13
whispered 13
daisy 13
winking 13
ferociously 13
toward 13
the 13
fervent 13
sun 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
live 13
in 13
california 13
began 13
miss 13
baker 13
but 13
tom 13
interrupted 13
her 13
by 13
shifting 13
heavily 13
in 13
his 13
chair 13
this 13
idea 13
is 13
that 13
were 13
nordics 13
i 13
am 13
and 13
you 13
are 13
and 13
you 13
are 13
and 13
after 13
an 13
infinitesimal 13
hesitation 13
he 13
included 13
daisy 13
with 13
a 13
slight 13
nod 13
and 13
she 13
winked 13
at 13
me 13
again 13
and 13
weve 13
produced 13
all 13
the 13
things 13
that 13
go 13
to 13
make 13
civilizationoh 13
science 13
and 13
art 13
and 13
all 13
that 13
do 13
you 13
see 13
there 13
was 13
something 13
pathetic 13
in 13
his 13
concentration 13
as 13
if 13
his 13
complacency 13
more 13
acute 13
than 13
of 13
old 13
was 13
not 13
enough 13
to 13
him 13
any 13
more 13
when 13
almost 13
immediately 13
the 13
telephone 13
rang 13
inside 13
and 13
the 13
butler 13
left 13
the 13
porch 13
daisy 13
seized 13
upon 13
the 13
momentary 13
interruption 13
and 13
leaned 13
toward 13
me 13
ill 13
tell 13
you 13
a 13
family 13
secret 13
she 13
whispered 13
enthusiastically 13
its 13
about 13
the 13
butlers 13
nose 13
do 13
you 13
want 13
to 13
hear 13
about 13
the 13
butlers 13
nose 13
thats 13
why 13
i 13
came 13
over 13
tonight 13
well 13
he 13
wasnt 13
always 13
a 13
butler 13
he 13
used 13
to 13
be 13
the 13
silver 13
polisher 13
for 13
some 13
people 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
that 13
had 13
a 13
silver 13
service 13
for 13
two 13
hundred 13
people 13
he 13
had 13
to 13
polish 13
it 13
from 13
morning 13
till 13
night 13
until 13
finally 13
it 13
began 13
to 13
affect 13
his 13
nose 13
things 13
went 13
from 13
bad 13
to 13
worse 13
suggested 13
miss 13
baker 13
yes 13
things 13
went 13
from 13
bad 13
to 13
worse 13
until 13
finally 13
he 13
had 13
to 13
give 13
up 13
his 13
position 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
the 13
last 13
sunshine 13
fell 13
with 13
romantic 13
affection 13
upon 13
her 13
glowing 13
face 13
her 13
voice 13
compelled 13
me 13
forward 13
breathlessly 13
as 13
i 13
listenedthen 13
the 13
glow 13
faded 13
each 13
light 13
deserting 13
her 13
with 13
lingering 13
regret 13
like 13
children 13
leaving 13
a 13
pleasant 13
street 13
at 13
dusk 13
the 13
butler 13
came 13
back 13
and 13
murmured 13
something 13
close 13
to 13
toms 13
ear 13
whereupon 13
tom 13
frowned 13
pushed 13
back 13
his 13
chair 13
and 13
without 13
a 13
word 13
went 13
inside 13
as 13
if 13
his 13
absence 13
quickened 13
something 13
within 13
her 13
daisy 13
leaned 13
forward 13
again 13
her 13
voice 13
glowing 13
and 13
singing 13
i 13
love 13
to 13
see 13
you 13
at 13
my 13
table 13
nick 13
you 13
remind 13
me 13
of 13
aof 13
a 13
rose 13
an 13
absolute 13
rose 13
doesnt 13
he 13
she 13
turned 13
to 13
miss 13
baker 13
for 13
confirmation 13
an 13
absolute 13
rose 13
this 13
was 13
untrue 13
i 13
am 13
not 13
even 13
faintly 13
like 13
a 13
rose 13
she 13
was 13
only 13
extemporizing 13
but 13
a 13
stirring 13
warmth 13
flowed 13
from 13
her 13
as 13
if 13
her 13
heart 13
was 13
trying 13
to 13
come 13
out 13
to 13
you 13
concealed 13
in 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
breathless 13
thrilling 13
words 13
then 13
suddenly 13
she 13
threw 13
her 13
napkin 13
on 13
the 13
table 13
and 13
excused 13
herself 13
and 13
went 13
into 13
the 13
house 13
miss 13
baker 13
and 13
i 13
exchanged 13
a 13
short 13
glance 13
consciously 13
devoid 13
of 13
meaning 13
i 13
was 13
about 13
to 13
speak 13
when 13
she 13
sat 13
up 13
alertly 13
and 13
said 13
sh 13
in 13
a 13
warning 13
voice 13
a 13
subdued 13
impassioned 13
murmur 13
was 13
audible 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
beyond 13
and 13
miss 13
baker 13
leaned 13
forward 13
unashamed 13
trying 13
to 13
hear 13
the 13
murmur 13
trembled 13
on 13
the 13
verge 13
of 13
coherence 13
sank 13
down 13
mounted 13
excitedly 13
and 13
then 13
ceased 13
altogether 13
this 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
you 13
spoke 13
of 13
is 13
my 13
neighbor 13
i 13
said 13
dont 13
talk 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
hear 13
what 13
happens 13
is 13
something 13
happening 13
i 13
inquired 13
innocently 13
you 13
mean 13
to 13
say 13
you 13
dont 13
know 13
said 13
miss 13
baker 13
honestly 13
surprised 13
i 13
thought 13
everybody 13
knew 13
i 13
dont 13
why 13
she 13
said 13
hesitantly 13
toms 13
got 13
some 13
woman 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
got 13
some 13
woman 13
i 13
repeated 13
blankly 13
miss 13
baker 13
nodded 13
she 13
might 13
have 13
the 13
decency 13
not 13
to 13
telephone 13
him 13
at 13
dinner 13
time 13
dont 13
you 13
think 13
almost 13
before 13
i 13
had 13
grasped 13
her 13
meaning 13
there 13
was 13
the 13
flutter 13
of 13
a 13
dress 13
and 13
the 13
crunch 13
of 13
leather 13
boots 13
and 13
tom 13
and 13
daisy 13
were 13
back 13
at 13
the 13
table 13
it 13
couldnt 13
be 13
helped 13
cried 13
daisy 13
with 13
tense 13
gaiety 13
she 13
sat 13
down 13
glanced 13
searchingly 13
at 13
miss 13
baker 13
and 13
then 13
at 13
me 13
and 13
continued 13
i 13
looked 13
outdoors 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
its 13
very 13
romantic 13
outdoors 13
theres 13
a 13
bird 13
on 13
the 13
lawn 13
that 13
i 13
think 13
must 13
be 13
a 13
nightingale 13
come 13
over 13
on 13
the 13
cunard 13
or 13
white 13
star 13
line 13
hes 13
singing 13
away 13
her 13
voice 13
sang 13
its 13
romantic 13
isnt 13
it 13
tom 13
very 13
romantic 13
he 13
said 13
and 13
then 13
miserably 13
to 13
me 13
if 13
its 13
light 13
enough 13
after 13
dinner 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
take 13
you 13
down 13
to 13
the 13
stables 13
the 13
telephone 13
rang 13
inside 13
startlingly 13
and 13
as 13
daisy 13
shook 13
her 13
head 13
decisively 13
at 13
tom 13
the 13
subject 13
of 13
the 13
stables 13
in 13
fact 13
all 13
subjects 13
vanished 13
into 13
air 13
among 13
the 13
broken 13
fragments 13
of 13
the 13
last 13
five 13
minutes 13
at 13
table 13
i 13
remember 13
the 13
candles 13
being 13
lit 13
again 13
pointlessly 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
conscious 13
of 13
wanting 13
to 13
look 13
squarely 13
at 13
every 13
one 13
and 13
yet 13
to 13
avoid 13
all 13
eyes 13
i 13
couldnt 13
guess 13
what 13
daisy 13
and 13
tom 13
were 13
thinking 13
but 13
i 13
doubt 13
if 13
even 13
miss 13
baker 13
who 13
seemed 13
to 13
have 13
mastered 13
a 13
certain 13
hardy 13
scepticism 13
was 13
able 13
utterly 13
to 13
put 13
this 13
fifth 13
guests 13
shrill 13
metallic 13
urgency 13
out 13
of 13
mind 13
to 13
a 13
certain 13
temperament 13
the 13
situation 13
might 13
have 13
seemed 13
intriguingmy 13
own 13
instinct 13
was 13
to 13
telephone 13
immediately 13
for 13
the 13
police 13
the 13
horses 13
needless 13
to 13
say 13
were 13
not 13
mentioned 13
again 13
tom 13
and 13
miss 13
baker 13
with 13
several 13
feet 13
of 13
twilight 13
between 13
them 13
strolled 13
back 13
into 13
the 13
library 13
as 13
if 13
to 13
a 13
vigil 13
beside 13
a 13
perfectly 13
tangible 13
body 13
while 13
trying 13
to 13
look 13
pleasantly 13
interested 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
deaf 13
i 13
followed 13
daisy 13
around 13
a 13
chain 13
of 13
connecting 13
verandas 13
to 13
the 13
porch 13
in 13
front 13
in 13
its 13
deep 13
gloom 13
we 13
sat 13
down 13
side 13
by 13
side 13
on 13
a 13
wicker 13
settee 13
daisy 13
took 13
her 13
face 13
in 13
her 13
hands 13
as 13
if 13
feeling 13
its 13
lovely 13
shape 13
and 13
her 13
eyes 13
moved 13
gradually 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
velvet 13
dusk 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
turbulent 13
emotions 13
possessed 13
her 13
so 13
i 13
asked 13
what 13
i 13
thought 13
would 13
be 13
some 13
sedative 13
questions 13
about 13
her 13
little 13
girl 13
we 13
dont 13
know 13
each 13
other 13
very 13
well 13
nick 13
she 13
said 13
suddenly 13
even 13
if 13
we 13
are 13
cousins 13
you 13
didnt 13
come 13
to 13
my 13
wedding 13
i 13
wasnt 13
back 13
from 13
the 13
war 13
thats 13
true 13
she 13
hesitated 13
well 13
ive 13
had 13
a 13
very 13
bad 13
time 13
nick 13
and 13
im 13
pretty 13
cynical 13
about 13
everything 13
evidently 13
she 13
had 13
reason 13
to 13
be 13
i 13
waited 13
but 13
she 13
didnt 13
say 13
any 13
more 13
and 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
returned 13
rather 13
feebly 13
to 13
the 13
subject 13
of 13
her 13
daughter 13
i 13
suppose 13
she 13
talks 13
andeats 13
and 13
everything 13
oh 13
yes 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
absently 13
listen 13
nick 13
let 13
me 13
tell 13
you 13
what 13
i 13
said 13
when 13
she 13
was 13
born 13
would 13
you 13
like 13
to 13
hear 13
very 13
much 13
itll 13
show 13
you 13
how 13
ive 13
gotten 13
to 13
feel 13
aboutthings 13
well 13
she 13
was 13
less 13
than 13
an 13
hour 13
old 13
and 13
tom 13
was 13
god 13
knows 13
where 13
i 13
woke 13
up 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
ether 13
with 13
an 13
utterly 13
abandoned 13
feeling 13
and 13
asked 13
the 13
nurse 13
right 13
away 13
if 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
boy 13
or 13
a 13
girl 13
she 13
told 13
me 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
girl 13
and 13
so 13
i 13
turned 13
my 13
head 13
away 13
and 13
wept 13
all 13
right 13
i 13
said 13
im 13
glad 13
its 13
a 13
girl 13
and 13
i 13
hope 13
shell 13
be 13
a 13
foolthats 13
the 13
best 13
thing 13
a 13
girl 13
can 13
be 13
in 13
this 13
world 13
a 13
beautiful 13
little 13
fool 13
you 13
see 13
i 13
think 13
everythings 13
terrible 13
anyhow 13
she 13
went 13
on 13
in 13
a 13
convinced 13
way 13
everybody 13
thinks 13
sothe 13
most 13
advanced 13
people 13
and 13
i 13
know 13
ive 13
been 13
everywhere 13
and 13
seen 13
everything 13
and 13
done 13
everything 13
her 13
eyes 13
flashed 13
around 13
her 13
in 13
a 13
defiant 13
way 13
rather 13
like 13
toms 13
and 13
she 13
laughed 13
with 13
thrilling 13
scorn 13
sophisticatedgod 13
im 13
sophisticated 13
the 13
instant 13
her 13
voice 13
broke 13
off 13
ceasing 13
to 13
compel 13
my 13
attention 13
my 13
belief 13
i 13
felt 13
the 13
basic 13
insincerity 13
of 13
what 13
she 13
had 13
said 13
it 13
made 13
me 13
uneasy 13
as 13
though 13
the 13
whole 13
evening 13
had 13
been 13
a 13
trick 13
of 13
some 13
sort 13
to 13
exact 13
a 13
contributory 13
emotion 13
from 13
me 13
i 13
waited 13
and 13
sure 13
enough 13
in 13
a 13
moment 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
an 13
absolute 13
smirk 13
on 13
her 13
lovely 13
face 13
as 13
if 13
she 13
had 13
asserted 13
her 13
membership 13
in 13
a 13
rather 13
distinguished 13
secret 13
society 13
to 13
which 13
she 13
and 13
tom 13
belonged 13
inside 13
the 13
crimson 13
room 13
bloomed 13
with 13
light 13
tom 13
and 13
miss 13
baker 13
sat 13
at 13
either 13
end 13
of 13
the 13
long 13
couch 13
and 13
she 13
read 13
aloud 13
to 13
him 13
from 13
the 13
saturday 13
evening 13
postthe 13
words 13
murmurous 13
and 13
uninflected 13
running 13
together 13
in 13
a 13
soothing 13
tune 13
the 13
lamplight 13
bright 13
on 13
his 13
boots 13
and 13
dull 13
on 13
the 13
autumnleaf 13
yellow 13
of 13
her 13
hair 13
glinted 13
along 13
the 13
paper 13
as 13
she 13
turned 13
a 13
page 13
with 13
a 13
flutter 13
of 13
slender 13
muscles 13
in 13
her 13
arms 13
when 13
we 13
came 13
in 13
she 13
held 13
us 13
silent 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
with 13
a 13
lifted 13
hand 13
to 13
be 13
continued 13
she 13
said 13
tossing 13
the 13
magazine 13
on 13
the 13
table 13
in 13
our 13
very 13
next 13
issue 13
her 13
body 13
asserted 13
itself 13
with 13
a 13
restless 13
movement 13
of 13
her 13
knee 13
and 13
she 13
stood 13
up 13
ten 13
oclock 13
she 13
remarked 13
apparently 13
finding 13
the 13
time 13
on 13
the 13
ceiling 13
time 13

be 13
very 13
good 13
for 13
her 13
daisy 13
and 13
tom 13
looked 13
at 13
each 13
other 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
in 13
silence 13
is 13
she 13
from 13
new 13
york 13
i 13
asked 13
quickly 13
from 13
louisville 13
our 13
white 13
girlhood 13
was 13
passed 13
together 13
there 13
our 13
beautiful 13
white 13
did 13
you 13
give 13
nick 13
a 13
little 13
heart 13
to 13
heart 13
talk 13
on 13
the 13
veranda 13
demanded 13
tom 13
suddenly 13
did 13
i 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
i 13
cant 13
seem 13
to 13
remember 13
but 13
i 13
think 13
we 13
talked 13
about 13
the 13
nordic 13
race 13
yes 13
im 13
sure 13
we 13
did 13
it 13
sort 13
of 13
crept 13
up 13
on 13
us 13
and 13
first 13
thing 13
you 13
know 13
dont 13
believe 13
everything 13
you 13
hear 13
nick 13
he 13
advised 13
me 13
i 13
said 13
lightly 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
heard 13
nothing 13
at 13
all 13
and 13
a 13
few 13
minutes 13
later 13
i 13
got 13
up 13
to 13
go 13
home 13
they 13
came 13
to 13
the 13
door 13
with 13
me 13
and 13
stood 13
side 13
by 13
side 13
in 13
a 13
cheerful 13
square 13
of 13
light 13
as 13
i 13
started 13
my 13
motor 13
daisy 13
peremptorily 13
called 13
wait 13
i 13
forgot 13
to 13
ask 13
you 13
something 13
and 13
its 13
important 13
we 13
heard 13
you 13
were 13
engaged 13
to 13
a 13
girl 13
out 13
west 13
thats 13
right 13
corroborated 13
tom 13
kindly 13
we 13
heard 13
that 13
you 13
were 13
engaged 13
its 13
libel 13
im 13
too 13
poor 13
but 13
we 13
heard 13
it 13
insisted 13
daisy 13
surprising 13
me 13
by 13
opening 13
up 13
again 13
in 13
a 13
flowerlike 13
way 13
we 13
heard 13
it 13
from 13
three 13
people 13
so 13
it 13
must 13
be 13
true 13
of 13
course 13
i 13
knew 13
what 13
they 13
were 13
referring 13
to 13
but 13
i 13
wasnt 13
even 13
vaguely 13
engaged 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
gossip 13
had 13
published 13
the 13
banns 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
reasons 13
i 13
had 13
come 13
east 13
you 13
cant 13
stop 13
going 13
with 13
an 13
old 13
friend 13
on 13
account 13
of 13
rumors 13
and 13
on 13
the 13
other 13
hand 13
i 13
had 13
no 13
intention 13
of 13
being 13
rumored 13
into 13
marriage 13
their 13
interest 13
rather 13
touched 13
me 13
and 13
made 13
them 13
less 13
remotely 13
richnevertheless 13
i 13
was 13
confused 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
disgusted 13
as 13
i 13
drove 13
away 13
it 13
seemed 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
the 13
thing 13
for 13
daisy 13
to 13
do 13
was 13
to 13
rush 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
child 13
in 13
armsbut 13
apparently 13
there 13
were 13
no 13
such 13
intentions 13
in 13
her 13
head 13
as 13
for 13
tom 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
some 13
woman 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
was 13
really 13
less 13
surprising 13
than 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
been 13
depressed 13
by 13
a 13
book 13
something 13
was 13
making 13
him 13
nibble 13
at 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
stale 13
ideas 13
as 13
if 13
his 13
sturdy 13
physical 13
egotism 13
no 13
longer 13
nourished 13
his 13
peremptory 13
heart 13
already 13
it 13
was 13
deep 13
summer 13
on 13
roadhouse 13
roofs 13
and 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
wayside 13
garages 13
where 13
new 13
red 13
gaspumps 13
sat 13
out 13
in 13
pools 13
of 13
light 13
and 13
when 13
i 13
reached 13
my 13
estate 13
at 13
west 13
egg 13
i 13
ran 13
the 13
car 13
under 13
its 13
shed 13
and 13
sat 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
on 13
an 13
abandoned 13
grass 13
roller 13
in 13
the 13
yard 13
the 13
wind 13
had 13
blown 13
off 13
leaving 13
a 13
loud 13
bright 13
night 13
with 13
wings 13
beating 13
in 13
the 13
trees 13
and 13
a 13
persistent 13
organ 13
sound 13
as 13
the 13
full 13
bellows 13
of 13
the 13
earth 13
blew 13
the 13
frogs 13
full 13
of 13
life 13
the 13
silhouette 13
of 13
a 13
moving 13
cat 13
wavered 13
across 13
the 13
moonlight 13
and 13
turning 13
my 13
head 13
to 13
watch 13
it 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
i 13
was 13
not 13
alonefifty 13
feet 13
away 13
a 13
figure 13
had 13
emerged 13
from 13
the 13
shadow 13
of 13
my 13
neighbors 13
mansion 13
and 13
was 13
standing 13
with 13
his 13
hands 13
in 13
his 13
pockets 13
regarding 13
the 13
silver 13
pepper 13
of 13
the 13
stars 13
something 13
in 13
his 13
leisurely 13
movements 13
and 13
the 13
secure 13
position 13
of 13
his 13
feet 13
upon 13
the 13
lawn 13
suggested 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
himself 13
come 13
out 13
to 13
determine 13
what 13
share 13
was 13
his 13
of 13
our 13
local 13
heavens 13
i 13
decided 13
to 13
call 13
to 13
him 13
miss 13
baker 13
had 13
mentioned 13
him 13
at 13
dinner 13
and 13
that 13
would 13
do 13
for 13
an 13
introduction 13
but 13
i 13
didnt 13
call 13
to 13
him 13
for 13
he 13
gave 13
a 13
sudden 13
intimation 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
content 13
to 13
be 13
alonehe 13
stretched 13
out 13
his 13
arms 13
toward 13
the 13
dark 13
water 13
in 13
a 13
curious 13
way 13
and 13
far 13
as 13
i 13
was 13
from 13
him 13
i 13
could 13
have 13
sworn 13
he 13
was 13
trembling 13
involuntarily 13
i 13
glanced 13
seawardand 13
distinguished 13
nothing 13
except 13
a 13
single 13
green 13
light 13
minute 13
and 13
far 13
away 13
that 13
might 13
have 13
been 13
the 13
end 13
of 13
a 13
dock 13
when 13
i 13
looked 13
once 13
more 13
for 13
gatsby 13
he 13
had 13
vanished 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
alone 13
again 13
in 13
the 13
unquiet 13
darkness 13

the 13

road 13
hastily 13
joins 13
the 13
railroad 13
and 13
runs 13
beside 13
it 13
for 13
a 13
quarter 13
of 13
a 13
mile 13
so 13
as 13
to 13
shrink 13
away 13
from 13
a 13
certain 13
desolate 13
area 13
of 13
land 13
this 13
is 13
a 13
valley 13
of 13
ashesa 13
fantastic 13
farm 13
where 13
ashes 13
grow 13
like 13
wheat 13
into 13
ridges 13
and 13
hills 13
and 13
grotesque 13
gardens 13
where 13
ashes 13
take 13
the 13
forms 13
of 13
houses 13
and 13
chimneys 13
and 13
rising 13
smoke 13
and 13
finally 13
with 13
a 13
transcendent 13
effort 13
of 13
men 13
who 13
move 13
dimly 13
and 13
already 13
crumbling 13
through 13
the 13
powdery 13
air 13
occasionally 13
a 13
line 13
of 13
gray 13
cars 13
crawls 13
along 13
an 13
invisible 13
track 13
gives 13
out 13
a 13
ghastly 13
creak 13
and 13
comes 13
to 13
rest 13
and 13
immediately 13
the 13
ashgray 13
men 13
swarm 13
up 13
with 13
leaden 13
spades 13
and 13
stir 13
up 13
an 13
impenetrable 13
cloud 13
which 13
screens 13
their 13
obscure 13
operations 13
from 13
your 13
sight 13
but 13
above 13
the 13
gray 13
land 13
and 13
the 13
spasms 13
of 13
bleak 13
dust 13
which 13
drift 13
endlessly 13
over 13
it 13
you 13
perceive 13
after 13

the 13
eyes 13
of 13

are 13
blue 13
and 13
gigantictheir 13
irises 13
are 13
one 13
yard 13
high 13
they 13
look 13
out 13
of 13
no 13
face 13
but 13
instead 13
from 13
a 13
pair 13
of 13
enormous 13
yellow 13
spectacles 13
which 13
pass 13
over 13
a 13
nonexistent 13
nose 13
evidently 13
some 13
wild 13
wag 13
of 13
an 13
oculist 13
set 13
them 13
there 13
to 13
fatten 13
his 13
practice 13
in 13
the 13
borough 13
of 13
queens 13
and 13
then 13
sank 13
down 13
himself 13
into 13
eternal 13
blindness 13
or 13
forgot 13
them 13
and 13
moved 13
away 13
but 13
his 13
eyes 13
dimmed 13
a 13
little 13
by 13
many 13
paintless 13
days 13
under 13
sun 13
and 13
rain 13
brood 13
on 13
over 13
the 13
solemn 13
dumping 13
ground 13
the 13
valley 13
of 13
ashes 13
is 13
bounded 13
on 13
one 13
side 13
by 13
a 13
small 13
foul 13
river 13
and 13
when 13
the 13
drawbridge 13
is 13
up 13
to 13
let 13
barges 13
through 13
the 13
passengers 13
on 13
waiting 13
trains 13
can 13
stare 13
at 13
the 13
dismal 13
scene 13
for 13
as 13
long 13
as 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
there 13
is 13
always 13
a 13
halt 13
there 13
of 13
at 13
least 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
it 13
was 13
because 13
of 13
this 13
that 13
i 13
first 13
met 13
tom 13
buchanans 13
mistress 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
one 13
was 13
insisted 13
upon 13
wherever 13
he 13
was 13
known 13
his 13
acquaintances 13
resented 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
he 13
turned 13
up 13
in 13
popular 13
restaurants 13
with 13
her 13
and 13
leaving 13
her 13
at 13
a 13
table 13
sauntered 13
about 13
chatting 13
with 13
whomsoever 13
he 13
knew 13
though 13
i 13
was 13
curious 13
to 13
see 13
her 13
i 13
had 13
no 13
desire 13
to 13
meet 13
herbut 13
i 13
did 13
i 13
went 13
up 13
to 13
new 13
york 13
with 13
tom 13
on 13
the 13
train 13
one 13
afternoon 13
and 13
when 13
we 13
stopped 13
by 13
the 13
ashheaps 13
he 13
jumped 13
to 13
his 13
feet 13
and 13
taking 13
hold 13
of 13
my 13
elbow 13
literally 13
forced 13
me 13
from 13
the 13
car 13
were 13
getting 13
off 13
he 13
insisted 13
i 13
want 13
you 13
to 13
meet 13
my 13
girl 13
i 13
think 13
hed 13
tanked 13
up 13
a 13
good 13
deal 13
at 13
luncheon 13
and 13
his 13
determination 13
to 13
have 13
my 13
company 13
bordered 13
on 13
violence 13
the 13
supercilious 13
assumption 13
was 13
that 13
on 13
sunday 13
afternoon 13
i 13
had 13
nothing 13
better 13
to 13
do 13
i 13
followed 13
him 13
over 13
a 13
low 13
whitewashed 13
railroad 13
fence 13
and 13
we 13
walked 13
back 13
a 13
hundred 13
yards 13
along 13
the 13
road 13
under 13
doctor 13
eckleburgs 13
persistent 13
stare 13
the 13
only 13
building 13
in 13
sight 13
was 13
a 13
small 13
block 13
of 13
yellow 13
brick 13
sitting 13
on 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
the 13
waste 13
land 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
compact 13
main 13
street 13
ministering 13
to 13
it 13
and 13
contiguous 13
to 13
absolutely 13
nothing 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
three 13
shops 13
it 13
contained 13
was 13
for 13
rent 13
and 13
another 13
was 13
an 13
allnight 13
restaurant 13
approached 13
by 13
a 13
trail 13
of 13
ashes 13
the 13
third 13
was 13
a 13

and 13
soldand 13
i 13
followed 13
tom 13
inside 13
the 13
interior 13
was 13
unprosperous 13
and 13
bare 13
the 13
only 13
car 13
visible 13
was 13
the 13
dustcovered 13
wreck 13
of 13
a 13
ford 13
which 13
crouched 13
in 13
a 13
dim 13
corner 13
it 13
had 13
occurred 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
this 13
shadow 13
of 13
a 13
garage 13
must 13
be 13
a 13
blind 13
and 13
that 13
sumptuous 13
and 13
romantic 13
apartments 13
were 13
concealed 13
overhead 13
when 13
the 13
proprietor 13
himself 13
appeared 13
in 13
the 13
door 13
of 13
an 13
office 13
wiping 13
his 13
hands 13
on 13
a 13
piece 13
of 13
waste 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
blond 13
spiritless 13
man 13
anaemic 13
and 13
faintly 13
handsome 13
when 13
he 13
saw 13
us 13
a 13
damp 13
gleam 13
of 13
hope 13
sprang 13
into 13
his 13
light 13
blue 13
eyes 13
hello 13
wilson 13
old 13
man 13
said 13
tom 13
slapping 13
him 13
jovially 13
on 13
the 13
shoulder 13
hows 13
business 13
i 13
cant 13
complain 13
answered 13
wilson 13
unconvincingly 13
when 13
are 13

going 13
to 13
sell 13
me 13
that 13
car 13

pretty 13
slow 13
dont 13
he 13
no 13
he 13
doesnt 13
said 13
tom 13
coldly 13
and 13
if 13
you 13
feel 13
that 13
way 13
about 13
it 13
maybe 13
id 13

it 13
somewhere 13
else 13
after 13
all 13
i 13
dont 13
mean 13
that 13
explained 13
wilson 13
quickly 13
i 13
just 13
meant 13
his 13
voice 13
faded 13
off 13
and 13
tom 13
glanced 13
impatiently 13
around 13
the 13
garage 13
then 13
i 13
heard 13
footsteps 13
on 13
a 13
stairs 13
and 13
in 13
a 13
moment 13
the 13
thickish 13
figure 13
of 13
a 13
woman 13
blocked 13
out 13
the 13
light 13
from 13
the 13
office 13
door 13
she 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
middle 13
thirties 13
and 13
faintly 13
stout 13
but 13
she 13
carried 13
her 13
surplus 13
flesh 13
sensuously 13
as 13
some 13
women 13
can 13
her 13
face 13
above 13
a 13
spotted 13
dress 13
of 13
dark 13
blue 13
crepedechine 13
contained 13
no 13
facet 13
or 13
gleam 13
of 13
beauty 13
but 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
immediately 13
perceptible 13
vitality 13
about 13
her 13
as 13
if 13
the 13
nerves 13
of 13
her 13
body 13
were 13
continually 13
smouldering 13
she 13
smiled 13
slowly 13
and 13
walking 13
through 13
her 13
husband 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
were 13
a 13
ghost 13
shook 13
hands 13
with 13
tom 13
looking 13
him 13
flush 13
in 13
the 13
eye 13
then 13
she 13
wet 13
her 13
lips 13
and 13
without 13
turning 13
around 13
spoke 13
to 13
her 13
husband 13
in 13
a 13
soft 13
coarse 13
voice 13
get 13
some 13
chairs 13
why 13
dont 13
you 13
so 13
somebody 13
can 13
sit 13
down 13
oh 13
sure 13
agreed 13
wilson 13
hurriedly 13
and 13
went 13
toward 13
the 13
little 13
office 13
mingling 13
immediately 13
with 13
the 13
cement 13
color 13
of 13
the 13
walls 13
a 13
white 13
ashen 13
dust 13
veiled 13
his 13
dark 13
suit 13
and 13
his 13
pale 13
hair 13
as 13

discreetly 13
in 13
another 13
car 13
tom 13
deferred 13
that 13
much 13
to 13
the 13
sensibilities 13
of 13
those 13
east 13
eggers 13
who 13
might 13
be 13
on 13
the 13
train 13

had 13
changed 13
her 13
dress 13
to 13
a 13
brown 13
figured 13
muslin 13
which 13
stretched 13
tight 13
over 13
her 13
rather 13
wide 13
hips 13
as 13
tom 13
helped 13
her 13
to 13
the 13
platform 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
at 13
the 13

and 13
a 13
movingpicture 13
magazine 13

in 13
the 13
station 13
drugstore 13
some 13
cold 13
cream 13
and 13
a 13
small 13
flask 13
of 13
perfume 13
upstairs 13
in 13
the 13
solemn 13
echoing 13
drive 13
she 13
let 13
four 13
taxicabs 13
drive 13
away 13
before 13
she 13
selected 13
a 13
new 13
one 13
lavendercolored 13
with 13
gray 13
upholstery 13
and 13
in 13
this 13
we 13
slid 13
out 13
from 13
the 13
mass 13
of 13
the 13
station 13
into 13
the 13
glowing 13
sunshine 13
but 13
immediately 13
she 13
turned 13
sharply 13
from 13
the 13
window 13
and 13
leaning 13
forward 13
tapped 13
on 13
the 13
front 13
glass 13

backed 13
up 13
to 13
a 13
gray 13
old 13
man 13
who 13
bore 13
an 13
absurd 13
resemblance 13
to 13
john 13
d 13
rockefeller 13
in 13
a 13
basket 13
swung 13
from 13
his 13
neck 13
cowered 13
a 13
dozen 13
very 13
recent 13
puppies 13
of 13
an 13
indeterminate 13
breed 13
what 13
kind 13

they 13
asked 13
mrs 13

eagerly 13
as 13
he 13
came 13
to 13
the 13
taxiwindow 13

kind 13
the 13
man 13
peered 13
doubtfully 13
into 13
the 13
basket 13
plunged 13
in 13
his 13
hand 13
and 13
drew 13
one 13
up 13
wriggling 13
by 13
the 13
back 13
of 13
the 13
neck 13

the 13
man 13
with 13
disappointment 13
in 13
his 13
voice 13
its 13
more 13
of 13
an 13
airedale 13

passed 13
his 13
hand 13
over 13
the 13

enthusiastically 13
how 13

where 13
she 13
fondled 13

rapture 13

and 13
of 13

small 13

a 13
bath 13
the 13
livingroom 13
was 13
crowded 13
to 13
the 13
doors 13
with 13
a 13
set 13
of 13
tapestried 13
furniture 13
entirely 13
too 13
large 13
for 13
it 13
so 13
that 13
to 13
move 13
about 13
was 13
to 13
stumble 13
continually 13
over 13
scenes 13
of 13
ladies 13
swinging 13
in 13
the 13
gardens 13
of 13

only 13

an 13
overenlarged 13
photograph 13
apparently 13
a 13
hen 13
sitting 13
on 13
a 13
blurred 13
rock 13
looked 13
at 13
from 13
a 13
distance 13
however 13
the 13
hen 13
resolved 13
itself 13
into 13
a 13
bonnet 13
and 13
the 13
countenance 13
of 13
a 13
stout 13
old 13
lady 13
beamed 13
down 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
several 13
old 13
copies 13
of 13
town 13
tattle 13
lay 13
on 13
the 13
table 13
together 13
with 13
a 13
copy 13
of 13
simon 13
called 13
peter 13
and 13
some 13
of 13
the 13
small 13
scandal 13
magazines 13
of 13
broadway 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
was 13
first 13
concerned 13
with 13
the 13
dog 13
a 13
reluctant 13
elevatorboy 13
went 13
for 13
a 13
box 13
full 13
of 13
straw 13
and 13
some 13
milk 13
to 13
which 13
he 13
added 13
on 13
his 13
own 13
initiative 13
a 13
tin 13
of 13
large 13
hard 13
dogbiscuitsone 13
of 13
which 13
decomposed 13
apathetically 13
in 13
the 13
saucer 13
of 13
milk 13
all 13
afternoon 13
meanwhile 13
tom 13
brought 13
out 13
a 13
bottle 13
of 13
whiskey 13
from 13
a 13
locked 13
bureau 13
door 13
i 13
have 13
been 13
drunk 13
just 13
twice 13
in 13
my 13
life 13
and 13
the 13
second 13
time 13
was 13
that 13
afternoon 13
so 13
everything 13
that 13
happened 13
has 13
a 13
dim 13
hazy 13
cast 13
over 13
it 13
although 13
until 13
after 13
eight 13
oclock 13
the 13
apartment 13
was 13
full 13
of 13
cheerful 13
sun 13
sitting 13
on 13
toms 13
lap 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
called 13
up 13
several 13
people 13
on 13
the 13
telephone 13
then 13
there 13
were 13
no 13
cigarettes 13
and 13
i 13
went 13
out 13
to 13
buy 13
some 13
at 13
the 13
drugstore 13
on 13
the 13
corner 13
when 13
i 13
came 13
back 13
they 13
had 13
disappeared 13
so 13
i 13
sat 13
down 13
discreetly 13
in 13
the 13
livingroom 13
and 13
read 13
a 13
chapter 13
of 13
simon 13
called 13
petereither 13
it 13
was 13
terrible 13
stuff 13
or 13
the 13
whiskey 13
distorted 13
things 13
because 13
it 13
didnt 13
make 13
any 13
sense 13
to 13
me 13
just 13
as 13
tom 13
and 13
myrtle 13
after 13
the 13
first 13
drink 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
and 13
i 13
called 13
each 13
other 13
by 13
our 13
first 13
names 13
reappeared 13
company 13
commenced 13
to 13
arrive 13
at 13
the 13
apartmentdoor 13
the 13
sister 13
catherine 13
was 13
a 13
slender 13
worldly 13
girl 13
of 13
about 13
thirty 13
with 13
a 13
solid 13
sticky 13
bob 13
of 13
red 13
hair 13
and 13
a 13
complexion 13
powdered 13
milky 13
white 13
her 13
eyebrows 13
had 13
been 13
plucked 13
and 13
then 13
drawn 13
on 13
again 13
at 13
a 13
more 13
rakish 13
angle 13
but 13
the 13
efforts 13
of 13
nature 13
toward 13
the 13
restoration 13
of 13
the 13
old 13
alignment 13
gave 13
a 13
blurred 13
air 13
to 13
her 13
face 13
when 13
she 13
moved 13
about 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
incessant 13
clicking 13
as 13
innumerable 13
pottery 13
bracelets 13
jingled 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
upon 13
her 13
arms 13
she 13
came 13
in 13
with 13
such 13
a 13
proprietary 13
haste 13
and 13
looked 13
around 13
so 13
possessively 13
at 13
the 13
furniture 13
that 13
i 13
wondered 13
if 13
she 13
lived 13
here 13
but 13
when 13
i 13
asked 13
her 13
she 13
laughed 13
immoderately 13
repeated 13
my 13
question 13
aloud 13
and 13
told 13
me 13
she 13
lived 13
with 13
a 13
girl 13
friend 13
at 13
a 13
hotel 13
mr 13
mckee 13
was 13
a 13
pale 13
feminine 13
man 13
from 13
the 13
flat 13
below 13
he 13
had 13
just 13
shaved 13
for 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
white 13
spot 13
of 13
lather 13
on 13
his 13
cheekbone 13
and 13
he 13
was 13
most 13
respectful 13
in 13
his 13
greeting 13
to 13
every 13
one 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
he 13
informed 13
me 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
artistic 13
game 13
and 13
i 13
gathered 13
later 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
photographer 13
and 13
had 13
made 13
the 13
dim 13
enlargement 13
of 13
mrs 13
wilsons 13
mother 13
which 13
hovered 13
like 13
an 13
ectoplasm 13
on 13
the 13
wall 13
his 13
wife 13
was 13
shrill 13
languid 13
handsome 13
and 13
horrible 13
she 13
told 13
me 13
with 13
pride 13
that 13
her 13
husband 13
had 13
photographed 13
her 13
a 13
hundred 13
and 13
twentyseven 13
times 13
since 13
they 13
had 13
been 13
married 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
had 13
changed 13
her 13
costume 13
some 13
time 13
before 13
and 13
was 13
now 13
attired 13
in 13
an 13
elaborate 13
afternoon 13
dress 13
of 13
creamcolored 13
chiffon 13
which 13
gave 13
out 13
a 13
continual 13
rustle 13
as 13
she 13
swept 13
about 13
the 13
room 13
with 13
the 13
influence 13
of 13
the 13
dress 13
her 13
personality 13
had 13
also 13
undergone 13
a 13
change 13
the 13
intense 13
vitality 13
that 13
had 13
been 13
so 13
remarkable 13
in 13
the 13
garage 13
was 13
converted 13
into 13
impressive 13
hauteur 13
her 13
laughter 13
her 13
gestures 13
her 13
assertions 13
became 13
more 13
violently 13
affected 13
moment 13
by 13
moment 13
and 13
as 13
she 13
expanded 13
the 13
room 13
grew 13
smaller 13
around 13
her 13
until 13
she 13
seemed 13
to 13
be 13
revolving 13
on 13
a 13
noisy 13
creaking 13
pivot 13
through 13
the 13
smoky 13
air 13
my 13
dear 13
she 13
told 13
her 13
sister 13
in 13
a 13
high 13
mincing 13
shout 13
most 13
of 13
these 13
fellas 13
will 13
cheat 13
you 13
every 13
time 13
all 13
they 13
think 13
of 13
is 13
money 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
woman 13
up 13
here 13
last 13
week 13
to 13
look 13
at 13
my 13
feet 13
and 13
when 13
she 13
gave 13
me 13
the 13
bill 13
youd 13
of 13
thought 13
she 13
had 13
my 13
appendicitis 13
out 13
what 13
was 13
the 13
name 13
of 13
the 13
woman 13
asked 13
mrs 13
mckee 13
mrs 13
eberhardt 13
she 13
goes 13
around 13
looking 13
at 13
peoples 13
feet 13
in 13
their 13
own 13
homes 13
i 13
like 13
your 13
dress 13
remarked 13
mrs 13
mckee 13
i 13
think 13
its 13
adorable 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
rejected 13
the 13
compliment 13
by 13
raising 13
her 13
eyebrow 13
in 13
disdain 13
its 13
just 13
a 13
crazy 13
old 13
thing 13
she 13
said 13
i 13
just 13
slip 13
it 13
on 13
sometimes 13
when 13
i 13
dont 13
care 13
what 13
i 13
look 13
like 13
but 13
it 13
looks 13
wonderful 13
on 13
you 13
if 13
you 13
know 13
what 13
i 13
mean 13
pursued 13
mrs 13
mckee 13
if 13
chester 13
could 13
only 13
get 13
you 13
in 13
that 13
pose 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
could 13
make 13
something 13
of 13
it 13
we 13
all 13
looked 13
in 13
silence 13
at 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
who 13
removed 13
a 13
strand 13
of 13
hair 13
from 13
over 13
her 13
eyes 13
and 13
looked 13
back 13
at 13
us 13
with 13
a 13
brilliant 13
smile 13
mr 13
mckee 13
regarded 13
her 13
intently 13
with 13
his 13
head 13
on 13
one 13
side 13
and 13
then 13
moved 13
his 13
hand 13
back 13
and 13
forth 13
slowly 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
his 13
face 13
i 13
should 13
change 13
the 13
light 13
he 13
said 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
id 13
like 13
to 13
bring 13
out 13
the 13
modelling 13
of 13
the 13
features 13
and 13
id 13
try 13
to 13
get 13
hold 13
of 13
all 13
the 13
back 13
hair 13
i 13
wouldnt 13
think 13
of 13
changing 13
the 13
light 13
cried 13
mrs 13
mckee 13
i 13
think 13
its 13
her 13
husband 13
said 13
sh 13
and 13
we 13
all 13
looked 13
at 13
the 13
subject 13
again 13
whereupon 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
yawned 13
audibly 13
and 13
got 13
to 13
his 13
feet 13

boy 13
about 13
the 13
ice 13
myrtle 13
raised 13
her 13
eyebrows 13
in 13
despair 13
at 13
the 13
shiftlessness 13
of 13
the 13
lower 13
orders 13
these 13
people 13
you 13
have 13
to 13
keep 13
after 13
them 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
and 13
laughed 13
pointlessly 13
then 13
she 13
flounced 13
over 13
to 13
the 13
dog 13
kissed 13
it 13
with 13
ecstasy 13
and 13
swept 13
into 13
the 13
kitchen 13
implying 13
that 13
a 13
dozen 13
chefs 13
awaited 13

a 13
bored 13
way 13
and 13
turned 13
his 13
attention 13
to 13

said 13
tom 13
breaking 13
into 13
a 13
short 13
shout 13
of 13
laughter 13
as 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
entered 13
with 13
a 13
tray 13
shell 13
give 13

his 13
lips 13
moved 13
silently 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
as 13
he 13
invented 13
george 13
b 13
wilson 13
at 13
the 13
gasoline 13
pump 13
or 13
something 13
like 13

catherine 13
leaned 13
close 13
to 13
me 13
and 13
whispered 13
in 13
my 13
ear 13

at 13
tom 13
what 13

she 13

was 13
unexpected 13
it 13
came 13
from 13
myrtle 13
who 13
had 13
overheard 13
the 13
question 13

it 13

violent 13
and 13
obscene 13

catherine 13
triumphantly 13
she 13
lowered 13

voice 13

catholic 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
a 13
little 13
shocked 13
at 13
the 13
elaborateness 13
of 13
the 13
lie 13
when 13
they 13
do 13
get 13

catherine 13
theyre 13
going 13
west 13

in 13
the 13

for 13
a 13
moment 13
like 13
the 13
blue 13
honey 13
of 13
the 13
mediterraneanthen 13
the 13
shrill 13
voice 13
of 13

myrtle 13
ambiguously 13
and 13

the 13
difference 13

you 13
to 13
myrtle 13
considered 13

because 13
i 13
thought 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
gentleman 13
she 13
said 13
finally 13
i 13
thought 13
he 13
knew 13
something 13
about 13
breeding 13
but 13
he 13
wasnt 13
fit 13
to 13

my 13
shoe 13

myrtle 13
incredulously 13
who 13

crazy 13
about 13
him 13
i 13
never 13
was 13
any 13
more 13
crazy 13
about 13
him 13
than 13
i 13
was 13
about 13
that 13
man 13
there 13
she 13
pointed 13
suddenly 13
at 13
me 13
and 13
every 13
one 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
accusingly 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
show 13
by 13
my 13
expression 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
played 13
no 13
part 13
in 13
her 13
past 13

about 13
it 13
and 13
the 13
man 13
came 13
after 13
it 13
one 13
day 13
when 13
he 13
was 13
out 13
oh 13

about 13
it 13
but 13
i 13
gave 13
it 13
to 13
him 13
and 13
then 13
i 13
lay 13
down 13
and 13
cried 13
to 13
beat 13
the 13
band 13
all 13
afternoon 13
she 13
really 13
ought 13
to 13
get 13
away 13
from 13
him 13
resumed 13
catherine 13
to 13
me 13
theyve 13
been 13
living 13
over 13
that 13
garage 13
for 13
eleven 13
years 13
and 13
toms 13
the 13
first 13
sweetie 13
she 13
ever 13
had 13
the 13
bottle 13
of 13
whiskeya 13
second 13
onewas 13
now 13
in 13
constant 13
demand 13
by 13
all 13
present 13
excepting 13
catherine 13
who 13
felt 13
just 13
as 13
good 13
on 13
nothing 13
at 13
all 13
tom 13
rang 13
for 13
the 13
janitor 13
and 13
sent 13
him 13
for 13
some 13
celebrated 13
sandwiches 13
which 13
were 13
a 13
complete 13
supper 13
in 13
themselves 13
i 13
wanted 13
to 13
get 13
out 13
and 13
walk 13
southward 13
toward 13
the 13
park 13
through 13
the 13
soft 13
twilight 13
but 13
each 13
time 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
go 13
i 13
became 13
entangled 13
in 13
some 13
wild 13
strident 13
argument 13
which 13
pulled 13
me 13
back 13
as 13
if 13
with 13
ropes 13
into 13
my 13
chair 13
yet 13
high 13
over 13
the 13
city 13
our 13
line 13
of 13
yellow 13
windows 13
must 13
have 13
contributed 13
their 13
share 13
of 13
human 13
secrecy 13
to 13
the 13
casual 13
watcher 13
in 13
the 13
darkening 13
streets 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
him 13
too 13
looking 13
up 13
and 13
wondering 13
i 13
was 13
within 13
and 13
without 13
simultaneously 13
enchanted 13
and 13
repelled 13
by 13
the 13
inexhaustible 13
variety 13
of 13
life 13
myrtle 13
pulled 13
her 13
chair 13
close 13
to 13
mine 13
and 13
suddenly 13
her 13
warm 13
breath 13
poured 13
over 13
me 13
the 13
story 13
of 13
her 13
first 13
meeting 13
with 13
tom 13
it 13
was 13
on 13
the 13
two 13
little 13
seats 13
facing 13
each 13
other 13
that 13
are 13
always 13
the 13
last 13
ones 13
left 13

keep 13
my 13
eyes 13
off 13
him 13
but 13
every 13
time 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
i 13
had 13
to 13
pretend 13
to 13
be 13
looking 13
at 13
the 13
advertisement 13
over 13
his 13
head 13
when 13

into 13

was 13
next 13
to 13
me 13
and 13
his 13
white 13
shirtfront 13
pressed 13
against 13

arm 13
and 13
so 13
i 13
told 13

with 13
his 13
fists 13
clenched 13
in 13
his 13
lap 13
like 13
a 13
photograph 13
of 13
a 13
man 13
of 13
action 13
taking 13
out 13

through 13

in 13
impassioned 13
voices 13
whether 13
mrs 13

with 13
his 13
open 13

awoke 13
from 13

doze 13
and 13
started 13
in 13
a 13
daze 13
toward 13
the 13
door 13
when 13
he 13
had 13
gone 13

there 13
among 13
the 13
crowded 13
furniture 13
with 13
articles 13
of 13
aid 13
and 13
the 13
despairing 13
figure 13
on 13
the 13
couch 13
bleeding 13
fluently 13
and 13
trying 13
to 13

a 13
copy 13
of 13

tattle 13
over 13
the 13

his 13
guests 13
diving 13
from 13
the 13
tower 13
of 13
his 13
raft 13

taking 13
the 13
sun 13
on 13
the 13
hot 13
sand 13
of 13
his 13

dressing 13
upstairs 13
the 13
cars 13
from 13
new 13

are 13
parked 13
five 13
deep 13
in 13
the 13

and 13
already 13
the 13
halls 13
and 13
salons 13
and 13
verandas 13
are 13
gaudy 13
with 13
primary 13
colors 13
and 13
hair 13
shorn 13
in 13
strange 13
new 13
ways 13
and 13
shawls 13
beyond 13
the 13
dreams 13
of 13
castile 13
the 13
bar 13
is 13
in 13
full 13
swing 13
and 13
floating 13
rounds 13
of 13
cocktails 13
permeate 13
the 13
garden 13
outside 13
until 13
the 13
air 13
is 13
alive 13
with 13
chatter 13
and 13
laughter 13
and 13
casual 13
innuendo 13
and 13
introductions 13
forgotten 13
on 13
the 13
spot 13
and 13
enthusiastic 13
meetings 13
between 13
women 13
who 13
never 13
knew 13
each 13
others 13
names 13
the 13
lights 13
grow 13
brighter 13
as 13
the 13
earth 13
lurches 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
sun 13
and 13
now 13
the 13
orchestra 13
is 13
playing 13
yellow 13
cocktail 13
music 13
and 13
the 13
opera 13
of 13
voices 13
pitches 13
a 13
key 13
higher 13
laughter 13
is 13
easier 13
minute 13
by 13
minute 13
spilled 13
with 13
prodigality 13
tipped 13
out 13
at 13
a 13
cheerful 13
word 13
the 13
groups 13
change 13
more 13
swiftly 13
swell 13
with 13
new 13
arrivals 13
dissolve 13
and 13
form 13
in 13
the 13
same 13
breath 13
already 13
there 13
are 13
wanderers 13
confident 13
girls 13
who 13
weave 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
among 13
the 13
stouter 13
and 13
more 13
stable 13
become 13
for 13
a 13
sharp 13
joyous 13
moment 13
the 13
centre 13
of 13
a 13
group 13
and 13
then 13
excited 13
with 13
triumph 13
glide 13
on 13
through 13
the 13
seachange 13
of 13
faces 13
and 13
voices 13
and 13
color 13
under 13
the 13
constantly 13
changing 13
light 13
suddenly 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
gypsies 13
in 13
trembling 13
opal 13
seizes 13
a 13
cocktail 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
air 13
dumps 13
it 13
down 13
for 13
courage 13
and 13
moving 13
her 13
hands 13
like 13
frisco 13
dances 13
out 13
alone 13
on 13
the 13
canvas 13
platform 13
a 13
momentary 13
hush 13
the 13
orchestra 13
leader 13
varies 13
his 13
rhythm 13
obligingly 13
for 13
her 13
and 13
there 13
is 13
a 13
burst 13
of 13
chatter 13
as 13
the 13
erroneous 13
news 13
goes 13
around 13
that 13
she 13
is 13
gilda 13
grays 13
understudy 13
from 13
the 13
follies 13
the 13
party 13
has 13
begun 13
i 13
believe 13
that 13
on 13
the 13
first 13
night 13
i 13
went 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
i 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
few 13
guests 13
who 13
had 13
actually 13
been 13
invited 13
people 13
were 13
not 13
invitedthey 13
went 13
there 13
they 13
got 13
into 13
automobiles 13
which 13
bore 13
them 13
out 13
to 13
long 13
island 13
and 13
somehow 13
they 13
ended 13
up 13
at 13
gatsbys 13
door 13
once 13
there 13
they 13
were 13
introduced 13
by 13
somebody 13
who 13
knew 13
gatsby 13
and 13
after 13
that 13
they 13
conducted 13
themselves 13
according 13
to 13
the 13
rules 13
of 13
behavior 13
associated 13
with 13
amusement 13
parks 13
sometimes 13
they 13
came 13
and 13
went 13
without 13
having 13
met 13
gatsby 13
at 13
all 13
came 13
for 13
the 13
party 13
with 13
a 13
simplicity 13
of 13
heart 13
that 13
was 13
its 13
own 13
ticket 13
of 13
admission 13
i 13
had 13
been 13
actually 13
invited 13
a 13
chauffeur 13
in 13
a 13
uniform 13
of 13
robinsegg 13
blue 13
crossed 13
my 13
lawn 13
early 13
that 13
saturday 13
morning 13
with 13
a 13
surprisingly 13
formal 13
note 13
from 13
his 13
employer 13
the 13
honor 13
would 13
be 13
entirely 13
gatsbys 13
it 13
said 13
if 13
i 13
would 13
attend 13
his 13
little 13
party 13
that 13
night 13
he 13
had 13
seen 13
me 13
several 13
times 13
and 13
had 13
intended 13
to 13
call 13
on 13
me 13
long 13
before 13
but 13
a 13
peculiar 13
combination 13
of 13
circumstances 13
had 13
prevented 13
itsigned 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
in 13
a 13
majestic 13
hand 13
dressed 13
up 13
in 13
white 13
flannels 13
i 13
went 13
over 13
to 13
his 13
lawn 13
a 13
little 13
after 13
seven 13
and 13
wandered 13
around 13
rather 13
ill 13
at 13
ease 13
among 13
swirls 13
and 13
eddies 13
of 13
people 13
i 13
didnt 13
knowthough 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
face 13
i 13
had 13
noticed 13
on 13
the 13
commuting 13
train 13
i 13
was 13
immediately 13
struck 13
by 13
the 13
number 13
of 13
young 13
englishmen 13
dotted 13
about 13
all 13
well 13
dressed 13
all 13
looking 13
a 13
little 13
hungry 13
and 13
all 13
talking 13
in 13
low 13
earnest 13
voices 13
to 13
solid 13
and 13
prosperous 13
americans 13
i 13
was 13
sure 13
that 13
they 13
were 13
selling 13
something 13
bonds 13
or 13
insurance 13
or 13
automobiles 13
they 13
were 13
at 13
least 13
agonizingly 13
aware 13
of 13
the 13
easy 13
money 13
in 13
the 13
vicinity 13
and 13
convinced 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
theirs 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
words 13
in 13
the 13
right 13
key 13
as 13
soon 13
as 13
i 13
arrived 13
i 13
made 13
an 13
attempt 13
to 13
find 13
my 13
host 13
but 13
the 13
two 13
or 13
three 13
people 13
of 13
whom 13
i 13
asked 13
his 13
whereabouts 13
stared 13
at 13
me 13
in 13
such 13
an 13
amazed 13
way 13
and 13
denied 13
so 13
vehemently 13
any 13
knowledge 13
of 13
his 13
movements 13
that 13
i 13
slunk 13
off 13
in 13
the 13
direction 13
of 13
the 13
cocktail 13
tablethe 13
only 13
place 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13
where 13
a 13
single 13
man 13
could 13
linger 13
without 13
looking 13
purposeless 13
and 13
alone 13
i 13
was 13
on 13
my 13
way 13
to 13
get 13
roaring 13
drunk 13
from 13
sheer 13
embarrassment 13
when 13
jordan 13
baker 13
came 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
and 13
stood 13
at 13
the 13
head 13
of 13
the 13
marble 13
steps 13
leaning 13
a 13
little 13
backward 13
and 13
looking 13
with 13
contemptuous 13
interest 13
down 13
into 13
the 13
garden 13
welcome 13
or 13
not 13
i 13
found 13
it 13
necessary 13
to 13
attach 13
myself 13
to 13
some 13
one 13
before 13
i 13
should 13
begin 13
to 13
address 13
cordial 13
remarks 13
to 13
the 13
passersby 13
hello 13
i 13
roared 13
advancing 13
toward 13
her 13
my 13
voice 13
seemed 13
unnaturally 13
loud 13
across 13
the 13
garden 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
might 13
be 13
here 13
she 13
responded 13
absently 13
as 13
i 13
came 13
up 13
i 13
remembered 13
you 13
lived 13
next 13
door 13
to 13
she 13
held 13
my 13
hand 13
impersonally 13
as 13
a 13
promise 13
that 13
shed 13
take 13
care 13
of 13
me 13
in 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
gave 13
ear 13
to 13
two 13
girls 13
in 13
twin 13
yellow 13
dresses 13
who 13
stopped 13
at 13
the 13
foot 13
of 13
the 13
steps 13
hello 13
they 13
cried 13
together 13
sorry 13
you 13
didnt 13
win 13
that 13
was 13
for 13
the 13
golf 13
tournament 13
she 13
had 13
lost 13
in 13
the 13
finals 13
the 13
week 13
before 13
you 13
dont 13
know 13
who 13
we 13
are 13
said 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
girls 13
in 13
yellow 13
but 13
we 13
met 13
you 13
here 13
about 13
a 13
month 13
ago 13
youve 13
dyed 13
your 13
hair 13
since 13
then 13
remarked 13
jordan 13
and 13
i 13
started 13
but 13
the 13
girls 13
had 13
moved 13
casually 13
on 13
and 13
her 13
remark 13
was 13
addressed 13
to 13
the 13
premature 13
moon 13
produced 13
like 13
the 13
supper 13
no 13
doubt 13
out 13
of 13
a 13
caterers 13
basket 13
with 13
jordans 13
slender 13
golden 13
arm 13
resting 13
in 13
mine 13
we 13
descended 13
the 13
steps 13
and 13
sauntered 13
about 13
the 13
garden 13
a 13
tray 13
of 13
cocktails 13
floated 13
at 13
us 13
through 13
the 13
twilight 13
and 13
we 13
sat 13
down 13
at 13
a 13
table 13
with 13
the 13
two 13
girls 13
in 13
yellow 13
and 13
three 13
men 13
each 13
one 13
introduced 13
to 13
us 13
as 13
mr 13
mumble 13
do 13
you 13
come 13
to 13

to 13

fellow 13
thatll 13
do 13
a 13
thing 13
like 13
that 13
said 13
the 13
other 13
girl 13
eagerly 13
he 13
doesnt 13
want 13
any 13
trouble 13
with 13
anybody 13
who 13
doesnt 13
i 13
inquired 13
gatsby 13
somebody 13
told 13
me 13
the 13
two 13
girls 13
and 13
jordan 13
leaned 13
together 13
confidentially 13
somebody 13
told 13
me 13
they 13
thought 13
he 13
killed 13
a 13
man 13
once 13
a 13
thrill 13
passed 13
over 13
all 13
of 13
us 13
the 13
three 13
mr 13
mumbles 13
bent 13
forward 13
and 13
listened 13
eagerly 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
its 13
so 13
much 13
that 13
argued 13
lucille 13
sceptically 13
its 13
more 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
german 13
spy 13
during 13
the 13
war 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
men 13
nodded 13
in 13
confirmation 13
i 13
heard 13
that 13
from 13
a 13
man 13
who 13
knew 13
all 13
about 13
him 13
grew 13
up 13
with 13
him 13
in 13
germany 13
he 13
assured 13
us 13
positively 13
oh 13
no 13
said 13
the 13
first 13
girl 13
it 13
couldnt 13
be 13
that 13
because 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
american 13
army 13
during 13
the 13
war 13
as 13
our 13
credulity 13
switched 13
back 13
to 13
her 13
she 13
leaned 13
forward 13
with 13
enthusiasm 13
you 13
look 13
at 13
him 13
sometimes 13
when 13
he 13
thinks 13
nobodys 13
looking 13
at 13
him 13
ill 13
bet 13
he 13
killed 13
a 13
man 13
she 13
narrowed 13
her 13
eyes 13
and 13
shivered 13
lucille 13
shivered 13
we 13
all 13
turned 13
and 13
looked 13
around 13
for 13
gatsby 13
it 13
was 13
testimony 13
to 13
the 13
romantic 13
speculation 13
he 13
inspired 13
that 13
there 13
were 13
whispers 13
about 13
him 13
from 13
those 13
who 13
found 13
little 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
necessary 13
to 13
whisper 13
about 13
in 13
this 13
world 13
the 13
first 13
supperthere 13
would 13
be 13
another 13
one 13
after 13
midnightwas 13
now 13
being 13
served 13
and 13
jordan 13
invited 13
me 13
to 13
join 13
her 13
own 13
party 13
who 13
were 13
spread 13
around 13
a 13
table 13
on 13
the 13
other 13
side 13
of 13
the 13
garden 13
there 13
were 13
three 13
married 13
couples 13
and 13
jordans 13
escort 13
a 13
persistent 13
undergraduate 13
given 13
to 13
violent 13
innuendo 13
and 13
obviously 13
under 13
the 13
impression 13
that 13
sooner 13
or 13
later 13
jordan 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
yield 13
him 13
up 13
her 13
person 13
to 13
a 13
greater 13
or 13
lesser 13
degree 13
instead 13
of 13
rambling 13
this 13
party 13
had 13
preserved 13
a 13
dignified 13
homogeneity 13
and 13
assumed 13
to 13
itself 13
the 13
function 13
of 13
representing 13
the 13
staid 13
nobility 13
of 13
the 13
countrysideeast 13
egg 13
condescending 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
and 13
carefully 13
on 13
guard 13
against 13
its 13
spectroscopic 13
gayety 13
lets 13
get 13
out 13
whispered 13
jordan 13
after 13
a 13
somehow 13
wasteful 13
and 13
inappropriate 13
halfhour 13
this 13
is 13
much 13
too 13
polite 13
for 13
me 13
we 13
got 13
up 13
and 13
she 13
explained 13
that 13
we 13
were 13
going 13
to 13
find 13
the 13
host 13
i 13
had 13
never 13
met 13
him 13
she 13
said 13
and 13
it 13
was 13
making 13
me 13
uneasy 13
the 13
undergraduate 13
nodded 13
in 13
a 13
cynical 13
melancholy 13
way 13
the 13
bar 13
where 13
we 13
glanced 13
first 13
was 13
crowded 13
but 13
gatsby 13
was 13
not 13
there 13
she 13
couldnt 13
find 13
him 13
from 13
the 13
top 13
of 13
the 13
steps 13
and 13
he 13
wasnt 13
on 13
the 13
veranda 13
on 13
a 13
chance 13
we 13
tried 13
an 13
importantlooking 13
door 13
and 13
walked 13
into 13
a 13
high 13
gothic 13
library 13
panelled 13
with 13
carved 13
english 13
oak 13
and 13
probably 13
transported 13
complete 13
from 13
some 13
ruin 13
overseas 13
a 13
stout 13
middleaged 13
man 13
with 13
enormous 13
owleyed 13
spectacles 13
was 13
sitting 13
somewhat 13
drunk 13
on 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
a 13
great 13
table 13
staring 13
with 13
unsteady 13
concentration 13
at 13
the 13
shelves 13
of 13
books 13
as 13
we 13
entered 13
he 13
wheeled 13
excitedly 13
around 13
and 13
examined 13
jordan 13
from 13
head 13
to 13
foot 13
what 13
do 13
you 13
think 13
he 13
demanded 13
impetuously 13
about 13
what 13
he 13
waved 13
his 13
hand 13
toward 13
the 13
bookshelves 13
about 13
that 13
as 13
a 13
matter 13
of 13
fact 13
you 13
neednt 13
bother 13
to 13
ascertain 13
i 13
ascertained 13
theyre 13
real 13
the 13
books 13
he 13
nodded 13
absolutely 13
realhave 13
pages 13
and 13
everything 13
i 13
thought 13
theyd 13
be 13
a 13
nice 13
durable 13
cardboard 13
matter 13
of 13
fact 13
theyre 13
absolutely 13
real 13
pages 13
andhere 13
lemme 13
show 13
you 13
taking 13
our 13
scepticism 13
for 13
granted 13
he 13
rushed 13
to 13
the 13
bookcases 13
and 13
returned 13
with 13
volume 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
stoddard 13
lectures 13
see 13
he 13
cried 13
triumphantly 13
its 13
a 13
bonafide 13
piece 13
of 13
printed 13
matter 13
it 13
fooled 13
me 13
this 13
fellas 13
a 13
regular 13
belasco 13
its 13
a 13
triumph 13
what 13
thoroughness 13
what 13
realism 13

when 13

pages 13
but 13
what 13
do 13
you 13
want 13
what 13
do 13
you 13
expect 13
he 13
snatched 13
the 13
book 13
from 13
me 13
and 13
replaced 13
it 13
hastily 13
on 13
its 13
shelf 13
muttering 13
that 13
if 13
one 13
brick 13
was 13
removed 13
the 13
whole 13
library 13
was 13
liable 13
to 13
collapse 13
who 13
brought 13
you 13
he 13
demanded 13
or 13
did 13

cheerfully 13
without 13
answering 13
i 13
was 13
brought 13
by 13
a 13
woman 13
named 13

about 13
a 13
week 13

thought 13
it 13

up 13
to 13
sit 13
in 13
a 13
library 13

we 13
shook 13
hands 13
with 13
him 13
gravely 13
and 13
went 13
back 13
outdoors 13
there 13
was 13
dancing 13
now 13
on 13
the 13
canvas 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13
old 13
men 13
pushing 13
young 13
girls 13
backward 13
in 13
eternal 13
graceless 13
circles 13
superior 13
couples 13
holding 13
each 13
other 13
tortuously 13
fashionably 13
and 13
keeping 13
in 13
the 13
cornersand 13
a 13
great 13
number 13
of 13
single 13
girls 13
dancing 13
individualistically 13
or 13
relieving 13
the 13
orchestra 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
of 13
the 13
burden 13
of 13
the 13
banjo 13
or 13
the 13
traps 13
by 13
midnight 13
the 13
hilarity 13
had 13
increased 13
a 13
celebrated 13
tenor 13
had 13
sung 13
in 13
italian 13
and 13
a 13
notorious 13
contralto 13
had 13
sung 13
in 13
jazz 13
and 13
between 13
the 13
numbers 13
people 13
were 13
doing 13
stunts 13
all 13
over 13
the 13
garden 13
while 13
happy 13
vacuous 13
bursts 13
of 13
laughter 13
rose 13
toward 13
the 13
summer 13
sky 13
a 13
pair 13
of 13
stage 13
twins 13
who 13
turned 13
out 13
to 13
be 13
the 13
girls 13
in 13
yellow 13
did 13
a 13
baby 13
act 13
in 13
costume 13
and 13
champagne 13
was 13
served 13
in 13
glasses 13
bigger 13
than 13
fingerbowls 13
the 13
moon 13
had 13
risen 13
higher 13
and 13
floating 13
in 13
the 13
sound 13
was 13
a 13
triangle 13
of 13
silver 13
scales 13
trembling 13
a 13
little 13
to 13
the 13
stiff 13
tinny 13
drip 13
of 13
the 13
banjoes 13
on 13
the 13
lawn 13
i 13
was 13
still 13
with 13
jordan 13
baker 13
we 13
were 13
sitting 13
at 13
a 13
table 13
with 13
a 13
man 13
of 13
about 13
my 13
age 13
and 13
a 13
rowdy 13
little 13
girl 13
who 13
gave 13
way 13
upon 13
the 13
slightest 13
provocation 13
to 13
uncontrollable 13
laughter 13
i 13
was 13
enjoying 13
myself 13
now 13
i 13
had 13
taken 13
two 13
fingerbowls 13
of 13
champagne 13
and 13
the 13
scene 13
had 13
changed 13
before 13
my 13
eyes 13
into 13
something 13
significant 13
elemental 13
and 13
profound 13
at 13
a 13
lull 13
in 13
the 13
entertainment 13
the 13
man 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
and 13
smiled 13
your 13
face 13
is 13
familiar 13

said 13
politely 13

lived 13
in 13
this 13
vicinity 13
for 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
just 13
bought 13
a 13
hydroplane 13
and 13

time 13
that 13

on 13
the 13
tip 13
of 13
my 13
tongue 13
to 13
ask 13
his 13
name 13
when 13
jordan 13
looked 13
around 13
and 13
smiled 13
having 13
a 13
gay 13
time 13
now 13
she 13
inquired 13
much 13
better 13
i 13
turned 13
again 13
to 13
my 13
new 13
acquaintance 13
this 13
is 13
an 13
unusual 13
party 13
for 13
me 13
i 13
havent 13
even 13
seen 13
the 13
host 13

live 13
over 13
there 13
i 13
waved 13
my 13
hand 13
at 13
the 13
invisible 13
hedge 13
in 13
the 13
distance 13
and 13
this 13
man 13
gatsby 13
sent 13
over 13
his 13
chauffeur 13
with 13
an 13
invitation 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
failed 13
to 13
understand 13
im 13
gatsby 13
he 13
said 13
suddenly 13
what 13
i 13
exclaimed 13
oh 13
i 13
beg 13
your 13
pardon 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
knew 13
old 13
sport 13
im 13
afraid 13
im 13
not 13
a 13
very 13
good 13
host 13
he 13
smiled 13
understandinglymuch 13
more 13
than 13
understandingly 13
it 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
rare 13
smiles 13
with 13
a 13
quality 13
of 13
eternal 13
reassurance 13
in 13
it 13
that 13
you 13
may 13
come 13
across 13
four 13
or 13
five 13
times 13
in 13
life 13
it 13
facedor 13
seemed 13
to 13
facethe 13
whole 13
external 13
world 13
for 13
an 13
instant 13
and 13
then 13
concentrated 13
on 13
you 13
with 13
an 13
irresistible 13
prejudice 13
in 13
your 13
favor 13
it 13
understood 13
you 13
just 13
so 13
far 13
as 13
you 13
wanted 13
to 13
be 13
understood 13
believed 13
in 13
you 13
as 13
you 13
would 13
like 13
to 13
believe 13
in 13
yourself 13
and 13
assured 13
you 13
that 13
it 13
had 13
precisely 13
the 13
impression 13
of 13
you 13
that 13
at 13
your 13
best 13
you 13
hoped 13
to 13
convey 13
precisely 13
at 13
that 13
point 13
it 13
vanishedand 13
i 13
was 13
looking 13
at 13
an 13
elegant 13
young 13
roughneck 13
a 13
year 13
or 13
two 13
over 13
thirty 13
whose 13
elaborate 13
formality 13
of 13
speech 13
just 13
missed 13
being 13
absurd 13
some 13
time 13
before 13
he 13
introduced 13
himself 13
id 13
got 13
a 13
strong 13
impression 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
picking 13
his 13
words 13
with 13
care 13
almost 13
at 13
the 13
moment 13
when 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
identified 13
himself 13
a 13
butler 13
hurried 13
toward 13
him 13
with 13
the 13
information 13
that 13
chicago 13
was 13
calling 13
him 13
on 13
the 13
wire 13
he 13
excused 13
himself 13
with 13
a 13
small 13
bow 13
that 13
included 13
each 13
of 13
us 13
in 13
turn 13
if 13
you 13
want 13
anything 13
just 13
ask 13
for 13
it 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
urged 13
me 13
excuse 13
me 13
i 13
will 13
rejoin 13
you 13
later 13
when 13
he 13
was 13
gone 13
i 13
turned 13
immediately 13
to 13
jordanconstrained 13
to 13
assure 13
her 13
of 13
my 13
surprise 13
i 13
had 13
expected 13
that 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
would 13
be 13
a 13
florid 13
and 13
corpulent 13
person 13
in 13
his 13
middle 13
years 13
who 13
is 13
he 13
i 13
demanded 13
do 13
you 13
know 13
hes 13
just 13
a 13
man 13
named 13
gatsby 13
where 13
is 13
he 13
from 13
i 13
mean 13
and 13
what 13
does 13
he 13
do 13
now 13
youre 13
started 13
on 13
the 13
subject 13
she 13
answered 13
with 13
a 13
wan 13
smile 13
well 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
once 13
he 13
was 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
a 13
dim 13
background 13
started 13
to 13
take 13
shape 13
behind 13
him 13
but 13
at 13
her 13
next 13
remark 13
it 13
faded 13
away 13
however 13
i 13
dont 13
believe 13
it 13
why 13
not 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
she 13
insisted 13
i 13
just 13
dont 13
think 13
he 13
went 13
there 13
something 13
in 13
her 13
tone 13
reminded 13
me 13
of 13
the 13
other 13
girls 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
killed 13
a 13
man 13
and 13
had 13
the 13
effect 13
of 13
stimulating 13
my 13
curiosity 13
i 13
would 13
have 13
accepted 13
without 13
question 13
the 13
information 13
that 13
gatsby 13
sprang 13
from 13
the 13
swamps 13
of 13
louisiana 13
or 13
from 13
the 13
lower 13
east 13
side 13
of 13
new 13
york 13
that 13
was 13
comprehensible 13
but 13
young 13
men 13
didntat 13
least 13
in 13
my 13
provincial 13
inexperience 13
i 13
believed 13
they 13
didntdrift 13
coolly 13
out 13
of 13
nowhere 13
and 13
buy 13
a 13
palace 13
on 13
long 13
island 13
sound 13
anyhow 13
he 13
gives 13
large 13
parties 13
said 13
jordan 13
changing 13
the 13
subject 13
with 13
an 13
urbane 13
distaste 13
for 13
the 13
concrete 13
and 13
i 13
like 13
large 13
parties 13
theyre 13
so 13
intimate 13
at 13
small 13
parties 13
there 13
isnt 13
any 13
privacy 13
there 13
was 13
the 13
boom 13
of 13
a 13
bass 13
drum 13
and 13
the 13
voice 13
of 13
the 13
orchestra 13
leader 13
rang 13
out 13
suddenly 13
above 13
the 13
echolalia 13
of 13
the 13
garden 13
ladies 13
and 13
gentlemen 13
he 13
cried 13
at 13
the 13
request 13
of 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
we 13
are 13
going 13
to 13
play 13
for 13
you 13
mr 13
vladimir 13
tostoffs 13
latest 13
work 13
which 13
attracted 13
so 13
much 13
attention 13
at 13
carnegie 13
hall 13
last 13
may 13
if 13
you 13
read 13
the 13
papers 13
you 13
know 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
big 13
sensation 13
he 13
smiled 13
with 13
jovial 13
condescension 13
and 13
added 13
some 13
sensation 13
whereupon 13
everybody 13
laughed 13
the 13
piece 13
is 13
known 13
he 13
concluded 13
lustily 13
as 13
vladimir 13
tostoffs 13
jazz 13
history 13
of 13
the 13
world 13
the 13
nature 13
of 13
mr 13
tostoffs 13
composition 13
eluded 13
me 13
because 13
just 13
as 13
it 13
began 13
my 13
eyes 13
fell 13
on 13
gatsby 13
standing 13
alone 13
on 13
the 13
marble 13
steps 13
and 13
looking 13
from 13
one 13
group 13
to 13
another 13
with 13
approving 13
eyes 13
his 13
tanned 13
skin 13
was 13
drawn 13
attractively 13
tight 13
on 13
his 13
face 13
and 13
his 13
short 13
hair 13
looked 13
as 13
though 13
it 13
were 13
trimmed 13
every 13
day 13
i 13
could 13
see 13
nothing 13
sinister 13
about 13
him 13
i 13
wondered 13
if 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
not 13
drinking 13
helped 13
to 13
set 13
him 13
off 13
from 13
his 13
guests 13
for 13
it 13
seemed 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
he 13
grew 13
more 13
correct 13
as 13
the 13
fraternal 13
hilarity 13
increased 13
when 13
the 13
jazz 13
history 13
of 13
the 13
world 13
was 13
over 13
girls 13
were 13
putting 13
their 13
heads 13
on 13
mens 13
shoulders 13
in 13
a 13
puppyish 13
convivial 13
way 13
girls 13
were 13
swooning 13
backward 13
playfully 13
into 13
mens 13
arms 13
even 13
into 13
groups 13
knowing 13
that 13
some 13
one 13
would 13
arrest 13
their 13
fallsbut 13
no 13
one 13
swooned 13
backward 13
on 13
gatsby 13
and 13
no 13
french 13
bob 13
touched 13
gatsbys 13
shoulder 13
and 13
no 13
singing 13
quartets 13
were 13
formed 13
with 13
gatsbys 13
head 13
for 13
one 13
link 13
i 13
beg 13
your 13
pardon 13
gatsbys 13
butler 13
was 13
suddenly 13
standing 13
beside 13
us 13
miss 13
baker 13
he 13
inquired 13
i 13
beg 13
your 13
pardon 13
but 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
would 13
like 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
you 13
alone 13
with 13
me 13
she 13
exclaimed 13
in 13
surprise 13
yes 13
madame 13
she 13
got 13
up 13
slowly 13
raising 13
her 13
eyebrows 13
at 13
me 13
in 13
astonishment 13
and 13
followed 13
the 13
butler 13
toward 13
the 13
house 13
i 13
noticed 13
that 13
she 13
wore 13
her 13
eveningdress 13
all 13
her 13
dresses 13
like 13
sports 13
clothesthere 13
was 13
a 13
jauntiness 13
about 13
her 13
movements 13
as 13
if 13
she 13
had 13
first 13
learned 13
to 13
walk 13
upon 13
golf 13
courses 13
on 13
clean 13
crisp 13
mornings 13
i 13
was 13
alone 13
and 13
it 13
was 13
almost 13
two 13
for 13
some 13
time 13
confused 13
and 13
intriguing 13
sounds 13
had 13
issued 13
from 13
a 13
long 13
manywindowed 13
room 13
which 13
overhung 13
the 13
terrace 13
eluding 13
jordans 13
undergraduate 13
who 13
was 13
now 13
engaged 13
in 13
an 13
obstetrical 13
conversation 13
with 13
two 13
chorus 13
girls 13
and 13
who 13
implored 13
me 13
to 13
join 13
him 13
i 13
went 13
inside 13
the 13
large 13
room 13
was 13
full 13
of 13
people 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
girls 13
in 13
yellow 13
was 13
playing 13
the 13
piano 13
and 13
beside 13
her 13
stood 13
a 13
tall 13
redhaired 13
young 13
lady 13
from 13
a 13
famous 13
chorus 13
engaged 13
in 13
song 13
she 13
had 13
drunk 13
a 13
quantity 13
of 13
champagne 13
and 13
during 13
the 13
course 13
of 13
her 13
song 13
she 13
had 13
decided 13
ineptly 13
that 13
everything 13
was 13
very 13
very 13
sadshe 13
was 13
not 13
only 13
singing 13
she 13
was 13
weeping 13
too 13
whenever 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
pause 13
in 13
the 13
song 13
she 13
filled 13
it 13
with 13
gasping 13
broken 13
sobs 13
and 13
then 13
took 13
up 13
the 13
lyric 13
again 13
in 13
a 13
quavering 13
soprano 13
the 13
tears 13
coursed 13
down 13
her 13
cheeksnot 13
freely 13
however 13
for 13
when 13
they 13
came 13
into 13
contact 13
with 13
her 13
heavily 13
beaded 13
eyelashes 13
they 13
assumed 13
an 13
inky 13
color 13
and 13
pursued 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
their 13
way 13
in 13
slow 13
black 13
rivulets 13
a 13
humorous 13
suggestion 13
was 13
made 13
that 13
she 13
sing 13
the 13
notes 13
on 13
her 13
face 13
whereupon 13
she 13
threw 13
up 13
her 13
hands 13
sank 13
into 13
a 13
chair 13
and 13
went 13
off 13
into 13
a 13
deep 13
vinous 13
sleep 13
she 13
had 13
a 13
fight 13
with 13
a 13
man 13
who 13
says 13
hes 13
her 13
husband 13
explained 13
a 13
girl 13
at 13
my 13
elbow 13
i 13
looked 13
around 13
most 13
of 13
the 13
remaining 13
women 13
were 13
now 13
having 13
fights 13
with 13
men 13
said 13
to 13
be 13
their 13
husbands 13
even 13
jordans 13
party 13
the 13
quartet 13
from 13
east 13
egg 13
were 13
rent 13
asunder 13
by 13
dissension 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
men 13
was 13
talking 13
with 13
curious 13
intensity 13
to 13
a 13
young 13
actress 13
and 13
his 13
wife 13
after 13
attempting 13
to 13
laugh 13
at 13
the 13
situation 13
in 13
a 13
dignified 13
and 13
indifferent 13
way 13
broke 13
down 13
entirely 13
and 13
resorted 13
to 13
flank 13
attacksat 13
intervals 13
she 13
appeared 13
suddenly 13
at 13
his 13
side 13
like 13
an 13
angry 13
diamond 13
and 13
hissed 13
you 13
promised 13
into 13
his 13
ear 13
the 13
reluctance 13
to 13
go 13
home 13
was 13
not 13
confined 13
to 13
wayward 13
men 13
the 13
hall 13
was 13
at 13
present 13
occupied 13
by 13
two 13
deplorably 13
sober 13
men 13
and 13
their 13
highly 13
indignant 13
wives 13
the 13
wives 13
were 13
sympathizing 13
with 13
each 13
other 13
in 13
slightly 13
raised 13
voices 13
whenever 13
he 13
sees 13
im 13
having 13
a 13
good 13
time 13
he 13
wants 13
to 13
go 13
home 13
never 13
heard 13
anything 13
so 13
selfish 13
in 13
my 13
life 13
were 13
always 13
the 13
first 13
ones 13
to 13
leave 13
so 13
are 13
we 13
well 13
were 13
almost 13
the 13
last 13
tonight 13
said 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
men 13
sheepishly 13
the 13
orchestra 13
left 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
ago 13
in 13
spite 13
of 13
the 13
wives 13
agreement 13
that 13
such 13
malevolence 13
was 13
beyond 13
credibility 13
the 13
dispute 13
ended 13
in 13
a 13
short 13
struggle 13
and 13
both 13
wives 13
were 13
lifted 13
kicking 13
into 13
the 13
night 13
as 13
i 13
waited 13
for 13
my 13
hat 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
the 13
door 13
of 13
the 13
library 13
opened 13
and 13
jordan 13
baker 13
and 13
gatsby 13
came 13
out 13
together 13
he 13
was 13
saying 13
some 13
last 13
word 13
to 13
her 13
but 13
the 13
eagerness 13
in 13
his 13
manner 13
tightened 13
abruptly 13
into 13
formality 13
as 13
several 13
people 13
approached 13
him 13
to 13
say 13
goodbye 13
jordans 13
party 13
were 13
calling 13
impatiently 13
to 13
her 13
from 13
the 13
porch 13
but 13
she 13
lingered 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
to 13
shake 13
hands 13
ive 13
just 13
heard 13
the 13
most 13
amazing 13
thing 13
she 13
whispered 13
how 13
long 13
were 13
we 13
in 13
there 13
why 13
about 13
an 13
hour 13
it 13
wassimply 13
amazing 13
she 13
repeated 13
abstractedly 13
but 13
i 13
swore 13
i 13
wouldnt 13
tell 13
it 13
and 13
here 13
i 13
am 13
tantalizing 13
you 13
she 13
yawned 13
gracefully 13
in 13
my 13
face 13

hurrying 13
off 13
as 13
she 13
talkedher 13
brown 13
hand 13
waved 13
a 13
jaunty 13
salute 13
as 13
she 13
melted 13
into 13
her 13
party 13
at 13
the 13
door 13
rather 13
ashamed 13
that 13
on 13
my 13
first 13
appearance 13
i 13
had 13
stayed 13
so 13
late 13
i 13
joined 13
the 13
last 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
guests 13
who 13
were 13
clustered 13
around 13
him 13
i 13
wanted 13
to 13
explain 13
that 13
id 13
hunted 13
for 13
him 13
early 13
in 13
the 13
evening 13
and 13
to 13
apologize 13
for 13
not 13
having 13
known 13
him 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13

it 13
he 13
enjoined 13
me 13
eagerly 13

give 13
it 13
another 13
thought 13
old 13
sport 13
the 13
familiar 13
expression 13
held 13
no 13
more 13
familiarity 13
than 13
the 13
hand 13
which 13
reassuringly 13
brushed 13
my 13
shoulder 13
and 13
dont 13
forget 13

going 13
up 13
in 13
the 13
hydroplane 13
tomorrow 13

at 13
nine 13
oclock 13
then 13
the 13
butler 13
behind 13
his 13
shoulder 13
philadelphia 13
wants 13
you 13
on 13
the 13

good 13
night 13
he 13
smiledand 13
suddenly 13
there 13
seemed 13
to 13
be 13
a 13
pleasant 13
significance 13
in 13
having 13
been 13
among 13
the 13
last 13
to 13
go 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
desired 13
it 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
good 13
night 13
old 13
sport 13
good 13
night 13
but 13
as 13
i 13
walked 13
down 13
the 13
steps 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
the 13
evening 13
was 13
not 13
quite 13
over 13
fifty 13
feet 13
from 13
the 13
door 13
a 13
dozen 13
headlights 13
illuminated 13
a 13
bizarre 13
and 13
tumultuous 13
scene 13
in 13
the 13
ditch 13
beside 13
the 13
road 13
right 13
side 13
up 13
but 13
violently 13
shorn 13
of 13
one 13
wheel 13
rested 13
a 13
new 13
coupe 13
which 13
had 13
left 13
gatsbys 13
drive 13
not 13
two 13
minutes 13
before 13
the 13
sharp 13
jut 13
of 13
a 13
wall 13
accounted 13
for 13
the 13
detachment 13
of 13
the 13
wheel 13
which 13
was 13
now 13
getting 13
considerable 13
attention 13
from 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
curious 13
chauffeurs 13
however 13
as 13
they 13
had 13
left 13
their 13
cars 13
blocking 13
the 13
road 13
a 13
harsh 13
discordant 13
din 13
from 13
those 13
in 13
the 13
rear 13
had 13
been 13
audible 13
for 13
some 13
time 13
and 13
added 13
to 13
the 13
already 13
violent 13
confusion 13
of 13
the 13
scene 13
a 13
man 13
in 13
a 13
long 13
duster 13
had 13
dismounted 13
from 13
the 13
wreck 13
and 13
now 13
stood 13
in 13
the 13
middle 13
of 13
the 13
road 13
looking 13
from 13
the 13
car 13
to 13
the 13
tire 13
and 13
from 13
the 13
tire 13
to 13
the 13
observers 13
in 13
a 13
pleasant 13
puzzled 13
way 13
see 13
he 13
explained 13
it 13
went 13
in 13
the 13
ditch 13
the 13
fact 13
was 13
infinitely 13
astonishing 13
to 13
him 13
and 13
i 13
recognized 13
first 13
the 13
unusual 13
quality 13
of 13
wonder 13
and 13
then 13
the 13
manit 13
was 13
the 13
late 13
patron 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
library 13
howd 13
it 13
happen 13
he 13
shrugged 13
his 13
shoulders 13
i 13
know 13
nothing 13
whatever 13
about 13
mechanics 13
he 13
said 13
decisively 13
but 13
how 13
did 13
it 13
happen 13
did 13
you 13
run 13
into 13
the 13
wall 13
dont 13
ask 13
me 13
said 13
owl 13
eyes 13
washing 13
his 13
hands 13
of 13
the 13
whole 13
matter 13
i 13
know 13
very 13
little 13
about 13
drivingnext 13
to 13
nothing 13
it 13
happened 13
and 13
thats 13
all 13
i 13
know 13
well 13
if 13
youre 13
a 13
poor 13
driver 13
you 13
oughtnt 13
to 13
try 13
driving 13
at 13
night 13
but 13
i 13
wasnt 13
even 13
trying 13
he 13
explained 13
indignantly 13
i 13
wasnt 13
even 13
trying 13
an 13
awed 13
hush 13
fell 13
upon 13
the 13
bystanders 13
do 13
you 13
want 13
to 13
commit 13
suicide 13
youre 13
lucky 13
it 13
was 13
just 13
a 13
wheel 13
a 13
bad 13
driver 13
and 13
not 13
even 13
trying 13
you 13
dont 13
understand 13
explained 13
the 13
criminal 13
i 13
wasnt 13
driving 13
theres 13
another 13
man 13
in 13
the 13
car 13
the 13
shock 13
that 13
followed 13
this 13
declaration 13
found 13
voice 13
in 13
a 13
sustained 13
ahhh 13
as 13
the 13
door 13
of 13
the 13
coupe 13
swung 13
slowly 13
open 13
the 13
crowdit 13
was 13
now 13
a 13
crowdstepped 13
back 13
involuntarily 13
and 13
when 13
the 13
door 13
had 13
opened 13
wide 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
ghostly 13
pause 13
then 13
very 13
gradually 13
part 13
by 13
part 13
a 13
pale 13
dangling 13
individual 13
stepped 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
wreck 13
pawing 13
tentatively 13
at 13
the 13
ground 13
with 13
a 13
large 13
uncertain 13
dancing 13
shoe 13
blinded 13
by 13
the 13
glare 13
of 13
the 13
headlights 13
and 13
confused 13
by 13
the 13
incessant 13
groaning 13
of 13
the 13
horns 13
the 13
apparition 13
stood 13
swaying 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
before 13
he 13
perceived 13
the 13
man 13
in 13
the 13
duster 13
whas 13
matter 13
he 13
inquired 13
calmly 13
did 13
we 13
run 13
outa 13
gas 13
look 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
fingers 13
pointed 13
at 13
the 13
amputated 13
wheelhe 13
stared 13
at 13
it 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
and 13
then 13
looked 13
upward 13
as 13
though 13
he 13
suspected 13
that 13
it 13
had 13
dropped 13
from 13
the 13
sky 13
it 13
came 13
off 13
some 13
one 13
explained 13
he 13
nodded 13
at 13
first 13
i 13
din 13
notice 13
wed 13
stopped 13
a 13
pause 13
then 13
taking 13
a 13
long 13
breath 13
and 13
straightening 13
his 13
shoulders 13
he 13
remarked 13
in 13
a 13
determined 13
voice 13
wonderff 13
tell 13
me 13
where 13
theres 13
a 13
gasline 13
station 13
at 13
least 13
a 13
dozen 13
men 13
some 13
of 13
them 13
little 13
better 13
off 13
than 13
he 13
was 13
explained 13
to 13
him 13
that 13
wheel 13
and 13
car 13
were 13
no 13
longer 13
joined 13
by 13
any 13
physical 13
bond 13
back 13
out 13
he 13
suggested 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
put 13
her 13
in 13
reverse 13
but 13
the 13
wheels 13
off 13
he 13
hesitated 13
no 13
harm 13
in 13
trying 13
he 13
said 13
the 13
caterwauling 13
horns 13
had 13
reached 13
a 13
crescendo 13
and 13
i 13
turned 13
away 13
and 13
cut 13
across 13
the 13
lawn 13
toward 13
home 13
i 13
glanced 13
back 13
once 13
a 13
wafer 13
of 13
a 13
moon 13
was 13
shining 13
over 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
making 13
the 13
night 13
fine 13
as 13
before 13
and 13
surviving 13
the 13
laughter 13
and 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
his 13
still 13
glowing 13
garden 13
a 13
sudden 13
emptiness 13
seemed 13
to 13
flow 13
now 13
from 13
the 13
windows 13
and 13
the 13
great 13
doors 13
endowing 13
with 13
complete 13
isolation 13
the 13
figure 13
of 13
the 13
host 13
who 13
stood 13
on 13
the 13
porch 13
his 13
hand 13
up 13
in 13
a 13
formal 13
gesture 13
of 13
farewell 13
reading 13
over 13
what 13
i 13
have 13
written 13
so 13
far 13
i 13
see 13
i 13
have 13
given 13
the 13
impression 13
that 13
the 13
events 13
of 13
three 13
nights 13
several 13
weeks 13
apart 13
were 13
all 13
that 13
absorbed 13
me 13
on 13
the 13
contrary 13
they 13
were 13
merely 13
casual 13
events 13
in 13
a 13
crowded 13
summer 13
and 13
until 13
much 13
later 13
they 13
absorbed 13
me 13
infinitely 13
less 13
than 13
my 13
personal 13
affairs 13
most 13
of 13
the 13
time 13
i 13
worked 13
in 13
the 13
early 13
morning 13
the 13
sun 13
threw 13
my 13
shadow 13
westward 13
as 13
i 13
hurried 13
down 13
the 13
white 13
chasms 13
of 13
lower 13
new 13
york 13
to 13
the 13
probity 13
trust 13
i 13
knew 13
the 13
other 13
clerks 13
and 13
young 13
bondsalesmen 13
by 13
their 13
first 13
names 13
and 13
lunched 13
with 13
them 13
in 13
dark 13
crowded 13
restaurants 13
on 13
little 13
pig 13
sausages 13
and 13
mashed 13
potatoes 13
and 13
coffee 13
i 13
even 13
had 13
a 13
short 13
affair 13
with 13
a 13
girl 13
who 13
lived 13
in 13
jersey 13
city 13
and 13
worked 13
in 13
the 13
accounting 13
department 13
but 13
her 13
brother 13
began 13
throwing 13
mean 13
looks 13
in 13
my 13
direction 13
so 13
when 13
she 13
went 13
on 13
her 13
vacation 13
in 13
july 13
i 13
let 13
it 13
blow 13
quietly 13
away 13
i 13
took 13
dinner 13
usually 13
at 13
the 13
yale 13
clubfor 13
some 13
reason 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
gloomiest 13
event 13
of 13
my 13
dayand 13
then 13
i 13
went 13
upstairs 13
to 13
the 13
library 13
and 13
studied 13
investments 13
and 13
securities 13
for 13
a 13
conscientious 13
hour 13
there 13
were 13
generally 13
a 13
few 13
rioters 13
around 13
but 13
they 13
never 13
came 13
into 13
the 13
library 13
so 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
good 13
place 13
to 13
work 13
after 13
that 13
if 13
the 13
night 13
was 13
mellow 13
i 13
strolled 13
down 13
madison 13
avenue 13
past 13
the 13
old 13
murray 13
hill 13
hotel 13
and 13
over 13
rd 13
street 13
to 13
the 13
pennsylvania 13
station 13
i 13
began 13
to 13
like 13
new 13
york 13
the 13
racy 13
adventurous 13
feel 13
of 13
it 13
at 13
night 13
and 13
the 13
satisfaction 13
that 13
the 13
constant 13
flicker 13
of 13
men 13
and 13
women 13
and 13
machines 13
gives 13
to 13
the 13
restless 13
eye 13
i 13
liked 13
to 13
walk 13
up 13
fifth 13
avenue 13
and 13
pick 13
out 13
romantic 13
women 13
from 13
the 13
crowd 13
and 13
imagine 13
that 13
in 13
a 13
few 13
minutes 13
i 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
enter 13
into 13
their 13
lives 13
and 13
no 13
one 13
would 13
ever 13
know 13
or 13
disapprove 13
sometimes 13
in 13
my 13
mind 13
i 13
followed 13
them 13
to 13
their 13
apartments 13
on 13
the 13
corners 13
of 13
hidden 13
streets 13
and 13
they 13
turned 13
and 13
smiled 13
back 13
at 13
me 13
before 13
they 13
faded 13
through 13
a 13
door 13
into 13
warm 13
darkness 13
at 13
the 13
enchanted 13
metropolitan 13
twilight 13
i 13
felt 13
a 13
haunting 13
loneliness 13
sometimes 13
and 13
felt 13
it 13
in 13
otherspoor 13
young 13
clerks 13
who 13
loitered 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
windows 13
waiting 13
until 13
it 13
was 13
time 13
for 13
a 13
solitary 13
restaurant 13
dinneryoung 13
clerks 13
in 13
the 13
dusk 13
wasting 13
the 13
most 13
poignant 13
moments 13
of 13
night 13
and 13
life 13
again 13
at 13
eight 13
oclock 13
when 13
the 13
dark 13
lanes 13
of 13
the 13
forties 13
were 13
five 13
deep 13
with 13
throbbing 13
taxicabs 13
bound 13
for 13
the 13
theatre 13
district 13
i 13
felt 13
a 13
sinking 13
in 13
my 13
heart 13
forms 13
leaned 13
together 13
in 13
the 13
taxis 13
as 13
they 13
waited 13
and 13
voices 13
sang 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
laughter 13
from 13
unheard 13
jokes 13
and 13
lighted 13
cigarettes 13
outlined 13
unintelligible 13
gestures 13
inside 13
imagining 13
that 13
i 13
too 13
was 13
hurrying 13
toward 13
gayety 13
and 13
sharing 13
their 13
intimate 13
excitement 13
i 13
wished 13
them 13
well 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
i 13
lost 13
sight 13
of 13
jordan 13
baker 13
and 13
then 13
in 13
midsummer 13
i 13
found 13
her 13
again 13
at 13
first 13
i 13
was 13
flattered 13
to 13
go 13
places 13
with 13
her 13
because 13
she 13
was 13
a 13
golf 13
champion 13
and 13
every 13
one 13
knew 13
her 13
name 13
then 13
it 13
was 13
something 13
more 13
i 13
wasnt 13
actually 13
in 13
love 13
but 13
i 13
felt 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
tender 13
curiosity 13
the 13
bored 13
haughty 13
face 13
that 13
she 13
turned 13
to 13
the 13
world 13
concealed 13
somethingmost 13
affectations 13
conceal 13
something 13
eventually 13
even 13
though 13
they 13
dont 13
in 13
the 13
beginningand 13
one 13
day 13
i 13
found 13
what 13
it 13
was 13
when 13
we 13
were 13
on 13
a 13
houseparty 13
together 13
up 13
in 13
warwick 13
she 13
left 13
a 13
borrowed 13
car 13
out 13
in 13
the 13
rain 13
with 13
the 13
top 13
down 13
and 13
then 13
lied 13
about 13
itand 13
suddenly 13
i 13
remembered 13
the 13
story 13
about 13
her 13
that 13
had 13
eluded 13
me 13
that 13
night 13
at 13
daisys 13
at 13
her 13
first 13
big 13
golf 13
tournament 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
row 13
that 13
nearly 13
reached 13
the 13
newspapersa 13
suggestion 13
that 13
she 13
had 13
moved 13
her 13
ball 13
from 13
a 13
bad 13
lie 13
in 13
the 13
semifinal 13
round 13
the 13
thing 13
approached 13
the 13
proportions 13
of 13
a 13
scandalthen 13
died 13
away 13
a 13
caddy 13
retracted 13
his 13
statement 13
and 13
the 13
only 13
other 13
witness 13
admitted 13
that 13
he 13
might 13
have 13
been 13
mistaken 13
the 13
incident 13
and 13
the 13
name 13
had 13
remained 13
together 13
in 13
my 13
mind 13
jordan 13
baker 13
instinctively 13
avoided 13
clever 13
shrewd 13
men 13
and 13
now 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
this 13
was 13
because 13
she 13
felt 13
safer 13
on 13
a 13
plane 13
where 13
any 13
divergence 13
from 13
a 13
code 13
would 13
be 13
thought 13
impossible 13
she 13
was 13
incurably 13
dishonest 13
she 13
wasnt 13
able 13
to 13
endure 13
being 13
at 13
a 13
disadvantage 13
and 13
given 13
this 13
unwillingness 13
i 13
suppose 13
she 13
had 13
begun 13
dealing 13
in 13
subterfuges 13
when 13
she 13
was 13
very 13
young 13
in 13
order 13
to 13
keep 13
that 13
cool 13
insolent 13
smile 13
turned 13
to 13
the 13
world 13
and 13
yet 13
satisfy 13
the 13
demands 13
of 13
her 13
hard 13
jaunty 13
body 13
it 13
made 13
no 13
difference 13
to 13
me 13
dishonesty 13
in 13
a 13
woman 13
is 13
a 13
thing 13
you 13
never 13
blame 13
deeplyi 13
was 13
casually 13
sorry 13
and 13
then 13
i 13
forgot 13
it 13
was 13
on 13
that 13
same 13
house 13
party 13
that 13
we 13
had 13
a 13
curious 13
conversation 13
about 13
driving 13
a 13
car 13
it 13
started 13
because 13
she 13
passed 13
so 13
close 13
to 13
some 13
workmen 13
that 13
our 13
fender 13
flicked 13
a 13
button 13
on 13
one 13
mans 13
coat 13
youre 13
a 13
rotten 13
driver 13
i 13
protested 13
either 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
be 13
more 13
careful 13
or 13
you 13
oughtnt 13
to 13
drive 13
at 13
all 13
i 13
am 13
careful 13
no 13
youre 13
not 13
well 13
other 13
people 13
are 13
she 13
said 13
lightly 13
whats 13
that 13
got 13
to 13
do 13
with 13
it 13
theyll 13
keep 13
out 13
of 13
my 13
way 13
she 13
insisted 13
it 13
takes 13
two 13
to 13
make 13
an 13
accident 13
suppose 13
you 13
met 13
somebody 13
just 13
as 13
careless 13
as 13
yourself 13
i 13
hope 13
i 13
never 13
will 13
she 13
answered 13
i 13
hate 13
careless 13
people 13
thats 13
why 13
i 13
like 13
you 13
her 13
gray 13
sunstrained 13
eyes 13
stared 13
straight 13
ahead 13
but 13
she 13
had 13
deliberately 13
shifted 13
our 13
relations 13
and 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
thought 13
i 13
loved 13
her 13
but 13
i 13
am 13
slowthinking 13
and 13
full 13
of 13
interior 13
rules 13
that 13
act 13
as 13
brakes 13
on 13
my 13
desires 13
and 13
i 13
knew 13
that 13
first 13
i 13
had 13
to 13
get 13
myself 13
definitely 13
out 13
of 13
that 13
tangle 13
back 13
home 13
id 13
been 13
writing 13
letters 13
once 13
a 13
week 13
and 13
signing 13
them 13
love 13
nick 13
and 13
all 13
i 13
could 13
think 13
of 13
was 13
how 13
when 13
that 13
certain 13
girl 13
played 13
tennis 13
a 13
faint 13
mustache 13
of 13
perspiration 13
appeared 13
on 13
her 13
upper 13
lip 13
nevertheless 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
vague 13
understanding 13
that 13
had 13
to 13
be 13
tactfully 13
broken 13
off 13
before 13
i 13
was 13
free 13
every 13
one 13
suspects 13
himself 13
of 13
at 13
least 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
cardinal 13
virtues 13
and 13
this 13
is 13
mine 13
i 13
am 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
few 13
honest 13
people 13
that 13
i 13
have 13
ever 13
known 13
chapter 13
on 13
sunday 13
morning 13
while 13
church 13
bells 13
rang 13
in 13
the 13
villages 13
alongshore 13
the 13
world 13
and 13
its 13
mistress 13
returned 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
and 13
twinkled 13
hilariously 13
on 13
his 13
lawn 13
hes 13
a 13
bootlegger 13
said 13
the 13
young 13
ladies 13
moving 13
somewhere 13
between 13
his 13
cocktails 13
and 13
his 13
flowers 13
one 13
time 13
he 13
killed 13
a 13
man 13
who 13
had 13
found 13
out 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
nephew 13
to 13
von 13
hindenburg 13
and 13
second 13
cousin 13
to 13

a 13
rose 13

me 13
a 13
last 13
drop 13
into 13
that 13
there 13
crystal 13
glass 13
once 13
i 13
wrote 13
down 13
on 13
the 13
empty 13
spaces 13
of 13
a 13
timetable 13
the 13
names 13
of 13
those 13
who 13
came 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
that 13
summer 13
it 13
is 13
an 13
old 13
timetable 13
now 13
disintegrating 13
at 13
its 13
folds 13
and 13
headed 13
this 13
schedule 13
in 13
effect 13
july 13
th 13
but 13
i 13
can 13
still 13
read 13
the 13
gray 13
names 13
and 13
they 13
will 13
give 13
you 13
a 13
better 13
impression 13
than 13
my 13
generalities 13
of 13
those 13
who 13
accepted 13
gatsbys 13
hospitality 13
and 13
paid 13
him 13
the 13

physical 13
person 13

they 13
were 13
so 13
identical 13
one 13
with 13
another 13
that 13
it 13
inevitably 13
seemed 13
they 13
had 13
been 13
there 13
before 13

were 13
either 13
the 13
melodious 13
names 13
of 13
flowers 13

months 13

the 13
sterner 13
ones 13
of 13
the 13
great 13
american 13
capitalists 13
whose 13
cousins 13

themselves 13
to 13
be 13
in 13
addition 13
to 13
all 13
these 13
i 13
can 13

that 13
faustina 13

once 13

chauffeur 13
and 13
a 13
prince 13
of 13
something 13
whom 13
we 13
called 13
duke 13
and 13
whose 13
name 13
if 13
i 13
ever 13
knew 13
it 13
i 13
have 13
forgotten 13
all 13
these 13
people 13
came 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
in 13
the 13
summer 13
at 13
nine 13
oclock 13
one 13
morning 13
late 13
in 13
july 13
gatsbys 13
gorgeous 13
car 13
lurched 13
up 13
the 13
rocky 13
drive 13
to 13
my 13
door 13
and 13
gave 13
out 13
a 13
burst 13
of 13
melody 13
from 13
its 13
threenoted 13
horn 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
first 13
time 13
he 13
had 13
called 13
on 13
me 13
though 13
i 13
had 13
gone 13
to 13
two 13
of 13
his 13
parties 13
mounted 13
in 13
his 13
hydroplane 13
and 13
at 13
his 13
urgent 13
invitation 13
made 13
frequent 13
use 13
of 13
his 13
beach 13
good 13
morning 13
old 13
sport 13
youre 13
having 13
lunch 13
with 13
me 13
today 13
and 13
i 13
thought 13
wed 13
ride 13
up 13
together 13
he 13
was 13
balancing 13
himself 13
on 13
the 13
dashboard 13
of 13
his 13
car 13
with 13
that 13
resourcefulness 13
of 13
movement 13
that 13
is 13
so 13
peculiarly 13
americanthat 13
comes 13
i 13
suppose 13
with 13
the 13
absence 13
of 13
lifting 13
work 13
or 13
rigid 13
sitting 13
in 13
youth 13
and 13
even 13
more 13
with 13
the 13
formless 13
grace 13
of 13
our 13
nervous 13
sporadic 13
games 13
this 13
quality 13
was 13
continually 13
breaking 13
through 13
his 13
punctilious 13
manner 13
in 13
the 13
shape 13
of 13
restlessness 13
he 13
was 13
never 13
quite 13
still 13
there 13
was 13
always 13
a 13
tapping 13
foot 13
somewhere 13
or 13
the 13
impatient 13
opening 13
and 13
closing 13
of 13
a 13
hand 13
he 13
saw 13
me 13
looking 13
with 13
admiration 13
at 13
his 13
car 13
its 13
pretty 13
isnt 13
it 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
jumped 13
off 13
to 13
give 13
me 13
a 13
better 13
view 13
havent 13
you 13
ever 13
seen 13
it 13
before 13
id 13
seen 13
it 13
everybody 13
had 13
seen 13
it 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
rich 13
cream 13
color 13
bright 13
with 13
nickel 13
swollen 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
in 13
its 13
monstrous 13
length 13
with 13
triumphant 13
hatboxes 13
and 13
supperboxes 13
and 13
toolboxes 13
and 13
terraced 13
with 13
a 13
labyrinth 13
of 13
windshields 13
that 13
mirrored 13
a 13
dozen 13
suns 13
sitting 13
down 13
behind 13
many 13
layers 13
of 13
glass 13
in 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
green 13
leather 13
conservatory 13
we 13
started 13
to 13
town 13
i 13
had 13
talked 13
with 13
him 13
perhaps 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
times 13
in 13
the 13
past 13
month 13
and 13
found 13
to 13
my 13
disappointment 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
little 13
to 13
say 13
so 13
my 13
first 13
impression 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
person 13
of 13
some 13
undefined 13
consequence 13
had 13
gradually 13
faded 13
and 13
he 13
had 13
become 13
simply 13
the 13
proprietor 13
of 13
an 13
elaborate 13
roadhouse 13
next 13
door 13
and 13
then 13
came 13
that 13
disconcerting 13
ride 13
we 13
hadnt 13
reached 13
west 13
egg 13
village 13
before 13
gatsby 13
began 13
leaving 13
his 13
elegant 13
sentences 13
unfinished 13
and 13
slapping 13
himself 13
indecisively 13
on 13
the 13
knee 13
of 13
his 13
caramelcolored 13
suit 13
look 13
here 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
broke 13
out 13
surprisingly 13
whats 13
your 13
opinion 13
of 13
me 13
anyhow 13
a 13
little 13
overwhelmed 13
i 13
began 13
the 13
generalized 13
evasions 13
which 13
that 13
question 13
deserves 13
well 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
tell 13
you 13
something 13
about 13
my 13
life 13
he 13
interrupted 13
i 13
dont 13
want 13
you 13
to 13
get 13
a 13
wrong 13
idea 13
of 13
me 13
from 13
all 13
these 13
stories 13
you 13
hear 13
so 13
he 13
was 13
aware 13
of 13
the 13
bizarre 13
accusations 13
that 13
flavored 13
conversation 13
in 13
his 13
halls 13
ill 13
tell 13
you 13
gods 13
truth 13
his 13
right 13
hand 13
suddenly 13
ordered 13
divine 13
retribution 13
to 13
stand 13
by 13
i 13
am 13
the 13
son 13
of 13
some 13
wealthy 13
people 13
in 13
the 13
middle 13
westall 13
dead 13
now 13
i 13
was 13
brought 13
up 13
in 13
america 13
but 13
educated 13
at 13
oxford 13
because 13
all 13
my 13
ancestors 13
have 13
been 13
educated 13
there 13
for 13
many 13
years 13
it 13
is 13
a 13
family 13
tradition 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
sidewaysand 13
i 13
knew 13
why 13
jordan 13
baker 13
had 13
believed 13
he 13
was 13
lying 13
he 13
hurried 13
the 13
phrase 13
educated 13
at 13
oxford 13
or 13
swallowed 13
it 13
or 13
choked 13
on 13
it 13
as 13
though 13
it 13
had 13
bothered 13
him 13
before 13
and 13
with 13
this 13
doubt 13
his 13
whole 13
statement 13
fell 13
to 13
pieces 13
and 13
i 13
wondered 13
if 13
there 13
wasnt 13
something 13
a 13
little 13
sinister 13
about 13
him 13
after 13
all 13
what 13
part 13
of 13
the 13
middle 13
west 13
i 13
inquired 13
casually 13
san 13
francisco 13
i 13
see 13
my 13
family 13
all 13
died 13
and 13
i 13
came 13
into 13
a 13
good 13
deal 13
of 13
money 13
his 13
voice 13
was 13
solemn 13
as 13
if 13
the 13
memory 13
of 13
that 13
sudden 13
extinction 13
of 13
a 13
clan 13
still 13
haunted 13
him 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
suspected 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
pulling 13
my 13
leg 13
but 13
a 13
glance 13
at 13
him 13
convinced 13
me 13
otherwise 13
after 13
that 13
i 13
lived 13
like 13
a 13
young 13
rajah 13
in 13
all 13

things 13
for 13
myself 13
only 13
and 13
trying 13
to 13
forget 13
something 13
very 13
sad 13
that 13
had 13
happened 13
to 13
me 13
long 13
ago 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
i 13
managed 13
to 13
restrain 13
my 13
incredulous 13
laughter 13
the 13
very 13
phrases 13
were 13
worn 13
so 13
threadbare 13
that 13
they 13
evoked 13
no 13
image 13
except 13
that 13
of 13
a 13
turbaned 13
character 13
leaking 13
sawdust 13
at 13
every 13
pore 13
as 13
he 13
pursued 13
a 13
tiger 13
through 13
the 13
bois 13
de 13
boulogne 13
then 13
came 13
the 13
war 13
old 13
sport 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
great 13
relief 13
and 13
i 13
tried 13
very 13
hard 13
to 13
die 13
but 13
i 13
seemed 13
to 13
bear 13
an 13
enchanted 13
life 13
i 13
accepted 13
a 13
commission 13
as 13
first 13
lieutenant 13
when 13
it 13
began 13
in 13
the 13
argonne 13
forest 13
i 13
took 13
two 13
machinegun 13
detachments 13
so 13
far 13
forward 13
that 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
half 13
mile 13
gap 13
on 13
either 13
side 13
of 13
us 13
where 13
the 13
infantry 13
couldnt 13
advance 13
we 13
stayed 13
there 13
two 13
days 13
and 13
two 13
nights 13
a 13
hundred 13
and 13
thirty 13
men 13
with 13
sixteen 13
lewis 13
guns 13
and 13
when 13
the 13
infantry 13
came 13
up 13
at 13
last 13
they 13
found 13
the 13
insignia 13
of 13
three 13
german 13
divisions 13
among 13
the 13
piles 13
of 13
dead 13
i 13
was 13
promoted 13
to 13
be 13
a 13
major 13
and 13

up 13
the 13
words 13
and 13
nodded 13
at 13
themwith 13
his 13
smile 13
the 13
smile 13
comprehended 13
montenegros 13
troubled 13
history 13
and 13
sympathized 13
with 13
the 13
brave 13
struggles 13
of 13
the 13
montenegrin 13
people 13
it 13
appreciated 13
fully 13
the 13
chain 13
of 13
national 13
circumstances 13

montenegros 13
warm 13
little 13
heart 13
my 13
incredulity 13
was 13
submerged 13
in 13
fascination 13
now 13
it 13
was 13
like 13
skimming 13
hastily 13
through 13
a 13
dozen 13
magazines 13
he 13
reached 13
in 13
his 13
pocket 13
and 13
a 13
piece 13
of 13
metal 13

a 13
host 13
of 13
spires 13
there 13

looking 13
a 13

not 13
much 13
youngerwith 13
a 13
cricket 13

in 13
his 13

then 13
it 13

the 13
skins 13
of 13
tigers 13
flaming 13
in 13
his 13
palace 13
on 13
the 13
grand 13
canal 13
i 13
saw 13
him 13
opening 13
a 13
chest 13
of 13
rubies 13
to 13
ease 13
with 13
their 13
crimsonlighted 13

gnawings 13
of 13
his 13
broken 13

going 13
to 13
make 13
a 13
big 13
request 13

today 13
he 13
said 13
pocketing 13
his 13
souvenirs 13
with 13
satisfaction 13
so 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
know 13
something 13
about 13
me 13
i 13
didnt 13
want 13
you 13
to 13
think 13
i 13
was 13
just 13
some 13
nobody 13
you 13
see 13
i 13
usually 13
find 13
myself 13
among 13
strangers 13
because 13
i 13
drift 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
trying 13
to 13
forget 13
the 13
sad 13
thing 13
that 13
happened 13
to 13
me 13
he 13
hesitated 13
youll 13
hear 13
about 13
it 13
this 13
afternoon 13
at 13
lunch 13
no 13

afternoon 13
i 13

kindly 13
consented 13
to 13

to 13
you 13
about 13
this 13
matter 13
i 13
hadnt 13
the 13
faintest 13
idea 13
what 13
this 13
matter 13
was 13
but 13
i 13
was 13
more 13
annoyed 13
than 13
interested 13
i 13
hadnt 13
asked 13
jordan 13
to 13
tea 13
in 13
order 13
to 13
discuss 13
mr 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
i 13
was 13
sure 13
the 13
request 13
would 13
be 13
something 13
utterly 13
fantastic 13
and 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
was 13
sorry 13
id 13
ever 13
set 13
foot 13
upon 13
his 13
overpopulated 13
lawn 13
he 13
wouldnt 13
say 13
another 13
word 13
his 13
correctness 13
grew 13
on 13
him 13
as 13
we 13
neared 13
the 13
city 13
we 13
passed 13
port 13
roosevelt 13
where 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
glimpse 13
of 13
redbelted 13
oceangoing 13
ships 13
and 13
sped 13
along 13
a 13
cobbled 13
slum 13
lined 13
with 13
the 13
dark 13
undeserted 13
saloons 13
of 13
the 13
fadedgilt 13
nineteenhundreds 13
then 13
the 13
valley 13
of 13
ashes 13
opened 13
out 13
on 13
both 13
sides 13
of 13
us 13
and 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
glimpse 13
of 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
straining 13
at 13
the 13
garage 13
pump 13
with 13
panting 13
vitality 13
as 13
we 13
went 13
by 13
with 13
fenders 13
spread 13
like 13
wings 13
we 13
scattered 13
light 13
through 13
half 13
long 13
island 13
cityonly 13
half 13
for 13
as 13
we 13
twisted 13
among 13
the 13
pillars 13
of 13
the 13
elevated 13
i 13
heard 13
the 13
familiar 13
jugjugspat 13
of 13
a 13
motorcycle 13
and 13
a 13
frantic 13
policeman 13
rode 13
alongside 13
all 13
right 13
old 13
sport 13
called 13
gatsby 13
we 13
slowed 13
down 13
taking 13
a 13
white 13
card 13
from 13
his 13
wallet 13
he 13
waved 13
it 13
before 13
the 13
mans 13
eyes 13
right 13
you 13
are 13
agreed 13
the 13
policeman 13
tipping 13
his 13
cap 13
know 13
you 13
next 13
time 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
excuse 13
me 13
what 13
was 13
that 13
i 13
inquired 13
the 13
picture 13
of 13
oxford 13
i 13
was 13
able 13
to 13
do 13
the 13
commissioner 13
a 13
favor 13
once 13
and 13
he 13
sends 13
me 13
a 13
christmas 13
card 13
every 13
year 13
over 13
the 13
great 13
bridge 13
with 13
the 13
sunlight 13
through 13
the 13
girders 13
making 13
a 13
constant 13
flicker 13
upon 13
the 13
moving 13
cars 13
with 13
the 13
city 13
rising 13
up 13
across 13
the 13
river 13
in 13
white 13
heaps 13
and 13
sugar 13
lumps 13
all 13
built 13
with 13
a 13
wish 13
out 13
of 13
nonolfactory 13
money 13
the 13
city 13
seen 13
from 13
the 13
queensboro 13
bridge 13
is 13
always 13
the 13
city 13
seen 13
for 13
the 13
first 13
time 13
in 13
its 13
first 13
wild 13
promise 13
of 13
all 13
the 13
mystery 13
and 13
the 13
beauty 13
in 13
the 13
world 13
a 13
dead 13
man 13
passed 13
us 13
in 13
a 13
hearse 13
heaped 13
with 13
blooms 13
followed 13
by 13
two 13
carriages 13
with 13
drawn 13
blinds 13
and 13
by 13
more 13
cheerful 13
carriages 13
for 13
friends 13
the 13
friends 13
looked 13
out 13
at 13
us 13
with 13
the 13
tragic 13
eyes 13
and 13
short 13
upper 13
lips 13
of 13
southeastern 13
europe 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
glad 13
that 13
the 13
sight 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
splendid 13
car 13
was 13
included 13
in 13
their 13
sombre 13
holiday 13
as 13
we 13
crossed 13
blackwells 13
island 13
a 13
limousine 13
passed 13
us 13
driven 13
by 13
a 13
white 13
chauffeur 13
in 13
which 13
sat 13
three 13
modish 13
negroes 13
two 13
bucks 13
and 13
a 13
girl 13
i 13
laughed 13
aloud 13
as 13
the 13
yolks 13
of 13
their 13
eyeballs 13
rolled 13
toward 13
us 13
in 13
haughty 13
rivalry 13
anything 13
can 13
happen 13
now 13
that 13
weve 13
slid 13
over 13
this 13
bridge 13
i 13
thought 13
anything 13
at 13
all 13
even 13
gatsby 13
could 13
happen 13
without 13
any 13
particular 13
wonder 13
roaring 13
noon 13
in 13
a 13
wellfanned 13
fortysecond 13
street 13
cellar 13
i 13
met 13
gatsby 13
for 13
lunch 13
blinking 13
away 13
the 13
brightness 13
of 13
the 13
street 13
outside 13
my 13
eyes 13
picked 13
him 13
out 13
obscurely 13
in 13
the 13
anteroom 13
talking 13
to 13
another 13
man 13
mr 13
carraway 13
this 13
is 13
my 13
friend 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
a 13
small 13
flatnosed 13
jew 13
raised 13
his 13
large 13
head 13
and 13
regarded 13
me 13
with 13
two 13
fine 13
growths 13
of 13
hair 13
which 13
luxuriated 13
in 13
either 13
nostril 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
discovered 13
his 13
tiny 13
eyes 13
in 13
the 13
halfdarkness 13
so 13
i 13
took 13
one 13
look 13
at 13
him 13
said 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
shaking 13
my 13
hand 13
earnestly 13
and 13
what 13
do 13
you 13
think 13
i 13
did 13
what 13
i 13
inquired 13
politely 13
but 13
evidently 13
he 13
was 13
not 13
addressing 13
me 13
for 13
he 13
dropped 13
my 13
hand 13
and 13
covered 13
gatsby 13
with 13
his 13
expressive 13
nose 13
i 13
handed 13
the 13
money 13
to 13

an 13
arm 13
of 13
each 13
of 13
us 13
and 13
moved 13
forward 13
into 13
the 13
restaurant 13
whereupon 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
swallowed 13
a 13
new 13
sentence 13
he 13
was 13
starting 13
and 13
lapsed 13
into 13
a 13
somnambulatory 13
abstraction 13
highballs 13
asked 13
the 13
head 13
waiter 13

is 13
a 13
nice 13
restaurant 13
here 13

mr 13
wolfshiem 13
looking 13
at 13
the 13
presbyterian 13
nymphs 13
on 13
the 13
ceiling 13
but 13

smallyes 13
said 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
but 13
full 13
of 13
memories 13
what 13
place 13
is 13
that 13
i 13
asked 13
the 13
old 13
metropole 13
the 13
old 13
metropole 13
brooded 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
gloomily 13
filled 13
with 13
faces 13
dead 13
and 13
gone 13
filled 13
with 13
friends 13
gone 13
now 13
forever 13
i 13
cant 13
forget 13
so 13
long 13
as 13

lot 13

when 13

was 13
almost 13
morning 13
the 13
waiter 13
came 13
up 13
to 13
him 13
with 13
a 13
funny 13
look 13
and 13

to 13

and 13
i 13
pulled 13
him 13
down 13
in 13
his 13
chair 13
let 13
the 13
bastards 13
come 13
in 13
here 13

outside 13

room 13

four 13
oclock 13
in 13
the 13
morning 13
then 13
and 13
if 13
wed 13
of 13
raised 13
the 13
blinds 13
wed 13
of 13
seen 13
daylight 13
did 13
he 13
go 13
i 13
asked 13
innocently 13
sure 13
he 13
went 13
mr 13
wolfshiems 13
nose 13
flashed 13
at 13
me 13
indignantly 13
he 13
turned 13
around 13
in 13
the 13
door 13
and 13
says 13
dont 13
let 13
that 13
waiter 13
take 13
away 13
my 13
coffee 13
then 13
he 13
went 13
out 13
on 13
the 13
sidewalk 13
and 13
they 13
shot 13
him 13
three 13
times 13
in 13
his 13
full 13
belly 13
and 13
drove 13
away 13
four 13
of 13
them 13
were 13
electrocuted 13
i 13
said 13
remembering 13
five 13
with 13
becker 13
his 13
nostrils 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
in 13
an 13
interested 13
way 13
i 13
understand 13
youre 13
looking 13
for 13
a 13
business 13
gonnegtion 13
the 13
juxtaposition 13
of 13
these 13
two 13
remarks 13
was 13
startling 13
gatsby 13
answered 13
for 13
me 13
oh 13
no 13
he 13
exclaimed 13
this 13
isnt 13
the 13
man 13
no 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
seemed 13
disappointed 13
this 13
is 13
just 13
a 13
friend 13
i 13
told 13
you 13
wed 13
talk 13
about 13
that 13
some 13
other 13
time 13
i 13
beg 13
your 13
pardon 13
said 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
wrong 13
man 13
a 13
succulent 13
hash 13
arrived 13
and 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
forgetting 13
the 13
more 13
sentimental 13
atmosphere 13
of 13
the 13
old 13
metropole 13
began 13
to 13
eat 13
with 13
ferocious 13
delicacy 13
his 13
eyes 13
meanwhile 13
roved 13
very 13
slowly 13
all 13
around 13
the 13
roomhe 13
completed 13
the 13
arc 13
by 13
turning 13
to 13
inspect 13
the 13
people 13
directly 13
behind 13
i 13
think 13
that 13
except 13
for 13
my 13
presence 13
he 13
would 13
have 13
taken 13
one 13
short 13
glance 13
beneath 13
our 13
own 13
table 13
look 13
here 13
old 13
sport 13
said 13
gatsby 13
leaning 13
toward 13
me 13
im 13
afraid 13
i 13
made 13
you 13
a 13
little 13
angry 13
this 13
morning 13
in 13
the 13
car 13
there 13
was 13
the 13
smile 13
again 13
but 13
this 13
time 13
i 13
held 13
out 13
against 13
it 13
i 13
dont 13
like 13
mysteries 13
i 13
answered 13
and 13
i 13
dont 13
understand 13
why 13
you 13
wont 13
come 13
out 13
frankly 13
and 13
tell 13
me 13
what 13
you 13
want 13

through 13

assured 13
me 13

great 13
sportswoman 13
you 13

and 13
shed 13
never 13
do 13
anything 13
that 13
wasnt 13
all 13
right 13
suddenly 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
his 13
watch 13
jumped 13
up 13
and 13
hurried 13
from 13
the 13
room 13
leaving 13
me 13
with 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
at 13
the 13
table 13
he 13
has 13
to 13

said 13
mr 13

his 13
eyes 13
fine 13

of 13
the 13
most 13
famous 13
colleges 13
in 13
the 13
world 13
have 13
you 13
known 13
gatsby 13
for 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
i 13
inquired 13
several 13
years 13
he 13
answered 13
in 13
a 13
gratified 13
way 13
i 13
made 13
the 13
pleasure 13
of 13
his 13
acquaintance 13
just 13
after 13
the 13
war 13
but 13
i 13
knew 13
i 13
had 13
discovered 13
a 13
man 13
of 13
fine 13
breeding 13
after 13
i 13
talked 13
with 13
him 13
an 13
hour 13
i 13
said 13
to 13
myself 13
theres 13
the 13
kind 13
of 13
man 13
youd 13
like 13
to 13
take 13
home 13
and 13
introduce 13
to 13
your 13
mother 13
and 13
sister 13
he 13
paused 13
i 13
see 13
youre 13
looking 13
at 13
my 13
cuff 13
buttons 13
i 13
hadnt 13
been 13
looking 13
at 13
them 13
but 13
i 13
did 13
now 13
they 13
were 13
composed 13
of 13
oddly 13
familiar 13
pieces 13
of 13
ivory 13
finest 13
specimens 13
of 13
human 13
molars 13
he 13
informed 13
me 13
well 13
i 13
inspected 13
them 13
thats 13
a 13
very 13
interesting 13
idea 13
yeah 13
he 13
flipped 13
his 13
sleeves 13
up 13
under 13
his 13
coat 13
yeah 13
gatsbys 13
very 13
careful 13
about 13
women 13
he 13
would 13
never 13
so 13
much 13
as 13
look 13
at 13
a 13
friends 13
wife 13
when 13
the 13
subject 13
of 13
this 13
instinctive 13
trust 13
returned 13
to 13
the 13
table 13
and 13
sat 13
down 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
drank 13
his 13
coffee 13
with 13
a 13
jerk 13
and 13
got 13
to 13
his 13
feet 13
i 13
have 13
enjoyed 13
my 13
lunch 13
he 13
said 13
and 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
run 13
off 13
from 13
you 13
two 13
young 13
men 13
before 13
i 13
outstay 13
my 13
welcome 13
dont 13
hurry 13
meyer 13
said 13
gatsby 13
without 13
enthusiasm 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
raised 13
his 13
hand 13
in 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
benediction 13
youre 13
very 13
polite 13
but 13
i 13
belong 13
to 13
another 13
generation 13
he 13
announced 13
solemnly 13
you 13
sit 13
here 13
and 13
discuss 13
your 13
sports 13
and 13
your 13
young 13
ladies 13
and 13
your 13
he 13
supplied 13
an 13
imaginary 13
noun 13
with 13
another 13
wave 13
of 13
his 13
hand 13
as 13
for 13
me 13
i 13
am 13
fifty 13
years 13
old 13
and 13
i 13
wont 13
impose 13
myself 13
on 13
you 13
any 13
longer 13
as 13
he 13
shook 13
hands 13
and 13
turned 13
away 13
his 13
tragic 13
nose 13
was 13
trembling 13
i 13
wondered 13
if 13
i 13
had 13
said 13
anything 13
to 13
offend 13
him 13
he 13
becomes 13
very 13
sentimental 13
sometimes 13
explained 13
gatsby 13
this 13
is 13
one 13
of 13
his 13
sentimental 13
days 13
hes 13
quite 13
a 13
character 13
around 13
new 13
yorka 13
denizen 13
of 13
broadway 13
who 13
is 13
he 13
anyhow 13
an 13
actor 13
no 13
a 13
dentist 13
meyer 13
wolfshiem 13
no 13
hes 13
a 13
gambler 13
gatsby 13
hesitated 13
then 13
added 13
coolly 13
hes 13
the 13
man 13
who 13
fixed 13
the 13
worlds 13
series 13
back 13
in 13
fixed 13
the 13
worlds 13
series 13
i 13
repeated 13
the 13
idea 13
staggered 13
me 13
i 13
remembered 13
of 13
course 13
that 13
the 13
worlds 13
series 13
had 13
been 13
fixed 13
in 13
but 13
if 13
i 13
had 13
thought 13
of 13
it 13
at 13
all 13
i 13
would 13
have 13
thought 13
of 13
it 13
as 13
a 13
thing 13
that 13
merely 13
happened 13
the 13
end 13
of 13
some 13
inevitable 13
chain 13
it 13
never 13
occurred 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
one 13
man 13
could 13
start 13
to 13
play 13
with 13
the 13
faith 13
of 13
fifty 13
million 13
peoplewith 13
the 13
singlemindedness 13
of 13
a 13
burglar 13
blowing 13
a 13
safe 13
how 13
did 13
he 13
happen 13
to 13
do 13
that 13
i 13
asked 13
after 13
a 13
minute 13
he 13
just 13
saw 13
the 13
opportunity 13
why 13
isnt 13
he 13
in 13
jail 13
they 13
cant 13
get 13
him 13
old 13
sport 13
hes 13
a 13
smart 13
man 13
i 13
insisted 13
on 13
paying 13
the 13
check 13
as 13
the 13
waiter 13
brought 13
my 13
change 13
i 13
caught 13
sight 13
of 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
across 13
the 13
crowded 13
room 13
come 13
along 13
with 13
me 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
i 13
said 13
ive 13
got 13
to 13
say 13

when 13

up 13
and 13

briefly 13
and 13
a 13
strained 13
unfamiliar 13
look 13
of 13
embarrassment 13
came 13
over 13
gatsbys 13
face 13

on 13
the 13
lawns 13
i 13
was 13
happier 13
on 13
the 13
lawns 13
because 13

in 13

and 13
blue 13
banners 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
all 13
the 13
houses 13
stretched 13
out 13
stiff 13
and 13
said 13
tuttuttuttut 13
in 13
a 13
disapproving 13
way 13
the 13
largest 13
of 13
the 13
banners 13
and 13
the 13
largest 13
of 13

to 13
daisy 13
fays 13
house 13
she 13
was 13
just 13
eighteen 13
two 13
years 13
older 13
than 13
me 13
and 13
by 13
far 13
the 13
most 13
popular 13
of 13
all 13
the 13
young 13
girls 13
in 13
louisville 13
she 13
dressed 13
in 13
white 13
and 13
had 13
a 13
little 13
white 13
roadster 13
and 13
all 13
day 13
long 13
the 13
telephone 13
rang 13
in 13
her 13
house 13
and 13
excited 13
young 13
officers 13
from 13
camp 13
taylor 13
demanded 13
the 13
privilege 13
of 13
monopolizing 13
her 13
that 13
night 13
anyways 13
for 13
an 13
hour 13
when 13
i 13
came 13
opposite 13
her 13
house 13
that 13
morning 13
her 13
white 13
roadster 13
was 13
beside 13
the 13
curb 13
and 13
she 13
was 13
sitting 13
in 13
it 13
with 13
a 13
lieutenant 13
i 13
had 13
never 13
seen 13
before 13
they 13
were 13
so 13
engrossed 13
in 13
each 13
other 13
that 13
she 13
didnt 13
see 13
me 13
until 13
i 13
was 13
five 13
feet 13
away 13
hello 13
jordan 13
she 13
called 13
unexpectedly 13
please 13
come 13
here 13
i 13
was 13
flattered 13
that 13
she 13
wanted 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
me 13
because 13
of 13
all 13
the 13
older 13
girls 13
i 13
admired 13
her 13
most 13
she 13
asked 13
me 13
if 13
i 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
the 13
red 13
cross 13
and 13
make 13
bandages 13
i 13
was 13
well 13
then 13
would 13
i 13
tell 13
them 13
that 13
she 13
couldnt 13
come 13
that 13
day 13
the 13
officer 13
looked 13
at 13
daisy 13
while 13
she 13
was 13
speaking 13
in 13
a 13
way 13
that 13
every 13
young 13
girl 13
wants 13
to 13
be 13
looked 13
at 13
sometime 13
and 13
because 13
it 13
seemed 13
romantic 13
to 13
me 13
i 13
have 13
remembered 13
the 13
incident 13
ever 13
since 13
his 13
name 13
was 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
and 13
i 13
didnt 13
lay 13
eyes 13
on 13
him 13
again 13
for 13
over 13
four 13
yearseven 13
after 13
id 13
met 13
him 13
on 13
long 13
island 13
i 13
didnt 13
realize 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
same 13
man 13
that 13
was 13
nineteenseventeen 13
by 13
the 13
next 13
year 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
few 13
beaux 13
myself 13
and 13
i 13
began 13
to 13
play 13
in 13
tournaments 13
so 13
i 13
didnt 13
see 13
daisy 13
very 13
often 13
she 13
went 13
with 13
a 13
slightly 13
older 13
crowdwhen 13
she 13
went 13
with 13
anyone 13
at 13
all 13
wild 13
rumors 13
were 13
circulating 13
about 13
herhow 13
her 13
mother 13
had 13
found 13
her 13
packing 13
her 13
bag 13
one 13
winter 13
night 13
to 13
go 13
to 13
new 13
york 13
and 13
say 13
goodby 13
to 13
a 13
soldier 13
who 13
was 13
going 13
overseas 13
she 13
was 13
effectually 13
prevented 13
but 13
she 13
wasnt 13
on 13
speaking 13
terms 13
with 13
her 13
family 13
for 13
several 13
weeks 13
after 13
that 13
she 13
didnt 13
play 13
around 13
with 13
the 13
soldiers 13
any 13
more 13
but 13
only 13
with 13
a 13
few 13
flatfooted 13
shortsighted 13
young 13
men 13
in 13
town 13
who 13
couldnt 13
get 13
into 13
the 13
army 13
at 13
all 13
by 13
the 13

after 13
the 13
armistice 13
and 13
in 13

from 13

june 13

chicago 13
with 13
more 13
pomp 13
and 13
circumstance 13
than 13

her 13
and 13
squeezed 13

wet 13
ball 13

only 13
let 13
me 13
leave 13
it 13
in 13
the 13
soapdish 13
when 13
she 13
saw 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
coming 13
to 13
pieces 13
like 13
snow 13
but 13
she 13
didnt 13
say 13
another 13
word 13
we 13
gave 13
her 13
spirits 13
of 13
ammonia 13
and 13
put 13
ice 13
on 13
her 13
forehead 13
and 13
hooked 13
her 13
back 13
into 13
her 13
dress 13
and 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
later 13
when 13
we 13
walked 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
room 13
the 13
pearls 13
were 13
around 13
her 13
neck 13
and 13
the 13
incident 13
was 13
over 13
next 13
day 13
at 13
five 13
oclock 13
she 13
married 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
without 13
so 13
much 13
as 13
a 13
shiver 13
and 13
started 13
off 13
on 13
a 13
three 13
months 13
trip 13
to 13
the 13
south 13
seas 13
i 13
saw 13
them 13
in 13
santa 13
barbara 13
when 13
they 13
came 13
back 13
and 13
i 13
thought 13
id 13
never 13
seen 13
a 13
girl 13
so 13
mad 13
about 13
her 13
husband 13
if 13
he 13
left 13
the 13
room 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
shed 13
look 13
around 13
uneasily 13
and 13
say 13
wheres 13
tom 13
gone 13
and 13
wear 13
the 13
most 13
abstracted 13
expression 13
until 13
she 13
saw 13
him 13
coming 13
in 13
the 13
door 13
she 13
used 13
to 13
sit 13
on 13
the 13
sand 13
with 13
his 13
head 13
in 13
her 13
lap 13
by 13
the 13
hour 13
rubbing 13
her 13
fingers 13
over 13
his 13
eyes 13
and 13
looking 13
at 13
him 13
with 13
unfathomable 13
delight 13
it 13
was 13
touching 13
to 13
see 13
them 13
togetherit 13
made 13
you 13
laugh 13
in 13
a 13
hushed 13
fascinated 13
way 13
that 13
was 13
in 13
august 13
a 13
week 13
after 13
i 13
left 13
santa 13
barbara 13
tom 13
ran 13
into 13
a 13
wagon 13
on 13
the 13
ventura 13
road 13
one 13
night 13
and 13
ripped 13
a 13
front 13
wheel 13
off 13
his 13
car 13
the 13
girl 13
who 13
was 13
with 13
him 13
got 13
into 13
the 13
papers 13
too 13
because 13
her 13
arm 13
was 13
brokenshe 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
chambermaids 13
in 13
the 13
santa 13
barbara 13
hotel 13
the 13
next 13
april 13
daisy 13
had 13
her 13
little 13
girl 13
and 13
they 13
went 13
to 13
france 13
for 13
a 13
year 13
i 13
saw 13
them 13
one 13
spring 13
in 13
cannes 13
and 13
later 13
in 13
deauville 13
and 13
then 13
they 13
came 13
back 13
to 13
chicago 13
to 13
settle 13
down 13
daisy 13
was 13
popular 13
in 13
chicago 13
as 13
you 13
know 13
they 13
moved 13
with 13
a 13
fast 13
crowd 13
all 13
of 13
them 13
young 13
and 13
rich 13
and 13
wild 13
but 13
she 13
came 13
out 13
with 13
an 13
absolutely 13
perfect 13
reputation 13
perhaps 13
because 13
she 13
doesnt 13
drink 13
its 13
a 13
great 13
advantage 13
not 13
to 13
drink 13
among 13
harddrinking 13
people 13
you 13
can 13
hold 13
your 13
tongue 13
and 13
moreover 13
you 13
can 13
time 13
any 13
little 13
irregularity 13
of 13
your 13
own 13
so 13
that 13
everybody 13
else 13
is 13
so 13
blind 13
that 13
they 13
dont 13
see 13
or 13
care 13
perhaps 13
daisy 13
never 13
went 13
in 13
for 13
amour 13
at 13
alland 13
yet 13
theres 13
something 13
in 13
that 13
voice 13
of 13
hers 13
well 13
about 13
six 13
weeks 13
ago 13
she 13
heard 13
the 13
name 13
gatsby 13
for 13
the 13
first 13
time 13
in 13
years 13
it 13
was 13
when 13
i 13
asked 13
youdo 13
you 13
rememberif 13
you 13
knew 13
gatsby 13
in 13
west 13
egg 13
after 13
you 13
had 13
gone 13
home 13
she 13
came 13
into 13
my 13
room 13
and 13
woke 13
me 13
up 13
and 13
said 13
what 13
gatsby 13
and 13
when 13
i 13
described 13
himi 13
was 13
half 13
asleepshe 13
said 13
in 13
the 13
strangest 13
voice 13
that 13
it 13
must 13
be 13
the 13
man 13
she 13
used 13
to 13
know 13
it 13
wasnt 13
until 13
then 13
that 13
i 13
connected 13
this 13
gatsby 13
with 13
the 13
officer 13
in 13
her 13
white 13
car 13
when 13
jordan 13
baker 13
had 13
finished 13
telling 13
all 13
this 13
we 13
had 13
left 13
the 13
plaza 13
for 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
and 13
were 13
driving 13
in 13
a 13
victoria 13
through 13
central 13
park 13
the 13
sun 13
had 13
gone 13
down 13
behind 13
the 13
tall 13
apartments 13
of 13
the 13
movie 13
stars 13
in 13
the 13
west 13
fifties 13
and 13
the 13
clear 13
voices 13
of 13
girls 13
already 13
gathered 13
like 13
crickets 13
on 13
the 13
grass 13
rose 13
through 13
the 13
hot 13
twilight 13
im 13
the 13
sheik 13
of 13
araby 13
your 13
love 13
belongs 13
to 13
me 13
at 13
night 13
when 13
youre 13
are 13
asleep 13
into 13
your 13
tent 13
ill 13
creep 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
strange 13
coincidence 13
i 13
said 13
but 13
it 13
wasnt 13
a 13
coincidence 13
at 13
all 13
why 13
not 13
gatsby 13
bought 13
that 13
house 13
so 13
that 13
daisy 13
would 13
be 13
just 13
across 13
the 13
bay 13
then 13
it 13
had 13
not 13
been 13
merely 13
the 13
stars 13
to 13
which 13
he 13
had 13
aspired 13
on 13
that 13
june 13
night 13
he 13
came 13
alive 13
to 13
me 13
delivered 13
suddenly 13
from 13
the 13
womb 13
of 13
his 13
purposeless 13
splendor 13
he 13
wants 13
to 13
know 13
continued 13
jordan 13
if 13
youll 13
invite 13
daisy 13
to 13
your 13
house 13
some 13
afternoon 13
and 13
then 13
let 13
him 13
come 13
over 13
the 13
modesty 13
of 13
the 13
demand 13
shook 13
me 13
he 13
had 13
waited 13
five 13
years 13
and 13
bought 13
a 13
mansion 13
where 13
he 13
dispensed 13
starlight 13
to 13
casual 13
mothsso 13
that 13
he 13
could 13
come 13
over 13
some 13
afternoon 13
to 13
a 13
strangers 13
garden 13
did 13
i 13
have 13
to 13
know 13
all 13
this 13
before 13
he 13
could 13
ask 13
such 13
a 13
little 13
thing 13
hes 13
afraid 13
hes 13
waited 13
so 13
long 13
he 13
thought 13
you 13
might 13
be 13
offended 13
you 13
see 13
hes 13
a 13
regular 13
tough 13
underneath 13
it 13
all 13
something 13
worried 13
me 13
why 13
didnt 13
he 13
ask 13
you 13
to 13
arrange 13
a 13
meeting 13
he 13
wants 13
her 13
to 13
see 13
his 13
house 13
she 13
explained 13
and 13
your 13
house 13
is 13
right 13
next 13
door 13
oh 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
half 13
expected 13
her 13
to 13
wander 13
into 13
one 13
of 13
his 13
parties 13
some 13
night 13
went 13
on 13
jordan 13
but 13
she 13
never 13
did 13
then 13
he 13
began 13
asking 13
people 13
casually 13
if 13
they 13
knew 13
her 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
the 13
first 13
one 13
he 13
found 13
it 13
was 13
that 13
night 13
he 13
sent 13
for 13
me 13
at 13
his 13
dance 13
and 13
you 13
should 13
have 13
heard 13
the 13
elaborate 13
way 13
he 13
worked 13
up 13
to 13
it 13
of 13
course 13
i 13
immediately 13
suggested 13
a 13
luncheon 13
in 13
new 13
yorkand 13
i 13
thought 13
hed 13
go 13
mad 13
i 13
dont 13
want 13
to 13
do 13
anything 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
way 13
he 13
kept 13
saying 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
see 13
her 13
right 13
next 13
door 13
when 13
i 13
said 13
you 13
were 13
a 13
particular 13
friend 13
of 13
toms 13
he 13
started 13
to 13
abandon 13
the 13
whole 13
idea 13
he 13
doesnt 13
know 13
very 13
much 13
about 13
tom 13
though 13
he 13
says 13
hes 13
read 13
a 13
chicago 13
paper 13
for 13
years 13
just 13
on 13
the 13
chance 13
of 13
catching 13
a 13
glimpse 13
of 13
daisys 13
name 13
it 13
was 13
dark 13
now 13
and 13
as 13
we 13
dipped 13
under 13
a 13
little 13
bridge 13
i 13
put 13
my 13
arm 13
around 13
jordans 13
golden 13
shoulder 13
and 13
drew 13
her 13
toward 13
me 13
and 13
asked 13
her 13
to 13
dinner 13
suddenly 13
i 13
wasnt 13
thinking 13
of 13
daisy 13
and 13
gatsby 13
any 13
more 13
but 13
of 13
this 13
clean 13
hard 13
limited 13
person 13
who 13
dealt 13
in 13
universal 13
scepticism 13
and 13
who 13
leaned 13
back 13
jauntily 13
just 13
within 13
the 13
circle 13
of 13
my 13
arm 13
a 13
phrase 13
began 13
to 13
beat 13
in 13
my 13
ears 13
with 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
heady 13
excitement 13
there 13
are 13
only 13
the 13
pursued 13
the 13
pursuing 13
the 13
busy 13
and 13
the 13
tired 13
and 13
daisy 13
ought 13
to 13
have 13
something 13
in 13
her 13
life 13
murmured 13
jordan 13
to 13
me 13
does 13
she 13
want 13
to 13
see 13
gatsby 13
shes 13
not 13
to 13
know 13
about 13
it 13
gatsby 13
doesnt 13
want 13
her 13
to 13
know 13
youre 13
just 13
supposed 13
to 13
invite 13
her 13
to 13
tea 13
we 13
passed 13
a 13
barrier 13
of 13
dark 13
trees 13
and 13
then 13
the 13
facade 13
of 13
fiftyninth 13
street 13
a 13
block 13
of 13
delicate 13
pale 13
light 13
beamed 13
down 13
into 13
the 13
park 13
unlike 13
gatsby 13
and 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
i 13
had 13
no 13
girl 13
whose 13
disembodied 13
face 13
floated 13
along 13
the 13
dark 13
cornices 13
and 13
blinding 13
signs 13
and 13
so 13
i 13
drew 13
up 13
the 13
girl 13
beside 13
me 13
tightening 13
my 13
arms 13
her 13
wan 13
scornful 13
mouth 13
smiled 13
and 13
so 13
i 13
drew 13
her 13
up 13
again 13
closer 13
this 13
time 13
to 13
my 13
face 13
chapter 13
when 13
i 13
came 13
home 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
that 13
night 13
i 13
was 13
afraid 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
that 13
my 13
house 13
was 13
on 13
fire 13
two 13
oclock 13
and 13
the 13
whole 13
corner 13
of 13
the 13
peninsula 13
was 13
blazing 13
with 13
light 13
which 13
fell 13
unreal 13
on 13
the 13
shrubbery 13
and 13
made 13
thin 13
elongating 13
glints 13
upon 13
the 13
roadside 13
wires 13
turning 13
a 13
corner 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
lit 13
from 13
tower 13
to 13
cellar 13
at 13
first 13
i 13
thought 13
it 13
was 13
another 13
party 13
a 13
wild 13
rout 13
that 13
had 13
resolved 13
itself 13
into 13
hideandgoseek 13
or 13
sardinesinthebox 13
with 13
all 13
the 13
house 13
thrown 13
open 13
to 13
the 13
game 13
but 13
there 13
wasnt 13
a 13
sound 13
only 13
wind 13
in 13
the 13
trees 13
which 13
blew 13
the 13
wires 13
and 13
made 13
the 13
lights 13
go 13
off 13
and 13
on 13
again 13
as 13
if 13
the 13
house 13
had 13
winked 13
into 13
the 13
darkness 13
as 13
my 13
taxi 13
groaned 13
away 13
i 13
saw 13
gatsby 13
walking 13
toward 13
me 13
across 13
his 13
lawn 13
your 13
place 13
looks 13
like 13
the 13
worlds 13
fair 13
i 13
said 13
does 13
it 13
he 13
turned 13
his 13
eyes 13
toward 13
it 13
absently 13
i 13
have 13
been 13
glancing 13
into 13
some 13
of 13
the 13
rooms 13
lets 13
go 13
to 13
coney 13
island 13
old 13
sport 13
in 13
my 13
car 13
its 13
too 13
late 13
well 13
suppose 13
we 13
take 13
a 13
plunge 13
in 13
the 13
swimmingpool 13
i 13
havent 13
made 13
use 13
of 13
it 13
all 13
summer 13
ive 13
got 13
to 13
go 13
to 13
bed 13
all 13
right 13
he 13
waited 13
looking 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
suppressed 13
eagerness 13
i 13
talked 13
with 13
miss 13
baker 13
i 13
said 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
call 13
up 13
daisy 13
tomorrow 13
and 13
invite 13
her 13
over 13
here 13
to 13
tea 13
oh 13
thats 13
all 13
right 13
he 13
said 13
carelessly 13
i 13
dont 13
want 13
to 13
put 13
you 13
to 13
any 13
trouble 13
what 13
day 13
would 13
suit 13
you 13
what 13
day 13
would 13
suit 13
you 13
he 13
corrected 13
me 13
quickly 13
i 13
dont 13
want 13
to 13
put 13
you 13
to 13
any 13
trouble 13
you 13
see 13
how 13
about 13
the 13
day 13
after 13
tomorrow 13
he 13
considered 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
then 13
with 13
reluctance 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
get 13
the 13
grass 13
cut 13
he 13
said 13
we 13
both 13
looked 13
at 13
the 13
grassthere 13
was 13
a 13
sharp 13
line 13
where 13
my 13
ragged 13
lawn 13
ended 13
and 13
the 13
darker 13
wellkept 13
expanse 13
of 13
his 13
began 13
i 13
suspected 13
that 13
he 13
meant 13
my 13
grass 13
theres 13
another 13
little 13
thing 13
he 13
said 13
uncertainly 13
and 13
hesitated 13
would 13
you 13
rather 13
put 13
it 13
off 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
days 13
i 13
asked 13
oh 13
it 13
isnt 13
about 13
that 13
at 13
least 13
he 13
fumbled 13
with 13
a 13
series 13
of 13
beginnings 13
why 13
i 13
thoughtwhy 13
look 13
here 13
old 13
sport 13
you 13
dont 13
make 13
much 13
money 13
do 13
you 13
not 13
very 13
much 13
this 13
seemed 13
to 13
reassure 13
him 13
and 13
he 13
continued 13
more 13
confidently 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
didnt 13
if 13
youll 13
pardon 13
myyou 13
see 13
i 13
carry 13
on 13
a 13
little 13
business 13
on 13
the 13
side 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
side 13
line 13
you 13
understand 13
and 13
i 13
thought 13
that 13
if 13
you 13
dont 13
make 13
very 13
muchyoure 13
selling 13
bonds 13
arent 13
you 13
old 13
sport 13
trying 13
to 13
well 13
this 13
would 13
interest 13
you 13
it 13
wouldnt 13
take 13
up 13
much 13
of 13
your 13
time 13
and 13
you 13
might 13
pick 13
up 13
a 13
nice 13
bit 13
of 13
money 13
it 13
happens 13
to 13
be 13
a 13
rather 13
confidential 13
sort 13
of 13
thing 13
i 13
realize 13
now 13
that 13
under 13
different 13
circumstances 13
that 13
conversation 13
might 13
have 13
been 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
crises 13
of 13
my 13
life 13
but 13
because 13
the 13
offer 13
was 13
obviously 13
and 13
tactlessly 13
for 13
a 13
service 13
to 13
be 13
rendered 13
i 13
had 13
no 13
choice 13
except 13
to 13
cut 13
him 13
off 13
there 13
ive 13
got 13
my 13
hands 13
full 13
i 13
said 13
im 13
much 13
obliged 13
but 13
i 13
couldnt 13
take 13
on 13
any 13
more 13
work 13
you 13
wouldnt 13
have 13
to 13
do 13
any 13
business 13
with 13
wolfshiem 13
evidently 13
he 13
thought 13
that 13
i 13
was 13
shying 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
gonnegtion 13
mentioned 13
at 13
lunch 13
but 13
i 13
assured 13
him 13
he 13
was 13
wrong 13
he 13
waited 13
a 13
moment 13
longer 13
hoping 13
id 13
begin 13
a 13
conversation 13
but 13
i 13
was 13
too 13
absorbed 13
to 13
be 13
responsive 13
so 13
he 13
went 13
unwillingly 13
home 13
the 13
evening 13
had 13
made 13
me 13
lightheaded 13
and 13
happy 13
i 13
think 13
i 13
walked 13
into 13
a 13
deep 13
sleep 13
as 13
i 13
entered 13
my 13
front 13
door 13
so 13
i 13
didnt 13
know 13
whether 13
or 13
not 13
gatsby 13
went 13
to 13
coney 13
island 13
or 13
for 13
how 13
many 13
hours 13
he 13
glanced 13
into 13
rooms 13
while 13
his 13
house 13
blazed 13
gaudily 13
on 13
i 13
called 13
up 13
daisy 13
from 13
the 13
office 13
next 13
morning 13
and 13
invited 13
her 13
to 13
come 13
to 13
tea 13
dont 13
bring 13
tom 13
i 13
warned 13
her 13
what 13
dont 13
bring 13
tom 13
who 13
is 13
tom 13
she 13
asked 13
innocently 13
the 13
day 13
agreed 13
upon 13
was 13
pouring 13
rain 13
at 13
eleven 13
oclock 13
a 13
man 13
in 13
a 13
raincoat 13
dragging 13
a 13
lawnmower 13
tapped 13
at 13
my 13
front 13
door 13
and 13
said 13
that 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
had 13
sent 13
him 13
over 13
to 13
cut 13
my 13
grass 13
this 13
reminded 13
me 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
forgotten 13
to 13
tell 13
my 13
finn 13
to 13
come 13
back 13
so 13
i 13
drove 13
into 13
west 13
egg 13
village 13
to 13
search 13
for 13
her 13
among 13
soggy 13
whitewashed 13
alleys 13
and 13
to 13
buy 13
some 13
cups 13
and 13
lemons 13
and 13
flowers 13
the 13
flowers 13
were 13
unnecessary 13
for 13
at 13
two 13
oclock 13
a 13
greenhouse 13
arrived 13
from 13
gatsbys 13
with 13
innumerable 13
receptacles 13
to 13
contain 13
it 13
an 13
hour 13
later 13
the 13
front 13
door 13
opened 13
nervously 13
and 13
gatsby 13
in 13
a 13
white 13
flannel 13
suit 13
silver 13
shirt 13
and 13
goldcolored 13
tie 13
hurried 13
in 13
he 13
was 13
pale 13
and 13
there 13
were 13
dark 13
signs 13
of 13
sleeplessness 13
beneath 13
his 13
eyes 13
is 13
everything 13
all 13
right 13
he 13
asked 13
immediately 13
the 13
grass 13
looks 13
fine 13
if 13
thats 13
what 13
you 13
mean 13
what 13
grass 13
he 13
inquired 13
blankly 13
oh 13
the 13
grass 13
in 13
the 13
yard 13
he 13
looked 13
out 13
the 13
window 13
at 13
it 13
but 13
judging 13
from 13
his 13
expression 13
i 13
dont 13
believe 13
he 13
saw 13
a 13
thing 13
looks 13
very 13
good 13
he 13
remarked 13
vaguely 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
papers 13
said 13
they 13
thought 13
the 13
rain 13
would 13
stop 13
about 13
four 13
i 13
think 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
journal 13
have 13
you 13
got 13
everything 13
you 13
need 13
in 13
the 13
shape 13
ofof 13
tea 13
i 13
took 13
him 13
into 13
the 13
pantry 13
where 13
he 13
looked 13
a 13
little 13
reproachfully 13
at 13
the 13
finn 13
together 13
we 13
scrutinized 13
the 13
twelve 13
lemon 13
cakes 13
from 13
the 13
delicatessen 13
shop 13
will 13
they 13
do 13
i 13
asked 13
of 13
course 13
of 13
course 13
theyre 13
fine 13
and 13
he 13
added 13
hollowly 13
old 13
sport 13
the 13
rain 13
cooled 13
about 13
halfpast 13
three 13
to 13
a 13
damp 13
mist 13
through 13
which 13
occasional 13
thin 13
drops 13
swam 13
like 13
dew 13
gatsby 13
looked 13
with 13
vacant 13
eyes 13
through 13
a 13
copy 13
of 13
clays 13
economics 13
starting 13
at 13
the 13
finnish 13
tread 13
that 13
shook 13
the 13
kitchen 13
floor 13
and 13
peering 13
toward 13
the 13
bleared 13
windows 13
from 13
time 13
to 13
time 13
as 13
if 13
a 13
series 13
of 13
invisible 13
but 13
alarming 13
happenings 13
were 13
taking 13
place 13
outside 13
finally 13
he 13
got 13
up 13
and 13
informed 13
me 13
in 13
an 13
uncertain 13
voice 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
going 13
home 13
whys 13
that 13
nobodys 13
coming 13
to 13
tea 13
its 13
too 13
late 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
his 13
watch 13
as 13
if 13
there 13
was 13
some 13
pressing 13
demand 13
on 13
his 13
time 13
elsewhere 13
i 13
cant 13
wait 13
all 13
day 13
dont 13
be 13
silly 13
its 13
just 13
two 13
minutes 13
to 13
four 13
he 13
sat 13
down 13
miserably 13
as 13
if 13
i 13
had 13
pushed 13
him 13
and 13
simultaneously 13
there 13
was 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
a 13
motor 13
turning 13
into 13
my 13
lane 13
we 13
both 13
jumped 13
up 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
harrowed 13
myself 13
i 13
went 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
yard 13
under 13
the 13
dripping 13
bare 13
lilactrees 13
a 13
large 13
open 13
car 13
was 13
coming 13
up 13
the 13
drive 13
it 13
stopped 13
daisys 13
face 13
tipped 13
sideways 13
beneath 13
a 13
threecornered 13
lavender 13
hat 13
looked 13
out 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
a 13
bright 13
ecstatic 13
smile 13
is 13
this 13
absolutely 13
where 13
you 13
live 13
my 13
dearest 13
one 13
the 13
exhilarating 13
ripple 13
of 13
her 13
voice 13
was 13
a 13
wild 13
tonic 13
in 13
the 13
rain 13
i 13
had 13
to 13
follow 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
it 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
with 13
my 13
ear 13
alone 13
before 13
any 13
words 13
came 13
through 13
a 13
damp 13
streak 13
of 13
hair 13
lay 13
like 13
a 13
dash 13
of 13
blue 13
paint 13
across 13
her 13
cheek 13
and 13
her 13
hand 13
was 13
wet 13
with 13
glistening 13
drops 13
as 13
i 13
took 13
it 13
to 13
help 13
her 13
from 13
the 13
car 13
are 13
you 13
in 13
love 13
with 13
me 13
she 13
said 13
low 13
in 13
my 13
ear 13
or 13
why 13
did 13
i 13
have 13
to 13
come 13
alone 13
thats 13
the 13
secret 13
of 13
castle 13
rackrent 13
tell 13
your 13
chauffeur 13
to 13
go 13
far 13
away 13
and 13
spend 13
an 13
hour 13
come 13
back 13
in 13
an 13
hour 13
ferdie 13
then 13
in 13
a 13
grave 13
murmur 13
his 13
name 13
is 13
ferdie 13
does 13
the 13
gasoline 13
affect 13
his 13
nose 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
so 13
she 13
said 13
innocently 13
why 13
we 13
went 13
in 13
to 13
my 13
overwhelming 13
surprise 13
the 13
livingroom 13
was 13
deserted 13
well 13
thats 13
funny 13
i 13
exclaimed 13
whats 13
funny 13
she 13
turned 13
her 13
head 13
as 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
light 13
dignified 13
knocking 13
at 13
the 13
front 13
door 13
i 13
went 13
out 13
and 13
opened 13
it 13
gatsby 13
pale 13
as 13
death 13
with 13
his 13
hands 13
plunged 13
like 13
weights 13
in 13
his 13
coat 13
pockets 13
was 13
standing 13
in 13
a 13
puddle 13
of 13
water 13
glaring 13
tragically 13
into 13
my 13
eyes 13
with 13
his 13
hands 13
still 13
in 13
his 13
coat 13
pockets 13
he 13
stalked 13
by 13
me 13
into 13
the 13
hall 13
turned 13
sharply 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
were 13
on 13
a 13
wire 13
and 13
disappeared 13
into 13
the 13
livingroom 13
it 13
wasnt 13
a 13
bit 13
funny 13
aware 13
of 13
the 13
loud 13
beating 13
of 13
my 13
own 13
heart 13
i 13
pulled 13
the 13
door 13
to 13
against 13
the 13
increasing 13
rain 13
for 13
half 13
a 13
minute 13
there 13
wasnt 13
a 13
sound 13
then 13
from 13
the 13
livingroom 13
i 13
heard 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
choking 13
murmur 13
and 13
part 13
of 13
a 13
laugh 13
followed 13
by 13
daisys 13
voice 13
on 13
a 13
clear 13
artificial 13
note 13
i 13
certainly 13
am 13
awfully 13
glad 13
to 13
see 13
you 13
again 13
a 13
pause 13
it 13
endured 13
horribly 13
i 13
had 13
nothing 13
to 13
do 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
so 13
i 13
went 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
gatsby 13
his 13
hands 13
still 13
in 13
his 13
pockets 13
was 13
reclining 13
against 13
the 13
mantelpiece 13
in 13
a 13
strained 13
counterfeit 13
of 13
perfect 13
ease 13
even 13
of 13
boredom 13
his 13
head 13
leaned 13
back 13
so 13
far 13
that 13
it 13
rested 13
against 13
the 13
face 13
of 13
a 13
defunct 13
mantelpiece 13
clock 13
and 13
from 13
this 13
position 13
his 13
distraught 13
eyes 13
stared 13
down 13
at 13
daisy 13
who 13
was 13
sitting 13
frightened 13
but 13
graceful 13
on 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
a 13
stiff 13
chair 13
weve 13
met 13
before 13
muttered 13
gatsby 13
his 13
eyes 13
glanced 13
momentarily 13
at 13
me 13
and 13
his 13
lips 13
parted 13
with 13
an 13
abortive 13
attempt 13
at 13
a 13
laugh 13
luckily 13
the 13
clock 13
took 13
this 13
moment 13
to 13
tilt 13
dangerously 13
at 13
the 13
pressure 13
of 13
his 13
head 13
whereupon 13
he 13
turned 13
and 13
caught 13
it 13
with 13
trembling 13
fingers 13
and 13
set 13
it 13
back 13
in 13
place 13
then 13
he 13
sat 13
down 13
rigidly 13
his 13
elbow 13
on 13
the 13
arm 13
of 13
the 13
sofa 13
and 13
his 13
chin 13
in 13
his 13
hand 13
im 13
sorry 13
about 13
the 13
clock 13
he 13
said 13
my 13
own 13
face 13
had 13
now 13
assumed 13
a 13
deep 13
tropical 13
burn 13
i 13
couldnt 13
muster 13
up 13
a 13
single 13
commonplace 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
thousand 13
in 13
my 13
head 13
its 13
an 13
old 13
clock 13
i 13
told 13
them 13
idiotically 13
i 13
think 13
we 13
all 13
believed 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
that 13
it 13
had 13
smashed 13
in 13
pieces 13
on 13
the 13
floor 13
we 13
havent 13
met 13
for 13
many 13
years 13
said 13
daisy 13
her 13
voice 13
as 13
matteroffact 13
as 13
it 13
could 13
ever 13
be 13
five 13
years 13
next 13
november 13
the 13
automatic 13
quality 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
answer 13
set 13
us 13
all 13
back 13
at 13
least 13
another 13
minute 13
i 13
had 13
them 13
both 13
on 13
their 13
feet 13
with 13
the 13
desperate 13
suggestion 13
that 13
they 13
help 13
me 13
make 13
tea 13
in 13
the 13
kitchen 13
when 13
the 13
demoniac 13
finn 13
brought 13
it 13
in 13
on 13
a 13
tray 13
amid 13
the 13
welcome 13
confusion 13
of 13
cups 13
and 13
cakes 13
a 13
certain 13
physical 13
decency 13
established 13
itself 13
gatsby 13
got 13
himself 13
into 13
a 13
shadow 13
and 13
while 13
daisy 13
and 13
i 13
talked 13
looked 13
conscientiously 13
from 13
one 13
to 13
the 13
other 13
of 13
us 13
with 13
tense 13
unhappy 13
eyes 13
however 13
as 13
calmness 13
wasnt 13
an 13
end 13
in 13
itself 13
i 13
made 13
an 13
excuse 13
at 13
the 13
first 13
possible 13
moment 13
and 13
got 13
to 13
my 13
feet 13
where 13
are 13
you 13
going 13
demanded 13
gatsby 13
in 13
immediate 13
alarm 13
ill 13
be 13
back 13
ive 13
got 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
you 13
about 13
something 13
before 13
you 13
go 13
he 13
followed 13
me 13
wildly 13
into 13
the 13
kitchen 13
closed 13
the 13
door 13
and 13
whispered 13
oh 13
god 13
in 13
a 13
miserable 13
way 13
whats 13
the 13
matter 13
this 13
is 13
a 13
terrible 13
mistake 13
he 13
said 13
shaking 13
his 13
head 13
from 13
side 13
to 13
side 13
a 13
terrible 13
terrible 13
mistake 13
youre 13
just 13
embarrassed 13
thats 13
all 13
and 13
luckily 13
i 13
added 13
daisys 13
embarrassed 13
too 13
shes 13
embarrassed 13
he 13
repeated 13
incredulously 13
just 13
as 13
much 13
as 13
you 13
are 13
dont 13
talk 13
so 13
loud 13
youre 13
acting 13
like 13
a 13
little 13
boy 13
i 13
broke 13
out 13
impatiently 13
not 13
only 13
that 13
but 13
youre 13
rude 13
daisys 13
sitting 13
in 13
there 13
all 13
alone 13
he 13
raised 13
his 13
hand 13
to 13
stop 13
my 13
words 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
unforgettable 13
reproach 13
and 13
opening 13
the 13
door 13
cautiously 13
went 13
back 13
into 13
the 13
other 13
room 13
i 13
walked 13
out 13
the 13
back 13
wayjust 13
as 13
gatsby 13
had 13
when 13
he 13
had 13
made 13
his 13
nervous 13
circuit 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
beforeand 13
ran 13
for 13
a 13
huge 13
black 13
knotted 13
tree 13
whose 13
massed 13
leaves 13
made 13
a 13
fabric 13
against 13
the 13
rain 13
once 13
more 13
it 13
was 13
pouring 13
and 13
my 13
irregular 13
lawn 13
wellshaved 13
by 13
gatsbys 13
gardener 13
abounded 13
in 13
small 13
muddy 13
swamps 13
and 13
prehistoric 13
marshes 13
there 13
was 13
nothing 13
to 13
look 13
at 13
from 13
under 13
the 13
tree 13
except 13
gatsbys 13
enormous 13
house 13
so 13
i 13
stared 13
at 13
it 13
like 13
kant 13
at 13
his 13
church 13
steeple 13
for 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
a 13
brewer 13
had 13
built 13
it 13
early 13
in 13
the 13
period 13
craze 13
a 13
decade 13
before 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
story 13
that 13
hed 13
agreed 13
to 13
pay 13
five 13
years 13
taxes 13
on 13
all 13
the 13
neighboring 13
cottages 13
if 13
the 13
owners 13
would 13
have 13
their 13
roofs 13
thatched 13
with 13
straw 13
perhaps 13
their 13
refusal 13
took 13
the 13
heart 13
out 13
of 13
his 13
plan 13
to 13
found 13
a 13
familyhe 13
went 13
into 13
an 13
immediate 13
decline 13
his 13
children 13
sold 13
his 13
house 13
with 13
the 13
black 13
wreath 13
still 13
on 13
the 13
door 13
americans 13
while 13
occasionally 13
willing 13
to 13
be 13
serfs 13
have 13
always 13
been 13
obstinate 13
about 13
being 13
peasantry 13
after 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
the 13
sun 13
shone 13
again 13
and 13
the 13
grocers 13
automobile 13
rounded 13
gatsbys 13
drive 13
with 13
the 13
raw 13
material 13
for 13
his 13
servants 13
dinneri 13
felt 13
sure 13
he 13
wouldnt 13
eat 13
a 13
spoonful 13
a 13
maid 13
began 13
opening 13
the 13
upper 13
windows 13
of 13
his 13
house 13
appeared 13
momentarily 13
in 13
each 13
and 13
leaning 13
from 13
a 13
large 13
central 13
bay 13
spat 13
meditatively 13
into 13
the 13
garden 13
it 13
was 13
time 13
i 13
went 13
back 13
while 13
the 13
rain 13
continued 13
it 13
had 13
seemed 13
like 13
the 13
murmur 13
of 13
their 13
voices 13
rising 13
and 13
swelling 13
a 13
little 13
now 13
and 13
then 13
with 13
gusts 13
of 13
emotion 13
but 13
in 13
the 13
new 13
silence 13
i 13
felt 13
that 13
silence 13
had 13
fallen 13
within 13
the 13
house 13
too 13
i 13
went 13
inafter 13
making 13
every 13
possible 13
noise 13
in 13
the 13
kitchen 13
short 13
of 13
pushing 13
over 13
the 13
stovebut 13
i 13
dont 13
believe 13
they 13
heard 13
a 13
sound 13
they 13
were 13
sitting 13
at 13
either 13
end 13
of 13
the 13
couch 13
looking 13
at 13
each 13
other 13
as 13
if 13
some 13
question 13
had 13
been 13
asked 13
or 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
and 13
every 13
vestige 13
of 13
embarrassment 13
was 13
gone 13
daisys 13
face 13
was 13
smeared 13
with 13
tears 13
and 13
when 13
i 13
came 13
in 13
she 13
jumped 13
up 13
and 13
began 13
wiping 13
at 13
it 13
with 13
her 13
handkerchief 13
before 13
a 13
mirror 13
but 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
change 13
in 13
gatsby 13
that 13
was 13
simply 13
confounding 13
he 13
literally 13
glowed 13
without 13
a 13
word 13
or 13
a 13
gesture 13
of 13
exultation 13
a 13
new 13
wellbeing 13
radiated 13
from 13
him 13
and 13
filled 13
the 13
little 13
room 13
oh 13
hello 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
said 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
hadnt 13
seen 13
me 13
for 13
years 13
i 13
thought 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
he 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
shake 13
hands 13
its 13
stopped 13
raining 13
has 13
it 13
when 13
he 13
realized 13
what 13
i 13
was 13
talking 13
about 13
that 13
there 13
were 13
twinklebells 13
of 13
sunshine 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
he 13
smiled 13
like 13
a 13
weather 13
man 13
like 13
an 13
ecstatic 13
patron 13
of 13
recurrent 13
light 13
and 13
repeated 13
the 13
news 13
to 13
daisy 13
what 13
do 13
you 13
think 13
of 13
that 13
its 13
stopped 13
raining 13
im 13
glad 13
jay 13
her 13
throat 13
full 13
of 13
aching 13
grieving 13
beauty 13
told 13
only 13
of 13
her 13
unexpected 13
joy 13
i 13
want 13
you 13
and 13
daisy 13
to 13
come 13
over 13
to 13
my 13
house 13
he 13
said 13
id 13
like 13
to 13
show 13
her 13
around 13
youre 13
sure 13
you 13
want 13
me 13
to 13
come 13
absolutely 13
old 13
sport 13
daisy 13
went 13
upstairs 13
to 13
wash 13
her 13
facetoo 13
late 13
i 13
thought 13
with 13
humiliation 13
of 13
my 13
towelswhile 13
gatsby 13
and 13
i 13
waited 13
on 13
the 13
lawn 13
my 13
house 13
looks 13
well 13
doesnt 13
it 13
he 13
demanded 13
see 13
how 13
the 13
whole 13
front 13
of 13
it 13
catches 13
the 13
light 13
i 13
agreed 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
splendid 13
yes 13
his 13
eyes 13
went 13
over 13
it 13
every 13
arched 13
door 13
and 13
square 13
tower 13
it 13
took 13
me 13
just 13
three 13
years 13
to 13
earn 13
the 13
money 13
that 13
bought 13
it 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
inherited 13
your 13
money 13
i 13
did 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
said 13
automatically 13
but 13
i 13
lost 13
most 13
of 13
it 13
in 13
the 13
big 13
panicthe 13
panic 13
of 13
the 13
war 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
hardly 13
knew 13
what 13
he 13
was 13
saying 13
for 13
when 13
i 13
asked 13
him 13
what 13
business 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
he 13
answered 13
thats 13
my 13
affair 13
before 13
he 13
realized 13
that 13
it 13
wasnt 13
the 13
appropriate 13
reply 13
oh 13
ive 13
been 13
in 13
several 13
things 13
he 13
corrected 13
himself 13
i 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
drug 13
business 13
and 13
then 13
i 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
oil 13
business 13
but 13
im 13
not 13
in 13
either 13
one 13
now 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
with 13
more 13
attention 13
do 13
you 13
mean 13
youve 13
been 13
thinking 13
over 13
what 13
i 13
proposed 13
the 13
other 13
night 13
before 13
i 13
could 13
answer 13
daisy 13
came 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
and 13
two 13
rows 13
of 13
brass 13
buttons 13
on 13
her 13
dress 13
gleamed 13
in 13
the 13
sunlight 13
that 13
huge 13
place 13
there 13
she 13
cried 13
pointing 13
do 13
you 13
like 13
it 13
i 13
love 13
it 13
but 13
i 13
dont 13
see 13
how 13
you 13
live 13
there 13
all 13
alone 13
i 13
keep 13
it 13
always 13
full 13
of 13
interesting 13
people 13
night 13
and 13
day 13
people 13
who 13
do 13
interesting 13
things 13
celebrated 13
people 13
instead 13
of 13
taking 13
the 13
short 13
cut 13
along 13
the 13
sound 13
we 13
went 13
down 13
the 13
road 13
and 13
entered 13
by 13
the 13
big 13
postern 13
with 13
enchanting 13
murmurs 13
daisy 13
admired 13
this 13
aspect 13
or 13
that 13
of 13
the 13
feudal 13
silhouette 13
against 13
the 13
sky 13
admired 13
the 13
gardens 13
the 13
sparkling 13
odor 13
of 13
jonquils 13
and 13
the 13
frothy 13
odor 13
of 13
hawthorn 13
and 13
plum 13
blossoms 13
and 13
the 13
pale 13
gold 13
odor 13
of 13
kissmeatthegate 13
it 13
was 13
strange 13
to 13
reach 13
the 13
marble 13
steps 13
and 13
find 13
no 13
stir 13
of 13
bright 13
dresses 13
in 13
and 13
out 13
the 13
door 13
and 13
hear 13
no 13
sound 13
but 13
bird 13
voices 13
in 13
the 13
trees 13
and 13
inside 13
as 13
we 13
wandered 13
through 13
marie 13
antoinette 13
musicrooms 13
and 13
restoration 13
salons 13
i 13
felt 13
that 13
there 13
were 13
guests 13
concealed 13
behind 13
every 13
couch 13
and 13
table 13
under 13
orders 13
to 13
be 13
breathlessly 13
silent 13
until 13
we 13
had 13
passed 13
through 13
as 13
gatsby 13
closed 13
the 13
door 13
of 13
the 13
merton 13
college 13
library 13
i 13
could 13
have 13
sworn 13
i 13
heard 13
the 13
owleyed 13
man 13
break 13
into 13
ghostly 13
laughter 13
we 13
went 13
upstairs 13
through 13

one 13
chamber 13
where 13
a 13
dishevelled 13
man 13
in 13
pajamas 13
was 13
doing 13
liver 13
exercises 13
on 13
the 13
floor 13
it 13
was 13
mr 13
klipspringer 13
the 13
boarder 13
i 13
had 13
seen 13
him 13
wandering 13
hungrily 13
about 13
the 13
beach 13
that 13
morning 13
finally 13
we 13
came 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
own 13
apartment 13
a 13
bedroom 13
and 13
a 13
bath 13
and 13
an 13
adam 13
study 13
where 13
we 13
sat 13
down 13
and 13
drank 13
a 13
glass 13
of 13
some 13
chartreuse 13
he 13
took 13
from 13
a 13
cupboard 13
in 13
the 13
wall 13
he 13
hadnt 13
once 13
ceased 13
looking 13
at 13
daisy 13
and 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
revalued 13
everything 13
in 13
his 13
house 13
according 13
to 13
the 13
measure 13
of 13
response 13
it 13
drew 13
from 13
her 13
wellloved 13
eyes 13
sometimes 13
too 13
he 13
stared 13
around 13
at 13
his 13
possessions 13
in 13
a 13
dazed 13
way 13
as 13
though 13
in 13
her 13
actual 13
and 13
astounding 13
presence 13
none 13
of 13
it 13
was 13
any 13
longer 13
real 13
once 13
he 13
nearly 13
toppled 13
down 13
a 13
flight 13
of 13
stairs 13
his 13
bedroom 13
was 13
the 13
simplest 13
room 13
of 13
allexcept 13
where 13
the 13
dresser 13
was 13
garnished 13
with 13
a 13
toilet 13
set 13
of 13
pure 13
dull 13
gold 13
daisy 13
took 13
the 13
brush 13
with 13
delight 13
and 13
smoothed 13
her 13
hair 13
whereupon 13
gatsby 13
sat 13
down 13
and 13
shaded 13
his 13
eyes 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
laugh 13
its 13
the 13
funniest 13
thing 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
said 13
hilariously 13
i 13
cantwhen 13
i 13
try 13
to 13
he 13
had 13
passed 13
visibly 13
through 13
two 13
states 13
and 13
was 13
entering 13
upon 13
a 13
third 13
after 13
his 13
embarrassment 13
and 13
his 13
unreasoning 13
joy 13
he 13
was 13
consumed 13
with 13
wonder 13
at 13
her 13
presence 13
he 13
had 13
been 13
full 13
of 13
the 13
idea 13
so 13
long 13
dreamed 13
it 13
right 13
through 13
to 13
the 13
end 13
waited 13
with 13
his 13
teeth 13
set 13
so 13
to 13
speak 13
at 13
an 13
inconceivable 13
pitch 13
of 13
intensity 13
now 13
in 13
the 13
reaction 13
he 13
was 13
running 13
down 13
like 13
an 13
overwound 13
clock 13
recovering 13
himself 13
in 13
a 13
minute 13
he 13
opened 13
for 13
us 13
two 13
hulking 13
patent 13
cabinets 13
which 13
held 13
his 13
massed 13
suits 13
and 13
dressinggowns 13
and 13
ties 13
and 13
his 13
shirts 13
piled 13
like 13
bricks 13
in 13
stacks 13
a 13
dozen 13
high 13
ive 13
got 13
a 13
man 13
in 13
england 13
who 13
buys 13
me 13
clothes 13
he 13
sends 13
over 13
a 13
selection 13
of 13
things 13
at 13
the 13
beginning 13
of 13
each 13
season 13
spring 13
and 13
fall 13
he 13
took 13
out 13
a 13
pile 13
of 13
shirts 13
and 13
began 13
throwing 13
them 13
one 13
by 13
one 13
before 13
us 13
shirts 13
of 13
sheer 13
linen 13
and 13
thick 13
silk 13
and 13
fine 13
flannel 13
which 13
lost 13
their 13
folds 13
as 13
they 13
fell 13
and 13
covered 13
the 13
table 13
in 13
manycolored 13
disarray 13
while 13
we 13
admired 13
he 13
brought 13
more 13
and 13
the 13
soft 13
rich 13
heap 13
mounted 13
highershirts 13
with 13
stripes 13
and 13
scrolls 13
and 13
plaids 13
in 13
coral 13
and 13
applegreen 13
and 13
lavender 13
and 13
faint 13
orange 13
and 13
monograms 13
of 13
indian 13
blue 13
suddenly 13
with 13
a 13
strained 13
sound 13
daisy 13
bent 13
her 13
head 13
into 13
the 13
shirts 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
cry 13
stormily 13
theyre 13
such 13
beautiful 13
shirts 13
she 13
sobbed 13
her 13
voice 13
muffled 13
in 13
the 13
thick 13
folds 13
it 13
makes 13
me 13
sad 13
because 13
ive 13
never 13
seen 13
suchsuch 13
beautiful 13
shirts 13
before 13
after 13
the 13
house 13
we 13
were 13
to 13
see 13
the 13
grounds 13
and 13
the 13
swimmingpool 13
and 13
the 13
hydroplane 13
and 13
the 13
midsummer 13
flowersbut 13
outside 13
gatsbys 13
window 13
it 13
began 13
to 13
rain 13
again 13
so 13
we 13
stood 13
in 13
a 13
row 13
looking 13
at 13
the 13
corrugated 13
surface 13
of 13
the 13
sound 13
if 13
it 13
wasnt 13
for 13
the 13
mist 13
we 13
could 13
see 13
your 13
home 13
across 13
the 13
bay 13
said 13
gatsby 13
you 13
always 13
have 13
a 13
green 13
light 13
that 13
burns 13
all 13
night 13
at 13
the 13
end 13
of 13
your 13
dock 13
daisy 13
put 13
her 13
arm 13
through 13
his 13
abruptly 13
but 13
he 13
seemed 13
absorbed 13
in 13
what 13
he 13
had 13
just 13
said 13
possibly 13
it 13
had 13
occurred 13
to 13
him 13
that 13
the 13
colossal 13
significance 13
of 13
that 13
light 13
had 13
now 13
vanished 13
forever 13
compared 13
to 13
the 13
great 13
distance 13
that 13
had 13
separated 13
him 13
from 13
daisy 13
it 13
had 13
seemed 13
very 13
near 13
to 13
her 13
almost 13
touching 13
her 13
it 13
had 13
seemed 13
as 13
close 13
as 13
a 13
star 13
to 13
the 13
moon 13
now 13
it 13
was 13
again 13
a 13
green 13
light 13
on 13
a 13
dock 13
his 13
count 13
of 13
enchanted 13
objects 13
had 13
diminished 13
by 13
one 13
i 13
began 13
to 13
walk 13
about 13
the 13
room 13
examining 13
various 13
indefinite 13
objects 13
in 13
the 13
half 13
darkness 13
a 13
large 13
photograph 13
of 13
an 13
elderly 13
man 13
in 13
yachting 13
costume 13
attracted 13
me 13

to 13
be 13
my 13
best 13
friend 13
years 13
ago 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
small 13
picture 13
of 13

in 13
yachting 13
costume 13

daisy 13
at 13
the 13
window 13
the 13
rain 13
was 13
still 13
falling 13
but 13
the 13
darkness 13
had 13
parted 13
in 13
the 13
west 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
pink 13
and 13
golden 13
billow 13
of 13
foamy 13
clouds 13
above 13
the 13
sea 13
look 13
at 13
that 13
she 13
whispered 13
and 13
then 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
id 13
like 13
to 13

to 13

then 13
but 13
they 13
wouldnt 13
hear 13
of 13
it 13
perhaps 13
my 13
presence 13
made 13
them 13
feel 13
more 13
satisfactorily 13
alone 13

embarrassed 13
slightly 13
worn 13
young 13

gatsby 13
he 13
flipped 13
a 13
switch 13
the 13
gray 13
windows 13
disappeared 13
as 13
the 13
house 13
glowed 13
full 13
of 13
light 13
in 13
the 13
musicroom 13
gatsby 13
turned 13
on 13
a 13
solitary 13
lamp 13
beside 13
the 13
piano 13
he 13
lit 13
daisys 13
cigarette 13
from 13
a 13
trembling 13
match 13
and 13
sat 13
down 13
with 13
her 13
on 13
a 13
couch 13
far 13
across 13
the 13
room 13
where 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
light 13
save 13
what 13
the 13
gleaming 13
floor 13
bounced 13
in 13
from 13
the 13
hall 13
when 13
klipspringer 13
had 13
played 13
the 13
love 13
nest 13
he 13
turned 13
around 13
on 13
the 13
bench 13
and 13
searched 13
unhappily 13
for 13

there 13

a 13
faint 13
flow 13
of 13
thunder 13
along 13
the 13
sound 13
all 13

plunging 13
home 13
through 13
the 13
rain 13
from 13
new 13
york 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
hour 13
of 13
a 13
profound 13
human 13
change 13
and 13
excitement 13
was 13
generating 13
on 13
the 13
air 13

i 13
went 13
over 13
to 13
say 13
goodby 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
the 13
expression 13
of 13
bewilderment 13
had 13
come 13
back 13
into 13
gatsbys 13
face 13
as 13
though 13
a 13
faint 13
doubt 13
had 13
occurred 13
to 13
him 13
as 13
to 13
the 13
quality 13
of 13
his 13
present 13
happiness 13
almost 13
five 13
years 13
there 13
must 13
have 13
been 13
moments 13
even 13
that 13
afternoon 13
whe 13
daisy 13
tumbled 13
short 13
of 13
his 13
dreamsnot 13
through 13
her 13
own 13
fault 13
but 13
because 13
of 13
the 13
colossal 13
vitality 13
of 13
his 13
illusion 13
it 13
had 13
gone 13
beyond 13
her 13
beyond 13
everything 13
he 13
had 13
thrown 13
himself 13
into 13
it 13
with 13
a 13
creative 13
passion 13
adding 13
to 13
it 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
decking 13
it 13
out 13
with 13
every 13
bright 13
feather 13
that 13
drifted 13
his 13
way 13
no 13
amount 13
of 13
fire 13
or 13
freshness 13
can 13
challenge 13
what 13
a 13
man 13
will 13
store 13
up 13
in 13
his 13
ghostly 13
heart 13
as 13
i 13
watched 13
him 13
he 13
adjusted 13
himself 13
a 13
little 13
visibly 13
his 13
hand 13
took 13
hold 13
of 13
hers 13
and 13
as 13
she 13
said 13
something 13
low 13
in 13
his 13
ear 13
he 13
turned 13
toward 13
her 13
with 13
a 13
rush 13
of 13
emotion 13
i 13
think 13
that 13
voice 13
held 13
him 13
most 13
with 13
its 13
fluctuating 13
feverish 13
warmth 13
because 13
it 13
couldnt 13
be 13
overdreamedthat 13
voice 13
was 13
a 13
deathless 13
song 13
they 13
had 13
forgotten 13
me 13
but 13
daisy 13
glanced 13
up 13
and 13
held 13
out 13
her 13
hand 13
gatsby 13
didnt 13
know 13
me 13
now 13
at 13
all 13
i 13
looked 13
once 13
more 13
at 13
them 13
and 13
they 13
looked 13
back 13
at 13
me 13
remotely 13
possessed 13
by 13
intense 13
life 13
then 13
i 13
went 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
room 13
and 13
down 13
the 13
marble 13
steps 13
into 13

rain 13

chapter 13
about 13
this 13
time 13
an 13
ambitious 13
young 13
reporter 13
from 13
new 13
york 13
arrived 13
one 13
morning 13
at 13
gatsbys 13
door 13
and 13
asked 13
him 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
anything 13
to 13
say 13
anything 13
to 13
say 13
about 13
what 13
inquired 13
gatsby 13
politely 13
whyany 13
statement 13
to 13
give 13
out 13
it 13
transpired 13
after 13
a 13
confused 13
five 13
minutes 13
that 13
the 13
man 13
had 13
heard 13
gatsbys 13
name 13
around 13
his 13
office 13
in 13
a 13
connection 13
which 13
he 13
either 13
wouldnt 13
reveal 13
or 13
didnt 13
fully 13
understand 13
this 13
was 13
his 13
day 13
off 13
and 13
with 13
laudable 13
initiative 13
he 13
had 13
hurried 13
out 13
to 13
see 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
random 13
shot 13
and 13
yet 13
the 13
reporters 13
instinct 13
was 13
right 13
gatsbys 13
notoriety 13
spread 13
about 13
by 13
the 13
hundreds 13
who 13
had 13
accepted 13
his 13
hospitality 13
and 13
so 13
become 13
authorities 13
on 13
his 13
past 13
had 13
increased 13
all 13
summer 13
until 13
he 13
fell 13
just 13
short 13
of 13
being 13
news 13
contemporary 13
legends 13
such 13
as 13
the 13
underground 13
pipeline 13
to 13
canada 13
attached 13
themselves 13
to 13
him 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
one 13
persistent 13
story 13
that 13
he 13
didnt 13
live 13
in 13
a 13
house 13
at 13
all 13
but 13
in 13
a 13
boat 13
that 13
looked 13
like 13
a 13
house 13
and 13
was 13
moved 13
secretly 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
the 13
long 13
island 13
shore 13
just 13
why 13
these 13
inventions 13
were 13
a 13
source 13
of 13
satisfaction 13
to 13
james 13
gatz 13
of 13
north 13
dakota 13
isnt 13
easy 13
to 13
say 13
james 13
gatzthat 13
was 13
really 13
or 13
at 13
least 13
legally 13
his 13
name 13
he 13
had 13
changed 13
it 13
at 13
the 13
age 13
of 13
seventeen 13
and 13
at 13
the 13
specific 13
moment 13
that 13
witnessed 13
the 13
beginning 13
of 13
his 13
careerwhen 13
he 13
saw 13
dan 13
codys 13
yacht 13
drop 13
anchor 13
over 13
the 13
most 13
insidious 13
flat 13
on 13
lake 13
superior 13
it 13
was 13
james 13
gatz 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
loafing 13
along 13
the 13
beach 13
that 13
afternoon 13
in 13
a 13
torn 13
green 13
jersey 13
and 13
a 13
pair 13
of 13
canvas 13
pants 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
already 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
who 13
borrowed 13
a 13
rowboat 13
pulled 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
tuolomee 13
and 13
informed 13
cody 13
that 13
a 13
wind 13
might 13
catch 13
him 13
and 13
break 13
him 13
up 13
in 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
i 13
suppose 13
hed 13
had 13
the 13
name 13
ready 13
for 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
even 13
then 13
his 13
parents 13
were 13
shiftless 13
and 13
unsuccessful 13
farm 13
peoplehis 13
imagination 13
had 13
never 13
really 13
accepted 13
them 13
as 13
his 13
parents 13
at 13
all 13
the 13
truth 13
was 13
that 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
of 13
west 13
egg 13
long 13
island 13
sprang 13
from 13
his 13
platonic 13
conception 13
of 13
himself 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
son 13
of 13
goda 13
phrase 13
which 13
if 13
it 13
means 13
anything 13
means 13
just 13
thatand 13
he 13
must 13
be 13
about 13
his 13
fathers 13
business 13
the 13
service 13
of 13
a 13
vast 13
vulgar 13
and 13
meretricious 13
beauty 13
so 13
he 13
invented 13
just 13
the 13
sort 13
of 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
that 13
a 13
seventeenyearold 13
boy 13
would 13
be 13
likely 13
to 13
invent 13
and 13
to 13
this 13
conception 13
he 13
was 13
faithful 13
to 13
the 13
end 13
for 13
over 13
a 13
year 13
he 13
had 13
been 13
beating 13
his 13
way 13
along 13
the 13
south 13
shore 13
of 13
lake 13
superior 13
as 13
a 13
clamdigger 13
and 13
a 13
salmonfisher 13
or 13
in 13
any 13
other 13
capacity 13
that 13
brought 13
him 13
food 13
and 13
bed 13
his 13
brown 13
hardening 13
body 13
lived 13
naturally 13
through 13
the 13
halffierce 13
halflazy 13
work 13
of 13
the 13
bracing 13
days 13
he 13
knew 13
women 13
early 13
and 13
since 13
they 13
spoiled 13
him 13
he 13
became 13
contemptuous 13
of 13
them 13
of 13
young 13
virgins 13
because 13
they 13
were 13
ignorant 13
of 13
the 13
others 13
because 13
they 13
were 13
hysterical 13
about 13
things 13
which 13
in 13
his 13
overwhelming 13
selfabsorbtion 13
he 13
took 13
for 13
granted 13
but 13
his 13
heart 13
was 13
in 13
a 13
constant 13
turbulent 13
riot 13
the 13
most 13
grotesque 13
and 13
fantastic 13
conceits 13
haunted 13
him 13
in 13
his 13
bed 13
at 13
night 13
a 13
universe 13
of 13
ineffable 13
gaudiness 13
spun 13
itself 13
out 13
in 13
his 13
brain 13
while 13
the 13
clock 13
ticked 13
on 13
the 13
washstand 13
and 13
the 13
moon 13
soaked 13
with 13
wet 13
light 13
his 13
tangled 13
clothes 13
upon 13
the 13
floor 13
each 13
night 13
he 13
added 13
to 13
the 13
pattern 13
of 13
his 13
fancies 13
until 13
drowsiness 13
closed 13
down 13
upon 13
some 13
vivid 13
scene 13
with 13
an 13
oblivious 13
embrace 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
these 13
reveries 13
provided 13
an 13
outlet 13
for 13
his 13
imagination 13
they 13
were 13
a 13
satisfactory 13
hint 13
of 13
the 13
unreality 13
of 13
reality 13
a 13
promise 13
that 13
the 13
rock 13
of 13
the 13
world 13
was 13
founded 13
securely 13
on 13
a 13
fairys 13
wing 13
an 13
instinct 13
toward 13
his 13
future 13
glory 13
had 13
led 13
him 13
some 13
months 13
before 13
to 13
the 13
small 13
lutheran 13
college 13
of 13
st 13
olaf 13
in 13
southern 13
minnesota 13
he 13
stayed 13
there 13
two 13
weeks 13
dismayed 13
at 13
its 13
ferocious 13
indifference 13
to 13
the 13
drums 13
of 13
his 13
destiny 13
to 13
destiny 13
itself 13
and 13
despising 13
the 13
janitors 13
work 13
with 13
which 13
he 13
was 13
to 13
pay 13
his 13
way 13
through 13
then 13
he 13
drifted 13
back 13
to 13
lake 13
superior 13
and 13
he 13
was 13
still 13
searching 13
for 13
something 13
to 13
do 13
on 13
the 13
day 13
that 13
dan 13
codys 13
yacht 13
dropped 13
anchor 13
in 13
the 13
shallows 13
alongshore 13
cody 13
was 13
fifty 13
years 13
old 13
then 13
a 13
product 13
of 13
the 13
nevada 13
silver 13
fields 13
of 13
the 13
yukon 13
of 13
every 13
rush 13
for 13
metal 13
since 13
seventyfive 13
the 13
transactions 13
in 13
montana 13
copper 13
that 13
made 13
him 13
many 13
times 13
a 13
millionaire 13
found 13
him 13
physically 13
robust 13
but 13
on 13
the 13
verge 13
of 13
softmindedness 13
and 13
suspecting 13
this 13
an 13
infinite 13
number 13
of 13
women 13
tried 13
to 13
separate 13
him 13
from 13
his 13
money 13
the 13
none 13
too 13
savory 13
ramifications 13
by 13
which 13

played 13
madame 13
de 13
maintenon 13
to 13
his 13
weakness 13
and 13
sent 13
him 13
to 13
sea 13
in 13
a 13
yacht 13
were 13
common 13
knowledge 13
to 13
the 13
turgid 13
subjournalism 13
of 13
he 13
had 13
been 13
coasting 13
along 13
all 13
too 13
hospitable 13
shores 13
for 13
five 13
years 13
when 13
he 13
turned 13
up 13
as 13
james 13
gatzs 13
destiny 13
at 13
little 13
girls 13
point 13
to 13
the 13
young 13
gatz 13
resting 13
on 13
his 13
oars 13
and 13
looking 13
up 13
at 13
the 13
railed 13
deck 13
the 13
yacht 13
represented 13
all 13
the 13
beauty 13
and 13
glamour 13
in 13
the 13
world 13
i 13
suppose 13
he 13
smiled 13
at 13
codyhe 13
had 13
probably 13
discovered 13
that 13
people 13
liked 13
him 13
when 13
he 13
smiled 13
at 13
any 13
rate 13
cody 13
asked 13
him 13
a 13
few 13
questions 13
one 13
of 13
them 13
elicited 13
the 13
brand 13
new 13
name 13
and 13
found 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
quick 13
and 13
extravagantly 13
ambitious 13
a 13
few 13
days 13
later 13
he 13
took 13
him 13
to 13
duluth 13
and 13
bought 13
him 13
a 13
blue 13
coat 13
six 13
pair 13
of 13
white 13
duck 13
trousers 13
and 13
a 13
yachting 13
cap 13
and 13
when 13
the 13
tuolomee 13
left 13
for 13
the 13
west 13
indies 13
and 13
the 13
barbary 13
coast 13
gatsby 13
left 13
too 13
he 13
was 13
employed 13
in 13
a 13
vague 13
personal 13
capacitywhile 13
he 13
remained 13
with 13
cody 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
turn 13
steward 13
mate 13
skipper 13
secretary 13
and 13
even 13
jailor 13
for 13
dan 13
cody 13
sober 13
knew 13
what 13
lavish 13
doings 13
dan 13
cody 13
drunk 13
might 13
soon 13
be 13
about 13
and 13
he 13
provided 13
for 13
such 13
contingencies 13
by 13
reposing 13
more 13
and 13
more 13
trust 13
in 13
gatsby 13
the 13
arrangement 13
lasted 13
five 13
years 13
during 13
which 13
the 13
boat 13
went 13
three 13
times 13
around 13
the 13
continent 13
it 13
might 13
have 13
lasted 13
indefinitely 13
except 13
for 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
ella 13
kaye 13
came 13
on 13
board 13
one 13
night 13
in 13
boston 13
and 13
a 13
week 13
later 13
dan 13
cody 13
inhospitably 13
died 13
i 13
remember 13
the 13
portrait 13
of 13
him 13
up 13
in 13
gatsbys 13
bedroom 13
a 13
gray 13
florid 13
man 13
with 13
a 13
hard 13
empty 13
facethe 13
pioneer 13
debauchee 13
who 13
during 13
one 13
phase 13
of 13
american 13
life 13
brought 13
back 13
to 13
the 13
eastern 13
seaboard 13
the 13
savage 13
violence 13
of 13
the 13
frontier 13
brothel 13
and 13
saloon 13
it 13
was 13
indirectly 13
due 13
to 13
cody 13
that 13
gatsby 13
drank 13
so 13
little 13
sometimes 13
in 13
the 13
course 13
of 13
gay 13
parties 13
women 13
used 13
to 13
rub 13
champagne 13
into 13
his 13
hair 13
for 13
himself 13
he 13
formed 13
the 13
habit 13
of 13
letting 13
liquor 13
alone 13
and 13
it 13
was 13
from 13
cody 13
that 13
he 13
inherited 13
moneya 13
legacy 13
of 13
twentyfive 13
thousand 13
dollars 13
he 13
didnt 13
get 13
it 13
he 13
never 13
understood 13
the 13
legal 13
device 13
that 13
was 13
used 13
against 13
him 13
but 13
what 13
remained 13
of 13
the 13
millions 13
went 13
intact 13
to 13
ella 13
kaye 13
he 13
was 13
left 13
with 13
his 13
singularly 13
appropriate 13
education 13
the 13
vague 13
contour 13
of 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
had 13
filled 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
substantiality 13
of 13
a 13
man 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
all 13
this 13
very 13
much 13
later 13
but 13
ive 13
put 13
it 13
down 13
here 13
with 13
the 13
idea 13
of 13
exploding 13
those 13
first 13
wild 13
rumors 13
about 13
his 13
antecedents 13
which 13
werent 13
even 13
faintly 13
true 13
moreover 13
he 13
told 13
it 13
to 13
me 13
at 13
a 13
time 13
of 13
confusion 13
when 13
i 13
had 13
reached 13
the 13
point 13
of 13
believing 13
everything 13
and 13
nothing 13
about 13
him 13
so 13
i 13
take 13
advantage 13
of 13
this 13
short 13
halt 13
while 13
gatsby 13
so 13
to 13
speak 13
caught 13
his 13
breath 13
to 13
clear 13
this 13
set 13
of 13
misconceptions 13
away 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
halt 13
too 13
in 13
my 13
association 13
with 13
his 13
affairs 13
for 13
several 13
weeks 13
i 13
didnt 13
see 13
him 13
or 13
hear 13
his 13
voice 13
on 13
the 13
phonemostly 13
i 13
was 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
trotting 13
around 13
with 13
jordan 13
and 13
trying 13
to 13
ingratiate 13
myself 13
with 13
her 13
senile 13
auntbut 13
finally 13
i 13
went 13
over 13
to 13
his 13
house 13
one 13
sunday 13
afternoon 13
i 13
hadnt 13
been 13
there 13
two 13
minutes 13
when 13
somebody 13
brought 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
in 13
for 13
a 13
drink 13
i 13
was 13
startled 13
naturally 13
but 13
the 13
really 13
surprising 13
thing 13
was 13
that 13
it 13
hadnt 13
happened 13
before 13
they 13
were 13
a 13
party 13
of 13
three 13
on 13
horsebacktom 13
and 13
a 13
man 13
named 13
sloane 13
and 13
a 13
pretty 13
woman 13
in 13
a 13
brown 13
ridinghabit 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
there 13
previously 13
im 13
delighted 13
to 13
see 13
you 13
said 13
gatsby 13
standing 13
on 13
his 13
porch 13
im 13
delighted 13
that 13
you 13
dropped 13
in 13
as 13
though 13
they 13
cared 13
sit 13
right 13
down 13
have 13
a 13
cigarette 13
or 13
a 13
cigar 13
he 13
walked 13
around 13
the 13
room 13
quickly 13
ringing 13
bells 13
ill 13
have 13
something 13
to 13
drink 13
for 13
you 13
in 13
just 13
a 13
minute 13
he 13
was 13
profoundly 13
affected 13
by 13
the 13
fact 13
that 13
tom 13
was 13
there 13
but 13
he 13
would 13
be 13
uneasy 13
anyhow 13
until 13
he 13
had 13
given 13
them 13
something 13
realizing 13
in 13
a 13
vague 13
way 13
that 13
that 13
was 13
all 13
they 13
came 13
for 13
mr 13
sloane 13
wanted 13
nothing 13
a 13
lemonade 13
no 13
thanks 13
a 13
little 13
champagne 13
nothing 13
at 13
all 13
thanks 13
im 13
sorry 13
did 13
you 13
have 13
a 13
nice 13
ride 13
very 13
good 13
roads 13
around 13
here 13
i 13
suppose 13
the 13
automobiles 13
yeah 13
moved 13
by 13
an 13
irresistible 13
impulse 13
gatsby 13
turned 13
to 13
tom 13
who 13
had 13
accepted 13
the 13
introduction 13
as 13
a 13
stranger 13
i 13
believe 13
weve 13
met 13
somewhere 13
before 13
mr 13
buchanan 13
oh 13
yes 13
said 13
tom 13
gruffly 13
polite 13
but 13
obviously 13
not 13
remembering 13
so 13
we 13
did 13
i 13
remember 13
very 13
well 13
about 13
two 13
weeks 13
ago 13
thats 13
right 13
you 13
were 13
with 13
nick 13
here 13
i 13
know 13
your 13
wife 13
continued 13
gatsby 13
almost 13
aggressively 13
that 13
so 13
tom 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
you 13
live 13
near 13
here 13
nick 13
next 13
door 13
that 13
so 13
mr 13
sloane 13
didnt 13
enter 13
into 13
the 13
conversation 13
but 13
lounged 13
back 13
haughtily 13
in 13
his 13
chair 13
the 13
woman 13
said 13
nothing 13
eitheruntil 13
unexpectedly 13
after 13
two 13
highballs 13
she 13
became 13
cordial 13
well 13
all 13

over 13
to 13
your 13

starting 13

gatsby 13
urged 13
them 13
he 13
had 13
control 13
of 13
himself 13
now 13
and 13
he 13
wanted 13
to 13

of 13
tom 13

lots 13
of 13
room 13
gatsby 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
questioningly 13
he 13
wanted 13
to 13
go 13
and 13
he 13
didnt 13
see 13
that 13
mr 13
sloane 13
had 13
determined 13
he 13

able 13
to 13

said 13

she 13
urged 13
concentrating 13
on 13
gatsby 13
mr 13
sloane 13
murmured 13
something 13
close 13
to 13
her 13
ear 13
we 13
wont 13
be 13
late 13
if 13
we 13
start 13
now 13
she 13
insisted 13
aloud 13
i 13
havent 13
got 13
a 13
horse 13
said 13
gatsby 13
i 13
used 13
to 13
ride 13
in 13
the 13
army 13
but 13
ive 13
never 13
bought 13
a 13
horse 13
ill 13
have 13
to 13
follow 13
you 13
in 13
my 13
car 13
excuse 13
me 13
for 13
just 13
a 13
minute 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
us 13
walked 13
out 13
on 13
the 13
porch 13
where 13
sloane 13
and 13
the 13
lady 13
began 13
an 13
impassioned 13
conversation 13
aside 13
my 13
god 13
i 13
believe 13
the 13
mans 13
coming 13
said 13
tom 13
doesnt 13
he 13
know 13
she 13
doesnt 13
want 13
him 13
she 13
says 13
she 13
does 13
want 13
him 13
she 13
has 13
a 13
big 13
dinner 13
party 13
and 13
he 13
wont 13
know 13
a 13
soul 13
there 13
he 13
frowned 13
i 13
wonder 13
where 13
in 13
the 13
devil 13
he 13
met 13
daisy 13
by 13
god 13
i 13
may 13
be 13
oldfashioned 13
in 13
my 13
ideas 13
but 13
women 13
run 13
around 13
too 13
much 13
these 13
days 13
to 13
suit 13
me 13
they 13
meet 13
all 13
kinds 13
of 13
crazy 13
fish 13
suddenly 13
mr 13
sloane 13
and 13
the 13
lady 13
walked 13
down 13
the 13
steps 13
and 13
mounted 13
their 13
horses 13
come 13
on 13
said 13
mr 13
sloane 13
to 13
tom 13
were 13
late 13
weve 13
got 13
to 13
go 13
and 13
then 13
to 13
me 13
tell 13
him 13
we 13
couldnt 13
wait 13
will 13
you 13
tom 13
and 13
i 13
shook 13
hands 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
us 13
exchanged 13
a 13
cool 13
nod 13
and 13
they 13
trotted 13
quickly 13
down 13
the 13
drive 13
disappearing 13
under 13
the 13
august 13
foliage 13
just 13
as 13
gatsby 13
with 13
hat 13
and 13
light 13
overcoat 13
in 13
hand 13
came 13
out 13
the 13
front 13
door 13
tom 13
was 13
evidently 13
perturbed 13
at 13
daisys 13
running 13
around 13
alone 13
for 13
on 13
the 13
following 13
saturday 13
night 13
he 13
came 13
with 13
her 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
party 13
perhaps 13
his 13
presence 13
gave 13
the 13
evening 13
its 13
peculiar 13
quality 13
of 13
oppressivenessit 13
stands 13
out 13
in 13
my 13
memory 13
from 13
gatsbys 13
other 13
parties 13
that 13
summer 13
there 13
were 13
the 13
same 13
people 13
or 13
at 13
least 13
the 13
same 13
sort 13
of 13
people 13
the 13
same 13
profusion 13
of 13
champagne 13
the 13
same 13
manycolored 13
manykeyed 13
commotion 13
but 13
i 13
felt 13
an 13
unpleasantness 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
a 13
pervading 13
harshness 13
that 13
hadnt 13
been 13
there 13
before 13
or 13
perhaps 13
i 13
had 13
merely 13
grown 13
used 13
to 13
it 13
grown 13
to 13
accept 13
west 13
egg 13
as 13
a 13
world 13
complete 13
in 13
itself 13
with 13
its 13
own 13
standards 13
and 13
its 13
own 13
great 13
figures 13
second 13
to 13
nothing 13
because 13
it 13
had 13
no 13
consciousness 13
of 13
being 13
so 13
and 13
now 13
i 13
was 13
looking 13
at 13
it 13
again 13
through 13
daisys 13
eyes 13
it 13
is 13
invariably 13
saddening 13
to 13
look 13
through 13
new 13
eyes 13
at 13
things 13
upon 13
which 13
you 13
have 13
expended 13
your 13
own 13
powers 13
of 13
adjustment 13
they 13
arrived 13
at 13
twilight 13
and 13
as 13
we 13
strolled 13
out 13
among 13
the 13
sparkling 13
hundreds 13
daisys 13
voice 13
was 13
playing 13
murmurous 13
tricks 13
in 13
her 13
throat 13
these 13
things 13
excite 13
me 13
so 13
she 13
whispered 13
if 13
you 13
want 13
to 13
kiss 13
me 13
any 13
time 13
during 13
the 13
evening 13
nick 13
just 13
let 13
me 13
know 13
and 13
ill 13
be 13
glad 13
to 13
arrange 13
it 13
for 13
you 13
just 13
mention 13
my 13
name 13
or 13
present 13
a 13
green 13
card 13
im 13
giving 13

im 13
looking 13
around 13
im 13
having 13
a 13
marvelous 13
you 13
must 13
see 13
the 13
faces 13
of 13
many 13
people 13
youve 13
heard 13
about 13

very 13
much 13
he 13
said 13
in 13
fact 13
i 13
was 13
just 13
thinking 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
a 13
soul 13
here 13
perhaps 13
you 13
know 13
that 13
lady 13
gatsby 13
indicated 13
a 13
gorgeous 13
scarcely 13
human 13
orchid 13
of 13
a 13
woman 13
who 13
sat 13
in 13
state 13
under 13
a 13
white 13
plum 13
tree 13
tom 13
and 13
daisy 13
stared 13
with 13
that 13
peculiarly 13
unreal 13
feeling 13
that 13
accompanies 13
the 13
recognition 13
of 13
a 13
hitherto 13
ghostly 13
celebrity 13
of 13
the 13
movies 13
shes 13
lovely 13
said 13
daisy 13
the 13
man 13
bending 13
over 13
her 13
is 13
her 13
director 13
he 13
took 13
them 13
ceremoniously 13
from 13
group 13
to 13
group 13
mrs 13
buchanan 13
and 13
mr 13
buchanan 13
after 13
an 13
instants 13
hesitation 13
he 13
added 13
the 13
polo 13
player 13
oh 13
no 13
objected 13
tom 13
quickly 13
not 13
me 13
but 13
evidently 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
it 13
pleased 13
gatsby 13
for 13
tom 13
remained 13
the 13
polo 13
player 13
for 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
the 13
evening 13
ive 13
never 13
met 13
so 13
many 13
celebrities 13
daisy 13
exclaimed 13
i 13
liked 13
that 13
manwhat 13
was 13
his 13
namewith 13
the 13
sort 13
of 13
blue 13
nose 13
gatsby 13
identified 13
him 13
adding 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
small 13
producer 13
well 13
i 13
liked 13
him 13
anyhow 13
id 13
a 13
little 13
rather 13
not 13
be 13
the 13
polo 13
player 13
said 13
tom 13
pleasantly 13

at 13
all 13
these 13
famous 13
people 13
inin 13
oblivion 13
daisy 13
and 13
gatsby 13
danced 13
i 13
remember 13
being 13
surprised 13
by 13
his 13
graceful 13
conservative 13
foxtroti 13
had 13
never 13
seen 13
him 13
dance 13
before 13
then 13
they 13
sauntered 13
over 13
to 13
my 13
house 13
and 13
sat 13
on 13
the 13
steps 13
for 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
while 13
at 13
her 13
request 13
i 13
remained 13
watchfully 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13
in 13
case 13
theres 13
a 13
fire 13
or 13
a 13
flood 13
she 13
explained 13
or 13
any 13
act 13
of 13
god 13
tom 13
appeared 13
from 13
his 13
oblivion 13
as 13
we 13
were 13
sitting 13
down 13
to 13
supper 13
together 13
do 13
you 13
mind 13
if 13
i 13

with 13
some 13
people 13
over 13
here 13

a 13
fellows 13
getting 13
off 13

funny 13
stuff 13

genially 13

to 13
take 13
down 13
any 13
addresses 13
heres 13
my 13
little 13
gold 13
pencil 13
she 13
looked 13
around 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
and 13
told 13
me 13
the 13
girl 13
was 13
common 13
but 13
pretty 13
and 13
i 13
knew 13
that 13
except 13
for 13
the 13
halfhour 13
shed 13
been 13
alone 13
with 13
gatsby 13
she 13
wasnt 13
having 13
a 13
good 13
time 13
we 13
were 13
at 13
a 13
particularly 13
tipsy 13
table 13
that 13
was 13
my 13
faultgatsby 13
had 13
been 13
called 13
to 13
the 13
phone 13
and 13
id 13
enjoyed 13
these 13
same 13
people 13
only 13
two 13
weeks 13
before 13
but 13
what 13
had 13
amused 13
me 13
then 13
turned 13
septic 13
on 13
the 13
air 13
now 13
how 13
do 13
you 13
feel 13
miss 13
baedeker 13
the 13
girl 13
addressed 13
was 13
trying 13
unsuccessfully 13
to 13
slump 13
against 13
my 13
shoulder 13
at 13
this 13
inquiry 13
she 13
sat 13
up 13
and 13
opened 13
her 13
eyes 13
wha 13
a 13
massive 13
and 13
lethargic 13
woman 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
urging 13
daisy 13
to 13
play 13
golf 13
with 13
her 13
at 13
the 13
local 13
club 13
tomorrow 13
spoke 13
in 13
miss 13
baedekers 13
defence 13
oh 13
shes 13
all 13
right 13
now 13
when 13
shes 13
had 13
five 13
or 13
six 13
cocktails 13
she 13
always 13
starts 13
screaming 13
like 13
that 13
i 13
tell 13
her 13
she 13
ought 13
to 13
leave 13
it 13
alone 13
i 13
do 13
leave 13
it 13
alone 13
affirmed 13
the 13
accused 13
hollowly 13
we 13
heard 13
you 13
yelling 13
so 13
i 13
said 13
to 13
doc 13
civet 13
here 13
theres 13
somebody 13
that 13
needs 13
your 13
help 13
doc 13
shes 13
much 13
obliged 13
im 13
sure 13
said 13
another 13
friend 13
without 13
gratitude 13
but 13
you 13
got 13
her 13
dress 13
all 13
wet 13
when 13
you 13
stuck 13
her 13
head 13
in 13
the 13
pool 13
anything 13
i 13
hate 13
is 13
to 13
get 13
my 13
head 13
stuck 13
in 13
a 13
pool 13
mumbled 13
miss 13
baedeker 13
they 13
almost 13
drowned 13
me 13
once 13
over 13
in 13
new 13
jersey 13
then 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
leave 13
it 13
alone 13
countered 13
doctor 13
civet 13
speak 13
for 13
yourself 13
cried 13
miss 13
baedeker 13
violently 13
your 13
hand 13
shakes 13
i 13
wouldnt 13
let 13
you 13
operate 13
on 13
me 13
it 13
was 13
like 13
that 13
almost 13
the 13
last 13
thing 13
i 13
remember 13
was 13
standing 13
with 13
daisy 13
and 13
watching 13
the 13
movingpicture 13
director 13
and 13
his 13
star 13
they 13
were 13
still 13
under 13
the 13
white 13
plum 13
tree 13
and 13
their 13
faces 13
were 13
touching 13
except 13
for 13
a 13
pale 13
thin 13
ray 13
of 13
moonlight 13
between 13
it 13
occurred 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
been 13
very 13
slowly 13
bending 13
toward 13
her 13
all 13
evening 13
to 13
attain 13
this 13
proximity 13
and 13
even 13
while 13
i 13
watched 13
i 13
saw 13
him 13
stoop 13
one 13
ultimate 13
degree 13
and 13
kiss 13
at 13
her 13
cheek 13
i 13
like 13
her 13
said 13
daisy 13
i 13
think 13
shes 13
lovely 13
but 13
the 13
rest 13
offended 13
herand 13
inarguably 13
because 13
it 13
wasnt 13
a 13
gesture 13
but 13
an 13
emotion 13
she 13
was 13
appalled 13
by 13
west 13
egg 13
this 13
unprecedented 13
place 13
that 13
broadway 13
had 13
begotten 13
upon 13
a 13
long 13
island 13
fishing 13
villageappalled 13
by 13
its 13
raw 13
vigor 13
that 13
chafed 13
under 13
the 13
old 13
euphemisms 13
and 13
by 13
the 13
too 13
obtrusive 13
fate 13
that 13
herded 13
its 13
inhabitants 13
along 13
a 13
shortcut 13
from 13
nothing 13
to 13
nothing 13
she 13
saw 13
something 13
awful 13
in 13
the 13
very 13
simplicity 13
she 13
failed 13
to 13
understand 13
i 13
sat 13
on 13
the 13
front 13
steps 13
with 13
them 13
while 13
they 13
waited 13
for 13
their 13
car 13
it 13
was 13
dark 13
here 13
in 13
front 13
only 13
the 13
bright 13
door 13
sent 13
ten 13
square 13
feet 13
of 13
light 13
volleying 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
soft 13
black 13
morning 13
sometimes 13
a 13
shadow 13
moved 13
against 13
a 13
dressingroom 13
blind 13
above 13
gave 13
way 13
to 13
another 13
shadow 13
an 13
indefinite 13
procession 13
of 13
shadows 13
who 13
rouged 13
and 13
powdered 13
in 13
an 13
invisible 13
glass 13
who 13
is 13
this 13
gatsby 13
anyhow 13
demanded 13
tom 13
suddenly 13
some 13
big 13
bootlegger 13
whered 13
you 13
hear 13
that 13
i 13
inquired 13
i 13
didnt 13
hear 13
it 13
i 13
imagined 13
it 13
a 13
lot 13
of 13
these 13
newly 13
rich 13
people 13
are 13
just 13
big 13
bootleggers 13
you 13
know 13
not 13
gatsby 13
i 13
said 13
shortly 13
he 13
was 13
silent 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
the 13
pebbles 13
of 13
the 13
drive 13
crunched 13
under 13
his 13
feet 13
well 13
he 13
certainly 13
must 13
have 13
strained 13
himself 13
to 13
get 13
this 13
menagerie 13
together 13
a 13
breeze 13
stirred 13
the 13
gray 13
haze 13
of 13
daisys 13
fur 13
collar 13
at 13
least 13
theyre 13
more 13
interesting 13
than 13
the 13
people 13
we 13
know 13
she 13
said 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
you 13
didnt 13
look 13
so 13
interested 13
well 13
i 13
was 13
tom 13
laughed 13
and 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
did 13
you 13
notice 13
daisys 13
face 13
when 13
that 13
girl 13
asked 13
her 13
to 13
put 13
her 13
under 13
a 13
cold 13
shower 13
daisy 13
began 13
to 13
sing 13
with 13
the 13
music 13
in 13
a 13
husky 13
rhythmic 13
whisper 13
bringing 13
out 13
a 13
meaning 13
in 13
each 13
word 13
that 13
it 13
had 13
never 13
had 13
before 13
and 13
would 13
never 13
have 13
again 13
when 13
the 13
melody 13
rose 13
her 13
voice 13
broke 13
up 13
sweetly 13
following 13
it 13
in 13
a 13
way 13
contralto 13
voices 13
have 13
and 13
each 13
change 13
tipped 13
out 13
a 13
little 13
of 13
her 13
warm 13
human 13
magic 13
upon 13
the 13
air 13
lots 13
of 13
people 13
come 13
who 13
havent 13
been 13
invited 13
she 13
said 13
suddenly 13
that 13
girl 13
hadnt 13
been 13
invited 13
they 13
simply 13
force 13
their 13
way 13
in 13
and 13
hes 13
too 13
polite 13
to 13
object 13
id 13
like 13
to 13
know 13
who 13
he 13
is 13
and 13
what 13
he 13
does 13
insisted 13
tom 13
and 13
i 13
think 13
ill 13
make 13
a 13
point 13
of 13
finding 13
out 13
i 13
can 13
tell 13
you 13
right 13
now 13
she 13
answered 13
he 13
owned 13
some 13
drugstores 13
a 13
lot 13
of 13
drugstores 13
he 13
built 13
them 13
up 13
himself 13
the 13
dilatory 13
limousine 13
came 13
rolling 13
up 13
the 13
drive 13
good 13
night 13
nick 13
said 13
daisy 13
her 13
glance 13
left 13
me 13
and 13
sought 13
the 13
lighted 13
top 13
of 13
the 13
steps 13
where 13
three 13
oclock 13
in 13
the 13
morning 13
a 13
neat 13
sad 13
little 13
waltz 13
of 13
that 13
year 13
was 13
drifting 13
out 13
the 13
open 13
door 13
after 13
all 13
in 13
the 13
very 13
casualness 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
party 13
there 13
were 13
romantic 13
possibilities 13
totally 13
absent 13
from 13
her 13
world 13
what 13
was 13
it 13
up 13
there 13
in 13
the 13
song 13
that 13
seemed 13
to 13
be 13
calling 13
her 13
back 13
inside 13
what 13
would 13
happen 13
now 13
in 13
the 13
dim 13
incalculable 13
hours 13
perhaps 13
some 13
unbelievable 13
guest 13
would 13
arrive 13
a 13
person 13
infinitely 13
rare 13
and 13
to 13
be 13
marvelled 13
at 13
some 13
authentically 13
radiant 13
young 13
girl 13
who 13
with 13
one 13
fresh 13
glance 13
at 13
gatsby 13
one 13
moment 13
of 13
magical 13
encounter 13
would 13
blot 13
out 13
those 13
five 13
years 13
of 13
unwavering 13
devotion 13
i 13
stayed 13
late 13
that 13
night 13
gatsby 13
asked 13
me 13
to 13
wait 13
until 13
he 13
was 13
free 13
and 13
i 13
lingered 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13
until 13
the 13
inevitable 13
swimming 13
party 13
had 13
run 13
up 13
chilled 13
and 13
exalted 13
from 13
the 13
black 13
beach 13
until 13
the 13
lights 13
were 13
extinguished 13
in 13
the 13
guestrooms 13
overhead 13
when 13
he 13
came 13
down 13
the 13
steps 13
at 13
last 13
the 13
tanned 13
skin 13
was 13
drawn 13
unusually 13
tight 13
on 13
his 13
face 13
and 13
his 13
eyes 13
were 13
bright 13
and 13
tired 13
she 13
didnt 13
like 13
it 13
he 13
said 13
immediately 13
of 13
course 13
she 13
did 13
she 13
didnt 13
like 13
it 13
he 13
insisted 13
she 13
didnt 13
have 13
a 13
good 13
time 13
he 13
was 13
silent 13
and 13
i 13
guessed 13
at 13
his 13
unutterable 13
depression 13
i 13
feel 13
far 13
away 13
from 13
her 13
he 13
said 13
its 13
hard 13
to 13
make 13
her 13
understand 13
you 13
mean 13
about 13
the 13
dance 13
the 13
dance 13
he 13
dismissed 13
all 13
the 13
dances 13
he 13
had 13
given 13
with 13
a 13
snap 13
of 13
his 13
fingers 13
old 13
sport 13
the 13
dance 13
is 13
unimportant 13
he 13
wanted 13
nothing 13
less 13
of 13
daisy 13
than 13
that 13
she 13
should 13
go 13
to 13
tom 13
and 13
say 13
i 13
never 13
loved 13
you 13
after 13
she 13
had 13
obliterated 13
four 13
years 13
with 13
that 13
sentence 13
they 13
could 13
decide 13
upon 13
the 13
more 13
practical 13
measures 13
to 13
be 13
taken 13
one 13
of 13
them 13
was 13
that 13
after 13
she 13
was 13
free 13
they 13
were 13
to 13
go 13
back 13
to 13
louisville 13
and 13
be 13
married 13
from 13
her 13
housejust 13
as 13
if 13
it 13
were 13
five 13
years 13
ago 13
and 13
she 13
doesnt 13
understand 13
he 13
said 13
she 13
used 13
to 13
be 13
able 13
to 13
understand 13
wed 13
sit 13
for 13
hours 13
he 13
broke 13
off 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
walk 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
a 13
desolate 13
path 13
of 13
fruit 13
rinds 13
and 13
discarded 13
favors 13
and 13
crushed 13
flowers 13
i 13
wouldnt 13
ask 13
too 13
much 13
of 13
her 13
i 13
ventured 13
you 13
cant 13
repeat 13
the 13
past 13
cant 13
repeat 13
the 13
past 13
he 13
cried 13
incredulously 13
why 13
of 13
course 13
you 13
can 13
he 13
looked 13
around 13
him 13
wildly 13
as 13
if 13
the 13
past 13
were 13
lurking 13
here 13
in 13
the 13
shadow 13
of 13
his 13
house 13
just 13
out 13
of 13
reach 13
of 13
his 13
hand 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
fix 13
everything 13
just 13
the 13
way 13
it 13
was 13
before 13
he 13
said 13
nodding 13
determinedly 13
shell 13
see 13
he 13
talked 13
a 13
lot 13
about 13
the 13
past 13
and 13
i 13
gathered 13
that 13
he 13
wanted 13
to 13
recover 13
something 13
some 13
idea 13
of 13
himself 13
perhaps 13
that 13
had 13
gone 13
into 13
loving 13
daisy 13
his 13
life 13
had 13
been 13
confused 13
and 13
disordered 13
since 13
then 13
but 13
if 13
he 13
could 13
once 13
return 13
to 13
a 13
certain 13
starting 13
place 13
and 13
go 13
over 13
it 13
all 13
slowly 13
he 13
could 13
find 13
out 13
what 13
that 13
thing 13
was 13
one 13
autumn 13
night 13
five 13
years 13
before 13
they 13
had 13
been 13
walking 13
down 13
the 13
street 13
when 13
the 13
leaves 13
were 13
falling 13
and 13
they 13
came 13
to 13
a 13
place 13
where 13
there 13
were 13
no 13
trees 13
and 13
the 13
sidewalk 13
was 13
white 13
with 13
moonlight 13
they 13
stopped 13
here 13
and 13
turned 13
toward 13
each 13
other 13
now 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
cool 13
night 13
with 13
that 13
mysterious 13
excitement 13
in 13
it 13
which 13
comes 13
at 13
the 13
two 13
changes 13
of 13
the 13
year 13
the 13
quiet 13
lights 13
in 13
the 13
houses 13
were 13
humming 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
darkness 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
stir 13
and 13
bustle 13
among 13
the 13
stars 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
corner 13
of 13
his 13
eye 13
gatsby 13
saw 13
that 13
the 13
blocks 13
of 13
the 13
sidewalks 13
really 13
formed 13
a 13
ladder 13
and 13
mounted 13
to 13
a 13
secret 13
place 13
above 13
the 13
treeshe 13
could 13
climb 13
to 13
it 13
if 13
he 13
climbed 13
alone 13
and 13
once 13
there 13
he 13
could 13
suck 13
on 13
the 13
pap 13
of 13
life 13
gulp 13
down 13
the 13
incomparable 13
milk 13
of 13
wonder 13
his 13
heart 13
beat 13
faster 13
and 13
faster 13
as 13
daisys 13
white 13
face 13
came 13
up 13
to 13
his 13
own 13
he 13
knew 13
that 13
when 13
he 13
kissed 13
this 13
girl 13
and 13
forever 13
wed 13
his 13
unutterable 13
visions 13
to 13
her 13
perishable 13
breath 13
his 13
mind 13
would 13
never 13
romp 13
again 13
like 13
the 13
mind 13
of 13
god 13
so 13
he 13
waited 13
listening 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
longer 13
to 13
the 13
tuningfork 13
that 13
had 13
been 13
struck 13
upon 13
a 13
star 13
then 13
he 13
kissed 13
her 13
at 13
his 13
lips 13
touch 13
she 13
blossomed 13
for 13
him 13
like 13
a 13
flower 13
and 13
the 13
incarnation 13
was 13
complete 13
through 13
all 13
he 13
said 13
even 13
through 13
his 13
appalling 13
sentimentality 13
i 13
was 13
reminded 13
of 13
somethingan 13
elusive 13
rhythm 13
a 13
fragment 13
of 13
lost 13
words 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
heard 13
somewhere 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
ago 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
a 13
phrase 13
tried 13
to 13
take 13
shape 13
in 13
my 13
mouth 13
and 13
my 13
lips 13
parted 13
like 13
a 13
dumb 13
mans 13
as 13
though 13
there 13
was 13
more 13
struggling 13
upon 13
them 13
than 13
a 13
wisp 13
of 13
startled 13
air 13
but 13
they 13
made 13
no 13
sound 13
and 13
what 13
i 13
had 13
almost 13
remembered 13
was 13
uncommunicable 13
forever 13
chapter 13
it 13
was 13
when 13
curiosity 13
about 13
gatsby 13
was 13
at 13
its 13
highest 13
that 13
the 13
lights 13
in 13
his 13
house 13
failed 13
to 13
go 13
on 13
one 13
saturday 13
nightand 13
as 13
obscurely 13
as 13
it 13
had 13
begun 13
his 13
career 13
as 13
trimalchio 13
was 13
over 13
only 13
gradually 13
did 13
i 13
become 13
aware 13
that 13
the 13
automobiles 13
which 13
turned 13
expectantly 13
into 13
his 13
drive 13
stayed 13
for 13
just 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
then 13
drove 13
sulkily 13
away 13
wondering 13
if 13
he 13
were 13
sick 13
i 13
went 13
over 13
to 13
find 13
outan 13
unfamiliar 13
butler 13
with 13
a 13
villainous 13
face 13
squinted 13
at 13
me 13
suspiciously 13
from 13
the 13
door 13
is 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
sick 13
nope 13
after 13
a 13
pause 13
he 13
added 13
sir 13
in 13
a 13
dilatory 13
grudging 13
way 13
i 13
hadnt 13
seen 13
him 13
around 13
and 13
i 13
was 13
rather 13
worried 13
tell 13
him 13
mr 13
carraway 13
came 13
over 13
who 13
he 13
demanded 13
rudely 13
carraway 13
carraway 13
all 13
right 13
ill 13
tell 13
him 13
abruptly 13
he 13
slammed 13
the 13
door 13
my 13
finn 13
informed 13
me 13
that 13
gatsby 13
had 13
dismissed 13
every 13
servant 13
in 13
his 13
house 13
a 13
week 13
ago 13
and 13
replaced 13
them 13
with 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
others 13
who 13
never 13
went 13
into 13
west 13
egg 13
village 13
to 13
be 13
bribed 13
by 13
the 13
tradesmen 13
but 13
ordered 13
moderate 13
supplies 13
over 13
the 13
telephone 13
the 13
grocery 13
boy 13
reported 13
that 13
the 13
kitchen 13
looked 13
like 13
a 13
pigsty 13
and 13
the 13
general 13
opinion 13
in 13
the 13
village 13
was 13
that 13
the 13
new 13
people 13
werent 13
servants 13
at 13
all 13
next 13
day 13
gatsby 13
called 13
me 13
on 13
the 13
phone 13
going 13
away 13
i 13
inquired 13
no 13

over 13
quite 13
oftenin 13
the 13
afternoons 13
so 13
the 13
whole 13
caravansary 13
had 13
fallen 13
in 13
like 13
a 13
card 13
house 13
at 13
the 13
disapproval 13
in 13
her 13
eyes 13
theyre 13
some 13
people 13
wolfshiem 13
wanted 13
to 13
do 13
something 13
for 13
theyre 13
all 13
brothers 13
and 13
sisters 13
they 13
used 13
to 13
run 13
a 13
small 13
hotel 13

an 13
hour 13
later 13
daisy 13
herself 13
telephoned 13
and 13
seemed 13
relieved 13
to 13
find 13
that 13
i 13
was 13
coming 13
something 13
was 13
up 13
and 13
yet 13
i 13
couldnt 13
believe 13
that 13
they 13
would 13
choose 13
this 13
occasion 13
for 13
a 13
sceneespecially 13
for 13
the 13
rather 13
harrowing 13
scene 13
that 13
gatsby 13
had 13
outlined 13
in 13
the 13
garden 13
the 13
next 13
day 13
was 13
broiling 13
almost 13
the 13
last 13
certainly 13
the 13
warmest 13
of 13
the 13
summer 13
as 13
my 13
train 13
emerged 13
from 13
the 13
tunnel 13
into 13
sunlight 13
only 13
the 13
hot 13
whistles 13
of 13
the 13
national 13
biscuit 13
company 13
broke 13
the 13
simmering 13
hush 13
at 13
noon 13
the 13
straw 13
seats 13
of 13
the 13
car 13
hovered 13
on 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
combustion 13
the 13
woman 13
next 13
to 13
me 13
perspired 13
delicately 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
into 13
her 13
white 13
shirtwaist 13
and 13
then 13
as 13
her 13
newspaper 13
dampened 13
under 13
her 13
fingers 13
lapsed 13
despairingly 13
into 13
deep 13
heat 13
with 13
a 13
desolate 13
cry 13
her 13
pocketbook 13
slapped 13
to 13
the 13
floor 13
oh 13
my 13
she 13
gasped 13
i 13
picked 13
it 13
up 13
with 13
a 13
weary 13
bend 13
and 13
handed 13
it 13
back 13
to 13
her 13
holding 13
it 13
at 13
arms 13
length 13
and 13
by 13
the 13
extreme 13
tip 13
of 13
the 13
corners 13
to 13
indicate 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
no 13
designs 13
upon 13
itbut 13
every 13
one 13
near 13
by 13
including 13
the 13
woman 13
suspected 13
me 13
just 13
the 13
same 13
hot 13
said 13
the 13
conductor 13
to 13
familiar 13
faces 13
some 13
weather 13
hot 13
hot 13
hot 13
is 13
it 13
hot 13
enough 13
for 13
you 13
is 13
it 13
hot 13
is 13
it 13
my 13
commutation 13
ticket 13
came 13
back 13
to 13
me 13
with 13
a 13
dark 13
stain 13
from 13
his 13
hand 13
that 13
any 13
one 13
should 13
care 13
in 13
this 13
heat 13
whose 13
flushed 13
lips 13
he 13
kissed 13
whose 13
head 13
made 13
damp 13
the 13
pajama 13
pocket 13
over 13
his 13
heart 13
through 13
the 13
hall 13
of 13
the 13
buchanans 13
house 13
blew 13
a 13
faint 13
wind 13
carrying 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
the 13
telephone 13
bell 13
out 13
to 13
gatsby 13
and 13
me 13
as 13
we 13
waited 13
at 13
the 13
door 13
the 13
masters 13
body 13
roared 13
the 13
butler 13
into 13
the 13
mouthpiece 13
im 13
sorry 13
madame 13
but 13
we 13
cant 13
furnish 13
itits 13
far 13
too 13
hot 13
to 13
touch 13
this 13
noon 13
what 13
he 13
really 13
said 13
was 13
yes 13
yes 13
ill 13
see 13
he 13
set 13
down 13
the 13
receiver 13
and 13
came 13
toward 13
us 13
glistening 13
slightly 13
to 13
take 13
our 13
stiff 13
straw 13
hats 13
madame 13
expects 13
you 13
in 13
the 13
salon 13
he 13
cried 13
needlessly 13
indicating 13
the 13
direction 13
in 13
this 13
heat 13
every 13
extra 13
gesture 13
was 13
an 13
affront 13
to 13
the 13
common 13
store 13
of 13
life 13
the 13
room 13
shadowed 13
well 13
with 13
awnings 13
was 13
dark 13
and 13
cool 13
daisy 13
and 13
jordan 13
lay 13
upon 13
an 13
enormous 13
couch 13
like 13
silver 13
idols 13
weighing 13
down 13
their 13
own 13
white 13
dresses 13
against 13
the 13
singing 13
breeze 13
of 13
the 13
fans 13
we 13
cant 13
move 13
they 13
said 13
together 13
jordans 13
fingers 13
powdered 13
white 13
over 13
their 13
tan 13
rested 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
in 13
mine 13
and 13
mr 13
thomas 13
buchanan 13
the 13
athlete 13
i 13
inquired 13
simultaneously 13
i 13
heard 13
his 13
voice 13
gruff 13
muffled 13
husky 13
at 13
the 13
hall 13
telephone 13
gatsby 13
stood 13
in 13
the 13
centre 13
of 13
the 13
crimson 13
carpet 13
and 13
gazed 13
around 13
with 13
fascinated 13
eyes 13
daisy 13
watched 13
him 13
and 13
laughed 13
her 13
sweet 13
exciting 13
laugh 13
a 13
tiny 13
gust 13
of 13
powder 13
rose 13
from 13
her 13
bosom 13
into 13
the 13
air 13
the 13
rumor 13
is 13
whispered 13
jordan 13
that 13
thats 13
toms 13
girl 13
on 13
the 13
telephone 13
we 13
were 13
silent 13
the 13
voice 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
rose 13
high 13
with 13
annoyance 13
very 13
well 13

open 13
the 13
door 13

out 13
its 13
space 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
with 13
his 13
thick 13
body 13
and 13
hurried 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
he 13
put 13
out 13
his 13
broad 13
flat 13
hand 13

wellconcealed 13

the 13
room 13
again 13
she 13
got 13
up 13
and 13
went 13
over 13
to 13
gatsby 13
and 13
pulled 13
his 13
face 13
down 13

on 13

daisy 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
clog 13
on 13
the 13
brick 13
fireplace 13
then 13
she 13
remembered 13
the 13
heat 13
and 13
sat 13
down 13
guiltily 13
on 13
the 13
couch 13
just 13
as 13
a 13
freshly 13
laundered 13
nurse 13
leading 13
a 13
little 13
girl 13
came 13
into 13
the 13
room 13

child 13
relinquished 13
by 13
the 13
nurse 13
rushed 13
across 13
the 13
room 13
and 13
rooted 13
shyly 13
into 13
her 13
mothers 13
dress 13
the 13
blessed 13
precious 13
did 13

gatsby 13
and 13
i 13
in 13
turn 13
leaned 13
down 13
and 13
took 13
the 13
small 13
reluctant 13
hand 13
afterward 13
he 13
kept 13
looking 13
at 13
the 13
child 13
with 13
surprise 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
he 13
had 13
ever 13
really 13
believed 13
in 13
its 13
existence 13
before 13
i 13
got 13
dressed 13
before 13
luncheon 13
said 13
the 13
child 13
turning 13
eagerly 13
to 13
daisy 13
thats 13
because 13
your 13
mother 13
wanted 13
to 13
show 13
you 13
off 13
her 13
face 13
bent 13
into 13
the 13
single 13
wrinkle 13
of 13
the 13
small 13
white 13
neck 13

her 13
around 13
so 13
that 13
she 13
faced 13
gatsby 13
do 13
you 13

theyre 13
pretty 13
wheres 13
daddy 13

like 13

shes 13
got 13
my 13
hair 13
and 13
shape 13
of 13
the 13
face 13
daisy 13
sat 13
back 13
upon 13
the 13
couch 13
the 13
nurse 13
took 13
a 13
step 13
forward 13
and 13
held 13
out 13
her 13
hand 13
come 13
pammy 13
goodby 13
sweetheart 13
with 13
a 13
reluctant 13
backward 13
glance 13
the 13
welldisciplined 13
child 13
held 13
to 13
her 13
nurses 13
hand 13
and 13
was 13
pulled 13
out 13
the 13
door 13
just 13
as 13
tom 13
came 13
back 13
preceding 13
four 13
gin 13
rickeys 13
that 13
clicked 13
full 13
of 13
ice 13
gatsby 13
took 13
up 13
his 13
drink 13
they 13
certainly 13
look 13
cool 13
he 13
said 13
with 13
visible 13
tension 13
we 13
drank 13
in 13
long 13
greedy 13
swallows 13
i 13
read 13
somewhere 13
that 13
the 13
suns 13
getting 13
hotter 13
every 13
year 13
said 13
tom 13
genially 13
it 13
seems 13
that 13
pretty 13
soon 13
the 13
earths 13
going 13
to 13
fall 13
into 13
the 13
sunor 13
wait 13
a 13
minuteits 13
just 13
the 13
oppositethe 13
suns 13
getting 13
colder 13
every 13
year 13

outside 13
he 13
suggested 13
to 13
gatsby 13
id 13
like 13
you 13
to 13
have 13
a 13
look 13
at 13
the 13
place 13
i 13
went 13
with 13
them 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
veranda 13
on 13
the 13
green 13
sound 13
stagnant 13
in 13
the 13
heat 13
one 13
small 13
sail 13
crawled 13
slowly 13
toward 13
the 13
fresher 13
sea 13
gatsbys 13
eyes 13
followed 13
it 13
momentarily 13
he 13
raised 13
his 13
hand 13
and 13
pointed 13
across 13
the 13
bay 13
im 13
right 13
across 13
from 13
you 13
so 13
you 13
are 13
our 13
eyes 13
lifted 13
over 13
the 13
rosebeds 13
and 13
the 13
hot 13
lawn 13
and 13
the 13
weedy 13
refuse 13
of 13
the 13
dogdays 13
alongshore 13
slowly 13
the 13
white 13
wings 13
of 13
the 13
boat 13
moved 13
against 13
the 13
blue 13
cool 13
limit 13
of 13
the 13
sky 13
ahead 13
lay 13
the 13
scalloped 13
ocean 13
and 13
the 13
abounding 13
blessed 13
isles 13
theres 13
sport 13
for 13
you 13
said 13
tom 13
nodding 13
id 13
like 13
to 13
be 13
out 13
there 13
with 13
him 13
for 13
about 13
an 13
hour 13
we 13
had 13
luncheon 13
in 13
the 13
diningroom 13
darkened 13
too 13
against 13
the 13
heat 13
and 13
drank 13
down 13
nervous 13
gayety 13
with 13
the 13
cold 13
ale 13
whatll 13
we 13
do 13
with 13
ourselves 13

afternoon 13

and 13

day 13
after 13

and 13
the 13
next 13

jordan 13
said 13
life 13
starts 13
all 13
over 13
again 13
when 13
it 13
gets 13
crisp 13
in 13
the 13
fall 13
but 13
its 13
so 13
hot 13
insisted 13
daisy 13
on 13
the 13
verge 13
of 13
tears 13
and 13
everythings 13
so 13
confused 13
lets 13
all 13
go 13
to 13
town 13
her 13
voice 13
struggled 13
on 13
through 13
the 13
heat 13
beating 13
against 13
it 13
molding 13
its 13
senselessness 13
into 13
forms 13
ive 13
heard 13
of 13
making 13
a 13
garage 13
out 13
of 13
a 13
stable 13
tom 13
was 13
saying 13
to 13
gatsby 13
but 13
im 13
the 13
first 13
man 13
who 13
ever 13
made 13
a 13
stable 13
out 13
of 13
a 13
garage 13
who 13
wants 13
to 13
go 13
to 13
town 13
demanded 13
daisy 13
insistently 13
gatsbys 13
eyes 13
floated 13
toward 13
her 13
ah 13
she 13
cried 13
you 13
look 13
so 13
cool 13
their 13
eyes 13
met 13
and 13
they 13
stared 13
together 13
at 13
each 13
other 13
alone 13
in 13
space 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
she 13
glanced 13
down 13
at 13
the 13
table 13
you 13
always 13
look 13
so 13
cool 13
she 13
repeated 13
she 13
had 13
told 13
him 13
that 13
she 13
loved 13
him 13
and 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
saw 13
he 13
was 13
astounded 13
his 13
mouth 13
opened 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
gatsby 13
and 13
then 13
back 13
at 13
daisy 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
just 13
recognized 13
her 13
as 13
some 13
one 13
he 13
knew 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
ago 13
you 13
resemble 13
the 13
advertisement 13
of 13
the 13
man 13
she 13
went 13
on 13
innocently 13

got 13
up 13
his 13
eyes 13
still 13
flashing 13
between 13
gatsby 13
and 13
his 13
wife 13
no 13
one 13
moved 13

hand 13
trembling 13
with 13
his 13
effort 13
at 13
selfcontrol 13
bore 13
to 13
his 13
lips 13
the 13
last 13
of 13
his 13
glass 13
of 13
ale 13
daisys 13
voice 13

to 13

through 13

she 13
begged 13

its 13
too 13
hot 13
to 13
fuss 13
he 13
didnt 13

way 13

said 13
come 13
on 13
jordan 13
they 13
went 13
upstairs 13
to 13
get 13
ready 13
while 13
we 13
three 13
men 13
stood 13
there 13
shuffling 13
the 13
hot 13
pebbles 13
with 13
our 13
feet 13
a 13
silver 13
curve 13
of 13
the 13
moon 13
hovered 13
already 13
in 13
the 13
western 13
sky 13
gatsby 13
started 13
to 13
speak 13
changed 13
his 13
mind 13
but 13
not 13
before 13
tom 13
wheeled 13
and 13
faced 13
him 13
expectantly 13
have 13
you 13
got 13
your 13
stables 13
here 13
asked 13
gatsby 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
about 13
a 13
quarter 13
of 13
a 13
mile 13
down 13
the 13
road 13
oh 13
a 13
pause 13
i 13
dont 13
see 13
the 13
idea 13
of 13
going 13
to 13
town 13
broke 13
out 13
tom 13
savagely 13
women 13
get 13
these 13
notions 13
in 13
their 13
heads 13
shall 13
we 13
take 13
anything 13
to 13
drink 13
called 13
daisy 13
from 13
an 13
upper 13
window 13
ill 13
get 13
some 13
whiskey 13
answered 13
tom 13
he 13
went 13
inside 13
gatsby 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
rigidly 13
i 13
cant 13
say 13
anything 13
in 13
his 13
house 13
old 13
sport 13
shes 13
got 13
an 13
indiscreet 13
voice 13
i 13
remarked 13
its 13
full 13
of 13
i 13
hesitated 13
her 13
voice 13
is 13
full 13
of 13
money 13
he 13
said 13
suddenly 13
that 13
was 13
it 13
id 13
never 13
understood 13
before 13
it 13
was 13
full 13
of 13
moneythat 13
was 13
the 13
inexhaustible 13
charm 13
that 13
rose 13
and 13
fell 13
in 13
it 13
the 13
jingle 13
of 13
it 13
the 13
cymbals 13
song 13
of 13
it 13
high 13
in 13
a 13
white 13
palace 13
the 13
kings 13
daughter 13
the 13
golden 13
girl 13
tom 13
came 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
wrapping 13
a 13
quart 13
bottle 13
in 13
a 13
towel 13
followed 13
by 13
daisy 13
and 13
jordan 13
wearing 13
small 13
tight 13
hats 13
of 13
metallic 13
cloth 13
and 13
carrying 13
light 13
capes 13
over 13
their 13
arms 13
shall 13
we 13
all 13
go 13
in 13
my 13
car 13
suggested 13
gatsby 13
he 13
felt 13
the 13
hot 13
green 13
leather 13
of 13
the 13
seat 13
i 13
ought 13
to 13
have 13
left 13
it 13
in 13
the 13
shade 13
is 13
it 13
standard 13
shift 13
demanded 13
tom 13
yes 13
well 13
you 13
take 13
my 13
coupe 13
and 13
let 13
me 13
drive 13
your 13
car 13
to 13
town 13
the 13
suggestion 13
was 13
distasteful 13
to 13
gatsby 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
theres 13
much 13
gas 13
he 13
objected 13
plenty 13
of 13
gas 13
said 13
tom 13
boisterously 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
the 13
gauge 13
and 13
if 13
it 13
runs 13
out 13
i 13
can 13
stop 13
at 13
a 13
drugstore 13
you 13
can 13
buy 13
anything 13
at 13
a 13
drugstore 13
nowadays 13
a 13
pause 13
followed 13
this 13
apparently 13
pointless 13
remark 13
daisy 13
looked 13
at 13
tom 13
frowning 13
and 13
an 13
indefinable 13
expression 13
at 13
once 13
definitely 13
unfamiliar 13
and 13
vaguely 13
recognizable 13
as 13
if 13
i 13
had 13
only 13
heard 13
it 13
described 13
in 13
words 13
passed 13
over 13
gatsbys 13
face 13
come 13
on 13
daisy 13
said 13
tom 13
pressing 13
her 13
with 13
his 13
hand 13
toward 13
gatsbys 13
car 13
ill 13
take 13
you 13
in 13
this 13
circus 13
wagon 13
he 13
opened 13
the 13
door 13
but 13
she 13
moved 13
out 13
from 13
the 13
circle 13
of 13
his 13
arm 13
you 13
take 13
nick 13
and 13
jordan 13
well 13
follow 13
you 13
in 13
the 13
coupe 13
she 13
walked 13
close 13
to 13
gatsby 13
touching 13
his 13
coat 13
with 13
her 13
hand 13
jordan 13
and 13
tom 13
and 13
i 13
got 13
into 13
the 13
front 13
seat 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
car 13
tom 13
pushed 13
the 13
unfamiliar 13
gears 13
tentatively 13
and 13
we 13
shot 13
off 13
into 13
the 13
oppressive 13
heat 13
leaving 13
them 13
out 13
of 13
sight 13
behind 13
did 13
you 13
see 13
that 13
demanded 13
tom 13
see 13
what 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
keenly 13
realizing 13
that 13
jordan 13
and 13
i 13
must 13
have 13
known 13
all 13
along 13
you 13
think 13
im 13
pretty 13
dumb 13
dont 13
you 13
he 13
suggested 13
perhaps 13
i 13
am 13
but 13
i 13
have 13
aalmost 13
a 13
second 13
sight 13
sometimes 13
that 13
tells 13
me 13
what 13
to 13
do 13
maybe 13
you 13
dont 13
believe 13
that 13
but 13
science 13
he 13
paused 13
the 13
immediate 13
contingency 13
overtook 13
him 13
pulled 13
him 13
back 13
from 13
the 13
edge 13
of 13
the 13
theoretical 13
abyss 13
ive 13
made 13
a 13
small 13
investigation 13
of 13
this 13
fellow 13
he 13
continued 13
i 13
could 13
have 13
gone 13
deeper 13
if 13
id 13
known 13
do 13
you 13
mean 13
youve 13
been 13
to 13
a 13
medium 13
inquired 13
jordan 13
humorously 13
what 13
confused 13
he 13
stared 13
at 13
us 13
as 13
we 13
laughed 13
a 13
medium 13
about 13
gatsby 13
about 13
gatsby 13
no 13
i 13
havent 13
i 13
said 13
id 13
been 13
making 13
a 13
small 13
investigation 13
of 13
his 13
past 13
and 13
you 13
found 13
he 13
was 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
said 13
jordan 13
helpfully 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
he 13
was 13
incredulous 13
like 13
hell 13
he 13
is 13
he 13
wears 13
a 13
pink 13
suit 13
nevertheless 13
hes 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
oxford 13
new 13
mexico 13
snorted 13
tom 13
contemptuously 13
or 13
something 13
like 13
that 13
listen 13
tom 13
if 13
youre 13
such 13
a 13
snob 13
why 13
did 13
you 13
invite 13
him 13
to 13
lunch 13
demanded 13
jordan 13
crossly 13
daisy 13
invited 13
him 13
she 13
knew 13
him 13
before 13
we 13
were 13
marriedgod 13
knows 13
where 13
we 13
were 13
all 13
irritable 13
now 13
with 13
the 13
fading 13
ale 13
and 13
aware 13
of 13
it 13
we 13
drove 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
in 13
silence 13
then 13
as 13
doctor 13
t 13
j 13
eckleburgs 13
faded 13
eyes 13
came 13
into 13
sight 13
down 13
the 13
road 13
i 13
remembered 13
gatsbys 13
caution 13
about 13
gasoline 13
weve 13
got 13
enough 13
to 13
get 13
us 13
to 13
town 13
said 13
tom 13
but 13
theres 13
a 13
garage 13
right 13
here 13
objected 13
jordan 13
i 13
dont 13
want 13
to 13
get 13
stalled 13
in 13
this 13
baking 13
heat 13
tom 13
threw 13
on 13
both 13
brakes 13
impatiently 13
and 13
we 13
slid 13
to 13
an 13
abrupt 13
dusty 13
stop 13
under 13
wilsons 13
sign 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
the 13
proprietor 13
emerged 13
from 13
the 13
interior 13
of 13
his 13
establishment 13
and 13
gazed 13
holloweyed 13
at 13
the 13
car 13
lets 13
have 13
some 13
gas 13
cried 13
tom 13
roughly 13
what 13

stopped 13
forto 13

sounded 13
well 13
enough 13
on 13
the 13
phone 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
wilson 13
left 13
the 13
shade 13
and 13
support 13
of 13
the 13
doorway 13
and 13
breathing 13
hard 13
unscrewed 13
the 13
cap 13
of 13
the 13
tank 13
in 13
the 13
sunlight 13
his 13
face 13
was 13
green 13
i 13
didnt 13
mean 13
to 13

bad 13
and 13
i 13

your 13
old 13

nice 13
yellow 13
one 13
said 13
wilson 13
as 13
he 13
strained 13
at 13
the 13
handle 13
like 13
to 13
buy 13
it 13
big 13
chance 13
wilson 13
smiled 13
faintly 13
no 13
but 13
i 13
could 13
make 13
some 13
money 13
on 13

exclaimed 13
tom 13
startled 13
shes 13
been 13
talking 13
about 13
it 13
for 13
ten 13
years 13
he 13
rested 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
against 13
the 13
pump 13
shading 13
his 13
eyes 13
and 13
now 13
shes 13
going 13
whether 13
she 13
wants 13
to 13
or 13
not 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
get 13
her 13
away 13
the 13
coupe 13
flashed 13
by 13
us 13
with 13
a 13
flurry 13
of 13
dust 13
and 13
the 13
flash 13
of 13
a 13
waving 13
hand 13
what 13
do 13
i 13
owe 13
you 13
demanded 13
tom 13
harshly 13
i 13
just 13
got 13
wised 13
up 13
to 13
something 13
funny 13
the 13
last 13
two 13
days 13
remarked 13
wilson 13
thats 13
why 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
get 13
away 13
thats 13
why 13
i 13
been 13
bothering 13
you 13
about 13
the 13
car 13
what 13
do 13
i 13
owe 13
you 13
dollar 13
twenty 13
the 13
relentless 13
beating 13
heat 13
was 13
beginning 13
to 13
confuse 13
me 13
and 13
i 13
had 13
a 13
bad 13
moment 13
there 13
before 13
i 13
realized 13
that 13
so 13
far 13
his 13
suspicions 13
hadnt 13
alighted 13
on 13
tom 13
he 13
had 13
discovered 13
that 13
myrtle 13
had 13
some 13
sort 13
of 13
life 13
apart 13
from 13
him 13
in 13
another 13
world 13
and 13
the 13
shock 13
had 13
made 13
him 13
physically 13
sick 13
i 13
stared 13
at 13
him 13
and 13
then 13
at 13
tom 13
who 13
had 13
made 13
a 13
parallel 13
discovery 13
less 13
than 13
an 13
hour 13
beforeand 13
it 13
occurred 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
difference 13
between 13
men 13
in 13
intelligence 13
or 13
race 13
so 13
profound 13
as 13
the 13
difference 13
between 13
the 13
sick 13
and 13
the 13
well 13
wilson 13
was 13
so 13
sick 13
that 13
he 13
looked 13
guilty 13
unforgivably 13
guiltyas 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
just 13
got 13
some 13
poor 13
girl 13
with 13
child 13
ill 13
let 13
you 13
have 13
that 13
car 13
said 13
tom 13
ill 13
send 13
it 13
over 13
tomorrow 13
afternoon 13
that 13
locality 13
was 13
always 13
vaguely 13
disquieting 13
even 13
in 13
the 13
broad 13
glare 13
of 13
afternoon 13
and 13
now 13
i 13
turned 13
my 13
head 13
as 13
though 13
i 13
had 13
been 13
warned 13
of 13
something 13
behind 13
over 13
the 13
ashheaps 13
the 13
giant 13
eyes 13
of 13
doctor 13
t 13
j 13
eckleburg 13
kept 13
their 13
vigil 13
but 13
i 13
perceived 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
that 13
other 13
eyes 13
were 13
regarding 13
us 13
with 13
peculiar 13
intensity 13
from 13
less 13
than 13
twenty 13
feet 13
away 13
in 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
windows 13
over 13
the 13
garage 13
the 13
curtains 13
had 13
been 13
moved 13
aside 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
myrtle 13
wilson 13
was 13
peering 13
down 13
at 13
the 13
car 13
so 13
engrossed 13
was 13
she 13
that 13
she 13
had 13
no 13
consciousness 13
of 13
being 13
observed 13
and 13
one 13
emotion 13
after 13
another 13
crept 13
into 13
her 13
face 13
like 13
objects 13
into 13
a 13
slowly 13
developing 13
picture 13
her 13
expression 13
was 13
curiously 13
familiarit 13
was 13
an 13
expression 13
i 13
had 13
often 13
seen 13
on 13
womens 13
faces 13
but 13
on 13
myrtle 13
wilsons 13
face 13
it 13
seemed 13
purposeless 13
and 13
inexplicable 13
until 13
i 13
realized 13
that 13
her 13
eyes 13
wide 13
with 13
jealous 13
terror 13
were 13
fixed 13
not 13
on 13
tom 13
but 13
on 13
jordan 13
baker 13
whom 13
she 13
took 13
to 13
be 13
his 13
wife 13
there 13
is 13
no 13
confusion 13
like 13
the 13
confusion 13
of 13
a 13
simple 13
mind 13
and 13
as 13
we 13
drove 13
away 13
tom 13
was 13
feeling 13
the 13
hot 13
whips 13
of 13
panic 13
his 13
wife 13
and 13
his 13
mistress 13
until 13
an 13
hour 13
ago 13
secure 13
and 13
inviolate 13
were 13
slipping 13
precipitately 13
from 13
his 13
control 13
instinct 13
made 13
him 13
step 13
on 13
the 13
accelerator 13
with 13
the 13
double 13
purpose 13
of 13
overtaking 13
daisy 13
and 13
leaving 13
wilson 13
behind 13
and 13
we 13
sped 13
along 13
toward 13
astoria 13
at 13
fifty 13
miles 13
an 13
hour 13
until 13
among 13
the 13
spidery 13
girders 13
of 13
the 13
elevated 13
we 13
came 13
in 13
sight 13
of 13
the 13
easygoing 13
blue 13
coupe 13
those 13
big 13
movies 13
around 13
fiftieth 13
street 13
are 13
cool 13
suggested 13
jordan 13
i 13
love 13
new 13
york 13
on 13
summer 13
afternoons 13
when 13
every 13
ones 13
away 13
theres 13
something 13
very 13
sensuous 13
about 13
itoverripe 13
as 13
if 13
all 13
sorts 13
of 13
funny 13
fruits 13
were 13
going 13
to 13
fall 13
into 13
your 13
hands 13
the 13
word 13
sensuous 13
had 13
the 13
effect 13
of 13
further 13
disquieting 13
tom 13
but 13
before 13
he 13
could 13
invent 13
a 13
protest 13
the 13
coupe 13
came 13
to 13
a 13
stop 13
and 13
daisy 13
signaled 13
us 13
to 13
draw 13
up 13
alongside 13
where 13
are 13
we 13
going 13
she 13
cried 13
how 13
about 13
the 13
movies 13
its 13
so 13
hot 13
she 13
complained 13
you 13
go 13
well 13
ride 13
around 13
and 13
meet 13
you 13
after 13
with 13
an 13
effort 13
her 13
wit 13
rose 13
faintly 13
well 13
meet 13
you 13
on 13
some 13
corner 13
ill 13
be 13
the 13
man 13
smoking 13
two 13
cigarettes 13
we 13
cant 13
argue 13
about 13
it 13
here 13
tom 13
said 13
impatiently 13
as 13
a 13
truck 13
gave 13
out 13
a 13
cursing 13
whistle 13
behind 13
us 13
you 13
follow 13
me 13
to 13
the 13
south 13
side 13
of 13
central 13
park 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
the 13
plaza 13
several 13
times 13
he 13
turned 13
his 13
head 13
and 13
looked 13
back 13
for 13
their 13
car 13
and 13
if 13
the 13
traffic 13
delayed 13
them 13
he 13
slowed 13
up 13
until 13
they 13
came 13
into 13
sight 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
was 13
afraid 13
they 13
would 13
dart 13
down 13
a 13
side 13
street 13
and 13
out 13
of 13
his 13
life 13
forever 13
but 13
they 13
didnt 13
and 13
we 13
all 13
took 13
the 13
less 13
explicable 13
step 13
of 13
engaging 13
the 13
parlor 13
of 13
a 13
suite 13
in 13
the 13
plaza 13
hotel 13
the 13
prolonged 13
and 13
tumultuous 13
argument 13
that 13
ended 13
by 13
herding 13
us 13
into 13
that 13
room 13
eludes 13
me 13
though 13
i 13
have 13
a 13
sharp 13
physical 13
memory 13
that 13
in 13
the 13
course 13
of 13
it 13
my 13
underwear 13
kept 13
climbing 13
like 13
a 13
damp 13
snake 13
around 13
my 13
legs 13
and 13
intermittent 13
beads 13
of 13
sweat 13
raced 13
cool 13
across 13
my 13
back 13
the 13
notion 13
originated 13
with 13
daisys 13
suggestion 13
that 13
we 13
hire 13
five 13
bathrooms 13
and 13
take 13
cold 13
baths 13
and 13
then 13
assumed 13
more 13
tangible 13
form 13
as 13
a 13
place 13
to 13
have 13
a 13
mint 13
julep 13
each 13
of 13
us 13
said 13
over 13
and 13
over 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
crazy 13
ideawe 13
all 13
talked 13
at 13
once 13
to 13
a 13
baffled 13
clerk 13
and 13
thought 13
or 13
pretended 13
to 13
think 13
that 13
we 13
were 13
being 13
very 13
funny 13
the 13
room 13
was 13
large 13
and 13
stifling 13
and 13
though 13
it 13
was 13
already 13
four 13
oclock 13
opening 13
the 13
windows 13
admitted 13
only 13
a 13
gust 13
of 13
hot 13
shrubbery 13
from 13
the 13
park 13
daisy 13
went 13
to 13
the 13
mirror 13
and 13
stood 13
with 13
her 13
back 13
to 13
us 13
fixing 13
her 13
hair 13
its 13
a 13
swell 13
suite 13
whispered 13
jordan 13
respectfully 13
and 13
every 13
one 13
laughed 13
open 13
another 13
window 13
commanded 13
daisy 13
without 13
turning 13
around 13
there 13

the 13
thing 13
to 13
do 13
is 13
to 13
forget 13
about 13
the 13
heat 13
said 13
tom 13
impatiently 13
you 13
make 13
it 13
ten 13
times 13
worse 13
by 13
crabbing 13
about 13
it 13
he 13
unrolled 13
the 13
bottle 13
of 13
whiskey 13
from 13
the 13
towel 13
and 13
put 13
it 13
on 13
the 13
table 13
why 13

let 13
her 13
alone 13

was 13
a 13
moment 13
of 13
silence 13
the 13
telephone 13
book 13
slipped 13
from 13
its 13
nail 13
and 13
splashed 13
to 13
the 13
floor 13
whereupon 13
jordan 13
whispered 13

in 13
an 13
interested 13
way 13
and 13
tossed 13
the 13
book 13
on 13
a 13
chair 13

a 13
great 13
expression 13

tom 13
took 13
up 13
the 13
receiver 13
the 13
compressed 13
heat 13
exploded 13
into 13
sound 13
and 13
we 13
were 13
listening 13
to 13
the 13
portentous 13
chords 13

long 13
cheer 13
floated 13
in 13
at 13
the 13
window 13
followed 13
by 13
intermittent 13
cries 13
of 13
yeaeaea 13
and 13
finally 13
by 13
a 13
burst 13
of 13
jazz 13
as 13

dancing 13

at 13
yale 13

at 13
each 13
other 13
blankly 13
biloxi 13
first 13
place 13
we 13
didnt 13
have 13
any 13
president 13
gatsbys 13
foot 13
beat 13
a 13
short 13
restless 13
tattoo 13
and 13
tom 13
eyed 13
him 13
suddenly 13
by 13
the 13
way 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
i 13
understand 13
youre 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
not 13

you 13
went 13
to 13
oxford 13
yesi 13
went 13
there 13
a 13
pause 13
then 13
toms 13
voice 13
incredulous 13
and 13
insulting 13
you 13
must 13
have 13
gone 13
there 13
about 13
the 13
time 13
biloxi 13
went 13
to 13
new 13
haven 13
another 13
pause 13
a 13
waiter 13
knocked 13
and 13
came 13
in 13
with 13
crushed 13
mint 13
and 13
ice 13
but 13
the 13
silence 13
was 13
unbroken 13
by 13
his 13
thank 13
you 13
and 13
the 13
soft 13
closing 13
of 13
the 13
door 13
this 13
tremendous 13
detail 13
was 13
to 13
be 13
cleared 13
up 13
at 13
last 13
i 13
told 13
you 13
i 13
went 13
there 13
said 13
gatsby 13
i 13
heard 13
you 13
but 13
id 13
like 13
to 13
know 13
when 13
it 13
was 13
in 13
nineteennineteen 13
i 13
only 13
stayed 13
five 13
months 13
thats 13
why 13
i 13
cant 13
really 13
call 13
myself 13
an 13
oxford 13
man 13
tom 13
glanced 13
around 13
to 13
see 13
if 13
we 13
mirrored 13
his 13
unbelief 13
but 13
we 13
were 13
all 13
looking 13
at 13
gatsby 13
it 13
was 13
an 13
opportunity 13
they 13
gave 13
to 13
some 13
of 13
the 13
officers 13
after 13
the 13
armistice 13
he 13
continued 13
we 13
could 13
go 13
to 13
any 13
of 13
the 13
universities 13
in 13
england 13
or 13
france 13
i 13
wanted 13
to 13
get 13
up 13
and 13
slap 13
him 13
on 13
the 13
back 13
i 13
had 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
renewals 13
of 13
complete 13
faith 13
in 13
him 13
that 13
id 13
experienced 13
before 13
daisy 13
rose 13
smiling 13
faintly 13
and 13
went 13
to 13
the 13
table 13
open 13
the 13
whiskey 13
tom 13
she 13
ordered 13
and 13
ill 13
make 13
you 13
a 13
mint 13
julep 13
then 13
you 13
wont 13
seem 13
so 13
stupid 13
to 13
yourself 13
look 13
at 13
the 13
mint 13
wait 13
a 13
minute 13
snapped 13
tom 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
ask 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
one 13
more 13
question 13
go 13
on 13
gatsby 13
said 13
politely 13
what 13
kind 13
of 13
a 13
row 13
are 13
you 13
trying 13
to 13
cause 13
in 13
my 13
house 13
anyhow 13
they 13
were 13
out 13
in 13
the 13
open 13
at 13
last 13
and 13
gatsby 13
was 13
content 13
he 13
isnt 13
causing 13
a 13
row 13
daisy 13
looked 13
desperately 13
from 13
one 13
to 13
the 13
other 13
youre 13
causing 13
a 13
row 13
please 13
have 13
a 13
little 13
selfcontrol 13
selfcontrol 13
repeated 13
tom 13
incredulously 13
i 13
suppose 13
the 13
latest 13
thing 13
is 13
to 13
sit 13
back 13
and 13
let 13
mr 13
nobody 13
from 13
nowhere 13
make 13
love 13
to 13
your 13
wife 13
well 13
if 13
thats 13
the 13
idea 13
you 13
can 13
count 13
me 13
out 13
nowadays 13
people 13
begin 13
by 13
sneering 13
at 13
family 13
life 13
and 13
family 13
institutions 13
and 13
next 13
theyll 13
throw 13
everything 13
overboard 13
and 13
have 13
intermarriage 13
between 13
black 13
and 13
white 13
flushed 13
with 13
his 13
impassioned 13
gibberish 13
he 13
saw 13
himself 13
standing 13
alone 13
on 13
the 13
last 13
barrier 13
of 13
civilization 13
were 13
all 13
white 13
here 13
murmured 13
jordan 13
i 13

not 13
very 13
popular 13
i 13
dont 13
give 13

suppose 13

to 13
make 13
your 13
house 13
into 13
a 13
pigsty 13
in 13
order 13
to 13

any 13
friendsin 13
the 13
modern 13
world 13
angry 13
as 13
i 13
was 13
as 13
we 13
all 13
were 13
i 13
was 13
tempted 13
to 13
laugh 13
whenever 13
he 13
opened 13
his 13
mouth 13
the 13
transition 13
from 13
libertine 13
to 13
prig 13
was 13
so 13
complete 13
ive 13
got 13
something 13
to 13
tell 13
you 13
old 13
sport 13
began 13
gatsby 13
but 13
daisy 13
guessed 13
at 13
his 13
intention 13
please 13
dont 13
she 13
interrupted 13
helplessly 13
please 13
lets 13
all 13
go 13
home 13
why 13
dont 13
we 13
all 13
go 13
home 13
thats 13
a 13
good 13
idea 13
i 13
got 13
up 13
come 13
on 13
tom 13
nobody 13
wants 13
a 13
drink 13
i 13
want 13
to 13

what 13
mr 13
gatsby 13
has 13
to 13
tell 13
me 13
your 13
wife 13

love 13
you 13
said 13
gatsby 13
shes 13
never 13
loved 13
you 13
she 13
loves 13
me 13
you 13
must 13
be 13
crazy 13
exclaimed 13
tom 13
automatically 13
gatsby 13
sprang 13
to 13
his 13
feet 13
vivid 13
with 13
excitement 13
she 13
never 13
loved 13
you 13
do 13
you 13
hear 13
he 13
cried 13
she 13
only 13
married 13
you 13
because 13
i 13
was 13
poor 13
and 13
she 13
was 13
tired 13
of 13
waiting 13
for 13
me 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
terrible 13
mistake 13
but 13
in 13
her 13
heart 13
she 13
never 13
loved 13
any 13
one 13
except 13
me 13
at 13
this 13
point 13
jordan 13
and 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
go 13
but 13
tom 13
and 13
gatsby 13
insisted 13
with 13
competitive 13
firmness 13
that 13
we 13
remainas 13
though 13
neither 13
of 13
them 13
had 13
anything 13
to 13
conceal 13
and 13
it 13
would 13
be 13
a 13
privilege 13
to 13
partake 13
vicariously 13
of 13
their 13
emotions 13
sit 13
down 13
daisy 13
toms 13
voice 13
groped 13
unsuccessfully 13
for 13
the 13
paternal 13
note 13
whats 13
been 13
going 13
on 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
hear 13
all 13
about 13
it 13
i 13
told 13
you 13
whats 13
been 13
going 13
on 13
said 13
gatsby 13
going 13
on 13
for 13
five 13
yearsand 13
you 13
didnt 13
know 13
tom 13
turned 13
to 13
daisy 13
sharply 13
youve 13
been 13
seeing 13
this 13
fellow 13
for 13
five 13
years 13
not 13
seeing 13
said 13
gatsby 13
no 13
we 13
couldnt 13
meet 13
but 13
both 13
of 13
us 13
loved 13
each 13
other 13
all 13
that 13
time 13
old 13
sport 13
and 13
you 13
didnt 13
know 13
i 13
used 13
to 13
laugh 13
sometimesbut 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
laughter 13
in 13
his 13
eyes 13
to 13
think 13
that 13
you 13
didnt 13
know 13
ohthats 13
all 13
tom 13
tapped 13
his 13
thick 13
fingers 13
together 13
like 13
a 13
clergyman 13
and 13
leaned 13
back 13
in 13
his 13
chair 13
youre 13
crazy 13
he 13
exploded 13
i 13
cant 13
speak 13
about 13
what 13
happened 13
five 13
years 13
ago 13
because 13
i 13
didnt 13
know 13
daisy 13
thenand 13
ill 13
be 13
damned 13
if 13
i 13
see 13
how 13
you 13
got 13
within 13
a 13
mile 13
of 13
her 13
unless 13
you 13
brought 13
the 13
groceries 13
to 13
the 13
back 13
door 13
but 13
all 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
thats 13
a 13
god 13
damned 13
lie 13
daisy 13
loved 13
me 13
when 13
she 13
married 13
me 13
and 13
she 13
loves 13
me 13
now 13
no 13
said 13
gatsby 13
shaking 13
his 13
head 13
she 13
does 13
though 13
the 13
trouble 13
is 13
that 13
sometimes 13
she 13
gets 13
foolish 13
ideas 13
in 13
her 13
head 13
and 13
doesnt 13
know 13
what 13
shes 13
doing 13
he 13
nodded 13
sagely 13
and 13
whats 13
more 13
i 13
love 13
daisy 13
too 13
once 13
in 13
a 13
while 13
i 13
go 13
off 13
on 13
a 13
spree 13
and 13
make 13
a 13
fool 13
of 13
myself 13
but 13
i 13
always 13
come 13
back 13
and 13
in 13
my 13
heart 13
i 13
love 13
her 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
youre 13
revolting 13
said 13
daisy 13
she 13
turned 13
to 13
me 13
and 13
her 13
voice 13
dropping 13
an 13
octave 13
lower 13
filled 13
the 13
room 13
with 13
thrilling 13
scorn 13
do 13
you 13
know 13
why 13
we 13
left 13
chicago 13
im 13
surprised 13
that 13
they 13
didnt 13
treat 13
you 13
to 13
the 13
story 13
of 13
that 13
little 13
spree 13
gatsby 13
walked 13
over 13
and 13
stood 13
beside 13
her 13
daisy 13
thats 13
all 13
over 13
now 13
he 13
said 13
earnestly 13
it 13
doesnt 13
matter 13
any 13
more 13
just 13
tell 13
him 13
the 13
truththat 13
you 13
never 13
loved 13
himand 13
its 13
all 13
wiped 13
out 13
forever 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
him 13
blindly 13
whyhow 13
could 13
i 13
love 13
himpossibly 13
you 13
never 13
loved 13
him 13
she 13
hesitated 13
her 13
eyes 13
fell 13
on 13
jordan 13
and 13
me 13
with 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
appeal 13
as 13
though 13
she 13
realized 13
at 13
last 13
what 13
she 13
was 13
doingand 13
as 13
though 13
she 13
had 13
never 13
all 13
along 13
intended 13
doing 13
anything 13
at 13
all 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
done 13
now 13
it 13
was 13
too 13
late 13
i 13
never 13
loved 13
him 13
she 13
said 13
with 13
perceptible 13
reluctance 13
not 13
at 13
kapiolani 13
demanded 13
tom 13
suddenly 13
no 13
from 13
the 13
ballroom 13
beneath 13
muffled 13
and 13
suffocating 13
chords 13
were 13
drifting 13
up 13
on 13
hot 13
waves 13
of 13
air 13
not 13
that 13
day 13
i 13
carried 13
you 13
down 13
from 13
the 13
punch 13
bowl 13
to 13
keep 13
your 13
shoes 13
dry 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
husky 13
tenderness 13
in 13
his 13
tone 13
daisy 13
please 13
dont 13
her 13
voice 13
was 13
cold 13
but 13
the 13
rancor 13
was 13
gone 13
from 13
it 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
gatsby 13
there 13
jay 13
she 13
saidbut 13
her 13
hand 13
as 13
she 13
tried 13
to 13
light 13
a 13
cigarette 13
was 13
trembling 13
suddenly 13
she 13
threw 13
the 13
cigarette 13
and 13
the 13
burning 13
match 13
on 13
the 13
carpet 13
oh 13
you 13
want 13
too 13
much 13
she 13
cried 13
to 13
gatsby 13

that 13
enough 13

began 13
to 13
sob 13
helplessly 13
i 13

love 13
him 13
oncebut 13
i 13
loved 13

eyes 13
opened 13
and 13
closed 13

too 13
he 13
repeated 13
even 13
thats 13
a 13
lie 13
said 13
tom 13
savagely 13
she 13
didnt 13
know 13
you 13
were 13
alive 13
whytherere 13
things 13
between 13
daisy 13
and 13
me 13
that 13
youll 13
never 13
know 13
things 13
that 13
neither 13
of 13
us 13
can 13
ever 13
forget 13
the 13
words 13
seemed 13
to 13
bite 13
physically 13
into 13
gatsby 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
daisy 13
alone 13
he 13
insisted 13
shes 13
all 13
excited 13
now 13
even 13
alone 13
i 13
cant 13
say 13
i 13
never 13
loved 13
tom 13
she 13
admitted 13
in 13
a 13
pitiful 13
voice 13
it 13
wouldnt 13
be 13
true 13
of 13
course 13
it 13
wouldnt 13
agreed 13
tom 13
she 13
turned 13
to 13
her 13
husband 13
as 13
if 13
it 13
mattered 13
to 13
you 13
she 13
said 13
of 13
course 13
it 13
matters 13
im 13
going 13
to 13
take 13
better 13
care 13
of 13
you 13
from 13
now 13
on 13
you 13
dont 13
understand 13
said 13
gatsby 13
with 13
a 13
touch 13
of 13
panic 13
youre 13
not 13
going 13
to 13
take 13
care 13
of 13
her 13
any 13
more 13
im 13
not 13
tom 13
opened 13
his 13
eyes 13
wide 13
and 13
laughed 13
he 13
could 13
afford 13
to 13
control 13
himself 13
now 13
whys 13
that 13
daisys 13
leaving 13
you 13
nonsense 13

she 13
said 13
with 13
a 13
visible 13
effort 13
shes 13
not 13
leaving 13
me 13
toms 13
words 13
suddenly 13
leaned 13
down 13
over 13
gatsby 13
certainly 13
not 13
for 13
a 13
common 13
swindler 13
whod 13
have 13
to 13
steal 13
the 13
ring 13
he 13
put 13
on 13
her 13
finger 13
i 13
wont 13
stand 13
this 13
cried 13
daisy 13
oh 13

get 13
out 13
who 13
are 13
you 13

one 13
of 13
that 13
bunch 13
that 13
hangs 13
around 13
with 13
meyer 13
wolfshiemthat 13
much 13
i 13

to 13

a 13
little 13
investigation 13
into 13
your 13
affairsand 13
ill 13
carry 13
it 13
further 13
tomorrow 13

can 13
suit 13
yourself 13
about 13
that 13
old 13
sport 13
said 13
gatsby 13
steadily 13
i 13
found 13
out 13
what 13
your 13
drugstores 13
were 13
he 13
turned 13
to 13
us 13
and 13
spoke 13
rapidly 13
he 13
and 13
this 13
wolfshiem 13
bought 13
up 13
a 13
lot 13
of 13
sidestreet 13
drugstores 13
here 13
and 13
in 13
chicago 13
and 13
sold 13
grain 13
alcohol 13
over 13
the 13
counter 13
thats 13
one 13
of 13
his 13
little 13
stunts 13
i 13
picked 13
him 13
for 13
a 13
bootlegger 13
the 13
first 13
time 13
i 13
saw 13
him 13
and 13
i 13
wasnt 13
far 13
wrong 13
what 13
about 13
it 13
said 13
gatsby 13
politely 13
i 13
guess 13
your 13
friend 13
walter 13
chase 13
wasnt 13
too 13
proud 13
to 13
come 13
in 13
on 13
it 13
and 13
you 13
left 13
him 13
in 13
the 13
lurch 13
didnt 13
you 13
you 13
let 13
him 13
go 13
to 13
jail 13
for 13
a 13
month 13
over 13
in 13
new 13
jersey 13
god 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
hear 13
walter 13
on 13
the 13
subject 13
of 13
you 13
he 13
came 13
to 13
us 13
dead 13
broke 13
he 13
was 13
very 13
glad 13
to 13
pick 13
up 13
some 13
money 13
old 13
sport 13
dont 13
you 13
call 13
me 13
old 13
sport 13
cried 13
tom 13
gatsby 13
said 13
nothing 13
walter 13
could 13
have 13
you 13
up 13
on 13
the 13
betting 13
laws 13
too 13
but 13
wolfshiem 13
scared 13
him 13
into 13
shutting 13
his 13
mouth 13
that 13
unfamiliar 13
yet 13
recognizable 13
look 13
was 13
back 13
again 13
in 13
gatsbys 13
face 13
that 13
drugstore 13
business 13
was 13
just 13
small 13
change 13
continued 13
tom 13
slowly 13
but 13
youve 13
got 13
something 13
on 13
now 13
that 13
walters 13
afraid 13
to 13
tell 13
me 13
about 13
i 13
glanced 13
at 13
daisy 13
who 13
was 13
staring 13
terrified 13
between 13
gatsby 13
and 13
her 13
husband 13
and 13
at 13
jordan 13
who 13
had 13
begun 13
to 13
balance 13
an 13
invisible 13
but 13
absorbing 13
object 13
on 13
the 13
tip 13
of 13
her 13
chin 13
then 13
i 13
turned 13
back 13
to 13
gatsbyand 13
was 13
startled 13
at 13
his 13
expression 13
he 13
lookedand 13
this 13
is 13
said 13
in 13
all 13
contempt 13
for 13
the 13
babbled 13
slander 13
of 13
his 13
gardenas 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
killed 13
a 13
man 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
the 13
set 13
of 13
his 13
face 13
could 13
be 13
described 13
in 13
just 13
that 13
fantastic 13
way 13
it 13
passed 13
and 13
he 13
began 13
to 13
talk 13
excitedly 13
to 13
daisy 13
denying 13
everything 13
defending 13
his 13
name 13
against 13
accusations 13
that 13
had 13
not 13
been 13
made 13
but 13
with 13
every 13
word 13
she 13
was 13
drawing 13
further 13
and 13
further 13
into 13
herself 13
so 13
he 13
gave 13
that 13
up 13
and 13
only 13
the 13
dead 13
dream 13
fought 13
on 13
as 13
the 13
afternoon 13
slipped 13
away 13
trying 13
to 13
touch 13
what 13
was 13
no 13
longer 13
tangible 13
struggling 13
unhappily 13
undespairingly 13
toward 13
that 13
lost 13
voice 13
across 13
the 13
room 13
the 13
voice 13
begged 13
again 13
to 13
go 13
please 13
tom 13
i 13
cant 13
stand 13
this 13
any 13
more 13
her 13
frightened 13
eyes 13
told 13
that 13
whatever 13
intentions 13
whatever 13
courage 13
she 13
had 13
had 13
were 13
definitely 13
gone 13
you 13
two 13
start 13
on 13
home 13
daisy 13
said 13
tom 13
in 13
mr 13
gatsbys 13
car 13
she 13
looked 13
at 13
tom 13
alarmed 13
now 13
but 13
he 13
insisted 13
with 13
magnanimous 13
scorn 13
go 13
on 13
he 13
wont 13
annoy 13
you 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
realizes 13
that 13
his 13
presumptuous 13
little 13
flirtation 13
is 13
over 13
they 13
were 13
gone 13
without 13
a 13
word 13
snapped 13
out 13
made 13
accidental 13
isolated 13
like 13
ghosts 13
even 13
from 13
our 13
pity 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
tom 13
got 13
up 13
and 13
began 13
wrapping 13
the 13
unopened 13
bottle 13
of 13
whiskey 13
in 13
the 13
towel 13
want 13
any 13
of 13
this 13
stuff 13
jordan 13
nick 13
i 13
didnt 13
answer 13
nick 13
he 13
asked 13
again 13
what 13
want 13
any 13
no 13
i 13
just 13
remembered 13
that 13
todays 13
my 13
birthday 13
i 13
was 13
thirty 13
before 13
me 13
stretched 13
the 13
portentous 13
menacing 13
road 13
of 13
a 13
new 13
decade 13
it 13
was 13
seven 13
oclock 13
when 13
we 13
got 13
into 13
the 13
coupe 13
with 13
him 13
and 13
started 13
for 13
long 13
island 13
tom 13
talked 13
incessantly 13
exulting 13
and 13
laughing 13
but 13
his 13
voice 13
was 13
as 13
remote 13
from 13
jordan 13
and 13
me 13
as 13
the 13
foreign 13
clamor 13
on 13
the 13
sidewalk 13
or 13
the 13
tumult 13
of 13
the 13
elevated 13
overhead 13
human 13
sympathy 13
has 13
its 13
limits 13
and 13
we 13
were 13
content 13
to 13
let 13
all 13
their 13
tragic 13
arguments 13
fade 13
with 13
the 13
city 13
lights 13
behind 13
thirtythe 13
promise 13
of 13
a 13
decade 13
of 13
loneliness 13
a 13
thinning 13
list 13
of 13
single 13
men 13
to 13
know 13
a 13
thinning 13
briefcase 13
of 13
enthusiasm 13
thinning 13
hair 13
but 13
there 13
was 13
jordan 13
beside 13
me 13
who 13
unlike 13
daisy 13
was 13
too 13
wise 13
ever 13
to 13
carry 13
wellforgotten 13
dreams 13
from 13
age 13
to 13
age 13
as 13
we 13
passed 13
over 13
the 13
dark 13
bridge 13
her 13
wan 13
face 13
fell 13
lazily 13
against 13
my 13
coats 13
shoulder 13
and 13
the 13
formidable 13
stroke 13
of 13
thirty 13
died 13
away 13
with 13
the 13
reassuring 13
pressure 13
of 13
her 13
hand 13
so 13
we 13
drove 13
on 13
toward 13
death 13
through 13
the 13
cooling 13
twilight 13
the 13
young 13
greek 13
michaelis 13
who 13
ran 13
the 13
coffee 13
joint 13
beside 13
the 13
ashheaps 13
was 13
the 13
principal 13
witness 13
at 13
the 13
inquest 13
he 13
had 13
slept 13
through 13
the 13
heat 13
until 13
after 13
five 13
when 13
he 13
strolled 13
over 13
to 13
the 13
garage 13
and 13
found 13
george 13
wilson 13
sick 13
in 13
his 13
officereally 13
sick 13
pale 13
as 13
his 13
own 13
pale 13
hair 13
and 13
shaking 13
all 13
over 13
michaelis 13
advised 13
him 13
to 13
go 13
to 13
bed 13
but 13
wilson 13
refused 13
saying 13
that 13
hed 13
miss 13
a 13
lot 13
of 13
business 13
if 13
he 13
did 13
while 13
his 13
neighbor 13
was 13
trying 13
to 13
persuade 13
him 13
a 13
violent 13
racket 13
broke 13
out 13
overhead 13
ive 13
got 13
my 13
wife 13
locked 13
in 13
up 13
there 13
explained 13
wilson 13
calmly 13
shes 13
going 13
to 13
stay 13
there 13
till 13
the 13
day 13
after 13
tomorrow 13
and 13
then 13
were 13
going 13
to 13
move 13
away 13
michaelis 13
was 13
astonished 13
they 13
had 13
been 13
neighbors 13
for 13
four 13
years 13
and 13
wilson 13
had 13
never 13
seemed 13
faintly 13
capable 13
of 13
such 13
a 13
statement 13
generally 13
he 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
these 13
wornout 13
men 13
when 13
he 13
wasnt 13
working 13
he 13
sat 13
on 13
a 13
chair 13
in 13
the 13
doorway 13
and 13
stared 13
at 13
the 13
people 13
and 13
the 13
cars 13
that 13
passed 13
along 13
the 13
road 13
when 13
any 13
one 13
spoke 13
to 13
him 13
he 13
invariably 13
laughed 13
in 13
an 13
agreeable 13
colorless 13
way 13
he 13
was 13
his 13
wifes 13
man 13
and 13
not 13
his 13
own 13
so 13
naturally 13
michaelis 13
tried 13
to 13
find 13
out 13
what 13
had 13
happened 13
but 13
wilson 13
wouldnt 13
say 13
a 13
wordinstead 13
he 13
began 13
to 13
throw 13
curious 13
suspicious 13
glances 13
at 13
his 13
visitor 13
and 13
ask 13
him 13
what 13
hed 13
been 13
doing 13
at 13
certain 13
times 13
on 13
certain 13
days 13
just 13
as 13
the 13
latter 13
was 13
getting 13
uneasy 13
some 13
workmen 13
came 13
past 13
the 13
door 13
bound 13
for 13
his 13
restaurant 13
and 13
michaelis 13
took 13
the 13
opportunity 13
to 13
get 13
away 13
intending 13
to 13
come 13
back 13
later 13
but 13
he 13
didnt 13
he 13
supposed 13
he 13
forgot 13
to 13
thats 13
all 13
when 13
he 13
came 13
outside 13
again 13
a 13
little 13
after 13
seven 13
he 13
was 13
reminded 13
of 13
the 13
conversation 13
because 13
he 13
heard 13
mrs 13
wilsons 13
voice 13
loud 13
and 13
scolding 13
downstairs 13
in 13
the 13
garage 13
beat 13
me 13
he 13
heard 13
her 13
cry 13
throw 13
me 13
down 13
and 13
beat 13
me 13
you 13
dirty 13
little 13
coward 13
a 13
moment 13
later 13
she 13
rushed 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
dusk 13
waving 13
her 13
hands 13
and 13
shoutingbefore 13
he 13
could 13
move 13
from 13
his 13
door 13
the 13
business 13
was 13
over 13
the 13
death 13
car 13
as 13
the 13
newspapers 13
called 13
it 13
didnt 13
stop 13
it 13
came 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
gathering 13
darkness 13
wavered 13
tragically 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
and 13
then 13
disappeared 13
around 13
the 13
next 13
bend 13
michaelis 13
wasnt 13
even 13
sure 13
of 13
its 13
colorhe 13
told 13
the 13
first 13
policeman 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
light 13
green 13
the 13
other 13
car 13
the 13
one 13
going 13
toward 13
new 13
york 13
came 13
to 13
rest 13
a 13
hundred 13
yards 13
beyond 13
and 13
its 13
driver 13
hurried 13
back 13
to 13
where 13
myrtle 13
wilson 13
her 13
life 13
violently 13
extinguished 13
knelt 13
in 13
the 13
road 13
and 13
mingled 13
her 13
thick 13
dark 13
blood 13
with 13
the 13
dust 13
michaelis 13
and 13
this 13
man 13
reached 13
her 13
first 13
but 13
when 13
they 13
had 13
torn 13
open 13
her 13
shirtwaist 13
still 13
damp 13
with 13
perspiration 13
they 13
saw 13
that 13
her 13
left 13
breast 13
was 13
swinging 13
loose 13
like 13
a 13
flap 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
need 13
to 13
listen 13
for 13
the 13
heart 13
beneath 13
the 13
mouth 13
was 13
wide 13
open 13
and 13
ripped 13
at 13
the 13
corners 13
as 13
though 13
she 13
had 13
choked 13
a 13
little 13
in 13
giving 13
up 13
the 13
tremendous 13
vitality 13
she 13
had 13
stored 13
so 13
long 13
we 13
saw 13
the 13
three 13
or 13
four 13
automobiles 13
and 13
the 13
crowd 13
when 13
we 13
were 13
still 13
some 13
distance 13
away 13
wreck 13
said 13
tom 13
thats 13
good 13
wilsonll 13
have 13
a 13
little 13
business 13
at 13
last 13
he 13
slowed 13
down 13
but 13
still 13
without 13
any 13
intention 13
of 13
stopping 13
until 13
as 13
we 13
came 13
nearer 13
the 13
hushed 13
intent 13
faces 13
of 13
the 13
people 13
at 13
the 13
garage 13
door 13
made 13
him 13
automatically 13
put 13
on 13
the 13
brakes 13
well 13
take 13
a 13
look 13
he 13
said 13
doubtfully 13
just 13
a 13
look 13
i 13
became 13
aware 13
now 13
of 13
a 13
hollow 13
wailing 13
sound 13
which 13
issued 13
incessantly 13
from 13
the 13
garage 13
a 13
sound 13
which 13
as 13
we 13
got 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
coupe 13
and 13
walked 13
toward 13
the 13
door 13
resolved 13
itself 13
into 13
the 13
words 13
oh 13
my 13
god 13
uttered 13
over 13
and 13
over 13
in 13
a 13
gasping 13
moan 13
theres 13
some 13
bad 13
trouble 13
here 13
said 13
tom 13
excitedly 13
he 13
reached 13
up 13
on 13
tiptoes 13
and 13
peered 13
over 13
a 13
circle 13
of 13
heads 13
into 13
the 13
garage 13
which 13
was 13
lit 13
only 13
by 13
a 13
yellow 13
light 13
in 13
a 13
swinging 13
wire 13
basket 13
overhead 13
then 13
he 13
made 13
a 13
harsh 13
sound 13
in 13
his 13
throat 13
and 13
with 13
a 13
violent 13
thrusting 13
movement 13
of 13
his 13
powerful 13
arms 13
pushed 13
his 13
way 13
through 13
the 13
circle 13
closed 13
up 13
again 13
with 13
a 13
running 13
murmur 13
of 13
expostulation 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
minute 13
before 13
i 13
could 13
see 13
anything 13
at 13
all 13
then 13
new 13
arrivals 13
deranged 13
the 13
line 13
and 13
jordan 13
and 13
i 13
were 13
pushed 13
suddenly 13
inside 13
myrtle 13
wilsons 13
body 13
wrapped 13
in 13
a 13
blanket 13
and 13
then 13
in 13
another 13
blanket 13
as 13
though 13
she 13
suffered 13
from 13
a 13
chill 13
in 13
the 13
hot 13
night 13
lay 13
on 13
a 13
worktable 13
by 13
the 13
wall 13
and 13
tom 13
with 13
his 13
back 13
to 13
us 13
was 13
bending 13
over 13
it 13
motionless 13
next 13
to 13
him 13
stood 13
a 13
motorcycle 13
policeman 13
taking 13
down 13
names 13
with 13
much 13
sweat 13
and 13
correction 13
in 13
a 13
little 13
book 13
at 13
first 13
i 13
couldnt 13
find 13
the 13
source 13
of 13
the 13
high 13
groaning 13
words 13
that 13
echoed 13
clamorously 13
through 13
the 13
bare 13
garagethen 13
i 13
saw 13
wilson 13
standing 13
on 13
the 13
raised 13
threshold 13
of 13
his 13
office 13
swaying 13
back 13
and 13
forth 13
and 13
holding 13
to 13
the 13
doorposts 13
with 13
both 13
hands 13
some 13
man 13
was 13
talking 13
to 13
him 13
in 13
a 13
low 13
voice 13
and 13
attempting 13
from 13
time 13
to 13
time 13
to 13
lay 13
a 13
hand 13
on 13
his 13
shoulder 13
but 13
wilson 13
neither 13
heard 13
nor 13
saw 13
his 13
eyes 13
would 13
drop 13
slowly 13
from 13
the 13
swinging 13
light 13
to 13
the 13
laden 13
table 13
by 13
the 13
wall 13
and 13
then 13
jerk 13
back 13
to 13
the 13
light 13
again 13
and 13
he 13
gave 13
out 13
incessantly 13
his 13
high 13
horrible 13
call 13
oh 13

gaod 13
oh 13

gaod 13

presently 13
tom 13
lifted 13
his 13
head 13
with 13
a 13
jerk 13
and 13
after 13
staring 13
around 13
the 13
garage 13
with 13
glazed 13
eyes 13
addressed 13
a 13
mumbled 13
incoherent 13
remark 13

in 13

with 13
soothing 13
gruffness 13
wilsons 13
eyes 13
fell 13
upon 13
tom 13
he 13
started 13
up 13
on 13
his 13
tiptoes 13
and 13
then 13
would 13
have 13
collapsed 13
to 13
his 13
knees 13
had 13
not 13
tom 13
held 13

near 13
enough 13
to 13
hear 13
what 13
he 13
said 13
but 13
the 13
policeman 13
caught 13
something 13
in 13
the 13
tone 13
and 13
looked 13
over 13
with 13
truculent 13
eyes 13
whats 13

he 13
demanded 13

his 13
head 13

kept 13
his 13
hands 13
firm 13
on 13
wilsons 13
body 13

it 13
was 13
a 13
yellow 13
car 13
some 13
dim 13
impulse 13
moved 13
the 13
policeman 13
to 13
look 13
suspiciously 13
at 13
tom 13
and 13
what 13
colors 13
your 13
car 13
its 13
a 13
blue 13
car 13

i 13
said 13
some 13
one 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
driving 13
a 13
little 13
behind 13
us 13
confirmed 13
this 13
and 13
the 13
policeman 13
turned 13
away 13
now 13
if 13
youll 13
let 13
me 13
have 13
that 13
name 13
again 13
correct 13
picking 13
up 13
wilson 13
like 13
a 13
doll 13
tom 13
carried 13
him 13
into 13
the 13
office 13
set 13
him 13
down 13
in 13
a 13
chair 13
and 13
came 13
back 13
if 13
somebodyll 13
come 13
here 13
and 13
sit 13
with 13
him 13
he 13
snapped 13
authoritatively 13
he 13
watched 13
while 13
the 13
two 13
men 13
standing 13
closest 13
glanced 13
at 13
each 13
other 13
and 13
went 13
unwillingly 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
then 13
tom 13
shut 13
the 13
door 13
on 13
them 13
and 13
came 13
down 13
the 13
single 13
step 13
his 13
eyes 13
avoiding 13
the 13
table 13
as 13
he 13
passed 13
close 13
to 13
me 13
he 13
whispered 13
lets 13
get 13
out 13
selfconsciously 13
with 13
his 13
authoritative 13
arms 13
breaking 13
the 13
way 13
we 13
pushed 13
through 13
the 13
still 13
gathering 13
crowd 13
passing 13
a 13
hurried 13
doctor 13
case 13
in 13
hand 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
sent 13
for 13
in 13
wild 13
hope 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
ago 13
tom 13
drove 13
slowly 13
until 13
we 13
were 13
beyond 13
the 13
bendthen 13
his 13
foot 13
came 13
down 13
hard 13
and 13
the 13
coupe 13
raced 13
along 13
through 13
the 13
night 13
in 13
a 13
little 13
while 13
i 13
heard 13
a 13
low 13
husky 13
sob 13
and 13
saw 13
that 13
the 13
tears 13
were 13
overflowing 13
down 13
his 13
face 13
the 13
god 13
damned 13
coward 13
he 13
whimpered 13
he 13
didnt 13
even 13
stop 13
his 13
car 13
the 13
buchanans 13
house 13
floated 13
suddenly 13
toward 13
us 13
through 13
the 13
dark 13
rustling 13
trees 13
tom 13
stopped 13
beside 13
the 13
porch 13
and 13
looked 13
up 13
at 13
the 13
second 13
floor 13
where 13
two 13
windows 13
bloomed 13
with 13
light 13
among 13
the 13
vines 13
daisys 13
home 13
he 13
said 13
as 13
we 13
got 13
out 13
of 13
the 13
car 13
he 13
glanced 13
at 13

frowned 13

gravely 13
and 13
with 13
decision 13
as 13
we 13
walked 13
across 13
the 13
moonlight 13
gravel 13
to 13
the 13
porch 13
he 13

sick 13

i 13
wanted 13
to 13
be 13
alone 13
but 13
jordan 13
lingered 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
more 13
its 13
only 13
halfpast 13
nine 13
she 13

one 13
day 13
and 13
suddenly 13
that 13
included 13
jordan 13
too 13
she 13
must 13
have 13
seen 13
something 13
of 13
this 13
in 13
my 13
expression 13
for 13
she 13
turned 13
abruptly 13
away 13
and 13
ran 13
up 13
the 13
porch 13
steps 13
into 13
the 13
house 13
i 13
sat 13
down 13
for 13
a 13
few 13
minutes 13
with 13
my 13
head 13
in 13
my 13
hands 13
until 13
i 13
heard 13
the 13
phone 13
taken 13
up 13
inside 13
and 13
the 13
butlers 13
voice 13
calling 13
a 13
taxi 13
then 13
i 13
walked 13
slowly 13
down 13
the 13
drive 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
house 13
intending 13
to 13
wait 13
by 13
the 13
gate 13
i 13
hadnt 13
gone 13
twenty 13
yards 13
when 13
i 13
heard 13
my 13
name 13
and 13
gatsby 13
stepped 13
from 13
between 13
two 13
bushes 13
into 13
the 13
path 13
i 13
must 13
have 13
felt 13
pretty 13
weird 13
by 13
that 13
time 13
because 13
i 13
could 13
think 13
of 13
nothing 13
except 13
the 13
luminosity 13
of 13
his 13
pink 13
suit 13
under 13
the 13
moon 13
what 13
are 13
you 13
doing 13
i 13
inquired 13
just 13
standing 13
here 13
old 13
sport 13
somehow 13
that 13
seemed 13
a 13
despicable 13
occupation 13
for 13
all 13
i 13
knew 13
he 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
rob 13
the 13
house 13
in 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
wouldnt 13
have 13
been 13
surprised 13
to 13
see 13
sinister 13
faces 13
the 13
faces 13
of 13
wolfshiems 13
people 13
behind 13
him 13
in 13
the 13
dark 13
shrubbery 13
did 13
you 13
see 13
any 13
trouble 13
on 13
the 13
road 13
he 13
asked 13
after 13
a 13
minute 13
yes 13
he 13
hesitated 13
was 13
she 13
killed 13
yes 13
i 13
thought 13
so 13
i 13
told 13
daisy 13
i 13
thought 13
so 13
its 13
better 13
that 13
the 13
shock 13
should 13
all 13
come 13
at 13
once 13
she 13
stood 13
it 13
pretty 13
well 13
he 13
spoke 13
as 13
if 13
daisys 13
reaction 13
was 13
the 13
only 13
thing 13
that 13
mattered 13
i 13
got 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
by 13
a 13
side 13
road 13
he 13
went 13
on 13
and 13
left 13
the 13
car 13
in 13
my 13
garage 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
anybody 13
saw 13
us 13
but 13
of 13
course 13
i 13
cant 13
be 13
sure 13
i 13
disliked 13
him 13
so 13
much 13
by 13
this 13
time 13
that 13
i 13
didnt 13
find 13
it 13
necessary 13
to 13
tell 13
him 13
he 13
was 13
wrong 13
who 13
was 13
the 13
woman 13
he 13
inquired 13
her 13
name 13
was 13
wilson 13
her 13
husband 13
owns 13
the 13
garage 13
how 13
the 13
devil 13
did 13
it 13
happen 13
well 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
swing 13
the 13
wheel 13
he 13
broke 13
off 13
and 13
suddenly 13
i 13
guessed 13
at 13
the 13
truth 13
was 13
daisy 13
driving 13
yes 13
he 13
said 13
after 13
a 13
moment 13
but 13
of 13
course 13
ill 13
say 13
i 13
was 13
you 13
see 13
when 13
we 13
left 13
new 13
york 13
she 13
was 13
very 13
nervous 13
and 13
she 13
thought 13
it 13
would 13
steady 13
her 13
to 13
driveand 13
this 13
woman 13
rushed 13
out 13
at 13
us 13
just 13
as 13
we 13
were 13
passing 13
a 13
car 13
coming 13
the 13
other 13
way 13
it 13
all 13
happened 13
in 13
a 13
minute 13
but 13
it 13
seemed 13
to 13
me 13
that 13
she 13
wanted 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
us 13
thought 13
we 13
were 13
somebody 13
she 13
knew 13
well 13
first 13
daisy 13
turned 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
woman 13
toward 13
the 13
other 13
car 13
and 13
then 13
she 13
lost 13
her 13
nerve 13
and 13
turned 13
back 13
the 13
second 13
my 13
hand 13
reached 13
the 13
wheel 13
i 13
felt 13
the 13
shockit 13
must 13
have 13
killed 13
her 13
instantly 13

ripped 13
her 13
open 13
dont 13
tell 13

winced 13
anyhowdaisy 13
stepped 13
on 13
it 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
make 13
her 13
stop 13
but 13
she 13
couldnt 13
so 13
i 13
pulled 13
on 13
the 13
emergency 13
brake 13
then 13
she 13
fell 13
over 13
into 13
my 13
lap 13
and 13
i 13
drove 13
on 13
shell 13

and 13

to 13
bother 13
her 13
about 13
that 13
unpleasantness 13
this 13
afternoon 13
shes 13
locked 13
herself 13
into 13
her 13
room 13
and 13
if 13
he 13

any 13
brutality 13

going 13
to 13
turn 13
the 13
light 13
out 13
and 13
on 13
again 13
he 13
wont 13

might 13
think 13
anything 13
i 13
looked 13
at 13
the 13
house 13
there 13
were 13
two 13
or 13
three 13
bright 13
windows 13
downstairs 13
and 13
the 13
pink 13
glow 13
from 13
daisys 13
room 13
on 13
the 13
second 13
floor 13
you 13
wait 13
here 13
i 13
said 13
ill 13
see 13
if 13
theres 13
any 13
sign 13
of 13
a 13
commotion 13
i 13
walked 13
back 13
along 13
the 13
border 13
of 13
the 13
lawn 13
traversed 13
the 13
gravel 13
softly 13
and 13
tiptoed 13
up 13
the 13
veranda 13
steps 13
the 13
drawingroom 13
curtains 13
were 13
open 13
and 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
the 13
room 13
was 13
empty 13
crossing 13
the 13
porch 13
where 13
we 13
had 13
dined 13
that 13
june 13
night 13
three 13
months 13
before 13
i 13
came 13
to 13
a 13
small 13
rectangle 13
of 13
light 13
which 13
i 13
guessed 13
was 13
the 13
pantry 13
window 13
the 13
blind 13
was 13
drawn 13
but 13
i 13
found 13
a 13
rift 13
at 13
the 13
sill 13
daisy 13
and 13
tom 13
were 13
sitting 13
opposite 13
each 13
other 13
at 13
the 13
kitchen 13
table 13
with 13
a 13
plate 13
of 13
cold 13
fried 13
chicken 13
between 13
them 13
and 13
two 13
bottles 13
of 13
ale 13
he 13
was 13
talking 13
intently 13
across 13
the 13
table 13
at 13
her 13
and 13
in 13
his 13
earnestness 13
his 13
hand 13
had 13
fallen 13
upon 13
and 13
covered 13
her 13
own 13
once 13
in 13
a 13
while 13
she 13
looked 13
up 13
at 13
him 13
and 13
nodded 13
in 13
agreement 13
they 13
werent 13
happy 13
and 13
neither 13
of 13
them 13
had 13
touched 13
the 13
chicken 13
or 13
the 13
aleand 13
yet 13
they 13
werent 13
unhappy 13
either 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
unmistakable 13
air 13
of 13
natural 13
intimacy 13
about 13
the 13
picture 13
and 13
anybody 13
would 13
have 13
said 13
that 13
they 13
were 13
conspiring 13
together 13
as 13
i 13
tiptoed 13
from 13
the 13
porch 13
i 13
heard 13
my 13
taxi 13
feeling 13
its 13
way 13
along 13
the 13
dark 13
road 13
toward 13
the 13
house 13
gatsby 13
was 13
waiting 13
where 13
i 13
had 13
left 13
him 13
in 13
the 13
drive 13
is 13
it 13
all 13
quiet 13
up 13
there 13
he 13
asked 13
anxiously 13
yes 13
its 13
all 13
quiet 13
i 13
hesitated 13
youd 13
better 13
come 13
home 13
and 13
get 13
some 13
sleep 13
he 13
shook 13
his 13
head 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
wait 13
here 13
till 13
daisy 13
goes 13
to 13
bed 13
good 13
night 13
old 13
sport 13
he 13
put 13
his 13
hands 13
in 13
his 13
coat 13
pockets 13
and 13
turned 13
back 13
eagerly 13
to 13
his 13
scrutiny 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
as 13
though 13
my 13
presence 13
marred 13
the 13
sacredness 13
of 13
the 13
vigil 13
so 13
i 13
walked 13
away 13
and 13
left 13
him 13
standing 13
there 13
in 13
the 13
moonlightwatching 13
over 13
nothing 13
chapter 13
i 13
couldnt 13
sleep 13
all 13
night 13
a 13
foghorn 13
was 13
groaning 13
incessantly 13
on 13
the 13
sound 13
and 13
i 13
tossed 13
halfsick 13
between 13
grotesque 13
reality 13
and 13
savage 13
frightening 13
dreams 13
toward 13
dawn 13
i 13
heard 13
a 13
taxi 13
go 13
up 13
gatsbys 13
drive 13
and 13
immediately 13
i 13
jumped 13
out 13
of 13
bed 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
dressi 13
felt 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
something 13
to 13
tell 13
him 13
something 13
to 13
warn 13
him 13
about 13
and 13
morning 13
would 13
be 13
too 13
late 13
crossing 13
his 13
lawn 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
his 13
front 13
door 13
was 13
still 13
open 13
and 13
he 13
was 13
leaning 13
against 13
a 13
table 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
heavy 13
with 13
dejection 13
or 13
sleep 13
nothing 13
happened 13
he 13
said 13
wanly 13
i 13
waited 13
and 13
about 13
four 13
oclock 13
she 13
came 13
to 13
the 13
window 13
and 13
stood 13
there 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
then 13
turned 13
out 13
the 13
light 13
his 13
house 13
had 13
never 13
seemed 13
so 13
enormous 13
to 13
me 13
as 13
it 13
did 13
that 13
night 13
when 13
we 13
hunted 13
through 13
the 13
great 13
rooms 13
for 13
cigarettes 13
we 13
pushed 13
aside 13
curtains 13
that 13
were 13
like 13
pavilions 13
and 13
felt 13
over 13
innumerable 13
feet 13
of 13
dark 13
wall 13
for 13
electric 13
light 13
switchesonce 13
i 13
tumbled 13
with 13
a 13
sort 13
of 13
splash 13
upon 13
the 13
keys 13
of 13
a 13
ghostly 13
piano 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
inexplicable 13
amount 13
of 13
dust 13
everywhere 13
and 13
the 13
rooms 13
were 13
musty 13
as 13
though 13
they 13
hadnt 13
been 13
aired 13
for 13
many 13
days 13
i 13
found 13
the 13
humidor 13
on 13
an 13
unfamiliar 13
table 13
with 13
two 13
stale 13
dry 13
cigarettes 13
inside 13
throwing 13
open 13
the 13
french 13
windows 13
of 13
the 13
drawingroom 13
we 13
sat 13
smoking 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
darkness 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
go 13
away 13
i 13
said 13
its 13
pretty 13
certain 13
theyll 13
trace 13
your 13
car 13
go 13
away 13
now 13
old 13
sport 13
go 13
to 13
atlantic 13
city 13
for 13
a 13
week 13
or 13
up 13
to 13
montreal 13
he 13
wouldnt 13
consider 13
it 13
he 13
couldnt 13
possibly 13
leave 13
daisy 13
until 13
he 13
knew 13
what 13
she 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
do 13
he 13
was 13
clutching 13
at 13
some 13
last 13
hope 13
and 13
i 13
couldnt 13
bear 13
to 13
shake 13
him 13
free 13
it 13
was 13
this 13
night 13
that 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
the 13
strange 13
story 13
of 13
his 13
youth 13
with 13
dan 13
codytold 13
it 13
to 13
me 13
because 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
had 13
broken 13
up 13
like 13
glass 13
against 13
toms 13
hard 13
malice 13
and 13
the 13
long 13
secret 13
extravaganza 13
was 13
played 13
out 13
i 13
think 13
that 13
he 13
would 13
have 13
acknowledged 13
anything 13
now 13
without 13
reserve 13
but 13
he 13
wanted 13
to 13
talk 13
about 13
daisy 13
she 13
was 13
the 13
first 13
nice 13
girl 13
he 13
had 13
ever 13
known 13
in 13
various 13
unrevealed 13
capacities 13
he 13
had 13
come 13
in 13
contact 13
with 13
such 13
people 13
but 13
always 13
with 13
indiscernible 13
barbed 13
wire 13
between 13
he 13
found 13
her 13
excitingly 13
desirable 13
he 13
went 13
to 13
her 13
house 13
at 13
first 13
with 13
other 13
officers 13
from 13
camp 13
taylor 13
then 13
alone 13
it 13
amazed 13
himhe 13
had 13
never 13
been 13
in 13
such 13
a 13
beautiful 13
house 13
before 13
but 13
what 13
gave 13
it 13
an 13
air 13
of 13
breathless 13
intensity 13
was 13
that 13
daisy 13
lived 13
thereit 13
was 13
as 13
casual 13
a 13
thing 13
to 13
her 13
as 13
his 13
tent 13
out 13
at 13
camp 13
was 13
to 13
him 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
ripe 13
mystery 13
about 13
it 13
a 13
hint 13
of 13
bedrooms 13
upstairs 13
more 13
beautiful 13
and 13
cool 13
than 13
other 13
bedrooms 13
of 13
gay 13
and 13
radiant 13
activities 13
taking 13
place 13
through 13
its 13
corridors 13
and 13
of 13
romances 13
that 13
were 13
not 13
musty 13
and 13
laid 13
away 13
already 13
in 13
lavender 13
but 13
fresh 13
and 13
breathing 13
and 13
redolent 13
of 13
this 13
years 13
shining 13
motorcars 13
and 13
of 13
dances 13
whose 13
flowers 13
were 13
scarcely 13
withered 13
it 13
excited 13
him 13
too 13
that 13
many 13
men 13
had 13
already 13
loved 13
daisyit 13
increased 13
her 13
value 13
in 13
his 13
eyes 13
he 13
felt 13
their 13
presence 13
all 13
about 13
the 13
house 13
pervading 13
the 13
air 13
with 13
the 13
shades 13
and 13
echoes 13
of 13
still 13
vibrant 13
emotions 13
but 13
he 13
knew 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
daisys 13
house 13
by 13
a 13
colossal 13
accident 13
however 13
glorious 13
might 13
be 13
his 13
future 13
as 13
jay 13
gatsby 13
he 13
was 13
at 13
present 13
a 13
penniless 13
young 13
man 13
without 13
a 13
past 13
and 13
at 13
any 13
moment 13
the 13
invisible 13
cloak 13
of 13
his 13
uniform 13
might 13
slip 13
from 13
his 13
shoulders 13
so 13
he 13
made 13
the 13
most 13
of 13
his 13
time 13
he 13
took 13
what 13
he 13
could 13
get 13
ravenously 13
and 13
unscrupulously 13
eventually 13
he 13
took 13
daisy 13
one 13
still 13
october 13
night 13
took 13
her 13
because 13
he 13
had 13
no 13
real 13
right 13
to 13
touch 13
her 13
hand 13
he 13
might 13
have 13
despised 13
himself 13
for 13
he 13
had 13
certainly 13
taken 13
her 13
under 13
false 13
pretenses 13
i 13
dont 13
mean 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
traded 13
on 13
his 13
phantom 13
millions 13
but 13
he 13
had 13
deliberately 13
given 13
daisy 13
a 13
sense 13
of 13
security 13
he 13
let 13
her 13
believe 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
person 13
from 13
much 13
the 13
same 13
stratum 13
as 13
herselfthat 13
he 13
was 13
fully 13
able 13
to 13
take 13
care 13
of 13
her 13
as 13
a 13
matter 13
of 13
fact 13
he 13
had 13
no 13
such 13
facilitieshe 13
had 13
no 13
comfortable 13
family 13
standing 13
behind 13
him 13
and 13
he 13
was 13
liable 13
at 13
the 13
whim 13
of 13
an 13
impersonal 13
government 13
to 13
be 13
blown 13
anywhere 13
about 13
the 13
world 13
but 13
he 13
didnt 13
despise 13
himself 13
and 13
it 13
didnt 13
turn 13
out 13
as 13
he 13
had 13
imagined 13
he 13
had 13
intended 13
probably 13
to 13
take 13
what 13
he 13
could 13
and 13
gobut 13
now 13
he 13
found 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
committed 13
himself 13
to 13
the 13
following 13
of 13
a 13
grail 13
he 13
knew 13
that 13
daisy 13
was 13
extraordinary 13
but 13
he 13
didnt 13
realize 13
just 13
how 13
extraordinary 13
a 13
nice 13
girl 13
could 13
be 13
she 13
vanished 13
into 13
her 13
rich 13
house 13
into 13
her 13
rich 13
full 13
life 13
leaving 13
gatsbynothing 13
he 13
felt 13
married 13
to 13
her 13
that 13
was 13
all 13
when 13
they 13
met 13
again 13
two 13
days 13
later 13
it 13
was 13
gatsby 13
who 13
was 13
breathless 13
who 13
was 13
somehow 13
betrayed 13
her 13
porch 13
was 13
bright 13
with 13
the 13
bought 13
luxury 13
of 13
starshine 13
the 13
wicker 13
of 13
the 13
settee 13
squeaked 13
fashionably 13
as 13
she 13
turned 13
toward 13
him 13
and 13
he 13
kissed 13
her 13
curious 13
and 13
lovely 13
mouth 13
she 13
had 13
caught 13
a 13
cold 13
and 13
it 13
made 13
her 13
voice 13
huskier 13
and 13
more 13
charming 13
than 13
ever 13
and 13
gatsby 13
was 13
overwhelmingly 13
aware 13
of 13
the 13
youth 13
and 13
mystery 13
that 13
wealth 13
imprisons 13
and 13
preserves 13
of 13
the 13
freshness 13
of 13
many 13
clothes 13
and 13
of 13
daisy 13
gleaming 13
like 13
silver 13
safe 13
and 13
proud 13
above 13
the 13
hot 13
struggles 13
of 13
the 13
poor 13
i 13
cant 13
describe 13
to 13
you 13
how 13
surprised 13
i 13
was 13
to 13
find 13
out 13
i 13
loved 13
her 13
old 13
sport 13
i 13
even 13
hoped 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
that 13
shed 13
throw 13
me 13
over 13
but 13
she 13
didnt 13
because 13
she 13
was 13
in 13
love 13
with 13
me 13
too 13
she 13
thought 13
i 13
knew 13
a 13
lot 13
because 13
i 13
knew 13
different 13
things 13
from 13
her 13
well 13
there 13
i 13
was 13
way 13
off 13
my 13
ambitions 13
getting 13
deeper 13
in 13
love 13
every 13
minute 13
and 13
all 13
of 13
a 13
sudden 13
i 13
didnt 13
care 13
what 13
was 13
the 13
use 13
of 13
doing 13
great 13
things 13
if 13
i 13
could 13
have 13
a 13
better 13
time 13
telling 13
her 13
what 13
i 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
do 13
on 13
the 13
last 13
afternoon 13
before 13
he 13
went 13
abroad 13
he 13
sat 13
with 13
daisy 13
in 13
his 13
arms 13
for 13
a 13
long 13
silent 13
time 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
cold 13
fall 13
day 13
with 13
fire 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
and 13
her 13
cheeks 13
flushed 13
now 13
and 13
then 13
she 13
moved 13
and 13
he 13
changed 13
his 13
arm 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
once 13
he 13
kissed 13
her 13
dark 13
shining 13
hair 13
the 13
afternoon 13
had 13
made 13
them 13
tranquil 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
as 13
if 13
to 13
give 13
them 13
a 13
deep 13
memory 13
for 13
the 13
long 13
parting 13
the 13
next 13
day 13
promised 13
they 13
had 13
never 13
been 13
closer 13
in 13
their 13
month 13
of 13
love 13
nor 13
communicated 13
more 13
profoundly 13
one 13
with 13
another 13
than 13
when 13
she 13
brushed 13
silent 13
lips 13
against 13
his 13
coats 13
shoulder 13
or 13
when 13
he 13
touched 13
the 13
end 13
of 13
her 13
fingers 13
gently 13
as 13
though 13
she 13
were 13
asleep 13
he 13
did 13
extraordinarily 13
well 13
in 13
the 13
war 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
captain 13
before 13
he 13
went 13
to 13
the 13
front 13
and 13
following 13
the 13
argonne 13
battles 13
he 13
got 13
his 13
majority 13
and 13
the 13
command 13
of 13
the 13
divisional 13
machineguns 13
after 13
the 13
armistice 13
he 13
tried 13
frantically 13
to 13
get 13
home 13
but 13
some 13
complication 13
or 13
misunderstanding 13
sent 13
him 13
to 13
oxford 13
instead 13
he 13
was 13
worried 13
nowthere 13
was 13
a 13
quality 13
of 13
nervous 13
despair 13
in 13
daisys 13
letters 13
she 13
didnt 13
see 13
why 13
he 13
couldnt 13
come 13
she 13
was 13
feeling 13
the 13
pressure 13
of 13
the 13
world 13
outside 13
and 13
she 13
wanted 13
to 13
see 13
him 13
and 13
feel 13
his 13
presence 13
beside 13
her 13
and 13
be 13
reassured 13
that 13
she 13
was 13
doing 13
the 13
right 13
thing 13
after 13
all 13
for 13
daisy 13
was 13
young 13
and 13
her 13
artificial 13
world 13
was 13
redolent 13
of 13
orchids 13
and 13
pleasant 13
cheerful 13
snobbery 13
and 13
orchestras 13
which 13
set 13
the 13
rhythm 13
of 13
the 13
year 13
summing 13
up 13
the 13
sadness 13
and 13
suggestiveness 13
of 13
life 13
in 13
new 13
tunes 13
all 13
night 13
the 13
saxophones 13
wailed 13
the 13
hopeless 13
comment 13
of 13
the 13
beale 13
street 13
blues 13
while 13
a 13
hundred 13
pairs 13
of 13
golden 13
and 13
silver 13
slippers 13
shuffled 13
the 13
shining 13
dust 13
at 13
the 13
gray 13
tea 13
hour 13
there 13
were 13
always 13
rooms 13
that 13
throbbed 13
incessantly 13
with 13
this 13
low 13
sweet 13
fever 13
while 13
fresh 13
faces 13
drifted 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
like 13
rose 13
petals 13
blown 13
by 13
the 13
sad 13
horns 13
around 13
the 13
floor 13
through 13
this 13
twilight 13
universe 13
daisy 13
began 13
to 13
move 13
again 13
with 13
the 13
season 13
suddenly 13
she 13
was 13
again 13
keeping 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
dates 13
a 13
day 13
with 13
half 13
a 13
dozen 13
men 13
and 13
drowsing 13
asleep 13
at 13
dawn 13
with 13
the 13
beads 13
and 13
chiffon 13
of 13
an 13
evening 13
dress 13
tangled 13
among 13
dying 13
orchids 13
on 13
the 13
floor 13
beside 13
her 13
bed 13
and 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
something 13
within 13
her 13
was 13
crying 13
for 13
a 13
decision 13
she 13
wanted 13
her 13
life 13
shaped 13
now 13
immediatelyand 13
the 13
decision 13
must 13
be 13
made 13
by 13
some 13
forceof 13
love 13
of 13
money 13
of 13
unquestionable 13
practicalitythat 13
was 13
close 13
at 13
hand 13
that 13
force 13
took 13
shape 13
in 13
the 13
middle 13
of 13
spring 13
with 13
the 13
arrival 13
of 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
wholesome 13
bulkiness 13
about 13
his 13
person 13
and 13
his 13
position 13
and 13
daisy 13
was 13
flattered 13
doubtless 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
certain 13
struggle 13
and 13
a 13
certain 13
relief 13
the 13
letter 13
reached 13
gatsby 13
while 13
he 13
was 13
still 13
at 13
oxford 13
it 13
was 13
dawn 13
now 13
on 13
long 13
island 13
and 13
we 13
went 13
about 13
opening 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
the 13
windows 13
downstairs 13
filling 13
the 13
house 13
with 13
grayturning 13
goldturning 13
light 13
the 13
shadow 13
of 13
a 13
tree 13
fell 13
abruptly 13
across 13
the 13
dew 13
and 13
ghostly 13
birds 13
began 13
to 13
sing 13
among 13
the 13
blue 13
leaves 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
slow 13
pleasant 13
movement 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
scarcely 13
a 13
wind 13
promising 13
a 13
cool 13
lovely 13
day 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
she 13
ever 13
loved 13
him 13
gatsby 13
turned 13
around 13
from 13
a 13
window 13
and 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
challengingly 13
you 13
must 13
remember 13
old 13
sport 13
she 13
was 13
very 13
excited 13
this 13
afternoon 13
he 13
told 13
her 13
those 13
things 13
in 13
a 13
way 13
that 13
frightened 13
herthat 13
made 13
it 13
look 13
as 13
if 13
i 13
was 13
some 13
kind 13
of 13
cheap 13
sharper 13
and 13
the 13
result 13
was 13
she 13
hardly 13
knew 13
what 13
she 13
was 13
saying 13
he 13
sat 13
down 13
gloomily 13
of 13
course 13
she 13
might 13
have 13
loved 13
him 13
just 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
when 13
they 13
were 13
first 13
marriedand 13
loved 13
me 13
more 13
even 13
then 13
do 13
you 13
see 13
suddenly 13
he 13
came 13
out 13
with 13
a 13
curious 13
remark 13
in 13
any 13
case 13
he 13
said 13
it 13
was 13
just 13
personal 13
what 13
could 13
you 13
make 13
of 13
that 13
except 13
to 13
suspect 13
some 13
intensity 13
in 13
his 13
conception 13
of 13
the 13
affair 13
that 13
couldnt 13
be 13
measured 13
he 13
came 13
back 13
from 13
france 13
when 13
tom 13
and 13
daisy 13
were 13
still 13
on 13
their 13
wedding 13
trip 13
and 13
made 13
a 13
miserable 13
but 13
irresistible 13
journey 13
to 13
louisville 13
on 13
the 13
last 13
of 13
his 13
army 13
pay 13
he 13
stayed 13
there 13
a 13
week 13
walking 13
the 13
streets 13
where 13
their 13
footsteps 13
had 13
clicked 13
together 13
through 13
the 13
november 13
night 13
and 13
revisiting 13
the 13
outoftheway 13
places 13
to 13
which 13
they 13
had 13
driven 13
in 13
her 13
white 13
car 13
just 13
as 13
daisys 13
house 13
had 13
always 13
seemed 13
to 13
him 13
more 13
mysterious 13
and 13
gay 13
than 13
other 13
houses 13
so 13
his 13
idea 13
of 13
the 13
city 13
itself 13
even 13
though 13
she 13
was 13
gone 13
from 13
it 13
was 13
pervaded 13
with 13
a 13
melancholy 13
beauty 13
he 13
left 13
feeling 13
that 13
if 13
he 13
had 13
searched 13
harder 13
he 13
might 13
have 13
found 13
herthat 13
he 13
was 13
leaving 13
her 13
behind 13
the 13
daycoachhe 13
was 13
penniless 13
nowwas 13
hot 13
he 13
went 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
open 13
vestibule 13
and 13
sat 13
down 13
on 13
a 13
foldingchair 13
and 13
the 13
station 13
slid 13
away 13
and 13
the 13
backs 13
of 13
unfamiliar 13
buildings 13
moved 13
by 13
then 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
spring 13
fields 13
where 13
a 13
yellow 13
trolley 13
raced 13
them 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
with 13
people 13
in 13
it 13
who 13
might 13
once 13
have 13
seen 13
the 13
pale 13
magic 13
of 13
her 13
face 13
along 13
the 13
casual 13
street 13
the 13
track 13
curved 13
and 13
now 13
it 13
was 13
going 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
sun 13
which 13
as 13
it 13
sank 13
lower 13
seemed 13
to 13
spread 13
itself 13
in 13
benediction 13
over 13
the 13
vanishing 13
city 13
where 13
she 13
had 13
drawn 13
her 13
breath 13
he 13
stretched 13
out 13
his 13
hand 13
desperately 13
as 13
if 13
to 13
snatch 13
only 13
a 13
wisp 13
of 13
air 13
to 13
save 13
a 13
fragment 13
of 13
the 13
spot 13
that 13
she 13
had 13
made 13
lovely 13
for 13
him 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
all 13
going 13
by 13
too 13
fast 13
now 13
for 13
his 13
blurred 13
eyes 13
and 13
he 13
knew 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
lost 13
that 13
part 13
of 13
it 13
the 13
freshest 13
and 13
the 13
best 13
forever 13
it 13
was 13
nine 13
oclock 13
when 13
we 13
finished 13
breakfast 13
and 13
went 13
out 13
on 13
the 13
porch 13
the 13
night 13
had 13
made 13
a 13
sharp 13
difference 13
in 13
the 13
weather 13
and 13
there 13
was 13
an 13
autumn 13
flavor 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
the 13
gardener 13
the 13
last 13
one 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
former 13
servants 13
came 13
to 13
the 13
foot 13
of 13

steps 13

to 13
me 13
apologetically 13

old 13
sport 13
ive 13
never 13
used 13
that 13
pool 13

summer 13
i 13
looked 13
at 13
my 13
watch 13
and 13
stood 13
up 13
twelve 13
minutes 13
to 13
my 13
train 13
i 13
didnt 13
want 13
to 13
go 13
to 13
the 13
city 13
i 13
wasnt 13
worth 13
a 13
decent 13
stroke 13
of 13
work 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
more 13
than 13
thati 13
didnt 13
want 13
to 13
leave 13
gatsby 13
i 13
missed 13
that 13
train 13
and 13
then 13
another 13
before 13
i 13
could 13
get 13
myself 13
away 13
ill 13
call 13

said 13
finally 13
do 13
old 13
sport 13
ill 13
call 13
you 13
about 13
noon 13
we 13
walked 13
slowly 13
down 13
the 13
steps 13
i 13
suppose 13
daisyll 13
call 13
too 13
he 13
looked 13
at 13
me 13
anxiously 13
as 13
if 13
he 13
hoped 13
id 13
corroborate 13
this 13
i 13
suppose 13
so 13
well 13
goodby 13
we 13
shook 13
hands 13
and 13
i 13
started 13
away 13
just 13
before 13
i 13
reached 13
the 13
hedge 13
i 13
remembered 13
something 13
and 13
turned 13
around 13
theyre 13
a 13
rotten 13
crowd 13
i 13
shouted 13
across 13
the 13
lawn 13
youre 13
worth 13
the 13
whole 13
damn 13
bunch 13
put 13
together 13
ive 13
always 13
been 13
glad 13
i 13
said 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
only 13
compliment 13
i 13
ever 13
gave 13
him 13
because 13
i 13
disapproved 13
of 13
him 13
from 13
beginning 13
to 13
end 13
first 13
he 13
nodded 13
politely 13
and 13
then 13
his 13
face 13
broke 13
into 13
that 13
radiant 13
and 13
understanding 13
smile 13
as 13
if 13
wed 13
been 13
in 13
ecstatic 13
cahoots 13
on 13
that 13
fact 13
all 13
the 13
time 13
his 13
gorgeous 13
pink 13
rag 13
of 13
a 13
suit 13
made 13
a 13
bright 13
spot 13
of 13
color 13
against 13
the 13
white 13
steps 13
and 13
i 13
thought 13
of 13
the 13
night 13
when 13
i 13
first 13
came 13
to 13
his 13
ancestral 13
home 13
three 13
months 13
before 13
the 13
lawn 13
and 13
drive 13
had 13
been 13
crowded 13
with 13
the 13
faces 13
of 13
those 13
who 13
guessed 13
at 13
his 13
corruptionand 13
he 13
had 13
stood 13
on 13
those 13
steps 13
concealing 13
his 13
incorruptible 13
dream 13
as 13
he 13
waved 13
them 13
goodby 13
i 13
thanked 13
him 13
for 13
his 13
hospitality 13
we 13
were 13
always 13
thanking 13
him 13
for 13
thati 13
and 13
the 13
others 13
goodby 13
i 13
called 13
i 13
enjoyed 13
breakfast 13
gatsby 13
up 13
in 13
the 13
city 13
i 13
tried 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
to 13
list 13
the 13
quotations 13
on 13
an 13
interminable 13
amount 13
of 13
stock 13
then 13
i 13
fell 13
asleep 13
in 13
my 13
swivelchair 13
just 13
before 13
noon 13
the 13
phone 13
woke 13
me 13
and 13
i 13
started 13
up 13
with 13
sweat 13
breaking 13
out 13
on 13
my 13
forehead 13
it 13
was 13
jordan 13
baker 13
she 13
often 13
called 13
me 13
up 13
at 13
this 13
hour 13
because 13
the 13
uncertainty 13
of 13
her 13
own 13
movements 13
between 13
hotels 13
and 13
clubs 13
and 13
private 13
houses 13
made 13
her 13
hard 13
to 13
find 13
in 13
any 13
other 13
way 13
usually 13
her 13
voice 13
came 13
over 13
the 13
wire 13
as 13
something 13
fresh 13
and 13
cool 13
as 13
if 13
a 13
divot 13
from 13
a 13
green 13
golflinks 13
had 13
come 13
sailing 13
in 13
at 13
the 13
office 13
window 13
but 13
this 13
morning 13
it 13
seemed 13
harsh 13
and 13
dry 13
ive 13
left 13
daisys 13
house 13
she 13
said 13
im 13
at 13
hempstead 13
and 13
im 13
going 13
down 13
to 13
southampton 13
this 13
afternoon 13
probably 13
it 13
had 13
been 13
tactful 13
to 13
leave 13
daisys 13
house 13
but 13
the 13
act 13
annoyed 13
me 13
and 13
her 13
next 13
remark 13
made 13
me 13
rigid 13
you 13
werent 13
so 13
nice 13
to 13
me 13
last 13
night 13
how 13
could 13
it 13
have 13
mattered 13
then 13
silence 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
then 13
howeveri 13
want 13
to 13
see 13
you 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
see 13
you 13
too 13
suppose 13
i 13
dont 13
go 13
to 13
southampton 13
and 13
come 13
into 13
town 13
this 13
afternoon 13
noi 13
dont 13
think 13
this 13
afternoon 13
very 13
well 13
its 13
impossible 13
this 13
afternoon 13
various 13
we 13
talked 13
like 13
that 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
and 13
then 13
abruptly 13
we 13
werent 13
talking 13
any 13
longer 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
which 13
of 13
us 13
hung 13
up 13
with 13
a 13
sharp 13
click 13
but 13
i 13
know 13
i 13
didnt 13
care 13
i 13
couldnt 13
have 13
talked 13
to 13
her 13
across 13
a 13
teatable 13
that 13
day 13
if 13
i 13
never 13
talked 13
to 13
her 13
again 13
in 13
this 13
world 13
i 13
called 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
a 13
few 13
minutes 13
later 13
but 13
the 13
line 13
was 13
busy 13
i 13
tried 13
four 13
times 13
finally 13
an 13
exasperated 13
central 13
told 13
me 13
the 13
wire 13
was 13
being 13
kept 13
open 13
for 13
long 13
distance 13
from 13
detroit 13
taking 13
out 13
my 13
timetable 13
i 13
drew 13
a 13
small 13
circle 13
around 13
the 13
threefifty 13
train 13
then 13
i 13
leaned 13
back 13
in 13
my 13
chair 13
and 13
tried 13
to 13
think 13
it 13
was 13
just 13
noon 13
when 13
i 13
passed 13
the 13
ashheaps 13
on 13
the 13
train 13
that 13
morning 13
i 13
had 13
crossed 13
deliberately 13
to 13
the 13
other 13
side 13
of 13
the 13
car 13
i 13
suppose 13
thered 13
be 13
a 13
curious 13
crowd 13
around 13
there 13
all 13
day 13
with 13
little 13
boys 13
searching 13
for 13
dark 13
spots 13
in 13
the 13
dust 13
and 13
some 13
garrulous 13
man 13
telling 13
over 13
and 13
over 13
what 13
had 13
happened 13
until 13
it 13
became 13
less 13
and 13
less 13
real 13
even 13
to 13
him 13
and 13
he 13
could 13
tell 13
it 13
no 13
longer 13
and 13
myrtle 13
wilsons 13
tragic 13
achievement 13
was 13
forgotten 13
now 13
i 13
want 13
to 13
go 13
back 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
tell 13
what 13
happened 13
at 13
the 13
garage 13
after 13
we 13
left 13
there 13
the 13
night 13
before 13
they 13
had 13
difficulty 13
in 13
locating 13
the 13
sister 13
catherine 13
she 13
must 13
have 13
broken 13
her 13
rule 13
against 13
drinking 13
that 13
night 13
for 13
when 13
she 13
arrived 13
she 13
was 13
stupid 13
with 13
liquor 13
and 13
unable 13
to 13
understand 13
that 13
the 13
ambulance 13
had 13
already 13
gone 13
to 13
flushing 13
when 13
they 13
convinced 13
her 13
of 13
this 13
she 13
immediately 13
fainted 13
as 13
if 13
that 13
was 13
the 13
intolerable 13
part 13
of 13
the 13
affair 13
some 13
one 13
kind 13
or 13
curious 13
took 13
her 13
in 13
his 13
car 13
and 13
drove 13
her 13
in 13
the 13
wake 13
of 13
her 13
sisters 13
body 13
until 13
long 13
after 13
midnight 13
a 13
changing 13
crowd 13
lapped 13
up 13
against 13
the 13
front 13
of 13
the 13
garage 13
while 13
george 13
wilson 13
rocked 13
himself 13
back 13
and 13
forth 13
on 13
the 13
couch 13
inside 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
the 13
door 13
of 13
the 13
office 13
was 13
open 13
and 13
every 13
one 13
who 13
came 13
into 13
the 13
garage 13
glanced 13
irresistibly 13
through 13
it 13
finally 13
someone 13
said 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
shame 13
and 13
closed 13
the 13
door 13
michaelis 13
and 13
several 13
other 13
men 13
were 13
with 13
him 13
first 13
four 13
or 13
five 13
men 13
later 13
two 13
or 13
three 13
men 13
still 13
later 13
michaelis 13
had 13
to 13
ask 13
the 13
last 13
stranger 13
to 13
wait 13
there 13
fifteen 13
minutes 13
longer 13
while 13
he 13
went 13
back 13
to 13
his 13
own 13
place 13
and 13
made 13
a 13
pot 13
of 13
coffee 13
after 13
that 13
he 13
stayed 13
there 13
alone 13
with 13
wilson 13
until 13
dawn 13
about 13
three 13
oclock 13
the 13
quality 13
of 13
wilsons 13
incoherent 13
muttering 13
changedhe 13
grew 13
quieter 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
talk 13
about 13
the 13
yellow 13
car 13
he 13
announced 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
a 13
way 13
of 13
finding 13
out 13
whom 13
the 13
yellow 13
car 13
belonged 13
to 13
and 13
then 13
he 13
blurted 13
out 13
that 13
a 13
couple 13
of 13
months 13
ago 13
his 13
wife 13
had 13
come 13
from 13
the 13
city 13
with 13
her 13
face 13
bruised 13
and 13
her 13
nose 13
swollen 13
but 13
when 13
he 13
heard 13
himself 13
say 13
this 13
he 13
flinched 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
cry 13
oh 13
my 13
god 13
again 13
in 13
his 13
groaning 13
voice 13
michaelis 13
made 13
a 13
clumsy 13
attempt 13
to 13
distract 13
him 13
how 13
long 13
have 13
you 13
been 13
married 13
george 13
come 13
on 13
there 13
try 13
and 13
sit 13
still 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
answer 13
my 13
question 13
how 13
long 13
have 13
you 13
been 13
married 13
twelve 13
years 13
ever 13
had 13
any 13
children 13
come 13
on 13
george 13
sit 13
stilli 13
asked 13
you 13
a 13
question 13
did 13
you 13
ever 13
have 13
any 13
children 13
the 13
hard 13
brown 13
beetles 13
kept 13
thudding 13
against 13
the 13
dull 13
light 13
and 13
whenever 13
michaelis 13
heard 13
a 13
car 13
go 13
tearing 13
along 13
the 13
road 13
outside 13
it 13
sounded 13
to 13
him 13
like 13
the 13
car 13
that 13
hadnt 13
stopped 13
a 13
few 13
hours 13
before 13
he 13
didnt 13
like 13
to 13
go 13
into 13
the 13
garage 13
because 13
the 13
work 13
bench 13
was 13
stained 13
where 13
the 13
body 13
had 13
been 13
lying 13
so 13
he 13
moved 13
uncomfortably 13
around 13
the 13
officehe 13
knew 13
every 13
object 13
in 13
it 13
before 13
morningand 13
from 13
time 13
to 13
time 13
sat 13
down 13
beside 13
wilson 13
trying 13
to 13
keep 13
him 13
more 13
quiet 13
have 13
you 13
got 13
a 13
church 13
you 13
go 13
to 13
sometimes 13
george 13
maybe 13
even 13
if 13
you 13
havent 13
been 13
there 13
for 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
maybe 13
i 13
could 13
call 13
up 13
the 13
church 13
and 13
get 13
a 13
priest 13
to 13
come 13
over 13
and 13
he 13
could 13
talk 13
to 13
you 13
see 13
dont 13
belong 13
to 13
any 13
you 13
ought 13
to 13
have 13
a 13
church 13

times 13

you 13
must 13
have 13
gone 13
to 13
church 13

to 13
me 13
didnt 13
you 13
get 13
married 13
in 13
a 13
church 13
that 13
was 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
ago 13
the 13
effort 13
of 13
answering 13
broke 13
the 13
rhythm 13
of 13
his 13
rockingfor 13
a 13
moment 13
he 13
was 13
silent 13
then 13
the 13
same 13
halfknowing 13
halfbewildered 13
look 13
came 13
back 13
into 13
his 13
faded 13
eyes 13
look 13
in 13
the 13
drawer 13
there 13
he 13
said 13
pointing 13
at 13
the 13
desk 13
which 13
drawer 13
that 13
drawerthat 13
one 13
michaelis 13
opened 13
the 13
drawer 13
nearest 13
his 13
hand 13
there 13
was 13
nothing 13
in 13
it 13
but 13
a 13
small 13
expensive 13
dogleash 13
made 13
of 13
leather 13
and 13
braided 13
silver 13
it 13
was 13
apparently 13
new 13
this 13
he 13
inquired 13
holding 13
it 13
up 13
wilson 13
stared 13
and 13
nodded 13
i 13
found 13
it 13
yesterday 13
afternoon 13
she 13
tried 13
to 13
tell 13
me 13
about 13
it 13
but 13
i 13
knew 13
it 13
was 13
something 13
funny 13
you 13
mean 13
your 13
wife 13
bought 13
it 13
she 13
had 13
it 13
wrapped 13
in 13
tissue 13
paper 13
on 13
her 13
bureau 13
michaelis 13
didnt 13
see 13
anything 13
odd 13
in 13
that 13
and 13
he 13
gave 13
wilson 13
a 13
dozen 13
reasons 13
why 13
his 13
wife 13
might 13
have 13
bought 13
the 13
dogleash 13
but 13
conceivably 13
wilson 13
had 13
heard 13
some 13
of 13
these 13
same 13
explanations 13
before 13
from 13
myrtle 13
because 13
he 13
began 13
saying 13
oh 13
my 13
god 13
again 13
in 13
a 13
whisperhis 13
comforter 13
left 13
several 13
explanations 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
then 13
he 13
killed 13
her 13
said 13
wilson 13
his 13
mouth 13
dropped 13
open 13
suddenly 13
who 13
did 13
i 13
have 13
a 13
way 13
of 13
finding 13
out 13
youre 13
morbid 13
george 13
said 13
his 13
friend 13
this 13
has 13
been 13
a 13
strain 13
to 13
you 13
and 13
you 13
dont 13
know 13
what 13
youre 13
saying 13
youd 13
better 13
try 13
and 13
sit 13
quiet 13
till 13
morning 13
he 13
murdered 13
her 13
it 13
was 13
an 13
accident 13
george 13
wilson 13
shook 13
his 13
head 13
his 13
eyes 13
narrowed 13
and 13
his 13
mouth 13
widened 13
slightly 13
with 13
the 13
ghost 13
of 13
a 13
superior 13
hm 13
i 13
know 13
he 13
said 13
definitely 13
im 13
one 13
of 13
these 13
trusting 13
fellas 13
and 13
i 13
dont 13
think 13
any 13
harm 13
to 13
nobody 13
but 13
when 13
i 13
get 13
to 13
know 13
a 13
thing 13
i 13
know 13
it 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
man 13
in 13
that 13
car 13
she 13
ran 13
out 13
to 13
speak 13
to 13
him 13
and 13
he 13
wouldnt 13
stop 13
michaelis 13
had 13
seen 13
this 13
too 13
but 13
it 13
hadnt 13
occurred 13
to 13
him 13
that 13
there 13
was 13
any 13
special 13
significance 13
in 13
it 13
he 13
believed 13
that 13
mrs 13
wilson 13
had 13
been 13
running 13
away 13
from 13
her 13
husband 13
rather 13
than 13
trying 13
to 13
stop 13
any 13
particular 13
car 13
how 13
could 13
she 13
of 13
been 13
like 13
that 13
shes 13
a 13
deep 13
one 13
said 13
wilson 13
as 13
if 13
that 13
answered 13
the 13
question 13
ahhh 13
he 13
began 13
to 13
rock 13
again 13
and 13
michaelis 13
stood 13
twisting 13
the 13
leash 13
in 13
his 13
hand 13
maybe 13
you 13
got 13
some 13
friend 13
that 13
i 13
could 13
telephone 13
for 13
george 13
this 13
was 13
a 13
forlorn 13
hopehe 13
was 13
almost 13
sure 13
that 13
wilson 13
had 13
no 13
friend 13
there 13
was 13
not 13
enough 13
of 13
him 13
for 13
his 13
wife 13
he 13
was 13
glad 13
a 13
little 13
later 13
when 13
he 13
noticed 13
a 13
change 13
in 13
the 13
room 13
a 13
blue 13
quickening 13
by 13
the 13
window 13
and 13
realized 13
that 13
dawn 13
wasnt 13
far 13
off 13
about 13
five 13
oclock 13
it 13
was 13
blue 13
enough 13
outside 13
to 13
snap 13
off 13
the 13
light 13
wilsons 13
glazed 13
eyes 13
turned 13
out 13
to 13
the 13
ashheaps 13
where 13
small 13
gray 13
clouds 13
took 13
on 13
fantastic 13
shape 13
and 13
scurried 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
in 13
the 13
faint 13
dawn 13
wind 13
i 13
spoke 13
to 13
her 13
he 13
muttered 13
after 13
a 13
long 13
silence 13
i 13
told 13
her 13
she 13
might 13
fool 13
me 13
but 13
she 13
couldnt 13
fool 13
god 13
i 13
took 13
her 13
to 13
the 13
windowwith 13
an 13
effort 13
he 13
got 13
up 13
and 13
walked 13
to 13
the 13
rear 13
window 13
and 13
leaned 13
with 13
his 13
face 13
pressed 13
against 13
it 13
and 13
i 13
said 13
god 13
knows 13
what 13
youve 13
been 13
doing 13
everything 13
youve 13
been 13
doing 13
you 13
may 13
fool 13
me 13
but 13
you 13
cant 13
fool 13
god 13
standing 13
behind 13
him 13
michaelis 13
saw 13
with 13
a 13
shock 13
that 13
he 13
was 13
looking 13
at 13
the 13
eyes 13
of 13
doctor 13
t 13
j 13
eckleburg 13
which 13
had 13
just 13
emerged 13
pale 13
and 13
enormous 13
from 13
the 13
dissolving 13
night 13
god 13
sees 13
everything 13
repeated 13
wilson 13
thats 13
an 13
advertisement 13
michaelis 13
assured 13
him 13
something 13
made 13
him 13
turn 13
away 13
from 13
the 13
window 13
and 13
look 13
back 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
but 13
wilson 13
stood 13
there 13
a 13
long 13
time 13
his 13
face 13
close 13
to 13
the 13
window 13
pane 13
nodding 13
into 13
the 13
twilight 13
by 13
six 13
oclock 13
michaelis 13
was 13
worn 13
out 13
and 13
grateful 13
for 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
a 13
car 13
stopping 13
outside 13
it 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
watchers 13
of 13
the 13
night 13
before 13
who 13
had 13
promised 13
to 13
come 13
back 13
so 13
he 13
cooked 13
breakfast 13
for 13
three 13
which 13
he 13
and 13
the 13
other 13
man 13
ate 13
together 13
wilson 13
was 13
quieter 13
now 13
and 13
michaelis 13
went 13
home 13
to 13
sleep 13
when 13
he 13
awoke 13
four 13
hours 13
later 13
and 13
hurried 13
back 13
to 13
the 13
garage 13
wilson 13
was 13
gone 13
his 13
movementshe 13
was 13
on 13
foot 13
all 13
the 13
timewere 13
afterward 13
traced 13
to 13
port 13
roosevelt 13
and 13
then 13
to 13
gads 13
hill 13
where 13
he 13
bought 13
a 13
sandwich 13
that 13
he 13
didnt 13
eat 13
and 13
a 13
cup 13
of 13
coffee 13
he 13
must 13
have 13
been 13
tired 13
and 13
walking 13
slowly 13
for 13
he 13
didnt 13
reach 13
gads 13
hill 13
until 13
noon 13
thus 13
far 13
there 13
was 13
no 13
difficulty 13
in 13
accounting 13
for 13
his 13
timethere 13
were 13
boys 13
who 13
had 13
seen 13
a 13
man 13
acting 13
sort 13
of 13
crazy 13
and 13
motorists 13
at 13
whom 13
he 13
stared 13
oddly 13
from 13
the 13
side 13
of 13
the 13
road 13
then 13
for 13
three 13
hours 13
he 13
disappeared 13
from 13
view 13
the 13
police 13
on 13
the 13
strength 13
of 13
what 13
he 13
said 13
to 13
michaelis 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
a 13
way 13
of 13
finding 13
out 13
supposed 13
that 13
he 13
spent 13
that 13
time 13
going 13
from 13
garage 13
to 13
garage 13
thereabout 13
inquiring 13
for 13
a 13
yellow 13
car 13
on 13
the 13
other 13
hand 13
no 13
garage 13
man 13
who 13
had 13
seen 13
him 13
ever 13
came 13
forward 13
and 13
perhaps 13
he 13
had 13
an 13
easier 13
surer 13
way 13
of 13
finding 13
out 13
what 13
he 13
wanted 13
to 13
know 13
by 13
halfpast 13
two 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
west 13
egg 13
where 13
he 13
asked 13
someone 13
the 13
way 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
so 13
by 13
that 13
time 13
he 13
knew 13
gatsbys 13
name 13
at 13
two 13
oclock 13
gatsby 13
put 13
on 13
his 13
bathingsuit 13
and 13
left 13
word 13
with 13
the 13
butler 13
that 13
if 13
any 13
one 13
phoned 13
word 13
was 13
to 13
be 13
brought 13
to 13
him 13
at 13
the 13
pool 13
he 13
stopped 13
at 13
the 13
garage 13
for 13
a 13
pneumatic 13
mattress 13
that 13
had 13
amused 13
his 13
guests 13
during 13
the 13
summer 13
and 13
the 13
chauffeur 13
helped 13
him 13
pump 13
it 13
up 13
then 13
he 13
gave 13
instructions 13
that 13
the 13
open 13
car 13
wasnt 13
to 13
be 13
taken 13
out 13
under 13
any 13
circumstancesand 13
this 13
was 13
strange 13
because 13
the 13
front 13
right 13
fender 13
needed 13
repair 13
gatsby 13
shouldered 13
the 13
mattress 13
and 13
started 13
for 13
the 13
pool 13
once 13
he 13
stopped 13
and 13
shifted 13
it 13
a 13
little 13
and 13
the 13
chauffeur 13
asked 13
him 13
if 13
he 13
needed 13
help 13
but 13
he 13
shook 13
his 13
head 13
and 13
in 13
a 13
moment 13
disappeared 13
among 13
the 13
yellowing 13
trees 13
no 13
telephone 13
message 13
arrived 13
but 13
the 13
butler 13
went 13
without 13
his 13
sleep 13
and 13
waited 13
for 13
it 13
until 13
four 13
oclockuntil 13
long 13
after 13
there 13
was 13
any 13
one 13
to 13
give 13
it 13
to 13
if 13
it 13
came 13
i 13
have 13
an 13
idea 13
that 13
gatsby 13
himself 13
didnt 13
believe 13
it 13
would 13
come 13
and 13
perhaps 13
he 13
no 13
longer 13
cared 13
if 13
that 13
was 13
true 13
he 13
must 13
have 13
felt 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
lost 13
the 13
old 13
warm 13
world 13
paid 13
a 13
high 13
price 13
for 13
living 13
too 13
long 13
with 13
a 13
single 13
dream 13
he 13
must 13
have 13
looked 13
up 13
at 13
an 13
unfamiliar 13
sky 13
through 13
frightening 13
leaves 13
and 13
shivered 13
as 13
he 13
found 13
what 13
a 13
grotesque 13
thing 13
a 13
rose 13
is 13
and 13
how 13
raw 13
the 13
sunlight 13
was 13
upon 13
the 13
scarcely 13
created 13
grass 13
a 13
new 13
world 13
material 13
without 13
being 13
real 13
where 13
poor 13
ghosts 13
breathing 13
dreams 13
like 13
air 13
drifted 13
fortuitously 13
about 13
like 13
that 13
ashen 13
fantastic 13
figure 13
gliding 13
toward 13
him 13
through 13
the 13
amorphous 13
trees 13
the 13
chauffeurhe 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
wolfshiems 13
protegesheard 13
the 13
shotsafterward 13
he 13
could 13
only 13
say 13
that 13
he 13
hadnt 13
thought 13
anything 13
much 13
about 13
them 13
i 13
drove 13
from 13
the 13
station 13
directly 13
to 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
and 13
my 13
rushing 13
anxiously 13
up 13
the 13
front 13
steps 13
was 13
the 13
first 13
thing 13
that 13
alarmed 13
any 13
one 13
but 13
they 13
knew 13
then 13
i 13
firmly 13
believe 13
with 13
scarcely 13
a 13
word 13
said 13
four 13
of 13
us 13
the 13
chauffeur 13
butler 13
gardener 13
and 13
i 13
hurried 13
down 13
to 13
the 13
pool 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
faint 13
barely 13
perceptible 13
movement 13
of 13
the 13
water 13
as 13
the 13
fresh 13
flow 13
from 13
one 13
end 13
urged 13
its 13
way 13
toward 13
the 13
drain 13
at 13
the 13
other 13
with 13
little 13
ripples 13
that 13
were 13
hardly 13
the 13
shadows 13
of 13
waves 13
the 13
laden 13
mattress 13
moved 13
irregularly 13
down 13
the 13
pool 13
a 13
small 13
gust 13
of 13
wind 13
that 13
scarcely 13
corrugated 13
the 13
surface 13
was 13
enough 13
to 13
disturb 13
its 13
accidental 13
course 13
with 13
its 13
accidental 13
burden 13
the 13
touch 13
of 13
a 13
cluster 13
of 13
leaves 13
revolved 13
it 13
slowly 13
tracing 13
like 13
the 13
leg 13
of 13
compass 13
a 13
thin 13
red 13
circle 13
in 13
the 13
water 13
it 13
was 13
after 13
we 13
started 13
with 13
gatsby 13
toward 13
the 13
house 13
that 13
the 13
gardener 13
saw 13
wilsons 13
body 13
a 13
little 13
way 13
off 13
in 13
the 13
grass 13
and 13
the 13
holocaust 13
was 13
complete 13
chapter 13
after 13
two 13
years 13
i 13
remember 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
that 13
day 13
and 13
that 13
night 13
and 13
the 13
next 13
day 13
only 13
as 13
an 13
endless 13
drill 13
of 13
police 13
and 13
photographers 13
and 13
newspaper 13
men 13
in 13
and 13
out 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
front 13
door 13
a 13
rope 13
stretched 13
across 13
the 13
main 13
gate 13
and 13
a 13
policeman 13
by 13
it 13
kept 13
out 13
the 13
curious 13
but 13
little 13
boys 13
soon 13
discovered 13
that 13
they 13
could 13
enter 13
through 13
my 13
yard 13
and 13
there 13
were 13
always 13
a 13
few 13
of 13
them 13
clustered 13
openmouthed 13
about 13
the 13
pool 13
someone 13
with 13
a 13
positive 13
manner 13
perhaps 13
a 13
detective 13
used 13
the 13
expression 13
madman 13
as 13
he 13
bent 13
over 13
wilsons 13
body 13
that 13
afternoon 13
and 13
the 13
adventitious 13
authority 13
of 13
his 13
voice 13
set 13
the 13
key 13
for 13
the 13
newspaper 13
reports 13
next 13
morning 13
most 13
of 13
those 13
reports 13
were 13
a 13
nightmaregrotesque 13
circumstantial 13
eager 13
and 13
untrue 13
when 13
michaeliss 13
testimony 13
at 13
the 13
inquest 13
brought 13
to 13
light 13
wilsons 13
suspicions 13
of 13
his 13
wife 13
i 13
thought 13
the 13
whole 13
tale 13
would 13
shortly 13
be 13
served 13
up 13
in 13
racy 13
pasquinadebut 13
catherine 13
who 13
might 13
have 13
said 13
anything 13
didnt 13
say 13
a 13
word 13
she 13
showed 13
a 13
surprising 13
amount 13
of 13
character 13
about 13
it 13
toolooked 13
at 13
the 13
coroner 13
with 13
determined 13
eyes 13
under 13
that 13
corrected 13
brow 13
of 13
hers 13
and 13
swore 13
that 13
her 13
sister 13
had 13
never 13
seen 13
gatsby 13
that 13
her 13
sister 13
was 13
completely 13
happy 13
with 13
her 13
husband 13
that 13
her 13
sister 13
had 13
been 13
into 13
no 13
mischief 13
whatever 13
she 13
convinced 13
herself 13
of 13
it 13
and 13
cried 13
into 13
her 13
handkerchief 13
as 13
if 13
the 13
very 13
suggestion 13
was 13
more 13
than 13
she 13
could 13
endure 13
so 13
wilson 13
was 13
reduced 13
to 13
a 13
man 13
deranged 13
by 13
grief 13
in 13
order 13
that 13
the 13
case 13
might 13
remain 13
in 13
its 13
simplist 13
form 13
and 13
it 13
rested 13
there 13
but 13
all 13
this 13
part 13
of 13
it 13
seemed 13
remote 13
and 13
unessential 13
i 13
found 13
myself 13
on 13
gatsbys 13
side 13
and 13
alone 13
from 13
the 13
moment 13
i 13
telephoned 13
news 13
of 13
the 13
catastrophe 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
village 13
every 13
surmise 13
about 13
him 13
and 13
every 13
practical 13
question 13
was 13
referred 13
to 13
me 13
at 13
first 13
i 13
was 13
surprised 13
and 13
confused 13
then 13
as 13
he 13
lay 13
in 13
his 13
house 13
and 13
didnt 13
move 13
or 13
breathe 13
or 13
speak 13
hour 13
upon 13
hour 13
it 13
grew 13
upon 13
me 13
that 13
i 13
was 13
responsible 13
because 13
no 13
one 13
else 13
was 13
interestedinterested 13
i 13
mean 13
with 13
that 13
intense 13
personal 13
interest 13
to 13
which 13
every 13
one 13
has 13
some 13
vague 13
right 13
at 13
the 13
end 13
i 13
called 13
up 13
daisy 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
after 13
we 13
found 13
him 13
called 13
her 13
instinctively 13
and 13
without 13
hesitation 13
but 13
she 13
and 13
tom 13
had 13
gone 13
away 13
early 13
that 13
afternoon 13
and 13
taken 13
baggage 13
with 13
them 13
left 13
no 13
address 13

say 13
when 13
theyd 13

i 13
wanted 13
to 13
go 13
into 13
the 13
room 13
where 13
he 13
lay 13
and 13
reassure 13

for 13
you 13
meyer 13
wolfshiems 13
name 13
wasnt 13
in 13
the 13
phone 13
book 13
the 13
butler 13
gave 13
me 13
his 13
office 13
address 13
on 13
broadway 13
and 13
i 13
called 13
information 13
but 13
by 13
the 13
time 13
i 13
had 13
the 13
number 13
it 13
was 13
long 13
after 13
five 13
and 13
no 13
one 13
answered 13
the 13
phone 13
will 13
you 13
ring 13
again 13
ive 13
rung 13
them 13
three 13
times 13
its 13
very 13
important 13
sorry 13
im 13
afraid 13
no 13
ones 13
there 13
i 13
went 13
back 13
to 13
the 13
drawingroom 13
and 13
thought 13
for 13
an 13
instant 13
that 13
they 13
were 13
chance 13
visitors 13
all 13
these 13
official 13
people 13
who 13
suddenly 13
filled 13
it 13
but 13
as 13
they 13
drew 13
back 13
the 13
sheet 13
and 13
looked 13
at 13
gatsby 13
with 13
unmoved 13
eyes 13
his 13
protest 13
continued 13
in 13
my 13
brain 13
look 13
here 13
old 13
sport 13
youve 13
got 13
to 13
get 13
somebody 13
for 13
me 13
youve 13
got 13
to 13
try 13
hard 13
i 13
cant 13
go 13
through 13
this 13
alone 13
some 13
one 13
started 13
to 13
ask 13
me 13
questions 13
but 13
i 13
broke 13
away 13
and 13
going 13
upstairs 13
looked 13
hastily 13
through 13
the 13
unlocked 13
parts 13
of 13
his 13
deskhed 13
never 13
told 13
me 13
definitely 13
that 13
his 13
parents 13
were 13
dead 13
but 13
there 13
was 13
nothingonly 13
the 13
picture 13
of 13
dan 13
cody 13
a 13
token 13
of 13
forgotten 13
violence 13
staring 13
down 13
from 13
the 13
wall 13
next 13
morning 13
i 13
sent 13
the 13
butler 13
to 13
new 13
york 13
with 13
a 13
letter 13
to 13
wolfshiem 13
which 13
asked 13
for 13
information 13
and 13
urged 13
him 13
to 13
come 13
out 13
on 13
the 13
next 13
train 13
that 13
request 13
seemed 13
superfluous 13
when 13
i 13
wrote 13
it 13
i 13
was 13
sure 13
hed 13
start 13
when 13
he 13
saw 13
the 13
newspapers 13
just 13
as 13
i 13
was 13
sure 13
thered 13
be 13
a 13
wire 13
from 13
daisy 13
before 13
noonbut 13
neither 13
a 13
wire 13
nor 13
mr 13
wolfshiem 13
arrived 13
no 13
one 13
arrived 13
except 13
more 13
police 13
and 13
photographers 13
and 13
newspaper 13
men 13
when 13
the 13
butler 13
brought 13
back 13
wolfshiems 13
answer 13
i 13
began 13
to 13
have 13
a 13
feeling 13
of 13
defiance 13
of 13
scornful 13
solidarity 13
between 13
gatsby 13
and 13
me 13
against 13
them 13
all 13
dear 13
mr 13
carraway 13
this 13
has 13
been 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
most 13
terrible 13
shocks 13
of 13
my 13
life 13
to 13
me 13
i 13
hardly 13
can 13
believe 13
it 13
that 13
it 13
is 13
true 13
at 13
all 13
such 13
a 13
mad 13
act 13
as 13
that 13
man 13
did 13
should 13
make 13
us 13
all 13
think 13
i 13
cannot 13
come 13
down 13
now 13
as 13
i 13
am 13
tied 13
up 13
in 13
some 13
very 13
important 13
business 13
and 13
cannot 13
get 13
mixed 13
up 13
in 13
this 13
thing 13
now 13
if 13
there 13
is 13
anything 13
i 13
can 13
do 13
a 13
little 13
later 13
let 13
me 13
know 13
in 13
a 13
letter 13
by 13
edgar 13
i 13
hardly 13
know 13
where 13
i 13
am 13
when 13
i 13
hear 13
about 13
a 13
thing 13
like 13
this 13
and 13
am 13
completely 13
knocked 13
down 13
and 13
out 13
yours 13
truly 13
meyer 13
wolfshiem 13
and 13
then 13
hasty 13
addenda 13
beneath 13
let 13
me 13
know 13
about 13
the 13
funeral 13
etc 13
do 13
not 13
know 13
his 13
family 13
at 13
all 13
when 13
the 13
phone 13
rang 13
that 13
afternoon 13
and 13
long 13
distance 13
said 13
chicago 13
was 13
calling 13
i 13
thought 13
this 13
would 13
be 13
daisy 13
at 13
last 13
but 13
the 13
connection 13
came 13
through 13
as 13
a 13
mans 13
voice 13
very 13
thin 13
and 13
far 13
away 13
this 13
is 13
slagle 13
speaking 13
yes 13
the 13
name 13
was 13
unfamiliar 13
hell 13
of 13
a 13
note 13
isnt 13
it 13
get 13
my 13
wire 13

been 13
any 13

parkes 13
in 13
trouble 13
he 13
said 13
rapidly 13
they 13
picked 13
him 13
up 13
when 13
he 13
handed 13
the 13
bonds 13
over 13
the 13
counter 13
they 13
got 13
a 13
circular 13

a 13
long 13
silence 13
on 13
the 13
other 13
end 13
of 13
the 13
wire 13
followed 13
by 13
an 13
exclamation 13
then 13
a 13
quick 13
squawk 13
as 13
the 13
connection 13
was 13
broken 13
i 13
think 13
it 13
was 13
on 13
the 13
third 13
day 13
that 13
a 13
telegram 13
signed 13
henry 13
c 13
gatz 13
arrived 13
from 13
a 13
town 13
in 13
minnesota 13
it 13
said 13
only 13
that 13
the 13
sender 13
was 13
leaving 13
immediately 13
and 13
to 13
postpone 13
the 13
funeral 13
until 13
he 13
came 13
it 13
was 13
gatsbys 13
father 13
a 13
solemn 13
old 13
man 13
very 13
helpless 13
and 13
dismayed 13
bundled 13
up 13
in 13
a 13
long 13
cheap 13
ulster 13
against 13
the 13
warm 13
september 13
day 13
his 13
eyes 13
leaked 13
continuously 13
with 13
excitement 13
and 13
when 13
i 13
took 13
the 13
bag 13
and 13
umbrella 13
from 13
his 13
hands 13
he 13
began 13
to 13
pull 13
so 13
incessantly 13
at 13
his 13
sparse 13
gray 13
beard 13
that 13
i 13
had 13
difficulty 13
in 13
getting 13
off 13
his 13
coat 13
he 13
was 13
on 13
the 13
point 13
of 13
collapse 13
so 13
i 13
took 13
him 13
into 13
the 13
music 13
room 13
and 13
made 13
him 13
sit 13
down 13
while 13
i 13
sent 13
for 13
something 13
to 13
eat 13
but 13
he 13
wouldnt 13
eat 13
and 13
the 13
glass 13
of 13
milk 13
spilled 13
from 13
his 13
trembling 13
hand 13
i 13
saw 13
it 13
in 13
the 13
chicago 13
newspaper 13
he 13
said 13
it 13
was 13

didnt 13
know 13
how 13
to 13
reach 13
you 13
his 13
eyes 13
seeing 13
nothing 13
moved 13
ceaselessly 13
about 13
the 13
room 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
madman 13
he 13
said 13
he 13
must 13
have 13
been 13
mad 13
wouldnt 13
you 13
like 13
some 13

him 13
i 13

jimmy 13
i 13
took 13
him 13
into 13
the 13
drawingroom 13
where 13
his 13
son 13
lay 13
and 13
left 13
him 13
there 13
some 13
little 13
boys 13
had 13
come 13
up 13
on 13
the 13
steps 13
and 13
were 13
looking 13
into 13
the 13
hall 13
when 13
i 13
told 13
them 13
who 13
had 13
arrived 13
they 13
went 13
reluctantly 13
away 13
after 13
a 13
little 13
while 13
mr 13
gatz 13
opened 13
the 13
door 13
and 13
came 13
out 13
his 13
mouth 13
ajar 13
his 13
face 13
flushed 13
slightly 13
his 13
eyes 13
leaking 13
isolated 13
and 13
unpunctual 13
tears 13
he 13
had 13
reached 13
an 13
age 13
where 13
death 13
no 13
longer 13
has 13
the 13
quality 13
of 13
ghastly 13
surprise 13
and 13
when 13
he 13
looked 13
around 13
him 13
now 13
for 13
the 13
first 13
time 13
and 13
saw 13
the 13
height 13
and 13
splendor 13
of 13
the 13
hall 13
and 13
the 13
great 13
rooms 13
opening 13
out 13
from 13
it 13
into 13
other 13
rooms 13
his 13
grief 13
began 13
to 13
be 13
mixed 13
with 13
an 13
awed 13
pride 13
i 13
helped 13
him 13
to 13
a 13
bedroom 13
upstairs 13
while 13
he 13
took 13
off 13
his 13
coat 13
and 13
vest 13
i 13
told 13
him 13
that 13
all 13
arrangements 13
had 13
been 13
deferred 13
until 13
he 13
came 13
i 13

thought 13

want 13
to 13

shook 13
his 13
head 13

liked 13
it 13
better 13
down 13
east 13
he 13
rose 13
up 13
to 13
his 13
position 13
in 13
the 13
east 13

close 13
friends 13

a 13
big 13
future 13
before 13
him 13
you 13
know 13
he 13
was 13
only 13
a 13
young 13
man 13
but 13
he 13
had 13
a 13
lot 13
of 13
brain 13
power 13
here 13
he 13
touched 13
his 13
head 13
impressively 13
and 13
i 13
nodded 13
if 13
hed 13
of 13

of 13

said 13
uncomfortably 13
he 13
fumbled 13
at 13
the 13
embroidered 13
coverlet 13
trying 13
to 13
take 13
it 13
from 13
the 13
bed 13
and 13
lay 13
down 13
stifflywas 13
instantly 13
asleep 13
that 13
night 13
an 13
obviously 13
frightened 13
person 13
called 13
up 13
and 13
demanded 13
to 13
know 13
who 13

was 13
before 13

relieved 13
this 13
is 13
klipspringer 13
i 13
was 13
relieved 13
too 13
for 13
that 13

to 13
promise 13
another 13
friend 13
at 13
gatsbys 13
grave 13
i 13
didnt 13
want 13

few 13
people 13

hard 13
to 13

he 13
broke 13
out 13
hastily 13
of 13
course 13
im 13
not 13
likely 13
to 13
see 13
anybody 13
but 13
if 13
i 13
do 13
his 13
tone 13
made 13
me 13
suspicious 13
of 13

youll 13
be 13
there 13
yourself 13
well 13

certainly 13

up 13
about 13

wait 13
a 13
minute 13

come 13
well 13
the 13
fact 13
isthe 13

staying 13
with 13
some 13
people 13
up 13
here 13
in 13
greenwich 13

they 13
rather 13
expect 13

with 13
them 13
tomorrow 13
in 13
fact 13

do 13
my 13
very 13
best 13
to 13
get 13
away 13
i 13
ejaculated 13
an 13
unrestrained 13
huh 13
and 13
he 13
must 13
have 13
heard 13
me 13
for 13
he 13
went 13
on 13
nervously 13
what 13
i 13
called 13
up 13
about 13
was 13
a 13
pair 13
of 13
shoes 13
i 13
left 13
there 13
iwonder 13
if 13

my 13
address 13
is 13
care 13
of 13
b 13
f 13
i 13
didnt 13
hear 13
the 13
rest 13
of 13
the 13
name 13
because 13
i 13
hung 13
up 13
the 13
receiver 13
after 13
that 13
i 13
felt 13
a 13
certain 13
shame 13
for 13
gatsbyone 13
gentleman 13
to 13
whom 13
i 13
telephoned 13
implied 13
that 13
he 13
had 13
got 13
what 13
he 13
deserved 13
however 13
that 13
was 13
my 13
fault 13
for 13
he 13
was 13
one 13
of 13
those 13
who 13
used 13
to 13
sneer 13
most 13
bitterly 13
at 13
gatsby 13
on 13
the 13
courage 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
liquor 13
and 13
i 13
should 13
have 13
known 13
better 13
than 13
to 13
call 13
him 13
the 13
morning 13
of 13
the 13
funeral 13
i 13
went 13
up 13
to 13
new 13
york 13
to 13
see 13
meyer 13
wolfshiem 13

couldnt 13
seem 13
to 13
reach 13
him 13
any 13
other 13
way 13
the 13
door 13
that 13
i 13
pushed 13
open 13
on 13
the 13
advice 13
of 13
an 13
elevator 13
boy 13
was 13
marked 13
the 13
swastika 13
holding 13
company 13
and 13
at 13
first 13
there 13
didnt 13
seem 13
to 13
be 13
any 13
one 13
inside 13
but 13
when 13
id 13
shouted 13
hello 13
several 13
times 13
in 13
vain 13
an 13
argument 13
broke 13
out 13
behind 13
a 13
partition 13
and 13
presently 13
a 13
lovely 13
jewess 13
appeared 13
at 13
an 13
interior 13
door 13
and 13
scrutinized 13
me 13
with 13
black 13
hostile 13
eyes 13
nobodys 13
in 13
she 13
said 13

to 13
chicago 13
the 13
first 13
part 13
of 13

was 13
obviously 13
untrue 13
for 13
someone 13
had 13
begun 13
to 13
whistle 13
the 13
rosary 13
tunelessly 13
inside 13

a 13
voice 13
unmistakably 13
wolfshiems 13

there 13
she 13
took 13
a 13
step 13
toward 13
me 13
and 13
began 13
to 13
slide 13
her 13
hands 13
indignantly 13
up 13
and 13
down 13

solemnly 13
in 13
the 13
doorway 13
holding 13
out 13
both 13
hands 13
he 13
drew 13
me 13
into 13
his 13
office 13
remarking 13
in 13
a 13
reverent 13
voice 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
sad 13
time 13
for 13

for 13
some 13
reason 13
of 13
his 13
own 13
he 13
was 13
determined 13
not 13

i 13
stood 13
up 13
are 13
you 13
a 13
college 13
man 13
he 13
inquired 13
suddenly 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
i 13
thought 13
he 13
was 13
going 13
to 13
suggest 13
a 13
gonnegtion 13
but 13
he 13
only 13
nodded 13
and 13
shook 13
my 13
hand 13
let 13
us 13
learn 13
to 13
show 13
our 13
friendship 13
for 13
a 13
man 13
when 13
he 13
is 13
alive 13
and 13
not 13
after 13
he 13
is 13
dead 13
he 13
suggested 13
after 13
that 13
my 13
own 13
rule 13
is 13
to 13
let 13
everything 13
alone 13
when 13
i 13
left 13
his 13
office 13
the 13
sky 13
had 13
turned 13
dark 13
and 13
i 13
got 13
back 13
to 13
west 13
egg 13
in 13
a 13
drizzle 13
after 13
changing 13
my 13
clothes 13
i 13
went 13
next 13
door 13
and 13
found 13
mr 13
gatz 13
walking 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
excitedly 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
his 13
pride 13
in 13
his 13
son 13
and 13
in 13
his 13
sons 13
possessions 13
was 13
continually 13
increasing 13
and 13
now 13
he 13
had 13
something 13
to 13
show 13
me 13
jimmy 13
sent 13
me 13
this 13
picture 13
he 13
took 13
out 13
his 13
wallet 13
with 13
trembling 13
fingers 13
look 13
there 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
photograph 13
of 13
the 13
house 13
cracked 13
in 13
the 13
corners 13
and 13
dirty 13
with 13
many 13
hands 13
he 13
pointed 13
out 13
every 13
detail 13
to 13
me 13
eagerly 13
look 13
there 13
and 13
then 13
sought 13
admiration 13
from 13
my 13
eyes 13
he 13
had 13
shown 13
it 13
so 13
often 13
that 13
i 13
think 13
it 13
was 13
more 13
real 13
to 13
him 13
now 13
than 13
the 13
house 13
itself 13
jimmy 13
sent 13
it 13
to 13
me 13
i 13
think 13
its 13
a 13
very 13
pretty 13
picture 13
it 13
shows 13
up 13
well 13
very 13
well 13
had 13
you 13
seen 13
him 13
lately 13
he 13
come 13
out 13
to 13
see 13
me 13
two 13
years 13
ago 13
and 13
bought 13
me 13
the 13
house 13

live 13
in 13
now 13
of 13

was 13
broke 13
up 13
when 13
he 13
run 13
off 13
from 13
home 13
but 13
i 13
see 13
now 13
there 13
was 13
a 13
reason 13
for 13
it 13
he 13
knew 13
he 13
had 13
a 13
big 13
future 13
in 13
front 13
of 13
him 13
and 13
ever 13
since 13
he 13
made 13
a 13
success 13
he 13
was 13
very 13
generous 13
with 13
me 13
he 13
seemed 13
reluctant 13
to 13
put 13
away 13
the 13
picture 13
held 13
it 13
for 13
another 13
minute 13
lingeringly 13
before 13
my 13
eyes 13
then 13
he 13
returned 13
the 13
wallet 13
and 13
pulled 13
from 13
his 13
pocket 13
a 13
ragged 13
old 13

his 13
mind 13
he 13
was 13
always 13
great 13
for 13
that 13
he 13
told 13
me 13
i 13
et 13
like 13
a 13
hog 13
once 13
and 13
i 13
beat 13
him 13
for 13
it 13
he 13
was 13
reluctant 13
to 13
close 13
the 13
book 13
reading 13
each 13
item 13
aloud 13
and 13
then 13
looking 13
eagerly 13
at 13
me 13
i 13
think 13
he 13
rather 13
expected 13
me 13
to 13
copy 13
down 13
the 13
list 13
for 13
my 13
own 13
use 13
a 13
little 13
before 13
three 13
the 13
lutheran 13
minister 13
arrived 13
from 13
flushing 13
and 13
i 13
began 13
to 13
look 13
involuntarily 13
out 13
the 13
windows 13
for 13
other 13
cars 13
so 13
did 13
gatsbys 13
father 13
and 13
as 13
the 13
time 13
passed 13
and 13
the 13
servants 13
came 13
in 13
and 13
stood 13
waiting 13
in 13
the 13
hall 13
his 13
eyes 13
began 13
to 13
blink 13
anxiously 13
and 13
he 13
spoke 13
of 13
the 13
rain 13
in 13
a 13
worried 13
uncertain 13
way 13
the 13
minister 13
glanced 13
several 13
times 13
at 13
his 13
watch 13
so 13
i 13
took 13
him 13
aside 13
and 13
asked 13
him 13
to 13
wait 13
for 13
half 13
an 13
hour 13
but 13
it 13
wasnt 13
any 13
use 13
nobody 13
came 13
about 13
five 13
oclock 13
our 13
procession 13
of 13
three 13
cars 13
reached 13
the 13
cemetery 13
and 13
stopped 13
in 13
a 13
thick 13
drizzle 13
beside 13
the 13
gatefirst 13
a 13
motor 13
hearse 13
horribly 13
black 13
and 13
wet 13
then 13
mr 13
gatz 13
and 13
the 13
minister 13
and 13
i 13
in 13
the 13
limousine 13
and 13
a 13
little 13
later 13
four 13
or 13
five 13
servants 13
and 13
the 13
postman 13
from 13
west 13
egg 13
in 13
gatsbys 13
station 13
wagon 13
all 13
wet 13
to 13
the 13
skin 13
as 13
we 13
started 13
through 13
the 13
gate 13
into 13
the 13
cemetery 13
i 13
heard 13
a 13
car 13
stop 13
and 13
then 13
the 13
sound 13
of 13
someone 13
splashing 13
after 13
us 13
over 13
the 13
soggy 13
ground 13
i 13
looked 13
around 13
it 13
was 13
the 13
man 13
with 13
owleyed 13
glasses 13
whom 13
i 13
had 13
found 13
marvelling 13
over 13
gatsbys 13
books 13
in 13
the 13
library 13
one 13
night 13
three 13
months 13
before 13
id 13
never 13
seen 13
him 13
since 13
then 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
how 13
he 13
knew 13
about 13
the 13
funeral 13
or 13
even 13
his 13
name 13
the 13
rain 13
poured 13
down 13
his 13
thick 13
glasses 13
and 13
he 13
took 13
them 13
off 13
and 13
wiped 13
them 13
to 13
see 13
the 13
protecting 13
canvas 13
unrolled 13
from 13
gatsbys 13
grave 13
i 13
tried 13
to 13
think 13
about 13
gatsby 13
then 13
for 13
a 13
moment 13
but 13
he 13
was 13
already 13
too 13
far 13
away 13
and 13
i 13
could 13
only 13
remember 13
without 13
resentment 13
that 13
daisy 13
hadnt 13
sent 13
a 13
message 13
or 13
a 13
flower 13
dimly 13
i 13
heard 13
someone 13
murmur 13
blessed 13
are 13
the 13
dead 13
that 13
the 13
rain 13
falls 13
on 13
and 13
then 13
the 13
owleyed 13
man 13
said 13
amen 13
to 13
that 13
in 13
a 13
brave 13
voice 13
we 13
straggled 13
down 13
quickly 13
through 13
the 13
rain 13
to 13
the 13
cars 13
owleyes 13
spoke 13
to 13
me 13
by 13
the 13
gate 13
i 13
couldnt 13
get 13
to 13
the 13
house 13
he 13
remarked 13
neither 13
could 13
anybody 13
else 13
go 13
on 13
he 13
started 13
why 13
my 13
god 13
they 13
used 13
to 13
go 13
there 13
by 13
the 13
hundreds 13
he 13
took 13
off 13
his 13
glasses 13
and 13
wiped 13
them 13
again 13
outside 13
and 13
in 13
the 13
poor 13
sonofabitch 13
he 13
said 13
one 13
of 13
my 13
most 13
vivid 13
memories 13
is 13
of 13
coming 13
back 13
west 13
from 13
prep 13
school 13
and 13
later 13
from 13
college 13
at 13
christmas 13
time 13
those 13
who 13
went 13
farther 13
than 13
chicago 13
would 13
gather 13
in 13
the 13
old 13
dim 13
union 13
station 13
at 13
six 13
oclock 13
of 13
a 13
december 13
evening 13
with 13
a 13
few 13
chicago 13
friends 13
already 13
caught 13
up 13
into 13
their 13
own 13
holiday 13
gayeties 13
to 13
bid 13
them 13
a 13
hasty 13
goodby 13
i 13
remember 13
the 13
fur 13
coats 13
of 13
the 13
girls 13
returning 13
from 13
miss 13
thisorthats 13
and 13
the 13
chatter 13
of 13
frozen 13
breath 13
and 13
the 13
hands 13
waving 13
overhead 13
as 13
we 13
caught 13
sight 13
of 13
old 13
acquaintances 13
and 13
the 13
matchings 13
of 13
invitations 13
are 13
you 13
going 13
to 13
the 13
ordways 13
the 13
herseys 13
the 13
schultzes 13
and 13
the 13
long 13
green 13
tickets 13
clasped 13
tight 13
in 13
our 13
gloved 13
hands 13
and 13
last 13
the 13
murky 13
yellow 13
cars 13
of 13
the 13
chicago 13
milwaukee 13
and 13
st 13
paul 13
railroad 13
looking 13
cheerful 13
as 13
christmas 13
itself 13
on 13
the 13
tracks 13
beside 13
the 13
gate 13
when 13
we 13
pulled 13
out 13
into 13
the 13
winter 13
night 13
and 13
the 13
real 13
snow 13
our 13
snow 13
began 13
to 13
stretch 13
out 13
beside 13
us 13
and 13
twinkle 13
against 13
the 13
windows 13
and 13
the 13
dim 13
lights 13
of 13
small 13
wisconsin 13
stations 13
moved 13
by 13
a 13
sharp 13
wild 13
brace 13
came 13
suddenly 13
into 13
the 13
air 13
we 13
drew 13
in 13
deep 13
breaths 13
of 13
it 13
as 13
we 13
walked 13
back 13
from 13
dinner 13
through 13
the 13
cold 13
vestibules 13
unutterably 13
aware 13
of 13
our 13
identity 13
with 13
this 13
country 13
for 13
one 13
strange 13
hour 13
before 13
we 13
melted 13
indistinguishably 13
into 13
it 13
again 13
thats 13
my 13
middle 13
westnot 13
the 13
wheat 13
or 13
the 13
prairies 13
or 13
the 13
lost 13
swede 13
towns 13
but 13
the 13
thrilling 13
returning 13
trains 13
of 13
my 13
youth 13
and 13
the 13
street 13
lamps 13
and 13
sleigh 13
bells 13
in 13
the 13
frosty 13
dark 13
and 13
the 13
shadows 13
of 13
holly 13
wreaths 13
thrown 13
by 13
lighted 13
windows 13
on 13
the 13
snow 13
i 13
am 13
part 13
of 13
that 13
a 13
little 13
solemn 13
with 13
the 13
feel 13
of 13
those 13
long 13
winters 13
a 13
little 13
complacent 13
from 13
growing 13
up 13
in 13
the 13
carraway 13
house 13
in 13
a 13
city 13
where 13
dwellings 13
are 13
still 13
called 13
through 13
decades 13
by 13
a 13
familys 13
name 13
i 13
see 13
now 13
that 13
this 13
has 13
been 13
a 13
story 13
of 13
the 13
west 13
after 13
alltom 13
and 13
gatsby 13
daisy 13
and 13
jordan 13
and 13
i 13
were 13
all 13
westerners 13
and 13
perhaps 13
we 13
possessed 13
some 13
deficiency 13
in 13
common 13
which 13
made 13
us 13
subtly 13
unadaptable 13
to 13
eastern 13
life 13
even 13
when 13
the 13
east 13
excited 13
me 13
most 13
even 13
when 13
i 13
was 13
most 13
keenly 13
aware 13
of 13
its 13
superiority 13
to 13
the 13
bored 13
sprawling 13
swollen 13
towns 13
beyond 13
the 13
ohio 13
with 13
their 13
interminable 13
inquisitions 13
which 13
spared 13
only 13
the 13
children 13
and 13
the 13
very 13
oldeven 13
then 13
it 13
had 13
always 13
for 13
me 13
a 13
quality 13
of 13
distortion 13
west 13
egg 13
especially 13
still 13
figures 13
in 13
my 13
more 13
fantastic 13
dreams 13
i 13
see 13
it 13
as 13
a 13
night 13
scene 13
by 13
el 13
greco 13
a 13
hundred 13
houses 13
at 13
once 13
conventional 13
and 13
grotesque 13
crouching 13
under 13
a 13
sullen 13
overhanging 13
sky 13
and 13
a 13
lustreless 13
moon 13
in 13
the 13
foreground 13
four 13
solemn 13
men 13
in 13
dress 13
suits 13
are 13
walking 13
along 13
the 13
sidewalk 13
with 13
a 13
stretcher 13
on 13
which 13
lies 13
a 13
drunken 13
woman 13
in 13
a 13
white 13
evening 13
dress 13
her 13
hand 13
which 13
dangles 13
over 13
the 13
side 13
sparkles 13
cold 13
with 13
jewels 13
gravely 13
the 13
men 13
turn 13
in 13
at 13
a 13
housethe 13
wrong 13
house 13
but 13
no 13
one 13
knows 13
the 13
womans 13
name 13
and 13
no 13
one 13
cares 13
after 13
gatsbys 13
death 13
the 13
east 13
was 13
haunted 13
for 13
me 13
like 13
that 13
distorted 13
beyond 13
my 13
eyes 13
power 13
of 13
correction 13
so 13
when 13
the 13
blue 13
smoke 13
of 13
brittle 13
leaves 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
air 13
and 13
the 13
wind 13
blew 13
the 13
wet 13
laundry 13
stiff 13
on 13
the 13
line 13
i 13
decided 13
to 13
come 13
back 13
home 13
there 13
was 13
one 13
thing 13
to 13
be 13
done 13
before 13
i 13
left 13
an 13
awkward 13
unpleasant 13
thing 13
that 13
perhaps 13
had 13
better 13
have 13
been 13
let 13
alone 13
but 13
i 13
wanted 13
to 13
leave 13
things 13
in 13
order 13
and 13
not 13
just 13
trust 13
that 13
obliging 13
and 13
indifferent 13
sea 13
to 13
sweep 13
my 13
refuse 13
away 13
i 13
saw 13
jordan 13
baker 13
and 13
talked 13
over 13
and 13
around 13
what 13
had 13
happened 13
to 13
us 13
together 13
and 13
what 13
had 13
happened 13
afterward 13
to 13
me 13
and 13
she 13
lay 13
perfectly 13
still 13
listening 13
in 13
a 13
big 13
chair 13
she 13
was 13
dressed 13
to 13
play 13
golf 13
and 13
i 13
remember 13
thinking 13
she 13
looked 13
like 13
a 13
good 13
illustration 13
her 13
chin 13
raised 13
a 13
little 13
jauntily 13
her 13
hair 13
the 13
color 13
of 13
an 13
autumn 13
leaf 13
her 13
face 13
the 13
same 13
brown 13
tint 13
as 13
the 13
fingerless 13
glove 13
on 13
her 13
knee 13
when 13
i 13
had 13
finished 13
she 13
told 13
me 13
without 13
comment 13
that 13
she 13
was 13
engaged 13
to 13
another 13
man 13
i 13
doubted 13
that 13
though 13
there 13
were 13
several 13
she 13
could 13
have 13
married 13
at 13
a 13
nod 13
of 13
her 13
head 13
but 13
i 13
pretended 13
to 13
be 13
surprised 13
for 13
just 13
a 13
minute 13
i 13
wondered 13
if 13
i 13
wasnt 13
making 13
a 13
mistake 13
then 13
i 13
thought 13
it 13
all 13
over 13
again 13
quickly 13
and 13
got 13
up 13
to 13
say 13
goodbye 13
nevertheless 13
you 13
did 13
throw 13
me 13
over 13
said 13
jordan 13
suddenly 13
you 13
threw 13
me 13
over 13
on 13
the 13
telephone 13
i 13
dont 13
give 13
a 13
damn 13
about 13
you 13
now 13
but 13
it 13
was 13
a 13
new 13
experience 13
for 13
me 13
and 13
i 13
felt 13
a 13
little 13
dizzy 13
for 13
a 13
while 13
we 13
shook 13
hands 13
oh 13
and 13
do 13
you 13
remembershe 13
added 13
a 13
conversation 13
we 13
had 13
once 13
about 13
driving 13
a 13
car 13
whynot 13
exactly 13
you 13
said 13
a 13
bad 13
driver 13
was 13
only 13
safe 13
until 13
she 13
met 13
another 13
bad 13
driver 13
well 13
i 13
met 13
another 13
bad 13
driver 13
didnt 13
i 13
i 13
mean 13
it 13
was 13
careless 13
of 13
me 13
to 13
make 13
such 13
a 13
wrong 13
guess 13
i 13
thought 13
you 13
were 13
rather 13
an 13
honest 13
straightforward 13
person 13
i 13
thought 13
it 13
was 13
your 13
secret 13
pride 13
im 13
thirty 13
i 13
said 13
im 13
five 13
years 13
too 13
old 13
to 13
lie 13
to 13
myself 13
and 13
call 13
it 13
honor 13
she 13
didnt 13
answer 13
angry 13
and 13
half 13
in 13
love 13
with 13
her 13
and 13
tremendously 13
sorry 13
i 13
turned 13
away 13
one 13
afternoon 13
late 13
in 13
october 13
i 13
saw 13
tom 13
buchanan 13
he 13
was 13
walking 13
ahead 13
of 13
me 13
along 13
fifth 13
avenue 13
in 13
his 13
alert 13
aggressive 13
way 13
his 13
hands 13
out 13
a 13
little 13
from 13
his 13
body 13
as 13
if 13
to 13
fight 13
off 13
interference 13
his 13
head 13
moving 13
sharply 13
here 13
and 13
there 13
adapting 13
itself 13
to 13
his 13
restless 13
eyes 13
just 13
as 13
i 13
slowed 13
up 13
to 13
avoid 13
overtaking 13
him 13
he 13
stopped 13
and 13
began 13
frowning 13
into 13
the 13
windows 13
of 13
a 13
jewelry 13
store 13
suddenly 13
he 13
saw 13
me 13
and 13
walked 13
back 13
holding 13
out 13
his 13
hand 13
whats 13
the 13
matter 13
nick 13
do 13
you 13
object 13
to 13
shaking 13
hands 13
with 13
me 13
yes 13
you 13
know 13
what 13
i 13
think 13
of 13
you 13
youre 13
crazy 13
nick 13
he 13
said 13
quickly 13
crazy 13
as 13
hell 13
i 13
dont 13
know 13
whats 13
the 13
matter 13
with 13
you 13
tom 13
i 13
inquired 13
what 13
did 13
you 13
say 13
to 13
wilson 13
that 13
afternoon 13
he 13
stared 13
at 13
me 13
without 13
a 13
word 13
and 13
i 13
knew 13
i 13
had 13
guessed 13
right 13
about 13
those 13
missing 13
hours 13
i 13
started 13
to 13
turn 13
away 13
but 13
he 13
took 13
a 13
step 13
after 13
me 13
and 13
grabbed 13
my 13
arm 13
i 13
told 13
him 13
the 13
truth 13
he 13
said 13
he 13
came 13
to 13
the 13
door 13
while 13
we 13
were 13
getting 13
ready 13
to 13
leave 13
and 13
when 13
i 13
sent 13
down 13
word 13
that 13
we 13
werent 13
in 13
he 13
tried 13
to 13
force 13
his 13
way 13
upstairs 13
he 13
was 13
crazy 13
enough 13
to 13
kill 13
me 13
if 13
i 13
hadnt 13
told 13
him 13
who 13
owned 13
the 13
car 13
his 13
hand 13
was 13
on 13
a 13
revolver 13
in 13
his 13
pocket 13
every 13
minute 13
he 13
was 13
in 13
the 13
house 13
he 13
broke 13
off 13
defiantly 13
what 13
if 13
i 13
did 13
tell 13
him 13
that 13
fellow 13
had 13
it 13
coming 13
to 13
him 13
he 13
threw 13
dust 13
into 13
your 13
eyes 13
just 13
like 13
he 13
did 13
in 13
daisys 13
but 13
he 13
was 13
a 13
tough 13
one 13
he 13
ran 13
over 13
myrtle 13
like 13
youd 13
run 13
over 13
a 13
dog 13
and 13
never 13
even 13
stopped 13
his 13
car 13
there 13
was 13
nothing 13
i 13
could 13
say 13
except 13
the 13
one 13
unutterable 13
fact 13
that 13
it 13
wasnt 13
true 13
and 13
if 13
you 13
think 13
i 13
didnt 13
have 13
my 13
share 13
of 13
sufferinglook 13
here 13
when 13
i 13
went 13
to 13
give 13
up 13
that 13
flat 13
and 13
saw 13
that 13
damn 13
box 13
of 13
dog 13
biscuits 13
sitting 13
there 13
on 13
the 13
sideboard 13
i 13
sat 13
down 13
and 13
cried 13
like 13
a 13
baby 13
by 13
god 13
it 13
was 13
awful 13
i 13
couldnt 13
forgive 13
him 13
or 13
like 13
him 13
but 13
i 13
saw 13
that 13
what 13
he 13
had 13
done 13
was 13
to 13
him 13
entirely 13
justified 13
it 13
was 13
all 13
very 13
careless 13
and 13
confused 13
they 13
were 13
careless 13
people 13
tom 13
and 13
daisythey 13
smashed 13
up 13
things 13
and 13
creatures 13
and 13
then 13
retreated 13
back 13
into 13
their 13
money 13
or 13
their 13
vast 13
carelessness 13
or 13
whatever 13
it 13
was 13
that 13
kept 13
them 13
together 13
and 13
let 13
other 13
people 13
clean 13
up 13
the 13
mess 13
they 13
had 13
made 13
i 13
shook 13
hands 13
with 13
him 13
it 13
seemed 13
silly 13
not 13
to 13
for 13
i 13
felt 13
suddenly 13
as 13
though 13
i 13
were 13
talking 13
to 13
a 13
child 13
then 13
he 13
went 13
into 13
the 13
jewelry 13
store 13
to 13
buy 13
a 13
pearl 13
necklaceor 13
perhaps 13
only 13
a 13
pair 13
of 13
cuff 13
buttonsrid 13
of 13
my 13
provincial 13
squeamishness 13
forever 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
was 13
still 13
empty 13
when 13
i 13
leftthe 13
grass 13
on 13
his 13
lawn 13
had 13
grown 13
as 13
long 13
as 13
mine 13
one 13
of 13
the 13
taxi 13
drivers 13
in 13
the 13
village 13
never 13
took 13
a 13
fare 13
past 13
the 13
entrance 13
gate 13
without 13
stopping 13
for 13
a 13
minute 13
and 13
pointing 13
inside 13
perhaps 13
it 13
was 13
he 13
who 13
drove 13
daisy 13
and 13
gatsby 13
over 13
to 13
east 13
egg 13
the 13
night 13
of 13
the 13
accident 13
and 13
perhaps 13
he 13
had 13
made 13
a 13
story 13
about 13
it 13
all 13
his 13
own 13
i 13
didnt 13
want 13
to 13
hear 13
it 13
and 13
i 13
avoided 13
him 13
when 13
i 13
got 13
off 13
the 13
train 13
i 13
spent 13
my 13
saturday 13
nights 13
in 13
new 13
york 13
because 13
those 13
gleaming 13
dazzling 13
parties 13
of 13
his 13
were 13
with 13
me 13
so 13
vividly 13
that 13
i 13
could 13
still 13
hear 13
the 13
music 13
and 13
the 13
laughter 13
faint 13
and 13
incessant 13
from 13
his 13
garden 13
and 13
the 13
cars 13
going 13
up 13
and 13
down 13
his 13
drive 13
one 13
night 13
i 13
did 13
hear 13
a 13
material 13
car 13
there 13
and 13
saw 13
its 13
lights 13
stop 13
at 13
his 13
front 13
steps 13
but 13
i 13
didnt 13
investigate 13
probably 13
it 13
was 13
some 13
final 13
guest 13
who 13
had 13
been 13
away 13
at 13
the 13
ends 13
of 13
the 13
earth 13
and 13
didnt 13
know 13
that 13
the 13
party 13
was 13
over 13
on 13
the 13
last 13
night 13
with 13
my 13
trunk 13
packed 13
and 13
my 13
car 13
sold 13
to 13
the 13
grocer 13
i 13
went 13
over 13
and 13
looked 13
at 13
that 13
huge 13
incoherent 13
failure 13
of 13
a 13
house 13
once 13
more 13
on 13
the 13
white 13
steps 13
an 13
obscene 13
word 13
scrawled 13
by 13
some 13
boy 13
with 13
a 13
piece 13
of 13
brick 13
stood 13
out 13
clearly 13
in 13
the 13
moonlight 13
and 13
i 13
erased 13
it 13
drawing 13
my 13
shoe 13
raspingly 13
along 13
the 13
stone 13
then 13
i 13
wandered 13
down 13
to 13
the 13
beach 13
and 13
sprawled 13
out 13
on 13
the 13
sand 13
most 13
of 13
the 13
big 13
shore 13
places 13
were 13
closed 13
now 13
and 13
there 13
were 13
hardly 13
any 13
lights 13
except 13
the 13
shadowy 13
moving 13
glow 13
of 13
a 13
ferryboat 13
across 13
the 13
sound 13
and 13
as 13
the 13
moon 13
rose 13
higher 13
the 13
inessential 13
houses 13
began 13
to 13
melt 13
away 13
until 13
gradually 13
i 13
became 13
aware 13
of 13
the 13
old 13
island 13
here 13
that 13
flowered 13
once 13
for 13
dutch 13
sailors 13
eyesa 13
fresh 13
green 13
breast 13
of 13
the 13
new 13
world 13
its 13
vanished 13
trees 13
the 13
trees 13
that 13
had 13
made 13
way 13
for 13
gatsbys 13
house 13
had 13
once 13
pandered 13
in 13
whispers 13
to 13
the 13
last 13
and 13
greatest 13
of 13
all 13
human 13
dreams 13
for 13
a 13
transitory 13
enchanted 13
moment 13
man 13
must 13
have 13
held 13
his 13
breath 13
in 13
the 13
presence 13
of 13
this 13
continent 13
compelled 13
into 13
an 13
aesthetic 13
contemplation 13
he 13
neither 13
understood 13
nor 13
desired 13
face 13
to 13
face 13
for 13
the 13
last 13
time 13
in 13
history 13
with 13
something 13
commensurate 13
to 13
his 13
capacity 13
for 13
wonder 13
and 13
as 13
i 13
sat 13
there 13
brooding 13
on 13
the 13
old 13
unknown 13
world 13
i 13
thought 13
of 13
gatsbys 13
wonder 13
when 13
he 13
first 13
picked 13
out 13
the 13
green 13
light 13
at 13
the 13
end 13
of 13
daisys 13
dock 13
he 13
had 13
come 13
a 13
long 13
way 13
to 13
this 13
blue 13
lawn 13
and 13
his 13
dream 13
must 13
have 13
seemed 13
so 13
close 13
that 13
he 13
could 13
hardly 13
fail 13
to 13
grasp 13
it 13
he 13
did 13
not 13
know 13
that 13
it 13
was 13
already 13
behind 13
him 13
somewhere 13
back 13
in 13
that 13
vast 13
obscurity 13
beyond 13
the 13
city 13
where 13
the 13
dark 13
fields 13
of 13
the 13
republic 13
rolled 13
on 13
