ancient 14
greek 14
philosophy 14
was 14
divided 14
into 14
three 14
sciences 14
physics 14
ethics 14
and 14
logic 14
this 14
division 14
is 14
perfectly 14
suitable 14
to 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
thing 14
and 14
the 14
only 14
improvement 14
that 14
can 14
be 14
made 14
in 14
it 14
is 14
to 14
add 14
the 14
principle 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
based 14
so 14
that 14
we 14
may 14
both 14
satisfy 14
ourselves 14
of 14
its 14
completeness 14
and 14
also 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
determine 14
correctly 14
the 14
necessary 14
subdivisions 14
all 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
is 14
either 14
material 14
or 14
formal 14
the 14
former 14
considers 14
some 14
object 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
concerned 14
only 14
with 14
the 14
form 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
and 14
of 14
the 14
reason 14
itself 14
and 14
with 14
the 14
universal 14
laws 14
of 14
thought 14
in 14
general 14
without 14
distinction 14
of 14
its 14
objects 14
formal 14
philosophy 14
is 14
called 14
logic 14
material 14
philosophy 14
however 14
has 14
to 14
do 14
with 14
determinate 14
objects 14
and 14
the 14
laws 14
to 14
which 14
they 14
are 14
subject 14
is 14
again 14
twofold 14
for 14
these 14
laws 14
are 14
either 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
or 14
of 14
freedom 14
the 14
science 14
of 14
the 14
former 14

latter 14

they 14
are 14
also 14
called 14
natural 14
philosophy 14
and 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
respectively 14
logic 14
cannot 14
have 14
any 14
empirical 14
part 14
that 14
is 14
a 14
part 14
in 14
which 14
the 14
universal 14
and 14
necessary 14
laws 14
of 14
thought 14
should 14
rest 14
on 14
grounds 14
taken 14
from 14
experience 14
otherwise 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
logic 14
ie 14
a 14
canon 14
for 14
the 14
understanding 14
or 14
the 14
reason 14
valid 14
for 14
all 14
thought 14
and 14
capable 14
of 14
demonstration 14
natural 14
and 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
can 14
each 14
have 14
their 14
empirical 14
part 14
since 14
the 14
former 14
has 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
as 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
experience 14
the 14
latter 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
human 14
will 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
affected 14
by 14
nature 14
the 14
former 14
however 14
being 14
laws 14
according 14
to 14
which 14
everything 14
does 14
happen 14
the 14
latter 14
laws 14
according 14
to 14
which 14
everything 14
ought 14
to 14
happen 14
ethics 14
however 14
must 14
also 14
consider 14
the 14
conditions 14
under 14
which 14
what 14
ought 14
to 14
happen 14
frequently 14
does 14
not 14
we 14
may 14
call 14
all 14
philosophy 14
empirical 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
based 14
on 14
grounds 14
of 14
experience 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
band 14
that 14
which 14
delivers 14
its 14
doctrines 14
from 14
a 14
priori 14
principles 14
alone 14
we 14
may 14
call 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
when 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
merely 14
formal 14
it 14
is 14
logic 14
if 14
it 14
is 14
restricted 14
to 14
definite 14
objects 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
it 14
is 14
metaphysic 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
there 14
arises 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
twofold 14
metaphysic 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
physics 14
will 14
thus 14
have 14
an 14
empirical 14
and 14
also 14
a 14
rational 14
part 14
it 14
is 14
the 14
same 14
with 14
ethics 14
but 14
here 14
the 14
empirical 14
part 14
might 14
have 14
the 14
special 14
name 14
of 14
practical 14
anthropology 14
the 14
name 14
morality 14
being 14
appropriated 14
to 14
the 14
rational 14
part 14
all 14
trades 14
arts 14
and 14
handiworks 14
have 14
gained 14
by 14
division 14
of 14
labour 14
namely 14
when 14
instead 14
of 14
one 14
man 14
doing 14
everything 14
each 14
confines 14
himself 14
to 14
a 14
certain 14
kind 14
of 14
work 14
distinct 14
from 14
others 14
in 14
the 14
treatment 14
it 14
requires 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
perform 14
it 14
with 14
greater 14
facility 14
and 14
in 14
the 14
greatest 14
perfection 14
where 14
the 14
different 14
kinds 14
of 14
work 14
are 14
not 14
distinguished 14
and 14
divided 14
where 14
everyone 14
is 14
a 14
jackofalltrades 14
there 14
manufactures 14
remain 14
still 14
in 14
the 14
greatest 14
barbarism 14
it 14
might 14
deserve 14
to 14
be 14
considered 14
whether 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
in 14
all 14
its 14
parts 14
does 14
not 14
require 14
a 14
man 14
specially 14
devoted 14
to 14
it 14
and 14
whether 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
better 14
for 14
the 14
whole 14
business 14
of 14
science 14
if 14
those 14
who 14
to 14
please 14
the 14
tastes 14
of 14
the 14
public 14
are 14
wont 14
to 14
blend 14
the 14
rational 14
and 14
empirical 14
elements 14
together 14
mixed 14
in 14
all 14
sorts 14
of 14
proportions 14
unknown 14
to 14
themselves 14
and 14
who 14
call 14
themselves 14
independent 14
thinkers 14
giving 14
the 14
name 14
of 14
minute 14
philosophers 14
to 14
those 14
who 14
apply 14
themselves 14
to 14
the 14
rational 14
part 14
only 14
if 14
these 14
i 14
say 14
were 14
warned 14
not 14
to 14
carry 14
on 14
two 14
employments 14
together 14
which 14
differ 14
widely 14
in 14
the 14
treatment 14
they 14
demand 14
for 14
each 14
of 14
which 14
perhaps 14
a 14
special 14
talent 14
is 14
required 14
and 14
the 14
combination 14
of 14
which 14
in 14
one 14
person 14
only 14
produces 14
bunglers 14
but 14
i 14
only 14
ask 14
here 14
whether 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
science 14
does 14
not 14
require 14
that 14
we 14
should 14
always 14
carefully 14
separate 14
the 14
empirical 14
from 14
the 14
rational 14
part 14
and 14
prefix 14
to 14
physics 14
proper 14
or 14
empirical 14
physics 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
to 14
practical 14
anthropology 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
which 14
must 14
be 14
carefully 14
cleared 14
of 14
everything 14
empirical 14
so 14
that 14
we 14
may 14
know 14
how 14
much 14
can 14
be 14
accomplished 14
by 14
pure 14
reason 14
in 14
both 14
cases 14
and 14
from 14
what 14
sources 14
it 14
draws 14
this 14
its 14
a 14
priori 14
teaching 14
and 14
that 14
whether 14
the 14
latter 14
inquiry 14
is 14
conducted 14
by 14
all 14
moralists 14
whose 14
name 14
is 14
legion 14
or 14
only 14
by 14
some 14
who 14
feel 14
a 14
calling 14
thereto 14
as 14
my 14
concern 14
here 14
is 14
with 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
i 14
limit 14
the 14
question 14
suggested 14
to 14
this 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
of 14
the 14
utmost 14
necessity 14
to 14
construct 14
a 14
pure 14
thing 14
which 14
is 14
only 14
empirical 14
and 14
which 14
belongs 14
to 14
anthropology 14
for 14
that 14
such 14
a 14
philosophy 14
must 14
be 14
possible 14
is 14
evident 14
from 14
the 14
common 14
idea 14
of 14
duty 14
and 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
laws 14
everyone 14
must 14
admit 14
that 14
if 14
a 14
law 14
is 14
to 14
have 14
moral 14
force 14
ie 14
to 14
be 14
the 14
basis 14
of 14
an 14
obligation 14
it 14
must 14
carry 14
with 14
it 14
absolute 14
necessity 14
that 14
for 14
example 14
the 14
precept 14
thou 14
shalt 14
not 14
lie 14
is 14
not 14
valid 14
for 14
men 14
alone 14
as 14
if 14
other 14
rational 14
beings 14
had 14
no 14
need 14
to 14
observe 14
it 14
and 14
so 14
with 14
all 14
the 14
other 14
moral 14
laws 14
properly 14
so 14
called 14
that 14
therefore 14
the 14
basis 14
of 14
obligation 14
must 14
not 14
be 14
sought 14
in 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
man 14
or 14
in 14
the 14
circumstances 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
in 14
which 14
he 14
is 14
placed 14
but 14
a 14
priori 14
simply 14
in 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
pure 14
reason 14
and 14
although 14
any 14
other 14
precept 14
which 14
is 14
founded 14
on 14
principles 14
of 14
mere 14
experience 14
may 14
be 14
in 14
certain 14
respects 14
universal 14
yet 14
in 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
rests 14
even 14
in 14
the 14
least 14
degree 14
on 14
an 14
empirical 14
basis 14
perhaps 14
only 14
as 14
to 14
a 14
motive 14
such 14
a 14
precept 14
while 14
it 14
may 14
be 14
a 14
practical 14
rule 14
can 14
never 14
be 14
called 14
a 14
moral 14
law 14
thus 14
not 14
only 14
are 14
moral 14
laws 14
with 14
their 14
principles 14
essentially 14
distinguished 14
from 14
every 14
other 14
kind 14
of 14
practical 14
knowledge 14
in 14
which 14
there 14
is 14
anything 14
empirical 14
but 14
all 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
rests 14
wholly 14
on 14
its 14
pure 14
part 14
when 14
applied 14
to 14
man 14
it 14
does 14
not 14
borrow 14
the 14
least 14
thing 14
from 14
the 14
knowledge 14
of 14
man 14
himself 14
anthropology 14
but 14
gives 14
laws 14
a 14
priori 14
to 14
him 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
no 14
doubt 14
these 14
laws 14
require 14
a 14
judgement 14
sharpened 14
by 14
experience 14
in 14
order 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
hand 14
to 14
distinguish 14
in 14
what 14
cases 14
they 14
are 14
applicable 14
and 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
to 14
procure 14
for 14
them 14
access 14
to 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
the 14
man 14
and 14
effectual 14
influence 14
on 14
conduct 14
since 14
man 14
is 14
acted 14
on 14
by 14
so 14
many 14
inclinations 14
that 14
though 14
capable 14
of 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
practical 14
pure 14
reason 14
he 14
is 14
not 14
so 14
easily 14
able 14
to 14
make 14
it 14
effective 14
in 14
concreto 14
in 14
his 14
life 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
is 14
therefore 14
indispensably 14
necessary 14
not 14
merely 14
for 14
speculative 14
reasons 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
investigate 14
the 14
sources 14
of 14
the 14
practical 14
principles 14
which 14
are 14
to 14
be 14
found 14
a 14
priori 14
in 14
our 14
reason 14
but 14
also 14
because 14
morals 14
themselves 14
are 14
liable 14
to 14
all 14
sorts 14
of 14
corruption 14
as 14
long 14
as 14
we 14
are 14
without 14
that 14
clue 14
and 14
supreme 14
canon 14
by 14
which 14
to 14
estimate 14
them 14
correctly 14
for 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
an 14
action 14
should 14
be 14
morally 14
good 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
that 14
it 14
conform 14
to 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
but 14
it 14
must 14
also 14
be 14
done 14
for 14
the 14
sake 14
of 14
the 14
law 14
otherwise 14
that 14
conformity 14
is 14
only 14
very 14
contingent 14
and 14
uncertain 14
since 14
a 14
principle 14
which 14
is 14
not 14
moral 14
although 14
it 14
may 14
now 14
and 14
then 14
produce 14
actions 14
conformable 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
will 14
also 14
often 14
produce 14
actions 14
which 14
contradict 14
it 14
now 14
it 14
is 14
only 14
a 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
that 14
we 14
can 14
look 14
for 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
in 14
its 14
purity 14
and 14
genuineness 14
and 14
in 14
a 14
practical 14
matter 14
this 14
is 14
of 14
the 14
utmost 14
consequence 14
we 14
must 14
therefore 14
begin 14
with 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
metaphysic 14
and 14
without 14
it 14
there 14
cannot 14
be 14
any 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
at 14
all 14
that 14
which 14
mingles 14
these 14
pure 14
principles 14
with 14
the 14
empirical 14
does 14
not 14
deserve 14
the 14
name 14
of 14
philosophy 14
for 14
what 14
distinguishes 14
philosophy 14
from 14
common 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
is 14
that 14
it 14
treats 14
in 14
separate 14
sciences 14
what 14
the 14
latter 14
only 14
comprehends 14
confusedly 14
much 14
less 14
does 14
it 14
deserve 14
that 14
of 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
since 14
by 14
this 14
confusion 14
it 14
even 14
spoils 14
the 14
purity 14
of 14
morals 14
themselves 14
and 14
counteracts 14
its 14
own 14
end 14
let 14
it 14
not 14
be 14
thought 14
however 14
that 14
what 14
is 14
here 14
demanded 14
is 14
already 14
extant 14
in 14
the 14
propaedeutic 14
prefixed 14
by 14
the 14
celebrated 14
wolf 14
to 14
his 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
namely 14
his 14
socalled 14
general 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
and 14
that 14
therefore 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
to 14
strike 14
into 14
an 14
entirely 14
new 14
field 14
just 14
because 14
it 14
was 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
general 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
it 14
has 14
not 14
taken 14
into 14
consideration 14
a 14
will 14
of 14
any 14
particular 14
kind 14
say 14
one 14
which 14
should 14
be 14
determined 14
solely 14
from 14
a 14
priori 14
principles 14
without 14
any 14
empirical 14
motives 14
and 14
which 14
we 14
might 14
call 14
a 14
pure 14
will 14
but 14
volition 14
in 14
general 14
with 14
all 14
the 14
actions 14
and 14
conditions 14
which 14
belong 14
to 14
it 14
in 14
this 14
general 14
signification 14
by 14
this 14
it 14
is 14
distinguished 14
from 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
just 14
as 14
general 14
logic 14
which 14
treats 14
of 14
the 14
acts 14
and 14
canons 14
of 14
thought 14
in 14
general 14
is 14
distinguished 14
from 14
transcendental 14
philosophy 14
which 14
treats 14
of 14
the 14
particular 14
acts 14
and 14
canons 14
of 14
pure 14
thought 14
ie 14
that 14
whose 14
cognitions 14
are 14
altogether 14
a 14
priori 14
for 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
has 14
to 14
examine 14
the 14
idea 14
and 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
a 14
possible 14
pure 14
will 14
and 14
not 14
the 14
acts 14
and 14
conditions 14
of 14
human 14
volition 14
generally 14
which 14
for 14
the 14
most 14
part 14
are 14
drawn 14
from 14
psychology 14
it 14
is 14
true 14
that 14
moral 14
laws 14
and 14
duty 14
are 14
spoken 14
of 14
in 14
the 14
general 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
contrary 14
indeed 14
to 14
all 14
fitness 14
but 14
this 14
is 14
no 14
objection 14
for 14
in 14
this 14
respect 14
also 14
the 14
authors 14
of 14
that 14
science 14
remain 14
true 14
to 14
their 14
idea 14
of 14
it 14
they 14
do 14
not 14
distinguish 14
the 14
motives 14
which 14
are 14
prescribed 14
as 14
such 14
by 14
reason 14
alone 14
altogether 14
a 14
priori 14
and 14
which 14
are 14
properly 14
moral 14
from 14
the 14
empirical 14
motives 14
which 14
the 14
understanding 14
raises 14
to 14
general 14
conceptions 14
merely 14
by 14
comparison 14
of 14
experiences 14
but 14
without 14
noticing 14
the 14
difference 14
of 14
their 14
sources 14
and 14
looking 14
on 14
them 14
all 14
as 14
homogeneous 14
they 14
consider 14
only 14
their 14
greater 14
or 14
less 14
amount 14
it 14
is 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
they 14
frame 14
their 14
notion 14
of 14
obligation 14
which 14
though 14
anything 14
but 14
moral 14
is 14
all 14
that 14
can 14
be 14
attained 14
in 14
a 14
philosophy 14
which 14
passes 14
no 14
judgement 14
at 14
all 14
on 14
the 14
origin 14
of 14
all 14
possible 14
practical 14
concepts 14
whether 14
they 14
are 14
a 14
priori 14
or 14
only 14
a 14
posteriori 14
intending 14
to 14
publish 14
hereafter 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
i 14
issue 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
instance 14
these 14
fundamental 14
principles 14
indeed 14
there 14
is 14
properly 14
no 14
other 14
foundation 14
for 14
it 14
than 14
the 14
critical 14
examination 14
of 14
a 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
just 14
as 14
that 14
of 14
metaphysics 14
is 14
the 14
critical 14
examination 14
of 14
the 14
pure 14
speculative 14
reason 14
already 14
published 14
but 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
place 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
not 14
so 14
absolutely 14
necessary 14
as 14
the 14
latter 14
because 14
in 14
moral 14
concerns 14
human 14
reason 14
can 14
easily 14
be 14
brought 14
to 14
a 14
high 14
degree 14
of 14
correctness 14
and 14
completeness 14
even 14
in 14
the 14
commonest 14
understanding 14
while 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
in 14
its 14
theoretic 14
but 14
pure 14
use 14
it 14
is 14
wholly 14
dialectical 14
and 14
in 14
the 14
second 14
place 14
if 14
the 14
critique 14
of 14
a 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
complete 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
possible 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
to 14
show 14
its 14
identity 14
with 14
the 14
speculative 14
reason 14
in 14
a 14
common 14
principle 14
for 14
it 14
can 14
ultimately 14
be 14
only 14
one 14
and 14
the 14
same 14
reason 14
which 14
has 14
to 14
be 14
distinguished 14
merely 14
in 14
its 14
application 14
i 14
could 14
not 14
however 14
bring 14
it 14
to 14
such 14
completeness 14
here 14
without 14
introducing 14
considerations 14
of 14
a 14
wholly 14
different 14
kind 14
which 14
would 14
be 14
perplexing 14
to 14
the 14
reader 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
i 14
have 14
adopted 14
the 14
title 14
of 14
fundamental 14
principles 14
of 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
instead 14
of 14
that 14
of 14
a 14
critical 14
examination 14
of 14
the 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
but 14
in 14
the 14
third 14
place 14
since 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
in 14
spite 14
of 14
the 14
discouraging 14
title 14
is 14
yet 14
capable 14
of 14
being 14
presented 14
in 14
popular 14
form 14
and 14
one 14
adapted 14
to 14
the 14
common 14
understanding 14
i 14
find 14
it 14
useful 14
to 14
separate 14
from 14
it 14
this 14
preliminary 14
treatise 14
on 14
its 14
fundamental 14
principles 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
i 14
may 14
not 14
hereafter 14
have 14
need 14
to 14
introduce 14
these 14
necessarily 14
subtle 14
discussions 14
into 14
a 14
book 14
of 14
a 14
more 14
simple 14
character 14
the 14
present 14
treatise 14
is 14
however 14
nothing 14
more 14
than 14
the 14
investigation 14
and 14
establishment 14
of 14
the 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
and 14
this 14
alone 14
constitutes 14
a 14
study 14
complete 14
in 14
itself 14
and 14
one 14
which 14
ought 14
to 14
be 14
kept 14
apart 14
from 14
every 14
other 14
moral 14
investigation 14
no 14
doubt 14
my 14
conclusions 14
on 14
this 14
weighty 14
question 14
which 14
has 14
hitherto 14
been 14
very 14
unsatisfactorily 14
examined 14
would 14
receive 14
much 14
light 14
from 14
the 14
application 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
principle 14
to 14
the 14
whole 14
system 14
and 14
would 14
be 14
greatly 14
confirmed 14
by 14
the 14
adequacy 14
which 14
it 14
exhibits 14
throughout 14
but 14
i 14
must 14
forego 14
this 14
advantage 14
which 14
indeed 14
would 14
be 14
after 14
all 14
more 14
gratifying 14
than 14
useful 14
since 14
the 14
easy 14
applicability 14
of 14
a 14
principle 14
and 14
its 14
apparent 14
adequacy 14
give 14
no 14
very 14
certain 14
proof 14
of 14
its 14
soundness 14
but 14
rather 14
inspire 14
a 14
certain 14
partiality 14
which 14
prevents 14
us 14
from 14
examining 14
and 14
estimating 14
it 14
strictly 14
in 14
itself 14
and 14

are 14
undoubtedly 14

desirable 14

many 14
respects 14
but 14
these 14
gifts 14
of 14

may 14
also 14
become 14

this 14
also 14
to 14
rectify 14
the 14
whole 14
principle 14
of 14
acting 14
and 14
adapt 14
it 14
to 14
its 14
end 14
the 14
sight 14
of 14
a 14
being 14
who 14
is 14
not 14
adorned 14
with 14
a 14
single 14
feature 14
of 14
a 14
pure 14
and 14
good 14
will 14
enjoying 14
unbroken 14
prosperity 14
can 14
never 14
give 14
pleasure 14
to 14
an 14
impartial 14
rational 14
spectator 14
thus 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
appears 14
to 14
constitute 14
the 14
indispensable 14
condition 14
even 14
of 14
being 14
worthy 14
of 14
happiness 14
there 14
are 14
even 14
some 14
qualities 14
which 14
are 14
of 14
service 14
to 14
this 14
good 14
will 14
itself 14
and 14
may 14
facilitate 14
its 14
action 14
yet 14
which 14
have 14
no 14
intrinsic 14
unconditional 14
value 14
but 14
always 14
presuppose 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
and 14
this 14
qualifies 14
the 14
esteem 14
that 14
we 14
justly 14
have 14
for 14
them 14
and 14
does 14
not 14
permit 14
us 14
to 14
regard 14
them 14
as 14
absolutely 14
good 14
moderation 14
in 14
the 14
affections 14
and 14
passions 14
selfcontrol 14
and 14
calm 14
deliberation 14
are 14
not 14
only 14
good 14
in 14
many 14
respects 14
but 14
even 14
seem 14
to 14
constitute 14
part 14
of 14
the 14
intrinsic 14
worth 14
of 14
the 14
person 14
but 14
they 14
are 14
far 14
from 14
deserving 14
to 14
be 14
called 14
good 14
without 14
qualification 14
although 14
they 14
have 14
been 14
so 14
unconditionally 14
praised 14
by 14
the 14
ancients 14
for 14
without 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
they 14
may 14
become 14
extremely 14
bad 14
and 14
the 14
coolness 14
of 14
a 14
villain 14
not 14
only 14
makes 14
him 14
far 14
more 14
dangerous 14
but 14
also 14
directly 14
makes 14
him 14
more 14
abominable 14
in 14
our 14
eyes 14
than 14
he 14
would 14
have 14
been 14
without 14
it 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
is 14
good 14
not 14
because 14
of 14
what 14
it 14
performs 14
or 14
effects 14
not 14
by 14
its 14
aptness 14
for 14
the 14
attainment 14
of 14
some 14
proposed 14
end 14
but 14
simply 14
by 14
virtue 14
of 14
the 14
volition 14
that 14
is 14
it 14
is 14
good 14
in 14
itself 14
and 14
considered 14
by 14
itself 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
esteemed 14
much 14
higher 14
than 14
all 14
that 14
can 14
be 14
brought 14
about 14
by 14
it 14
in 14
favour 14
of 14
any 14
inclination 14
nay 14
even 14
of 14
the 14
sum 14
total 14
of 14
all 14
inclinations 14
even 14
if 14
it 14
should 14
happen 14
that 14
owing 14
to 14
special 14
disfavour 14
of 14
fortune 14
or 14
the 14
niggardly 14
provision 14
of 14
a 14
stepmotherly 14
nature 14
this 14
will 14
should 14
wholly 14
lack 14
power 14
to 14
accomplish 14
its 14
purpose 14
if 14
with 14
its 14
greatest 14
efforts 14
it 14
should 14
yet 14
achieve 14
nothing 14
and 14
there 14
should 14
remain 14
only 14
the 14
good 14
will 14
not 14
to 14
be 14
sure 14
a 14
mere 14
wish 14
but 14
the 14
summoning 14
of 14
all 14
means 14
in 14
our 14
power 14
then 14
like 14
a 14
jewel 14
it 14
would 14
still 14
shine 14
by 14
its 14
own 14
light 14
as 14
a 14
thing 14
which 14
has 14
its 14
whole 14
value 14
in 14
itself 14
its 14
usefulness 14
or 14
fruitfulness 14
can 14
neither 14
add 14
nor 14
take 14
away 14
anything 14
from 14
this 14
value 14
it 14
would 14
be 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
only 14
the 14
setting 14
to 14
enable 14
us 14
to 14
handle 14
it 14
the 14
more 14
conveniently 14
in 14
common 14
commerce 14
or 14
to 14
attract 14
to 14
it 14
the 14
attention 14
of 14
those 14
who 14
are 14
not 14
yet 14
connoisseurs 14
but 14
not 14
to 14
recommend 14
it 14
to 14
true 14
connoisseurs 14
or 14
to 14
determine 14
its 14
value 14
there 14
is 14
however 14
something 14
so 14
strange 14
in 14
this 14
idea 14
of 14
the 14
absolute 14
value 14
of 14
the 14
mere 14
will 14
in 14
which 14
no 14
account 14
is 14
taken 14
of 14
its 14
utility 14
that 14
notwithstanding 14
the 14
thorough 14
assent 14
of 14
even 14
common 14
reason 14
to 14
the 14
idea 14
yet 14
a 14
suspicion 14
must 14
arise 14
that 14
it 14
may 14
perhaps 14
really 14
be 14
the 14
product 14
of 14
mere 14
highflown 14
fancy 14
and 14
that 14
we 14
may 14
have 14
misunderstood 14
the 14
purpose 14
of 14
nature 14
in 14
assigning 14
reason 14
as 14
the 14
governor 14
of 14
our 14
will 14
therefore 14
we 14
will 14
examine 14
this 14
idea 14
from 14
this 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
in 14
the 14
physical 14
constitution 14
of 14
an 14
organized 14
being 14
that 14
is 14
a 14
being 14
adapted 14
suitably 14
to 14
the 14
purposes 14
of 14
life 14
we 14
assume 14
it 14
as 14
a 14
fundamental 14
principle 14
that 14
no 14
organ 14
for 14
any 14
purpose 14
will 14
be 14
found 14
but 14
what 14
is 14
also 14
the 14
fittest 14
and 14
best 14
adapted 14
for 14
that 14
purpose 14
now 14
in 14
a 14
being 14
which 14
has 14
reason 14
and 14
a 14
will 14
if 14
the 14
proper 14
object 14
of 14
nature 14
were 14
its 14
conservation 14
its 14
welfare 14
in 14
a 14
word 14
its 14
happiness 14
then 14
nature 14
would 14
have 14
hit 14
upon 14
a 14
very 14
bad 14
arrangement 14
in 14
selecting 14
the 14
reason 14
of 14
the 14
creature 14
to 14
carry 14
out 14
this 14
purpose 14
for 14
all 14
the 14
actions 14
which 14
the 14
creature 14
has 14
to 14
perform 14
with 14
a 14
view 14
to 14
this 14
purpose 14
and 14
the 14
whole 14
rule 14
of 14
its 14
conduct 14
would 14
be 14
far 14
more 14
surely 14
prescribed 14
to 14
it 14
by 14
instinct 14
and 14
that 14
end 14
would 14
have 14
been 14
attained 14
thereby 14
much 14
more 14
certainly 14
than 14
it 14
ever 14
can 14
be 14
by 14
reason 14
should 14
reason 14
have 14
been 14
communicated 14
to 14
this 14
favoured 14
creature 14
over 14
and 14
above 14
it 14
must 14
only 14
have 14
served 14
it 14
to 14
contemplate 14
the 14
happy 14
constitution 14
of 14
its 14
nature 14
to 14
admire 14
it 14
to 14
congratulate 14
itself 14
thereon 14
and 14
to 14
feel 14
thankful 14
for 14
it 14
to 14
the 14
beneficent 14
cause 14
but 14
not 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
subject 14
its 14
desires 14
to 14
that 14
weak 14
and 14
delusive 14
guidance 14
and 14
meddle 14
bunglingly 14
with 14
the 14
purpose 14
of 14
nature 14
in 14
a 14
word 14
nature 14
would 14
have 14
taken 14
care 14
that 14
reason 14
should 14
not 14
break 14
forth 14
into 14
practical 14
exercise 14
nor 14
have 14
the 14
presumption 14
with 14
its 14
weak 14
insight 14
to 14
think 14
out 14
for 14
itself 14
the 14
plan 14
of 14
happiness 14
and 14
of 14
the 14
means 14
of 14
attaining 14
it 14
nature 14
would 14
not 14
only 14
have 14
taken 14
on 14
herself 14
the 14
choice 14
of 14
the 14
ends 14
but 14
also 14
of 14
the 14
means 14
and 14
with 14
wise 14
foresight 14
would 14
have 14
entrusted 14
both 14
to 14
instinct 14
and 14
in 14
fact 14
we 14
find 14
that 14
the 14
more 14
a 14
cultivated 14
reason 14
applies 14
itself 14
with 14
deliberate 14
purpose 14
to 14
the 14
enjoyment 14
of 14
life 14
and 14
happiness 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
more 14
does 14
the 14
man 14
fail 14
of 14
true 14
satisfaction 14
and 14
from 14
this 14
circumstance 14
there 14
arises 14
in 14
many 14
if 14
they 14
are 14
candid 14
enough 14
to 14
confess 14
it 14
a 14
certain 14
degree 14
of 14
misology 14
that 14
is 14
hatred 14
of 14
reason 14
especially 14
in 14
the 14
case 14
of 14
those 14
who 14
are 14
most 14
experienced 14
in 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
it 14
because 14
after 14
calculating 14
all 14
the 14
advantages 14
they 14
derive 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
say 14
from 14
the 14
invention 14
of 14
all 14
the 14
arts 14
of 14
common 14
luxury 14
but 14
even 14
from 14
the 14
sciences 14
which 14
seem 14
to 14
them 14
to 14
be 14
after 14
all 14
only 14
a 14
luxury 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
they 14
find 14
that 14
they 14
have 14
in 14
fact 14
only 14
brought 14
more 14
trouble 14
on 14
their 14
shoulders 14
rather 14
than 14
gained 14
in 14
happiness 14
and 14
they 14
end 14
by 14
envying 14
rather 14
than 14
despising 14
the 14
more 14
common 14
stamp 14
of 14
men 14
who 14
keep 14
closer 14
to 14
the 14
guidance 14
of 14
mere 14
instinct 14
and 14
do 14
not 14
allow 14
their 14
reason 14
much 14
influence 14
on 14
their 14
conduct 14
and 14
this 14
we 14
must 14
admit 14
that 14
the 14
judgement 14
of 14
those 14
who 14
would 14
very 14
much 14
lower 14
the 14
lofty 14
eulogies 14
of 14
the 14
advantages 14
which 14
reason 14
gives 14
us 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
the 14
happiness 14
and 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
life 14
or 14
who 14
would 14
even 14
reduce 14
them 14
below 14
zero 14
is 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
morose 14
or 14
ungrateful 14
to 14
the 14
goodness 14
with 14
which 14
the 14
world 14
is 14
governed 14
but 14
that 14
there 14
lies 14
at 14
the 14
root 14
of 14
these 14
judgements 14
the 14
idea 14
that 14
our 14
existence 14
has 14
a 14
different 14
and 14
far 14
nobler 14
end 14
for 14
which 14
and 14
not 14
for 14
happiness 14
reason 14
is 14
properly 14
intended 14
and 14
which 14
must 14
therefore 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
the 14
supreme 14
condition 14
to 14
which 14
the 14
private 14
ends 14
of 14
man 14
must 14
for 14
the 14
most 14
part 14
be 14
postponed 14
for 14
as 14
reason 14
is 14
not 14
competent 14
to 14
guide 14
the 14
will 14
with 14
certainty 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
its 14
objects 14
and 14
the 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
all 14
our 14
wants 14
which 14
it 14
to 14
some 14
extent 14
even 14
multiplies 14
this 14
being 14
an 14
end 14
to 14
which 14
an 14
implanted 14
instinct 14
would 14
have 14
led 14
with 14
much 14
greater 14
certainty 14
and 14
since 14
nevertheless 14
reason 14
is 14
imparted 14
to 14
us 14
as 14
a 14
practical 14
faculty 14
ie 14
as 14
one 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
have 14
influence 14
on 14
the 14
will 14
therefore 14
admitting 14
that 14
nature 14
generally 14
in 14
the 14
distribution 14
of 14
her 14
capacities 14
has 14
adapted 14
the 14
means 14
to 14
the 14
end 14
its 14
true 14
destination 14
must 14
be 14
to 14
produce 14
a 14
will 14
not 14
merely 14
good 14
as 14
a 14
means 14
to 14
something 14
else 14
but 14
good 14
in 14
itself 14
for 14
which 14
reason 14
was 14
absolutely 14
necessary 14
this 14
will 14
then 14
though 14
not 14
indeed 14
the 14
sole 14
and 14
complete 14
good 14
must 14
be 14
the 14
supreme 14
good 14
and 14
the 14
condition 14
of 14
every 14
other 14
even 14
of 14
the 14
desire 14
of 14
happiness 14
under 14
these 14
circumstances 14
there 14
is 14
nothing 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
the 14
wisdom 14
of 14
nature 14
in 14
the 14
fact 14
that 14
the 14
cultivation 14
of 14
the 14
reason 14
which 14
is 14
requisite 14
for 14
the 14
first 14
and 14
unconditional 14
purpose 14
does 14
in 14
many 14
ways 14
interfere 14
at 14
least 14
in 14
this 14
life 14
with 14
the 14
attainment 14
of 14
the 14
second 14
which 14
is 14
always 14
conditional 14
namely 14
happiness 14
nay 14
it 14
may 14
even 14
reduce 14
it 14
to 14
nothing 14
without 14
nature 14
thereby 14
failing 14
of 14
her 14
purpose 14
for 14
reason 14
recognizes 14
the 14
establishment 14
of 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
as 14
its 14
highest 14
practical 14
destination 14
and 14
in 14
attaining 14
this 14
purpose 14
is 14
capable 14
only 14
of 14
a 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
its 14
own 14
proper 14
kind 14
namely 14
that 14
from 14
the 14
attainment 14
of 14
an 14
end 14
which 14
end 14
again 14
is 14
determined 14
by 14
reason 14
only 14
notwithstanding 14
that 14
this 14
may 14
involve 14
many 14
a 14
disappointment 14
to 14
the 14
ends 14
of 14
inclination 14
we 14
have 14
then 14
to 14
develop 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
deserves 14
to 14
be 14
highly 14
esteemed 14
for 14
itself 14
and 14
is 14
good 14
without 14
a 14
view 14
to 14
anything 14
further 14
a 14
notion 14
which 14
exists 14
already 14
in 14
the 14
sound 14
natural 14
understanding 14
requiring 14
rather 14
to 14
be 14
cleared 14
up 14
than 14
to 14
be 14
taught 14
and 14
which 14
in 14
estimating 14
the 14
value 14
of 14
our 14
actions 14
always 14
takes 14
the 14
first 14
place 14
and 14
constitutes 14
the 14
condition 14
of 14
all 14
the 14
rest 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
do 14
this 14
we 14
will 14
take 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
duty 14
which 14
includes 14
that 14
of 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
although 14
implying 14
certain 14
subjective 14
restrictions 14
and 14
hindrances 14
these 14
however 14
far 14
from 14
concealing 14
it 14
or 14
rendering 14
it 14
unrecognizable 14
rather 14
bring 14
it 14
out 14
by 14
contrast 14
and 14
make 14
it 14
shine 14
forth 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
brighter 14
i 14
omit 14
here 14
all 14
actions 14
which 14
are 14
already 14
recognized 14
as 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
duty 14
although 14
they 14
may 14
be 14
useful 14
for 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
purpose 14
for 14
with 14
these 14
the 14
question 14
whether 14
they 14
are 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
cannot 14
arise 14
at 14
all 14
since 14
they 14
even 14
conflict 14
with 14
it 14
i 14
also 14
set 14
aside 14
those 14
actions 14
which 14
really 14
conform 14
to 14
duty 14
but 14
to 14
which 14
men 14
have 14
no 14
direct 14
inclination 14
performing 14
them 14
because 14
they 14
are 14
impelled 14
thereto 14
by 14
some 14
other 14
inclination 14
for 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
we 14
can 14
readily 14
distinguish 14
whether 14
the 14
action 14
which 14
agrees 14
with 14
duty 14
is 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
or 14
from 14
a 14
selfish 14
view 14
it 14
is 14
much 14
harder 14
to 14
make 14
this 14
distinction 14
when 14
the 14
action 14
accords 14
with 14
duty 14
and 14
the 14
subject 14
has 14
besides 14
a 14
direct 14
inclination 14
to 14
it 14
for 14
example 14
it 14
is 14
always 14
a 14
matter 14
of 14
duty 14
that 14
a 14
dealer 14
should 14
not 14
over 14
charge 14
an 14
inexperienced 14
purchaser 14
and 14
wherever 14
there 14
is 14
much 14
commerce 14
the 14
prudent 14
tradesman 14
does 14
not 14
overcharge 14
but 14
keeps 14
a 14
fixed 14
price 14
for 14
everyone 14
so 14
that 14
a 14
child 14
buys 14
of 14
him 14
as 14
well 14
as 14
any 14
other 14
men 14
are 14
thus 14
honestly 14
served 14
but 14
this 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
to 14
make 14
us 14
believe 14
that 14
the 14
tradesman 14
has 14
so 14
acted 14
from 14
duty 14
and 14
from 14
principles 14
of 14
honesty 14
his 14
own 14
advantage 14
required 14
it 14
it 14
is 14
out 14
of 14
the 14
question 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
to 14
suppose 14
that 14
he 14
might 14
besides 14
have 14
a 14
direct 14
inclination 14
in 14
favour 14
of 14
the 14
buyers 14
so 14
that 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
from 14
love 14
he 14
should 14
give 14
no 14
advantage 14
to 14
one 14
over 14
another 14
accordingly 14
the 14
action 14
was 14
done 14
neither 14
from 14
duty 14
nor 14
from 14
direct 14
inclination 14
but 14
merely 14
with 14
a 14
selfish 14
view 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
duty 14
to 14
maintain 14
ones 14
life 14
and 14
in 14
addition 14
everyone 14
has 14
also 14
a 14
direct 14
inclination 14
to 14
do 14
so 14
but 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
the 14
of 14
anxious 14
care 14
which 14
most 14
men 14
take 14
for 14
it 14
has 14
no 14
intrinsic 14
worth 14
and 14
their 14
maxim 14
has 14
no 14
moral 14
import 14
they 14
preserve 14
their 14
life 14
as 14
duty 14
requires 14
no 14
doubt 14
but 14
not 14
because 14
duty 14
requires 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
band 14
if 14
adversity 14
and 14
hopeless 14
sorrow 14
have 14
completely 14
taken 14
away 14
the 14
relish 14
for 14
life 14
if 14
the 14
unfortunate 14
one 14
strong 14
in 14
mind 14
indignant 14
at 14
his 14
fate 14
rather 14
than 14
desponding 14
or 14
dejected 14
wishes 14
for 14
death 14
and 14
yet 14
preserves 14
his 14
life 14
without 14
loving 14
it 14
not 14
from 14
inclination 14
or 14
fear 14
but 14
from 14
duty 14
then 14
his 14
maxim 14
has 14
a 14
moral 14
worth 14
to 14
be 14
beneficent 14
when 14
we 14
can 14
is 14
a 14
duty 14
and 14
besides 14
this 14
there 14
are 14
many 14
minds 14
so 14
sympathetically 14
constituted 14
that 14
without 14
any 14
other 14
motive 14
of 14
vanity 14
or 14
selfinterest 14
they 14
find 14
a 14
pleasure 14
in 14
spreading 14
joy 14
around 14
them 14
and 14
can 14
take 14
delight 14
in 14
the 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
others 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
their 14
own 14
work 14
but 14
i 14
maintain 14
that 14
in 14
such 14
a 14
case 14
an 14
action 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
however 14
proper 14
however 14
amiable 14
it 14
may 14
be 14
has 14
nevertheless 14
no 14
true 14
moral 14
worth 14
but 14
is 14
on 14
a 14
level 14
with 14
other 14
inclinations 14
eg 14
the 14
inclination 14
to 14
honour 14
which 14
if 14
it 14
is 14
happily 14
directed 14
to 14
that 14
which 14
is 14
in 14
fact 14
of 14
public 14
utility 14
and 14
accordant 14
with 14
duty 14
and 14
consequently 14
honourable 14
deserves 14
praise 14
and 14
encouragement 14
but 14
not 14
esteem 14
for 14
the 14
maxim 14
lacks 14
the 14
moral 14
import 14
namely 14
that 14
such 14
actions 14
be 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
not 14
from 14
inclination 14
put 14
the 14
case 14
that 14
the 14
mind 14
of 14
that 14
philanthropist 14
were 14
clouded 14
by 14
sorrow 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
extinguishing 14
all 14
sympathy 14
with 14
the 14
lot 14
of 14
others 14
and 14
that 14
while 14
he 14
still 14
has 14
the 14
power 14
to 14
benefit 14
others 14
in 14
distress 14
he 14
is 14
not 14
touched 14
by 14
their 14
trouble 14
because 14
he 14
is 14
absorbed 14
with 14
his 14
own 14
and 14
now 14
suppose 14
that 14
he 14
tears 14
himself 14
out 14
of 14
this 14
dead 14
insensibility 14
and 14
performs 14
the 14
action 14
without 14
any 14
inclination 14
to 14
it 14
but 14
simply 14
from 14
duty 14
then 14
first 14
has 14
his 14
action 14
its 14
genuine 14
moral 14
worth 14
further 14
still 14
if 14
nature 14
has 14
put 14
little 14
sympathy 14
in 14
the 14
heart 14
of 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
man 14
if 14
he 14
supposed 14
to 14
be 14
an 14
upright 14
man 14
is 14
by 14
temperament 14
cold 14
and 14
indifferent 14
to 14
the 14
sufferings 14
of 14
others 14
perhaps 14
because 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
he 14
is 14
provided 14
with 14
the 14
special 14
gift 14
of 14
patience 14
and 14
fortitude 14
and 14
supposes 14
or 14
even 14
requires 14
that 14
others 14
should 14
have 14
the 14
same 14
and 14
such 14
a 14
man 14
would 14
certainly 14
not 14
be 14
the 14
meanest 14
product 14
of 14
nature 14
but 14
if 14
nature 14
had 14
not 14
specially 14
framed 14
him 14
for 14
a 14
philanthropist 14
would 14
he 14
not 14
still 14
find 14
in 14
himself 14
a 14
source 14
from 14
whence 14
to 14
give 14
himself 14
a 14
far 14
higher 14
worth 14
than 14
that 14
of 14
a 14
goodnatured 14
temperament 14
could 14
be 14
unquestionably 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
in 14
this 14
that 14
the 14
moral 14
worth 14
of 14
the 14
character 14
is 14
brought 14
out 14
which 14
is 14
incomparably 14
the 14
highest 14
of 14
all 14
namely 14
that 14
he 14
is 14
beneficent 14
not 14
from 14
inclination 14
but 14
from 14
duty 14
to 14
secure 14
ones 14
own 14
happiness 14
is 14
a 14
duty 14
at 14
least 14
indirectly 14
for 14
discontent 14
with 14
ones 14
condition 14
under 14
a 14
pressure 14
of 14
many 14
anxieties 14
and 14
amidst 14
unsatisfied 14
wants 14
might 14
easily 14
become 14
a 14
great 14
temptation 14
to 14
transgression 14
of 14
duty 14
but 14
here 14
again 14
without 14
looking 14
to 14
duty 14
all 14
men 14
have 14
already 14
the 14
strongest 14
and 14
most 14
intimate 14
inclination 14
to 14
happiness 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
in 14
this 14
idea 14
that 14
all 14
inclinations 14
are 14
combined 14
in 14
one 14
total 14
but 14
the 14
precept 14
of 14
happiness 14
is 14
often 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
sort 14
that 14
it 14
greatly 14
interferes 14
with 14
some 14
inclinations 14
and 14
yet 14
a 14
man 14
cannot 14
form 14
any 14
definite 14
and 14
certain 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
sum 14
of 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
all 14
of 14
them 14
which 14
is 14
called 14
happiness 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
then 14
to 14
be 14
wondered 14
at 14
that 14
a 14
single 14
inclination 14
definite 14
both 14
as 14
to 14
what 14
it 14
promises 14
and 14
as 14
to 14
the 14
time 14
within 14
which 14
it 14
can 14
be 14
gratified 14
is 14
often 14
able 14
to 14
overcome 14
such 14
a 14
fluctuating 14
idea 14
and 14
that 14
a 14
gouty 14
patient 14
for 14
instance 14
can 14
choose 14
to 14
enjoy 14
what 14
he 14
likes 14
and 14
to 14
suffer 14
what 14
he 14
may 14
since 14
according 14
to 14
his 14
calculation 14
on 14
this 14
occasion 14
at 14
least 14
he 14
has 14
not 14
sacrificed 14
the 14
enjoyment 14
of 14
the 14
present 14
moment 14
to 14
a 14
possibly 14
mistaken 14
expectation 14
of 14
a 14
happiness 14
which 14
is 14
supposed 14
to 14
be 14
found 14
in 14
health 14
but 14
even 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
if 14
the 14
general 14
desire 14
for 14
happiness 14
did 14
not 14
influence 14
his 14
will 14
and 14
supposing 14
that 14
in 14
his 14
particular 14
case 14
health 14
was 14
not 14
a 14
necessary 14
element 14
in 14
this 14
calculation 14
there 14
yet 14
remains 14
in 14
this 14
as 14
in 14
all 14
other 14
cases 14
this 14
law 14
namely 14
that 14
he 14
should 14
promote 14
his 14
happiness 14
not 14
from 14
inclination 14
but 14
from 14
duty 14
and 14
by 14
this 14
would 14
his 14
conduct 14
first 14
acquire 14
true 14
moral 14
worth 14
it 14
is 14
in 14
this 14
manner 14
undoubtedly 14
that 14
we 14
are 14
to 14
understand 14
those 14
passages 14
of 14
scripture 14
also 14
in 14
which 14
we 14
are 14
commanded 14
to 14
love 14
our 14
neighbour 14
even 14
our 14
enemy 14
for 14
love 14
as 14
an 14
affection 14
cannot 14
be 14
commanded 14
but 14
beneficence 14
for 14
dutys 14
sake 14
may 14
even 14
though 14
we 14
are 14
not 14
impelled 14
to 14
it 14
by 14
any 14
inclination 14
nay 14
are 14
even 14
repelled 14
by 14
a 14
natural 14
and 14
unconquerable 14
aversion 14
this 14
is 14
practical 14
love 14
and 14
not 14
pathological 14
a 14
love 14
which 14
is 14
seated 14
in 14
the 14
will 14
and 14
not 14
in 14
the 14
propensions 14
of 14
sense 14
in 14
principles 14
of 14
action 14
and 14
not 14
of 14
tender 14
sympathy 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
this 14
love 14
alone 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
commanded 14
the 14
second 14
proposition 14
is 14
that 14
an 14
action 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
derives 14
its 14
moral 14
worth 14
not 14
from 14
the 14
purpose 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
attained 14
by 14
it 14
but 14
from 14
the 14
maxim 14
by 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
determined 14
and 14
therefore 14
does 14
not 14
depend 14
on 14
the 14
realization 14
of 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
but 14
merely 14
on 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
volition 14
by 14
which 14
the 14
action 14
has 14
taken 14
place 14
without 14
regard 14
to 14
any 14
object 14
of 14
desire 14
it 14
is 14
clear 14
from 14
what 14
precedes 14
that 14
the 14
purposes 14
which 14
we 14
may 14
have 14
in 14
view 14
in 14
our 14
actions 14
or 14
their 14
effects 14
regarded 14
as 14
ends 14
and 14
springs 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
cannot 14
give 14
to 14
actions 14
any 14
unconditional 14
or 14
moral 14
worth 14
in 14
what 14
then 14
can 14
their 14
worth 14
lie 14
if 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
to 14
consist 14
in 14
the 14
will 14
and 14
in 14
reference 14
to 14
its 14
expected 14
effect 14
it 14
cannot 14
lie 14
anywhere 14
but 14
in 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
without 14
regard 14
to 14
the 14
ends 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
attained 14
by 14
the 14
action 14
for 14
the 14
will 14
stands 14
between 14
its 14
a 14
priori 14
principle 14
which 14
is 14
formal 14
and 14
its 14
a 14
posteriori 14
spring 14
which 14
is 14
material 14
as 14
between 14
two 14
roads 14
and 14
as 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
determined 14
by 14
something 14
it 14
that 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
determined 14
by 14
the 14
formal 14
principle 14
of 14
volition 14
when 14
an 14
action 14
is 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
in 14
which 14
case 14
every 14
material 14
principle 14
has 14
been 14
withdrawn 14
from 14
it 14
the 14
third 14
proposition 14
which 14
is 14
a 14
consequence 14
of 14
the 14
two 14
preceding 14
i 14
would 14
express 14
thus 14
duty 14
is 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
acting 14
from 14
respect 14
for 14
the 14
law 14
i 14
may 14
have 14
inclination 14
for 14
an 14
object 14
as 14
the 14
effect 14
of 14
my 14
proposed 14
action 14
but 14
i 14
cannot 14
have 14
respect 14
for 14
it 14
just 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
effect 14
and 14
not 14
an 14
energy 14
of 14
will 14
similarly 14
i 14
cannot 14
have 14
respect 14
for 14
inclination 14
whether 14
my 14
own 14
or 14
anothers 14
i 14
can 14
at 14
most 14
if 14
my 14
own 14
approve 14
it 14
if 14
anothers 14
sometimes 14
even 14
love 14
it 14
ie 14
look 14
on 14
it 14
as 14
favourable 14
to 14
my 14
own 14
interest 14
it 14
is 14
only 14
what 14
is 14
connected 14
with 14
my 14
will 14
as 14
a 14
principle 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
as 14
an 14
effect 14
what 14
does 14
not 14
subserve 14
my 14
inclination 14
but 14
overpowers 14
it 14
or 14
at 14
least 14
in 14
case 14
of 14
choice 14
excludes 14
it 14
from 14
its 14
calculation 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
simply 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
itself 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
respect 14
and 14
hence 14
a 14
command 14
now 14
an 14
action 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
must 14
wholly 14
exclude 14
the 14
influence 14
of 14
inclination 14
and 14
with 14
it 14
every 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
so 14
that 14
nothing 14
remains 14
which 14
can 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
except 14
objectively 14
the 14
law 14
and 14
subjectively 14
pure 14
respect 14
for 14
this 14
practical 14
law 14
and 14
consequently 14
the 14
maxim 14
that 14
i 14
should 14
follow 14
this 14
law 14
even 14
to 14
the 14
thwarting 14
of 14
all 14
my 14
inclinations 14
a 14
maxim 14
is 14
the 14
subjective 14
principle 14
of 14
volition 14
the 14
objective 14
principle 14
ie 14
that 14
which 14
would 14
also 14
serve 14
subjectively 14
as 14
a 14
practical 14
principle 14
to 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
if 14
reason 14
had 14
full 14
power 14
over 14
the 14
faculty 14
of 14
desire 14
is 14
the 14
practical 14
law 14
thus 14
the 14
moral 14
worth 14
of 14
an 14
action 14
does 14
not 14
lie 14
in 14
the 14
effect 14
expected 14
from 14
it 14
nor 14
in 14
any 14
principle 14
of 14
action 14
which 14
requires 14
to 14
borrow 14
its 14
motive 14
from 14
this 14
expected 14
effect 14
for 14
all 14
these 14
effects 14
agreeableness 14
of 14
ones 14
condition 14
and 14
even 14
the 14
promotion 14
of 14
the 14
happiness 14
of 14
others 14
could 14
have 14
been 14
also 14
brought 14
about 14
by 14
other 14
causes 14
so 14
that 14
for 14
this 14
there 14
would 14
have 14
been 14
no 14
need 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
whereas 14
it 14
is 14
in 14
this 14
alone 14
that 14
the 14
supreme 14
and 14
unconditional 14
good 14
can 14
be 14
found 14
the 14
preeminent 14
good 14
which 14
we 14
call 14
moral 14
can 14
therefore 14
consist 14
in 14
nothing 14
else 14
than 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
law 14
in 14
itself 14
which 14
certainly 14
is 14
only 14
possible 14
in 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
in 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
this 14
conception 14
and 14
not 14
the 14
expected 14
effect 14
determines 14
the 14
will 14
this 14
is 14
a 14
good 14
which 14
is 14
already 14
present 14
in 14
the 14
person 14
who 14
acts 14
accordingly 14
and 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
to 14
wait 14
for 14
it 14
to 14
appear 14
first 14
in 14
the 14
result 14
it 14
might 14
be 14
here 14
objected 14
to 14
me 14
that 14
i 14
take 14
refuge 14
behind 14
the 14
word 14
respect 14
in 14
an 14
obscure 14
feeling 14
instead 14
of 14
giving 14
a 14
distinct 14
solution 14
of 14
the 14
question 14
by 14
a 14
concept 14
of 14
the 14
reason 14
but 14
although 14
respect 14
is 14
a 14
feeling 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
a 14
feeling 14
received 14
through 14
influence 14
but 14
is 14
selfwrought 14
by 14
a 14
rational 14
concept 14
and 14
therefore 14
is 14
specifically 14
distinct 14
from 14
all 14
feelings 14
of 14
the 14
former 14
kind 14
which 14
may 14
be 14
referred 14
either 14
to 14
inclination 14
or 14
fear 14
what 14
i 14
recognise 14
immediately 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
me 14
i 14
recognise 14
with 14
respect 14
this 14
merely 14
signifies 14
the 14
consciousness 14
that 14
my 14
will 14
is 14
subordinate 14
to 14
a 14
law 14
without 14
the 14
intervention 14
of 14
other 14
influences 14
on 14
my 14
sense 14
the 14
immediate 14
determination 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
by 14
the 14
law 14
and 14
the 14
consciousness 14
of 14
this 14
is 14
called 14
respect 14
so 14
that 14
this 14
is 14
regarded 14
as 14
an 14
effect 14
of 14
the 14
law 14
on 14
the 14
subject 14
and 14
not 14
as 14
the 14
cause 14
of 14
it 14
respect 14
is 14
properly 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
a 14
worth 14
which 14
thwarts 14
my 14
selflove 14
accordingly 14
it 14
is 14
something 14
which 14
is 14
considered 14
neither 14
as 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
inclination 14
nor 14
of 14
fear 14
although 14
it 14
has 14
something 14
analogous 14
to 14
both 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
respect 14
is 14
the 14
law 14
only 14
and 14
that 14
the 14
law 14
which 14
we 14
impose 14
on 14
ourselves 14
and 14
yet 14
recognise 14
as 14
necessary 14
in 14
itself 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
we 14
are 14
subjected 14
too 14
it 14
without 14
consulting 14
selflove 14
as 14
imposed 14
by 14
us 14
on 14
ourselves 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
result 14
of 14
our 14
will 14
in 14
the 14
former 14
aspect 14
it 14
has 14
an 14
analogy 14
to 14
fear 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
to 14
inclination 14
respect 14
for 14
a 14
person 14
is 14
properly 14
only 14
respect 14
for 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
honesty 14
etc 14
of 14
which 14
he 14
gives 14
us 14
an 14
example 14
since 14
we 14
also 14
look 14
on 14
the 14
improvement 14
of 14
our 14
talents 14
as 14
a 14
duty 14
we 14
consider 14
that 14
we 14
see 14
in 14
a 14
person 14
of 14
talents 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
the 14
example 14
of 14
a 14
law 14
viz 14
to 14
become 14
like 14
him 14
in 14
this 14
by 14
exercise 14
and 14
this 14
constitutes 14
our 14
respect 14
all 14
socalled 14
moral 14
interest 14
consists 14
simply 14
in 14
respect 14
for 14
the 14
law 14
but 14
what 14
sort 14
of 14
law 14
can 14
that 14
be 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
which 14
must 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
even 14
without 14
paying 14
any 14
regard 14
to 14
the 14
effect 14
expected 14
from 14
it 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
this 14
will 14
may 14
be 14
called 14
good 14
absolutely 14
and 14
without 14
qualification 14
as 14
i 14
have 14
deprived 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
impulse 14
which 14
could 14
arise 14
to 14
it 14
from 14
obedience 14
to 14
any 14
law 14
there 14
remains 14
nothing 14
but 14
the 14
universal 14
conformity 14
of 14
its 14
actions 14
to 14
law 14
in 14
general 14
which 14
alone 14
is 14
to 14
serve 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
a 14
principle 14
ie 14
i 14
am 14
never 14
to 14
act 14
otherwise 14
than 14
so 14
that 14
i 14
could 14
also 14
will 14
that 14
my 14
maxim 14
should 14
become 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
here 14
now 14
it 14
is 14
the 14
simple 14
conformity 14
to 14
law 14
in 14
general 14
without 14
assuming 14
any 14
particular 14
law 14
applicable 14
to 14
certain 14
actions 14
that 14
serves 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
its 14
principle 14
and 14
must 14
so 14
serve 14
it 14
if 14
duty 14
is 14
not 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
vain 14
delusion 14
and 14
a 14
chimerical 14
notion 14
the 14
common 14
reason 14
of 14
men 14
in 14
its 14
practical 14
judgements 14
perfectly 14
coincides 14
with 14
this 14
and 14
always 14
has 14
in 14
view 14
the 14
principle 14
here 14
suggested 14
let 14
the 14
question 14
be 14
for 14
example 14
may 14
i 14
when 14
in 14
distress 14
make 14
a 14
promise 14
with 14
the 14
intention 14
not 14
to 14
keep 14
it 14
i 14
readily 14
distinguish 14
here 14
between 14
the 14
two 14
significations 14
which 14
the 14
question 14
may 14
have 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
prudent 14
or 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
right 14
to 14
make 14
a 14
false 14
promise 14
the 14
former 14
may 14
undoubtedly 14
of 14
be 14
the 14
case 14
i 14
see 14
clearly 14
indeed 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
to 14
extricate 14
myself 14
from 14
a 14
present 14
difficulty 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
this 14
subterfuge 14
but 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
well 14
considered 14
whether 14
there 14
may 14
not 14
hereafter 14
spring 14
from 14
this 14
lie 14
much 14
greater 14
inconvenience 14
than 14
that 14
from 14
which 14
i 14
now 14
free 14
myself 14
and 14
as 14
with 14
all 14
my 14
supposed 14
cunning 14
the 14
consequences 14
cannot 14
be 14
so 14
easily 14
foreseen 14
but 14
that 14
credit 14
once 14
lost 14
may 14
be 14
much 14
more 14
injurious 14
to 14
me 14
than 14
any 14
mischief 14
which 14
i 14
seek 14
to 14
avoid 14
at 14
present 14
it 14
should 14
be 14
considered 14
whether 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
more 14
prudent 14
to 14
act 14
herein 14
according 14
to 14
a 14
universal 14
maxim 14
and 14
to 14
make 14
it 14
a 14
habit 14
to 14
promise 14
nothing 14
except 14
with 14
the 14
intention 14
of 14
keeping 14
it 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
soon 14
clear 14
to 14
me 14
that 14
such 14
a 14
maxim 14
will 14
still 14
only 14
be 14
based 14
on 14
the 14
fear 14
of 14
consequences 14
now 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
wholly 14
different 14
thing 14
to 14
be 14
truthful 14
from 14
duty 14
and 14
to 14
be 14
so 14
from 14
apprehension 14
of 14
injurious 14
consequences 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
case 14
the 14
very 14
notion 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
already 14
implies 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
me 14
in 14
the 14
second 14
case 14
i 14
must 14
first 14
look 14
about 14
elsewhere 14
to 14
see 14
what 14
results 14
may 14
be 14
combined 14
with 14
it 14
which 14
would 14
affect 14
myself 14
for 14
to 14
deviate 14
from 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
duty 14
is 14
beyond 14
all 14
doubt 14
wicked 14
but 14
to 14
be 14
unfaithful 14
to 14
my 14
maxim 14
of 14
prudence 14
may 14
often 14
be 14
very 14
advantageous 14
to 14
me 14
although 14
to 14
abide 14
by 14
it 14
is 14
certainly 14
safer 14
the 14
shortest 14
way 14
however 14
and 14
an 14
unerring 14
one 14
to 14
discover 14
the 14
answer 14
to 14
this 14
question 14
whether 14
a 14
lying 14
promise 14
is 14
consistent 14
with 14
duty 14
is 14
to 14
ask 14
myself 14
should 14
i 14
be 14
content 14
that 14
my 14
maxim 14
to 14
extricate 14
myself 14
from 14
difficulty 14
by 14
a 14
false 14
promise 14
should 14
hold 14
good 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
myself 14
as 14
well 14
as 14
for 14
others 14
and 14
should 14
i 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
say 14
to 14
myself 14
every 14
one 14
may 14
make 14
a 14
deceitful 14
promise 14
when 14
he 14
finds 14
himself 14
in 14
a 14
difficulty 14
from 14
which 14
he 14
cannot 14
otherwise 14
extricate 14
himself 14
then 14
i 14
presently 14
become 14
aware 14
that 14
while 14
i 14
can 14
will 14
the 14
lie 14
i 14
can 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
will 14
that 14
lying 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
with 14
such 14
a 14
law 14
there 14
would 14
be 14
no 14
promises 14
at 14
all 14
since 14
it 14
would 14
be 14
in 14
vain 14
to 14
allege 14
my 14
intention 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
my 14
future 14
actions 14
to 14
those 14
who 14
would 14
not 14
believe 14
this 14
allegation 14
or 14
if 14
they 14
over 14
hastily 14
did 14
so 14
would 14
pay 14
me 14
back 14
in 14
my 14
own 14
coin 14
hence 14
my 14
maxim 14
as 14
soon 14
as 14
it 14
should 14
be 14
made 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
would 14
necessarily 14
destroy 14
itself 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
therefore 14
need 14
any 14
farreaching 14
penetration 14
to 14
discern 14
what 14
i 14
have 14
to 14
do 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
my 14
will 14
may 14
be 14
morally 14
good 14
inexperienced 14
in 14
the 14
course 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
incapable 14
of 14
being 14
prepared 14
for 14
all 14
its 14
contingencies 14
i 14
only 14
ask 14
myself 14
canst 14
thou 14
also 14
will 14
that 14
thy 14
maxim 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
if 14
not 14
then 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
rejected 14
and 14
that 14
not 14
because 14
of 14
a 14
disadvantage 14
accruing 14
from 14
it 14
to 14
myself 14
or 14
even 14
to 14
others 14
but 14
because 14
it 14
cannot 14
enter 14
as 14
a 14
principle 14
into 14
a 14
possible 14
universal 14
legislation 14
and 14
reason 14
extorts 14
from 14
me 14
immediate 14
respect 14
for 14
such 14
legislation 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
indeed 14
as 14
yet 14
discern 14
on 14
what 14
this 14
respect 14
is 14
based 14
this 14
the 14
philosopher 14
may 14
inquire 14
but 14
at 14
least 14
i 14
understand 14
this 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
estimation 14
of 14
the 14
worth 14
which 14
far 14
outweighs 14
all 14
worth 14
of 14
what 14
is 14
recommended 14
by 14
inclination 14
and 14
that 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
acting 14
from 14
pure 14
respect 14
for 14
the 14
practical 14
law 14
is 14
what 14
constitutes 14
duty 14
to 14
which 14
every 14
other 14
motive 14
must 14
give 14
place 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
the 14
condition 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
being 14
good 14
in 14
itself 14
and 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
will 14
is 14
above 14
everything 14
thus 14
then 14
without 14
quitting 14
the 14
moral 14
knowledge 14
of 14
common 14
human 14
reason 14
we 14
have 14
arrived 14
at 14
its 14
principle 14
and 14
although 14
no 14
doubt 14
common 14
men 14
do 14
not 14
conceive 14
it 14
in 14
such 14
an 14
abstract 14
and 14
universal 14
form 14
yet 14
they 14
always 14
have 14
it 14
really 14
before 14
their 14
eyes 14
and 14
use 14
it 14
as 14
the 14
standard 14
of 14
their 14
decision 14
here 14
it 14
would 14
be 14
easy 14
to 14
show 14
how 14
with 14
this 14
compass 14
in 14
hand 14
men 14
are 14
well 14
able 14
to 14
distinguish 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
that 14
occurs 14
what 14
is 14
good 14
what 14
bad 14
conformably 14
to 14
duty 14
or 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
it 14
if 14
without 14
in 14
the 14
least 14
teaching 14
them 14
anything 14
new 14
we 14
only 14
like 14
socrates 14
direct 14
their 14
attention 14
to 14
the 14
principle 14
they 14
themselves 14
employ 14
and 14
that 14
therefore 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
need 14
science 14
and 14
philosophy 14
to 14
know 14
what 14
we 14
should 14
do 14
to 14
be 14
honest 14
and 14
good 14
yea 14
even 14
wise 14
and 14
virtuous 14
indeed 14
we 14
might 14
well 14
have 14
conjectured 14
beforehand 14
that 14
the 14
knowledge 14
of 14
what 14
every 14
man 14
is 14
bound 14
to 14
do 14
and 14
therefore 14
also 14
to 14
know 14
would 14
be 14
within 14
the 14
reach 14
of 14
every 14
man 14
even 14
the 14
commonest 14
here 14
we 14
cannot 14
forbear 14
admiration 14
when 14
we 14
see 14
how 14
great 14
an 14
advantage 14
the 14
practical 14
judgement 14
has 14
over 14
the 14
theoretical 14
in 14
the 14
common 14
understanding 14
of 14
men 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
if 14
common 14
reason 14
ventures 14
to 14
depart 14
from 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
experience 14
and 14
from 14
the 14
perceptions 14
of 14
the 14
senses 14
it 14
falls 14
into 14
mere 14
inconceivabilities 14
and 14
selfcontradictions 14
at 14
least 14
into 14
a 14
chaos 14
of 14
uncertainty 14
obscurity 14
and 14
instability 14
but 14
in 14
the 14
practical 14
sphere 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
when 14
the 14
common 14
understanding 14
excludes 14
all 14
sensible 14
springs 14
from 14
practical 14
laws 14
that 14
its 14
power 14
of 14
judgement 14
begins 14
to 14
show 14
itself 14
to 14
advantage 14
it 14
then 14
becomes 14
even 14
subtle 14
whether 14
it 14
be 14
that 14
it 14
chicanes 14
with 14
its 14
own 14
conscience 14
or 14
with 14
other 14
claims 14
respecting 14
what 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
called 14
right 14
or 14
whether 14
it 14
desires 14
for 14
its 14
own 14
instruction 14
to 14
determine 14
honestly 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
actions 14
and 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
case 14
it 14
may 14
even 14
have 14
as 14
good 14
a 14
hope 14
of 14
hitting 14
the 14
mark 14
as 14
any 14
philosopher 14
whatever 14
can 14
promise 14
himself 14
nay 14
it 14
is 14
almost 14
more 14
sure 14
of 14
doing 14
so 14
because 14
the 14
philosopher 14
cannot 14
have 14
any 14
other 14
principle 14
while 14
he 14
may 14
easily 14
perplex 14
his 14
judgement 14
by 14
a 14
multitude 14
of 14
considerations 14
foreign 14
to 14
the 14
matter 14
and 14
so 14
turn 14
aside 14
from 14
the 14
right 14
way 14
would 14
it 14
not 14
therefore 14
be 14
wiser 14
in 14
moral 14
concerns 14
to 14
acquiesce 14
in 14
the 14
judgement 14
of 14
common 14
reason 14
or 14
at 14
most 14
only 14
to 14
call 14
in 14
philosophy 14
for 14
the 14
purpose 14
of 14
rendering 14
the 14
system 14
of 14
morals 14
more 14
complete 14
and 14
intelligible 14
and 14
its 14
rules 14
more 14
convenient 14
for 14
use 14
especially 14
for 14
disputation 14
but 14
not 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
draw 14
off 14
the 14
common 14
understanding 14
from 14
its 14
happy 14
simplicity 14
or 14
to 14
bring 14
it 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
philosophy 14
into 14
a 14
new 14
path 14
of 14
inquiry 14
and 14
instruction 14
innocence 14
is 14
indeed 14
a 14
glorious 14
thing 14
only 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
it 14
is 14
very 14
sad 14
that 14
it 14
cannot 14
well 14
maintain 14
itself 14
and 14
is 14
easily 14
seduced 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
even 14
wisdom 14
which 14
otherwise 14
consists 14
more 14
in 14
conduct 14
than 14
in 14
knowledge 14
yet 14
has 14
need 14
of 14
science 14
not 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
learn 14
from 14
it 14
but 14
to 14
secure 14
for 14
its 14
precepts 14
admission 14
and 14
permanence 14
against 14
all 14
the 14
commands 14
of 14
duty 14
which 14
reason 14
represents 14
to 14
man 14
as 14
so 14
deserving 14
of 14
respect 14
he 14
feels 14
in 14
himself 14
a 14
powerful 14
counterpoise 14
in 14
his 14
wants 14
and 14
inclinations 14
the 14
entire 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
which 14
he 14
sums 14
up 14
under 14
the 14
name 14
of 14
happiness 14
now 14
reason 14
issues 14
its 14
commands 14
unyieldingly 14
without 14
promising 14
anything 14
to 14
the 14
inclinations 14
and 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
with 14
disregard 14
and 14
contempt 14
for 14
these 14
claims 14
which 14
are 14
so 14
impetuous 14
and 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
so 14
plausible 14
and 14
which 14
will 14
not 14
allow 14
themselves 14
to 14
be 14
suppressed 14
by 14
any 14
command 14
hence 14
there 14
arises 14
a 14
natural 14
dialectic 14
ie 14
a 14
disposition 14
to 14
argue 14
against 14
these 14
strict 14
laws 14
of 14
duty 14
and 14
to 14
question 14
their 14
validity 14
or 14
at 14
least 14
their 14
purity 14
and 14
strictness 14
and 14
if 14
possible 14
to 14
make 14
them 14
more 14
accordant 14
with 14
our 14
wishes 14
and 14
inclinations 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
to 14
corrupt 14
them 14
at 14
their 14
very 14
source 14
and 14
entirely 14
to 14
destroy 14
their 14
worth 14
a 14
thing 14
which 14
even 14
common 14
practical 14
reason 14
cannot 14
ultimately 14
call 14
good 14
thus 14
is 14
the 14
common 14
reason 14
of 14
man 14
compelled 14
to 14
go 14
out 14
of 14
its 14
sphere 14
and 14
to 14
take 14
a 14
step 14
into 14
the 14
field 14
of 14
a 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
not 14
to 14
satisfy 14
any 14
speculative 14
want 14
which 14
never 14
occurs 14
to 14
it 14
as 14
long 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
content 14
to 14
be 14
mere 14
sound 14
reason 14
but 14
even 14
on 14
practical 14
grounds 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
attain 14
in 14
it 14
information 14
and 14
clear 14
instruction 14
respecting 14
the 14
source 14
of 14
its 14
principle 14
and 14
the 14
correct 14
determination 14
of 14
it 14
in 14
opposition 14
to 14
the 14
maxims 14
which 14
are 14
based 14
on 14
wants 14
and 14
inclinations 14
so 14
that 14
it 14
may 14
escape 14
from 14
the 14
perplexity 14
of 14
opposite 14
claims 14
and 14
not 14
run 14
the 14
risk 14
of 14
losing 14
all 14
genuine 14
moral 14
principles 14
through 14
the 14
equivocation 14
into 14
which 14
it 14
easily 14
falls 14
thus 14
when 14
practical 14
reason 14
cultivates 14
itself 14
there 14
insensibly 14
arises 14
in 14
it 14
a 14
dialetic 14
which 14
forces 14
it 14
to 14
seek 14
aid 14
in 14
philosophy 14
just 14
as 14
happens 14
to 14
it 14
in 14
its 14
theoretic 14
use 14
and 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
therefore 14
as 14
well 14
as 14
in 14
the 14
other 14
it 14
will 14
find 14

nowhere 14

popular 14
moral 14
philosophy 14
to 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
if 14
we 14
have 14
hitherto 14
drawn 14
our 14
notion 14
of 14
duty 14
from 14
the 14
common 14

of 14
our 14
practical 14
reason 14
it 14
is 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
to 14
be 14
inferred 14

we 14
have 14

an 14
empirical 14

complaints 14
that 14
one 14
cannot 14
find 14
a 14
single 14
certain 14
example 14
of 14
the 14
disposition 14
to 14
act 14
from 14
pure 14
duty 14

many 14
things 14
are 14
done 14

conformity 14
with 14
what 14
duty 14
prescribes 14

always 14
doubtful 14
whether 14
they 14
are 14
done 14
strictly 14
from 14
duty 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
have 14
a 14
moral 14
worth 14
hence 14
there 14
have 14
at 14
all 14
times 14
been 14
philosophers 14
who 14
have 14
altogether 14
denied 14
that 14
this 14
disposition 14
actually 14
exists 14
at 14
all 14
in 14
human 14
actions 14
and 14
have 14
ascribed 14
everything 14
to 14
a 14
more 14
or 14
less 14
refined 14
selflove 14
not 14
that 14
they 14
have 14
on 14
that 14
account 14
questioned 14
the 14
soundness 14
of 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
morality 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
they 14
spoke 14
with 14
sincere 14
regret 14
of 14
the 14
frailty 14
and 14
corruption 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
which 14
though 14
noble 14
enough 14
to 14
take 14
its 14
rule 14
an 14
idea 14
so 14
worthy 14
of 14
respect 14
is 14
yet 14
weak 14
to 14
follow 14
it 14
and 14
employs 14
reason 14
which 14
ought 14
to 14
give 14
it 14
the 14
law 14
only 14
for 14
the 14
purpose 14
of 14
providing 14
for 14
the 14
interest 14
of 14
the 14
inclinations 14
whether 14
singly 14
or 14
at 14
the 14
best 14
in 14
the 14
greatest 14
possible 14
harmony 14
with 14
one 14
another 14
in 14
fact 14
it 14
is 14
absolutely 14
impossible 14
to 14
make 14
out 14
by 14
experience 14
with 14
complete 14
certainty 14
a 14
single 14
case 14
in 14
which 14
the 14
maxim 14
of 14
an 14
action 14
however 14
right 14
in 14
itself 14
rested 14
simply 14
on 14
moral 14
grounds 14
and 14
on 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
duty 14
sometimes 14
it 14
happens 14
that 14
with 14
the 14
sharpest 14
selfexamination 14
we 14
can 14
find 14
nothing 14
beside 14
the 14
moral 14
principle 14
of 14
duty 14
which 14
could 14
have 14
been 14
powerful 14
enough 14
to 14
move 14
us 14
to 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
action 14
and 14
to 14
so 14
great 14
a 14
sacrifice 14
yet 14
we 14
cannot 14
from 14
this 14
infer 14
with 14
certainty 14
that 14
it 14
was 14
not 14
really 14
some 14
secret 14
impulse 14
of 14
selflove 14
under 14
the 14
false 14
appearance 14
of 14
duty 14
that 14
was 14
the 14
actual 14
determining 14
cause 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
we 14
like 14
them 14
to 14
flatter 14
ourselves 14
by 14
falsely 14
taking 14
credit 14
for 14
a 14
more 14
noble 14
motive 14
whereas 14
in 14
fact 14
we 14
can 14
never 14
even 14
by 14
the 14
strictest 14
examination 14
get 14
completely 14
behind 14
the 14
secret 14
springs 14
of 14
action 14
since 14
when 14
the 14
question 14
is 14
of 14
moral 14
worth 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
with 14
the 14
actions 14
which 14
we 14
see 14
that 14
we 14
are 14
concerned 14
but 14
with 14
those 14
inward 14
principles 14
of 14
them 14
which 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
see 14
moreover 14
we 14
cannot 14
better 14
serve 14
the 14
wishes 14
of 14
those 14
who 14
ridicule 14
all 14
morality 14
as 14
a 14
mere 14
chimera 14
of 14
human 14
imagination 14
over 14
stepping 14
itself 14
from 14
vanity 14
than 14
by 14
conceding 14
to 14
them 14
that 14
notions 14
of 14
duty 14
must 14
be 14
drawn 14
only 14
from 14
experience 14
as 14
from 14
indolence 14
people 14
are 14
ready 14
to 14
think 14
is 14
also 14
the 14
case 14
with 14
all 14
other 14
notions 14
for 14
or 14
is 14
to 14
prepare 14
for 14
them 14
a 14
certain 14
triumph 14
i 14
am 14
willing 14
to 14
admit 14
out 14
of 14
love 14
of 14
humanity 14
that 14
even 14
most 14
of 14
our 14
actions 14
are 14
correct 14
but 14
if 14
we 14
look 14
closer 14
at 14
them 14
we 14
everywhere 14
come 14
upon 14
the 14
dear 14
self 14
which 14
is 14
always 14
prominent 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
this 14
they 14
have 14
in 14
view 14
and 14
not 14
the 14
strict 14
command 14
of 14
duty 14
which 14
would 14
often 14
require 14
selfdenial 14
without 14
being 14
an 14
enemy 14
of 14
virtue 14
a 14
cool 14
observer 14
one 14
that 14
does 14
not 14
mistake 14
the 14
wish 14
for 14
good 14
however 14
lively 14
for 14
its 14
reality 14
may 14
sometimes 14
doubt 14
whether 14
true 14
virtue 14
is 14
actually 14
found 14
anywhere 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
and 14
this 14
especially 14
as 14
years 14
increase 14
and 14
the 14
judgement 14
is 14
partly 14
made 14
wiser 14
by 14
experience 14
and 14
partly 14
also 14
more 14
acute 14
in 14
observation 14
this 14
being 14
so 14
nothing 14
can 14
secure 14
us 14
from 14
falling 14
away 14
altogether 14
from 14
our 14
ideas 14
of 14
duty 14
or 14
maintain 14
in 14
the 14
soul 14
a 14
wellgrounded 14
respect 14
for 14
its 14
law 14
but 14
the 14
clear 14
conviction 14
that 14
although 14
there 14
should 14
never 14
have 14
been 14
actions 14
which 14
really 14
sprang 14
from 14
such 14
pure 14
sources 14
yet 14
whether 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
takes 14
place 14
is 14
not 14
at 14
all 14
the 14
question 14
but 14
that 14
reason 14
of 14
itself 14
independent 14
on 14
all 14
experience 14
ordains 14
what 14
ought 14
to 14
take 14
place 14
that 14
accordingly 14
actions 14
of 14
which 14
perhaps 14
the 14
world 14
has 14
hitherto 14
never 14
given 14
an 14
example 14
the 14
feasibility 14
even 14
of 14
which 14
might 14
be 14
very 14
much 14
doubted 14
by 14
one 14
who 14
founds 14
everything 14
on 14
experience 14
are 14
nevertheless 14
inflexibly 14
commanded 14
by 14
reason 14
that 14
eg 14
even 14
though 14
there 14
might 14
never 14
yet 14
have 14
been 14
a 14
sincere 14
friend 14
yet 14
not 14
a 14
whit 14
the 14
less 14
is 14
pure 14
sincerity 14
in 14
friendship 14
required 14
of 14
every 14
man 14
because 14
prior 14
to 14
all 14
experience 14
this 14
duty 14
is 14
involved 14
as 14
duty 14
in 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
reason 14
determining 14
the 14
will 14
by 14
a 14
priori 14
principles 14
when 14
we 14
add 14
further 14
that 14
unless 14
we 14
deny 14
that 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
morality 14
has 14
any 14
truth 14
or 14
reference 14
to 14
any 14
possible 14
object 14
we 14
must 14
admit 14
that 14
its 14
law 14
must 14
be 14
valid 14
not 14
merely 14
for 14
men 14
but 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
creatures 14
generally 14
not 14
merely 14
under 14
certain 14
contingent 14
conditions 14
or 14
with 14
exceptions 14
but 14
with 14
absolute 14
necessity 14
then 14
it 14
is 14
clear 14
that 14
no 14
experience 14
could 14
enable 14
us 14
to 14
infer 14
even 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
such 14
apodeictic 14
laws 14
for 14
with 14
what 14
right 14
could 14
we 14
bring 14
into 14
unbounded 14
respect 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
precept 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
nature 14
that 14
which 14
perhaps 14
holds 14
only 14
under 14
the 14
contingent 14
conditions 14
of 14
humanity 14
or 14
how 14
could 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
determination 14
of 14
our 14
will 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
determination 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
generally 14
and 14
for 14
us 14
only 14
as 14
such 14
if 14
they 14
were 14
merely 14
empirical 14
and 14
did 14
not 14
take 14
their 14
origin 14
wholly 14
a 14
priori 14
from 14
pure 14
but 14
practical 14
reason 14
nor 14
could 14
anything 14
be 14
more 14
fatal 14
to 14
morality 14
than 14
that 14
we 14
should 14
wish 14
to 14
derive 14
it 14
from 14
examples 14
for 14
every 14
example 14
of 14
it 14
that 14
is 14
set 14
before 14
me 14
must 14
be 14
first 14
itself 14
tested 14
by 14
principles 14
of 14
morality 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
worthy 14
to 14
serve 14
as 14
an 14
original 14
example 14
ie 14
as 14
a 14
pattern 14
but 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
can 14
it 14
authoritatively 14
furnish 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
morality 14
even 14
the 14
holy 14
one 14
of 14
the 14
gospels 14
must 14
first 14
be 14
compared 14
with 14
our 14
ideal 14
of 14
moral 14
perfection 14
before 14
we 14
can 14
recognise 14
him 14
as 14
such 14
and 14
so 14
he 14
says 14
of 14
himself 14
why 14
call 14
ye 14
me 14
whom 14
you 14
see 14
good 14
none 14
is 14
good 14
the 14
model 14
of 14
good 14
but 14
god 14
only 14
whom 14
ye 14
do 14
not 14
see 14
but 14
whence 14
have 14
we 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
god 14
as 14
the 14
supreme 14
good 14
simply 14
from 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
moral 14
perfection 14
which 14
reason 14
frames 14
a 14
priori 14
and 14
connects 14
inseparably 14
with 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
a 14
free 14
will 14
imitation 14
finds 14
no 14
place 14
at 14
all 14
in 14
morality 14
and 14
examples 14
serve 14
only 14
for 14
encouragement 14
ie 14
they 14
put 14
beyond 14
doubt 14
the 14
feasibility 14
of 14
what 14
the 14
law 14
commands 14
they 14
make 14
visible 14
that 14
which 14
the 14
practical 14
rule 14
expresses 14
more 14
generally 14
but 14
they 14
can 14
never 14
authorize 14
us 14
to 14
set 14
aside 14
the 14
true 14
original 14
which 14
lies 14
in 14
reason 14
and 14
to 14
guide 14
ourselves 14
by 14
examples 14
if 14
then 14
there 14
is 14
no 14
genuine 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
but 14
what 14
must 14
rest 14
simply 14
on 14
pure 14
reason 14
independent 14
of 14
all 14
experience 14
i 14
think 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
necessary 14
even 14
to 14
put 14
the 14
question 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
good 14
to 14
exhibit 14
these 14
concepts 14
in 14
their 14
generality 14
in 14
abstracto 14
as 14
they 14
are 14
established 14
a 14
priori 14
along 14
with 14
the 14
principles 14
belonging 14
to 14
them 14
if 14
our 14
knowledge 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
distinguished 14
from 14
the 14
vulgar 14
and 14
to 14
be 14
called 14
philosophical 14
in 14
our 14
times 14
indeed 14
this 14
might 14
perhaps 14
be 14
necessary 14
for 14
if 14
we 14
collected 14
votes 14
whether 14
pure 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
separated 14
from 14
everything 14
empirical 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
or 14
whether 14
popular 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
preferred 14
it 14
is 14
easy 14
to 14
guess 14
which 14
side 14
would 14
preponderate 14
this 14
descending 14
to 14
popular 14
notions 14
is 14
certainly 14
very 14
commendable 14
if 14
the 14
ascent 14
to 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
pure 14
reason 14
has 14
first 14
taken 14
place 14
and 14
been 14
satisfactorily 14
accomplished 14
this 14
implies 14
that 14
we 14
first 14
found 14
ethics 14
on 14
metaphysics 14
and 14
then 14
when 14
it 14
is 14
firmly 14
established 14
procure 14
a 14
hearing 14
for 14
it 14
by 14
giving 14
it 14
a 14
popular 14
character 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
quite 14
absurd 14
to 14
try 14
to 14
be 14
popular 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
inquiry 14
on 14
which 14
the 14
soundness 14
of 14
the 14
principles 14
depends 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
only 14
that 14
this 14
proceeding 14
can 14
never 14
lay 14
claim 14
to 14
the 14
very 14
rare 14
merit 14
of 14
a 14
true 14
philosophical 14
popularity 14
since 14
there 14
is 14
no 14
art 14
in 14
being 14
intelligible 14
if 14
one 14
renounces 14
all 14
thoroughness 14
of 14
insight 14
but 14
also 14
it 14
produces 14
a 14
disgusting 14
medley 14
of 14
compiled 14
observations 14
and 14
halfreasoned 14
principles 14
shallow 14
pates 14
enjoy 14
this 14
because 14
it 14
can 14
be 14
used 14
for 14
everyday 14
chat 14
but 14
the 14
sagacious 14
find 14
in 14
it 14
only 14
confusion 14
and 14
being 14
unsatisfied 14
and 14
unable 14
to 14
help 14
themselves 14
they 14
turn 14
away 14
their 14
eyes 14
while 14
philosophers 14
who 14
see 14
quite 14
well 14
through 14
this 14
delusion 14
are 14
little 14
listened 14
to 14
when 14
they 14
call 14
men 14
off 14
for 14
a 14
time 14
from 14
this 14
pretended 14
popularity 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
they 14
might 14
be 14
rightfully 14
popular 14
after 14
they 14
have 14
attained 14
a 14
definite 14
insight 14
we 14
need 14
only 14
look 14
at 14
the 14
attempts 14
of 14
moralists 14
in 14
that 14
favourite 14
fashion 14
and 14
we 14
shall 14
find 14
at 14
one 14
time 14
the 14
special 14
constitution 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
including 14
however 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
nature 14
generally 14
at 14
one 14
time 14
perfection 14
at 14
another 14
happiness 14
here 14
moral 14
sense 14
there 14
fear 14
of 14
god 14
a 14
little 14
of 14
this 14
and 14
a 14
little 14
of 14
that 14
in 14
marvellous 14
mixture 14
without 14
its 14
occurring 14
to 14
them 14
to 14
ask 14
whether 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
morality 14
are 14
to 14
be 14
sought 14
in 14
the 14
knowledge 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
at 14
all 14
which 14
we 14
can 14
have 14
only 14
from 14
experience 14
or 14
if 14
this 14
is 14
not 14
so 14
if 14
these 14
principles 14
are 14
to 14
be 14
found 14
altogether 14
a 14
priori 14
free 14
from 14
everything 14
empirical 14
in 14
pure 14
rational 14
concepts 14
only 14
and 14
nowhere 14
else 14
not 14
even 14
in 14
the 14
smallest 14
degree 14
then 14
rather 14
to 14
adopt 14
the 14
method 14
of 14
making 14
this 14
a 14
separate 14
inquiry 14
as 14
pure 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
or 14
if 14
one 14
may 14
use 14
a 14
name 14
so 14
decried 14
as 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
to 14
bring 14
it 14
by 14
itself 14
to 14
completeness 14
and 14
to 14
require 14
the 14
public 14
which 14
wishes 14
for 14
popular 14
treatment 14
to 14
await 14
the 14
issue 14
of 14
this 14
undertaking 14
just 14
as 14
pure 14
mathematics 14
are 14
distinguished 14
from 14
applied 14
pure 14
logic 14
from 14
applied 14
so 14
if 14
we 14
choose 14
we 14
may 14
also 14
distinguish 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
of 14
morals 14
metaphysic 14
from 14
applied 14
viz 14
applied 14
to 14
human 14
nature 14
by 14
this 14
designation 14
we 14
are 14
also 14
at 14
once 14
reminded 14
that 14
moral 14
principles 14
are 14
not 14
based 14
on 14
properties 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
but 14
must 14
subsist 14
a 14
priori 14
of 14
themselves 14
while 14
from 14
such 14
principles 14
practical 14
rules 14
must 14
be 14
capable 14
of 14
being 14
deduced 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
nature 14
and 14
accordingly 14
for 14
that 14
of 14
man 14
such 14
a 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
completely 14
isolated 14
not 14
mixed 14
with 14
any 14
anthropology 14
theology 14
physics 14
or 14
hyperphysics 14
and 14
still 14
less 14
with 14
occult 14
qualities 14
which 14
we 14
might 14
call 14
hypophysical 14
is 14
not 14
only 14
an 14
indispensable 14
substratum 14
of 14
all 14
sound 14
theoretical 14
knowledge 14
of 14
duties 14
but 14
is 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
a 14
desideratum 14
of 14
the 14
highest 14
importance 14
to 14
the 14
actual 14
fulfilment 14
of 14
their 14
precepts 14
for 14
the 14
pure 14
conception 14
of 14
duty 14
unmixed 14
with 14
any 14
foreign 14
addition 14
of 14
empirical 14
attractions 14
and 14
in 14
a 14
word 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
exercises 14
on 14
the 14
human 14
heart 14
by 14
way 14
of 14
reason 14
alone 14
which 14
first 14
becomes 14
aware 14
with 14
this 14
that 14
it 14
can 14
of 14
itself 14
be 14
practical 14
an 14
influence 14
so 14
much 14
more 14
powerful 14
than 14
all 14
other 14
springs 14
which 14
may 14
be 14
derived 14
from 14
the 14
field 14
of 14
experience 14
that 14
in 14
the 14
consciousness 14
of 14
its 14
worth 14
it 14
despises 14
the 14
latter 14
and 14
can 14
by 14
degrees 14
become 14
their 14
master 14
whereas 14
a 14
mixed 14
ethics 14
compounded 14
partly 14
of 14
motives 14
drawn 14
from 14
feelings 14
and 14
inclinations 14
and 14
partly 14
also 14
of 14
conceptions 14
of 14
reason 14
must 14
make 14
the 14
mind 14
waver 14
between 14
motives 14
which 14
cannot 14
be 14
brought 14
under 14
any 14
principle 14
which 14
lead 14
to 14
good 14
only 14
by 14
mere 14
accident 14
and 14
very 14
often 14
also 14
to 14
evil 14
i 14
have 14
a 14
letter 14
from 14
the 14
late 14
excellent 14
sulzer 14
in 14
which 14
he 14
asks 14
me 14
what 14
can 14
be 14
the 14
reason 14
that 14
moral 14
instruction 14
although 14
containing 14
much 14
that 14
is 14
convincing 14
for 14
the 14
reason 14
yet 14
accomplishes 14
so 14
little 14
my 14
answer 14
was 14
postponed 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
i 14
might 14
make 14
it 14
complete 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
simply 14
this 14
that 14
the 14
teachers 14
themselves 14
have 14
not 14
got 14
their 14
own 14
notions 14
clear 14
and 14
when 14
they 14
endeavour 14
to 14
make 14
up 14
for 14
this 14
by 14
raking 14
up 14
motives 14
of 14
moral 14
goodness 14
from 14
every 14
quarter 14
trying 14
to 14
make 14
their 14
physic 14
right 14
strong 14
they 14
spoil 14
it 14
for 14
the 14
commonest 14
understanding 14
shows 14
that 14
if 14
we 14
imagine 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
hand 14
an 14
act 14
of 14
honesty 14
done 14
with 14
steadfast 14
mind 14
apart 14
from 14
every 14
view 14
to 14
advantage 14
of 14
any 14
kind 14
in 14
this 14
world 14
or 14
another 14
and 14
even 14
under 14
the 14
greatest 14
temptations 14
of 14
necessity 14
or 14
allurement 14
and 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
a 14
similar 14
act 14
which 14
was 14
affected 14
in 14
however 14
low 14
a 14
degree 14
by 14
a 14
foreign 14
motive 14
the 14
former 14
leaves 14
far 14
behind 14
and 14
eclipses 14
the 14
second 14
it 14
elevates 14
the 14
soul 14
and 14
inspires 14
the 14
wish 14
to 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
act 14
in 14
like 14
manner 14
oneself 14
even 14
moderately 14
young 14
children 14
feel 14
this 14
impression 14
ana 14
one 14
should 14
never 14
represent 14
duties 14
to 14
them 14
in 14
any 14
other 14
light 14
from 14
what 14
has 14
been 14
said 14
it 14
is 14
clear 14
that 14
all 14
moral 14
conceptions 14
have 14
their 14
seat 14
and 14
origin 14
completely 14
a 14
priori 14
in 14
the 14
reason 14
and 14
that 14
moreover 14
in 14
the 14
commonest 14
reason 14
just 14
as 14
truly 14
as 14
in 14
that 14
which 14
is 14
in 14
the 14
highest 14
degree 14
speculative 14
that 14
they 14
cannot 14
be 14
obtained 14
by 14
abstraction 14
from 14
any 14
empirical 14
and 14
therefore 14
merely 14
contingent 14
knowledge 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
this 14
purity 14
of 14
their 14
origin 14
that 14
makes 14
them 14
worthy 14
to 14
serve 14
as 14
our 14
supreme 14
practical 14
principle 14
and 14
that 14
just 14
in 14
proportion 14
as 14
we 14
add 14
anything 14
empirical 14
we 14
detract 14
from 14
their 14
genuine 14
influence 14
and 14
from 14
the 14
absolute 14
value 14
of 14
actions 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
only 14
of 14
the 14
greatest 14
necessity 14
in 14
a 14
purely 14
speculative 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
but 14
is 14
also 14
of 14
the 14
greatest 14
practical 14
importance 14
to 14
derive 14
these 14
notions 14
and 14
laws 14
from 14
pure 14
reason 14
to 14
present 14
them 14
pure 14
and 14
unmixed 14
and 14
even 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
compass 14
of 14
this 14
practical 14
or 14
pure 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
ie 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
whole 14
faculty 14
of 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
and 14
in 14
doing 14
so 14
we 14
must 14
not 14
make 14
its 14
principles 14
dependent 14
on 14
the 14
particular 14
nature 14
of 14
human 14
reason 14
though 14
in 14
speculative 14
philosophy 14
this 14
may 14
be 14
permitted 14
or 14
may 14
even 14
at 14
times 14
be 14
necessary 14
but 14
since 14
moral 14
laws 14
ought 14
to 14
hold 14
good 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
creature 14
we 14
must 14
derive 14
them 14
from 14
the 14
general 14
concept 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
although 14
for 14
its 14
application 14
to 14
man 14
morality 14
has 14
need 14
of 14
anthropology 14
yet 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
instance 14
we 14
must 14
treat 14
it 14
independently 14
as 14
pure 14
philosophy 14
ie 14
as 14
metaphysic 14
complete 14
in 14
itself 14
a 14
thing 14
which 14
in 14
such 14
distinct 14
branches 14
of 14
science 14
is 14
easily 14
done 14
knowing 14
well 14
that 14
unless 14
we 14
are 14
in 14
possession 14
of 14
this 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
only 14
be 14
vain 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
moral 14
element 14
of 14
duty 14
in 14
right 14
actions 14
for 14
purposes 14
of 14
speculative 14
criticism 14
but 14
it 14
would 14
be 14
impossible 14
to 14
base 14
morals 14
on 14
their 14
genuine 14
principles 14
even 14
for 14
common 14
practical 14
purposes 14
especially 14
of 14
moral 14
instruction 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
produce 14
pure 14
moral 14
dispositions 14
and 14
to 14
engraft 14
them 14
on 14
mens 14
minds 14
to 14
the 14
promotion 14
of 14
the 14
greatest 14
possible 14
good 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
but 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
in 14
this 14
study 14
we 14
may 14
not 14
merely 14
advance 14
by 14
the 14
natural 14
steps 14
from 14
the 14
common 14
moral 14
judgement 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
very 14
worthy 14
of 14
respect 14
to 14
the 14
philosophical 14
as 14
has 14
been 14
already 14
done 14
but 14
also 14
from 14
a 14
popular 14
philosophy 14
which 14
goes 14
no 14
further 14
than 14
it 14
can 14
reach 14
by 14
groping 14
with 14
the 14
help 14
of 14
examples 14
to 14
metaphysic 14
which 14
does 14
allow 14
itself 14
to 14
be 14
checked 14
by 14
anything 14
empirical 14
and 14
as 14
it 14
must 14
measure 14
the 14
whole 14
extent 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
of 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
goes 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
ideal 14
conceptions 14
where 14
even 14
examples 14
fail 14
us 14
we 14
must 14
follow 14
and 14
clearly 14
describe 14
the 14
practical 14
faculty 14
of 14
reason 14
from 14
the 14
general 14
rules 14
of 14
its 14
determination 14
to 14
the 14
point 14
where 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
duty 14
springs 14
from 14
it 14
everything 14
in 14
nature 14
works 14
according 14
to 14
laws 14
rational 14
beings 14
alone 14
have 14
the 14
faculty 14
of 14
acting 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
laws 14
that 14
is 14
according 14
to 14
principles 14
ie 14
have 14
a 14
will 14
since 14
the 14
deduction 14
of 14
actions 14
from 14
principles 14
requires 14
reason 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
nothing 14
but 14
practical 14
reason 14
if 14
reason 14
infallibly 14
determines 14
the 14
will 14
then 14
the 14
actions 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
being 14
which 14
are 14
recognised 14
as 14
objectively 14
necessary 14
are 14
subjectively 14
necessary 14
also 14
ie 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
a 14
faculty 14
to 14
choose 14
that 14
only 14
which 14
reason 14
independent 14
of 14
inclination 14
recognises 14
as 14
practically 14
necessary 14
ie 14
as 14
good 14
but 14
if 14
reason 14
of 14
itself 14
does 14
not 14
sufficiently 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
if 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
subject 14
also 14
to 14
subjective 14
conditions 14
particular 14
impulses 14
which 14

from 14

which 14
does 14
not 14
always 14

to 14
do 14
it 14

practically 14
good 14
however 14
which 14
determines 14
the 14

by 14
means 14
of 14
the 14
conceptions 14
of 14
reason 14

consequently 14
not 14
from 14
subjective 14

objectively 14
that 14

are 14
valid 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14

such 14
it 14
is 14
distinguished 14
from 14
the 14

as 14
that 14
which 14
influences 14
the 14

only 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
sensation 14
from 14
merely 14
subjective 14
causes 14
valid 14
only 14
for 14
the 14
sense 14
of 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
one 14
and 14
not 14
as 14
a 14
principle 14
of 14
reason 14
which 14
holds 14
for 14
every 14
one 14
the 14
dependence 14
of 14
the 14
desires 14
on 14
sensations 14
is 14
called 14
inclination 14
and 14
this 14
accordingly 14
always 14
indicates 14
a 14
want 14
the 14
dependence 14
of 14
a 14
contingently 14
determinable 14
will 14
on 14
principles 14
of 14
reason 14
is 14
called 14
an 14
interest 14
this 14
therefore 14
is 14
found 14
only 14
in 14
the 14
case 14
of 14
a 14
dependent 14
will 14
which 14
does 14
not 14
always 14
of 14
itself 14
conform 14
to 14
reason 14
in 14
the 14
divine 14
will 14
we 14
cannot 14
conceive 14
any 14
interest 14
but 14
the 14
human 14
will 14
can 14
also 14
take 14
an 14
interest 14
in 14
a 14
thing 14
without 14
therefore 14
acting 14
from 14
interest 14
the 14
former 14
signifies 14
the 14
practical 14
interest 14
in 14
the 14
action 14
the 14
latter 14
the 14
pathological 14
in 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
the 14
former 14
indicates 14
only 14
dependence 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
on 14
principles 14
of 14
reason 14
in 14
themselves 14
the 14
second 14
dependence 14
on 14
principles 14
of 14
reason 14
for 14
the 14
sake 14
of 14
inclination 14
reason 14
supplying 14
only 14
the 14
practical 14
rules 14
how 14
the 14
requirement 14
of 14
the 14
inclination 14
may 14
be 14
satisfied 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
case 14
the 14
action 14
interests 14
me 14
in 14
the 14
second 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
pleasant 14
to 14
me 14
we 14
have 14
seen 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
section 14
that 14
in 14
an 14
action 14
done 14
from 14
duty 14
we 14
must 14
look 14
not 14
to 14
the 14
interest 14
in 14
the 14
object 14
but 14
only 14
to 14
that 14
in 14
the 14
action 14
itself 14
and 14
in 14
its 14
rational 14
principle 14
viz 14
the 14
law 14
a 14
perfectly 14
good 14
will 14
would 14
therefore 14
be 14
equally 14
subject 14
to 14
objective 14
laws 14
viz 14
laws 14
of 14
good 14
but 14
could 14
not 14
be 14
conceived 14
as 14
obliged 14
thereby 14
to 14
act 14
lawfully 14
because 14
of 14
itself 14
from 14
its 14
subjective 14
constitution 14
it 14
can 14
only 14
be 14
determined 14
by 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
good 14
therefore 14
no 14
imperatives 14
hold 14
for 14
the 14
divine 14
will 14
or 14
in 14
general 14
for 14
a 14
holy 14
will 14
ought 14
is 14
here 14
out 14
of 14
place 14
because 14
the 14
volition 14
is 14
already 14
of 14
itself 14
necessarily 14
in 14
unison 14
with 14
the 14
law 14
therefore 14
imperatives 14
are 14
only 14
formulae 14
to 14
express 14
the 14
relation 14
of 14
objective 14
laws 14
of 14
all 14
volition 14
to 14
the 14
subjective 14
imperfection 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
rational 14
being 14
eg 14
the 14
human 14
will 14
now 14
all 14
imperatives 14
command 14
either 14
hypothetically 14
or 14
categorically 14
the 14
former 14
represent 14
the 14
practical 14
necessity 14
of 14
a 14
possible 14
action 14
as 14
means 14
to 14
something 14
else 14
that 14
is 14
willed 14
or 14
at 14
least 14
which 14
one 14
might 14
possibly 14
will 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
would 14
be 14
that 14
which 14
represented 14
an 14
action 14
as 14
necessary 14
of 14
itself 14
without 14
reference 14
to 14
another 14
end 14
ie 14
as 14
objectively 14
necessary 14
since 14
every 14
practical 14
law 14
represents 14
a 14
possible 14
action 14
as 14
good 14
and 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
for 14
a 14
subject 14
who 14
is 14
practically 14
determinable 14
by 14
reason 14
necessary 14
all 14
imperatives 14
are 14
formulae 14
determining 14
an 14
action 14
which 14
is 14
necessary 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
good 14
in 14
some 14
respects 14
if 14
now 14
the 14
action 14
is 14
good 14
only 14
as 14
a 14
means 14
to 14
something 14
else 14
then 14
the 14
imperative 14
is 14
hypothetical 14
if 14
it 14
is 14
conceived 14
as 14
good 14
in 14
itself 14
and 14
consequently 14
as 14
being 14
necessarily 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
of 14
itself 14
conforms 14
to 14
reason 14
then 14
it 14
is 14
categorical 14
thus 14
the 14
imperative 14
declares 14
what 14
action 14
possible 14
by 14
me 14
would 14
be 14
good 14
and 14
presents 14
the 14
practical 14
rule 14
in 14
relation 14
to 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
does 14
not 14
forthwith 14
perform 14
an 14
action 14
simply 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
good 14
whether 14
because 14
the 14
subject 14
does 14
not 14
always 14
know 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
good 14
or 14
because 14
even 14
if 14
it 14
know 14
this 14
yet 14
its 14
maxims 14
might 14
be 14
opposed 14
to 14
the 14
objective 14
principles 14
of 14
practical 14
reason 14
accordingly 14
the 14
hypothetical 14
imperative 14
only 14
says 14
that 14
the 14
action 14
is 14
good 14
for 14
some 14
purpose 14
possible 14
or 14
actual 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
case 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
problematical 14
in 14
the 14
second 14
an 14
assertorial 14
practical 14
principle 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
which 14
declares 14
an 14
action 14
to 14
be 14
objectively 14
necessary 14
in 14
itself 14
without 14
reference 14
to 14
any 14
purpose 14
ie 14
without 14
any 14
other 14
end 14
is 14
valid 14
as 14
an 14
apodeictic 14
practical 14
principle 14
whatever 14
is 14
possible 14
only 14
by 14
the 14
power 14
of 14
some 14
rational 14
being 14
may 14
also 14
be 14
conceived 14
as 14
a 14
possible 14
purpose 14
of 14
some 14
will 14
and 14
therefore 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
action 14
as 14

the 14
means 14
necessary 14
to 14
attain 14
some 14
possible 14
purpose 14
are 14
in 14
fact 14
infinitely 14
numerous 14
all 14
sciences 14
have 14
a 14
practical 14
part 14
consisting 14
of 14
problems 14
expressing 14
that 14
some 14
end 14
is 14
possible 14
for 14
us 14
and 14
of 14
imperatives 14
directing 14
how 14
it 14
may 14
be 14
attained 14
these 14
may 14
therefore 14
be 14
called 14
in 14
general 14
imperatives 14
of 14
skill 14
here 14
there 14
is 14
no 14
question 14
whether 14
the 14
end 14
is 14
rational 14
and 14

only 14

their 14
children 14
taught 14
a 14
great 14
many 14
things 14
and 14
provide 14
for 14
their 14
skill 14
in 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
means 14
for 14
all 14
sorts 14
of 14
arbitrary 14
ends 14
of 14
none 14
of 14

can 14
they 14
determine 14
whether 14
it 14
may 14
not 14
perhaps 14
hereafter 14
be 14
an 14
object 14
to 14
their 14
pupil 14
but 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
at 14
all 14
events 14
possible 14
that 14
he 14
might 14
aim 14
at 14
and 14
this 14
anxiety 14
is 14
so 14
great 14
that 14
they 14
commonly 14
neglect 14
to 14
form 14
and 14
correct 14
their 14
judgement 14
on 14
the 14
value 14
of 14
the 14
things 14
which 14
may 14
be 14
chosen 14
as 14
ends 14
there 14
is 14
one 14
end 14
however 14
which 14
may 14
be 14
assumed 14
to 14
be 14
actually 14
such 14
to 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
imperatives 14
apply 14
to 14
them 14
viz 14
as 14
dependent 14
beings 14
and 14
therefore 14
one 14
purpose 14
which 14
they 14
not 14
merely 14
may 14
have 14
but 14
which 14
we 14
may 14
with 14

a 14
natural 14
necessity 14
and 14
this 14
is 14
happiness 14
the 14
hypothetical 14
imperative 14
which 14
expresses 14
the 14
practical 14
necessity 14
of 14
an 14
action 14
as 14
means 14
to 14
the 14
advancement 14
of 14
happiness 14
is 14
assertorial 14
we 14
are 14
not 14
to 14
present 14
it 14
as 14
necessary 14
for 14
an 14
uncertain 14
and 14
merely 14
possible 14
purpose 14
but 14
for 14
a 14
purpose 14
which 14
we 14
may 14
presuppose 14
with 14
certainty 14
and 14
a 14
priori 14
in 14
every 14
man 14
because 14
it 14
belongs 14
to 14
his 14
being 14
now 14
skill 14
in 14
the 14
choice 14
of 14
means 14
to 14
his 14
own 14
greatest 14
wellbeing 14
may 14
be 14
called 14
prudence 14
in 14
the 14
narrowest 14
sense 14
and 14
thus 14
the 14
imperative 14
which 14
refers 14
to 14
the 14
choice 14
of 14
means 14
to 14
ones 14
own 14
happiness 14
ie 14
the 14
precept 14
of 14
prudence 14
is 14
still 14
always 14
hypothetical 14
the 14
action 14
is 14
not 14
commanded 14
absolutely 14
but 14
only 14
as 14
means 14
to 14
another 14
purpose 14
the 14
word 14
prudence 14
is 14
taken 14
in 14
two 14
senses 14
in 14
the 14
one 14
it 14
may 14
bear 14
the 14
name 14
of 14
knowledge 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
in 14
the 14
other 14
that 14
of 14
private 14
prudence 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
a 14
mans 14
ability 14
to 14
influence 14
others 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
use 14
them 14
for 14
his 14
own 14
purposes 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
the 14
sagacity 14
to 14
combine 14
all 14
these 14
purposes 14
for 14
his 14
own 14
lasting 14
benefit 14
this 14
latter 14
is 14
properly 14
that 14
to 14
which 14
the 14
value 14
even 14
of 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
reduced 14
and 14
when 14
a 14
man 14
is 14
prudent 14
in 14
the 14
former 14
sense 14
but 14
not 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
we 14
might 14
better 14
say 14
of 14
him 14
that 14
he 14
is 14
clever 14
and 14
cunning 14
but 14
on 14
the 14
whole 14
imprudent 14
finally 14
there 14
is 14
an 14
imperative 14
which 14
commands 14
a 14
certain 14
conduct 14
immediately 14
without 14
having 14
as 14
its 14
condition 14
any 14
other 14
purpose 14
to 14
be 14
attained 14
by 14
it 14
this 14
imperative 14
is 14
categorical 14
it 14
concerns 14
not 14
the 14
matter 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
or 14
its 14
intended 14
result 14
but 14
its 14
form 14
and 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
itself 14
a 14
result 14
and 14
what 14
is 14
essentially 14
good 14
in 14
it 14
consists 14
in 14
the 14
mental 14
disposition 14
let 14
the 14
consequence 14
be 14
what 14
it 14
may 14
this 14
imperative 14
may 14
be 14
called 14
that 14
of 14
morality 14
there 14
is 14
a 14
marked 14
distinction 14
also 14
between 14
the 14
volitions 14
on 14
these 14
three 14
sorts 14
of 14
principles 14
in 14
the 14
dissimilarity 14
of 14
the 14
obligation 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
mark 14
this 14
difference 14
more 14
clearly 14
i 14
think 14
they 14
would 14
be 14
most 14
suitably 14
named 14
in 14
their 14
order 14
if 14
we 14
said 14
they 14
are 14
either 14
rules 14
of 14
skill 14
or 14
counsels 14
of 14
prudence 14
or 14
commands 14
laws 14
of 14
morality 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
law 14
only 14
that 14
involves 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
an 14
unconditional 14
and 14
objective 14
necessity 14
which 14
is 14
consequently 14
universally 14
valid 14
and 14
commands 14
are 14
laws 14
which 14
must 14
be 14
obeyed 14
that 14
is 14
must 14
be 14
followed 14
even 14
in 14
opposition 14
to 14
inclination 14
counsels 14
indeed 14
involve 14
necessity 14
but 14
one 14
which 14
can 14
only 14
hold 14
under 14
a 14
contingent 14
subjective 14
condition 14
viz 14
they 14
depend 14
on 14
whether 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
man 14
reckons 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
as 14
part 14
of 14
his 14
happiness 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
is 14
not 14
limited 14
by 14
any 14
condition 14
and 14
as 14
being 14
absolutely 14
although 14
practically 14
necessary 14
may 14
be 14
quite 14
properly 14
called 14
a 14
command 14
we 14
might 14
also 14
call 14
the 14
first 14
kind 14
of 14
imperatives 14
technical 14
belonging 14
to 14
art 14
the 14
second 14
pragmatic 14
to 14
welfare 14
the 14
third 14
moral 14
belonging 14
to 14
free 14
conduct 14
generally 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
morals 14
it 14
seems 14
to 14
me 14
that 14
the 14
proper 14
signification 14
of 14
the 14
word 14
pragmatic 14
may 14
be 14
most 14
accurately 14
defined 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
for 14
sanctions 14
are 14
called 14
pragmatic 14
which 14
flow 14
properly 14
not 14
from 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
the 14
states 14
as 14
necessary 14
enactments 14
but 14
from 14
precaution 14
for 14
the 14
general 14
welfare 14
a 14
history 14
is 14
composed 14
pragmatically 14
when 14
it 14
teaches 14
prudence 14
ie 14
instructs 14
the 14
world 14
how 14
it 14
can 14
provide 14
for 14
its 14
interests 14
better 14
or 14
at 14
least 14
as 14
well 14
as 14
the 14
men 14
of 14
former 14
time 14
now 14
arises 14
the 14
question 14
how 14
are 14
all 14
these 14
imperatives 14
possible 14
this 14
question 14
does 14
not 14
seek 14
to 14
know 14
how 14
we 14
can 14
conceive 14
the 14
accomplishment 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
which 14
the 14
imperative 14
ordains 14
but 14
merely 14
how 14
we 14
can 14
conceive 14
the 14
obligation 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
which 14
the 14
imperative 14
expresses 14
no 14
special 14
explanation 14
is 14
needed 14
to 14
show 14
how 14
an 14
imperative 14
of 14
skill 14
is 14
possible 14
whoever 14
wills 14
the 14
end 14
wills 14
also 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
reason 14
decides 14
his 14
conduct 14
the 14
means 14
in 14
his 14
power 14
which 14
are 14
indispensably 14
necessary 14
thereto 14
this 14
proposition 14
is 14
as 14
regards 14
the 14
volition 14
analytical 14
for 14
in 14
willing 14
an 14
object 14
as 14
my 14
effect 14
there 14
is 14
already 14
thought 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
myself 14
as 14
an 14
acting 14
cause 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
the 14
means 14
and 14
the 14
imperative 14
educes 14
from 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
volition 14
of 14
an 14
end 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
actions 14
necessary 14
to 14
this 14
end 14
synthetical 14
propositions 14
must 14
no 14
doubt 14
be 14
employed 14
in 14
defining 14
the 14
means 14
to 14
a 14
proposed 14
end 14
but 14
they 14
do 14
not 14
concern 14
the 14
principle 14
the 14
act 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
but 14
the 14
object 14
and 14
its 14
realization 14
eg 14
that 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
bisect 14
a 14
line 14
on 14
an 14
unerring 14
principle 14
i 14
must 14
draw 14
from 14
its 14
extremities 14
two 14
intersecting 14
arcs 14
this 14
no 14
doubt 14
is 14
taught 14
by 14
mathematics 14
only 14
in 14
synthetical 14
propositions 14
but 14
if 14
i 14
know 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
only 14
by 14
this 14
process 14
that 14
the 14
intended 14
operation 14
can 14
be 14
performed 14
then 14
to 14
say 14
that 14
if 14
i 14
fully 14
will 14
the 14
operation 14
i 14
also 14
will 14
the 14
action 14
required 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
analytical 14
proposition 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
one 14
and 14
the 14
same 14
thing 14
to 14
conceive 14
something 14
as 14
an 14
effect 14
which 14
i 14
can 14
produce 14
in 14
a 14
certain 14
way 14
and 14
to 14
conceive 14
myself 14
as 14
acting 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
if 14
it 14
were 14
only 14
equally 14
easy 14
to 14
give 14
a 14
definite 14
conception 14
of 14
happiness 14
the 14
imperatives 14
of 14
prudence 14
would 14
correspond 14
exactly 14
with 14
those 14
of 14
skill 14
and 14
would 14
likewise 14
be 14
analytical 14
for 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
as 14
in 14
that 14
it 14
could 14
be 14
said 14
whoever 14
wills 14
the 14
end 14
wills 14
also 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
dictate 14
of 14
reason 14
necessarily 14
the 14
indispensable 14
means 14
thereto 14
which 14
are 14
in 14
his 14
power 14
but 14
unfortunately 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
happiness 14
is 14
so 14
indefinite 14
that 14
although 14
every 14
man 14
wishes 14
to 14
attain 14
it 14
yet 14
he 14
never 14
can 14
say 14
definitely 14
and 14
consistently 14
what 14
it 14
is 14
that 14
he 14
really 14
wishes 14
and 14
wills 14
the 14
reason 14
of 14
this 14
is 14
that 14
all 14
the 14
elements 14
which 14
belong 14
to 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
happiness 14
are 14
altogether 14
empirical 14
ie 14
they 14
must 14
be 14
borrowed 14
from 14
experience 14
and 14
nevertheless 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
happiness 14
requires 14
an 14
absolute 14
whole 14
a 14
maximum 14
of 14
welfare 14
in 14
my 14
present 14
and 14
all 14
future 14
circumstances 14
now 14
it 14
is 14
impossible 14
that 14
the 14
most 14
clearsighted 14
and 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
most 14
powerful 14
being 14
supposed 14
finite 14
should 14
frame 14
to 14
himself 14
a 14
definite 14
conception 14
of 14
what 14
he 14
really 14
wills 14
in 14
this 14
does 14
he 14
will 14
riches 14
how 14
much 14
anxiety 14
envy 14
and 14
snares 14
might 14
he 14
not 14
thereby 14
draw 14
upon 14
his 14
shoulders 14
does 14
he 14
will 14
knowledge 14
and 14
discernment 14
perhaps 14
it 14
might 14
prove 14
to 14
be 14
only 14
an 14
eye 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
sharper 14
to 14
show 14
him 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
more 14
fearfully 14
the 14
evils 14
that 14
are 14
now 14
concealed 14
from 14
him 14
and 14
that 14
cannot 14
be 14
avoided 14
or 14
to 14
impose 14
more 14
wants 14
on 14
his 14
desires 14
which 14
already 14
give 14
him 14
concern 14
enough 14
would 14
he 14
have 14
long 14
life 14
who 14
guarantees 14
to 14
him 14
that 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
a 14
long 14
misery 14
would 14
he 14
at 14
least 14
have 14
health 14
how 14
often 14
has 14
uneasiness 14
of 14
the 14
body 14
restrained 14
from 14
excesses 14
into 14
which 14
perfect 14
health 14
would 14
have 14
allowed 14
one 14
to 14
fall 14
and 14
so 14
on 14
in 14
short 14
he 14
is 14
unable 14
on 14
any 14
principle 14
to 14
determine 14
with 14
certainty 14
what 14
would 14
make 14
him 14
truly 14
happy 14
because 14
to 14
do 14
so 14
he 14
would 14
need 14
to 14
be 14
omniscient 14
we 14
cannot 14
therefore 14
act 14
on 14
any 14
definite 14
principles 14
to 14
secure 14
happiness 14
but 14
only 14
on 14
empirical 14
counsels 14
eg 14
of 14
regimen 14
frugality 14
courtesy 14
reserve 14
etc 14
which 14
experience 14
teaches 14
do 14
on 14
the 14
average 14
most 14
promote 14
wellbeing 14
hence 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
the 14
imperatives 14
of 14
prudence 14
do 14
not 14
strictly 14
speaking 14
command 14
at 14
all 14
that 14
is 14
they 14
cannot 14
present 14
actions 14
objectively 14
as 14
practically 14
necessary 14
that 14
they 14
are 14
rather 14
to 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
counsels 14
consilia 14
than 14
precepts 14
precepts 14
of 14
reason 14
that 14
the 14
problem 14
to 14
determine 14
certainly 14
and 14
universally 14
what 14
action 14
would 14
promote 14
the 14
happiness 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
is 14
completely 14
insoluble 14
and 14
consequently 14
no 14
imperative 14
respecting 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
which 14
should 14
in 14
the 14
strict 14
sense 14
command 14
to 14
do 14
what 14
makes 14
happy 14
because 14
happiness 14
is 14
not 14
an 14
ideal 14
of 14
reason 14
but 14
of 14
imagination 14
resting 14
solely 14
on 14
empirical 14
grounds 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
vain 14
to 14
expect 14
that 14
these 14
should 14
define 14
an 14
action 14
by 14
which 14
one 14
could 14
attain 14
the 14
totality 14
of 14
a 14
series 14
of 14
consequences 14
which 14
is 14
really 14
endless 14
this 14
imperative 14
of 14
prudence 14
would 14
however 14
be 14
an 14
analytical 14
proposition 14
if 14
we 14
assume 14
that 14
the 14
means 14
to 14
happiness 14
could 14
be 14
certainly 14
assigned 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
distinguished 14
from 14
the 14
imperative 14
of 14
skill 14
only 14
by 14
this 14
that 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
the 14
end 14
is 14
merely 14
possible 14
in 14
the 14
former 14
it 14
is 14
given 14
as 14
however 14
both 14
only 14
ordain 14
the 14
means 14
to 14
that 14
which 14
we 14
suppose 14
to 14
be 14
willed 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
the 14
imperative 14
which 14
ordains 14
the 14
willing 14
of 14
the 14
means 14
to 14
him 14
who 14
wills 14
the 14
end 14
is 14
in 14
both 14
cases 14
analytical 14
thus 14
there 14
is 14
no 14
difficulty 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
an 14
imperative 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
either 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
the 14
question 14
how 14
the 14
imperative 14
of 14
morality 14
is 14
possible 14
is 14
undoubtedly 14
one 14
the 14
only 14
one 14
demanding 14
a 14
solution 14
as 14
this 14
is 14
not 14
at 14
all 14
hypothetical 14
and 14
the 14
objective 14
necessity 14
which 14
it 14
presents 14
cannot 14
rest 14
on 14
any 14
hypothesis 14
as 14
is 14
the 14
case 14
with 14
the 14
hypothetical 14
imperatives 14
only 14
here 14
we 14
must 14
never 14
leave 14
out 14
of 14
consideration 14
that 14
we 14
cannot 14
make 14
out 14
by 14
any 14
example 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
empirically 14
whether 14
there 14
is 14
such 14
an 14
imperative 14
at 14
all 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
rather 14
to 14
be 14
feared 14
that 14
all 14
those 14
which 14
seem 14
to 14
be 14
categorical 14
may 14
yet 14
be 14
at 14
bottom 14
hypothetical 14
for 14
instance 14
when 14
the 14
precept 14
is 14
thou 14
shalt 14
not 14
promise 14
deceitfully 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
assumed 14
that 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
this 14
is 14
not 14
a 14
mere 14
counsel 14
to 14
avoid 14
some 14
other 14
evil 14
so 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
mean 14
thou 14
shalt 14
not 14
make 14
a 14
lying 14
promise 14
lest 14
if 14
it 14
become 14
known 14
thou 14
shouldst 14
destroy 14
thy 14
credit 14
but 14
that 14
an 14
action 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
must 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
evil 14
in 14
itself 14
so 14
that 14
the 14
imperative 14
of 14
the 14
prohibition 14
is 14
categorical 14
then 14
we 14
cannot 14
show 14
with 14
certainty 14
in 14
any 14
example 14
that 14
the 14
will 14
was 14
determined 14
merely 14
by 14
the 14
law 14
without 14
any 14
other 14
spring 14
of 14
action 14
although 14
it 14
may 14
appear 14
to 14
be 14
so 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
always 14
possible 14
that 14
fear 14
of 14
disgrace 14
perhaps 14
also 14
obscure 14
dread 14
of 14
other 14
dangers 14
may 14
have 14
a 14
secret 14
influence 14
on 14
the 14
will 14
who 14
can 14
prove 14
by 14
experience 14
the 14
nonexistence 14
of 14
a 14
cause 14
when 14
all 14
that 14
experience 14
tells 14
us 14
is 14
that 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
perceive 14
it 14
but 14
in 14
such 14
a 14
case 14
the 14
socalled 14
moral 14
imperative 14
which 14
as 14
such 14
appears 14
to 14
be 14
categorical 14
and 14
unconditional 14
would 14
in 14
reality 14
be 14
only 14
a 14
pragmatic 14
precept 14
drawing 14
our 14
attention 14
to 14
our 14
own 14
interests 14
and 14
merely 14
teaching 14
us 14
to 14
take 14
these 14
into 14
consideration 14
we 14
shall 14
therefore 14
have 14
to 14
investigate 14
a 14
priori 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
as 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
the 14
advantage 14
of 14
its 14
reality 14
being 14
given 14
in 14
experience 14
so 14
that 14
the 14
elucidation 14
of 14
its 14
possibility 14
should 14
be 14
requisite 14
only 14
for 14
its 14
explanation 14
not 14
for 14
its 14
establishment 14
in 14
the 14
meantime 14
it 14
may 14
be 14
discerned 14
beforehand 14
that 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
alone 14
has 14
the 14
purport 14
of 14
a 14
practical 14
law 14
all 14
the 14
rest 14
may 14
indeed 14
be 14
called 14
principles 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
but 14
not 14
laws 14
since 14
whatever 14
is 14
only 14
necessary 14
for 14
the 14
attainment 14
of 14
some 14
arbitrary 14
purpose 14
may 14
be 14
considered 14
as 14
in 14
itself 14
contingent 14
and 14
we 14
can 14
at 14
any 14
time 14
be 14
free 14
from 14
the 14
precept 14
if 14
we 14
give 14
up 14
the 14
purpose 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
the 14
unconditional 14
command 14
leaves 14
the 14
will 14
no 14
liberty 14
to 14
choose 14
the 14
opposite 14
consequently 14
it 14
alone 14
carries 14
with 14
it 14
that 14
necessity 14
which 14
we 14
require 14
in 14
a 14
law 14
secondly 14
in 14
the 14
case 14
of 14
this 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
or 14
law 14
of 14
morality 14
the 14
difficulty 14
of 14
discerning 14
its 14
possibility 14
is 14
a 14
very 14
profound 14
one 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
a 14
priori 14
synthetical 14
practical 14
proposition 14
and 14
as 14
there 14
is 14
so 14
much 14
difficulty 14
in 14
discerning 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
speculative 14
propositions 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
it 14
may 14
readily 14
be 14
supposed 14
that 14
the 14
difficulty 14
will 14
be 14
no 14
less 14
with 14
the 14
practical 14
i 14
connect 14
the 14
act 14
with 14
the 14
will 14
without 14
presupposing 14
any 14
condition 14
resulting 14
from 14
any 14
inclination 14
but 14
a 14
priori 14
and 14
therefore 14
necessarily 14
though 14
only 14
objectively 14
ie 14
assuming 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
reason 14
possessing 14
full 14
power 14
over 14
all 14
subjective 14
motives 14
this 14
is 14
accordingly 14
a 14
practical 14
proposition 14
which 14
does 14
not 14
deduce 14
the 14
willing 14
of 14
an 14
action 14
by 14
mere 14
analysis 14
from 14
another 14
already 14
presupposed 14
for 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
such 14
a 14
perfect 14
will 14
but 14
connects 14
it 14
immediately 14
with 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
something 14
not 14
contained 14
in 14
it 14
in 14
this 14
problem 14
we 14
will 14
first 14
inquire 14
whether 14
the 14
mere 14
conception 14
of 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
may 14
not 14
perhaps 14
supply 14
us 14
also 14
with 14
the 14
formula 14
of 14
it 14
containing 14
the 14
proposition 14
which 14
alone 14
can 14
be 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
for 14
even 14
if 14
we 14
know 14
the 14
tenor 14
of 14
such 14
an 14
absolute 14
command 14
yet 14
how 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
will 14
require 14
further 14
special 14
and 14
laborious 14
study 14
which 14
we 14
postpone 14
to 14
the 14
last 14
section 14
when 14
i 14
conceive 14
a 14
hypothetical 14
imperative 14
in 14
general 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
know 14
beforehand 14
what 14
it 14
will 14
contain 14
until 14
i 14
am 14
given 14
the 14
condition 14
but 14
when 14
i 14
conceive 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
i 14
know 14
at 14
once 14
what 14
it 14
contains 14
for 14
as 14
the 14
imperative 14
contains 14
besides 14
the 14
law 14
only 14
the 14
necessity 14
that 14
the 14
maxims 14
shall 14
conform 14
to 14
this 14
law 14
while 14
the 14
law 14
contains 14
no 14
conditions 14
restricting 14
it 14
there 14
remains 14
nothing 14
but 14
the 14
general 14
statement 14
that 14
the 14
maxim 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
should 14
conform 14
to 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
this 14
conformity 14
alone 14
that 14
the 14
imperative 14
properly 14
represents 14
as 14
necessary 14
a 14
maxim 14
is 14
a 14
subjective 14
principle 14
of 14
action 14
and 14
must 14
be 14
distinguished 14
from 14
the 14
objective 14
principle 14
namely 14
practical 14
law 14
the 14
former 14
contains 14
the 14
practical 14
rule 14
set 14
by 14
reason 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
conditions 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
often 14
its 14
ignorance 14
or 14
its 14
inclinations 14
so 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
the 14
principle 14
on 14
which 14
the 14
subject 14
acts 14
but 14
the 14
law 14
is 14
the 14
objective 14
principle 14
valid 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
and 14
is 14
the 14
principle 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
ought 14
to 14
act 14
that 14
is 14
an 14
imperative 14
there 14
is 14
therefore 14
but 14
one 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
namely 14
this 14
act 14
only 14
on 14
that 14
maxim 14
whereby 14
thou 14
canst 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
will 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
become 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
now 14
if 14
all 14
imperatives 14
of 14
duty 14
can 14
be 14
deduced 14
from 14
this 14
one 14
imperative 14
as 14
from 14
their 14
principle 14
then 14
although 14
it 14
should 14
remain 14
undecided 14
what 14
is 14
called 14
duty 14
is 14
not 14
merely 14
a 14
vain 14
notion 14
yet 14
at 14
least 14
we 14
shall 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
show 14
what 14
we 14
understand 14
by 14
it 14
and 14
what 14
this 14
notion 14
means 14
since 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
the 14
law 14
according 14
to 14
which 14
effects 14
are 14
produced 14
constitutes 14
what 14
is 14
properly 14
called 14
nature 14
in 14
the 14
most 14
general 14
sense 14
as 14
to 14
form 14
that 14
is 14
the 14
existence 14
of 14
things 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
determined 14
by 14
general 14
laws 14
the 14
imperative 14
of 14
duty 14
may 14
be 14
expressed 14
thus 14
act 14
as 14
if 14
the 14
maxim 14
of 14
thy 14
action 14
were 14
to 14
become 14
by 14
thy 14
will 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
we 14
will 14
now 14
enumerate 14
a 14
few 14
duties 14
adopting 14
the 14
usual 14
division 14
of 14
them 14
into 14
duties 14
to 14
ourselves 14
and 14
ourselves 14
and 14
to 14
others 14
and 14
into 14
perfect 14
and 14
imperfect 14
duties 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
noted 14
here 14
that 14
i 14
reserve 14
the 14
division 14
of 14
duties 14
for 14
a 14
future 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
so 14
that 14
i 14
give 14
it 14
here 14
only 14
as 14
an 14
arbitrary 14
one 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
arrange 14
my 14
examples 14
for 14
the 14
rest 14
i 14
understand 14
by 14
a 14
perfect 14
duty 14
one 14
that 14
admits 14
no 14
exception 14
in 14
favour 14
of 14
inclination 14
and 14
then 14
i 14
have 14
not 14
merely 14
external 14
but 14
also 14
internal 14
perfect 14
duties 14
this 14
is 14
contrary 14
to 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
the 14
word 14
adopted 14
in 14
the 14
schools 14
but 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
intend 14
to 14
justify 14
there 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
all 14
one 14
for 14
my 14
purpose 14
whether 14
it 14
is 14
admitted 14
or 14
not 14
a 14
man 14
reduced 14
to 14
despair 14
by 14
a 14
series 14
of 14
misfortunes 14
feels 14
wearied 14
of 14
life 14
but 14
is 14
still 14
so 14
far 14
in 14
possession 14
of 14
his 14
reason 14
that 14
he 14
can 14
ask 14
himself 14
whether 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
contrary 14
to 14
his 14
duty 14
to 14
himself 14
to 14
take 14
his 14
own 14
life 14
now 14
he 14
inquires 14
whether 14
the 14
maxim 14
of 14
his 14
action 14
could 14
become 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
his 14
maxim 14
is 14
from 14
selflove 14
i 14
adopt 14
it 14
as 14
a 14
principle 14
to 14
shorten 14
my 14
life 14
when 14
its 14
longer 14
duration 14
is 14
likely 14
to 14
bring 14
more 14
evil 14
than 14
satisfaction 14
it 14
is 14
asked 14
then 14
simply 14
whether 14
this 14
principle 14
founded 14
on 14
selflove 14
can 14
become 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
now 14
we 14
see 14
at 14
once 14
that 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
of 14
which 14
it 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
law 14
to 14
destroy 14
life 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
the 14
very 14
feeling 14
whose 14
special 14
nature 14
it 14
is 14
to 14
impel 14
to 14
the 14
improvement 14
of 14
life 14
would 14
contradict 14
itself 14
and 14
therefore 14
could 14
not 14
exist 14
as 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
hence 14
that 14
maxim 14
cannot 14
possibly 14
exist 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
consequently 14
would 14
be 14
wholly 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
the 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
all 14
duty 14
another 14
finds 14
himself 14
forced 14
by 14
necessity 14
to 14
borrow 14
money 14
he 14
knows 14
that 14
he 14
will 14
not 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
repay 14
it 14
but 14
sees 14
also 14
that 14
nothing 14
will 14
be 14
lent 14
to 14
him 14
unless 14
he 14
promises 14
stoutly 14
to 14
repay 14
it 14
in 14
a 14
definite 14
time 14
he 14
desires 14
to 14
make 14
this 14
promise 14
but 14
he 14
has 14
still 14
so 14
much 14
conscience 14
as 14
to 14
ask 14
himself 14
is 14
it 14
not 14
unlawful 14
and 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
duty 14
to 14
get 14
out 14
of 14
a 14
difficulty 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
suppose 14
however 14
that 14
he 14
resolves 14
to 14
do 14
so 14
then 14
the 14
maxim 14
of 14
his 14
action 14
would 14
be 14
expressed 14
thus 14
when 14
i 14
think 14
myself 14
in 14
want 14
of 14
money 14
i 14
will 14
borrow 14
money 14
and 14
promise 14
to 14
repay 14
it 14
although 14
i 14
know 14
that 14
i 14
never 14
can 14
do 14
so 14
now 14
this 14
principle 14
of 14
selflove 14
or 14
of 14
ones 14
own 14
advantage 14
may 14
perhaps 14
be 14
consistent 14
with 14
my 14
whole 14
future 14
welfare 14
but 14
the 14
question 14
now 14
is 14
is 14
it 14
right 14
i 14
change 14
then 14
the 14
suggestion 14
of 14
selflove 14
into 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
and 14
state 14
the 14
question 14
thus 14
how 14
would 14
it 14
be 14
if 14
my 14
maxim 14
were 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
then 14
i 14
see 14
at 14
once 14
that 14
it 14
could 14
never 14
hold 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
but 14
would 14
necessarily 14
contradict 14
itself 14
for 14
supposing 14
it 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
that 14
everyone 14
when 14
he 14
thinks 14
himself 14
in 14
a 14
difficulty 14
should 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
promise 14
whatever 14
he 14
pleases 14
with 14
the 14
purpose 14
of 14
not 14
keeping 14
his 14
promise 14
the 14
promise 14
itself 14
would 14
become 14
impossible 14
as 14
well 14
as 14
the 14
end 14
that 14
one 14
might 14
have 14
in 14
view 14
in 14
it 14
since 14
no 14
one 14
would 14
consider 14
that 14
anything 14
was 14
promised 14
to 14
him 14
but 14
would 14
ridicule 14
all 14
such 14
statements 14
as 14
vain 14
pretences 14
a 14
third 14
finds 14
in 14
himself 14
a 14
talent 14
which 14
with 14
the 14
help 14
of 14
some 14
culture 14
might 14
make 14
him 14
a 14
useful 14
man 14
in 14
many 14
respects 14
but 14
he 14
finds 14
himself 14
in 14
comfortable 14
circumstances 14
and 14
prefers 14
to 14
indulge 14
in 14
pleasure 14
rather 14
than 14
to 14
take 14
pains 14
in 14
enlarging 14
and 14
improving 14
his 14
happy 14
natural 14
capacities 14
he 14
asks 14
however 14
whether 14
his 14
maxim 14
of 14
neglect 14
of 14
his 14
natural 14
gifts 14
besides 14
agreeing 14
with 14
his 14
inclination 14
to 14
indulgence 14
agrees 14
also 14
with 14
what 14
is 14
called 14
duty 14
he 14
sees 14
then 14
that 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
could 14
indeed 14
subsist 14
with 14
such 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
although 14
men 14
like 14
the 14
south 14
sea 14
islanders 14
should 14
let 14
their 14
talents 14
rest 14
and 14
resolve 14
to 14
devote 14
their 14
lives 14
merely 14
to 14
idleness 14
amusement 14
and 14
propagation 14
of 14
their 14
species 14
in 14
a 14
word 14
to 14
enjoyment 14
but 14
he 14
cannot 14
possibly 14
will 14
that 14
this 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
or 14
be 14
implanted 14
in 14
us 14
as 14
such 14
by 14
a 14
natural 14
instinct 14
for 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
he 14
necessarily 14
wills 14
that 14
his 14
faculties 14
be 14
developed 14
since 14
they 14
serve 14
him 14
and 14
have 14
been 14
given 14
him 14
for 14
all 14
sorts 14
of 14
possible 14
purposes 14
a 14
fourth 14
who 14
is 14
in 14
prosperity 14
while 14
he 14
sees 14
that 14
others 14
have 14
to 14
contend 14
with 14
great 14
wretchedness 14
and 14
that 14
he 14
could 14
help 14
them 14
thinks 14
what 14
concern 14
is 14
it 14
of 14
mine 14
let 14
everyone 14
be 14
as 14
happy 14
as 14
heaven 14
pleases 14
or 14
as 14
he 14
can 14
make 14
himself 14
i 14
will 14
take 14
nothing 14
from 14
him 14
nor 14
even 14
envy 14
him 14
only 14
i 14
do 14
not 14
wish 14
to 14
contribute 14
anything 14
to 14
his 14
welfare 14
or 14
to 14
his 14
assistance 14
in 14
distress 14
now 14
no 14
doubt 14
if 14
such 14
a 14
mode 14
of 14
thinking 14
were 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
the 14
human 14
race 14
might 14
very 14
well 14
subsist 14
and 14
doubtless 14
even 14
better 14
than 14
in 14
a 14
state 14
in 14
which 14
everyone 14
talks 14
of 14
sympathy 14
and 14
goodwill 14
or 14
even 14
takes 14
care 14
occasionally 14
to 14
put 14
it 14
into 14
practice 14
but 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
side 14
also 14
cheats 14
when 14
he 14
can 14
betrays 14
the 14
rights 14
of 14
men 14
or 14
otherwise 14
violates 14
them 14
but 14
although 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
that 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
might 14
exist 14
in 14
accordance 14
with 14
that 14
maxim 14
it 14
is 14
impossible 14
to 14
will 14
that 14
such 14
a 14
principle 14
should 14
have 14
the 14
universal 14
validity 14
of 14
a 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
for 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
resolved 14
this 14
would 14
contradict 14
itself 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
many 14
cases 14
might 14
occur 14
in 14
which 14
one 14
would 14
have 14
need 14
of 14
the 14
love 14
and 14
sympathy 14
of 14
others 14
and 14
in 14
which 14
by 14
such 14
a 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
sprung 14
from 14
his 14
own 14
will 14
he 14
would 14
deprive 14
himself 14
of 14
all 14
hope 14
of 14
the 14
aid 14
he 14
desires 14
these 14
are 14
a 14
few 14
of 14
the 14
many 14
actual 14
duties 14
or 14
at 14
least 14
what 14
we 14
regard 14
as 14
such 14
which 14
obviously 14
fall 14
into 14
two 14
classes 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
principle 14
that 14
we 14
have 14
laid 14
down 14
we 14
must 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
will 14
that 14
a 14
maxim 14
of 14
our 14
action 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
this 14
is 14
the 14
canon 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
appreciation 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
generally 14
some 14
actions 14
are 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
character 14
that 14
their 14
maxim 14
cannot 14
without 14
contradiction 14
be 14
even 14
conceived 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
far 14
from 14
it 14
being 14
possible 14
that 14
we 14
should 14
will 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
be 14
so 14
in 14
others 14
this 14
intrinsic 14
impossibility 14
is 14
not 14
found 14
but 14
still 14
it 14
is 14
impossible 14
to 14
will 14
that 14
their 14
maxim 14
should 14
be 14
raised 14
to 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
a 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
since 14
such 14
a 14
will 14
would 14
contradict 14
itself 14
it 14
is 14
easily 14
seen 14
that 14
the 14
former 14
violate 14
strict 14
or 14
rigorous 14
inflexible 14
duty 14
the 14
latter 14
only 14
laxer 14
meritorious 14
duty 14
thus 14
it 14
has 14
been 14
completely 14
shown 14
how 14
all 14
duties 14
depend 14
as 14
regards 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
obligation 14
not 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
on 14
the 14
same 14
principle 14
if 14
now 14
we 14
attend 14
to 14
ourselves 14
on 14
occasion 14
of 14
any 14
transgression 14
of 14
duty 14
we 14
shall 14
find 14
that 14
we 14
in 14
fact 14
do 14
not 14
will 14
that 14
our 14
maxim 14
should 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
that 14
is 14
impossible 14
for 14
us 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
we 14
will 14
that 14
the 14
opposite 14
should 14
remain 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
only 14
we 14
assume 14
the 14
liberty 14
of 14
making 14
an 14
exception 14
in 14
our 14
own 14
favour 14
or 14
just 14
for 14
this 14
time 14
only 14
in 14
favour 14
of 14
our 14
inclination 14
consequently 14
if 14
we 14
considered 14
all 14
cases 14
from 14
one 14
and 14
the 14
same 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
namely 14
that 14
of 14
reason 14
we 14
should 14
find 14
a 14
contradiction 14
in 14
our 14
own 14
will 14
namely 14
that 14
a 14
certain 14
principle 14
should 14
be 14
objectively 14
necessary 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
and 14
yet 14
subjectively 14
should 14
not 14
be 14
universal 14
but 14
admit 14
of 14
exceptions 14
as 14
however 14
we 14
at 14
one 14
moment 14
regard 14
our 14
action 14
from 14
the 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
wholly 14
conformed 14
to 14
reason 14
and 14
then 14
again 14
look 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
action 14
from 14
the 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
affected 14
by 14
inclination 14
there 14
is 14
not 14
really 14
any 14
contradiction 14
but 14
an 14
antagonism 14
of 14
inclination 14
to 14
the 14
precept 14
of 14
reason 14
whereby 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
the 14
principle 14
is 14
changed 14
into 14
a 14
mere 14
generality 14
so 14
that 14
the 14
practical 14
principle 14
of 14
reason 14
shall 14
meet 14
the 14
maxim 14
half 14
way 14
now 14
although 14
this 14
cannot 14
be 14
justified 14
in 14
our 14
own 14
impartial 14
judgement 14
yet 14
it 14
proves 14
that 14
we 14
do 14
really 14
recognise 14
the 14
validity 14
of 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
and 14
with 14
all 14
respect 14
for 14
it 14
only 14
allow 14
ourselves 14
a 14
few 14
exceptions 14
which 14
we 14
think 14
unimportant 14
and 14
forced 14
from 14
us 14
we 14
have 14
thus 14
established 14
at 14
least 14
this 14
much 14
that 14
if 14
duty 14
is 14
a 14
conception 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
have 14
any 14
import 14
and 14
real 14
legislative 14
authority 14
for 14
our 14
actions 14
it 14
can 14
only 14
be 14
expressed 14
in 14
categorical 14
and 14
not 14
at 14
all 14
in 14
hypothetical 14
imperatives 14
we 14
have 14
also 14
which 14
is 14
of 14
great 14
importance 14
exhibited 14
clearly 14
and 14
definitely 14
for 14
every 14
practical 14
application 14
the 14
content 14
of 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
which 14
must 14
contain 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
all 14
duty 14
if 14
there 14
is 14
such 14
a 14
thing 14
at 14
all 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
yet 14
however 14
advanced 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
to 14
prove 14
a 14
priori 14
that 14
there 14
actually 14
is 14
such 14
an 14
imperative 14
that 14
there 14
is 14
a 14
practical 14
law 14
which 14
commands 14
absolutely 14
of 14
itself 14
and 14
without 14
any 14
other 14
impulse 14
and 14
that 14
the 14
following 14
of 14
this 14
law 14
is 14
duty 14
with 14
the 14
view 14
of 14
attaining 14
to 14
this 14
it 14
is 14
of 14
extreme 14
importance 14
to 14
remember 14
that 14
we 14
must 14
not 14
allow 14
ourselves 14
to 14
think 14
of 14
deducing 14
the 14
reality 14
of 14
this 14
principle 14
from 14
the 14
particular 14
attributes 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
for 14
duty 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
practical 14
unconditional 14
necessity 14
of 14
action 14
it 14
must 14
therefore 14
hold 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
to 14
whom 14
an 14
imperative 14
can 14
apply 14
at 14
all 14
and 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
only 14
be 14
also 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
all 14
human 14
wills 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
whatever 14
is 14
deduced 14
from 14
the 14
particular 14
natural 14
characteristics 14
of 14
humanity 14
from 14
certain 14
feelings 14
and 14
propensions 14
nay 14
even 14
if 14
possible 14
from 14
any 14
particular 14
tendency 14
proper 14
to 14
human 14
reason 14
and 14
which 14
need 14
not 14
necessarily 14
hold 14
for 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
this 14
may 14
indeed 14
supply 14
us 14
with 14
a 14
maxim 14
but 14
not 14
with 14
a 14
law 14
with 14
a 14
subjective 14
principle 14
on 14
which 14
we 14
may 14
have 14
a 14
propension 14
and 14
inclination 14
to 14
act 14
but 14
not 14
with 14
an 14
objective 14
principle 14
on 14
which 14
we 14
should 14
be 14
enjoined 14
to 14
act 14
even 14
though 14
all 14
our 14
propensions 14
inclinations 14
and 14
natural 14
dispositions 14
were 14
opposed 14
to 14
it 14
in 14
fact 14
the 14
sublimity 14
and 14
intrinsic 14
dignity 14
of 14
the 14
command 14
in 14
duty 14
are 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
more 14
evident 14
the 14
less 14
the 14
subjective 14
impulses 14
favour 14
it 14
and 14
the 14
more 14
they 14
oppose 14
it 14
without 14
being 14
able 14
in 14
the 14
slightest 14
degree 14
to 14
weaken 14
the 14
obligation 14
of 14
the 14
law 14
or 14
to 14
diminish 14
its 14
validity 14
here 14
then 14
we 14
see 14
philosophy 14
brought 14
to 14
a 14
critical 14
position 14
since 14
it 14
has 14
to 14
be 14
firmly 14
fixed 14
notwithstanding 14
that 14
it 14
has 14
nothing 14
to 14
support 14
it 14
in 14
heaven 14
or 14
earth 14
here 14
it 14
must 14
show 14
its 14
purity 14
as 14
absolute 14
director 14
of 14
its 14
own 14
laws 14
not 14
the 14
herald 14
of 14
those 14
which 14
are 14
whispered 14
to 14
it 14
by 14
an 14
implanted 14
sense 14
or 14
who 14
knows 14
what 14
tutelary 14
nature 14
although 14
these 14
may 14
be 14
better 14
than 14
nothing 14
yet 14
they 14
can 14
never 14
afford 14
principles 14
dictated 14
by 14
reason 14
which 14
must 14
have 14
their 14
source 14
wholly 14
a 14
priori 14
and 14
thence 14
their 14
commanding 14
authority 14
expecting 14
everything 14
from 14
the 14
supremacy 14
of 14
the 14
law 14
and 14
the 14
due 14
respect 14
for 14
it 14
nothing 14
from 14
inclination 14
or 14
else 14
condemning 14
the 14
man 14
to 14
selfcontempt 14
and 14
inward 14
abhorrence 14
thus 14
every 14
empirical 14
element 14
is 14
not 14
only 14
quite 14
incapable 14
of 14
being 14
an 14
aid 14
to 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
but 14
is 14
even 14
highly 14
prejudicial 14
to 14
the 14
purity 14
of 14
morals 14
for 14
the 14
proper 14
and 14
inestimable 14
worth 14
of 14
an 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
consists 14
just 14
in 14
this 14
that 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
action 14
is 14
free 14
from 14
all 14
influence 14
of 14
contingent 14
grounds 14
which 14
alone 14
experience 14
can 14
furnish 14
we 14
cannot 14
too 14
much 14
or 14
too 14
often 14
repeat 14
our 14
warning 14
against 14
this 14
lax 14
and 14
even 14
mean 14
habit 14
of 14
thought 14
which 14
seeks 14
for 14
its 14
principle 14
amongst 14
empirical 14
motives 14
and 14
laws 14
for 14
human 14
reason 14
in 14
its 14
weariness 14
is 14
glad 14
to 14
rest 14
on 14
this 14
pillow 14
and 14
in 14
a 14
dream 14
of 14
sweet 14
illusions 14
in 14
which 14
instead 14
of 14
juno 14
it 14
embraces 14
a 14
cloud 14
it 14
substitutes 14
for 14
morality 14
a 14
bastard 14
patched 14
up 14
from 14
limbs 14
of 14
various 14
derivation 14
which 14
looks 14
like 14
anything 14
one 14
chooses 14
to 14
see 14
in 14
it 14
only 14
not 14
like 14
virtue 14
to 14
one 14
who 14
has 14
once 14
beheld 14
her 14
in 14
her 14
true 14
form 14
to 14
behold 14
virtue 14
in 14
her 14
proper 14
form 14
is 14
nothing 14
else 14
but 14
to 14
contemplate 14
morality 14
stripped 14
of 14
all 14
admixture 14
of 14
sensible 14
things 14
and 14
of 14
every 14
spurious 14
ornament 14
of 14
reward 14
or 14
selflove 14
how 14
much 14
she 14
then 14
eclipses 14
everything 14
else 14
that 14
appears 14
charming 14
to 14
the 14
affections 14
every 14
one 14
may 14
readily 14
perceive 14
with 14
the 14
least 14
exertion 14
of 14
his 14
reason 14
if 14
it 14
be 14
not 14
wholly 14
spoiled 14
for 14
abstraction 14
the 14
question 14
then 14
is 14
this 14
is 14
it 14
a 14
necessary 14
law 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
that 14
they 14
should 14
always 14
judge 14
of 14
their 14
actions 14
by 14
maxims 14
of 14
which 14
they 14
can 14
themselves 14
will 14
that 14
they 14
should 14
serve 14
as 14
universal 14
laws 14
if 14
it 14
is 14
so 14
then 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
connected 14
altogether 14
a 14
priori 14
with 14
the 14
very 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
generally 14
but 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
discover 14
this 14
connexion 14
we 14
must 14
however 14
reluctantly 14
take 14
a 14
step 14
into 14
metaphysic 14
although 14
into 14
a 14
domain 14
of 14
it 14
which 14
is 14
distinct 14
from 14
speculative 14
philosophy 14
namely 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
in 14
a 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
where 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
the 14
reasons 14
of 14
what 14
happens 14
that 14
we 14
have 14
to 14
ascertain 14
but 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
what 14
ought 14
to 14
happen 14
even 14
although 14
it 14
never 14
does 14
ie 14
objective 14
practical 14
laws 14
there 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
necessary 14
to 14
inquire 14
into 14
the 14
reasons 14
why 14
anything 14
pleases 14
or 14
displeases 14
how 14
the 14
pleasure 14
of 14
mere 14
sensation 14
differs 14
from 14
taste 14
and 14
whether 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
distinct 14
from 14
a 14
general 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
reason 14
on 14
what 14
the 14
feeling 14
of 14
pleasure 14
or 14
pain 14
rests 14
and 14
how 14
from 14
it 14
desires 14
and 14
inclinations 14
arise 14
and 14
from 14
these 14
again 14
maxims 14
by 14
the 14
cooperation 14
of 14
reason 14
for 14
all 14
this 14
belongs 14
to 14
an 14
empirical 14
psychology 14
which 14
would 14
constitute 14
the 14
second 14
part 14
of 14
physics 14
if 14
we 14
regard 14
physics 14
as 14
the 14
philosophy 14
of 14
nature 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
based 14
on 14
empirical 14
laws 14
but 14
here 14
we 14
are 14
concerned 14
with 14
objective 14
practical 14
laws 14
and 14
consequently 14
with 14
the 14
relation 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
to 14
itself 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
determined 14
by 14
reason 14
alone 14
in 14
which 14
case 14
whatever 14
has 14
reference 14
to 14
anything 14
empirical 14
is 14
necessarily 14
excluded 14
since 14
if 14
reason 14
of 14
itself 14
alone 14
determines 14
the 14
conduct 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
this 14
that 14
we 14
are 14
now 14
investigating 14
it 14
must 14
necessarily 14
do 14
so 14
a 14
priori 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
conceived 14
as 14
a 14
faculty 14
of 14
determining 14
oneself 14
to 14
action 14
in 14
accordance 14
with 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
certain 14
laws 14
and 14
such 14
a 14
faculty 14
can 14
be 14
found 14
only 14
in 14
rational 14
beings 14
now 14
that 14
which 14
serves 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
the 14
objective 14
ground 14
of 14
its 14
selfdetermination 14
is 14
the 14
end 14
and 14
if 14
this 14
is 14
assigned 14
by 14
reason 14
alone 14
it 14
must 14
hold 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
that 14
which 14
merely 14
contains 14
the 14
ground 14
of 14
possibility 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
of 14
which 14
the 14
effect 14
is 14
the 14
end 14
this 14
is 14
called 14
the 14

the 14
subjective 14
ground 14
of 14
the 14
desire 14
is 14
the 14
spring 14
the 14
objective 14
ground 14
of 14
the 14

is 14
the 14

hence 14
the 14
distinction 14
between 14
subjective 14
ends 14
which 14
rest 14
on 14
springs 14
and 14
objective 14

for 14
every 14

formal 14

they 14
abstract 14
from 14
all 14
subjective 14
ends 14
they 14
are 14
material 14

a 14
rational 14

to 14
himself 14
at 14
pleasure 14
as 14

of 14
his 14
actions 14
material 14

are 14
all 14
only 14

only 14
their 14
relation 14
to 14
the 14
particular 14
desires 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
that 14
gives 14
them 14
their 14
worth 14
which 14
therefore 14
cannot 14
furnish 14
principles 14
universal 14
and 14
necessary 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14

say 14
practical 14

hence 14
all 14
these 14
relative 14

can 14
give 14
rise 14
only 14
to 14
hypothetical 14
imperatives 14
supposing 14
however 14
that 14
there 14
were 14
something 14
whose 14
existence 14
has 14
in 14
itself 14
an 14
absolute 14
worth 14
something 14
which 14
being 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
could 14
be 14
a 14
source 14
of 14
definite 14
laws 14
then 14
in 14
this 14
and 14
this 14
alone 14
would 14
lie 14
the 14
source 14
of 14
a 14
possible 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
ie 14
a 14
practical 14
law 14

i 14
say 14
man 14
and 14
generally 14
any 14
rational 14
being 14
exists 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
not 14
merely 14
as 14
a 14
means 14
to 14
be 14
arbitrarily 14
used 14
by 14
this 14
or 14
that 14

but 14
in 14
all 14
his 14
actions 14
whether 14
they 14
concern 14
himself 14
or 14
other 14
rational 14
beings 14
must 14
be 14
always 14
regarded 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
all 14
objects 14
of 14
the 14
inclinations 14
have 14
only 14
a 14
conditional 14
worth 14
for 14
if 14
the 14
inclinations 14
and 14
the 14
wants 14
founded 14
on 14
them 14
did 14
not 14
exist 14
then 14
their 14
object 14
would 14
be 14
without 14
value 14
but 14
the 14
inclinations 14
themselves 14
being 14
sources 14
of 14
want 14
are 14
so 14
far 14
from 14
having 14
an 14
absolute 14
worth 14
for 14
which 14
they 14
should 14
be 14
desired 14
that 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
the 14
universal 14
wish 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
to 14
be 14
wholly 14
free 14
from 14
them 14
thus 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
any 14
object 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
acquired 14
by 14
our 14
action 14
is 14
always 14
conditional 14
beings 14
whose 14
existence 14
depends 14
not 14
on 14
our 14
will 14
but 14
on 14
natures 14
have 14
nevertheless 14
if 14
they 14
are 14
irrational 14
beings 14
only 14
a 14
relative 14
value 14
as 14
means 14
and 14
are 14
therefore 14
called 14
things 14
rational 14
beings 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
are 14
called 14
persons 14
because 14
their 14
very 14
nature 14
points 14
them 14
out 14
as 14
ends 14
in 14
themselves 14
that 14
is 14
as 14
something 14
which 14
must 14
not 14
be 14
used 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
and 14
so 14
far 14
therefore 14
restricts 14
freedom 14
of 14
action 14
and 14
is 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
respect 14

therefore 14
are 14
not 14
merely 14
subjective 14
ends 14
whose 14
existence 14
has 14
a 14
worth 14
for 14
us 14
as 14
an 14
effect 14
of 14
our 14
action 14
but 14
objective 14
ends 14
that 14
is 14
things 14
whose 14
existence 14
is 14
an 14

in 14
itself 14
an 14
end 14
moreover 14
for 14
which 14
no 14
other 14
can 14
be 14
substituted 14
which 14
they 14
should 14
subserve 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
for 14
otherwise 14
nothing 14
whatever 14
would 14
possess 14
absolute 14
worth 14
but 14
if 14
all 14
worth 14
were 14
conditioned 14
and 14
therefore 14
contingent 14
then 14
there 14
would 14
be 14
no 14
supreme 14
practical 14
principle 14
of 14
reason 14
whatever 14
if 14
then 14
there 14
is 14
a 14

in 14

of 14
the 14
human 14

a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
one 14
which 14
being 14
drawn 14
from 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
that 14
which 14
is 14
necessarily 14
an 14
end 14
for 14
everyone 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
constitutes 14
an 14
objective 14
principle 14
of 14
will 14
and 14
can 14
therefore 14
serve 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
practical 14
law 14
the 14
foundation 14
of 14
this 14

rational 14
nature 14

as 14
an 14

conceives 14
his 14
own 14
existence 14
as 14
being 14
so 14
so 14
far 14
then 14
this 14
is 14
a 14
subjective 14
principle 14
of 14
human 14
actions 14
but 14
every 14
other 14
rational 14
being 14
regards 14
its 14
existence 14
similarly 14
just 14
on 14
the 14
same 14
rational 14
principle 14
that 14
holds 14
for 14
me 14
so 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
an 14
objective 14
principle 14
from 14
which 14
as 14
a 14
supreme 14
practical 14
law 14
all 14
laws 14
of 14

be 14
capable 14

being 14
deduced 14
accordingly 14
the 14
practical 14
imperative 14
will 14
be 14
as 14
follows 14
so 14
act 14
as 14
to 14
treat 14
humanity 14
whether 14
in 14
thine 14
own 14
person 14
or 14
in 14
that 14
of 14
any 14
other 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
withal 14
never 14
as 14
means 14
only 14
we 14
will 14
now 14
inquire 14
whether 14
this 14
can 14
be 14
practically 14
carried 14
out 14
this 14
proposition 14
is 14
here 14
stated 14
as 14
a 14
postulate 14
the 14
ground 14
of 14
it 14
will 14
be 14
found 14
in 14
the 14
concluding 14
section 14
to 14
abide 14
by 14
the 14
previous 14
examples 14
firstly 14
under 14
the 14
head 14
of 14
necessary 14
duty 14
to 14
oneself 14
he 14
who 14
contemplates 14
suicide 14
should 14
ask 14
himself 14
whether 14
his 14
action 14
can 14
be 14
consistent 14
with 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
humanity 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
if 14
he 14
destroys 14
himself 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
escape 14
from 14
painful 14
circumstances 14
he 14
uses 14
a 14
person 14
merely 14
as 14
a 14
mean 14
to 14
maintain 14
a 14
tolerable 14
condition 14
up 14
to 14
the 14
end 14
of 14
life 14
but 14
a 14
man 14
is 14
not 14
a 14
thing 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
something 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
used 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
but 14
must 14
in 14
all 14
his 14
actions 14
be 14
always 14
considered 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
i 14
cannot 14
therefore 14
dispose 14
in 14
any 14
way 14
of 14
a 14
man 14
in 14
my 14
own 14
person 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
mutilate 14
him 14
to 14
damage 14
or 14
kill 14
him 14
it 14
belongs 14
to 14
ethics 14
proper 14
to 14
define 14
this 14
principle 14
more 14
precisely 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
avoid 14
all 14
misunderstanding 14
e 14
g 14
as 14
to 14
the 14
amputation 14
of 14
the 14
limbs 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
preserve 14
myself 14
as 14
to 14
exposing 14
my 14
life 14
to 14
danger 14
with 14
a 14
view 14
to 14
preserve 14
it 14
etc 14
this 14
question 14
is 14
therefore 14
omitted 14
here 14
secondly 14
as 14
regards 14
necessary 14
duties 14
or 14
those 14
of 14
strict 14
obligation 14
towards 14
others 14
he 14
who 14
is 14
thinking 14
of 14
making 14
a 14
lying 14
promise 14
to 14
others 14
will 14
see 14
at 14
once 14
that 14
he 14
would 14
be 14
using 14
another 14
man 14
merely 14
as 14
a 14
mean 14
without 14
the 14
latter 14
containing 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
the 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
for 14
he 14
whom 14
i 14
propose 14
by 14
such 14
a 14
promise 14
to 14
use 14
for 14
my 14
own 14
purposes 14
cannot 14
possibly 14
assent 14
to 14
my 14
mode 14
of 14
acting 14
towards 14
him 14
and 14
therefore 14
cannot 14
himself 14
contain 14
the 14
end 14
of 14
this 14
action 14
this 14
violation 14
of 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
humanity 14
in 14
other 14
men 14
is 14
more 14
obvious 14
if 14
we 14
take 14
in 14
examples 14
of 14
attacks 14
on 14
the 14
freedom 14
and 14
property 14
of 14
others 14
for 14
then 14
it 14
is 14
clear 14
that 14
he 14
who 14
transgresses 14
the 14
rights 14
of 14
men 14
intends 14
to 14
use 14
the 14
person 14
of 14
others 14
merely 14
as 14
a 14
means 14
without 14
considering 14
that 14
as 14
rational 14
beings 14
they 14
ought 14
always 14
to 14
be 14
esteemed 14
also 14
as 14
ends 14
that 14
is 14
as 14
beings 14
who 14
must 14
be 14
capable 14
of 14
containing 14
in 14
themselves 14
the 14
end 14
of 14
the 14
very 14
same 14
action 14
let 14
it 14
not 14
be 14
thought 14
that 14
the 14
common 14
quod 14
tibi 14
non 14
vis 14
fieri 14
etc 14
could 14
serve 14
here 14
as 14
the 14
rule 14
or 14
principle 14
for 14
it 14
is 14
only 14
a 14
deduction 14
from 14
the 14
former 14
though 14
with 14
several 14
limitations 14
it 14
cannot 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
it 14
does 14
not 14
contain 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
duties 14
to 14
oneself 14
nor 14
of 14
the 14
duties 14
of 14
benevolence 14
to 14
others 14
for 14
many 14
a 14
one 14
would 14
gladly 14
consent 14
that 14
others 14
should 14
not 14
benefit 14
him 14
provided 14
only 14
that 14
he 14
might 14
be 14
excused 14
from 14
showing 14
benevolence 14
to 14
them 14
nor 14
finally 14
that 14
of 14
duties 14
of 14
strict 14
obligation 14
to 14
one 14
another 14
for 14
on 14
this 14
principle 14
the 14
criminal 14
might 14
argue 14
against 14
the 14
judge 14
who 14
punishes 14
him 14
and 14
so 14
on 14
thirdly 14
as 14
regards 14
contingent 14
meritorious 14
duties 14
to 14
oneself 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
that 14
the 14
action 14
does 14
not 14
violate 14
humanity 14
in 14
our 14
own 14
person 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
it 14
must 14
also 14
harmonize 14
with 14
it 14
now 14
there 14
are 14
in 14
humanity 14
capacities 14
of 14
greater 14
perfection 14
which 14
belong 14
to 14
the 14
end 14
that 14
nature 14
has 14
in 14
view 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
humanity 14
in 14
ourselves 14
as 14
the 14
subject 14
to 14
neglect 14
these 14
might 14
perhaps 14
be 14
consistent 14
with 14
the 14
maintenance 14
of 14
humanity 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
but 14
not 14
with 14
the 14
advancement 14
of 14
this 14
end 14
fourthly 14
as 14
regards 14
meritorious 14
duties 14
towards 14
others 14
the 14
natural 14
end 14
which 14
all 14
men 14
have 14
is 14
their 14
own 14
happiness 14
now 14
humanity 14
might 14
indeed 14
subsist 14
although 14
no 14
one 14
should 14
contribute 14
anything 14
to 14
the 14
happiness 14
of 14
others 14
provided 14
he 14
did 14
not 14
intentionally 14
withdraw 14
anything 14
from 14
it 14
but 14
after 14
all 14
this 14
would 14
only 14
harmonize 14
negatively 14
not 14
positively 14
with 14
humanity 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
if 14
every 14
one 14
does 14
not 14
also 14
endeavour 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
in 14
him 14
lies 14
to 14
forward 14
the 14
ends 14
of 14
others 14
for 14
the 14
ends 14
of 14
any 14
subject 14
which 14
is 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
ought 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
possible 14
to 14
be 14
my 14
ends 14
also 14
if 14
that 14
conception 14
is 14
to 14
have 14
its 14
full 14
effect 14
with 14
me 14
this 14
principle 14
that 14
humanity 14
and 14
generally 14
every 14
rational 14
nature 14
is 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
which 14
is 14
the 14
supreme 14
limiting 14
condition 14
of 14
every 14
mans 14
freedom 14
of 14
action 14
is 14
not 14
borrowed 14
from 14
experience 14
firstly 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
universal 14
applying 14
as 14
it 14
does 14
to 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
whatever 14
and 14
experience 14
is 14
not 14
capable 14
of 14
determining 14
anything 14
about 14
them 14
secondly 14
because 14
it 14
does 14
not 14
present 14
humanity 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
to 14
men 14
subjectively 14
that 14
is 14
as 14
an 14
object 14
which 14
men 14
do 14
of 14
themselves 14
actually 14
adopt 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
but 14
as 14
an 14
objective 14
end 14
which 14
must 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
constitute 14
the 14
supreme 14
limiting 14
condition 14
of 14
all 14
our 14
subjective 14
ends 14
let 14
them 14
be 14
what 14
we 14
will 14
it 14
must 14
therefore 14
spring 14
from 14
pure 14
reason 14
in 14
fact 14
the 14
objective 14
principle 14
of 14
all 14
practical 14
legislation 14
lies 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
first 14
principle 14
in 14
the 14
rule 14
and 14
its 14
form 14
of 14
universality 14
which 14
makes 14
it 14
capable 14
of 14
being 14
a 14
law 14
say 14
e 14
g 14
a 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
but 14
the 14
subjective 14
principle 14
is 14
in 14
the 14
end 14
now 14
by 14
the 14
second 14
principle 14
the 14
subject 14
of 14
all 14
ends 14
is 14
each 14
rational 14
being 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
hence 14
follows 14
the 14
third 14
practical 14
principle 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
which 14
is 14
the 14
ultimate 14
condition 14
of 14
its 14
harmony 14
with 14
universal 14
practical 14
reason 14
viz 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
a 14
universally 14
legislative 14
will 14
on 14
this 14
principle 14
all 14
maxims 14
are 14
rejected 14
which 14
are 14
inconsistent 14
with 14
the 14
will 14
being 14
itself 14
universal 14
legislator 14
thus 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
not 14
subject 14
simply 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
but 14
so 14
subject 14
that 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
itself 14
giving 14
the 14
law 14
and 14
on 14
this 14
ground 14
only 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
which 14
it 14
can 14
regard 14
itself 14
as 14
the 14
author 14
in 14
the 14
previous 14
imperatives 14
namely 14
that 14
based 14
on 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
conformity 14
of 14
actions 14
to 14
general 14
laws 14
as 14
in 14
a 14
physical 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
that 14
based 14
on 14
the 14
universal 14
prerogative 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
as 14
ends 14
in 14
themselves 14
these 14
imperatives 14
just 14
because 14
they 14
were 14
conceived 14
as 14
categorical 14
excluded 14
from 14
any 14
share 14
in 14
their 14
authority 14
all 14
admixture 14
of 14
any 14
interest 14
as 14
a 14
spring 14
of 14
action 14
they 14
were 14
however 14
only 14
assumed 14
to 14
be 14
categorical 14
because 14
such 14
an 14
assumption 14
was 14
necessary 14
to 14
explain 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
duty 14
but 14
we 14
could 14
not 14
prove 14
independently 14
that 14
there 14
are 14
practical 14
propositions 14
which 14
command 14
categorically 14
nor 14
can 14
it 14
be 14
proved 14
in 14
this 14
section 14
one 14
thing 14
however 14
could 14
be 14
done 14
namely 14
to 14
indicate 14
in 14
the 14
imperative 14
itself 14
by 14
some 14
determinate 14
expression 14
that 14
in 14
the 14
case 14
of 14
volition 14
from 14
duty 14
all 14
interest 14
is 14
renounced 14
which 14
is 14
the 14
specific 14
criterion 14
of 14
categorical 14
as 14
distinguished 14
from 14
hypothetical 14
imperatives 14
this 14
is 14
done 14
in 14
the 14
present 14
third 14
formula 14
of 14
the 14
principle 14
namely 14
in 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
a 14
universally 14
legislating 14
will 14
for 14
although 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
is 14
subject 14
to 14
laws 14
may 14
be 14
attached 14
to 14
this 14
law 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
an 14
interest 14
yet 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
is 14
itself 14
a 14
supreme 14
lawgiver 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
such 14
cannot 14
possibly 14
depend 14
on 14
any 14
interest 14
since 14
a 14
will 14
so 14
dependent 14
would 14
itself 14
still 14
need 14
another 14
law 14
restricting 14
the 14
interest 14
of 14
its 14
selflove 14
by 14
the 14
condition 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
be 14
valid 14
as 14
universal 14
law 14
thus 14
the 14
principle 14
that 14
every 14
human 14
will 14
is 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
in 14
all 14
its 14
maxims 14
gives 14
universal 14
laws 14
provided 14
it 14
be 14
otherwise 14
justified 14
would 14
be 14
very 14
well 14
adapted 14
to 14
be 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
in 14
this 14
respect 14
namely 14
that 14
just 14
because 14
of 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
universal 14
legislation 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
based 14
on 14
interest 14
and 14
therefore 14
it 14
alone 14
among 14
all 14
possible 14
imperatives 14
can 14
be 14
unconditional 14
or 14
still 14
better 14
converting 14
the 14
proposition 14
if 14
there 14
is 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
ie 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
it 14
can 14
only 14
command 14
that 14
everything 14
be 14
done 14
from 14
maxims 14
of 14
ones 14
will 14
regarded 14
as 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
could 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
will 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
itself 14
give 14
universal 14
laws 14
for 14
in 14
that 14
case 14
only 14
the 14
practical 14
principle 14
and 14
the 14
imperative 14
which 14
it 14
obeys 14
are 14
unconditional 14
since 14
they 14
cannot 14
be 14
based 14
on 14
any 14
interest 14
i 14
may 14
be 14
excused 14
from 14
adducing 14
examples 14
to 14
elucidate 14
this 14
principle 14
as 14
those 14
which 14
have 14
already 14
been 14
used 14
to 14
elucidate 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
and 14
its 14
formula 14
would 14
all 14
serve 14
for 14
the 14
like 14
purpose 14
here 14
looking 14
back 14
now 14
on 14
all 14
previous 14
attempts 14
to 14
discover 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
we 14
need 14
not 14
wonder 14
why 14
they 14
all 14
failed 14
it 14
was 14
seen 14
that 14
man 14
was 14
bound 14
to 14
laws 14
by 14
duty 14
but 14
it 14
was 14
not 14
observed 14
that 14
the 14
laws 14
to 14
which 14
he 14
is 14
subject 14
are 14
only 14
those 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
giving 14
though 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
they 14
are 14
universal 14
and 14
that 14
he 14
is 14
only 14
bound 14
to 14
act 14
in 14
conformity 14
with 14
his 14
own 14
will 14
a 14
will 14
however 14
which 14
is 14
designed 14
by 14
nature 14
to 14
give 14
universal 14
laws 14
for 14
when 14
one 14
has 14
conceived 14
man 14
only 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
a 14
law 14
no 14
matter 14
what 14
then 14
this 14
law 14
required 14
some 14
interest 14
either 14
by 14
way 14
of 14
attraction 14
or 14
constraint 14
since 14
it 14
did 14
not 14
originate 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
from 14
his 14
own 14
will 14
but 14
this 14
will 14
was 14
according 14
to 14
a 14
law 14
obliged 14
by 14
something 14
else 14
to 14
act 14
in 14
a 14
certain 14
manner 14
now 14
by 14
this 14
necessary 14
consequence 14
all 14
the 14
labour 14
spent 14
in 14
finding 14
a 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
duty 14
was 14
irrevocably 14
lost 14
for 14
men 14
never 14
elicited 14
duty 14
but 14
only 14
a 14
necessity 14
of 14
acting 14
from 14
a 14
certain 14
interest 14
whether 14
this 14
interest 14
was 14
private 14
or 14
otherwise 14
in 14
any 14
case 14
the 14
imperative 14
must 14
be 14
conditional 14
and 14
could 14
not 14
by 14
any 14
means 14
be 14
capable 14
of 14
being 14
a 14
moral 14
command 14
i 14
will 14
therefore 14
call 14
this 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
in 14
contrast 14
with 14
every 14
other 14
which 14
i 14
accordingly 14
reckon 14
as 14
heteronomy 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
one 14
which 14
must 14
consider 14
itself 14
as 14
giving 14
in 14
all 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
its 14
will 14
universal 14
laws 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
judge 14
itself 14
and 14
its 14
actions 14
from 14
this 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
this 14
conception 14
leads 14
to 14
another 14
which 14
depends 14
on 14
it 14
and 14
is 14
very 14
fruitful 14
namely 14
that 14
of 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
by 14
a 14
kingdom 14
i 14
understand 14
the 14
union 14
of 14
different 14
rational 14
beings 14
in 14
a 14
system 14
by 14
common 14
laws 14
now 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
by 14
laws 14
that 14
ends 14
are 14
determined 14
as 14
regards 14
their 14
universal 14
validity 14
hence 14
if 14
we 14
abstract 14
from 14
the 14
personal 14
differences 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
and 14
likewise 14
from 14
all 14
the 14
content 14
of 14
their 14
private 14
ends 14
we 14
shall 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
conceive 14
all 14
ends 14
combined 14
in 14
a 14
systematic 14
whole 14
including 14
both 14
rational 14
beings 14
as 14
ends 14
in 14
themselves 14
and 14
also 14
the 14
special 14
ends 14
which 14
each 14
may 14
propose 14
to 14
himself 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
we 14
can 14
conceive 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
which 14
on 14
the 14
preceding 14
principles 14
is 14
possible 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
come 14
under 14
the 14
law 14
that 14
each 14
of 14
them 14
must 14
treat 14
itself 14
and 14
all 14
others 14
never 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
but 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
as 14
ends 14
in 14
themselves 14
hence 14
results 14
a 14
systematic 14
union 14
of 14
rational 14
being 14
by 14
common 14
objective 14
laws 14
ie 14
a 14
kingdom 14
which 14
may 14
be 14
called 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
since 14
what 14
these 14
laws 14
have 14
in 14
view 14
is 14
just 14
the 14
relation 14
of 14
these 14
beings 14
to 14
one 14
another 14
as 14
ends 14
and 14
means 14
it 14
is 14
certainly 14
only 14
an 14
ideal 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
belongs 14
as 14
a 14
member 14
to 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
when 14
although 14
giving 14
universal 14
laws 14
in 14
it 14
he 14
is 14
also 14
himself 14
subject 14
to 14
these 14
laws 14
he 14
belongs 14
to 14
it 14
as 14
sovereign 14
when 14
while 14
giving 14
laws 14
he 14
is 14
not 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
any 14
other 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
must 14
always 14
regard 14
himself 14
as 14
giving 14
laws 14
either 14
as 14
member 14
or 14
as 14
sovereign 14
in 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
which 14
is 14
rendered 14
possible 14
by 14
the 14
freedom 14
of 14
will 14
he 14
cannot 14
however 14
maintain 14
the 14
latter 14
position 14
merely 14
by 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
his 14
will 14
but 14
only 14
in 14
case 14
he 14
is 14
a 14
completely 14
independent 14
being 14
without 14
wants 14
and 14
with 14
unrestricted 14
power 14
adequate 14
to 14
his 14
will 14
morality 14
consists 14
then 14
in 14
the 14
reference 14
of 14
all 14
action 14
to 14
the 14
legislation 14

this 14

be 14
capable 14

in 14
every 14
rational 14

of 14
emanating 14
from 14
his 14

so 14
that 14
the 14
principle 14

this 14

not 14

accordingly 14

at 14

their 14
own 14
nature 14

to 14
all 14
in 14

solely 14
on 14
the 14

to 14
one 14

the 14

practical 14
motive 14
or 14
any 14
future 14

from 14
the 14

the 14

these 14

no 14

them 14
they 14
exhibit 14

performs 14
them 14
as 14
an 14

in 14
the 14

of 14
duties 14
would 14
be 14
a 14
contradiction 14
this 14
estimation 14
therefore 14
shows 14
that 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
disposition 14
is 14
dignity 14

places 14
it 14
infinitely 14
above 14
all 14

which 14
it 14
cannot 14

the 14

by 14
which 14

to 14
a 14

of 14
universal 14

to 14

at 14
the 14

time 14
he 14
submits 14
himself 14
for 14
nothing 14
has 14
any 14
worth 14
except 14
what 14
the 14
law 14
assigns 14
it 14
now 14
the 14
legislation 14
itself 14
which 14
assigns 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
everything 14
must 14
for 14
that 14
very 14
reason 14
possess 14
dignity 14
that 14
is 14
an 14
unconditional 14
incomparable 14
worth 14
and 14
the 14
word 14
respect 14
alone 14
supplies 14
a 14
becoming 14
expression 14
for 14
the 14
esteem 14
which 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
must 14
have 14
for 14
it 14
autonomy 14
then 14
is 14
the 14
basis 14
of 14
the 14
dignity 14
of 14
human 14
and 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
nature 14
the 14
three 14
modes 14
of 14
presenting 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
that 14
have 14
been 14
adduced 14
are 14
at 14
bottom 14
only 14
so 14
many 14
formulae 14
of 14
the 14
very 14
same 14
law 14
and 14
each 14
of 14
itself 14
involves 14
the 14
other 14
two 14
there 14
is 14
however 14
a 14
difference 14
in 14
them 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
rather 14
subjectively 14
than 14
objectively 14
practical 14
intended 14
namely 14
to 14
bring 14
an 14
idea 14
of 14
the 14
reason 14
nearer 14
to 14
intuition 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
a 14
certain 14
analogy 14
and 14
thereby 14
nearer 14
to 14
feeling 14
all 14
maxims 14
in 14
fact 14
have 14
a 14
form 14
consisting 14
in 14
universality 14
and 14
in 14
this 14
view 14
the 14
formula 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
imperative 14
is 14
expressed 14
thus 14
that 14
the 14
maxims 14
must 14
be 14
so 14
chosen 14
as 14
if 14
they 14
were 14
to 14
serve 14
as 14
universal 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
a 14
matter 14
namely 14
an 14
end 14
and 14
here 14
the 14
formula 14
says 14
that 14
the 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
end 14
by 14
its 14
own 14
nature 14
and 14
therefore 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
itself 14
must 14
in 14
every 14
maxim 14
serve 14
as 14
the 14
condition 14
limiting 14
all 14
merely 14
relative 14
and 14
arbitrary 14
ends 14
a 14
complete 14
characterization 14
of 14
all 14
maxims 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
that 14
formula 14
namely 14
that 14
all 14
maxims 14
ought 14
by 14
their 14
own 14
legislation 14
to 14
harmonize 14
with 14
a 14
possible 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
as 14
with 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
nature 14
there 14
is 14
a 14
progress 14
here 14
in 14
the 14
order 14
of 14
the 14
categories 14
of 14
unity 14
of 14
the 14
form 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
its 14
universality 14
plurality 14
of 14
the 14
matter 14
the 14
objects 14
ie 14
the 14
ends 14
and 14
totality 14
of 14
the 14
system 14
of 14
these 14
in 14
forming 14
our 14
moral 14
judgement 14
of 14
actions 14
it 14
is 14
better 14
to 14
proceed 14
always 14
on 14
the 14
strict 14
method 14
and 14
start 14
from 14
the 14
general 14
formula 14
of 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
act 14
according 14
to 14
a 14
maxim 14
which 14
can 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
make 14
itself 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
if 14
however 14
we 14
wish 14
to 14
gain 14
an 14
entrance 14
for 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
it 14
is 14
very 14
useful 14
to 14
bring 14
one 14
and 14
the 14
same 14
action 14
under 14
the 14
three 14
specified 14
conceptions 14
and 14
thereby 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
possible 14
to 14
bring 14
it 14
nearer 14
to 14
intuition 14
teleology 14
considers 14
nature 14
as 14
a 14
kingdom 14

ethics 14
regards 14
a 14
possible 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
as 14
a 14
kingdom 14
nature 14
in 14
the 14
first 14
case 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
is 14
a 14
theoretical 14
idea 14
adopted 14
to 14
explain 14
what 14
actually 14
is 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
practical 14
idea 14
adopted 14
to 14
bring 14
about 14
that 14
which 14
is 14
not 14
yet 14
but 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
realized 14
by 14
our 14
conduct 14
namely 14
if 14
it 14
conforms 14
to 14
this 14
idea 14
we 14
can 14
now 14
end 14
where 14
we 14
started 14
at 14
the 14
beginning 14
namely 14
with 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
unconditionally 14
good 14
that 14
will 14
is 14
absolutely 14
good 14
which 14
cannot 14
be 14
evil 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
whose 14
maxim 14
if 14
made 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
could 14
never 14
contradict 14
itself 14
this 14
principle 14
then 14
is 14
its 14
supreme 14
law 14
act 14
always 14
on 14
such 14
a 14
maxim 14
as 14
thou 14
canst 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
will 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
this 14
is 14
the 14
sole 14
condition 14
under 14
which 14
a 14
will 14
can 14
never 14
contradict 14
itself 14
and 14
such 14
an 14
imperative 14
is 14
categorical 14
since 14
the 14
validity 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
possible 14
actions 14
is 14
analogous 14
to 14
the 14
universal 14
connexion 14
of 14
the 14
existence 14
of 14
things 14
by 14
general 14
laws 14
which 14
is 14
the 14
formal 14
notion 14
of 14
nature 14
in 14
general 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
can 14
also 14
be 14
expressed 14
thus 14
act 14
on 14
maxims 14
which 14
can 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
have 14
for 14
their 14
object 14
themselves 14
as 14
universal 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
such 14
then 14
is 14
the 14
formula 14
of 14
an 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
rational 14
nature 14
is 14
distinguished 14
from 14
the 14
rest 14
of 14
nature 14
by 14
this 14
that 14
it 14
sets 14
before 14
itself 14
an 14
end 14
this 14
end 14
would 14
be 14
the 14
matter 14
of 14
every 14
good 14
will 14
but 14
since 14
in 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
that 14
is 14
absolutely 14
good 14
without 14
being 14
limited 14
by 14
any 14
condition 14
of 14
attaining 14
this 14
or 14
that 14
end 14
we 14
must 14
abstract 14
wholly 14
from 14
every 14
end 14
to 14
be 14
effected 14
since 14
this 14
would 14
make 14
every 14
will 14
only 14
relatively 14
good 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
the 14
end 14
must 14
be 14
conceived 14
not 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
to 14
be 14
effected 14
but 14
as 14
an 14
independently 14
existing 14
end 14
consequently 14
it 14
is 14
conceived 14
only 14
negatively 14
ie 14
as 14
that 14
which 14
we 14
must 14
never 14
act 14
against 14
and 14
which 14
therefore 14
must 14
never 14
be 14
regarded 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
but 14
must 14
in 14
every 14
volition 14
be 14
esteemed 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
likewise 14
now 14
this 14
end 14
can 14
be 14
nothing 14
but 14
the 14
subject 14
of 14
all 14
possible 14
ends 14
since 14
this 14
is 14
also 14
the 14
subject 14
of 14
a 14
possible 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
for 14
such 14
a 14
will 14
cannot 14
without 14
contradiction 14
be 14
postponed 14
to 14
any 14
other 14
object 14
the 14
principle 14
so 14
act 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
thyself 14
and 14
others 14
that 14
he 14
may 14
always 14
have 14
place 14
in 14
thy 14
maxim 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
is 14
accordingly 14
essentially 14
identical 14
with 14
this 14
other 14
act 14
upon 14
a 14
maxim 14
which 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
involves 14
its 14
own 14
universal 14
validity 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
for 14
that 14
in 14
using 14
means 14
for 14
every 14
end 14
i 14
should 14
limit 14
my 14
maxim 14
by 14
the 14
condition 14
of 14
its 14
holding 14
good 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
every 14
subject 14
this 14
comes 14
to 14
the 14
same 14
thing 14
as 14
that 14
the 14
fundamental 14
principle 14
of 14
all 14
maxims 14
of 14
action 14
must 14
be 14
that 14
the 14
subject 14
of 14
all 14
ends 14
ie 14
the 14
rational 14
being 14
himself 14
be 14
never 14
employed 14
merely 14
as 14
means 14
but 14
as 14
the 14
supreme 14
condition 14
restricting 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
all 14
means 14
that 14
is 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
likewise 14
it 14
follows 14
incontestably 14
that 14
to 14
whatever 14
laws 14
any 14
rational 14
being 14
may 14
be 14
subject 14
he 14
being 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
must 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
regard 14
himself 14
as 14
also 14
legislating 14
universally 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
these 14
same 14
laws 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
this 14
fitness 14
of 14
his 14
maxims 14
for 14
universal 14
legislation 14
that 14
distinguishes 14
him 14
as 14
an 14
end 14
in 14
himself 14
also 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
this 14
implies 14
his 14
dignity 14
prerogative 14
above 14
all 14
mere 14
physical 14
beings 14
that 14
he 14
must 14
always 14
take 14
his 14
maxims 14
from 14
the 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
which 14
regards 14
himself 14
and 14
likewise 14
every 14
other 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
lawgiving 14
beings 14
on 14
which 14
account 14
they 14
are 14
called 14
persons 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
a 14
world 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
mundus 14
intelligibilis 14
is 14
possible 14
as 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
and 14
this 14
by 14
virtue 14
of 14
the 14
legislation 14
proper 14
to 14
all 14
persons 14

therefore 14
every 14
rational 14

must 14
so 14
act 14
as 14
if 14
he 14
were 14
by 14
his 14
maxims 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
a 14
legislating 14
member 14
in 14
the 14
universal 14

the 14
formal 14
principle 14
of 14
these 14
maxims 14

so 14
act 14
as 14
if 14
thy 14
maxim 14
were 14

likewise 14

of 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
a 14
kingdom 14

is 14
thus 14
only 14
possible 14
on 14
the 14
analogy 14
of 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14

the 14
former 14
however 14
only 14

acting 14
under 14

from 14
without 14
nevertheless 14
although 14
the 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
is 14
looked 14
upon 14
as 14
a 14
machine 14

so 14
far 14
as 14
it 14

reference 14
to 14
rational 14

this 14
account 14
the 14

of 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
nature 14
now 14
such 14
a 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
would 14
be 14
actually 14
realized 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
maxims 14
conforming 14
to 14
the 14
canon 14
which 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
prescribes 14
to 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
if 14
they 14
were 14
universally 14
followed 14
but 14
although 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
even 14
if 14
he 14
punctually 14
follows 14
this 14
maxim 14
himself 14
cannot 14
reckon 14
upon 14
all 14
others 14
being 14
therefore 14
true 14
to 14
the 14
same 14
nor 14
expect 14
that 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
its 14
orderly 14
arrangements 14
shall 14
be 14
in 14
harmony 14
with 14
him 14
as 14

to 14
form 14

which 14
he 14
himself 14

say 14
that 14
it 14
shall 14
favour 14
his 14

still 14
that 14

act 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
a 14
merely 14
possible 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
legislating 14
in 14
it 14
universally 14
remains 14
in 14
its 14
full 14
force 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
it 14
commands 14
categorically 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
in 14
this 14
that 14
the 14
paradox 14
lies 14
that 14
the 14
mere 14
dignity 14
of 14
man 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
creature 14
without 14
any 14
other 14
end 14
or 14
advantage 14
to 14
be 14
attained 14
thereby 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
respect 14
for 14
a 14
mere 14
idea 14
should 14
yet 14
serve 14
as 14
an 14
inflexible 14
precept 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
and 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
precisely 14
in 14
this 14
independence 14
of 14
the 14
maxim 14
on 14
all 14
such 14
springs 14
of 14
action 14
that 14
its 14
sublimity 14
consists 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
this 14
that 14
makes 14
every 14
rational 14
subject 14
worthy 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
legislative 14
member 14
in 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
for 14
otherwise 14
he 14
would 14
have 14
to 14
be 14
conceived 14
only 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
physical 14
law 14
of 14
his 14
wants 14
and 14
although 14
we 14
should 14
suppose 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
the 14
kingdom 14
of 14
ends 14
to 14
be 14
united 14
under 14
one 14
sovereign 14
so 14
that 14
the 14
latter 14
kingdom 14
thereby 14
ceased 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
mere 14
idea 14
and 14
acquired 14
true 14
reality 14
then 14
it 14
would 14
no 14
doubt 14
gain 14
the 14
accession 14
of 14
a 14
strong 14
spring 14
but 14
by 14
no 14
means 14
any 14
increase 14
of 14
its 14
intrinsic 14
worth 14
for 14
this 14
sole 14
absolute 14
lawgiver 14
must 14
notwithstanding 14
this 14
be 14
always 14
conceived 14
as 14
estimating 14
the 14
worth 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
only 14
by 14
their 14
disinterested 14
behaviour 14
as 14
prescribed 14
to 14
themselves 14
from 14
that 14
idea 14
the 14
dignity 14
of 14
man 14

the 14

of 14
things 14
is 14
not 14
altered 14
by 14
their 14
external 14
relations 14
and 14
that 14
which 14
abstracting 14
from 14
these 14
alone 14
constitutes 14
the 14
absolute 14
worth 14
of 14
man 14
is 14
also 14
that 14
by 14
which 14
he 14
must 14
be 14
judged 14
whoever 14
the 14

may 14
be 14
and 14
even 14
by 14
the 14
supreme 14
being 14

then 14
is 14
the 14
relation 14
of 14
actions 14
to 14
the 14
relation 14
of 14

that 14
is 14
to 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
potential 14
universal 14
legislation 14
by 14
its 14
maxims 14
an 14

one 14

the 14

from 14
what 14
has 14
just 14
been 14
said 14
it 14
is 14
easy 14
to 14
see 14
how 14
it 14
happens 14
that 14
although 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
duty 14
implies 14
subjection 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
we 14
yet 14
ascribe 14
a 14
certain 14
dignity 14
and 14
sublimity 14
to 14
the 14
person 14
who 14
fulfils 14
all 14
his 14
duties 14
there 14
is 14
not 14
indeed 14
any 14
sublimity 14
in 14
him 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
he 14
is 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
but 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
in 14
regard 14
to 14
that 14
very 14
law 14
he 14
is 14
likewise 14
a 14
legislator 14
and 14
on 14
that 14
account 14
alone 14
subject 14
to 14
it 14
he 14
has 14
sublimity 14
we 14
have 14
also 14
shown 14
above 14
that 14
neither 14
fear 14
nor 14
inclination 14
but 14
simply 14
respect 14
for 14
the 14
law 14
is 14
the 14
spring 14
which 14
can 14
give 14
actions 14
a 14
moral 14
worth 14
our 14
own 14
will 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
we 14
suppose 14
it 14
to 14
act 14
only 14
under 14
the 14
condition 14
that 14
its 14
maxims 14
are 14
potentially 14
universal 14
laws 14
this 14
ideal 14
will 14
which 14
is 14
possible 14
to 14
us 14
is 14
the 14
proper 14
object 14
of 14
respect 14
and 14
the 14
dignity 14
of 14
humanity 14
consists 14
just 14
in 14
this 14
capacity 14
of 14
being 14
universally 14
legislative 14
though 14
with 14
the 14
condition 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
itself 14
subject 14
to 14
this 14
same 14
legislation 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
the 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
that 14
property 14
of 14
it 14
by 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
law 14
to 14
itself 14
independently 14
of 14
any 14
property 14
of 14
the 14
objects 14
of 14
volition 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
autonomy 14
then 14
is 14
always 14
so 14
to 14
choose 14
that 14
the 14
same 14
volition 14
shall 14
comprehend 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
our 14
choice 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
we 14
cannot 14
prove 14
that 14
this 14
practical 14
rule 14
is 14
an 14
imperative 14
ie 14
that 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
is 14
necessarily 14
bound 14
to 14
it 14
as 14
a 14
condition 14
by 14
a 14
mere 14
analysis 14
of 14
the 14
conceptions 14
which 14
occur 14
in 14
it 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
synthetical 14
proposition 14
we 14
must 14
advance 14
beyond 14
the 14
cognition 14
of 14
the 14
objects 14
to 14
a 14
critical 14
examination 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
that 14
is 14
of 14
the 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
for 14
this 14
synthetic 14
proposition 14
which 14
commands 14
apodeictically 14
must 14
be 14
capable 14
of 14
being 14
cognized 14
wholly 14
a 14
priori 14
this 14
matter 14
however 14
does 14
not 14
belong 14
to 14
the 14
present 14
section 14
but 14
that 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
autonomy 14
in 14
question 14
is 14
the 14
sole 14
principle 14
of 14
morals 14
can 14
be 14
readily 14
shown 14
by 14
mere 14
analysis 14
of 14
the 14
conceptions 14
of 14
morality 14
for 14
by 14
this 14
analysis 14
we 14
find 14
that 14
its 14
principle 14
must 14
be 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
and 14
that 14
what 14
this 14
commands 14
is 14
neither 14
more 14
nor 14
less 14
than 14
this 14
very 14
autonomy 14
heteronomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
the 14
source 14
of 14
all 14
spurious 14
principles 14
of 14
morality 14
if 14
the 14
will 14
seeks 14
the 14
law 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
determine 14
it 14
anywhere 14
else 14
than 14
in 14
the 14
fitness 14
of 14
its 14
maxims 14
to 14
be 14
universal 14
laws 14
of 14
its 14
own 14
dictation 14
consequently 14
if 14
it 14
goes 14
out 14
of 14
itself 14
and 14
seeks 14
this 14
law 14
in 14
the 14
character 14
of 14
any 14
of 14
its 14
objects 14
there 14
always 14
results 14
heteronomy 14
the 14
will 14
in 14
that 14
case 14
does 14
not 14
give 14
itself 14
the 14
law 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
given 14
by 14
the 14
object 14
through 14
its 14
relation 14
to 14
the 14
will 14
this 14
relation 14
whether 14
it 14
rests 14
on 14
inclination 14
or 14
on 14
conceptions 14
of 14
reason 14
only 14
admits 14
of 14
hypothetical 14
imperatives 14
i 14
ought 14
to 14
do 14
something 14
because 14
i 14
wish 14
for 14
something 14
else 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
the 14
moral 14
and 14
therefore 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
says 14
i 14
ought 14
to 14
do 14
so 14
and 14
so 14
even 14
though 14
i 14
should 14
not 14

for 14
anything 14

lie 14
if 14
i 14

retain 14

the 14

says 14
i 14

not 14
to 14
lie 14
although 14
it 14

a 14
foundation 14
for 14
moral 14
laws 14
for 14

which 14
these 14

hold 14
for 14
all 14

beings 14

distinction 14
the 14
unconditional 14
practical 14
necessity 14
which 14
is 14
thereby 14
imposed 14
on 14
them 14
is 14
lost 14
when 14
their 14
foundation 14
is 14
taken 14
from 14
the 14
particular 14
constitution 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
or 14
the 14
accidental 14
circumstances 14
in 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
placed 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
private 14
happiness 14
however 14
is 14
the 14
most 14
objectionable 14
not 14
merely 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
false 14
and 14
experience 14
contradicts 14
the 14
supposition 14
that 14
prosperity 14
is 14
always 14
proportioned 14
to 14
good 14
conduct 14
nor 14
yet 14
merely 14
because 14
it 14
contributes 14
nothing 14
to 14
the 14
establishment 14
of 14
morality 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
quite 14
a 14
different 14
thing 14
to 14
make 14
a 14
prosperous 14
man 14
and 14
a 14
good 14
man 14
or 14
to 14
make 14
one 14
prudent 14
and 14
sharpsighted 14
for 14
his 14
own 14
interests 14
and 14
to 14
make 14
him 14
virtuous 14
but 14
because 14
the 14
springs 14
it 14
provides 14
for 14
morality 14
are 14
such 14
as 14
rather 14
undermine 14
it 14
and 14
destroy 14
its 14
sublimity 14
since 14
they 14
put 14
the 14
motives 14
to 14
virtue 14
and 14
to 14
vice 14
in 14
the 14
same 14
class 14
and 14
only 14
teach 14
us 14
to 14
make 14
a 14
better 14
calculation 14
the 14
specific 14
difference 14
between 14
virtue 14
and 14
vice 14
being 14
entirely 14
extinguished 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
as 14
to 14
moral 14
feeling 14
this 14
supposed 14
special 14
sense 14
the 14
appeal 14
to 14
it 14
is 14
indeed 14
superficial 14
when 14
those 14
who 14
cannot 14
think 14
believe 14
that 14
feeling 14
will 14
help 14
them 14
out 14
even 14
in 14
what 14
concerns 14
general 14
laws 14
and 14
besides 14
feelings 14
which 14
naturally 14
differ 14
infinitely 14
in 14
degree 14
cannot 14
furnish 14
a 14
uniform 14
standard 14
of 14
good 14
and 14
evil 14
nor 14
has 14
anyone 14
a 14
right 14
to 14
form 14
judgements 14
for 14
others 14
by 14
his 14
own 14
feelings 14
nevertheless 14
this 14
moral 14
feeling 14
is 14
nearer 14
to 14
morality 14
and 14
its 14
dignity 14
in 14
this 14
respect 14
that 14
it 14
pays 14
virtue 14
the 14
honour 14
of 14
ascribing 14
to 14
her 14
immediately 14
the 14
satisfaction 14
and 14
esteem 14
we 14
have 14
for 14
her 14
and 14
does 14
not 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
tell 14
her 14
to 14
her 14
face 14
that 14
we 14
are 14
not 14
attached 14
to 14
her 14
by 14
her 14
beauty 14
but 14
by 14
profit 14
i 14
class 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
moral 14
feeling 14
under 14
that 14
of 14
happiness 14
because 14
every 14
empirical 14
interest 14
promises 14
to 14
contribute 14
to 14
our 14
wellbeing 14
by 14
the 14
agreeableness 14
that 14
a 14
thing 14
affords 14
whether 14
it 14
be 14
immediately 14
and 14
without 14
a 14
view 14
to 14
profit 14
or 14
whether 14
profit 14
be 14
regarded 14
we 14
must 14
likewise 14
with 14
hutcheson 14
class 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
sympathy 14
with 14
the 14
happiness 14
of 14
others 14
under 14
his 14
assumed 14
moral 14
sense 14
amongst 14
the 14
rational 14
principles 14
of 14
morality 14
the 14
ontological 14
conception 14
of 14
perfection 14
notwithstanding 14
its 14
defects 14
is 14
better 14
than 14
the 14
theological 14
conception 14
which 14
derives 14
morality 14
from 14
a 14
divine 14
absolutely 14
perfect 14
will 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
no 14
doubt 14
empty 14
and 14
indefinite 14
and 14
consequently 14
useless 14
for 14
finding 14
in 14
the 14
boundless 14
field 14
of 14
possible 14
reality 14
the 14
greatest 14
amount 14
suitable 14
for 14
us 14
moreover 14
in 14
attempting 14
to 14
distinguish 14
specifically 14
the 14
reality 14
of 14
which 14
we 14
are 14
now 14
speaking 14
from 14
every 14
other 14
it 14
inevitably 14
tends 14
to 14
turn 14
in 14
a 14
circle 14
and 14
cannot 14
avoid 14
tacitly 14
presupposing 14
the 14
morality 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
to 14
explain 14
it 14
is 14
nevertheless 14
preferable 14
to 14
the 14
theological 14
view 14
first 14
because 14
we 14
have 14
no 14
intuition 14
of 14
the 14
divine 14
perfection 14
and 14
can 14
only 14
deduce 14
it 14
from 14
our 14
own 14
conceptions 14
the 14
most 14
important 14
of 14
which 14
is 14
that 14
of 14
morality 14
and 14
our 14
explanation 14
would 14
thus 14
be 14
involved 14
in 14
a 14
gross 14
circle 14
and 14
in 14
the 14
next 14
place 14
if 14
we 14
avoid 14
this 14
the 14
only 14
notion 14
of 14
the 14
divine 14
will 14
remaining 14
to 14
us 14
is 14
a 14
conception 14
made 14
up 14
of 14
the 14
attributes 14
of 14
desire 14
of 14
glory 14
and 14
dominion 14
combined 14
with 14
the 14
awful 14
conceptions 14
of 14
might 14
and 14
vengeance 14
and 14
any 14
system 14
of 14
morals 14
erected 14
on 14
this 14
foundation 14
would 14
be 14
directly 14
opposed 14
to 14
morality 14
however 14
if 14
i 14
had 14
to 14
choose 14
between 14
the 14
notion 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
sense 14
and 14
that 14
of 14
perfection 14
in 14
general 14
two 14
systems 14
which 14
at 14
least 14
do 14
not 14
weaken 14
morality 14
although 14
they 14
are 14
totally 14
incapable 14
of 14
serving 14
as 14
its 14
foundation 14
then 14
i 14
should 14
decide 14
for 14
the 14
latter 14
because 14
it 14
at 14
least 14
withdraws 14
the 14
decision 14
of 14
the 14
question 14
from 14
the 14
sensibility 14
and 14
brings 14
it 14
to 14
the 14
court 14
of 14
pure 14
reason 14
and 14
although 14
even 14
here 14
it 14
decides 14
nothing 14
it 14
at 14
all 14
events 14
preserves 14
the 14
indefinite 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
good 14
in 14
itself 14
free 14
from 14
corruption 14
until 14
it 14
shall 14
be 14
more 14
precisely 14
defined 14
for 14
the 14
rest 14
i 14
think 14
i 14
may 14
be 14
excused 14
here 14
from 14
a 14
detailed 14
refutation 14
of 14
all 14
these 14
doctrines 14
that 14
would 14
only 14
be 14
superfluous 14
labour 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
so 14
easy 14
and 14
is 14
probably 14
so 14
well 14
seen 14
even 14
by 14
those 14
whose 14
office 14
requires 14
them 14
to 14
decide 14
for 14
one 14
of 14
these 14
theories 14
because 14
their 14
hearers 14
would 14
not 14
tolerate 14
suspension 14
of 14
judgement 14
but 14
what 14
interests 14
us 14
more 14
here 14
is 14
to 14
know 14
that 14
the 14
prime 14
foundation 14
of 14
morality 14
laid 14
down 14
by 14
all 14
these 14
principles 14
is 14
nothing 14
but 14
heteronomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
and 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
they 14
must 14
necessarily 14
miss 14
their 14
aim 14
in 14
every 14
case 14
where 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
has 14
to 14
be 14
supposed 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
the 14
rule 14
may 14
be 14
prescribed 14
which 14
is 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
there 14
the 14
rule 14
is 14
simply 14
heteronomy 14
the 14
imperative 14
is 14
conditional 14
namely 14
if 14
or 14
because 14
one 14
wishes 14
for 14
this 14
object 14
one 14
should 14
act 14
so 14
and 14
so 14
hence 14
it 14
can 14
never 14
command 14
morally 14
that 14
is 14
categorically 14
whether 14
the 14
object 14
determines 14
the 14
will 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
inclination 14
as 14
in 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
private 14
happiness 14
or 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
reason 14
directed 14
to 14
objects 14
of 14
our 14
possible 14
volition 14
generally 14
as 14
in 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
perfection 14
in 14
either 14
case 14
the 14
will 14
never 14
determines 14
itself 14
immediately 14
by 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
but 14
only 14
by 14
the 14
influence 14
which 14
the 14
foreseen 14
effect 14
of 14
the 14
action 14
has 14
on 14
the 14
will 14
i 14
ought 14
to 14
do 14
something 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
because 14
i 14
wish 14
for 14
something 14
else 14
and 14
here 14
there 14
must 14
be 14
yet 14
another 14
law 14
assumed 14
in 14
me 14
as 14
its 14
subject 14
by 14
which 14
i 14
necessarily 14
will 14
this 14
other 14
thing 14
and 14
this 14
law 14
again 14
requires 14
an 14
imperative 14
to 14
restrict 14
this 14
maxim 14
for 14
the 14
influence 14
which 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
an 14
object 14
within 14
the 14
reach 14
of 14
our 14
faculties 14
can 14
exercise 14
on 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
in 14
consequence 14
of 14
its 14
natural 14
properties 14
depends 14
on 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
either 14
the 14
sensibility 14
inclination 14
and 14
taste 14
or 14
the 14
understanding 14
and 14
reason 14
the 14
employment 14
of 14
which 14
is 14
by 14
the 14
peculiar 14
constitution 14
of 14
their 14
nature 14
attended 14
with 14
satisfaction 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
the 14
law 14
would 14
be 14
properly 14
speaking 14
given 14
by 14
nature 14
and 14
as 14
such 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
known 14
and 14
proved 14
by 14
experience 14
and 14
would 14
consequently 14
be 14
contingent 14
and 14
therefore 14
incapable 14
of 14
being 14
an 14
apodeictic 14
practical 14
rule 14
such 14
as 14
the 14
moral 14
rule 14
must 14
be 14
not 14
only 14
so 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
inevitably 14
only 14
heteronomy 14
the 14
will 14
does 14
not 14
give 14
itself 14
the 14
law 14
but 14
is 14
given 14
by 14
a 14
foreign 14
impulse 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
a 14
particular 14
natural 14
constitution 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
adapted 14
to 14
receive 14
it 14
an 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
then 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
which 14
must 14
be 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
will 14
be 14
indeterminate 14
as 14
regards 14
all 14
objects 14
and 14
will 14
contain 14
merely 14
the 14
form 14
of 14
volition 14
generally 14
and 14
that 14
as 14
autonomy 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
the 14
capability 14
of 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
every 14
good 14
will 14
to 14
make 14
themselves 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
is 14
itself 14
the 14
only 14
law 14
which 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
imposes 14
on 14
itself 14
without 14
needing 14
to 14
assume 14
any 14
spring 14
or 14
interest 14
as 14
a 14
foundation 14
how 14
such 14
a 14
synthetical 14
practical 14
a 14
priori 14
proposition 14
is 14
possible 14
and 14
why 14
it 14
is 14
necessary 14
is 14
a 14
problem 14
whose 14
solution 14
does 14
not 14
lie 14
within 14
the 14
bounds 14
of 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
and 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
here 14
affirmed 14
its 14
truth 14
much 14
less 14
professed 14
to 14
have 14
a 14
proof 14
of 14
it 14
in 14
our 14
power 14
we 14
simply 14
showed 14
by 14
the 14
development 14
of 14
the 14
universally 14
received 14
notion 14
of 14
morality 14
that 14
an 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
inevitably 14
connected 14
with 14
it 14
or 14
rather 14
is 14
its 14
foundation 14
whoever 14
then 14
holds 14
morality 14
to 14
be 14
anything 14
real 14
and 14
not 14
a 14
chimerical 14
idea 14
without 14
any 14
truth 14
must 14
likewise 14
admit 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
it 14
that 14
is 14
here 14
assigned 14
this 14
section 14
then 14
like 14
the 14
first 14
was 14
merely 14
analytical 14
now 14
to 14
prove 14
that 14
morality 14
is 14
no 14
creation 14
of 14
the 14
brain 14
which 14
it 14
cannot 14
be 14
if 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
and 14
with 14
it 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
true 14
and 14
as 14
an 14
a 14
priori 14
principle 14
absolutely 14
necessary 14
this 14
supposes 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
a 14
synthetic 14
use 14
of 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
which 14
however 14
we 14
cannot 14
venture 14
on 14
without 14
first 14
giving 14
a 14
critical 14
examination 14
of 14
this 14
faculty 14
of 14
reason 14
in 14
the 14
concluding 14
section 14
we 14
shall 14
give 14
the 14
principal 14
outlines 14
of 14
this 14
critical 14
examination 14
as 14
far 14
as 14
is 14
sufficient 14
for 14
our 14
purpose 14
sec 14
third 14
section 14
transition 14
from 14
the 14
metaphysic 14
of 14
morals 14
to 14
the 14
critique 14
of 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
the 14
concept 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
the 14
key 14
that 14
explains 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
a 14
kind 14
of 14
causality 14
belonging 14
to 14
living 14
beings 14
in 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
they 14
are 14
rational 14
and 14
freedom 14
would 14
be 14
this 14
property 14
of 14
such 14
causality 14
that 14
it 14
can 14
be 14
efficient 14
independently 14
of 14
foreign 14
causes 14
determining 14
it 14
just 14
as 14
physical 14
necessity 14
is 14
the 14
property 14
that 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
all 14
irrational 14
beings 14
has 14
of 14
being 14
determined 14
to 14
activity 14
by 14
the 14
influence 14
of 14
foreign 14
causes 14
the 14
preceding 14
definition 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
negative 14
and 14
therefore 14
unfruitful 14
for 14
the 14
discovery 14
of 14
its 14
essence 14
but 14
it 14
leads 14
to 14
a 14
positive 14
conception 14
which 14
is 14
so 14
much 14
the 14
more 14
full 14
and 14
fruitful 14
since 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
causality 14
involves 14
that 14
of 14
laws 14
according 14
to 14
which 14
by 14
something 14
that 14
we 14
call 14
cause 14
something 14
else 14
namely 14
the 14
effect 14
must 14
be 14
produced 14
hence 14
although 14
freedom 14
is 14
not 14
a 14
property 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
depending 14
on 14
physical 14
laws 14
yet 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
for 14
that 14
reason 14
lawless 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
a 14
causality 14
acting 14
according 14
to 14
immutable 14
laws 14
but 14
of 14
a 14
peculiar 14
kind 14
otherwise 14
a 14
free 14
will 14
would 14
be 14
an 14
absurdity 14
physical 14
necessity 14
is 14
a 14
heteronomy 14
of 14
the 14
efficient 14
causes 14
for 14
every 14
effect 14
is 14
possible 14
only 14
according 14
to 14
this 14
law 14
that 14
something 14
else 14
determines 14
the 14
efficient 14
cause 14
to 14
exert 14
its 14
causality 14
what 14
else 14
then 14
can 14
freedom 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
be 14
but 14
autonomy 14
that 14
is 14
the 14
property 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
law 14
to 14
itself 14
but 14
the 14
proposition 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
in 14
every 14
action 14
a 14
law 14
to 14
itself 14
only 14
expresses 14
the 14
principle 14
to 14
act 14
on 14
no 14
other 14
maxim 14
than 14
that 14
which 14
can 14
also 14
have 14
as 14
an 14
object 14
itself 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
now 14
this 14
is 14
precisely 14
the 14
formula 14
of 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
and 14
is 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
so 14
that 14
a 14
free 14
will 14
and 14
a 14
will 14
subject 14
to 14
moral 14
laws 14
are 14
one 14
and 14
the 14
same 14
on 14
the 14
hypothesis 14
then 14
of 14
freedom 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
morality 14
together 14
with 14
its 14
principle 14
follows 14
from 14
it 14
by 14
mere 14
analysis 14
of 14
the 14
conception 14
however 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
a 14
synthetic 14
proposition 14
viz 14
an 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
is 14
that 14
whose 14
maxim 14
can 14
always 14
include 14
itself 14
regarded 14
as 14
a 14
universal 14
law 14
for 14
this 14
property 14
of 14
its 14
maxim 14
can 14
never 14
be 14
discovered 14
by 14
analysing 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
an 14
absolutely 14
good 14
will 14
now 14
such 14
synthetic 14
propositions 14
are 14
only 14
possible 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
that 14
the 14
two 14
cognitions 14
are 14
connected 14
together 14
by 14
their 14
union 14
with 14
a 14
third 14
in 14
which 14
they 14
are 14
both 14
to 14
be 14
found 14
the 14
positive 14
concept 14
of 14
freedom 14
furnishes 14
this 14
third 14
cognition 14
which 14
cannot 14
as 14
with 14
physical 14
causes 14
be 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
in 14
the 14
concept 14
of 14
which 14
we 14
find 14
conjoined 14
the 14
concept 14
of 14
something 14
in 14
relation 14
as 14
cause 14
to 14
something 14
else 14
as 14
effect 14
we 14
cannot 14
now 14
at 14
once 14
show 14
what 14
this 14
third 14
is 14
to 14
which 14
freedom 14
points 14
us 14
and 14
of 14
which 14
we 14
have 14
an 14
idea 14
a 14
priori 14
nor 14
can 14
we 14
make 14
intelligible 14
how 14
the 14
concept 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
shown 14
to 14
be 14
legitimate 14
from 14
principles 14
of 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
and 14
with 14
it 14
the 14
possibility 14
of 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
but 14
some 14
further 14
preparation 14
is 14
required 14
freedom 14
must 14
be 14
presupposed 14
as 14
a 14
property 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
to 14
predicate 14
freedom 14
of 14
our 14
own 14
will 14
from 14
whatever 14
reason 14
if 14
we 14
have 14
not 14
sufficient 14
grounds 14
for 14
predicating 14
the 14
same 14
of 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
for 14
as 14
morality 14
serves 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
for 14
us 14
only 14
because 14
we 14
are 14
rational 14
beings 14
it 14
must 14
also 14
hold 14
for 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
and 14
as 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
deduced 14
simply 14
from 14
the 14
property 14
of 14
freedom 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
shown 14
that 14
freedom 14
also 14
is 14
a 14
property 14
of 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
enough 14
then 14
to 14
prove 14
it 14
from 14
certain 14
supposed 14
experiences 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
which 14
indeed 14
is 14
quite 14
impossible 14
and 14
it 14
can 14
only 14
be 14
shown 14
a 14
priori 14
but 14
we 14
must 14
show 14
that 14
it 14
belongs 14
to 14
the 14
activity 14
of 14
all 14
rational 14
beings 14
endowed 14
with 14
a 14
will 14
now 14
i 14
say 14
every 14
being 14
that 14
cannot 14
act 14
except 14
under 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
just 14
for 14
that 14
reason 14
in 14
a 14
practical 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
really 14
free 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
all 14
laws 14
which 14
are 14
inseparably 14
connected 14
with 14
freedom 14
have 14
the 14
same 14
force 14
for 14
him 14
as 14
if 14
his 14
will 14
had 14
been 14
shown 14
to 14
be 14
free 14
in 14
itself 14
by 14
a 14
proof 14
theoretically 14
conclusive 14
now 14
i 14
affirm 14
that 14
we 14
must 14
attribute 14
to 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
which 14
has 14
a 14
will 14
that 14
it 14
has 14
also 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
and 14
acts 14
entirely 14
under 14
this 14
idea 14
for 14
in 14
such 14
a 14
being 14
we 14
conceive 14
a 14
reason 14
that 14
is 14
practical 14
that 14
is 14
has 14
causality 14
in 14
reference 14
to 14
its 14
objects 14
now 14
we 14
cannot 14
possibly 14
conceive 14
a 14
reason 14
consciously 14
receiving 14
a 14
bias 14
from 14
any 14
other 14
quarter 14
with 14
respect 14
to 14
its 14
judgements 14
for 14
then 14
the 14
subject 14
would 14
ascribe 14
the 14
determination 14
of 14
its 14
judgement 14
not 14
to 14
its 14
own 14
reason 14
but 14
to 14
an 14
impulse 14
it 14
must 14
regard 14
itself 14
as 14
the 14
author 14
of 14
its 14
principles 14
independent 14
of 14
foreign 14
influences 14
consequently 14
as 14
practical 14
reason 14
or 14
as 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
it 14
must 14
regard 14
itself 14
as 14
free 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
such 14
a 14
being 14
cannot 14
be 14
a 14
will 14
of 14
its 14
own 14
except 14
under 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
this 14
idea 14
must 14
therefore 14
in 14
a 14
practical 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
be 14
ascribed 14
to 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
i 14
adopt 14
this 14
method 14
of 14
assuming 14
freedom 14
merely 14
as 14
an 14
idea 14
which 14
rational 14
beings 14
suppose 14
in 14
their 14
actions 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
avoid 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
proving 14
it 14
in 14
its 14
theoretical 14
aspect 14
also 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
sufficient 14
for 14
my 14
purpose 14
for 14
even 14
though 14
the 14
speculative 14
proof 14
should 14
not 14
be 14
made 14
out 14
yet 14
a 14
being 14
that 14
cannot 14
act 14
except 14
with 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
bound 14
by 14
the 14
same 14
laws 14
that 14
would 14
oblige 14
a 14
being 14
who 14
was 14
actually 14
free 14
thus 14
we 14
can 14
escape 14
here 14
from 14
the 14
onus 14
which 14
presses 14
on 14
the 14
theory 14
of 14
the 14
interest 14
attaching 14
to 14
the 14
ideas 14
of 14
morality 14
we 14
have 14
finally 14
reduced 14
the 14
definite 14
conception 14
of 14
morality 14
to 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
this 14
latter 14
however 14
we 14
could 14
not 14
prove 14
to 14
be 14
actually 14
a 14
property 14
of 14
ourselves 14
or 14
of 14
human 14
nature 14
only 14
we 14
saw 14
that 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
presupposed 14
if 14
we 14
would 14
conceive 14
a 14
being 14
as 14
rational 14
and 14
conscious 14
of 14
its 14
causality 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
its 14
actions 14
ie 14
as 14
endowed 14
with 14
a 14
will 14
and 14
so 14
we 14
find 14
that 14
on 14
just 14
the 14
same 14
grounds 14
we 14
must 14
ascribe 14
to 14
every 14
being 14
endowed 14
with 14
reason 14
and 14
will 14
this 14
attribute 14
of 14
determining 14
itself 14
to 14
action 14
under 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
its 14
freedom 14
now 14
it 14
resulted 14
also 14
from 14
the 14
presupposition 14
of 14
these 14
ideas 14
that 14
we 14
became 14
aware 14
of 14
a 14
law 14
that 14
the 14
subjective 14
principles 14
of 14
action 14
ie 14
maxims 14
must 14
always 14
be 14
so 14
assumed 14
that 14
they 14
can 14
also 14
hold 14
as 14
objective 14
that 14
is 14
universal 14
principles 14
and 14
so 14
serve 14
as 14
universal 14
laws 14
of 14
our 14
own 14
dictation 14
but 14
why 14
then 14
should 14
i 14
subject 14
myself 14
to 14
this 14
principle 14
and 14
that 14
simply 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
thus 14
also 14
subjecting 14
to 14
it 14
all 14
other 14
being 14
endowed 14
with 14
reason 14
i 14
will 14
allow 14
that 14
no 14
interest 14
urges 14
me 14
to 14
this 14
for 14
that 14
would 14
not 14
give 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
but 14
i 14
must 14
take 14
an 14
interest 14
in 14
it 14
and 14
discern 14
how 14
this 14
comes 14
to 14
pass 14
for 14
this 14
properly 14
an 14
i 14
ought 14
is 14
properly 14
an 14
i 14
would 14
valid 14
for 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
provided 14
only 14
that 14
reason 14
determined 14
his 14
actions 14
without 14
any 14
hindrance 14
but 14
for 14
beings 14
that 14
are 14
in 14
addition 14
affected 14
as 14
we 14
are 14
by 14
springs 14
of 14
a 14
different 14
kind 14
namely 14
sensibility 14
and 14
in 14
whose 14
case 14
that 14
is 14
not 14
always 14
done 14
which 14
reason 14
alone 14
would 14
do 14
for 14
these 14
that 14
necessity 14
is 14
expressed 14
only 14
as 14
an 14
ought 14
and 14
the 14
subjective 14
necessity 14
is 14
different 14
from 14
the 14
objective 14
it 14
seems 14
then 14
as 14
if 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
that 14
is 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
were 14
properly 14
speaking 14
only 14
presupposed 14
in 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
and 14
as 14
if 14
we 14
could 14
not 14
prove 14
its 14
reality 14
and 14
objective 14
necessity 14
independently 14
in 14
that 14
case 14
we 14
should 14
still 14
have 14
gained 14
something 14
considerable 14
by 14
at 14
least 14
determining 14
the 14
true 14
principle 14
more 14
exactly 14
than 14
had 14
previously 14
been 14
done 14
but 14
as 14
regards 14
its 14
validity 14
and 14
the 14
practical 14
necessity 14
of 14
subjecting 14
oneself 14
to 14
it 14
we 14
should 14
not 14
have 14
advanced 14
a 14
step 14
for 14
if 14
we 14
were 14
asked 14
why 14
the 14
universal 14
validity 14
of 14
our 14
maxim 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
must 14
be 14
the 14
condition 14
restricting 14
our 14
actions 14
and 14
on 14
what 14
we 14
ground 14
the 14
worth 14
which 14
we 14
assign 14
to 14
this 14
manner 14
of 14
acting 14
a 14
worth 14
so 14
great 14
that 14
there 14
cannot 14
be 14
any 14
higher 14
interest 14
and 14
if 14
we 14
were 14
asked 14
further 14
how 14
it 14
happens 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
by 14
this 14
alone 14
a 14
man 14
believes 14
he 14
feels 14
his 14
own 14
personal 14
worth 14
in 14
comparison 14
with 14
which 14
that 14
of 14
an 14
agreeable 14
or 14
disagreeable 14
condition 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
regarded 14
as 14
nothing 14
to 14
these 14
questions 14
we 14
could 14
give 14
no 14
satisfactory 14
answer 14
we 14
find 14
indeed 14
sometimes 14
that 14
we 14
can 14
take 14
an 14
interest 14
in 14
a 14
personal 14
quality 14
which 14
does 14
not 14
involve 14
any 14
interest 14
of 14
external 14
condition 14
provided 14
this 14
quality 14
makes 14
us 14
capable 14
of 14
participating 14
in 14
the 14
condition 14
in 14
case 14
reason 14
were 14
to 14
effect 14
the 14
allotment 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
the 14
mere 14
being 14
worthy 14
of 14
happiness 14
can 14
interest 14
of 14
itself 14
even 14
without 14
the 14
motive 14
of 14
participating 14
in 14
this 14
happiness 14
this 14
judgement 14
however 14
is 14
in 14
fact 14
only 14
the 14
effect 14
of 14
the 14
importance 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
which 14
we 14
before 14
presupposed 14
when 14
by 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
we 14
detach 14
ourselves 14
from 14
every 14
empirical 14
interest 14
but 14
that 14
we 14
ought 14
to 14
detach 14
ourselves 14
from 14
these 14
interests 14
ie 14
to 14
consider 14
ourselves 14
as 14
free 14
in 14
action 14
and 14
yet 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
certain 14
laws 14
so 14
as 14
to 14
find 14
a 14
worth 14
simply 14
in 14
our 14
own 14
person 14
which 14
can 14
compensate 14
us 14
for 14
the 14
loss 14
of 14
everything 14
that 14
gives 14
worth 14
to 14
our 14
condition 14
this 14
we 14
are 14
not 14
yet 14
able 14
to 14
discern 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
nor 14
do 14
we 14
see 14
how 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
so 14
to 14
act 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
whence 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
derives 14
its 14
obligation 14
it 14
must 14
be 14
freely 14
admitted 14
that 14
there 14
is 14
a 14
sort 14
of 14
circle 14
here 14
from 14
which 14
it 14
seems 14
impossible 14
to 14
escape 14
in 14
the 14
order 14
of 14
efficient 14
causes 14
we 14
assume 14
ourselves 14
free 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
in 14
the 14
order 14
of 14
ends 14
we 14
may 14
conceive 14
ourselves 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
moral 14
laws 14
and 14
we 14
afterwards 14
conceive 14
ourselves 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
these 14
laws 14
because 14
we 14
have 14
attributed 14
to 14
ourselves 14
freedom 14
of 14
will 14
for 14
freedom 14
and 14
selflegislation 14
of 14
will 14
are 14
both 14
autonomy 14
and 14
therefore 14
are 14
reciprocal 14
conceptions 14
and 14
for 14
this 14
very 14
reason 14
one 14
must 14
not 14
be 14
used 14
to 14
explain 14
the 14
other 14
or 14
give 14
the 14
reason 14
of 14
it 14
but 14
at 14
most 14
only 14
logical 14
purposes 14
to 14
reduce 14
apparently 14
different 14
notions 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
object 14
to 14
one 14
single 14
concept 14
as 14
we 14
reduce 14
different 14
fractions 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
value 14
to 14
the 14
lowest 14
terms 14
one 14
resource 14
remains 14
to 14
us 14
namely 14
to 14
inquire 14
whether 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
occupy 14
different 14
points 14
of 14
view 14
when 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
freedom 14
we 14
think 14
ourselves 14
as 14
causes 14
efficient 14
a 14
priori 14
and 14
when 14
we 14
form 14
our 14
conception 14
of 14
ourselves 14
from 14
our 14
actions 14
as 14
effects 14
which 14
we 14
see 14
before 14
our 14
eyes 14
it 14
is 14
a 14
remark 14
which 14
needs 14
no 14
subtle 14
reflection 14
to 14
make 14
but 14
which 14
we 14
may 14
assume 14
that 14
even 14
the 14
commonest 14
understanding 14
can 14
make 14
although 14
it 14
be 14
after 14
its 14
fashion 14
by 14
an 14
obscure 14
discernment 14
of 14
judgement 14
which 14
it 14
calls 14
feeling 14
that 14
all 14
the 14
ideas 14
that 14
come 14
to 14
us 14
involuntarily 14
as 14
those 14
of 14
the 14
senses 14
do 14
not 14
enable 14
us 14
to 14
know 14
objects 14
otherwise 14
than 14
as 14
they 14
affect 14
us 14
so 14
that 14
what 14
they 14
may 14
be 14
in 14
themselves 14
remains 14
unknown 14
to 14
us 14
and 14
consequently 14
that 14
as 14
regards 14
ideas 14
of 14
this 14
kind 14
even 14
with 14
the 14
closest 14
attention 14
and 14
clearness 14
that 14
the 14
understanding 14
can 14
apply 14
to 14
them 14
we 14
can 14
by 14
them 14
only 14
attain 14
to 14
the 14
knowledge 14
of 14
appearances 14
never 14
to 14
that 14
of 14
things 14
in 14
themselves 14
as 14
soon 14
as 14
this 14
distinction 14
has 14
once 14
been 14
made 14
perhaps 14
merely 14
in 14
consequence 14
of 14
the 14
difference 14
observed 14
between 14
the 14
ideas 14
given 14
us 14
from 14
without 14
and 14
in 14
which 14
we 14
are 14
passive 14
and 14
those 14
that 14
we 14
produce 14
simply 14
from 14
ourselves 14
and 14
in 14
which 14
we 14
show 14
our 14
own 14
activity 14
then 14
it 14
follows 14
of 14
itself 14
that 14
we 14
must 14
admit 14
and 14
assume 14
behind 14
the 14
appearance 14
something 14
else 14
that 14
is 14
not 14
an 14
appearance 14
namely 14
the 14
things 14
in 14
themselves 14
although 14
we 14
must 14
admit 14
that 14
as 14
they 14
can 14
never 14
be 14
known 14
to 14
us 14
except 14
as 14
they 14
affect 14
us 14
we 14
can 14
come 14
no 14
nearer 14
to 14
them 14
nor 14
can 14
we 14
ever 14
know 14
what 14
they 14
are 14
in 14
themselves 14
this 14
must 14
furnish 14
a 14
distinction 14
however 14
crude 14
between 14
a 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
and 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
of 14
which 14
the 14
former 14
may 14
be 14
different 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
difference 14
of 14
the 14
sensuous 14
impressions 14
in 14
various 14
observers 14
while 14
the 14
second 14
which 14
is 14
its 14
basis 14
always 14
remains 14
the 14
same 14
even 14
as 14
to 14
himself 14
a 14
man 14
cannot 14
pretend 14
to 14
know 14
what 14
he 14
is 14
in 14
himself 14
from 14
the 14
knowledge 14
he 14
has 14
by 14
internal 14
sensation 14
for 14
as 14
he 14
does 14
not 14
as 14
it 14
were 14
create 14
himself 14
and 14
does 14
not 14
come 14
by 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
himself 14
a 14
priori 14
but 14
empirically 14
it 14
naturally 14
follows 14
that 14
he 14
can 14
obtain 14
his 14
knowledge 14
even 14
of 14
himself 14
only 14
by 14
the 14
inner 14
sense 14
and 14
consequently 14
only 14
through 14
the 14
appearances 14
of 14
his 14
nature 14
and 14
the 14
way 14
in 14
which 14
his 14
consciousness 14
is 14
affected 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
beyond 14
these 14
characteristics 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
subject 14
made 14
up 14
of 14
mere 14
appearances 14
he 14
must 14
necessarily 14
suppose 14
something 14
else 14
as 14
their 14
basis 14
namely 14
his 14
ego 14
whatever 14
its 14
characteristics 14
in 14
itself 14
may 14
be 14
thus 14
in 14
respect 14
to 14
mere 14
perception 14
and 14
receptivity 14
of 14
sensations 14
he 14
must 14
reckon 14
himself 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
but 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
whatever 14
there 14
may 14
be 14
of 14
pure 14
activity 14
in 14
him 14
that 14
which 14
reaches 14
consciousness 14
immediately 14
and 14
not 14
through 14
affecting 14
the 14
senses 14
he 14
must 14
reckon 14
himself 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
intellectual 14
world 14
of 14
which 14
however 14
he 14
has 14
no 14
further 14
knowledge 14
to 14
such 14
a 14
conclusion 14
the 14
reflecting 14
man 14
must 14
come 14
with 14
respect 14
to 14
all 14
the 14
things 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
presented 14
to 14
him 14
it 14
is 14
probably 14
to 14
be 14
met 14
with 14
even 14
in 14
persons 14
of 14
the 14
commonest 14
understanding 14
who 14
as 14
is 14
well 14
known 14
are 14
very 14
much 14
inclined 14
to 14
suppose 14
behind 14
the 14
objects 14
of 14
the 14
senses 14
something 14
else 14
invisible 14
and 14
acting 14
of 14
itself 14
they 14
spoil 14
it 14
however 14
by 14
presently 14
sensualizing 14
this 14
invisible 14
again 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
wanting 14
to 14
make 14
it 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
intuition 14
so 14
that 14
they 14
do 14
not 14
become 14
a 14
whit 14
the 14
wiser 14
now 14
man 14
really 14
finds 14
in 14
himself 14
a 14
faculty 14
by 14
which 14
he 14
distinguishes 14
himself 14
from 14
everything 14
else 14
even 14
from 14
himself 14
as 14
affected 14
by 14
objects 14
and 14
that 14
is 14
reason 14
this 14
being 14
pure 14
spontaneity 14
is 14
even 14
elevated 14
above 14
the 14
understanding 14
for 14
although 14
the 14
latter 14
is 14
a 14
spontaneity 14
and 14
does 14
not 14
like 14
sense 14
merely 14
contain 14
intuitions 14
that 14
arise 14
when 14
we 14
are 14
affected 14
by 14
things 14
and 14
are 14
therefore 14
passive 14
yet 14
it 14
cannot 14
produce 14
from 14
its 14
activity 14
any 14
other 14
conceptions 14
than 14
those 14
which 14
merely 14
serve 14
to 14
bring 14
the 14
intuitions 14
of 14
sense 14
under 14
rules 14
and 14
thereby 14
to 14
unite 14
them 14
in 14
one 14
consciousness 14
and 14
without 14
this 14
use 14
of 14
the 14
sensibility 14
it 14
could 14
not 14
think 14
at 14
all 14
whereas 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
reason 14
shows 14
so 14
pure 14
a 14
spontaneity 14
in 14
the 14
case 14
of 14
what 14
i 14
call 14
ideas 14
ideal 14
conceptions 14
that 14
it 14
thereby 14
far 14
transcends 14
everything 14
that 14
the 14
sensibility 14
can 14
give 14
it 14
and 14
exhibits 14
its 14
most 14
important 14
function 14
in 14
distinguishing 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
from 14
that 14
of 14
understanding 14
and 14
thereby 14
prescribing 14
the 14
limits 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
itself 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
must 14
regard 14
himself 14
qua 14
intelligence 14
not 14
from 14
the 14
side 14
of 14
his 14
lower 14
faculties 14
as 14
belonging 14
not 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
but 14
to 14
that 14
of 14
understanding 14
hence 14
he 14
has 14
two 14
points 14
of 14
view 14
from 14
which 14
he 14
can 14
regard 14
himself 14
and 14
recognise 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
exercise 14
of 14
his 14
faculties 14
and 14
consequently 14
of 14
all 14
his 14
actions 14
first 14
so 14
far 14
as 14
he 14
belongs 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
he 14
finds 14
himself 14
subject 14
to 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
heteronomy 14
secondly 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
intelligible 14
world 14
under 14
laws 14
which 14
being 14
independent 14
of 14
nature 14
have 14
their 14
foundation 14
not 14
in 14
experience 14
but 14
in 14
reason 14
alone 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
and 14
consequently 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
intelligible 14
world 14
man 14
can 14
never 14
conceive 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
will 14
otherwise 14
than 14
on 14
condition 14
of 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
for 14
independence 14
of 14
the 14
determinate 14
causes 14
of 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
an 14
independence 14
which 14
reason 14
must 14
always 14
ascribe 14
to 14
itself 14
is 14
freedom 14
now 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
inseparably 14
connected 14
with 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
autonomy 14
and 14
this 14
again 14
with 14
the 14
universal 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
which 14
is 14
ideally 14
the 14
foundation 14
of 14
all 14
actions 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
just 14
as 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
is 14
of 14
all 14
phenomena 14
now 14
the 14
suspicion 14
is 14
removed 14
which 14
we 14
raised 14
above 14
that 14
there 14
was 14
a 14
latent 14
circle 14
involved 14
in 14
our 14
reasoning 14
from 14
freedom 14
to 14
autonomy 14
and 14
from 14
this 14
to 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
viz 14
that 14
we 14
laid 14
down 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
because 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
only 14
that 14
we 14
might 14
afterwards 14
in 14
turn 14
infer 14
the 14
latter 14
from 14
freedom 14
and 14
that 14
consequently 14
we 14
could 14
assign 14
no 14
reason 14
at 14
all 14
for 14
this 14
law 14
but 14
could 14
only 14
present 14
it 14
as 14
a 14
petitio 14
principii 14
which 14
well 14
disposed 14
minds 14
would 14
gladly 14
concede 14
to 14
us 14
but 14
which 14
we 14
could 14
never 14
put 14
forward 14
as 14
a 14
provable 14
proposition 14
for 14
now 14
we 14
see 14
that 14
when 14
we 14
conceive 14
ourselves 14
as 14
free 14
we 14
transfer 14
ourselves 14
into 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
as 14
members 14
of 14
it 14
and 14
recognise 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
with 14
its 14
consequence 14
morality 14
whereas 14
if 14
we 14
conceive 14
ourselves 14
as 14
under 14
obligation 14
we 14
consider 14
ourselves 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
and 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
how 14
is 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
possible 14
every 14
rational 14
being 14
reckons 14
himself 14
qua 14
intelligence 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
simply 14
as 14
an 14
efficient 14
cause 14
belonging 14
to 14
that 14
world 14
that 14
he 14
calls 14
his 14
causality 14
a 14
will 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
side 14
he 14
is 14
also 14
conscious 14
of 14
himself 14
as 14
a 14
part 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
in 14
which 14
his 14
actions 14
which 14
are 14
mere 14
appearances 14
phenomena 14
of 14
that 14
causality 14
are 14
displayed 14
we 14
cannot 14
however 14
discern 14
how 14
they 14
are 14
possible 14
from 14
this 14
causality 14
which 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
know 14
but 14
instead 14
of 14
that 14
these 14
actions 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
must 14
be 14
viewed 14
as 14
determined 14
by 14
other 14
phenomena 14
namely 14
desires 14
and 14
inclinations 14
if 14
therefore 14
i 14
were 14
only 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
then 14
all 14
my 14
actions 14
would 14
perfectly 14
conform 14
to 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
pure 14
will 14
if 14
i 14
were 14
only 14
a 14
part 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
they 14
would 14
necessarily 14
be 14
assumed 14
to 14
conform 14
wholly 14
to 14
the 14
natural 14
law 14
of 14
desires 14
and 14
inclinations 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
to 14
the 14
heteronomy 14
of 14
nature 14
the 14
former 14
would 14
rest 14
on 14
morality 14
as 14
the 14
supreme 14
principle 14
the 14
latter 14
on 14
happiness 14
since 14
however 14
the 14

of 14
understanding 14
contains 14
the 14
foundation 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
and 14
consequently 14
of 14
its 14
laws 14
also 14
and 14
accordingly 14
gives 14
the 14
law 14
to 14
my 14
will 14
which 14
belongs 14
wholly 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
directly 14
and 14
must 14
be 14
conceived 14
as 14
doing 14
so 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
although 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
side 14
i 14
must 14
regard 14
myself 14
as 14
a 14
being 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
yet 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
side 14
i 14
must 14
recognize 14
myself 14
as 14
subject 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
ie 14
to 14
reason 14
which 14
contains 14
this 14
law 14
in 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
and 14
therefore 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
consequently 14
i 14
must 14
regard 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
as 14
imperatives 14
for 14
me 14
and 14
the 14
actions 14
which 14
conform 14
to 14
them 14
as 14
duties 14
and 14
thus 14
what 14
makes 14
categorical 14
imperatives 14
possible 14
is 14
this 14
that 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
makes 14
me 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
an 14
intelligible 14
world 14
in 14
consequence 14
of 14
which 14
if 14
i 14
were 14
nothing 14
else 14
all 14
my 14
actions 14
would 14
always 14
conform 14
to 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
but 14
as 14
i 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
intuite 14
myself 14
as 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
they 14
ought 14
so 14
to 14
conform 14
and 14
this 14
categorical 14
ought 14
implies 14
a 14
synthetic 14
a 14
priori 14
proposition 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
besides 14
my 14
will 14
as 14
affected 14
by 14
sensible 14
desires 14
there 14
is 14
added 14
further 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
will 14
but 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
pure 14
and 14
practical 14
of 14
itself 14
which 14
contains 14
the 14
supreme 14
condition 14
according 14
to 14
reason 14
of 14
the 14
former 14
will 14
precisely 14
as 14
to 14
the 14
intuitions 14
of 14
sense 14
there 14
are 14
added 14
concepts 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
which 14
of 14
themselves 14
signify 14
nothing 14
but 14
regular 14
form 14
in 14
general 14
and 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
synthetic 14
a 14
priori 14
propositions 14
become 14
possible 14
on 14
which 14
all 14
knowledge 14
of 14
physical 14
nature 14
rests 14
the 14
practical 14
use 14
of 14
common 14
human 14
reason 14
confirms 14
this 14
reasoning 14
there 14
is 14
no 14
one 14
not 14
even 14
the 14
most 14
consummate 14
villain 14
provided 14
only 14
that 14
he 14
is 14
otherwise 14
accustomed 14
to 14
the 14
use 14
of 14
reason 14
who 14
when 14
we 14
set 14
before 14
him 14
examples 14
of 14
honesty 14
of 14
purpose 14
of 14
steadfastness 14
in 14
following 14
good 14
maxims 14
of 14
sympathy 14
and 14
general 14
benevolence 14
even 14
combined 14
with 14
great 14
sacrifices 14
of 14
advantages 14
and 14
comfort 14
does 14
not 14
wish 14
that 14
he 14
might 14
also 14
possess 14
these 14
qualities 14
only 14
on 14
account 14
of 14
his 14
inclinations 14
and 14
impulses 14
he 14
cannot 14
attain 14
this 14
in 14
himself 14
but 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
he 14
wishes 14
to 14
be 14
free 14
from 14
such 14
inclinations 14
which 14
are 14
burdensome 14
to 14
himself 14
he 14
proves 14
by 14
this 14
that 14
he 14
transfers 14
himself 14
in 14
thought 14
with 14
a 14
will 14
free 14
from 14
the 14
impulses 14
of 14
the 14
sensibility 14
into 14
an 14
order 14
of 14
things 14
wholly 14
different 14
from 14
that 14
of 14
his 14
desires 14
in 14
the 14
field 14
of 14
the 14
sensibility 14
since 14
he 14
cannot 14
expect 14
to 14
obtain 14
by 14
that 14
wish 14
any 14
gratification 14
of 14
his 14
desires 14
nor 14
any 14
position 14
which 14
would 14
satisfy 14
any 14
of 14
his 14
actual 14
or 14
supposable 14
inclinations 14
for 14
this 14
would 14
destroy 14
the 14
preeminence 14
of 14
the 14
very 14
idea 14
which 14
wrests 14
that 14
wish 14
from 14
him 14
he 14
can 14
only 14
expect 14
a 14
greater 14
intrinsic 14
worth 14
of 14
his 14
own 14
person 14
this 14
better 14
person 14
however 14
he 14
imagines 14
himself 14
to 14
be 14
when 14
be 14
transfers 14
himself 14
to 14
the 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
of 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
to 14
which 14
he 14
is 14
involuntarily 14
forced 14
by 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
ie 14
of 14
independence 14
on 14
determining 14
causes 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
and 14
from 14
this 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
he 14
is 14
conscious 14
of 14
a 14
good 14
will 14
which 14
by 14
his 14
own 14
confession 14
constitutes 14
the 14
law 14
for 14
the 14
bad 14
will 14
that 14
he 14
possesses 14
as 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
a 14
law 14
whose 14
authority 14
he 14
recognizes 14
while 14
transgressing 14
it 14
what 14
he 14
morally 14
ought 14
is 14
then 14
what 14
he 14
necessarily 14
would 14
as 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
and 14
is 14
conceived 14
by 14
him 14
as 14
an 14
ought 14
only 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
he 14
likewise 14
considers 14
himself 14
as 14
a 14
member 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
of 14
the 14
extreme 14
limits 14
of 14
all 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
all 14
men 14
attribute 14
to 14
themselves 14
freedom 14
of 14
will 14
hence 14
come 14
all 14
judgements 14
upon 14
actions 14
as 14
being 14
such 14
as 14
ought 14
to 14
have 14
been 14
done 14
although 14
they 14
have 14
not 14
been 14
done 14
however 14
this 14
freedom 14
is 14
not 14
a 14
conception 14
of 14
experience 14
nor 14
can 14
it 14
be 14
so 14
since 14
it 14
still 14
remains 14
even 14
though 14
experience 14
shows 14
the 14
contrary 14
of 14
what 14
on 14
supposition 14
of 14
freedom 14
are 14
conceived 14
as 14
its 14
necessary 14
consequences 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
side 14
it 14
is 14
equally 14
necessary 14
that 14
everything 14
that 14
takes 14
place 14
should 14
be 14
fixedly 14
determined 14
according 14
to 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
this 14
necessity 14
of 14
nature 14
is 14
likewise 14
not 14
an 14
empirical 14
conception 14
just 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
that 14
it 14
involves 14
the 14
motion 14
of 14
necessity 14
and 14
consequently 14
of 14
a 14
priori 14
cognition 14
but 14
this 14
conception 14
of 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
nature 14
is 14
confirmed 14
by 14
experience 14
and 14
it 14
must 14
even 14
be 14
inevitably 14
presupposed 14
if 14
experience 14
itself 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
possible 14
that 14
is 14
a 14
connected 14
knowledge 14
of 14
the 14
objects 14
of 14
sense 14
resting 14
on 14
general 14
laws 14
therefore 14
freedom 14
is 14
only 14
an 14
idea 14
of 14
reason 14
and 14
its 14
objective 14
reality 14
in 14
itself 14
is 14
doubtful 14
while 14
nature 14
is 14
a 14
concept 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
which 14
proves 14
and 14
must 14
necessarily 14
prove 14
its 14
reality 14
in 14
examples 14
of 14
experience 14
there 14
arises 14
from 14
this 14
a 14
dialectic 14
of 14
reason 14
since 14
the 14
freedom 14
attributed 14
to 14
the 14
will 14
appears 14
to 14
contradict 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
placed 14
between 14
these 14
two 14
ways 14
reason 14
for 14
speculative 14
purposes 14
finds 14
the 14
road 14
of 14
physical 14
necessity 14
much 14
more 14
beaten 14
and 14
more 14
appropriate 14
than 14
that 14
of 14
freedom 14
yet 14
for 14
practical 14
purposes 14
the 14
narrow 14
footpath 14
of 14
freedom 14
is 14
the 14
only 14
one 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
to 14
make 14
use 14
of 14
reason 14
in 14
our 14
conduct 14
hence 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
as 14
impossible 14
for 14
the 14
subtlest 14
philosophy 14
as 14
for 14
the 14
commonest 14
reason 14
of 14
men 14
to 14
argue 14
away 14
freedom 14
philosophy 14
must 14
then 14
assume 14
that 14
no 14
real 14
contradiction 14
will 14
be 14
found 14
between 14
freedom 14
and 14
physical 14
necessity 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
human 14
actions 14
for 14
it 14
cannot 14
give 14
up 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
nature 14
any 14
more 14
than 14
that 14
of 14
freedom 14
nevertheless 14
even 14
though 14
we 14
should 14
never 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
comprehend 14
how 14
freedom 14
is 14
possible 14
we 14
must 14
at 14
least 14
remove 14
this 14
apparent 14
contradiction 14
in 14
a 14
convincing 14
manner 14
for 14
if 14
the 14
thought 14
of 14
freedom 14
contradicts 14
either 14
itself 14
or 14
nature 14
which 14
is 14
equally 14
necessary 14
it 14
must 14
in 14
competition 14
with 14
physical 14
necessity 14
be 14
entirely 14
given 14
up 14
it 14
would 14
however 14
be 14
impossible 14
to 14
escape 14
this 14
contradiction 14
if 14
the 14
thinking 14
subject 14
which 14
seems 14
to 14
itself 14
free 14
conceived 14
itself 14
in 14
the 14
same 14
sense 14
or 14
in 14
the 14
very 14
same 14
relation 14
when 14
it 14
calls 14
itself 14
free 14
as 14
when 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
action 14
it 14
assumes 14
itself 14
to 14
be 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
hence 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
indispensable 14
problem 14
of 14
speculative 14
philosophy 14
to 14
show 14
that 14
its 14
illusion 14
respecting 14
the 14
contradiction 14
rests 14
on 14
this 14
that 14
we 14
think 14
of 14
man 14
in 14
a 14
different 14
sense 14
and 14
relation 14
when 14
we 14
call 14
him 14
free 14
and 14
when 14
we 14
regard 14
him 14
as 14
subject 14
to 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
as 14
being 14
part 14
and 14
parcel 14
of 14
nature 14
it 14
must 14
therefore 14
show 14
that 14
not 14
only 14
can 14
both 14
these 14
very 14
well 14
coexist 14
but 14
that 14
both 14
must 14
be 14
thought 14
as 14
necessarily 14
united 14
in 14
the 14
same 14
subject 14
since 14
otherwise 14
no 14
reason 14
could 14
be 14
given 14
why 14
we 14
should 14
burden 14
reason 14
with 14
an 14
idea 14
which 14
though 14
it 14
may 14
possibly 14
without 14
contradiction 14
be 14
reconciled 14
with 14
another 14
that 14
is 14
sufficiently 14
established 14
yet 14
entangles 14
us 14
in 14
a 14
perplexity 14
which 14
sorely 14
embarrasses 14
reason 14
in 14
its 14
theoretic 14
employment 14
this 14
duty 14
however 14
belongs 14
only 14
to 14
speculative 14
philosophy 14
the 14
philosopher 14
then 14
has 14
no 14
option 14
whether 14
he 14
will 14
remove 14
the 14
apparent 14
contradiction 14
or 14
leave 14
it 14
untouched 14
for 14
in 14
the 14
latter 14
case 14
the 14
theory 14
respecting 14
this 14
would 14
be 14
bonum 14
vacans 14
into 14
the 14
possession 14
of 14
which 14
the 14
fatalist 14
would 14
have 14
a 14
right 14
to 14
enter 14
and 14
chase 14
all 14
morality 14
out 14
of 14
its 14
supposed 14
domain 14
as 14
occupying 14
it 14
without 14
title 14
we 14
cannot 14
however 14
as 14
yet 14
say 14
that 14
we 14
are 14
touching 14
the 14
bounds 14
of 14
practical 14
philosophy 14
for 14
the 14
settlement 14
of 14
that 14
controversy 14
does 14
not 14
belong 14
to 14
it 14
it 14
only 14
demands 14
from 14
speculative 14
reason 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
put 14
an 14
end 14
to 14
the 14
discord 14
in 14
which 14
it 14
entangles 14
itself 14
in 14
theoretical 14
questions 14
so 14
that 14
practical 14
reason 14
may 14
have 14
rest 14
and 14
security 14
from 14
external 14
attacks 14
which 14
might 14
make 14
the 14
ground 14
debatable 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
desires 14
to 14
build 14
the 14
claims 14
to 14
freedom 14
of 14
will 14
made 14
even 14
by 14
common 14
reason 14
are 14
founded 14
on 14
the 14
consciousness 14
and 14
the 14
admitted 14
supposition 14
that 14
reason 14
is 14
independent 14
of 14
merely 14
subjectively 14
determined 14
causes 14
which 14
together 14
constitute 14
what 14
belongs 14
to 14
sensation 14
only 14
and 14
which 14
consequently 14
come 14
under 14
the 14
general 14
designation 14
of 14
sensibility 14
man 14
considering 14
himself 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
places 14
himself 14
thereby 14
in 14
a 14
different 14
order 14
of 14
things 14
and 14
in 14
a 14
relation 14
to 14
determining 14
grounds 14
of 14
a 14
wholly 14
different 14
kind 14
when 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
hand 14
he 14
thinks 14
of 14
himself 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
endowed 14
with 14
a 14
will 14
and 14
consequently 14
with 14
causality 14
and 14
when 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
he 14
perceives 14
himself 14
as 14
a 14
phenomenon 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
as 14
he 14
really 14
is 14
also 14
and 14
affirms 14
that 14
his 14
causality 14
is 14
subject 14
to 14
external 14
determination 14
according 14
to 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
now 14
he 14
soon 14
becomes 14
aware 14
that 14
both 14
can 14
hold 14
good 14
nay 14
must 14
hold 14
good 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
for 14
there 14
is 14
not 14
the 14
smallest 14
contradiction 14
in 14
saying 14
that 14
a 14
thing 14
in 14
appearance 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
is 14
subject 14
to 14
certain 14
laws 14
of 14
which 14
the 14
very 14
same 14
as 14
a 14
thing 14
or 14
being 14
in 14
itself 14
is 14
independent 14
and 14
that 14
he 14
must 14
conceive 14
and 14
think 14
of 14
himself 14
in 14
this 14
twofold 14
way 14
rests 14
as 14
to 14
the 14
first 14
on 14
the 14
consciousness 14
of 14
himself 14
as 14
an 14
object 14
affected 14
through 14
the 14
senses 14
and 14
as 14
to 14
the 14
second 14
on 14
the 14
consciousness 14
of 14
himself 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
ie 14
as 14
independent 14
on 14
sensible 14
impressions 14
in 14
the 14
employment 14
of 14
his 14
reason 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
as 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
hence 14
it 14
comes 14
to 14
pass 14
that 14
man 14
claims 14
the 14
possession 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
which 14
takes 14
no 14
account 14
of 14
anything 14
that 14
comes 14
under 14
the 14
head 14
of 14
desires 14
and 14
inclinations 14
and 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
conceives 14
actions 14
as 14
possible 14
to 14
him 14
nay 14
even 14
as 14
necessary 14
which 14
can 14
only 14
be 14
done 14
by 14
disregarding 14
all 14
desires 14
and 14
sensible 14
inclinations 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
such 14
actions 14
lies 14
in 14
him 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
and 14
in 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
effects 14
and 14
actions 14
which 14
depend 14
on 14
the 14
principles 14
of 14
an 14
intelligible 14
world 14
of 14
which 14
indeed 14
he 14
knows 14
nothing 14
more 14
than 14
that 14
in 14
it 14
pure 14
reason 14
alone 14
independent 14
of 14
sensibility 14
gives 14
the 14
law 14
moreover 14
since 14
it 14
is 14
only 14
in 14
that 14
world 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
that 14
he 14
is 14
his 14
proper 14
self 14
being 14
as 14
man 14
only 14
the 14
appearance 14
of 14
himself 14
those 14
laws 14
apply 14
to 14
him 14
directly 14
and 14
categorically 14
so 14
that 14
the 14
incitements 14
of 14
inclinations 14
and 14
appetites 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
the 14
whole 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
cannot 14
impair 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
his 14
volition 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
nay 14
he 14
does 14
not 14
even 14
hold 14
himself 14
responsible 14
for 14
the 14
former 14
or 14
ascribe 14
them 14
to 14
his 14
proper 14
self 14
ie 14
his 14
will 14
he 14
only 14
ascribes 14
to 14
his 14
will 14
any 14
indulgence 14
which 14
he 14
might 14
yield 14
them 14
if 14
he 14
allowed 14
them 14
to 14
influence 14
his 14
maxims 14
to 14
the 14
prejudice 14
of 14
the 14
rational 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
when 14
practical 14
reason 14
thinks 14
itself 14
into 14
a 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
it 14
does 14
not 14
thereby 14
transcend 14
its 14
own 14
limits 14
as 14
it 14
would 14
if 14
it 14
tried 14
to 14
enter 14
it 14
by 14
intuition 14
or 14
sensation 14
the 14
former 14
is 14
only 14
a 14
negative 14
thought 14
in 14
respect 14
of 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
which 14
does 14
not 14
give 14
any 14
laws 14
to 14
reason 14
in 14
determining 14
the 14
will 14
and 14
is 14
positive 14
only 14
in 14
this 14
single 14
point 14
that 14
this 14
freedom 14
as 14
a 14
negative 14
characteristic 14
is 14
at 14
the 14
same 14
time 14
conjoined 14
with 14
a 14
positive 14
faculty 14
and 14
even 14
with 14
a 14
causality 14
of 14
reason 14
which 14
we 14
designate 14
a 14
will 14
namely 14
a 14
faculty 14
of 14
so 14
acting 14
that 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
the 14
actions 14
shall 14
conform 14
to 14
the 14
essential 14
character 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
motive 14
ie 14
the 14
condition 14
that 14
the 14
maxim 14
have 14
universal 14
validity 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
but 14
were 14
it 14
to 14
borrow 14
an 14
object 14
of 14
will 14
that 14
is 14
a 14
motive 14
from 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
then 14
it 14
would 14
overstep 14
its 14
bounds 14
and 14
pretend 14
to 14
be 14
acquainted 14
with 14
something 14
of 14
which 14
it 14
knows 14
nothing 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
a 14
world 14
of 14
the 14
understanding 14
is 14
then 14
only 14
a 14
point 14
of 14
view 14
which 14
reason 14
finds 14
itself 14
compelled 14
to 14
take 14
outside 14
the 14
appearances 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
conceive 14
itself 14
as 14
practical 14
which 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
possible 14
if 14
the 14
influences 14
of 14
the 14
sensibility 14
had 14
a 14
determining 14
power 14
on 14
man 14
but 14
which 14
is 14
necessary 14
unless 14
he 14
is 14
to 14
be 14
denied 14
the 14
consciousness 14
of 14
himself 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
and 14
consequently 14
as 14
a 14
rational 14
cause 14
energizing 14
by 14
reason 14
that 14
is 14
operating 14
freely 14
this 14
thought 14
certainly 14
involves 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
an 14
order 14
and 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
laws 14
different 14
from 14
that 14
of 14
the 14
mechanism 14
of 14
nature 14
which 14
belongs 14
to 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
and 14
it 14
makes 14
the 14
conception 14
of 14
an 14
intelligible 14
world 14
necessary 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
the 14
whole 14
system 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
as 14
things 14
in 14
themselves 14
but 14
it 14
does 14
not 14
in 14
the 14
least 14
authorize 14
us 14
to 14
think 14
of 14
it 14
further 14
than 14
as 14
to 14
its 14
formal 14
condition 14
only 14
that 14
is 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
as 14
laws 14
and 14
consequently 14
the 14
autonomy 14
of 14
the 14
latter 14
which 14
alone 14
is 14
consistent 14
with 14
its 14
freedom 14
whereas 14
on 14
the 14
contrary 14
all 14
laws 14
that 14
refer 14
to 14
a 14
definite 14
object 14
give 14
heteronomy 14
which 14
only 14
belongs 14
to 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
can 14
only 14
apply 14
to 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
but 14
reason 14
would 14
overstep 14
all 14
its 14
bounds 14
if 14
it 14
undertook 14
to 14
explain 14
how 14
pure 14
reason 14
can 14
be 14
practical 14
which 14
would 14
be 14
exactly 14
the 14
same 14
problem 14
as 14
to 14
explain 14
how 14
freedom 14
is 14
possible 14
for 14
we 14
can 14
explain 14
nothing 14
but 14
that 14
which 14
we 14
can 14
reduce 14
to 14
laws 14
the 14
object 14
of 14
which 14
can 14
be 14
given 14
in 14
some 14
possible 14
experience 14
but 14
freedom 14
is 14
a 14
mere 14
idea 14
the 14
objective 14
reality 14
of 14
which 14
can 14
in 14
no 14
wise 14
be 14
shown 14
according 14
to 14
laws 14
of 14
nature 14
and 14
consequently 14
not 14
in 14
any 14
possible 14
experience 14
and 14
for 14
this 14
reason 14
it 14
can 14
never 14
be 14
comprehended 14
or 14
understood 14
because 14
we 14
cannot 14
support 14
it 14
by 14
any 14
sort 14
of 14
example 14
or 14
analogy 14
it 14
holds 14
good 14
only 14
as 14
a 14
necessary 14
hypothesis 14
of 14
reason 14
in 14
a 14
being 14
that 14
believes 14
itself 14
conscious 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
that 14
is 14
of 14
a 14
faculty 14
distinct 14
from 14
mere 14
desire 14
namely 14
a 14
faculty 14
of 14
determining 14
itself 14
to 14
action 14
as 14
an 14
intelligence 14
in 14
other 14
words 14

there 14
all 14
explanation 14
ceases 14
also 14
and 14
nothing 14
remains 14
but 14
defence 14
ie 14
the 14
removal 14
of 14
the 14
objections 14
of 14
those 14
who 14
pretend 14
to 14
have 14
seen 14
deeper 14
into 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
things 14
and 14
thereupon 14
boldly 14
declare 14
freedom 14
impossible 14
we 14
can 14
only 14
point 14
out 14
to 14
them 14
that 14
the 14
supposed 14
contradiction 14
that 14
they 14
have 14
discovered 14
in 14
it 14
arises 14
only 14
from 14
this 14
that 14
in 14
order 14
to 14
be 14
able 14
to 14
apply 14
the 14
law 14
of 14
nature 14
to 14
human 14
actions 14
they 14
must 14
necessarily 14
consider 14
man 14
as 14
an 14
appearance 14
then 14
when 14
we 14
demand 14
of 14
them 14
that 14
they 14
should 14
also 14
think 14
of 14
him 14
qua 14
intelligence 14
as 14
a 14
thing 14
in 14
itself 14
they 14
still 14
persist 14
in 14
considering 14
him 14
in 14
this 14
respect 14
also 14
as 14
an 14
appearance 14
in 14
this 14
view 14
it 14
would 14
no 14
doubt 14
be 14
a 14
contradiction 14
to 14
suppose 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
subject 14
that 14
is 14
his 14
will 14
to 14
be 14
withdrawn 14
from 14
all 14
the 14
natural 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
but 14
this 14
contradiction 14
disappears 14
if 14
they 14
would 14
only 14
bethink 14
themselves 14
and 14
admit 14
as 14
is 14
reasonable 14
that 14
behind 14
the 14
appearances 14
there 14
must 14
also 14
lie 14
at 14
their 14
root 14
although 14
hidden 14
the 14
things 14
in 14
themselves 14
and 14
that 14
we 14
cannot 14
expect 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
these 14
to 14
be 14
the 14
same 14
as 14
those 14
that 14
govern 14
their 14
appearances 14
the 14
subjective 14
impossibility 14
of 14
explaining 14
the 14
freedom 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
is 14
identical 14
with 14
the 14
impossibility 14
of 14
discovering 14
and 14
explaining 14
an 14
interest 14
which 14
man 14
can 14
take 14
in 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
nevertheless 14
he 14
does 14
actually 14
take 14
an 14
interest 14
in 14
it 14
the 14
basis 14
of 14
which 14
in 14
us 14
we 14
call 14
the 14
moral 14
feeling 14
which 14
some 14
have 14
falsely 14
assigned 14
as 14
the 14
standard 14
of 14
our 14
moral 14
judgement 14
whereas 14
it 14
must 14
rather 14
be 14
viewed 14
as 14
the 14
subjective 14
effect 14
that 14
the 14
law 14
exercises 14
on 14
the 14
will 14
the 14
objective 14
principle 14
of 14
which 14
is 14
furnished 14
by 14
reason 14
alone 14
interest 14
is 14
that 14
by 14
which 14
reason 14
becomes 14
practical 14
ie 14
a 14
cause 14
determining 14
the 14
will 14
hence 14
we 14
say 14
of 14
rational 14
beings 14
only 14
that 14
they 14
take 14
an 14
interest 14
in 14
a 14
thing 14
irrational 14
beings 14
only 14
feel 14
sensual 14
appetites 14
reason 14
takes 14
a 14
direct 14
interest 14
in 14
action 14
then 14
only 14
when 14
the 14
universal 14
validity 14
of 14
its 14
maxims 14
is 14
alone 14
sufficient 14
to 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
such 14
an 14
interest 14
alone 14
is 14
pure 14
but 14
if 14
it 14
can 14
determine 14
the 14
will 14
only 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
another 14
object 14
of 14
desire 14
or 14
on 14
the 14
suggestion 14
of 14
a 14
particular 14
feeling 14
of 14
the 14
subject 14
then 14
reason 14
takes 14
only 14
an 14
indirect 14
interest 14
in 14
the 14
action 14
and 14
as 14
reason 14
by 14
itself 14
without 14
experience 14
cannot 14
discover 14
either 14
objects 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
or 14
a 14
special 14
feeling 14
actuating 14
it 14
this 14
latter 14
interest 14
would 14
only 14
be 14
empirical 14
and 14
not 14
a 14
pure 14
rational 14
interest 14
the 14
logical 14
interest 14
of 14
reason 14
namely 14
to 14
extend 14
its 14
insight 14
is 14
never 14
direct 14
but 14
presupposes 14
purposes 14
for 14
which 14
reason 14
is 14
employed 14
in 14
order 14
indeed 14
that 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
who 14
is 14
also 14
affected 14
through 14
the 14
senses 14
should 14
will 14
what 14
reason 14
alone 14
directs 14
such 14
beings 14
that 14
they 14
ought 14
to 14
will 14
it 14
is 14
no 14
doubt 14
requisite 14
that 14
reason 14
should 14
have 14
a 14
power 14
to 14
infuse 14
a 14
feeling 14
of 14
pleasure 14
or 14
satisfaction 14
in 14
the 14
fulfilment 14
of 14
duty 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
that 14
it 14
should 14
have 14
a 14
causality 14
by 14
which 14
it 14
determines 14
the 14
sensibility 14
according 14
to 14
its 14
own 14
principles 14
but 14
it 14
is 14
quite 14
impossible 14
to 14
discern 14
ie 14
to 14
make 14
it 14
intelligible 14
a 14
priori 14
how 14
a 14
mere 14
thought 14
which 14
itself 14
contains 14
nothing 14
sensible 14
can 14
itself 14
produce 14
a 14
sensation 14
of 14
pleasure 14
or 14
pain 14
for 14
this 14
is 14
a 14
particular 14
kind 14
of 14
causality 14
of 14
which 14
as 14
of 14
every 14
other 14
causality 14
we 14
can 14
determine 14
nothing 14
whatever 14
a 14
priori 14
we 14
must 14
only 14
consult 14
experience 14
about 14
it 14
but 14
as 14
this 14
cannot 14
supply 14
us 14
with 14
any 14
relation 14
of 14
cause 14
and 14
effect 14
except 14
between 14
two 14
objects 14
of 14
experience 14
whereas 14
in 14
this 14
case 14
although 14
indeed 14
the 14
effect 14
produced 14
lies 14
within 14
experience 14
yet 14
the 14
cause 14
is 14
supposed 14
to 14
be 14
pure 14
reason 14
acting 14
through 14
mere 14
ideas 14
which 14
offer 14
no 14
object 14
to 14
experience 14
it 14
follows 14
that 14
for 14
us 14
men 14
it 14
is 14
quite 14
impossible 14
to 14
explain 14
how 14
and 14
why 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
the 14
maxim 14
as 14
a 14
law 14
that 14
is 14
morality 14
interests 14
this 14
only 14
is 14
certain 14
that 14
it 14
is 14
not 14
because 14
it 14
interests 14
us 14
that 14
it 14
has 14
validity 14
for 14
us 14
for 14
that 14
would 14
be 14
heteronomy 14
and 14
dependence 14
of 14
practical 14
reason 14
on 14
sensibility 14
namely 14
on 14
a 14
feeling 14
as 14
its 14
principle 14
in 14
which 14
case 14
it 14
could 14
never 14
give 14
moral 14
laws 14
but 14
that 14
it 14
interests 14
us 14
because 14
it 14
is 14
valid 14
for 14
us 14
as 14
men 14
inasmuch 14
as 14
it 14
had 14
its 14
source 14
in 14
our 14
will 14
as 14
intelligences 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
in 14
our 14
proper 14
self 14
and 14
what 14
belongs 14
to 14
mere 14
appearance 14
is 14
necessarily 14
subordinated 14
by 14
reason 14
to 14
the 14
nature 14
of 14
the 14
thing 14
in 14
itself 14
the 14
question 14
then 14
how 14
a 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
is 14
possible 14
can 14
be 14
answered 14
to 14
this 14
extent 14
that 14
we 14
can 14
assign 14
the 14
only 14
hypothesis 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
possible 14
namely 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
freedom 14
and 14
we 14
can 14
also 14
discern 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
this 14
hypothesis 14
and 14
this 14
is 14
sufficient 14
for 14
the 14
practical 14
exercise 14
of 14
reason 14
that 14
is 14
for 14
the 14
conviction 14
of 14
the 14
validity 14
of 14
this 14
imperative 14
and 14
hence 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
law 14
but 14
how 14
this 14
hypothesis 14
itself 14
is 14
possible 14
can 14
never 14
be 14
discerned 14
by 14
any 14
human 14
reason 14
on 14
the 14
hypothesis 14
however 14
that 14
the 14
will 14
of 14
an 14
intelligence 14
is 14
free 14
its 14
autonomy 14
as 14
the 14
essential 14
formal 14
condition 14
of 14
its 14
determination 14
is 14
a 14
necessary 14
consequence 14
moreover 14
this 14
freedom 14
of 14
will 14
is 14
not 14
merely 14
quite 14
possible 14
as 14
a 14
hypothesis 14
not 14
involving 14
any 14
contradiction 14
to 14
the 14
principle 14
of 14
physical 14
necessity 14
in 14
the 14
connexion 14
of 14
the 14
phenomena 14
of 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
as 14
speculative 14
philosophy 14
can 14
show 14
but 14
further 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
who 14
is 14
conscious 14
of 14
causality 14
through 14
reason 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
distinct 14
from 14
desires 14
must 14
of 14
necessity 14
make 14
it 14
practically 14
that 14
is 14
in 14
idea 14
the 14
condition 14
of 14
all 14
his 14
voluntary 14
actions 14
but 14
to 14
explain 14
how 14
pure 14
reason 14
can 14
be 14
of 14
itself 14
practical 14
without 14
the 14
aid 14
of 14
any 14
spring 14
of 14
action 14
that 14
could 14
be 14
derived 14
from 14
any 14
other 14
source 14
ie 14
how 14
the 14
mere 14
principle 14
of 14
the 14
universal 14
validity 14
of 14
all 14
its 14
maxims 14
as 14
laws 14
which 14
would 14
certainly 14
be 14
the 14
form 14
of 14
a 14
pure 14
practical 14
reason 14
can 14
of 14
itself 14
supply 14
a 14
spring 14
without 14
any 14
matter 14
object 14
of 14
the 14
will 14
in 14
which 14
one 14
could 14
antecedently 14
take 14
any 14
interest 14
and 14
how 14
it 14
can 14
produce 14
an 14
interest 14
which 14
would 14
be 14
called 14
purely 14
moral 14
or 14
in 14
other 14
words 14
how 14
pure 14
reason 14
can 14
be 14
practical 14
to 14
explain 14
this 14
is 14
beyond 14
the 14
power 14
of 14
human 14
reason 14
and 14
all 14
the 14
labour 14
and 14
pains 14
of 14
seeking 14
an 14
explanation 14
of 14
it 14
are 14
lost 14
it 14
is 14
just 14
the 14
same 14
as 14
if 14
i 14
sought 14
to 14
find 14
out 14
how 14
freedom 14
itself 14
is 14
possible 14
as 14
the 14
causality 14
of 14
a 14
will 14
for 14
then 14
i 14
quit 14
the 14
ground 14
of 14
philosophical 14
explanation 14
and 14
i 14
have 14
no 14
other 14
to 14
go 14
upon 14
i 14
might 14
indeed 14
revel 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
intelligences 14
which 14
still 14
remains 14
to 14
me 14
but 14
although 14
i 14
have 14
an 14
idea 14
of 14
it 14
which 14
is 14
well 14
founded 14
yet 14
i 14
have 14
not 14
the 14
least 14
knowledge 14
of 14
it 14
nor 14
an 14
i 14
ever 14
attain 14
to 14
such 14
knowledge 14
with 14
all 14
the 14
efforts 14
of 14
my 14
natural 14
faculty 14
of 14
reason 14
it 14
signifies 14
only 14
a 14
something 14
that 14
remains 14
over 14
when 14
i 14
have 14
eliminated 14
everything 14
belonging 14
to 14
the 14

taken 14

the 14
field 14
of 14
sensibility 14
fixing 14
its 14
limits 14

that 14
it 14
does 14
not 14

something 14
more 14

know 14
no 14
further 14
of 14
pure 14
reason 14
which 14
frames 14
this 14
ideal 14
there 14
remains 14
after 14
the 14
abstraction 14
of 14
all 14
matter 14
ie 14
knowledge 14
of 14
objects 14
nothing 14
but 14
the 14
form 14
namely 14
the 14
practical 14
law 14
of 14
the 14
universality 14
of 14
the 14
maxims 14
and 14
in 14
conformity 14
with 14
this 14
conception 14
of 14
reason 14
in 14
reference 14
to 14
a 14
pure 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
as 14
a 14
possible 14
efficient 14
cause 14
that 14
is 14
a 14
cause 14
determining 14
the 14
will 14
there 14
must 14
here 14
be 14
a 14
total 14
absence 14
of 14
springs 14
unless 14
this 14
idea 14
of 14
an 14
intelligible 14
world 14
is 14
itself 14
the 14
spring 14
or 14
that 14
in 14
which 14
reason 14
primarily 14
takes 14
an 14
interest 14
but 14
to 14
make 14
this 14
intelligible 14
is 14
precisely 14
the 14
problem 14
that 14
we 14
cannot 14
solve 14
here 14
now 14
is 14
the 14
extreme 14
limit 14
of 14
all 14
moral 14
inquiry 14
and 14
it 14
is 14
of 14
great 14
importance 14
to 14
determine 14
it 14
even 14
on 14
this 14
account 14
in 14
order 14
that 14
reason 14
may 14
not 14
on 14
the 14
one 14
band 14
to 14
the 14
prejudice 14
of 14
morals 14
seek 14
about 14
in 14
the 14
world 14
of 14
sense 14
for 14
the 14
supreme 14
motive 14
and 14
an 14
interest 14
comprehensible 14
but 14
empirical 14
and 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
hand 14
that 14
it 14
may 14
not 14
impotently 14
flap 14
its 14
wings 14
without 14
being 14
able 14
to 14
move 14
in 14
the 14
for 14
it 14
empty 14
space 14
of 14
transcendent 14
concepts 14
which 14
we 14
call 14
the 14
intelligible 14
world 14
and 14
so 14
lose 14
itself 14
amidst 14
chimeras 14
for 14
the 14
rest 14
the 14
idea 14
of 14
a 14
pure 14
world 14
of 14
understanding 14
as 14
a 14
system 14
of 14
all 14
intelligences 14
and 14
to 14
which 14
we 14
ourselves 14
as 14
rational 14
beings 14
belong 14
although 14
we 14
are 14
likewise 14
on 14
the 14
other 14
side 14
members 14
of 14
the 14
sensible 14
world 14
this 14
remains 14
always 14
a 14
useful 14
and 14
legitimate 14
idea 14
for 14
the 14
purposes 14
of 14
rational 14
belief 14
although 14
all 14
knowledge 14
stops 14
at 14
its 14
threshold 14
useful 14
namely 14
to 14
produce 14
in 14
us 14
a 14
lively 14
interest 14
in 14
the 14

to 14
which 14
we 14
can 14
belong 14
as 14
members 14
then 14
only 14
when 14
we 14
carefully 14
conduct 14
ourselves 14
according 14
to 14
the 14
maxims 14
of 14
freedom 14
as 14
if 14
they 14

the 14
speculative 14
employment 14
of 14
reason 14
with 14
respect 14
to 14

leads 14
to 14
the 14
absolute 14
necessity 14
of 14
some 14
supreme 14
cause 14
of 14

practical 14
employment 14
of 14
reason 14
with 14
a 14
view 14
to 14
freedom 14
leads 14
also 14
to 14
absolute 14
necessity 14
but 14
only 14
of 14
the 14
laws 14
of 14
the 14
actions 14
of 14
a 14
rational 14
being 14
as 14
such 14
now 14
it 14
is 14
an 14
essential 14
principle 14
of 14
reason 14
however 14
employed 14
to 14
push 14
its 14
knowledge 14
to 14
a 14
consciousness 14
of 14
its 14
necessity 14
without 14
which 14
it 14
would 14
not 14
be 14
rational 14
knowledge 14
it 14
is 14
however 14
an 14
equally 14
essential 14
restriction 14
of 14
the 14
same 14
reason 14
that 14
it 14
can 14
neither 14
discern 14
the 14
necessity 14
of 14
what 14
is 14
or 14
what 14
happens 14
nor 14
of 14
what 14
ought 14
to 14
happen 14
unless 14
a 14
condition 14
is 14
supposed 14
on 14
which 14
it 14
is 14
or 14
happens 14
or 14
ought 14
to 14
happen 14
in 14
this 14
way 14
however 14
by 14
the 14
constant 14
inquiry 14
for 14
the 14
condition 14
the 14
satisfaction 14
of 14
reason 14
is 14
only 14
further 14
and 14
further 14
postponed 14
hence 14
it 14
unceasingly 14
seeks 14
the 14
unconditionally 14
necessary 14
and 14
finds 14
itself 14
forced 14
to 14
assume 14
it 14
although 14
without 14
any 14
means 14
of 14
making 14
it 14
comprehensible 14
to 14
itself 14
happy 14
enough 14
if 14
only 14
it 14
can 14
discover 14
a 14
conception 14
which 14
agrees 14
with 14
this 14
assumption 14
it 14
is 14
therefore 14
no 14
fault 14
in 14
our 14
deduction 14
of 14
the 14
supreme 14
principle 14
of 14
morality 14
but 14
an 14
objection 14
that 14
should 14
be 14
made 14
to 14
human 14
reason 14
in 14
general 14
that 14
it 14
cannot 14
enable 14
us 14
to 14
conceive 14
the 14
absolute 14
necessity 14
of 14
an 14
unconditional 14
practical 14
law 14
such 14
as 14
the 14
categorical 14
imperative 14
must 14
be 14
it 14
cannot 14
be 14
blamed 14
for 14
refusing 14
to 14
explain 14
this 14
necessity 14
by 14
a 14
condition 14
that 14
is 14
to 14
say 14
by 14
means 14
of 14
some 14
interest 14
assumed 14
as 14
a 14
basis 14
since 14
the 14
law 14
would 14
then 14
cease 14
to 14
be 14
a 14
supreme 14
law 14
of 14
reason 14
and 14
thus 14
while 14
we 14
do 14
not 14
comprehend 14
the 14
practical 14
unconditional 14
necessity 14
of 14
the 14
moral 14
imperative 14
we 14
yet 14
comprehend 14
its 14
incomprehensibility 14
and 14
this 14
is 14
all 14
that 14
can 14
be 14
fairly 14
demanded 14

when 15

was 15
nearly 15
thirteen 15
my 15
brother 15
jem 15
got 15
his 15
arm 15
badly 15
broken 15
at 15
the 15
elbow 15
when 15
it 15
healed 15
and 15
jems 15
fears 15
of 15
never 15
being 15
able 15
to 15
play 15
football 15
were 15
assuaged 15
he 15
was 15
seldom 15
selfconscious 15
about 15
his 15
injury 15
his 15
left 15
arm 15
was 15
somewhat 15
shorter 15
than 15
his 15
right 15
when 15
he 15
stood 15
or 15
walked 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15
hand 15
was 15
at 15
right 15
angles 15
to 15
his 15
body 15
his 15
thumb 15
parallel 15
to 15
his 15
thigh 15
he 15
couldnt 15
have 15
cared 15
less 15
so 15
long 15
as 15
he 15
could 15
pass 15
and 15
punt 15
when 15
enough 15
years 15
had 15
gone 15
by 15
to 15
enable 15
us 15
to 15
look 15
back 15
on 15
them 15
we 15
sometimes 15
discussed 15
the 15
events 15
leading 15
to 15
his 15
accident 15
i 15
maintain 15
that 15
the 15
ewells 15
started 15
it 15
all 15
but 15
jem 15
who 15
was 15
four 15
years 15
my 15
senior 15
said 15
it 15
started 15
long 15
before 15
that 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
began 15
the 15
summer 15
dill 15
came 15
to 15
us 15
when 15
dill 15
first 15
gave 15
us 15
the 15
idea 15
of 15
making 15
boo 15
radley 15
come 15
out 15
i 15
said 15
if 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
take 15
a 15
broad 15
view 15
of 15
the 15
thing 15
it 15
really 15
began 15
with 15
andrew 15
jackson 15
if 15
general 15
jackson 15
hadnt 15
run 15
the 15
creeks 15
up 15
the 15
creek 15
simon 15
finch 15
would 15
never 15
have 15
paddled 15
up 15
the 15
alabama 15
and 15
where 15
would 15
we 15
be 15
if 15
he 15
hadnt 15
we 15
were 15
far 15
too 15
old 15
to 15
settle 15
an 15
argument 15
with 15
a 15
fistfight 15
so 15
we 15
consulted 15
atticus 15
our 15
father 15
said 15
we 15
were 15
both 15
right 15
being 15
southerners 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
source 15
of 15
shame 15
to 15
some 15
members 15
of 15
the 15
family 15
that 15
we 15
had 15
no 15
recorded 15
ancestors 15
on 15
either 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
battle 15
of 15
hastings 15
all 15
we 15
had 15
was 15
simon 15
finch 15
a 15
furtrapping 15
apothecary 15
from 15
cornwall 15
whose 15
piety 15
was 15
exceeded 15
only 15
by 15
his 15
stinginess 15
in 15
england 15
simon 15
was 15
irritated 15
by 15
the 15
persecution 15
of 15
those 15
who 15
called 15
themselves 15
methodists 15
at 15
the 15
hands 15
of 15
their 15
more 15
liberal 15
brethren 15
and 15
as 15
simon 15
called 15
himself 15
a 15
methodist 15
he 15
worked 15
his 15
way 15
across 15
the 15
atlantic 15
to 15
philadelphia 15
thence 15
to 15
jamaica 15
thence 15
to 15
mobile 15
and 15
up 15
the 15
saint 15
stephens 15
mindful 15
of 15
john 15
wesleys 15
strictures 15
on 15
the 15
use 15
of 15
many 15
words 15
in 15
buying 15
and 15
selling 15
simon 15
made 15
a 15
pile 15
practicing 15
medicine 15
but 15
in 15
this 15
pursuit 15
he 15
was 15
unhappy 15
lest 15
he 15
be 15
tempted 15
into 15
doing 15
what 15
he 15
knew 15
was 15
not 15
for 15
the 15
glory 15
of 15
god 15
as 15
the 15
putting 15
on 15
of 15
gold 15
and 15
costly 15
apparel 15
so 15
simon 15
having 15
forgotten 15
his 15
teachers 15
dictum 15
on 15
the 15
possession 15
of 15
human 15
chattels 15
bought 15
three 15
slaves 15
and 15
with 15
their 15
aid 15
established 15
a 15
homestead 15
on 15
the 15
banks 15
of 15
the 15
alabama 15
river 15
some 15
forty 15
miles 15
above 15
saint 15
stephens 15
he 15
returned 15
to 15
saint 15
stephens 15
only 15
once 15
to 15
find 15
a 15
wife 15
and 15
with 15
her 15
established 15
a 15
line 15
that 15
ran 15
high 15
to 15
daughters 15
simon 15
lived 15
to 15
an 15
impressive 15
age 15
and 15
died 15
rich 15
it 15
was 15
customary 15
for 15
the 15
men 15
in 15
the 15
family 15
to 15
remain 15
on 15
simons 15
homestead 15
finchs 15
landing 15
and 15
make 15
their 15
living 15
from 15
cotton 15
the 15
place 15
was 15
selfsufficient 15
modest 15
in 15
comparison 15
with 15
the 15
empires 15
around 15
it 15
the 15
landing 15
nevertheless 15
produced 15
everything 15
required 15
to 15
sustain 15
life 15
except 15
ice 15
wheat 15
flour 15
and 15
articles 15
of 15
clothing 15
supplied 15
by 15
riverboats 15
from 15
mobile 15
simon 15
would 15
have 15
regarded 15
with 15
impotent 15
fury 15
the 15
disturbance 15
between 15
the 15
north 15
and 15
the 15
south 15
as 15
it 15
left 15
his 15
descendants 15
stripped 15
of 15
everything 15
but 15
their 15
land 15
yet 15
the 15
tradition 15
of 15
living 15
on 15
the 15
land 15
remained 15
unbroken 15
until 15
well 15
into 15
the 15
twentieth 15
century 15
when 15
my 15
father 15
atticus 15
finch 15
went 15
to 15
montgomery 15
to 15
read 15
law 15
and 15
his 15
younger 15
brother 15
went 15
to 15
boston 15
to 15
study 15
medicine 15
their 15
sister 15
alexandra 15
was 15
the 15
finch 15
who 15
remained 15
at 15
the 15
landing 15
she 15
married 15
a 15
taciturn 15
man 15
who 15
spent 15
most 15
of 15
his 15
time 15
lying 15
in 15
a 15
hammock 15
by 15
the 15
river 15
wondering 15
if 15
his 15
trotlines 15
were 15
full 15
when 15
my 15
father 15
was 15
admitted 15
to 15
the 15
bar 15
he 15
returned 15
to 15
maycomb 15
and 15
began 15
his 15
practice 15
maycomb 15
some 15
twenty 15
miles 15
east 15
of 15
finchs 15
landing 15
was 15
the 15
county 15
seat 15
of 15
maycomb 15
county 15
atticuss 15
office 15
in 15
the 15
courthouse 15
contained 15
little 15
more 15
than 15
a 15
hat 15
rack 15
a 15
spittoon 15
a 15
checkerboard 15
and 15
an 15
unsullied 15
code 15
of 15
alabama 15
his 15
first 15
two 15
clients 15
were 15
the 15
last 15
two 15
persons 15
hanged 15
in 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
jail 15
atticus 15
had 15
urged 15
them 15
to 15
accept 15
the 15
states 15
generosity 15
in 15
allowing 15
them 15
to 15
plead 15
guilty 15
to 15
seconddegree 15
murder 15
and 15
escape 15
with 15
their 15
lives 15

they 15
were 15

a 15
name 15
synonymous 15
with 15
jackass 15
the 15
haverfords 15
had 15
dispatched 15
maycombs 15
leading 15
blacksmith 15
in 15
a 15
misunderstanding 15
arising 15
from 15
the 15
alleged 15
wrongful 15
detention 15
of 15
a 15
mare 15
were 15
imprudent 15
enough 15
to 15
do 15
it 15
in 15
the 15
presence 15
of 15
three 15
witnesses 15
and 15
insisted 15
that 15
thesonofabitchhaditcomingtohim 15
was 15
a 15
good 15
enough 15
defense 15
for 15
anybody 15
they 15
persisted 15
in 15
pleading 15
not 15
guilty 15
to 15
firstdegree 15
murder 15
so 15
there 15
was 15
nothing 15
much 15
atticus 15
could 15
do 15
for 15
his 15
clients 15
except 15
be 15
present 15
at 15
their 15
departure 15
an 15
occasion 15
that 15
was 15
probably 15
the 15
beginning 15
of 15
my 15
fathers 15
profound 15
distaste 15
for 15
the 15
practice 15
of 15
criminal 15
law 15
during 15
his 15
first 15
five 15
years 15
in 15
maycomb 15
atticus 15
practiced 15
economy 15
more 15
than 15
anything 15
for 15
several 15
years 15
thereafter 15
he 15
invested 15
his 15
earnings 15
in 15
his 15
brothers 15
education 15
john 15
hale 15
finch 15
was 15
ten 15
years 15
younger 15
than 15
my 15
father 15
and 15
chose 15
to 15
study 15
medicine 15
at 15
a 15
time 15
when 15
cotton 15
was 15
not 15
worth 15
growing 15
but 15
after 15
getting 15
uncle 15
jack 15
started 15
atticus 15
derived 15
a 15
reasonable 15
income 15
from 15
the 15
law 15
he 15
liked 15
maycomb 15
he 15
was 15
maycomb 15
county 15
born 15
and 15
bred 15
he 15
knew 15
his 15
people 15
they 15
knew 15
him 15
and 15
because 15
of 15
simon 15
finchs 15
industry 15
atticus 15
was 15
related 15
by 15
blood 15
or 15
marriage 15
to 15
nearly 15
every 15
family 15
in 15
the 15
town 15
maycomb 15
was 15
an 15
old 15
town 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
tired 15
old 15
town 15
when 15
i 15
first 15
knew 15
it 15
in 15
rainy 15
weather 15
the 15
streets 15
turned 15
to 15
red 15
slop 15
grass 15
grew 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalks 15
the 15
courthouse 15
sagged 15
in 15
the 15
square 15
somehow 15
it 15
was 15
hotter 15
then 15
a 15
black 15
dog 15
suffered 15
on 15
a 15
summers 15
day 15
bony 15
mules 15
hitched 15
to 15
hoover 15
carts 15
flicked 15
flies 15
in 15
the 15
sweltering 15
shade 15
of 15
the 15
live 15
oaks 15
on 15
the 15
square 15
mens 15

wilted 15
by 15
nine 15
in 15
the 15
morning 15
ladies 15
bathed 15
before 15
noon 15
after 15
their 15
threeoclock 15
naps 15
and 15
by 15
nightfall 15
were 15
like 15
soft 15
teacakes 15
with 15
frostings 15
of 15
sweat 15
and 15
sweet 15
talcum 15
people 15
moved 15
slowly 15
then 15
they 15
ambled 15
across 15
the 15
square 15
shuffled 15
in 15
and 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
stores 15
around 15
it 15
took 15
their 15
time 15
about 15
everything 15
a 15
day 15
was 15
twentyfour 15
hours 15
long 15
but 15
seemed 15
longer 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
hurry 15
for 15
there 15
was 15
nowhere 15
to 15
go 15
nothing 15
to 15
buy 15
and 15
no 15
money 15
to 15
buy 15
it 15
with 15
nothing 15
to 15
see 15
outside 15
the 15
boundaries 15
of 15
maycomb 15
county 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
time 15
of 15
vague 15
optimism 15
for 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
people 15
maycomb 15
county 15
had 15
recently 15
been 15
told 15
that 15
it 15
had 15
nothing 15
to 15
fear 15
but 15
fear 15
itself 15
we 15
lived 15
on 15
the 15
main 15
residential 15
street 15
in 15
town 15
atticus 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
plus 15
calpurnia 15
our 15
cook 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
found 15
our 15
father 15
satisfactory 15
he 15
played 15
with 15
us 15
read 15
to 15
us 15
and 15
treated 15
us 15
with 15
courteous 15
detachment 15
calpurnia 15
was 15
something 15
else 15
again 15
she 15
was 15
all 15
angles 15
and 15
bones 15
she 15
was 15
nearsighted 15
she 15
squinted 15
her 15
hand 15
was 15
wide 15
as 15
a 15
bed 15
slat 15
and 15
twice 15
as 15
hard 15
she 15
was 15
always 15
ordering 15
me 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
kitchen 15
asking 15
me 15
why 15
i 15
couldnt 15
behave 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
jem 15
when 15
she 15
knew 15
he 15
was 15
older 15
and 15
calling 15
me 15
home 15
when 15
i 15
wasnt 15
ready 15
to 15
come 15
our 15
battles 15
were 15
epic 15
and 15
onesided 15
calpurnia 15
always 15
won 15
mainly 15
because 15
atticus 15
always 15
took 15
her 15
side 15
she 15
had 15
been 15
with 15
us 15
ever 15
since 15
jem 15
was 15
born 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
felt 15
her 15
tyrannical 15
presence 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
remember 15
our 15
mother 15
died 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
two 15
so 15
i 15
never 15
felt 15
her 15
absence 15
she 15
was 15
a 15
graham 15
from 15
montgomery 15
atticus 15
met 15
her 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
first 15
elected 15
to 15
the 15
state 15
legislature 15
he 15
was 15
middleaged 15
then 15
she 15
was 15
fifteen 15
years 15
his 15
junior 15
jem 15
was 15
the 15
product 15
of 15
their 15
first 15
year 15
of 15
marriage 15
four 15
years 15
later 15

and 15
two 15
years 15
later 15
our 15
mother 15

from 15
a 15
sudden 15
heart 15

in 15
her 15
family 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
miss 15
her 15
but 15
i 15
think 15
jem 15
did 15
he 15
remembered 15
her 15
clearly 15
and 15
sometimes 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
a 15
game 15
he 15
would 15
sigh 15
at 15
length 15
then 15
go 15
off 15
and 15
play 15
by 15
himself 15
behind 15
the 15
carhouse 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
like 15
that 15
i 15
knew 15
better 15
than 15
to 15
bother 15
him 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
almost 15
six 15
and 15

inhabited 15
by 15
an 15
unknown 15
entity 15
the 15
mere 15
description 15
of 15
whom 15
was 15
enough 15
to 15
make 15
us 15
behave 15
for 15
days 15

cowlick 15
in 15
the 15
center 15
of 15
his 15
forehead 15
when 15
dill 15
reduced 15
dracula 15
to 15
dust 15
and 15
jem 15
said 15
the 15
show 15
sounded 15
better 15
than 15
the 15
book 15
i 15
asked 15
dill 15
where 15
his 15
father 15
was 15
you 15
aint 15
said 15
anything 15

dill 15
blushed 15
and 15
jem 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
hush 15
a 15
sure 15
sign 15
that 15
dill 15
had 15
been 15
studied 15
and 15
found 15
acceptable 15
thereafter 15
the 15
summer 15
passed 15
in 15
routine 15
contentment 15
routine 15
contentment 15
was 15
improving 15
our 15
treehouse 15
that 15
rested 15
between 15
giant 15
twin 15
chinaberry 15
trees 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
fussing 15
running 15
through 15
our 15
list 15
of 15
dramas 15
based 15
on 15
the 15
works 15
of 15
oliver 15
optic 15
victor 15
appleton 15
and 15
edgar 15
rice 15
burroughs 15
in 15
this 15
matter 15
we 15
were 15
lucky 15
to 15
have 15
dill 15
he 15
played 15
the 15
character 15
parts 15
formerly 15
thrust 15
upon 15
me 15
the 15
ape 15

rover 15
boys 15
mr 15
damon 15
in 15
tom 15
swift 15
thus 15
we 15
came 15
to 15
know 15
dill 15
as 15
a 15
pocket 15
merlin 15
whose 15
head 15
teemed 15
with 15
eccentric 15
plans 15
strange 15
longings 15
and 15
quaint 15
fancies 15
but 15
by 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
august 15
our 15
repertoire 15
was 15
vapid 15
from 15
countless 15
reproductions 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
then 15
that 15
dill 15
gave 15
us 15
the 15
idea 15
of 15
making 15
boo 15
radley 15
come 15
out 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
fascinated 15
dill 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
our 15
warnings 15
and 15
explanations 15
it 15
drew 15
him 15
as 15
the 15
moon 15
draws 15
water 15
but 15
drew 15
him 15
no 15
nearer 15
than 15
the 15
lightpole 15
on 15
the 15
corner 15
a 15
safe 15
distance 15
from 15
the 15
radley 15
gate 15
there 15
he 15
would 15
stand 15
his 15
arm 15
around 15
the 15
fat 15
pole 15
staring 15
and 15
wondering 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
jutted 15
into 15
a 15
sharp 15
curve 15
beyond 15
our 15
house 15
walking 15
south 15
one 15
faced 15
its 15
porch 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
turned 15
and 15
ran 15
beside 15
the 15
lot 15
the 15
house 15
was 15
low 15
was 15
once 15
white 15
with 15
a 15
deep 15
front 15
porch 15
and 15
green 15
shutters 15
but 15
had 15
long 15
ago 15
darkened 15
to 15
the 15
color 15
of 15
the 15
slategray 15
yard 15
around 15
it 15
rainrotted 15
shingles 15
drooped 15
over 15
the 15
eaves 15
of 15
the 15
veranda 15
oak 15
trees 15
kept 15
the 15
sun 15
away 15
the 15
remains 15
of 15
a 15
picket 15
drunkenly 15
guarded 15
the 15
front 15
yard 15
a 15
swept 15
yard 15
that 15
was 15
never 15
swept 15
where 15
johnson 15
grass 15
and 15
rabbittobacco 15
grew 15
in 15
abundance 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
lived 15
a 15
malevolent 15
phantom 15
people 15
said 15
he 15
existed 15
but 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
him 15
people 15
said 15
he 15
went 15
out 15
at 15
night 15
when 15
the 15
moon 15
was 15
down 15
and 15
peeped 15
in 15
windows 15
when 15
peoples 15
azaleas 15
froze 15
in 15
a 15
cold 15
snap 15
it 15
was 15
because 15
he 15
had 15
breathed 15
on 15
them 15
any 15
stealthy 15
small 15
crimes 15
committed 15
in 15
maycomb 15
were 15
his 15
work 15
once 15
the 15
town 15
was 15
terrorized 15
by 15
a 15
series 15
of 15
morbid 15
nocturnal 15
events 15
peoples 15
chickens 15
and 15
household 15
pets 15
were 15
found 15
mutilated 15
although 15
the 15
culprit 15
was 15
crazy 15
addie 15
who 15
eventually 15
drowned 15
himself 15
in 15
barkers 15
eddy 15
people 15
still 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
unwilling 15
to 15
discard 15
their 15
initial 15
suspicions 15
a 15
negro 15
would 15
not 15
pass 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
at 15
night 15
he 15
would 15
cut 15
across 15
to 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
opposite 15
and 15
whistle 15
as 15
he 15
walked 15
the 15
maycomb 15
school 15
grounds 15
adjoined 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
lot 15
from 15
the 15
radley 15
chickenyard 15
tall 15
pecan 15
trees 15
shook 15
their 15
fruit 15
into 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
but 15
the 15
nuts 15
lay 15
untouched 15
by 15
the 15
children 15
radley 15
pecans 15
would 15
kill 15
you 15
a 15
baseball 15
hit 15
into 15
the 15
radley 15
yard 15
was 15
a 15
lost 15
ball 15
and 15
no 15
questions 15
asked 15
the 15
misery 15
of 15
that 15
house 15
began 15
many 15
years 15
before 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
born 15
the 15
radleys 15
welcome 15
anywhere 15
in 15
town 15
kept 15
to 15
themselves 15
a 15
predilection 15
unforgivable 15
in 15
maycomb 15
they 15
did 15
not 15
go 15
to 15
church 15
maycombs 15
principal 15
recreation 15
but 15
worshiped 15
at 15
home 15
mrs 15
radley 15
seldom 15
if 15
ever 15
crossed 15
the 15
street 15
for 15
a 15
midmorning 15
coffee 15
break 15
with 15
her 15
neighbors 15
and 15
certainly 15
never 15
joined 15
a 15
missionary 15
circle 15
mr 15
radley 15
walked 15
to 15
town 15
at 15
eleventhirty 15
every 15
morning 15
and 15
came 15
back 15
promptly 15
at 15
twelve 15
sometimes 15
carrying 15
a 15
brown 15
paper 15
bag 15
that 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
assumed 15
contained 15
the 15
family 15
groceries 15
i 15
never 15
knew 15
how 15
old 15
mr 15
radley 15
made 15
his 15
living 15
jem 15
said 15
he 15
bought 15
cotton 15
a 15
polite 15
term 15
for 15
doing 15
nothing 15
but 15
mr 15
radley 15
and 15
his 15
wife 15
had 15
lived 15
there 15
with 15
their 15
two 15
sons 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
anybody 15
could 15
remember 15
the 15
shutters 15
and 15
doors 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
were 15
closed 15
on 15
sundays 15
another 15
thing 15
alien 15
to 15
maycombs 15
ways 15
closed 15
doors 15
meant 15
illness 15
and 15
cold 15
weather 15
only 15
of 15
all 15
days 15
sunday 15

shoes 15
but 15
to 15
climb 15
the 15
radley 15
front 15
steps 15
and 15
call 15
hey 15
of 15
a 15
sunday 15
afternoon 15
was 15
something 15
their 15
neighbors 15
never 15
did 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
had 15
no 15
screen 15
doors 15
i 15
once 15
asked 15
atticus 15
if 15
it 15
ever 15
had 15
any 15
atticus 15
said 15
yes 15
but 15
before 15
i 15
was 15
born 15
according 15
to 15
neighborhood 15
legend 15
when 15
the 15
younger 15
radley 15
boy 15
was 15
in 15
his 15
teens 15
he 15
became 15
acquainted 15
with 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
from 15
old 15
sarum 15
an 15
enormous 15
and 15
confusing 15
tribe 15
domiciled 15
in 15
the 15
northern 15
part 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
and 15
they 15
formed 15
the 15
nearest 15
thing 15
to 15
a 15
gang 15
ever 15
seen 15
in 15
maycomb 15
they 15
did 15
little 15
but 15
enough 15
to 15
be 15
discussed 15
by 15
the 15
town 15
and 15
publicly 15
warned 15
from 15
three 15
pulpits 15
they 15
hung 15
around 15
the 15
barbershop 15
they 15
rode 15
the 15
bus 15
to 15
abbottsville 15
on 15
sundays 15
and 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
picture 15
show 15
they 15
attended 15
dances 15
at 15
the 15
countys 15
riverside 15
gambling 15
hell 15
the 15
dewdrop 15
inn 15
fishing 15
camp 15
they 15
experimented 15
with 15
stumphole 15
whiskey 15
nobody 15
in 15
maycomb 15
had 15
nerve 15
enough 15
to 15
tell 15
mr 15
radley 15
that 15
his 15
boy 15
was 15
in 15
with 15
the 15
wrong 15
crowd 15
one 15
night 15
in 15
an 15
excessive 15
spurt 15
of 15
high 15
spirits 15
the 15
boys 15
backed 15
around 15
the 15
square 15
in 15
a 15
borrowed 15
flivver 15
resisted 15
arrest 15
by 15
maycombs 15
ancient 15
beadle 15
mr 15
conner 15
and 15
locked 15
him 15
in 15
the 15
courthouse 15
outhouse 15
the 15
town 15
decided 15
something 15
had 15
to 15
be 15
done 15
mr 15
conner 15
said 15
he 15
knew 15
who 15
each 15
and 15
every 15
one 15
of 15
them 15
was 15
and 15
he 15
was 15
bound 15
and 15
determined 15
they 15
wouldnt 15
get 15
away 15
with 15
it 15
so 15
the 15
boys 15
came 15
before 15
the 15
probate 15
judge 15
on 15
charges 15
of 15
disorderly 15
conduct 15
disturbing 15
the 15
peace 15
assault 15
and 15
battery 15
and 15
using 15
abusive 15
and 15
profane 15
language 15
in 15
the 15
presence 15
and 15
hearing 15
of 15
a 15
female 15
the 15
judge 15
asked 15
mr 15
conner 15
why 15
he 15
included 15
the 15
last 15
charge 15
mr 15
conner 15
said 15
they 15
cussed 15
so 15
loud 15
he 15
was 15
sure 15
every 15
lady 15
in 15
maycomb 15
heard 15
them 15
the 15
judge 15
decided 15
to 15
send 15
the 15
boys 15
to 15
the 15
state 15
industrial 15
school 15
where 15
boys 15
were 15
sometimes 15
sent 15
for 15
no 15
other 15
reason 15
than 15
to 15
provide 15
them 15
with 15
food 15
and 15
decent 15
shelter 15
it 15
was 15
no 15
prison 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
no 15
disgrace 15
mr 15
radley 15
thought 15
it 15
was 15
if 15
the 15
judge 15
released 15
arthur 15
mr 15
radley 15
would 15
see 15
to 15
it 15
that 15
arthur 15
gave 15
no 15
further 15
trouble 15
knowing 15
that 15
mr 15
radleys 15
word 15
was 15
his 15
bond 15
the 15
judge 15
was 15
glad 15
to 15
do 15
so 15
the 15
other 15
boys 15
attended 15
the 15
industrial 15
school 15
and 15
received 15
the 15
best 15
secondary 15
education 15
to 15
be 15
had 15
in 15
the 15
state 15
one 15
of 15
them 15
eventually 15
worked 15
his 15
way 15
through 15
engineering 15
school 15
at 15
auburn 15
the 15
doors 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
were 15
closed 15
on 15
weekdays 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
sundays 15
and 15
mr 15
radleys 15
boy 15
was 15
not 15
seen 15
again 15
for 15
fifteen 15
years 15
but 15
there 15
came 15
a 15
day 15
barely 15
within 15
jems 15
memory 15
when 15
boo 15
radley 15
was 15
heard 15
from 15
and 15
was 15
seen 15
by 15
several 15

said 15
atticus 15
never 15
talked 15
much 15
about 15
the 15
radleys 15
when 15
jem 15
would 15
question 15
him 15
atticuss 15
only 15
answer 15
was 15
for 15
him 15
to 15
mind 15
his 15
own 15
business 15
and 15
let 15
the 15
radleys 15
mind 15
theirs 15
they 15
had 15
a 15
right 15
to 15
but 15
when 15
it 15
happened 15
jem 15
said 15
atticus 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
and 15
said 15
mm 15
mm 15
mm 15
so 15
jem 15
received 15
most 15
of 15
his 15
information 15
from 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
a 15
neighborhood 15
scold 15

whole 15
thing 15
according 15
to 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
boo 15

sitting 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
cutting 15
some 15
items 15
from 15
the 15
maycomb 15
tribune 15
to 15
paste 15
in 15
his 15
scrapbook 15
his 15
father 15
entered 15
the 15
room 15
as 15
mr 15
radley 15
passed 15
by 15
boo 15
drove 15
the 15
scissors 15
into 15
his 15

pulled 15
them 15
out 15
wiped 15
them 15
on 15
his 15
pants 15
and 15
resumed 15
his 15
activities 15
mrs 15
radley 15
ran 15
screaming 15
into 15
the 15
street 15
that 15
arthur 15
was 15
killing 15
them 15
all 15
but 15
when 15
the 15
sheriff 15
arrived 15
he 15
found 15
boo 15
still 15
sitting 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
cutting 15
up 15
the 15
tribune 15
he 15
was 15
thirtythree 15
years 15
old 15
then 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
said 15
old 15
mr 15
radley 15
said 15
no 15
radley 15
was 15
going 15
to 15
any 15
asylum 15
when 15
it 15
was 15
suggested 15
that 15
a 15
season 15
in 15
tuscaloosa 15
might 15
be 15
helpful 15
to 15
boo 15
boo 15
wasnt 15
crazy 15
he 15
was 15
highstrung 15
at 15
times 15
it 15
was 15
all 15
right 15
to 15
shut 15
him 15
up 15
mr 15
radley 15
conceded 15
but 15
insisted 15
that 15
boo 15
not 15
be 15
charged 15
with 15
anything 15
he 15
was 15
not 15
a 15
criminal 15
the 15
sheriff 15
hadnt 15
the 15
heart 15
to 15
put 15
him 15
in 15
jail 15
alongside 15
negroes 15
so 15
boo 15
was 15
locked 15
in 15
the 15
courthouse 15
basement 15
boos 15
transition 15
from 15
the 15
basement 15
to 15
back 15
home 15
was 15
nebulous 15
in 15
jems 15
memory 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
said 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
town 15
council 15
told 15
mr 15
radley 15
that 15
if 15
he 15
didnt 15
take 15
boo 15
back 15
boo 15
would 15
die 15
of 15
mold 15
from 15
the 15
damp 15
besides 15
boo 15
could 15
not 15
live 15
forever 15
on 15
the 15
bounty 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
nobody 15
knew 15
what 15
form 15
of 15
intimidation 15
mr 15
radley 15
employed 15
to 15
keep 15
boo 15
out 15
of 15
sight 15
but 15
jem 15
figured 15
that 15
mr 15
radley 15
kept 15
him 15
chained 15
to 15
the 15
bed 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
time 15
atticus 15
said 15
no 15
it 15
wasnt 15
that 15
sort 15
of 15
thing 15
that 15
there 15
were 15
other 15
ways 15
of 15
making 15
people 15
into 15
ghosts 15
my 15
memory 15
came 15
alive 15
to 15
see 15
mrs 15
radley 15
occasionally 15
open 15
the 15
front 15
door 15
walk 15
to 15
the 15
edge 15
of 15
the 15
porch 15
and 15
pour 15
water 15
on 15
her 15
cannas 15
but 15
every 15
day 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
would 15
see 15
mr 15
radley 15
walking 15
to 15
and 15
from 15
town 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
thin 15
leathery 15
man 15
with 15
colorless 15
eyes 15
so 15
colorless 15
they 15
did 15
not 15
reflect 15
light 15
his 15
cheekbones 15
were 15
sharp 15
and 15
his 15
mouth 15
was 15
wide 15
with 15
a 15
thin 15
upper 15
lip 15
and 15
a 15
full 15
lower 15
lip 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
said 15
he 15
was 15
so 15
upright 15
he 15
took 15
the 15
word 15
of 15
god 15
as 15
his 15
only 15
law 15
and 15
we 15
believed 15
her 15
because 15
mr 15
radleys 15
posture 15
was 15
ramrod 15
straight 15
he 15
never 15
spoke 15
to 15
us 15
when 15
he 15
passed 15
we 15
would 15
look 15
at 15
the 15
ground 15
and 15
say 15
good 15
morning 15
sir 15
and 15
he 15
would 15
cough 15
in 15
reply 15
mr 15
radleys 15
elder 15
son 15
lived 15
in 15
pensacola 15
he 15
came 15
home 15
at 15
christmas 15
and 15
he 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
few 15
persons 15
we 15
ever 15
saw 15
enter 15
or 15
leave 15
the 15
place 15
from 15
the 15
day 15
mr 15
radley 15
took 15
arthur 15
home 15
people 15
said 15
the 15
house 15
died 15
but 15
there 15
came 15
a 15
day 15
when 15
atticus 15
told 15
us 15
hed 15
wear 15
us 15
out 15
if 15
we 15
made 15
any 15
noise 15
in 15
the 15
yard 15
and 15
commissioned 15
calpurnia 15
to 15
serve 15
in 15
his 15
absence 15
if 15
she 15
heard 15
a 15
sound 15
out 15
of 15
us 15
mr 15
radley 15
was 15
dying 15
he 15
took 15
his 15
time 15
about 15
it 15
wooden 15
sawhorses 15
blocked 15
the 15
road 15
at 15
each 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
lot 15
straw 15
was 15
put 15
down 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
traffic 15
was 15
diverted 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
street 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
parked 15
his 15
car 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
our 15
house 15
and 15
walked 15
to 15
the 15
radleys 15
every 15
time 15
he 15
called 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
crept 15
around 15
the 15
yard 15
for 15
days 15
at 15
last 15
the 15
sawhorses 15
were 15
taken 15
away 15
and 15
we 15
stood 15
watching 15
from 15
the 15
front 15
porch 15
when 15
mr 15
radley 15
made 15
his 15
final 15
journey 15
past 15
our 15
house 15
there 15
goes 15
the 15
meanest 15
man 15
ever 15
god 15
blew 15
breath 15
into 15
murmured 15
calpurnia 15
and 15
she 15
spat 15
meditatively 15
into 15
the 15
yard 15
we 15
looked 15
at 15
her 15
in 15
surprise 15
for 15
calpurnia 15
rarely 15
commented 15
on 15
the 15
ways 15
of 15
white 15
people 15
the 15

to 15
the 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
lot 15
then 15
back 15
again 15
studying 15
the 15
simple 15
terrain 15
as 15
if 15
deciding 15
how 15
best 15
to 15
effect 15
an 15
entry 15
frowning 15
and 15
scratching 15
his 15
head 15

i 15
sneered 15
at 15
him 15
jem 15
threw 15

the 15
gate 15
and 15
sped 15
to 15
the 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
slapped 15
it 15
with 15
his 15
palm 15
and 15
ran 15
back 15
past 15
us 15
not 15
waiting 15
to 15
see 15
if 15
his 15
foray 15
was 15
successful 15
dill 15
and 15
i 15
followed 15
on 15
his 15
heels 15
safely 15
on 15
our 15
porch 15
panting 15
and 15
out 15
of 15
breath 15
we 15
looked 15
back 15
the 15
old 15
house 15
was 15
the 15
same 15
droopy 15
and 15
sick 15
but 15
as 15
we 15
stared 15
down 15
the 15
street 15
we 15
thought 15
we 15
saw 15
an 15
inside 15
shutter 15
move 15
flick 15
a 15
tiny 15
almost 15
invisible 15
movement 15
and 15
the 15
house 15
was 15
still 15
dill 15
left 15
us 15
early 15
in 15
september 15
to 15
return 15
to 15
meridian 15
we 15
saw 15
him 15
off 15
on 15
the 15
five 15
oclock 15
bus 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
miserable 15
without 15
him 15
until 15
it 15
occurred 15
to 15
me 15
that 15
i 15
would 15
be 15
starting 15
to 15
school 15
in 15
a 15
week 15
i 15
never 15
looked 15
forward 15
more 15
to 15
anything 15
in 15
my 15
life 15
hours 15
of 15
wintertime 15
had 15
found 15
me 15
in 15
the 15
treehouse 15
looking 15
over 15
at 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
spying 15
on 15
multitudes 15
of 15
children 15
through 15
a 15
twopower 15
telescope 15
jem 15
had 15
given 15
me 15
learning 15
their 15
games 15
following 15
jems 15
red 15
jacket 15
through 15
wriggling 15
circles 15
of 15
blind 15
mans 15
buff 15
secretly 15
sharing 15
their 15
misfortunes 15
and 15
minor 15
victories 15
i 15
longed 15
to 15
join 15
them 15
jem 15
condescended 15
to 15
take 15
me 15
to 15
school 15
the 15
first 15
day 15
a 15
job 15
usually 15
done 15
by 15
ones 15
parents 15
but 15
atticus 15
had 15
said 15
jem 15
would 15
be 15
delighted 15
to 15
show 15
me 15
where 15
my 15
room 15
was 15
i 15
think 15
some 15
money 15
changed 15
hands 15
in 15
this 15
transaction 15
for 15
as 15
we 15
trotted 15
around 15
the 15
corner 15
past 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
i 15
heard 15
an 15
unfamiliar 15
jingle 15
in 15
jems 15
pockets 15
when 15
we 15
slowed 15
to 15
a 15
walk 15
at 15
the 15
edge 15
of 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
jem 15
was 15
careful 15
to 15
explain 15
that 15
during 15
school 15
hours 15
i 15
was 15
not 15
to 15
bother 15
him 15
i 15
was 15
not 15
to 15
approach 15
him 15
with 15
requests 15
to 15
enact 15
a 15
chapter 15
of 15
tarzan 15
and 15
the 15
ant 15
men 15
to 15
embarrass 15
him 15
with 15
references 15
to 15
his 15
private 15
life 15
or 15
tag 15
along 15
behind 15
him 15
at 15
recess 15
and 15
noon 15
i 15
was 15
to 15
stick 15
with 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
and 15
he 15
would 15
stick 15
with 15
the 15
fifth 15
in 15
short 15
i 15
was 15
to 15
leave 15
him 15
alone 15
you 15

me 15
up 15
to 15
the 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
and 15
patted 15
the 15
palm 15
of 15
my 15
hand 15
with 15
a 15
ruler 15
then 15

highheeled 15
pumps 15
and 15
a 15
redandwhitestriped 15
dress 15
she 15
looked 15
and 15

like 15
a 15
peppermint 15
drop 15
she 15
boarded 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
one 15

down 15
from 15

alabama 15
from 15
winston 15
county 15
the 15
class 15
murmured 15
apprehensively 15
should 15
she 15
prove 15
to 15
harbor 15
her 15
share 15
of 15
the 15
peculiarities 15
indigenous 15
to 15
that 15
region 15
when 15
alabama 15

of 15
no 15
background 15
miss 15
caroline 15
began 15
the 15
day 15
by 15
reading 15
us 15
a 15
story 15
about 15
cats 15
the 15
cats 15
had 15
long 15
conversations 15
with 15
one 15
another 15
they 15
wore 15
cunning 15
little 15
clothes 15
and 15
lived 15
in 15
a 15
warm 15
house 15
beneath 15
a 15
kitchen 15
stove 15
by 15
the 15
time 15
mrs 15
cat 15
called 15
the 15
drugstore 15
for 15
an 15
order 15
of 15
chocolate 15
malted 15
mice 15
the 15
class 15
was 15
wriggling 15
like 15
a 15
bucketful 15
of 15
catawba 15
worms 15
miss 15
caroline 15
seemed 15
unaware 15
that 15
the 15
ragged 15
denimshirted 15
and 15
floursackskirted 15
first 15

most 15
of 15

chopped 15
cotton 15
and 15
fed 15
hogs 15
from 15
the 15
time 15
they 15
were 15
able 15
to 15
walk 15
were 15
immune 15
to 15
imaginative 15
literature 15
miss 15
caroline 15
came 15
to 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
story 15
and 15
said 15
oh 15

that 15
nice 15
then 15
she 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
blackboard 15
and 15
printed 15
the 15
alphabet 15
in 15
enormous 15
square 15
capitals 15
turned 15
to 15
the 15
class 15
and 15
asked 15
does 15
anybody 15
know 15
what 15
these 15
are 15
everybody 15
did 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
had 15
failed 15
it 15
last 15
year 15
i 15
suppose 15
she 15
chose 15
me 15
because 15
she 15
knew 15
my 15
name 15
as 15
i 15
read 15
the 15
alphabet 15
a 15
faint 15
line 15
appeared 15
between 15
her 15
eyebrows 15
and 15
after 15
making 15
me 15
read 15
most 15
of 15
my 15
first 15
reader 15
and 15
the 15
stockmarket 15
quotations 15
from 15
the 15
mobile 15
register 15
aloud 15
she 15
discovered 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
literate 15
and 15
looked 15
at 15
me 15
with 15
more 15
than 15
faint 15
distaste 15
miss 15
caroline 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
tell 15
my 15
father 15
not 15
to 15
teach 15
me 15

interfere 15
with 15
my 15
reading 15

i 15
said 15
in 15

added 15
when 15
miss 15
caroline 15
smiled 15
and 15
shook 15
her 15
head 15
why 15
hes 15
so 15
tired 15
at 15
night 15
he 15
just 15
sits 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
and 15
reads 15
if 15
he 15
didnt 15
teach 15
you 15
who 15
did 15
miss 15
caroline 15
asked 15
goodnaturedly 15
somebody 15
did 15
you 15
werent 15
born 15
reading 15
the 15
mobile 15
register 15
jem 15
says 15
i 15
was 15
he 15
read 15
in 15
a 15
book 15
where 15
i 15
was 15
a 15
bullfinch 15
instead 15
of 15
a 15
finch 15
jem 15
says 15
my 15
names 15
really 15
jean 15
louise 15
bullfinch 15
that 15
i 15
got 15
swapped 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
born 15
and 15
im 15
really 15
a 15
miss 15
caroline 15
apparently 15
thought 15
i 15
was 15
lying 15
lets 15
not 15
let 15
our 15
imaginations 15
run 15
away 15
with 15
us 15
dear 15
she 15
said 15
now 15
you 15
tell 15
your 15
father 15
not 15
to 15
teach 15
you 15
any 15
more 15
its 15
best 15
to 15
begin 15
reading 15
with 15
a 15
fresh 15
mind 15
you 15
tell 15
him 15
ill 15
take 15
over 15
from 15
here 15
and 15
try 15
to 15
undo 15
the 15
damage 15
maam 15
your 15
father 15
does 15
not 15
know 15
how 15
to 15
teach 15
you 15
can 15
have 15
a 15
seat 15
now 15
i 15
mumbled 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
sorry 15
and 15
retired 15
meditating 15
upon 15
my 15
crime 15
i 15
never 15
deliberately 15
learned 15
to 15
read 15
but 15
somehow 15
i 15
had 15
been 15
wallowing 15
illicitly 15
in 15
the 15
daily 15
papers 15
in 15
the 15
long 15
hours 15
of 15
church 15
was 15
it 15
then 15
i 15
learned 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
remember 15
not 15
being 15
able 15
to 15
read 15
hymns 15
now 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
compelled 15
to 15
think 15
about 15
it 15
reading 15
was 15
something 15
that 15
just 15
came 15
to 15
me 15
as 15
learning 15
to 15
fasten 15
the 15
seat 15
of 15
my 15
union 15
suit 15
without 15
looking 15
around 15
or 15
achieving 15
two 15
bows 15
from 15
a 15
snarl 15
of 15
shoelaces 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
remember 15
when 15
the 15
lines 15
above 15
atticuss 15
moving 15
finger 15
separated 15
into 15
words 15
but 15
i 15
had 15
stared 15
at 15
them 15
all 15
the 15
evenings 15
in 15
my 15
memory 15
listening 15
to 15
the 15
news 15
of 15
the 15
day 15
bills 15
to 15
be 15
enacted 15
into 15
laws 15
the 15
diaries 15
of 15
lorenzo 15
dow 15
anything 15
atticus 15
happened 15
to 15
be 15
reading 15
when 15
i 15
crawled 15
into 15
his 15
lap 15
every 15
night 15
until 15
i 15
feared 15
i 15
would 15
lose 15
it 15
i 15
never 15
loved 15
to 15
read 15
one 15
does 15
not 15
love 15
breathing 15
i 15
knew 15
i 15
had 15
annoyed 15
miss 15
caroline 15
so 15
i 15
let 15
well 15
enough 15
alone 15
and 15
stared 15
out 15
the 15
window 15
until 15
recess 15
when 15
jem 15
cut 15
me 15
from 15
the 15
covey 15
of 15
firstgraders 15
in 15
the 15

part 15
of 15
life 15
in 15
maycomb 15
county 15
i 15
contented 15
myself 15
with 15
asking 15

the 15
first 15
grade 15
stubborn 15
its 15
the 15
dewey 15
decimal 15
system 15
having 15
never 15
questioned 15
jems 15
pronouncements 15
i 15
saw 15
no 15
reason 15
to 15
begin 15
now 15
the 15
dewey 15
decimal 15
system 15
consisted 15
in 15
part 15
of 15
miss 15
caroline 15
waving 15
cards 15
at 15
us 15
on 15
which 15
were 15
printed 15
the 15
cat 15
rat 15
man 15
and 15
you 15
no 15
comment 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
expected 15
of 15
us 15
and 15
the 15
class 15
received 15
these 15
impressionistic 15
revelations 15
in 15
silence 15
i 15
was 15
bored 15
so 15
i 15
began 15
a 15
letter 15
to 15
dill 15
miss 15
caroline 15
caught 15
me 15
writing 15
and 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
tell 15
my 15
father 15
to 15
stop 15
teaching 15
me 15
besides 15
she 15
said 15
we 15
dont 15
write 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
we 15
print 15
you 15
wont 15
learn 15
to 15
write 15
until 15
youre 15
in 15
the 15
third 15
grade 15
calpurnia 15
was 15
to 15
blame 15
for 15
this 15
it 15
kept 15
me 15
from 15
driving 15
her 15
crazy 15
on 15
rainy 15
days 15
i 15
guess 15
she 15
would 15
set 15
me 15
a 15
writing 15
task 15
by 15
scrawling 15
the 15
alphabet 15
firmly 15
across 15
the 15
top 15
of 15
a 15
tablet 15
then 15
copying 15
out 15
a 15
chapter 15
of 15
the 15
bible 15
beneath 15
if 15
i 15
reproduced 15
her 15
penmanship 15
satisfactorily 15
she 15
rewarded 15
me 15
with 15
an 15
openfaced 15
sandwich 15
of 15
bread 15
and 15
butter 15
and 15
sugar 15
in 15
calpurnias 15
teaching 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
sentimentality 15
i 15
seldom 15
pleased 15
her 15
and 15
she 15
seldom 15
rewarded 15
me 15
everybody 15
who 15
goes 15
home 15
to 15
lunch 15
hold 15
up 15
your 15
hands 15
said 15
miss 15
caroline 15
breaking 15
into 15
my 15
new 15
grudge 15
against 15
calpurnia 15
the 15
town 15
children 15
did 15
so 15
and 15
she 15
looked 15
us 15
over 15
everybody 15
who 15
brings 15
his 15
lunch 15
put 15
it 15
on 15
top 15
of 15
his 15
desk 15
molasses 15
buckets 15
appeared 15
from 15
nowhere 15
and 15
the 15
ceiling 15
danced 15
with 15
metallic 15
light 15
miss 15
caroline 15
walked 15
up 15
and 15
down 15
the 15
rows 15
peering 15
and 15
poking 15
into 15
lunch 15
containers 15
nodding 15
if 15
the 15
contents 15
pleased 15
her 15
frowning 15
a 15
little 15
at 15
others 15
she 15
stopped 15
at 15
walter 15
cunninghams 15
desk 15
wheres 15
yours 15
she 15
asked 15
walter 15
cunninghams 15

everybody 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
he 15
had 15
hookworms 15
his 15
absence 15
of 15
shoes 15
told 15
us 15
how 15
he 15
got 15
them 15
people 15
caught 15
hookworms 15
going 15
barefooted 15
in 15
barnyards 15
and 15
hog 15
wallows 15
if 15
walter 15
had 15
owned 15
any 15
shoes 15
he 15
would 15
have 15
worn 15
them 15
the 15
first 15
day 15
of 15
school 15
and 15
then 15
discarded 15
them 15
until 15
midwinter 15
he 15
did 15
have 15
on 15
a 15
clean 15
shirt 15
and 15
neatly 15
mended 15
overalls 15

straight 15
ahead 15
i 15
saw 15
a 15
muscle 15
jump 15
in 15
his 15
skinny 15
jaw 15
did 15
you 15
forget 15
it 15
this 15
morning 15
asked 15
miss 15
caroline 15
walters 15
jaw 15
twitched 15
again 15
yebm 15
he 15
finally 15
mumbled 15
miss 15
caroline 15
went 15
to 15
her 15
desk 15
and 15
opened 15
her 15
purse 15
heres 15
a 15
quarter 15
she 15
said 15
to 15

and 15
eat 15
downtown 15

his 15
head 15
nome 15

he 15
drawled 15
softly 15
impatience 15

into 15
miss 15
carolines 15
voice 15
here 15
walter 15
come 15

it 15
walter 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
again 15
when 15
walter 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
a 15
third 15
time 15
someone 15
whispered 15
go 15
on 15
and 15
tell 15
her 15
scout 15
i 15
turned 15
around 15
and 15
saw 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
town 15
people 15
and 15
the 15
entire 15
bus 15
delegation 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
miss 15
caroline 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
conferred 15
twice 15
already 15
and 15
they 15
were 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
in 15
the 15
innocent 15
assurance 15
that 15
familiarity 15
breeds 15
understanding 15
i 15
rose 15
graciously 15
on 15
walters 15
behalf 15
ah 15

sat 15
back 15
down 15
what 15
jean 15
louise 15
i 15
thought 15
i 15
had 15
made 15
things 15
sufficiently 15
clear 15
it 15
was 15
clear 15
enough 15
to 15
the 15

time 15

while 15

much 15
but 15
they 15
get 15
along 15
on 15
it 15
my 15
special 15
knowledge 15
of 15
the 15
cunningham 15
tribe 15
one 15
branch 15
that 15
is 15
was 15
gained 15
from 15
events 15
of 15
last 15
winter 15
walters 15
father 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
atticuss 15
clients 15
after 15
a 15
dreary 15
conversation 15
in 15
our 15
livingroom 15
one 15
night 15
about 15
his 15
entailment 15
before 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
left 15
he 15
said 15
mr 15
finch 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
when 15
ill 15
ever 15
be 15
able 15
to 15
pay 15
you 15
let 15
that 15
be 15
the 15
least 15
of 15
your 15
worries 15
walter 15
atticus 15
said 15
when 15
i 15
asked 15
jem 15
what 15
entailment 15
was 15
and 15
jem 15
described 15
it 15
as 15
a 15
condition 15
of 15
having 15
your 15
tail 15
in 15
a 15
crack 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
if 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
would 15
ever 15
pay 15
us 15
not 15
in 15
money 15
atticus 15
said 15
but 15
before 15
the 15
years 15
out 15
ill 15
have 15
been 15
paid 15
you 15
watch 15
we 15
watched 15
one 15
morning 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
found 15
a 15
load 15
of 15
stovewood 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
later 15
a 15
sack 15
of 15
hickory 15
nuts 15
appeared 15
on 15
the 15
back 15
steps 15
with 15
christmas 15
came 15
a 15
crate 15
of 15
smilax 15
and 15
holly 15
that 15
spring 15
when 15
we 15
found 15
a 15
crokersack 15
full 15
of 15
turnip 15
greens 15
atticus 15
said 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
had 15
more 15
than 15
paid 15
him 15
why 15
does 15
he 15
pay 15
you 15
like 15
that 15
i 15
asked 15
because 15
thats 15
the 15
only 15
way 15
he 15
can 15
pay 15
me 15
he 15
has 15
no 15
money 15
are 15
we 15
poor 15
atticus 15
atticus 15
nodded 15
we 15
are 15
indeed 15
jems 15
nose 15
wrinkled 15
are 15
we 15
as 15
poor 15
as 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
not 15
exactly 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
are 15
country 15
folks 15
farmers 15
and 15
the 15
crash 15
hit 15
them 15
hardest 15
atticus 15
said 15
professional 15
people 15
were 15
poor 15
because 15
the 15
farmers 15
were 15
poor 15
as 15
maycomb 15
county 15
was 15
farm 15
country 15
nickels 15
and 15
dimes 15
were 15
hard 15
to 15
come 15
by 15
for 15
doctors 15
and 15
dentists 15
and 15
lawyers 15
entailment 15
was 15
only 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
mr 15
cunninghams 15
vexations 15
the 15
acres 15
not 15
entailed 15
were 15
mortgaged 15
to 15
the 15
hilt 15
and 15
the 15
little 15
cash 15
he 15
made 15
went 15
to 15
interest 15
if 15
he 15
held 15
his 15
mouth 15
right 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
could 15
get 15
a 15
wpa 15
job 15
but 15
his 15
land 15
would 15
go 15
to 15
ruin 15
if 15
he 15
left 15
it 15
and 15
he 15
was 15
willing 15
to 15
go 15
hungry 15
to 15
keep 15
his 15
land 15
and 15
vote 15
as 15
he 15
pleased 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
said 15
atticus 15
came 15
from 15
a 15
set 15
breed 15
of 15
men 15
as 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
had 15
no 15
money 15
to 15
pay 15
a 15
lawyer 15
they 15
simply 15
paid 15
us 15
with 15
what 15
they 15
had 15
did 15
you 15
know 15
said 15
atticus 15
that 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
works 15
the 15
same 15
way 15
he 15
charges 15
some 15
folks 15
a 15
bushel 15
of 15
potatoes 15
for 15
delivery 15
of 15
a 15
baby 15
miss 15
scout 15
if 15
you 15
give 15
me 15
your 15
attention 15
ill 15
tell 15
you 15
what 15
entailment 15
is 15
jems 15
definitions 15
are 15
very 15
nearly 15
accurate 15
sometimes 15
if 15
i 15
could 15
have 15
explained 15
these 15
things 15
to 15
miss 15
caroline 15
i 15
would 15
have 15
saved 15
myself 15
some 15
inconvenience 15
and 15
miss 15
caroline 15
subsequent 15
mortification 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
beyond 15
my 15
ability 15
to 15
explain 15
things 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
atticus 15
so 15
i 15
said 15
youre 15
shamin 15
him 15
miss 15
caroline 15
walter 15
hasnt 15
got 15
a 15
quarter 15
at 15
home 15
to 15
bring 15
you 15
and 15
you 15
cant 15
use 15
any 15
stovewood 15
miss 15
caroline 15
stood 15
stock 15
still 15
then 15
grabbed 15
me 15
by 15
the 15
collar 15
and 15
hauled 15
me 15
back 15
to 15
her 15
desk 15
jean 15
louise 15
ive 15
had 15
about 15
enough 15
of 15
you 15
this 15
morning 15
she 15
said 15
youre 15
starting 15
off 15
on 15
the 15
wrong 15
foot 15
in 15
every 15
way 15
my 15
dear 15
hold 15
out 15
your 15
hand 15
i 15
thought 15
she 15
was 15
going 15
to 15
spit 15
in 15
it 15
which 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
reason 15
anybody 15
in 15
maycomb 15
held 15
out 15
his 15
hand 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
timehonored 15
method 15
of 15
sealing 15
oral 15
contracts 15
wondering 15
what 15
bargain 15
we 15
had 15
made 15
i 15
turned 15
to 15
the 15
class 15
for 15
an 15
answer 15
but 15
the 15
class 15
looked 15
back 15
at 15
me 15
in 15
puzzlement 15
miss 15
caroline 15
picked 15
up 15
her 15
ruler 15
gave 15
me 15
half 15
a 15
dozen 15
quick 15
little 15
pats 15
then 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
stand 15
in 15
the 15
corner 15
a 15
storm 15
of 15
laughter 15
broke 15
loose 15
when 15
it 15
finally 15
occurred 15
to 15
the 15
class 15
that 15
miss 15
caroline 15
had 15
whipped 15
me 15
when 15
miss 15
caroline 15
threatened 15
it 15
with 15
a 15
similar 15
fate 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
exploded 15
again 15
becoming 15
cold 15
sober 15
only 15
when 15
the 15
shadow 15
of 15
miss 15
blount 15
fell 15
over 15
them 15
miss 15
blount 15
a 15
native 15
maycombian 15
as 15
yet 15
uninitiated 15
in 15
the 15
mysteries 15
of 15
the 15
decimal 15
system 15
appeared 15
at 15
the 15
door 15
hands 15
on 15
hips 15
and 15
announced 15
if 15
i 15
hear 15
another 15
sound 15
from 15
this 15
room 15
ill 15
burn 15
up 15
everybody 15
in 15
it 15
miss 15
caroline 15
the 15
sixth 15
grade 15
cannot 15
concentrate 15
on 15
the 15
pyramids 15
for 15
all 15
this 15
racket 15
my 15
sojourn 15
in 15
the 15
corner 15
was 15
a 15
short 15
one 15
saved 15
by 15
the 15
bell 15
miss 15
caroline 15
watched 15
the 15
class 15
file 15
out 15
for 15
lunch 15
as 15
i 15
was 15
the 15
last 15
to 15
leave 15
i 15
saw 15
her 15
sink 15
down 15
into 15
her 15
chair 15
and 15
bury 15
her 15
head 15
in 15
her 15
arms 15
had 15
her 15
conduct 15
been 15
more 15
friendly 15
toward 15
me 15
i 15
would 15
have 15
felt 15
sorry 15
for 15
her 15
she 15
was 15
a 15
pretty 15
little 15
thing 15
catching 15
walter 15
cunningham 15
in 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
gave 15
me 15
some 15
pleasure 15
but 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
rubbing 15
his 15
nose 15
in 15
the 15
dirt 15
jem 15
came 15
by 15
and 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
stop 15
youre 15
biggern 15
he 15
is 15
he 15
said 15
hes 15
as 15
old 15
as 15
you 15
nearly 15
i 15
said 15
he 15
made 15
me 15
start 15
off 15
on 15
the 15
wrong 15
foot 15
let 15
him 15
go 15
scout 15
why 15
he 15
didnt 15
have 15
any 15
lunch 15
i 15
said 15
and 15
explained 15
my 15
involvement 15
in 15
walters 15
dietary 15
affairs 15
walter 15
had 15
picked 15
himself 15
up 15
and 15
was 15
standing 15
quietly 15
listening 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
his 15
fists 15
were 15
half 15
cocked 15
as 15
if 15
expecting 15
an 15
onslaught 15
from 15
both 15
of 15
us 15
i 15
stomped 15
at 15
him 15
to 15
chase 15
him 15
away 15
but 15
jem 15
put 15
out 15
his 15
hand 15
and 15
stopped 15
me 15
he 15
examined 15
walter 15
with 15
an 15
air 15
of 15
speculation 15
your 15
daddy 15
mr 15
walter 15
cunningham 15
from 15
old 15
sarum 15
he 15
asked 15
and 15
walter 15
nodded 15
walter 15
looked 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
raised 15
on 15
fish 15
food 15
his 15
eyes 15
as 15
blue 15
as 15
dill 15
harriss 15
were 15
redrimmed 15
and 15
watery 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
color 15
in 15
his 15
face 15
except 15
at 15
the 15
tip 15
of 15
his 15
nose 15
which 15
was 15
moistly 15
pink 15
he 15
fingered 15
the 15
straps 15
of 15
his 15
overalls 15
nervously 15
picking 15
at 15
the 15
metal 15
hooks 15
jem 15
suddenly 15
grinned 15
at 15
him 15
come 15
on 15
home 15
to 15
dinner 15
with 15
us 15
walter 15

said 15
wed 15
be 15
glad 15
to 15
have 15
you 15
walters 15
face 15
brightened 15
then 15
darkened 15
jem 15
said 15

dispensation 15
of 15
my 15
pledge 15
irked 15
me 15
but 15
precious 15
noontime 15

where 15
he 15
was 15
biting 15
his 15
lip 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
gave 15
up 15
and 15
we 15
were 15

extra 15
plate 15
we 15
had 15
company 15

greeted 15
walter 15
and 15

a 15
discussion 15
about 15
crops 15
neither 15
jem 15
nor 15
i 15

asked 15
but 15
atticus 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
at 15
me 15
while 15
walter 15
piled 15
food 15
on 15
his 15
plate 15
he 15
and 15
atticus 15
talked 15
together 15
like 15
two 15
men 15
to 15
the 15
wonderment 15
of 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
atticus 15
was 15
expounding 15
upon 15
farm 15
problems 15
when 15
walter 15
interrupted 15
to 15
ask 15
if 15
there 15
was 15
any 15
molasses 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
atticus 15
summoned 15
calpurnia 15
who 15
returned 15
bearing 15
the 15
syrup 15
pitcher 15
she 15
stood 15
waiting 15
for 15
walter 15
to 15
help 15
himself 15
walter 15
poured 15
syrup 15
on 15
his 15
vegetables 15
and 15
meat 15
with 15
a 15
generous 15
hand 15
he 15
would 15
probably 15
have 15
poured 15
it 15
into 15
his 15
milk 15
glass 15
had 15
i 15
not 15
asked 15
what 15
the 15
sam 15
hill 15
he 15
was 15
doing 15
the 15
silver 15
saucer 15
clattered 15
when 15
he 15
replaced 15
the 15
pitcher 15
and 15
he 15
quickly 15
put 15
his 15
hands 15
in 15
his 15
lap 15
then 15
he 15
ducked 15
his 15
head 15
atticus 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
at 15
me 15
again 15
but 15
hes 15
gone 15
and 15
drowned 15
his 15
dinner 15
in 15
syrup 15
i 15
protested 15
hes 15
poured 15
it 15
all 15
over 15
it 15
was 15
then 15
that 15
calpurnia 15
requested 15
my 15
presence 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
she 15
was 15
furious 15
and 15
when 15
she 15
was 15
furious 15
calpurnias 15
grammar 15
became 15
erratic 15
when 15
in 15
tranquility 15
her 15
grammar 15
was 15
as 15
good 15
as 15
anybodys 15
in 15
maycomb 15
atticus 15
said 15
calpurnia 15
had 15
more 15
education 15
than 15
most 15
colored 15
folks 15
when 15
she 15
squinted 15
down 15
at 15
me 15
the 15
tiny 15
lines 15
around 15
her 15
eyes 15
deepened 15

me 15
through 15
the 15
swinging 15
door 15
to 15
the 15
diningroom 15
with 15
a 15
stinging 15
smack 15
i 15
retrieved 15
my 15
plate 15
and 15
finished 15
dinner 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
thankful 15
though 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
spared 15
the 15
humiliation 15
of 15
facing 15
them 15
again 15
i 15
told 15
calpurnia 15
to 15
just 15
wait 15
id 15
fix 15
her 15
one 15
of 15
these 15
days 15
when 15
she 15
wasnt 15
looking 15
id 15
go 15
off 15
and 15
drown 15
myself 15
in 15
barkers 15
eddy 15
and 15
then 15
shed 15
be 15
sorry 15
besides 15
i 15
added 15
shed 15
already 15
gotten 15
me 15
in 15
trouble 15
once 15
today 15
she 15
had 15
taught 15
me 15
to 15
write 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
all 15
her 15
fault 15

fussin 15
she 15
said 15
jem 15
and 15
walter 15
returned 15
to 15
school 15
ahead 15
of 15
me 15
staying 15
behind 15
to 15
advise 15
atticus 15
of 15
calpurnias 15
iniquities 15
was 15
worth 15
a 15
solitary 15
sprint 15
past 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
she 15
likes 15
jem 15
bettern 15
she 15
likes 15
me 15
anyway 15
i 15
concluded 15
and 15
suggested 15
that 15
atticus 15
lose 15
no 15
time 15
in 15
packing 15
her 15
off 15
have 15
you 15
ever 15
considered 15
that 15
jem 15
doesnt 15
worry 15
her 15
half 15
as 15
much 15
atticuss 15
voice 15
was 15
flinty 15
ive 15
no 15
intention 15
of 15
getting 15
rid 15
of 15
her 15
now 15
or 15
ever 15
we 15
couldnt 15
operate 15
a 15
single 15
day 15
without 15
cal 15
have 15
you 15
ever 15
thought 15
of 15
that 15
you 15
think 15
about 15
how 15
much 15
cal 15
does 15
for 15
you 15
and 15
you 15
mind 15
her 15
you 15
hear 15
i 15
returned 15
to 15
school 15
and 15
hated 15
calpurnia 15
steadily 15
until 15
a 15
sudden 15
shriek 15
shattered 15
my 15
resentments 15
i 15
looked 15
up 15
to 15

horror 15
flooding 15
her 15
face 15
apparently 15
she 15
had 15
revived 15
enough 15
to 15
persevere 15
in 15
her 15
profession 15
its 15
alive 15
she 15
screamed 15
the 15
male 15

black 15
deep 15
into 15

at 15

clean 15
space 15
on 15

because 15
miss 15
caroline 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
entertained 15
the 15
class 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
morning 15
and 15
burris 15

a 15
short 15
contemptuous 15
snort 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
elderly 15

made 15
a 15
serious 15

he 15
was 15
among 15
the 15
most 15
diminutive 15
of 15
men 15
but 15
when 15
burris 15

to 15
be 15
afraid 15
of 15
a 15
child 15
half 15
his 15
height 15
and 15
miss 15
caroline 15

the 15
boy 15
snorted 15
and 15
slouched 15
leisurely 15
to 15
the 15
door 15
safely 15
out 15
of 15
range 15
he 15
turned 15
and 15
shouted 15

and 15
be 15
damned 15
to 15

he 15
waited 15
until 15
he 15
was 15
sure 15
she 15
was 15
crying 15
then 15
he 15
shuffled 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
building 15
soon 15
we 15
were 15
clustered 15
around 15
her 15
desk 15
trying 15
in 15
our 15
various 15
ways 15
to 15
comfort 15
her 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
real 15
mean 15
one 15
below 15
the 15
belt 15
you 15

us 15
a 15
story 15
that 15
cat 15
thing 15
was 15
real 15
fine 15
this 15
mornin 15
miss 15
caroline 15
smiled 15
blew 15
her 15
nose 15
said 15
thank 15
you 15
darlings 15
dispersed 15
us 15
opened 15
a 15
book 15
and 15
mystified 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
with 15
a 15
long 15
narrative 15
about 15
a 15
toadfrog 15
that 15
lived 15
in 15
a 15
hall 15
when 15
i 15
passed 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
for 15
the 15
fourth 15
time 15
that 15
day 15
twice 15
at 15
a 15
full 15
gallop 15
my 15
gloom 15
had 15
deepened 15
to 15
match 15
the 15
house 15
if 15
the 15
remainder 15
of 15
the 15
school 15
year 15
were 15
as 15
fraught 15
with 15
drama 15
as 15
the 15
first 15
day 15
perhaps 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
mildly 15
entertaining 15
but 15
the 15
prospect 15
of 15
spending 15
nine 15
months 15
refraining 15
from 15
reading 15
and 15
writing 15
made 15
me 15
think 15
of 15
running 15
away 15
by 15
late 15
afternoon 15
most 15
of 15
my 15
traveling 15
plans 15
were 15
complete 15
when 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
raced 15
each 15
other 15
up 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
to 15
meet 15
atticus 15
coming 15
home 15
from 15
work 15
i 15
didnt 15
give 15
him 15
much 15
of 15
a 15
race 15
it 15
was 15
our 15
habit 15
to 15
run 15
meet 15
atticus 15
the 15
moment 15
we 15
saw 15
him 15
round 15
the 15
post 15
office 15
corner 15
in 15
the 15
distance 15
atticus 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
forgotten 15
my 15
noontime 15
fall 15
from 15
grace 15
he 15
was 15
full 15
of 15
questions 15
about 15
school 15
my 15
replies 15
were 15
monosyllabic 15
and 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
press 15
me 15
perhaps 15
calpurnia 15
sensed 15
that 15
my 15
day 15
had 15
been 15
a 15
grim 15
one 15
she 15
let 15
me 15
watch 15
her 15
fix 15
supper 15
shut 15
your 15
eyes 15
and 15
open 15
your 15
mouth 15
and 15
ill 15
give 15
you 15
a 15
surprise 15
she 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
often 15
that 15
she 15
made 15
crackling 15
bread 15
she 15
said 15
she 15
never 15
had 15
time 15
but 15
with 15
both 15
of 15
us 15
at 15
school 15
today 15
had 15
been 15
an 15
easy 15
one 15
for 15
her 15
she 15
knew 15
i 15
loved 15
crackling 15
bread 15
i 15
missed 15
you 15
today 15
she 15
said 15
the 15
house 15
got 15
so 15
lonesome 15
long 15
about 15
two 15
oclock 15
i 15
had 15
to 15
turn 15
on 15
the 15
radio 15
why 15
jemn 15
me 15
aint 15
ever 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
unless 15
its 15
rainin 15
i 15
know 15
she 15
said 15
but 15
one 15
of 15
yous 15
always 15
in 15
callin 15
distance 15
i 15
wonder 15
how 15
much 15
of 15
the 15
day 15
i 15
spend 15
just 15
callin 15
after 15
you 15
well 15
she 15
said 15
getting 15
up 15
from 15
the 15
kitchen 15
chair 15
its 15
enough 15
time 15
to 15
make 15
a 15
pan 15
of 15
cracklin 15
bread 15
i 15
reckon 15
you 15
run 15
along 15
now 15
and 15
let 15
me 15
get 15
supper 15
on 15
the 15
table 15
calpurnia 15
bent 15
down 15
and 15
kissed 15
me 15
i 15
ran 15
along 15
wondering 15
what 15
had 15
come 15
over 15
her 15
she 15
had 15
wanted 15
to 15
make 15
up 15
with 15
me 15
that 15
was 15
it 15
she 15
had 15
always 15
been 15
too 15
hard 15
on 15
me 15
she 15
had 15
at 15
last 15
seen 15
the 15
error 15
of 15
her 15
fractious 15
ways 15
she 15
was 15
sorry 15
and 15
too 15
stubborn 15
to 15
say 15
so 15
i 15
was 15
weary 15
from 15
the 15
days 15
crimes 15
after 15
supper 15
atticus 15
sat 15
down 15
with 15
the 15
paper 15
and 15
called 15
scout 15
ready 15
to 15
read 15
the 15
lord 15
sent 15
me 15
more 15
than 15
i 15
could 15
bear 15
and 15
i 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
front 15
porch 15
atticus 15
followed 15
me 15
something 15
wrong 15
scout 15
i 15
told 15
atticus 15
i 15
didnt 15
feel 15
very 15
well 15
and 15
didnt 15
think 15
id 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
any 15
more 15
if 15
it 15
was 15
all 15
right 15
with 15
him 15
atticus 15
sat 15
down 15
in 15
the 15
swing 15
and 15
crossed 15
his 15
legs 15
his 15
fingers 15
wandered 15
to 15
his 15
watchpocket 15
he 15
said 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
way 15
he 15
could 15
think 15
he 15
waited 15
in 15
amiable 15
silence 15
and 15
i 15
sought 15
to 15
reinforce 15
my 15
position 15
you 15
never 15
went 15
to 15

atticus 15
stood 15
up 15
and 15
walked 15
to 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
porch 15
when 15
he 15
completed 15
his 15
examination 15
of 15
the 15
wisteria 15
vine 15
he 15
strolled 15
back 15
to 15
me 15
first 15
of 15
all 15
he 15
said 15
if 15
you 15
can 15
learn 15
a 15
simple 15
trick 15
scout 15
youll 15
get 15
along 15
a 15
lot 15
better 15
with 15
all 15
kinds 15
of 15
folks 15
you 15
never 15
really 15
understand 15
a 15
person 15
until 15
you 15
consider 15
things 15
from 15
his 15
point 15
of 15
view 15
sir 15
until 15
you 15
climb 15
into 15
his 15
skin 15
and 15
walk 15
around 15
in 15
it 15
atticus 15
said 15
i 15
had 15
learned 15
many 15
things 15
today 15
and 15
miss 15
caroline 15
had 15
learned 15
several 15
things 15
herself 15
she 15
had 15
learned 15
not 15
to 15
hand 15
something 15
to 15
a 15
cunningham 15
for 15
one 15
thing 15
but 15
if 15
walter 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
put 15
ourselves 15
in 15
her 15
shoes 15
wed 15
have 15
seen 15
it 15
was 15
an 15
honest 15
mistake 15
on 15
her 15
part 15
we 15
could 15
not 15
expect 15
her 15
to 15
learn 15
all 15
maycombs 15
ways 15
in 15
one 15
day 15
and 15
we 15
could 15
not 15
hold 15
her 15
responsible 15
when 15
she 15
knew 15
no 15
better 15
ill 15
be 15
dogged 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
didnt 15
know 15
no 15
better 15
than 15
not 15
to 15
read 15
to 15
her 15
and 15
she 15
held 15
me 15
responsible 15
listen 15
atticus 15
i 15
dont 15
have 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
i 15
was 15
bursting 15
with 15
a 15
sudden 15
thought 15
burris 15
ewell 15
remember 15
he 15
just 15
goes 15
to 15
school 15
the 15
first 15
day 15
the 15
truant 15
lady 15
reckons 15
shes 15
carried 15
out 15
the 15
law 15
when 15
she 15
gets 15
his 15
name 15
on 15
the 15
roll 15
you 15
cant 15
do 15
that 15
scout 15
atticus 15
said 15
sometimes 15
its 15
better 15
to 15
bend 15
the 15
law 15
a 15
little 15
in 15
special 15
cases 15
in 15
your 15
case 15
the 15
law 15
remains 15
rigid 15
so 15
to 15
school 15
you 15
must 15
go 15
i 15
dont 15
see 15
why 15
i 15
have 15
to 15
when 15
he 15
doesnt 15
then 15
listen 15
atticus 15
said 15
the 15
ewells 15
had 15
been 15
the 15
disgrace 15
of 15
maycomb 15
for 15
three 15
generations 15
none 15
of 15
them 15
had 15
done 15
an 15
honest 15
days 15
work 15
in 15
his 15
recollection 15
he 15
said 15
that 15
some 15
christmas 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
getting 15
rid 15
of 15
the 15
tree 15
he 15
would 15
take 15
me 15
with 15
him 15
and 15
show 15
me 15
where 15
and 15
how 15
they 15
lived 15
they 15
were 15
people 15
but 15
they 15
lived 15
like 15
animals 15
they 15
can 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
any 15
time 15
they 15
want 15
to 15
when 15
they 15
show 15
the 15
faintest 15
symptom 15
of 15
wanting 15
an 15
education 15
said 15
atticus 15
there 15
are 15
ways 15
of 15
keeping 15
them 15
in 15
school 15
by 15
force 15
but 15
its 15
silly 15
to 15
force 15
people 15
like 15
the 15
ewells 15
into 15
a 15
new 15
environment 15
if 15
i 15
didnt 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
tomorrow 15
youd 15
force 15
me 15
to 15
let 15
us 15
leave 15
it 15
at 15
this 15
said 15
atticus 15
dryly 15
you 15
miss 15
scout 15
finch 15
are 15
of 15
the 15
common 15
folk 15
you 15
must 15
obey 15
the 15
law 15
he 15
said 15
that 15
the 15
ewells 15
were 15
members 15
of 15
an 15
exclusive 15
society 15
made 15
up 15
of 15
ewells 15
in 15
certain 15
circumstances 15
the 15
common 15
folk 15
judiciously 15
allowed 15
them 15
certain 15
privileges 15
by 15
the 15
simple 15
method 15
of 15
becoming 15
blind 15
to 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
ewells 15
activities 15
they 15
didnt 15
have 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
for 15
one 15
thing 15
another 15
thing 15
mr 15
bob 15
ewell 15
burriss 15
father 15
was 15
permitted 15
to 15
hunt 15
and 15
trap 15
out 15
of 15
season 15
atticus 15
thats 15
bad 15
i 15
said 15
in 15
maycomb 15
county 15
hunting 15
out 15
of 15
season 15
was 15
a 15
misdemeanor 15
at 15
law 15
a 15
capital 15
felony 15
in 15
the 15
eyes 15
of 15
the 15
populace 15
its 15
against 15
the 15
law 15
all 15
right 15
said 15
my 15
father 15
and 15
its 15
certainly 15
bad 15
but 15
when 15
a 15
man 15
spends 15
his 15
relief 15
checks 15
on 15
green 15
whiskey 15
his 15
children 15
have 15
a 15
way 15
of 15
crying 15
from 15
hunger 15
pains 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
of 15
any 15
landowner 15
around 15
here 15
who 15
begrudges 15
those 15
children 15
any 15
game 15
their 15
father 15
can 15
hit 15
mr 15
ewell 15
shouldnt 15
do 15
that 15
of 15
course 15
he 15
shouldnt 15
but 15
hell 15
never 15
change 15
his 15
ways 15
are 15
you 15
going 15
to 15
take 15
out 15
your 15
disapproval 15
on 15
his 15
children 15
no 15
sir 15
i 15
murmured 15
and 15
made 15
a 15
final 15
stand 15
but 15
if 15
i 15
keep 15
on 15
goin 15
to 15
school 15
we 15
cant 15
ever 15
read 15
any 15
more 15
thats 15
really 15
bothering 15
you 15
isnt 15
it 15
yes 15
sir 15
when 15
atticus 15
looked 15
down 15
at 15
me 15
i 15
saw 15
the 15
expression 15
on 15
his 15
face 15
that 15
always 15
made 15
me 15
expect 15
something 15
do 15
you 15
know 15
what 15
a 15
compromise 15
is 15
he 15
asked 15
bending 15
the 15
law 15
no 15
an 15
agreement 15
reached 15
by 15
mutual 15
concessions 15
it 15
works 15
this 15
way 15
he 15
said 15
if 15
youll 15
concede 15
the 15
necessity 15
of 15
going 15
to 15
school 15
well 15
go 15
on 15
reading 15
every 15
night 15
just 15
as 15
we 15
always 15
have 15
is 15
it 15
a 15
bargain 15
yes 15
sir 15
well 15
consider 15
it 15
sealed 15
without 15
the 15
usual 15
formality 15
atticus 15
said 15
when 15
he 15
saw 15
me 15
preparing 15
to 15
spit 15
as 15
i 15
opened 15
the 15
front 15
screen 15
door 15
atticus 15
said 15
by 15
the 15
way 15
scout 15
youd 15
better 15
not 15
say 15
anything 15
at 15
school 15
about 15
our 15
agreement 15
why 15
not 15
im 15
afraid 15
our 15
activities 15
would 15
be 15
received 15
with 15
considerable 15
disapprobation 15
by 15
the 15
more 15
learned 15
authorities 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
accustomed 15
to 15
our 15
fathers 15
lastwillandtestament 15
diction 15
and 15
we 15
were 15
at 15
all 15
times 15
free 15
to 15
interrupt 15
atticus 15
for 15
a 15
translation 15
when 15
it 15
was 15
beyond 15
our 15
understanding 15
huh 15
sir 15
i 15
never 15
went 15
to 15
school 15
he 15
said 15
but 15
i 15
have 15
a 15
feeling 15
that 15
if 15
you 15
tell 15
miss 15
caroline 15
we 15
read 15
every 15
night 15
shell 15
get 15
after 15
me 15
and 15
i 15
wouldnt 15
want 15
her 15
after 15
me 15
atticus 15
kept 15
us 15
in 15
fits 15
that 15
evening 15
gravely 15
reading 15
columns 15
of 15
print 15
about 15
a 15
man 15
who 15
sat 15
on 15
a 15
flagpole 15
for 15
no 15
discernible 15
reason 15
which 15
was 15
reason 15
enough 15
for 15
jem 15
to 15
spend 15
the 15
following 15
saturday 15
aloft 15
in 15
the 15
treehouse 15
jem 15
sat 15
from 15
after 15
breakfast 15
until 15
sunset 15
and 15
would 15
have 15
remained 15
overnight 15
had 15
not 15
atticus 15
severed 15
his 15
supply 15
lines 15
i 15
had 15
spent 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
day 15
climbing 15
up 15
and 15
down 15
running 15
errands 15
for 15
him 15
providing 15
him 15
with 15
literature 15
nourishment 15
and 15
water 15
and 15
was 15
carrying 15
him 15
blankets 15
for 15
the 15
night 15
when 15
atticus 15
said 15
if 15
i 15
paid 15
no 15
attention 15
to 15
him 15
jem 15
would 15
come 15
down 15
atticus 15
was 15
right 15
the 15
remainder 15
of 15
my 15
schooldays 15
were 15
no 15
more 15
auspicious 15
than 15
the 15
first 15
indeed 15
they 15
were 15
an 15
endless 15
project 15
that 15
slowly 15
evolved 15
into 15
a 15
unit 15
in 15
which 15
miles 15
of 15
construction 15
paper 15
and 15
wax 15
crayon 15
were 15
expended 15
by 15
the 15
state 15
of 15
alabama 15
in 15
its 15
wellmeaning 15
but 15
fruitless 15
efforts 15
to 15
teach 15
me 15
group 15
dynamics 15
what 15
jem 15
called 15
the 15
dewey 15
decimal 15
system 15
was 15
schoolwide 15
by 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
my 15
first 15
year 15
so 15
i 15
had 15
no 15
chance 15
to 15
compare 15
it 15
with 15
other 15
teaching 15
techniques 15
i 15
could 15
only 15
look 15
around 15
me 15
atticus 15
and 15
my 15
uncle 15
who 15
went 15
to 15
school 15
at 15
home 15
knew 15
everything 15
at 15
least 15
what 15
one 15
didnt 15
know 15
the 15
other 15
did 15
furthermore 15
i 15
couldnt 15
help 15
noticing 15
that 15
my 15
father 15
had 15
served 15
for 15
years 15
in 15
the 15
state 15
legislature 15
elected 15
each 15
time 15
without 15
opposition 15
innocent 15
of 15
the 15
adjustments 15
my 15
teachers 15
thought 15
essential 15
to 15
the 15
development 15
of 15
good 15
citizenship 15
jem 15
educated 15
on 15
a 15
halfdecimal 15
halfduncecap 15
basis 15
seemed 15
to 15
function 15
effectively 15
alone 15
or 15
in 15
a 15
group 15
but 15
jem 15
was 15
a 15
poor 15
example 15
no 15
tutorial 15
system 15
devised 15
by 15
man 15
could 15
have 15
stopped 15
him 15
from 15
getting 15
at 15
books 15
as 15
for 15
me 15
i 15
knew 15
nothing 15
except 15
what 15
i 15
gathered 15
from 15
time 15
magazine 15
and 15
reading 15
everything 15
i 15
could 15
lay 15
hands 15
on 15
at 15
home 15
but 15
as 15
i 15
inched 15
sluggishly 15
along 15
the 15
treadmill 15
of 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
school 15
system 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
help 15
receiving 15
the 15
impression 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
being 15
cheated 15
out 15
of 15
something 15
out 15
of 15
what 15
i 15
knew 15
not 15
yet 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
believe 15
that 15
twelve 15
years 15
of 15
unrelieved 15
boredom 15
was 15
exactly 15
what 15
the 15
state 15
had 15
in 15
mind 15
for 15
me 15
as 15
the 15
year 15
passed 15
released 15
from 15
school 15
thirty 15
minutes 15
before 15
jem 15
who 15
had 15
to 15
stay 15
until 15
three 15
oclock 15
i 15
ran 15
by 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
as 15
fast 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
stopping 15
until 15
i 15
reached 15
the 15
safety 15
of 15
our 15
front 15
porch 15
one 15
afternoon 15
as 15
i 15
raced 15
by 15
something 15
caught 15
my 15
eye 15
and 15
caught 15
it 15
in 15
such 15
a 15
way 15
that 15
i 15
took 15
a 15
deep 15
breath 15
a 15
long 15
look 15
around 15
and 15
went 15
back 15
two 15
live 15
oaks 15
stood 15
at 15
the 15
edge 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
lot 15
their 15
roots 15
reached 15
out 15
into 15
the 15
sideroad 15
and 15
made 15
it 15
bumpy 15
something 15
about 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
trees 15
attracted 15
my 15
attention 15
some 15
tinfoil 15
was 15
sticking 15
in 15
a 15
knothole 15
just 15
above 15
my 15
eye 15
level 15
winking 15
at 15
me 15
in 15
the 15
afternoon 15
sun 15
i 15
stood 15
on 15
tiptoe 15
hastily 15
looked 15
around 15
once 15
more 15
reached 15
into 15
the 15
hole 15
and 15
withdrew 15
two 15
pieces 15
of 15
chewing 15
gum 15
minus 15
their 15
outer 15
wrappers 15
my 15
first 15
impulse 15
was 15
to 15
get 15
it 15
into 15
my 15
mouth 15
as 15
quickly 15
as 15
possible 15
but 15
i 15
remembered 15
where 15
i 15
was 15
i 15
ran 15
home 15
and 15
on 15
our 15
front 15
porch 15
i 15
examined 15
my 15
loot 15
the 15
gum 15
looked 15
fresh 15
i 15
sniffed 15
it 15
and 15
it 15
smelled 15
all 15
right 15
i 15
licked 15
it 15
and 15
waited 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
when 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
die 15
i 15
crammed 15
it 15
into 15
my 15
mouth 15
wrigleys 15
doublemint 15
when 15
jem 15

i 15
did 15
as 15
jem 15

me 15
for 15
some 15
reason 15
my 15
first 15
year 15
of 15
school 15
had 15
wrought 15
a 15
great 15
change 15
in 15
our 15
relationship 15
calpurnias 15
tyranny 15
unfairness 15
and 15
meddling 15
in 15
my 15
business 15
had 15
faded 15
to 15
gentle 15
grumblings 15
of 15
general 15
disapproval 15
on 15
my 15
part 15
i 15
went 15
to 15
much 15
trouble 15
sometimes 15
not 15
to 15
provoke 15
her 15
summer 15

and 15
howled 15
from 15
time 15
to 15
time 15
as 15
the 15
summer 15
progressed 15
so 15
did 15
our 15
game 15
we 15
polished 15
and 15
perfected 15
it 15
added 15
dialogue 15
and 15
plot 15
until 15
we 15
had 15
manufactured 15
a 15
small 15
play 15
upon 15
which 15
we 15
rang 15
changes 15
every 15

and 15
appear 15

good 15

his 15
worst 15
performance 15
his 15
worst 15
performance 15
was 15
gothic 15
i 15
reluctantly 15
played 15
assorted 15
ladies 15
who 15
entered 15
the 15
script 15
i 15
never 15
thought 15
it 15
as 15
much 15
fun 15
as 15
tarzan 15
and 15
i 15
played 15
that 15
summer 15
with 15
more 15
than 15
vague 15
anxiety 15
despite 15
jems 15
assurances 15
that 15
boo 15
radley 15
was 15
dead 15

a 15
melancholy 15
little 15
drama 15
woven 15
from 15
bits 15
and 15
scraps 15
of 15
gossip 15
and 15
neighborhood 15
legend 15

she 15
sat 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
and 15
cried 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
time 15
while 15
boo 15
slowly 15
whittled 15
away 15
all 15

away 15
and 15
crammed 15
him 15
beneath 15
the 15
steps 15
poking 15
him 15
with 15
the 15
brushbroom 15
jem 15
would 15
reappear 15
as 15
needed 15
in 15
the 15
shapes 15
of 15
the 15
sheriff 15
assorted 15
townsfolk 15

who 15
had 15
more 15
to 15
say 15
about 15
the 15
radleys 15
than 15
anybody 15
in 15
maycomb 15
when 15
it 15
was 15
time 15
to 15
play 15

sneak 15
into 15
the 15
house 15
steal 15
the 15
scissors 15
from 15
the 15
sewingmachine 15
drawer 15
when 15
calpurnias 15

in 15

up 15
newspapers 15
dill 15
would 15
walk 15
by 15
cough 15
at 15
jem 15
and 15
jem 15
would 15
fake 15
a 15
plunge 15
into 15
dills 15
thigh 15
from 15
where 15
i 15
stood 15

looked 15
real 15
when 15
mr 15
nathan 15
radley 15
passed 15
us 15
on 15
his 15
daily 15
trip 15
to 15
town 15
we 15
would 15
stand 15
still 15
and 15
silent 15
until 15
he 15
was 15
out 15
of 15
sight 15
then 15
wonder 15
what 15
he 15
would 15
do 15
to 15
us 15
if 15
he 15
suspected 15
our 15
activities 15
halted 15
when 15
any 15
of 15
the 15
neighbors 15
appeared 15
and 15
once 15
i 15
saw 15
miss 15
maudie 15
atkinson 15
staring 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
at 15
us 15
her 15
hedge 15
clippers 15
poised 15
in 15
midair 15

day 15

busily 15
playing 15

on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
looking 15
at 15
us 15
slapping 15
a 15
rolled 15
magazine 15
against 15

twelve 15
noon 15

asked 15

jem 15
jems 15
evasion 15
told 15
me 15
our 15
game 15

a 15
secret 15
so 15
i 15
kept 15
quiet 15
what 15

you 15
doing 15
with 15
those 15
scissors 15
then 15

radleys 15

jem 15
reddening 15
i 15
hope 15
it 15
doesnt 15
he 15
said 15
shortly 15
and 15
went 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
jem 15
shut 15
up 15
hes 15
gone 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
he 15
can 15
hear 15
us 15
in 15
there 15
safely 15
in 15
the 15
yard 15
dill 15
asked 15
jem 15
if 15
we 15
could 15
play 15
any 15
more 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
atticus 15
didnt 15
say 15
we 15
couldnt 15
jem 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
think 15
atticus 15
knows 15
it 15
anyway 15
no 15
he 15
dont 15
if 15
he 15
did 15
hed 15
say 15
he 15
did 15
i 15
was 15
not 15
so 15
sure 15
but 15
jem 15
told 15
me 15
i 15
was 15
being 15
a 15
girl 15
that 15
girls 15
always 15
imagined 15
things 15
thats 15
why 15
other 15
people 15
hated 15
them 15
so 15
and 15
if 15
i 15
started 15
behaving 15
like 15
one 15
i 15
could 15
just 15
go 15
off 15
and 15
find 15
some 15
to 15
play 15
with 15
all 15
right 15
you 15
just 15
keep 15
it 15
up 15
then 15
i 15
said 15
youll 15
find 15
out 15
atticuss 15
arrival 15
was 15
the 15
second 15
reason 15
i 15
wanted 15
to 15
quit 15
the 15
game 15
the 15
first 15
reason 15
happened 15
the 15
day 15
i 15
rolled 15
into 15
the 15
radley 15
front 15
yard 15
through 15
all 15
the 15
headshaking 15
quelling 15
of 15
nausea 15
and 15
jemyelling 15
i 15
had 15
heard 15
another 15
sound 15
so 15
low 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
have 15
heard 15
it 15
from 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
someone 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
was 15
laughing 15
my 15
nagging 15
got 15
the 15
better 15
of 15
jem 15
eventually 15
as 15
i 15
knew 15
it 15
would 15
and 15
to 15
my 15
relief 15
we 15
slowed 15
down 15
the 15
game 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
he 15
still 15
maintained 15
however 15
that 15
atticus 15
hadnt 15
said 15
we 15
couldnt 15
therefore 15
we 15
could 15
and 15
if 15
atticus 15
ever 15
said 15
we 15
couldnt 15
jem 15
had 15
thought 15
of 15
a 15
way 15
around 15
it 15
he 15
would 15
simply 15
change 15
the 15
names 15
of 15
the 15
characters 15
and 15
then 15
we 15
couldnt 15
be 15
accused 15
of 15
playing 15
anything 15
dill 15
was 15
in 15
hearty 15
agreement 15
with 15
this 15
plan 15
of 15
action 15
dill 15
was 15
becoming 15
something 15
of 15
a 15
trial 15
anyway 15
following 15
jem 15
about 15
he 15
had 15
asked 15
me 15
earlier 15
in 15
the 15
summer 15
to 15
marry 15
him 15
then 15
he 15
promptly 15
forgot 15
about 15
it 15
he 15
staked 15
me 15
out 15
marked 15
as 15
his 15
property 15
said 15
i 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
girl 15
he 15
would 15
ever 15
love 15
then 15
he 15
neglected 15
me 15
i 15
beat 15
him 15
up 15
twice 15
but 15
it 15
did 15
no 15
good 15
he 15
only 15
grew 15
closer 15
to 15
jem 15
they 15
spent 15
days 15
together 15
in 15
the 15
treehouse 15
plotting 15
and 15
planning 15
calling 15
me 15
only 15
when 15
they 15
needed 15
a 15
third 15
party 15
but 15
i 15
kept 15
aloof 15
from 15
their 15
more 15
foolhardy 15
schemes 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
and 15
on 15
pain 15
of 15
being 15
called 15
a 15
girl 15
i 15
spent 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
remaining 15
twilights 15
that 15
summer 15
sitting 15
with 15
miss 15
maudie 15
atkinson 15
on 15
her 15
front 15
porch 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
always 15
enjoyed 15
the 15
free 15
run 15
of 15
miss 15
maudies 15
yard 15
if 15
we 15
kept 15
out 15
of 15
her 15
azaleas 15
but 15
our 15
contact 15
with 15
her 15
was 15
not 15
clearly 15
defined 15
until 15
jem 15
and 15
dill 15
excluded 15
me 15
from 15
their 15
plans 15
she 15
was 15
only 15
another 15
lady 15
in 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
but 15
a 15
relatively 15
benign 15
presence 15
our 15
tacit 15
treaty 15
with 15
miss 15
maudie 15
was 15
that 15
we 15
could 15
play 15
on 15
her 15
lawn 15
eat 15
her 15
scuppernongs 15
if 15
we 15
didnt 15
jump 15
on 15
the 15
arbor 15
and 15
explore 15
her 15
vast 15
back 15
lot 15
terms 15
so 15
generous 15
we 15
seldom 15
spoke 15
to 15
her 15
so 15
careful 15
were 15
we 15
to 15
preserve 15
the 15
delicate 15
balance 15
of 15
our 15
relationship 15
but 15
jem 15
and 15
dill 15
drove 15
me 15
closer 15
to 15
her 15
with 15
their 15
behavior 15
miss 15
maudie 15
hated 15
her 15
house 15
time 15
spent 15
indoors 15
was 15
time 15
wasted 15
she 15
was 15
a 15
widow 15
a 15
chameleon 15
lady 15
who 15
worked 15
in 15
her 15
flower 15
beds 15
in 15
an 15
old 15
straw 15
hat 15
and 15
mens 15
coveralls 15
but 15
after 15
her 15
five 15
oclock 15
bath 15
she 15
would 15
appear 15
on 15
the 15
porch 15
and 15
reign 15
over 15
the 15
street 15
in 15
magisterial 15
beauty 15
she 15
loved 15
everything 15
that 15
grew 15
in 15
gods 15
earth 15
even 15
the 15
weeds 15
with 15
one 15
exception 15
if 15
she 15
found 15
a 15
blade 15
of 15
nut 15
grass 15
in 15
her 15
yard 15
it 15
was 15
like 15
the 15
second 15
battle 15
of 15
the 15
marne 15
she 15
swooped 15
down 15
upon 15
it 15
with 15
a 15
tin 15
tub 15
and 15
subjected 15
it 15
to 15
blasts 15
from 15
beneath 15
with 15
a 15
poisonous 15
substance 15
she 15
said 15
was 15
so 15
powerful 15
itd 15
kill 15
us 15
all 15
if 15
we 15
didnt 15
stand 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
way 15
why 15
cant 15
you 15
just 15
pull 15
it 15
up 15
i 15
asked 15
after 15
witnessing 15
a 15
prolonged 15
campaign 15

it 15
up 15
she 15
picked 15
up 15
the 15
limp 15
sprout 15
and 15
squeezed 15
her 15
thumb 15
up 15
its 15
tiny 15
stalk 15
microscopic 15
grains 15
oozed 15
out 15
why 15
one 15
sprig 15
of 15
nut 15
grass 15
can 15
ruin 15
a 15
whole 15
yard 15
look 15
here 15
when 15
it 15
comes 15
fall 15
this 15
dries 15
up 15
and 15
the 15
wind 15
blows 15
it 15
all 15
over 15
maycomb 15
county 15
miss 15
maudies 15
face 15
likened 15
such 15
an 15
occurrence 15
unto 15
an 15
old 15
testament 15
pestilence 15
her 15
speech 15
was 15
crisp 15
for 15
a 15
maycomb 15
county 15
inhabitant 15
she 15
called 15
us 15
by 15
all 15
our 15
names 15
and 15
when 15
she 15
grinned 15
she 15
revealed 15
two 15
minute 15
gold 15
prongs 15
clipped 15
to 15
her 15
eyeteeth 15
when 15
i 15
admired 15
them 15
and 15
hoped 15
i 15
would 15
have 15
some 15
eventually 15
she 15
said 15
look 15
here 15
with 15
a 15
click 15
of 15
her 15
tongue 15
she 15
thrust 15
out 15
her 15
bridgework 15
a 15
gesture 15
of 15
cordiality 15
that 15
cemented 15
our 15
friendship 15
miss 15
maudies 15
benevolence 15
extended 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
dill 15
whenever 15
they 15
paused 15
in 15
their 15
pursuits 15
we 15
reaped 15
the 15
benefits 15
of 15
a 15
talent 15
miss 15
maudie 15
had 15
hitherto 15
kept 15
hidden 15
from 15
us 15
she 15
made 15
the 15
best 15
cakes 15
in 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
when 15
she 15
was 15
admitted 15
into 15
our 15
confidence 15
every 15
time 15
she 15
baked 15
she 15
made 15
a 15
big 15
cake 15
and 15
three 15
little 15
ones 15
and 15
she 15
would 15
call 15
across 15
the 15
street 15

charles 15
baker 15
harris 15

here 15
our 15
promptness 15

always 15
rewarded 15
in 15
summertime 15
twilights 15
are 15
long 15
and 15
peaceful 15
often 15
as 15
not 15
miss 15
maudie 15
and 15
i 15
would 15
sit 15
silently 15
on 15
her 15
porch 15
watching 15
the 15
sky 15
go 15
from 15
yellow 15
to 15
pink 15
as 15
the 15
sun 15
went 15
down 15
watching 15
flights 15
of 15
martins 15
sweep 15
low 15
over 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
and 15
disappear 15
behind 15
the 15
schoolhouse 15
rooftops 15
miss 15

morbid 15
subject 15

and 15
they 15
stuffed 15
him 15
up 15
the 15
chimney 15
where 15

you 15
get 15
such 15
a 15
notion 15
thats 15
what 15
jem 15

thought 15
they 15
did 15
sssss 15
he 15
gets 15
more 15
like 15
jack 15
finch 15
every 15
day 15
miss 15
maudie 15
had 15
known 15
uncle 15
jack 15
finch 15
atticuss 15
brother 15
since 15
they 15
were 15
children 15
nearly 15
the 15
same 15
age 15
they 15
had 15
grown 15
up 15
together 15
at 15
finchs 15
landing 15
miss 15
maudie 15
was 15
the 15
daughter 15
of 15
a 15
neighboring 15
landowner 15
dr 15
frank 15
buford 15
dr 15
bufords 15
profession 15
was 15
medicine 15
and 15
his 15
obsession 15
was 15
anything 15
that 15
grew 15
in 15
the 15
ground 15
so 15
he 15
stayed 15
poor 15
uncle 15
jack 15
finch 15
confined 15
his 15
passion 15
for 15
digging 15
to 15
his 15
window 15
boxes 15
in 15
nashville 15
and 15
stayed 15
rich 15
we 15
saw 15
uncle 15
jack 15
every 15
christmas 15
and 15
every 15
christmas 15
he 15
yelled 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
for 15
miss 15
maudie 15
to 15
come 15
marry 15
him 15
miss 15
maudie 15
would 15
yell 15
back 15
call 15
a 15
little 15
louder 15
jack 15
finch 15
and 15
theyll 15
hear 15
you 15
at 15
the 15
post 15
office 15
i 15
havent 15
heard 15
you 15
yet 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
thought 15
this 15
a 15
strange 15
way 15
to 15
ask 15
for 15
a 15
ladys 15
hand 15
in 15
marriage 15
but 15
then 15
uncle 15
jack 15
was 15
rather 15
strange 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
get 15
miss 15
maudies 15
goat 15
that 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
trying 15
unsuccessfully 15
for 15
forty 15
years 15
that 15
he 15
was 15
the 15
last 15
person 15
in 15
the 15
world 15
miss 15
maudie 15
would 15
think 15
about 15
marrying 15
but 15
the 15
first 15
person 15
she 15
thought 15
about 15
teasing 15
and 15
the 15
best 15
defense 15
to 15
her 15
was 15
spirited 15
offense 15
all 15
of 15
which 15
we 15
understood 15
clearly 15
arthur 15
radley 15
just 15
stays 15
in 15
the 15

thats 15
all 15

miss 15
maudie 15
wouldnt 15
you 15
stay 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
if 15
you 15
didnt 15
want 15
to 15
come 15
out 15
yessum 15
but 15
id 15
wanta 15
come 15
out 15
why 15
doesnt 15
he 15
miss 15
maudies 15
eyes 15
narrowed 15
you 15
know 15
that 15
story 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
i 15
do 15
i 15
never 15
heard 15
why 15
though 15
nobody 15
ever 15
told 15
me 15
why 15
miss 15
maudie 15
settled 15
her 15
bridgework 15
you 15
know 15
old 15
mr 15
radley 15
was 15
a 15
footwashing 15
baptist 15
thats 15
what 15
you 15
are 15
aint 15
it 15
my 15
shells 15
not 15

hard 15
child 15
im 15
just 15
a 15
baptist 15
dont 15
you 15

footwashing 15
we 15

in 15
the 15
bathtub 15
but 15
we 15
cant 15
have 15
communion 15
with 15
you 15
all 15
apparently 15
deciding 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
easier 15
to 15
define 15
primitive 15
baptistry 15
than 15
closed 15
communion 15
miss 15
maudie 15
said 15
footwashers 15
believe 15
anything 15
thats 15
pleasure 15
is 15
a 15
sin 15
did 15
you 15
know 15
some 15
of 15
em 15
came 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
woods 15
one 15
saturday 15
and 15

by 15

place 15
and 15

me 15
me 15
and 15
my 15
flowers 15

going 15
to 15
hell 15

i 15
spent 15
too 15
much 15
time 15
in 15
gods 15
outdoors 15
and 15
not 15
enough 15
time 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
reading 15
the 15
bible 15
my 15
confidence 15
in 15
pulpit 15
gospel 15
lessened 15
at 15
the 15
vision 15
of 15
miss 15
maudie 15
stewing 15
forever 15
in 15
various 15
protestant 15
hells 15
true 15
enough 15
she 15
had 15
an 15
acid 15
tongue 15
in 15
her 15
head 15
and 15
she 15
did 15
not 15
go 15
about 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
doing 15
good 15
as 15
did 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
but 15
while 15
no 15
one 15
with 15
a 15
grain 15
of 15
sense 15
trusted 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
considerable 15
faith 15
in 15
miss 15
maudie 15
she 15
had 15
never 15
told 15
on 15
us 15
had 15
never 15
played 15
catandmouse 15
with 15
us 15
she 15
was 15
not 15
at 15
all 15
interested 15
in 15
our 15
private 15
lives 15
she 15
was 15
our 15
friend 15
how 15
so 15
reasonable 15
a 15
creature 15
could 15
live 15
in 15
peril 15
of 15
everlasting 15
torment 15
was 15
incomprehensible 15
that 15
aint 15
right 15
miss 15
maudie 15
youre 15
the 15
best 15
lady 15
i 15
know 15
miss 15
maudie 15
grinned 15
thank 15
you 15
maam 15
thing 15
is 15
footwashers 15
think 15
women 15
are 15
a 15
sin 15
by 15
definition 15
they 15
take 15
the 15
bible 15
literally 15
you 15
know 15
is 15
that 15
why 15
mr 15
arthur 15
stays 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
to 15
keep 15
away 15
from 15
women 15
ive 15
no 15
idea 15
it 15
doesnt 15
make 15
sense 15
to 15
me 15
looks 15
like 15
if 15
mr 15
arthur 15
was 15
hankerin 15
after 15
heaven 15
hed 15
come 15
out 15
on 15

atticus 15

loving 15
folks 15
like 15
you 15
love 15
yourself 15
miss 15
maudie 15
stopped 15
rocking 15
and 15
her 15
voice 15
hardened 15
you 15
are 15
too 15
young 15
to 15
understand 15
it 15
she 15
said 15
but 15
sometimes 15
the 15
bible 15
in 15
the 15
hand 15
of 15
one 15
man 15
is 15
worse 15
than 15
a 15
whiskey 15
bottle 15
in 15
the 15
hand 15
of 15
oh 15
of 15
your 15
father 15
i 15
was 15
shocked 15
atticus 15
doesnt 15

drop 15
in 15
his 15
life 15
nome 15

one 15
time 15
and 15
didnt 15
like 15
it 15
miss 15
maudie 15
laughed 15
wasnt 15
talking 15
about 15
your 15
father 15
she 15
said 15
what 15
i 15
meant 15
was 15
if 15
atticus 15
finch 15
drank 15
until 15
he 15
was 15
drunk 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
be 15

hard 15
as 15
some 15
men 15

at 15
their 15

and 15
you 15

side 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
i 15
walked 15
beyond 15
jem 15
and 15

where 15
i 15

all 15
clear 15
i 15

a 15
soul 15

up 15
the 15

to 15

who 15
nodded 15
jem 15
attached 15
the 15

to 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
fishing 15
pole 15

the 15
pole 15
out 15
across 15
the 15
yard 15
and 15
pushed 15
it 15
toward 15
the 15
window 15
he 15
had 15
selected 15
the 15
pole 15
lacked 15
several 15
inches 15
of 15
being 15
long 15
enough 15
and 15
jem 15
leaned 15
over 15
as 15
far 15
as 15
he 15
could 15
i 15
watched 15
him 15
making 15
jabbing 15
motions 15
for 15
so 15
long 15
i 15
abandoned 15
my 15
post 15
and 15
went 15
to 15
him 15
cant 15
get 15
it 15
off 15
the 15
pole 15

around 15
the 15
curve 15
at 15
the 15
empty 15
road 15
occasionally 15
i 15
looked 15
back 15
at 15
jem 15
who 15
was 15
patiently 15
trying 15
to 15
place 15
the 15
note 15
on 15
the 15
window 15
sill 15
it 15

flutter 15
to 15
the 15
ground 15
and 15
jem 15
would 15
jab 15
it 15
up 15
until 15
i 15
thought 15
if 15
boo 15
radley 15

it 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
be 15

his 15
bloody 15
fangs 15

trudged 15
along 15
dragging 15
the 15

his 15
hat 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15

mr 15
radley 15
what 15
were 15

trying 15
to 15
give 15
him 15
just 15
a 15
letter 15
let 15
me 15
see 15
it 15
jem 15
held 15
out 15
a 15
filthy 15
piece 15
of 15
paper 15
atticus 15
took 15
it 15
and 15
tried 15
to 15
read 15
it 15
why 15
do 15
you 15
want 15
mr 15
radley 15
to 15
come 15
out 15
dill 15
said 15
we 15
thought 15
he 15
might 15
enjoy 15
us 15
and 15
dried 15
up 15
when 15
atticus 15
looked 15
at 15
him 15
son 15
he 15
said 15
to 15
jem 15
im 15
going 15
to 15
tell 15
you 15
something 15
and 15
tell 15
you 15
one 15
time 15
stop 15
tormenting 15
that 15
man 15
that 15
goes 15
for 15
the 15
other 15
two 15
of 15
you 15
what 15
mr 15
radley 15
did 15
was 15
his 15
own 15
business 15
if 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
come 15
out 15
he 15
would 15
if 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
stay 15
inside 15
his 15
own 15
house 15
he 15
had 15
the 15
right 15
to 15
stay 15
inside 15
free 15
from 15
the 15
attentions 15
of 15
inquisitive 15
children 15
which 15
was 15
a 15
mild 15
term 15
for 15
the 15
likes 15
of 15
us 15
how 15
would 15
we 15
like 15
it 15
if 15
atticus 15
barged 15
in 15
on 15
us 15
without 15
knocking 15
when 15
we 15
were 15
in 15
our 15
rooms 15
at 15
night 15
we 15
were 15
in 15
effect 15
doing 15
the 15
same 15
thing 15
to 15
mr 15
radley 15
what 15
mr 15
radley 15
did 15
might 15
seem 15
peculiar 15
to 15
us 15
but 15
it 15
did 15
not 15
seem 15
peculiar 15
to 15
him 15
furthermore 15
had 15
it 15
never 15
occurred 15
to 15
us 15
that 15
the 15
civil 15
way 15
to 15
communicate 15
with 15
another 15
being 15
was 15
by 15
the 15
front 15
door 15
instead 15
of 15
a 15
side 15
window 15
lastly 15
we 15
were 15
to 15
stay 15
away 15
from 15
that 15
house 15
until 15
we 15
were 15
invited 15
there 15
we 15
were 15
not 15
to 15
play 15
an 15
asinine 15
game 15
he 15
had 15
seen 15
us 15
playing 15
or 15
make 15
fun 15
of 15
anybody 15
on 15
this 15
street 15
or 15
in 15
this 15
town 15
we 15
werent 15
makin 15
fun 15
of 15
him 15
we 15
werent 15
laughin 15
at 15
him 15
said 15
jem 15
we 15
were 15
just 15
so 15
that 15
was 15
what 15
you 15
were 15
doing 15
wasnt 15
it 15
makin 15
fun 15
of 15
him 15
no 15
said 15
atticus 15
putting 15
his 15
lifes 15
history 15
on 15
display 15
for 15
the 15
edification 15
of 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
jem 15
seemed 15
to 15
swell 15
a 15
little 15
i 15
didnt 15
say 15
we 15
were 15
doin 15
that 15
i 15
didnt 15
say 15
it 15
atticus 15
grinned 15
dryly 15
you 15
just 15
told 15
me 15
he 15
said 15
you 15
stop 15
this 15
nonsense 15
right 15
now 15
every 15
one 15
of 15
you 15
jem 15
gaped 15
at 15
him 15
you 15
want 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
lawyer 15
dont 15
you 15
our 15
fathers 15
mouth 15
was 15
suspiciously 15
firm 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
trying 15
to 15
hold 15
it 15
in 15
line 15
jem 15
decided 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
point 15
in 15
quibbling 15
and 15
was 15
silent 15
when 15
atticus 15
went 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
to 15
retrieve 15
a 15
file 15
he 15
had 15
forgotten 15
to 15
take 15
to 15
work 15
that 15
morning 15
jem 15
finally 15
realized 15
that 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
done 15
in 15
by 15
the 15
oldest 15
lawyers 15
trick 15
on 15
record 15
he 15
waited 15
a 15
respectful 15
distance 15
from 15
the 15
front 15
steps 15
watched 15
atticus 15
leave 15
the 15
house 15
and 15
walk 15
toward 15
town 15
when 15
atticus 15
was 15
out 15
of 15
earshot 15
jem 15
yelled 15
after 15
him 15
i 15
thought 15
i 15
wanted 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
lawyer 15
but 15
i 15
aint 15
so 15
sure 15
now 15
yes 15
said 15
our 15
father 15
when 15
jem 15
asked 15
him 15
if 15
we 15
could 15
go 15
over 15
and 15
sit 15
by 15

that 15
separated 15
miss 15
rachels 15
yard 15
from 15

jem 15
whistled 15
bobwhite 15
and 15
dill 15
answered 15
in 15
the 15

rising 15
behind 15

a 15
lady 15
in 15
the 15

in 15
maycomb 15

every 15

until 15
nine 15
oclock 15
and 15
sneezed 15
one 15
evening 15
we 15
were 15
privileged 15
to 15
witness 15
a 15
performance 15
by 15
him 15
which 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
been 15
his 15
positively 15
last 15
for 15
he 15
never 15
did 15
it 15
again 15
so 15
long 15
as 15
we 15
watched 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
leaving 15
miss 15
rachels 15

when 15
dill 15

golly 15
looka 15
yonder 15
he 15
pointed 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
at 15
first 15
we 15
saw 15
nothing 15
but 15
a 15
kudzucovered 15
front 15
porch 15
but 15
a 15
closer 15
inspection 15
revealed 15
an 15
arc 15
of 15
water 15
descending 15
from 15
the 15
leaves 15
and 15
splashing 15
in 15
the 15
yellow 15
circle 15
of 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
some 15
ten 15
feet 15
from 15
source 15
to 15
earth 15
it 15
seemed 15
to 15
us 15
jem 15
said 15
mr 15
avery 15
misfigured 15
dill 15
said 15
he 15
must 15
drink 15
a 15
gallon 15
a 15
day 15
and 15
the 15
ensuing 15
contest 15
to 15
determine 15
relative 15
distances 15
and 15
respective 15
prowess 15
only 15
made 15
me 15
feel 15
left 15
out 15
again 15
as 15
i 15
was 15
untalented 15
in 15
this 15
area 15
dill 15
stretched 15
yawned 15
and 15
said 15
altogether 15
too 15
casually 15
i 15
know 15
what 15
lets 15
go 15
for 15
a 15
walk 15
he 15
sounded 15
fishy 15
to 15
me 15
nobody 15
in 15
maycomb 15
just 15
went 15
for 15
a 15
walk 15
where 15
to 15
dill 15
dill 15
jerked 15
his 15
head 15
in 15
a 15
southerly 15
direction 15
jem 15
said 15
okay 15
when 15
i 15
protested 15
he 15
said 15
sweetly 15
you 15
dont 15
have 15
to 15
come 15
along 15
angel 15
may 15
you 15

have 15
to 15
go 15
remember 15
jem 15
was 15
not 15
one 15
to 15
dwell 15
on 15
past 15
defeats 15
it 15
seemed 15
the 15
only 15
message 15
he 15
got 15
from 15
atticus 15
was 15
insight 15
into 15
the 15
art 15
of 15
cross 15
examination 15
scout 15
we 15
aint 15
gonna 15
do 15
anything 15
were 15
just 15
goin 15
to 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
and 15
back 15
we 15
strolled 15
silently 15
down 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
listening 15
to 15
porch 15
swings 15
creaking 15
with 15
the 15
weight 15
of 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
listening 15
to 15
the 15
soft 15
nightmurmurs 15
of 15
the 15
grown 15
people 15
on 15
our 15
street 15
occasionally 15
we 15
heard 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
laugh 15
well 15
said 15
dill 15
okay 15
said 15
jem 15
why 15
dont 15
you 15
go 15
on 15
home 15
scout 15
what 15
are 15
you 15
gonna 15
do 15
dill 15
and 15
jem 15
were 15
simply 15
going 15
to 15
peep 15
in 15
the 15
window 15
with 15
the 15
loose 15
shutter 15
to 15
see 15
if 15
they 15
could 15
get 15
a 15
look 15
at 15
boo 15
radley 15
and 15
if 15
i 15
didnt 15
want 15
to 15
go 15
with 15
them 15
i 15
could 15
go 15
straight 15
home 15
and 15
keep 15
my 15
fat 15
flopping 15
mouth 15
shut 15
that 15
was 15
all 15
but 15
what 15
in 15
the 15
sam 15
holy 15
hill 15
did 15
you 15
wait 15
till 15
tonight 15
because 15
nobody 15
could 15
see 15
them 15
at 15
night 15
because 15
atticus 15
would 15
be 15
so 15
deep 15
in 15
a 15
book 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
hear 15
the 15
kingdom 15
coming 15
because 15
if 15
boo 15
radley 15
killed 15
them 15
theyd 15
miss 15
school 15
instead 15
of 15
vacation 15
and 15
because 15
it 15
was 15
easier 15
to 15
see 15
inside 15
a 15
dark 15
house 15
in 15
the 15
dark 15
than 15
in 15
the 15
daytime 15
did 15
i 15
understand 15
jem 15
please 15
scout 15
im 15
tellin 15
you 15

the 15
last 15

lord 15
youre 15
gettin 15
more 15
like 15
a 15
girl 15
every 15
day 15
with 15
that 15
i 15
had 15
no 15
option 15
but 15
to 15
join 15
them 15
we 15
thought 15
it 15
was 15
better 15
to 15
go 15
under 15
the 15
high 15
wire 15
fence 15
at 15
the 15
rear 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
lot 15
we 15
stood 15
less 15
chance 15
of 15
being 15
seen 15
the 15
fence 15
enclosed 15
a 15
large 15
garden 15
and 15
a 15
narrow 15
wooden 15
outhouse 15
jem 15
held 15
up 15
the 15
bottom 15
wire 15
and 15
motioned 15
dill 15
under 15
it 15
i 15
followed 15
and 15
held 15
up 15
the 15
wire 15
for 15
jem 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
tight 15
squeeze 15
for 15
him 15
dont 15
make 15
a 15
sound 15

part 15
company 15
sometimes 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
understand 15
him 15
but 15
my 15
periods 15
of 15
bewilderment 15
were 15
shortlived 15
this 15
was 15
beyond 15
me 15
please 15
i 15
pleaded 15
cantcha 15

about 15

for 15
a 15
minute 15
by 15
yourself 15
on 15
that 15
place 15

up 15

my 15

tight 15
then 15

with 15
you 15
i 15
choked 15
no 15
you 15
aint 15
youll 15
just 15
make 15
noise 15
it 15
was 15
no 15
use 15
i 15
unlatched 15
the 15
back 15
door 15
and 15
held 15
it 15
while 15
he 15
crept 15
down 15
the 15
steps 15
it 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
two 15
oclock 15
the 15
moon 15
was 15
setting 15
and 15
the 15
latticework 15
shadows 15
were 15
fading 15
into 15
fuzzy 15
nothingness 15
jems 15
white 15
shirttail 15
dipped 15
and 15
bobbed 15
like 15
a 15
small 15
ghost 15
dancing 15
away 15
to 15
escape 15
the 15
coming 15
morning 15
a 15
faint 15
breeze 15
stirred 15
and 15
cooled 15
the 15
sweat 15
running 15
down 15
my 15
sides 15
he 15
went 15
the 15
back 15
way 15
through 15
deers 15
pasture 15
across 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
and 15
around 15
to 15
the 15
fence 15
i 15
thought 15
at 15
least 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
way 15
he 15
was 15
headed 15
it 15
would 15
take 15
longer 15
so 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
time 15
to 15
worry 15
yet 15
i 15
waited 15
until 15
it 15
was 15
time 15
to 15
worry 15
and 15
listened 15
for 15
mr 15
radleys 15
shotgun 15
then 15
i 15
thought 15
i 15
heard 15
the 15
back 15
fence 15
squeak 15
it 15
was 15
wishful 15
thinking 15
then 15
i 15
heard 15
atticus 15
cough 15
i 15
held 15
my 15
breath 15
sometimes 15
when 15
we 15
made 15
a 15
midnight 15
pilgrimage 15
to 15
the 15
bathroom 15
we 15
would 15
find 15
him 15
reading 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
often 15
woke 15
up 15
during 15
the 15
night 15
checked 15
on 15
us 15
and 15
read 15
himself 15
back 15
to 15
sleep 15
i 15
waited 15
for 15
his 15
light 15
to 15
go 15
on 15
straining 15
my 15
eyes 15
to 15
see 15
it 15
flood 15
the 15
hall 15
it 15
stayed 15
off 15
and 15
i 15
breathed 15
again 15
the 15
nightcrawlers 15
had 15
retired 15
but 15
ripe 15
chinaberries 15
drummed 15
on 15
the 15
roof 15
when 15
the 15
wind 15
stirred 15
and 15
the 15
darkness 15
was 15
desolate 15
with 15
the 15
barking 15
of 15
distant 15
dogs 15
there 15
he 15
was 15
returning 15
to 15
me 15
his 15
white 15
shirt 15
bobbed 15
over 15
the 15
back 15
fence 15
and 15
slowly 15
grew 15
larger 15
he 15
came 15
up 15
the 15
back 15
steps 15
latched 15
the 15
door 15
behind 15
him 15
and 15
sat 15
on 15
his 15
cot 15
wordlessly 15
he 15
held 15
up 15
his 15
pants 15
he 15
lay 15
down 15
and 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
i 15
heard 15
his 15
cot 15
trembling 15
soon 15
he 15
was 15
still 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
hear 15
him 15
stir 15
again 15
jem 15
stayed 15
moody 15
and 15
silent 15
for 15
a 15
week 15
as 15
atticus 15
had 15
once 15
advised 15
me 15
to 15
do 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
climb 15
into 15
jems 15
skin 15
and 15
walk 15
around 15
in 15
it 15
if 15
i 15
had 15
gone 15
alone 15
to 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
at 15
two 15
in 15
the 15
morning 15
my 15
funeral 15
would 15
have 15
been 15
held 15
the 15
next 15
afternoon 15
so 15
i 15
left 15
jem 15
alone 15
and 15
tried 15
not 15
to 15
bother 15
him 15
school 15
started 15
the 15
second 15
grade 15
was 15
as 15
bad 15
as 15
the 15
first 15
only 15
worse 15
they 15
still 15
flashed 15
cards 15
at 15
you 15
and 15
wouldnt 15
let 15
you 15
read 15
or 15
write 15
miss 15
carolines 15
progress 15
next 15
door 15
could 15
be 15
estimated 15
by 15
the 15
frequency 15
of 15
laughter 15
however 15
the 15
usual 15
crew 15
had 15
flunked 15
the 15
first 15
grade 15
again 15
and 15
were 15
helpful 15
in 15
keeping 15
order 15
the 15
only 15
thing 15
good 15
about 15
the 15
second 15
grade 15
was 15
that 15
this 15
year 15
i 15
had 15
to 15
stay 15
as 15
late 15
as 15
jem 15
and 15
we 15
usually 15
walked 15
home 15
together 15
at 15
three 15
oclock 15
one 15
afternoon 15
when 15
we 15
were 15
crossing 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
toward 15
home 15
jem 15
suddenly 15
said 15
theres 15
something 15
i 15
didnt 15
tell 15
you 15
as 15
this 15
was 15
his 15
first 15
complete 15
sentence 15
in 15
several 15
days 15
i 15
encouraged 15
him 15
about 15
what 15
about 15
that 15
night 15
youve 15
never 15
told 15
me 15
anything 15
about 15
that 15
night 15
i 15
said 15
jem 15
waved 15
my 15
words 15
away 15
as 15
if 15
fanning 15
gnats 15
he 15
was 15
silent 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
then 15
he 15
said 15
when 15
i 15
went 15
back 15
for 15
my 15
breeches 15
they 15
were 15
all 15
in 15
a 15
tangle 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
gettin 15
out 15
of 15

when 15
i 15
went 15
back 15
jem 15
took 15
a 15
deep 15
breath 15
when 15
i 15
went 15
back 15
they 15
were 15
folded 15
across 15
the 15
fence 15
like 15
they 15
were 15
expectin 15
me 15
across 15
and 15
something 15
else 15

from 15
the 15
bigger 15
folks 15
you 15
know 15
its 15
only 15
when 15
schools 15
in 15
that 15
weve 15
found 15
things 15
yeah 15
i 15
said 15
but 15
we 15
never 15
go 15
by 15
here 15
in 15
the 15
summertime 15
we 15
went 15
home 15
next 15
morning 15
the 15
twine 15
was 15
where 15
we 15
had 15
left 15
it 15
when 15
it 15
was 15
still 15
there 15
on 15
the 15
third 15
day 15
jem 15
pocketed 15
it 15
from 15
then 15
on 15
we 15
considered 15
everything 15
we 15
found 15
in 15
the 15
knothole 15
our 15
property 15
the 15
second 15
grade 15
was 15
grim 15
but 15
jem 15
assured 15
me 15
that 15
the 15
older 15
i 15
got 15
the 15
better 15
school 15
would 15
be 15
that 15
he 15
started 15
off 15
the 15
same 15
way 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
until 15
one 15
reached 15
the 15
sixth 15
grade 15
that 15
one 15
learned 15
anything 15
of 15
value 15
the 15
sixth 15
grade 15
seemed 15
to 15
please 15
him 15
from 15
the 15
beginning 15
he 15
went 15
through 15
a 15
brief 15
egyptian 15
period 15
that 15
baffled 15
me 15
he 15
tried 15
to 15
walk 15
flat 15
a 15
great 15
deal 15
sticking 15
one 15
arm 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
him 15
and 15
one 15
in 15
back 15
of 15
him 15
putting 15
one 15
foot 15
behind 15
the 15
other 15
he 15
declared 15
egyptians 15
walked 15
that 15
way 15
i 15
said 15
if 15
they 15
did 15
i 15
didnt 15
see 15
how 15
they 15
got 15
anything 15
done 15
but 15
jem 15
said 15
they 15
accomplished 15
more 15
than 15
the 15
americans 15
ever 15
did 15
they 15
invented 15
toilet 15
paper 15
and 15
perpetual 15
embalming 15
and 15
asked 15
where 15
would 15
we 15
be 15
today 15
if 15
they 15
hadnt 15
atticus 15
told 15
me 15
to 15
delete 15
the 15
adjectives 15
and 15
id 15
have 15
the 15
facts 15
there 15
are 15
no 15
clearly 15
defined 15
seasons 15
in 15
south 15
alabama 15
summer 15
drifts 15
into 15
autumn 15
and 15
autumn 15
is 15
sometimes 15
never 15
followed 15
by 15
winter 15
but 15
turns 15
to 15
a 15
daysold 15
spring 15
that 15
melts 15
into 15
summer 15
again 15
that 15
fall 15
was 15
a 15
long 15
one 15
hardly 15
cool 15
enough 15
for 15
a 15
light 15
jacket 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
trotting 15
in 15
our 15
orbit 15
one 15
mild 15
october 15
afternoon 15
when 15
our 15
knothole 15
stopped 15
us 15
again 15
something 15
white 15
was 15
inside 15
this 15
time 15
jem 15
let 15
me 15
do 15
the 15
honors 15
i 15
pulled 15
out 15
two 15
small 15
images 15
carved 15
in 15
soap 15
one 15
was 15
the 15
figure 15
of 15
a 15
boy 15
the 15
other 15
wore 15
a 15
crude 15
dress 15
before 15
i 15
remembered 15
that 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
such 15
thing 15
as 15
hoodooing 15
i 15
shrieked 15
and 15
threw 15
them 15
down 15
jem 15
snatched 15
them 15
up 15
whats 15
the 15
matter 15
with 15
you 15
he 15
yelled 15
he 15
rubbed 15
the 15
figures 15
free 15
of 15
red 15
dust 15
these 15
are 15
good 15
he 15
said 15
ive 15
never 15
seen 15
any 15
these 15
good 15
he 15
held 15
them 15
down 15
to 15
me 15
they 15
were 15
almost 15
perfect 15
miniatures 15
of 15
two 15
children 15
the 15
boy 15
had 15
on 15
shorts 15
and 15
a 15
shock 15
of 15
soapy 15
hair 15
fell 15
to 15
his 15
eyebrows 15
i 15
looked 15
up 15
at 15
jem 15
a 15
point 15
of 15
straight 15
brown 15
hair 15
kicked 15
downwards 15
from 15
his 15
part 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
noticed 15
it 15
before 15
jem 15
looked 15
from 15
the 15
girldoll 15
to 15
me 15
the 15
girldoll 15
wore 15
bangs 15
so 15
did 15
i 15
these 15
are 15
us 15
he 15
said 15
who 15
did 15
em 15
you 15
reckon 15
who 15
do 15
we 15
know 15
around 15
here 15
who 15
whittles 15
he 15
asked 15
mr 15
avery 15
mr 15
avery 15
just 15
does 15
like 15
this 15
i 15
mean 15

mr 15
avery 15
averaged 15
a 15
stick 15
of 15
stovewood 15
per 15
week 15
he 15
honed 15
it 15
down 15
to 15
a 15
toothpick 15
and 15
chewed 15
it 15
theres 15
old 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawfords 15
sweetheart 15
i 15
said 15
he 15
carves 15
all 15
right 15
but 15
he 15
lives 15
down 15
the 15
country 15
when 15
would 15
he 15
ever 15
pay 15
any 15
attention 15
to 15
us 15
maybe 15
he 15
sits 15
on 15
the 15
porch 15
and 15
looks 15
at 15
us 15
instead 15
of 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
if 15
i 15
was 15
him 15
i 15
would 15
jem 15
stared 15
at 15
me 15
so 15
long 15
i 15
asked 15
what 15
was 15
the 15
matter 15
but 15
got 15
nothing 15
scout 15
for 15
an 15
answer 15
when 15
we 15
went 15
home 15
jem 15
put 15
the 15
dolls 15
in 15
his 15
trunk 15
less 15
than 15
two 15
weeks 15
later 15
we 15
found 15
a 15
whole 15
package 15
of 15
chewing 15
gum 15
which 15
we 15
enjoyed 15
the 15
fact 15
that 15
everything 15
on 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
was 15
poison 15
having 15
slipped 15
jems 15
memory 15
the 15
following 15
week 15
the 15
knothole 15
yielded 15
a 15
tarnished 15
medal 15
jem 15
showed 15
it 15
to 15
atticus 15
who 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
spelling 15
medal 15
that 15
before 15
we 15
were 15
born 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
schools 15
had 15
spelling 15
contests 15
and 15
awarded 15
medals 15
to 15
the 15
winners 15
atticus 15
said 15
someone 15
must 15
have 15
lost 15
it 15
and 15
had 15
we 15
asked 15
around 15
jem 15
camelkicked 15
me 15
when 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
say 15
where 15
we 15
had 15
found 15
it 15
jem 15
asked 15
atticus 15
if 15
he 15
remembered 15
anybody 15
who 15
ever 15
won 15
one 15
and 15
atticus 15
said 15
no 15
our 15
biggest 15
prize 15
appeared 15
four 15
days 15
later 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
pocket 15
watch 15
that 15
wouldnt 15
run 15
on 15
a 15
chain 15
with 15
an 15
aluminum 15
knife 15
you 15
reckon 15
its 15
white 15
gold 15
jem 15
dont 15
know 15
ill 15
show 15
it 15
to 15
atticus 15
atticus 15
said 15
it 15
would 15
probably 15
be 15
worth 15
ten 15
dollars 15
knife 15
chain 15
and 15
all 15
if 15
it 15
were 15
new 15
did 15
you 15
swap 15
with 15
somebody 15
at 15
school 15
he 15
asked 15
oh 15
no 15
sir 15
jem 15
pulled 15
out 15
his 15
grandfathers 15
watch 15
that 15
atticus 15
let 15
him 15
carry 15
once 15
a 15
week 15
if 15
jem 15
were 15
careful 15
with 15
it 15
on 15
the 15
days 15
he 15
carried 15
the 15
watch 15
jem 15
walked 15
on 15
eggs 15
atticus 15
if 15
its 15
all 15
right 15
with 15
you 15
id 15
rather 15
have 15
this 15
one 15
instead 15
maybe 15
i 15
can 15
fix 15
it 15
when 15
the 15
new 15
wore 15
off 15
his 15
grandfathers 15
watch 15
and 15
carrying 15
it 15
became 15
a 15
days 15
burdensome 15
task 15
jem 15
no 15
longer 15
felt 15
the 15
necessity 15
of 15
ascertaining 15
the 15
hour 15
every 15
five 15
minutes 15
he 15
did 15
a 15
fair 15
job 15
only 15
one 15
spring 15
and 15
two 15
tiny 15
pieces 15

but 15
the 15
watch 15

face 15

brighten 15
and 15
he 15
would 15
lean 15
toward 15
me 15

jem 15
said 15
nothing 15
more 15
about 15

until 15
late 15
afternoon 15
when 15
we 15
passed 15
our 15
tree 15
he 15
gave 15
it 15
a 15
meditative 15
pat 15
on 15
its 15
cement 15
and 15
remained 15
deep 15
in 15
thought 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
working 15
himself 15
into 15
a 15
bad 15
humor 15
so 15
i 15
kept 15
my 15
distance 15
as 15
usual 15
we 15
met 15
atticus 15
coming 15
home 15
from 15

that 15
evening 15
when 15
we 15

it 15
was 15
dyin 15
well 15
maybe 15
it 15
is 15
im 15
sure 15
mr 15
radley 15
knows 15
more 15
about 15
his 15
trees 15
than 15
we 15
do 15
atticus 15
left 15
us 15
on 15
the 15
porch 15
jem 15
leaned 15
on 15
a 15
pillar 15
rubbing 15
his 15
shoulders 15
against 15
it 15
do 15
you 15
itch 15
jem 15
i 15
asked 15
as 15
politely 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
answer 15
come 15
on 15
in 15
jem 15
i 15
said 15
after 15
while 15
he 15
stood 15
there 15
until 15
nightfall 15
and 15
i 15
waited 15
for 15
him 15
when 15
we 15
went 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
i 15
saw 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
crying 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
dirty 15
in 15
the 15
right 15
places 15
but 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
odd 15
that 15
i 15
had 15
not 15
heard 15
him 15
for 15
reasons 15
unfathomable 15
to 15
the 15
most 15
experienced 15
prophets 15
in 15
maycomb 15
county 15
autumn 15
turned 15
to 15
winter 15
that 15
year 15
we 15
had 15
two 15
weeks 15
of 15
the 15
coldest 15
weather 15
since 15
atticus 15
said 15
mr 15
avery 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
written 15
on 15
the 15
rosetta 15
stone 15
that 15
when 15
children 15
disobeyed 15
their 15
parents 15
smoked 15
cigarettes 15
and 15
made 15
war 15
on 15
each 15
other 15
the 15
seasons 15
would 15
change 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
burdened 15
with 15
the 15
guilt 15
of 15
contributing 15
to 15
the 15
aberrations 15
of 15
nature 15
thereby 15
causing 15
unhappiness 15
to 15
our 15
neighbors 15
and 15
discomfort 15
to 15
ourselves 15
old 15
mrs 15
radley 15
died 15
that 15
winter 15
but 15
her 15
death 15
caused 15
hardly 15
a 15
ripple 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
seldom 15
saw 15
her 15
except 15
when 15
she 15
watered 15
her 15
cannas 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
decided 15
that 15
boo 15
had 15
got 15
her 15
at 15
last 15
but 15
when 15
atticus 15
returned 15
from 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
he 15
said 15
she 15
died 15
of 15
natural 15
causes 15
to 15
our 15
disappointment 15
ask 15
him 15
jem 15
whispered 15
you 15
ask 15
him 15
youre 15
the 15
oldest 15
thats 15
why 15
you 15
oughta 15
ask 15
him 15
atticus 15
i 15
said 15
did 15
you 15
see 15
mr 15
arthur 15
atticus 15
looked 15
sternly 15
around 15
his 15
newspaper 15
at 15
me 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
jem 15
restrained 15
me 15
from 15
further 15
questions 15
he 15
said 15
atticus 15
was 15
still 15
touchous 15
about 15
us 15
and 15
the 15
radleys 15
and 15
it 15
wouldnt 15
do 15
to 15
push 15
him 15
any 15
jem 15
had 15
a 15
notion 15
that 15
atticus 15
thought 15
our 15
activities 15
that 15
night 15
last 15
summer 15
were 15
not 15
solely 15
confined 15
to 15
strip 15
poker 15
jem 15
had 15
no 15
firm 15
basis 15
for 15
his 15
ideas 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
merely 15
a 15
twitch 15
next 15
morning 15
i 15
awoke 15
looked 15
out 15
the 15
window 15
and 15
nearly 15
died 15
of 15
fright 15
my 15
screams 15
brought 15
atticus 15
from 15
his 15
bathroom 15
halfshaven 15
the 15
worlds 15
endin 15
atticus 15
please 15
do 15
something 15
i 15
dragged 15
him 15
to 15
the 15
window 15
and 15
pointed 15
no 15
its 15
not 15
he 15
said 15
its 15
snowing 15
jem 15
asked 15
atticus 15
would 15
it 15
keep 15
up 15
jem 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
snow 15
either 15
but 15
he 15
knew 15
what 15
it 15
was 15
atticus 15
said 15
he 15
didnt 15
know 15
any 15
more 15
about 15
snow 15
than 15
jem 15
did 15
i 15
think 15
though 15
if 15
its 15
watery 15
like 15
that 15
itll 15
turn 15
to 15
rain 15
the 15
telephone 15
rang 15
and 15
atticus 15
left 15
the 15
breakfast 15
table 15
to 15
answer 15
it 15
that 15
was 15
eula 15
may 15
he 15
said 15
when 15
he 15
returned 15
i 15
quote 15
as 15
it 15
has 15
not 15
snowed 15
in 15
maycomb 15
county 15
since 15
there 15
will 15
be 15
no 15
school 15
today 15
eula 15
may 15
was 15
maycombs 15
leading 15
telephone 15
operator 15
she 15
was 15
entrusted 15
with 15
issuing 15
public 15
announcements 15
wedding 15
invitations 15
setting 15
off 15
the 15
fire 15
siren 15
and 15
giving 15
firstaid 15
instructions 15
when 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
was 15
away 15
when 15
atticus 15
finally 15
called 15
us 15
to 15
order 15
and 15
bade 15
us 15
look 15
at 15
our 15
plates 15
instead 15
of 15
out 15
the 15
windows 15
jem 15
asked 15
how 15
do 15
you 15
make 15
a 15
snowman 15
i 15
havent 15
the 15
slightest 15
idea 15
said 15
atticus 15
i 15
dont 15
want 15
you 15
all 15
to 15
be 15
disappointed 15
but 15
i 15
doubt 15
if 15
therell 15
be 15
enough 15
snow 15
for 15
a 15
snowball 15
even 15
calpurnia 15
came 15
in 15
and 15
said 15
she 15
thought 15
it 15
was 15
sticking 15
when 15
we 15
ran 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
it 15
was 15
covered 15
with 15
a 15
feeble 15
layer 15
of 15
soggy 15
snow 15
we 15
shouldnt 15
walk 15
about 15
in 15

said 15
jem 15
look 15

i 15
looked 15
back 15
at 15
my 15
mushy 15
footprints 15
jem 15
said 15
if 15
we 15
waited 15
until 15
it 15
snowed 15
some 15
more 15
we 15
could 15
scrape 15
it 15
all 15
up 15
for 15
a 15
snowman 15
i 15
stuck 15
out 15
my 15
tongue 15
and 15
caught 15
a 15
fat 15
flake 15
it 15
burned 15
jem 15
its 15
hot 15
no 15
it 15

what 15
we 15
can 15
go 15
walk 15
over 15
at 15
miss 15
maudies 15
jem 15
hopped 15
across 15
the 15
front 15
yard 15
i 15
followed 15
in 15
his 15
tracks 15
when 15
we 15
were 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
miss 15
maudies 15
mr 15
avery 15
accosted 15
us 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
pink 15

and 15
a 15
big 15
stomach 15
below 15

how 15
hopefully 15
we 15
had 15
watched 15
last 15
summer 15
for 15
him 15
to 15
repeat 15
his 15
performance 15
and 15
reflected 15
that 15
if 15
this 15
was 15
our 15
reward 15
there 15
was 15
something 15
to 15

atticus 15
strolled 15
over 15
to 15
miss 15
maudies 15
sidewalk 15
where 15
they 15
engaged 15
in 15
an 15
armwaving 15
conversation 15
the 15
only 15
phrase 15
of 15

by 15
nightfall 15

calpurnia 15

we 15
were 15
cold 15
when 15
atticus 15
came 15
home 15
that 15
evening 15
he 15
said 15
we 15
were 15
in 15
for 15
it 15
and 15
asked 15
calpurnia 15
if 15
she 15
wanted 15
to 15
stay 15
with 15
us 15
for 15
the 15

up 15
at 15
the 15

that 15
it 15

the 15
coldest 15

and 15
that 15

i 15
slid 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
miss 15
maudie 15
was 15
staring 15
at 15
the 15
smoking 15
black 15
hole 15
in 15
her 15
yard 15
and 15

holding 15
onto 15
our 15
shoulders 15
to 15
cross 15

shuddered 15
when 15
atticus 15
started 15
a 15
fire 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
stove 15
as 15
we 15
drank 15
our 15
cocoa 15
i 15
noticed 15
atticus 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
first 15
with 15
curiosity 15
then 15
with 15
sternness 15

a 15
brown 15
woolen 15
blanket 15

began 15
pouring 15
out 15
our 15

total 15
disregard 15

big 15
for 15

childish 15
things 15

sooner 15

i 15
went 15
so 15
far 15
as 15
to 15
pay 15
a 15
nickel 15
for 15
the 15
privilege 15
of 15

my 15
head 15
against 15
the 15
head 15
of 15

still 15
atticus 15

some 15
high 15

do 15
much 15
about 15
defending 15

to 15
trial 15
until 15
summer 15
session 15
john 15
taylor 15
was 15
kind 15
enough 15
to 15
give 15
us 15
a 15
postponement 15
if 15
you 15
shouldnt 15
be 15
defendin 15
him 15
then 15
why 15
are 15
you 15
doin 15
it 15
for 15
a 15
number 15
of 15
reasons 15
said 15
atticus 15
the 15
main 15
one 15
is 15
if 15
i 15
didnt 15
i 15
couldnt 15
hold 15
up 15
my 15
head 15
in 15
town 15
i 15
couldnt 15
represent 15
this 15
county 15
in 15
the 15
legislature 15
i 15
couldnt 15
even 15
tell 15
you 15
or 15
jem 15
not 15
to 15
do 15
something 15
again 15
you 15
mean 15
if 15
you 15
didnt 15
defend 15
that 15
man 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
wouldnt 15
have 15
to 15
mind 15
you 15
any 15
more 15
thats 15
about 15
right 15
why 15
because 15
i 15
could 15
never 15
ask 15
you 15
to 15
mind 15
me 15
again 15
scout 15
simply 15
by 15
the 15
nature 15
of 15
the 15
work 15
every 15
lawyer 15
gets 15
at 15
least 15
one 15
case 15
in 15
his 15
lifetime 15
that 15
affects 15
him 15
personally 15
this 15
ones 15
mine 15
i 15
guess 15
you 15
might 15
hear 15
some 15
ugly 15
talk 15
about 15
it 15
at 15
school 15
but 15
do 15
one 15
thing 15
for 15
me 15
if 15
you 15
will 15
you 15
just 15
hold 15
your 15
head 15
high 15
and 15
keep 15
those 15
fists 15
down 15
no 15
matter 15
what 15
anybody 15
says 15
to 15
you 15
dont 15
you 15
let 15
em 15
get 15
your 15
goat 15
try 15
fighting 15
with 15
your 15
head 15
for 15
a 15
change 15
its 15
a 15
good 15
one 15
even 15
if 15
it 15
does 15
resist 15
learning 15
atticus 15
are 15
we 15
going 15
to 15
win 15
it 15
no 15
honey 15
then 15
why 15
simply 15
because 15
we 15
were 15
licked 15
a 15
hundred 15
years 15
before 15
we 15
started 15
is 15
no 15
reason 15
for 15
us 15
not 15
to 15
try 15
to 15
win 15
atticus 15
said 15

like 15

he 15

once 15
a 15
year 15
atticus 15
jem 15

i 15

him 15

i 15
would 15
have 15
to 15
kiss 15
him 15
it 15
was 15
horrible 15
jem 15
and 15

listen 15
respectfully 15
to 15
atticus 15
and 15
cousin 15

rehash 15
the 15
war 15

atticus 15

crawled 15
into 15
his 15
lap 15
and 15
tucked 15
my 15
head 15
under 15
his 15
chin 15
he 15
put 15
his 15
arms 15
around 15
me 15
and 15
rocked 15
me 15
gently 15
its 15
different 15
this 15
time 15
he 15
said 15
this 15
time 15

yankees 15
were 15
fighting 15
our 15
friends 15
but 15

this 15
no 15
matter 15
how 15
bitter 15
things 15
get 15
theyre 15
still 15
our 15
friends 15
and 15
this 15
is 15
still 15
our 15
home 15
with 15
this 15
in 15
mind 15
i 15
faced 15
cecil 15
jacobs 15
in 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
next 15
day 15
you 15
gonna 15
take 15
that 15
back 15
boy 15
you 15
gotta 15
make 15
me 15
first 15
he 15
yelled 15
my 15
folks 15
said 15
your 15
daddy 15
was 15
a 15
disgrace 15
an 15
that 15
nigger 15
oughta 15
hang 15
from 15
the 15
watertank 15
i 15
drew 15
a 15
bead 15
on 15
him 15
remembered 15
what 15
atticus 15
had 15
said 15
then 15
dropped 15
my 15
fists 15
and 15
walked 15
away 15
scouts 15
a 15
cow 15
ward 15
ringing 15
in 15
my 15
ears 15
it 15
was 15
the 15
first 15
time 15
i 15
ever 15
walked 15
away 15
from 15
a 15
fight 15
somehow 15
if 15
i 15
fought 15
cecil 15
i 15
would 15
let 15
atticus 15
down 15
atticus 15
so 15
rarely 15
asked 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
to 15
do 15
something 15
for 15
him 15
i 15
could 15
take 15
being 15
called 15
a 15
coward 15
for 15
him 15
i 15
felt 15
extremely 15
noble 15
for 15
having 15
remembered 15
and 15
remained 15
noble 15
for 15
three 15
weeks 15
then 15
christmas 15
came 15
and 15
disaster 15
struck 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
viewed 15
christmas 15
with 15
mixed 15
feelings 15
the 15
good 15
side 15
was 15
the 15
tree 15
and 15
uncle 15
jack 15
finch 15
every 15
christmas 15
eve 15
day 15
we 15
met 15
uncle 15
jack 15
at 15
maycomb 15
junction 15
and 15
he 15
would 15
spend 15
a 15
week 15
with 15
us 15
a 15
flip 15
of 15
the 15
coin 15
revealed 15
the 15
uncompromising 15
lineaments 15
of 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
and 15
francis 15
i 15
suppose 15
i 15
should 15
include 15
uncle 15
jimmy 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
husband 15
but 15
as 15
he 15
never 15
spoke 15
a 15
word 15
to 15
me 15
in 15
my 15
life 15
except 15
to 15
say 15
get 15
off 15
the 15
fence 15
once 15
i 15
never 15
saw 15
any 15
reason 15
to 15
take 15
notice 15
of 15
him 15
neither 15
did 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
long 15
ago 15
in 15
a 15
burst 15
of 15
friendliness 15
aunty 15
and 15
uncle 15
jimmy 15
produced 15
a 15
son 15
named 15
henry 15
who 15
left 15
home 15
as 15
soon 15
as 15
was 15
humanly 15
possible 15
married 15
and 15
produced 15
francis 15
henry 15
and 15
his 15
wife 15
deposited 15
francis 15
at 15
his 15
grandparents 15
every 15
christmas 15
then 15
pursued 15
their 15
own 15
pleasures 15
no 15
amount 15
of 15
sighing 15
could 15
induce 15
atticus 15
to 15
let 15
us 15
spend 15
christmas 15
day 15
at 15
home 15
we 15
went 15
to 15
finchs 15
landing 15
every 15
christmas 15
in 15
my 15
memory 15
the 15
fact 15
that 15
aunty 15
was 15
a 15
good 15
cook 15
was 15
some 15
compensation 15
for 15
being 15
forced 15
to 15
spend 15
a 15
religious 15
holiday 15
with 15
francis 15
hancock 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
year 15
older 15
than 15
i 15
and 15
i 15
avoided 15
him 15
on 15
principle 15
he 15
enjoyed 15
everything 15
i 15
disapproved 15
of 15
and 15
disliked 15
my 15
ingenuous 15
diversions 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
atticuss 15
sister 15
but 15
when 15
jem 15
told 15
me 15
about 15
changelings 15
and 15
siblings 15
i 15
decided 15
that 15
she 15
had 15
been 15
swapped 15
at 15
birth 15
that 15
my 15
grandparents 15
had 15
perhaps 15
received 15
a 15
crawford 15
instead 15
of 15
a 15
finch 15
had 15
i 15
ever 15
harbored 15
the 15
mystical 15
notions 15
about 15
mountains 15
that 15
seem 15
to 15
obsess 15
lawyers 15
and 15
judges 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
would 15
have 15
been 15
analogous 15
to 15
mount 15
everest 15
throughout 15
my 15
early 15
life 15
she 15
was 15
cold 15
and 15
there 15
when 15
uncle 15
jack 15
jumped 15
down 15
from 15
the 15
train 15
christmas 15
eve 15
day 15
we 15
had 15
to 15
wait 15
for 15
the 15
porter 15
to 15
hand 15
him 15
two 15
long 15
packages 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
always 15
thought 15
it 15
funny 15
when 15
uncle 15
jack 15
pecked 15
atticus 15
on 15
the 15
cheek 15
they 15
were 15
the 15
only 15
two 15
men 15
we 15
ever 15
saw 15
kiss 15
each 15
other 15
uncle 15
jack 15
shook 15
hands 15
with 15
jem 15
and 15
swung 15
me 15
high 15
but 15
not 15
high 15
enough 15
uncle 15
jack 15
was 15
a 15
head 15
shorter 15
than 15
atticus 15
the 15
baby 15
of 15
the 15
family 15
he 15
was 15
younger 15
than 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
he 15
and 15
aunty 15
looked 15
alike 15
but 15
uncle 15
jack 15
made 15
better 15
use 15
of 15
his 15
face 15
we 15
were 15
never 15
wary 15
of 15
his 15
sharp 15
nose 15
and 15
chin 15
he 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
few 15
men 15
of 15
science 15
who 15
never 15
terrified 15
me 15
probably 15
because 15
he 15
never 15
behaved 15
like 15
a 15
doctor 15
whenever 15
he 15
performed 15
a 15
minor 15
service 15
for 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
as 15
removing 15
a 15
splinter 15
from 15
a 15
foot 15
he 15
would 15
tell 15
us 15
exactly 15
what 15
he 15
was 15
going 15
to 15
do 15
give 15
us 15
an 15
estimation 15
of 15
how 15
much 15
it 15
would 15
hurt 15
and 15
explain 15
the 15
use 15
of 15
any 15
tongs 15
he 15
employed 15
one 15
christmas 15
i 15
lurked 15
in 15
corners 15
nursing 15
a 15
twisted 15
splinter 15
in 15
my 15
foot 15
permitting 15
no 15
one 15
to 15
come 15
near 15
me 15
when 15
uncle 15
jack 15
caught 15
me 15
he 15
kept 15
me 15
laughing 15
about 15
a 15
preacher 15
who 15
hated 15
going 15
to 15
church 15
so 15
much 15
that 15
every 15
day 15
he 15
stood 15
at 15
his 15
gate 15
in 15
his 15
dressinggown 15
smoking 15
a 15
hookah 15
and 15
delivering 15
fiveminute 15
sermons 15
to 15
any 15
passersby 15
who 15
desired 15
spiritual 15
comfort 15
i 15
interrupted 15
to 15
make 15
uncle 15
jack 15
let 15
me 15
know 15
when 15
he 15
would 15
pull 15
it 15
out 15
but 15
he 15
held 15
up 15
a 15
bloody 15
splinter 15
in 15
a 15
pair 15
of 15
tweezers 15
and 15
said 15
he 15
yanked 15
it 15
while 15
i 15
was 15
laughing 15
that 15
was 15
what 15
was 15
known 15
as 15
relativity 15
whats 15
in 15
those 15
packages 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
pointing 15
to 15
the 15
long 15
thin 15
parcels 15
the 15
porter 15
had 15
given 15
him 15
none 15
of 15
your 15
business 15
he 15
said 15
jem 15
said 15
hows 15
rose 15
aylmer 15
rose 15
aylmer 15
was 15
uncle 15
jacks 15
cat 15
she 15

nothing 15
i 15
was 15
proceeding 15
on 15
the 15
dim 15
theory 15
aside 15
from 15
the 15
innate 15
attractiveness 15
of 15
such 15
words 15
that 15
if 15
atticus 15

atticus 15

bowed 15
to 15
the 15
inevitable 15
it 15
took 15
atticuss 15
courtroom 15
voice 15
to 15
drag 15
us 15
away 15
from 15
the 15

declined 15
to 15

take 15
our 15
air 15
rifles 15
to 15
the 15
landing 15
i 15

already 15
begun 15
to 15
think 15
of 15
shooting 15

them 15
away 15
from 15
us 15
for 15
good 15
finchs 15
landing 15
consisted 15
of 15
three 15
hundred 15
and 15
sixtysix 15
steps 15
down 15
a 15
high 15
bluff 15
and 15
ending 15
in 15
a 15
jetty 15
farther 15
down 15
stream 15
beyond 15
the 15
bluff 15
were 15
traces 15
of 15
an 15
old 15
cotton 15
landing 15
where 15
finch 15
negroes 15
had 15
loaded 15
bales 15
and 15
produce 15
unloaded 15
blocks 15
of 15
ice 15
flour 15
and 15
sugar 15
farm 15
equipment 15
and 15
feminine 15
apparel 15
a 15
tworut 15
road 15
ran 15
from 15
the 15
riverside 15
and 15
vanished 15
among 15
dark 15
trees 15
at 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
road 15
was 15
a 15
twostoried 15
white 15
house 15
with 15
porches 15
circling 15
it 15
upstairs 15
and 15
downstairs 15
in 15
his 15
old 15
age 15
our 15
ancestor 15
simon 15
finch 15
had 15
built 15
it 15
to 15
please 15
his 15
nagging 15
wife 15
but 15
with 15
the 15
porches 15
all 15
resemblance 15
to 15
ordinary 15
houses 15
of 15
its 15
era 15
ended 15
the 15
internal 15
arrangements 15
of 15
the 15
finch 15
house 15
were 15
indicative 15
of 15
simons 15
guilelessness 15
and 15
the 15
absolute 15
trust 15
with 15
which 15
he 15
regarded 15
his 15
offspring 15
there 15
were 15
six 15
bedrooms 15
upstairs 15
four 15
for 15
the 15
eight 15
female 15
children 15
one 15
for 15
welcome 15
finch 15
the 15
sole 15
son 15
and 15
one 15
for 15
visiting 15
relatives 15
simple 15
enough 15
but 15
the 15
daughters 15
rooms 15
could 15
be 15
reached 15
only 15
by 15
one 15
staircase 15
welcomes 15
room 15
and 15
the 15
guestroom 15
only 15
by 15
another 15
the 15
daughters 15
staircase 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
groundfloor 15
bedroom 15
of 15
their 15
parents 15
so 15
simon 15
always 15
knew 15
the 15
hours 15
of 15
his 15
daughters 15
nocturnal 15
comings 15
and 15
goings 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
kitchen 15
separate 15
from 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
tacked 15
onto 15
it 15
by 15
a 15
wooden 15
catwalk 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
was 15
a 15
rusty 15
bell 15
on 15
a 15
pole 15
used 15
to 15
summon 15
field 15
hands 15
or 15
as 15
a 15
distress 15
signal 15
a 15
widows 15
walk 15
was 15
on 15
the 15
roof 15
but 15
no 15
widows 15
walked 15
there 15
from 15
it 15
simon 15
oversaw 15
his 15
overseer 15
watched 15
the 15
riverboats 15
and 15
gazed 15
into 15
the 15
lives 15
of 15
surrounding 15
landholders 15
there 15
went 15
with 15
the 15
house 15
the 15
usual 15
legend 15
about 15
the 15
yankees 15

trousseau 15
to 15
save 15
it 15
from 15
raiders 15
in 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
she 15
became 15
stuck 15
in 15
the 15
door 15
to 15
the 15
daughters 15
staircase 15
but 15
was 15
doused 15
with 15
water 15
and 15
finally 15
pushed 15
through 15
when 15
we 15
arrived 15
at 15
the 15
landing 15

gave 15
us 15
a 15
present 15
jem 15
felt 15
his 15
age 15
and 15
gravitated 15
to 15
the 15
adults 15
leaving 15
me 15
to 15
entertain 15
our 15

of 15
kneepants 15

red 15

itll 15
drive 15
him 15
nuts 15
talking 15
to 15
francis 15
gave 15
me 15
the 15
sensation 15
of 15
settling 15
slowly 15
to 15
the 15
bottom 15
of 15
the 15
ocean 15
he 15
was 15
the 15
most 15
boring 15
child 15
i 15
ever 15
met 15
as 15
he 15
lived 15
in 15
mobile 15
he 15
could 15
not 15
inform 15
on 15
me 15
to 15
school 15
authorities 15
but 15
he 15
managed 15
to 15
tell 15
everything 15
he 15
knew 15
to 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
who 15
in 15
turn 15
unburdened 15
herself 15
to 15
atticus 15
who 15
either 15
forgot 15
it 15
or 15
gave 15
me 15
hell 15
whichever 15
struck 15
his 15
fancy 15
but 15
the 15
only 15
time 15
i 15
ever 15
heard 15
atticus 15
speak 15
sharply 15
to 15
anyone 15
was 15
when 15
i 15
once 15
heard 15
him 15
say 15
sister 15
i 15
do 15
the 15
best 15
i 15
can 15
with 15
them 15
it 15
had 15
something 15
to 15
do 15
with 15
my 15
going 15
around 15
in 15
overalls 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
fanatical 15
on 15
the 15
subject 15
of 15
my 15
attire 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
possibly 15
hope 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
lady 15
if 15
i 15
wore 15
breeches 15
when 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
could 15
do 15
nothing 15
in 15
a 15
dress 15
she 15
said 15
i 15
wasnt 15
supposed 15
to 15
be 15
doing 15
things 15
that 15
required 15
pants 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
vision 15
of 15
my 15
deportment 15
involved 15
playing 15
with 15
small 15
stoves 15
tea 15
sets 15
and 15
wearing 15
the 15
addapearl 15
necklace 15
she 15
gave 15
me 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
born 15
furthermore 15
i 15
should 15
be 15
a 15
ray 15
of 15
sunshine 15
in 15
my 15
fathers 15
lonely 15
life 15
i 15
suggested 15
that 15
one 15
could 15
be 15
a 15
ray 15
of 15
sunshine 15
in 15
pants 15
just 15
as 15
well 15
but 15
aunty 15
said 15
that 15
one 15
had 15
to 15
behave 15
like 15
a 15
sunbeam 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
born 15
good 15
but 15
had 15
grown 15
progressively 15
worse 15
every 15
year 15
she 15
hurt 15
my 15
feelings 15
and 15
set 15
my 15
teeth 15
permanently 15
on 15
edge 15
but 15
when 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
about 15
it 15
he 15
said 15
there 15
were 15
already 15
enough 15
sunbeams 15
in 15
the 15
family 15
and 15
to 15

on 15
about 15
my 15
business 15

mind 15
me 15
much 15
the 15
way 15
i 15
was 15
at 15

jem 15
and 15

me 15
long 15
after 15
jem 15
and 15
francis 15
graduated 15
to 15
the 15
big 15
table 15
i 15
often 15
wondered 15
what 15
she 15
thought 15
id 15
do 15
get 15
up 15
and 15
throw 15
something 15
i 15
sometimes 15
thought 15
of 15
asking 15
her 15
if 15
she 15
would 15
let 15
me 15
sit 15
at 15
the 15
big 15
table 15
with 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
them 15
just 15
once 15
i 15
would 15
prove 15
to 15
her 15
how 15
civilized 15
i 15
could 15
be 15
after 15
all 15

at 15
home 15
every 15
day 15
with 15
no 15
major 15
mishaps 15
when 15
i 15
begged 15
atticus 15
to 15
use 15
his 15
influence 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
had 15
none 15
we 15
were 15
guests 15
and 15
we 15
sat 15
where 15
she 15
told 15
us 15
to 15

he 15
also 15

kinds 15
of 15

modest 15
christmas 15
dinner 15

francis 15
wiping 15
his 15
tears 15
away 15
with 15
her 15
handkerchief 15
rubbing 15
his 15
hair 15

come 15
to 15
the 15
back 15

that 15
true 15
scout 15
said 15
uncle 15
jack 15
i 15
reckon 15
so 15
when 15
uncle 15
jack 15
looked 15
down 15
at 15
me 15
his 15
features 15
were 15
like 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
you 15
know 15
i 15
told 15
you 15
youd 15

whether 15

or 15
run 15
and 15
tarried 15
in 15
indecision 15
a 15
moment 15
too 15
long 15
i 15
turned 15
to 15
flee 15
but 15
uncle 15
jack 15
was 15
quicker 15
i 15
found 15
myself 15
suddenly 15
looking 15
at 15
a 15
tiny 15
ant 15
struggling 15
with 15
a 15
bread 15
crumb 15
in 15
the 15
grass 15
ill 15
never 15
speak 15

the 15
bathroom 15
while 15
he 15
cleaned 15
and 15
bandaged 15
my 15
knuckles 15
he 15
entertained 15
me 15
with 15
a 15
tale 15
about 15
a 15
funny 15
nearsighted 15
old 15
gentleman 15
who 15
had 15
a 15
cat 15
named 15
hodge 15
and 15
who 15
counted 15
all 15
the 15
cracks 15
in 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
when 15
he 15
went 15
to 15
town 15
there 15
now 15
he 15
said 15
youll 15
have 15
a 15
very 15
unladylike 15
scar 15
on 15
your 15
weddingring 15

a 15
whorelady 15
uncle 15
jack 15
plunged 15
into 15
another 15
long 15
tale 15
about 15
an 15
old 15
prime 15
minister 15
who 15
sat 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
of 15
commons 15
and 15
blew 15
feathers 15
in 15
the 15
air 15
and 15
tried 15
to 15
keep 15
them 15
there 15
when 15
all 15
about 15
him 15
men 15
were 15
losing 15
their 15
heads 15
i 15
guess 15
he 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
answer 15
my 15
question 15
but 15
he 15
made 15
no 15
sense 15
whatsoever 15
later 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
supposed 15
to 15
be 15
in 15
bed 15
i 15
went 15
down 15
the 15
hall 15
for 15
a 15
drink 15
of 15
water 15
and 15
heard 15
atticus 15
and 15
uncle 15
jack 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
i 15
shall 15
never 15
marry 15
atticus 15
why 15
i 15
might 15
have 15
children 15
atticus 15
said 15
youve 15
a 15
lot 15
to 15
learn 15
jack 15
i 15
know 15
your 15
daughter 15
gave 15
me 15
my 15
first 15
lessons 15
this 15
afternoon 15
she 15
said 15
i 15
didnt 15
understand 15
children 15
much 15
and 15
told 15
me 15
why 15
she 15
was 15
quite 15
right 15
atticus 15
she 15
told 15
me 15
how 15
i 15
should 15
have 15
treated 15
her 15
oh 15
dear 15
im 15
so 15
sorry 15
i 15
romped 15
on 15
her 15
atticus 15
chuckled 15
she 15
earned 15
it 15
so 15
dont 15
feel 15
too 15
remorseful 15
i 15
waited 15
on 15
tenterhooks 15
for 15
uncle 15
jack 15
to 15
tell 15
atticus 15
my 15
side 15
of 15
it 15
but 15
he 15
didnt 15
he 15
simply 15
murmured 15
her 15
use 15
of 15
bathroom 15
invective 15
leaves 15
nothing 15
to 15
the 15
imagination 15
but 15
she 15
doesnt 15
know 15
the 15
meaning 15
of 15
half 15
she 15
says 15
she 15
asked 15
me 15
what 15
a 15
whorelady 15
was 15
did 15
you 15
tell 15
her 15
no 15
i 15
told 15
her 15
about 15
lord 15
melbourne 15
jack 15
when 15
a 15
child 15
asks 15
you 15
something 15
answer 15
him 15
for 15
goodness 15
sake 15
but 15
dont 15
make 15
a 15
production 15
of 15
it 15
children 15
are 15
children 15
but 15
they 15
can 15
spot 15
an 15
evasion 15
quicker 15
than 15
adults 15
and 15
evasion 15
simply 15
muddles 15
em 15
no 15
my 15
father 15
mused 15
you 15
had 15
the 15
right 15
answer 15
this 15
afternoon 15
but 15
the 15
wrong 15
reasons 15
bad 15
language 15
is 15
a 15
stage 15
all 15
children 15
go 15
through 15
and 15
it 15
dies 15
with 15
time 15
when 15
they 15
learn 15
theyre 15
not 15
attracting 15
attention 15
with 15
it 15
hotheadedness 15
isnt 15
scouts 15
got 15
to 15

head 15
and 15
learn 15
soon 15
with 15
whats 15
in 15
store 15
for 15
her 15
these 15
next 15
few 15
months 15
shes 15
coming 15
along 15
though 15
jems 15
getting 15
older 15
and 15
she 15
follows 15
his 15
example 15
a 15
good 15
bit 15
now 15
all 15
she 15
needs 15
is 15
assistance 15
sometimes 15
atticus 15
youve 15
never 15
laid 15
a 15
hand 15
on 15
her 15
i 15
admit 15
that 15
so 15
far 15
ive 15
been 15
able 15
to 15
get 15
by 15
with 15
threats 15
jack 15
she 15
minds 15
me 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
she 15
can 15
doesnt 15
come 15
up 15
to 15
scratch 15
half 15
the 15
time 15
but 15
she 15
tries 15
thats 15
not 15
the 15
answer 15
said 15
uncle 15
jack 15
no 15
the 15
answer 15
is 15
she 15
knows 15
i 15
know 15
she 15
tries 15
thats 15
what 15
makes 15
the 15
difference 15
what 15
bothers 15
me 15
is 15
that 15
she 15
and 15
jem 15
will 15

to 15
absorb 15
some 15

her 15
prides 15
at 15
stake 15

to 15
break 15
his 15
promise 15
he 15
still 15
didnt 15
atticus 15
how 15
bad 15

this 15
going 15
to 15
be 15
you 15
havent 15
had 15
too 15
much 15
chance 15
to 15
discuss 15
it 15
it 15
couldnt 15
be 15
worse 15
jack 15
the 15
only 15
thing 15
weve 15
got 15
is 15
a 15
black 15
mans 15
word 15
against 15
the 15
ewells 15
the 15
evidence 15
boils 15
down 15
to 15
youdid 15
ididnt 15
the 15
jury 15
couldnt 15
possibly 15
be 15
expected 15
to 15
take 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
word 15
against 15
the 15
ewells 15

acquainted 15
with 15
the 15
ewells 15
uncle 15

he 15
remembered 15
them 15
he 15
described 15
them 15
to 15
atticus 15
but 15
atticus 15
said 15
youre 15
a 15
generation 15
off 15
the 15
present 15
ones 15
are 15
the 15
same 15
though 15
what 15
are 15
you 15
going 15
to 15
do 15
then 15
before 15
im 15
through 15
i 15
intend 15
to 15
jar 15
the 15
jury 15
a 15
bit 15
i 15
think 15
well 15
have 15
a 15
reasonable 15
chance 15
on 15
appeal 15
though 15
i 15
really 15
cant 15
tell 15
at 15
this 15
stage 15
jack 15
you 15
know 15
id 15
hoped 15
to 15
get 15
through 15
life 15
without 15
a 15
case 15
of 15
this 15
kind 15
but 15
john 15
taylor 15
pointed 15
at 15
me 15
and 15
said 15
youre 15
it 15
let 15
this 15
cup 15
pass 15
from 15
you 15
eh 15
right 15
but 15
do 15
you 15
think 15
i 15
could 15
face 15
my 15
children 15
otherwise 15
you 15
know 15
whats 15
going 15
to 15
happen 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
i 15
do 15
jack 15
and 15
i 15
hope 15
and 15
pray 15
i 15
can 15
get 15
jem 15
and 15
scout 15
through 15
it 15
without 15
bitterness 15
and 15
most 15
of 15
all 15
without 15
catching 15
maycombs 15
usual 15
disease 15
why 15
reasonable 15
people 15
go 15
stark 15
raving 15
mad 15
when 15
anything 15
involving 15
a 15
negro 15
comes 15
up 15
is 15
something 15
i 15
dont 15
pretend 15
to 15
understand 15
i 15
just 15
hope 15
that 15
jem 15
and 15
scout 15
come 15
to 15
me 15
for 15
their 15
answers 15
instead 15
of 15
listening 15
to 15
the 15
town 15
i 15
hope 15
they 15
trust 15
me 15
enough 15
jean 15
louise 15
my 15
scalp 15
jumped 15
i 15
stuck 15
my 15
head 15
around 15
the 15
corner 15
sir 15
go 15
to 15
bed 15
i 15
scurried 15
to 15
my 15
room 15
and 15
went 15
to 15
bed 15
uncle 15
jack 15
was 15
a 15
prince 15
of 15
a 15
fellow 15
not 15
to 15
let 15
me 15
down 15
but 15
i 15
never 15
figured 15
out 15
how 15
atticus 15
knew 15
i 15
was 15
listening 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
until 15
many 15
years 15
later 15
that 15
i 15
realized 15
he 15
wanted 15
me 15
to 15
hear 15
every 15
word 15
he 15
said 15
atticus 15
was 15
feeble 15
he 15
was 15
nearly 15
fifty 15
when 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
why 15
he 15
was 15
so 15
old 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
got 15
started 15
late 15
which 15
we 15
felt 15
reflected 15
upon 15
his 15
abilities 15
and 15
manliness 15
he 15
was 15
much 15
older 15
than 15
the 15
parents 15
of 15
our 15
school 15
contemporaries 15
and 15
there 15
was 15
nothing 15
jem 15
or 15
i 15
could 15
say 15
about 15
him 15
when 15
our 15
classmates 15
said 15
my 15
father 15
jem 15
was 15
football 15
crazy 15
atticus 15
was 15
never 15
too 15
tired 15
to 15
play 15
keepaway 15
but 15
when 15
jem 15
wanted 15
to 15
tackle 15
him 15
atticus 15
would 15
say 15
im 15
too 15
old 15
for 15
that 15
son 15
our 15
father 15
didnt 15
do 15
anything 15
he 15
worked 15
in 15
an 15
office 15
not 15
in 15
a 15
drugstore 15
atticus 15
did 15
not 15
drive 15
a 15
dumptruck 15
for 15
the 15
county 15
he 15
was 15
not 15
the 15
sheriff 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
farm 15
work 15
in 15
a 15
garage 15
or 15
do 15
anything 15
that 15
could 15
possibly 15
arouse 15
the 15
admiration 15
of 15
anyone 15
besides 15
that 15
he 15
wore 15
glasses 15
he 15
was 15
nearly 15
blind 15
in 15
his 15
left 15
eye 15
and 15
said 15
left 15
eyes 15
were 15
the 15
tribal 15
curse 15
of 15
the 15
finches 15
whenever 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
see 15
something 15
well 15
he 15
turned 15
his 15
head 15
and 15
looked 15
from 15
his 15
right 15
eye 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
do 15
the 15
things 15
our 15
schoolmates 15
fathers 15
did 15
he 15
never 15
went 15
hunting 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
play 15
poker 15
or 15
fish 15
or 15
drink 15
or 15
smoke 15
he 15
sat 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
and 15
read 15
with 15
these 15
attributes 15
however 15
he 15
would 15
not 15
remain 15
as 15
inconspicuous 15
as 15
we 15
wished 15
him 15
to 15
that 15
year 15
the 15
school 15
buzzed 15
with 15
talk 15
about 15
him 15
defending 15
tom 15
robinson 15
none 15
of 15
which 15
was 15
complimentary 15
after 15
my 15
bout 15
with 15
cecil 15
jacobs 15
when 15
i 15
committed 15
myself 15
to 15
a 15
policy 15
of 15
cowardice 15
word 15
got 15
around 15
that 15
scout 15
finch 15
wouldnt 15
fight 15
any 15
more 15
her 15
daddy 15
wouldnt 15
let 15
her 15
this 15
was 15
not 15
entirely 15
correct 15
i 15
wouldnt 15
fight 15
publicly 15
for 15
atticus 15
but 15
the 15
family 15
was 15
private 15
ground 15
i 15
would 15
fight 15
anyone 15
from 15
a 15
third 15
cousin 15
upwards 15
tooth 15
and 15
nail 15
francis 15
hancock 15
for 15
example 15
knew 15
that 15
when 15
he 15
gave 15
us 15
our 15
airrifles 15
atticus 15
wouldnt 15
teach 15
us 15
to 15
shoot 15
uncle 15
jack 15
instructed 15
us 15
in 15
the 15
rudiments 15
thereof 15
he 15
said 15
atticus 15
wasnt 15
interested 15
in 15
guns 15
atticus 15
said 15
to 15
jem 15

day 15
id 15

you 15
shot 15

you 15
want 15
if 15
you 15

hit 15
em 15

remember 15
its 15
a 15
sin 15
to 15
kill 15
a 15
mockingbird 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
time 15

ever 15
heard 15
atticus 15
say 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
sin 15
to 15
do 15
something 15

asked 15
miss 15
maudie 15

their 15
hearts 15
out 15
for 15
us 15

breastworks 15
at 15

atticus 15
you 15

a 15
devil 15
from 15

calpurnia 15
on 15
the 15

she 15
said 15
jem 15
underlined 15
it 15
when 15
he 15
asked 15
atticus 15
if 15
he 15
was 15
going 15
out 15
for 15
the 15
methodists 15
and 15
atticus 15
said 15
hed 15
break 15
his 15
neck 15
if 15
he 15
did 15
he 15
was 15
just 15
too 15
old 15
for 15
that 15
sort 15
of 15
thing 15
the 15

touch 15

he 15
was 15
unable 15
to 15
resist 15
football 15
in 15
any 15
form 15
and 15
he 15
stood 15
gloomily 15
on 15
the 15
sidelines 15
with 15
atticus 15
and 15
me 15
watching 15

is 15
more 15
deadly 15
than 15
a 15
deserted 15
waiting 15

he 15
was 15
not 15
playing 15

sniffing 15
at 15
foliage 15
he 15
seemed 15
dedicated 15
to 15
one 15
course 15
and 15
motivated 15
by 15
an 15
invisible 15
force 15
that 15
was 15
inching 15
him 15
toward 15
us 15
we 15

what 15

to 15
consider 15
which 15

middle 15
of 15
the 15
street 15
he 15
walked 15
quickly 15
but 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
moved 15
like 15
an 15
underwater 15
swimmer 15
time 15
had 15
slowed 15
to 15
a 15
nauseating 15
crawl 15
when 15
atticus 15
raised 15
his 15
glasses 15
calpurnia 15
murmured 15
sweet 15
jesus 15
help 15
him 15
and 15
put 15
her 15
hands 15
to 15

cheeks 15
atticus 15
pushed 15
his 15
glasses 15
to 15
his 15
forehead 15
they 15
slipped 15
down 15
and 15
he 15
dropped 15
them 15
in 15
the 15
street 15
in 15
the 15
silence 15
i 15
heard 15

crack 15
atticus 15
rubbed 15
his 15
eyes 15
and 15
chin 15
we 15
saw 15
him 15
blink 15
hard 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
gate 15
tim 15

made 15
up 15
what 15

left 15
of 15
his 15
mind 15
he 15
had 15
finally 15
turned 15
himself 15
around 15
to 15
pursue 15
his 15
original 15
course 15
up 15
our 15
street 15
he 15
made 15
two 15
steps 15
forward 15
then 15
stopped 15
and 15
raised 15
his 15
head 15
we 15
saw 15
his 15
body 15

with 15
movements 15

ol 15
oneshot 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
boy 15
why 15
down 15
at 15
the 15
landing 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
coming 15
up 15
if 15
he 15
shot 15
fifteen 15
times 15
and 15
hit 15
fourteen 15
doves 15
hed 15
complain 15
about 15
wasting 15
ammunition 15
he 15
never 15
said 15
anything 15
about 15
that 15
jem 15
muttered 15
never 15
said 15
anything 15
about 15
it 15
did 15

miss 15
maudie 15
if 15
your 15

from 15
playing 15
the 15
piano 15

think 15
maybe 15
he 15
put 15
his 15
gun 15
down 15
when 15
he 15
realized 15
that 15
god 15
had 15
given 15
him 15
an 15
unfair 15
advantage 15
over 15
most 15
living 15
things 15
i 15
guess 15
he 15
decided 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
shoot 15
till 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
and 15
he 15
had 15
to 15

gentleman 15

me 15
when 15

small 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
confined 15
our 15
activities 15
to 15
the 15
southern 15
neighborhood 15
but 15
when 15
i 15

well 15
into 15
the 15
second 15
grade 15
at 15
school 15

of 15
maycomb 15

us 15
frequently 15
up 15
the 15
street 15
past 15
the 15
real 15
property 15
of 15
mrs 15
henry 15
lafayette 15
dubose 15
it 15
was 15
impossible 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
town 15
without 15
passing 15
her 15
house 15
unless 15
we 15
wished 15
to 15
walk 15
a 15
mile 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
way 15
previous 15
minor 15
encounters 15
with 15
her 15
left 15
me 15
with 15
no 15
desire 15
for 15
more 15
but 15
jem 15
said 15
i 15
had 15
to 15
grow 15
up 15
some 15
time 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
lived 15
alone 15
except 15
for 15
a 15
negro 15
girl 15
in 15
constant 15
attendance 15
two 15
doors 15
up 15
the 15
street 15
from 15
us 15
in 15
a 15
house 15
with 15
steep 15
front 15
steps 15
and 15
a 15
dogtrot 15
hall 15
she 15
was 15
very 15
old 15
she 15
spent 15
most 15
of 15
each 15
day 15
in 15
bed 15
and 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
it 15
in 15
a 15
wheelchair 15
it 15
was 15
rumored 15
that 15
she 15
kept 15
a 15
csa 15
pistol 15
concealed 15
among 15
her 15
numerous 15
shawls 15
and 15
wraps 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
hated 15
her 15
if 15
she 15
was 15
on 15
the 15
porch 15
when 15
we 15
passed 15
we 15
would 15
be 15
raked 15
by 15
her 15
wrathful 15
gaze 15
subjected 15
to 15
ruthless 15
interrogation 15
regarding 15
our 15
behavior 15
and 15
given 15
a 15
melancholy 15
prediction 15
on 15
what 15
we 15
would 15
amount 15
to 15
when 15
we 15
grew 15
up 15
which 15
was 15
always 15
nothing 15
we 15
had 15
long 15
ago 15
given 15
up 15
the 15
idea 15
of 15
walking 15
past 15
her 15
house 15
on 15
the 15
opposite 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
street 15
that 15
only 15
made 15
her 15
raise 15
her 15
voice 15
and 15
let 15
the 15
whole 15
neighborhood 15
in 15
on 15
it 15
we 15
could 15
do 15
nothing 15
to 15
please 15
her 15
if 15
i 15
said 15
as 15
sunnily 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
hey 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
i 15
would 15
receive 15
for 15
an 15
answer 15
dont 15
you 15
say 15
hey 15
to 15
me 15
you 15
ugly 15
girl 15
you 15
say 15
good 15
afternoon 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
she 15
was 15
vicious 15
once 15
she 15
heard 15
jem 15
refer 15
to 15
our 15
father 15
as 15
atticus 15
and 15
her 15
reaction 15
was 15
apoplectic 15
besides 15
being 15
the 15
sassiest 15
most 15
disrespectful 15
mutts 15
who 15
ever 15
passed 15
her 15
way 15
we 15
were 15
told 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
quite 15
a 15
pity 15
our 15
father 15
had 15
not 15
remarried 15
after 15
our 15
mothers 15
death 15
a 15
lovelier 15
lady 15
than 15
our 15
mother 15
never 15
lived 15
she 15
said 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
heartbreaking 15
the 15
way 15
atticus 15
finch 15
let 15
her 15
children 15
run 15
wild 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
remember 15
our 15
mother 15
but 15
jem 15
did 15
he 15
would 15
tell 15
me 15
about 15
her 15
sometimes 15
and 15
he 15
went 15
livid 15
when 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
shot 15
us 15
this 15
message 15
jem 15
having 15
survived 15
boo 15
radley 15
a 15
mad 15
dog 15
and 15
other 15
terrors 15
had 15
concluded 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
cowardly 15
to 15
stop 15
at 15
miss 15
rachels 15
front 15
steps 15
and 15
wait 15
and 15
had 15
decreed 15
that 15
we 15
must 15
run 15
as 15
far 15
as 15
the 15
post 15
office 15
corner 15
each 15
evening 15
to 15
meet 15
atticus 15
coming 15
from 15
work 15
countless 15
evenings 15
atticus 15
would 15
find 15
jem 15
furious 15
at 15
something 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
had 15
said 15
when 15
we 15
went 15
by 15
easy 15
does 15
it 15
son 15
atticus 15
would 15
say 15
shes 15
an 15
old 15
lady 15
and 15
shes 15
ill 15
you 15
just 15
hold 15
your 15
head 15
high 15
and 15
be 15
a 15
gentleman 15
whatever 15
she 15
says 15
to 15
you 15
its 15
your 15
job 15
not 15
to 15
let 15
her 15
make 15
you 15
mad 15
jem 15
would 15
say 15
she 15
must 15
not 15
be 15
very 15
sick 15
she 15
hollered 15
so 15
when 15
the 15
three 15
of 15
us 15
came 15
to 15
her 15
house 15
atticus 15
would 15
sweep 15
off 15
his 15
hat 15
wave 15
gallantly 15
to 15
her 15
and 15
say 15
good 15
evening 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
you 15
look 15
like 15
a 15
picture 15
this 15
evening 15
i 15
never 15
heard 15
atticus 15
say 15
like 15
a 15
picture 15
of 15
what 15
he 15
would 15
tell 15
her 15
the 15
courthouse 15
news 15
and 15
would 15
say 15
he 15
hoped 15
with 15
all 15
his 15
heart 15
shed 15
have 15
a 15
good 15
day 15
tomorrow 15
he 15
would 15
return 15
his 15
hat 15
to 15
his 15
head 15
swing 15
me 15
to 15
his 15
shoulders 15
in 15
her 15
very 15
presence 15
and 15
we 15
would 15
go 15
home 15
in 15
the 15
twilight 15
it 15
was 15
times 15
like 15
these 15
when 15
i 15
thought 15
my 15
father 15
who 15
hated 15
guns 15
and 15
had 15
never 15
been 15
to 15
any 15
wars 15
was 15
the 15
bravest 15
man 15
who 15
ever 15
lived 15
the 15
day 15
after 15
jems 15
twelfth 15
birthday 15
his 15
money 15
was 15
burning 15
up 15
his 15
pockets 15
so 15
we 15
headed 15
for 15
town 15
in 15
the 15
early 15
afternoon 15
jem 15
thought 15
he 15
had 15
enough 15
to 15
buy 15
a 15
miniature 15
steam 15
engine 15
for 15
himself 15
and 15
a 15
twirling 15
baton 15
for 15
me 15
i 15
had 15
long 15
had 15
my 15
eye 15
on 15
that 15
baton 15
it 15
was 15
at 15
v 15
j 15
elmores 15
it 15
was 15
bedecked 15
with 15
sequins 15
and 15
tinsel 15
it 15
cost 15
seventeen 15
cents 15
it 15
was 15
then 15
my 15
burning 15
ambition 15
to 15
grow 15
up 15
and 15
twirl 15
with 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
high 15
school 15
band 15
having 15
developed 15
my 15
talent 15
to 15
where 15
i 15
could 15
throw 15
up 15
a 15
stick 15
and 15
almost 15
catch 15
it 15
coming 15
down 15
i 15
had 15
caused 15
calpurnia 15
to 15
deny 15
me 15
entrance 15
to 15
the 15
house 15
every 15
time 15
she 15
saw 15
me 15
with 15
a 15
stick 15
in 15
my 15
hand 15
i 15
felt 15
that 15
i 15
could 15
overcome 15
this 15
defect 15
with 15
a 15
real 15
baton 15
and 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
generous 15
of 15
jem 15
to 15
buy 15
one 15
for 15
me 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
was 15
stationed 15
on 15
her 15
porch 15
when 15
we 15
went 15
by 15
where 15
are 15
you 15
two 15
going 15
at 15
this 15
time 15
of 15
day 15
she 15
shouted 15
playing 15
hooky 15
i 15
suppose 15
ill 15
just 15
call 15
up 15
the 15
principal 15
and 15
tell 15
him 15
she 15
put 15
her 15
hands 15
on 15
the 15
wheels 15
of 15
her 15
chair 15
and 15

north 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
square 15

your 15

high 15
and 15

a 15
gentleman 15

mrs 15
dubose 15
held 15
us 15
not 15
only 15
a 15
finch 15
waiting 15
on 15
tables 15
but 15
one 15
in 15
the 15
courthouse 15
lawing 15
for 15
niggers 15
jem 15
stiffened 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
shot 15
had 15
gone 15
home 15
and 15
she 15
knew 15
it 15
yes 15
indeed 15
what 15
has 15
this 15
world 15
come 15
to 15
when 15
a 15
finch 15
goes 15
against 15
his 15
raising 15
ill 15
tell 15
you 15
she 15
put 15
her 15
hand 15
to 15
her 15
mouth 15
when 15
she 15
drew 15
it 15
away 15
it 15
trailed 15
a 15
long 15
silver 15
thread 15
of 15
saliva 15
your 15
fathers 15
no 15
better 15
than 15
the 15
niggers 15
and 15
trash 15
he 15
works 15
for 15
jem 15
was 15
scarlet 15
i 15
pulled 15
at 15
his 15
sleeve 15
and 15
we 15
were 15
followed 15
up 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
by 15
a 15
philippic 15
on 15
our 15
familys 15
moral 15
degeneration 15
the 15
major 15
premise 15
of 15
which 15
was 15
that 15
half 15
the 15
finches 15
were 15
in 15
the 15
asylum 15
anyway 15
but 15
if 15
our 15
mother 15
were 15
living 15
we 15
would 15
not 15
have 15
come 15
to 15
such 15
a 15
state 15
i 15
wasnt 15
sure 15
what 15
jem 15
resented 15
most 15
but 15
i 15
took 15
umbrage 15
at 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
assessment 15
of 15
the 15
familys 15
mental 15
hygiene 15
i 15
had 15
become 15
almost 15
accustomed 15
to 15
hearing 15
insults 15
aimed 15
at 15
atticus 15
but 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
first 15
one 15
coming 15
from 15
an 15
adult 15
except 15
for 15
her 15
remarks 15
about 15
atticus 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
attack 15
was 15
only 15
routine 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
hint 15
of 15
summer 15
in 15
the 15
air 15
in 15
the 15
shadows 15
it 15
was 15
cool 15
but 15
the 15
sun 15
was 15
warm 15
which 15
meant 15
good 15
times 15
coming 15
no 15
school 15
and 15
dill 15
jem 15
bought 15
his 15
steam 15
engine 15
and 15
we 15
went 15
by 15
elmores 15
for 15
my 15
baton 15
jem 15
took 15
no 15
pleasure 15
in 15
his 15
acquisition 15
he 15
jammed 15
it 15
in 15
his 15
pocket 15
and 15
walked 15
silently 15
beside 15
me 15
toward 15
home 15
on 15
the 15
way 15
home 15
i 15
nearly 15
hit 15
mr 15
link 15
deas 15
who 15
said 15
look 15
out 15
now 15
scout 15
when 15
i 15
missed 15
a 15
toss 15
and 15
when 15
we 15
approached 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
house 15
my 15
baton 15
was 15
grimy 15
from 15
having 15
picked 15
it 15
up 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
dirt 15
so 15
many 15
times 15
she 15
was 15
not 15
on 15
the 15
porch 15
in 15
later 15
years 15
i 15
sometimes 15
wondered 15
exactly 15
what 15
made 15
jem 15
do 15
it 15
what 15
made 15
him 15
break 15
the 15
bonds 15
of 15
you 15
just 15
be 15
a 15
gentleman 15
son 15
and 15
the 15
phase 15
of 15
selfconscious 15
rectitude 15
he 15
had 15
recently 15
entered 15
jem 15
had 15
probably 15
stood 15
as 15
much 15
guff 15
about 15
atticus 15
lawing 15
for 15
niggers 15
as 15
had 15
i 15
and 15
i 15
took 15
it 15
for 15
granted 15
that 15
he 15
kept 15
his 15
temper 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
naturally 15
tranquil 15
disposition 15
and 15
a 15
slow 15
fuse 15
at 15
the 15
time 15
however 15
i 15
thought 15
the 15
only 15
explanation 15
for 15
what 15
he 15
did 15
was 15
that 15
for 15
a 15
few 15
minutes 15
he 15
simply 15
went 15
mad 15
what 15
jem 15
did 15
was 15
something 15
id 15
do 15
as 15
a 15
matter 15
of 15
course 15
had 15
i 15
not 15
been 15
under 15
atticuss 15
interdict 15
which 15
i 15
assumed 15
included 15
not 15
fighting 15
horrible 15
old 15
ladies 15
we 15
had 15
just 15
come 15
to 15
her 15
gate 15
when 15
jem 15
snatched 15
my 15
baton 15
and 15
ran 15
flailing 15
wildly 15
up 15
the 15
steps 15
into 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
front 15
yard 15
forgetting 15
everything 15
atticus 15
had 15
said 15
forgetting 15
that 15
she 15
packed 15
a 15
pistol 15
under 15
her 15
shawls 15
forgetting 15
that 15
if 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
missed 15
her 15
girl 15
jessie 15
probably 15
wouldnt 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
begin 15
to 15
calm 15
down 15
until 15
he 15
had 15
cut 15
the 15
tops 15
off 15
every 15
camellia 15
bush 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
owned 15
until 15
the 15
ground 15
was 15
littered 15
with 15
green 15
buds 15
and 15
leaves 15
he 15
bent 15
my 15
baton 15
against 15
his 15
knee 15
snapped 15
it 15
in 15
two 15
and 15
threw 15
it 15
down 15
by 15
that 15
time 15
i 15
was 15
shrieking 15
jem 15
yanked 15
my 15
hair 15
said 15
he 15
didnt 15
care 15
hed 15
do 15
it 15
again 15
if 15
he 15
got 15
a 15
chance 15
and 15
if 15
i 15
didnt 15
shut 15
up 15
hed 15
pull 15
every 15
hair 15
out 15
of 15
my 15
head 15
i 15
didnt 15
shut 15
up 15
and 15
he 15
kicked 15
me 15
i 15
lost 15
my 15
balance 15
and 15
fell 15
on 15
my 15
face 15
jem 15
picked 15
me 15
up 15
roughly 15
but 15
looked 15
like 15
he 15
was 15
sorry 15
there 15
was 15
nothing 15
to 15
say 15
we 15
did 15
not 15
choose 15
to 15
meet 15
atticus 15
coming 15
home 15
that 15
evening 15
we 15
skulked 15
around 15
the 15
kitchen 15
until 15
calpurnia 15
threw 15
us 15
out 15
by 15
some 15
voodoo 15
system 15
calpurnia 15
seemed 15
to 15
know 15
all 15
about 15
it 15
she 15
was 15
a 15
less 15
than 15
satisfactory 15
source 15
of 15
palliation 15
but 15
she 15
did 15
give 15
jem 15
a 15
hot 15
biscuitandbutter 15
which 15
he 15
tore 15
in 15
half 15
and 15
shared 15
with 15
me 15
it 15
tasted 15
like 15
cotton 15
we 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
livingroom 15
i 15
picked 15
up 15
a 15
football 15
magazine 15
found 15
a 15
picture 15
of 15
dixie 15
howell 15
showed 15
it 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
said 15
this 15
looks 15
like 15
you 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
nicest 15
thing 15
i 15
could 15
think 15
to 15
say 15
to 15
him 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
no 15
help 15
he 15
sat 15
by 15
the 15
windows 15
hunched 15
down 15
in 15
a 15
rocking 15
chair 15
scowling 15
waiting 15
daylight 15
faded 15
two 15
geological 15
ages 15
later 15
we 15
heard 15
the 15
soles 15
of 15
atticuss 15
shoes 15
scrape 15
the 15
front 15
steps 15
the 15
screen 15
door 15
slammed 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
pause 15
atticus 15
was 15
at 15
the 15
hat 15
rack 15
in 15
the 15
hall 15
and 15
we 15
heard 15
him 15
call 15
jem 15
his 15
voice 15
was 15
like 15
the 15
winter 15
wind 15
atticus 15
switched 15
on 15
the 15
ceiling 15
light 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
and 15
found 15
us 15
there 15
frozen 15
still 15
he 15
carried 15
my 15
baton 15
in 15
one 15
hand 15
its 15
filthy 15
yellow 15
tassel 15
trailed 15
on 15
the 15
rug 15
he 15
held 15
out 15
his 15
other 15
hand 15
it 15
contained 15
fat 15
camellia 15
buds 15
jem 15
he 15
said 15
are 15
you 15
responsible 15
for 15
this 15
yes 15
sir 15
whyd 15
you 15
do 15
it 15
jem 15
said 15
softly 15
she 15
said 15
you 15
lawed 15
for 15
niggers 15
and 15
trash 15
you 15
did 15
this 15
because 15
she 15
said 15
that 15
jems 15
lips 15
moved 15
but 15
his 15
yes 15
sir 15
was 15
inaudible 15
son 15
i 15
have 15
no 15
doubt 15
that 15
youve 15
been 15
annoyed 15
by 15
your 15
contemporaries 15
about 15
me 15
lawing 15
for 15
niggers 15
as 15
you 15
say 15
but 15
to 15
do 15
something 15
like 15
this 15
to 15
a 15
sick 15
old 15
lady 15
is 15
inexcusable 15
i 15
strongly 15
advise 15
you 15
to 15
go 15
down 15
and 15
have 15
a 15
talk 15
with 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
said 15
atticus 15
come 15
straight 15
home 15
afterward 15
jem 15
did 15
not 15
move 15
go 15
on 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
followed 15
jem 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
livingroom 15
come 15
back 15
here 15
atticus 15
said 15
to 15
me 15
i 15
came 15
back 15
atticus 15
picked 15
up 15
the 15
mobile 15
press 15
and 15
sat 15
down 15
in 15
the 15
rocking 15
chair 15
jem 15
had 15
vacated 15
for 15
the 15
life 15
of 15
me 15
i 15
did 15
not 15
understand 15
how 15
he 15
could 15
sit 15
there 15
in 15
cold 15
blood 15
and 15
read 15
a 15
newspaper 15
when 15
his 15
only 15
son 15
stood 15
an 15
excellent 15
chance 15
of 15
being 15
murdered 15
with 15
a 15
confederate 15
army 15
relic 15
of 15
course 15
jem 15
antagonized 15
me 15
sometimes 15
until 15
i 15
could 15
kill 15
him 15
but 15
when 15
it 15
came 15
down 15
to 15
it 15
he 15
was 15
all 15
i 15
had 15
atticus 15
did 15
not 15
seem 15
to 15
realize 15
this 15
or 15
if 15
he 15
did 15
he 15
didnt 15
care 15
i 15
hated 15
him 15
for 15
that 15
but 15
when 15
you 15
are 15
in 15
trouble 15
you 15
become 15
easily 15
tired 15
soon 15
i 15
was 15
hiding 15
in 15
his 15
lap 15
and 15
his 15
arms 15
were 15
around 15
me 15
youre 15
mighty 15
big 15
to 15
be 15
rocked 15
he 15
said 15
you 15
dont 15
care 15
what 15
happens 15
to 15
him 15
i 15
said 15
you 15
just 15
send 15
him 15
on 15
to 15
get 15
shot 15
at 15
when 15
all 15
he 15
was 15
doin 15
was 15
standin 15
up 15
for 15
you 15
atticus 15
pushed 15
my 15
head 15
under 15
his 15
chin 15
its 15
not 15
time 15
to 15
worry 15
yet 15
he 15
said 15
i 15
never 15
thought 15
jemd 15
be 15
the 15
one 15
to 15
lose 15
his 15
head 15
over 15
this 15
thought 15
id 15
have 15
more 15
trouble 15
with 15
you 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
didnt 15
see 15
why 15
we 15
had 15
to 15
keep 15
our 15
heads 15
anyway 15
that 15
nobody 15
i 15
knew 15
at 15
school 15
had 15
to 15
keep 15
his 15
head 15
about 15
anything 15
scout 15
said 15
atticus 15
when 15
summer 15
comes 15
youll 15
have 15
to 15
keep 15
your 15
head 15
about 15
far 15
worse 15
things 15
its 15
not 15
fair 15
for 15
you 15
and 15
jem 15
i 15
know 15
that 15
but 15
sometimes 15
we 15
have 15
to 15
make 15
the 15
best 15
of 15
things 15
and 15
the 15
way 15
we 15
conduct 15
ourselves 15
when 15
the 15
chips 15
are 15
down 15
well 15
all 15
i 15
can 15
say 15
is 15
when 15
you 15
and 15
jem 15
are 15
grown 15
maybe 15
youll 15
look 15
back 15
on 15
this 15
with 15
some 15
compassion 15
and 15
some 15
feeling 15
that 15
i 15
didnt 15
let 15
you 15
down 15
this 15
case 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
case 15
is 15
something 15
that 15
goes 15
to 15
the 15
essence 15
of 15
a 15
mans 15
conscience 15
scout 15
i 15
couldnt 15
go 15
to 15
church 15
and 15
worship 15
god 15
if 15
i 15
didnt 15
try 15
to 15
help 15
that 15
man 15
atticus 15
you 15
must 15
be 15
wrong 15
hows 15
that 15
well 15
most 15
folks 15
seem 15
to 15
think 15
theyre 15
right 15
and 15
youre 15
wrong 15
theyre 15
certainly 15
entitled 15
to 15
think 15
that 15
and 15
theyre 15
entitled 15
to 15
full 15
respect 15
for 15
their 15
opinions 15
said 15
atticus 15
but 15
before 15
i 15
can 15
live 15
with 15
other 15
folks 15
ive 15
got 15
to 15
live 15
with 15
myself 15
the 15
one 15
thing 15
that 15
doesnt 15
abide 15
by 15
majority 15
rule 15
is 15
a 15
persons 15
conscience 15
when 15
jem 15
returned 15
he 15
found 15
me 15
still 15
in 15
atticuss 15
lap 15
well 15
son 15
said 15
atticus 15
he 15
set 15
me 15
on 15
my 15
feet 15
and 15
i 15
made 15
a 15
secret 15
reconnaissance 15
of 15
jem 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
all 15
in 15
one 15
piece 15
but 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
queer 15
look 15
on 15
his 15
face 15
perhaps 15
she 15
had 15
given 15
him 15
a 15
dose 15
of 15
calomel 15
i 15
cleaned 15
it 15
up 15
for 15
her 15
and 15
said 15
i 15
was 15
sorry 15
but 15
i 15
aint 15
and 15
that 15
id 15
work 15
on 15
em 15
ever 15
saturday 15
and 15
try 15
to 15
make 15
em 15
grow 15
back 15
out 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
point 15
in 15
saying 15
you 15
were 15
sorry 15
if 15
you 15
arent 15
said 15
atticus 15
jem 15
shes 15
old 15
and 15
ill 15
you 15
cant 15
hold 15
her 15
responsible 15
for 15
what 15
she 15
says 15
and 15
does 15
of 15
course 15
id 15
rather 15
shed 15
have 15
said 15
it 15
to 15
me 15
than 15
to 15
either 15
of 15
you 15
but 15
we 15
cant 15
always 15
have 15
our 15
druthers 15
jem 15
seemed 15
fascinated 15
by 15
a 15
rose 15
in 15
the 15
carpet 15
atticus 15
he 15
said 15
she 15
wants 15
me 15
to 15
read 15
to 15
her 15
read 15
to 15
her 15
yes 15
sir 15
she 15
wants 15
me 15
to 15
come 15
every 15
afternoon 15
after 15
school 15
and 15
saturdays 15
and 15
read 15
to 15
her 15
out 15
loud 15
for 15
two 15
hours 15
atticus 15
do 15
i 15
have 15
to 15
certainly 15
but 15
she 15
wants 15
me 15
to 15
do 15
it 15
for 15
a 15
month 15
then 15
youll 15
do 15
it 15
for 15
a 15
month 15
jem 15
planted 15
his 15
big 15
toe 15
delicately 15
in 15
the 15
center 15
of 15
the 15
rose 15
and 15
pressed 15
it 15
in 15
finally 15
he 15
said 15
atticus 15
its 15
all 15
right 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
but 15
inside 15
its 15
its 15
all 15
dark 15
and 15
creepy 15
theres 15
shadows 15
and 15
things 15
on 15
the 15
ceiling 15
atticus 15
smiled 15
grimly 15
that 15
should 15
appeal 15
to 15
your 15
imagination 15
just 15
pretend 15
youre 15
inside 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
the 15
following 15
monday 15
afternoon 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
climbed 15
the 15
steep 15
front 15
steps 15
to 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
house 15
and 15
padded 15
down 15
the 15
open 15
hallway 15
jem 15
armed 15
with 15
ivanhoe 15
and 15
full 15
of 15
superior 15
knowledge 15
knocked 15
at 15
the 15
second 15
door 15
on 15
the 15
left 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
he 15
called 15
jessie 15
opened 15
the 15
wood 15
door 15
and 15
unlatched 15
the 15
screen 15
door 15
is 15
that 15
you 15
jem 15
finch 15
she 15
said 15

you 15
i 15

in 15
jessie 15

mrs 15
dubose 15
jessie 15
admitted 15
us 15
and 15
went 15
off 15
to 15
the 15
kitchen 15
an 15
oppressive 15
odor 15
met 15
us 15
when 15
we 15
crossed 15
the 15
threshold 15
an 15
odor 15
i 15
had 15
met 15
many 15
times 15
in 15
rainrotted 15
gray 15
houses 15
where 15
there 15
are 15
coaloil 15
lamps 15
water 15
dippers 15
and 15
unbleached 15
domestic 15
sheets 15
it 15
always 15
made 15
me 15
afraid 15
expectant 15
watchful 15
in 15
the 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
was 15
a 15
brass 15
bed 15
and 15
in 15
the 15
bed 15
was 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
jems 15
activities 15
had 15
put 15
her 15
there 15
and 15
for 15
a 15
moment 15
i 15
felt 15
sorry 15
for 15
her 15
she 15
was 15
lying 15
under 15
a 15
pile 15
of 15
quilts 15
and 15
looked 15
almost 15
friendly 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
marbletopped 15
washstand 15
by 15
her 15
bed 15
on 15
it 15
were 15
a 15
glass 15
with 15
a 15
teaspoon 15
in 15
it 15
a 15
red 15
ear 15
syringe 15
a 15
box 15
of 15
absorbent 15
cotton 15
and 15
a 15
steel 15
alarm 15
clock 15
standing 15
on 15
three 15
tiny 15
legs 15
so 15
you 15
brought 15
that 15
dirty 15
little 15
sister 15
of 15
yours 15
did 15
you 15
was 15
her 15
greeting 15
jem 15
said 15
quietly 15
my 15
sister 15
aint 15
dirty 15
and 15
i 15
aint 15
scared 15
of 15
you 15
although 15
i 15
noticed 15
his 15
knees 15
shaking 15
i 15
was 15
expecting 15
a 15
tirade 15
but 15
all 15
she 15
said 15
was 15
you 15
may 15
commence 15
reading 15
jeremy 15
jem 15
sat 15
down 15
in 15
a 15
canebottom 15
chair 15
and 15
opened 15
ivanhoe 15
i 15
pulled 15
up 15
another 15
one 15
and 15
sat 15
beside 15
him 15
come 15
closer 15
said 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
come 15
to 15
the 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
bed 15
we 15
moved 15
our 15
chairs 15
forward 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
nearest 15
i 15
had 15
ever 15
been 15
to 15
her 15
and 15
the 15
thing 15
i 15
wanted 15
most 15
to 15
do 15
was 15
move 15
my 15
chair 15
back 15
again 15
she 15
was 15
horrible 15
her 15
face 15
was 15
the 15
color 15
of 15
a 15
dirty 15
pillowcase 15
and 15
the 15
corners 15
of 15
her 15
mouth 15
glistened 15
with 15
wet 15
which 15
inched 15
like 15
a 15
glacier 15
down 15
the 15
deep 15
grooves 15
enclosing 15
her 15
chin 15
oldage 15
liver 15
spots 15
dotted 15
her 15
cheeks 15
and 15
her 15
pale 15
eyes 15
had 15
black 15
pinpoint 15
pupils 15
her 15
hands 15
were 15
knobby 15
and 15
the 15
cuticles 15
were 15
grown 15
up 15
over 15
her 15
fingernails 15
her 15
bottom 15
plate 15
was 15
not 15
in 15
and 15
her 15
upper 15
lip 15
protruded 15
from 15
time 15
to 15
time 15
she 15
would 15
draw 15
her 15
nether 15
lip 15
to 15
her 15
upper 15
plate 15
and 15
carry 15
her 15
chin 15
with 15
it 15
this 15
made 15
the 15
wet 15
move 15
faster 15
i 15
didnt 15
look 15
any 15
more 15
than 15
i 15
had 15
to 15
jem 15
reopened 15
ivanhoe 15
and 15
began 15
reading 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
keep 15
up 15
with 15
him 15
but 15
he 15
read 15
too 15
fast 15
when 15
jem 15
came 15
to 15
a 15
word 15
he 15
didnt 15
know 15
he 15
skipped 15
it 15
but 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
would 15
catch 15
him 15
and 15
make 15
him 15
spell 15
it 15
out 15
jem 15
read 15
for 15
perhaps 15
twenty 15
minutes 15
during 15
which 15
time 15
i 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
sootstained 15
mantelpiece 15
out 15
the 15
window 15
anywhere 15
to 15
keep 15
from 15
looking 15
at 15
her 15
as 15
he 15
read 15
along 15
i 15
noticed 15
that 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
corrections 15
grew 15
fewer 15
and 15
farther 15
between 15
that 15
jem 15
had 15
even 15
left 15
one 15
sentence 15
dangling 15
in 15
midair 15
she 15
was 15
not 15
listening 15
i 15
looked 15
toward 15
the 15
bed 15
something 15
had 15
happened 15
to 15
her 15
she 15
lay 15
on 15
her 15
back 15
with 15
the 15
quilts 15
up 15
to 15
her 15
chin 15
only 15
her 15
head 15
and 15
shoulders 15
were 15
visible 15
her 15
head 15
moved 15
slowly 15
from 15
side 15
to 15
side 15
from 15
time 15
to 15
time 15
she 15
would 15
open 15
her 15
mouth 15
wide 15
and 15
i 15
could 15
see 15
her 15
tongue 15
undulate 15
faintly 15
cords 15
of 15
saliva 15
would 15
collect 15
on 15
her 15
lips 15
she 15
would 15
draw 15
them 15
in 15
then 15
open 15
her 15
mouth 15
again 15
her 15
mouth 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
a 15
private 15
existence 15
of 15
its 15
own 15
it 15
worked 15
separate 15
and 15
apart 15
from 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
her 15
out 15
and 15
in 15
like 15
a 15
clam 15
hole 15
at 15
low 15
tide 15
occasionally 15
it 15
would 15
say 15
pt 15
like 15
some 15
viscous 15
substance 15
coming 15
to 15
a 15
boil 15
i 15
pulled 15
jems 15
sleeve 15
he 15
looked 15
at 15
me 15
then 15
at 15
the 15
bed 15
her 15
head 15
made 15
its 15
regular 15
sweep 15
toward 15
us 15
and 15
jem 15
said 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
are 15
you 15
all 15
right 15
she 15
did 15
not 15
hear 15
him 15
the 15
alarm 15
clock 15
went 15
off 15
and 15
scared 15
us 15
stiff 15
a 15
minute 15
later 15
nerves 15
still 15
tingling 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
were 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
headed 15
for 15
home 15
we 15
did 15
not 15
run 15
away 15
jessie 15
sent 15
us 15
before 15
the 15
clock 15
wound 15
down 15
she 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
room 15
pushing 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
out 15
of 15
it 15
shoo 15
she 15
said 15
you 15
all 15
go 15
home 15
jem 15
hesitated 15
at 15
the 15
door 15
its 15
time 15
for 15
her 15
medicine 15
jessie 15
said 15
as 15
the 15
door 15
swung 15
shut 15
behind 15
us 15
i 15
saw 15
jessie 15
walking 15
quickly 15
toward 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
bed 15
it 15
was 15
only 15
three 15
fortyfive 15
when 15
we 15
got 15
home 15
so 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
dropkicked 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
until 15
it 15
was 15
time 15
to 15
meet 15
atticus 15
atticus 15
had 15
two 15
yellow 15
pencils 15
for 15
me 15
and 15
a 15
football 15
magazine 15
for 15
jem 15
which 15
i 15
suppose 15
was 15
a 15
silent 15
reward 15
for 15
our 15
first 15
days 15
session 15
with 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
jem 15
told 15
him 15
what 15
happened 15
did 15
she 15
frighten 15
you 15
asked 15
atticus 15
no 15
sir 15
said 15
jem 15
but 15
shes 15
so 15
nasty 15
she 15
has 15
fits 15
or 15
somethin 15
she 15
spits 15
a 15
lot 15
she 15
cant 15
help 15
that 15
when 15
people 15
are 15
sick 15
they 15
dont 15
look 15
nice 15
sometimes 15
she 15
scared 15
me 15
i 15
said 15
atticus 15
looked 15
at 15
me 15
over 15
his 15
glasses 15
you 15
dont 15
have 15
to 15
go 15
with 15
jem 15
you 15
know 15
the 15
next 15
afternoon 15
at 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
was 15
the 15
same 15
as 15
the 15
first 15
and 15
so 15
was 15
the 15
next 15
until 15
gradually 15
a 15
pattern 15
emerged 15
everything 15
would 15
begin 15
normally 15
that 15
is 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
would 15
hound 15
jem 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
on 15
her 15
favorite 15
subjects 15
her 15
camellias 15
and 15
our 15
fathers 15
niggerloving 15
propensities 15
she 15
would 15
grow 15
increasingly 15
silent 15
then 15
go 15
away 15
from 15
us 15
the 15
alarm 15
clock 15
would 15
ring 15
jessie 15
would 15
shoo 15
us 15
out 15
and 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
the 15
day 15
was 15
ours 15
atticus 15
i 15
said 15
one 15
evening 15
what 15
exactly 15
is 15
a 15
niggerlover 15
atticuss 15
face 15
was 15
grave 15
has 15
somebody 15
been 15
calling 15
you 15
that 15
no 15
sir 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
calls 15
you 15
that 15
she 15
warms 15
up 15
every 15
afternoon 15
calling 15
you 15
that 15
francis 15
called 15
me 15
that 15
last 15
christmas 15
thats 15
where 15
i 15
first 15
heard 15
it 15
is 15
that 15
the 15
reason 15
you 15
jumped 15
on 15
him 15
asked 15
atticus 15
yes 15
sir 15
then 15
why 15
are 15
you 15
asking 15
me 15
what 15
it 15
means 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
explain 15
to 15
atticus 15
that 15
it 15
wasnt 15
so 15
much 15
what 15
francis 15
said 15
that 15
had 15
infuriated 15
me 15
as 15
the 15
way 15
he 15
had 15
said 15
it 15
it 15
was 15
like 15
hed 15
said 15
snotnose 15
or 15
somethin 15
scout 15
said 15
atticus 15
niggerlover 15
is 15
just 15
one 15
of 15
those 15
terms 15
that 15
dont 15
mean 15
anything 15
like 15
snotnose 15
its 15
hard 15
to 15
explain 15
ignorant 15
trashy 15
people 15
use 15
it 15
when 15
they 15
think 15
somebodys 15
favoring 15
negroes 15
over 15
and 15
above 15
themselves 15
its 15
slipped 15
into 15
usage 15
with 15
some 15
people 15
like 15
ourselves 15
when 15
they 15
want 15
a 15
common 15
ugly 15
term 15
to 15
label 15
somebody 15
you 15
arent 15
really 15
a 15
niggerlover 15
then 15
are 15
you 15
i 15
certainly 15
am 15
i 15
do 15
my 15
best 15
to 15
love 15
everybody 15
im 15
hard 15
put 15
sometimes 15
baby 15
its 15
never 15
an 15
insult 15
to 15
be 15
called 15
what 15
somebody 15
thinks 15
is 15
a 15
bad 15
name 15
it 15
just 15
shows 15
you 15
how 15
poor 15
that 15
person 15
is 15
it 15
doesnt 15
hurt 15
you 15
so 15
dont 15
let 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
get 15
you 15
down 15
she 15
has 15
enough 15
troubles 15
of 15
her 15
own 15
one 15
afternoon 15
a 15
month 15
later 15
jem 15
was 15
ploughing 15
his 15
way 15
through 15
sir 15
walter 15
scout 15
as 15
jem 15
called 15
him 15
and 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
was 15
correcting 15
him 15
at 15
every 15
turn 15
when 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
knock 15
on 15
the 15
door 15
come 15
in 15
she 15
screamed 15
atticus 15
came 15
in 15
he 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
bed 15
and 15
took 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
hand 15
i 15
was 15
coming 15
from 15
the 15
office 15
and 15
didnt 15
see 15
the 15
children 15
he 15
said 15
i 15
thought 15
they 15
might 15
still 15
be 15
here 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
smiled 15
at 15
him 15
for 15
the 15
life 15
of 15
me 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
figure 15
out 15
how 15
she 15
could 15
bring 15
herself 15
to 15
speak 15
to 15
him 15
when 15
she 15
seemed 15
to 15
hate 15
him 15
so 15
do 15
you 15
know 15
what 15
time 15
it 15
is 15
atticus 15
she 15
said 15
exactly 15
fourteen 15
minutes 15
past 15
five 15
the 15
alarm 15
clocks 15
set 15
for 15
fivethirty 15
i 15
want 15
you 15
to 15
know 15
that 15
it 15
suddenly 15
came 15
to 15
me 15
that 15
each 15
day 15
we 15
had 15
been 15
staying 15
a 15
little 15
longer 15
at 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
that 15
the 15
alarm 15
clock 15
went 15
off 15
a 15
few 15
minutes 15
later 15
every 15
day 15
and 15
that 15
she 15
was 15
well 15
into 15
one 15
of 15
her 15
fits 15
by 15
the 15
time 15
it 15
sounded 15
today 15
she 15
had 15
antagonized 15
jem 15
for 15
nearly 15
two 15
hours 15
with 15
no 15
intention 15
of 15
having 15
a 15
fit 15
and 15
i 15
felt 15
hopelessly 15
trapped 15
the 15
alarm 15
clock 15
was 15
the 15
signal 15
for 15
our 15
release 15
if 15
one 15
day 15
it 15
did 15
not 15
ring 15
what 15
would 15
we 15
do 15
i 15
have 15
a 15
feeling 15
that 15
jems 15
reading 15
days 15
are 15
numbered 15
said 15
atticus 15
only 15
a 15
week 15
longer 15
i 15
think 15
she 15
said 15
just 15
to 15
make 15
sure 15
jem 15
rose 15
but 15
atticus 15
put 15
out 15
his 15
hand 15
and 15
jem 15
was 15
silent 15
on 15
the 15
way 15
home 15
jem 15
said 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
do 15
it 15
just 15
for 15
a 15
month 15
and 15
the 15
month 15
was 15
up 15
and 15
it 15
wasnt 15
fair 15
just 15
one 15

atticus 15

following 15
week 15

sounding 15
but 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
would 15
release 15
us 15
with 15
thatll 15
do 15
so 15
late 15
in 15
the 15
afternoon 15
atticus 15
would 15
be 15
home 15
reading 15
the 15
paper 15
when 15
we 15
returned 15
although 15
her 15
fits 15
had 15
passed 15
off 15
she 15
was 15
in 15
every 15
other 15
way 15
her 15
old 15
self 15
when 15
sir 15
walter 15
scott 15
became 15
involved 15
in 15
lengthy 15
descriptions 15
of 15
moats 15
and 15
castles 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
would 15
become 15
bored 15
and 15
pick 15
on 15
us 15
jeremy 15
finch 15

he 15
would 15
gaze 15
at 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
with 15
a 15
face 15
devoid 15
of 15
resentment 15
through 15
the 15
weeks 15
he 15
had 15
cultivated 15
an 15
expression 15
of 15
polite 15
and 15
detached 15
interest 15
which 15
he 15
would 15
present 15
to 15
her 15
in 15
answer 15
to 15
her 15
most 15
bloodcurdling 15
inventions 15
at 15

too 15
contrary 15
sir 15

jem 15
atticus 15

months 15
left 15
her 15

in 15
perfect 15
order 15
but 15
she 15
said 15
theres 15
still 15
one 15
thing 15
out 15
of 15
order 15
what 15
was 15
that 15
jem 15
was 15
perplexed 15
she 15
said 15
she 15
was 15
going 15
to 15
leave 15
this 15
world 15
beholden 15
to 15
nothing 15
and 15
nobody 15
jem 15
when 15
youre 15
sick 15
as 15
she 15
was 15
its 15
all 15
right 15
to 15
take 15
anything 15
to 15
make 15
it 15
easier 15
but 15
it 15
wasnt 15
all 15
right 15
for 15
her 15
she 15
said 15
she 15
meant 15
to 15
break 15
herself 15
of 15
it 15
before 15
she 15
died 15
and 15
thats 15
what 15
she 15

thats 15
what 15
her 15
fits 15
were 15

what 15
they 15
were 15
most 15
of 15
the 15
time 15
you 15
were 15
reading 15
to 15
her 15
i 15
doubt 15
if 15
she 15
heard 15
a 15
word 15
you 15
said 15
her 15
whole 15
mind 15
and 15
body 15
were 15
concentrated 15
on 15
that 15
alarm 15
clock 15
if 15
you 15
hadnt 15
fallen 15
into 15
her 15
hands 15
id 15
have 15
made 15
you 15
go 15
read 15
to 15
her 15
anyway 15
it 15
may 15
have 15
been 15
some 15
distraction 15
there 15
was 15
another 15
reason 15

she 15
die 15

conscious 15
he 15
smiled 15
and 15
cantankerous 15
she 15
still 15
disapproved 15
heartily 15
of 15
my 15
doings 15
and 15
said 15

on 15
in 15
the 15

lots 15
of 15
things 15
to 15

in 15
here 15
the 15
beginning 15
of 15
that 15

until 15
dill 15
came 15
she 15
seemed 15
glad 15
to 15
see 15
me 15
when 15
i 15
appeared 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
and 15
by 15
watching 15
her 15
i 15
began 15
to 15
think 15
there 15
was 15
some 15
skill 15
involved 15
in 15
being 15
a 15
girl 15
but 15
summer 15
came 15
and 15
dill 15
was 15
not 15
there 15
i 15
received 15
a 15
letter 15
and 15
a 15
snapshot 15
from 15
him 15
the 15
letter 15
said 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
new 15
father 15
whose 15
picture 15
was 15
enclosed 15
and 15
he 15
would 15
have 15
to 15
stay 15
in 15
meridian 15
because 15
they 15
planned 15
to 15
build 15
a 15
fishing 15
boat 15
his 15
father 15
was 15
a 15
lawyer 15
like 15
atticus 15
only 15
much 15
younger 15
dills 15
new 15
father 15
had 15
a 15
pleasant 15
face 15
which 15
made 15
me 15
glad 15
dill 15
had 15
captured 15
him 15
but 15
i 15
was 15
crushed 15
dill 15
concluded 15
by 15
saying 15
he 15
would 15
love 15
me 15
forever 15
and 15
not 15
to 15
worry 15
he 15
would 15
come 15
get 15
me 15
and 15
marry 15
me 15
as 15
soon 15
as 15
he 15
got 15
enough 15
money 15
together 15
so 15
please 15
write 15
the 15
fact 15
that 15
i 15
had 15
a 15
permanent 15
fiance 15
was 15
little 15
compensation 15
for 15
his 15
absence 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
thought 15
about 15
it 15
but 15
summer 15
was 15
dill 15
by 15
the 15
fishpool 15
smoking 15
string 15
dills 15
eyes 15
alive 15
with 15
complicated 15
plans 15
to 15
make 15
boo 15
radley 15
emerge 15
summer 15
was 15
the 15
swiftness 15
with 15
which 15
dill 15
would 15
reach 15
up 15
and 15
kiss 15
me 15
when 15
jem 15
was 15
not 15
looking 15
the 15
longings 15
we 15
sometimes 15
felt 15
each 15
other 15
feel 15
with 15
him 15
life 15
was 15
routine 15
without 15
him 15
life 15
was 15
unbearable 15
i 15
stayed 15
miserable 15
for 15
two 15
days 15
as 15
if 15
that 15
were 15
not 15
enough 15
the 15
state 15
legislature 15
was 15
called 15
into 15
emergency 15
session 15
and 15
atticus 15
left 15
us 15
for 15
two 15
weeks 15
the 15
governor 15
was 15
eager 15
to 15
scrape 15
a 15
few 15
barnacles 15
off 15
the 15
ship 15
of 15
state 15
there 15
were 15
sitdown 15
strikes 15
in 15
birmingham 15
bread 15
lines 15
in 15
the 15
cities 15
grew 15
longer 15
people 15
in 15
the 15
country 15
grew 15
poorer 15
but 15
these 15
were 15
events 15
remote 15
from 15
the 15
world 15
of 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
we 15
were 15
surprised 15
one 15
morning 15
to 15

to 15
a 15
desk 15
he 15
was 15
diligently 15
writing 15
on 15
a 15
slate 15
while 15
some 15
frivolouslooking 15
girls 15
yelled 15

in 15
addition 15
to 15
jems 15
newly 15
developed 15
characteristics 15
he 15
had 15
acquired 15
a 15
maddening 15
air 15
of 15
wisdom 15

quietly 15
to 15

dreadful 15
banging 15
issued 15
from 15
the 15
radiator 15
pipes 15
persisting 15
until 15
someone 15
investigated 15
and 15
brought 15
forth 15
eunice 15
ann 15
saying 15

roughly 15
before 15

in 15
the 15
basin 15
and 15
washed 15

and 15
castile 15
she 15
had 15
trusted 15

outburst 15

brickhard 15
clay 15
as 15
was 15
the 15
cemetery 15
beside 15
it 15
if 15
someone 15
died 15
during 15
a 15
dry 15
spell 15
the 15
body 15
was 15
covered 15
with 15
chunks 15
of 15
ice 15
until 15
rain 15
softened 15
the 15
earth 15
a 15
few 15

was 15
a 15
happy 15
cemetery 15
the 15
warm 15
bittersweet 15
smell 15
of 15
clean 15
negro 15
welcomed 15
us 15
as 15
we 15
entered 15
the 15
churchyard 15
hearts 15
of 15
love 15

back 15
and 15
took 15
off 15
their 15
hats 15
the 15
women 15
crossed 15
their 15
arms 15
at 15
their 15
waists 15
weekday 15
gestures 15
of 15
respectful 15
attention 15
they 15
parted 15
and 15
made 15
a 15
small 15
pathway 15
to 15
the 15
church 15
door 15
for 15
us 15
calpurnia 15

between 15
jem 15

from 15
his 15
pew 15
and 15
walked 15
down 15
the 15
center 15
aisle 15
stopping 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
us 15
and 15
facing 15
the 15
congregation 15
he 15
was 15
carrying 15
a 15
battered 15
hymnbook 15
he 15
opened 15
it 15
and 15
said 15

smiled 15
hush 15
baby 15
she 15
whispered 15
youll 15
see 15
in 15
a 15
minute 15
zeebo 15
cleared 15
his 15
throat 15
and 15
read 15
in 15
a 15
voice 15
like 15
the 15
rumble 15
of 15
distant 15
artillery 15
theres 15
a 15
land 15
beyond 15
the 15
river 15
miraculously 15
on 15
pitch 15
a 15
hundred 15
voices 15
sang 15
out 15
zeebos 15
words 15
the 15
last 15
syllable 15
held 15
to 15
a 15
husky 15
hum 15
was 15
followed 15
by 15
zeebo 15
saying 15
that 15
we 15
call 15
the 15
sweet 15
forever 15
music 15
again 15
swelled 15
around 15
us 15
the 15
last 15
note 15
lingered 15
and 15
zeebo 15
met 15
it 15
with 15
the 15
next 15
line 15
and 15
we 15
only 15
reach 15
that 15
shore 15
by 15
faiths 15
decree 15
the 15
congregation 15
hesitated 15
zeebo 15
repeated 15
the 15
line 15
carefully 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
sung 15
at 15
the 15
chorus 15
zeebo 15
closed 15
the 15
book 15
a 15
signal 15
for 15
the 15
congregation 15
to 15
proceed 15
without 15
his 15
help 15
on 15
the 15
dying 15
notes 15
of 15
jubilee 15
zeebo 15
said 15
in 15
that 15
faroff 15
sweet 15
forever 15
just 15
beyond 15
the 15
shining 15
river 15
line 15
for 15
line 15
voices 15
followed 15
in 15
simple 15
harmony 15
until 15
the 15
hymn 15
ended 15
in 15
a 15
melancholy 15
murmur 15
i 15
looked 15
at 15
jem 15
who 15
was 15
looking 15
at 15
zeebo 15
from 15
the 15
corners 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
i 15
didnt 15
believe 15
it 15
either 15
but 15
we 15
had 15
both 15
heard 15
it 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
then 15
called 15
on 15
the 15
lord 15
to 15
bless 15
the 15
sick 15
and 15
the 15
suffering 15
a 15
procedure 15
no 15
different 15
from 15
our 15
church 15
practice 15
except 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
directed 15
the 15
deitys 15
attention 15
to 15
several 15
specific 15
cases 15
his 15
sermon 15
was 15
a 15
forthright 15
denunciation 15
of 15
sin 15
an 15
austere 15
declaration 15
of 15
the 15
motto 15
on 15
the 15
wall 15
behind 15
him 15
he 15
warned 15
his 15
flock 15
against 15
the 15
evils 15
of 15
heady 15
brews 15
gambling 15
and 15
strange 15
women 15
bootleggers 15
caused 15
enough 15
trouble 15
in 15
the 15
quarters 15
but 15
women 15
were 15
worse 15
again 15
as 15
i 15
had 15
often 15
met 15
it 15
in 15
my 15
own 15
church 15
i 15
was 15
confronted 15
with 15
the 15
impurity 15
of 15
women 15
doctrine 15
that 15
seemed 15
to 15
preoccupy 15
all 15
clergymen 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
heard 15
the 15
same 15
sermon 15
sunday 15
after 15
sunday 15
with 15
only 15
one 15
exception 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
used 15
his 15
pulpit 15
more 15
freely 15
to 15
express 15
his 15
views 15
on 15
individual 15
lapses 15
from 15
grace 15
jim 15
hardy 15
had 15
been 15
absent 15
from 15

ways 15

was 15
in 15
grave 15
danger 15
for 15
quarreling 15
with 15
her 15
neighbors 15
she 15
had 15
erected 15
the 15
only 15
spite 15
fence 15
in 15
the 15
history 15
of 15
the 15
quarters 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
closed 15
his 15
sermon 15
he 15
stood 15
beside 15
a 15
table 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
pulpit 15
and 15
requested 15
the 15
morning 15
offering 15
a 15
proceeding 15
that 15
was 15
strange 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
one 15
by 15
one 15
the 15
congregation 15
came 15
forward 15
and 15
dropped 15
nickels 15
and 15
dimes 15
into 15
a 15
black 15
enameled 15
coffee 15
can 15
jem 15
and 15

and 15
received 15
a 15
soft 15
thank 15
you 15
thank 15
you 15
as 15
our 15
dimes 15
clinked 15
to 15
our 15
amazement 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
emptied 15
the 15
can 15
onto 15
the 15
table 15
and 15
raked 15
the 15
coins 15
into 15
his 15
hand 15
he 15
straightened 15
up 15
and 15
said 15
this 15
is 15
not 15
enough 15
we 15
must 15
have 15
ten 15
dollars 15
the 15
congregation 15

its 15
for 15
helen 15

deposited 15
a 15
coin 15
the 15

was 15
sitting 15
in 15
a 15
rocking 15
chair 15
exactly 15
as 15
if 15
she 15

jem 15
and 15

the 15
suitcase 15
hit 15
the 15
bedroom 15
floor 15
with 15
a 15
thump 15
the 15
sound 15
had 15
a 15
dull 15
permanence 15
about 15
it 15
have 15
you 15
come 15
for 15
a 15
visit 15
aunty 15
i 15
asked 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
visits 15
from 15
the 15
landing 15
were 15
rare 15
and 15
she 15
traveled 15
in 15
state 15
she 15
owned 15
a 15
bright 15
green 15
square 15
buick 15
and 15
a 15
black 15
chauffeur 15
both 15
kept 15
in 15
an 15
unhealthy 15
state 15
of 15
tidiness 15
but 15
today 15
they 15
were 15
nowhere 15
to 15
be 15
seen 15
didnt 15
your 15
father 15
tell 15
you 15
she 15
asked 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
shook 15
our 15
heads 15
probably 15
he 15
forgot 15
hes 15
not 15
in 15
yet 15
is 15
he 15
nome 15
he 15
doesnt 15
usually 15
get 15

till 15
late 15
afternoon 15
said 15
jem 15
well 15
your 15
father 15
and 15
i 15
decided 15
it 15
was 15
time 15
i 15
came 15
to 15
stay 15
with 15
you 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
in 15
maycomb 15
meant 15
anything 15
from 15
three 15
days 15
to 15
thirty 15
years 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
exchanged 15
glances 15
jems 15
growing 15
up 15
now 15
and 15
you 15
are 15
too 15
she 15
said 15
to 15
me 15
we 15
decided 15
that 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
best 15
for 15
you 15
to 15
have 15
some 15
feminine 15
influence 15
it 15
wont 15
be 15
many 15
years 15
jean 15
louise 15
before 15
you 15
become 15
interested 15
in 15
clothes 15
and 15
boys 15
i 15
could 15
have 15
made 15
several 15
answers 15
to 15
this 15
cals 15
a 15
girl 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
many 15
years 15
before 15
i 15
would 15
be 15
interested 15
in 15
boys 15
i 15
would 15
never 15
be 15
interested 15
in 15
clothes 15
but 15
i 15
kept 15
quiet 15
what 15
about 15
uncle 15
jimmy 15
asked 15
jem 15
is 15
he 15
comin 15
too 15
oh 15
no 15

staying 15
at 15
the 15
landing 15
hell 15
keep 15
the 15
place 15
going 15
the 15
moment 15
i 15
said 15
wont 15
you 15
miss 15
him 15
i 15
realized 15
that 15
this 15
was 15
not 15
a 15
tactful 15
question 15
uncle 15
jimmy 15
present 15
or 15
uncle 15
jimmy 15
absent 15
made 15
not 15
much 15
difference 15
he 15
never 15
said 15
anything 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
ignored 15
my 15
question 15
i 15
could 15
think 15
of 15
nothing 15
else 15
to 15
say 15
to 15
her 15
in 15
fact 15
i 15
could 15
never 15
think 15
of 15
anything 15
to 15
say 15
to 15
her 15
and 15
i 15
sat 15
thinking 15
of 15
past 15
painful 15
conversations 15
between 15
us 15
how 15
are 15
you 15

well 15
what 15
do 15
you 15
all 15
do 15
nothin 15
it 15
was 15
plain 15
that 15
aunty 15
thought 15
me 15
dull 15
in 15
the 15
extreme 15
because 15
i 15
once 15
heard 15
her 15
tell 15
atticus 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
sluggish 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
story 15
behind 15
all 15
this 15
but 15
i 15
had 15
no 15
desire 15
to 15
extract 15
it 15
from 15
her 15
then 15
today 15
was 15
sunday 15
and 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
positively 15
irritable 15
on 15
the 15
lords 15
day 15
i 15
guess 15
it 15
was 15
her 15
sunday 15
corset 15
she 15
was 15
not 15
fat 15
but 15
solid 15
and 15
she 15
chose 15
protective 15
garments 15
that 15
drew 15
up 15
her 15
bosom 15
to 15
giddy 15
heights 15
pinched 15
in 15
her 15
waist 15
flared 15
out 15
her 15
rear 15
and 15
managed 15
to 15
suggest 15
that 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
was 15
once 15
an 15
hourglass 15
figure 15
from 15
any 15
angle 15
it 15
was 15
formidable 15
the 15
remainder 15
of 15
the 15
afternoon 15
went 15
by 15
in 15
the 15
gentle 15
gloom 15
that 15
descends 15
when 15
relatives 15
appear 15
but 15
was 15
dispelled 15
when 15
we 15
heard 15
a 15
car 15
turn 15
in 15
the 15
driveway 15
it 15
was 15
atticus 15
home 15
from 15
montgomery 15
jem 15
forgetting 15
his 15
dignity 15
ran 15
with 15
me 15
to 15
meet 15
him 15
jem 15
seized 15
his 15
briefcase 15
and 15
bag 15
i 15
jumped 15
into 15
his 15
arms 15
felt 15
his 15
vague 15
dry 15
kiss 15
and 15
said 15
d 15
you 15
bring 15
me 15
a 15
book 15
d 15
you 15
know 15
auntys 15

atticus 15
answered 15
both 15
questions 15
in 15
the 15
affirmative 15
howd 15
you 15
like 15
for 15
her 15
to 15
come 15

with 15
us 15
i 15
said 15
i 15
would 15
like 15
it 15
very 15
much 15
which 15
was 15
a 15
lie 15
but 15
one 15
must 15
lie 15
under 15
certain 15
circumstances 15
and 15
at 15
all 15
times 15
when 15
one 15
cant 15
do 15
anything 15
about 15
them 15
we 15
felt 15
it 15
was 15
time 15
you 15
children 15
needed 15
well 15
its 15
like 15
this 15
scout 15
atticus 15
said 15
your 15
aunts 15
doing 15
me 15
a 15
favor 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
you 15
all 15
i 15
cant 15
stay 15
here 15
all 15

with 15
you 15
and 15
the 15
summers 15
going 15
to 15

a 15
hot 15
one 15
yes 15
sir 15

said 15
not 15
understanding 15
a 15
word 15
he 15
said 15
i 15
had 15
an 15
idea 15
however 15
that 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
appearance 15
on 15
the 15
scene 15
was 15
not 15
so 15
much 15
atticuss 15
doing 15
as 15
hers 15
aunty 15
had 15
a 15
way 15
of 15
declaring 15
what 15
is 15
best 15
for 15
the 15
family 15
and 15
i 15
suppose 15
her 15
coming 15
to 15
live 15
with 15
us 15
was 15
in 15
that 15
category 15
maycomb 15
welcomed 15
her 15
miss 15
maudie 15
atkinson 15
baked 15
a 15
lane 15
cake 15
so 15
loaded 15
with 15
shinny 15
it 15
made 15
me 15
tight 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
had 15
long 15
visits 15
with 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
consisting 15
mostly 15
of 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
shaking 15
her 15
head 15
and 15
saying 15
uh 15

aunty 15
over 15
for 15
coffee 15
in 15
the 15
afternoons 15
and 15
mr 15
nathan 15
radley 15
went 15
so 15
far 15
as 15
to 15
come 15
up 15
in 15
the 15
front 15
yard 15
and 15
say 15
he 15
was 15
glad 15
to 15

her 15
when 15
she 15
settled 15
in 15
with 15
us 15
and 15
life 15
resumed 15
its 15
daily 15
pace 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
seemed 15
as 15
if 15
she 15
had 15
always 15
lived 15
with 15
us 15
her 15
missionary 15
society 15
refreshments 15
added 15
to 15
her 15
reputation 15
as 15
a 15
hostess 15
she 15
did 15
not 15
permit 15
calpurnia 15
to 15
make 15
the 15
delicacies 15
required 15
to 15
sustain 15
the 15
society 15
through 15
long 15
reports 15
on 15
rice 15
christians 15

joined 15
and 15
became 15

of 15
the 15
maycomb 15
amanuensis 15
club 15
to 15
all 15

and 15
participating 15
in 15
the 15
life 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
last 15
of 15
her 15
kind 15
she 15
had 15
riverboat 15
boardingschool 15
manners 15
let 15
any 15
moral 15
come 15
along 15
and 15
she 15
would 15
uphold 15
it 15
she 15

born 15
in 15
the 15
objective 15
case 15
she 15
was 15
an 15
incurable 15
gossip 15
when 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
went 15
to 15
school 15
selfdoubt 15
could 15
not 15
be 15
found 15
in 15
any 15
textbook 15
so 15
she 15
knew 15
not 15
its 15
meaning 15
she 15
was 15
never 15
bored 15
and 15
given 15
the 15
slightest 15
chance 15
she 15
would 15
exercise 15
her 15
royal 15
prerogative 15
she 15
would 15
arrange 15
advise 15
caution 15
and 15
warn 15
she 15
never 15
let 15
a 15
chance 15
escape 15
her 15
to 15
point 15
out 15
the 15
shortcomings 15
of 15
other 15
tribal 15
groups 15
to 15
the 15
greater 15
glory 15
of 15
our 15
own 15
a 15
habit 15
that 15
amused 15
jem 15
rather 15
than 15
annoyed 15
him 15
aunty 15
better 15
watch 15
how 15
she 15
talks 15
scratch 15
most 15
folks 15
in 15
maycomb 15
and 15
theyre 15

it 15
was 15
caused 15
by 15
a 15
morbid 15
streak 15
in 15
the 15

let 15
a 15
sixteenyearold 15
girl 15
giggle 15
in 15
the 15
choir 15
and 15
aunty 15
would 15
say 15
it 15
just 15
goes 15
to 15
show 15
you 15
all 15
the 15
penfield 15
women 15
are 15
flighty 15
everybody 15
in 15
maycomb 15
it 15

had 15
a 15
streak 15
a 15
drinking 15

a 15

stephanie 15
crawfords 15

to 15
mind 15
other 15

was 15
hereditary 15
atticus 15
said 15
sister 15
when 15
you 15
stop 15
to 15
think 15
about 15
it 15
our 15
generations 15
practically 15
the 15
first 15
in 15
the 15
finch 15
family 15
not 15
to 15
marry 15
its 15
cousins 15
would 15
you 15
say 15
the 15
finches 15
have 15
an 15
incestuous 15
streak 15
aunty 15
said 15
no 15
thats 15
where 15
we 15
got 15
our 15
small 15
hands 15
and 15
feet 15
i 15
never 15
understood 15
her 15
preoccupation 15
with 15
heredity 15
somewhere 15
i 15
had 15
received 15
the 15
impression 15
that 15
fine 15
folks 15
were 15
people 15
who 15
did 15
the 15
best 15
they 15
could 15
with 15
the 15
sense 15
they 15
had 15
but 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
of 15
the 15
opinion 15
obliquely 15
expressed 15
that 15
the 15
longer 15
a 15
family 15
had 15
been 15
squatting 15
on 15
one 15
patch 15
of 15
land 15
the 15
finer 15
it 15
was 15
that 15
makes 15
the 15
ewells 15
fine 15
folks 15
then 15
said 15
jem 15
the 15
tribe 15
of 15
which 15
burris 15
ewell 15
and 15
his 15
brethren 15
consisted 15
had 15
lived 15
on 15
the 15
same 15
plot 15
of 15
earth 15
behind 15
the 15
maycomb 15
dump 15
and 15
had 15
thrived 15
on 15
county 15
welfare 15
money 15
for 15
three 15
generations 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
theory 15
had 15
something 15
behind 15
it 15
though 15
maycomb 15
was 15
an 15
ancient 15
town 15
it 15
was 15
twenty 15
miles 15
east 15
of 15
finchs 15
landing 15
awkwardly 15
inland 15
for 15
such 15
an 15
old 15
town 15
but 15
maycomb 15
would 15
have 15
been 15
closer 15
to 15
the 15
river 15
had 15
it 15
not 15
been 15
for 15
the 15
nimblewittedness 15
of 15
one 15
sinkfield 15
who 15
in 15
the 15
dawn 15
of 15
history 15
operated 15
an 15
inn 15
where 15
two 15
pigtrails 15
met 15
the 15
only 15
tavern 15
in 15
the 15
territory 15
sinkfield 15
no 15
patriot 15
served 15
and 15
supplied 15
ammunition 15
to 15
indians 15
and 15
settlers 15
alike 15
neither 15
knowing 15
or 15
caring 15
whether 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
the 15
alabama 15
territory 15
or 15
the 15
creek 15
nation 15
so 15
long 15
as 15
business 15
was 15
good 15
business 15
was 15
excellent 15
when 15
governor 15
william 15
wyatt 15
bibb 15
with 15
a 15
view 15
to 15
promoting 15
the 15
newly 15
created 15
countys 15
domestic 15
tranquility 15
dispatched 15
a 15
team 15
of 15
surveyors 15
to 15
locate 15
its 15
exact 15
center 15
and 15
there 15
establish 15
its 15
seat 15
of 15
government 15
the 15
surveyors 15
sinkfields 15
guests 15
told 15
their 15
host 15
that 15
he 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
territorial 15
confines 15
of 15
maycomb 15
county 15
and 15
showed 15
him 15
the 15
probable 15
spot 15
where 15
the 15
county 15
seat 15
would 15
be 15
built 15
had 15
not 15
sinkfield 15
made 15
a 15
bold 15
stroke 15
to 15
preserve 15
his 15
holdings 15
maycomb 15
would 15
have 15
sat 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
winston 15
swamp 15
a 15
place 15
totally 15
devoid 15
of 15
interest 15
instead 15
maycomb 15
grew 15
and 15
sprawled 15
out 15
from 15
its 15
hub 15
sinkfields 15
tavern 15
because 15
sinkfield 15
reduced 15
his 15
guests 15
to 15
myopic 15
drunkenness 15
one 15
evening 15
induced 15
them 15
to 15
bring 15
forward 15
their 15
maps 15
and 15
charts 15
lop 15
off 15
a 15
little 15
here 15
add 15
a 15
bit 15
there 15
and 15
adjust 15
the 15
center 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
to 15
meet 15
his 15
requirements 15
he 15
sent 15
them 15
packing 15
next 15
day 15
armed 15
with 15
their 15
charts 15
and 15
five 15
quarts 15
of 15
shinny 15
in 15
their 15
saddlebags 15
two 15
apiece 15
and 15
one 15
for 15
the 15
governor 15
because 15
its 15
primary 15
reason 15
for 15
existence 15
was 15
government 15
maycomb 15
was 15
spared 15
the 15
grubbiness 15
that 15
distinguished 15
most 15
alabama 15
towns 15
its 15
size 15
in 15
the 15
beginning 15
its 15
buildings 15
were 15
solid 15
its 15
courthouse 15
proud 15
its 15
streets 15
graciously 15
wide 15
maycombs 15
proportion 15
of 15
professional 15
people 15
ran 15
high 15
one 15
went 15
there 15
to 15
have 15
his 15
teeth 15
pulled 15
his 15
wagon 15
fixed 15
his 15
heart 15
listened 15
to 15
his 15
money 15
deposited 15
his 15
soul 15
saved 15
his 15
mules 15
vetted 15
but 15
the 15
ultimate 15
wisdom 15
of 15
sinkfields 15
maneuver 15
is 15
open 15
to 15
question 15
he 15
placed 15
the 15
young 15
town 15
too 15
far 15
away 15
from 15
the 15
only 15
kind 15
of 15
public 15
transportation 15
in 15
those 15
days 15
riverboat 15
and 15
it 15
took 15
a 15
man 15
from 15
the 15
north 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
two 15
days 15
to 15
travel 15
to 15
maycomb 15
for 15
storebought 15
goods 15
as 15
a 15
result 15
the 15
town 15
remained 15
the 15
same 15
size 15
for 15
a 15
hundred 15
years 15
an 15
island 15
in 15
a 15
patchwork 15
sea 15
of 15
cottonfields 15
and 15
timberland 15
although 15
maycomb 15
was 15
ignored 15
during 15
the 15
war 15
between 15
the 15
states 15
reconstruction 15
rule 15
and 15
economic 15
ruin 15
forced 15
the 15
town 15
to 15
grow 15
it 15
grew 15
inward 15
new 15
people 15
so 15
rarely 15
settled 15
there 15
the 15
same 15
families 15
married 15
the 15
same 15
families 15
until 15
the 15
members 15
of 15
the 15
community 15
looked 15
faintly 15
alike 15
occasionally 15
someone 15
would 15
return 15
from 15
montgomery 15
or 15
mobile 15
with 15
an 15
outsider 15
but 15
the 15
result 15
caused 15
only 15
a 15
ripple 15
in 15
the 15
quiet 15
stream 15
of 15
family 15
resemblance 15
things 15
were 15
more 15
or 15
less 15
the 15
same 15
during 15
my 15
early 15
years 15
there 15
was 15
indeed 15
a 15
caste 15
system 15
in 15
maycomb 15
but 15
to 15
my 15
mind 15
it 15
worked 15
this 15
way 15
the 15
older 15
citizens 15
the 15
present 15
generation 15
of 15
people 15
who 15
had 15
lived 15
side 15
by 15
side 15
for 15
years 15
and 15
years 15
were 15
utterly 15
predictable 15
to 15
one 15
another 15
they 15
took 15
for 15
granted 15
attitudes 15
character 15
shadings 15
even 15
gestures 15
as 15
having 15
been 15
repeated 15
in 15
each 15
generation 15
and 15
refined 15
by 15
time 15
thus 15
the 15
dicta 15
no 15
crawford 15
minds 15
his 15
own 15
business 15
every 15
third 15
merriweather 15
is 15
morbid 15
the 15
truth 15
is 15
not 15
in 15
the 15
delafields 15
all 15
the 15
bufords 15
walk 15
like 15
that 15
were 15
simply 15
guides 15
to 15
daily 15
living 15
never 15
take 15
a 15
check 15
from 15
a 15
delafield 15
without 15
a 15
discreet 15
call 15
to 15
the 15
bank 15
miss 15
maudie 15
atkinsons 15
shoulder 15

she 15
was 15
a 15

its 15
nothing 15
unusual 15
her 15
mother 15
did 15
the 15
same 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
fitted 15
into 15
the 15
world 15
of 15
maycomb 15
like 15
a 15
hand 15
into 15
a 15
glove 15
but 15
never 15
into 15
the 15
world 15
of 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
i 15
so 15
often 15
wondered 15
how 15
she 15
could 15
be 15
atticuss 15
and 15
uncle 15
jacks 15
sister 15
that 15
i 15
revived 15
halfremembered 15
tales 15
of 15
changelings 15
and 15
mandrake 15
roots 15
that 15
jem 15
had 15
spun 15
long 15
ago 15
these 15
were 15
abstract 15
speculations 15
for 15
the 15
first 15
month 15
of 15
her 15
stay 15
as 15
she 15
had 15
little 15
to 15
say 15
to 15
jem 15
or 15
me 15
and 15
we 15
saw 15
her 15
only 15
at 15
mealtimes 15
and 15
at 15
night 15
before 15
we 15
went 15
to 15
bed 15
it 15
was 15
summer 15
and 15
we 15
were 15
outdoors 15
of 15
course 15
some 15
afternoons 15
when 15
i 15
would 15
run 15
inside 15
for 15
a 15
drink 15
of 15
water 15
i 15
would 15
find 15
the 15
livingroom 15
overrun 15
with 15
maycomb 15
ladies 15
sipping 15
whispering 15
fanning 15
and 15
i 15
would 15
be 15
called 15
jean 15
louise 15
come 15
speak 15
to 15
these 15
ladies 15
when 15
i 15
appeared 15
in 15
the 15
doorway 15
aunty 15
would 15
look 15
as 15
if 15
she 15
regretted 15
her 15
request 15
i 15
was 15
usually 15
mudsplashed 15
or 15
covered 15
with 15
sand 15
speak 15
to 15
your 15
cousin 15
lily 15
she 15
said 15
one 15
afternoon 15
when 15
she 15
had 15
trapped 15
me 15
in 15
the 15
hall 15
who 15
i 15
said 15
your 15
cousin 15
lily 15
brooke 15
said 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
she 15
our 15
cousin 15
i 15
didnt 15
know 15
that 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
managed 15
to 15
smile 15
in 15
a 15
way 15
that 15
conveyed 15
a 15

of 15
the 15
corners 15

his 15
voice 15
rose 15
uncontrollably 15
atticus 15
whats 15
the 15

atticus 15
crossed 15
his 15
knees 15
and 15
folded 15
his 15
arms 15
im 15
trying 15
to 15
tell 15

jems 15
disgust 15
deepened 15
i 15

all 15
that 15
stuff 15
he 15
said 15
atticus 15
suddenly 15
grew 15
serious 15
in 15
his 15
lawyers 15
voice 15
without 15
a 15
shade 15
of 15
inflection 15
he 15
said 15
your 15
aunt 15
has 15
asked 15
me 15
to 15
try 15
and 15
impress 15

jean 15
louise 15
that 15
you 15

from 15
runofthemill 15
people 15
that 15
you 15
are 15
the 15
product 15
of 15
several 15
generations 15
gentle 15
breeding 15
atticus 15
paused 15
watching 15
me 15
locate 15
an 15
elusive 15
redbug 15
on 15
my 15
leg 15
gentle 15
breeding 15
he 15
continued 15
when 15
i 15
had 15
found 15
and 15
scratched 15
it 15
and 15
that 15
you 15
should 15
try 15
to 15
live 15
up 15
to 15
your 15
name 15
atticus 15
persevered 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
us 15
she 15
asked 15
me 15
to 15
tell 15
you 15
you 15
must 15
try 15
to 15
behave 15
like 15
the 15
little 15
lady 15
and 15
gentleman 15
that 15
you 15
are 15
she 15
wants 15
to 15
talk 15
to 15
you 15
about 15
the 15
family 15
and 15
what 15
its 15
meant 15
to 15
maycomb 15
county 15
through 15
the 15
years 15
so 15
youll 15
have 15
some 15
idea 15
of 15
who 15
you 15
are 15
so 15
you 15
might 15
be 15
moved 15
to 15
behave 15
accordingly 15
he 15
concluded 15
at 15
a 15
gallop 15
stunned 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
looked 15
at 15
each 15
other 15
then 15
at 15
atticus 15
whose 15
collar 15
seemed 15
to 15
worry 15
him 15
we 15
did 15
not 15
speak 15
to 15
him 15
presently 15
i 15
picked 15
up 15
a 15
comb 15
from 15
jems 15
dresser 15
and 15
ran 15
its 15
teeth 15
along 15
the 15
edge 15
stop 15
that 15
noise 15
atticus 15
said 15
his 15
curtness 15
stung 15
me 15
the 15
comb 15
was 15
midway 15
in 15
its 15
journey 15
and 15
i 15
banged 15
it 15
down 15
for 15
no 15
reason 15
i 15
felt 15
myself 15
beginning 15
to 15
cry 15
but 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
stop 15
this 15
was 15
not 15
my 15
father 15
my 15
father 15
never 15
thought 15
these 15
thoughts 15
my 15
father 15
never 15
spoke 15
so 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
had 15
put 15
him 15
up 15
to 15
this 15
somehow 15
through 15
my 15
tears 15
i 15
saw 15
jem 15
standing 15
in 15
a 15
similar 15
pool 15
of 15
isolation 15
his 15
head 15
cocked 15
to 15
one 15
side 15
there 15
was 15
nowhere 15
to 15
go 15
but 15
i 15
turned 15
to 15

front 15
i 15
buried 15
my 15
head 15
in 15
it 15
and 15
listened 15
to 15
the 15
small 15
internal 15
noises 15
that 15
went 15
on 15
behind 15
the 15
light 15
blue 15
cloth 15
his 15
watch 15
ticking 15
the 15
faint 15
crackle 15
of 15
his 15
starched 15
shirt 15
the 15
soft 15
sound 15
of 15
his 15
breathing 15
your 15
stomachs 15
growling 15
i 15
said 15
i 15

back 15
of 15
my 15
head 15
dont 15

about 15

said 15
its 15

time 15
to 15
worry 15
when 15
i 15
heard 15
that 15
i 15
knew 15
he 15
had 15
come 15
back 15
to 15
us 15
the 15
blood 15
in 15
my 15
legs 15
began 15
to 15
flow 15
again 15
and 15
i 15
raised 15
my 15
head 15
you 15

want 15
you 15
to 15
remember 15
it 15

it 15
he 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
door 15
and 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
shutting 15
the 15
door 15
behind 15
him 15
he 15
nearly 15
slammed 15
it 15
but 15
caught 15
himself 15
at 15
the 15
last 15
minute 15
and 15
closed 15
it 15
softly 15
as 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
stared 15
the 15
door 15
opened 15
again 15
and 15
atticus 15
peered 15
around 15
his 15
eyebrows 15
were 15
raised 15
his 15
glasses 15
had 15
slipped 15
get 15
more 15
like 15
cousin 15
joshua 15
every 15
day 15

i 15
do 15
you 15
think 15
ill 15
end 15
up 15
costing 15
the 15
family 15
five 15
hundred 15
dollars 15
i 15
know 15
now 15
what 15
he 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
do 15
but 15
atticus 15
was 15
only 15
a 15
man 15
it 15
takes 15
a 15
woman 15
to 15
do 15
that 15
kind 15
of 15
work 15
although 15
we 15
heard 15
no 15
more 15
about 15
the 15
finch 15
family 15
from 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
we 15
heard 15
plenty 15
from 15
the 15
town 15
on 15
saturdays 15
armed 15
with 15
our 15
nickels 15
when 15
jem 15
permitted 15
me 15
to 15
accompany 15
him 15
he 15
was 15
now 15
positively 15
allergic 15
to 15
my 15
presence 15
when 15
in 15
public 15
we 15
would 15
squirm 15
our 15
way 15
through 15
sweating 15
sidewalk 15
crowds 15
and 15
sometimes 15
hear 15
theres 15
his 15
chillun 15
or 15
yonders 15
some 15
finches 15
turning 15
to 15
face 15
our 15
accusers 15
we 15
would 15
see 15
only 15
a 15
couple 15
of 15
farmers 15
studying 15
the 15
enema 15
bags 15
in 15
the 15
mayco 15
drugstore 15
window 15
or 15
two 15
dumpy 15
countrywomen 15
in 15
straw 15
hats 15
sitting 15
in 15
a 15
hoover 15
cart 15
they 15
cn 15
go 15
loose 15
and 15
rape 15
up 15
the 15
countryside 15
for 15
all 15
of 15
em 15
who 15
run 15
this 15
county 15
care 15
was 15
one 15
obscure 15
observation 15
we 15
met 15
head 15
on 15
from 15
a 15
skinny 15
gentleman 15
when 15
he 15
passed 15
us 15
which 15
reminded 15
me 15
that 15
i 15
had 15
a 15
question 15
to 15
ask 15
atticus 15
whats 15
rape 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
that 15
night 15
atticus 15
looked 15
around 15
from 15
behind 15
his 15
paper 15
he 15
was 15
in 15
his 15
chair 15
by 15
the 15
window 15
as 15
we 15
grew 15
older 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
generous 15
to 15
allow 15
atticus 15
thirty 15
minutes 15
to 15
himself 15
after 15
supper 15
he 15
sighed 15
and 15
said 15
rape 15
was 15
carnal 15
knowledge 15
of 15
a 15
female 15
by 15
force 15
and 15
without 15
consent 15
well 15
if 15
thats 15
all 15
it 15
is 15
why 15
did 15
calpurnia 15
dry 15
me 15
up 15
when 15
i 15
asked 15
her 15
what 15
it 15
was 15
atticus 15
looked 15
pensive 15
whats 15
that 15
again 15
well 15
i 15
asked 15
calpurnia 15
comin 15
from 15
church 15
that 15
day 15
what 15
it 15
was 15
and 15
she 15
said 15

you 15
but 15
i 15
forgot 15
to 15
and 15
now 15
im 15
askin 15

his 15
paper 15
was 15
now 15
in 15
his 15
lap 15
again 15
please 15
he 15
said 15
i 15
told 15
him 15
in 15
detail 15
about 15
our 15
trip 15
to 15
church 15
with 15
calpurnia 15
atticus 15
seemed 15
to 15
enjoy 15
it 15
but 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
who 15

to 15
the 15
wall 15
with 15
his 15
good 15
eye 15

a 15
while 15
and 15
concluded 15
that 15
the 15
only 15
way 15
i 15
could 15
retire 15
with 15
a 15
shred 15
of 15
dignity 15
was 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
the 15
bathroom 15
where 15
i 15
stayed 15
long 15
enough 15
to 15
make 15
them 15
think 15
i 15
had 15
to 15
go 15
returning 15
i 15
lingered 15
in 15
the 15
hall 15
to 15
hear 15
a 15
fierce 15
discussion 15
going 15
on 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
through 15
the 15
door 15
i 15
could 15
see 15
jem 15
on 15
the 15
sofa 15
with 15
a 15
football 15
magazine 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
his 15
face 15
his 15
head 15
turning 15
as 15
if 15
its 15
pages 15
contained 15
a 15
live 15
tennis 15
match 15
youve 15
got 15
to 15
do 15
something 15
about 15

aunty 15

saying 15
youve 15
let 15
things 15
go 15
on 15
too 15
long 15
atticus 15
too 15
long 15
i 15
dont 15
see 15
any 15
harm 15
in 15
letting 15
her 15
go 15
out 15
there 15
cald 15
look 15
after 15
her 15
there 15
as 15
well 15

she 15
does 15
here 15
who 15
was 15
the 15
her 15
they 15
were 15
talking 15
about 15
my 15
heart 15
sank 15
me 15
i 15
felt 15
the 15
starched 15
walls 15
of 15
a 15
pink 15
cotton 15
penitentiary 15
closing 15
in 15
on 15
me 15
and 15
for 15
the 15
second 15
time 15
in 15
my 15
life 15
i 15
thought 15
of 15
running 15
away 15
immediately 15
atticus 15
its 15
all 15
right 15
to 15
be 15
softhearted 15

an 15
easy 15
man 15
but 15
you 15
have 15
a 15
daughter 15
to 15
think 15
of 15
a 15
daughter 15
whos 15
growing 15
up 15
thats 15
what 15
i 15
am 15
thinking 15
of 15
and 15
dont 15
try 15
to 15
get 15
around 15
it 15
youve 15
got 15
to 15
face 15
it 15

or 15
later 15

it 15
might 15
as 15
well 15
be 15
tonight 15
we 15
dont 15
need 15
her 15
now 15
atticuss 15

even 15
alexandra 15
calpurnias 15
not 15
leaving 15
this 15
house 15
until 15
she 15
wants 15
to 15

may 15
think 15
otherwise 15

along 15
without 15
her 15
all 15
these 15
years 15
shes 15
a 15
faithful 15
member 15
of 15
this 15
family 15
and 15
youll 15
simply 15
have 15
to 15
accept 15
things 15
the 15
way 15
they 15
are 15
besides 15
sister 15

no 15
reason 15
to 15
do 15
that 15
we 15
still 15
need 15
cal 15
as 15
much 15
as 15
we 15
ever 15
did 15
but 15
atticus 15
besides 15
i 15
dont 15
think 15
the 15
childrenve 15
suffered 15
one 15
bit 15
from 15
her 15
having 15
brought 15
them 15

if 15
anything 15
shes 15
been 15
harder 15
on 15
them 15
in 15
some 15
ways 15
than 15
a 15
mother 15
would 15
have 15
been 15
shes 15
never 15
let 15
them 15
get 15
away 15
with 15
anything 15
shes 15
never 15
indulged 15
them 15
the 15
way 15
most 15
colored 15
nurses 15
do 15
she 15
tried 15
to 15
bring 15
them 15
up 15
according 15
to 15
her 15
lights 15
and 15
cals 15

to 15
his 15

on 15
his 15
mind 15
now 15
without 15

atticus 15

anything 15
especially 15
on 15
his 15

once 15
a 15
week 15
and 15
then 15
it 15

last 15
thats 15
because 15
you 15

your 15
mind 15
but 15
a 15

while 15

different 15
with 15
grown 15
folks 15
we 15
his 15
maddening 15
superiority 15
was 15
unbearable 15
these 15
days 15
he 15
didnt 15
want 15
to 15
do 15
anything 15
but 15

and 15
go 15
off 15
by 15
himself 15
still 15
everything 15
he 15
read 15
he 15
passed 15
along 15
to 15
me 15
but 15
with 15
this 15
difference 15
formerly 15
because 15
he 15
thought 15
id 15
like 15
it 15
now 15
for 15
my 15
edification 15
and 15

he 15

sitting 15
on 15
the 15
bed 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
easy 15
to 15
grab 15
his 15
front 15
hair 15
and 15
land 15
one 15
on 15
his 15
mouth 15
he 15
slapped 15
me 15
and 15
i 15
tried 15
another 15
left 15
but 15
a 15
punch 15
in 15
the 15
stomach 15
sent 15
me 15
sprawling 15
on 15
the 15
floor 15
it 15
nearly 15
knocked 15
the 15
breath 15
out 15
of 15
me 15
but 15
it 15
didnt 15

the 15
bed 15
and 15
i 15
couldnt 15

at 15
him 15
as 15
hard 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
hitting 15
pulling 15
pinching 15
gouging 15
what 15
had 15
begun 15
as 15
a 15
fistfight 15
became 15
a 15
brawl 15
we 15
were 15
still 15
struggling 15
when 15
atticus 15
separated 15

when 15
she 15
went 15
down 15
the 15
hall 15
with 15
atticus 15
we 15
heard 15
her 15

of 15
the 15
things 15

stepped 15
on 15
something 15
warm 15
resilient 15

teeth 15
as 15

in 15
chains 15
and 15
left 15
to 15

in 15
the 15
basement 15
there 15
were 15
basements 15
in 15
meridian 15
by 15
his 15
new 15
father 15
who 15
disliked 15
him 15
and 15
secretly 15
kept 15
alive 15
on 15
raw 15
field 15
peas 15
by 15
a 15
passing 15
farmer 15
who 15
heard 15
his 15
cries 15
for 15
help 15
the 15
good 15
man 15
poked 15
a 15

pod 15
through 15
the 15
ventilator 15
dill 15

himself 15
free 15
by 15
pulling 15
the 15
chains 15
from 15
the 15
wall 15
still 15
in 15
wrist 15
manacles 15
he 15
wandered 15
two 15
miles 15
out 15
of 15
meridian 15
where 15
he 15
discovered 15
a 15
small 15
animal 15
show 15
and 15
was 15
immediately 15
engaged 15
to 15
wash 15
the 15
camel 15
he 15
traveled 15
with 15
the 15
show 15
all 15
over 15
mississippi 15
until 15
his 15
infallible 15
sense 15
of 15
direction 15
told 15
him 15
he 15
was 15
in 15
abbott 15
county 15
alabama 15
just 15
across 15
the 15
river 15
from 15
maycomb 15

walked 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
the 15
way 15

fourteen 15
miles 15
to 15
maycomb 15
off 15
the 15
highway 15
in 15
the 15
scrub 15
bushes 15
lest 15
the 15
authorities 15
be 15
seeking 15
him 15
and 15
had 15
ridden 15
the 15
remainder 15
of 15
the 15
way 15
clinging 15
to 15
the 15
backboard 15
of 15
a 15
cotton 15
wagon 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
under 15
the 15
bed 15
for 15
two 15
hours 15

had 15
heard 15
us 15
in 15
the 15
diningroom 15
and 15
the 15
clink 15
of 15

plates 15
nearly 15
drove 15

jem 15
and 15
i 15

never 15

off 15
in 15
the 15

long 15
last 15
bestowed 15
upon 15
him 15
atticus 15

up 15
his 15
glasses 15
and 15
rubbed 15
his 15
face 15
your 15

i 15
suppose 15

dumb 15

of 15
the 15

atticus 15
still 15
mopping 15
his 15
face 15
from 15
rape 15
to 15
riot 15
to 15
runaways 15
we 15
heard 15
him 15
chuckle 15

heard 15
of 15
who 15

a 15
boat 15
that 15
he 15
rowed 15
across 15
to 15
a 15
foggy 15
island 15
where 15
all 15

babies 15
were 15

auntys 15
diction 15

not 15
been 15
too 15
clear 15

so 15
you 15
get 15
babies 15
from 15
each 15
other 15
but 15
theres 15
this 15
man 15
too 15
he 15
has 15
all 15
these 15
babies 15
just 15
waitin 15
to 15

up 15
he 15
breathes 15
life 15
into 15
em 15
dill 15
was 15
off 15
again 15
beautiful 15
things 15
floated 15
around 15
in 15
his 15
dreamy 15
head 15
he 15
could 15
read 15
two 15
books 15
to 15
my 15
one 15
but 15
he 15
preferred 15
the 15
magic 15
of 15
his 15
own 15
inventions 15
he 15
could 15
add 15
and 15
subtract 15
faster 15
than 15
lightning 15
but 15
he 15
preferred 15
his 15
own 15
twilight 15
world 15
a 15
world 15
where 15
babies 15
slept 15
waiting 15
to 15
be 15
gathered 15
like 15
morning 15
lilies 15
he 15
was 15
slowly 15
talking 15
himself 15
to 15
sleep 15
and 15
taking 15
me 15
with 15
him 15
but 15
in 15
the 15
quietness 15
of 15
his 15
foggy 15
island 15
there 15
rose 15
the 15
faded 15
image 15
of 15
a 15
gray 15
house 15
with 15
sad 15
brown 15
doors 15
dill 15
mm 15

you 15
reckon 15
boo 15
radleys 15
never 15
run 15
off 15
dill 15
sighed 15
a 15
long 15
sigh 15
and 15
turned 15
away 15
from 15
me 15
maybe 15
he 15
doesnt 15
have 15
anywhere 15
to 15
run 15
off 15
to 15
after 15
many 15
telephone 15
calls 15
much 15
pleading 15
on 15
behalf 15
of 15
the 15
defendant 15
and 15
a 15
long 15
forgiving 15
letter 15
from 15
his 15
mother 15

a 15
week 15
of 15

the 15
truth 15

there 15
was 15
a 15
murmur 15
among 15
the 15
group 15
of 15
men 15
made 15
more 15
ominous 15
when 15
atticus 15
moved 15
back 15
to 15
the 15
bottom 15
front 15
step 15
and 15
the 15
men 15
drew 15
nearer 15
to 15
him 15
suddenly 15
jem 15
screamed 15
atticus 15
the 15
telephones 15
ringing 15
the 15
men 15
jumped 15
a 15
little 15
and 15
scattered 15
they 15
were 15
people 15
we 15
saw 15
every 15

atticus 15
laughter 15
broke 15
them 15
up 15
when 15
atticus 15
switched 15
on 15
the 15
overhead 15
light 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
he 15
found 15
jem 15
at 15
the 15
window 15
pale 15
except 15
for 15
the 15
vivid 15
mark 15
of 15
the 15
screen 15
on 15
his 15
nose 15
why 15
on 15

all 15
sitting 15
in 15
the 15
dark 15

asked 15
jem 15
watched 15
him 15
go 15
to 15
his 15
chair 15
and 15
pick 15
up 15
the 15
evening 15
paper 15
i 15
sometimes 15
think 15
atticus 15
subjected 15
every 15
crisis 15
of 15
his 15
life 15
to 15
tranquil 15
evaluation 15
behind 15
the 15
mobile 15
register 15
the 15
birmingham 15
news 15
and 15
the 15
montgomery 15

they 15
atticus 15
lowered 15
the 15
paper 15
and 15
gazed 15
at 15
jem 15
what 15
have 15
you 15

looking 15
from 15
the 15
corners 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
atticus 15
tried 15
to 15
stifle 15
a 15
smile 15
but 15
didnt 15
make 15
it 15
no 15
we 15

back 15
about 15

it 15
was 15
a 15
political 15
organization 15
more 15
than 15
anything 15
besides 15
they 15
couldnt 15

all 15
criteria 15
for 15
being 15
fine 15
folks 15
they 15
did 15
the 15
best 15
they 15
could 15
with 15
the 15
sense 15
they 15
had 15
and 15
they 15
had 15
been 15
living 15
on 15
the 15
same 15
plot 15
of 15
ground 15
in 15
maycomb 15
for 15
five 15
generations 15
the 15
ku 15

i 15
walked 15
home 15
with 15
dill 15
and 15
returned 15
in 15
time 15
to 15
overhear 15
atticus 15
saying 15
to 15
aunty 15
in 15
favor 15
of 15
southern 15
womanhood 15
as 15
much 15
as 15
anybody 15
but 15
not 15
for 15
preserving 15
polite 15
fiction 15
at 15
the 15
expense 15
of 15
human 15
life 15
a 15
pronouncement 15
that 15
made 15
me 15
suspect 15
they 15
had 15
been 15
fussing 15
again 15
i 15
sought 15
jem 15
and 15
found 15
him 15
in 15
his 15
room 15
on 15
the 15
bed 15
deep 15
in 15
thought 15
have 15
they 15
been 15
at 15
it 15
i 15
asked 15
sort 15
of 15
she 15
wont 15
let 15
him 15
alone 15
about 15
tom 15
robinson 15
she 15
almost 15
said 15
atticus 15
was 15
disgracin 15
the 15
family 15
scout 15
im 15
scared 15
scareda 15
what 15
scared 15
about 15
atticus 15
somebody 15
might 15
hurt 15
him 15
jem 15
preferred 15
to 15
remain 15
mysterious 15
all 15
he 15
would 15
say 15
to 15
my 15
questions 15
was 15
go 15
on 15
and 15
leave 15
him 15
alone 15
next 15
day 15
was 15
sunday 15
in 15
the 15
interval 15
between 15
sunday 15
school 15
and 15
church 15
when 15
the 15
congregation 15
stretched 15
its 15
legs 15
i 15
saw 15
atticus 15
standing 15
in 15
the 15
yard 15
with 15
another 15
knot 15
of 15
men 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
was 15
present 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
he 15
had 15
seen 15
the 15
light 15
he 15
never 15
went 15
to 15
church 15
even 15
mr 15
underwood 15
was 15
there 15
mr 15
underwood 15
had 15
no 15
use 15
for 15
any 15
organization 15
but 15
the 15
maycomb 15
tribune 15
of 15
which 15
he 15
was 15
the 15
sole 15
owner 15
editor 15
and 15
printer 15
his 15
days 15
were 15
spent 15
at 15
his 15
linotype 15
where 15
he 15
refreshed 15
himself 15
occasionally 15
from 15
an 15
everpresent 15
gallon 15
jug 15
of 15
cherry 15
wine 15
he 15
rarely 15
gathered 15
news 15
people 15
brought 15
it 15
to 15
him 15
it 15
was 15
said 15
that 15
he 15
made 15
up 15
every 15
edition 15
of 15
the 15
maycomb 15
tribune 15
out 15
of 15
his 15
own 15
head 15
and 15
wrote 15
it 15
down 15
on 15
the 15
linotype 15
this 15
was 15
believable 15
something 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
up 15
to 15
haul 15
mr 15
underwood 15
out 15
i 15
caught 15
atticus 15
coming 15
in 15
the 15
door 15
and 15
he 15
said 15
that 15
theyd 15
moved 15
tom 15
robinson 15
to 15
the 15
maycomb 15
jail 15
he 15
also 15
said 15
more 15
to 15
himself 15
than 15
to 15
me 15
that 15
if 15
theyd 15
kept 15
him 15
there 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
there 15
wouldnt 15
have 15
been 15
any 15
fuss 15
i 15
watched 15
him 15
take 15
his 15
seat 15
on 15
the 15
third 15
row 15
from 15
the 15
front 15
and 15
i 15
heard 15
him 15
rumble 15
nearer 15
my 15
god 15
to 15
thee 15
some 15
notes 15
behind 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
us 15
he 15
never 15
sat 15
with 15
aunty 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
he 15
liked 15
to 15
be 15
by 15
himself 15
in 15
church 15
the 15
fake 15
peace 15
that 15
prevailed 15
on 15
sundays 15
was 15
made 15
more 15
irritating 15
by 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
presence 15
atticus 15
would 15
flee 15
to 15
his 15
office 15
directly 15
after 15
dinner 15
where 15
if 15
we 15
sometimes 15
looked 15
in 15
on 15
him 15
we 15
would 15
find 15
him 15
sitting 15
back 15
in 15
his 15
swivel 15
chair 15
reading 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
composed 15
herself 15
for 15
a 15
twohour 15
nap 15
and 15
dared 15
us 15
to 15
make 15
any 15
noise 15
in 15
the 15
yard 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
was 15
resting 15
jem 15
in 15
his 15
old 15
age 15
had 15
taken 15
to 15
his 15
room 15
with 15
a 15
stack 15
of 15
football 15
magazines 15
so 15
dill 15
and 15
i 15
spent 15
our 15
sundays 15
creeping 15
around 15
in 15
deers 15
pasture 15
shooting 15
on 15
sundays 15
was 15

only 15

simply 15
by 15

out 15

upstairs 15
window 15
the 15
office 15
building 15
was 15
on 15

to 15
pass 15
the 15
jail 15
the 15
maycomb 15
jail 15
was 15
the 15
most 15
venerable 15
and 15
hideous 15
of 15
the 15
countys 15
buildings 15
atticus 15
said 15
it 15

like 15
something 15
cousin 15
joshua 15
st 15
clair 15
might 15
have 15
designed 15
it 15
was 15
certainly 15
someones 15
dream 15
starkly 15
out 15
of 15
place 15
in 15
a 15
town 15
of 15
squarefaced 15
stores 15
and 15
steeproofed 15
houses 15
the 15
maycomb 15
jail 15
was 15
a 15
miniature 15
gothic 15
joke 15
one 15
cell 15
wide 15
and 15
two 15
cells 15
high 15
complete 15
with 15
tiny 15
battlements 15
and 15
flying 15
buttresses 15
its 15
fantasy 15
was 15
heightened 15
by 15
its 15
red 15
brick 15
facade 15
and 15
the 15
thick 15
steel 15
bars 15
at 15
its 15
ecclesiastical 15
windows 15
it 15
stood 15
on 15
no 15
lonely 15
hill 15
but 15
was 15
wedged 15
between 15
tyndals 15

and 15
the 15

maycombs 15
only 15
conversation 15
piece 15
its 15
detractors 15
said 15
it 15
looked 15
like 15
a 15
victorian 15
privy 15
its 15
supporters 15
said 15
it 15
gave 15
the 15
town 15
a 15
good 15
solid 15
respectable 15
look 15
and 15
no 15
stranger 15
would 15
ever 15
suspect 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
full 15
of 15
niggers 15
as 15
we 15
walked 15
up 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
we 15
saw 15
a 15
solitary 15
light 15
burning 15
in 15
the 15
distance 15
thats 15
funny 15

down 15

was 15
sitting 15
in 15
one 15
of 15
his 15
office 15
chairs 15
and 15
he 15
was 15
reading 15
oblivious 15
of 15
the 15
nightbugs 15
dancing 15
over 15
his 15

we 15
were 15
taking 15
a 15
short 15
cut 15
across 15
the 15
square 15
when 15
four 15
dusty 15
cars 15
came 15
in 15
from 15
the 15
meridian 15
highway 15
moving 15
slowly 15
in 15
a 15
line 15
they 15
went 15
around 15
the 15
square 15
passed 15
the 15
bank 15
building 15
and 15
stopped 15
in 15

atticus 15
look 15
up 15
from 15
his 15
newspaper 15
he 15
closed 15
it 15
folded 15
it 15
deliberately 15
dropped 15
it 15
in 15
his 15
lap 15
and 15
pushed 15
his 15
hat 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15
head 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
expecting 15
them 15
come 15
on 15
whispered 15
jem 15
we 15
streaked 15
across 15
the 15
square 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
until 15
we 15
were 15

shapes 15
moving 15
toward 15
the 15

up 15
in 15
obedience 15
to 15
my 15
father 15
there 15
followed 15
what 15
i 15
later 15
realized 15
was 15
a 15
sickeningly 15
comic 15
aspect 15
of 15
an 15
unfunny 15
situation 15
the 15
men 15
talked 15
in 15
nearwhispers 15

walter 15
atticus 15
said 15
pleasantly 15
heck 15
tates 15
around 15
somewhere 15
the 15
hell 15
he 15
is 15
said 15

man 15
hecks 15

deep 15
in 15
the 15
woods 15
they 15
wont 15

em 15
off 15
on 15
a 15
snipe 15
hunt 15
was 15
the 15
succinct 15
answer 15
didnt 15
you 15
think 15
athat 15
mr 15
finch 15
thought 15
about 15
it 15
but 15
didnt 15
believe 15
it 15
well 15
then 15
my 15
fathers 15
voice 15
was 15
still 15
the 15
same 15
that 15
changes 15
things 15
doesnt 15
it 15
it 15
do 15
another 15
deep 15
voice 15
said 15
its 15
owner 15
was 15
a 15
shadow 15
do 15
you 15
really 15
think 15
so 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
second 15
time 15
i 15
heard 15
atticus 15
ask 15
that 15
question 15
in 15
two 15
days 15
and 15
it 15
meant 15
somebodys 15
man 15
would 15
get 15
jumped 15
this 15
was 15
too 15
good 15
to 15
miss 15
i 15
broke 15
away 15
from 15
jem 15
and 15
ran 15
as 15
fast 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
to 15
atticus 15
jem 15
shrieked 15
and 15
tried 15
to 15
catch 15
me 15
but 15
i 15
had 15
a 15
lead 15
on 15
him 15
and 15
dill 15
i 15
pushed 15
my 15
way 15
through 15
dark 15
smelly 15
bodies 15
and 15
burst 15
into 15
the 15
circle 15
of 15
light 15
hey 15
atticus 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
would 15
have 15
a 15
fine 15
surprise 15
but 15
his 15
face 15
killed 15
my 15
joy 15
a 15
flash 15
of 15
plain 15
fear 15
was 15
going 15
out 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
but 15
returned 15
when 15
dill 15
and 15
jem 15
wriggled 15
into 15
the 15
light 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
smell 15
of 15
stale 15
whiskey 15
and 15
pigpen 15
about 15
and 15
when 15
i 15
glanced 15
around 15
i 15
discovered 15
that 15
these 15
men 15
were 15
strangers 15
they 15
were 15
not 15
the 15
people 15
i 15
saw 15
last 15
night 15
hot 15
embarrassment 15
shot 15
through 15
me 15
i 15
had 15
leaped 15
triumphantly 15
into 15
a 15
ring 15
of 15
people 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
before 15
atticus 15
got 15
up 15
from 15
his 15
chair 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
moving 15
slowly 15
like 15
an 15
old 15
man 15
he 15
put 15
the 15
newspaper 15
down 15
very 15
carefully 15
adjusting 15
its 15
creases 15
with 15
lingering 15
fingers 15
they 15
were 15
trembling 15
a 15
little 15
go 15
home 15
jem 15
he 15
said 15
take 15
scout 15
and 15
dill 15
home 15
we 15
were 15
accustomed 15
to 15
prompt 15
if 15
not 15
always 15
cheerful 15
acquiescence 15
to 15
atticuss 15
instructions 15
but 15
from 15
the 15
way 15
he 15
stood 15
jem 15
was 15
not 15
thinking 15
of 15
budging 15
go 15
home 15
i 15
said 15
jem 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
as 15
atticuss 15
fists 15
went 15
to 15
his 15
hips 15
so 15
did 15
jems 15
and 15
as 15
they 15
faced 15
each 15
other 15
i 15
could 15
see 15
little 15
resemblance 15
between 15
them 15
jems 15
soft 15
brown 15
hair 15
and 15
eyes 15
his 15
oval 15
face 15
and 15
snugfitting 15
ears 15
were 15
our 15
mothers 15
contrasting 15
oddly 15
with 15
atticuss 15
graying 15
black 15
hair 15
and 15
squarecut 15
features 15
but 15
they 15
were 15
somehow 15
alike 15
mutual 15
defiance 15
made 15
them 15
alike 15
son 15
i 15
said 15
go 15
home 15
jem 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
ill 15
send 15
him 15
home 15
a 15
burly 15
man 15
said 15
and 15
grabbed 15
jem 15
roughly 15
by 15
the 15
collar 15
he 15
yanked 15
jem 15
nearly 15
off 15
his 15
feet 15
dont 15
you 15
touch 15
him 15
i 15
kicked 15
the 15
man 15
swiftly 15
barefooted 15
i 15
was 15
surprised 15
to 15
see 15
him 15
fall 15
back 15
in 15
real 15
pain 15
i 15
intended 15
to 15
kick 15
his 15
shin 15
but 15
aimed 15
too 15
high 15
thatll 15
do 15
scout 15
atticus 15
put 15
his 15
hand 15
on 15
my 15
shoulder 15
dont 15
kick 15
folks 15
no 15
he 15
said 15
as 15
i 15
was 15
pleading 15
justification 15
aint 15
nobody 15
gonna 15
do 15
jem 15
that 15
way 15
i 15
said 15
all 15
right 15
mr 15
finch 15
get 15
em 15
outa 15
here 15
someone 15
growled 15
you 15
got 15
fifteen 15
seconds 15
to 15
get 15
em 15
outa 15
here 15
in 15
the 15
midst 15
of 15
this 15
strange 15
assembly 15
atticus 15
stood 15
trying 15
to 15
make 15
jem 15
mind 15
him 15
i 15
aint 15
going 15
was 15
his 15
steady 15
answer 15
to 15
atticuss 15
threats 15
requests 15
and 15
finally 15
please 15
jem 15
take 15
them 15
home 15
i 15
was 15
getting 15
a 15
bit 15
tired 15
of 15
that 15
but 15
felt 15
jem 15
had 15
his 15
own 15
reasons 15
for 15
doing 15
as 15
he 15
did 15
in 15
view 15
of 15
his 15
prospects 15
once 15
atticus 15
did 15
get 15
him 15
home 15
i 15
looked 15
around 15
the 15
crowd 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
summers 15
night 15
but 15
the 15
men 15
were 15
dressed 15
most 15
of 15
them 15
in 15
overalls 15
and 15
denim 15
shirts 15
buttoned 15
up 15
to 15
the 15
collars 15
i 15
thought 15
they 15
must 15
be 15
coldnatured 15
as 15
their 15
sleeves 15
were 15
unrolled 15
and 15
buttoned 15
at 15
the 15
cuffs 15
some 15
wore 15
hats 15
pulled 15
firmly 15
down 15
over 15
their 15
ears 15
they 15
were 15
sullenlooking 15
sleepyeyed 15
men 15
who 15
seemed 15
unused 15
to 15
late 15
hours 15
i 15
sought 15
once 15
more 15
for 15
a 15
familiar 15
face 15
and 15
at 15
the 15
center 15
of 15
the 15
semicircle 15
i 15
found 15
one 15
hey 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
the 15
man 15
did 15
not 15
hear 15
me 15
it 15
seemed 15
hey 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
hows 15
your 15
entailment 15
gettin 15
along 15
mr 15
walter 15
cunninghams 15
legal 15
affairs 15
were 15
well 15
known 15
to 15
me 15
atticus 15
had 15
once 15
described 15
them 15
at 15
length 15
the 15
big 15
man 15
blinked 15
and 15
hooked 15
his 15
thumbs 15
in 15
his 15
overall 15
straps 15
he 15
seemed 15
uncomfortable 15
he 15
cleared 15
his 15
throat 15
and 15
looked 15
away 15
my 15
friendly 15
overture 15
had 15
fallen 15
flat 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
wore 15
no 15
hat 15
and 15
the 15
top 15
half 15
of 15
his 15
forehead 15
was 15
white 15
in 15
contrast 15
to 15
his 15
sunscorched 15
face 15
which 15
led 15
me 15
to 15
believe 15
that 15
he 15
wore 15
one 15
most 15
days 15
he 15
shifted 15
his 15
feet 15
clad 15
in 15
heavy 15
work 15
shoes 15
dont 15
you 15
remember 15
me 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
im 15
jean 15
louise 15
finch 15
you 15
brought 15
us 15
some 15
hickory 15
nuts 15
one 15
time 15
remember 15
i 15
began 15
to 15
sense 15
the 15
futility 15
one 15
feels 15
when 15
unacknowledged 15
by 15
a 15
chance 15
acquaintance 15
i 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
with 15
walter 15
i 15
began 15
again 15
hes 15
your 15
boy 15
aint 15
he 15
aint 15
he 15
sir 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
was 15
moved 15
to 15
a 15
faint 15
nod 15
he 15
did 15
know 15
me 15
after 15
all 15
hes 15
in 15
my 15
grade 15
i 15
said 15
and 15
he 15
does 15
right 15
well 15
hes 15
a 15
good 15
boy 15
i 15
added 15
a 15
real 15
nice 15
boy 15
we 15
brought 15
him 15
home 15
for 15
dinner 15
one 15
time 15
maybe 15
he 15
told 15
you 15
about 15
me 15
i 15
beat 15
him 15
up 15
one 15
time 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
real 15
nice 15
about 15
it 15
tell 15
him 15
hey 15
for 15
me 15
wont 15
you 15
atticus 15
had 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
the 15
polite 15
thing 15
to 15
talk 15
to 15
people 15
about 15
what 15
they 15
were 15
interested 15
in 15
not 15
about 15
what 15
you 15
were 15
interested 15
in 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
displayed 15
no 15
interest 15
in 15
his 15
son 15
so 15
i 15
tackled 15
his 15
entailment 15
once 15
more 15
in 15
a 15
lastditch 15
effort 15
to 15
make 15
him 15
feel 15
at 15
home 15
entailments 15
are 15
bad 15
i 15
was 15
advising 15
him 15
when 15
i 15
slowly 15
awoke 15
to 15
the 15
fact 15
that 15
i 15
was 15
addressing 15
the 15
entire 15
aggregation 15
the 15
men 15
were 15
all 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
some 15
had 15
their 15
mouths 15
halfopen 15
atticus 15
had 15
stopped 15
poking 15
at 15
jem 15
they 15
were 15
standing 15
together 15
beside 15
dill 15
their 15
attention 15
amounted 15
to 15
fascination 15
atticuss 15
mouth 15
even 15
was 15
halfopen 15
an 15
attitude 15
he 15
had 15
once 15
described 15
as 15
uncouth 15
our 15
eyes 15
met 15
and 15
he 15
shut 15
it 15
well 15
atticus 15
i 15
was 15
just 15
sayin 15
to 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
that 15
entailments 15
are 15
bad 15
an 15
all 15
that 15
but 15
you 15
said 15
not 15
to 15
worry 15
it 15
takes 15
a 15
long 15
time 15
sometimes 15
that 15
you 15
alld 15
ride 15
it 15
out 15
together 15
i 15
was 15
slowly 15
drying 15
up 15
wondering 15
what 15
idiocy 15
i 15
had 15
committed 15
entailments 15
seemed 15
all 15
right 15
enough 15
for 15
livingroom 15
talk 15
i 15
began 15
to 15
feel 15
sweat 15
gathering 15
at 15
the 15
edges 15
of 15
my 15
hair 15
i 15
could 15
stand 15
anything 15
but 15
a 15
bunch 15
of 15
people 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
they 15
were 15
quite 15
still 15
whats 15
the 15
matter 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
said 15
nothing 15
i 15
looked 15
around 15
and 15
up 15
at 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
whose 15
face 15
was 15
equally 15
impassive 15
then 15
he 15
did 15
a 15
peculiar 15
thing 15
he 15
squatted 15
down 15
and 15
took 15
me 15
by 15
both 15
shoulders 15
ill 15

goingover 15
and 15

mr 15
finch 15
a 15
soft 15
husky 15
voice 15

from 15

my 15
bedtime 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
growing 15
quite 15
tired 15

seemed 15
that 15
atticus 15
and 15
mr 15
underwood 15
would 15
talk 15
for 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
the 15
night 15
mr 15
underwood 15
out 15
the 15
window 15
and 15
atticus 15
up 15
at 15
him 15
finally 15
atticus 15
returned 15
switched 15
off 15
the 15
light 15
above 15
the 15
jail 15
door 15
and 15
picked 15
up 15
his 15
chair 15

i 15
carry 15
it 15
for 15
you 15
mr 15

word 15
the 15
whole 15

toward 15
the 15
office 15
dill 15
and 15
i 15
fell 15
into 15
step 15
behind 15
atticus 15
and 15
jem 15
dill 15
was 15
encumbered 15
by 15
the 15
chair 15
and 15
his 15
pace 15
was 15
slower 15
atticus 15
and 15
jem 15
were 15
well 15
ahead 15
of 15
us 15
and 15
i 15
assumed 15
that 15
atticus 15
was 15
giving 15
him 15
hell 15
for 15
not 15
going 15
home 15
but 15
i 15
was 15
wrong 15
as 15
they 15
passed 15
under 15
a 15
streetlight 15
atticus 15
reached 15
out 15
and 15
massaged 15
jems 15
hair 15
his 15
one 15
gesture 15
of 15
affection 15
jem 15
heard 15
me 15
he 15
thrust 15
his 15
head 15
around 15
the 15
connecting 15
door 15
as 15
he 15
came 15
to 15
my 15
bed 15
atticuss 15
light 15
flashed 15
on 15
we 15
stayed 15
where 15
we 15
were 15
until 15
it 15
went 15
off 15
we 15
heard 15
him 15
turn 15
over 15
and 15
we 15
waited 15
until 15
he 15
was 15
still 15
again 15
jem 15
took 15
me 15
to 15
his 15
room 15
and 15
put 15
me 15
in 15
bed 15
beside 15
him 15
try 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
sleep 15
he 15
said 15
itll 15
be 15
all 15
over 15
after 15
tomorrow 15
maybe 15
we 15
had 15
come 15
in 15
quietly 15
so 15
as 15
not 15
to 15
wake 15
aunty 15
atticus 15
killed 15
the 15
engine 15
in 15
the 15
driveway 15
and 15
coasted 15
to 15
the 15
carhouse 15
we 15
went 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
door 15
and 15
to 15
our 15
rooms 15
without 15
a 15
word 15
i 15
was 15
very 15
tired 15
and 15
was 15
drifting 15
into 15
sleep 15
when 15
the 15
memory 15
of 15
atticus 15
calmly 15
folding 15
his 15
newspaper 15
and 15
pushing 15
back 15
his 15
hat 15
became 15
atticus 15
standing 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
an 15
empty 15
waiting 15
street 15
pushing 15
up 15
his 15
glasses 15
the 15
full 15
meaning 15
of 15
the 15
nights 15
events 15
hit 15
me 15
and 15
i 15
began 15
crying 15
jem 15
was 15
awfully 15
nice 15
about 15
it 15
for 15
once 15
he 15
didnt 15
remind 15
me 15
that 15
people 15
nearly 15
nine 15
years 15
old 15

everybodys 15
appetite 15

delicate 15
this 15
morning 15
except 15
jems 15
he 15
ate 15
his 15
way 15
through 15
three 15
eggs 15
atticus 15
watched 15
in 15
frank 15
admiration 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
sipped 15
coffee 15
and 15
radiated 15
waves 15
of 15
disapproval 15
children 15
who 15
slipped 15
out 15
at 15
night 15
were 15
a 15
disgrace 15
to 15
the 15
family 15
atticus 15
said 15
he 15
was 15
right 15
glad 15
his 15
disgraces 15
had 15
come 15
along 15

intense 15
profane 15
little 15
man 15
whose 15

poured 15
one 15
tablespoonful 15
of 15

into 15
it 15
and 15

and 15

but 15
she 15
was 15
frowning 15
at 15
atticus 15
she 15
waited 15
until 15
calpurnia 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
then 15
she 15

braxton 15
underwood 15

it 15
i 15
was 15
beginning 15
to 15
notice 15
a 15
subtle 15
change 15
in 15
my 15
father 15
these 15
days 15
that 15
came 15
out 15
when 15
he 15
talked 15
with 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
quiet 15
digging 15
in 15
never 15
outright 15
irritation 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
faint 15
starchiness 15
in 15
his 15
voice 15
when 15
he 15
said 15
anything 15
fit 15
to 15
say 15
at 15
the 15
tables 15
fit 15
to 15
say 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
calpurnia 15
she 15
knows 15
what 15
she 15
means 15
to 15
this 15
family 15
i 15
dont 15
think 15
its 15
a 15
good 15
habit 15
atticus 15
it 15
encourages 15
them 15
you 15
know 15
how 15
they 15
talk 15
among 15
themselves 15
every 15
thing 15
that 15
happens 15
in 15
this 15
towns 15
out 15
to 15
the 15

before 15
sundown 15
my 15

put 15
down 15
his 15
knife 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
of 15
any 15
law 15
that 15
says 15
they 15
cant 15
talk 15
maybe 15
if 15
we 15
didnt 15
give 15
them 15
so 15
much 15
to 15
talk 15
about 15

knife 15
and 15
pushed 15
his 15
plate 15
aside 15
mr 15
cunninghams 15
basically 15
a 15
good 15
man 15

when 15
he 15
first 15

he 15
might 15
have 15
hurt 15
me 15
a 15
little 15
atticus 15
conceded 15
but 15
son 15
youll 15
understand 15
folks 15
a 15
little 15
better 15
when 15
youre 15

a 15
mobs 15
always 15
made 15
up 15
of 15
people 15
no 15

what 15
mr 15
cunningham 15
was 15
part 15
of 15
a 15
mob 15
last 15
night 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
still 15
a 15
man 15
every 15
mob 15
in 15
every 15
little 15
southern 15
town 15
is 15
always 15
made 15
up 15

it 15
ill 15

jem 15

it 15

an 15
eightyearold 15
child 15
to 15
bring 15
em 15

it 15

that 15
a 15
gang 15
of 15
wild 15
animals 15

be 15
stopped 15
simply 15
because 15
theyre 15
still 15
human 15
hmp 15

a 15
minute 15

hoped 15
jem 15
would 15

little 15
better 15
when 15
he 15

an 15
odd 15
thing 15
about 15
miss 15
maudie 15
on 15
her 15
porch 15
she 15
was 15
too 15
far 15
away 15
for 15
us 15
to 15
see 15
her 15
features 15
clearly 15
but 15
we 15
could 15
always 15
catch 15
her 15
mood 15
by 15
the 15
way 15
she 15
stood 15
she 15
was 15
now 15
standing 15
arms 15
akimbo 15
her 15
shoulders 15
drooping 15
a 15
little 15
her 15
head 15
cocked 15
to 15
one 15
side 15
her 15
glasses 15
winking 15

the 15
sunlight 15
we 15
knew 15
she 15
wore 15
a 15
grin 15
of 15
the 15
uttermost 15
wickedness 15
the 15
driver 15
of 15
the 15
wagon 15
slowed 15
down 15
his 15
mules 15

shrillvoiced 15

quoting 15
scripture 15
for 15
his 15
own 15
purposes 15
as 15
the 15
driver 15
speeded 15
his 15
mules 15
why 15
they 15
objected 15
to 15
miss 15

of 15
newspaper 15

and 15
wrapping 15
paper 15
children 15
came 15
to 15
mothers 15
babies 15
were 15
cradled 15
on 15
hips 15
as 15
men 15
in 15
sweatstained 15
hats 15
collected 15
their 15
families 15
and 15
herded 15
them 15
through 15
the 15
courthouse 15
doors 15
in 15
the 15
far 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
square 15
the 15
negroes 15
and 15
mr 15
dolphus 15
raymond 15
stood 15
up 15
and 15
dusted 15
their 15
breeches 15
there 15
were 15
few 15
women 15
and 15
children 15
among 15
them 15
which 15
seemed 15
to 15
dispel 15
the 15
holiday 15
mood 15
they 15
waited 15
patiently 15
at 15
the 15
doors 15
behind 15
the 15
white 15
families 15
lets 15
go 15

not 15
like 15
it 15
if 15
he 15
sees 15
us 15
said 15
jem 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
courthouse 15
was 15
faintly 15
reminiscent 15
of 15
arlington 15
in 15
one 15
respect 15
the 15
concrete 15
pillars 15
supporting 15
its 15
south 15
roof 15
were 15
too 15
heavy 15
for 15
their 15
light 15
burden 15
the 15
pillars 15
were 15
all 15
that 15
remained 15
standing 15
when 15
the 15
original 15
courthouse 15
burned 15
in 15
another 15
courthouse 15
was 15
built 15
around 15
them 15
it 15
is 15
better 15
to 15
say 15
built 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
them 15
but 15
for 15
the 15
south 15
porch 15
the 15
maycomb 15
county 15
courthouse 15
was 15
early 15
victorian 15
presenting 15
an 15
unoffensive 15
vista 15
when 15
seen 15
from 15
the 15
north 15
from 15
the 15
other 15
side 15
however 15
greek 15
revival 15
columns 15
clashed 15
with 15
a 15
big 15
nineteenthcentury 15
clock 15
tower 15
housing 15
a 15
rusty 15
unreliable 15
instrument 15
a 15
view 15
indicating 15
a 15
people 15
determined 15
to 15
preserve 15
every 15
physical 15
scrap 15
of 15
the 15
past 15
to 15
reach 15
the 15
courtroom 15
on 15
the 15
second 15
floor 15
one 15
passed 15

the 15
judge 15
of 15
probate 15
lived 15
in 15
cool 15
dim 15
hutches 15
that 15
smelled 15
of 15
decaying 15
record 15
books 15
mingled 15
with 15
old 15
damp 15
cement 15
and 15
stale 15
urine 15
it 15
was 15
necessary 15
to 15
turn 15
on 15
the 15
lights 15
in 15
the 15
daytime 15
there 15
was 15
always 15
a 15
film 15
of 15
dust 15
on 15
the 15
rough 15
floorboards 15
the 15
inhabitants 15
of 15
these 15
offices 15
were 15
creatures 15
of 15
their 15
environment 15
little 15
grayfaced 15
men 15
they 15
seemed 15
untouched 15
by 15
wind 15
or 15
sun 15
we 15
knew 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
crowd 15
but 15
we 15
had 15
not 15
bargained 15
for 15
the 15
multitudes 15
in 15
the 15
firstfloor 15
hallway 15
i 15
got 15
separated 15
from 15
jem 15
and 15
dill 15
but 15
made 15
my 15
way 15
toward 15
the 15
wall 15
by 15
the 15
stairwell 15
knowing 15
jem 15
would 15
come 15
for 15
me 15
eventually 15
i 15
found 15
myself 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
the 15
idlers 15
club 15
and 15
made 15
myself 15
as 15
unobtrusive 15
as 15
possible 15
this 15
was 15
a 15
group 15
of 15
whiteshirted 15
khakitrousered 15
suspendered 15
old 15
men 15
who 15
had 15
spent 15
their 15
lives 15
doing 15
nothing 15
and 15
passed 15
their 15
twilight 15
days 15
doing 15
same 15
on 15
pine 15
benches 15
under 15
the 15
live 15
oaks 15
on 15
the 15
square 15
attentive 15
critics 15
of 15
courthouse 15
business 15
atticus 15
said 15
they 15
knew 15
as 15
much 15
law 15
as 15
the 15
chief 15
justice 15
from 15
long 15
years 15
of 15
observation 15
normally 15
they 15
were 15
the 15
courts 15
only 15
spectators 15
and 15
today 15
they 15
seemed 15
resentful 15
of 15
the 15
interruption 15
of 15
their 15
comfortable 15
routine 15
when 15
they 15
spoke 15
their 15
voices 15
sounded 15
casually 15
important 15
the 15
conversation 15
was 15
about 15
my 15
father 15
thinks 15
he 15
knows 15
what 15
hes 15
doing 15
one 15
said 15
ohh 15
now 15
i 15
wouldnt 15
say 15
that 15
said 15
another 15
atticus 15
finchs 15
a 15
deep 15
reader 15
a 15
mighty 15
deep 15
reader 15
he 15
reads 15
all 15
right 15
thats 15
all 15
he 15
does 15
the 15
club 15
snickered 15
lemme 15
tell 15
you 15
somethin 15
now 15
billy 15
a 15
third 15
said 15
you 15
know 15
the 15
court 15
appointed 15
him 15
to 15
defend 15
this 15
nigger 15
yeah 15
but 15
atticus 15
aims 15
to 15
defend 15
him 15
thats 15
what 15
i 15
dont 15
like 15
about 15
it 15
this 15
was 15
news 15
news 15
that 15
put 15
a 15
different 15
light 15
on 15
things 15
atticus 15
had 15
to 15
whether 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
or 15
not 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
odd 15
that 15
he 15
hadnt 15
said 15
anything 15
to 15
us 15
about 15
it 15
we 15
could 15
have 15
used 15
it 15
many 15
times 15
in 15
defending 15
him 15
and 15
ourselves 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
thats 15
why 15
he 15
was 15
doing 15
it 15
equaled 15
fewer 15
fights 15
and 15
less 15
fussing 15
but 15
did 15
that 15
explain 15
the 15
towns 15
attitude 15
the 15
court 15
appointed 15
atticus 15
to 15
defend 15
him 15
atticus 15
aimed 15
to 15
defend 15
him 15
thats 15
what 15
they 15
didnt 15
like 15
about 15
it 15
it 15
was 15
confusing 15
the 15
negroes 15
having 15
waited 15
for 15
the 15
white 15
people 15
to 15
go 15
upstairs 15
began 15
to 15
come 15
in 15
whoa 15

just 15
a 15
minute 15

upstairs 15
the 15
old 15
men 15

his 15
way 15
upstairs 15

a 15
few 15
moments 15
he 15
was 15

sped 15
ahead 15
of 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
to 15
the 15
courtroom 15
floor 15
there 15
we 15
went 15
up 15
a 15
covered 15
staircase 15
and 15
waited 15
at 15
the 15
door 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
came 15
puffing 15
behind 15
us 15
and 15
steered 15
us 15
gently 15
through 15
the 15
black 15
people 15
in 15
the 15
balcony 15
four 15
negroes 15
rose 15
and 15
gave 15
us 15
their 15
frontrow 15
seats 15
the 15
colored 15
balcony 15
ran 15
along 15
three 15
walls 15
of 15
the 15
courtroom 15
like 15
a 15
secondstory 15
veranda 15
and 15
from 15
it 15
we 15
could 15
see 15
everything 15
the 15
jury 15
sat 15
to 15
the 15
left 15
under 15
long 15
windows 15
sunburned 15
lanky 15
they 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
all 15
farmers 15
but 15
this 15
was 15
natural 15
townfolk 15
rarely 15
sat 15
on 15
juries 15
they 15
were 15
either 15
struck 15
or 15
excused 15
one 15
or 15
two 15
of 15
the 15
jury 15
looked 15
vaguely 15
like 15
dressedup 15
cunninghams 15
at 15
this 15
stage 15
they 15
sat 15
straight 15
and 15
alert 15
the 15
circuit 15
solicitor 15
and 15
another 15
man 15
atticus 15
and 15
tom 15
robinson 15
sat 15
at 15
tables 15
with 15
their 15
backs 15
to 15
us 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
brown 15
book 15
and 15
some 15
yellow 15
tablets 15
on 15
the 15
solicitors 15
table 15
atticuss 15
was 15
bare 15
just 15
inside 15
the 15
railing 15
that 15
divided 15
the 15
spectators 15
from 15
the 15
court 15
the 15
witnesses 15
sat 15
on 15
cowhidebottomed 15
chairs 15
their 15
backs 15
were 15
to 15
us 15
judge 15
taylor 15
was 15
on 15
the 15
bench 15
looking 15
like 15
a 15
sleepy 15
old 15
shark 15
his 15
pilot 15
fish 15
writing 15
rapidly 15
below 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
him 15
judge 15
taylor 15
looked 15
like 15
most 15
judges 15
i 15
had 15
ever 15
seen 15
amiable 15
whitehaired 15
slightly 15
ruddyfaced 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
man 15
who 15
ran 15
his 15
court 15
with 15
an 15
alarming 15
informality 15
he 15
sometimes 15
propped 15
his 15
feet 15
up 15
he 15
often 15
cleaned 15
his 15
fingernails 15
with 15
his 15
pocket 15
knife 15
in 15
long 15
equity 15
hearings 15
especially 15
after 15
dinner 15
he 15
gave 15
the 15
impression 15
of 15
dozing 15
an 15
impression 15
dispelled 15
forever 15
when 15
a 15
lawyer 15
once 15
deliberately 15
pushed 15
a 15
pile 15
of 15
books 15
to 15
the 15
floor 15
in 15
a 15
desperate 15
effort 15
to 15
wake 15
him 15
up 15
without 15
opening 15
his 15
eyes 15
judge 15
taylor 15
murmured 15
mr 15
whitley 15
do 15
that 15
again 15
and 15
itll 15
cost 15
you 15
one 15
hundred 15
dollars 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
man 15
learned 15
in 15
the 15
law 15
and 15
although 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
take 15
his 15
job 15
casually 15
in 15
reality 15
he 15
kept 15
a 15
firm 15
grip 15
on 15
any 15
proceedings 15
that 15
came 15
before 15
him 15
only 15
once 15
was 15
judge 15
taylor 15
ever 15
seen 15
at 15
a 15
dead 15
standstill 15
in 15
open 15
court 15
and 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
stopped 15
him 15
old 15
sarum 15
their 15
stamping 15
grounds 15
was 15
populated 15
by 15
two 15
families 15
separate 15
and 15
apart 15
in 15
the 15
beginning 15
but 15
unfortunately 15
bearing 15
the 15
same 15
name 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
married 15
the 15
coninghams 15
until 15
the 15
spelling 15
of 15
the 15
names 15
was 15
academic 15
academic 15
until 15
a 15
cunningham 15
disputed 15
a 15
coningham 15
over 15
land 15
titles 15
and 15
took 15
to 15
the 15
law 15
during 15
a 15
controversy 15
of 15
this 15
character 15
jeems 15
cunningham 15
testified 15
that 15
his 15
mother 15
spelled 15
it 15
cunningham 15
on 15
deeds 15
and 15
things 15
but 15
she 15
was 15
really 15
a 15
coningham 15
she 15
was 15
an 15
uncertain 15
speller 15
a 15
seldom 15
reader 15
and 15
was 15
given 15
to 15
looking 15
far 15
away 15
sometimes 15
when 15
she 15
sat 15
on 15
the 15
front 15
gallery 15
in 15
the 15
evening 15
after 15
nine 15
hours 15
of 15
listening 15
to 15
the 15
eccentricities 15
of 15
old 15
sarums 15
inhabitants 15
judge 15
taylor 15
threw 15
the 15
case 15
out 15
of 15
court 15
when 15
asked 15
upon 15
what 15
grounds 15
judge 15
taylor 15
said 15
champertous 15
connivance 15
and 15
declared 15
he 15
hoped 15
to 15
god 15
the 15
litigants 15
were 15
satisfied 15
by 15
each 15
having 15
had 15
their 15
public 15
say 15
they 15
were 15
that 15
was 15
all 15
they 15
had 15
wanted 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
judge 15
taylor 15
had 15
one 15
interesting 15
habit 15
he 15
permitted 15
smoking 15
in 15
his 15
courtroom 15
but 15
did 15
not 15
himself 15
indulge 15
sometimes 15
if 15
one 15
was 15
lucky 15
one 15
had 15
the 15
privilege 15
of 15
watching 15
him 15
put 15
a 15
long 15
dry 15
cigar 15
into 15
his 15
mouth 15
and 15
munch 15
it 15
slowly 15
up 15
bit 15
by 15
bit 15
the 15
dead 15
cigar 15
would 15
disappear 15
to 15
reappear 15
some 15
hours 15
later 15
as 15
a 15
flat 15
slick 15
mess 15
its 15
essence 15
extracted 15
and 15
mingling 15
with 15
judge 15
taylors 15
digestive 15
juices 15
i 15
once 15
asked 15
atticus 15
how 15
mrs 15
taylor 15
stood 15
to 15
kiss 15
him 15
but 15
atticus 15
said 15
they 15
didnt 15
kiss 15
much 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
was 15
to 15
the 15
right 15
of 15
judge 15
taylor 15
and 15
when 15
we 15
got 15
to 15
our 15
seats 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
was 15
already 15
on 15

jem 15
mr 15

tates 15
testifyin 15
mr 15
tate 15
had 15
dressed 15
for 15
the 15
occasion 15
he 15
wore 15
an 15
ordinary 15
business 15
suit 15
which 15
made 15
him 15
look 15
somehow 15
like 15
every 15
other 15
man 15
gone 15
were 15
his 15
high 15
boots 15
lumber 15
jacket 15
and 15
bulletstudded 15
belt 15
from 15
that 15
moment 15
he 15
ceased 15
to 15
terrify 15
me 15
he 15
was 15
sitting 15
forward 15
in 15
the 15
witness 15
chair 15
his 15
hands 15
clasped 15
between 15
his 15
knees 15
listening 15
attentively 15
to 15
the 15
circuit 15
solicitor 15
the 15
solicitor 15
a 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
was 15
not 15
well 15
known 15
to 15
us 15
he 15
was 15
from 15
abbottsville 15
we 15
saw 15
him 15
only 15
when 15
court 15
convened 15
and 15
that 15
rarely 15
for 15
court 15
was 15
of 15
no 15
special 15
interest 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
a 15
balding 15
smoothfaced 15
man 15
he 15
could 15
have 15
been 15
anywhere 15
between 15
forty 15
and 15
sixty 15
although 15
his 15
back 15
was 15
to 15
us 15
we 15
knew 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
slight 15
cast 15
in 15
one 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
which 15
he 15
used 15
to 15
his 15
advantage 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
looking 15
at 15
a 15
person 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
actually 15
doing 15
nothing 15
of 15
the 15
kind 15
thus 15
he 15
was 15
hell 15
on 15
juries 15
and 15
witnesses 15
the 15
jury 15
thinking 15
themselves 15
under 15
close 15
scrutiny 15
paid 15
attention 15
so 15
did 15
the 15

on 15
another 15
question 15

atticus 15
dryly 15
and 15
mr 15
tate 15
fell 15
silent 15
atticus 15
sat 15
down 15
and 15
nodded 15
to 15
the 15
circuit 15
solicitor 15
who 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
at 15
the 15
judge 15
who 15
nodded 15
to 15
mr 15
tate 15
who 15
rose 15
stiffly 15
and 15
stepped 15
down 15
from 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
below 15
us 15
heads 15
turned 15
feet 15
scraped 15
the 15
floor 15
babies 15
were 15
shifted 15
to 15
shoulders 15
and 15
a 15
few 15
children 15
scampered 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
courtroom 15
the 15
negroes 15
behind 15
us 15
whispered 15
softly 15
among 15
themselves 15
dill 15
was 15
asking 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
what 15
it 15
was 15
all 15
about 15
but 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
said 15
he 15
didnt 15
know 15
so 15
far 15
things 15
were 15
utterly 15
dull 15
nobody 15
had 15
thundered 15
there 15
were 15
no 15
arguments 15
between 15
opposing 15
counsel 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
drama 15
a 15
grave 15
disappointment 15
to 15
all 15
present 15
it 15
seemed 15
atticus 15
was 15
proceeding 15
amiably 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
involved 15
in 15
a 15
title 15
dispute 15
with 15
his 15
infinite 15
capacity 15
for 15
calming 15
turbulent 15
seas 15
he 15
could 15
make 15
a 15
rape 15
case 15
as 15
dry 15
as 15
a 15
sermon 15
gone 15
was 15
the 15
terror 15
in 15
my 15
mind 15
of 15
stale 15
whiskey 15
and 15
barnyard 15
smells 15
of 15
sleepyeyed 15
sullen 15
men 15
of 15
a 15
husky 15
voice 15
calling 15
in 15
the 15
night 15
mr 15
finch 15
they 15
gone 15
our 15
nightmare 15
had 15
gone 15
with 15
daylight 15
everything 15
would 15
come 15
out 15
all 15
right 15
all 15
the 15
spectators 15
were 15
as 15
relaxed 15
as 15
judge 15
taylor 15
except 15
jem 15
his 15
mouth 15
was 15
twisted 15
into 15
a 15
purposeful 15
halfgrin 15
and 15
his 15
eyes 15
happy 15
about 15
and 15
he 15
said 15
something 15
about 15
corroborating 15
evidence 15
which 15
made 15
me 15
sure 15
he 15
was 15
showing 15
off 15
robert 15
e 15
lee 15
ewell 15
in 15
answer 15
to 15
the 15
clerks 15
booming 15
voice 15
a 15
little 15
bantam 15
cock 15
of 15
a 15
man 15
rose 15
and 15
strutted 15
to 15
the 15
stand 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15
neck 15
reddening 15
at 15
the 15
sound 15
of 15
his 15
name 15
when 15
he 15
turned 15
around 15
to 15
take 15
the 15
oath 15
we 15
saw 15
that 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
as 15
red 15
as 15
his 15
neck 15
we 15
also 15
saw 15
no 15
resemblance 15
to 15
his 15
namesake 15
a 15
shock 15
of 15
wispy 15
newwashed 15
hair 15
stood 15
up 15
from 15
his 15
forehead 15
his 15
nose 15
was 15
thin 15
pointed 15
and 15
shiny 15
he 15
had 15
no 15
chin 15
to 15
speak 15
of 15
it 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
part 15
of 15
his 15
crepey 15
neck 15
so 15
help 15
me 15
god 15
he 15
crowed 15
every 15
town 15
the 15
size 15
of 15
maycomb 15
had 15
families 15
like 15
the 15
ewells 15
no 15
economic 15
fluctuations 15
changed 15
their 15
status 15
people 15
like 15
the 15
ewells 15
lived 15
as 15
guests 15
of 15
the 15
county 15
in 15
prosperity 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
in 15
the 15
depths 15
of 15
a 15
depression 15
no 15
truant 15
officers 15
could 15
keep 15
their 15
numerous 15
offspring 15
in 15
school 15
no 15
public 15
health 15
officer 15
could 15
free 15
them 15
from 15
congenital 15
defects 15
various 15
worms 15
and 15
the 15
diseases 15
indigenous 15
to 15
filthy 15
surroundings 15
maycombs 15
ewells 15
lived 15
behind 15
the 15
town 15
garbage 15
dump 15
in 15
what 15
was 15
once 15
a 15
negro 15
cabin 15
the 15
cabins 15
plank 15
walls 15
were 15
supplemented 15
with 15
sheets 15
of 15
corrugated 15
iron 15
its 15
roof 15
shingled 15
with 15
tin 15
cans 15
hammered 15
flat 15
so 15
only 15
its 15
general 15
shape 15
suggested 15
its 15
original 15
design 15
square 15
with 15
four 15
tiny 15
rooms 15
opening 15
onto 15
a 15
shotgun 15
hall 15
the 15
cabin 15
rested 15
uneasily 15
upon 15
four 15
irregular 15
lumps 15
of 15
limestone 15
its 15
windows 15
were 15
merely 15
open 15
spaces 15
in 15
the 15
walls 15
which 15
in 15
the 15
summertime 15
were 15
covered 15
with 15
greasy 15
strips 15
of 15
cheesecloth 15
to 15
keep 15
out 15
the 15
varmints 15
that 15
feasted 15
on 15
maycombs 15
refuse 15
the 15
varmints 15
had 15
a 15
lean 15
time 15
of 15
it 15
for 15
the 15
ewells 15
gave 15
the 15
dump 15
a 15
thorough 15
gleaning 15
every 15
day 15
and 15
the 15
fruits 15
of 15
their 15
industry 15
those 15
that 15
were 15
not 15
eaten 15
made 15
the 15
plot 15
of 15
ground 15
around 15
the 15
cabin 15
look 15
like 15
the 15
playhouse 15
of 15
an 15
insane 15
child 15
what 15
passed 15
for 15
a 15
fence 15
was 15
bits 15
of 15
treelimbs 15
broomsticks 15
and 15
tool 15
shafts 15
all 15
tipped 15
with 15
rusty 15
hammerheads 15
snaggletoothed 15
rake 15
heads 15
shovels 15
axes 15
and 15
grubbing 15
hoes 15
held 15
on 15
with 15
pieces 15
of 15
barbed 15
wire 15
enclosed 15
by 15
this 15
barricade 15
was 15
a 15
dirty 15
yard 15
containing 15
the 15
remains 15
of 15
a 15
modelt 15
ford 15
on 15

five 15
hundred 15
yards 15
beyond 15

was 15
necessary 15

to 15
back 15
out 15
to 15

pale 15
blue 15
smoke 15
rising 15
from 15

chimneys 15
and 15
doorways 15
glowing 15
amber 15
from 15
the 15
fires 15
inside 15
there 15
were 15
delicious 15
smells 15
about 15
chicken 15
bacon 15
frying 15
crisp 15
as 15
the 15
twilight 15
air 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
detected 15
squirrel 15
cooking 15
but 15
it 15
took 15
an 15
old 15
countryman 15
like 15
atticus 15
to 15
identify 15
possum 15
and 15
rabbit 15
aromas 15
that 15
vanished 15

any 15
better 15
than 15

the 15

mr 15
gilmers 15
back 15
stiffened 15
a 15
little 15
and 15
i 15
felt 15
sorry 15
for 15
him 15
perhaps 15
id 15
better 15
explain 15
something 15
now 15
ive 15
heard 15
that 15
lawyers 15
children 15
on 15
seeing 15
their 15
parents 15
in 15
court 15
in 15
the 15
heat 15
of 15
argument 15
get 15
the 15
wrong 15
idea 15
they 15
think 15
opposing 15
counsel 15
to 15
be 15
the 15
personal 15
enemies 15
of 15
their 15
parents 15
they 15
suffer 15
agonies 15
and 15
are 15
surprised 15
to 15
see 15
them 15
often 15
go 15
out 15
arminarm 15
with 15
their 15
tormenters 15
during 15
the 15
first 15
recess 15

was 15
not 15
true 15
of 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
we 15
acquired 15
no 15
traumas 15
from 15
watching 15

or 15
lose 15

sorry 15
that 15

any 15
drama 15
in 15
this 15
respect 15
if 15

did 15
it 15
would 15
not 15
be 15
true 15
we 15
could 15
tell 15
however 15
when 15
debate 15
became 15
more 15
acrimonious 15
than 15
professional 15
but 15
this 15
was 15
from 15
watching 15
lawyers 15
other 15
than 15
our 15
father 15
i 15
never 15
heard 15

raise 15
his 15

in 15
possession 15
of 15
his 15
court 15
once 15
more 15
judge 15
taylor 15
leaned 15
back 15
in 15
his 15
chair 15
he 15
looked 15
suddenly 15
weary 15
his 15
age 15
was 15
showing 15
and 15
i 15
thought 15
about 15
what 15
atticus 15
had 15
said 15
he 15
and 15
mrs 15
taylor 15
didnt 15
kiss 15
much 15
he 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
nearly 15
seventy 15
there 15
has 15
been 15
a 15
request 15
judge 15
taylor 15
said 15
that 15
this 15
courtroom 15
be 15
cleared 15
of 15
spectators 15
or 15
at 15
least 15
of 15
women 15
and 15
children 15
a 15
request 15
that 15
will 15
be 15
denied 15
for 15
the 15
time 15
being 15
people 15
generally 15
see 15
what 15
they 15
look 15
for 15
and 15
hear 15
what 15
they 15
listen 15
for 15
and 15
they 15
have 15
the 15
right 15
to 15
subject 15
their 15
children 15
to 15
it 15
but 15
i 15
can 15
assure 15
you 15
of 15
one 15
thing 15
you 15
will 15
receive 15
what 15
you 15
see 15
and 15
hear 15
in 15
silence 15
or 15
you 15
will 15
leave 15
this 15
courtroom 15
but 15
you 15
wont 15
leave 15
it 15
until 15
the 15
whole 15
boiling 15
of 15
you 15
come 15
before 15
me 15
on 15
contempt 15
charges 15
mr 15
ewell 15
you 15
will 15
keep 15
your 15
testimony 15
within 15
the 15
confines 15
of 15
christian 15
english 15
usage 15
if 15
that 15
is 15
possible 15
proceed 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
mr 15
ewell 15
reminded 15
me 15
of 15
a 15
deafmute 15
i 15
was 15
sure 15
he 15
had 15
never 15
heard 15
the 15
words 15
judge 15
taylor 15
directed 15
at 15
him 15
his 15
mouth 15
struggled 15
silently 15
with 15
them 15
but 15
their 15
import 15
registered 15
on 15
his 15
face 15
smugness 15
faded 15
from 15
it 15
replaced 15
by 15
a 15
dogged 15
earnestness 15
that 15
fooled 15
judge 15
taylor 15
not 15
at 15
all 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
mr 15
ewell 15
was 15
on 15
the 15
stand 15
the 15
judge 15
kept 15
his 15
eyes 15
on 15
him 15
as 15
if 15
daring 15
him 15
to 15
make 15
a 15
false 15
move 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
and 15
atticus 15
exchanged 15
glances 15
atticus 15
was 15
sitting 15
down 15
again 15
his 15
fist 15
rested 15
on 15
his 15
cheek 15
and 15
we 15
could 15
not 15
see 15
his 15
face 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
looked 15
rather 15
desperate 15
a 15
question 15
from 15
judge 15
taylor 15
made 15
him 15
relax 15
mr 15

something 15
atticus 15

an 15
expression 15
common 15
to 15

medical 15
attention 15

you 15
think 15
she 15

immediately 15
the 15

safe 15

mr 15

time 15
of 15

the 15
reporter 15
entertained 15
us 15
for 15
some 15
minutes 15
by 15
reading 15
mr 15
tates 15

and 15
she 15
was 15
mighty 15
beat 15
up 15
the 15
little 15
man 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
forgotten 15
his 15
previous 15
humiliation 15
from 15
the 15
bench 15
it 15
was 15
becoming 15
evident 15
that 15
he 15
thought 15
atticus 15
an 15
easy 15
match 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
grow 15
ruddy 15
again 15
his 15
chest 15
swelled 15
and 15
once 15
more 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
red 15
little 15
rooster 15

said 15

irrelevantnimmaterial 15
judge 15
taylor 15

about 15

atticus 15
said 15
judge 15
if 15

judge 15
taylor 15
but 15
make 15
sure 15
we 15
see 15
atticus 15
overruled 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
seemed 15
as 15
curious 15
as 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
us 15
as 15
to 15
what 15
bearing 15
the 15
state 15
of 15
mr 15

education 15

on 15
the 15
case 15
ill 15
repeat 15
the 15
question 15
said 15
atticus 15

mr 15
ewell 15
was 15
endearing 15
himself 15
to 15
his 15
fellow 15
citizens 15
the 15
whispers 15
and 15
chuckles 15
below 15
us 15
probably 15
had 15
to 15
do 15
with 15
what 15
a 15
card 15
he 15
was 15
i 15
was 15
becoming 15
nervous 15
atticus 15
seemed 15
to 15
know 15
what 15
he 15
was 15
doing 15
but 15
it 15
seemed 15
to 15
me 15
that 15

that 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
christfearing 15
man 15
and 15
atticus 15
finch 15
was 15
taking 15
advantage 15
of 15
him 15
tricking 15
lawyers 15
like 15
atticus 15
finch 15
took 15
advantage 15
of 15
him 15
all 15
the 15
time 15
with 15
their 15
tricking 15
ways 15

it 15
again 15
and 15
again 15

he 15
did 15
nothing 15
atticus 15

his 15
story 15
that 15

through 15
the 15
window 15
then 15
ran 15
the 15
nigger 15
off 15
then 15
ran 15
for 15
the 15
sheriff 15
atticus 15
finally 15
dismissed 15
him 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
asked 15
him 15
one 15
more 15
question 15
about 15
your 15
writing 15
with 15
your 15
left 15
hand 15
are 15
you 15
ambidextrous 15
mr 15
ewell 15
i 15
most 15
positively 15
am 15
not 15
i 15
can 15
use 15
one 15
hand 15
good 15
as 15
the 15
other 15
one 15
hand 15
good 15
as 15
the 15
other 15
he 15
added 15
glaring 15
at 15
the 15
defense 15
table 15
jem 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
having 15
a 15
quiet 15
fit 15
he 15
was 15
pounding 15
the 15
balcony 15
rail 15
softly 15
and 15
once 15
he 15
whispered 15
weve 15
got 15
him 15
i 15
didnt 15
think 15
so 15
atticus 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
show 15
it 15
seemed 15
to 15
me 15
that 15
mr 15
ewell 15
could 15
have 15
beaten 15
up 15
mayella 15
that 15
much 15
i 15
could 15
follow 15
if 15
her 15
right 15
eye 15
was 15
blacked 15
and 15
she 15
was 15
beaten 15
mostly 15
on 15
the 15
right 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
face 15
it 15
would 15
tend 15
to 15
show 15
that 15
a 15
lefthanded 15
person 15
did 15
it 15
sherlock 15
holmes 15
and 15
jem 15
finch 15
would 15
agree 15
but 15
tom 15
robinson 15
could 15
easily 15
be 15
lefthanded 15
too 15
like 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
i 15
imagined 15
a 15
person 15
facing 15
me 15
went 15
through 15
a 15
swift 15
mental 15
pantomime 15
and 15
concluded 15
that 15
he 15
might 15
have 15
held 15
her 15
with 15
his 15
right 15
hand 15
and 15
pounded 15
her 15
with 15
his 15
left 15
i 15
looked 15
down 15
at 15
him 15
his 15
back 15
was 15
to 15
us 15
but 15
i 15
could 15
see 15
his 15
broad 15
shoulders 15
and 15
bullthick 15
neck 15
he 15
could 15
easily 15
have 15
done 15
it 15
i 15
thought 15
jem 15
was 15
counting 15
his 15
chickens 15
but 15
someone 15
was 15
booming 15
again 15
mayella 15
violet 15
ewell 15
a 15
young 15
girl 15
walked 15
to 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
as 15
she 15
raised 15
her 15
hand 15
and 15
swore 15
that 15
the 15
evidence 15
she 15
gave 15
would 15
be 15
the 15
truth 15
the 15
whole 15
truth 15
and 15
nothing 15
but 15
the 15
truth 15
so 15
help 15
her 15
god 15
she 15
seemed 15
somehow 15
fragilelooking 15
but 15
when 15
she 15
sat 15
facing 15
us 15
in 15
the 15
witness 15
chair 15
she 15
became 15
what 15
she 15
was 15
a 15
thickbodied 15
girl 15
accustomed 15
to 15
strenuous 15
labor 15
in 15
maycomb 15
county 15
it 15
was 15
easy 15
to 15
tell 15
when 15
someone 15
bathed 15
regularly 15
as 15
opposed 15
to 15
yearly 15
lavations 15
mr 15
ewell 15
had 15
a 15
scalded 15
look 15
as 15
if 15
an 15
overnight 15
soaking 15
had 15
deprived 15
him 15
of 15
protective 15
layers 15
of 15
dirt 15
his 15
skin 15
appeared 15
to 15
be 15
sensitive 15
to 15
the 15
elements 15
mayella 15
looked 15
as 15
if 15
she 15
tried 15
to 15
keep 15
clean 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
reminded 15
of 15
the 15

of 15

geraniums 15
in 15
the 15
ewell 15

into 15
tears 15
she 15
covered 15
her 15

opened 15

face 15

a 15
mass 15
of 15
creases 15
from 15
her 15
hot 15
hands 15
she 15
waited 15
for 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
to 15

floor 15
and 15
leadin 15
me 15
to 15
the 15
water 15
bucket 15
apparently 15
mayellas 15
recital 15
had 15
given 15
her 15
confidence 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
her 15
fathers 15
brash 15
kind 15
there 15
was 15
something 15
stealthy 15
about 15
hers 15
like 15
a 15
steadyeyed 15
cat 15
with 15
a 15
twitchy 15
tail 15
you 15
say 15
you 15
fought 15
him 15
off 15
as 15
hard 15
as 15
you 15
could 15
fought 15
him 15
tooth 15
and 15
nail 15
asked 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
i 15
positively 15
did 15
mayella 15
echoed 15
her 15
father 15
you 15
are 15
positive 15
that 15
he 15
took 15
full 15
advantage 15
of 15
you 15
mayellas 15
face 15
contorted 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
afraid 15
that 15
she 15
would 15
cry 15
again 15
instead 15
she 15
said 15
he 15
done 15
what 15
he 15
was 15
after 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
called 15
attention 15
to 15
the 15
hot 15
day 15
by 15
wiping 15
his 15
head 15
with 15
his 15
hand 15
thats 15
all 15
for 15
the 15
time 15
being 15
he 15
said 15
pleasantly 15
but 15
you 15
stay 15
there 15
i 15
expect 15
big 15
bad 15
mr 15
finch 15

some 15
questions 15
to 15
ask 15

not 15
prejudice 15
the 15
witness 15
against 15
counsel 15
for 15
the 15
defense 15
murmured 15
judge 15
taylor 15
primly 15
at 15
least 15
not 15
at 15
this 15
time 15
atticus 15
got 15
up 15
grinning 15
but 15
instead 15
of 15
walking 15
to 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
he 15
opened 15
his 15
coat 15
and 15
hooked 15
his 15
thumbs 15
in 15
his 15
vest 15
then 15
he 15
walked 15
slowly 15
across 15
the 15
room 15
to 15
the 15
windows 15
he 15
looked 15
out 15
but 15
didnt 15
seem 15
especially 15
interested 15
in 15
what 15
he 15
saw 15
then 15
he 15
turned 15
and 15
strolled 15
back 15
to 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
from 15
long 15
years 15
of 15
experience 15
i 15
could 15
tell 15
he 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
come 15
to 15
a 15
decision 15
about 15
something 15
miss 15
mayella 15
he 15
said 15
smiling 15
i 15

to 15

for 15
a 15

the 15
judge 15
yonder 15
mayella 15

her 15
head 15
resentfully 15
at 15
the 15
bench 15

could 15
see 15
nothing 15
in 15
mayellas 15
expression 15
to 15
justify 15
atticuss 15
assumption 15
that 15
he 15
had 15
secured 15
her 15
wholehearted 15
cooperation 15
she 15
was 15
looking 15
at 15

furiously 15

mayella 15
looked 15
from 15
under 15
lowered 15
eyelids 15
at 15
atticus 15
but 15
she 15
said 15
to 15
the 15
judge 15
longs 15
he 15
keeps 15
on 15
callin 15

atticus 15
resumed 15
his 15
stroll 15
to 15
the 15
windows 15
and 15
let 15
judge 15
taylor 15
handle 15
this 15
one 15
judge 15
taylor 15
was 15
not 15
the 15
kind 15
of 15
figure 15
that 15
ever 15
evoked 15
pity 15
but 15
i 15
did 15
feel 15
a 15
pang 15
for 15
him 15
as 15
he 15
tried 15
to 15
explain 15
thats 15
just 15
mr 15
finchs 15
way 15
he 15
told 15
mayella 15
weve 15
done 15
business 15
in 15
this 15
court 15
for 15
years 15
and 15
years 15
and 15
mr 15
finch 15
is 15
always 15
courteous 15
to 15
everybody 15
hes 15
not 15
trying 15
to 15
mock 15
you 15
hes 15
trying 15
to 15
be 15
polite 15
thats 15
just 15
his 15
way 15
the 15
judge 15
leaned 15
back 15
atticus 15
lets 15
get 15
on 15
with 15
these 15
proceedings 15
and 15
let 15
the 15
record 15
show 15
that 15
the 15
witness 15
has 15
not 15
been 15
sassed 15
her 15
views 15
to 15
the 15
contrary 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
anybody 15
had 15
ever 15
called 15
her 15
maam 15
or 15
miss 15
mayella 15
in 15
her 15
life 15
probably 15
not 15
as 15
she 15
took 15
offense 15
to 15
routine 15
courtesy 15
what 15
on 15
earth 15
was 15
her 15
life 15
like 15
i 15
soon 15
found 15
out 15
you 15
say 15
youre 15
nineteen 15
atticus 15
resumed 15
how 15
many 15
sisters 15
and 15
brothers 15
have 15
you 15
he 15
walked 15
from 15
the 15
windows 15
back 15
to 15
the 15
stand 15
sebm 15
she 15
said 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
they 15
were 15
all 15
like 15
the 15
specimen 15
i 15
had 15
seen 15
the 15
first 15
day 15
i 15
started 15
to 15
school 15
you 15
the 15
eldest 15
the 15
oldest 15
yes 15
how 15
long 15
has 15
your 15
mother 15
been 15
dead 15
dont 15
know 15
long 15
time 15
did 15
you 15
ever 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
readnwrite 15
good 15
as 15
papa 15
yonder 15
mayella 15
sounded 15
like 15
a 15
mr 15
jingle 15
in 15
a 15
book 15
i 15
had 15
been 15
reading 15
how 15
long 15
did 15
you 15
go 15
to 15
school 15
two 15
year 15
three 15
year 15
dunno 15
slowly 15
but 15
surely 15
i 15
began 15
to 15
see 15
the 15
pattern 15
of 15
atticuss 15
questions 15
from 15
questions 15
that 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
did 15
not 15
deem 15
sufficiently 15
irrelevant 15
or 15
immaterial 15
to 15
object 15
to 15
atticus 15
was 15
quietly 15
building 15
up 15
before 15
the 15
jury 15
a 15
picture 15
of 15
the 15
ewells 15
home 15
life 15
the 15
jury 15
learned 15
the 15
following 15
things 15
their 15
relief 15
check 15
was 15
far 15
from 15
enough 15
to 15
feed 15
the 15
family 15
and 15
there 15
was 15
strong 15
suspicion 15
that 15
papa 15
drank 15
it 15
up 15
anyway 15
he 15
sometimes 15
went 15
off 15
in 15
the 15
swamp 15
for 15
days 15
and 15
came 15
home 15
sick 15
the 15
weather 15
was 15
seldom 15
cold 15
enough 15
to 15
require 15
shoes 15
but 15
when 15
it 15
was 15
you 15
could 15
make 15
dandy 15
ones 15
from 15
strips 15
of 15
old 15
tires 15
the 15
family 15
hauled 15
its 15
water 15
in 15
buckets 15
from 15
a 15
spring 15
that 15
ran 15
out 15
at 15
one 15
end 15
of 15
the 15
dump 15
they 15
kept 15
the 15
surrounding 15
area 15
clear 15
of 15
trash 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
everybody 15
for 15
himself 15
as 15
far 15
as 15
keeping 15
clean 15
went 15
if 15
you 15
wanted 15
to 15
wash 15
you 15
hauled 15
your 15
own 15
water 15
the 15
younger 15
children 15
had 15
perpetual 15
colds 15
and 15
suffered 15
from 15
chronic 15
grounditch 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
lady 15
who 15
came 15
around 15
sometimes 15
and 15
asked 15
mayella 15
why 15
she 15
didnt 15
stay 15
in 15
school 15
she 15
wrote 15
down 15
the 15
answer 15
with 15
two 15
members 15
of 15
the 15
family 15
reading 15
and 15
writing 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
need 15
for 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
them 15
to 15
learn 15
papa 15
needed 15
them 15
at 15
home 15
miss 15
mayella 15
said 15
atticus 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
himself 15
a 15
nineteenyearold 15
girl 15
like 15
you 15
must 15
have 15
friends 15
who 15
are 15
your 15
friends 15
the 15

frowned 15
as 15

puzzled 15

or 15
younger 15
boys 15
and 15
girls 15
just 15
ordinary 15
friends 15
mayellas 15
hostility 15
which 15
had 15
subsided 15
to 15
grudging 15
neutrality 15
flared 15
again 15
you 15
makin 15

at 15

who 15
was 15
sitting 15
with 15
his 15
chair 15
tipped 15
against 15
the 15
railing 15

sat 15
up 15

thin 15
shirt 15
he 15
rose 15
to 15
his 15
feet 15
and 15

hand 15
on 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15
chair 15

oddly 15
off 15

but 15
it 15

not 15
from 15
the 15
way 15
he 15
was 15
standing 15

fully 15
twelve 15
inches 15
shorter 15

right 15
and 15
hung 15
dead 15
at 15
his 15
side 15

in 15
a 15
small 15
shriveled 15
hand 15
and 15
from 15

away 15
as 15

in 15
mr 15
dolphus 15

when 15

boy 15
like 15

from 15
his 15
bones 15

atticuss 15
next 15
question 15

one 15
word 15
long 15
how 15
mayella 15
was 15
raging 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
how 15
he 15

it 15
i 15
said 15
it 15
all 15
happened 15
so 15
fast 15
i 15
now 15
lets 15
consider 15
this 15
calmly 15
began 15
atticus 15
but 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
interrupted 15
with 15
an 15
objection 15
he 15
was 15
not 15
irrelevant 15
or 15
immaterial 15
but 15
atticus 15
was 15
browbeating 15
the 15
witness 15
judge 15
taylor 15
laughed 15
outright 15
oh 15

the 15
only 15
person 15
in 15
the 15
courtroom 15
who 15
laughed 15
even 15
the 15
babies 15
were 15
still 15
and 15
i 15
suddenly 15
wondered 15
if 15
they 15
had 15
been 15
smothered 15
at 15
their 15
mothers 15
breasts 15

when 15
atticus 15
turned 15
away 15
from 15
mayella 15
he 15
looked 15
like 15
his 15
stomach 15
hurt 15
but 15
mayellas 15
face 15
was 15
a 15
mixture 15
of 15
terror 15
and 15
fury 15
atticus 15
sat 15
down 15
wearily 15
and 15
polished 15
his 15
glasses 15
with 15
his 15
handkerchief 15
suddenly 15
mayella 15
became 15
articulate 15
i 15
got 15
somethin 15
to 15
say 15
she 15
said 15
atticus 15
raised 15
his 15
head 15
do 15
you 15
want 15
to 15
tell 15
us 15
what 15
happened 15
but 15
she 15
did 15
not 15
hear 15
the 15
compassion 15
in 15
his 15
invitation 15
i 15
got 15
somethin 15
to 15
say 15
an 15
then 15
i 15
aint 15
gonna 15
say 15
no 15
more 15
that 15
nigger 15
yonder 15
took 15
advantage 15
of 15
me 15
an 15
if 15
you 15
fine 15
fancy 15
gentlemen 15
dont 15
wanta 15
do 15
nothin 15
about 15

then 15
youre 15
all 15
yellow 15
stinkin 15
cowards 15
stinkin 15

the 15
lot 15

mr 15
finch 15
then 15
she 15
burst 15
into 15
real 15
tears 15
her 15
shoulders 15
shook 15
with 15
angry 15
sobs 15
she 15
was 15
as 15
good 15
as 15
her 15
word 15
she 15
answered 15
no 15
more 15
questions 15
even 15
when 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
tried 15
to 15
get 15
her 15
back 15
on 15
the 15
track 15
i 15
guess 15
if 15
she 15
hadnt 15
been 15
so 15
poor 15
and 15
ignorant 15
judge 15
taylor 15
would 15
have 15
put 15
her 15
under 15
the 15
jail 15
for 15
the 15
contempt 15
she 15
had 15
shown 15
everybody 15
in 15
the 15
courtroom 15
somehow 15
atticus 15
had 15
hit 15
her 15
hard 15
in 15
a 15
way 15
that 15
was 15
not 15
clear 15
to 15
me 15
but 15
it 15
gave 15
him 15
no 15
pleasure 15
to 15
do 15
so 15
he 15
sat 15
with 15
his 15
head 15
down 15
and 15
i 15
never 15
saw 15
anybody 15
glare 15
at 15
anyone 15
with 15
the 15
hatred 15
mayella 15
showed 15
when 15
she 15
left 15
the 15
stand 15
and 15
walked 15
by 15
atticuss 15
table 15
when 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
told 15
judge 15
taylor 15
that 15
the 15
state 15
rested 15
judge 15
taylor 15
said 15
its 15
time 15
we 15
all 15
did 15
well 15
take 15
ten 15
minutes 15
atticus 15
and 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
met 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
bench 15
and 15
whispered 15
then 15
they 15
left 15
the 15
courtroom 15
by 15
a 15
door 15
behind 15
the 15
witness 15
stand 15
which 15
was 15
a 15
signal 15
for 15
us 15
all 15
to 15
stretch 15
i 15
discovered 15
that 15
i 15
had 15
been 15
sitting 15
on 15
the 15
edge 15
of 15
the 15
long 15
bench 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
somewhat 15
numb 15
jem 15
got 15
up 15
and 15
yawned 15
dill 15
did 15
likewise 15
and 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
wiped 15
his 15
face 15
on 15
his 15
hat 15
the 15
temperature 15
was 15
an 15
easy 15
ninety 15
he 15
said 15
mr 15
braxton 15
underwood 15
who 15
had 15
been 15
sitting 15
quietly 15
in 15
a 15
chair 15
reserved 15
for 15
the 15
press 15
soaking 15
up 15
testimony 15
with 15
his 15
sponge 15
of 15
a 15
brain 15
allowed 15
his 15
bitter 15
eyes 15
to 15
rove 15
over 15
the 15
colored 15
balcony 15
and 15
they 15
met 15
mine 15
he 15
gave 15
a 15
snort 15
and 15
looked 15
away 15
jem 15
i 15
said 15
mr 15
underwoods 15
seen 15
us 15
thats 15
okay 15
he 15
wont 15
tell 15
atticus 15
hell 15
just 15
put 15
it 15
on 15
the 15
social 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
tribune 15
jem 15
turned 15
back 15
to 15
dill 15
explaining 15
i 15
suppose 15
the 15
finer 15
points 15
of 15
the 15
trial 15
to 15
him 15
but 15
i 15
wondered 15
what 15
they 15
were 15
there 15
had 15
been 15
no 15
lengthy 15
debates 15
between 15
atticus 15
and 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
on 15
any 15
points 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
prosecuting 15
almost 15
reluctantly 15
witnesses 15
had 15
been 15
led 15
by 15
the 15
nose 15
as 15
asses 15
are 15
with 15
few 15
objections 15
but 15
atticus 15
had 15
once 15
told 15
us 15
that 15
in 15
judge 15
taylors 15
court 15
any 15
lawyer 15
who 15
was 15
a 15
strict 15
constructionist 15
on 15
evidence 15
usually 15
wound 15
up 15
receiving 15
strict 15
instructions 15
from 15
the 15
bench 15
he 15
distilled 15
this 15
for 15
me 15
to 15
mean 15
that 15
judge 15
taylor 15
might 15
look 15
lazy 15
and 15
operate 15
in 15
his 15
sleep 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
seldom 15
reversed 15
and 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
proof 15
of 15
the 15
pudding 15
atticus 15
said 15
he 15
was 15
a 15
good 15
judge 15
presently 15
judge 15
taylor 15
returned 15
and 15
climbed 15
into 15
his 15
swivel 15
chair 15
he 15
took 15
a 15
cigar 15
from 15
his 15
vest 15
pocket 15
and 15
examined 15
it 15
thoughtfully 15
i 15
punched 15
dill 15
having 15
passed 15
the 15
judges 15
inspection 15
the 15
cigar 15
suffered 15
a 15
vicious 15
bite 15
we 15
come 15
down 15
sometimes 15
to 15
watch 15
him 15
i 15
explained 15
its 15
gonna 15
take 15
him 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
the 15
afternoon 15
now 15
you 15
watch 15
unaware 15
of 15
public 15
scrutiny 15
from 15
above 15
judge 15
taylor 15
disposed 15
of 15
the 15
severed 15
end 15
by 15
propelling 15
it 15
expertly 15
to 15
his 15
lips 15
and 15
saying 15
fhluck 15
he 15
hit 15
a 15
spittoon 15
so 15
squarely 15
we 15
could 15
hear 15
it 15
slosh 15
bet 15
he 15
was 15
hell 15
with 15
a 15
spitball 15
murmured 15
dill 15
as 15
a 15
rule 15
a 15
recess 15
meant 15
a 15
general 15
exodus 15
but 15
today 15
people 15
werent 15
moving 15
even 15
the 15
idlers 15
who 15
had 15
failed 15
to 15
shame 15
younger 15
men 15
from 15
their 15
seats 15
had 15
remained 15
standing 15
along 15
the 15
walls 15
i 15
guess 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
had 15
reserved 15
the 15
county 15
toilet 15
for 15
court 15
officials 15
atticus 15
and 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
returned 15
and 15
judge 15
taylor 15
looked 15
at 15
his 15
watch 15
its 15
gettin 15
on 15
to 15
four 15
he 15
said 15
which 15
was 15
intriguing 15
as 15
the 15
courthouse 15
clock 15
must 15
have 15
struck 15
the 15
hour 15
at 15
least 15
twice 15
i 15
had 15
not 15
heard 15
it 15
or 15
felt 15
its 15
vibrations 15
shall 15
we 15
try 15
to 15
wind 15
up 15
this 15
afternoon 15
asked 15
judge 15
taylor 15

under 15
his 15
left 15

guided 15
his 15
arm 15
to 15
the 15
bible 15
and 15
his 15
rubberlike 15
left 15
hand 15
sought 15
contact 15
with 15
the 15
black 15
binding 15
as 15
he 15
raised 15
his 15
right 15
hand 15
the 15
useless 15
one 15
slipped 15
off 15
the 15

and 15
hit 15
the 15
clerks 15

that 15

ewell 15

have 15
been 15
the 15
loneliest 15
person 15
in 15
the 15
world 15
she 15
was 15
even 15
lonelier 15
than 15
boo 15
radley 15
who 15
had 15
not 15
been 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
in 15
twentyfive 15
years 15
when 15
atticus 15
asked 15
had 15
she 15
any 15
friends 15
she 15
seemed 15
not 15
to 15
know 15
what 15
he 15
meant 15
then 15
she 15
thought 15
he 15
was 15
making 15
fun 15
of 15
her 15
she 15
was 15
as 15
sad 15
i 15
thought 15
as 15
what 15
jem 15
called 15
a 15
mixed 15
child 15
white 15
people 15
wouldnt 15
have 15
anything 15
to 15
do 15
with 15
her 15
because 15
she 15
lived 15
among 15
pigs 15
negroes 15
wouldnt 15
have 15
anything 15
to 15
do 15
with 15
her 15
because 15
she 15
was 15
white 15
she 15
couldnt 15
live 15
like 15
mr 15
dolphus 15
raymond 15
who 15
preferred 15
the 15
company 15
of 15
negroes 15
because 15
she 15
didnt 15
own 15
a 15
riverbank 15
and 15
she 15
wasnt 15
from 15
a 15
fine 15
old 15
family 15
nobody 15
said 15
thats 15
just 15
their 15
way 15
about 15
the 15
ewells 15
maycomb 15
gave 15
them 15
christmas 15
baskets 15
welfare 15
money 15
and 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
its 15
hand 15
tom 15
robinson 15
was 15
probably 15
the 15
only 15
person 15
who 15
was 15
ever 15
decent 15
to 15
her 15
but 15
she 15
said 15
he 15
took 15
advantage 15
of 15
her 15
and 15
when 15
she 15
stood 15
up 15
she 15
looked 15
at 15
him 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
dirt 15
beneath 15
her 15
feet 15
did 15
you 15
ever 15
atticus 15
interrupted 15
my 15
meditations 15
at 15
any 15
time 15
go 15
on 15
the 15
ewell 15
property 15
did 15
you 15
ever 15
set 15
foot 15
on 15
the 15
ewell 15
property 15
without 15
an 15
express 15
invitation 15
from 15
one 15
of 15
them 15
no 15
suh 15
mr 15
finch 15
i 15
never 15
did 15
i 15
wouldnt 15
do 15
that 15
suh 15
atticus 15
sometimes 15
said 15
that 15
one 15
way 15
to 15
tell 15
whether 15
a 15
witness 15
was 15
lying 15
or 15
telling 15
the 15
truth 15
was 15
to 15
listen 15
rather 15
than 15
watch 15
i 15
applied 15
his 15
test 15
tom 15
denied 15
it 15
three 15
times 15
in 15
one 15
breath 15
but 15
quietly 15
with 15
no 15
hint 15
of 15
whining 15
in 15
his 15
voice 15
and 15
i 15
found 15
myself 15
believing 15
him 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
his 15
protesting 15
too 15
much 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
respectable 15
negro 15
and 15
a 15
respectable 15
negro 15
would 15
never 15
go 15
up 15
into 15
somebodys 15
yard 15
of 15
his 15
own 15
volition 15
tom 15
what 15

below 15
us 15
the 15
spectators 15

a 15
collective 15
breath 15
and 15

forward 15
behind 15

the 15
whites 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
shone 15
in 15
his 15
face 15
and 15
when 15
he 15
spoke 15
we 15
saw 15
flashes 15
of 15
his 15
teeth 15
if 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
whole 15
he 15

a 15
feeling 15
that 15
i 15
shouldnt 15
be 15
here 15
listening 15
to 15
this 15
sinful 15
man 15
who 15
had 15
mixed 15
children 15
and 15
didnt 15
care 15
who 15
knew 15
it 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
fascinating 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
encountered 15
a 15
being 15
who 15
deliberately 15
perpetrated 15
fraud 15
against 15
himself 15
but 15
why 15
had 15
he 15
entrusted 15
us 15
with 15
his 15
deepest 15
secret 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
why 15
because 15
youre 15
children 15
and 15
you 15
can 15
understand 15
it 15
he 15
said 15
and 15
because 15
i 15
heard 15
that 15
one 15
he 15
jerked 15
his 15
head 15
at 15
dill 15
things 15
havent 15
caught 15
up 15
with 15
that 15
ones 15
instinct 15
yet 15
let 15
him 15
get 15
a 15
little 15
older 15
and 15
he 15
wont 15
get 15
sick 15
and 15
cry 15
maybe 15
thingsll 15
strike 15
him 15
as 15
being 15
not 15
quite 15
right 15
say 15
but 15
he 15
wont 15
cry 15
not 15
when 15
he 15
gets 15
a 15
few 15
years 15
on 15

cry 15
about 15

atticus 15

cheatin 15
a 15
colored 15
man 15

ten 15
times 15
worse 15

white 15
man 15
i 15
muttered 15

the 15
worst 15
thing 15

gotta 15
do 15
is 15
step 15
back 15
inside 15
the 15
courthouse 15
which 15
reminded 15
me 15
that 15
we 15
were 15
missing 15
nearly 15
all 15
of 15
mr 15
gilmers 15
crossexamination 15
i 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
sun 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
dropping 15
fast 15
behind 15
the 15
storetops 15
on 15
the 15
west 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
square 15
between 15
two 15
fires 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
decide 15
which 15
i 15
wanted 15
to 15
jump 15
into 15
mr 15
raymond 15
or 15
the 15
th 15
judicial 15
circuit 15

the 15
drink 15
it 15
was 15
mighty 15
settlin 15
we 15
raced 15
back 15
to 15
the 15
courthouse 15
up 15
the 15
steps 15
up 15
two 15
flights 15
of 15
stairs 15
and 15
edged 15
our 15
way 15
along 15
the 15
balcony 15
rail 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
had 15
saved 15
our 15
seats 15
the 15
courtroom 15
was 15
still 15
and 15
again 15
i 15
wondered 15
where 15
the 15
babies 15
were 15
judge 15
taylors 15
cigar 15
was 15
a 15
brown 15
speck 15
in 15
the 15
center 15
of 15
his 15
mouth 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
was 15
writing 15
on 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
yellow 15
pads 15
on 15
his 15
table 15
trying 15
to 15
outdo 15
the 15
court 15
reporter 15
whose 15
hand 15
was 15
jerking 15
rapidly 15
shoot 15
i 15
muttered 15
we 15
missed 15
it 15
atticus 15
was 15
halfway 15
through 15
his 15
speech 15
to 15
the 15
jury 15
he 15
had 15
evidently 15
pulled 15
some 15
papers 15
from 15
his 15
briefcase 15
that 15
rested 15
beside 15
his 15
chair 15
because 15
they 15
were 15
on 15
his 15
table 15
tom 15
robinson 15
was 15
toying 15
with 15
them 15
absence 15
of 15
any 15
corroborative 15
evidence 15
this 15
man 15
was 15
indicted 15
on 15
a 15
capital 15
charge 15
and 15
is 15
now 15
on 15
trial 15
for 15
his 15
life 15
i 15
punched 15
jem 15
how 15
longs 15
he 15
been 15
at 15
it 15
hes 15
just 15
gone 15
over 15
the 15
evidence 15
jem 15
whispered 15
and 15
were 15
gonna 15
win 15
scout 15
i 15
dont 15
see 15
how 15
we 15
cant 15
hes 15
been 15
at 15
it 15
bout 15
five 15
minutes 15
he 15
made 15
it 15
as 15
plain 15
and 15
easy 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
ida 15
explained 15
it 15
to 15
you 15
you 15
couldve 15
understood 15
it 15
even 15
did 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
shh 15
nothing 15
new 15
just 15
the 15
usual 15
hush 15
now 15
we 15
looked 15
down 15
again 15
atticus 15
was 15
speaking 15
easily 15
with 15
the 15
kind 15
of 15
detachment 15
he 15
used 15
when 15
he 15
dictated 15
a 15
letter 15
he 15
walked 15
slowly 15
up 15
and 15
down 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
jury 15
and 15
the 15
jury 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
attentive 15
their 15
heads 15
were 15
up 15
and 15
they 15
followed 15
atticuss 15
route 15
with 15
what 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
appreciation 15
i 15
guess 15
it 15
was 15
because 15
atticus 15
wasnt 15
a 15
thunderer 15
atticus 15
paused 15
then 15
he 15
did 15
something 15
he 15
didnt 15
ordinarily 15
do 15
he 15
unhitched 15
his 15
watch 15
and 15
chain 15
and 15
placed 15
them 15
on 15
the 15
table 15
saying 15
with 15
the 15
courts 15
permission 15
judge 15
taylor 15
nodded 15
and 15
then 15
atticus 15
did 15
something 15
i 15
never 15
saw 15
him 15
do 15
before 15
or 15
since 15
in 15
public 15
or 15
in 15
private 15
he 15
unbuttoned 15
his 15
vest 15
unbuttoned 15
his 15
collar 15
loosened 15
his 15
tie 15
and 15
took 15
off 15
his 15
coat 15
he 15
never 15
loosened 15
a 15
scrap 15
of 15
his 15
clothing 15
until 15
he 15
undressed 15
at 15
bedtime 15
and 15
to 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
equivalent 15
of 15
him 15
standing 15
before 15
us 15
stark 15
naked 15
we 15
exchanged 15
horrified 15
glances 15
atticus 15
put 15
his 15
hands 15
in 15
his 15
pockets 15
and 15
as 15
he 15
returned 15
to 15
the 15
jury 15
i 15
saw 15
his 15
gold 15
collar 15
button 15
and 15
the 15
tips 15
of 15
his 15
pen 15
and 15
pencil 15
winking 15
in 15
the 15
light 15
gentlemen 15
he 15
said 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
again 15
looked 15
at 15
each 15
other 15
atticus 15
might 15
have 15
said 15
scout 15
his 15
voice 15
had 15
lost 15
its 15
aridity 15
its 15
detachment 15
and 15
he 15
was 15
talking 15
to 15
the 15
jury 15
as 15
if 15
they 15
were 15
folks 15
on 15
the 15
post 15
office 15
corner 15
gentlemen 15
he 15
was 15
saying 15
i 15
shall 15
be 15
brief 15
but 15
i 15
would 15
like 15
to 15
use 15
my 15
remaining 15
time 15
with 15
you 15
to 15
remind 15
you 15
that 15
this 15
case 15
is 15
not 15
a 15
difficult 15
one 15
it 15
requires 15
no 15
minute 15
sifting 15
of 15
complicated 15
facts 15
but 15
it 15
does 15
require 15
you 15
to 15
be 15
sure 15
beyond 15
all 15
reasonable 15
doubt 15
as 15
to 15
the 15
guilt 15
of 15
the 15
defendant 15
to 15
begin 15
with 15
this 15
case 15
should 15
never 15
have 15
come 15
to 15
trial 15
this 15
case 15
is 15
as 15
simple 15
as 15
black 15
and 15
white 15
the 15
state 15
has 15
not 15
produced 15
one 15
iota 15
of 15
medical 15
evidence 15
to 15
the 15
effect 15
that 15
the 15
crime 15
tom 15
robinson 15
is 15
charged 15
with 15
ever 15
took 15
place 15
it 15
has 15
relied 15
instead 15
upon 15
the 15
testimony 15
of 15
two 15
witnesses 15
whose 15
evidence 15
has 15
not 15
only 15
been 15
called 15
into 15
serious 15
question 15
on 15
crossexamination 15
but 15
has 15
been 15
flatly 15
contradicted 15
by 15
the 15
defendant 15
the 15
defendant 15
is 15
not 15
guilty 15
but 15
somebody 15
in 15
this 15
courtroom 15
is 15
i 15
have 15
nothing 15
but 15
pity 15
in 15
my 15
heart 15
for 15
the 15
chief 15
witness 15
for 15
the 15
state 15
but 15
my 15
pity 15
does 15
not 15
extend 15
so 15
far 15
as 15
to 15
her 15
putting 15
a 15
mans 15
life 15
at 15
stake 15
which 15
she 15
has 15
done 15
in 15
an 15
effort 15
to 15
get 15
rid 15
of 15
her 15
own 15
guilt 15
i 15
say 15
guilt 15
gentlemen 15
because 15
it 15
was 15
guilt 15
that 15
motivated 15
her 15
she 15
has 15
committed 15
no 15
crime 15
she 15
has 15
merely 15
broken 15
a 15
rigid 15
and 15
timehonored 15
code 15
of 15
our 15
society 15
a 15
code 15
so 15
severe 15
that 15
whoever 15
breaks 15
it 15
is 15
hounded 15
from 15
our 15
midst 15
as 15
unfit 15
to 15
live 15
with 15
she 15
is 15
the 15
victim 15
of 15
cruel 15
poverty 15
and 15
ignorance 15
but 15
i 15
cannot 15
pity 15
her 15
she 15
is 15
white 15
she 15
knew 15
full 15
well 15
the 15
enormity 15
of 15
her 15
offense 15
but 15
because 15
her 15
desires 15
were 15
stronger 15
than 15
the 15
code 15
she 15
was 15
breaking 15
she 15
persisted 15
in 15
breaking 15
it 15
she 15
persisted 15
and 15
her 15
subsequent 15
reaction 15
is 15
something 15
that 15
all 15
of 15
us 15
have 15
known 15
at 15
one 15
time 15
or 15
another 15
she 15
did 15
something 15
every 15
child 15
has 15
done 15
she 15
tried 15
to 15
put 15
the 15
evidence 15
of 15
her 15
offense 15
away 15
from 15
her 15
but 15
in 15
this 15
case 15
she 15
was 15
no 15
child 15
hiding 15
stolen 15
contraband 15
she 15
struck 15
out 15
at 15
her 15
victim 15
of 15
necessity 15
she 15
must 15
put 15
him 15
away 15
from 15
her 15
he 15
must 15
be 15
removed 15
from 15
her 15
presence 15
from 15
this 15
world 15
she 15
must 15
destroy 15
the 15
evidence 15
of 15
her 15
offense 15
what 15
was 15
the 15
evidence 15
of 15
her 15
offense 15
tom 15
robinson 15
a 15
human 15
being 15
she 15
must 15
put 15
tom 15
robinson 15
away 15
from 15
her 15
tom 15
robinson 15
was 15
her 15
daily 15
reminder 15
of 15
what 15
she 15
did 15
what 15
did 15
she 15
do 15
she 15
tempted 15
a 15
negro 15
she 15
was 15
white 15
and 15
she 15
tempted 15
a 15
negro 15
she 15
did 15
something 15
that 15
in 15
our 15
society 15
is 15
unspeakable 15
she 15
kissed 15
a 15
black 15
man 15
not 15
an 15
old 15
uncle 15
but 15
a 15
strong 15
young 15
negro 15
man 15
no 15
code 15
mattered 15
to 15
her 15
before 15
she 15
broke 15
it 15
but 15
it 15
came 15
crashing 15
down 15
on 15
her 15
afterwards 15
her 15
father 15
saw 15
it 15
and 15
the 15
defendant 15
has 15
testified 15
as 15
to 15
his 15
remarks 15
what 15
did 15
her 15
father 15
do 15
we 15
dont 15
know 15
but 15
there 15
is 15
circumstantial 15
evidence 15
to 15
indicate 15
that 15
mayella 15
ewell 15
was 15
beaten 15
savagely 15
by 15
someone 15
who 15
led 15
almost 15
exclusively 15
with 15
his 15
left 15
we 15
do 15
know 15
in 15
part 15
what 15
mr 15
ewell 15
did 15
he 15
did 15
what 15
any 15
godfearing 15
persevering 15
respectable 15
white 15
man 15
would 15
do 15
under 15
the 15
circumstances 15
he 15
swore 15
out 15
a 15
warrant 15
no 15
doubt 15
signing 15
it 15
with 15
his 15
left 15
hand 15
and 15
tom 15
robinson 15
now 15
sits 15
before 15
you 15
having 15
taken 15
the 15
oath 15
with 15
the 15
only 15
good 15
hand 15
he 15
possesses 15
his 15
right 15
hand 15
and 15
so 15
a 15
quiet 15
respectable 15
humble 15
negro 15
who 15
had 15
the 15
unmitigated 15
temerity 15
to 15
feel 15
sorry 15
for 15
a 15
white 15
woman 15
has 15
had 15
to 15
put 15
his 15
word 15
against 15
two 15
white 15
peoples 15
i 15
need 15
not 15
remind 15
you 15
of 15
their 15
appearance 15
and 15
conduct 15
on 15
the 15
stand 15
you 15
saw 15
them 15
for 15
yourselves 15
the 15
witnesses 15
for 15
the 15
state 15
with 15
the 15
exception 15
of 15
the 15
sheriff 15
of 15
maycomb 15
county 15
have 15
presented 15
themselves 15
to 15
you 15
gentlemen 15
to 15
this 15
court 15
in 15
the 15
cynical 15
confidence 15
that 15
their 15
testimony 15
would 15
not 15
be 15
doubted 15
confident 15
that 15
you 15
gentlemen 15
would 15
go 15
along 15
with 15
them 15
on 15
the 15
assumption 15
the 15
evil 15
assumption 15
that 15
all 15
negroes 15
lie 15
that 15
all 15
negroes 15
are 15
basically 15
immoral 15
beings 15
that 15
all 15
negro 15
men 15
are 15
not 15
to 15
be 15
trusted 15
around 15
our 15
women 15
an 15
assumption 15
one 15
associates 15
with 15
minds 15
of 15
their 15
caliber 15
which 15
gentlemen 15
we 15
know 15
is 15
in 15
itself 15
a 15
lie 15
as 15
black 15
as 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
skin 15
a 15
lie 15
i 15
do 15
not 15
have 15
to 15
point 15
out 15
to 15
you 15
you 15
know 15
the 15
truth 15
and 15
the 15
truth 15
is 15
this 15
some 15
negroes 15
lie 15
some 15
negroes 15
are 15
immoral 15
some 15
negro 15
men 15
are 15
not 15
to 15
be 15
trusted 15
around 15
women 15
black 15
or 15
white 15
but 15
this 15
is 15
a 15
truth 15
that 15
applies 15
to 15
the 15
human 15
race 15
and 15
to 15
no 15
particular 15
race 15
of 15
men 15
there 15
is 15
not 15
a 15
person 15
in 15
this 15
courtroom 15
who 15
has 15
never 15
told 15
a 15
lie 15
who 15
has 15
never 15
done 15
an 15
immoral 15
thing 15
and 15
there 15
is 15
no 15
man 15
living 15
who 15
has 15
never 15
looked 15
upon 15
a 15
woman 15
without 15
desire 15
atticus 15
paused 15
and 15
took 15
out 15
his 15
handkerchief 15
then 15
he 15
took 15
off 15
his 15
glasses 15
and 15
wiped 15
them 15
and 15
we 15
saw 15
another 15
first 15
we 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
him 15
sweat 15
he 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
those 15
men 15
whose 15
faces 15
never 15
perspired 15
but 15
now 15
it 15
was 15
shining 15
tan 15
one 15
more 15
thing 15
gentlemen 15
before 15
i 15
quit 15
thomas 15
jefferson 15
once 15
said 15
that 15
all 15
men 15
are 15
created 15
equal 15
a 15
phrase 15
that 15
the 15
yankees 15
and 15
the 15
distaff 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
executive 15
branch 15
in 15
washington 15
are 15
fond 15
of 15
hurling 15
at 15
us 15
there 15
is 15
a 15
tendency 15
in 15
this 15
year 15
of 15
grace 15
for 15
certain 15
people 15
to 15
use 15
this 15
phrase 15
out 15
of 15
context 15
to 15
satisfy 15
all 15
conditions 15
the 15
most 15
ridiculous 15
example 15
i 15
can 15
think 15
of 15
is 15
that 15
the 15
people 15
who 15
run 15
public 15
education 15
promote 15
the 15
stupid 15
and 15
idle 15
along 15
with 15
the 15
industrious 15
because 15
all 15
men 15
are 15
created 15
equal 15
educators 15
will 15
gravely 15
tell 15
you 15
the 15
children 15
left 15
behind 15
suffer 15
terrible 15
feelings 15
of 15
inferiority 15
we 15
know 15
all 15
men 15
are 15
not 15
created 15
equal 15
in 15
the 15
sense 15
some 15
people 15
would 15
have 15
us 15
believe 15
some 15
people 15
are 15
smarter 15
than 15
others 15
some 15
people 15
have 15
more 15
opportunity 15
because 15
theyre 15
born 15
with 15
it 15
some 15
men 15
make 15
more 15
money 15
than 15
others 15
some 15
ladies 15
make 15
better 15
cakes 15
than 15
others 15
some 15
people 15
are 15
born 15
gifted 15
beyond 15
the 15
normal 15
scope 15
of 15
most 15
men 15
but 15
there 15
is 15
one 15
way 15
in 15
this 15
country 15
in 15
which 15
all 15
men 15
are 15
created 15
equal 15
there 15
is 15
one 15
human 15
institution 15
that 15
makes 15
a 15
pauper 15
the 15
equal 15
of 15
a 15
rockefeller 15
the 15
stupid 15
man 15
the 15
equal 15
of 15
an 15
einstein 15
and 15
the 15
ignorant 15
man 15
the 15
equal 15
of 15
any 15
college 15
president 15
that 15
institution 15
gentlemen 15
is 15
a 15
court 15
it 15
can 15
be 15
the 15
supreme 15
court 15
of 15
the 15
united 15
states 15
or 15
the 15
humblest 15
jp 15
court 15
in 15
the 15
land 15
or 15
this 15
honorable 15
court 15
which 15
you 15
serve 15
our 15
courts 15
have 15
their 15
faults 15
as 15
does 15
any 15
human 15
institution 15
but 15
in 15
this 15
country 15
our 15
courts 15
are 15
the 15
great 15
levelers 15
and 15
in 15
our 15
courts 15
all 15
men 15
are 15
created 15
equal 15
im 15
no 15
idealist 15
to 15
believe 15
firmly 15
in 15
the 15
integrity 15
of 15
our 15
courts 15
and 15
in 15
the 15
jury 15
system 15
that 15
is 15
no 15
ideal 15
to 15
me 15
it 15
is 15
a 15
living 15
working 15
reality 15
gentlemen 15
a 15
court 15
is 15
no 15
better 15
than 15
each 15
man 15
of 15
you 15
sitting 15
before 15
me 15
on 15
this 15
jury 15

jury 15
and 15
a 15
jury 15

the 15
men 15
who 15
make 15
it 15
up 15
i 15
am 15
confident 15
that 15
you 15
gentlemen 15

review 15

passion 15
the 15
evidence 15
you 15
have 15
heard 15
come 15
to 15
a 15
decision 15

exhilarated 15
so 15
many 15
things 15
had 15
happened 15
so 15
fast 15
i 15
felt 15
it 15
would 15
take 15
years 15
to 15
sort 15
them 15
out 15
and 15
now 15
here 15
was 15
calpurnia 15
giving 15
her 15
precious 15
jem 15
down 15
the 15
country 15
what 15

laughin 15
calpurnia 15
revived 15
a 15
series 15
of 15
rusty 15
threats 15
that 15
moved 15
jem 15
to 15
little 15
remorse 15
and 15
she 15
sailed 15
up 15
the 15
front 15
steps 15
with 15
her 15
classic 15
if 15

house 15
sir 15
jem 15
went 15
in 15
grinning 15
and 15
calpurnia 15
nodded 15
tacit 15
consent 15
to 15
having 15
dill 15
in 15
to 15
supper 15
you 15
all 15

in 15
the 15
mornin 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
met 15
us 15
and 15
nearly 15
fainted 15
when 15
calpurnia 15
told 15
her 15
where 15
we 15
were 15
i 15
guess 15
it 15
hurt 15
her 15
when 15
we 15
told 15
her 15
atticus 15
said 15
we 15
could 15
go 15
back 15
because 15
she 15
didnt 15
say 15
a 15
word 15
during 15
supper 15
she 15
just 15
rearranged 15
food 15
on 15
her 15
plate 15
looking 15
at 15
it 15
sadly 15
while 15
calpurnia 15
served 15
jem 15
dill 15
and 15
me 15
with 15
a 15
vengeance 15
calpurnia 15
poured 15
milk 15
dished 15
out 15
potato 15
salad 15
and 15
ham 15
muttering 15
shamed 15
of 15
yourselves 15
in 15
varying 15
degrees 15
of 15
intensity 15
now 15
you 15
all 15
eat 15
slow 15
was 15
her 15
final 15
command 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
had 15
saved 15
our 15
places 15
we 15
were 15
surprised 15
to 15
find 15
that 15
we 15
had 15
been 15
gone 15
nearly 15
an 15
hour 15
and 15
were 15
equally 15
surprised 15
to 15
find 15
the 15
courtroom 15
exactly 15
as 15
we 15
had 15
left 15
it 15
with 15
minor 15
changes 15
the 15
jury 15
box 15
was 15
empty 15
the 15
defendant 15
was 15
gone 15
judge 15
taylor 15
had 15
been 15
gone 15
but 15
he 15
reappeared 15
as 15
we 15
were 15
seating 15
ourselves 15
nobodys 15
moved 15
hardly 15
said 15
jem 15
they 15
moved 15
around 15
some 15
when 15
the 15
jury 15
went 15
out 15
said 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
the 15
menfolk 15
down 15
there 15
got 15
the 15
womenfolk 15
their 15
suppers 15
and 15
they 15
fed 15
their 15
babies 15
how 15
long 15
have 15
they 15
been 15
out 15
asked 15
jem 15
bout 15
thirty 15
minutes 15
mr 15
finch 15
and 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
did 15
some 15
more 15
talkin 15
and 15
judge 15
taylor 15
charged 15
the 15
jury 15
how 15
was 15
he 15
asked 15
jem 15
what 15
say 15
oh 15
he 15
did 15
right 15
well 15
i 15
aint 15
complainin 15
one 15
bit 15
he 15
was 15
mighty 15
fairminded 15
he 15
sorta 15
said 15
if 15
you 15
believe 15
this 15
then 15
youll 15
have 15
to 15
return 15
one 15
verdict 15
but 15
if 15
you 15
believe 15
this 15
youll 15
have 15
to 15
return 15
another 15
one 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
was 15
leanin 15
a 15
little 15
to 15
our 15
side 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
scratched 15
his 15
head 15
jem 15
smiled 15
hes 15
not 15
supposed 15
to 15
lean 15
reverend 15
but 15
dont 15
fret 15
weve 15
won 15
it 15
he 15
said 15
wisely 15
dont 15
see 15
how 15
any 15
jury 15
could 15
convict 15
on 15
what 15
we 15
heard 15
now 15
dont 15
you 15
be 15
so 15
confident 15
mr 15
jem 15
i 15
aint 15
ever 15
seen 15
any 15
jury 15
decide 15
in 15
favor 15
of 15
a 15
colored 15
man 15
over 15
a 15
white 15
man 15
but 15
jem 15
took 15
exception 15
to 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
and 15
we 15
were 15
subjected 15
to 15
a 15
lengthy 15
review 15
of 15
the 15
evidence 15
with 15
jems 15
ideas 15
on 15
the 15
law 15
regarding 15
rape 15
it 15
wasnt 15
rape 15
if 15
she 15
let 15
you 15
but 15
she 15
had 15
to 15
be 15
eighteen 15
in 15
alabama 15
that 15
is 15
and 15
mayella 15
was 15
nineteen 15
apparently 15
you 15
had 15
to 15
kick 15
and 15
holler 15
you 15
had 15
to 15
be 15
overpowered 15
and 15
stomped 15
on 15
preferably 15
knocked 15
stone 15
cold 15
if 15
you 15
were 15
under 15
eighteen 15
you 15
didnt 15
have 15
to 15
go 15
through 15
all 15
this 15
mr 15
jem 15
reverend 15
sykes 15
demurred 15
this 15
aint 15
a 15
polite 15
thing 15
for 15
little 15
ladies 15
to 15
hear 15
aw 15
she 15
doesnt 15
know 15
what 15
were 15
talkin 15
about 15
said 15
jem 15
scout 15
this 15
is 15
too 15
old 15
for 15
you 15
aint 15
it 15
it 15
most 15
certainly 15
is 15
not 15
i 15
know 15
every 15
word 15
youre 15
saying 15
perhaps 15
i 15
was 15
too 15
convincing 15
because 15
jem 15
hushed 15
and 15
never 15
discussed 15
the 15
subject 15
again 15
what 15
time 15
is 15
it 15
reverend 15
he 15
asked 15
gettin 15
on 15
toward 15
eight 15
i 15
looked 15
down 15
and 15
saw 15
atticus 15
strolling 15
around 15
with 15
his 15
hands 15
in 15
his 15
pockets 15
he 15
made 15
a 15
tour 15
of 15
the 15
windows 15
then 15
walked 15
by 15
the 15
railing 15
over 15
to 15
the 15
jury 15
box 15
he 15
looked 15
in 15
it 15
inspected 15
judge 15
taylor 15
on 15
his 15
throne 15
then 15
went 15
back 15
to 15
where 15
he 15
started 15
i 15
caught 15
his 15
eye 15
and 15
waved 15
to 15
him 15
he 15
acknowledged 15
my 15
salute 15
with 15
a 15
nod 15
and 15
resumed 15
his 15
tour 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
was 15
standing 15
at 15
the 15
windows 15
talking 15
to 15
mr 15
underwood 15
bert 15
the 15
court 15
reporter 15
was 15
chainsmoking 15
he 15
sat 15
back 15
with 15
his 15
feet 15
on 15
the 15
table 15
but 15
the 15
officers 15
of 15
the 15
court 15
the 15
ones 15
present 15
atticus 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
judge 15
taylor 15
sound 15
asleep 15
and 15
bert 15
were 15
the 15
only 15
ones 15
whose 15
behavior 15
seemed 15
normal 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
a 15
packed 15
courtroom 15
so 15
still 15
sometimes 15
a 15
baby 15
would 15
cry 15
out 15
fretfully 15
and 15
a 15
child 15
would 15
scurry 15
out 15
but 15
the 15
grown 15
people 15
sat 15
as 15
if 15
they 15
were 15
in 15
church 15
in 15
the 15
balcony 15
the 15
negroes 15
sat 15
and 15
stood 15
around 15
us 15
with 15
biblical 15
patience 15
the 15
old 15
courthouse 15
clock 15
suffered 15
its 15
preliminary 15
strain 15
and 15
struck 15
the 15
hour 15
eight 15
deafening 15
bongs 15
that 15
shook 15
our 15
bones 15
when 15
it 15
bonged 15
eleven 15
times 15
i 15
was 15
past 15
feeling 15
tired 15
from 15
fighting 15
sleep 15
i 15
allowed 15
myself 15
a 15
short 15
nap 15
against 15
reverend 15
sykess 15
comfortable 15
arm 15
and 15
shoulder 15
i 15
jerked 15
awake 15
and 15
made 15
an 15
honest 15
effort 15
to 15
remain 15
so 15
by 15
looking 15
down 15
and 15
concentrating 15
on 15
the 15
heads 15
below 15
there 15
were 15
sixteen 15
bald 15
ones 15
fourteen 15
men 15
that 15
could 15
pass 15
for 15
redheads 15
forty 15
heads 15
varying 15
between 15
brown 15
and 15
black 15
and 15
i 15
remembered 15
something 15
jem 15
had 15
once 15
explained 15
to 15
me 15
when 15
he 15
went 15
through 15
a 15
brief 15
period 15
of 15
psychical 15
research 15
he 15
said 15
if 15
enough 15
people 15
a 15
stadium 15
full 15
maybe 15
were 15
to 15
concentrate 15
on 15
one 15
thing 15
such 15
as 15
setting 15
a 15
tree 15
afire 15
in 15
the 15
woods 15
that 15
the 15
tree 15
would 15
ignite 15
of 15
its 15
own 15
accord 15
i 15
toyed 15
with 15
the 15
idea 15
of 15
asking 15
everyone 15
below 15
to 15
concentrate 15
on 15
setting 15
tom 15
robinson 15
free 15
but 15
thought 15
if 15
they 15
were 15
as 15
tired 15
as 15
i 15
it 15
wouldnt 15
work 15
dill 15
was 15
sound 15
asleep 15
his 15
head 15
on 15
jems 15
shoulder 15
and 15
jem 15
was 15
quiet 15
aint 15
it 15
a 15
long 15
time 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
sure 15
is 15
scout 15
he 15
said 15
happily 15
well 15
from 15
the 15
way 15
you 15
put 15
it 15
itd 15
just 15
take 15
five 15
minutes 15
jem 15
raised 15
his 15
eyebrows 15
there 15
are 15
things 15
you 15
dont 15
understand 15
he 15
said 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
too 15
weary 15
to 15
argue 15
but 15
i 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
reasonably 15
awake 15
or 15
i 15
would 15
not 15
have 15
received 15
the 15
impression 15
that 15
was 15
creeping 15
into 15
me 15
it 15
was 15
not 15
unlike 15
one 15
i 15
had 15
last 15
winter 15
and 15
i 15
shivered 15
though 15
the 15
night 15
was 15
hot 15
the 15
feeling 15
grew 15
until 15
the 15
atmosphere 15
in 15
the 15
courtroom 15
was 15
exactly 15
the 15
same 15
as 15
a 15
cold 15
february 15
morning 15
when 15
the 15
mockingbirds 15
were 15
still 15
and 15
the 15
carpenters 15
had 15
stopped 15
hammering 15
on 15
miss 15
maudies 15
new 15
house 15
and 15
every 15
wood 15
door 15
in 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
was 15
shut 15
as 15
tight 15
as 15
the 15
doors 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
a 15
deserted 15
waiting 15
empty 15
street 15
and 15
the 15
courtroom 15
was 15
packed 15
with 15
people 15
a 15
steaming 15
summer 15
night 15
was 15
no 15
different 15
from 15
a 15
winter 15
morning 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
who 15
had 15
entered 15
the 15
courtroom 15
and 15
was 15
talking 15
to 15
atticus 15
might 15
have 15
been 15
wearing 15
his 15
high 15
boots 15
and 15
lumber 15
jacket 15
atticus 15
had 15
stopped 15
his 15
tranquil 15
journey 15
and 15
had 15
put 15
his 15
foot 15
onto 15
the 15
bottom 15
rung 15
of 15
a 15
chair 15
as 15
he 15
listened 15
to 15
what 15
mr 15
tate 15
was 15
saying 15
he 15
ran 15
his 15
hand 15
slowly 15
up 15
and 15
down 15
his 15
thigh 15
i 15
expected 15
mr 15
tate 15
to 15
say 15
any 15
minute 15
take 15
him 15
mr 15
finch 15
but 15
mr 15
tate 15
said 15
this 15
court 15
will 15
come 15
to 15
order 15
in 15
a 15
voice 15
that 15
rang 15
with 15
authority 15
and 15
the 15
heads 15
below 15
us 15
jerked 15
up 15
mr 15
tate 15
left 15
the 15
room 15
and 15
returned 15
with 15
tom 15
robinson 15
he 15
steered 15
tom 15
to 15
his 15
place 15
beside 15
atticus 15
and 15
stood 15
there 15
judge 15
taylor 15
had 15
roused 15
himself 15
to 15
sudden 15
alertness 15
and 15
was 15
sitting 15
up 15
straight 15
looking 15
at 15
the 15
empty 15
jury 15
box 15
what 15
happened 15
after 15
that 15
had 15
a 15
dreamlike 15
quality 15
in 15
a 15
dream 15
i 15
saw 15
the 15
jury 15
return 15
moving 15
like 15
underwater 15
swimmers 15
and 15
judge 15
taylors 15
voice 15
came 15
from 15
far 15
away 15
and 15
was 15
tiny 15
i 15
saw 15
something 15
only 15
a 15
lawyers 15
child 15
could 15
be 15
expected 15
to 15
see 15
could 15
be 15
expected 15
to 15
watch 15
for 15
and 15
it 15
was 15
like 15
watching 15
atticus 15
walk 15
into 15
the 15
street 15
raise 15
a 15
rifle 15
to 15
his 15
shoulder 15
and 15
pull 15
the 15
trigger 15
but 15
watching 15
all 15
the 15
time 15
knowing 15
that 15
the 15
gun 15
was 15
empty 15
a 15
jury 15
never 15
looks 15
at 15
a 15
defendant 15
it 15
has 15
convicted 15
and 15
when 15
this 15
jury 15
came 15
in 15
not 15
one 15
of 15
them 15
looked 15
at 15
tom 15
robinson 15
the 15
foreman 15
handed 15
a 15
piece 15
of 15
paper 15
to 15
mr 15
tate 15
who 15
handed 15
it 15
to 15
the 15
clerk 15
who 15
handed 15
it 15
to 15
the 15
judge 15
i 15
shut 15
my 15
eyes 15
judge 15
taylor 15
was 15
polling 15
the 15
jury 15
guilty 15
guilty 15
guilty 15
guilty 15
i 15
peeked 15
at 15
jem 15
his 15
hands 15
were 15
white 15
from 15
gripping 15
the 15
balcony 15
rail 15
and 15
his 15
shoulders 15
jerked 15
as 15
if 15
each 15
guilty 15
was 15
a 15
separate 15
stab 15
between 15
them 15
judge 15
taylor 15
was 15
saying 15
something 15
his 15
gavel 15
was 15
in 15
his 15
fist 15
but 15
he 15
wasnt 15
using 15
it 15
dimly 15
i 15
saw 15
atticus 15
pushing 15
papers 15
from 15
the 15
table 15
into 15
his 15
briefcase 15
he 15
snapped 15
it 15
shut 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
court 15
reporter 15
and 15
said 15
something 15
nodded 15
to 15
mr 15
gilmer 15
and 15
then 15
went 15
to 15
tom 15
robinson 15
and 15
whispered 15
something 15
to 15
him 15
atticus 15
put 15
his 15
hand 15
on 15
toms 15
shoulder 15
as 15
he 15
whispered 15
atticus 15
took 15
his 15
coat 15
off 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
his 15
chair 15
and 15
pulled 15
it 15
over 15
his 15
shoulder 15
then 15
he 15
left 15
the 15
courtroom 15
but 15
not 15
by 15
his 15
usual 15
exit 15
he 15
must 15
have 15
wanted 15
to 15
go 15
home 15
the 15
short 15
way 15
because 15
he 15
walked 15
quickly 15
down 15
the 15
middle 15
aisle 15
toward 15
the 15
south 15
exit 15
i 15
followed 15
the 15
top 15
of 15
his 15
head 15
as 15
he 15
made 15
his 15
way 15
to 15
the 15
door 15
he 15
did 15
not 15
look 15
up 15
someone 15
was 15
punching 15
me 15
but 15
i 15
was 15
reluctant 15
to 15
take 15
my 15
eyes 15
from 15
the 15
people 15
below 15
us 15
and 15
from 15
the 15
image 15
of 15
atticuss 15
lonely 15
walk 15
down 15
the 15
aisle 15
miss 15
jean 15
louise 15
i 15
looked 15
around 15
they 15
were 15
standing 15
all 15
around 15
us 15
and 15
in 15
the 15
balcony 15
on 15
the 15
opposite 15
wall 15
the 15
negroes 15
were 15
getting 15
to 15
their 15
feet 15
reverend 15
sykess 15
voice 15
was 15
as 15
distant 15
as 15
judge 15
taylors 15
miss 15
jean 15
louise 15
stand 15
up 15
your 15
fathers 15
passin 15
it 15
was 15
jems 15
turn 15
to 15
cry 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
streaked 15
with 15
angry 15
tears 15
as 15
we 15
made 15
our 15
way 15
through 15
the 15
cheerful 15
crowd 15
it 15
aint 15
right 15
he 15
muttered 15
all 15
the 15
way 15
to 15
the 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
square 15
where 15
we 15
found 15
atticus 15
waiting 15
atticus 15
was 15
standing 15
under 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
looking 15
as 15
though 15
nothing 15
had 15
happened 15
his 15
vest 15
was 15
buttoned 15
his 15
collar 15
and 15
tie 15
were 15
neatly 15
in 15
place 15
his 15
watchchain 15
glistened 15
he 15
was 15
his 15
impassive 15
self 15
again 15
it 15
aint 15
right 15
atticus 15
said 15
jem 15
no 15
son 15
its 15
not 15
right 15
we 15
walked 15
home 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
was 15
waiting 15
up 15
she 15
was 15
in 15
her 15
dressing 15
gown 15
and 15
i 15
could 15
have 15
sworn 15
she 15
had 15
on 15
her 15
corset 15
underneath 15
it 15
im 15
sorry 15
brother 15
she 15
murmured 15
having 15
never 15
heard 15
her 15
call 15
atticus 15
brother 15
before 15
i 15
stole 15
a 15
glance 15
at 15
jem 15
but 15
he 15
was 15
not 15
listening 15
he 15
would 15
look 15
up 15
at 15
atticus 15
then 15
down 15
at 15
the 15
floor 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
he 15
thought 15
atticus 15
somehow 15
responsible 15
for 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
conviction 15
is 15
he 15
all 15
right 15
aunty 15
asked 15
indicating 15
jem 15
hell 15
be 15
so 15
presently 15
said 15
atticus 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
little 15
too 15
strong 15
for 15
him 15
our 15
father 15
sighed 15
im 15
going 15
to 15
bed 15
he 15
said 15
if 15
i 15
dont 15
wake 15
up 15
in 15
the 15
morning 15
dont 15
call 15
me 15
i 15
didnt 15
think 15
it 15
wise 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
to 15
let 15
them 15
this 15
is 15
their 15
home 15
sister 15
said 15
atticus 15
weve 15
made 15
it 15
this 15
way 15
for 15
them 15
they 15
might 15
as 15
well 15
learn 15
to 15
cope 15
with 15
it 15
but 15
they 15
dont 15
have 15
to 15
go 15
to 15
the 15
courthouse 15
and 15
wallow 15
in 15
it 15
its 15
just 15
as 15
much 15
maycomb 15
county 15
as 15
missionary 15
teas 15
atticus 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
eyes 15
were 15
anxious 15
you 15
are 15
the 15
last 15
person 15
i 15
thought 15
would 15
turn 15
bitter 15
over 15
this 15
im 15
not 15
bitter 15
just 15
tired 15
im 15
going 15
to 15
bed 15
atticus 15
said 15
jem 15
bleakly 15
he 15
turned 15
in 15
the 15
doorway 15
what 15
son 15
how 15
could 15
they 15
do 15
it 15
how 15
could 15
they 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
but 15
they 15
did 15
it 15
theyve 15
done 15
it 15
before 15
and 15
they 15
did 15
it 15
tonight 15
and 15
theyll 15
do 15
it 15
again 15
and 15
when 15
they 15
do 15
it 15
seems 15
that 15
only 15
children 15
weep 15
good 15
night 15
but 15
things 15
are 15
always 15
better 15
in 15
the 15
morning 15

sat 15
quietly 15
in 15
a 15
kitchen 15
chair 15
watching 15

indoors 15
when 15
miss 15
maudie 15
wanted 15
to 15
say 15
something 15
lengthy 15
she 15
spread 15
her 15
fingers 15
on 15
her 15
knees 15
and 15
settled 15
her 15
bridgework 15

she 15
did 15
and 15
we 15

simply 15
want 15
to 15
tell 15
you 15
that 15
there 15

our 15
unpleasant 15
jobs 15

his 15

that 15
judge 15
taylor 15
naming 15
atticus 15
to 15
defend 15
that 15
boy 15

no 15
accident 15
that 15
judge 15
taylor 15

have 15
had 15
his 15
reasons 15
for 15
naming 15

a 15
thought 15

usually 15
given 15
to 15
maxwell 15

so 15
long 15
in 15
a 15

an 15
obscure 15
war 15
that 15
plus 15
atticuss 15
peaceful 15
reaction 15
probably 15
prompted 15
him 15
to 15
inquire 15

proud 15
to 15
fight 15
you 15
niggerlovin 15

we 15
did 15
and 15
he 15
said 15
nonsense 15
dill 15
was 15
of 15
the 15
opinion 15
that 15
an 15
appeal 15
to 15
atticuss 15
better 15
nature 15
might 15
work 15
after 15
all 15
we 15
would 15
starve 15
if 15
mr 15
ewell 15

him 15
besides 15
be 15
raised 15
exclusively 15
by 15

all 15

the 15
first 15
thing 15

before 15
atticus 15
was 15
under 15

ground 15

would 15
be 15
to 15
fire 15
calpurnia 15
jem 15
said 15
it 15
might 15
work 15
if 15
i 15
cried 15
and 15
flung 15
a 15
fit 15
being 15
young 15
and 15
a 15
girl 15
that 15
didnt 15
work 15
either 15
but 15
when 15
he 15
noticed 15
us 15
dragging 15
around 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
not 15
eating 15
taking 15
little 15
interest 15
in 15
our 15
normal 15
pursuits 15
atticus 15
discovered 15
how 15
deeply 15
frightened 15
we 15
were 15
he 15
tempted 15
jem 15
with 15
a 15
new 15
football 15
magazine 15
one 15
night 15
when 15
he 15
saw 15
jem 15
flip 15
the 15
pages 15
and 15
toss 15
it 15
aside 15
he 15
said 15
whats 15
bothering 15
you 15
son 15
jem 15
came 15
to 15
the 15
point 15
mr 15
ewell 15
what 15
has 15
happened 15
nothings 15
happened 15

scared 15
for 15
you 15
and 15
we 15
think 15
you 15
oughta 15
do 15
something 15
about 15
him 15
atticus 15
smiled 15
wryly 15
do 15
what 15
put 15
him 15
under 15
a 15
peace 15
bond 15
when 15
a 15
man 15
says 15
hes 15
gonna 15
get 15
you 15
looks 15
like 15
he 15
means 15
it 15
he 15
meant 15
it 15
when 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
said 15
atticus 15
jem 15
see 15
if 15
you 15
can 15
stand 15
in 15
bob 15
ewells 15
shoes 15
a 15
minute 15
i 15
destroyed 15
his 15
last 15
shred 15
of 15
credibility 15
at 15
that 15
trial 15
if 15
he 15
had 15
any 15
to 15
begin 15
with 15
the 15
man 15
had 15
to 15
have 15
some 15
kind 15
of 15
comeback 15
his 15
kind 15
always 15
does 15
so 15
if 15
spitting 15
in 15
my 15
face 15
and 15
threatening 15
me 15
saved 15
mayella 15
ewell 15
one 15
extra 15
beating 15
thats 15
something 15
ill 15
gladly 15
take 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
take 15
it 15
out 15
on 15
somebody 15
and 15
id 15
rather 15
it 15
be 15
me 15
than 15
that 15
houseful 15
of 15
children 15
out 15
there 15
you 15
understand 15
jem 15
nodded 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
entered 15
the 15
room 15
as 15
atticus 15
was 15
saying 15
we 15
dont 15
have 15
anything 15
to 15
fear 15
from 15
bob 15
ewell 15
he 15
got 15
it 15
all 15
out 15
of 15
his 15
system 15
that 15
morning 15
i 15
wouldnt 15
be 15
so 15
sure 15
of 15
that 15
atticus 15
she 15
said 15
his 15
kindd 15
do 15
anything 15
to 15
pay 15
off 15
a 15
grudge 15
you 15
know 15
how 15
those 15
people 15
are 15
what 15
on 15
earth 15
could 15
ewell 15
do 15
to 15
me 15
sister 15
something 15
furtive 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
said 15
you 15
may 15
count 15
on 15
that 15
nobody 15
has 15
much 15
chance 15
to 15
be 15
furtive 15
in 15
maycomb 15
atticus 15
answered 15
after 15
that 15
we 15
were 15
not 15
afraid 15
summer 15
was 15
melting 15
away 15
and 15
we 15
made 15
the 15
most 15
of 15
it 15
atticus 15
assured 15
us 15
that 15
nothing 15
would 15
happen 15
to 15
tom 15
robinson 15
until 15
the 15
higher 15
court 15
reviewed 15
his 15
case 15
and 15
that 15
tom 15
had 15
a 15
good 15
chance 15
of 15
going 15
free 15
or 15
at 15
least 15
of 15
having 15
a 15
new 15
trial 15
he 15
was 15
at 15
enfield 15
prison 15
farm 15
seventy 15
miles 15
away 15
in 15
chester 15
county 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
if 15
toms 15
wife 15
and 15
children 15
were 15
allowed 15
to 15
visit 15
him 15
but 15
atticus 15
said 15
no 15
if 15
he 15
loses 15
his 15
appeal 15
i 15
asked 15
one 15
evening 15
whatll 15
happen 15
to 15
him 15
hell 15
go 15
to 15
the 15
chair 15
said 15
atticus 15
unless 15
the 15
governor 15
commutes 15
his 15
sentence 15
not 15
time 15
to 15
worry 15
yet 15
scout 15
weve 15
got 15
a 15
good 15
chance 15
jem 15
was 15
sprawled 15
on 15
the 15
sofa 15
reading 15
popular 15
mechanics 15
he 15
looked 15
up 15
it 15
aint 15
right 15
he 15
didnt 15
kill 15
anybody 15
even 15
if 15
he 15
was 15
guilty 15
he 15
didnt 15
take 15

a 15
capital 15
offense 15
in 15

atticus 15
yessir 15
but 15
the 15
jury 15
didnt 15
have 15
to 15
give 15
him 15

if 15
they 15
wanted 15
to 15

on 15
a 15

like 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
either 15
a 15
straight 15
acquittal 15
or 15
nothing 15
jem 15
was 15
shaking 15
his 15
head 15
i 15
know 15
its 15
not 15
right 15
but 15
i 15
cant 15
figure 15
out 15
whats 15
wrong 15
maybe 15
rape 15
shouldnt 15
be 15
a 15
capital 15
offense 15
atticus 15
dropped 15
his 15
newspaper 15
beside 15
his 15
chair 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
didnt 15
have 15
any 15
quarrel 15
with 15
the 15
rape 15
statute 15
none 15
what 15
ever 15
but 15
he 15
did 15
have 15
deep 15
misgivings 15
when 15
the 15
state 15
asked 15
for 15
and 15
the 15
jury 15
gave 15
a 15
death 15
penalty 15
on 15
purely 15
circumstantial 15
evidence 15
he 15
glanced 15
at 15
me 15
saw 15
i 15
was 15
listening 15
and 15
made 15
it 15
easier 15
i 15
mean 15
before 15
a 15
man 15
is 15
sentenced 15
to 15
death 15
for 15
murder 15
say 15
there 15
should 15
be 15
one 15
or 15
two 15
eyewitnesses 15
some 15
one 15
should 15
be 15
able 15
to 15
say 15
yes 15
i 15
was 15
there 15
and 15
saw 15
him 15
pull 15
the 15
trigger 15
but 15
lots 15
of 15
folks 15
have 15
been 15
hung 15
hanged 15
on 15
circumstantial 15
evidence 15
said 15
jem 15
i 15
know 15
and 15
lots 15
of 15
em 15
probably 15
deserved 15
it 15
too 15
but 15
in 15
the 15
absence 15
of 15
eyewitnesses 15
theres 15
always 15
a 15
doubt 15
some 15
times 15
only 15
the 15
shadow 15
of 15
a 15
doubt 15
the 15
law 15
says 15
reasonable 15
doubt 15
but 15
i 15
think 15
a 15
defendants 15
entitled 15
to 15
the 15
shadow 15
of 15
a 15
doubt 15
theres 15
always 15
the 15
possibility 15
no 15
matter 15
how 15
improbable 15
that 15
hes 15
innocent 15
then 15
it 15
all 15
goes 15
back 15
to 15
the 15
jury 15
then 15
we 15
oughta 15
do 15
away 15
with 15
juries 15
jem 15
was 15
adamant 15
atticus 15
tried 15
hard 15
not 15
to 15
smile 15
but 15
couldnt 15
help 15
it 15
youre 15
rather 15
hard 15
on 15
us 15
son 15
i 15
think 15
maybe 15
there 15
might 15
be 15
a 15
better 15
way 15
change 15
the 15
law 15
change 15
it 15
so 15
that 15
only 15
judges 15
have 15
the 15
power 15
of 15
fixing 15
the 15
penalty 15
in 15
capital 15
cases 15
then 15
go 15
up 15
to 15
montgomery 15
and 15
change 15
the 15
law 15
youd 15
be 15
surprised 15
how 15
hard 15
thatd 15
be 15
i 15
wont 15
live 15
to 15
see 15
the 15
law 15
changed 15
and 15
if 15
you 15
live 15
to 15
see 15
it 15
youll 15
be 15
an 15
old 15
man 15
this 15
was 15
not 15
good 15
enough 15
for 15
jem 15
no 15
sir 15
they 15
oughta 15
do 15
away 15
with 15
juries 15
he 15
wasnt 15
guilty 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
and 15
they 15
said 15
he 15
was 15
if 15
you 15
had 15
been 15
on 15
that 15
jury 15
son 15
and 15
eleven 15
other 15
boys 15
like 15
you 15
tom 15
would 15
be 15
a 15
free 15
man 15
said 15
atticus 15
so 15
far 15
nothing 15
in 15
your 15
life 15
has 15
interfered 15
with 15
your 15
reasoning 15
process 15
those 15
are 15
twelve 15
reasonable 15
men 15
in 15
everyday 15
life 15
toms 15
jury 15
but 15
you 15
saw 15
something 15
come 15
between 15
them 15
and 15
reason 15
you 15
saw 15
the 15
same 15
thing 15
that 15
night 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
jail 15
when 15
that 15
crew 15
went 15
away 15
they 15
didnt 15
go 15
as 15
reasonable 15
men 15
they 15
went 15
because 15
we 15
were 15
there 15
theres 15
something 15
in 15
our 15
world 15
that 15
makes 15
men 15
lose 15
their 15
heads 15
they 15
couldnt 15
be 15
fair 15
if 15
they 15
tried 15
in 15
our 15
courts 15
when 15
its 15
a 15
white 15
mans 15
word 15
against 15
a 15
black 15
mans 15
the 15
white 15
man 15
always 15
wins 15
theyre 15
ugly 15
but 15
those 15
are 15
the 15
facts 15
of 15
life 15
doesnt 15
make 15
it 15
right 15
said 15
jem 15
stolidly 15
he 15
beat 15
his 15
fist 15
softly 15
on 15
his 15
knee 15
you 15
just 15
cant 15
convict 15
a 15
man 15
on 15
evidence 15
like 15
that 15
you 15
cant 15
you 15
couldnt 15
but 15
they 15
could 15
and 15
did 15
the 15
older 15
you 15
grow 15
the 15
more 15
of 15
it 15
youll 15
see 15
the 15
one 15
place 15
where 15
a 15
man 15
ought 15
to 15
get 15
a 15
square 15
deal 15
is 15
in 15
a 15
courtroom 15
be 15
he 15
any 15
color 15
of 15
the 15
rainbow 15
but 15
people 15
have 15
a 15
way 15
of 15
carrying 15
their 15
resentments 15
right 15
into 15
a 15
jury 15
box 15
as 15
you 15
grow 15
older 15
youll 15
see 15
white 15
men 15
cheat 15
black 15
men 15
every 15
day 15
of 15
your 15
life 15
but 15
let 15
me 15
tell 15
you 15
something 15
and 15
dont 15
you 15
forget 15
it 15
whenever 15
a 15
white 15
man 15
does 15
that 15
to 15
a 15
black 15
man 15
no 15
matter 15
who 15
he 15
is 15
how 15
rich 15
he 15
is 15
or 15
how 15
fine 15
a 15
family 15
he 15
comes 15
from 15
that 15
white 15
man 15
is 15
trash 15
atticus 15
was 15
speaking 15
so 15
quietly 15
his 15
last 15
word 15
crashed 15
on 15
our 15
ears 15
i 15
looked 15
up 15
and 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
vehement 15
theres 15
nothing 15
more 15
sickening 15
to 15
me 15
than 15
a 15
lowgrade 15
white 15
man 15
wholl 15
take 15
advantage 15
of 15
a 15
negros 15
ignorance 15
dont 15
fool 15
yourselves 15
its 15
all 15
adding 15
up 15
and 15
one 15
of 15
these 15
days 15
were 15
going 15
to 15
pay 15
the 15
bill 15
for 15
it 15
i 15
hope 15
its 15
not 15
in 15
you 15
childrens 15
time 15
jem 15
was 15
scratching 15
his 15
head 15
suddenly 15
his 15
eyes 15
widened 15
atticus 15
he 15
said 15
why 15
dont 15
people 15
like 15
us 15
and 15
miss 15
maudie 15
ever 15
sit 15
on 15
juries 15
you 15
never 15
see 15
anybody 15
from 15
maycomb 15
on 15
a 15
jury 15
they 15
all 15
come 15
from 15
out 15
in 15
the 15
woods 15
atticus 15
leaned 15
back 15
in 15
his 15
rockingchair 15
for 15
some 15
reason 15
he 15
looked 15
pleased 15
with 15
jem 15
i 15
was 15
wondering 15
when 15
thatd 15
occur 15
to 15
you 15
he 15
said 15
there 15
are 15
lots 15
of 15
reasons 15
for 15
one 15
thing 15
miss 15
maudie 15
cant 15
serve 15
on 15
a 15
jury 15
because 15
shes 15
a 15
woman 15
you 15
mean 15
women 15
in 15
alabama 15
cant 15
i 15
was 15
indignant 15
i 15
do 15
i 15
guess 15
its 15
to 15
protect 15
our 15
frail 15
ladies 15
from 15
sordid 15
cases 15
like 15
toms 15
besides 15
atticus 15
grinned 15
i 15
doubt 15
if 15
wed 15
ever 15
get 15
a 15
complete 15
case 15
tried 15
the 15
ladiesd 15
be 15
interrupting 15
to 15
ask 15
questions 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
laughed 15
miss 15
maudie 15
on 15
a 15
jury 15
would 15
be 15
impressive 15
i 15
thought 15
of 15
old 15
mrs 15
dubose 15
in 15
her 15
wheelchair 15
stop 15
that 15
rapping 15
john 15
taylor 15
i 15
want 15
to 15
ask 15
this 15
man 15
something 15
perhaps 15
our 15
forefathers 15
were 15
wise 15
atticus 15
was 15
saying 15
with 15
people 15
like 15
us 15
thats 15
our 15
share 15
of 15
the 15
bill 15
we 15
generally 15
get 15
the 15
juries 15
we 15
deserve 15
our 15
stout 15
maycomb 15
citizens 15
arent 15
interested 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
in 15
the 15
second 15
place 15
theyre 15
afraid 15
then 15
theyre 15
afraid 15
why 15
asked 15
jem 15
well 15
what 15
if 15
say 15
mr 15
link 15
deas 15
had 15
to 15
decide 15
the 15
amount 15
of 15
damages 15
to 15
award 15
say 15
miss 15
maudie 15
when 15
miss 15
rachel 15
ran 15
over 15
her 15
with 15
a 15
car 15
link 15
wouldnt 15
like 15
the 15
thought 15
of 15
losing 15
either 15
ladys 15
business 15
at 15
his 15
store 15
would 15
he 15
so 15
he 15
tells 15
judge 15
taylor 15
that 15
he 15
cant 15
serve 15
on 15
the 15
jury 15
because 15
he 15
doesnt 15
have 15
anybody 15
to 15
keep 15
store 15
for 15
him 15
while 15
hes 15
gone 15
so 15
judge 15
taylor 15
excuses 15
him 15
sometimes 15
he 15
excuses 15
him 15
wrathfully 15
whatd 15
make 15
him 15
think 15
either 15
one 15
of 15
emd 15
stop 15
trading 15
with 15
him 15
i 15
asked 15
jem 15
said 15
miss 15
rachel 15
would 15
miss 15
maudie 15
wouldnt 15
but 15
a 15
jurys 15
votes 15
secret 15
atticus 15
our 15
father 15
chuckled 15
youve 15
many 15
more 15
miles 15
to 15
go 15
son 15
a 15
jurys 15
votes 15
supposed 15
to 15
be 15
secret 15
serving 15
on 15
a 15
jury 15
forces 15
a 15
man 15
to 15
make 15
up 15
his 15
mind 15
and 15
declare 15
himself 15
about 15
something 15
men 15
dont 15
like 15
to 15
do 15
that 15
sometimes 15
its 15
unpleasant 15
toms 15
jury 15
sho 15
made 15
up 15
its 15
mind 15
in 15
a 15
hurry 15
jem 15
muttered 15
atticuss 15
fingers 15
went 15
to 15
his 15
watchpocket 15
no 15
it 15
didnt 15
he 15
said 15
more 15
to 15
himself 15
than 15
to 15
us 15
that 15
was 15
the 15
one 15
thing 15
that 15
made 15
me 15
think 15
well 15
this 15
may 15
be 15
the 15
shadow 15
of 15
a 15
beginning 15
that 15
jury 15
took 15
a 15
few 15
hours 15
an 15
inevitable 15
verdict 15
maybe 15
but 15
usually 15
it 15
takes 15
em 15
just 15
a 15
few 15
minutes 15
this 15
time 15
he 15
broke 15
off 15
and 15
looked 15
at 15
us 15
you 15
might 15
like 15
to 15
know 15
that 15
there 15
was 15
one 15
fellow 15
who 15
took 15
considerable 15
wearing 15
down 15
in 15
the 15
beginning 15
he 15
was 15
rarin 15
for 15
an 15
outright 15
acquittal 15
who 15
jem 15
was 15
astonished 15
atticuss 15
eyes 15
twinkled 15
its 15
not 15
for 15
me 15
to 15
say 15
but 15
ill 15
tell 15
you 15
this 15
much 15
he 15
was 15
one 15
of 15
your 15
old 15
sarum 15
friends 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
jem 15
yelped 15
one 15
of 15
i 15
didnt 15
recognize 15
any 15
of 15
em 15
youre 15
jokin 15
he 15
looked 15
at 15
atticus 15
from 15
the 15
corners 15
of 15
his 15
eyes 15
one 15
of 15
their 15
connections 15
on 15
a 15
hunch 15
i 15
didnt 15
strike 15
him 15

atticus 15
said 15
you 15
just 15
had 15
to 15
know 15
em 15
he 15
said 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
hadnt 15
taken 15
anything 15
from 15
or 15
off 15
of 15
anybody 15
since 15
they 15
migrated 15
to 15
the 15
new 15
world 15
he 15
said 15
the 15
other 15
thing 15
about 15
them 15
was 15
once 15
you 15
earned 15
their 15
respect 15
they 15
were 15
for 15
you 15
tooth 15
and 15
nail 15
atticus 15
said 15
he 15
had 15
a 15
feeling 15
nothing 15
more 15
than 15
a 15
suspicion 15
that 15
they 15
left 15
the 15
jail 15
that 15
night 15
with 15
considerable 15
respect 15
for 15
the 15
finches 15
then 15
too 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
took 15
a 15
thunderbolt 15
plus 15
another 15
cunningham 15
to 15
make 15
one 15
of 15
them 15
change 15
his 15
mind 15
if 15
wed 15

two 15
of 15
that 15
crowd 15
wedve 15
had 15
a 15
hung 15
jury 15
jem 15
said 15
slowly 15
you 15
mean 15
you 15
actually 15
put 15
on 15
the 15
jury 15
a 15
man 15
who 15
wanted 15
to 15
kill 15
you 15
the 15
night 15
before 15
how 15
could 15
you 15
take 15
such 15
a 15
risk 15
atticus 15
how 15
could 15
you 15
when 15
you 15
analyze 15
it 15
there 15
was 15
little 15
risk 15
theres 15
no 15
difference 15
between 15
one 15
man 15
whos 15
going 15
to 15
convict 15
and 15
another 15
man 15
whos 15
going 15
to 15
convict 15
is 15
there 15
theres 15
a 15
faint 15
difference 15
between 15
a 15
man 15
whos 15
going 15
to 15
convict 15
and 15
a 15
man 15
whos 15
a 15
little 15
disturbed 15
in 15
his 15
mind 15
isnt 15
there 15
he 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
uncertainty 15
on 15
the 15
whole 15
list 15
what 15
kin 15

mile 15
wide 15
finch 15
women 15
arent 15
interested 15
in 15
that 15
sort 15
of 15
people 15
aunty 15
said 15
jem 15
she 15
aint 15
nine 15
yet 15
she 15
may 15
as 15
well 15
learn 15
it 15
now 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
had 15
spoken 15
i 15
was 15
reminded 15
vividly 15
of 15
the 15
last 15
time 15
she 15
had 15
put 15
her 15
foot 15
down 15
i 15
never 15
knew 15
why 15
it 15
was 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
absorbed 15
with 15
plans 15
to 15
visit 15
calpurnias 15
house 15
i 15
was 15
curious 15
interested 15
i 15
wanted 15
to 15
be 15
her 15
company 15
to 15
see 15
how 15
she 15
lived 15
who 15
her 15
friends 15
were 15
i 15
might 15
as 15
well 15
have 15
wanted 15
to 15
see 15
the 15
other 15
side 15
of 15
the 15
moon 15
this 15
time 15
the 15
tactics 15
were 15
different 15
but 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
aim 15
was 15
the 15
same 15
perhaps 15
this 15
was 15
why 15
she 15
had 15
come 15
to 15
live 15
with 15
us 15
to 15
help 15
us 15
choose 15
our 15
friends 15
i 15
would 15
hold 15
her 15
off 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
if 15
theyre 15
good 15
folks 15
then 15
why 15
cant 15
i 15
be 15
nice 15
to 15
walter 15
i 15
didnt 15
say 15
not 15
to 15
be 15
nice 15
to 15
him 15
you 15
should 15
be 15
friendly 15
and 15
polite 15
to 15
him 15
you 15
should 15
be 15
gracious 15
to 15
everybody 15
dear 15
but 15
you 15
dont 15
have 15
to 15
invite 15
him 15
home 15
what 15
if 15
he 15
was 15
kin 15
to 15
us 15
aunty 15
the 15
fact 15
is 15
that 15
he 15
is 15
not 15
kin 15
to 15
us 15
but 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
my 15
answer 15
would 15
be 15
the 15
same 15
aunty 15
jem 15
spoke 15
up 15
atticus 15
says 15
you 15
can 15
choose 15
your 15
friends 15
but 15
you 15
sho 15
cant 15
choose 15
your 15
family 15
an 15
theyre 15
still 15
kin 15
to 15
you 15
no 15
matter 15
whether 15
you 15
acknowledge 15
em 15
or 15
not 15
and 15
it 15
makes 15
you 15
look 15
right 15
silly 15
when 15
you 15
dont 15
thats 15
your 15
father 15
all 15
over 15
again 15
said 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
and 15
i 15
still 15
say 15
that 15
jean 15
louise 15
will 15
not 15
invite 15
walter 15
cunningham 15
to 15
this 15
house 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
her 15
double 15
first 15
cousin 15
once 15
removed 15
he 15
would 15
still 15
not 15
be 15
received 15
in 15
this 15
house 15
unless 15
he 15
comes 15
to 15
see 15
atticus 15
on 15
business 15
now 15
that 15
is 15
that 15
she 15
had 15
said 15
indeed 15
not 15
but 15
this 15
time 15
she 15
would 15
give 15
her 15
reasons 15
but 15
i 15
want 15
to 15
play 15
with 15
walter 15
aunty 15
why 15
cant 15
i 15
she 15
took 15
off 15
her 15
glasses 15
and 15
stared 15
at 15
me 15
ill 15
tell 15
you 15
why 15
she 15
said 15
because 15
he 15
is 15
trash 15
thats 15
why 15
you 15
cant 15
play 15
with 15
him 15
ill 15
not 15
have 15
you 15
around 15
him 15
picking 15
up 15
his 15
habits 15
and 15
learning 15
lordknowswhat 15
youre 15
enough 15
of 15
a 15
problem 15
to 15
your 15
father 15
as 15
it 15
is 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
what 15
i 15
would 15
have 15
done 15
but 15
jem 15
stopped 15
me 15
he 15
caught 15
me 15
by 15
the 15
shoulders 15
put 15
his 15
arm 15
around 15
me 15
and 15
led 15
me 15
sobbing 15
in 15
fury 15
to 15
his 15
bedroom 15
atticus 15
heard 15
us 15
and 15
poked 15
his 15
head 15
around 15
the 15
door 15
s 15
all 15
right 15
sir 15
jem 15
said 15
gruffly 15
s 15
not 15
anything 15
atticus 15
went 15
away 15
have 15
a 15
chew 15
scout 15
jem 15
dug 15
into 15
his 15
pocket 15
and 15
extracted 15
a 15
tootsie 15
roll 15
it 15
took 15
a 15
few 15
minutes 15
to 15
work 15
the 15
candy 15
into 15
a 15
comfortable 15
wad 15
inside 15
my 15
jaw 15
jem 15
was 15
rearranging 15
the 15
objects 15
on 15
his 15
dresser 15
his 15
hair 15
stuck 15
up 15
behind 15
and 15
down 15
in 15
front 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
if 15
it 15
would 15
ever 15
look 15
like 15
a 15
mans 15
maybe 15
if 15
he 15
shaved 15
it 15
off 15
and 15
started 15
over 15
his 15
hair 15
would 15
grow 15
back 15
neatly 15
in 15
place 15
his 15
eyebrows 15
were 15
becoming 15
heavier 15
and 15
i 15
noticed 15
a 15
new 15
slimness 15
about 15
his 15
body 15
he 15
was 15
growing 15
taller 15
when 15
he 15
looked 15
around 15
he 15
must 15
have 15
thought 15
i 15
would 15
start 15
crying 15
again 15
for 15
he 15
said 15
show 15
you 15
something 15
if 15
you 15
wont 15
tell 15
anybody 15
i 15
said 15
what 15
he 15
unbuttoned 15
his 15
shirt 15
grinning 15
shyly 15
well 15
what 15
well 15
cant 15
you 15
see 15

the 15
only 15
reason 15
i 15

med 15
be 15
in 15

walters 15
as 15
smart 15
as 15
he 15
can 15
be 15
he 15
just 15

one 15
kind 15
of 15
folks 15
folks 15
jem 15
turned 15
around 15
and 15
punched 15
his 15
pillow 15
when 15
he 15
settled 15
back 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
cloudy 15
he 15
was 15
going 15
into 15
one 15
of 15
his 15
declines 15
and 15
i 15
grew 15
wary 15
his 15
brows 15
came 15
together 15
his 15
mouth 15
became 15
a 15
thin 15
line 15
he 15
was 15
silent 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
thats 15
what 15
i 15
thought 15
too 15
he 15
said 15
at 15
last 15
when 15
i 15
was 15
your 15
age 15
if 15
theres 15
just 15
one 15
kind 15
of 15
folks 15
why 15
cant 15
they 15
get 15
along 15
with 15
each 15
other 15
if 15
theyre 15
all 15
alike 15
why 15
do 15
they 15
go 15
out 15
of 15
their 15
way 15
to 15
despise 15
each 15
other 15
scout 15
i 15
think 15
im 15
beginning 15
to 15
understand 15
something 15
i 15
think 15
im 15
beginning 15
to 15
understand 15
why 15
boo 15
radleys 15
stayed 15
shut 15
up 15
in 15
the 15
house 15
all 15
this 15
time 15
its 15
because 15
he 15
wants 15
to 15
stay 15
inside 15
calpurnia 15
wore 15
her 15
stiffest 15
starched 15
apron 15
she 15
carried 15
a 15
tray 15
of 15
charlotte 15
she 15
backed 15
up 15
to 15
the 15
swinging 15
door 15
and 15
pressed 15
gently 15
i 15
admired 15
the 15
ease 15
and 15
grace 15
with 15
which 15
she 15
handled 15
heavy 15
loads 15
of 15
dainty 15
things 15
so 15
did 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
i 15
guess 15
because 15
she 15
had 15
let 15
calpurnia 15
serve 15
today 15
august 15
was 15
on 15
the 15
brink 15
of 15
september 15
dill 15
would 15
be 15
leaving 15
for 15
meridian 15
tomorrow 15
today 15
he 15
was 15
off 15
with 15
jem 15
at 15
barkers 15
eddy 15
jem 15
had 15
discovered 15
with 15
angry 15
amazement 15
that 15
nobody 15
had 15
ever 15
bothered 15
to 15
teach 15
dill 15
how 15
to 15
swim 15
a 15
skill 15
jem 15
considered 15
necessary 15
as 15
walking 15
they 15
had 15
spent 15
two 15
afternoons 15
at 15
the 15
creek 15
they 15
said 15
they 15
were 15
going 15
in 15
naked 15
and 15
i 15
couldnt 15
come 15
so 15
i 15
divided 15
the 15
lonely 15
hours 15
between 15
calpurnia 15
and 15
miss 15
maudie 15
today 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
and 15
her 15
missionary 15
circle 15
were 15
fighting 15
the 15
good 15
fight 15
all 15
over 15
the 15
house 15
from 15
the 15
kitchen 15
i 15
heard 15
mrs 15
grace 15
merriweather 15
giving 15
a 15
report 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
on 15
the 15
squalid 15
lives 15
of 15
the 15
mrunas 15
it 15
sounded 15
like 15
to 15
me 15
they 15
put 15
the 15
women 15
out 15
in 15
huts 15
when 15
their 15
time 15
came 15
whatever 15
that 15
was 15
they 15
had 15
no 15
sense 15
of 15
family 15
i 15
knew 15
thatd 15
distress 15
aunty 15
they 15
subjected 15
children 15
to 15
terrible 15
ordeals 15
when 15
they 15
were 15
thirteen 15
they 15
were 15
crawling 15
with 15
yaws 15
and 15
earworms 15
they 15
chewed 15
up 15
and 15
spat 15
out 15
the 15
bark 15
of 15
a 15
tree 15
into 15
a 15
communal 15
pot 15
and 15
then 15
got 15
drunk 15
on 15
it 15
immediately 15
thereafter 15
the 15
ladies 15
adjourned 15
for 15
refreshments 15
i 15
didnt 15
know 15
whether 15
to 15
go 15
into 15
the 15
diningroom 15
or 15

told 15
me 15
to 15
join 15
them 15
for 15
refreshments 15

not 15

pink 15
sunday 15

that 15

calpurnia 15
would 15
have 15
to 15

in 15
the 15
doorway 15

be 15
still 15
as 15

an 15
you 15

back 15
the 15
gentle 15
hum 15
of 15
ladies 15
voices 15

louder 15
as 15
she 15
opened 15
the 15
door 15
why 15

by 15

by 15

pressing 15
my 15
behind 15
against 15
the 15
door 15
as 15
calpurnia 15
had 15

successful 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
smiled 15
brilliantly 15
stay 15
with 15
us 15
jean 15
louise 15
she 15
said 15
this 15
was 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
her 15
campaign 15
to 15
teach 15
me 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
lady 15
it 15
was 15
customary 15
for 15
every 15
circle 15
hostess 15
to 15
invite 15
her 15
neighbors 15
in 15
for 15
refreshments 15
be 15
they 15
baptists 15
or 15
presbyterians 15
which 15
accounted 15
for 15
the 15
presence 15
of 15
miss 15
rachel 15
sober 15
as 15
a 15
judge 15
miss 15
maudie 15
and 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
rather 15
nervous 15
i 15
took 15
a 15
seat 15
beside 15
miss 15
maudie 15
and 15
wondered 15
why 15
ladies 15
put 15
on 15
their 15
hats 15
to 15
go 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
ladies 15
in 15
bunches 15
always 15
filled 15
me 15
with 15
vague 15
apprehension 15
and 15
a 15
firm 15
desire 15
to 15
be 15
elsewhere 15
but 15
this 15
feeling 15
was 15
what 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
called 15
being 15
spoiled 15
the 15
ladies 15
were 15
cool 15
in 15
fragile 15
pastel 15
prints 15
most 15
of 15
them 15
were 15
heavily 15
powdered 15
but 15
unrouged 15
the 15
only 15
lipstick 15
in 15
the 15
room 15
was 15
tangee 15
natural 15
cutex 15
natural 15
sparkled 15
on 15
their 15
fingernails 15
but 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
younger 15
ladies 15
wore 15
rose 15
they 15
smelled 15
heavenly 15
i 15
sat 15
quietly 15
having 15
conquered 15
my 15
hands 15
by 15
tightly 15
gripping 15
the 15
arms 15
of 15
the 15
chair 15
and 15
waited 15
for 15
someone 15
to 15
speak 15
to 15
me 15
miss 15
maudies 15
gold 15
bridgework 15
twinkled 15
youre 15
mighty 15
dressed 15
up 15
miss 15
jean 15
louise 15
she 15
said 15

to 15

funny 15
but 15
the 15
ladies 15
laughed 15
my 15
cheeks 15
grew 15
hot 15
as 15
i 15
realized 15
my 15
mistake 15
but 15
miss 15
maudie 15
looked 15
gravely 15
down 15
at 15
me 15
she 15
never 15
laughed 15
at 15
me 15
unless 15
i 15
meant 15
to 15
be 15
funny 15
in 15
the 15
sudden 15
silence 15
that 15
followed 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
called 15
from 15
across 15
the 15
room 15

thought 15
about 15

i 15
answered 15
grateful 15
that 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
was 15
kind 15
enough 15
to 15
change 15
the 15
subject 15
hurriedly 15
i 15
began 15
choosing 15
my 15
vocation 15
nurse 15
aviator 15
well 15

lawyer 15

already 15
commenced 15
going 15
to 15
court 15
the 15
ladies 15
laughed 15
again 15
that 15
stephanies 15
a 15
card 15
somebody 15
said 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
was 15
encouraged 15
to 15
pursue 15
the 15
subject 15
dont 15
you 15
want 15
to 15
grow 15
up 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
lawyer 15
miss 15
maudies 15
hand 15
touched 15
mine 15
and 15
i 15
answered 15
mildly 15
enough 15
nome 15
just 15
a 15
lady 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
eyed 15
me 15
suspiciously 15
decided 15
that 15
i 15
meant 15
no 15
impertinence 15
and 15
contented 15
herself 15
with 15
well 15
you 15
wont 15
get 15
very 15
far 15
until 15
you 15
start 15
wearing 15
dresses 15
more 15
often 15
miss 15
maudies 15
hand 15
closed 15
tightly 15
on 15
mine 15
and 15
i 15
said 15
nothing 15
its 15
warmth 15
was 15
enough 15
mrs 15
grace 15
merriweather 15
sat 15
on 15
my 15
left 15
and 15
i 15
felt 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
polite 15
to 15
talk 15
to 15
her 15
mr 15
merriweather 15
a 15
faithful 15
methodist 15
under 15
duress 15
apparently 15
saw 15
nothing 15
personal 15
in 15
singing 15
amazing 15
grace 15
how 15
sweet 15
the 15
sound 15
that 15
saved 15
a 15
wretch 15
like 15
me 15
it 15
was 15
the 15
general 15
opinion 15
of 15
maycomb 15
however 15
that 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
had 15
sobered 15
him 15
up 15
and 15
made 15
a 15
reasonably 15
useful 15
citizen 15
of 15
him 15
for 15
certainly 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
was 15
the 15
most 15
devout 15
lady 15
in 15
maycomb 15
i 15
searched 15

necessary 15

merriweathers 15
large 15
brown 15
eyes 15
always 15
filled 15
with 15
tears 15
when 15

considered 15

for 15
the 15
lord 15

reminded 15
of 15
the 15
ancient 15
little 15
organ 15
in 15
the 15
chapel 15
at 15
finchs 15
landing 15
when 15

very 15
small 15
and 15
if 15
i 15
had 15
been 15
very 15
good 15
during 15
the 15
day 15
atticus 15
would 15
let 15
me 15
pump 15
its 15
bellows 15
while 15
he 15
picked 15
out 15
a 15
tune 15
with 15
one 15
finger 15
the 15
last 15
note 15
would 15
linger 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
there 15
was 15
air 15
to 15
sustain 15
it 15
mrs 15

air 15

judged 15
and 15
was 15
replenishing 15
her 15
supply 15
while 15
mrs 15
farrow 15
composed 15
herself 15
to 15
speak 15
mrs 15
farrow 15
was 15
a 15
splendidly 15
built 15
woman 15
with 15
pale 15
eyes 15
and 15
narrow 15
feet 15
she 15
had 15
a 15
fresh 15
permanent 15
wave 15
and 15
her 15
hair 15
was 15
a 15
mass 15
of 15
tight 15
gray 15
ringlets 15
she 15
was 15
the 15
second 15
most 15
devout 15
lady 15
in 15
maycomb 15
she 15
had 15
a 15
curious 15
habit 15
of 15
prefacing 15
everything 15
she 15
said 15
with 15
a 15
soft 15
sibilant 15
sound 15

merriweather 15
nodded 15
wisely 15
her 15
voice 15
soared 15
over 15
the 15
clink 15
of 15
coffee 15
cups 15
and 15
the 15
soft 15
bovine 15
sounds 15
of 15
the 15
ladies 15
munching 15
their 15
dainties 15

but 15
misguided 15
folks 15
in 15
this 15
town 15
who 15

theyre 15
doing 15
right 15

it 15
from 15

who 15
but 15
some 15
of 15
em 15
in 15
this 15
town 15
thought 15
they 15
were 15
doing 15
the 15
right 15
thing 15
a 15
while 15
back 15
but 15
all 15
they 15

was 15
stir 15
em 15
up 15
thats 15
all 15
they 15
did 15
mightve 15
looked 15
like 15
the 15
right 15
thing 15

of 15
hers 15
that 15
the 15
only 15
reason 15

maudie 15
said 15
it 15
two 15
tight 15
lines 15
had 15
appeared 15
at 15
the 15
corners 15
of 15
her 15
mouth 15
she 15
had 15
been 15
sitting 15
silently 15
beside 15
me 15
her 15
coffee 15
cup 15
balanced 15
on 15
one 15
knee 15
i 15
had 15
lost 15
the 15
thread 15
of 15
conversation 15
long 15
ago 15
when 15
they 15
quit 15
talking 15
about 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
wife 15
and 15
had 15
contented 15
myself 15
with 15
thinking 15
of 15
finchs 15
landing 15
and 15
the 15
river 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
had 15
got 15
it 15
backwards 15
the 15
business 15
part 15
of 15
the 15
meeting 15
was 15
bloodcurdling 15
the 15
social 15
hour 15
was 15
dreary 15
maudie 15
im 15
sure 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
what 15
you 15
mean 15

mrs 15
merriweather 15
im 15
sure 15
you 15
do 15
miss 15
maudie 15
said 15
shortly 15
she 15
said 15
no 15
more 15
when 15
miss 15
maudie 15
was 15
angry 15
her 15
brevity 15
was 15
icy 15
something 15
had 15
made 15
her 15
deeply 15
angry 15
and 15
her 15
gray 15
eyes 15
were 15
as 15
cold 15
as 15
her 15
voice 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
reddened 15
glanced 15
at 15
me 15
and 15
looked 15
away 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
see 15
mrs 15
farrow 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
got 15
up 15
from 15
the 15
table 15
and 15
swiftly 15
passed 15
more 15
refreshments 15
neatly 15
engaging 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
and 15
mrs 15
gates 15
in 15
brisk 15
conversation 15
when 15
she 15
had 15
them 15
well 15
on 15
the 15
road 15
with 15
mrs 15
perkins 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
stepped 15
back 15
she 15
gave 15
miss 15
maudie 15
a 15
look 15
of 15
pure 15
gratitude 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
at 15
the 15
world 15
of 15
women 15
miss 15
maudie 15
and 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
had 15
never 15
been 15
especially 15
close 15
and 15
here 15
was 15
aunty 15
silently 15
thanking 15
her 15
for 15
something 15
for 15
what 15
i 15
knew 15
not 15
i 15
was 15
content 15
to 15
learn 15
that 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
could 15
be 15
pierced 15
sufficiently 15
to 15
feel 15
gratitude 15
for 15
help 15
given 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
doubt 15
about 15
it 15
i 15
must 15
soon 15
enter 15
this 15
world 15
where 15
on 15
its 15
surface 15
fragrant 15
ladies 15
rocked 15
slowly 15
fanned 15
gently 15
and 15
drank 15
cool 15
water 15
but 15
i 15
was 15
more 15
at 15
home 15
in 15
my 15
fathers 15
world 15
people 15
like 15
mr 15
heck 15

not 15
trap 15
you 15
with 15
innocent 15
questions 15
to 15
make 15
fun 15
of 15
you 15
even 15
jem 15
was 15
not 15
highly 15
critical 15
unless 15
you 15
said 15
something 15
stupid 15
ladies 15
seemed 15
to 15
live 15
in 15
faint 15
horror 15
of 15
men 15
seemed 15
unwilling 15
to 15
approve 15
wholeheartedly 15
of 15
them 15
but 15
i 15
liked 15
them 15
there 15
was 15
something 15
about 15
them 15
no 15
matter 15
how 15
much 15
they 15
cussed 15
and 15
drank 15
and 15
gambled 15
and 15
chewed 15
no 15
matter 15
how 15
undelectable 15
they 15
were 15
there 15
was 15
something 15
about 15
them 15
that 15
i 15
instinctively 15
liked 15
they 15
werent 15
hypocrites 15

do 15
to 15
make 15

up 15
easier 15
for 15

that 15
the 15
last 15
thing 15
he 15
said 15
to 15
atticus 15
before 15

that 15
he 15
must 15

and 15
we 15
were 15
still 15
sleeping 15
on 15
the 15
back 15
screen 15
porch 15
lightning 15
bugs 15
were 15
still 15
about 15
the 15
night 15
crawlers 15
and 15
flying 15
insects 15
that 15
beat 15
against 15
the 15
screen 15
the 15
summer 15
long 15
had 15
not 15
gone 15
wherever 15
they 15
go 15
when 15
autumn 15
comes 15
a 15
rolypoly 15
had 15
found 15
his 15
way 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
i 15
reasoned 15
that 15
the 15
tiny 15
varmint 15
had 15
crawled 15
up 15
the 15
steps 15
and 15
under 15
the 15
door 15
i 15
was 15
putting 15
my 15
book 15
on 15
the 15
floor 15
beside 15
my 15
cot 15
when 15
i 15
saw 15
him 15
the 15
creatures 15
are 15
no 15
more 15
than 15
an 15
inch 15
long 15
and 15
when 15
you 15
touch 15
them 15
they 15
roll 15
themselves 15
into 15
a 15
tight 15
gray 15
ball 15
i 15
lay 15
on 15
my 15
stomach 15
reached 15
down 15
and 15
poked 15
him 15
he 15
rolled 15
up 15
then 15
feeling 15
safe 15
i 15
suppose 15
he 15
slowly 15
unrolled 15
he 15
traveled 15
a 15
few 15
inches 15
on 15
his 15
hundred 15
legs 15
and 15
i 15
touched 15
him 15
again 15
he 15
rolled 15
up 15
feeling 15
sleepy 15
i 15
decided 15
to 15
end 15
things 15
my 15
hand 15
was 15
going 15
down 15
on 15
him 15
when 15
jem 15
spoke 15
jem 15
was 15
scowling 15
it 15
was 15
probably 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
the 15
stage 15
he 15
was 15
going 15
through 15
and 15
i 15
wished 15
he 15
would 15
hurry 15
up 15
and 15
get 15
through 15
it 15
he 15
was 15
certainly 15
never 15
cruel 15
to 15
animals 15
but 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
known 15
his 15
charity 15
to 15
embrace 15
the 15
insect 15
world 15
why 15
couldnt 15
i 15
mash 15
him 15
i 15
asked 15
because 15
they 15
dont 15
bother 15
you 15
jem 15
answered 15
in 15
the 15
darkness 15
he 15
had 15
turned 15
out 15
his 15
reading 15
light 15
reckon 15
youre 15
at 15
the 15
stage 15
now 15
where 15
you 15
dont 15
kill 15
flies 15
and 15
mosquitoes 15
now 15
i 15
reckon 15
i 15
said 15
lemme 15
know 15
when 15
you 15
change 15
your 15
mind 15
tell 15
you 15
one 15
thing 15
though 15
i 15
aint 15
gonna 15
sit 15
around 15
and 15
not 15
scratch 15
a 15
redbug 15
aw 15
dry 15
up 15
he 15
answered 15
drowsily 15
jem 15
was 15
the 15
one 15
who 15
was 15
getting 15
more 15
like 15
a 15
girl 15
every 15
day 15
not 15
i 15
comfortable 15
i 15
lay 15
on 15
my 15
back 15
and 15
waited 15
for 15
sleep 15
and 15
while 15
waiting 15
i 15
thought 15
of 15
dill 15
he 15
had 15
left 15
us 15
the 15
first 15
of 15
the 15
month 15
with 15
firm 15
assurances 15
that 15
he 15
would 15
return 15
the 15
minute 15
school 15
was 15
out 15
he 15
guessed 15
his 15
folks 15
had 15
got 15
the 15
general 15
idea 15
that 15
he 15
liked 15
to 15
spend 15
his 15
summers 15
in 15
maycomb 15
miss 15
rachel 15
took 15
us 15
with 15
them 15
in 15
the 15
taxi 15
to 15
maycomb 15
junction 15
and 15
dill 15
waved 15
to 15
us 15
from 15
the 15
train 15
window 15
until 15
he 15
was 15
out 15
of 15
sight 15
he 15
was 15
not 15
out 15
of 15
mind 15
i 15
missed 15
him 15
the 15
last 15
two 15
days 15
of 15
his 15
time 15
with 15
us 15
jem 15
had 15
taught 15
him 15
to 15
swim 15
taught 15
him 15
to 15
swim 15
i 15
was 15
wide 15
awake 15
remembering 15
what 15
dill 15
had 15
told 15
me 15
barkers 15
eddy 15
is 15
at 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
a 15
dirt 15
road 15
off 15
the 15
meridian 15
highway 15
about 15
a 15
mile 15
from 15
town 15
it 15
is 15
easy 15
to 15
catch 15
a 15
ride 15
down 15
the 15
highway 15
on 15
a 15
cotton 15
wagon 15
or 15
from 15
a 15
passing 15
motorist 15
and 15
the 15
short 15
walk 15
to 15
the 15
creek 15
is 15
easy 15
but 15
the 15
prospect 15
of 15
walking 15
all 15
the 15
way 15
back 15
home 15
at 15
dusk 15
when 15
the 15
traffic 15
is 15
light 15
is 15
tiresome 15
and 15
swimmers 15
are 15
careful 15
not 15
to 15
stay 15
too 15
late 15
according 15
to 15
dill 15
he 15
and 15
jem 15
had 15
just 15
come 15
to 15
the 15
highway 15
when 15
they 15
saw 15
atticus 15
driving 15
toward 15
them 15
he 15
looked 15
like 15
he 15
had 15
not 15
seen 15
them 15
so 15
they 15
both 15
waved 15
atticus 15
finally 15
slowed 15
down 15
when 15
they 15
caught 15
up 15
with 15
him 15
he 15
said 15

and 15
atticus 15

turned 15
off 15
the 15
highway 15

slowly 15
by 15
the 15

and 15

down 15
the 15
narrow 15

little 15
girl 15
came 15
to 15
the 15

looking 15
at 15

stiff 15
pigtails 15
each 15
ending 15
in 15
a 15
bright 15
bow 15
she 15
grinned 15
from 15
ear 15
to 15
ear 15
and 15
walked 15
toward 15
our 15
father 15
but 15
she 15
was 15
too 15
small 15
to 15
navigate 15
the 15
steps 15

said 15
atticus 15
went 15

grabbed 15
it 15
and 15
he 15
eased 15
her 15
down 15

the 15
dirt 15
just 15
fell 15
down 15
in 15
the 15
dirt 15
like 15
a 15
giant 15
with 15

long 15
time 15
and 15
atticus 15
came 15
out 15
alone 15
when 15
they 15
drove 15
back 15
by 15

death 15
for 15
perhaps 15
two 15
days 15
two 15

typical 15
typical 15
of 15
a 15
nigger 15
to 15
cut 15
and 15
run 15
typical 15
of 15
a 15
niggers 15
mentality 15
to 15
have 15
no 15
plan 15
no 15

and 15
all 15
that 15
but 15
when 15
it 15
comes 15
down 15
to 15
the 15
line 15
the 15
veneers 15
mighty 15
thin 15
nigger 15
always 15
comes 15
out 15
in 15
em 15
a 15
few 15
more 15
details 15
enabling 15
the 15
listener 15
to 15
repeat 15
his 15
version 15
in 15
turn 15
then 15
nothing 15
to 15
talk 15
about 15
until 15
the 15
maycomb 15
tribune 15
appeared 15
the 15
following 15
thursday 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
brief 15
obituary 15
in 15
the 15
colored 15
news 15
but 15
there 15
was 15
also 15
an 15
editorial 15
mr 15
b 15
b 15
underwood 15
was 15
at 15
his 15
most 15
bitter 15
and 15
he 15
couldnt 15
have 15
cared 15
less 15
who 15
canceled 15
advertising 15
and 15
subscriptions 15
but 15
maycomb 15
didnt 15
play 15
that 15
way 15
mr 15
underwood 15
could 15
holler 15
till 15
he 15
sweated 15
and 15
write 15
whatever 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
hed 15
still 15
get 15
his 15
advertising 15
and 15
subscriptions 15
if 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
make 15
a 15
fool 15
of 15
himself 15
in 15
his 15
paper 15
that 15
was 15
his 15
business 15
mr 15
underwood 15
didnt 15
talk 15
about 15
miscarriages 15
of 15
justice 15
he 15
was 15
writing 15
so 15
children 15
could 15
understand 15
mr 15
underwood 15
simply 15
figured 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
sin 15
to 15
kill 15
cripples 15
be 15
they 15
standing 15
sitting 15
or 15
escaping 15
he 15
likened 15
toms 15
death 15
to 15
the 15
senseless 15
slaughter 15
of 15
songbirds 15
by 15
hunters 15
and 15
children 15
and 15
maycomb 15
thought 15
he 15
was 15
trying 15
to 15
write 15
an 15
editorial 15
poetical 15
enough 15
to 15
be 15
reprinted 15
in 15
the 15
montgomery 15
advertiser 15
how 15
could 15
this 15
be 15
so 15
i 15
wondered 15
as 15
i 15
read 15
mr 15
underwoods 15
editorial 15
senseless 15
killing 15
tom 15
had 15
been 15
given 15
due 15
process 15
of 15
law 15
to 15
the 15
day 15
of 15
his 15
death 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
tried 15
openly 15
and 15
convicted 15
by 15
twelve 15
good 15
men 15
and 15
true 15
my 15
father 15
had 15
fought 15
for 15
him 15
all 15
the 15
way 15
then 15
mr 15
underwoods 15
meaning 15
became 15
clear 15
atticus 15
had 15
used 15
every 15
tool 15
available 15
to 15
free 15
men 15
to 15
save 15
tom 15
robinson 15
but 15
in 15
the 15
secret 15
courts 15
of 15
mens 15
hearts 15
atticus 15
had 15
no 15
case 15
tom 15
was 15
a 15
dead 15
man 15
the 15
minute 15
mayella 15
ewell 15
opened 15
her 15
mouth 15
and 15
screamed 15
the 15
name 15
ewell 15
gave 15
me 15
a 15
queasy 15
feeling 15
maycomb 15
had 15
lost 15
no 15
time 15
in 15
getting 15
mr 15
ewells 15
views 15
on 15
toms 15
demise 15
and 15
passing 15
them 15
along 15
through 15
that 15
english 15
channel 15
of 15
gossip 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
told 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
in 15
jems 15
presence 15
oh 15
foot 15
hes 15
old 15
enough 15
to 15
listen 15
that 15
mr 15
ewell 15
said 15
it 15
made 15
one 15
down 15
and 15
about 15
two 15
more 15
to 15
go 15
jem 15
told 15
me 15
not 15
to 15
be 15
afraid 15
mr 15
ewell 15
was 15
more 15
hot 15
gas 15
than 15
anything 15
jem 15
also 15
told 15
me 15
that 15
if 15
i 15
breathed 15
a 15
word 15
to 15
atticus 15
if 15
in 15
any 15
way 15
i 15
let 15
atticus 15
know 15
i 15
knew 15
jem 15
would 15
personally 15
never 15
speak 15
to 15
me 15
again 15
school 15
started 15
and 15
so 15
did 15
our 15
daily 15
trips 15
past 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
jem 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
seventh 15
grade 15
and 15
went 15
to 15
high 15
school 15
beyond 15
the 15
grammarschool 15
building 15
i 15
was 15
now 15
in 15
the 15
third 15
grade 15
and 15
our 15
routines 15
were 15
so 15
different 15
i 15
only 15
walked 15
to 15
school 15
with 15
jem 15
in 15
the 15
mornings 15
and 15
saw 15
him 15
at 15
mealtimes 15
he 15
went 15
out 15
for 15
football 15
but 15
was 15
too 15
slender 15
and 15
too 15
young 15
yet 15
to 15
do 15
anything 15
but 15
carry 15
the 15
team 15
water 15
buckets 15
this 15
he 15
did 15
with 15
enthusiasm 15
most 15
afternoons 15
he 15
was 15
seldom 15
home 15
before 15
dark 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
had 15
ceased 15
to 15
terrify 15
me 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
no 15
less 15
gloomy 15
no 15
less 15
chilly 15
under 15
its 15
great 15
oaks 15
and 15
no 15
less 15
uninviting 15
mr 15
nathan 15
radley 15
could 15
still 15
be 15
seen 15
on 15
a 15
clear 15
day 15
walking 15
to 15
and 15
from 15
town 15
we 15
knew 15
boo 15
was 15
there 15
for 15
the 15
same 15
old 15
reason 15
nobodyd 15
seen 15
him 15
carried 15
out 15
yet 15
i 15
sometimes 15
felt 15
a 15
twinge 15
of 15
remorse 15
when 15
passing 15
by 15
the 15
old 15
place 15
at 15
ever 15
having 15
taken 15
part 15
in 15
what 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
sheer 15
torment 15
to 15
arthur 15
radley 15
what 15
reasonable 15
recluse 15
wants 15
children 15
peeping 15
through 15
his 15
shutters 15
delivering 15
greetings 15
on 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
a 15
fishingpole 15
wandering 15
in 15
his 15
collards 15
at 15
night 15
and 15
yet 15
i 15
remembered 15
two 15
indianhead 15
pennies 15
chewing 15
gum 15
soap 15
dolls 15
a 15
rusty 15
medal 15
a 15
broken 15
watch 15
and 15
chain 15
jem 15
must 15
have 15
put 15
them 15
away 15
somewhere 15
i 15
stopped 15
and 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
tree 15
one 15
afternoon 15
the 15
trunk 15
was 15
swelling 15
around 15
its 15
cement 15
patch 15
the 15
patch 15
itself 15
was 15
turning 15
yellow 15
we 15
had 15
almost 15
seen 15
him 15
a 15
couple 15
of 15
times 15
a 15
good 15
enough 15
score 15
for 15
anybody 15
but 15
i 15
still 15
looked 15
for 15
him 15
each 15
time 15
i 15
went 15
by 15
maybe 15
someday 15
we 15
would 15
see 15
him 15
i 15
imagined 15
how 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
when 15
it 15
happened 15
hed 15
just 15
be 15
sitting 15
in 15
the 15
swing 15
when 15
i 15
came 15
along 15
hidy 15
do 15
mr 15
arthur 15
i 15
would 15
say 15
as 15
if 15
i 15
had 15
said 15
it 15
every 15
afternoon 15
of 15
my 15
life 15
evening 15
jean 15
louise 15
he 15
would 15
say 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
had 15
said 15
it 15
every 15
afternoon 15
of 15
my 15
life 15
right 15
pretty 15
spell 15
were 15
having 15
isnt 15
it 15
yes 15
sir 15
right 15
pretty 15
i 15
would 15
say 15
and 15
go 15
on 15
it 15
was 15
only 15
a 15
fantasy 15
we 15
would 15
never 15
see 15
him 15
he 15
probably 15
did 15
go 15
out 15
when 15
the 15
moon 15
was 15
down 15
and 15
gaze 15
upon 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
id 15
have 15
picked 15
somebody 15
else 15
to 15
look 15
at 15
but 15
that 15
was 15
his 15
business 15
he 15
would 15
never 15
gaze 15
at 15
us 15
you 15
arent 15
starting 15
that 15
again 15
are 15
you 15
said 15
atticus 15
one 15
night 15
when 15
i 15
expressed 15
a 15
stray 15
desire 15
just 15
to 15
have 15
one 15
good 15
look 15
at 15
boo 15
radley 15
before 15
i 15
died 15
if 15
you 15
are 15
ill 15
tell 15
you 15
right 15
now 15
stop 15
it 15
im 15
too 15
old 15
to 15
go 15
chasing 15
you 15
off 15
the 15
radley 15
property 15
besides 15
its 15
dangerous 15
you 15
might 15
get 15
shot 15
you 15
know 15
mr 15
nathan 15
shoots 15
at 15
every 15
shadow 15
he 15
sees 15
even 15
shadows 15
that 15
leave 15
sizefour 15
bare 15
footprints 15
you 15
were 15
lucky 15
not 15
to 15
be 15
killed 15
i 15
hushed 15
then 15
and 15
there 15
at 15
the 15
same 15
time 15
i 15
marveled 15
at 15
atticus 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
first 15
he 15
had 15
let 15
us 15
know 15
he 15
knew 15
a 15
lot 15
more 15
about 15
something 15
than 15
we 15
thought 15
he 15
knew 15
and 15
it 15
had 15
happened 15
years 15
ago 15
no 15
only 15
last 15
summer 15
no 15
summer 15
before 15
last 15
when 15
time 15
was 15
playing 15
tricks 15
on 15
me 15
i 15
must 15
remember 15
to 15
ask 15
jem 15
so 15
many 15
things 15
had 15
happened 15
to 15
us 15
boo 15
radley 15
was 15
the 15
least 15
of 15
our 15
fears 15
atticus 15
said 15
he 15
didnt 15
see 15
how 15
anything 15
else 15
could 15
happen 15
that 15
things 15
had 15
a 15
way 15
of 15
settling 15
down 15
and 15
after 15
enough 15
time 15
passed 15
people 15
would 15
forget 15
that 15
tom 15
robinsons 15
existence 15
was 15
ever 15
brought 15
to 15
their 15
attention 15
perhaps 15
atticus 15
was 15
right 15
but 15
the 15
events 15
of 15
the 15
summer 15
hung 15
over 15
us 15
like 15
smoke 15
in 15
a 15
closed 15
room 15
the 15
adults 15
in 15
maycomb 15
never 15
discussed 15
the 15
case 15
with 15
jem 15
and 15
me 15
it 15
seemed 15
that 15
they 15
discussed 15
it 15
with 15
their 15
children 15
and 15
their 15
attitude 15
must 15
have 15
been 15
that 15
neither 15
of 15
us 15
could 15
help 15
having 15
atticus 15
for 15
a 15
parent 15
so 15
their 15
children 15
must 15
be 15
nice 15
to 15
us 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
him 15
the 15
children 15
would 15
never 15
have 15
thought 15
that 15
up 15
for 15
themselves 15
had 15
our 15
classmates 15
been 15
left 15
to 15
their 15
own 15
devices 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
would 15
have 15
had 15
several 15
swift 15
satisfying 15
fistfights 15
apiece 15
and 15
ended 15
the 15
matter 15
for 15
good 15
as 15
it 15
was 15
we 15
were 15
compelled 15
to 15
hold 15
our 15
heads 15
high 15
and 15
be 15
respectively 15
a 15
gentleman 15
and 15
a 15
lady 15
in 15
a 15
way 15
it 15
was 15
like 15
the 15
era 15
of 15
mrs 15
henry 15
lafayette 15
dubose 15
without 15
all 15
her 15
yelling 15
there 15
was 15
one 15
odd 15
thing 15
though 15
that 15
i 15
never 15
understood 15
in 15
spite 15
of 15
atticuss 15
shortcomings 15
as 15
a 15
parent 15
people 15
were 15
content 15
to 15
reelect 15
him 15
to 15
the 15
state 15
legislature 15
that 15
year 15
as 15
usual 15
without 15
opposition 15
i 15
came 15
to 15
the 15
conclusion 15
that 15
people 15
were 15
just 15
peculiar 15
i 15
withdrew 15
from 15
them 15
and 15
never 15
thought 15
about 15
them 15
until 15
i 15
was 15
forced 15
to 15
i 15
was 15
forced 15
to 15
one 15
day 15
in 15
school 15
once 15
a 15
week 15
we 15
had 15
a 15
current 15
events 15
period 15
each 15
child 15
was 15
supposed 15
to 15
clip 15
an 15
item 15
from 15
a 15
newspaper 15
absorb 15
its 15
contents 15
and 15
reveal 15
them 15
to 15
the 15
class 15
this 15
practice 15
allegedly 15
overcame 15
a 15
variety 15
of 15
evils 15
standing 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
his 15
fellows 15
encouraged 15
good 15
posture 15
and 15
gave 15
a 15
child 15
poise 15
delivering 15
a 15
short 15
talk 15
made 15
him 15
wordconscious 15
learning 15
his 15
current 15
event 15
strengthened 15
his 15
memory 15
being 15
singled 15
out 15
made 15
him 15
more 15
than 15
ever 15
anxious 15
to 15
return 15
to 15
the 15
group 15
the 15
idea 15
was 15
profound 15
but 15
as 15
usual 15
in 15
maycomb 15
it 15
didnt 15
work 15
very 15
well 15
in 15
the 15
first 15
place 15
few 15
rural 15
children 15
had 15
access 15
to 15
newspapers 15
so 15
the 15
burden 15
of 15
current 15
events 15
was 15
borne 15
by 15
the 15
town 15
children 15
convincing 15
the 15
bus 15
children 15
more 15
deeply 15
that 15
the 15
town 15
children 15
got 15
all 15
the 15
attention 15
anyway 15
the 15
rural 15
children 15
who 15
could 15
usually 15
brought 15
clippings 15
from 15
what 15
they 15
called 15
the 15
grit 15
paper 15
a 15
publication 15
spurious 15
in 15
the 15
eyes 15
of 15
miss 15
gates 15
our 15
teacher 15
why 15
she 15
frowned 15
when 15
a 15
child 15
recited 15
from 15
the 15
grit 15
paper 15
i 15
never 15
knew 15
but 15
in 15
some 15
way 15
it 15
was 15
associated 15
with 15
liking 15
fiddling 15
eating 15
syrupy 15
biscuits 15
for 15
lunch 15
being 15
a 15
holyroller 15
singing 15
sweetly 15
sings 15
the 15
donkey 15
and 15
pronouncing 15
it 15
dunkey 15
all 15
of 15
which 15
the 15
state 15
paid 15
teachers 15
to 15
discourage 15
even 15
so 15
not 15
many 15
of 15
the 15
children 15
knew 15
what 15
a 15
current 15
event 15
was 15
little 15
chuck 15
little 15
a 15
hundred 15
years 15
old 15
in 15
his 15
knowledge 15
of 15
cows 15
and 15
their 15
habits 15
was 15
halfway 15
through 15
an 15
uncle 15
natchell 15
story 15
when 15
miss 15
gates 15
stopped 15
him 15
charles 15
that 15
is 15
not 15
a 15
current 15
event 15
that 15
is 15
an 15
advertisement 15
cecil 15
jacobs 15
knew 15
what 15
one 15
was 15
though 15
when 15
his 15
turn 15
came 15
he 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
and 15
began 15
old 15
hitler 15
adolf 15
hitler 15
cecil 15
said 15

been 15
after 15
the 15
jews 15
and 15
hes 15
puttin 15

hitlers 15

i 15

a 15
bad 15
thing 15

cecil 15

miss 15
gates 15
puffing 15
cecil 15
returned 15
to 15
his 15
seat 15
a 15
hand 15
went 15
up 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
how 15
can 15

patiently 15
i 15

how 15
can 15
hitler 15
just 15
put 15
a 15
lot 15
of 15
folks 15
in 15
a 15
pen 15

miss 15
gates 15
and 15
seizing 15
an 15
opportunity 15
to 15
make 15
education 15
dynamic 15
she 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
blackboard 15
she 15
printed 15
democracy 15
in 15
large 15
letters 15
democracy 15
she 15
said 15
does 15
anybody 15
have 15
a 15
definition 15
us 15
somebody 15
said 15
i 15
raised 15
my 15
hand 15
remembering 15
an 15
old 15
campaign 15
slogan 15
atticus 15
had 15
once 15
told 15
me 15
about 15
what 15
do 15
you 15
think 15
it 15

jean 15
louise 15
equal 15
rights 15
for 15
all 15
special 15
privileges 15

none 15
i 15
quoted 15
very 15
good 15
jean 15
louise 15
very 15
good 15
miss 15
gates 15
smiled 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
democracy 15
she 15
printed 15
we 15
are 15
a 15
now 15
class 15
say 15
it 15
all 15
together 15
we 15
are 15
a 15
democracy 15
we 15
said 15
it 15
then 15
miss 15
gates 15
said 15
thats 15
the 15
difference 15
between 15
america 15
and 15
germany 15
we 15
are 15
a 15
democracy 15
and 15
germany 15
is 15
a 15
dictatorship 15
dictatorship 15
she 15
said 15
over 15
here 15
we 15
dont 15
believe 15
in 15
persecuting 15
anybody 15
persecution 15
comes 15
from 15
people 15
who 15
are 15
prejudiced 15
prejudice 15
she 15
enunciated 15
carefully 15
there 15
are 15
no 15
better 15
people 15
in 15
the 15
world 15
than 15
the 15
jews 15
and 15
why 15
hitler 15
doesnt 15
think 15
so 15
is 15
a 15
mystery 15
to 15
me 15
an 15
inquiring 15
soul 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
said 15
why 15
dont 15
they 15
like 15
the 15
jews 15
you 15
reckon 15
miss 15
gates 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
henry 15
they 15
contribute 15
to 15
every 15
society 15
they 15
live 15
in 15
and 15
most 15
of 15
all 15
they 15
are 15
a 15
deeply 15
religious 15
people 15
hitlers 15
trying 15
to 15
do 15
away 15
with 15
religion 15
so 15
maybe 15
he 15
doesnt 15
like 15
them 15
for 15
that 15
reason 15
cecil 15
spoke 15
up 15
well 15
i 15
dont 15
know 15
for 15
certain 15
he 15
said 15
theyre 15
supposed 15
to 15
change 15
money 15
or 15
somethin 15
but 15
that 15
aint 15
no 15
cause 15
to 15
persecute 15
em 15
theyre 15
white 15
aint 15
they 15
miss 15
gates 15
said 15
when 15
you 15
get 15
to 15
high 15
school 15
cecil 15
youll 15
learn 15
that 15
the 15
jews 15
have 15
been 15
persecuted 15
since 15
the 15
beginning 15
of 15
history 15
even 15
driven 15
out 15
of 15
their 15
own 15
country 15
its 15
one 15
of 15
the 15
most 15
terrible 15
stories 15
in 15
history 15
time 15
for 15
arithmetic 15
children 15
as 15
i 15
had 15
never 15
liked 15
arithmetic 15
i 15
spent 15
the 15
period 15
looking 15
out 15
the 15
window 15
the 15
only 15
time 15
i 15
ever 15
saw 15
atticus 15
scowl 15
was 15
when 15
elmer 15
davis 15
would 15
give 15
us 15
the 15
latest 15
on 15
hitler 15
atticus 15
would 15
snap 15
off 15
the 15
radio 15
and 15
say 15
hmp 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
once 15
why 15
he 15
was 15
impatient 15
with 15
hitler 15
and 15
atticus 15
said 15
because 15
hes 15
a 15
maniac 15
this 15
would 15
not 15
do 15
i 15
mused 15
as 15
the 15
class 15
proceeded 15
with 15
its 15
sums 15
one 15
maniac 15
and 15
millions 15
of 15
german 15
folks 15
looked 15
to 15
me 15
like 15
theyd 15
shut 15
hitler 15
in 15
a 15
pen 15
instead 15
of 15
letting 15
him 15
shut 15
them 15
up 15
there 15
was 15
something 15
else 15
wrong 15
i 15
would 15
ask 15
my 15
father 15
about 15
it 15
i 15
did 15
and 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
could 15
not 15
possibly 15
answer 15
my 15
question 15
because 15
he 15
didnt 15
know 15
the 15
answer 15
but 15
its 15
okay 15
to 15
hate 15
hitler 15
it 15
is 15
not 15
he 15
said 15
its 15
not 15
okay 15
to 15

surprised 15
to 15
cry 15
i 15
crept 15
from 15
jems 15
room 15
and 15
shut 15
the 15
door 15
softly 15
lest 15
undue 15
noise 15
set 15
him 15
off 15
again 15
suddenly 15
tired 15
i 15
wanted 15
atticus 15
he 15
was 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
and 15
i 15
went 15
to 15
him 15
and 15
tried 15
to 15
get 15
in 15
his 15
lap 15
atticus 15
smiled 15
youre 15
getting 15
so 15
big 15
now 15
ill 15
just 15
have 15
to 15
hold 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
you 15
he 15
held 15
me 15
close 15
scout 15
he 15
said 15
softly 15
dont 15
let 15
jem 15
get 15
you 15
down 15
hes 15
having 15
a 15
rough 15
time 15
these 15
days 15
i 15
heard 15
you 15
back 15
there 15
atticus 15
said 15
that 15
jem 15
was 15
trying 15
hard 15
to 15
forget 15
something 15
but 15
what 15
he 15
was 15
really 15
doing 15
was 15
storing 15
it 15
away 15
for 15
a 15
while 15
until 15
enough 15
time 15
passed 15
then 15
he 15
would 15
be 15
able 15
to 15
think 15
about 15
it 15
and 15
sort 15
things 15
out 15
when 15
he 15
was 15
able 15
to 15
think 15
about 15
it 15
jem 15
would 15
be 15
himself 15
again 15
things 15
did 15
settle 15
down 15
after 15
a 15
fashion 15
as 15
atticus 15
said 15
they 15
would 15
by 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
october 15
only 15
two 15
small 15
things 15
out 15
of 15
the 15
ordinary 15
happened 15
to 15
two 15
maycomb 15
citizens 15
no 15
there 15
were 15
three 15
things 15
and 15
they 15
did 15
not 15
directly 15
concern 15
us 15
the 15
finches 15
but 15
in 15
a 15
way 15
they 15
did 15
the 15
first 15
thing 15
was 15
that 15
mr 15
bob 15
ewell 15
acquired 15
and 15
lost 15
a 15
job 15
in 15
a 15
matter 15
of 15
days 15
and 15
probably 15
made 15
himself 15
unique 15
in 15
the 15
annals 15
of 15
the 15
nineteenthirties 15
he 15
was 15
the 15
only 15
man 15
i 15
ever 15
heard 15
of 15
who 15
was 15
fired 15
from 15
the 15
wpa 15
for 15
laziness 15
i 15
suppose 15
his 15
brief 15
burst 15
of 15
fame 15
brought 15
on 15
a 15
briefer 15
burst 15
of 15
industry 15
but 15
his 15
job 15
lasted 15
only 15
as 15
long 15
as 15
his 15
notoriety 15
mr 15
ewell 15
found 15
himself 15
as 15
forgotten 15
as 15
tom 15
robinson 15
thereafter 15
he 15
resumed 15
his 15
regular 15
weekly 15
appearances 15
at 15
the 15
welfare 15
office 15
for 15
his 15
check 15
and 15
received 15
it 15
with 15
no 15
grace 15
amid 15
obscure 15
mutterings 15
that 15
the 15
bastards 15
who 15
thought 15
they 15
ran 15
this 15
town 15
wouldnt 15
permit 15
an 15
honest 15
man 15
to 15
make 15
a 15
living 15
ruth 15
jones 15
the 15
welfare 15
lady 15
said 15
mr 15
ewell 15
openly 15
accused 15
atticus 15
of 15
getting 15
his 15
job 15
she 15
was 15
upset 15
enough 15
to 15
walk 15
down 15
to 15
atticuss 15
office 15
and 15
tell 15
him 15
about 15
it 15
atticus 15
told 15
miss 15
ruth 15
not 15
to 15
fret 15
that 15
if 15
bob 15
ewell 15
wanted 15
to 15
discuss 15
atticuss 15
getting 15
his 15
job 15
he 15
knew 15
the 15
way 15
to 15
the 15
office 15
the 15
second 15
thing 15
happened 15
to 15
judge 15
taylor 15

his 15
sunday 15
night 15
hour 15
alone 15
in 15
his 15
big 15
house 15
and 15
churchtime 15
found 15
him 15
holed 15
up 15
in 15
his 15
study 15
reading 15
the 15
writings 15
of 15
bob 15
taylor 15
no 15
kin 15
but 15
the 15
judge 15
would 15
have 15
been 15
proud 15
to 15
claim 15
it 15
one 15
sunday 15
night 15
lost 15
in 15
fruity 15
metaphors 15
and 15
florid 15
diction 15
judge 15
taylors 15
attention 15
was 15
wrenched 15
from 15
the 15
page 15
by 15
an 15
irritating 15
scratching 15
noise 15
hush 15
he 15
said 15
to 15
ann 15
taylor 15
his 15
fat 15
nondescript 15
dog 15
then 15
he 15
realized 15
he 15
was 15
speaking 15
to 15
an 15
empty 15
room 15
the 15
scratching 15
noise 15
was 15
coming 15
from 15
the 15
rear 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
judge 15
taylor 15
clumped 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
porch 15
to 15
let 15
ann 15
out 15
and 15
found 15
the 15
screen 15
door 15
swinging 15
open 15
a 15
shadow 15
on 15
the 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
caught 15
his 15
eye 15
and 15
that 15
was 15
all 15
he 15
saw 15
of 15
his 15
visitor 15
mrs 15
taylor 15
came 15
home 15
from 15
church 15
to 15
find 15
her 15
husband 15
in 15
his 15
chair 15
lost 15
in 15
the 15
writings 15
of 15
bob 15
taylor 15
with 15
a 15
shotgun 15
across 15
his 15
lap 15
the 15
third 15
thing 15
happened 15
to 15
helen 15
robinson 15
toms 15
widow 15
if 15
mr 15
ewell 15
was 15
as 15
forgotten 15
as 15
tom 15
robinson 15
tom 15
robinson 15
was 15
as 15
forgotten 15
as 15
boo 15
radley 15
but 15
tom 15
was 15
not 15
forgotten 15
by 15
his 15
employer 15
mr 15
link 15
deas 15
mr 15
link 15
deas 15
made 15
a 15
job 15
for 15
helen 15
he 15
didnt 15
really 15
need 15
her 15
but 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
felt 15
right 15
bad 15
about 15
the 15
way 15
things 15
turned 15
out 15
i 15
never 15
knew 15
who 15
took 15
care 15
of 15
her 15
children 15
while 15
helen 15
was 15
away 15
calpurnia 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
hard 15
on 15
helen 15
because 15
she 15
had 15
to 15
walk 15
nearly 15
a 15
mile 15
out 15
of 15
her 15
way 15
to 15
avoid 15
the 15
ewells 15

according 15
to 15
helen 15
chunked 15
at 15

the 15
public 15
road 15
mr 15
link 15
deas 15
eventually 15
received 15
the 15
impression 15
that 15
helen 15
was 15
coming 15
to 15
work 15
each 15
morning 15
from 15
the 15
wrong 15
direction 15
and 15

firmly 15
on 15
his 15
head 15
and 15
walked 15
helen 15
home 15

i 15
dont 15
like 15
it 15
at 15
all 15
was 15
aunt 15
alexandras 15
assessment 15
of 15
these 15
events 15
that 15
man 15
seems 15
to 15
have 15
a 15
permanent 15
running 15
grudge 15
against 15
everybody 15
connected 15
with 15
that 15
case 15
i 15
know 15
how 15
that 15
kind 15
are 15
about 15
paying 15
off 15
grudges 15
but 15
i 15
dont 15
understand 15
why 15
he 15
should 15
harbor 15
one 15
he 15
had 15
his 15
way 15
in 15
court 15
didnt 15
he 15
i 15
think 15
i 15
understand 15
said 15
atticus 15
it 15
might 15
be 15
because 15
he 15
knows 15
in 15
his 15
heart 15
that 15
very 15
few 15
people 15
in 15
maycomb 15
really 15
believed 15
his 15
and 15
mayellas 15
yarns 15
he 15
thought 15
hed 15
be 15
a 15

chuckled 15
by 15
the 15
end 15
of 15
october 15
our 15
lives 15
had 15
become 15
the 15
familiar 15
routine 15
of 15
school 15
play 15
study 15
jem 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
put 15
out 15
of 15
his 15
mind 15
whatever 15
it 15
was 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
forget 15
and 15
our 15
classmates 15
mercifully 15
let 15
us 15
forget 15
our 15
fathers 15
eccentricities 15
cecil 15
jacobs 15
asked 15
me 15
one 15
time 15
if 15
atticus 15
was 15
a 15
radical 15
when 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
atticus 15
was 15
so 15
amused 15
i 15
was 15
rather 15
annoyed 15
but 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
wasnt 15
laughing 15
at 15
me 15
he 15
said 15
you 15
tell 15
cecil 15

about 15
as 15
radical 15
as 15
cotton 15

aunt 15
alexandra 15

thriving 15
miss 15
maudie 15

have 15
silenced 15
the 15
whole 15
missionary 15
society 15
at 15
one 15
blow 15
for 15
aunty 15

that 15
roost 15
her 15
refreshments 15
grew 15
even 15
more 15
delicious 15
i 15
learned 15
more 15
about 15
the 15
poor 15
mrunas 15
social 15
life 15
from 15
listening 15
to 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
they 15
had 15
so 15
little 15
sense 15
of 15
family 15
that 15
the 15
whole 15
tribe 15
was 15
one 15
big 15
family 15
a 15
child 15
had 15
as 15
many 15
fathers 15
as 15
there 15
were 15
men 15
in 15
the 15
community 15
as 15
many 15
mothers 15
as 15
there 15
were 15
women 15
j 15
grimes 15
everett 15
was 15
doing 15
his 15
utmost 15
to 15
change 15
this 15
state 15
of 15
affairs 15
and 15
desperately 15
needed 15
our 15
prayers 15
maycomb 15
was 15
itself 15
again 15
precisely 15
the 15
same 15
as 15
last 15
year 15
and 15
the 15
year 15
before 15
that 15
with 15
only 15
two 15
minor 15
changes 15
firstly 15
people 15
had 15
removed 15
from 15
their 15
store 15
windows 15
and 15
automobiles 15
the 15
stickers 15
that 15
said 15
nra 15
we 15
do 15
our 15
part 15
i 15
asked 15
atticus 15
why 15
and 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
because 15
the 15
national 15
recovery 15
act 15
was 15
dead 15
i 15
asked 15
who 15
killed 15
it 15
he 15
said 15
nine 15
old 15
men 15
the 15
second 15
change 15
in 15
maycomb 15
since 15
last 15
year 15
was 15
not 15
one 15
of 15
national 15
significance 15
until 15
then 15
halloween 15
in 15
maycomb 15
was 15
a 15
completely 15
unorganized 15
affair 15
each 15
child 15
did 15
what 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
do 15
with 15
assistance 15
from 15
other 15
children 15
if 15
there 15
was 15
anything 15
to 15
be 15
moved 15
such 15
as 15
placing 15
a 15
light 15
buggy 15
on 15
top 15
of 15
the 15
livery 15
stable 15
but 15
parents 15
thought 15
things 15
went 15
too 15
far 15
last 15
year 15
when 15
the 15
peace 15
of 15
miss 15
tutti 15
and 15
miss 15
frutti 15
was 15
shattered 15
misses 15
tutti 15
and 15
frutti 15
barber 15
were 15
maiden 15
ladies 15
sisters 15
who 15
lived 15
together 15
in 15
the 15
only 15
maycomb 15
residence 15
boasting 15
a 15
cellar 15
the 15
barber 15
ladies 15
were 15
rumored 15
to 15
be 15
republicans 15
having 15
migrated 15
from 15
clanton 15
alabama 15
in 15
their 15
ways 15
were 15
strange 15
to 15
us 15
and 15
why 15
they 15
wanted 15
a 15
cellar 15
nobody 15
knew 15
but 15
they 15
wanted 15
one 15
and 15
they 15
dug 15
one 15
and 15
they 15
spent 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
their 15
lives 15
chasing 15
generations 15
of 15
children 15
out 15
of 15
it 15
misses 15
tutti 15
and 15
frutti 15
their 15
names 15
were 15
sarah 15
and 15
frances 15
aside 15
from 15
their 15
yankee 15
ways 15
were 15
both 15
deaf 15
miss 15
tutti 15
denied 15
it 15
and 15
lived 15
in 15
a 15
world 15
of 15
silence 15
but 15
miss 15
frutti 15
not 15
about 15
to 15
miss 15
anything 15
employed 15
an 15
ear 15
trumpet 15
so 15
enormous 15
that 15
jem 15
declared 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
loudspeaker 15
from 15
one 15
of 15
those 15
dog 15
victrolas 15
with 15
these 15
facts 15
in 15
mind 15
and 15
halloween 15
at 15
hand 15
some 15
wicked 15
children 15
had 15
waited 15
until 15
the 15
misses 15
barber 15
were 15
thoroughly 15
asleep 15
slipped 15
into 15
their 15
livingroom 15
nobody 15
but 15
the 15
radleys 15
locked 15
up 15
at 15
night 15
stealthily 15
made 15
away 15
with 15
every 15
stick 15
of 15
furniture 15
therein 15
and 15
hid 15
it 15
in 15
the 15
cellar 15
i 15
deny 15
having 15
taken 15
part 15
in 15
such 15
a 15
thing 15
i 15
heard 15
em 15
was 15
the 15
cry 15
that 15
awoke 15
the 15
misses 15
barbers 15
neighbors 15
at 15
dawn 15
next 15
morning 15
heard 15
em 15
drive 15
a 15
truck 15
up 15
to 15
the 15
door 15
stomped 15
around 15
like 15
horses 15
theyre 15
in 15
new 15
orleans 15
by 15
now 15
miss 15
tutti 15
was 15
sure 15
those 15
traveling 15
fur 15
sellers 15
who 15
came 15
through 15
town 15
two 15
days 15
ago 15
had 15
purloined 15
their 15
furniture 15
dark 15
they 15
were 15
she 15
said 15
syrians 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
was 15
summoned 15
he 15
surveyed 15
the 15
area 15
and 15
said 15
he 15
thought 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
local 15
job 15
miss 15
frutti 15
said 15
shed 15
know 15
a 15
maycomb 15
voice 15
anywhere 15
and 15
there 15
were 15
no 15
maycomb 15
voices 15
in 15
that 15
parlor 15
last 15
night 15
rolling 15
their 15
rs 15
all 15
over 15
her 15
premises 15
they 15
were 15
nothing 15
less 15
than 15
the 15
bloodhounds 15
must 15
be 15
used 15
to 15
locate 15
their 15
furniture 15
miss 15
tutti 15
insisted 15
so 15
mr 15
tate 15
was 15
obliged 15
to 15
go 15
ten 15
miles 15
out 15
the 15
road 15
round 15
up 15
the 15
county 15
hounds 15
and 15
put 15
them 15
on 15
the 15
trail 15
mr 15
tate 15
started 15
them 15
off 15
at 15
the 15
misses 15
barbers 15
front 15
steps 15
but 15
all 15
they 15
did 15
was 15
run 15
around 15
to 15
the 15
back 15
of 15
the 15
house 15
and 15
howl 15
at 15
the 15
cellar 15
door 15
when 15
mr 15
tate 15
set 15
them 15
in 15
motion 15
three 15
times 15
he 15
finally 15
guessed 15
the 15
truth 15
by 15
noontime 15
that 15
day 15
there 15
was 15
not 15
a 15
barefooted 15
child 15
to 15
be 15
seen 15
in 15
maycomb 15
and 15
nobody 15
took 15
off 15
his 15
shoes 15
until 15
the 15
hounds 15
were 15
returned 15
so 15
the 15
maycomb 15
ladies 15
said 15
things 15
would 15
be 15
different 15
this 15
year 15
the 15
highschool 15
auditorium 15
would 15
be 15
open 15
there 15
would 15
be 15
a 15
pageant 15
for 15
the 15
grownups 15
applebobbing 15
taffypulling 15
pinning 15
the 15
tail 15
on 15
the 15
donkey 15
for 15
the 15
children 15
there 15
would 15
also 15
be 15
a 15
prize 15
of 15
twentyfive 15
cents 15
for 15
the 15
best 15
halloween 15
costume 15
created 15
by 15
the 15
wearer 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
both 15
groaned 15
not 15
that 15
wed 15
ever 15
done 15
anything 15
it 15
was 15
the 15
principle 15
of 15
the 15
thing 15
jem 15
considered 15
himself 15
too 15
old 15
for 15
halloween 15
anyway 15
he 15
said 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
be 15
caught 15
anywhere 15
near 15
the 15
high 15
school 15
at 15
something 15
like 15
that 15
oh 15
well 15
i 15
thought 15
atticus 15
would 15
take 15
me 15
i 15
soon 15
learned 15
however 15
that 15
my 15
services 15
would 15
be 15
required 15
on 15
stage 15
that 15
evening 15
mrs 15
grace 15
merriweather 15
had 15
composed 15
an 15
original 15
pageant 15
entitled 15
maycomb 15
county 15
ad 15
astra 15
per 15
aspera 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
to 15
be 15
a 15
ham 15
she 15
thought 15
it 15
would 15
be 15
adorable 15
if 15
some 15
of 15
the 15
children 15
were 15
costumed 15
to 15
represent 15
the 15
countys 15
agricultural 15
products 15
cecil 15
jacobs 15
would 15
be 15
dressed 15
up 15
to 15
look 15
like 15
a 15
cow 15
agnes 15
boone 15
would 15
make 15
a 15
lovely 15
butterbean 15
another 15
child 15
would 15
be 15
a 15
peanut 15
and 15
on 15
down 15
the 15
line 15
until 15
mrs 15
merriweathers 15
imagination 15
and 15
the 15
supply 15
of 15
children 15
were 15
exhausted 15
our 15
only 15
duties 15
as 15
far 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
gather 15
from 15
our 15
two 15
rehearsals 15
were 15
to 15
enter 15
from 15
stage 15
left 15
as 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
not 15
only 15
the 15
author 15
but 15
the 15
narrator 15
identified 15
us 15
when 15
she 15
called 15
out 15
pork 15
that 15
was 15
my 15
cue 15
then 15
the 15
assembled 15
company 15
would 15
sing 15
maycomb 15
county 15
maycomb 15
county 15
we 15
will 15
aye 15
be 15
true 15
to 15
thee 15
as 15
the 15
grand 15
finale 15
and 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
would 15
mount 15
the 15
stage 15
with 15
the 15
state 15
flag 15
my 15
costume 15
was 15
not 15
much 15
of 15
a 15
problem 15
mrs 15
crenshaw 15
the 15
local 15
seamstress 15
had 15
as 15
much 15
imagination 15
as 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
mrs 15
crenshaw 15
took 15
some 15
chicken 15
wire 15
and 15
bent 15
it 15
into 15
the 15
shape 15
of 15
a 15
cured 15
ham 15
this 15
she 15
covered 15
with 15
brown 15
cloth 15
and 15
painted 15
it 15
to 15
resemble 15
the 15
original 15
i 15
could 15
duck 15
under 15
and 15
someone 15
would 15
pull 15
the 15
contraption 15
down 15
over 15
my 15
head 15
it 15
came 15
almost 15
to 15
my 15
knees 15
mrs 15
crenshaw 15
thoughtfully 15
left 15
two 15
peepholes 15
for 15
me 15
she 15
did 15
a 15
fine 15
job 15
jem 15
said 15
i 15
looked 15
exactly 15
like 15
a 15
ham 15
with 15
legs 15
there 15
were 15
several 15
discomforts 15
though 15
it 15
was 15
hot 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
close 15
fit 15
if 15
my 15
nose 15
itched 15
i 15
couldnt 15
scratch 15
and 15
once 15
inside 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
get 15
out 15
of 15
it 15
alone 15
when 15
halloween 15
came 15
i 15
assumed 15
that 15
the 15
whole 15
family 15
would 15
be 15
present 15
to 15
watch 15
me 15
perform 15
but 15
i 15
was 15
disappointed 15
atticus 15
said 15
as 15
tactfully 15
as 15
he 15
could 15
that 15
he 15
just 15
didnt 15
think 15
he 15
could 15
stand 15
a 15
pageant 15
tonight 15
he 15
was 15
all 15
in 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
in 15
montgomery 15
for 15
a 15
week 15
and 15
had 15
come 15
home 15
late 15
that 15
afternoon 15
he 15
thought 15
jem 15
might 15
escort 15
me 15
if 15
i 15
asked 15
him 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
said 15
she 15
just 15
had 15
to 15
get 15
to 15
bed 15
early 15
shed 15
been 15
decorating 15
the 15
stage 15
all 15
afternoon 15
and 15
was 15
worn 15
out 15
she 15
stopped 15
short 15
in 15
the 15
middle 15
of 15
her 15
sentence 15
she 15
closed 15
her 15
mouth 15
then 15
opened 15
it 15
to 15
say 15
something 15
but 15
no 15
words 15
came 15
s 15
matter 15
aunty 15
i 15
asked 15
oh 15
nothing 15
nothing 15
she 15
said 15
somebody 15
just 15
walked 15
over 15
my 15
grave 15
she 15
put 15
away 15
from 15
her 15
whatever 15
it 15
was 15
that 15
gave 15
her 15
a 15
pinprick 15
of 15
apprehension 15
and 15
suggested 15
that 15
i 15
give 15
the 15
family 15
a 15
preview 15
in 15
the 15
livingroom 15
so 15
jem 15
squeezed 15
me 15
into 15
my 15
costume 15
stood 15
at 15
the 15
livingroom 15
door 15
called 15
out 15
poork 15
exactly 15
as 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
would 15
have 15
done 15
and 15
i 15
marched 15
in 15
atticus 15
and 15
aunt 15
alexandra 15
were 15
delighted 15
i 15
repeated 15
my 15
part 15
for 15
calpurnia 15
in 15
the 15
kitchen 15
and 15
she 15
said 15
i 15
was 15
wonderful 15
i 15
wanted 15
to 15
go 15
across 15
the 15
street 15
to 15
show 15
miss 15
maudie 15
but 15
jem 15
said 15
shed 15
probably 15
be 15
at 15
the 15
pageant 15
anyway 15
after 15
that 15
it 15
didnt 15
matter 15
whether 15
they 15
went 15
or 15
not 15
jem 15
said 15
he 15
would 15
take 15
me 15
thus 15
began 15
our 15
longest 15
journey 15
together 15
the 15
weather 15
was 15
unusually 15
warm 15
for 15
the 15
last 15
day 15
of 15
october 15
we 15
didnt 15
even 15
need 15
jackets 15
the 15
wind 15
was 15
growing 15
stronger 15
and 15
jem 15
said 15
it 15
might 15
be 15
raining 15
before 15
we 15
got 15
home 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
moon 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
on 15
the 15
corner 15
cast 15
sharp 15
shadows 15
on 15
the 15
radley 15
house 15
i 15
heard 15
jem 15
laugh 15
softly 15
bet 15
nobody 15
bothers 15
them 15
tonight 15
he 15
said 15
jem 15
was 15
carrying 15
my 15
ham 15
costume 15
rather 15
awkwardly 15
as 15
it 15
was 15
hard 15
to 15
hold 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
gallant 15
of 15
him 15
to 15
do 15
so 15
it 15
is 15
a 15
scary 15
place 15
though 15
aint 15
it 15
i 15
said 15
boo 15
doesnt 15
mean 15
anybody 15
any 15
harm 15
but 15
im 15
right 15

the 15
schoolhouse 15
by 15
yourself 15
jem 15
said 15

see 15
why 15
its 15
just 15
around 15
the 15
corner 15
and 15
across 15
the 15
yard 15
that 15
yards 15
a 15
mighty 15
long 15
place 15
for 15
little 15
girls 15
to 15
cross 15
at 15
night 15
jem 15
teased 15
aint 15
you 15
scared 15
of 15
haints 15
we 15
laughed 15
haints 15
hot 15
steams 15
incantations 15
secret 15
signs 15
had 15
vanished 15
with 15
our 15
years 15
as 15
mist 15
with 15
sunrise 15
what 15
was 15
that 15
old 15
thing 15
jem 15

out 15

said 15
we 15
were 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
the 15
radley 15
place 15
jem 15
said 15
boo 15

at 15
home 15
listen 15
high 15
above 15
us 15
in 15
the 15
darkness 15
a 15
solitary 15
mocker 15
poured 15
out 15
his 15
repertoire 15
in 15
blissful 15
unawareness 15
of 15
whose 15
tree 15
he 15
sat 15
in 15
plunging 15
from 15
the 15
shrill 15
kee 15
kee 15
of 15
the 15
sunflower 15
bird 15
to 15
the 15
irascible 15
quaack 15
of 15
a 15
bluejay 15
to 15
the 15
sad 15
lament 15
of 15
poor 15
will 15
poor 15
will 15
poor 15
will 15
we 15
turned 15
the 15
corner 15
and 15
i 15
tripped 15
on 15
a 15
root 15
growing 15
in 15
the 15
road 15
jem 15
tried 15
to 15
help 15
me 15
but 15
all 15
he 15
did 15
was 15
drop 15
my 15
costume 15
in 15
the 15
dust 15
i 15
didnt 15
fall 15
though 15
and 15
soon 15
we 15
were 15
on 15
our 15
way 15
again 15
we 15
turned 15
off 15
the 15
road 15
and 15
entered 15
the 15
schoolyard 15
it 15
was 15
pitch 15
black 15
how 15
do 15
you 15
know 15
where 15

at 15
jem 15
i 15
asked 15
when 15

gone 15
a 15
few 15
steps 15
i 15
can 15
tell 15

under 15
the 15
big 15
oak 15
because 15

passin 15
through 15
a 15
cool 15
spot 15
careful 15
now 15
and 15
dont 15
fall 15
again 15
we 15
had 15
slowed 15
to 15
a 15
cautious 15
gait 15
and 15
were 15
feeling 15
our 15
way 15
forward 15
so 15
as 15
not 15
to 15
bump 15
into 15
the 15
tree 15
the 15
tree 15
was 15
a 15
single 15
and 15
ancient 15
oak 15
two 15
children 15
could 15
not 15
reach 15
around 15
its 15
trunk 15
and 15
touch 15
hands 15
it 15
was 15
far 15
away 15
from 15
teachers 15
their 15
spies 15
and 15
curious 15
neighbors 15
it 15
was 15
near 15
the 15
radley 15
lot 15
but 15
the 15
radleys 15
were 15
not 15
curious 15
a 15
small 15
patch 15
of 15
earth 15
beneath 15
its 15
branches 15
was 15
packed 15
hard 15
from 15
many 15
fights 15
and 15
furtive 15
crap 15
games 15
the 15
lights 15
in 15
the 15
high 15
school 15
auditorium 15
were 15
blazing 15
in 15
the 15

he 15
could 15

a 15

backstage 15
cecil 15

in 15
there 15
scout 15
asked 15
cecil 15
you 15

the 15
national 15
anthem 15
and 15
we 15
heard 15
the 15
audience 15
rise 15
then 15
the 15
bass 15
drum 15
sounded 15
mrs 15

stationed 15
behind 15
her 15

said 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
translating 15
for 15
the 15
rustic 15
elements 15
from 15
the 15
mud 15
to 15
the 15
stars 15
she 15
added 15
unnecessarily 15
it 15
seemed 15
to 15
me 15
a 15
pageant 15
reckon 15
they 15
wouldnt 15
know 15
what 15
it 15
was 15
if 15
she 15
didnt 15
tell 15
em 15
whispered 15
cecil 15
who 15
was 15

shushed 15
the 15
whole 15
town 15

cecil 15
said 15
be 15
quiet 15
back 15
there 15
a 15
mans 15
voice 15
ordered 15
and 15
we 15
were 15
silent 15
the 15
bass 15
drum 15
went 15
boom 15
with 15
every 15
sentence 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
uttered 15
she 15
chanted 15
mournfully 15
about 15
maycomb 15
county 15
being 15
older 15
than 15
the 15
state 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
a 15
part 15
of 15
the 15
mississippi 15
and 15
alabama 15
territories 15
that 15

five 15
times 15
removed 15
who 15
was 15
never 15
heard 15
of 15
again 15
then 15
came 15
the 15
fearless 15
colonel 15
maycomb 15
for 15
whom 15
the 15
county 15
was 15
named 15
andrew 15
jackson 15
appointed 15
him 15
to 15
a 15
position 15
of 15
authority 15
and 15
colonel 15
maycombs 15
misplaced 15
selfconfidence 15
and 15
slender 15
sense 15
of 15
direction 15
brought 15
disaster 15
to 15
all 15
who 15
rode 15
with 15
him 15
in 15
the 15
creek 15
indian 15
wars 15
colonel 15
maycomb 15
persevered 15
in 15
his 15
efforts 15
to 15
make 15
the 15
region 15
safe 15
for 15
democracy 15
but 15
his 15
first 15
campaign 15
was 15
his 15
last 15
his 15
orders 15
relayed 15
to 15
him 15
by 15
a 15
friendly 15
indian 15
runner 15
were 15
to 15
move 15
south 15
after 15
consulting 15
a 15
tree 15
to 15
ascertain 15
from 15
its 15
lichen 15
which 15
way 15
was 15
south 15
and 15
taking 15
no 15
lip 15
from 15
the 15
subordinates 15
who 15
ventured 15
to 15
correct 15
him 15
colonel 15
maycomb 15
set 15
out 15
on 15
a 15
purposeful 15
journey 15
to 15
rout 15
the 15
enemy 15
and 15
entangled 15
his 15
troops 15
so 15
far 15
northwest 15
in 15
the 15
forest 15
primeval 15
that 15
they 15
were 15
eventually 15
rescued 15
by 15
settlers 15
moving 15
inland 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
gave 15
a 15
thirtyminute 15
description 15
of 15
colonel 15
maycombs 15
exploits 15
i 15
discovered 15
that 15
if 15
i 15
bent 15
my 15
knees 15
i 15
could 15
tuck 15
them 15
under 15
my 15
costume 15
and 15
more 15
or 15
less 15
sit 15
i 15
sat 15
down 15
listened 15
to 15
mrs 15
merriweathers 15
drone 15
and 15
the 15
bass 15
drums 15
boom 15
and 15
was 15
soon 15
fast 15
asleep 15
they 15
said 15
later 15
that 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
was 15
putting 15
her 15
all 15
into 15
the 15
grand 15
finale 15
that 15
she 15
had 15
crooned 15
poork 15
with 15
a 15
confidence 15
born 15
of 15
pine 15
trees 15
and 15
butterbeans 15
entering 15
on 15
cue 15
she 15
waited 15
a 15
few 15
seconds 15
then 15
called 15
poork 15
when 15
nothing 15
materialized 15
she 15
yelled 15
pork 15
i 15
must 15
have 15
heard 15
her 15
in 15
my 15
sleep 15
or 15
the 15
band 15
playing 15
dixie 15
woke 15
me 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
when 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
triumphantly 15
mounted 15
the 15
stage 15
with 15
the 15
state 15
flag 15
that 15
i 15
chose 15
to 15
make 15
my 15
entrance 15
chose 15
is 15
incorrect 15
i 15
thought 15

up 15
with 15
the 15
rest 15
of 15
them 15
they 15
told 15
me 15
later 15
that 15
judge 15
taylor 15
went 15
out 15
behind 15
the 15
auditorium 15
and 15
stood 15
there 15
slapping 15
his 15
knees 15
so 15
hard 15
mrs 15
taylor 15
brought 15
him 15
a 15
glass 15
of 15
water 15
and 15
one 15
of 15
his 15
pills 15
mrs 15
merriweather 15
seemed 15
to 15
have 15
a 15
hit 15
everybody 15
was 15
cheering 15
so 15
but 15
she 15
caught 15
me 15
backstage 15

slight 15
pressure 15
on 15
my 15
head 15
and 15

to 15

me 15

along 15
silently 15
minutes 15
up 15
i 15
said 15

about 15
i 15
turned 15
to 15
look 15
at 15
him 15
but 15
his 15
outline 15
was 15
barely 15
visible 15
thought 15
i 15

something 15
he 15
said 15

minute 15

joking 15
the 15
night 15

still 15
i 15
could 15
hear 15
his 15
breath 15
coming 15
easily 15
beside 15
me 15
occasionally 15
there 15
was 15
a 15
sudden 15
breeze 15
that 15
hit 15
my 15
bare 15
legs 15
but 15
it 15
was 15
all 15
that 15
remained 15
of 15
a 15
promised 15
windy 15
night 15
this 15
was 15
the 15
stillness 15
before 15
a 15
thunderstorm 15
we 15
listened 15

to 15
keep 15
his 15
distance 15
i 15
would 15
show 15
cecil 15
that 15
we 15
knew 15
he 15
was 15
behind 15
us 15

we 15
were 15
ready 15

heen 15

no 15
acknowledgement 15
save 15
heen 15
bouncing 15
off 15
the 15
distant 15

jem 15

the 15
schoolhouse 15

it 15
was 15
unlike 15
cecil 15
to 15
hold 15
out 15
for 15
so 15
long 15
once 15
he 15
pulled 15
a 15
joke 15
hed 15
repeat 15
it 15
time 15
and 15
again 15
we 15
should 15
have 15
been 15
leapt 15
at 15
already 15
jem 15
signaled 15
for 15
me 15
to 15
stop 15
again 15
he 15
said 15
softly 15
scout 15

you 15
take 15
that 15
thing 15
off 15

almost 15
to 15
the 15
tree 15
now 15
few 15
yards 15
from 15
that 15
an 15
well 15
be 15
to 15
the 15
road 15
we 15
can 15
see 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
then 15
jem 15
was 15
talking 15
in 15
an 15
unhurried 15
flat 15
toneless 15
voice 15
i 15
wondered 15
how 15
long 15
he 15
would 15
try 15
to 15
keep 15
the 15
cecil 15

increased 15
our 15
pace 15
jem 15
knew 15
as 15
well 15
as 15
i 15
that 15
it 15
was 15
difficult 15
to 15
walk 15
fast 15
without 15
stumping 15
a 15
toe 15
tripping 15
on 15
stones 15
and 15
other 15
inconveniences 15
and 15
i 15
was 15
barefooted 15
maybe 15
it 15
was 15
the 15
wind 15
rustling 15
the 15
trees 15
but 15
there 15
wasnt 15
any 15
wind 15
and 15
there 15
werent 15
any 15
trees 15
except 15
the 15
big 15
oak 15
our 15
company 15
shuffled 15
and 15
dragged 15
his 15
feet 15
as 15
if 15
wearing 15
heavy 15
shoes 15
whoever 15
it 15
was 15
wore 15
thick 15
cotton 15
pants 15
what 15
i 15
thought 15
were 15
trees 15
rustling 15
was 15
the 15
soft 15
swish 15
of 15
cotton 15
on 15
cotton 15
wheek 15
wheek 15
with 15
every 15
step 15
i 15
felt 15
the 15
sand 15
go 15
cold 15
under 15
my 15
feet 15
and 15
i 15
knew 15
we 15
were 15
near 15
the 15
big 15
oak 15
jem 15
pressed 15
my 15
head 15
we 15
stopped 15
and 15
listened 15
shufflefoot 15
had 15
not 15
stopped 15
with 15
us 15
this 15
time 15
his 15
trousers 15
swished 15
softly 15
and 15
steadily 15
then 15
they 15
stopped 15
he 15
was 15
running 15
running 15
toward 15
us 15
with 15
no 15
childs 15
steps 15
run 15
scout 15
run 15
run 15
jem 15
screamed 15
i 15
took 15
one 15
giant 15
step 15
and 15
found 15
myself 15
reeling 15
my 15
arms 15
useless 15
in 15
the 15
dark 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
keep 15
my 15
balance 15
jem 15
jem 15
help 15
me 15
jem 15
something 15
crushed 15
the 15
chicken 15
wire 15
around 15
me 15
metal 15
ripped 15
on 15
metal 15
and 15
i 15
fell 15
to 15
the 15
ground 15
and 15
rolled 15
as 15
far 15
as 15
i 15
could 15
floundering 15
to 15
escape 15
my 15
wire 15
prison 15
from 15
somewhere 15
near 15
by 15
came 15
scuffling 15
kicking 15
sounds 15
sounds 15
of 15
shoes 15
and 15
flesh 15
scraping 15
dirt 15
and 15
roots 15
someone 15
rolled 15
against 15
me 15
and 15
i 15
felt 15
jem 15
he 15
was 15
up 15
like 15
lightning 15
and 15
pulling 15
me 15
with 15
him 15
but 15
though 15
my 15
head 15
and 15
shoulders 15
were 15
free 15
i 15
was 15
so 15
entangled 15
we 15
didnt 15
get 15
very 15
far 15
we 15
were 15
nearly 15
to 15
the 15
road 15
when 15
i 15
felt 15
jems 15
hand 15
leave 15
me 15
felt 15
him 15
jerk 15
backwards 15
to 15
the 15
ground 15
more 15
scuffling 15
and 15
there 15
came 15
a 15
dull 15
crunching 15
sound 15
and 15
jem 15
screamed 15
i 15
ran 15
in 15
the 15
direction 15
of 15
jems 15
scream 15
and 15
sank 15
into 15
a 15
flabby 15
male 15
stomach 15
its 15
owner 15
said 15
uff 15
and 15
tried 15
to 15
catch 15
my 15
arms 15
but 15
they 15
were 15
tightly 15
pinioned 15
his 15
stomach 15
was 15
soft 15
but 15
his 15
arms 15
were 15
like 15
steel 15
he 15
slowly 15
squeezed 15
the 15
breath 15
out 15
of 15
me 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
move 15
suddenly 15
he 15
was 15
jerked 15
backwards 15
and 15
flung 15
on 15
the 15
ground 15
almost 15
carrying 15
me 15
with 15
him 15
i 15
thought 15
jems 15
up 15
ones 15
mind 15
works 15
very 15
slowly 15
at 15
times 15
stunned 15
i 15
stood 15
there 15
dumbly 15
the 15
scuffling 15
noises 15
were 15
dying 15
someone 15
wheezed 15
and 15
the 15
night 15
was 15
still 15
again 15
still 15
but 15
for 15
a 15
man 15
breathing 15
heavily 15
breathing 15
heavily 15
and 15
staggering 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
went 15
to 15
the 15
tree 15
and 15
leaned 15
against 15
it 15
he 15
coughed 15
violently 15
a 15
sobbing 15
boneshaking 15
cough 15
jem 15
there 15
was 15
no 15
answer 15
but 15
the 15
mans 15
heavy 15
breathing 15
jem 15
jem 15
didnt 15
answer 15
the 15
man 15
began 15
moving 15
around 15
as 15
if 15
searching 15
for 15
something 15
i 15
heard 15
him 15
groan 15
and 15
pull 15
something 15
heavy 15
along 15
the 15
ground 15
it 15
was 15
slowly 15
coming 15
to 15
me 15
that 15
there 15
were 15
now 15
four 15
people 15
under 15
the 15
tree 15
atticus 15
the 15
man 15
was 15
walking 15
heavily 15
and 15
unsteadily 15
toward 15
the 15
road 15
i 15
went 15
to 15
where 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
and 15
felt 15
frantically 15
along 15
the 15
ground 15
reaching 15
out 15
with 15
my 15
toes 15
presently 15
i 15
touched 15
someone 15
jem 15
my 15
toes 15
touched 15
trousers 15
a 15
belt 15
buckle 15
buttons 15
something 15
i 15
could 15
not 15
identify 15
a 15
collar 15
and 15
a 15
face 15
a 15
prickly 15
stubble 15
on 15
the 15
face 15

from 15
the 15
livingroom 15
mr 15
tate 15
sat 15
in 15
jems 15
desk 15
chair 15
he 15
waited 15
until 15
atticus 15
returned 15
and 15
settled 15
himself 15
i 15
wondered 15
why 15
atticus 15
had 15
not 15
brought 15
a 15
chair 15
for 15
the 15
man 15
in 15
the 15
corner 15
but 15
atticus 15
knew 15
the 15
ways 15
of 15
country 15
people 15
far 15
better 15
than 15
i 15
some 15
of 15
his 15
rural 15
clients 15
would 15
park 15
their 15
longeared 15
steeds 15
under 15
the 15
chinaberry 15
trees 15
in 15
the 15
back 15
yard 15
and 15
atticus 15
would 15
often 15
keep 15
appointments 15
on 15
the 15
back 15
steps 15
this 15
one 15
was 15
probably 15
more 15
comfortable 15
where 15
he 15
was 15
mr 15
finch 15

behaving 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
on 15
the 15

liked 15
to 15
tell 15
things 15
his 15
own 15
way 15
untrammeled 15
by 15
state 15
or 15
defense 15
and 15
sometimes 15
it 15

while 15

rubbed 15
his 15
left 15
arm 15
and 15
investigated 15
jems 15

then 15
he 15
seemed 15
to 15
be 15
interested 15
in 15
the 15
fireplace 15
his 15
fingers 15
sought 15

his 15
one 15
sign 15
of 15
inner 15
turmoil 15
the 15
strong 15

a 15
minute 15
scout 15

hers 15
going 15
in 15
her 15

because 15
she 15
told 15
him 15
to 15
turn 15
his 15
down 15
a 15
bit 15
so 15
she 15
could 15
hear 15

atticus 15
smiled 15
i 15
always 15
play 15
a 15
radio 15
too 15
loud 15
i 15
wonder 15
if 15
the 15
neighbors 15
heard 15
anything 15
said 15
mr 15
tate 15
i 15
doubt 15
it 15
heck 15
most 15
of 15
them 15
listen 15
to 15
their 15
radios 15
or 15
go 15
to 15
bed 15
with 15
the 15
chickens 15
maudie 15
atkinson 15
may 15
have 15
been 15
up 15
but 15
i 15
doubt 15
it 15
go 15
ahead 15
scout 15
mr 15
tate 15
said 15
well 15
after 15
jem 15
yelled 15
we 15
walked 15
on 15
mr 15
tate 15
i 15
was 15
shut 15
up 15
in 15
my 15
costume 15
but 15
i 15
could 15
hear 15
it 15
myself 15
then 15
footsteps 15
i 15
mean 15
they 15
walked 15
when 15
we 15
walked 15
and 15
stopped 15
when 15
we 15
stopped 15
jem 15
said 15
he 15
could 15
see 15
me 15
because 15
mrs 15
crenshaw 15
put 15
some 15
kind 15
of 15
shiny 15
paint 15
on 15
my 15
costume 15
i 15
was 15
a 15
ham 15
hows 15
that 15
asked 15
mr 15
tate 15
startled 15
atticus 15
described 15
my 15
role 15
to 15
mr 15
tate 15
plus 15
the 15
construction 15
of 15
my 15
garment 15
you 15
should 15
have 15
seen 15
her 15
when 15
she 15
came 15
in 15
he 15
said 15
it 15
was 15
crushed 15
to 15
a 15
pulp 15
mr 15
tate 15
rubbed 15
his 15
chin 15
i 15
wondered 15
why 15
he 15
had 15
those 15
marks 15
on 15
him 15
his 15
sleeves 15
were 15
perforated 15
with 15
little 15
holes 15
there 15
were 15
one 15
or 15
two 15
little 15
puncture 15
marks 15
on 15
his 15
arms 15
to 15
match 15
the 15
holes 15
let 15
me 15
see 15
that 15
thing 15
if 15
you 15
will 15
sir 15
atticus 15
fetched 15
the 15
remains 15
of 15
my 15
costume 15
mr 15
tate 15
turned 15
it 15
over 15
and 15
bent 15
it 15
around 15
to 15
get 15
an 15
idea 15
of 15
its 15
former 15
shape 15
this 15
thing 15
probably 15
saved 15
her 15
life 15
he 15
said 15
look 15
he 15
pointed 15
with 15
a 15
long 15
forefinger 15
a 15
shiny 15
clean 15
line 15
stood 15
out 15
on 15
the 15
dull 15
wire 15
bob 15
ewell 15
meant 15
business 15
mr 15
tate 15
muttered 15
he 15
was 15
out 15
of 15
his 15
mind 15
said 15
atticus 15
dont 15
like 15
to 15
contradict 15
you 15
mr 15
finch 15
wasnt 15
crazy 15

as 15
hell 15
lowdown 15
skunk 15
with 15
enough 15
liquor 15
in 15
him 15
to 15
make 15
him 15
brave 15
enough 15
to 15
kill 15
children 15
hed 15
never 15
have 15
met 15
you 15
face 15
to 15
face 15
atticus 15
shook 15
his 15
head 15
i 15
cant 15
conceive 15
of 15
a 15
man 15
whod 15
mr 15
finch 15
theres 15
just 15
some 15

of 15

em 15
ewell 15
as 15
one 15

got 15
it 15
all 15
out 15
of 15
him 15
the 15
day 15

thought 15
hed 15
come 15
after 15
me 15
he 15
had 15
guts 15
enough 15
to 15

a 15
poor 15
colored 15
woman 15
he 15
had 15
guts 15
enough 15
to 15

of 15
they 15

started 15
pullin 15

some 15
mr 15
ewell 15
yanked 15

down 15
i 15
reckon 15
they 15
tussled 15
some 15
more 15

then 15
there 15
was 15
this 15
funny 15

jem 15
hollered 15
and 15
i 15

any 15
more 15
an 15
the 15
next 15

mr 15
ewell 15
was 15
tryin 15
to 15

down 15
jem 15

then 15
mr 15
tate 15
was 15
looking 15
at 15
me 15
sharply 15
somebody 15
was 15
staggerin 15
around 15
and 15
pantin 15
and 15
coughing 15
fit 15
to 15
die 15
i 15
thought 15
it 15
was 15
jem 15
at 15
first 15
but 15
it 15
didnt 15
sound 15
like 15
him 15
so 15
i 15
went 15
lookin 15
for 15
jem 15
on 15
the 15
ground 15
i 15
thought 15
atticus 15
had 15
come 15
to 15
help 15
us 15
and 15
had 15
got 15
wore 15
out 15
who 15
was 15
it 15
why 15
there 15
he 15
is 15
mr 15
tate 15
he 15
can 15
tell 15
you 15
his 15
name 15
as 15
i 15
said 15
it 15
i 15
half 15
pointed 15
to 15
the 15
man 15
in 15
the 15
corner 15
but 15
brought 15
my 15
arm 15
down 15
quickly 15
lest 15
atticus 15
reprimand 15
me 15
for 15
pointing 15
it 15
was 15
impolite 15
to 15
point 15
he 15
was 15
still 15
leaning 15
against 15
the 15
wall 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
leaning 15
against 15
the 15
wall 15
when 15
i 15
came 15
into 15
the 15
room 15
his 15
arms 15
folded 15
across 15
his 15
chest 15
as 15
i 15
pointed 15
he 15
brought 15
his 15
arms 15
down 15
and 15
pressed 15
the 15
palms 15
of 15
his 15
hands 15
against 15
the 15
wall 15
they 15
were 15
white 15
hands 15
sickly 15
white 15
hands 15
that 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
the 15
sun 15
so 15
white 15
they 15
stood 15
out 15
garishly 15
against 15
the 15
dull 15
cream 15
wall 15
in 15
the 15
dim 15
light 15
of 15
jems 15
room 15
i 15
looked 15
from 15
his 15
hands 15
to 15
his 15
sandstained 15
khaki 15
pants 15
my 15
eyes 15
traveled 15
up 15
his 15
thin 15
frame 15
to 15
his 15
torn 15
denim 15
shirt 15
his 15
face 15
was 15
as 15
white 15
as 15
his 15
hands 15
but 15
for 15
a 15
shadow 15
on 15
his 15
jutting 15
chin 15
his 15
cheeks 15
were 15
thin 15
to 15
hollowness 15
his 15
mouth 15
was 15
wide 15
there 15
were 15
shallow 15
almost 15
delicate 15
indentations 15
at 15
his 15
temples 15
and 15
his 15
gray 15
eyes 15
were 15
so 15
colorless 15
i 15
thought 15
he 15
was 15
blind 15
his 15
hair 15
was 15
dead 15
and 15
thin 15
almost 15
feathery 15
on 15
top 15
of 15
his 15
head 15
when 15
i 15
pointed 15
to 15
him 15
his 15
palms 15
slipped 15
slightly 15
leaving 15
greasy 15
sweat 15
streaks 15
on 15
the 15
wall 15
and 15
he 15
hooked 15
his 15
thumbs 15
in 15
his 15
belt 15
a 15
strange 15
small 15
spasm 15
shook 15
him 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
heard 15
fingernails 15
scrape 15
slate 15
but 15
as 15
i 15
gazed 15
at 15
him 15
in 15
wonder 15
the 15
tension 15
slowly 15
drained 15
from 15
his 15
face 15
his 15
lips 15
parted 15
into 15
a 15
timid 15
smile 15
and 15
our 15
neighbors 15
image 15
blurred 15
with 15
my 15
sudden 15
tears 15
hey 15
boo 15
i 15
said 15
mr 15
arthur 15
honey 15
said 15
atticus 15
gently 15
correcting 15
me 15
jean 15
louise 15
this 15
is 15
mr 15
arthur 15
radley 15
i 15
believe 15
he 15
already 15
knows 15
you 15
if 15
atticus 15
could 15
blandly 15
introduce 15
me 15
to 15
boo 15
radley 15
at 15
a 15
time 15
like 15
this 15
well 15
that 15
was 15
atticus 15
boo 15
saw 15
me 15
run 15
instinctively 15
to 15
the 15
bed 15
where 15
jem 15
was 15
sleeping 15
for 15
the 15
same 15
shy 15
smile 15
crept 15
across 15
his 15
face 15
hot 15
with 15
embarrassment 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
cover 15
up 15
by 15
covering 15
jem 15
up 15
ahah 15
dont 15
touch 15
him 15
atticus 15
said 15
mr 15
heck 15
tate 15
sat 15
looking 15
intently 15
at 15
boo 15
through 15
his 15
hornrimmed 15
glasses 15
he 15
was 15
about 15
to 15
speak 15
when 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
came 15
down 15
the 15
hall 15
everybody 15
out 15
he 15
said 15
as 15
he 15
came 15
in 15
the 15
door 15
evenin 15
arthur 15

first 15
time 15
i 15
was 15
here 15
dr 15
reynoldss 15
voice 15
was 15
as 15
breezy 15
as 15
his 15
step 15
as 15
though 15
he 15
had 15
said 15
it 15
every 15
evening 15
of 15
his 15
life 15
an 15
announcement 15
that 15
astounded 15
me 15
even 15
more 15
than 15
being 15
in 15
the 15
same 15
room 15
with 15
boo 15
radley 15
of 15
course 15
even 15
boo 15
radley 15
got 15
sick 15
sometimes 15
i 15
thought 15
but 15
on 15
the 15
other 15
hand 15
i 15
wasnt 15
sure 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
was 15
carrying 15
a 15
big 15
package 15
wrapped 15
in 15
newspaper 15
he 15
put 15
it 15
down 15
on 15
jems 15
desk 15
and 15
took 15
off 15
his 15
coat 15
youre 15
quite 15
satisfied 15
hes 15
alive 15
now 15
tell 15
you 15
how 15
i 15
knew 15
when 15
i 15
tried 15
to 15
examine 15
him 15
he 15
kicked 15
me 15
had 15
to 15
put 15
him 15
out 15
good 15
and 15
proper 15
to 15
touch 15
him 15
so 15
scat 15
he 15
said 15
to 15
me 15
er 15
said 15
atticus 15
glancing 15
at 15
boo 15
heck 15
lets 15
go 15
out 15
on 15
the 15
front 15
porch 15

plenty 15
of 15
chairs 15
out 15
there 15
and 15
its 15
still 15
warm 15
enough 15
i 15
wondered 15
why 15
atticus 15
was 15
inviting 15
us 15
to 15
the 15
front 15
porch 15
instead 15
of 15
the 15
livingroom 15

i 15
understood 15
the 15
livingroom 15
lights 15
were 15
awfully 15
strong 15
we 15
filed 15
out 15
first 15
mr 15
tate 15
atticus 15
was 15
waiting 15
at 15
the 15
door 15
for 15
him 15
to 15
go 15
ahead 15
of 15
him 15
then 15
he 15
changed 15
his 15
mind 15
and 15
followed 15
mr 15
tate 15
people 15
have 15
a 15
habit 15
of 15
doing 15
everyday 15
things 15
even 15
under 15
the 15
oddest 15
conditions 15

looked 15
down 15
at 15
me 15
and 15
nodded 15
i 15
led 15
him 15
through 15
the 15
hall 15
and 15
past 15

corner 15
of 15
the 15

he 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
wisteria 15
vine 15
in 15
his 15
own 15
way 15

stubborn 15
as 15
the 15
other 15

wondered 15
who 15

give 15
in 15
first 15
atticuss 15
stubbornness 15
was 15
quiet 15
and 15
rarely 15
evident 15
but 15
in 15
some 15
ways 15
he 15
was 15
as 15
set 15
as 15
the 15
cunninghams 15
mr 15
tates 15
was 15
unschooled 15
and 15
blunt 15

equal 15
to 15
my 15
fathers 15

at 15
him 15

across 15
the 15
front 15
yard 15

and 15

looking 15
at 15
the 15
floor 15
for 15
a 15
long 15
time 15
finally 15
he 15
raised 15
his 15
head 15
scout 15

said 15

cheering 15
up 15
i 15
ran 15
to 15
him 15
and 15

reassured 15
him 15
mr 15
tate 15
was 15
right 15
atticus 15
disengaged 15
himself 15
and 15
looked 15
at 15
me 15
what 15
do 15
you 15
mean 15
well 15

it 15
atticus 15
put 15
his 15
face 15
in 15
my 15
hair 15
and 15
rubbed 15
it 15
when 15
he 15
got 15
up 15
and 15
walked 15
across 15
the 15
porch 15
into 15
the 15
shadows 15
his 15
youthful 15
step 15
had 15
returned 15
before 15
he 15
went 15
inside 15
the 15
house 15
he 15
stopped 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
boo 15
radley 15
thank 15
you 15
for 15
my 15
children 15
arthur 15
he 15
said 15
when 15
boo 15
radley 15
shuffled 15
to 15
his 15
feet 15
light 15
from 15
the 15
livingroom 15
windows 15
glistened 15
on 15
his 15
forehead 15
every 15
move 15
he 15
made 15
was 15
uncertain 15
as 15
if 15
he 15
were 15
not 15
sure 15
his 15
hands 15
and 15
feet 15
could 15
make 15
proper 15
contact 15
with 15
the 15
things 15
he 15
touched 15
he 15
coughed 15
his 15
dreadful 15
raling 15
cough 15
and 15
was 15
so 15
shaken 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
sit 15
down 15
again 15
his 15
hand 15
searched 15
for 15
his 15
hip 15
pocket 15
and 15
he 15
pulled 15
out 15
a 15
handkerchief 15
he 15
coughed 15
into 15
it 15
then 15
he 15
wiped 15
his 15
forehead 15
having 15
been 15
so 15
accustomed 15
to 15
his 15
absence 15
i 15
found 15
it 15
incredible 15
that 15
he 15
had 15
been 15
sitting 15
beside 15
me 15
all 15
this 15
time 15
present 15
he 15
had 15
not 15
made 15
a 15
sound 15
once 15
more 15
he 15
got 15
to 15
his 15
feet 15
he 15
turned 15
to 15
me 15
and 15
nodded 15
toward 15
the 15
front 15
door 15
youd 15
like 15
to 15
say 15
good 15

just 15

a 15
minute 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
left 15
some 15
her 15
voice 15
trailed 15
away 15
boo 15
had 15
drifted 15
to 15
a 15
corner 15
of 15
the 15
room 15
where 15
he 15
stood 15
with 15
his 15
chin 15
up 15
peering 15
from 15
a 15
distance 15
at 15
jem 15
i 15
took 15
him 15
by 15
the 15
hand 15
a 15
hand 15
surprisingly 15
warm 15
for 15
its 15
whiteness 15
i 15
tugged 15
him 15
a 15
little 15
and 15
he 15
allowed 15
me 15
to 15
lead 15
him 15
to 15
jems 15
bed 15
dr 15
reynolds 15
had 15
made 15
a 15
tentlike 15
arrangement 15
over 15
jems 15
arm 15
to 15
keep 15
the 15
cover 15
off 15
i 15
guess 15
and 15
boo 15
leaned 15
forward 15
and 15
looked 15
over 15
it 15
an 15
expression 15
of 15
timid 15
curiosity 15
was 15
on 15
his 15
face 15
as 15
though 15
he 15
had 15
never 15
seen 15
a 15
boy 15
before 15
his 15
mouth 15
was 15
slightly 15
open 15
and 15
he 15
looked 15
at 15
jem 15
from 15
head 15
to 15
foot 15
boos 15
hand 15
came 15
up 15
but 15
he 15
let 15
it 15
drop 15
to 15
his 15
side 15
you 15
can 15
pet 15
him 15
mr 15
arthur 15
hes 15
asleep 15

couldnt 15
if 15
he 15
was 15
awake 15
though 15
he 15
wouldnt 15
let 15
you 15
i 15
found 15
myself 15
explaining 15
go 15
ahead 15
boos 15
hand 15
hovered 15
over 15
jems 15
head 15
go 15
on 15
sir 15
hes 15
asleep 15
his 15
hand 15
came 15
down 15
lightly 15
on 15
jems 15
hair 15
i 15
was 15
beginning 15
to 15
learn 15
his 15
body 15
english 15
his 15
hand 15
tightened 15
on 15
mine 15
and 15
he 15
indicated 15
that 15
he 15
wanted 15
to 15
leave 15
i 15
led 15
him 15
to 15
the 15
front 15
porch 15
where 15
his 15
uneasy 15
steps 15
halted 15
he 15
was 15
still 15
holding 15
my 15
hand 15
and 15
he 15
gave 15
no 15
sign 15
of 15
letting 15
me 15
go 15
will 15
you 15
take 15
me 15
home 15
he 15
almost 15
whispered 15
it 15
in 15
the 15
voice 15
of 15
a 15
child 15
afraid 15
of 15
the 15
dark 15
i 15
put 15
my 15
foot 15
on 15
the 15
top 15
step 15
and 15
stopped 15
i 15
would 15
lead 15
him 15
through 15
our 15
house 15
but 15
i 15
would 15
never 15
lead 15
him 15
home 15
mr 15
arthur 15
bend 15
your 15
arm 15
down 15
here 15
like 15
that 15
thats 15
right 15
sir 15
i 15
slipped 15
my 15
hand 15
into 15
the 15
crook 15
of 15
his 15
arm 15
he 15
had 15
to 15
stoop 15
a 15
little 15
to 15
accommodate 15
me 15
but 15
if 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
was 15
watching 15
from 15
her 15
upstairs 15
window 15
she 15
would 15
see 15
arthur 15
radley 15
escorting 15
me 15
down 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
as 15
any 15
gentleman 15
would 15
do 15
we 15
came 15
to 15
the 15
street 15
light 15
on 15
the 15
corner 15
and 15
i 15
wondered 15
how 15
many 15
times 15
dill 15
had 15
stood 15
there 15
hugging 15
the 15
fat 15
pole 15
watching 15
waiting 15
hoping 15
i 15
wondered 15
how 15
many 15
times 15
jem 15
and 15
i 15
had 15
made 15
this 15
journey 15
but 15
i 15
entered 15
the 15
radley 15
front 15
gate 15
for 15
the 15
second 15
time 15
in 15
my 15
life 15
boo 15
and 15
i 15
walked 15
up 15
the 15
steps 15
to 15
the 15
porch 15
his 15
fingers 15
found 15
the 15
front 15
doorknob 15
he 15
gently 15
released 15
my 15
hand 15
opened 15
the 15
door 15
went 15
inside 15
and 15
shut 15
the 15
door 15
behind 15
him 15
i 15
never 15
saw 15
him 15
again 15
neighbors 15
bring 15
food 15
with 15
death 15
and 15
flowers 15
with 15
sickness 15
and 15
little 15
things 15
in 15
between 15
boo 15
was 15
our 15
neighbor 15
he 15
gave 15
us 15
two 15
soap 15
dolls 15
a 15
broken 15
watch 15
and 15
chain 15
a 15
pair 15
of 15
goodluck 15
pennies 15
and 15
our 15
lives 15
but 15
neighbors 15
give 15
in 15
return 15
we 15
never 15
put 15
back 15
into 15
the 15
tree 15
what 15
we 15
took 15
out 15
of 15
it 15

even 15

left 15
of 15

long 15
shuttered 15
window 15

in 15
front 15
of 15

turned 15
around 15
in 15
daylight 15

postoffice 15
corner 15
daylight 15
in 15
my 15
mind 15
the 15
night 15
faded 15
it 15
was 15
daytime 15
and 15
the 15
neighborhood 15
was 15
busy 15
miss 15
stephanie 15
crawford 15
crossed 15
the 15
street 15
to 15
tell 15
the 15
latest 15
to 15
miss 15
rachel 15
miss 15
maudie 15
bent 15
over 15
her 15
azaleas 15
it 15
was 15
summertime 15
and 15
two 15
children 15
scampered 15
down 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
toward 15
a 15
man 15
approaching 15
in 15
the 15
distance 15
the 15
man 15
waved 15
and 15
the 15
children 15
raced 15
each 15
other 15
to 15
him 15
it 15
was 15
still 15
summertime 15
and 15
the 15
children 15
came 15
closer 15
a 15
boy 15
trudged 15
down 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
dragging 15
a 15
fishingpole 15
behind 15
him 15
a 15
man 15
stood 15
waiting 15
with 15
his 15
hands 15
on 15
his 15
hips 15
summertime 15
and 15
his 15
children 15
played 15
in 15
the 15
front 15
yard 15
with 15
their 15
friend 15
enacting 15
a 15
strange 15
little 15
drama 15
of 15
their 15
own 15
invention 15
it 15
was 15
fall 15
and 15
his 15
children 15
fought 15
on 15
the 15
sidewalk 15
in 15
front 15
of 15
mrs 15
duboses 15
the 15
boy 15
helped 15
his 15
sister 15
to 15
her 15
feet 15
and 15
they 15
made 15
their 15
way 15
home 15
fall 15
and 15
his 15
children 15
trotted 15
to 15
and 15
fro 15
around 15
the 15
corner 15
the 15
days 15
woes 15
and 15
triumphs 15
on 15
their 15
faces 15
they 15
stopped 15
at 15
an 15
oak 15
tree 15
delighted 15
puzzled 15
apprehensive 15
winter 15
and 15
his 15
children 15
shivered 15
at 15
the 15
front 15
gate 15
silhouetted 15
against 15
a 15
blazing 15
house 15
winter 15
and 15
a 15
man 15
walked 15
into 15
the 15
street 15
dropped 15
his 15
glasses 15
and 15
shot 15
a 15
dog 15
summer 15
and 15
he 15
watched 15
his 15
childrens 15
heart 15
break 15
autumn 15
again 15
and 15
boos 15
children 15
needed 15
him 15
atticus 15
was 15
right 15
one 15
time 15
he 15
said 15
you 15
never 15
really 15
know 15
a 15
man 15
until 15
you 15
stand 15
in 15
his 15
shoes 15
and 15
walk 15
around 15
in 15
them 15
just 15
standing 15
on 15
the 15
radley 15
porch 15
was 15
enough 15
the 15
street 15
lights 15
were 15
fuzzy 15
from 15
the 15
fine 15
rain 15
that 15
was 15
falling 15
as 15
i 15
made 15
my 15
way 15
home 15
i 15
felt 15
very 15
old 15
but 15
when 15
i 15
looked 15
at 15
the 15
tip 15
of 15
my 15
nose 15
i 15
could 15
see 15
fine 15
misty 15
beads 15
but 15
looking 15
crosseyed 15
made 15
me 15
dizzy 15
so 15
i 15
quit 15
as 15
i 15
made 15
my 15

the 16
time 16
it 16
takes 16
us 16
a 16
rather 16
conservative 16
estimate 16
is 16
fifty 16

this 16
projected 16
audience 16
is 16
one 16

our 16

per 16

is 16
nominally 16
estimated 16
at 16
one 16
dollar 16
then 16
we 16
produce 16
million 16
dollars 16
per 16
hour 16
this 16
year 16
as 16
we 16
release 16
thirtysix 16

more 16

these 16
reach 16
just 16
of 16
the 16
computerized 16

the 16

this 16
year 16
the 16
goal 16
of 16

is 16
to 16

one 16
trillion 16

ten 16

is 16
only 16

users 16
at 16
our 16
revised 16

of 16

we 16
will 16
reach 16
only 16
onethird 16

marcus 16
aurelius 16
antoninus 16
was 16
born 16
on 16
april 16
ad 16
his 16
real 16
name 16
was 16
m 16
annius 16
verus 16
and 16
he 16
was 16
sprung 16
of 16
a 16
noble 16
family 16
which 16
claimed 16
descent 16
from 16
numa 16
second 16
king 16
of 16
rome 16
thus 16
the 16
most 16
religious 16
of 16
emperors 16
came 16
of 16
the 16
blood 16
of 16
the 16
most 16
pious 16
of 16
early 16
kings 16
his 16
father 16
annius 16
verus 16
had 16
held 16
high 16
office 16
in 16
rome 16
and 16
his 16
grandfather 16
of 16
the 16
same 16
name 16
had 16
been 16
thrice 16
consul 16
both 16
his 16
parents 16
died 16
young 16
but 16
marcus 16
held 16
them 16
in 16
loving 16
remembrance 16
on 16
his 16
fathers 16
death 16
marcus 16
was 16
adopted 16
by 16
his 16
grandfather 16
the 16
consular 16
annius 16
verus 16
and 16
there 16
was 16
deep 16
love 16
between 16
these 16
two 16
on 16
the 16
very 16
first 16
page 16
of 16
his 16
book 16
marcus 16
gratefully 16
declares 16
how 16
of 16
his 16
grandfather 16
he 16
had 16
learned 16
to 16
be 16
gentle 16
and 16
meek 16
and 16
to 16
refrain 16
from 16
all 16
anger 16
and 16
passion 16
the 16
emperor 16
hadrian 16
divined 16
the 16
fine 16
character 16
of 16
the 16
lad 16
whom 16
he 16
used 16
to 16
call 16
not 16
verus 16
but 16
verissimus 16
more 16
truthful 16
than 16
his 16
own 16
name 16
he 16
advanced 16
marcus 16
to 16
equestrian 16
rank 16
when 16
six 16
years 16
of 16
age 16
and 16
at 16
the 16
age 16
of 16
eight 16
made 16
him 16
a 16
member 16
of 16
the 16
ancient 16
salian 16
priesthood 16
the 16
boys 16
aunt 16
annia 16
galeria 16
faustina 16
was 16
married 16
to 16
antoninus 16
pius 16
afterwards 16
emperor 16
hence 16
it 16
came 16
about 16
that 16
antoninus 16
having 16
no 16
son 16
adopted 16
marcus 16
changing 16
his 16
name 16
to 16
that 16
which 16
he 16
is 16
known 16
by 16
and 16
betrothed 16
him 16
to 16
his 16
daughter 16
faustina 16
his 16
education 16
was 16
conducted 16
with 16
all 16
care 16
the 16
ablest 16
teachers 16
were 16
engaged 16
for 16
him 16
and 16
he 16
was 16
trained 16
in 16
the 16
strict 16
doctrine 16
of 16
the 16
stoic 16
philosophy 16
which 16
was 16
his 16
great 16
delight 16
he 16
was 16
taught 16
to 16
dress 16
plainly 16
and 16
to 16
live 16
simply 16
to 16
avoid 16
all 16
softness 16
and 16
luxury 16
his 16
body 16
was 16
trained 16
to 16
hardihood 16
by 16
wrestling 16
hunting 16
and 16
outdoor 16
games 16
and 16
though 16
his 16
constitution 16
was 16
weak 16
he 16
showed 16
great 16
personal 16
courage 16
to 16
encounter 16
the 16
fiercest 16
boars 16
at 16
the 16
same 16
time 16
he 16
was 16
kept 16
from 16
the 16
extravagancies 16
of 16
his 16
day 16
the 16
great 16
excitement 16
in 16
rome 16
was 16
the 16
strife 16
of 16
the 16
factions 16
as 16
they 16
were 16
called 16
in 16
the 16
circus 16
the 16
racing 16
drivers 16
used 16
to 16
adopt 16
one 16
of 16
four 16
coloursred 16
blue 16
white 16
or 16
greenand 16
their 16
partisans 16
showed 16
an 16
eagerness 16
in 16
supporting 16
them 16
which 16
nothing 16
could 16
surpass 16
riot 16
and 16
corruption 16
went 16
in 16
the 16
train 16
of 16
the 16
racing 16
chariots 16
and 16
from 16
all 16
these 16
things 16
marcus 16
held 16
severely 16
aloof 16
in 16
marcus 16
was 16
raised 16
to 16
the 16
consulship 16
and 16
in 16
his 16
betrothal 16
was 16
consummated 16
by 16
marriage 16
two 16
years 16
later 16
faustina 16
brought 16
him 16
a 16
daughter 16
and 16
soon 16
after 16
the 16
tribunate 16
and 16
other 16
imperial 16
honours 16
were 16
conferred 16
upon 16
him 16
antoninus 16
pius 16
died 16
in 16
and 16
marcus 16
assumed 16
the 16
imperial 16
state 16
he 16
at 16
once 16
associated 16
with 16
himself 16
l 16
ceionius 16
commodus 16
whom 16
antoninus 16
had 16
adopted 16
as 16
a 16
younger 16
son 16
at 16
the 16
same 16
time 16
with 16
marcus 16
giving 16
him 16
the 16
name 16
of 16
lucius 16
aurelius 16
verus 16
henceforth 16
the 16
two 16
are 16
colleagues 16
in 16
the 16
empire 16

as 16
it 16
were 16
to 16
succeed 16
no 16
sooner 16
was 16
marcus 16
settled 16
upon 16
the 16

due 16
no 16

to 16

to 16
his 16
wisdom 16
in 16
choice 16
of 16
lieutenants 16
shown 16
conspicuously 16
in 16
the 16
case 16
of 16
pertinax 16
there 16
were 16
several 16
important 16
battles 16
fought 16
in 16
these 16
campaigns 16
and 16
one 16
of 16
them 16
has 16
become 16
celebrated 16
for 16
the 16
legend 16
of 16
the 16
thundering 16
legion 16
in 16
a 16
battle 16
against 16
the 16
quadi 16
in 16
the 16
day 16
seemed 16
to 16
he 16
going 16
in 16
favour 16
of 16
the 16
foe 16
when 16
on 16
a 16
sudden 16
arose 16
a 16
great 16
storm 16
of 16
thunder 16
and 16
rain 16
the 16
lightning 16
struck 16
the 16
barbarians 16
with 16
terror 16
and 16
they 16
turned 16
to 16
rout 16
in 16
later 16
days 16
this 16
storm 16
was 16
said 16
to 16
have 16
been 16
sent 16
in 16
answer 16
to 16
the 16
prayers 16
of 16
a 16
legion 16
which 16
contained 16
many 16
christians 16
and 16
the 16
name 16
thundering 16
legion 16
should 16
he 16
given 16
to 16
it 16
on 16
this 16
account 16
the 16
title 16
of 16
thundering 16
legion 16
is 16
known 16
at 16
an 16
earlier 16
date 16
so 16
this 16
part 16
of 16
the 16
story 16
at 16
least 16
cannot 16
be 16
true 16
but 16
the 16
aid 16
of 16
the 16
storm 16
is 16
acknowledged 16
by 16
one 16
of 16
the 16
scenes 16
carved 16
on 16
antonines 16
column 16
at 16
rome 16
which 16
commemorates 16
these 16
wars 16
the 16
settlement 16
made 16
after 16
these 16
troubles 16
might 16
have 16
been 16
more 16
satisfactory 16
but 16
for 16
an 16
unexpected 16
rising 16
in 16
the 16
east 16
avidius 16
cassius 16
an 16
able 16
captain 16
who 16
had 16
won 16
renown 16
in 16
the 16
parthian 16
wars 16
was 16
at 16
this 16
time 16
chief 16
governor 16
of 16
the 16
eastern 16
provinces 16
by 16
whatever 16
means 16
induced 16
he 16
had 16
conceived 16
the 16
project 16
of 16
proclaiming 16
himself 16
emperor 16
as 16
soon 16
as 16
marcus 16
who 16
was 16
then 16
in 16
feeble 16
health 16
should 16
die 16
and 16
a 16
report 16
having 16
been 16
conveyed 16
to 16
him 16
that 16
marcus 16
was 16
dead 16
cassius 16
did 16
as 16
he 16
had 16
planned 16
marcus 16
on 16
hearing 16
the 16
news 16
immediately 16
patched 16
up 16
a 16
peace 16
and 16
returned 16
home 16
to 16
meet 16
this 16
new 16
peril 16
the 16
emperors 16
great 16
grief 16
was 16
that 16
he 16
must 16
needs 16
engage 16
in 16
the 16
horrors 16
of 16
civil 16
strife 16
he 16
praised 16
the 16
qualities 16
of 16
cassius 16
and 16
expressed 16
a 16
heartfelt 16
wish 16
that 16
cassius 16
might 16
not 16
be 16
driven 16
to 16
do 16
himself 16
a 16
hurt 16
before 16
he 16
should 16
have 16
the 16
opportunity 16
to 16
grant 16
a 16
free 16
pardon 16
but 16
before 16
he 16
could 16
come 16
to 16
the 16
east 16
news 16
had 16
come 16
to 16
cassius 16
that 16
the 16
emperor 16
still 16
lived 16
his 16
followers 16
fell 16
away 16
from 16
him 16
and 16
he 16
was 16
assassinated 16
marcus 16
now 16
went 16
to 16
the 16
east 16
and 16
while 16
there 16
the 16
murderers 16
brought 16
the 16
head 16
of 16
cassius 16
to 16
him 16
but 16
the 16
emperor 16
indignantly 16
refused 16
their 16
gift 16
nor 16
would 16
he 16
admit 16
the 16
men 16
to 16
his 16
presence 16
on 16
this 16
journey 16
his 16
wife 16
faustina 16
died 16
at 16
his 16
return 16
the 16
emperor 16
celebrated 16
a 16
triumph 16
immediately 16
afterwards 16
he 16
repaired 16
to 16
germany 16
and 16
took 16
up 16
once 16
more 16
the 16
burden 16
of 16
war 16
his 16
operations 16
were 16
followed 16
by 16
complete 16
success 16
but 16
the 16
troubles 16
of 16
late 16
years 16
had 16
been 16
too 16
much 16
for 16
his 16
constitution 16
at 16
no 16
time 16
robust 16
and 16
on 16
march 16
he 16
died 16
in 16
pannonia 16
the 16
good 16
emperor 16
was 16
not 16
spared 16
domestic 16
troubles 16
faustina 16
had 16
borne 16
him 16
several 16
children 16
of 16
whom 16
he 16
was 16
passionately 16
fond 16
their 16
innocent 16
faces 16
may 16
still 16
be 16
seen 16
in 16
many 16
a 16
sculpture 16
gallery 16
recalling 16
with 16
odd 16
effect 16
the 16
dreamy 16
countenance 16
of 16
their 16
father 16
but 16
they 16
died 16
one 16
by 16
one 16
and 16
when 16
marcus 16
came 16
to 16
his 16
own 16
end 16
only 16
one 16
of 16
his 16
sons 16
still 16
livedthe 16
weak 16
and 16
worthless 16
commodus 16
on 16
his 16
fathers 16
death 16
commodus 16
who 16
succeeded 16
him 16
undid 16
the 16
work 16
of 16
many 16
campaigns 16
by 16
a 16
hasty 16
and 16
unwise 16
peace 16
and 16
his 16
reign 16
of 16
twelve 16
years 16
proved 16
him 16
to 16
be 16
a 16
ferocious 16
and 16
bloodthirsty 16
tyrant 16
scandal 16
has 16
made 16
free 16
with 16
the 16
name 16
of 16
faustina 16
herself 16
who 16
is 16
accused 16
not 16
only 16
of 16
unfaithfulness 16
but 16
of 16
intriguing 16
with 16
cassius 16
and 16
egging 16
him 16
on 16
to 16
his 16
fatal 16
rebellion 16
it 16
must 16
be 16
admitted 16
that 16
these 16
charges 16
rest 16
on 16
no 16
sure 16
evidence 16
and 16
the 16
emperor 16
at 16
all 16
events 16
loved 16
her 16
dearly 16
nor 16
ever 16
felt 16
the 16
slightest 16
qualm 16
of 16
suspicion 16
as 16
a 16
soldier 16
we 16
have 16
seen 16
that 16
marcus 16
was 16
both 16
capable 16
and 16
successful 16
as 16
an 16
administrator 16
he 16
was 16
prudent 16
and 16
conscientious 16
although 16
steeped 16
in 16
the 16
teachings 16
of 16
philosophy 16
he 16
did 16
not 16
attempt 16
to 16
remodel 16
the 16
world 16
on 16
any 16
preconceived 16
plan 16
he 16
trod 16
the 16
path 16
beaten 16
by 16
his 16
predecessors 16
seeking 16
only 16
to 16
do 16
his 16
duty 16
as 16
well 16
as 16
he 16
could 16
and 16
to 16
keep 16
out 16
corruption 16
he 16
did 16
some 16
unwise 16
things 16
it 16
is 16
true 16
to 16
create 16
a 16
compeer 16
in 16
empire 16
as 16
he 16
did 16
with 16
verus 16
was 16
a 16
dangerous 16
innovation 16
which 16
could 16
only 16
succeed 16
if 16
one 16
of 16
the 16
two 16
effaced 16
himself 16
and 16
under 16
diocletian 16
this 16
very 16
precedent 16
caused 16
the 16
roman 16
empire 16
to 16
split 16
into 16
halves 16
he 16
erred 16
in 16
his 16
civil 16
administration 16
by 16
too 16
much 16
centralising 16
but 16
the 16
strong 16
point 16
of 16
his 16
reign 16
was 16
the 16
administration 16
of 16
justice 16
marcus 16
sought 16
bylaws 16
to 16
protect 16
the 16
weak 16
to 16
make 16
the 16
lot 16
of 16
the 16
slaves 16
less 16
hard 16
to 16
stand 16
in 16
place 16
of 16
father 16
to 16
the 16
fatherless 16
charitable 16
foundations 16
were 16
endowed 16
for 16
rearing 16
and 16
educating 16
poor 16
children 16
the 16
provinces 16
were 16
protected 16
against 16
oppression 16
and 16
public 16
help 16
was 16
given 16
to 16
cities 16
or 16
districts 16
which 16
might 16
be 16
visited 16
by 16
calamity 16
the 16
great 16
blot 16
on 16
his 16
name 16
and 16
one 16
hard 16
indeed 16
to 16
explain 16
is 16
his 16
treatment 16
of 16
the 16
christians 16
in 16
his 16
reign 16
justin 16
at 16
rome 16
became 16
a 16
martyr 16
to 16
his 16
faith 16
and 16
polycarp 16
at 16
smyrna 16
and 16
we 16
know 16
of 16
many 16
outbreaks 16
of 16
fanaticism 16
in 16
the 16
provinces 16
which 16
caused 16
the 16
death 16
of 16
the 16
faithful 16
it 16
is 16
no 16
excuse 16
to 16
plead 16
that 16
he 16
knew 16
nothing 16
about 16
the 16
atrocities 16
done 16
in 16
his 16
name 16
it 16
was 16
his 16
duty 16
to 16
know 16
and 16
if 16
he 16
did 16
not 16
he 16
would 16
have 16
been 16
the 16
first 16
to 16
confess 16
that 16
he 16
had 16
failed 16
in 16
his 16
duty 16
but 16
from 16
his 16
own 16
tone 16
in 16
speaking 16
of 16
the 16
christians 16
it 16
is 16
clear 16
he 16
knew 16
them 16
only 16
from 16
calumny 16
and 16
we 16
hear 16
of 16
no 16
measures 16
taken 16
even 16
to 16
secure 16
that 16
they 16
should 16
have 16
a 16
fair 16
hearing 16
in 16
this 16
respect 16
trajan 16
was 16
better 16
than 16
he 16
to 16
a 16
thoughtful 16
mind 16
such 16
a 16
religion 16
as 16
that 16
of 16
rome 16
would 16
give 16
small 16
satisfaction 16
its 16
legends 16
were 16
often 16
childish 16
or 16
impossible 16
its 16
teaching 16
had 16
little 16
to 16
do 16
with 16
morality 16
the 16
roman 16
religion 16
was 16
in 16
fact 16
of 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
a 16
bargain 16
men 16
paid 16
certain 16
sacrifices 16
and 16
rites 16
and 16
the 16
gods 16
granted 16
their 16
favour 16
irrespective 16
of 16
right 16
or 16
wrong 16
in 16
this 16
case 16
all 16
devout 16
souls 16
were 16
thrown 16
back 16
upon 16
philosophy 16
as 16
they 16
had 16
been 16
though 16
to 16
a 16
less 16
extent 16
in 16
greece 16
there 16
were 16
under 16
the 16
early 16
empire 16
two 16
rival 16
schools 16
which 16
practically 16
divided 16
the 16
field 16
between 16
them 16
stoicism 16
and 16
epicureanism 16
the 16
ideal 16
set 16
before 16
each 16
was 16
nominally 16
much 16
the 16
same 16
the 16
stoics 16
aspired 16
to 16
the 16
repression 16
of 16
all 16
emotion 16
and 16
the 16
epicureans 16
to 16
freedom 16
from 16
all 16
disturbance 16
yet 16
in 16
the 16
upshot 16
the 16
one 16
has 16
become 16
a 16
synonym 16
of 16
stubborn 16
endurance 16
the 16
other 16
for 16
unbridled 16
licence 16
with 16
epicureanism 16
we 16
have 16
nothing 16
to 16
do 16
now 16
but 16
it 16
will 16
be 16
worth 16
while 16
to 16
sketch 16
the 16
history 16
and 16
tenets 16
of 16
the 16
stoic 16
sect 16
zeno 16
the 16
founder 16
of 16
stoicism 16
was 16
born 16
in 16
cyprus 16
at 16
some 16
date 16
unknown 16
but 16
his 16
life 16
may 16
be 16
said 16
roughly 16
to 16
be 16
between 16
the 16
years 16
and 16
bc 16
cyprus 16
has 16
been 16
from 16
time 16
immemorial 16
a 16
meetingplace 16
of 16
the 16
east 16
and 16
west 16
and 16
although 16
we 16
cannot 16
grant 16
any 16
importance 16
to 16
a 16
possible 16
strain 16
of 16
phoenician 16
blood 16
in 16
him 16
for 16
the 16
phoenicians 16
were 16
no 16
philosophers 16
yet 16
it 16
is 16
quite 16
likely 16
that 16
through 16
asia 16
minor 16
he 16
may 16
have 16
come 16
in 16
touch 16
with 16
the 16
far 16
east 16
he 16
studied 16
under 16
the 16
cynic 16
crates 16
but 16
he 16
did 16
not 16
neglect 16
other 16
philosophical 16
systems 16
after 16
many 16
years 16
study 16
he 16
opened 16
his 16
own 16
school 16
in 16
a 16
colonnade 16
in 16
athens 16
called 16
the 16
painted 16
porch 16
or 16
stoa 16
which 16
gave 16
the 16
stoics 16
their 16
name 16
next 16
to 16
zeno 16
the 16
school 16
of 16
the 16
porch 16
owes 16
most 16
to 16
chrysippus 16
bc 16
who 16
organised 16
stoicism 16
into 16
a 16
system 16
of 16
him 16
it 16
was 16
said 16
but 16
for 16
chrysippus 16
there 16
had 16
been 16
no 16
porch 16
the 16
stoics 16
regarded 16
speculation 16
as 16
a 16
means 16
to 16
an 16
end 16
and 16
that 16
end 16
was 16

as 16

was 16

in 16
conformity 16

this 16
dictum 16
might 16
easily 16
be 16
taken 16
to 16
mean 16
that 16
virtue 16
consists 16
in 16
yielding 16
to 16
each 16
natural 16
impulse 16
but 16
that 16
was 16
very 16
far 16
from 16
the 16
stoic 16
meaning 16

the 16
knowledge 16
thus 16
gained 16
and 16
tested 16
to 16
practical 16
life 16
the 16
stoic 16
system 16
of 16
physics 16
was 16
materialism 16
with 16
an 16
infusion 16
of 16
pantheism 16
in 16
contradiction 16
to 16
platos 16
view 16
that 16
the 16
ideas 16
or 16
prototypes 16
of 16
phenomena 16
alone 16
really 16
exist 16
the 16
stoics 16
held 16
that 16
material 16
objects 16
alone 16
existed 16
but 16
immanent 16
in 16
the 16
material 16
universe 16
was 16
a 16
spiritual 16
force 16
which 16
acted 16
through 16
them 16
manifesting 16
itself 16
under 16
many 16
forms 16
as 16
fire 16

spirit 16
soul 16
reason 16
the 16
ruling 16
principle 16
the 16
universe 16
then 16
is 16
god 16
of 16
whom 16
the 16
popular 16
gods 16
are 16
manifestations 16
while 16
legends 16
and 16
myths 16
are 16
allegorical 16
the 16
soul 16
of 16
man 16
is 16
thus 16
an 16
emanation 16
from 16
the 16
godhead 16
into 16
whom 16
it 16
will 16
eventually 16
be 16
reabsorbed 16
the 16
divine 16
ruling 16
principle 16
makes 16
all 16
things 16
work 16
together 16
for 16
good 16
but 16
for 16
the 16
good 16
of 16
the 16
whole 16
the 16
highest 16
good 16
of 16
man 16
is 16
consciously 16
to 16
work 16
with 16
god 16
for 16
the 16
common 16
good 16
and 16
this 16
is 16
the 16
sense 16
in 16
which 16
the 16
stoic 16
tried 16
to 16
live 16
in 16
accord 16
with 16
nature 16
in 16
the 16
individual 16
it 16
is 16
virtue 16
alone 16
which 16
enables 16
him 16
to 16
do 16
this 16
as 16
providence 16
rules 16
the 16
universe 16
so 16
virtue 16
in 16
the 16
soul 16
must 16
rule 16
man 16
in 16
logic 16
the 16
stoic 16
system 16
is 16
noteworthy 16
for 16
their 16
theory 16
as 16
to 16
the 16
test 16
of 16
truth 16
the 16
criterion 16
they 16
compared 16
the 16
newborn 16
soul 16
to 16
a 16
sheet 16
of 16
paper 16
ready 16
for 16
writing 16
upon 16
this 16

impressions 16

by 16

a 16
number 16
of 16

when 16
the 16
impression 16
was 16
such 16
as 16
to 16
be 16
irresistible 16
it 16
was 16
called 16
katalnptikh 16
fantasia 16
one 16
that 16
holds 16
fast 16

as 16

explained 16
it 16
one 16
proceeding 16
from 16
truth 16
ideas 16
and 16
inferences 16
artificially 16
produced 16
by 16
deduction 16
or 16
the 16
like 16
were 16
tested 16
by 16
this 16
holding 16
perception 16
of 16
the 16
ethical 16
application 16
i 16
have 16
already 16
spoken 16
the 16
highest 16
good 16
was 16
the 16
virtuous 16
life 16
virtue 16
alone 16
is 16
happiness 16
and 16
vice 16
is 16
unhappiness 16
carrying 16
this 16
theory 16
to 16
its 16
extreme 16
the 16
stoic 16
said 16
that 16
there 16
could 16
be 16
no 16
gradations 16
between 16
virtue 16
and 16
vice 16
though 16
of 16
course 16
each 16
has 16
its 16
special 16
manifestations 16
moreover 16
nothing 16
is 16
good 16
but 16
virtue 16
and 16
nothing 16
but 16
vice 16
is 16
bad 16
those 16
outside 16
things 16
which 16
are 16
commonly 16
called 16
good 16
or 16
bad 16
such 16
as 16
health 16
and 16
sickness 16
wealth 16
and 16
poverty 16
pleasure 16
and 16
pain 16
are 16
to 16
him 16
indifferent 16
adiofora 16
all 16
these 16
things 16
are 16
merely 16
the 16
sphere 16
in 16
which 16
virtue 16
may 16
act 16
the 16
ideal 16
wise 16
man 16
is 16
sufficient 16
unto 16
himself 16
in 16
all 16
things 16
autarkhs 16
and 16
knowing 16
these 16
truths 16
he 16
will 16
be 16
happy 16
even 16
when 16
stretched 16
upon 16
the 16
rack 16
it 16
is 16
probable 16
that 16
no 16
stoic 16
claimed 16
for 16
himself 16
that 16
he 16
was 16
this 16
wise 16
man 16
but 16
that 16
each 16
strove 16
after 16
it 16
as 16
an 16
ideal 16
much 16
as 16
the 16
christian 16
strives 16
after 16
a 16
likeness 16
to 16
christ 16
the 16
exaggeration 16
in 16
this 16
statement 16
was 16
however 16
so 16
obvious 16
that 16
the 16
later 16
stoics 16
were 16
driven 16
to 16
make 16
a 16
further 16
subdivision 16
of 16
things 16
indifferent 16
into 16
what 16
is 16
preferable 16
prohgmena 16
and 16
what 16
is 16
undesirable 16
they 16
also 16
held 16
that 16
for 16
him 16
who 16
had 16
not 16
attained 16
to 16
the 16
perfect 16
wisdom 16
certain 16
actions 16
were 16
proper 16
kaqhkonta 16
these 16
were 16
neither 16
virtuous 16
nor 16
vicious 16
but 16
like 16
the 16
indifferent 16
things 16
held 16
a 16
middle 16
place 16
two 16
points 16
in 16
the 16
stoic 16
system 16
deserve 16
special 16
mention 16
one 16
is 16
a 16
careful 16
distinction 16
between 16
things 16
which 16
are 16
in 16
our 16
power 16
and 16
things 16
which 16
are 16
not 16
desire 16
and 16
dislike 16
opinion 16
and 16
affection 16
are 16
within 16
the 16
power 16
of 16
the 16
will 16
whereas 16
health 16
wealth 16
honour 16
and 16
other 16
such 16
are 16
generaly 16
not 16
so 16
the 16
stoic 16
was 16
called 16
upon 16
to 16
control 16
his 16
desires 16
and 16
affections 16
and 16
to 16
guide 16
his 16
opinion 16
to 16
bring 16
his 16
whole 16
being 16
under 16
the 16
sway 16
of 16
the 16
will 16
or 16
leading 16
principle 16
just 16
as 16
the 16
universe 16
is 16
guided 16
and 16
governed 16
by 16
divine 16
providence 16
this 16
is 16
a 16
special 16
application 16
of 16
the 16
favourite 16
greek 16
virtue 16
of 16
moderation 16
swfrosuum 16
and 16
has 16
also 16
its 16
parallel 16
in 16
christian 16
ethics 16
the 16
second 16
point 16
is 16
a 16
strong 16
insistence 16
on 16
the 16
unity 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
and 16
on 16
mans 16
duty 16
as 16
part 16
of 16
a 16
great 16
whole 16
public 16
spirit 16
was 16
the 16
most 16
splendid 16
political 16
virtue 16
of 16
the 16
ancient 16
world 16
and 16
it 16
is 16
here 16
made 16
cosmopolitan 16
it 16
is 16
again 16
instructive 16
to 16
note 16
that 16
christian 16
sages 16
insisted 16
on 16
the 16
same 16
thing 16
christians 16
are 16
taught 16
that 16
they 16
are 16
members 16
of 16
a 16
worldwide 16
brotherhood 16
where 16
is 16
neither 16
greek 16
nor 16
hebrew 16
bond 16
nor 16
free 16
and 16
that 16
they 16
live 16
their 16
lives 16
as 16
fellowworkers 16
with 16
god 16
such 16
is 16
the 16
system 16
which 16
underlies 16
the 16
meditations 16
of 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
some 16
knowledge 16
of 16
it 16
is 16
necessary 16
to 16
the 16
right 16
understanding 16
of 16
the 16
book 16
but 16
for 16
us 16
the 16
chief 16
interest 16
lies 16
elsewhere 16
we 16
do 16
not 16
come 16
to 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
for 16
a 16
treatise 16
on 16
stoicism 16
he 16
is 16
no 16
head 16
of 16
a 16
school 16
to 16
lay 16
down 16
a 16
body 16
of 16
doctrine 16
for 16
students 16
he 16
does 16
not 16
even 16
contemplate 16
that 16
others 16
should 16
read 16
what 16
he 16
writes 16
his 16
philosophy 16
is 16
not 16
an 16
eager 16
intellectual 16
inquiry 16
but 16
more 16
what 16
we 16
should 16
call 16
religious 16
feeling 16
the 16
uncompromising 16
stiffness 16
of 16
zeno 16
or 16
chrysippus 16
is 16
softened 16
and 16
transformed 16
by 16
passing 16
through 16
a 16
nature 16
reverent 16
and 16
tolerant 16
gentle 16
and 16
free 16
from 16
guile 16
the 16
grim 16
resignation 16
which 16
made 16
life 16
possible 16
to 16
the 16
stoic 16
sage 16
becomes 16
in 16
him 16
almost 16
a 16
mood 16
of 16
aspiration 16
his 16
book 16
records 16
the 16
innermost 16
thoughts 16
of 16
his 16
heart 16
set 16
down 16
to 16
ease 16
it 16
with 16
such 16
moral 16
maxims 16
and 16
reflections 16
as 16
may 16
help 16
him 16
to 16
bear 16
the 16
burden 16
of 16
duty 16
and 16
the 16
countless 16
annoyances 16
of 16
a 16
busy 16
life 16
it 16
is 16
instructive 16
to 16
compare 16
the 16
meditations 16
with 16
another 16
famous 16
book 16
the 16
imitation 16
of 16
christ 16
there 16
is 16
the 16
same 16
ideal 16
of 16
selfcontrol 16
in 16
both 16
it 16
should 16
be 16
a 16
mans 16
task 16
says 16
the 16
imitation 16
to 16
overcome 16
himself 16
and 16
every 16
day 16
to 16
be 16
stronger 16
than 16
himself 16
in 16
withstanding 16
of 16
the 16
passions 16
standeth 16
very 16
peace 16
of 16
heart 16
let 16
us 16
set 16
the 16
axe 16
to 16
the 16
root 16
that 16
we 16
being 16
purged 16
of 16
our 16
passions 16
may 16
have 16
a 16
peaceable 16
mind 16
to 16
this 16
end 16
there 16
must 16
be 16
continual 16
selfexamination 16
if 16
thou 16
may 16
not 16
continually 16
gather 16
thyself 16
together 16
namely 16
sometimes 16
do 16
it 16
at 16
least 16
once 16
a 16
day 16
the 16
morning 16
or 16
the 16
evening 16
in 16
the 16
morning 16
purpose 16
in 16
the 16
evening 16
discuss 16
the 16
manner 16
what 16
thou 16
hast 16
been 16
this 16
day 16
in 16
word 16
work 16
and 16
thought 16
but 16
while 16
the 16
romans 16
temper 16
is 16
a 16
modest 16
selfreliance 16
the 16
christian 16
aims 16
at 16
a 16
more 16
passive 16
mood 16
humbleness 16
and 16
meekness 16
and 16
reliance 16
on 16
the 16
presence 16
and 16
personal 16
friendship 16
of 16
god 16
the 16
roman 16
scrutinises 16
his 16
faults 16
with 16
severity 16
but 16
without 16
the 16
selfcontempt 16
which 16
makes 16
the 16
christian 16
vile 16
in 16
his 16
own 16
sight 16
the 16
christian 16
like 16
the 16
roman 16
bids 16
study 16
to 16
withdraw 16
thine 16
heart 16
from 16
the 16
love 16
of 16
things 16
visible 16
but 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
the 16
busy 16
life 16
of 16
duty 16
he 16
has 16
in 16
mind 16
so 16
much 16
as 16
the 16
contempt 16
of 16
all 16
worldly 16
things 16
and 16
the 16
cutting 16
away 16
of 16
all 16
lower 16
delectations 16
both 16
rate 16
mens 16
praise 16
or 16
blame 16
at 16
their 16
real 16
worthlessness 16
let 16
not 16
thy 16
peace 16
says 16
the 16
christian 16
be 16
in 16
the 16
mouths 16
of 16
men 16
but 16
it 16
is 16
to 16
gods 16
censure 16
the 16
christian 16
appeals 16
the 16
roman 16
to 16
his 16
own 16
soul 16
the 16
petty 16
annoyances 16
of 16
injustice 16
or 16
unkindness 16
are 16
looked 16
on 16
by 16
each 16
with 16
the 16
same 16
magnanimity 16
why 16
doth 16
a 16
little 16
thing 16
said 16
or 16
done 16
against 16
thee 16
make 16
thee 16
sorry 16
it 16
is 16
no 16
new 16
thing 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
the 16
first 16
nor 16
shall 16
it 16
be 16
the 16
last 16
if 16
thou 16
live 16
long 16
at 16
best 16
suffer 16
patiently 16
if 16
thou 16
canst 16
not 16
suffer 16
joyously 16
the 16
christian 16
should 16
sorrow 16
more 16
for 16
other 16
mens 16
malice 16
than 16
for 16
our 16
own 16
wrongs 16
but 16
the 16
roman 16
is 16
inclined 16
to 16
wash 16
his 16
hands 16
of 16
the 16
offender 16
study 16
to 16
be 16
patient 16
in 16
suffering 16
and 16
bearing 16
other 16
mens 16
defaults 16
and 16
all 16
manner 16
infirmities 16
says 16
the 16
christian 16
but 16
the 16
roman 16
would 16
never 16
have 16
thought 16
to 16
add 16
if 16
all 16
men 16
were 16
perfect 16
what 16
had 16
we 16
then 16
to 16
suffer 16
of 16
other 16
men 16
for 16
god 16
the 16
virtue 16
of 16
suffering 16
in 16
itself 16
is 16
an 16
idea 16
which 16
does 16
not 16
meet 16
us 16
in 16
the 16
meditations 16
both 16
alike 16
realise 16
that 16
man 16
is 16
one 16
of 16
a 16
great 16
community 16
no 16
man 16
is 16
sufficient 16
to 16
himself 16
says 16
the 16
christian 16
we 16
must 16
bear 16
together 16
help 16
together 16
comfort 16
together 16
but 16
while 16
he 16
sees 16
a 16
chief 16
importance 16
in 16
zeal 16
in 16
exalted 16
emotion 16
that 16
is 16
and 16
avoidance 16
of 16
lukewarmness 16
the 16
roman 16
thought 16
mainly 16
of 16
the 16
duty 16
to 16
be 16
done 16
as 16
well 16
as 16
might 16
be 16
and 16
less 16
of 16
the 16
feeling 16
which 16
should 16
go 16
with 16
the 16
doing 16
of 16
it 16
to 16
the 16
saint 16
as 16
to 16
the 16
emperor 16
the 16
world 16
is 16
a 16
poor 16
thing 16
at 16
best 16
verily 16
it 16
is 16
a 16
misery 16
to 16
live 16
upon 16
the 16
earth 16
says 16
the 16
christian 16
few 16
and 16
evil 16
are 16
the 16
days 16
of 16
mans 16
life 16
which 16
passeth 16
away 16
suddenly 16
as 16
a 16
shadow 16
but 16
there 16
is 16
one 16
great 16
difference 16
between 16
the 16
two 16
books 16
we 16
are 16
considering 16
the 16
imitation 16
is 16
addressed 16
to 16
others 16
the 16
meditations 16
by 16
the 16
writer 16
to 16
himself 16
we 16
learn 16
nothing 16
from 16
the 16
imitation 16
of 16
the 16
authors 16
own 16
life 16
except 16
in 16
so 16
far 16
as 16
he 16
may 16
be 16
assumed 16
to 16
have 16
practised 16
his 16
own 16
preachings 16
the 16
meditations 16
reflect 16
mood 16
by 16
mood 16
the 16
mind 16
of 16
him 16
who 16
wrote 16
them 16
in 16
their 16
intimacy 16
and 16
frankness 16
lies 16
their 16
great 16
charm 16
these 16
notes 16
are 16
not 16
sermons 16
they 16
are 16
not 16
even 16
confessions 16
there 16
is 16
always 16
an 16
air 16
of 16
selfconsciousness 16
in 16
confessions 16
in 16
such 16
revelations 16
there 16
is 16
always 16
a 16
danger 16
of 16
unctuousness 16
or 16
of 16
vulgarity 16
for 16
the 16
best 16
of 16
men 16
st 16
augustine 16
is 16
not 16
always 16
clear 16
of 16
offence 16
and 16
john 16
bunyan 16
himself 16
exaggerates 16
venial 16
peccadilloes 16
into 16
heinous 16
sins 16
but 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
is 16
neither 16
vulgar 16
nor 16
unctuous 16
he 16
extenuates 16
nothing 16
but 16
nothing 16
sets 16
down 16
in 16
malice 16
he 16
never 16
poses 16
before 16
an 16
audience 16
he 16
may 16
not 16
be 16
profound 16
he 16
is 16
always 16
sincere 16
and 16
it 16
is 16
a 16
lofty 16
and 16
serene 16
soul 16
which 16
is 16
here 16
disclosed 16
before 16
us 16
vulgar 16
vices 16
seem 16
to 16
have 16
no 16
temptation 16
for 16
him 16
this 16
is 16
not 16
one 16
tied 16
and 16
bound 16
with 16
chains 16
which 16
he 16
strives 16
to 16
break 16
the 16
faults 16
he 16
detects 16
in 16
himself 16
are 16
often 16
such 16
as 16
most 16
men 16
would 16
have 16
no 16
eyes 16
to 16
see 16
to 16
serve 16
the 16
divine 16
spirit 16
which 16
is 16
implanted 16
within 16
him 16
a 16
man 16
must 16
keep 16
himself 16
pure 16
from 16
all 16
violent 16
passion 16
and 16
evil 16
affection 16
from 16
all 16
rashness 16
and 16
vanity 16
and 16
from 16
all 16
manner 16
of 16
discontent 16
either 16
in 16
regard 16
of 16
the 16
gods 16
or 16
men 16
or 16
as 16
he 16
says 16
elsewhere 16
unspotted 16
by 16
pleasure 16
undaunted 16
by 16
pain 16
unwavering 16
courtesy 16
and 16
consideration 16
are 16
his 16
aims 16
whatsoever 16
any 16
man 16
either 16
doth 16
or 16
saith 16
thou 16
must 16
be 16
good 16
doth 16
any 16
man 16
offend 16
it 16
is 16
against 16
himself 16
that 16
he 16
doth 16
offend 16
why 16
should 16
it 16
trouble 16
thee 16
the 16
offender 16
needs 16
pity 16
not 16
wrath 16
those 16
who 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
corrected 16
should 16
be 16
treated 16
with 16
tact 16
and 16
gentleness 16
and 16
one 16
must 16
be 16
always 16
ready 16
to 16
learn 16
better 16
the 16
best 16
kind 16
of 16
revenge 16
is 16
not 16
to 16
become 16
like 16
unto 16
them 16
there 16
are 16
so 16
many 16
hints 16
of 16
offence 16
forgiven 16
that 16
we 16
may 16
believe 16
the 16
notes 16
followed 16
sharp 16
on 16
the 16
facts 16
perhaps 16
he 16
has 16
fallen 16
short 16
of 16
his 16
aim 16
and 16
thus 16
seeks 16
to 16
call 16
his 16
principles 16
to 16
mind 16
and 16
to 16
strengthen 16
himself 16
for 16
the 16
future 16
that 16
these 16
sayings 16
are 16
not 16
mere 16
talk 16
is 16
plain 16
from 16
the 16
story 16
of 16
avidius 16
cassius 16
who 16
would 16
have 16
usurped 16
his 16
imperial 16
throne 16
thus 16
the 16
emperor 16
faithfully 16
carries 16
out 16
his 16
own 16
principle 16
that 16
evil 16
must 16
be 16
overcome 16
with 16
good 16
for 16
each 16
fault 16
in 16
others 16
nature 16
says 16
he 16
has 16
given 16
us 16
a 16
counteracting 16
virtue 16
as 16
for 16
example 16
against 16
the 16
unthankful 16
it 16
hath 16
given 16
goodness 16
and 16
meekness 16
as 16
an 16
antidote 16
one 16
so 16
gentle 16
towards 16
a 16
foe 16
was 16
sure 16
to 16
be 16
a 16
good 16
friend 16
and 16
indeed 16
his 16
pages 16
are 16
full 16
of 16
generous 16
gratitude 16
to 16
those 16
who 16
had 16
served 16
him 16
in 16
his 16
first 16
book 16
he 16
sets 16
down 16
to 16
account 16
all 16
the 16
debts 16
due 16
to 16
his 16
kinsfolk 16
and 16
teachers 16
to 16
his 16
grandfather 16
he 16
owed 16
his 16
own 16
gentle 16
spirit 16
to 16
his 16
father 16
shamefastness 16
and 16
courage 16
he 16
learnt 16
of 16
his 16
mother 16
to 16
be 16
religious 16
and 16
bountiful 16
and 16
singleminded 16
rusticus 16
did 16
not 16
work 16
in 16
vain 16
if 16
he 16
showed 16
his 16
pupil 16
that 16
his 16
life 16
needed 16
amending 16
apollonius 16
taught 16
him 16
simplicity 16
reasonableness 16
gratitude 16
a 16
love 16
of 16
true 16
liberty 16
so 16
the 16
list 16
runs 16
on 16
every 16
one 16
he 16
had 16
dealings 16
with 16
seems 16
to 16
have 16
given 16
him 16
something 16
good 16
a 16
sure 16
proof 16
of 16
the 16
goodness 16
of 16
his 16
nature 16
which 16
thought 16
no 16
evil 16
if 16
his 16
was 16
that 16
honest 16
and 16
true 16
heart 16
which 16
is 16
the 16
christian 16
ideal 16
this 16
is 16
the 16
more 16
wonderful 16
in 16
that 16
he 16
lacked 16
the 16
faith 16
which 16
makes 16
christians 16
strong 16
he 16
could 16
say 16
it 16
is 16
true 16
either 16
there 16
is 16
a 16
god 16
and 16
then 16
all 16
is 16
well 16
or 16
if 16
all 16
things 16
go 16
by 16
chance 16
and 16
fortune 16
yet 16
mayest 16
thou 16
use 16
thine 16
own 16
providence 16
in 16
those 16
things 16
that 16
concern 16
thee 16
properly 16
and 16
then 16
art 16
thou 16
well 16
or 16
again 16
we 16
must 16
needs 16
grant 16
that 16
there 16
is 16
a 16
nature 16
that 16
doth 16
govern 16
the 16
universe 16
but 16
his 16
own 16
part 16
in 16
the 16
scheme 16
of 16
things 16
is 16
so 16
small 16
that 16
he 16
does 16
not 16
hope 16
for 16
any 16
personal 16
happiness 16
beyond 16
what 16
a 16
serene 16
soul 16
may 16
win 16
in 16
this 16
mortal 16
life 16
my 16
soul 16
the 16
time 16
i 16
trust 16
will 16
be 16
when 16
thou 16
shalt 16
be 16
good 16
simple 16
more 16
open 16
and 16
visible 16
than 16
that 16
body 16
by 16
which 16
it 16
is 16
enclosed 16
but 16
this 16
is 16
said 16
of 16
the 16
calm 16
contentment 16
with 16
human 16
lot 16
which 16
he 16
hopes 16
to 16
attain 16
not 16
of 16
a 16
time 16
when 16
the 16
trammels 16
of 16
the 16
body 16
shall 16
be 16
cast 16
off 16
for 16
the 16
rest 16
the 16
world 16
and 16
its 16
fame 16
and 16
wealth 16
all 16
is 16
vanity 16
the 16
gods 16
may 16
perhaps 16
have 16
a 16
particular 16
care 16
for 16
him 16
but 16
their 16
especial 16
care 16
is 16
for 16
the 16
universe 16
at 16
large 16
thus 16
much 16
should 16
suffice 16
his 16
gods 16
are 16
better 16
than 16
the 16
stoic 16
gods 16
who 16
sit 16
aloof 16
from 16
all 16
human 16
things 16
untroubled 16
and 16
uncaring 16
but 16
his 16
personal 16
hope 16
is 16
hardly 16
stronger 16
on 16
this 16
point 16
he 16
says 16
little 16
though 16
there 16
are 16
many 16
allusions 16
to 16
death 16
as 16
the 16
natural 16
end 16
doubtless 16
he 16
expected 16
his 16
soul 16
one 16
day 16
to 16
be 16
absorbed 16
into 16
the 16
universal 16
soul 16
since 16
nothing 16
comes 16
out 16
of 16
nothing 16
and 16
nothing 16
can 16
be 16
annihilated 16
his 16
mood 16
is 16
one 16
of 16
strenuous 16
weariness 16
he 16
does 16
his 16
duty 16
as 16
a 16
good 16
soldier 16
waiting 16
for 16
the 16
sound 16
of 16
the 16
trumpet 16
which 16
shall 16
sound 16
the 16
retreat 16
he 16
has 16
not 16
that 16
cheerful 16
confidence 16
which 16
led 16
socrates 16
through 16
a 16
life 16
no 16
less 16
noble 16
to 16
a 16
death 16
which 16
was 16
to 16
bring 16
him 16
into 16
the 16
company 16
of 16
gods 16
he 16
had 16
worshipped 16
and 16
men 16
whom 16
he 16
had 16
revered 16
but 16
although 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
may 16
have 16
held 16
intellectually 16
that 16
his 16
soul 16
was 16
destined 16
to 16
be 16
absorbed 16
and 16
to 16
lose 16
consciousness 16
of 16
itself 16
there 16
were 16
times 16
when 16
he 16
felt 16
as 16
all 16
who 16
hold 16
it 16
must 16
sometimes 16
feel 16
how 16
unsatisfying 16
is 16
such 16
a 16
creed 16
then 16
he 16
gropes 16
blindly 16
after 16
something 16
less 16
empty 16
and 16
vain 16
thou 16
hast 16
taken 16
ship 16
he 16
says 16
thou 16
hast 16
sailed 16
thou 16
art 16
come 16
to 16
land 16
go 16
out 16
if 16
to 16
another 16
life 16
there 16
also 16
shalt 16
thou 16
find 16
gods 16
who 16
are 16
everywhere 16
there 16
is 16
more 16
in 16
this 16
than 16
the 16
assumption 16
of 16
a 16
rival 16
theory 16
for 16
arguments 16
sake 16
if 16
worldly 16
things 16
be 16
but 16
as 16
a 16
dream 16
the 16
thought 16
is 16
not 16
far 16
off 16
that 16
there 16
may 16
be 16
an 16
awakening 16
to 16
what 16
is 16
real 16
when 16
he 16
speaks 16
of 16
death 16
as 16
a 16
necessary 16
change 16
and 16
points 16
out 16
that 16
nothing 16
useful 16
and 16
profitable 16
can 16
be 16
brought 16
about 16
without 16
change 16
did 16
he 16
perhaps 16
think 16
of 16
the 16
change 16
in 16
a 16
corn 16
of 16
wheat 16
which 16
is 16
not 16
quickened 16
except 16
it 16
die 16
natures 16
marvellous 16
power 16
of 16
recreating 16
out 16
of 16
corruption 16
is 16
surely 16
not 16
confined 16
to 16
bodily 16
things 16
many 16
of 16
his 16
thoughts 16
sound 16
like 16
faroff 16
echoes 16
of 16
st 16
paul 16
and 16
it 16
is 16
strange 16
indeed 16
that 16
this 16
most 16
christian 16
of 16
emperors 16
has 16
nothing 16
good 16
to 16
say 16
of 16
the 16
christians 16
to 16
him 16
they 16
are 16
only 16
sectaries 16
violently 16
and 16
passionately 16
set 16
upon 16
opposition 16
profound 16
as 16
philosophy 16
these 16
meditations 16
certainly 16
are 16
not 16
but 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
was 16
too 16
sincere 16
not 16
to 16
see 16
the 16
essence 16
of 16
such 16
things 16
as 16
came 16
within 16
his 16
experience 16
ancient 16
religions 16
were 16
for 16
the 16
most 16
part 16
concerned 16
with 16
outward 16
things 16
do 16
the 16
necessary 16
rites 16
and 16
you 16
propitiate 16
the 16
gods 16
and 16
these 16
rites 16
were 16
often 16
trivial 16
sometimes 16
violated 16
right 16
feeling 16
or 16
even 16
morality 16
even 16
when 16
the 16
gods 16
stood 16
on 16
the 16
side 16
of 16
righteousness 16
they 16
were 16
concerned 16
with 16
the 16
act 16
more 16
than 16
with 16
the 16
intent 16
but 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
knows 16
that 16
what 16
the 16
heart 16
is 16
full 16
of 16
the 16
man 16
will 16
do 16
such 16
as 16
thy 16
thoughts 16
and 16
ordinary 16
cogitations 16
are 16
he 16
says 16
such 16
will 16
thy 16
mind 16
be 16
in 16
time 16
and 16
every 16
page 16
of 16
the 16
book 16
shows 16
us 16
that 16
he 16
knew 16
thought 16
was 16
sure 16
to 16
issue 16
in 16
act 16
he 16
drills 16
his 16
soul 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
in 16
right 16
principles 16
that 16
when 16
the 16
time 16
comes 16
it 16
may 16
be 16
guided 16
by 16
them 16
to 16
wait 16
until 16
the 16
emergency 16
is 16
to 16
be 16
too 16
late 16
he 16
sees 16
also 16
the 16
true 16
essence 16
of 16
happiness 16
if 16
happiness 16
did 16
consist 16
in 16
pleasure 16
how 16
came 16
notorious 16
robbers 16
impure 16
abominable 16
livers 16
parricides 16
and 16
tyrants 16
in 16
so 16
large 16
a 16
measure 16
to 16
have 16
their 16
part 16
of 16
pleasures 16
he 16
who 16
had 16
all 16
the 16
worlds 16
pleasures 16
at 16
command 16
can 16
write 16
thus 16
a 16
happy 16
lot 16
and 16
portion 16
is 16
good 16
inclinations 16
of 16
the 16
soul 16
good 16
desires 16
good 16
actions 16
by 16
the 16
irony 16
of 16
fate 16
this 16
man 16
so 16
gentle 16
and 16
good 16
so 16
desirous 16
of 16
quiet 16
joys 16
and 16
a 16
mind 16
free 16
from 16
care 16
was 16
set 16
at 16
the 16
head 16
of 16
the 16
roman 16
empire 16
when 16
great 16
dangers 16
threatened 16
from 16
east 16
and 16
west 16
for 16
several 16
years 16
he 16
himself 16
commanded 16
his 16
armies 16
in 16
chief 16
in 16
camp 16
before 16
the 16
quadi 16
he 16
dates 16
the 16
first 16
book 16
of 16
his 16
meditations 16
and 16
shows 16
how 16
he 16
could 16
retire 16
within 16
himself 16
amid 16
the 16
coarse 16
clangour 16
of 16
arms 16
the 16
pomps 16
and 16
glories 16
which 16
he 16
despised 16
were 16
all 16
his 16
what 16
to 16
most 16
men 16
is 16
an 16
ambition 16
or 16
a 16
dream 16
to 16
him 16
was 16
a 16
round 16
of 16
weary 16
tasks 16
which 16
nothing 16
but 16
the 16
stern 16
sense 16
of 16
duty 16
could 16
carry 16
him 16
through 16
and 16
he 16
did 16
his 16
work 16
well 16
his 16
wars 16
were 16
slow 16
and 16
tedious 16
but 16
successful 16
with 16
a 16
statesmans 16
wisdom 16
he 16
foresaw 16
the 16
danger 16
to 16
rome 16
of 16
the 16
barbarian 16
hordes 16
from 16
the 16
north 16
and 16
took 16
measures 16
to 16
meet 16
it 16
as 16
it 16
was 16
his 16
settlement 16
gave 16
two 16
centuries 16
of 16
respite 16
to 16
the 16
roman 16
empire 16
had 16
he 16
fulfilled 16
the 16
plan 16
of 16
pushing 16
the 16
imperial 16
frontiers 16
to 16
the 16
elbe 16
which 16
seems 16
to 16
have 16
been 16
in 16
his 16
mind 16
much 16
more 16
might 16
have 16
been 16
accomplished 16
but 16
death 16
cut 16
short 16
his 16
designs 16
truly 16
a 16
rare 16
opportunity 16
was 16
given 16
to 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
of 16
showing 16
what 16
the 16
mind 16
can 16
do 16
in 16
despite 16
of 16
circumstances 16
most 16
peaceful 16
of 16
warriors 16
a 16
magnificent 16
monarch 16
whose 16
ideal 16
was 16
quiet 16
happiness 16
in 16
home 16
life 16
bent 16
to 16
obscurity 16
yet 16
born 16
to 16
greatness 16
the 16
loving 16

that 16
i 16
did 16
write 16

who 16
profess 16
philosophy 16
iv 16
to 16
rusticus 16
i 16
am 16
beholding 16
that 16
i 16
first 16
entered 16
into 16
the 16
conceit 16
that 16
my 16
life 16
wanted 16
some 16
redress 16
and 16
cure 16
and 16
then 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
fall 16
into 16
the 16
ambition 16
of 16
ordinary 16
sophists 16
either 16
to 16
write 16
tracts 16
concerning 16

to 16
exhort 16

study 16

orations 16

also 16
that 16
i 16
never 16
by 16
way 16
of 16
ostentation 16
did 16
affect 16
to 16

myself 16

active 16
able 16
man 16
for 16
any 16
kind 16
of 16
bodily 16
exercises 16
and 16
that 16
i 16
gave 16
over 16
the 16
study 16
of 16
rhetoric 16
and 16
poetry 16
and 16
of 16
elegant 16
neat 16
language 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
use 16
to 16
walk 16
about 16
the 16
house 16
in 16
my 16
long 16
robe 16
nor 16
to 16
do 16
any 16
such 16
things 16

any 16
affectation 16

as 16
that 16
was 16
which 16

him 16

to 16

easy 16

ready 16
to 16
be 16
reconciled 16

well 16
pleased 16
again 16

them 16
that 16
had 16
offended 16
me 16

soon 16
as 16
any 16
of 16
them 16
would 16
be 16
content 16
to 16
seek 16

me 16

to 16
rest 16
satisfied 16

a 16
light 16

superficial 16
knowledge 16

quickly 16
to 16
assent 16
to 16
things 16
commonly 16
spoken 16
of 16
whom 16
also 16
i 16
must 16
thank 16
that 16
ever 16
i 16
lighted 16
upon 16
epictetus 16
his 16
hypomnemata 16
or 16
moral 16
commentaries 16
and 16
commonefactions 16
which 16
also 16
he 16
gave 16
me 16
of 16
his 16
own 16
v 16
from 16
apollonius 16
true 16
liberty 16

unvariable 16
steadfastness 16
and 16
not 16
to 16
regard 16
anything 16
at 16
all 16
though 16
never 16
so 16
little 16
but 16
right 16
and 16
reason 16
and 16
always 16
whether 16
in 16
the 16
sharpest 16
pains 16

after 16
the 16
loss 16
of 16
a 16
child 16
or 16
in 16
long 16
diseases 16
to 16
be 16
still 16
the 16
same 16
man 16
who 16
also 16
was 16
a 16
present 16
and 16
visible 16
example 16
unto 16
me 16
that 16
it 16
was 16
possible 16
for 16
the 16
same 16
man 16
to 16
be 16
both 16
vehement 16
and 16
remiss 16
a 16
man 16
not 16
subject 16
to 16
be 16
vexed 16
and 16
offended 16
with 16
the 16
incapacity 16
of 16
his 16
scholars 16
and 16
auditors 16
in 16
his 16
lectures 16
and 16
expositions 16
and 16
a 16
true 16
pattern 16
of 16
a 16
man 16
who 16
of 16
all 16
his 16
good 16
gifts 16
and 16
faculties 16
least 16
esteemed 16
in 16
himself 16
that 16
his 16
excellent 16
skill 16
and 16
ability 16
to 16
teach 16
and 16
persuade 16
others 16
the 16
common 16
theorems 16

maxims 16
of 16
the 16
stoic 16
philosophy 16
of 16
him 16
also 16
i 16
learned 16
how 16
to 16
receive 16
favours 16
and 16
kindnesses 16
as 16
commonly 16
they 16
are 16
accounted 16
from 16
friends 16
so 16
that 16
i 16
might 16
not 16
become 16
obnoxious 16
unto 16
them 16
for 16
them 16
nor 16
more 16
yielding 16
upon 16
occasion 16
than 16
in 16
right 16
i 16
ought 16
and 16
yet 16
so 16
that 16
i 16
should 16
not 16
pass 16
them 16
neither 16
as 16
an 16
unsensible 16
and 16
unthankful 16
man 16
vi 16
of 16
sextus 16
mildness 16

the 16

a 16
purpose 16

observe 16
carefully 16
the 16

my 16
friends 16

be 16
offended 16
with 16

unseasonably 16
to 16

upon 16
those 16
that 16

carried 16
with 16
the 16
vulgar 16
opinions 16

the 16
theorems 16

tenets 16

conversation 16

an 16
example 16
how 16
a 16
man 16
might 16
accommodate 16
himself 16
to 16
all 16
men 16
and 16
companies 16
so 16
that 16
though 16
his 16
company 16
were 16
sweeter 16

more 16
pleasing 16
than 16
any 16

fawning 16

he 16
would 16
yield 16
to 16
any 16
that 16
had 16
obtained 16
any 16
peculiar 16
faculty 16
as 16
either 16
eloquence 16
or 16
the 16
knowledge 16
of 16
the 16
laws 16
or 16
of 16
ancient 16
customs 16
or 16
the 16
like 16
and 16
how 16
he 16
concurred 16
with 16
them 16
in 16
his 16
best 16
care 16
and 16
endeavour 16
that 16
every 16
one 16
of 16
them 16
might 16
in 16
his 16
kind 16
for 16
that 16
wherein 16
he 16
excelled 16
be 16
regarded 16
and 16
esteemed 16
and 16
although 16
he 16
did 16
all 16
things 16
carefully 16
after 16
the 16
ancient 16
customs 16
of 16
his 16
forefathers 16
yet 16
even 16
of 16
this 16
was 16
he 16
not 16
desirous 16
that 16
men 16
should 16
take 16
notice 16
that 16
he 16
did 16
imitate 16
ancient 16
customs 16
again 16
how 16
he 16
was 16
not 16
easily 16
moved 16
and 16
tossed 16
up 16
and 16
down 16
but 16
loved 16
to 16
be 16
constant 16
both 16
in 16
the 16
same 16
places 16
and 16
businesses 16
and 16
how 16
after 16
his 16
great 16
fits 16
of 16
headache 16
he 16
would 16
return 16
fresh 16
and 16
vigorous 16
to 16
his 16
wonted 16
affairs 16
again 16
that 16
secrets 16
he 16
neither 16
had 16
many 16
nor 16
often 16
and 16
such 16
only 16
as 16
concerned 16
public 16
matters 16
his 16
discretion 16
and 16
moderation 16
in 16
exhibiting 16
of 16
the 16
public 16
sights 16
and 16
shows 16
for 16
the 16
pleasure 16
and 16
pastime 16
of 16
the 16
people 16
in 16
public 16
buildings 16
congiaries 16
and 16
the 16
like 16
in 16
all 16
these 16
things 16
having 16
a 16
respect 16
unto 16
men 16
only 16
as 16
men 16
and 16
to 16
the 16
equity 16
of 16
the 16

themselves 16

not 16

the 16

never 16

the 16

at 16
unseasonable 16
hours 16
no 16

never 16
curious 16

solicitous 16
either 16
about 16

about 16
the 16

about 16
anything 16
that 16
belonged 16
to 16
external 16
beauty 16
in 16
all 16
his 16
conversation 16
far 16
from 16
all 16
inhumanity 16
all 16
boldness 16
and 16
incivility 16
all 16
greediness 16

impetuosity 16
never 16
doing 16
anything 16
with 16
such 16
earnestness 16
and 16
intention 16
that 16
a 16
man 16
could 16
say 16
of 16
him 16
that 16
he 16
did 16
sweat 16
about 16
it 16
but 16
contrariwise 16
all 16
things 16
distinctly 16
as 16
at 16
leisure 16
without 16
trouble 16
orderly 16
soundly 16
and 16
agreeably 16
a 16
man 16
might 16
have 16
applied 16
that 16
to 16
him 16
which 16
is 16
recorded 16
of 16
socrates 16
that 16
he 16
knew 16
how 16
to 16
want 16
and 16
to 16
enjoy 16
those 16
things 16
in 16
the 16
want 16
whereof 16
most 16
men 16
show 16
themselves 16
weak 16
and 16
in 16
the 16
fruition 16
intemperate 16
but 16
to 16
hold 16
out 16
firm 16
and 16
constant 16
and 16
to 16
keep 16
within 16
the 16
compass 16
of 16
true 16
moderation 16
and 16
sobriety 16
in 16
either 16
estate 16
is 16
proper 16
to 16
a 16
man 16
who 16
hath 16
a 16
perfect 16
and 16
invincible 16
soul 16
such 16
as 16
he 16
showed 16
himself 16
in 16
the 16
sickness 16
of 16
maximus 16
xiv 16
from 16
the 16
gods 16
i 16
received 16
that 16
i 16
had 16
good 16
grandfathers 16
and 16
parents 16
a 16
good 16
sister 16
good 16
masters 16
good 16
domestics 16
loving 16
kinsmen 16
almost 16
all 16
that 16
i 16
have 16
and 16
that 16
i 16
never 16
through 16
haste 16
and 16
rashness 16
transgressed 16
against 16
any 16
of 16
them 16
notwithstanding 16
that 16
my 16
disposition 16
was 16
such 16
as 16
that 16
such 16
a 16
thing 16
if 16
occasion 16
had 16
been 16
might 16
very 16
well 16
have 16
been 16
committed 16
by 16
me 16
but 16
that 16
it 16
was 16
the 16
mercy 16
of 16
the 16
gods 16
to 16
prevent 16
such 16
a 16
concurring 16
of 16
matters 16
and 16
occasions 16
as 16
might 16
make 16
me 16
to 16
incur 16
this 16
blame 16
that 16
i 16
was 16
not 16
long 16
brought 16
up 16
by 16
the 16
concubine 16
of 16
my 16
father 16
that 16
i 16
preserved 16
the 16
flower 16
of 16
my 16
youth 16
that 16
i 16
took 16
not 16
upon 16
me 16
to 16
be 16
a 16
man 16
before 16
my 16
time 16
but 16
rather 16
put 16
it 16
off 16
longer 16
than 16
i 16
needed 16
that 16
i 16
lived 16
under 16
the 16
government 16
of 16
my 16
lord 16
and 16
father 16
who 16
would 16
take 16
away 16
from 16
me 16
all 16
pride 16
and 16
vainglory 16
and 16
reduce 16
me 16
to 16
that 16
conceit 16
and 16
opinion 16
that 16
it 16
was 16
not 16
impossible 16
for 16
a 16
prince 16
to 16
live 16
in 16
the 16
court 16
without 16
a 16
troop 16
of 16
guards 16
and 16
followers 16
extraordinary 16
apparel 16
such 16
and 16
such 16
torches 16
and 16
statues 16
and 16
other 16
like 16
particulars 16
of 16
state 16
and 16
magnificence 16
but 16
that 16
a 16
man 16
may 16
reduce 16
and 16
contract 16
himself 16
almost 16
to 16
the 16
state 16
of 16
a 16
private 16
man 16
and 16
yet 16
for 16
all 16
that 16
not 16
to 16
become 16
the 16
more 16
base 16
and 16
remiss 16
in 16
those 16
public 16
matters 16
and 16
affairs 16
wherein 16
power 16
and 16
authority 16
is 16
requisite 16
that 16
i 16
have 16
had 16
such 16
a 16
brother 16
who 16
by 16
his 16
own 16
example 16
might 16
stir 16
me 16
up 16
to 16
think 16
of 16
myself 16
and 16
by 16
his 16
respect 16
and 16
love 16
delight 16
and 16
please 16
me 16
that 16
i 16
have 16
got 16
ingenuous 16
children 16
and 16
that 16
they 16
were 16
not 16
born 16
distorted 16
nor 16
with 16
any 16
other 16
natural 16
deformity 16
that 16
i 16
was 16
no 16
great 16
proficient 16
in 16
the 16
study 16
of 16
rhetoric 16
and 16
poetry 16
and 16
of 16
other 16
faculties 16
which 16
perchance 16
i 16
might 16
have 16
dwelt 16
upon 16
if 16
i 16
had 16
found 16
myself 16
to 16
go 16
on 16
in 16
them 16
with 16
success 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
by 16
times 16
prefer 16
those 16
by 16
whom 16
i 16
was 16
brought 16
up 16
to 16
such 16
places 16
and 16
dignities 16
which 16
they 16
seemed 16
unto 16
me 16
most 16
to 16
desire 16
and 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
put 16
them 16
off 16
with 16
hope 16
and 16
expectation 16
that 16
since 16
that 16
they 16
were 16
yet 16
but 16
young 16
i 16
would 16
do 16
the 16
same 16
hereafter 16
that 16
i 16
ever 16
knew 16
apollonius 16
and 16
rusticus 16
and 16
maximus 16
that 16
i 16
have 16
had 16
occasion 16
often 16
and 16
effectually 16
to 16
consider 16
and 16
meditate 16
with 16
myself 16
concerning 16
that 16
life 16
which 16
is 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
what 16
the 16
nature 16
and 16
manner 16
of 16
it 16
is 16
so 16
that 16
as 16
for 16
the 16
gods 16
and 16
such 16
suggestions 16
helps 16
and 16
inspirations 16
as 16
might 16
be 16
expected 16
from 16
them 16
nothing 16
did 16
hinder 16
but 16
that 16
i 16
might 16
have 16
begun 16
long 16
before 16
to 16
live 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
or 16
that 16
even 16
now 16
that 16
i 16
was 16
not 16
yet 16
partaker 16
and 16
in 16
present 16
possession 16
of 16
that 16
life 16
that 16
i 16
myself 16
in 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
observe 16
those 16
inward 16
motions 16
and 16
suggestions 16
yea 16
and 16
almost 16
plain 16
and 16
apparent 16
instructions 16
and 16
admonitions 16
of 16
the 16
gods 16
was 16
the 16
only 16
cause 16
of 16
it 16
that 16
my 16
body 16
in 16
such 16
a 16
life 16
hath 16
been 16
able 16
to 16
hold 16
out 16
so 16
long 16
that 16
i 16
never 16
had 16
to 16
do 16
with 16
benedicta 16
and 16
theodotus 16
yea 16
and 16
afterwards 16
when 16
i 16
fell 16
into 16
some 16
fits 16
of 16
love 16
i 16
was 16
soon 16
cured 16
that 16
having 16
been 16
often 16
displeased 16
with 16
rusticus 16
i 16
never 16
did 16
him 16
anything 16
for 16
which 16
afterwards 16
i 16
had 16
occasion 16
to 16
repent 16
that 16
it 16
being 16
so 16
that 16
my 16
mother 16
was 16
to 16
die 16
young 16
yet 16
she 16
lived 16
with 16
me 16
all 16
her 16
latter 16
years 16
that 16
as 16
often 16
as 16
i 16
had 16
a 16
purpose 16
to 16
help 16
and 16
succour 16
any 16
that 16
either 16
were 16
poor 16
or 16
fallen 16
into 16
some 16
present 16
necessity 16
i 16
never 16
was 16
answered 16
by 16
my 16
officers 16
that 16
there 16
was 16
not 16
ready 16
money 16
enough 16
to 16
do 16
it 16
and 16
that 16
i 16
myself 16
never 16
had 16
occasion 16
to 16
require 16
the 16
like 16
succour 16
from 16
any 16
other 16
that 16
i 16
have 16
such 16
a 16
wife 16
so 16
obedient 16
so 16
loving 16
so 16
ingenuous 16
that 16
i 16
had 16
choice 16
of 16
fit 16
and 16
able 16
men 16
to 16
whom 16
i 16
might 16
commit 16
the 16
bringing 16
up 16
of 16
my 16
children 16
that 16
by 16
dreams 16
i 16
have 16
received 16
help 16
as 16
for 16
other 16
things 16
so 16
in 16
particular 16
how 16
i 16
might 16
stay 16
my 16
casting 16
of 16
blood 16
and 16
cure 16
my 16
dizziness 16
as 16
that 16
also 16
that 16
happened 16
to 16
thee 16
in 16
cajeta 16
as 16
unto 16
chryses 16
when 16
he 16
prayed 16
by 16
the 16
seashore 16
and 16
when 16
i 16
did 16
first 16
apply 16
myself 16
to 16
philosophy 16
that 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
fall 16
into 16
the 16
hands 16
of 16
some 16
sophists 16
or 16
spent 16
my 16
time 16
either 16
in 16
reading 16
the 16
manifold 16
volumes 16
of 16
ordinary 16
philosophers 16
nor 16
in 16
practising 16
myself 16
in 16
the 16
solution 16
of 16
arguments 16
and 16
fallacies 16
nor 16
dwelt 16
upon 16
the 16
studies 16
of 16
the 16
meteors 16
and 16
other 16
natural 16
curiosities 16
all 16
these 16
things 16
without 16
the 16
assistance 16
of 16
the 16
gods 16
and 16
fortune 16
could 16
not 16
have 16
been 16
xv 16
in 16
the 16
country 16
of 16
the 16
quadi 16

somewhat 16
in 16
itself 16
that 16
is 16
pleasing 16
and 16
delightful 16
as 16
a 16
great 16
loaf 16
when 16
it 16
is 16
baked 16
some 16
parts 16
of 16
it 16
cleave 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
and 16
part 16
asunder 16
and 16
make 16
the 16
crust 16
of 16
it 16
rugged 16
and 16
unequal 16
and 16
yet 16
those 16
parts 16
of 16
it 16
though 16
in 16
some 16
sort 16
it 16
be 16
against 16
the 16
art 16
and 16
intention 16
of 16
baking 16
itself 16
that 16
they 16
are 16
thus 16
cleft 16
and 16
parted 16
which 16
should 16
have 16
been 16
and 16
were 16
first 16
made 16
all 16
even 16
and 16
uniform 16
they 16
become 16
it 16
well 16
nevertheless 16
and 16
have 16
a 16
certain 16
peculiar 16
property 16
to 16
stir 16
the 16
appetite 16
so 16
figs 16
are 16
accounted 16
fairest 16
and 16
ripest 16
then 16
when 16
they 16
begin 16
to 16
shrink 16
and 16
wither 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
so 16
ripe 16
olives 16
when 16
they 16
are 16
next 16
to 16
putrefaction 16
then 16
are 16
they 16
in 16
their 16
proper 16
beauty 16
the 16
hanging 16
down 16
of 16
grapesthe 16
brow 16

many 16
other 16
like 16
things 16
though 16
by 16
themselves 16
considered 16
they 16
are 16
far 16
from 16
any 16
beauty 16
yet 16
because 16
they 16
happen 16
naturally 16
they 16
both 16
are 16
comely 16
and 16
delightful 16
so 16
that 16
if 16
a 16
man 16
shall 16
with 16
a 16
profound 16
mind 16

are 16

mere 16
accessories 16

natural 16
appendices 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
there 16
will 16
scarce 16
appear 16
anything 16
unto 16
him 16
wherein 16
he 16
will 16
not 16
find 16
matter 16
of 16
pleasure 16
and 16
delight 16
so 16
will 16
he 16
behold 16
with 16
as 16
much 16
pleasure 16
the 16
true 16
rictus 16

wild 16

which 16
by 16
skilful 16
painters 16
and 16
other 16
artificers 16
are 16
imitated 16
so 16
will 16
he 16
be 16
able 16
to 16
perceive 16
the 16
proper 16
ripeness 16

soon 16
find 16
out 16
and 16
discern 16
those 16
and 16
many 16
other 16
things 16
will 16
he 16
discern 16
not 16
credible 16
unto 16
every 16
one 16
but 16
unto 16
them 16

all 16
thee 16

thou 16

call 16
that 16

the 16
whole 16

it 16

one 16
city 16

as 16
for 16
thy 16
body 16
what 16
canst 16
thou 16
fear 16
if 16
thou 16
dost 16
consider 16
that 16
thy 16
mind 16

understanding 16

once 16
it 16
hath 16

rudely 16
no 16

at 16

is 16
altogether 16
indifferent 16

else 16
thou 16
hast 16
heard 16
and 16
assented 16
unto 16
concerning 16
either 16
pain 16
or 16
pleasure 16
but 16
the 16
care 16
of 16
thine 16
honour 16
and 16
reputation 16
will 16
perchance 16
distract 16
thee 16
how 16
can 16
that 16
be 16
if 16
thou 16
dost 16
look 16
back 16
and 16
consider 16
both 16
how 16
quickly 16
all 16
things 16
that 16
are 16
are 16
forgotten 16

what 16
an 16
immense 16
chaos 16
of 16
eternity 16
was 16
before 16
and 16
will 16
follow 16
after 16
all 16
things 16
and 16
the 16
vanity 16
of 16
praise 16
and 16
the 16
inconstancy 16
and 16
variableness 16
of 16
human 16
judgments 16

opinions 16

the 16
narrowness 16
of 16
the 16
place 16
wherein 16
it 16
is 16
limited 16
and 16
circumscribed 16
for 16
the 16
whole 16
earth 16
is 16
but 16
as 16
one 16
point 16
and 16
of 16
it 16
this 16
inhabited 16
part 16
of 16
it 16
is 16
but 16
a 16
very 16
little 16
part 16
and 16
of 16
this 16
part 16
how 16
many 16
in 16
number 16
and 16
what 16
manner 16
of 16
men 16
are 16
they 16
that 16
will 16
commend 16
thee 16
what 16
remains 16
then 16
but 16
that 16
thou 16
often 16
put 16
in 16
practice 16
this 16
kind 16
of 16
retiring 16
of 16
thyself 16
to 16
this 16
little 16
part 16
of 16
thyself 16

above 16
all 16
things 16
keep 16
thyself 16
from 16
distraction 16
and 16
intend 16
not 16
anything 16
vehemently 16
but 16
be 16
free 16
and 16
consider 16
all 16
things 16
as 16
a 16
man 16
whose 16
proper 16
object 16
is 16
virtue 16
as 16
a 16
man 16
whose 16
true 16
nature 16
is 16
to 16
be 16
kind 16
and 16
sociable 16
as 16
a 16
citizen 16
as 16
a 16
mortal 16
creature 16
among 16
other 16
things 16
which 16
to 16
consider 16
and 16
look 16
into 16
thou 16
must 16
use 16
to 16
withdraw 16
thyself 16
let 16
those 16
two 16
be 16
among 16
the 16
most 16
obvious 16
and 16
at 16
hand 16
one 16
that 16
the 16
things 16
or 16
objects 16
themselves 16
reach 16
not 16
unto 16
the 16
soul 16
but 16
stand 16
without 16

it 16
were 16
familiarly 16
follow 16
upon 16
that 16
which 16
was 16
before 16
for 16
thou 16
must 16
consider 16
the 16
things 16
of 16
the 16
world 16
not 16
as 16
a 16
loose 16
independent 16
number 16
consisting 16
merely 16
of 16
necessary 16
events 16
but 16
as 16
a 16
discreet 16
connection 16
of 16
things 16
orderly 16
and 16
harmoniously 16
disposed 16
there 16
is 16
then 16
to 16
be 16
seen 16
in 16
the 16
things 16
of 16
the 16
world 16
not 16
a 16
bare 16
succession 16
but 16
an 16
admirable 16
correspondence 16
and 16
affinity 16
xxxvii 16
let 16
that 16
of 16
heraclitus 16
never 16
be 16
out 16
of 16
thy 16
mind 16
that 16
the 16
death 16
of 16
earth 16
is 16
water 16
and 16
the 16
death 16
of 16
water 16
is 16
air 16
and 16
the 16
death 16
of 16
air 16
is 16
fire 16
and 16
so 16
on 16
the 16
contrary 16
remember 16
him 16
also 16
who 16
was 16
ignorant 16
whither 16
the 16
way 16
did 16
lead 16
and 16
how 16
that 16
reason 16
being 16
the 16
thing 16
by 16
which 16
all 16
things 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
are 16
administered 16
and 16
which 16
men 16
are 16
continually 16
and 16
most 16
inwardly 16
conversant 16
with 16
yet 16
is 16
the 16
thing 16
which 16
ordinarily 16
they 16
are 16
most 16
in 16
opposition 16
with 16
and 16
how 16
those 16
things 16
which 16
daily 16
happen 16
among 16
them 16
cease 16
not 16
daily 16
to 16
be 16
strange 16
unto 16
them 16
and 16
that 16
we 16
should 16
not 16
either 16
speak 16
or 16
do 16
anything 16
as 16
men 16
in 16
their 16
sleep 16
by 16
opinion 16
and 16
bare 16
imagination 16
for 16
then 16
we 16
think 16
we 16
speak 16
and 16
do 16
and 16
that 16
we 16
must 16
not 16
be 16
as 16
children 16
who 16
follow 16
their 16
fathers 16
example 16
for 16
best 16
reason 16
alleging 16
their 16
bare 16
successive 16
tradition 16
from 16
our 16
forefathers 16
we 16
have 16
received 16
it 16
xxxviii 16
even 16
as 16
if 16
any 16
of 16
the 16
gods 16
should 16
tell 16
thee 16
thou 16
shalt 16
certainly 16
die 16
tomorrow 16
or 16
next 16
day 16
thou 16
wouldst 16
not 16
except 16
thou 16
wert 16
extremely 16
base 16
and 16
pusillanimous 16
take 16
it 16
for 16
a 16
great 16
benefit 16
rather 16
to 16
die 16
the 16
next 16
day 16
after 16
than 16
tomorrow 16
for 16
alas 16
what 16
is 16
the 16
difference 16
so 16
for 16
the 16
same 16
reason 16
think 16
it 16
no 16
great 16
matter 16
to 16
die 16
rather 16
many 16
years 16
after 16
than 16
the 16
very 16
next 16
day 16
xxxix 16
let 16
it 16
be 16
thy 16
perpetual 16
meditation 16
how 16
many 16
physicians 16
who 16
once 16
looked 16
so 16
grim 16
and 16
so 16
tetrically 16
shrunk 16
their 16
brows 16
upon 16
their 16
patients 16
are 16
dead 16
and 16
gone 16
themselves 16
how 16
many 16
astrologers 16
after 16
that 16
in 16
great 16
ostentation 16
they 16
had 16
foretold 16
the 16
death 16
of 16
some 16
others 16
how 16
many 16
philosophers 16
after 16
so 16
many 16
elaborate 16
tracts 16
and 16
volumes 16
concerning 16
either 16
mortality 16
or 16
immortality 16
how 16
many 16
brave 16
captains 16
and 16
commanders 16
after 16
the 16
death 16
and 16
slaughter 16
of 16
so 16
many 16
how 16
many 16
kings 16
and 16
tyrants 16
after 16
they 16
had 16
with 16
such 16
horror 16
and 16
insolency 16
abused 16
their 16
power 16
upon 16
mens 16
lives 16
as 16
though 16
themselves 16
had 16
been 16
immortal 16
how 16
many 16
that 16
i 16
may 16
so 16
speak 16
whole 16
cities 16
both 16
men 16
and 16
towns 16
helice 16
pompeii 16
herculaneum 16
and 16
others 16
innumerable 16
are 16
dead 16
and 16
gone 16
run 16
them 16
over 16
also 16
whom 16
thou 16
thyself 16
one 16
after 16
another 16
hast 16
known 16
in 16
thy 16
time 16
to 16
drop 16
away 16
such 16
and 16
such 16
a 16
one 16
took 16
care 16
of 16
such 16
and 16
such 16
a 16
ones 16
burial 16
and 16
soon 16
after 16
was 16
buried 16
himself 16
so 16
one 16
so 16
another 16
and 16
all 16
things 16
in 16
a 16
short 16
time 16
for 16
herein 16
lieth 16
all 16
indeed 16
ever 16
to 16
look 16
upon 16
all 16
worldly 16
things 16
as 16
things 16
for 16
their 16
continuance 16
that 16
are 16
but 16
for 16
a 16
day 16
and 16
for 16
their 16
worth 16
most 16
vile 16
and 16
contemptible 16
as 16
for 16
example 16
what 16
is 16
man 16
that 16
which 16
but 16
the 16
other 16
day 16
when 16
he 16
was 16
conceived 16
was 16
vile 16
snivel 16
and 16
within 16
few 16
days 16
shall 16
be 16
either 16
an 16
embalmed 16
carcass 16
or 16
mere 16
ashes 16
thus 16
must 16
thou 16
according 16
to 16
truth 16
and 16
nature 16
throughly 16
consider 16
how 16
mans 16
life 16
is 16
but 16
for 16
a 16
very 16
moment 16
of 16
time 16
and 16
so 16
depart 16
meek 16
and 16
contented 16
even 16
as 16
if 16
a 16
ripe 16
olive 16
falling 16
should 16
praise 16
the 16
ground 16
that 16
bare 16
her 16
and 16
give 16
thanks 16
to 16
the 16
tree 16
that 16
begat 16
her 16
xl 16
thou 16
must 16
be 16
like 16
a 16
promontory 16
of 16
the 16
sea 16
against 16
which 16
though 16
the 16
waves 16
beat 16
continually 16
yet 16
it 16
both 16
itself 16
stands 16
and 16
about 16
it 16
are 16
those 16
swelling 16
waves 16
stilled 16
and 16
quieted 16
xli 16
oh 16
wretched 16
i 16
to 16
whom 16
this 16
mischance 16
is 16
happened 16
nay 16
happy 16
i 16
to 16
whom 16
this 16
thing 16
being 16
happened 16
i 16
can 16
continue 16
without 16
grief 16
neither 16
wounded 16
by 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
present 16
nor 16
in 16
fear 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
to 16
come 16
for 16
as 16
for 16
this 16
it 16
might 16
have 16
happened 16
unto 16
any 16
man 16
but 16
any 16
man 16
having 16
such 16
a 16
thing 16
befallen 16
him 16
could 16
not 16
have 16
continued 16
without 16
grief 16
why 16
then 16
should 16
that 16
rather 16
be 16
an 16
unhappiness 16
than 16
this 16
a 16
happiness 16
but 16
however 16
canst 16
thou 16
man 16
term 16
that 16
unhappiness 16
which 16
is 16
no 16
mischance 16
to 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
man 16
i 16
canst 16
thou 16
think 16
that 16
a 16
mischance 16
to 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
man 16
which 16
is 16
not 16
contrary 16
to 16
the 16
end 16
and 16
will 16
of 16
his 16
nature 16
what 16
then 16
hast 16
thou 16
learned 16
is 16
the 16
will 16
of 16
mans 16
nature 16

that 16

which 16
hath 16
happened 16
unto 16
thee 16

thee 16
from 16
being 16
just 16
or 16
magnanimous 16

temperate 16

wise 16

true 16

free 16

from 16
anything 16
else 16
of 16
all 16
those 16
things 16
in 16
the 16
present 16
enjoying 16
and 16
possession 16
whereof 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
man 16
as 16
then 16
enjoying 16
all 16
that 16
is 16
proper 16
unto 16

fully 16
satisfied 16
now 16
to 16
conclude 16
upon 16
all 16
occasion 16
of 16
sorrow 16
remember 16
henceforth 16
to 16
make 16
use 16
of 16
this 16
dogma 16
that 16
whatsoever 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
hath 16
happened 16
unto 16
thee 16
is 16
in 16
very 16
deed 16
no 16
such 16
thing 16
of 16
itself 16
as 16
a 16
misfortune 16
but 16
that 16
to 16
bear 16
it 16
generously 16
is 16
certainly 16
great 16
happiness 16
xlii 16
it 16
is 16
but 16
an 16
ordinary 16
coarse 16
one 16
yet 16
it 16
is 16
a 16
good 16
effectual 16
remedy 16
against 16
the 16
fear 16
of 16
death 16
for 16
a 16
man 16
to 16
consider 16
in 16
his 16
mind 16
the 16
examples 16
of 16
such 16
who 16
greedily 16
and 16
covetously 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
did 16
for 16
a 16
long 16
time 16
enjoy 16
their 16
lives 16
what 16
have 16
they 16
got 16
more 16
than 16
they 16
whose 16
deaths 16
have 16
been 16
untimely 16
are 16
not 16
they 16
themselves 16
dead 16
at 16
the 16
last 16

cadiciants 16

little 16

little 16

it 16
is 16

is 16
pleasing 16

was 16
it 16
then 16
for 16
this 16
that 16
thou 16
wert 16
born 16
that 16
thou 16
mightest 16
enjoy 16
pleasure 16
was 16
it 16
not 16
in 16
very 16
truth 16
for 16
this 16
that 16
thou 16
mightest 16
always 16
be 16
busy 16
and 16
in 16
action 16
seest 16
thou 16
not 16
how 16
all 16
things 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
besides 16
how 16
every 16
tree 16
md 16
plant 16
how 16
sparrows 16

ants 16
spiders 16

bees 16
how 16
all 16
in 16
their 16
kind 16
are 16
intent 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
orderly 16
to 16
perform 16
whatsoever 16
towards 16
the 16
preservation 16
of 16
this 16
orderly 16
universe 16
naturally 16
doth 16
become 16
and 16
belong 16
unto 16
thin 16
and 16
wilt 16
not 16
thou 16
do 16
that 16
which 16
belongs 16
unto 16
a 16
man 16
to 16
do 16
wilt 16
not 16
thou 16
run 16
to 16
do 16
that 16
which 16
thy 16
nature 16
doth 16
require 16
but 16
thou 16
must 16
have 16
some 16
rest 16
yes 16
thou 16
must 16
nature 16
hath 16
of 16
that 16
also 16
as 16
well 16
as 16
of 16
eating 16
and 16
drinking 16
allowed 16
thee 16
a 16
certain 16
stint 16
but 16
thou 16
guest 16
beyond 16
thy 16
stint 16
and 16
beyond 16
that 16
which 16
would 16
suffice 16
and 16
in 16
matter 16
of 16
action 16
there 16
thou 16
comest 16
short 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
thou 16
mayest 16
it 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
therefore 16
that 16
thou 16
dost 16
not 16
love 16
thyself 16
for 16
if 16
thou 16
didst 16
thou 16
wouldst 16
also 16
love 16
thy 16
nature 16
and 16
that 16
which 16
thy 16
nature 16
doth 16
propose 16
unto 16
herself 16
as 16
her 16
end 16
others 16
as 16
many 16
as 16
take 16
pleasure 16
in 16
their 16

even 16
pine 16
themselves 16
at 16
their 16

and 16
neglect 16
their 16
bodies 16
and 16
their 16

for 16
it 16
and 16
doest 16
thou 16
less 16
honour 16
thy 16
nature 16
than 16
an 16
ordinary 16
mechanic 16
his 16
trade 16

a 16
good 16

actions 16
tending 16
to 16
the 16
common 16

more 16

unto 16
thee 16

worthy 16
of 16
less 16

ii 16
how 16
easy 16
a 16
thing 16
is 16
it 16
for 16
a 16
man 16
to 16
put 16
off 16
from 16
him 16
all 16
turbulent 16
adventitious 16
imaginations 16

presently 16
to 16
be 16
in 16
perfect 16
rest 16
and 16
tranquillity 16
iii 16

thyself 16
fit 16

worthy 16

or 16
to 16
do 16
anything 16
that 16
is 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16

let 16
not 16
the 16
reproach 16
or 16
report 16
of 16
some 16
that 16
may 16
ensue 16
upon 16
it 16
ever 16
deter 16
thee 16
if 16
it 16
be 16
right 16
and 16
honest 16
to 16
be 16
spoken 16
or 16
done 16
undervalue 16
not 16
thyself 16
so 16
much 16
as 16
to 16
be 16
discouraged 16
from 16
it 16
as 16
for 16
them 16
they 16
have 16
their 16
own 16
rational 16
overruling 16
part 16
and 16
their 16
own 16
proper 16
inclination 16
which 16
thou 16
must 16
not 16
stand 16
and 16
look 16
about 16
to 16
take 16
notice 16
of 16
but 16
go 16
on 16
straight 16
whither 16
both 16
thine 16
own 16
particular 16
and 16
the 16
common 16
nature 16
do 16
lead 16
thee 16
and 16
the 16
way 16
of 16
both 16
these 16
is 16
but 16
one 16
iv 16
i 16
continue 16
my 16
course 16
by 16
actions 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
until 16
i 16
fall 16
and 16
cease 16
breathing 16
out 16
my 16
last 16
breath 16
into 16
that 16
air 16
by 16
which 16
continually 16
breathed 16
in 16
i 16
did 16
live 16
and 16
falling 16
upon 16
that 16
earth 16
out 16
of 16
whose 16
gifts 16
and 16
fruits 16
my 16
father 16
gathered 16
his 16
seed 16
my 16
mother 16
her 16
blood 16
and 16
my 16
nurse 16

milk 16
out 16
of 16
which 16
for 16
so 16
many 16
years 16
i 16
have 16
been 16
provided 16
both 16
of 16
meat 16
and 16
drink 16
and 16
lastly 16
which 16
beareth 16
me 16
that 16
tread 16
upon 16
it 16

beareth 16
with 16
me 16
that 16
so 16
many 16
ways 16

abuse 16
it 16

so 16
freely 16

use 16
of 16
it 16
so 16
many 16
ways 16

so 16
many 16
ends 16

no 16
man 16
can 16
admire 16
thee 16
for 16
thy 16
sharp 16

thy 16
natural 16
disability 16

it 16
so 16
yet 16
there 16
be 16
many 16
other 16
good 16
things 16
for 16
the 16
want 16
of 16
which 16
thou 16
canst 16
not 16
plead 16
the 16
want 16
or 16
natural 16
ability 16
let 16
them 16
be 16

notwithstanding 16
any 16
pretence 16
of 16
natural 16
indisposition 16
and 16
unfitness 16
thou 16
mightest 16
have 16
performed 16
and 16
exhibited 16
and 16
yet 16
still 16
thou 16
doest 16
voluntarily 16
continue 16
drooping 16
downwards 16
or 16
wilt 16
thou 16
say 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
through 16
defect 16
of 16
thy 16
natural 16
constitution 16
that 16
thou 16
art 16
constrained 16
to 16
murmur 16

be 16
base 16
and 16
wretched 16
to 16
flatter 16
now 16
to 16
accuse 16
and 16
now 16
to 16
please 16
and 16

thy 16
body 16
to 16
be 16
vainglorious 16
to 16
be 16
so 16
giddyheaded 16

thoughts 16

the 16
gods 16
of 16
all 16
these 16
thou 16
mightest 16
have 16
been 16
rid 16
long 16
ago 16
only 16
this 16
thou 16
must 16
have 16
been 16
contented 16
with 16
to 16
have 16
borne 16
the 16
blame 16
of 16
one 16
that 16
is 16
somewhat 16
slow 16
and 16
dull 16
wherein 16
thou 16
must 16
so 16
exercise 16
thyself 16
as 16
one 16
who 16
neither 16
doth 16
much 16
take 16
to 16
heart 16
this 16
his 16
natural 16
defect 16
nor 16
yet 16
pleaseth 16
himself 16

there 16

who 16
when 16
they 16
have 16
done 16
a 16
good 16
turn 16
to 16
any 16
are 16
ready 16
to 16
set 16
them 16
on 16
the 16
score 16
for 16
it 16
and 16
to 16
require 16
retaliation 16
others 16
there 16
be 16
who 16
though 16
they 16
stand 16
not 16
upon 16
retaliation 16
to 16
require 16
any 16
yet 16
they 16
think 16
with 16
themselves 16
nevertheless 16
that 16
such 16
a 16
one 16
is 16
their 16
debtor 16
and 16
they 16
know 16
as 16
their 16
word 16
is 16
what 16
they 16
have 16
done 16

who 16
when 16
they 16
have 16
done 16
any 16
such 16
thing 16
do 16
not 16
so 16
much 16
as 16
know 16
what 16
they 16
have 16
done 16
but 16
are 16
like 16
unto 16
the 16
vine 16
which 16
beareth 16
her 16
grapes 16
and 16
when 16
once 16
she 16
hath 16
borne 16
her 16
own 16
proper 16
fruit 16
is 16
contented 16
and 16
seeks 16
for 16
no 16
further 16
recompense 16
as 16
a 16
horse 16
after 16
a 16
race 16
and 16
a 16
hunting 16
dog 16
when 16
he 16
hath 16
hunted 16
and 16
a 16
bee 16
when 16
she 16
hath 16
made 16
her 16
honey 16
look 16
not 16
for 16
applause 16
and 16
commendation 16
so 16
neither 16
doth 16
that 16
man 16
that 16
rightly 16
doth 16
understand 16
his 16
own 16
nature 16
when 16
he 16
hath 16
done 16
a 16
good 16
turn 16
but 16
from 16
one 16
doth 16
proceed 16
to 16
do 16
another 16
even 16
as 16
the 16
vine 16
after 16
she 16
hath 16
once 16
borne 16
fruit 16
in 16
her 16
own 16
proper 16
season 16
is 16
ready 16
for 16
another 16
time 16
thou 16
therefore 16
must 16
be 16
one 16
of 16
them 16
who 16
what 16
they 16
do 16
barely 16
do 16
it 16
without 16
any 16
further 16
thought 16

are 16
in 16
a 16
manner 16
insensible 16
of 16
what 16
they 16
do 16
nay 16
but 16
will 16
some 16
reply 16
perchance 16
this 16
very 16
thing 16
a 16
rational 16
man 16
is 16
bound 16
unto 16
to 16
understand 16
what 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
he 16
doeth 16
for 16
it 16
is 16
the 16
property 16
say 16
they 16
of 16
one 16
that 16
is 16
naturally 16
sociable 16
to 16
be 16
sensible 16
that 16
he 16
doth 16
operate 16
sociably 16

and 16

desire 16
that 16
the 16
party 16
him 16
self 16
that 16
is 16
sociably 16
dealt 16
with 16
should 16
be 16
sensible 16
of 16
it 16
too 16
i 16
answer 16
that 16
which 16
thou 16
sayest 16
is 16
true 16
indeed 16

the 16
true 16
meaning 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
said 16
thou 16
dost 16
not 16
understand 16
and 16
therefore 16
art 16
thou 16
one 16
of 16
those 16
first 16
whom 16
i 16
mentioned 16
for 16
they 16
also 16
are 16
led 16
by 16
a 16
probable 16
appearance 16
of 16
reason 16
but 16
if 16
thou 16
dost 16
desire 16
to 16
understand 16
truly 16
what 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
is 16
said 16
fear 16
not 16
that 16
thou 16
shalt 16
therefore 16
give 16
over 16
any 16
sociable 16
action 16

commonly 16
the 16
physician 16
hath 16
prescribed 16
unto 16
this 16
man 16
riding 16
unto 16
another 16
cold 16
baths 16
unto 16
a 16
third 16
to 16
go 16
barefoot 16
so 16
it 16
is 16
alike 16
to 16
say 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
hath 16
prescribed 16
unto 16
this 16
man 16
sickness 16
or 16
blindness 16
or 16
some 16
loss 16
or 16
damage 16
or 16
some 16
such 16
thing 16
for 16
as 16
there 16
when 16
we 16
say 16
of 16
a 16
physician 16
that 16
he 16
hath 16
prescribed 16
anything 16
our 16
meaning 16
is 16
that 16
he 16
hath 16
appointed 16
this 16
for 16
that 16
as 16
subordinate 16
and 16
conducing 16
to 16
health 16
so 16
here 16
whatsoever 16
doth 16
happen 16
unto 16
any 16
is 16
ordained 16
unto 16
him 16
as 16
a 16
thing 16
subordinate 16
unto 16
the 16
fates 16
and 16
therefore 16
do 16
we 16
say 16
of 16
such 16
things 16
that 16
they 16
do 16
happen 16
or 16
fall 16
together 16
as 16
of 16
square 16
stones 16
when 16
either 16
in 16
walls 16
or 16
pyramids 16
in 16
a 16
certain 16
position 16
they 16
fit 16
one 16
another 16
and 16
agree 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
in 16
an 16
harmony 16
the 16
masons 16
say 16
that 16
they 16
do 16
sumbainein 16
as 16
if 16
thou 16
shouldest 16
say 16
fall 16
together 16
so 16
that 16
in 16
the 16
general 16
though 16
the 16
things 16
be 16
divers 16
that 16
make 16
it 16
yet 16
the 16
consent 16
or 16
harmony 16
itself 16
is 16
but 16
one 16
and 16
as 16
the 16
whole 16
world 16
is 16
made 16
up 16
of 16
all 16
the 16
particular 16
bodies 16
of 16
the 16
world 16
one 16
perfect 16
and 16
complete 16
body 16
of 16
the 16
same 16
nature 16
that 16
particular 16
bodies 16
so 16
is 16
the 16
destiny 16
of 16
particular 16
causes 16
and 16
events 16
one 16
general 16
one 16
of 16
the 16
same 16
nature 16
that 16
particular 16
causes 16
are 16
what 16
i 16
now 16
say 16
even 16
they 16
that 16
are 16
mere 16
idiots 16
are 16
not 16
ignorant 16
of 16
for 16
they 16
say 16
commonly 16
touto 16
eferen 16
autw 16
that 16
is 16
this 16
his 16
destiny 16
hath 16
brought 16
upon 16
him 16
this 16
therefore 16
is 16
by 16
the 16
fates 16
properly 16
and 16
particularly 16
brought 16
upon 16
this 16
as 16
that 16
unto 16
this 16
in 16
particular 16
is 16
by 16
the 16
physician 16
prescribed 16
these 16
therefore 16
let 16
us 16
accept 16
of 16
in 16
like 16
manner 16
as 16
we 16
do 16
those 16
that 16
are 16
prescribed 16
unto 16
us 16
our 16
physicians 16
for 16
them 16
also 16
in 16
themselves 16
shall 16
we 16
find 16
to 16
contain 16
many 16
harsh 16
things 16
but 16
we 16
nevertheless 16
in 16
hope 16
of 16
health 16
and 16
recovery 16
accept 16
of 16
them 16
let 16
the 16
fulfilling 16
and 16
accomplishment 16
of 16
those 16
things 16
which 16
the 16
common 16
nature 16
bath 16
determined 16
be 16
unto 16
thee 16
as 16
thy 16
health 16
accept 16
then 16
and 16
be 16
pleased 16
with 16
whatsoever 16
doth 16
happen 16
though 16
otherwise 16
harsh 16
and 16
unpleasing 16
as 16
tending 16
to 16
that 16
end 16
to 16
the 16
health 16
and 16
welfare 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
and 16
to 16
joves 16
happiness 16
and 16
prosperity 16
for 16
this 16
whatsoever 16
it 16
be 16
should 16
not 16
have 16
been 16
produced 16
had 16
it 16
not 16
conduced 16
to 16
the 16
good 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
for 16
neither 16
doth 16
any 16
ordinary 16
particular 16
nature 16
bring 16
anything 16
to 16
pass 16
that 16
is 16
not 16
to 16
whatsoever 16
is 16
within 16
the 16
sphere 16
of 16
its 16
own 16
proper 16
administration 16
and 16
government 16
agreeable 16
and 16
subordinate 16
for 16
these 16
two 16
considerations 16
then 16
thou 16
must 16
be 16
well 16
pleased 16
with 16
anything 16
that 16
doth 16
happen 16
unto 16
thee 16
first 16
because 16
that 16
for 16
thee 16
properly 16
it 16
was 16
brought 16
to 16
pass 16
and 16
unto 16
thee 16
it 16
was 16
prescribed 16
and 16
that 16
from 16
the 16
very 16
beginning 16
by 16
the 16
series 16
and 16
connection 16
of 16
the 16
first 16
causes 16
it 16
hath 16
ever 16
had 16
a 16
reference 16
unto 16
thee 16
and 16
secondly 16
because 16
the 16
good 16
success 16
and 16
perfect 16
welfare 16
and 16
indeed 16
the 16
very 16
continuance 16
of 16
him 16
that 16
is 16
the 16
administrator 16
of 16
the 16
whole 16
doth 16
in 16
a 16
manner 16
depend 16
on 16
it 16
for 16
the 16
whole 16
because 16
whole 16
therefore 16
entire 16
and 16
perfect 16
is 16
maimed 16
and 16
mutilated 16
if 16
thou 16
shalt 16
cut 16
off 16
anything 16
at 16
all 16
whereby 16
the 16
coherence 16
and 16
contiguity 16
as 16
of 16
parts 16
so 16
of 16
causes 16
is 16
maintained 16
and 16
preserved 16
of 16
which 16
certain 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
thou 16
doest 16
as 16
much 16
as 16
lieth 16
in 16
thee 16
cut 16
off 16
and 16
in 16
some 16
sort 16
violently 16
take 16
somewhat 16
away 16
as 16
often 16
as 16
thou 16
art 16
displeased 16
with 16
anything 16
that 16
happeneth 16
ix 16
be 16
not 16
discontented 16
be 16
not 16
disheartened 16
be 16
not 16
out 16
of 16
hope 16
if 16
often 16
it 16
succeed 16
not 16
so 16
well 16
with 16
thee 16
punctually 16
and 16
precisely 16
to 16
do 16
all 16
things 16
according 16
to 16
the 16
right 16
dogmata 16
but 16
being 16
once 16
cast 16
off 16
return 16
unto 16
them 16
again 16
and 16
as 16
for 16
those 16
many 16
and 16
more 16
frequent 16
occurrences 16
either 16
of 16
worldly 16
distractions 16
or 16
human 16
infirmities 16
which 16
as 16
a 16
man 16
thou 16
canst 16
not 16
but 16
in 16
some 16
measure 16
be 16
subject 16
unto 16
be 16
not 16
thou 16
discontented 16
with 16
them 16
but 16
however 16
love 16
and 16
affect 16
that 16
only 16
which 16
thou 16
dust 16
return 16
unto 16
a 16
philosophers 16
life 16
and 16
proper 16
occupation 16
after 16
the 16
most 16
exact 16
manner 16
and 16
when 16
thou 16
dust 16
return 16
to 16
thy 16
philosophy 16
return 16
not 16
unto 16
it 16
as 16
the 16
manner 16
of 16
some 16
is 16
after 16
play 16
and 16
liberty 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
to 16
their 16
schoolmasters 16
and 16
pedagogues 16
but 16
as 16
they 16
that 16
have 16
sore 16
eyes 16
to 16
their 16
sponge 16
and 16
egg 16
or 16
as 16
another 16
to 16
his 16
cataplasm 16
or 16
as 16
others 16
to 16
their 16
fomentations 16
so 16
shalt 16
not 16
thou 16
make 16
it 16
a 16
matter 16
of 16
ostentation 16
at 16
all 16
to 16
obey 16
reason 16
but 16
of 16
ease 16
and 16
comfort 16
and 16
remember 16
that 16
philosophy 16
requireth 16
nothing 16
of 16
thee 16
but 16
what 16
thy 16
nature 16
requireth 16
and 16
wouldest 16
thou 16
thyself 16
desire 16
anything 16
that 16
is 16
not 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
for 16
which 16
of 16
these 16
sayest 16
thou 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
or 16
against 16
it 16
is 16
of 16
itself 16
more 16
kind 16
and 16
pleasing 16
is 16
it 16
not 16
for 16
that 16
respect 16
especially 16
that 16
pleasure 16
itself 16
is 16
to 16
so 16
many 16
mens 16
hurt 16
and 16
overthrow 16
most 16
prevalent 16
because 16
esteemed 16
commonly 16
most 16
kind 16
and 16
natural 16
but 16
consider 16
well 16
whether 16
magnanimity 16
rather 16
and 16
true 16
liberty 16
and 16
true 16
simplicity 16
and 16
equanimity 16
and 16
holiness 16
whether 16
these 16
be 16
not 16
most 16
kind 16
and 16
natural 16
and 16
prudency 16
itself 16
what 16
more 16
kind 16
and 16
amiable 16
than 16
it 16
when 16
thou 16
shalt 16
truly 16
consider 16
with 16
thyself 16
what 16
it 16
is 16
through 16
all 16
the 16
proper 16
objects 16
of 16
thy 16
rational 16
intellectual 16
faculty 16
currently 16
to 16
go 16
on 16
without 16
any 16
fall 16
or 16
stumble 16
as 16
for 16
the 16
things 16
of 16
the 16
world 16
their 16
true 16
nature 16
is 16
in 16
a 16
manner 16
so 16
involved 16
with 16
obscurity 16
that 16
unto 16
many 16
philosophers 16
and 16
those 16
no 16
mean 16
ones 16
they 16
seemed 16
altogether 16
incomprehensible 16
and 16
the 16
stoics 16
themselves 16
though 16
they 16
judge 16
them 16
not 16
altogether 16
incomprehensible 16
yet 16
scarce 16
and 16
not 16
without 16
much 16
difficulty 16
comprehensible 16
so 16
that 16
all 16
assent 16
of 16
ours 16
is 16
fallible 16
for 16
who 16
is 16
he 16
that 16
is 16
infallible 16
in 16
his 16
conclusions 16
from 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
things 16

now 16
unto 16
their 16
subjects 16
and 16
matter 16
how 16
temporary 16
how 16
vile 16
are 16
they 16
i 16
such 16

may 16
be 16
in 16
the 16
power 16

of 16
some 16
abominable 16
loose 16
liver 16

some 16
common 16
strumpet 16
of 16
some 16
notorious 16
oppressor 16

extortioner 16

from 16
thence 16
to 16
the 16
dispositions 16
of 16
them 16
that 16
thou 16
doest 16
ordinarily 16
converse 16
with 16
how 16
hardly 16
do 16
we 16
bear 16
even 16
with 16
the 16
most 16
loving 16
and 16
amiable 16
that 16
i 16
may 16
not 16
say 16
how 16
hard 16
it 16
is 16
for 16
us 16
to 16
bear 16
even 16
with 16
our 16
own 16
selves 16
in 16
such 16
obscurity 16
and 16
impurity 16
of 16
things 16
in 16
such 16

continual 16

the 16
motions 16
themselves 16

things 16
moved 16
what 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
we 16
can 16
fasten 16
upon 16
either 16
to 16
honour 16

respect 16

seriously 16

after 16
i 16
cannot 16
so 16
much 16
as 16
conceive 16
for 16
indeed 16
they 16
are 16
things 16
contrary 16
x 16
thou 16
must 16
comfort 16
thyself 16
in 16
the 16
expectation 16
of 16
thy 16
natural 16
dissolution 16

in 16
the 16
meantime 16
not 16
grieve 16
at 16
the 16
delay 16

rest 16
contented 16
in 16
those 16
two 16
things 16
first 16
that 16
nothing 16
shall 16
happen 16
unto 16
thee 16
which 16
is 16
not 16
according 16

the 16
nature 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
secondly 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
in 16
thy 16
power 16

that 16

must 16
stand 16
to 16
their 16
deliberation 16

discrete 16

wise 16
for 16
that 16
a 16
god 16
should 16
be 16
an 16
imprudent 16
god 16
is 16
a 16
thing 16
hard 16
even 16
to 16
conceive 16
and 16
why 16
should 16
they 16
resolve 16

do 16
me 16
hurt 16
for 16
what 16
profit 16
either 16
unto 16

the 16

they 16

not 16
deliberated 16
of 16
me 16
in 16

they 16
have 16
of 16

be 16
that 16

not 16
deliberated 16
at 16
all 16
which 16
indeed 16
is 16
very 16
irreligious 16
for 16
any 16
man 16
to 16
believe 16
for 16
then 16
let 16
us 16
neither 16

respect 16
our 16
oaths 16
neither 16
let 16
us 16
any 16
more 16
use 16
any 16
of 16
those 16

lawful 16
for 16
me 16
to 16
deliberate 16
myself 16
and 16
all 16
my 16
deliberation 16
is 16
but 16
concerning 16
that 16
which 16
may 16
be 16
to 16
me 16
most 16
profitable 16
now 16
that 16
unto 16
every 16
one 16
is 16
most 16
profitable 16
which 16
is 16
according 16
to 16
his 16
own 16
constitution 16
and 16
nature 16
and 16
my 16
nature 16
is 16
to 16
be 16
rational 16
in 16
all 16
my 16
actions 16
and 16
as 16
a 16
good 16
and 16
natural 16
member 16
of 16
a 16
city 16

ever 16
to 16
be 16
sociably 16

kindly 16
disposed 16

rome 16
as 16
a 16
man 16
the 16
whole 16
world 16
those 16
things 16
therefore 16
that 16
are 16
expedient 16
and 16
profitable 16
to 16
those 16
cities 16
are 16
the 16
only 16
things 16
that 16
are 16
good 16

expedient 16
for 16
me 16
xl 16
whatsoever 16
in 16
any 16
kind 16
doth 16
happen 16
to 16
any 16
one 16
is 16
expedient 16
to 16
the 16
whole 16
and 16
thus 16
much 16
to 16
content 16
us 16
might 16
suffice 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
expedient 16
for 16
the 16
whole 16
in 16
general 16

yet 16
this 16
also 16
shalt 16
thou 16
generally 16
perceive 16
if 16
thou 16
dost 16
diligently 16
take 16
heed 16

whatsoever 16
doth 16

any 16
one 16
man 16

men 16
and 16
now 16
i 16
am 16
content 16
that 16
the 16
word 16
expedient 16
should 16
more 16
generally 16
be 16
understood 16
of 16

call 16
middle 16

reason 16

thee 16

of 16
it 16
for 16
the 16
exercise 16
of 16
another 16
virtue 16

that 16
it 16
was 16
with 16
due 16
exception 16

then 16
that 16
all 16

age 16

are 16
full 16

full 16
there 16
is 16
nothing 16

what 16

there 16
that 16
thy 16

thee 16

proper 16
power 16

efficacy 16
to 16
make 16
thee 16

it 16

thou 16
wilt 16
be 16
right 16
ill 16
that 16
which 16
most 16
men 16
would 16
think 16
themselves 16
most 16
happy 16
for 16
and 16
would 16
prefer 16
before 16
all 16
things 16

the 16
gods 16
would 16
grant 16
it 16

after 16
their 16

mayst 16

thou 16
livest 16
grant 16
unto 16

the 16
things 16
of 16

again 16

hast 16
already 16

again 16

the 16
objects 16
of 16
the 16

must 16
stand 16
steadfast 16

affected 16
and 16
free 16
from 16
all 16
manner 16

this 16
right 16
ratiocination 16

apprehension 16
that 16
as 16
the 16
worth 16
is 16
of 16
those 16
things 16
which 16
a 16
man 16
doth 16

less 16
iv 16
word 16
after 16
word 16

the 16
things 16
that 16
are 16
spoken 16
be 16
conceived 16
and 16
understood 16
and 16
so 16
the 16
things 16
that 16
are 16
done 16

after 16

as 16
in 16
matter 16
of 16
purposes 16

actions 16
we 16
must 16
presently 16
see 16
what 16
is 16
the 16
proper 16
use 16
and 16
relation 16
of 16
every 16
one 16
so 16
of 16
words 16
must 16
we 16
be 16
as 16
ready 16
to 16
consider 16
of 16
every 16
one 16
what 16
is 16
the 16
true 16
meaning 16

it 16
be 16
taken 16
in 16
common 16
use 16
v 16
is 16
my 16
reason 16

understanding 16
sufficient 16
for 16
this 16
or 16
no 16
if 16
it 16
be 16
sufficient 16
without 16
any 16
private 16
applause 16
or 16
public 16
ostentation 16
as 16
of 16
an 16
instrument 16

by 16
nature 16
i 16
am 16
provided 16
of 16

make 16
use 16
of 16
it 16
for 16
the 16
work 16
in 16
hand 16

of 16
an 16
instrument 16

by 16
nature 16
i 16
am 16
provided 16

it 16

not 16
unto 16
me 16
particularly 16
as 16
a 16
private 16
duty 16
i 16
will 16
either 16
give 16
it 16
over 16
and 16
leave 16
it 16
to 16
some 16
other 16
that 16
can 16
better 16
effect 16
it 16
or 16
i 16
will 16
endeavour 16
it 16
but 16
with 16
the 16
help 16
of 16
some 16
other 16
who 16
with 16
the 16
joint 16
help 16
of 16
my 16
reason 16
is 16
able 16
to 16
bring 16
somewhat 16
to 16
pass 16
that 16
will 16
now 16
be 16
seasonable 16

useful 16
for 16
the 16
common 16
good 16
for 16
whatsoever 16
i 16
do 16
either 16
by 16
myself 16

with 16
some 16
other 16
the 16
only 16
thing 16
that 16
i 16
must 16
intend 16
is 16
that 16
it 16
be 16
good 16
and 16
expedient 16
for 16
the 16
public 16
for 16
as 16
for 16
praise 16
consider 16
how 16
many 16
who 16
once 16
were 16
much 16
commended 16
are 16
now 16
already 16
quite 16
forgotten 16

they 16
that 16

themselves 16
are 16
long 16

dead 16

gone 16

not 16
therefore 16
ashamed 16
whensoever 16
thou 16
must 16
use 16
the 16
help 16
of 16
others 16
for 16
whatsoever 16
it 16
be 16
that 16
lieth 16
upon 16
thee 16
to 16
effect 16

must 16
propose 16
it 16
unto 16
thyself 16
as 16
the 16
scaling 16

a 16
soldier 16

some 16
other 16
impediment 16

with 16
the 16

justice 16

this 16
thy 16

o 16

thou 16

that 16
he 16
that 16

of 16
any 16
worth 16

all 16
should 16
apprehend 16

a 16

this 16
rather 16
his 16

tell 16
him 16

that 16
which 16
is 16
consequent 16

agreeable 16
to 16
that 16
end 16
which 16
by 16
his 16
true 16
natural 16
constitution 16
he 16
was 16
ordained 16
unto 16
as 16
for 16
all 16
other 16
things 16
they 16
are 16
ordained 16
for 16
the 16
use 16
of 16
reasonable 16
creatures 16

in 16
all 16
things 16
we 16
see 16
that 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
worse 16

reasonable 16
creatures 16
they 16
are 16
ordained 16
one 16
for 16
another 16
that 16
therefore 16
which 16
is 16
chief 16
in 16
every 16
mans 16
constitution 16
is 16
that 16
he 16
intend 16
the 16
common 16
good 16
the 16
second 16
is 16
that 16
he 16
yield 16
not 16
to 16
any 16
lusts 16
and 16
motions 16
of 16
the 16
flesh 16
for 16
it 16
is 16
the 16
part 16
and 16
privilege 16
of 16
the 16
reasonable 16
and 16
intellective 16
faculty 16
that 16
she 16
can 16
so 16
bound 16
herself 16
as 16
that 16
neither 16
the 16
sensitive 16
nor 16
the 16
appetitive 16
faculties 16
may 16
not 16
anyways 16
prevail 16
upon 16
her 16
for 16
both 16
these 16
are 16
brutish 16
and 16
therefore 16
over 16
both 16
she 16
challengeth 16
mastery 16

cannot 16
anyways 16
endure 16

her 16
right 16
temper 16
to 16
be 16

this 16
indeed 16
most 16
justly 16
for 16
by 16
nature 16
she 16
was 16
ordained 16
to 16
command 16
all 16
in 16
the 16
body 16
the 16
third 16
thing 16
proper 16
to 16
man 16
by 16
his 16
constitution 16
is 16
to 16
avoid 16
all 16
rashness 16
and 16
precipitancy 16
and 16
not 16
to 16
be 16
subject 16
to 16
error 16
to 16
these 16
things 16
then 16
let 16
the 16
mind 16
apply 16
herself 16
and 16
go 16
straight 16
on 16
without 16
any 16
distraction 16
about 16
other 16
things 16

thou 16

oftentimes 16
unsensibly 16
trouble 16

vex 16
thee 16

not 16
armed 16
against 16

they 16
go 16
not 16
ordinarily 16
under 16
the 16
name 16
of 16
pains 16
which 16
in 16
very 16
deed 16
are 16
of 16
the 16

unnatural 16

ordinary 16

are 16
commonly 16
one 16
towards 16
another 16
xxxvii 16
how 16
know 16
we 16
whether 16
socrates 16
were 16
so 16
eminent 16
indeed 16
and 16
of 16
so 16
extraordinary 16
a 16
disposition 16
for 16
that 16
he 16
died 16
more 16
gloriously 16
that 16
he 16
disputed 16
with 16
the 16
sophists 16
more 16
subtilly 16
that 16
he 16
watched 16
in 16
the 16
frost 16
more 16
assiduously 16
that 16
being 16
commanded 16
to 16
fetch 16
innocent 16
salaminius 16
he 16
refused 16
to 16
do 16
it 16
more 16
generously 16
all 16
this 16
will 16
not 16
serve 16
nor 16
that 16
he 16
walked 16
in 16
the 16
streets 16
with 16
much 16
gravity 16
and 16
majesty 16
as 16
was 16
objected 16
unto 16
him 16
by 16
his 16
adversaries 16
which 16
nevertheless 16
a 16
man 16
may 16
well 16
doubt 16
of 16
whether 16
it 16
were 16
so 16
or 16
no 16
or 16
which 16
above 16
all 16
the 16
rest 16
if 16
so 16
be 16
that 16
it 16
were 16
true 16
a 16
man 16
would 16
well 16
consider 16
of 16
whether 16
commendable 16
or 16
discommendable 16
the 16
thing 16
therefore 16
that 16
we 16
must 16
inquire 16
into 16
is 16
this 16
what 16
manner 16
of 16
soul 16
socrates 16
had 16
whether 16
his 16
disposition 16
was 16
such 16
as 16
that 16
all 16
that 16
he 16
stood 16
upon 16
and 16
sought 16
after 16
in 16
this 16
world 16
was 16
barely 16
this 16
that 16
he 16
might 16
ever 16
carry 16
himself 16
justly 16
towards 16
men 16
and 16
holily 16
towards 16
the 16
gods 16
neither 16
vexing 16
himself 16
to 16
no 16
purpose 16
at 16
the 16
wickedness 16
of 16
others 16
nor 16
yet 16
ever 16
condescending 16
to 16
any 16
mans 16
evil 16
fact 16
or 16
evil 16
intentions 16
through 16
either 16
fear 16
or 16
engagement 16
of 16
friendship 16
whether 16
of 16
those 16
things 16
that 16
happened 16
unto 16
him 16
by 16
gods 16
appointment 16
he 16
neither 16
did 16
wonder 16
at 16
any 16
when 16
it 16
did 16
happen 16
or 16
thought 16
it 16
intolerable 16
in 16
the 16
trial 16
of 16
it 16
and 16
lastly 16
whether 16
he 16
never 16
did 16
suffer 16
his 16
mind 16
to 16
sympathise 16
with 16
the 16
senses 16
and 16
affections 16
of 16
the 16
body 16
for 16
we 16
must 16
not 16
think 16
that 16
nature 16
hath 16
so 16
mixed 16
and 16
tempered 16
it 16
with 16
the 16
body 16
as 16
that 16
she 16
hath 16
not 16
power 16
to 16
circumscribe 16
herself 16
and 16
by 16
herself 16
to 16
intend 16
her 16
own 16
ends 16

occasions 16
xxxviii 16
for 16
it 16
is 16
a 16
thing 16
very 16
possible 16
that 16
a 16
man 16
should 16
be 16
a 16
very 16
divine 16
man 16
and 16
yet 16
be 16
altogether 16
unknown 16

must 16
ever 16
be 16
mindful 16

of 16
this 16
also 16
that 16
a 16
mans 16
true 16
happiness 16
doth 16
consist 16
in 16
very 16
few 16
things 16

that 16
although 16
thou 16
dost 16
despair 16

thou 16
shalt 16
ever 16
be 16

rather 16
to 16
perform 16

that 16
it 16
becometh 16
altogether 16
unconquerable 16
when 16
once 16
recollected 16
in 16
herself 16
she 16
seeks 16
no 16
other 16
content 16

this 16
that 16

cannot 16
be 16
forced 16

by 16
the 16

change 16
it 16

of 16
these 16

i 16
say 16
that 16
common 16
nature 16
doth 16
indifferently 16
make 16
use 16
of 16
them 16
my 16
meaning 16
is 16
that 16
they 16
happen 16
indifferently 16
in 16
the 16
ordinary 16
course 16
of 16
things 16
which 16
by 16
a 16
necessary 16
consequence 16
whether 16
as 16
principal 16
or 16
accessory 16
come 16
to 16
pass 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
according 16
to 16
that 16
first 16
and 16
ancient 16
deliberation 16
of 16
providence 16
by 16
which 16
she 16
from 16
some 16
certain 16
beginning 16
did 16
resolve 16
upon 16
the 16
creation 16
of 16
such 16
a 16
world 16
conceiving 16
then 16
in 16
her 16
womb 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
some 16
certain 16
rational 16
generative 16
seeds 16
and 16
faculties 16
of 16
things 16
future 16
whether 16
subjects 16
changes 16
successions 16
both 16
such 16
and 16
such 16
and 16
just 16
so 16
many 16
ii 16
it 16
were 16
indeed 16
more 16
happy 16
and 16
comfortable 16
for 16
a 16
man 16
to 16
depart 16
out 16
of 16
this 16
world 16
having 16
lived 16
all 16
his 16
life 16
long 16
clear 16
from 16
all 16
falsehood 16
dissimulation 16
voluptuousness 16
and 16
pride 16
but 16
if 16
this 16
cannot 16
be 16
yet 16
it 16
is 16
some 16
comfort 16
for 16
a 16
man 16
joyfully 16
to 16
depart 16
as 16
weary 16
and 16
out 16
of 16
love 16
with 16
those 16
rather 16
than 16
to 16
desire 16
to 16
live 16
and 16
to 16
continue 16
long 16
in 16
those 16
wicked 16
courses 16
hath 16
not 16
yet 16
experience 16
taught 16
thee 16
to 16
fly 16
from 16
the 16
plague 16
for 16
a 16
far 16
greater 16
plague 16
is 16
the 16
corruption 16
of 16
the 16
mind 16
than 16
any 16
certain 16
change 16
and 16
distemper 16
of 16
the 16
common 16
air 16
can 16
be 16

is 16
a 16
plague 16
of 16
creatures 16
as 16
they 16
are 16
living 16
creatures 16

thou 16

not 16
in 16
matter 16
of 16
death 16
carry 16
thyself 16
scornfully 16

as 16
one 16
that 16
is 16
well 16
pleased 16
with 16
it 16

appointed 16

any 16
wise 16
to 16
carry 16
himself 16
either 16
violently 16
or 16
proudly 16

patiently 16
to 16
wait 16

natures 16

mind 16
as 16
now 16
thou 16
dost 16
expect 16
when 16
that 16
which 16
yet 16
is 16
but 16
an 16
embryo 16
in 16
thy 16
wifes 16
belly 16
shall 16
come 16
forth 16
thou 16
mayst 16
expect 16
also 16
when 16
thy 16
soul 16
shall 16
fall 16
off 16
from 16
that 16
outward 16
coat 16
or 16
skin 16
wherein 16
as 16
a 16
child 16

lieth 16
involved 16

shut 16
up 16

a 16
more 16
popular 16
and 16
though 16
not 16
so 16
direct 16
and 16
philosophical 16
yet 16
a 16
very 16
powerful 16
and 16
penetrative 16
recipe 16
against 16
the 16
fear 16
of 16
death 16
nothing 16
can 16
make 16
they 16
more 16
willing 16
to 16
part 16
with 16
thy 16
life 16
than 16
if 16
thou 16
shalt 16
consider 16
both 16
what 16
the 16
subjects 16
themselves 16
are 16
that 16
thou 16
shalt 16

no 16
more 16
have 16

it 16
is 16
that 16
offended 16
with 16
them 16
thou 16
must 16
not 16
be 16
by 16
no 16
means 16

take 16
care 16
of 16
them 16

meekly 16
bear 16
with 16
them 16

thou 16
mayst 16
remember 16

it 16
happens 16

it 16

by 16
their 16

some 16

far 16

it 16
could 16
operate 16
unto 16

now 16
come 16
to 16
pass 16
those 16
creatures 16

another 16

so 16
shalt 16
thou 16
confess 16

thou 16
dost 16
observe 16
it 16
for 16
sooner 16
mayst 16
thou 16
find 16
a 16

no 16

thyself 16

all 16
thy 16
prayer 16

what 16
will 16
be 16
the 16
event 16
xli 16
in 16
my 16
sickness 16
saith 16
epicurus 16
of 16
himself 16
my 16
discourses 16
were 16
not 16
concerning 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
my 16
disease 16
neither 16
was 16
that 16
to 16
them 16
that 16
came 16
to 16
visit 16
me 16
the 16
subject 16
of 16
my 16
talk 16
but 16
in 16
the 16
consideration 16

contemplation 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
was 16
of 16
especial 16
weight 16
and 16
moment 16

all 16
my 16
time 16
bestowed 16

spent 16
and 16
among 16
others 16
in 16
this 16
very 16
thing 16
how 16
my 16
mind 16
by 16
a 16
natural 16
and 16
unavoidable 16
sympathy 16
partaking 16
in 16
some 16
sort 16
with 16
the 16
present 16
indisposition 16
of 16
my 16
body 16
might 16
nevertheless 16
keep 16
herself 16
free 16
from 16
trouble 16

in 16
present 16
possession 16
of 16
her 16
own 16
proper 16
happiness 16
neither 16
did 16
i 16
leave 16
the 16
ordering 16
of 16
my 16
body 16
to 16
the 16
physicians 16
altogether 16
to 16
do 16
with 16
me 16
what 16
they 16
would 16
as 16
though 16
i 16
expected 16
any 16
great 16
matter 16
from 16
them 16
or 16
as 16
though 16
i 16
thought 16
it 16
a 16
matter 16
of 16
such 16
great 16
consequence 16

their 16
means 16
to 16
recover 16
my 16
health 16
for 16
my 16
present 16
estate 16
methought 16
liked 16
me 16
very 16
well 16
and 16
gave 16
me 16
good 16
content 16
whether 16
therefore 16
in 16
sickness 16
if 16
thou 16
chance 16
to 16
sicken 16
or 16
in 16
what 16
other 16
kind 16
of 16
extremity 16
soever 16
endeavour 16
thou 16
also 16
to 16
be 16
in 16
thy 16
mind 16
so 16
affected 16
as 16
he 16
doth 16
report 16
of 16
himself 16
not 16
to 16
depart 16
from 16
thy 16
philosophy 16
for 16
anything 16
that 16
can 16
befall 16
thee 16
nor 16
to 16
give 16
ear 16
to 16
the 16
discourses 16
of 16
silly 16
people 16
and 16
mere 16
naturalists 16
xlii 16
it 16
is 16
common 16
to 16
all 16
trades 16

professions 16
to 16
mind 16
and 16
intend 16
that 16
only 16
which 16
now 16
they 16
are 16
about 16
and 16
the 16
instrument 16
whereby 16
they 16
work 16
xliii 16
when 16
at 16
any 16
time 16
thou 16
art 16
offended 16
with 16
any 16
ones 16
impudency 16
put 16
presently 16
this 16
question 16
to 16
thyself 16
what 16
is 16
it 16
then 16
possible 16
that 16
there 16
should 16
not 16
be 16
any 16
impudent 16
men 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
certainly 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
possible 16
desire 16
not 16
then 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
impossible 16
for 16
this 16
one 16
thou 16
must 16
think 16
whosoever 16
he 16
be 16
is 16
one 16
of 16
those 16
impudent 16
ones 16
that 16
the 16
world 16
cannot 16
be 16
without 16
so 16
of 16
the 16
subtile 16
and 16
crafty 16
so 16
of 16
the 16
perfidious 16
so 16
of 16
every 16
one 16
that 16
offendeth 16
must 16
thou 16
ever 16
be 16
ready 16
to 16
reason 16
with 16
thyself 16
for 16
whilst 16
in 16
general 16
thou 16
dost 16
thus 16
reason 16
with 16
thyself 16
that 16
the 16
kind 16
of 16
them 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
thou 16
wilt 16
be 16
the 16
better 16
able 16
to 16
use 16
meekness 16
towards 16
every 16
particular 16
this 16
also 16
thou 16
shalt 16
find 16
of 16
very 16
good 16
use 16
upon 16
every 16
such 16
occasion 16
presently 16
to 16
consider 16
with 16
thyself 16
what 16
proper 16
virtue 16
nature 16
hath 16
furnished 16
man 16
with 16
against 16
such 16
a 16
vice 16
or 16
to 16
encounter 16
with 16
a 16
disposition 16
vicious 16
in 16
this 16
kind 16
as 16
for 16
example 16
against 16
the 16
unthankful 16
it 16
hath 16
given 16
goodness 16
and 16
meekness 16
as 16
an 16
antidote 16
and 16
so 16
against 16
another 16
vicious 16
in 16
another 16
kind 16
some 16
other 16
peculiar 16
faculty 16
and 16
generally 16
is 16
it 16
not 16
in 16
thy 16
power 16
to 16
instruct 16
him 16
better 16
that 16
is 16
in 16
an 16
error 16
for 16
whosoever 16
sinneth 16
doth 16
in 16
that 16
decline 16
from 16
his 16
purposed 16
end 16
and 16
is 16
certainly 16
deceived 16
and 16
again 16
what 16
art 16
thou 16
the 16
worse 16
for 16
his 16
sin 16
for 16
thou 16
shalt 16
not 16
find 16
that 16
any 16
one 16
of 16
these 16
against 16
whom 16
thou 16
art 16
incensed 16
hath 16
in 16
very 16
deed 16
done 16
anything 16
whereby 16
thy 16
mind 16
the 16
only 16
true 16
subject 16
of 16
thy 16
hurt 16
and 16
evil 16
can 16
be 16
made 16
worse 16
than 16
it 16
was 16
and 16
what 16
a 16
matter 16
of 16
either 16
grief 16
or 16
wonder 16
is 16
this 16
if 16
he 16
that 16
is 16
unlearned 16
do 16
the 16
deeds 16
of 16
one 16
that 16
is 16
unlearned 16
should 16
not 16
thou 16
rather 16
blame 16
thyself 16
who 16
when 16
upon 16
very 16
good 16
grounds 16
of 16
reason 16
thou 16
mightst 16
have 16
thought 16
it 16
very 16
probable 16
that 16
such 16
a 16
thing 16
would 16
by 16
such 16
a 16
one 16
be 16
committed 16
didst 16
not 16
only 16
not 16
foresee 16
it 16
but 16
moreover 16
dost 16
wonder 16
at 16
it 16
that 16
such 16
a 16
thing 16
should 16
be 16
but 16
then 16
especially 16
when 16
thou 16
dost 16
find 16
fault 16
with 16
either 16
an 16
unthankful 16
or 16
a 16
false 16
man 16
must 16
thou 16
reflect 16
upon 16

thou 16
the 16
whole 16
itself 16
be 16
in 16
a 16
sweet 16
case 16
all 16
the 16
parts 16
of 16
it 16
being 16
subject 16
to 16
alteration 16
yea 16
and 16
by 16
their 16
making 16
itself 16
fitted 16
for 16
corruption 16
as 16
consisting 16
of 16
things 16
different 16
and 16
contrary 16
and 16
did 16
nature 16
then 16
either 16
of 16
herself 16
thus 16
project 16
and 16
purpose 16
the 16
affliction 16

misery 16
of 16
her 16
parts 16
and 16
therefore 16
of 16
purpose 16
so 16
made 16
them 16
not 16
only 16
that 16
haply 16
they 16
might 16
but 16
of 16
necessity 16
that 16
they 16
should 16
fall 16
into 16
evil 16
or 16
did 16
not 16
she 16
know 16
what 16
she 16
did 16
when 16
she 16
made 16
them 16
for 16
either 16
of 16
these 16
two 16
to 16
say 16
is 16
equally 16
absurd 16
but 16
to 16
let 16
pass 16
nature 16
in 16
general 16
and 16
to 16
reason 16
of 16
things 16
particular 16
according 16
to 16
their 16
own 16
particular 16
natures 16
how 16
absurd 16
and 16
ridiculous 16
is 16
it 16
first 16
to 16
say 16
that 16
all 16
parts 16
of 16
the 16
whole 16
are 16
by 16
their 16
proper 16
natural 16
constitution 16
subject 16
to 16
alteration 16
and 16
then 16
when 16
any 16
such 16
thing 16
doth 16
happen 16
as 16
when 16
one 16
doth 16
fall 16
sick 16
and 16
dieth 16
to 16
take 16
on 16
and 16
wonder 16
as 16
though 16
some 16
strange 16
thing 16
had 16
happened 16
though 16
this 16
besides 16
might 16
move 16
not 16
so 16
grievously 16
to 16
take 16
on 16
when 16
any 16
such 16
thing 16
doth 16
happen 16
that 16
whatsoever 16
is 16
dissolved 16
it 16
is 16
dissolved 16
into 16
those 16
things 16
whereof 16
it 16
was 16
compounded 16
for 16
every 16
dissolution 16
is 16
either 16
a 16
mere 16
dispersion 16
of 16
the 16
elements 16
into 16
those 16
elements 16
again 16
whereof 16
everything 16
did 16
consist 16
or 16
a 16
change 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
more 16
solid 16
into 16
earth 16
and 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
pure 16
and 16
subtile 16
or 16
spiritual 16
into 16
air 16
so 16
that 16
by 16
this 16
means 16
nothing 16
is 16
lost 16
but 16
all 16
resumed 16
again 16
into 16
those 16
rational 16
generative 16
seeds 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
and 16
this 16
universe 16
either 16
after 16
a 16
certain 16
period 16
of 16
time 16
to 16
lie 16
consumed 16
by 16
fire 16
or 16
by 16
continual 16
changes 16
to 16
be 16
renewed 16
and 16
so 16
for 16
ever 16
to 16
endure 16
now 16
that 16
solid 16
and 16
spiritual 16
that 16
we 16
speak 16
of 16
thou 16
must 16
not 16
conceive 16
it 16
to 16
be 16
that 16
very 16
same 16
which 16
at 16
first 16
was 16
when 16
thou 16
wert 16
born 16
for 16
alas 16
all 16
this 16
that 16
now 16
thou 16
art 16
in 16
either 16
kind 16
either 16
for 16
matter 16
of 16
substance 16
or 16
of 16
life 16
hath 16
but 16
two 16
or 16
three 16
days 16
ago 16
partly 16
from 16
meats 16
eaten 16
and 16
partly 16
from 16
air 16
breathed 16
in 16
received 16
all 16
its 16
influx 16
being 16
the 16
same 16
then 16
in 16
no 16
other 16
respect 16
than 16
a 16
running 16
river 16
maintained 16
by 16
the 16
perpetual 16
influx 16
and 16
new 16
supply 16
of 16
waters 16
is 16
the 16
same 16
that 16
therefore 16
which 16
thou 16
hast 16
since 16
received 16
not 16
that 16
which 16
came 16
from 16
thy 16
mother 16
is 16
that 16
which 16
comes 16
to 16
change 16
and 16
corruption 16
but 16
suppose 16
that 16
that 16
for 16
the 16
general 16
substance 16
and 16
more 16
solid 16
part 16
of 16
it 16
should 16
still 16
cleave 16
unto 16
thee 16
never 16
so 16
close 16
yet 16
what 16
is 16
that 16
to 16
the 16
proper 16
qualities 16
and 16
affections 16
of 16
it 16
by 16
which 16
persons 16
are 16
distinguished 16
which 16
certainly 16
are 16
quite 16
different 16

the 16
part 16
of 16
one 16
that 16
is 16
very 16
foolish 16
and 16
is 16
overfond 16
of 16
his 16
life 16
whom 16
a 16
man 16
might 16
compare 16

one 16
of 16
those 16
halfeaten 16
wretches 16

be 16
exposed 16
to 16
the 16

nails 16

ship 16
thyself 16

from 16
the 16
troubles 16

distractions 16
of 16
thy 16
former 16
life 16
convey 16
thyself 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
unto 16
these 16
few 16
names 16

if 16
thou 16
canst 16
abide 16
in 16
them 16

constant 16

them 16
continue 16
there 16
as 16
glad 16

joyful 16
as 16
one 16
that 16
were 16
translated 16
unto 16
some 16
such 16
place 16
of 16
bliss 16
and 16
happiness 16
as 16
that 16
which 16
by 16
hesiod 16

is 16
called 16
the 16
islands 16

the 16
blessed 16
by 16
others 16
called 16
the 16
elysian 16
fields 16

thou 16
findest 16
thyself 16
that 16
thou 16

in 16
danger 16
of 16
a 16
relapse 16

overcome 16

themselves 16
in 16
thy 16
present 16
station 16
get 16
thee 16
into 16
any 16
private 16
corner 16
where 16
thou 16
mayst 16
be 16
better 16
able 16
or 16
if 16
that 16
will 16
not 16
serve 16
forsake 16
even 16
thy 16
life 16
rather 16
but 16
so 16
that 16
it 16
be 16
not 16
in 16
passion 16
but 16
in 16
a 16
plain 16
voluntary 16
modest 16
way 16
this 16
being 16
the 16
only 16
commendable 16
action 16
of 16
thy 16
whole 16
life 16
that 16
thus 16
thou 16
art 16
departed 16

this 16

been 16
the 16
main 16
work 16
and 16
business 16
of 16
thy 16
whole 16
life 16
that 16
thou 16
mightest 16
thus 16
depart 16
now 16
for 16
the 16
better 16
remembrance 16
of 16
those 16
names 16
that 16
we 16
have 16
spoken 16
of 16
thou 16
shalt 16
find 16
it 16
a 16
very 16
good 16
help 16
to 16
remember 16
the 16
gods 16
as 16
often 16
as 16
may 16
be 16
and 16
that 16
the 16
thing 16
which 16
they 16
require 16
at 16
our 16
hands 16

many 16
of 16
us 16
as 16
are 16
by 16
nature 16
reasonable 16
creation 16
is 16
not 16
that 16

fair 16
words 16
and 16
outward 16
show 16
of 16
piety 16
and 16
devotion 16
we 16
should 16
flatter 16
them 16
but 16
that 16
we 16
should 16
become 16
like 16
unto 16

by 16
their 16
natural 16
constitution 16
is 16
proper 16

reflect 16
upon 16
thyself 16

what 16
thou 16
thyself 16
art 16
guilty 16

in 16
the 16

that 16

rather 16

praiseworthy 16

anything 16

not 16
hurtful 16
unto 16
the 16

none 16
of 16
these 16
casualties 16

external 16
hindrances 16
do 16
hurt 16
the 16
law 16
itself 16

are 16
contrary 16
to 16
that 16
course 16

equity 16
by 16
which 16
public 16

do 16
they 16
hurt 16
either 16

him 16

the 16

to 16

him 16
out 16
of 16
all 16
grief 16

fear 16
as 16
that 16
of 16
the 16
poet 16
the 16
winds 16
blow 16
upon 16
the 16
trees 16

their 16

fall 16
upon 16
the 16

do 16
the 16
trees 16

bud 16
again 16

by 16
the 16
springtime 16

put 16
forth 16
new 16

out 16

thy 16
children 16

they 16
also 16
that 16
applaud 16
thee 16
so 16
gravely 16

that 16
applaud 16
thy 16

deride 16
thee 16

down 16

good 16
ear 16
and 16
a 16
good 16
smell 16
be 16
ready 16

whatsoever 16
is 16

heard 16

smelt 16

all 16
kinds 16
of 16

that 16
all 16
men 16
might 16
commend 16
me 16
for 16
whatsoever 16
i 16
do 16
is 16
an 16
eye 16
that 16
seeks 16
after 16
green 16
things 16
or 16
as 16
teeth 16
after 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
tender 16
xxxvi 16
there 16
is 16
not 16
any 16
man 16
that 16
is 16
so 16
happy 16
in 16
his 16
death 16
but 16
that 16
some 16
of 16
those 16
that 16
are 16
by 16
him 16
when 16
he 16
dies 16
will 16
be 16
ready 16
to 16
rejoice 16
at 16
his 16
supposed 16
calamity 16
is 16
it 16
one 16
that 16
was 16
virtuous 16
and 16
wise 16
indeed 16
will 16
there 16
not 16
some 16
one 16
or 16
other 16
be 16
found 16
who 16
thus 16
will 16
say 16
to 16
himself 16
well 16
now 16
at 16
last 16
shall 16
i 16
be 16
at 16
rest 16
from 16
this 16
pedagogue 16
he 16
did 16
not 16
indeed 16
otherwise 16
trouble 16
us 16
much 16
but 16
i 16
know 16
well 16
enough 16
that 16
in 16
his 16
heart 16
he 16
did 16
much 16
condemn 16
us 16
thus 16
will 16
they 16
speak 16
of 16
the 16
virtuous 16
but 16
as 16
for 16
us 16
alas 16
i 16
how 16
many 16
things 16
be 16
there 16
for 16
which 16
there 16
be 16
many 16
that 16
glad 16
would 16
be 16
to 16
be 16
rid 16
of 16
us 16
this 16
therefore 16
if 16
thou 16
shalt 16
think 16
of 16
whensoever 16
thou 16
diest 16
thou 16
shalt 16
die 16
the 16
more 16
willingly 16
when 16
thou 16
shalt 16
think 16
with 16
thyself 16
i 16
am 16
now 16
to 16
depart 16
from 16
that 16
world 16
wherein 16
those 16
that 16
have 16
been 16
my 16
nearest 16
friends 16
and 16
acquaintances 16
they 16
whom 16
i 16
have 16
so 16
much 16
suffered 16
for 16
so 16
often 16
prayed 16
for 16
and 16
for 16
whom 16
i 16
have 16
taken 16
such 16
care 16
even 16
they 16
would 16
have 16
me 16
die 16
hoping 16
that 16
after 16
my 16
death 16
they 16
shall 16
live 16
happier 16
than 16
they 16
did 16
before 16
what 16
then 16
should 16
any 16
man 16
desire 16
to 16
continue 16
here 16
any 16
longer 16
nevertheless 16
whensoever 16
thou 16
diest 16
thou 16
must 16
not 16
be 16
less 16
kind 16
and 16
loving 16
unto 16
them 16
for 16
it 16
but 16
as 16
before 16
see 16
them 16
continue 16
to 16
be 16
their 16
friend 16
to 16
wish 16
them 16
well 16
and 16
meekly 16
and 16
gently 16
to 16
carry 16
thyself 16
towards 16
them 16
but 16
yet 16
so 16
that 16
on 16
the 16
other 16
side 16
it 16
make 16
thee 16
not 16
the 16
more 16
unwilling 16
to 16
die 16
but 16
as 16
it 16
fareth 16
with 16
them 16
that 16
die 16
an 16
easy 16
quick 16
death 16
whose 16
soul 16
is 16
soon 16
separated 16
from 16
their 16
bodies 16
so 16
must 16
thy 16
separation 16
from 16
them 16
be 16

but 16
yet 16
without 16
either 16
reluctancy 16

this 16

with 16
thyself 16
first 16
of 16

thyself 16

the 16

to 16
love 16

to 16

to 16
be 16
separated 16
how 16
blessed 16

happy 16
is 16
it 16
but 16
this 16
readiness 16
of 16
it 16
it 16
must 16
proceed 16
not 16
from 16
an 16
obstinate 16
and 16
peremptory 16
resolution 16
of 16
the 16
mind 16
violently 16
and 16
passionately 16
set 16
upon 16
opposition 16

christians 16
are 16
wont 16
but 16
from 16
a 16
peculiar 16
judgment 16
with 16
discretion 16
and 16
gravity 16
so 16
that 16
others 16
may 16
be 16
persuaded 16
also 16
and 16
drawn 16
to 16
the 16

without 16
any 16
noise 16

that 16
this 16
upon 16
all 16
occasions 16
may 16
present 16
itself 16
unto 16
thy 16
mind 16
and 16
never 16
cease 16
to 16
think 16
of 16
it 16
what 16
is 16
thy 16
profession 16
to 16
be 16
good 16
and 16
how 16
should 16
this 16
be 16
well 16
brought 16
to 16
pass 16
but 16
by 16
certain 16
theorems 16
and 16
doctrines 16
some 16
concerning 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16

some 16
concerning 16

particular 16
constitution 16
of 16
man 16
v 16
tragedies 16

at 16
first 16
brought 16
in 16
and 16
instituted 16
to 16
put 16
men 16
in 16
mind 16
of 16
worldly 16
chances 16
and 16
casualties 16
that 16
these 16
things 16
in 16
the 16
ordinary 16
course 16
of 16
nature 16
did 16
so 16
happen 16
that 16
men 16
that 16
were 16
much 16
pleased 16
and 16
delighted 16
by 16
such 16
accidents 16
upon 16
this 16
stage 16
would 16
not 16
by 16
the 16
same 16
things 16
in 16
a 16
greater 16
stage 16
be 16
grieved 16
and 16
afflicted 16
for 16
here 16
you 16
see 16
what 16
is 16
the 16
end 16
of 16
all 16
such 16
things 16
and 16
that 16
even 16
they 16
that 16
cry 16
out 16
so 16
mournfully 16
to 16
cithaeron 16
must 16
bear 16
them 16
for 16
all 16
their 16
cries 16
and 16
exclamations 16
as 16
well 16
as 16
others 16
and 16
in 16
very 16
truth 16
many 16
good 16
things 16
are 16
spoken 16
by 16
these 16
poets 16
as 16
that 16
for 16
example 16
is 16
an 16
excellent 16
passage 16
but 16
if 16
so 16
be 16
that 16
i 16
and 16
my 16
two 16
children 16
be 16
neglected 16
by 16
the 16
gods 16
they 16
have 16
some 16
reason 16
even 16
for 16
that 16
c 16
and 16
again 16
it 16
will 16
but 16
little 16
avail 16
thee 16
to 16
storm 16
and 16
rage 16
against 16
the 16
things 16
themselves 16
c 16
again 16
to 16
reap 16
ones 16
life 16
as 16
a 16
ripe 16
ear 16
of 16
corn 16

whatsoever 16
else 16
is 16
to 16
be 16
found 16
in 16
them 16
that 16
is 16
of 16
the 16
same 16
kind 16
after 16
the 16
tragedy 16
the 16
ancient 16
tomedy 16
was 16
brought 16
in 16
which 16
had 16
the 16
liberty 16
to 16
inveigh 16
against 16
personal 16
vices 16
being 16
therefore 16
through 16
this 16
her 16
freedom 16

liberty 16
of 16
speech 16
of 16
very 16
good 16

restrain 16
men 16
from 16
pride 16

arrogancy 16
to 16
which 16
end 16
it 16
was 16
that 16
diogenes 16
took 16
also 16
the 16
same 16
liberty 16
after 16
these 16
what 16
were 16
either 16
the 16
middle 16

new 16

merely 16

for 16
the 16
most 16
part 16

for 16
the 16
delight 16
and 16
pleasure 16
of 16
curious 16
and 16
excellent 16
imitation 16

will 16
steal 16
away 16
look 16
to 16
it 16
c 16
why 16
no 16
man 16
denies 16
but 16
that 16
these 16
also 16
have 16
some 16
good 16
things 16
whereof 16
that 16
may 16
be 16
one 16

the 16
whole 16

foundation 16
of 16
that 16
kind 16
of 16
dramatical 16
poetry 16

is 16
it 16
else 16

as 16
we 16
have 16
said 16
vi 16
how 16
clearly 16
doth 16
it 16
appear 16
unto 16
thee 16
that 16
no 16
other 16
course 16
of 16
thy 16
life 16
could 16
fit 16
a 16
true 16
philosophers 16
practice 16
better 16
than 16
this 16
very 16
course 16
that 16
thou 16
art 16
now 16
already 16
in 16
vii 16
a 16
branch 16
cut 16
off 16
from 16
the 16
continuity 16
of 16
that 16
which 16
was 16
next 16
unto 16
it 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
cut 16
off 16
from 16
the 16
whole 16
tree 16
so 16
a 16
man 16
that 16
is 16
divided 16
from 16
another 16
man 16
is 16
divided 16
from 16
the 16
whole 16
society 16
a 16
branch 16
is 16
cut 16
off 16
by 16
another 16
but 16
he 16
that 16
hates 16
and 16
is 16
averse 16
cuts 16
himself 16
off 16
from 16
his 16
neighbour 16
and 16
knows 16
not 16
that 16
at 16
the 16
same 16
time 16
he 16
divides 16
himself 16
from 16
the 16
whole 16
body 16
or 16
corporation 16
but 16
herein 16
is 16
the 16
gift 16
and 16
mercy 16
of 16
god 16
the 16
author 16
of 16
this 16
society 16

that 16
once 16
cut 16
off 16

may 16
grow 16
together 16

become 16
part 16

the 16
whole 16
again 16
but 16
if 16
this 16
happen 16
often 16
the 16
misery 16
is 16
that 16
the 16
further 16
a 16
man 16
is 16
run 16
in 16

the 16

once 16
cut 16
of 16
afterwards 16
was 16
graffed 16
in 16
gardeners 16
can 16
tell 16
you 16
is 16
not 16
like 16
that 16
which 16
sprouted 16
together 16
at 16
first 16

still 16
continued 16

by 16
nature 16
is 16
both 16
thy 16

equally 16

much 16

it 16

thou 16

xvi 16
of 16
everything 16
thou 16
must 16
consider 16
from 16
whence 16
it 16
came 16
of 16
what 16
things 16
it 16
doth 16
consist 16

what 16
it 16
will 16

what 16
will 16
be 16
the 16
nature 16

what 16
it 16
will 16
be 16
like 16
unto 16
when 16
it 16
is 16
changed 16
and 16
that 16
it 16
can 16
suffer 16
no 16
hurt 16
by 16
this 16
change 16
and 16
as 16
for 16
other 16
mens 16
either 16
foolishness 16
or 16
wickedness 16
that 16
it 16
may 16
not 16
trouble 16
and 16
grieve 16
thee 16
first 16
generally 16
thus 16
what 16
reference 16
have 16
i 16
unto 16
these 16
and 16
that 16
we 16
are 16
all 16
born 16
for 16
one 16
anothers 16
good 16
then 16
more 16
particularly 16
after 16
another 16
consideration 16
as 16
a 16
ram 16
is 16
first 16
in 16
a 16
flock 16
of 16
sheep 16
and 16
a 16
bull 16
in 16
a 16
herd 16
of 16
cattle 16
so 16
am 16
i 16
born 16
to 16
rule 16
over 16
them 16
begin 16
yet 16
higher 16
even 16
from 16
this 16
if 16
atoms 16
be 16
not 16
the 16
beginning 16
of 16
all 16
things 16
than 16
which 16
to 16
believe 16
nothing 16
can 16
be 16
more 16
absurd 16
then 16
must 16
we 16
needs 16
grant 16
that 16
there 16
is 16
a 16
nature 16
that 16
doth 16
govern 16
the 16
universe 16
if 16
such 16
a 16
nature 16
then 16
are 16
all 16
worse 16
things 16
made 16
for 16
the 16
betters 16
sake 16
and 16
all 16
better 16
for 16
one 16
anothers 16
sake 16
secondly 16
what 16
manner 16
of 16
men 16
they 16
be 16
at 16
board 16
and 16
upon 16
their 16
beds 16
and 16
so 16
forth 16
but 16
above 16
all 16
things 16
how 16
they 16
are 16
forced 16
by 16
their 16
opinions 16
that 16
they 16
hold 16
to 16
do 16
what 16
they 16
do 16
and 16
even 16
those 16
things 16
that 16
they 16
do 16
with 16
what 16
pride 16
and 16
selfconceit 16
they 16
do 16
them 16
thirdly 16
that 16
if 16
they 16
do 16
these 16
things 16
rightly 16
thou 16
hast 16
no 16
reason 16
to 16
be 16
grieved 16
but 16
if 16
not 16
rightly 16
it 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
that 16
they 16
do 16
them 16
against 16
their 16
wills 16
and 16
through 16
mere 16
ignorance 16
for 16
as 16
according 16
to 16
platos 16
opinion 16
no 16
soul 16
doth 16
willingly 16
err 16
so 16
by 16
consequent 16
neither 16
doth 16
it 16
anything 16
otherwise 16
than 16
it 16
ought 16
but 16
against 16
her 16
will 16
therefore 16
are 16
they 16
grieved 16
whensoever 16
they 16
hear 16
themselves 16
charged 16
either 16
of 16
injustice 16
or 16
unconscionableness 16
or 16
covetousness 16
or 16
in 16
general 16
of 16
any 16
injurious 16
kind 16
of 16
dealing 16
towards 16
their 16
neighbours 16
fourthly 16
that 16
thou 16
thyself 16
doest 16
transgress 16
in 16
many 16
things 16
and 16
art 16
even 16
such 16
another 16
as 16
they 16
are 16
and 16
though 16
perchance 16
thou 16
doest 16
forbear 16
the 16
very 16
act 16
of 16
some 16
sins 16
yet 16
hast 16
thou 16
in 16
thyself 16
an 16
habitual 16
disposition 16
to 16
them 16
but 16
that 16
either 16
through 16
fear 16
or 16
vainglory 16
or 16
some 16
such 16
other 16
ambitious 16
foolish 16
respect 16
thou 16
art 16
restrained 16
fifthly 16
that 16
whether 16
they 16
have 16
sinned 16
or 16
no 16
thou 16
doest 16
not 16
understand 16
perfectly 16
for 16
many 16
things 16
are 16
done 16
by 16
way 16
of 16
discreet 16
policy 16
and 16
generally 16
a 16
man 16
must 16
know 16
many 16
things 16
first 16
before 16
he 16
be 16
able 16
truly 16
and 16
judiciously 16
to 16
judge 16
of 16
another 16
mans 16
action 16
sixthly 16
that 16
whensoever 16
thou 16
doest 16
take 16
on 16
grievously 16
or 16
makest 16
great 16
woe 16
little 16
doest 16
thou 16
remember 16
then 16
that 16
a 16
mans 16
life 16
is 16
but 16
for 16
a 16
moment 16
of 16
time 16
and 16
that 16
within 16
a 16
while 16
we 16
shall 16
all 16
be 16
in 16
our 16
graves 16
seventhly 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
the 16
sins 16
and 16
transgressions 16
themselves 16
that 16
trouble 16
us 16
properly 16
for 16
they 16
have 16
their 16
existence 16
in 16
their 16
minds 16
and 16
understandings 16
only 16
that 16
commit 16
them 16
but 16
our 16
own 16
opinions 16
concerning 16
those 16
sins 16
remove 16
then 16
and 16
be 16
content 16
to 16
part 16
with 16
that 16
conceit 16
of 16
thine 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
a 16
grievous 16
thing 16
and 16
thou 16
hast 16
removed 16
thine 16
anger 16
but 16
how 16
should 16
i 16
remove 16
it 16
how 16
reasoning 16
with 16
thyself 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
shameful 16
for 16
if 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
shameful 16
be 16
not 16
the 16
only 16
true 16
evil 16
that 16
is 16
thou 16
also 16
wilt 16
be 16
driven 16
whilest 16
thou 16
doest 16
follow 16
the 16
common 16
instinct 16
of 16
nature 16
to 16
avoid 16
that 16
which 16
is 16
evil 16
to 16
commit 16
many 16
unjust 16
things 16
and 16
to 16
become 16
a 16
thief 16
and 16
anything 16
that 16
will 16
make 16
to 16
the 16
attainment 16
of 16
thy 16
intended 16
worldly 16
ends 16
eighthly 16
how 16
many 16
things 16
may 16
and 16
do 16
oftentimes 16
follow 16
upon 16
such 16
fits 16
of 16
anger 16
and 16
grief 16
far 16
more 16
grievous 16
in 16
themselves 16
than 16
those 16
very 16
things 16
which 16
we 16
are 16
so 16
grieved 16
or 16
angry 16
for 16
ninthly 16
that 16
meekness 16
is 16
a 16
thing 16
unconquerable 16
if 16
it 16
be 16

how 16
shall 16
even 16
the 16
most 16
fierce 16

malicious 16
that 16
thou 16
shalt 16
conceive 16
be 16

loving 16
unto 16
him 16

time 16

instruct 16
him 16
better 16
as 16
for 16
example 16
my 16
son 16
we 16
were 16
not 16
born 16
for 16
this 16
to 16
hurt 16

annoy 16
one 16
another 16
it 16
will 16
be 16
thy 16
hurt 16
not 16
mine 16
my 16
son 16
and 16
so 16
to 16
show 16
him 16
forcibly 16
and 16
fully 16
that 16
it 16
is 16
so 16
in 16
very 16
deed 16
and 16
that 16
neither 16
bees 16
do 16
it 16
one 16
to 16
another 16
nor 16
any 16
other 16
creatures 16
that 16
are 16
naturally 16
sociable 16
but 16
this 16
thou 16
must 16
do 16
not 16
scoffingly 16
not 16
by 16
way 16
of 16
exprobation 16
but 16
tenderly 16
without 16
any 16
harshness 16
of 16
words 16
neither 16
must 16
thou 16
do 16
it 16
by 16
way 16
of 16
exercise 16
or 16
ostentation 16
that 16
they 16
that 16
are 16
by 16
and 16
hear 16
thee 16
may 16
admire 16
thee 16
but 16
so 16
always 16
that 16
nobody 16
be 16
privy 16
to 16
it 16
but 16
himself 16
alone 16
yea 16
though 16
there 16
be 16
more 16
present 16

time 16

nine 16
particular 16
heads 16

many 16
gifts 16

that 16
thou 16

well 16

one 16
day 16
whilest 16
thou 16
art 16
yet 16
alive 16
to 16
be 16
a 16
man 16
indeed 16
but 16
on 16
the 16
other 16
side 16
thou 16
must 16
take 16
heed 16
as 16
much 16
to 16
flatter 16
them 16
as 16
to 16
be 16
angry 16
with 16
them 16
for 16
both 16
are 16
equally 16
uncharitable 16
and 16
equally 16
hurtful 16

in 16
thy 16
passions 16
take 16
it 16
presently 16
to 16
thy 16
consideration 16
that 16
to 16
be 16
angry 16
is 16
not 16
the 16
part 16
of 16
a 16
man 16
but 16
that 16
to 16
be 16
meek 16
and 16
gentle 16
as 16
it 16
savours 16
of 16
more 16
humanity 16
so 16
of 16
more 16
manhood 16
that 16
in 16
this 16
there 16
is 16
strength 16
and 16
nerves 16
or 16
vigour 16
and 16
fortitude 16
whereof 16
anger 16
and 16
indignation 16
is 16
altogether 16
void 16
for 16
the 16
nearer 16

is 16
unto 16
unpassionateness 16
the 16
nearer 16
it 16
is 16
unto 16
power 16
and 16
as 16
grief 16
doth 16
proceed 16
from 16
weakness 16
so 16
doth 16
anger 16
for 16
both 16

more 16
regard 16
other 16

himself 16

his 16
own 16
for 16
if 16
any 16
god 16
or 16
grave 16
master 16
standing 16
by 16
should 16
command 16
any 16
of 16
us 16
to 16
think 16
nothing 16
by 16
himself 16

what 16
he 16
should 16
presently 16
speak 16
out 16

man 16

able 16
to 16
endure 16
it 16
though 16
but 16
for 16
one 16
day 16
thus 16
do 16
we 16
fear 16
more 16
what 16
our 16
neighbours 16

think 16

how 16
come 16
it 16
to 16
pass 16
that 16
the 16
gods 16
having 16
ordered 16
all 16
other 16
things 16
so 16
well 16
and 16
so 16
lovingly 16
should 16
be 16
overseen 16
in 16
this 16
one 16
only 16
thing 16
that 16
whereas 16
then 16
hath 16
been 16
some 16
very 16
good 16
men 16
that 16
have 16
made 16
many 16
covenants 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
with 16
god 16
and 16
by 16
many 16
holy 16
actions 16
and 16
outward 16
services 16
contracted 16
a 16
kind 16
of 16
familiarity 16
with 16
him 16
that 16
these 16
men 16
when 16
once 16
they 16
are 16
dead 16
should 16
never 16
be 16
restored 16
to 16
life 16
but 16
be 16
extinct 16
for 16
ever 16
but 16
this 16
thou 16
mayest 16
be 16
sure 16
of 16
that 16
this 16
if 16
it 16
be 16
so 16
indeed 16
would 16
never 16
have 16
been 16
so 16
ordered 16
by 16
the 16
gods 16
had 16
it 16
been 16
fit 16
otherwise 16
for 16
certainly 16
it 16
was 16
possible 16
had 16
it 16
been 16
more 16
just 16
so 16
and 16
had 16
it 16
been 16
according 16
to 16
nature 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
would 16
easily 16
have 16
borne 16
it 16
but 16
now 16
because 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
so 16
if 16
so 16
be 16
that 16
it 16
be 16
not 16
so 16
indeed 16
be 16
therefore 16
confident 16
that 16
it 16
was 16
not 16
fit 16
it 16
should 16
be 16
so 16
for 16
thou 16
seest 16
thyself 16
that 16
now 16
seeking 16
after 16
this 16
matter 16
how 16
freely 16
thou 16
doest 16
argue 16
and 16
contest 16
with 16
god 16
but 16
were 16
not 16
the 16
gods 16
both 16
just 16
and 16
good 16
in 16
the 16
highest 16
degree 16
thou 16
durst 16
not 16
thus 16
reason 16
with 16
them 16
now 16
if 16
just 16
and 16
good 16
it 16
could 16
not 16
be 16
that 16
in 16
the 16
creation 16
of 16
the 16
world 16
they 16
should 16
either 16
unjustly 16
or 16
unreasonably 16
oversee 16
anything 16
v 16
use 16
thyself 16
even 16
unto 16
those 16
things 16
that 16
thou 16
doest 16
at 16
first 16
despair 16
of 16
for 16
the 16
left 16
hand 16

see 16
which 16
for 16
the 16
most 16
part 16
hieth 16
idle 16
because 16
not 16
used 16
yet 16
doth 16
it 16
hold 16
the 16
bridle 16
with 16
more 16
strength 16
than 16
the 16
right 16
because 16
it 16
hath 16
been 16
used 16
unto 16
it 16
vi 16
let 16
these 16
be 16
the 16
objects 16
of 16
thy 16
ordinary 16
meditation 16
to 16

manner 16
of 16
men 16
both 16
for 16
soul 16

body 16
we 16
ought 16
to 16
be 16
whensoever 16
death 16
shall 16
surprise 16
us 16
the 16
shortness 16
of 16
this 16
our 16
mortal 16
life 16
the 16
immense 16
vastness 16
of 16
the 16
time 16

hath 16
been 16
before 16

he 16
after 16
us 16

is 16

proper 16
ground 16
of 16
his 16

thyself 16

both 16
fights 16

wrestles 16
with 16
hands 16

fights 16

is 16
gone 16
whereas 16
the 16
other 16
hath 16
still 16
his 16
hand 16
free 16
which 16

may 16
easily 16
turn 16

will 16

thine 16

away 16

the 16
author 16
of 16

put 16
a 16
period 16
to 16
this 16
series 16
of 16
actions 16
now 16
this 16
time 16
or 16
certain 16
period 16
depends 16
of 16
the 16
determination 16
of 16
nature 16
sometimes 16
of 16
particular 16
nature 16
as 16
when 16
a 16
man 16
dieth 16
old 16
but 16
of 16
nature 16
in 16
general 16
however 16
the 16
parts 16
whereof 16
thus 16
changing 16
one 16
after 16
another 16
the 16
whole 16
world 16
still 16
continues 16
fresh 16
and 16
new 16
now 16
that 16
is 16
ever 16
best 16
and 16
most 16
seasonable 16

is 16
for 16
the 16
good 16
of 16
the 16
whole 16
thus 16
it 16
appears 16
that 16
death 16
of 16
itself 16
can 16
neither 16
be 16
hurtful 16
to 16
any 16
in 16
particular 16
because 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
a 16
shameful 16
thing 16
for 16
neither 16
is 16
it 16
a 16
thing 16
that 16
depends 16
of 16
our 16
own 16
will 16
nor 16
of 16
itself 16
contrary 16
to 16
the 16
common 16
good 16
and 16
generally 16
as 16
it 16
is 16
both 16
expedient 16
and 16
seasonable 16
to 16
the 16
whole 16
that 16
in 16
that 16
respect 16
it 16
must 16
needs 16
be 16
good 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
also 16
which 16
is 16
brought 16
unto 16
us 16
by 16
the 16
order 16
and 16
appointment 16
of 16
the 16
divine 16

that 16
he 16
whose 16

and 16
mind 16
in 16
these 16
things 16
runs 16
along 16
with 16
the 16
divine 16
ordinance 16

by 16
this 16
concurrence 16
of 16

divinely 16

inspired 16
xviii 16
these 16
three 16
things 16
thou 16
must 16
have 16
always 16
in 16
a 16
readiness 16
first 16
concerning 16
thine 16
own 16
actions 16
whether 16
thou 16
doest 16
nothing 16
either 16
idly 16
or 16
otherwise 16
than 16
justice 16
and 16
equity 16
do 16
require 16
and 16
concerning 16
those 16
things 16
that 16
happen 16
unto 16
thee 16
externally 16
that 16
either 16
they 16
happen 16
unto 16
thee 16
by 16
chance 16
or 16
by 16
providence 16
of 16
which 16
two 16
to 16
accuse 16
either 16
is 16
equally 16
against 16
reason 16
secondly 16
what 16
like 16
unto 16
our 16
bodies 16
are 16
whilest 16
yet 16
rude 16
and 16
imperfect 16
until 16
they 16
be 16
animated 16
and 16
from 16
their 16
animation 16
until 16
their 16
expiration 16
of 16
what 16
things 16
they 16
are 16
compounded 16
and 16
into 16
what 16
things 16
they 16
shall 16
be 16
dissolved 16
thirdly 16
how 16
vain 16
all 16
things 16
will 16
appear 16
unto 16
thee 16
when 16
from 16
on 16
high 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
looking 16
down 16
thou 16
shalt 16
contemplate 16
all 16
things 16
upon 16
earth 16
and 16
the 16
wonderful 16
mutability 16
that 16
they 16
are 16
subject 16
unto 16
considering 16
withal 16
the 16
infinite 16
both 16
greatness 16
and 16
variety 16
of 16
things 16
aerial 16
and 16
things 16
celestial 16
that 16
are 16
round 16
about 16
it 16
and 16
that 16
as 16
often 16
as 16
thou 16
shalt 16
behold 16
them 16
thou 16
shalt 16
still 16
see 16
the 16
same 16
as 16
the 16
same 16
things 16
so 16
the 16
same 16
shortness 16
of 16
continuance 16
of 16
all 16
those 16
things 16
and 16
behold 16
these 16
be 16
the 16
things 16
that 16
we 16
are 16
so 16
proud 16
and 16
puffed 16
up 16
for 16
xix 16
cast 16
away 16
from 16
thee 16
opinion 16
and 16
thou 16
art 16
safe 16
and 16
what 16
is 16
it 16
that 16
hinders 16
thee 16
from 16
casting 16
of 16
it 16
away 16
when 16
thou 16
art 16
grieved 16
at 16
anything 16
hast 16
thou 16
forgotten 16
that 16
all 16
things 16
happen 16
according 16
to 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
the 16
universe 16
and 16
that 16
him 16
only 16
it 16
concerns 16
who 16
is 16
in 16
fault 16
and 16
moreover 16
that 16
what 16
is 16
now 16
done 16
is 16
that 16
which 16
from 16
ever 16
hath 16
been 16
done 16
in 16
the 16
world 16
and 16
will 16
ever 16
be 16
done 16
and 16
is 16
now 16
done 16
everywhere 16
how 16
nearly 16
all 16
men 16
are 16
allied 16
one 16
to 16
another 16
by 16
a 16
kindred 16
not 16
of 16
blood 16
nor 16
of 16
seed 16
but 16
of 16
the 16
same 16
mind 16
thou 16
hast 16
also 16
forgotten 16
that 16
every 16
mans 16
mind 16
partakes 16
of 16
the 16
deity 16
and 16
issueth 16
from 16
thence 16
and 16
that 16
no 16
man 16
can 16
properly 16
call 16
anything 16
his 16
own 16
no 16
not 16
his 16
son 16
nor 16
his 16
body 16
nor 16
his 16
life 16
for 16
that 16
they 16
all 16
proceod 16
from 16
that 16
one 16
who 16
is 16
the 16
giver 16
of 16
all 16
things 16
that 16
all 16
things 16
are 16
but 16
opinion 16
that 16
no 16
man 16
lives 16
properly 16
but 16
that 16
very 16
instant 16
of 16
time 16
which 16
is 16
now 16
present 16
and 16
therefore 16
that 16
no 16
man 16
whensoever 16
he 16
dieth 16
can 16
properly 16
be 16
said 16
to 16
lose 16
any 16
more 16
than 16
an 16
instant 16
of 16
time 16
xx 16
let 16
thy 16
thoughts 16
ever 16
run 16
upon 16
them 16
who 16
once 16
for 16
some 16
one 16
thing 16
or 16
other 16
were 16
moved 16
with 16
extraordinary 16
indignation 16
who 16
were 16
once 16
in 16
the 16
highest 16
pitch 16
of 16
either 16
honour 16
or 16
calamity 16
or 16
mutual 16
hatred 16
and 16
enmity 16

of 16
any 16
other 16
fortune 16

condition 16
whatsoever 16

whats 16
now 16
become 16
of 16
all 16
those 16
things 16

turned 16
to 16
smoke 16
all 16
to 16
ashes 16
and 16
a 16
mere 16
fable 16
and 16
perchance 16
not 16
so 16
much 16
as 16
a 16
fable 16
as 16
also 16
whatsoever 16
is 16
of 16
this 16
nature 16
as 16
fabius 16
catulinus 16
in 16
the 16
field 16

lupus 16

caprem 16

velius 16
rufus 16

all 16
such 16
examples 16
of 16
vehement 16
prosecution 16
in 16
worldly 16
matters 16
let 16
these 16
also 16
run 16
in 16
thy 16
mind 16
at 16
the 16
same 16
time 16
and 16
how 16
vile 16
every 16
object 16
of 16
such 16
earnest 16
and 16
vehement 16
prosecution 16
is 16
and 16
how 16
much 16
more 16
agreeable 16
to 16
true 16
philosophy 16
it 16
is 16
for 16
a 16
man 16
to 16
carry 16
himself 16
in 16
every 16
matter 16
that 16
offers 16
itself 16
justly 16

one 16

cornelius 16
fronto 16
was 16
a 16
roman 16
by 16
descent 16
but 16
of 16
provincial 16
birth 16
being 16
native 16
to 16
cirta 16
in 16
numidia 16
thence 16
he 16
migrated 16
to 16
rome 16
in 16
the 16
reign 16
of 16
hadrian 16
and 16
became 16
the 16
most 16
famous 16
rhetorician 16
of 16
his 16
day 16
as 16
a 16
pleader 16
and 16
orator 16
he 16
was 16
counted 16
by 16
his 16
contemporaries 16
hardly 16
inferior 16
to 16
tully 16
himself 16
and 16
as 16
a 16
teacher 16
his 16
aid 16
was 16
sought 16
for 16
the 16
noblest 16
youths 16
of 16
rome 16
to 16

colleague 16

in 16
their 16
boyhood 16
and 16
he 16
was 16
rewarded 16
for 16
his 16
efforts 16
by 16
a 16
seat 16
in 16

senate 16

consular 16
rank 16
ad 16
by 16
the 16
exercise 16
of 16
his 16
profession 16
he 16
became 16
wealthy 16
and 16
if 16
he 16
speaks 16
of 16
his 16
means 16
as 16
not 16
great 16
he 16
must 16
be 16
comparing 16
his 16
wealth 16
with 16
the 16
grandees 16
of 16
rome 16
not 16
with 16
the 16
ordinary 16
citizen 16

century 16

there 16
are 16
enough 16
to 16
give 16
proof 16
of 16
his 16
powers 16
never 16
was 16
a 16
great 16
literary 16
reputation 16
less 16
deserved 16
it 16
would 16
be 16
bard 16
to 16
conceive 16
of 16
anything 16
more 16
vapid 16
than 16
the 16
style 16
and 16
conception 16
of 16
these 16
letters 16
clearly 16
the 16
man 16
was 16
a 16
pedant 16
without 16
imagination 16
or 16
taste 16
such 16
indeed 16
was 16
the 16
age 16
he 16
lived 16
in 16
and 16
it 16
is 16
no 16
marvel 16
that 16
he 16
was 16
like 16
to 16
his 16
age 16
but 16
there 16
must 16
have 16
been 16
more 16
in 16
him 16
than 16
mere 16
pedantry 16
there 16
was 16
indeed 16
a 16
heart 16
in 16
the 16
man 16
which 16
marcus 16
found 16
arid 16
he 16
found 16
also 16
a 16
tongue 16
which 16
could 16
speak 16
the 16

frontos 16
letters 16

by 16
no 16
means 16
free 16
from 16
exaggeration 16
and 16
laudation 16
but 16
they 16
do 16
not 16
show 16
that 16
loathsome 16
flattery 16
which 16
filled 16
the 16
roman 16
court 16
he 16
really 16
admires 16
what 16
he 16
praises 16
and 16
his 16
way 16
of 16
saying 16
so 16
is 16
not 16
unlike 16
what 16
often 16
passes 16
for 16
criticism 16
at 16
the 16
present 16
day 16

not 16

reprove 16
what 16

amiss 16
and 16
the 16
astonishment 16
of 16
marcus 16
at 16
this 16
will 16
prove 16
if 16
proof 16
were 16
needed 16

so 16
noble 16
as 16
a 16
man 16
thinks 16
me 16
worth 16
praising 16
and 16
blaming 16
in 16
another 16
place 16
he 16
deems 16
himself 16
blest 16
because 16
pronto 16
had 16
taught 16
him 16
to 16
speak 16
the 16
truth 16
although 16
the 16
context 16
shows 16
him 16
to 16
be 16
speaking 16
of 16
expression 16
it 16
is 16
still 16
a 16
point 16
in 16
favour 16
of 16
pronto 16
a 16
sincere 16
heart 16
is 16
better 16
than 16
literary 16
taste 16
and 16
if 16
fronto 16
had 16
not 16
done 16
his 16
duty 16
by 16
the 16
young 16
prince 16
it 16
is 16
not 16
easy 16
to 16
understand 16
the 16
friendship 16
which 16
remained 16
between 16
them 16
up 16
to 16
the 16
last 16
an 16
example 16
of 16
the 16
frankness 16
which 16
was 16
between 16
them 16
is 16
given 16
by 16
a 16
difference 16
they 16
had 16
over 16
the 16
case 16
of 16
herodes 16
atticus 16
herodes 16
was 16
a 16
greek 16
rhetorician 16
who 16
had 16
a 16
school 16
at 16
rome 16
and 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
was 16
among 16
his 16
pupils 16

marcus 16
and 16
the 16
emperor 16

caes 16
iii 16
ad 16
m 16
caes 16
iii 16
antoninus 16
had 16
a 16
high 16
opinion 16
of 16
herodes 16
and 16
all 16
we 16
know 16
goes 16
to 16
prove 16
he 16
was 16
a 16
man 16
of 16
high 16
character 16
and 16
princely 16
generosity 16
when 16
quite 16
young 16
he 16
was 16
made 16
administrator 16
of 16
the 16
free 16
cities 16
in 16
asia 16
nor 16
is 16
it 16
surprising 16
to 16
find 16
that 16
he 16
made 16
bitter 16
enemies 16
there 16
indeed 16
a 16
just 16
ruler 16
was 16
sure 16
to 16
make 16
enemies 16
the 16
end 16
of 16
it 16
was 16
that 16
an 16
athenian 16
deputation 16
headed 16
by 16
the 16
orators 16
theodotus 16
and 16
demostratus 16
made 16
serious 16
accusations 16
against 16
his 16
honour 16
there 16
is 16
no 16
need 16
to 16
discuss 16
the 16
merits 16
of 16
the 16
case 16
here 16
suffice 16
it 16
to 16
say 16
herodes 16
succeeded 16
in 16
defending 16
himself 16
to 16
the 16
satisfaction 16
of 16
the 16
emperor 16

taken 16
the 16

have 16
accepted 16
a 16
brief 16
for 16
the 16
prosecution 16
urged 16
to 16
some 16
extent 16
by 16
personal 16
considerations 16

in 16
this 16
cause 16

his 16
friend 16
fronto 16
greeting 16
i 16
know 16
you 16
have 16
often 16
told 16
me 16
you 16
were 16
anxious 16
to 16
find 16
how 16
you 16
might 16
best 16
please 16
me 16
now 16
is 16
the 16
time 16
now 16
you 16
can 16
increase 16
my 16
love 16
towards 16
you 16
if 16
it 16
can 16
be 16
increased 16
a 16
trial 16
is 16
at 16
hand 16
in 16
which 16
people 16
seem 16
likely 16
not 16
only 16
to 16
hear 16
your 16
speech 16
with 16
pleasure 16
but 16
to 16
see 16
your 16
indignation 16
with 16
impatience 16
i 16
see 16
no 16
one 16
who 16
dares 16
give 16
you 16
a 16
hint 16
in 16
the 16
matter 16
for 16
those 16
who 16
are 16
less 16
friendly 16
prefer 16
to 16
see 16
you 16
act 16
with 16
some 16
inconsistency 16
and 16
those 16
who 16
are 16
more 16
friendly 16
fear 16
to 16
seem 16
too 16
friendly 16
to 16
your 16
opponent 16
if 16
they 16
should 16
dissuade 16
you 16
from 16
your 16
accusation 16
then 16
again 16
in 16
case 16
you 16
have 16
prepared 16
something 16
neat 16
for 16
the 16
occasion 16
they 16
cannot 16
endure 16
to 16
rob 16
you 16
of 16
your 16
harangue 16
by 16
silencing 16
you 16
therefore 16
whether 16
you 16
think 16
me 16
a 16
rash 16
counsellor 16
or 16
a 16
bold 16
boy 16
or 16
too 16
kind 16
to 16
your 16
opponent 16
not 16
because 16
i 16
think 16
it 16
better 16
i 16
will 16
offer 16
my 16
counsel 16
with 16
some 16
caution 16
but 16
why 16
have 16
i 16
said 16
offer 16
my 16
counsel 16
no 16
i 16
demand 16
it 16
from 16
you 16
i 16
demand 16
it 16
boldly 16
and 16
if 16
i 16
succeed 16
i 16
promise 16
to 16
remain 16
under 16
your 16
obligation 16
what 16
you 16
will 16
say 16
if 16
i 16
am 16
attackt 16
shall 16
i 16
not 16
pay 16
tit 16
for 16
tat 16
ah 16
but 16
you 16
will 16
get 16
greater 16
glory 16
if 16
even 16
when 16
attackt 16
you 16
answer 16
nothing 16
indeed 16
if 16
he 16
begins 16
it 16
answer 16
as 16
you 16
will 16
and 16
you 16
will 16
have 16
fair 16
excuse 16
but 16
i 16
have 16
demanded 16
of 16
him 16
that 16
he 16
shall 16
not 16
begin 16
and 16
i 16
think 16
i 16
have 16
succeeded 16
i 16
love 16
each 16
of 16
you 16
according 16
to 16
your 16
merits 16
and 16
i 16
know 16
that 16
lie 16
was 16
educated 16
in 16
the 16
house 16
of 16
p 16
calvisius 16
my 16
granlfather 16
and 16
that 16
i 16
was 16
educated 16
by 16
you 16
therefore 16
i 16
am 16
full 16
of 16
anxiety 16
that 16
this 16
most 16
disagreeable 16
business 16
shall 16
be 16
managed 16
as 16
honourably 16
as 16
possible 16
i 16
trust 16
you 16
may 16
approve 16
my 16
advice 16
for 16
my 16
intention 16
you 16
will 16
approve 16
at 16
least 16
i 16
prefer 16
to 16
write 16
unwisely 16
rather 16
than 16
to 16
be 16
silent 16
unkindly 16
ad 16
m 16
caes 16
ii 16
fronto 16
replied 16
thanking 16
the 16
prince 16
for 16
his 16
advice 16
and 16
promising 16
that 16
he 16
will 16
confine 16
himself 16
to 16
the 16
facts 16
of 16
the 16
case 16
but 16
he 16
points 16
out 16
that 16
the 16
charges 16
brought 16
against 16
herodes 16
were 16
such 16
that 16
they 16
can 16
hardly 16
be 16
made 16
agreeable 16
amongst 16
them 16
being 16
spoliation 16
violence 16
and 16
murder 16
however 16
he 16
is 16
willing 16
even 16
to 16
let 16
some 16
of 16
these 16
drop 16
if 16
it 16
be 16
the 16
princes 16
pleasure 16
to 16
this 16
marcus 16
returned 16
the 16
following 16
answer 16
this 16
one 16
thing 16
my 16
dearest 16
fronto 16
is 16
enough 16
to 16
make 16
me 16
truly 16
grateful 16
to 16
you 16
that 16
so 16
far 16
from 16
rejecting 16
my 16
counsel 16
you 16
have 16
even 16
approved 16
it 16
as 16
to 16
the 16
question 16
you 16
raise 16
in 16
your 16
kind 16
letter 16
my 16
opinion 16
is 16
this 16
all 16
that 16
concerns 16
the 16
case 16
which 16
you 16
are 16
supporting 16
must 16
be 16
clearly 16
brought 16
forward 16
what 16
concerns 16
your 16
own 16
feelings 16
though 16
you 16
may 16
have 16
had 16
just 16
provocation 16
should 16
be 16
left 16
unsaid 16
the 16
story 16
does 16
credit 16
to 16
both 16
fronto 16
shows 16
no 16
loss 16
of 16
temper 16
at 16
the 16
interference 16
nor 16
shrinks 16
from 16
stating 16
his 16
case 16
with 16
frankness 16
and 16
marcus 16
with 16
forbearance 16
remarkable 16
in 16
a 16
prince 16
does 16
not 16
command 16
that 16
his 16
friend 16
be 16
left 16
unmolested 16
but 16
merely 16
stipulates 16
for 16
a 16
fair 16
trial 16
on 16
the 16
merits 16
of 16
the 16
case 16
another 16
example 16
may 16
he 16
given 16
from 16
a 16
letter 16
of 16
frontos 16
here 16
is 16
something 16
else 16
quarrelsome 16
and 16
querulous 16
i 16
have 16
sometimes 16
found 16
fault 16
with 16
you 16
in 16
your 16
absence 16
somewhat 16
seriously 16
in 16
the 16
company 16
of 16
a 16
few 16
of 16
my 16
most 16
intimate 16
friends 16
at 16
times 16
for 16
example 16
when 16
you 16
mixt 16
in 16
society 16
with 16
a 16
more 16
solemn 16
look 16
than 16
was 16
fitting 16
or 16
would 16
read 16
books 16
in 16
the 16
theatre 16
or 16
in 16
a 16
banquet 16
nor 16
did 16
i 16
absent 16
myself 16
from 16
theatre 16
or 16
banquet 16
when 16
you 16
did 16
then 16
i 16
used 16
to 16
call 16
you 16
a 16
hard 16
man 16
no 16
good 16
company 16
even 16
disagreeable 16
sometimes 16
when 16
anger 16
got 16
the 16
better 16
of 16
me 16
but 16
did 16
any 16
one 16
else 16
in 16
the 16
same 16
banquet 16
speak 16
against 16
you 16
i 16
could 16
not 16
endure 16
to 16
hear 16
it 16
with 16
equanimity 16
thus 16
it 16
was 16
easier 16
for 16
me 16
to 16
say 16
something 16
to 16
your 16
disadvantage 16
myself 16
than 16
to 16
hear 16
others 16
do 16
it 16
just 16
as 16
i 16
could 16
more 16
easily 16
bear 16
to 16
chastise 16
my 16
daughter 16
gratia 16
than 16
to 16
see 16

chastised 16

the 16
text 16
is 16
obscure 16
the 16
affection 16
between 16

is 16
clear 16
from 16
every 16
page 16
of 16
the 16

a 16
few 16
instances 16
are 16
now 16

were 16
written 16
at 16
different 16
periods 16
to 16
my 16
master 16
this 16
is 16
how 16
i 16
have 16
past 16
the 16
last 16
few 16
days 16
my 16
sister 16
was 16
suddenly 16
seized 16
with 16
an 16
internal 16
pain 16
so 16
violent 16
that 16
i 16
was 16
horrified 16
at 16
her 16
looks 16
my 16
mother 16
in 16
her 16
trepidation 16
on 16
that 16
account 16
accidentally 16
bruised 16
her 16
side 16
on 16
a 16
corner 16
of 16
the 16
wall 16
she 16
and 16
we 16
were 16
greatly 16
troubled 16
about 16
that 16
blow 16
for 16
myself 16
on 16
going 16
to 16
rest 16
i 16
found 16
a 16
scorpion 16
in 16
my 16
bed 16
but 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
lie 16
down 16
upon 16
him 16
i 16
killed 16
him 16
first 16
if 16
you 16
are 16
getting 16
on 16
better 16
that 16
is 16
a 16
consolation 16
my 16
mother 16
is 16
easier 16

how 16

the 16
hard 16
constraint 16

laid 16

beset 16
by 16

such 16
a 16
moment 16
of 16
illhealth 16

that 16
identical 16
foot 16
so 16
far 16
as 16
may 16
be 16
done 16
without 16
discomfort 16
to 16
attend 16
him 16

support 16
his 16
steps 16

arm 16
this 16
morning 16
i 16
did 16
not 16
write 16

you 16
because 16
i 16
heard 16
you 16
were 16
better 16
and 16
because 16
i 16
was 16
myself 16
engaged 16

i 16

it 16
not 16

rash 16
judgment 16
to 16

a 16

spoken 16
of 16
as 16
dominus 16
vieus 16
this 16
sentence 16
is 16
written 16
in 16
greek 16
several 16
of 16
these 16
words 16
are 16
greek 16
and 16
the 16
meaning 16
is 16
not 16
quite 16
clear 16
sometimes 16
fronto 16
descends 16
from 16
the 16
heights 16
of 16
eloquence 16
to 16
offer 16
practical 16
advice 16
as 16
when 16
he 16
suggests 16
how 16
marcus 16
should 16
deal 16
with 16
his 16
suite 16
it 16
is 16
more 16
difficult 16
he 16
admits 16
to 16
keep 16
courtiers 16
in 16
harmony 16
than 16
to 16
tame 16
lions 16
with 16
a 16
lute 16
but 16
if 16
it 16
is 16
to 16
be 16
done 16
it 16
must 16
be 16
by 16
eradicating 16
jealousy 16
do 16
not 16
let 16
your 16
friends 16
says 16
fronto 16
envy 16
each 16
other 16
or 16
think 16
that 16
what 16
you 16
give 16
to 16
another 16
is 16
filched 16
from 16
them 16
keep 16
away 16
envy 16
from 16
your 16
suite 16
and 16
you 16
will 16
find 16
your 16
friends 16
kindly 16
and 16
harmonious 16
here 16
and 16
there 16
we 16
meet 16
with 16
allusions 16
to 16
his 16
daily 16
life 16
which 16
we 16
could 16
wish 16
to 16
be 16
more 16
frequent 16
he 16
goes 16
to 16
the 16
theatre 16
or 16
the 16
lawcourts 16
or 16
takes 16
part 16
in 16
court 16
ceremony 16
but 16
his 16
heart 16
is 16
always 16
with 16
his 16
books 16
the 16
vintage 16
season 16
with 16
its 16
religious 16
rites 16

always 16
spent 16

in 16
the 16
country 16

sonic 16
notion 16
of 16

but 16
there 16

nothing 16
to 16

however 16

climbed 16
a 16
pretty 16
steep 16
hill 16
and 16

the 16

the 16
composition 16
of 16

hunter 16
or 16

vintager 16
whose 16
shouts 16
are 16
echoing 16
through 16
my 16
chamber 16
hateful 16
and 16
wearisome 16
as 16
the 16
lawcourts 16

in 16
writing 16
not 16
quite 16
so 16
badly 16
as 16
yesterday 16
indeed 16
then 16
after 16
waiting 16
upon 16
my 16
father 16
i 16
soothed 16
my 16
throat 16
with 16
honeywater 16
ejecting 16
it 16
without 16
swallowing 16
i 16
might 16
say 16
gargle 16
but 16
i 16
wont 16
though 16
i 16
think 16
the 16
word 16
is 16
found 16
in 16
novius 16
and 16
elsewhere 16
after 16
attending 16
to 16
my 16
throat 16
i 16
went 16
to 16
my 16
father 16
and 16
stood 16
by 16
his 16
side 16
as 16
he 16
sacrificed 16
then 16
to 16
luncheon 16
what 16
do 16
you 16
think 16
i 16
had 16
to 16
eat 16
a 16
bit 16
of 16
bread 16
so 16
big 16
while 16
i 16
watched 16
others 16
gobbling 16
boiled 16
beans 16
onions 16
and 16
fish 16
full 16
of 16
roe 16
then 16
we 16
set 16
to 16
work 16
at 16
gathering 16
the 16
grapes 16
with 16
plenty 16
of 16
sweat 16
and 16
shouting 16
and 16
as 16
the 16
quotation 16
runs 16
a 16
few 16
highhanging 16
clusters 16
did 16
we 16
leave 16
survivors 16
of 16
the 16
vintage 16
after 16
the 16
sixth 16
hour 16
we 16
returned 16
home 16
i 16
did 16
a 16
little 16
work 16
and 16
poor 16
work 16
at 16
that 16
then 16
i 16
had 16
a 16
long 16
gossip 16
with 16
my 16
dear 16
mother 16
sitting 16
on 16
the 16
bed 16
my 16
conversation 16
was 16
what 16
do 16
you 16
think 16
my 16
friend 16
fronto 16
is 16
doing 16
just 16
now 16
she 16
said 16
and 16
what 16
do 16
you 16
think 16
of 16
my 16
friend 16
gratia 16
my 16
turn 16
now 16
and 16
what 16
of 16
our 16
little 16
gratia 16
the 16
sparrowkin 16
after 16
this 16
kind 16
of 16
talk 16
and 16
an 16
argument 16
as 16
to 16
which 16
of 16
you 16
loved 16
the 16
other 16
most 16
the 16
gong 16
sounded 16
the 16
signal 16
that 16
my 16
father 16
had 16
gone 16
to 16
the 16
bath 16
we 16
supped 16
after 16
ablutions 16
in 16
the 16
oilcellari 16

we 16
supped 16
after 16
ablutions 16
not 16
after 16
ablutions 16
in 16
the 16
oilcellar 16
and 16
listened 16
with 16
enjoyment 16
to 16
the 16
rustics 16
gibing 16
after 16
returning 16
before 16
turning 16
on 16
my 16
side 16
to 16
snore 16
i 16
do 16
my 16
task 16
and 16
give 16
an 16
account 16
of 16
the 16
day 16
to 16
my 16
delightful 16
master 16
whom 16
if 16
i 16
could 16
long 16
for 16
a 16
little 16
more 16
i 16
should 16
not 16
mind 16
growing 16
a 16
trifle 16
thinner 16
farewell 16
fronto 16
wherever 16
you 16
are 16
honeysweet 16
my 16
darling 16

want 16
you 16
i 16
can 16
love 16
you 16
while 16
far 16
away 16
one 16
anecdote 16
puts 16
marcus 16
before 16
us 16
in 16
a 16
new 16

ii 16
when 16
my 16
father 16
returned 16
home 16
from 16
the 16
vineyards 16
i 16
mounted 16
my 16
horse 16
as 16
usual 16
and 16
rode 16
on 16
ahead 16
some 16
little 16
way 16
well 16
there 16
on 16
the 16
road 16
was 16
a 16
herd 16
of 16
sheep 16
standing 16
all 16
crowded 16
together 16
as 16
though 16
the 16
place 16
were 16
a 16
desert 16
with 16
four 16
dogs 16
and 16
two 16
shepherds 16
but 16
nothing 16
else 16
then 16
one 16
shepherd 16
said 16
to 16
another 16
shepherd 16
on 16
seeing 16
a 16
number 16
of 16
horsemen 16
i 16
say 16
says 16
he 16
look 16
you 16
at 16
those 16
horsemen 16
they 16
do 16
a 16
deal 16
of 16
robbery 16
when 16
i 16
heard 16
this 16
i 16
clap 16
spurs 16
to 16
my 16
horse 16
and 16
ride 16
straight 16
for 16
the 16
sheep 16
in 16
consternation 16
the 16
sheep 16
scatter 16
hither 16
and 16
thither 16
they 16
are 16
fleeting 16
and 16
bleating 16
a 16
shepherd 16
throws 16
his 16
fork 16
and 16
the 16
fork 16
falls 16
on 16
the 16
horseman 16
who 16
came 16
next 16
to 16
me 16
we 16
make 16
our 16
escape 16

like 16

none 16
the 16
worse 16

this 16
spice 16
of 16
mischief 16
another 16
letter 16
describes 16
a 16
visit 16
to 16
a 16
country 16
town 16
and 16
shows 16
the 16
antiquarian 16
spirit 16
of 16
the 16
writer 16
m 16
caesar 16
to 16
his 16
master 16
m 16
fronto 16
greeting 16
after 16
i 16
entered 16
the 16
carriage 16
after 16
i 16
took 16
leave 16
of 16
you 16
we 16
made 16
a 16
journey 16
comfortable 16
enough 16
but 16
we 16
had 16
a 16
few 16
drops 16
of 16
rain 16
to 16
wet 16
us 16
but 16
before 16
coming 16
to 16
the 16
countryhouse 16
we 16
broke 16
our 16
journey 16
at 16
anagnia 16
a 16
mile 16
or 16
so 16
from 16
the 16
highroad 16
then 16
we 16
inspected 16
that 16
ancient 16
town 16
a 16
miniature 16
it 16
is 16
but 16
has 16
in 16
it 16
many 16
antiquities 16
temples 16
and 16
religious 16
ceremonies 16
quite 16
out 16
of 16
the 16
way 16
there 16
is 16
not 16
a 16
corner 16
without 16
its 16
shrine 16
or 16
fane 16
or 16
temple 16
besides 16
many 16
books 16
written 16
on 16
linen 16
which 16
belongs 16
to 16
things 16
sacred 16
then 16
on 16
the 16
gate 16
as 16
we 16
came 16
out 16
was 16
written 16
twice 16
as 16
follows 16
priest 16
don 16
the 16
fell 16
i 16
asked 16
one 16
of 16
the 16
inhabitants 16
what 16
that 16
word 16
was 16
he 16
said 16
it 16
was 16
the 16
word 16
in 16
the 16
hernican 16
dialect 16
for 16
the 16
victims 16
skin 16
which 16
the 16
priest 16
puts 16
over 16
his 16
conical 16
cap 16
when 16
he 16
enters 16
the 16
city 16
i 16
found 16
out 16
many 16
other 16
things 16
which 16
i 16
desired 16
to 16
know 16
but 16
the 16
only 16
thing 16
i 16
do 16
not 16
desire 16
is 16
that 16
you 16
should 16
he 16
absent 16
from 16
me 16
that 16
is 16
my 16
chief 16
anxiety 16
now 16
for 16
yourself 16
when 16
you 16
left 16
that 16
place 16
did 16
you 16
go 16
to 16
aurelia 16
or 16
to 16
campania 16
be 16
sure 16
to 16
write 16
to 16
me 16
and 16
say 16
whether 16
you 16
have 16
opened 16
the 16
vintage 16
or 16
carried 16
a 16
host 16
of 16
books 16
to 16
the 16
countryhouse 16
this 16
also 16
whether 16
you 16
miss 16
me 16
i 16
am 16
foolish 16
to 16
ask 16
it 16
whenas 16
you 16
tell 16
it 16
me 16
of 16
yourself 16
now 16
if 16
you 16
miss 16
me 16
and 16
if 16
you 16
love 16
me 16
send 16
me 16
your 16
letters 16
often 16
which 16
is 16
a 16
comfort 16
and 16
consolation 16
to 16
me 16
indeed 16
i 16
should 16
prefer 16
ten 16
times 16
to 16
read 16
your 16
letters 16
than 16
all 16
the 16
vines 16
of 16
gaurus 16
or 16
the 16
marsians 16
for 16
these 16
signian 16
vines 16
have 16
grapes 16
too 16
rank 16
and 16
fruit 16
too 16
sharp 16
in 16
the 16
taste 16
but 16
i 16
prefer 16
wine 16
to 16
must 16
for 16
drinking 16
besides 16
those 16
grapes 16
are 16
nicer 16
to 16
eat 16
dried 16
than 16
freshripe 16
i 16
vow 16
i 16
would 16
rather 16
tread 16
them 16
under 16
foot 16
than 16
put 16
my 16
teeth 16
in 16
them 16
but 16
i 16
pray 16
they 16
may 16
be 16
gracious 16
and 16
forgiving 16
and 16
grant 16
me 16
free 16
pardon 16
for 16
these 16
jests 16
of 16
mine 16
farewell 16
best 16
friend 16
dearest 16
most 16
lrned 16

master 16

you 16

ferment 16
in 16
the 16
vat 16
remember 16
that 16
just 16
so 16
in 16
my 16
heart 16
the 16
longing 16
for 16
you 16
is 16
gushing 16
and 16
flowing 16
and 16
bubbling 16

making 16
all 16
allowances 16
for 16
conventional 16
exaggerations 16
it 16
is 16
clear 16
from 16
the 16
correspondence 16
that 16
there 16
was 16
deep 16
love 16
between 16
marcus 16
and 16
his 16
preceptor 16
the 16
letters 16
cover 16
several 16
years 16
in 16
succession 16
but 16
soon 16
after 16
the 16
birth 16
of 16
marcuss 16
daughter 16
faustina 16
there 16
is 16
a 16
large 16
gap 16
it 16
does 16
not 16
follow 16
that 16
the 16
letters 16
ceased 16
entirely 16
because 16
we 16
know 16
part 16
of 16
the 16
collection 16
is 16
lost 16
but 16
there 16
was 16
probably 16
less 16
intercourse 16
between 16
marcus 16
and 16
fronto 16
after 16
marcus 16
took 16
to 16
the 16
study 16
of 16
philosophy 16
under 16
the 16
guidance 16
of 16
rusticus 16
when 16
marcus 16
succeeded 16
to 16
the 16
throne 16

again 16
with 16
slightly 16
increased 16
formality 16
on 16
frontos 16
part 16
and 16
they 16
go 16
on 16
for 16
some 16
four 16
years 16
when 16
fronto 16
who 16
has 16
been 16
continually 16
complaining 16
of 16
illhealth 16
appears 16
to 16
have 16
died 16
one 16
letter 16
of 16
the 16
later 16
period 16
gives 16
some 16
interesting 16
particulars 16
of 16
the 16
emperors 16
public 16
life 16
which 16
are 16
worth 16
quoting 16
fronto 16
speaks 16
of 16
marcuss 16
victories 16
and 16
eloquence 16
in 16
the 16
usual 16
strain 16
of 16
high 16
praise 16
and 16
then 16
continues 16
the 16
army 16
when 16
you 16
took 16
it 16
in 16
hand 16
was 16
sunk 16
in 16
luxury 16
and 16
revelry 16
and 16
corrupted 16
with 16
long 16
inactivity 16
at 16
antiochia 16
the 16
soldiers 16
had 16
been 16
wont 16
to 16
applaud 16
at 16
the 16
stage 16
plays 16
knew 16
more 16
of 16
the 16
gardens 16
at 16
the 16
nearest 16
restaurant 16
than 16
of 16
the 16
battlefield 16
horses 16
were 16
hairy 16
from 16
lack 16
of 16
grooming 16
horsemen 16
smooth 16
because 16
their 16
hairs 16
had 16
been 16
pulled 16
out 16
by 16
the 16
roots 16
a 16
rare 16
thing 16
it 16
was 16
to 16
see 16
a 16
soldier 16
with 16
hair 16
on 16
arm 16
or 16
leg 16
moreover 16
they 16
were 16
better 16
drest 16
than 16
armed 16
so 16
much 16
so 16
that 16
laelianus 16
pontius 16
a 16
strict 16
man 16
of 16
the 16
old 16
discipline 16
broke 16
the 16
cuirasses 16
of 16
some 16
of 16
them 16
with 16
his 16
fingertips 16
and 16
observed 16
cushions 16
on 16
the 16

neither 16

delicate 16
in 16

in 16

only 16
one 16
son 16
survived 16

we 16
find 16
echoes 16
of 16
this 16
affection 16
now 16

again 16

well 16
if 16
i 16
may 16
say 16

it 16

bracing 16
climate 16
of 16
spring 16
to 16
us 16
when 16
little 16

brings 16
more 16
and 16
more 16
infirmity 16
marcus 16

even 16
more 16
solicitous 16
for 16

the 16
poor 16
old 16
man 16
suffered 16

heavy 16

his 16
grandson 16

marcus 16
writes 16
i 16
have 16
just 16
heard 16
of 16
your 16
misfortune 16
feeling 16
grieved 16
as 16
i 16
do 16
when 16
one 16
of 16

you 16

reply 16

of 16
a 16
certain 16
selfconsciousness 16
is 16
full 16
of 16
pathos 16
he 16
recounts 16
with 16
pride 16
the 16
events 16
of 16
a 16
long 16
and 16
upright 16
life 16
in 16
which 16
he 16
has 16
wronged 16
no 16
man 16

lived 16
in 16
harmony 16
with 16
his 16
friends 16
and 16
family 16
his 16
affectations 16
fall 16
away 16
from 16
him 16
as 16
the 16
cry 16
of 16
pain 16
is 16
forced 16
from 16
his 16
heart 16
many 16
such 16
sorrows 16
has 16
fortune 16
visited 16
me 16
with 16
all 16
my 16

to 16
pass 16
by 16
my 16
other 16
afflictions 16
i 16

lost 16
five 16
children 16
under 16
the 16
most 16
pitiful 16
conditions 16
possible 16
for 16
the 16
five 16
i 16
lost 16
one 16
by 16
one 16
when 16
each 16
was 16
my 16
only 16
child 16
suffering 16
these 16
blows 16
of 16
bereavement 16
in 16
such 16
a 16
manner 16
that 16
each 16
child 16
was 16
born 16
to 16
one 16
already 16
bereaved 16
thus 16
i 16
ever 16
lost 16
my 16
children 16
without 16
solace 16
and 16
got 16
them 16
amidst 16
fresh 16
grief 16
the 16
letter 16
continues 16
with 16
reflections 16
on 16
the 16
nature 16
of 16
death 16
more 16
to 16
be 16
rejoiced 16
at 16
than 16
bewailed 16
the 16
younger 16
one 16
dies 16
and 16
an 16
arraignment 16
of 16
providence 16
not 16
without 16
dignity 16
wrung 16
from 16
him 16
as 16
it 16
were 16
by 16
this 16
last 16
culminating 16
misfortune 16
it 16
concludes 16
with 16
a 16
summingup 16
of 16
his 16
life 16

protest 16

blow 16
which 16

i 16
were 16
made 16
of 16
iron 16
at 16
this 16
tine 16
i 16
could 16
write 16
no 16
more 16
it 16
is 16
noteworthy 16
that 16
in 16
his 16
meditations 16
marcus 16
aurelius 16
mentions 16
fronto 16
only 16
once 16
all 16
his 16
literary 16
studies 16
his 16
oratory 16
and 16
criticism 16
such 16
as 16
it 16
was 16
is 16
forgotten 16
and 16
says 16
he 16
fronto 16
taught 16
me 16
not 16
to 16
expect 16
natural 16
affection 16
from 16
the 16
highlyborn 16
fronto 16
really 16
said 16
more 16
than 16
this 16
that 16
affection 16
is 16
not 16
a 16
roman 16
quality 16
nor 16
has 16
it 16
a 16
latin 16
name 16
roman 16
or 16
not 16
roman 16
marcus 16
found 16
affection 16
in 16
fronto 16
and 16
if 16
he 16
outgrew 16
his 16
masters 16
intellectual 16
training 16
he 16
never 16
lost 16
touch 16
with 16
the 16
true 16
heart 16
of 16
the 16
man 16
it 16
is 16
that 16
which 16
frontos 16
name 16
brings 16
up 16
to 16
his 16
remembrance 16
not 16
dissertations 16
on 16
compound 16
verbs 16
or 16
fatuous 16

in 16
mind 16
that 16

often 16
rather 16
a 16
paraphrase 16

a 16

it 16

still 17

the 17
piles 17
of 17
ash 17
left 17
by 17
the 17
attack 17
they 17
shift 17
here 17
and 17
there 17
in 17
reaction 17
to 17
my 17
footsteps 17
no 17
breeze 17
to 17
scatter 17
them 17
i 17
keep 17
my 17
eyes 17
on 17
what 17
i 17
remember 17
as 17
the 17
road 17
because 17
when 17
i 17
first 17
landed 17
in 17
the 17
meadow 17
i 17
wasnt 17
careful 17
and 17
i 17
walked 17
right 17
into 17
a 17
rock 17
only 17
it 17
wasnt 17
a 17
rockit 17
was 17
someones 17
skull 17
it 17
rolled 17
over 17
and 17
over 17
and 17
landed 17
faceup 17
and 17
for 17
a 17
long 17
time 17
i 17
couldnt 17
stop 17
looking 17
at 17
the 17
teeth 17
wondering 17
whose 17
they 17
were 17
thinking 17
of 17
how 17
mine 17
would 17
probably 17
look 17
the 17
same 17
way 17
under 17
similar 17
circumstances 17
i 17
stick 17
to 17
the 17
road 17
out 17
of 17
habit 17
but 17
its 17
a 17
bad 17
choice 17
because 17
its 17
full 17
of 17
the 17
remains 17
of 17
those 17
who 17
tried 17
to 17
flee 17
some 17
were 17
incinerated 17
entirely 17
but 17
others 17
probably 17
overcome 17
with 17
smoke 17
escaped 17
the 17
worst 17
of 17
the 17
flames 17
and 17
now 17
lie 17
reeking 17
in 17
various 17
states 17
of 17
decomposition 17
carrion 17
for 17
scavengers 17
blanketed 17
by 17
flies 17
i 17
killed 17
you 17
i 17
think 17
as 17
i 17
pass 17
a 17
pile 17
and 17
you 17
and 17
you 17
because 17
i 17
did 17
it 17
was 17
my 17
arrow 17
aimed 17
at 17
the 17
chink 17
in 17
the 17
force 17
field 17
surrounding 17
the 17
arena 17
that 17
brought 17
on 17
this 17
firestorm 17
of 17
retribution 17
that 17
sent 17
the 17
whole 17
country 17
of 17
panem 17
into 17
chaos 17
in 17
my 17
head 17
i 17
hear 17
president 17
snows 17
words 17
spoken 17
the 17
morning 17
i 17
was 17
to 17
begin 17
the 17
victory 17
tour 17
katniss 17
everdeen 17
the 17
girl 17
who 17
was 17
on 17
fire 17
you 17
have 17
provided 17
a 17
spark 17
that 17
left 17
unattended 17
may 17
grow 17
to 17
an 17
inferno 17
that 17
destroys 17
panem 17
it 17
turns 17
out 17
he 17
wasnt 17
exaggerating 17
or 17
simply 17
trying 17
to 17
scare 17
me 17
he 17
was 17
perhaps 17
genuinely 17
attempting 17
to 17
enlist 17
my 17
help 17
but 17
i 17
had 17
already 17
set 17
something 17
in 17
motion 17
that 17
i 17
had 17
no 17
ability 17
to 17
control 17
burning 17
still 17
burning 17
i 17
think 17
numbly 17
the 17
fires 17
at 17
the 17
coal 17
mines 17
belch 17
black 17
smoke 17
in 17
the 17
distance 17
theres 17
no 17
one 17
left 17
to 17
care 17
though 17
more 17
than 17
ninety 17
percent 17
of 17
the 17
districts 17
population 17
is 17
dead 17
the 17
remaining 17
eight 17
hundred 17
or 17
so 17
are 17
refugees 17
in 17
district 17
which 17
as 17
far 17
as 17
im 17
concerned 17
is 17
the 17
same 17
thing 17
as 17
being 17
homeless 17
forever 17
i 17
know 17
i 17
shouldnt 17
think 17
that 17
i 17
know 17
i 17
should 17
be 17
grateful 17
for 17
the 17
way 17
we 17
have 17
been 17
welcomed 17
sick 17
wounded 17
starving 17
and 17
emptyhanded 17
still 17
i 17
can 17
never 17
get 17
around 17
the 17
fact 17
that 17
district 17
was 17
instrumental 17
in 17
s 17
destruction 17
this 17
doesnt 17
absolve 17
me 17
of 17
blametheres 17
plenty 17
of 17
blame 17
to 17
go 17
around 17
but 17
without 17
them 17
i 17
would 17
not 17
have 17
been 17
part 17
of 17
a 17
larger 17
plot 17
to 17
overthrow 17
the 17
capitol 17
or 17
had 17
the 17
wherewithal 17
to 17
do 17
it 17
the 17
citizens 17
of 17
district 17
had 17
no 17
organized 17
resistance 17
movement 17
of 17
their 17
own 17
no 17
say 17
in 17
any 17
of 17
this 17
they 17
only 17
had 17
the 17
misfortune 17
to 17
have 17
me 17
some 17
survivors 17
think 17
its 17
good 17
luck 17
though 17
to 17
be 17
free 17
of 17
district 17
at 17
last 17
to 17
have 17
escaped 17
the 17
endless 17
hunger 17
and 17
oppression 17
the 17
perilous 17
mines 17
the 17
lash 17
of 17
our 17
final 17
head 17
peacekeeper 17
romulus 17
thread 17
to 17
have 17
a 17
new 17
home 17
at 17
all 17
is 17
seen 17
as 17
a 17
wonder 17
since 17
up 17
until 17
a 17
short 17
time 17
ago 17
we 17
hadnt 17
even 17
known 17
that 17
district 17
still 17
existed 17
the 17
credit 17
for 17
the 17
survivors 17
escape 17
has 17
landed 17
squarely 17
on 17
gales 17
shoulders 17
although 17
hes 17
loath 17
to 17
accept 17
it 17
as 17
soon 17
as 17
the 17
quarter 17
quell 17
was 17
overas 17
soon 17
as 17
i 17
had 17
been 17
lifted 17
from 17
the 17
arenathe 17
electricity 17
in 17
district 17
was 17
cut 17
the 17
televisions 17
went 17
black 17
and 17
the 17
seam 17
became 17
so 17
silent 17
people 17
could 17
hear 17
one 17
anothers 17
heartbeats 17
no 17
one 17
did 17
anything 17
to 17
protest 17
or 17
celebrate 17
what 17
had 17
happened 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
yet 17
within 17
fifteen 17
minutes 17
the 17
sky 17
was 17
filled 17
with 17
hoverplanes 17
and 17
the 17
bombs 17
were 17
raining 17
down 17
it 17
was 17
gale 17
who 17
thought 17
of 17
the 17
meadow 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
few 17
places 17
not 17
filled 17
with 17
old 17
wooden 17
homes 17
embedded 17
with 17
coal 17
dust 17
he 17
herded 17
those 17
he 17
could 17
in 17
its 17
direction 17
including 17
my 17
mother 17
and 17
prim 17
he 17
formed 17
the 17
team 17
that 17
pulled 17
down 17
the 17
fencenow 17
just 17
a 17
harmless 17
chainlink 17
barrier 17
with 17
the 17
electricity 17
offand 17
led 17
the 17
people 17
into 17
the 17
woods 17
he 17
took 17
them 17
to 17
the 17
only 17
place 17
he 17
could 17
think 17
of 17
the 17
lake 17
my 17
father 17
had 17
shown 17
me 17
as 17
a 17
child 17
and 17
it 17
was 17
from 17
there 17
they 17
watched 17
the 17
distant 17
flames 17
eat 17
up 17
everything 17
they 17
knew 17
in 17
the 17
world 17
by 17
dawn 17
the 17
bombers 17
were 17
long 17
gone 17
the 17
fires 17
dying 17
the 17
final 17
stragglers 17
rounded 17
up 17
my 17
mother 17
and 17
prim 17
had 17
set 17
up 17
a 17
medical 17
area 17
for 17
the 17
injured 17
and 17
were 17
attempting 17
to 17
treat 17
them 17
with 17
whatever 17
they 17
could 17
glean 17
from 17
the 17
woods 17
gale 17
had 17
two 17
sets 17
of 17
bows 17
and 17
arrows 17
one 17
hunting 17
knife 17
one 17
fishing 17
net 17
and 17
over 17
eight 17
hundred 17
terrified 17
people 17
to 17
feed 17
with 17
the 17
help 17
of 17
those 17
who 17
were 17
ablebodied 17
they 17
managed 17
for 17
three 17
days 17
and 17
thats 17
when 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
unexpectedly 17
arrived 17
to 17
evacuate 17
them 17
to 17
district 17
where 17
there 17
were 17
more 17
than 17
enough 17
clean 17
white 17
living 17
compartments 17
plenty 17
of 17
clothing 17
and 17
three 17
meals 17
a 17
day 17
the 17
compartments 17
had 17
the 17
disadvantage 17
of 17
being 17
underground 17
the 17
clothing 17
was 17
identical 17
and 17
the 17
food 17
was 17
relatively 17
tasteless 17
but 17
for 17
the 17
refugees 17
of 17
these 17
were 17
minor 17
considerations 17
they 17
were 17
safe 17
they 17
were 17
being 17
cared 17
for 17
they 17
were 17
alive 17
and 17
eagerly 17
welcomed 17
this 17
enthusiasm 17
was 17
interpreted 17
as 17
kindness 17
but 17
a 17
man 17
named 17
dalton 17
a 17
district 17
refugee 17
whod 17
made 17
it 17
to 17
on 17
foot 17
a 17
few 17
years 17
ago 17
leaked 17
the 17
real 17
motive 17
to 17
me 17
they 17
need 17
you 17
me 17
they 17
need 17
us 17
all 17
awhile 17
back 17
there 17
was 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
pox 17
epidemic 17
that 17
killed 17
a 17
bunch 17
of 17
them 17
and 17
left 17
a 17
lot 17
more 17
infertile 17
new 17
breeding 17
stock 17
thats 17
how 17
they 17
see 17
us 17
back 17
in 17
hed 17
worked 17
on 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
beef 17
ranches 17
maintaining 17
the 17
genetic 17
diversity 17
of 17
the 17
herd 17
with 17
the 17
implantation 17
of 17
longfrozen 17
cow 17
embryos 17
hes 17
very 17
likely 17
right 17
about 17
because 17
there 17
dont 17
seem 17
to 17
be 17
nearly 17
enough 17
kids 17
around 17
but 17
so 17
what 17
were 17
not 17
being 17
kept 17
in 17
pens 17
were 17
being 17

for 17
work 17
the 17
children 17

are 17
addressed 17
respectfully 17
as 17
soldier 17
every 17
single 17
refugee 17
was 17
granted 17
automatic 17
citizenship 17
by 17
the 17
authorities 17
of 17
still 17
i 17
hate 17
them 17
but 17
of 17
course 17
i 17
hate 17
almost 17
everybody 17
now 17
myself 17
more 17
than 17
anyone 17
the 17
surface 17
beneath 17
my 17
feet 17
hardens 17
and 17
under 17
the 17
carpet 17
of 17
ash 17
i 17
feel 17
the 17
paving 17
stones 17
of 17
the 17
square 17
around 17
the 17
perimeter 17
is 17
a 17
shallow 17
border 17
of 17
refuse 17
where 17
the 17
shops 17
stood 17
a 17
heap 17
of 17
blackened 17
rubble 17
has 17
replaced 17
the 17
justice 17
building 17
i 17
walk 17
to 17
the 17
approximate 17
site 17
of 17
the 17
bakery 17
peetas 17
family 17
owned 17
nothing 17
much 17
left 17
but 17
the 17
melted 17
lump 17
of 17
the 17
oven 17
peetas 17
parents 17
his 17
two 17
older 17
brothersnone 17
of 17
them 17
made 17
it 17
to 17
fewer 17
than 17
a 17
dozen 17
of 17
what 17
passed 17
for 17
district 17
s 17
welltodo 17
escaped 17
the 17
fire 17
peeta 17

have 17
nothing 17
to 17
come 17
home 17
to 17
anyway 17
except 17
me 17
i 17
back 17
away 17
from 17
the 17
bakery 17
and 17
bump 17
into 17
something 17
lose 17
my 17
balance 17
and 17
find 17
myself 17
sitting 17
on 17
a 17
hunk 17
of 17
sunheated 17
metal 17
i 17
puzzle 17
over 17
what 17
it 17
might 17
have 17
been 17
then 17
remember 17
threads 17
recent 17
renovations 17
of 17
the 17
square 17
stocks 17
whipping 17
posts 17
and 17
this 17
the 17
remains 17
of 17
the 17
gallows 17
bad 17
this 17
is 17
bad 17
it 17
brings 17

my 17
shirt 17
up 17
over 17

not 17
wondering 17
what 17

threatens 17
to 17
choke 17
me 17
the 17
grass 17
has 17
been 17
scorched 17
and 17
the 17
gray 17
snow 17
fell 17
here 17
as 17
well 17

the 17
twelve 17
fine 17

an 17
unbroken 17

to 17
her 17
shoulders 17
im 17
somewhat 17
fascinated 17
by 17
her 17
hair 17
since 17
its 17
so 17
uniform 17

from 17
the 17
seam 17
theyre 17
very 17
pale 17
as 17
if 17
almost 17
all 17
the 17
color 17
has 17
been 17
sucked 17
out 17
of 17
them 17
the 17
color 17
of 17
slush 17
that 17
you 17
wish 17
would 17
melt 17
away 17
what 17
they 17
want 17
is 17
for 17
me 17
to 17
truly 17
take 17
on 17
the 17
role 17
they 17
designed 17
for 17
me 17
the 17
symbol 17
of 17
the 17
revolution 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
it 17
isnt 17
enough 17
what 17
ive 17
done 17
in 17
the 17
past 17
defying 17
the 17
capitol 17
in 17
the 17
games 17
providing 17
a 17
rallying 17
point 17
i 17
must 17
now 17
become 17
the 17
actual 17
leader 17
the 17
face 17
the 17
voice 17
the 17
embodiment 17
of 17
the 17
revolution 17
the 17
person 17
who 17
the 17
districtsmost 17
of 17
which 17
are 17
now 17
openly 17
at 17
war 17
with 17
the 17
capitolcan 17
count 17
on 17
to 17
blaze 17
the 17
path 17
to 17
victory 17
i 17
wont 17
have 17
to 17
do 17
it 17
alone 17
they 17
have 17
a 17
whole 17
team 17
of 17
people 17
to 17
make 17
me 17
over 17
dress 17
me 17
write 17
my 17
speeches 17
orchestrate 17
my 17
appearancesas 17
if 17
that 17
doesnt 17
sound 17
horribly 17
familiar 17
and 17
all 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
do 17
is 17
play 17
my 17
part 17
sometimes 17
i 17
listen 17
to 17
them 17
and 17
sometimes 17
i 17
just 17
watch 17
the 17
perfect 17
line 17
of 17
coins 17
hair 17
and 17
try 17
to 17
decide 17
if 17
its 17
a 17
wig 17
eventually 17
i 17
leave 17
the 17
room 17
because 17
my 17
head 17
starts 17
to 17
ache 17
or 17
its 17
time 17
to 17
eat 17
or 17
if 17
i 17
dont 17
get 17
aboveground 17
i 17
might 17
start 17
screaming 17
i 17
dont 17
bother 17
to 17
say 17
anything 17
i 17
simply 17
get 17
up 17
and 17
walk 17
out 17
yesterday 17
afternoon 17
as 17
the 17
door 17
was 17
closing 17
behind 17
me 17
i 17
heard 17
coin 17
say 17
i 17
told 17
you 17
we 17
should 17
have 17
rescued 17
the 17
boy 17
first 17
meaning 17
peeta 17
i 17
couldnt 17
agree 17
more 17
he 17
wouldve 17
been 17
an 17
excellent 17
mouthpiece 17
and 17
who 17
did 17
they 17
fish 17
out 17
of 17
the 17
arena 17
instead 17
me 17
who 17
wont 17
cooperate 17
beetee 17
an 17
older 17
inventor 17
from 17
who 17
i 17
rarely 17
see 17
because 17
he 17
was 17
pulled 17
into 17
weapons 17
development 17
the 17
minute 17
he 17
could 17
sit 17
upright 17
literally 17
they 17
wheeled 17
his 17
hospital 17
bed 17
into 17
some 17
top 17
secret 17
area 17
and 17
now 17
he 17
only 17
occasionally 17
shows 17
up 17
for 17
meals 17
hes 17
very 17
smart 17
and 17
very 17
willing 17
to 17
help 17
the 17
cause 17
but 17
not 17
really 17
firebrand 17
material 17
then 17
theres 17
finnick 17
odair 17
the 17
sex 17
symbol 17
from 17
the 17
fishing 17
district 17
who 17
kept 17
peeta 17
alive 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
when 17
i 17
couldnt 17
they 17
want 17
to 17
transform 17
finnick 17
into 17
a 17
rebel 17
leader 17
as 17
well 17
but 17
first 17
theyll 17
have 17
to 17
get 17
him 17
to 17
stay 17
awake 17
for 17
more 17
than 17
five 17
minutes 17
even 17
when 17
he 17
is 17
conscious 17
you 17
have 17
to 17
say 17
everything 17
to 17
him 17
three 17
times 17
to 17
get 17
through 17
to 17
his 17
brain 17
the 17
doctors 17
say 17
its 17
from 17
the 17
electrical 17
shock 17
he 17
received 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
but 17
i 17
know 17
its 17
a 17
lot 17
more 17
complicated 17
than 17
that 17
i 17
know 17
that 17
finnick 17
cant 17
focus 17
on 17
anything 17
in 17
because 17
hes 17
trying 17
so 17
hard 17
to 17
see 17
whats 17
happening 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
to 17
annie 17
the 17
mad 17
girl 17
from 17
his 17
district 17
whos 17
the 17
only 17
person 17
on 17
earth 17
he 17
loves 17
despite 17
serious 17
reservations 17
i 17
had 17
to 17
forgive 17
finnick 17
for 17
his 17
role 17
in 17
the 17
conspiracy 17
that 17
landed 17
me 17
here 17
he 17
at 17
least 17
has 17
some 17
idea 17
of 17
what 17
im 17
going 17
through 17
and 17
it 17
takes 17
too 17
much 17
energy 17
to 17
stay 17
angry 17
with 17
someone 17
who 17
cries 17
so 17
much 17
i 17
move 17
through 17
the 17
downstairs 17
on 17
hunters 17
feet 17
reluctant 17
to 17
make 17
any 17
sound 17
i 17
pick 17
up 17
a 17
few 17
remembrances 17
a 17
photo 17
of 17
my 17
parents 17
on 17
their 17
wedding 17
day 17
a 17
blue 17
hair 17
ribbon 17
for 17
prim 17
the 17
family 17
book 17
of 17
medicinal 17
and 17
edible 17
plants 17
the 17
book 17
falls 17
open 17
to 17
a 17
page 17
with 17
yellow 17
flowers 17
and 17
i 17
shut 17
it 17
quickly 17
because 17
it 17
was 17
peetas 17
brush 17
that 17
painted 17
them 17
what 17
am 17
i 17
going 17
to 17
do 17
is 17
there 17
any 17
point 17
in 17
doing 17
anything 17
at 17
all 17
my 17
mother 17
my 17
sister 17
and 17
gales 17
family 17
are 17
finally 17
safe 17
as 17
for 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
people 17
are 17
either 17
dead 17
which 17
is 17
irreversible 17
or 17
protected 17
in 17
that 17
leaves 17
the 17
rebels 17
in 17
the 17
districts 17
of 17
course 17
i 17
hate 17
the 17
capitol 17
but 17
i 17
have 17
no 17
confidence 17
that 17
my 17
being 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
will 17
benefit 17
those 17
who 17
are 17
trying 17
to 17
bring 17
it 17
down 17
how 17
can 17
i 17
help 17
the 17
districts 17
when 17
every 17
time 17
i 17
make 17
a 17
move 17
it 17
results 17
in 17
suffering 17
and 17
loss 17
of 17
life 17
the 17
old 17
man 17
shot 17
in 17
district 17
for 17
whistling 17
the 17
crackdown 17
in 17
after 17
i 17
intervened 17
in 17
gales 17
whipping 17
my 17
stylist 17
cinna 17
being 17
dragged 17
bloody 17
and 17
unconscious 17
from 17
the 17
launch 17
room 17
before 17
the 17
games 17
plutarchs 17
sources 17
believe 17
he 17
was 17
killed 17
during 17
interrogation 17
brilliant 17
enigmatic 17
lovely 17
cinna 17
is 17
dead 17
because 17
of 17
me 17
i 17
push 17
the 17
thought 17
away 17
because 17
its 17
too 17
impossibly 17
painful 17
to 17
dwell 17
on 17
without 17
losing 17
my 17
fragile 17
hold 17
on 17
the 17
situation 17
entirely 17
what 17
am 17
i 17
going 17
to 17
do 17
to 17
become 17
the 17
mockingjaycould 17
any 17
good 17
i 17
do 17
possibly 17
outweigh 17
the 17
damage 17
who 17
can 17
i 17
trust 17
to 17
answer 17
that 17
question 17
certainly 17
not 17
that 17
crew 17
in 17
i 17
swear 17
now 17
that 17
my 17
family 17
and 17
gales 17
are 17
out 17
of 17
harms 17
way 17
i 17
could 17
run 17
away 17
except 17
for 17
one 17
unfinished 17
piece 17
of 17
business 17
peeta 17
if 17
i 17
knew 17
for 17
sure 17
that 17
he 17
was 17
dead 17
i 17
could 17
just 17
disappear 17
into 17
the 17
woods 17
and 17
never 17
look 17
back 17
but 17
until 17
i 17
do 17
im 17
stuck 17
i 17
spin 17
on 17
my 17
heel 17
at 17
the 17
sound 17
of 17
a 17
hiss 17
in 17
the 17
kitchen 17
doorway 17
back 17
arched 17
ears 17
flattened 17
stands 17
the 17
ugliest 17
tomcat 17
in 17
the 17
world 17
buttercup 17
i 17
say 17
thousands 17
of 17
people 17
are 17
dead 17
but 17
he 17
has 17
survived 17
and 17
even 17
looks 17
well 17
fed 17
on 17
what 17
he 17
can 17
get 17
in 17
and 17
out 17
of 17
the 17
house 17
through 17
a 17
window 17
we 17
always 17
left 17
ajar 17
in 17
the 17
pantry 17
he 17
must 17
have 17
been 17
eating 17
field 17
mice 17
i 17
refuse 17
to 17
consider 17
the 17
alternative 17
i 17
squat 17
down 17
and 17
extend 17
a 17
hand 17
come 17
here 17
boy 17
not 17
likely 17
hes 17
angry 17
at 17
his 17
abandonment 17
besides 17
im 17
not 17
offering 17
food 17
and 17
my 17
ability 17
to 17
provide 17
scraps 17
has 17
always 17
been 17
my 17
main 17
redeeming 17
quality 17
to 17
him 17
for 17
a 17
while 17
when 17
we 17
used 17
to 17
meet 17
up 17
at 17
the 17
old 17
house 17
because 17
we 17
both 17
disliked 17
this 17
new 17
one 17
we 17
seemed 17
to 17
be 17
bonding 17
a 17
little 17
thats 17
clearly 17
over 17
he 17
blinks 17
those 17
unpleasant 17
yellow 17
eyes 17
want 17
to 17
see 17
prim 17
i 17
ask 17
her 17
name 17
catches 17
his 17
attention 17
besides 17
his 17
own 17
its 17
the 17
only 17
word 17
that 17
means 17
anything 17
to 17
him 17
he 17
gives 17
a 17
rusty 17
meow 17
and 17
approaches 17
me 17
i 17
pick 17
him 17
up 17
stroking 17
his 17
fur 17
then 17
go 17
to 17
the 17
closet 17
and 17
dig 17
out 17
my 17
game 17
bag 17
and 17
unceremoniously 17
stuff 17
him 17
in 17
theres 17
no 17
other 17
way 17
ill 17
be 17
able 17
to 17
carry 17
him 17
on 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
and 17
he 17
means 17
the 17
world 17
to 17
my 17
sister 17
her 17
goat 17
lady 17
an 17
animal 17
of 17
actual 17
value 17
has 17
unfortunately 17
not 17
made 17
an 17
appearance 17
in 17
my 17
headset 17
i 17
hear 17
gales 17
voice 17
telling 17
me 17
we 17
must 17
go 17
back 17
but 17
the 17
game 17
bag 17
has 17
reminded 17
me 17
of 17
one 17
more 17
thing 17
that 17
i 17
want 17
i 17
sling 17
the 17
strap 17
of 17
the 17
bag 17
over 17
the 17
back 17
of 17
a 17
chair 17
and 17
dash 17
up 17
the 17
steps 17
to 17
my 17
bedroom 17
inside 17
the 17
closet 17
hangs 17
my 17
fathers 17
hunting 17
jacket 17
before 17
the 17
quell 17
i 17
brought 17
it 17
here 17
from 17
the 17
old 17
house 17
thinking 17
its 17
presence 17
might 17
be 17
of 17
comfort 17
to 17
my 17
mother 17
and 17
sister 17
when 17
i 17
was 17
dead 17
thank 17
goodness 17
or 17
itd 17
be 17
ash 17
now 17
the 17
soft 17
leather 17
feels 17
soothing 17
and 17
for 17
a 17
moment 17
im 17
calmed 17
by 17
the 17
memories 17
of 17
the 17
hours 17
spent 17
wrapped 17
in 17
it 17
then 17
inexplicably 17
my 17
palms 17
begin 17
to 17
sweat 17
a 17
strange 17
sensation 17
creeps 17
up 17
the 17
back 17
of 17
my 17
neck 17
i 17
whip 17
around 17
to 17
face 17
the 17
room 17
and 17
find 17
it 17
empty 17
tidy 17
everything 17
in 17
its 17
place 17
there 17
was 17
no 17
sound 17
to 17
alarm 17
me 17
what 17
then 17
my 17
nose 17
twitches 17
its 17
the 17
smell 17
cloying 17
and 17
artificial 17
a 17
dab 17
of 17
white 17
peeks 17
out 17
of 17
a 17
vase 17
of 17
dried 17
flowers 17
on 17
my 17
dresser 17
i 17
approach 17
it 17
with 17
cautious 17
steps 17
there 17
all 17
but 17
obscured 17
by 17
its 17
preserved 17
cousins 17
is 17
a 17
fresh 17
white 17
rose 17
perfect 17
down 17
to 17
the 17
last 17
thorn 17
and 17
silken 17
petal 17
and 17
i 17
know 17
immediately 17
whos 17
sent 17
it 17
to 17
me 17
president 17
snow 17
when 17
i 17
begin 17
to 17
gag 17
at 17
the 17
stench 17
i 17
back 17
away 17
and 17
clear 17
out 17
how 17
long 17
has 17
it 17
been 17
here 17
a 17
day 17
an 17
hour 17
the 17
rebels 17
did 17
a 17
security 17
sweep 17
of 17
the 17
victors 17
village 17
before 17
i 17
was 17
cleared 17
to 17
come 17
here 17
checking 17
for 17
explosives 17
bugs 17
anything 17
unusual 17
but 17
perhaps 17
the 17
rose 17
didnt 17
seem 17
noteworthy 17
to 17
them 17
only 17
to 17
me 17
downstairs 17
i 17
snag 17
the 17
game 17
bag 17
off 17
the 17
chair 17
bouncing 17
it 17
along 17
the 17
floor 17
until 17
i 17
remember 17
its 17
occupied 17
on 17
the 17
lawn 17
i 17
frantically 17
signal 17
to 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
while 17
buttercup 17
thrashes 17
i 17
jab 17
him 17
with 17
my 17
elbow 17
but 17
this 17
only 17
infuriates 17
him 17
a 17
hovercraft 17
materializes 17
and 17
a 17
ladder 17
drops 17
down 17
i 17
step 17
on 17
and 17
the 17
current 17
freezes 17
me 17
until 17
im 17
lifted 17
on 17
board 17
gale 17
helps 17
me 17
from 17
the 17
ladder 17
you 17
all 17
right 17
yeah 17
i 17
say 17
wiping 17
the 17
sweat 17
off 17
my 17
face 17
with 17
my 17
sleeve 17
he 17
left 17
me 17
a 17
rose 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
scream 17
but 17
its 17
not 17
information 17
im 17
sure 17
i 17
should 17
share 17
with 17
someone 17
like 17
plutarch 17
looking 17
on 17
first 17
of 17
all 17
because 17
it 17
will 17
make 17
me 17
sound 17
crazy 17
like 17
i 17
either 17
imagined 17
it 17
which 17
is 17
quite 17
possible 17
or 17
im 17
overreacting 17
which 17
will 17
buy 17
me 17
a 17
trip 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
druginduced 17
dreamland 17
im 17
trying 17
so 17
hard 17
to 17
escape 17
no 17
one 17
will 17
fully 17
understandhow 17
its 17
not 17
just 17
a 17
flower 17
not 17
even 17
just 17
president 17
snows 17
flower 17
but 17
a 17
promise 17
of 17
revengebecause 17
no 17
one 17
else 17
sat 17
in 17
the 17
study 17
with 17
him 17
when 17
he 17
threatened 17
me 17
before 17
the 17
victory 17
tour 17
positioned 17
on 17
my 17
dresser 17
that 17
whiteassnow 17
rose 17
is 17
a 17
personal 17
message 17
to 17
me 17
it 17
speaks 17
of 17
unfinished 17
business 17
it 17
whispers 17
i 17
can 17
find 17
you 17
i 17
can 17
reach 17
you 17
perhaps 17
i 17
am 17
watching 17
you 17
now 17
are 17
there 17
capitol 17
hoverplanes 17
speeding 17
in 17
to 17
blow 17
us 17
out 17
of 17
the 17
sky 17
as 17
we 17
travel 17
over 17
district 17
i 17
watch 17
anxiously 17
for 17
signs 17
of 17
an 17
attack 17
but 17
nothing 17
pursues 17
us 17
after 17
several 17
minutes 17
when 17
i 17
hear 17
an 17
exchange 17
between 17
plutarch 17
and 17
the 17
pilot 17
confirming 17
that 17
the 17
airspace 17
is 17
clear 17
i 17
begin 17
to 17
relax 17
a 17
little 17
gale 17
nods 17
at 17
the 17
howls 17
coming 17
from 17
my 17
game 17
bag 17
now 17
i 17
know 17
why 17
you 17
had 17
to 17
go 17
back 17
if 17
there 17
was 17
even 17
a 17
chance 17
of 17
his 17
recovery 17
i 17
dump 17
the 17
bag 17
onto 17
a 17
seat 17
where 17
the 17
loathsome 17
creature 17
begins 17
a 17
low 17
deepthroated 17
growl 17
oh 17
shut 17
up 17
i 17
tell 17
the 17
bag 17
as 17
i 17
sink 17
into 17
the 17
cushioned 17
window 17
seat 17
across 17
from 17
it 17
gale 17
sits 17
next 17
to 17
me 17
pretty 17
bad 17
down 17
there 17
couldnt 17
be 17
much 17
worse 17
i 17
answer 17
i 17
look 17
in 17
his 17
eyes 17
and 17
see 17
my 17
own 17
grief 17
reflected 17
there 17
our 17
hands 17
find 17
each 17
other 17
holding 17
fast 17
to 17
a 17
part 17
of 17
that 17
snow 17
has 17
somehow 17
failed 17
to 17
destroy 17
we 17
sit 17
in 17
silence 17
for 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
trip 17
to 17
which 17
only 17
takes 17
about 17
fortyfive 17
minutes 17
a 17
mere 17
weeks 17
journey 17
on 17
foot 17
bonnie 17
and 17
twill 17
the 17
district 17
refugees 17
who 17
i 17
encountered 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
last 17
winter 17
werent 17
so 17
far 17
from 17
their 17
destination 17
after 17
all 17
they 17
apparently 17
didnt 17
make 17
it 17
though 17
when 17
i 17
asked 17
about 17
them 17
in 17
no 17
one 17
seemed 17
to 17
know 17
who 17
i 17
was 17
talking 17
about 17
died 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
i 17
guess 17
from 17
the 17
air 17
looks 17
about 17
as 17
cheerful 17
as 17
the 17
rubble 17
isnt 17
smoking 17
the 17
way 17
the 17
capitol 17
shows 17
it 17
on 17
television 17
but 17
theres 17
next 17
to 17
no 17
life 17
aboveground 17
in 17
the 17
seventyfive 17
years 17
since 17
the 17
dark 17
dayswhen 17
was 17
said 17
to 17
have 17
been 17
obliterated 17
in 17
the 17
war 17
between 17
the 17
capitol 17
and 17
the 17
districtsalmost 17
all 17
new 17
construction 17
has 17
been 17
beneath 17
the 17
earths 17
surface 17
there 17
was 17
already 17
a 17
substantial 17
underground 17
facility 17
here 17
developed 17
over 17
centuries 17
to 17
be 17
either 17
a 17
clandestine 17
refuge 17
for 17
government 17
leaders 17
in 17
time 17
of 17
war 17
or 17
a 17
last 17
resort 17
for 17
humanity 17
if 17
life 17
above 17
became 17
unlivable 17
most 17
important 17
for 17
the 17
people 17
of 17
it 17
was 17
the 17
center 17
of 17
the 17
capitols 17
nuclear 17
weapons 17
development 17
program 17
during 17
the 17
dark 17
days 17
the 17
rebels 17
in 17
wrested 17
control 17
from 17
the 17
government 17
forces 17
trained 17
their 17
nuclear 17
missiles 17
on 17
the 17
capitol 17
and 17
then 17
struck 17
a 17
bargain 17
they 17
would 17
play 17
dead 17
in 17
exchange 17
for 17
being 17
left 17
alone 17
the 17
capitol 17
had 17
another 17
nuclear 17
arsenal 17
out 17
west 17
but 17
it 17
couldnt 17
attack 17
without 17
certain 17
retaliation 17
it 17
was 17
forced 17
to 17
accept 17
s 17
deal 17
the 17
capitol 17
demolished 17
the 17
visible 17
remains 17
of 17
the 17
district 17
and 17
cut 17
off 17
all 17
access 17
from 17
the 17
outside 17
perhaps 17
the 17
capitols 17
leaders 17
thought 17
that 17
without 17
help 17
would 17
die 17
off 17
on 17
its 17
own 17
it 17
almost 17
did 17
a 17
few 17
times 17
but 17
it 17
always 17
managed 17
to 17
pull 17
through 17
due 17
to 17
strict 17
sharing 17
of 17
resources 17
strenuous 17
discipline 17
and 17
constant 17
vigilance 17
against 17
any 17
further 17
attacks 17
from 17
the 17
capitol 17
now 17
the 17
citizens 17
live 17
almost 17
exclusively 17
underground 17
you 17
can 17
go 17
outside 17
for 17
exercise 17
and 17
sunlight 17
but 17
only 17
at 17
very 17
specific 17
times 17
in 17
your 17
schedule 17
you 17
cant 17
miss 17
your 17
schedule 17
every 17
morning 17
youre 17
supposed 17
to 17
stick 17
your 17
right 17
arm 17
in 17
this 17
contraption 17
in 17
the 17
wall 17
it 17
tattoos 17
the 17
smooth 17
inside 17
of 17
your 17
forearm 17
with 17
your 17
schedule 17
for 17
the 17
day 17
in 17
a 17
sickly 17
purple 17
ink 17
breakfast 17
kitchen 17
duties 17
education 17
center 17
room 17
and 17
so 17
on 17
the 17
ink 17
is 17
indelible 17
until 17
bathing 17
thats 17
when 17
whatever 17
keeps 17
it 17
water 17
resistant 17
breaks 17
down 17
and 17
the 17
whole 17
schedule 17
rinses 17
away 17
the 17
lightsout 17
at 17
signals 17
that 17
everyone 17
not 17
on 17
the 17
night 17
shift 17
should 17
be 17
in 17
bed 17
at 17
first 17
when 17
i 17
was 17
so 17
ill 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17
i 17
could 17
forgo 17
being 17
imprinted 17
but 17
once 17
i 17
moved 17
into 17
compartment 17
with 17
my 17
mother 17
and 17
sister 17
i 17
was 17
expected 17
to 17
get 17
with 17
the 17
program 17
except 17
for 17
showing 17
up 17
for 17
meals 17
though 17
i 17
pretty 17
much 17
ignore 17
the 17
words 17
on 17
my 17
arm 17
i 17
just 17
go 17
back 17
to 17
our 17
compartment 17
or 17
wander 17
around 17
or 17
fall 17
asleep 17
somewhere 17
hidden 17
an 17
abandoned 17
air 17
duct 17
behind 17
the 17
water 17
pipes 17
in 17
the 17
laundry 17
theres 17
a 17
closet 17
in 17
the 17
education 17
center 17
thats 17
great 17
because 17
no 17
one 17
ever 17
seems 17
to 17
need 17
school 17
supplies 17
theyre 17
so 17
frugal 17
with 17
things 17
here 17
waste 17
is 17
practically 17
a 17
criminal 17
activity 17
fortunately 17
the 17
people 17
of 17
have 17
never 17
been 17
wasteful 17
but 17
once 17
i 17
saw 17
fulvia 17
cardew 17
crumple 17
up 17
a 17
sheet 17
of 17
paper 17
with 17
just 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
words 17
written 17
on 17
it 17
and 17
you 17
wouldve 17
thought 17
shed 17
murdered 17
someone 17
from 17
the 17
looks 17
she 17
got 17
her 17
face 17
turned 17
tomato 17
red 17
making 17
the 17
silver 17
flowers 17
inlaid 17
in 17
her 17
plump 17
cheeks 17
even 17
more 17
noticeable 17
the 17
very 17
portrait 17
of 17
excess 17
one 17
of 17
my 17
few 17
pleasures 17
in 17
is 17
watching 17
the 17
handful 17
of 17
pampered 17
capitol 17
rebels 17
squirming 17
as 17
they 17
try 17
to 17
fit 17
in 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
how 17
long 17
ill 17
be 17
able 17
to 17
get 17
away 17
with 17
my 17
complete 17
disregard 17
for 17
the 17
clockwork 17
precision 17
of 17
attendance 17
required 17
by 17
my 17
hosts 17
right 17
now 17
they 17
leave 17
me 17
alone 17
because 17
im 17
classified 17
as 17
mentally 17
disorientedit 17
says 17
so 17
right 17
on 17
my 17
plastic 17
medical 17
braceletand 17
everyone 17
has 17
to 17
tolerate 17
my 17
ramblings 17
but 17
that 17
cant 17
last 17
forever 17
neither 17
can 17
their 17
patience 17
with 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
issue 17
from 17
the 17
landing 17
pad 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
walk 17
down 17
a 17
series 17
of 17
stairways 17
to 17
compartment 17
we 17
could 17
take 17
the 17
elevator 17
only 17
it 17
reminds 17
me 17
too 17
much 17
of 17
the 17
one 17
that 17
lifted 17
me 17
into 17
the 17
arena 17
im 17
having 17
a 17
hard 17
time 17
adjusting 17
to 17
being 17
underground 17
so 17
much 17
but 17
after 17
the 17
surreal 17
encounter 17
with 17
the 17
rose 17
for 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
the 17
descent 17
makes 17
me 17
feel 17
safer 17
i 17
hesitate 17
at 17
the 17
door 17
marked 17
anticipating 17
the 17
questions 17
from 17
my 17
family 17
what 17
am 17
i 17
going 17
to 17
tell 17
them 17
about 17
twelve 17
i 17
ask 17
gale 17
i 17
doubt 17
theyll 17
ask 17
for 17
details 17
they 17
saw 17
it 17
burn 17
theyll 17
mostly 17
be 17
worried 17
about 17
how 17
youre 17
handling 17
it 17
gale 17
touches 17
my 17
cheek 17
like 17
i 17
am 17
i 17
press 17
my 17
face 17
against 17
his 17
hand 17
for 17
a 17
moment 17
ill 17
survive 17
then 17
i 17
take 17
a 17
deep 17
breath 17
and 17
open 17
the 17
door 17
my 17
mother 17
and 17
sister 17
are 17
home 17
for 17
reflection 17
a 17
half 17
hour 17
of 17
downtime 17
before 17
dinner 17
i 17
see 17
the 17
concern 17
on 17
their 17
faces 17
as 17
they 17
try 17
to 17
gauge 17
my 17
emotional 17
state 17
before 17
anyone 17
can 17
ask 17
anything 17
i 17
empty 17
my 17
game 17
bag 17
and 17
it 17
becomes 17
cat 17
adoration 17
prim 17
just 17
sits 17
on 17
the 17
floor 17
weeping 17
and 17
rocking 17
that 17
awful 17
buttercup 17
who 17
interrupts 17
his 17
purring 17
only 17
for 17
an 17
occasional 17
hiss 17
at 17
me 17
he 17
gives 17
me 17
a 17
particularly 17
smug 17
look 17
when 17
she 17
ties 17
the 17
blue 17
ribbon 17
around 17
his 17
neck 17
my 17
mother 17
hugs 17
the 17
wedding 17
photo 17
tightly 17
against 17
her 17
chest 17
and 17
then 17
places 17
it 17
along 17
with 17
the 17
book 17
of 17
plants 17
on 17
our 17
governmentissued 17
chest 17
of 17
drawers 17
i 17
hang 17
my 17
fathers 17
jacket 17
on 17
the 17
back 17
of 17
a 17
chair 17
for 17
a 17
moment 17
the 17
place 17
almost 17
seems 17
like 17
home 17
so 17
i 17
guess 17
the 17
trip 17
to 17
wasnt 17
a 17
complete 17
waste 17
were 17
heading 17
down 17
to 17
the 17
dining 17
hall 17
for 17
dinner 17
when 17
gales 17
communicuff 17
begins 17
to 17
beep 17
it 17
looks 17
like 17
an 17
oversized 17
watch 17
but 17
it 17
receives 17
print 17
messages 17
being 17
granted 17
a 17
communicuff 17
is 17
a 17
special 17
privilege 17
thats 17
reserved 17
for 17
those 17
important 17
to 17
the 17
cause 17
a 17
status 17
gale 17
achieved 17
by 17
his 17
rescue 17
of 17
the 17
citizens 17
of 17
they 17
need 17
the 17
two 17
of 17
us 17
in 17
command 17
he 17
says 17
trailing 17
a 17
few 17
steps 17
behind 17
gale 17
i 17
try 17
to 17
collect 17
myself 17
before 17
im 17
thrown 17
into 17
whats 17
sure 17
to 17
be 17
another 17
relentless 17
mockingjay 17
session 17
i 17
linger 17
in 17
the 17
doorway 17
of 17
command 17
the 17
hightech 17
meetingwar 17
council 17
room 17
complete 17
with 17
computerized 17
talking 17
walls 17
electronic 17
maps 17
showing 17
the 17
troop 17
movements 17
in 17
various 17
districts 17
and 17
a 17
giant 17
rectangular 17
table 17
with 17
control 17
panels 17
im 17
not 17
supposed 17
to 17
touch 17
no 17
one 17
notices 17
me 17
though 17
because 17
theyre 17
all 17
gathered 17
at 17
a 17
television 17
screen 17
at 17
the 17
far 17
end 17
of 17
the 17
room 17
that 17
airs 17
the 17
capitol 17
broadcast 17
around 17
the 17
clock 17
im 17
thinking 17
i 17
might 17
be 17
able 17
to 17
slip 17
away 17
when 17
plutarch 17
whose 17
ample 17
frame 17
has 17
been 17
blocking 17
the 17
television 17
catches 17
sight 17
of 17
me 17
and 17
waves 17
urgently 17
for 17
me 17
to 17
join 17
them 17
i 17
reluctantly 17
move 17
forward 17
trying 17
to 17
imagine 17
how 17
it 17
could 17
be 17
of 17
interest 17
to 17
me 17
its 17
always 17
the 17
same 17
war 17
footage 17
propaganda 17
replaying 17
the 17
bombings 17
of 17
district 17
an 17
ominous 17
message 17
from 17
president 17
snow 17
so 17
its 17
almost 17
entertaining 17
to 17
see 17
caesar 17
flickerman 17
the 17
eternal 17
host 17
of 17
the 17
hunger 17
games 17
with 17
his 17
painted 17
face 17
and 17
sparkly 17
suit 17
preparing 17
to 17
give 17
an 17
interview 17
until 17
the 17
camera 17
pulls 17
back 17
and 17
i 17
see 17
that 17
his 17
guest 17
is 17
peeta 17
a 17
sound 17
escapes 17
me 17
the 17
same 17
combination 17
of 17
gasp 17
and 17
groan 17
that 17
comes 17
from 17
being 17
submerged 17
in 17
water 17
deprived 17
of 17
oxygen 17
to 17
the 17
point 17
of 17
pain 17
i 17
push 17
people 17
aside 17
until 17
i 17
am 17
right 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
him 17
my 17
hand 17
resting 17
on 17
the 17
screen 17
i 17
search 17
his 17
eyes 17
for 17
any 17
sign 17
of 17
hurt 17
any 17
reflection 17
of 17
the 17
agony 17
of 17
torture 17
there 17
is 17
nothing 17
peeta 17
looks 17
healthy 17
to 17
the 17
point 17
of 17
robustness 17
his 17
skin 17
is 17
glowing 17
flawless 17
in 17
that 17
fullbodypolish 17
way 17
his 17
manners 17
composed 17
serious 17
i 17
cant 17
reconcile 17
this 17
image 17
with 17
the 17
battered 17
bleeding 17
boy 17
who 17
haunts 17
my 17
dreams 17
caesar 17
settles 17
himself 17
more 17
comfortably 17
in 17
the 17
chair 17
across 17
from 17
peeta 17
and 17
gives 17
him 17
a 17
long 17
look 17
sopeetawelcome 17
back 17
peeta 17
smiles 17
slightly 17
i 17
bet 17
you 17
thought 17
youd 17
done 17
your 17
last 17
interview 17
with 17
me 17
caesar 17
i 17
confess 17
i 17
did 17
says 17
caesar 17
the 17
night 17
before 17
the 17
quarter 17
quellwell 17
who 17
ever 17
thought 17
wed 17
see 17
you 17
again 17
it 17
wasnt 17
part 17
of 17
my 17
plan 17
thats 17
for 17
sure 17
says 17
peeta 17
with 17
a 17
frown 17
caesar 17
leans 17
in 17
to 17
him 17
a 17
little 17
i 17
think 17
it 17
was 17
clear 17
to 17
all 17
of 17
us 17
what 17
your 17
plan 17
was 17
to 17
sacrifice 17
yourself 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
so 17
that 17
katniss 17
everdeen 17
and 17
your 17
child 17
could 17
survive 17
that 17
was 17
it 17
clear 17
and 17
simple 17
peetas 17
fingers 17
trace 17
the 17
upholstered 17
pattern 17
on 17
the 17
arm 17
of 17
the 17
chair 17
but 17
other 17
people 17
had 17
plans 17
as 17
well 17
yes 17
other 17
people 17
had 17
plans 17
i 17
think 17
has 17
peeta 17
guessed 17
then 17
how 17
the 17
rebels 17
used 17
us 17
as 17
pawns 17
how 17
my 17
rescue 17
was 17
arranged 17
from 17
the 17
beginning 17
and 17
finally 17
how 17
our 17
mentor 17
haymitch 17
abernathy 17
betrayed 17
us 17
both 17
for 17
a 17
cause 17
he 17
pretended 17
to 17
have 17
no 17
interest 17
in 17
in 17
the 17
silence 17
that 17
follows 17
i 17
notice 17
the 17
lines 17
that 17
have 17
formed 17
between 17
peetas 17
eyebrows 17
he 17
has 17
guessed 17
or 17
he 17
has 17
been 17
told 17
but 17
the 17
capitol 17
has 17
not 17
killed 17
or 17
even 17
punished 17
him 17
for 17
right 17
now 17
that 17
exceeds 17
my 17
wildest 17
hopes 17
i 17
drink 17
in 17
his 17
wholeness 17
the 17
soundness 17
of 17
his 17
body 17
and 17
mind 17
it 17
runs 17
through 17
me 17
like 17
the 17
morphling 17
they 17
give 17
me 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17
dulling 17
the 17
pain 17
of 17
the 17
last 17
weeks 17
why 17
dont 17
you 17
tell 17
us 17
about 17
that 17
last 17
night 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
suggests 17
caesar 17
help 17
us 17
sort 17
a 17
few 17
things 17
out 17
peeta 17
nods 17
but 17
takes 17
his 17
time 17
speaking 17
that 17
last 17
nightto 17
tell 17
you 17
about 17
that 17
last 17
nightwell 17
first 17
of 17
all 17
you 17
have 17
to 17
imagine 17
how 17
it 17
felt 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
it 17
was 17
like 17
being 17
an 17
insect 17
trapped 17
under 17
a 17
bowl 17
filled 17
with 17
steaming 17
air 17
and 17
all 17
around 17
you 17
junglegreen 17
and 17
alive 17
and 17
ticking 17
that 17
giant 17
clock 17
ticking 17
away 17
your 17
life 17
every 17
hour 17
promising 17
some 17
new 17
horror 17
you 17
have 17
to 17
imagine 17
that 17
in 17
the 17
past 17
two 17
days 17
sixteen 17
people 17
have 17
diedsome 17
of 17
them 17
defending 17
you 17
at 17
the 17
rate 17
things 17
are 17
going 17
the 17
last 17
eight 17
will 17
be 17
dead 17
by 17
morning 17
save 17
one 17
the 17
victor 17
and 17
your 17
plan 17
is 17
that 17
it 17
wont 17
be 17
you 17
my 17
body 17
breaks 17
out 17
in 17
a 17
sweat 17
at 17
the 17
memory 17
my 17
hand 17
slides 17
down 17
the 17
screen 17
and 17
hangs 17
limply 17
at 17
my 17
side 17
peeta 17
doesnt 17
need 17
a 17
brush 17
to 17
paint 17
images 17
from 17
the 17
games 17
he 17
works 17
just 17
as 17
well 17
in 17
words 17
once 17
youre 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
world 17
becomes 17
very 17
distant 17
he 17
continues 17
all 17
the 17
people 17
and 17
things 17
you 17
loved 17
or 17
cared 17
about 17
almost 17
cease 17
to 17
exist 17
the 17
pink 17
sky 17
and 17
the 17
monsters 17
in 17
the 17
jungle 17
and 17
the 17
tributes 17
who 17
want 17
your 17
blood 17
become 17
your 17
final 17
reality 17
the 17
only 17
one 17
that 17
ever 17
mattered 17
as 17
bad 17
as 17
it 17
makes 17
you 17
feel 17
youre 17
going 17
to 17
have 17
to 17
do 17
some 17
killing 17
because 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
you 17
only 17
get 17
one 17
wish 17
and 17
its 17
very 17
costly 17
it 17
costs 17
your 17
life 17
says 17
caesar 17
oh 17
no 17
it 17
costs 17
a 17
lot 17
more 17
than 17
your 17
life 17
to 17
murder 17
innocent 17
people 17
says 17
peeta 17
it 17
costs 17
everything 17
you 17
are 17
everything 17
you 17
are 17
repeats 17
caesar 17
quietly 17
a 17
hush 17
has 17
fallen 17
over 17
the 17
room 17
and 17
i 17
can 17
feel 17
it 17
spreading 17
across 17
panem 17
a 17
nation 17
leaning 17
in 17
toward 17
its 17
screens 17
because 17
no 17
one 17
has 17
ever 17
talked 17
about 17
what 17
its 17
really 17
like 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
before 17
peeta 17
goes 17
on 17
so 17
you 17
hold 17
on 17
to 17
your 17
wish 17
and 17
that 17
last 17
night 17
yes 17
my 17
wish 17
was 17
to 17
save 17
katniss 17
but 17
even 17
without 17
knowing 17
about 17
the 17
rebels 17
it 17
didnt 17
feel 17
right 17
everything 17
was 17
too 17
complicated 17
i 17
found 17
myself 17
regretting 17
i 17
hadnt 17
run 17
off 17
with 17
her 17
earlier 17
in 17
the 17
day 17
as 17
she 17
had 17
suggested 17
but 17
there 17
was 17
no 17
getting 17
out 17
of 17
it 17
at 17
that 17
point 17
you 17
were 17
too 17
caught 17
up 17
in 17
beetees 17
plan 17
to 17
electrify 17
the 17
salt 17
lake 17
says 17
caesar 17
too 17
busy 17
playing 17
allies 17
with 17
the 17
others 17
i 17
should 17
have 17
never 17
let 17
them 17
separate 17
us 17
peeta 17
bursts 17
out 17
thats 17
when 17
i 17
lost 17
her 17
when 17
you 17
stayed 17
at 17
the 17
lightning 17
tree 17
and 17
she 17
and 17
johanna 17
mason 17
took 17
the 17
coil 17
of 17
wire 17
down 17
to 17
the 17
water 17
caesar 17
clarifies 17
i 17
didnt 17
want 17
to 17
peeta 17
flushes 17
in 17
agitation 17
but 17
i 17
couldnt 17
argue 17
with 17
beetee 17
without 17
indicating 17
we 17
were 17
about 17
to 17
break 17
away 17
from 17
the 17
alliance 17
when 17
that 17
wire 17
was 17
cut 17
everything 17
just 17
went 17
insane 17
i 17
can 17
only 17
remember 17
bits 17
and 17
pieces 17
trying 17
to 17
find 17
her 17
watching 17
brutus 17
kill 17
chaff 17
killing 17
brutus 17
myself 17
i 17
know 17
she 17
was 17
calling 17
my 17
name 17
then 17
the 17
lightning 17
bolt 17
hit 17
the 17
tree 17
and 17
the 17
force 17
field 17
around 17
the 17
arenablew 17

seen 17
the 17
footage 17
she 17
didnt 17
know 17
what 17
she 17
was 17
doing 17
none 17
of 17
us 17
could 17
follow 17
beetees 17
plan 17
you 17
can 17
see 17
her 17
trying 17
to 17
figure 17
out 17
what 17
to 17
do 17
with 17
that 17
wire 17
peeta 17
snaps 17
back 17
all 17
right 17
it 17
just 17
looks 17
suspicious 17
says 17
caesar 17
as 17
if 17
she 17
was 17
part 17
of 17
the 17
rebels 17
plan 17
all 17
along 17

locked 17
on 17
the 17
arms 17
of 17
his 17
interviewers 17
chair 17
really 17
and 17
was 17
it 17
part 17
of 17
her 17
plan 17
for 17
johanna 17
to 17
nearly 17
kill 17
her 17
for 17
that 17
electric 17
shock 17
to 17
paralyze 17
her 17
to 17
trigger 17
the 17
bombing 17

she 17
didnt 17
know 17
caesar 17
neither 17
of 17
us 17

anything 17
except 17
that 17
we 17
were 17
trying 17
to 17
keep 17
each 17
other 17
alive 17
caesar 17
places 17
his 17
hand 17
on 17
peetas 17
chest 17
in 17
a 17
gesture 17
thats 17
both 17
selfprotective 17
and 17
conciliatory 17
okay 17
peeta 17
i 17
believe 17
you 17
okay 17
peeta 17
withdraws 17
from 17
caesar 17
pulling 17
back 17
his 17
hands 17
running 17
them 17
through 17
his 17
hair 17
mussing 17
his 17
carefully 17
styled 17
blond 17
curls 17
he 17
slumps 17
back 17
in 17
his 17
chair 17
distraught 17
caesar 17
waits 17
a 17
moment 17
studying 17
peeta 17
what 17
about 17
your 17
mentor 17
haymitch 17
abernathy 17
peetas 17
face 17
hardens 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
what 17
haymitch 17
knew 17
could 17
he 17
have 17
been 17
part 17
of 17
the 17
conspiracy 17
asks 17
caesar 17
he 17
never 17
mentioned 17
it 17
says 17
peeta 17
caesar 17
presses 17
on 17
what 17
does 17
your 17
heart 17
tell 17
you 17
that 17
i 17
shouldnt 17
have 17
trusted 17
him 17
says 17
peeta 17
thats 17
all 17
i 17
havent 17
seen 17
haymitch 17
since 17
i 17
attacked 17
him 17
on 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
leaving 17
long 17
claw 17
marks 17
down 17
his 17
face 17
i 17
know 17
its 17
been 17
bad 17
for 17
him 17
here 17
district 17
strictly 17
forbids 17
any 17
production 17
or 17
consumption 17
of 17
intoxicating 17
beverages 17
and 17
even 17
the 17
rubbing 17
alcohol 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17
is 17
kept 17
under 17
lock 17
and 17
key 17
finally 17
haymitch 17
is 17
being 17
forced 17
into 17
sobriety 17
with 17
no 17
secret 17
stashes 17
or 17
homebrewed 17
concoctions 17
to 17
ease 17
his 17
transition 17
theyve 17
got 17
him 17
in 17
seclusion 17
until 17
hes 17
dried 17
out 17
as 17
hes 17
not 17
deemed 17
fit 17
for 17
public 17
display 17
it 17
must 17
be 17
excruciating 17
but 17
i 17
lost 17
all 17
my 17
sympathy 17
for 17
haymitch 17
when 17
i 17
realized 17
how 17
he 17
had 17
deceived 17
us 17
i 17
hope 17
hes 17
watching 17
the 17
capitol 17
broadcast 17
now 17
so 17
he 17
can 17
see 17
that 17
peeta 17
has 17
cast 17
him 17
off 17
as 17
well 17
caesar 17
pats 17
peetas 17
shoulder 17
we 17
can 17
stop 17
now 17
if 17
you 17
want 17
was 17
there 17
more 17
to 17
discuss 17
says 17
peeta 17
wryly 17
i 17
was 17
going 17
to 17
ask 17
your 17
thoughts 17
on 17
the 17
war 17
but 17
if 17
youre 17
too 17
upset 17
begins 17
caesar 17
oh 17

not 17
too 17
upset 17
to 17
answer 17
that 17
peeta 17
takes 17
a 17
deep 17
breath 17
and 17
then 17
looks 17
straight 17
into 17
the 17
camera 17
i 17
want 17
everyone 17
watchingwhether 17
youre 17
on 17

rebel 17
sideto 17
stop 17
for 17
just 17
a 17
moment 17
and 17
think 17
about 17
what 17
this 17
war 17
could 17
mean 17
for 17
human 17
beings 17
we 17
almost 17
went 17
extinct 17
fighting 17
one 17
another 17
before 17
now 17
our 17
numbers 17
are 17
even 17
fewer 17
our 17
conditions 17
more 17
tenuous 17
is 17
this 17
really 17
what 17
we 17
want 17
to 17
do 17
kill 17
ourselves 17
off 17
completely 17
in 17
the 17
hopes 17
thatwhat 17
some 17
decent 17
species 17
will 17
inherit 17

guards 17
to 17
take 17
me 17
back 17
to 17
my 17
quarters 17
so 17
i 17
can 17
build 17
another 17
hundred 17
card 17
houses 17
caesar 17
turns 17
to 17
the 17
camera 17
all 17
right 17
i 17
think 17
that 17
wraps 17
it 17
up 17
so 17
back 17
to 17
our 17
regularly 17
scheduled 17
programming 17
music 17
plays 17
them 17
out 17
and 17
then 17
theres 17
a 17
woman 17
reading 17
a 17
list 17
of 17
expected 17
shortages 17
in 17
the 17
capitolfresh 17
fruit 17
solar 17
batteries 17
soap 17
i 17
watch 17
her 17
with 17
uncharacteristic 17
absorption 17
because 17
i 17
know 17
everyone 17
will 17
be 17
waiting 17
for 17
my 17
reaction 17
to 17
the 17
interview 17
but 17
theres 17
no 17
way 17
i 17
can 17
process 17
it 17
all 17
so 17
quicklythe 17
joy 17
of 17
seeing 17
peeta 17
alive 17
and 17
unharmed 17
his 17
defense 17
of 17
my 17
innocence 17
in 17
collaborating 17
with 17
the 17
rebels 17
and 17
his 17
undeniable 17
complicity 17
with 17
the 17
capitol 17
now 17
that 17
hes 17
called 17
for 17
a 17
ceasefire 17
oh 17
he 17
made 17
it 17
sound 17
as 17
if 17
he 17
were 17
condemning 17
both 17
sides 17
in 17
the 17
war 17
but 17
at 17
this 17
point 17
with 17
only 17
minor 17
victories 17
for 17
the 17
rebels 17
a 17
ceasefire 17
could 17
only 17
result 17
in 17
a 17
return 17
to 17
our 17
previous 17
status 17
or 17
worse 17
behind 17
me 17
i 17
can 17
hear 17
the 17
accusations 17
against 17
peeta 17
building 17
the 17
words 17
traitor 17
liar 17
and 17
enemy 17
bounce 17
off 17
the 17
walls 17
since 17
i 17
can 17
neither 17
join 17
in 17
the 17
rebels 17
outrage 17
nor 17
counter 17
it 17
i 17
decide 17
the 17
best 17
thing 17
to 17
do 17
is 17
clear 17
out 17
as 17
i 17
reach 17
the 17
door 17
coins 17
voice 17
rises 17
above 17
the 17
others 17
you 17
have 17
not 17
been 17
dismissed 17
soldier 17
everdeen 17
one 17
of 17
coins 17
men 17
lays 17
a 17
hand 17
on 17
my 17
arm 17
its 17
not 17
an 17
aggressive 17
move 17
really 17
but 17
after 17
the 17
arena 17
i 17
react 17
defensively 17
to 17
any 17
unfamiliar 17
touch 17
i 17
jerk 17
my 17
arm 17
free 17
and 17
take 17
off 17
running 17
down 17
the 17
halls 17
behind 17
me 17
theres 17
the 17
sound 17
of 17
a 17
scuffle 17
but 17
i 17
dont 17
stop 17
my 17
mind 17
does 17
a 17
quick 17
inventory 17
of 17
my 17
odd 17
little 17
hiding 17
places 17
and 17
i 17
wind 17
up 17
in 17
the 17
supply 17
closet 17
curled 17
up 17
against 17
a 17
crate 17
of 17
chalk 17
youre 17
alive 17
i 17
whisper 17
pressing 17
my 17
palms 17
against 17
my 17
cheeks 17
feeling 17
the 17
smile 17
thats 17
so 17
wide 17
it 17
must 17
look 17
like 17
a 17
grimace 17
peetas 17
alive 17
and 17
a 17
traitor 17
but 17
at 17
the 17
moment 17
i 17
dont 17
care 17
not 17
what 17
he 17
says 17
or 17
who 17
he 17
says 17
it 17
for 17
only 17
that 17
he 17
is 17
still 17
capable 17
of 17
speech 17
after 17
a 17
while 17
the 17
door 17
opens 17
and 17
someone 17
slips 17
in 17
gale 17
slides 17
down 17
beside 17
me 17
his 17
nose 17
trickling 17
blood 17
what 17
happened 17
i 17
ask 17
i 17
got 17
in 17
boggss 17
way 17
he 17
answers 17
with 17
a 17
shrug 17
i 17
use 17
my 17
sleeve 17
to 17
wipe 17
his 17
nose 17
watch 17
it 17
i 17
try 17
to 17
be 17
gentler 17
patting 17
not 17
wiping 17
which 17
one 17
is 17
he 17
oh 17
you 17
know 17
coins 17
righthand 17
lackey 17
the 17
one 17
who 17
tried 17
to 17
stop 17
you 17
he 17
pushes 17
my 17
hand 17
away 17
quit 17
youll 17
bleed 17
me 17
to 17
death 17
the 17
trickle 17
has 17
turned 17
to 17
a 17
steady 17
stream 17
i 17
give 17
up 17
on 17
the 17
firstaid 17
attempts 17
you 17
fought 17
with 17
boggs 17
no 17
just 17
blocked 17
the 17
doorway 17
when 17
he 17
tried 17
to 17
follow 17
you 17
his 17
elbow 17
caught 17
me 17
in 17
the 17
nose 17
says 17
gale 17
theyll 17
probably 17
punish 17
you 17
i 17
say 17
already 17
have 17
he 17
holds 17
up 17
his 17
wrist 17
i 17
stare 17
at 17
it 17
uncomprehendingly 17
coin 17
took 17
back 17
my 17
communicuff 17
i 17
bite 17
my 17
lip 17
trying 17
to 17
remain 17
serious 17
but 17
it 17
seems 17
so 17
ridiculous 17
im 17
sorry 17
soldier 17
gale 17
hawthorne 17
dont 17
be 17
soldier 17
katniss 17
everdeen 17
he 17
grins 17
i 17
felt 17
like 17
a 17
jerk 17
walking 17
around 17
with 17
it 17
anyway 17
we 17
both 17
start 17
laughing 17
i 17
think 17
it 17
was 17
quite 17
a 17
demotion 17
this 17
is 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
few 17
good 17
things 17
about 17
getting 17
gale 17
back 17
with 17
the 17
pressure 17
of 17
the 17
capitols 17
arranged 17
marriage 17
between 17
peeta 17
and 17
me 17
gone 17
weve 17
managed 17
to 17
regain 17
our 17
friendship 17
he 17
doesnt 17
push 17
it 17
any 17
furthertry 17
to 17
kiss 17
me 17
or 17
talk 17
about 17
love 17
either 17
ive 17
been 17
too 17
sick 17
or 17
hes 17
willing 17
to 17
give 17
me 17
space 17
or 17
he 17
knows 17
its 17
just 17
too 17
cruel 17
with 17
peeta 17
in 17
the 17
hands 17
of 17
the 17
capitol 17
whatever 17
the 17
case 17
ive 17
got 17
someone 17
to 17
tell 17
my 17
secrets 17
to 17
again 17
who 17
are 17
these 17
people 17
i 17
say 17
theyre 17
us 17
if 17
wed 17
had 17
nukes 17
instead 17
of 17
a 17
few 17
lumps 17
of 17
coal 17
he 17
answers 17
i 17
like 17
to 17
think 17
twelve 17
wouldnt 17
have 17
abandoned 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
rebels 17
back 17
in 17
the 17
dark 17
days 17
i 17
say 17
we 17
might 17
have 17
if 17
it 17
was 17
that 17
surrender 17
or 17
start 17
a 17
nuclear 17
war 17
says 17
gale 17
in 17
a 17
way 17
its 17
remarkable 17
they 17
survived 17
at 17
all 17
maybe 17
its 17
because 17
i 17
still 17
have 17
the 17
ashes 17
of 17
my 17
own 17
district 17
on 17
my 17
shoes 17
but 17
for 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
i 17
give 17
the 17
people 17
of 17
something 17
i 17
have 17
withheld 17
from 17
them 17
credit 17
for 17
staying 17
alive 17
against 17
all 17
odds 17
their 17
early 17
years 17
must 17
have 17
been 17
terrible 17
huddled 17
in 17
the 17
chambers 17
beneath 17
the 17
ground 17
after 17
their 17
city 17
was 17
bombed 17
to 17
dust 17
population 17
decimated 17
no 17
possible 17
ally 17
to 17
turn 17
to 17
for 17
aid 17
over 17
the 17
past 17
seventyfive 17
years 17
theyve 17
learned 17
to 17
be 17
selfsufficient 17
turned 17
their 17
citizens 17
into 17
an 17
army 17
and 17
built 17
a 17
new 17
society 17
with 17
no 17
help 17
from 17
anyone 17
they 17
would 17
be 17
even 17
more 17
powerful 17
if 17
that 17
pox 17
epidemic 17
hadnt 17
flattened 17
their 17
birthrate 17
and 17
made 17
them 17
so 17
desperate 17
for 17
a 17
new 17
gene 17
pool 17
and 17
breeders 17
maybe 17
they 17
are 17
militaristic 17
overly 17
programmed 17
and 17
somewhat 17
lacking 17
in 17
a 17
sense 17
of 17
humor 17
theyre 17
here 17
and 17
willing 17
to 17
take 17
on 17
the 17
capitol 17
still 17
it 17
took 17
them 17
long 17
enough 17
to 17
show 17
up 17
i 17
say 17
it 17
wasnt 17
simple 17
they 17
had 17
to 17
build 17
up 17
a 17
rebel 17
base 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
get 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
underground 17
organized 17
in 17
the 17
districts 17
he 17
says 17
then 17
they 17
needed 17
someone 17
to 17
set 17
the 17
whole 17
thing 17
in 17
motion 17
they 17
needed 17
you 17
they 17
needed 17
peeta 17
too 17
but 17
they 17
seem 17
to 17
have 17
forgotten 17
that 17
i 17
say 17
gales 17
expression 17
darkens 17
peeta 17
might 17
have 17
done 17
a 17
lot 17
of 17
damage 17
tonight 17
most 17
of 17
the 17
rebels 17
will 17
dismiss 17
what 17
he 17
said 17
immediately 17
of 17
course 17
but 17
there 17
are 17
districts 17
where 17
the 17
resistance 17
is 17
shakier 17
the 17
ceasefires 17
clearly 17
president 17
snows 17
idea 17
but 17
it 17
seems 17
so 17
reasonable 17
coming 17
out 17
of 17
peetas 17
mouth 17
im 17
afraid 17
of 17
gales 17
answer 17
but 17
i 17
ask 17
anyway 17
why 17
do 17
you 17
think 17
he 17
said 17
it 17
he 17
might 17
have 17
been 17
tortured 17
or 17
persuaded 17
my 17
guess 17
is 17
he 17
made 17
some 17
kind 17
of 17
deal 17
to 17
protect 17
you 17
hed 17
put 17
forth 17
the 17
idea 17
of 17
the 17
ceasefire 17
if 17
snow 17
let 17
him 17
present 17
you 17
as 17
a 17
confused 17
pregnant 17
girl 17
who 17
had 17
no 17
idea 17
what 17
was 17
going 17
on 17
when 17
she 17
was 17
taken 17
prisoner 17
by 17
the 17
rebels 17
this 17
way 17
if 17
the 17
districts 17
lose 17
theres 17
still 17
a 17
chance 17
of 17
leniency 17
for 17
you 17
if 17
you 17
play 17
it 17
right 17
i 17
must 17
still 17
look 17
perplexed 17
because 17
gale 17
delivers 17
the 17
next 17
line 17
very 17
slowly 17
katnisshes 17
still 17
trying 17
to 17
keep 17
you 17
alive 17
to 17
keep 17
me 17
alive 17
and 17
then 17
i 17
understand 17
the 17
games 17
are 17
still 17
on 17
we 17
have 17
left 17
the 17
arena 17
but 17
since 17
peeta 17
and 17
i 17
werent 17
killed 17
his 17
last 17
wish 17
to 17
preserve 17
my 17
life 17
still 17
stands 17
his 17
idea 17
is 17
to 17
have 17
me 17
lie 17
low 17
remain 17
safe 17
and 17
imprisoned 17
while 17
the 17
war 17
plays 17
out 17
then 17
neither 17
side 17
will 17
really 17
have 17
cause 17
to 17
kill 17
me 17
and 17
peeta 17
if 17
the 17
rebels 17
win 17
it 17
will 17
be 17
disastrous 17
for 17
him 17
if 17
the 17
capitol 17
wins 17
who 17
knows 17
maybe 17
well 17
both 17
be 17
allowed 17
to 17
liveif 17
i 17
play 17
it 17
rightto 17
watch 17
the 17
games 17
go 17
on 17
images 17
flash 17
through 17
my 17
mind 17
the 17
spear 17
piercing 17
rues 17
body 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
gale 17
hanging 17
senseless 17
from 17
the 17

heart 17
of 17
my 17
enemy 17

pencils 17
sending 17

scattering 17
around 17
the 17
floor 17
what 17

gale 17
asks 17
there 17

the 17
faint 17
glow 17
of 17
the 17
safety 17
light 17
over 17
the 17

iridescent 17
surface 17
of 17
the 17
pearl 17
back 17
and 17
forth 17
against 17
my 17
lips 17
for 17
some 17
reason 17
its 17
soothing 17
a 17
cool 17
kiss 17
from 17
the 17

my 17
mother 17

eases 17
herself 17
from 17
the 17
bed 17

up 17
buttercup 17
and 17
sits 17
beside 17
me 17
she 17
touches 17
the 17
hand 17
that 17
has 17
curled 17
around 17
the 17
pearl 17
youre 17
cold 17
taking 17
a 17
spare 17
blanket 17
from 17
the 17
foot 17
of 17
the 17
bed 17
she 17
wraps 17
it 17
around 17
all 17
three 17
of 17
us 17
enveloping 17
me 17
in 17
her 17
warmth 17
and 17
buttercups 17
furry 17
heat 17
as 17

keeping 17
secrets 17
even 17
from 17
mother 17
shes 17
really 17
gone 17
then 17
the 17
little 17
girl 17
with 17
the 17
back 17
of 17
her 17
shirt 17
sticking 17
out 17
like 17
a 17
duck 17
tail 17
the 17
one 17
who 17
needed 17
help 17
reaching 17
the 17
dishes 17
and 17
who 17
begged 17
to 17
see 17
the 17
frosted 17
cakes 17
in 17
the 17
bakery 17
window 17
time 17
and 17
tragedy 17
have 17
forced 17
her 17
to 17
grow 17
too 17
quickly 17
at 17
least 17
for 17
my 17
taste 17
into 17
a 17
young 17
woman 17
who 17
stitches 17
bleeding 17
wounds 17
and 17
knows 17
our 17
mother 17
can 17
hear 17
only 17
so 17
much 17
tomorrow 17
morning 17
im 17
going 17
to 17
agree 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
i 17
tell 17
her 17
because 17
you 17
want 17
to 17
or 17
because 17
you 17
feel 17
forced 17
into 17
it 17
she 17
asks 17
i 17
laugh 17
a 17
little 17
both 17
i 17
guess 17
no 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
if 17
it 17
will 17
help 17
the 17
rebels 17
defeat 17
snow 17
i 17
squeeze 17
the 17
pearl 17
more 17
tightly 17
in 17
my 17
fist 17
its 17
justpeeta 17
im 17
afraid 17
if 17
we 17
do 17
win 17
the 17
rebels 17
will 17
execute 17
him 17
as 17
a 17
traitor 17
prim 17
thinks 17
this 17
over 17
katniss 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
you 17
understand 17
how 17
important 17
you 17
are 17
to 17
the 17
cause 17
important 17
people 17
usually 17
get 17
what 17
they 17
want 17
if 17
you 17
want 17
to 17
keep 17
peeta 17
safe 17
from 17
the 17
rebels 17
you 17
can 17
i 17
guess 17
im 17
important 17
they 17
went 17
to 17
a 17
lot 17
of 17
trouble 17
to 17
rescue 17
me 17
they 17
took 17
me 17
to 17
you 17
meani 17
could 17
demand 17
that 17
they 17
give 17
peeta 17
immunity 17
and 17
theyd 17
have 17
to 17
agree 17
to 17
it 17
i 17
think 17
you 17
could 17
demand 17
almost 17
anything 17
and 17
theyd 17
have 17
to 17
agree 17
to 17
it 17
prim 17
wrinkles 17
her 17
brow 17
only 17
how 17
do 17
you 17
know 17
theyll 17
keep 17
their 17
word 17
i 17
remember 17
all 17
of 17
the 17
lies 17
haymitch 17
told 17
peeta 17
and 17
me 17
to 17
get 17
us 17
to 17
do 17
what 17
he 17
wanted 17
whats 17
to 17
keep 17
the 17
rebels 17
from 17
reneging 17
on 17
the 17
deal 17
a 17
verbal 17
promise 17
behind 17
closed 17
doors 17
even 17
a 17
statement 17
written 17
on 17
paperthese 17
could 17
easily 17
evaporate 17
after 17
the 17
war 17
their 17
existence 17
or 17
validity 17
denied 17
any 17
witnesses 17
in 17
command 17
will 17
be 17
worthless 17
in 17
fact 17
theyd 17
probably 17
be 17
the 17
ones 17
writing 17
out 17
peetas 17
death 17
warrant 17
ill 17
need 17
a 17
much 17
larger 17
pool 17
of 17
witnesses 17
ill 17
need 17
everyone 17
i 17
can 17
get 17
it 17
will 17
have 17
to 17
be 17
public 17

say 17
buttercup 17
gives 17
a 17
flick 17
of 17
his 17
tail 17

i 17
take 17
as 17
agreement 17
ill 17
make 17
coin 17
announce 17
it 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
the 17
entire 17
population 17
of 17
thirteen 17
prim 17
smiles 17
oh 17
thats 17
good 17
its 17
not 17
a 17
guarantee 17
but 17
it 17
will 17
be 17
much 17
harder 17
for 17
them 17
to 17
back 17
out 17
of 17
their 17
promise 17
i 17
feel 17
the 17
kind 17
of 17
relief 17
that 17
follows 17
an 17
actual 17
solution 17
i 17
should 17
wake 17

by 17
your 17

the 17
people 17
from 17

already 17
getting 17
slightly 17
larger 17
portions 17
than 17
the 17
natives 17
of 17
in 17
an 17
effort 17
to 17
bring 17
us 17
up 17
to 17
weight 17
i 17
guess 17
bony 17
soldiers 17
tire 17
too 17
quickly 17
its 17
working 17
though 17
in 17
just 17
a 17
month 17
were 17
starting 17
to 17
look 17
healthier 17
particularly 17
the 17
kids 17
gale 17
sets 17
his 17
tray 17
beside 17
me 17
and 17
i 17
try 17
not 17
to 17
stare 17
at 17
his 17
turnips 17
too 17
pathetically 17
because 17
i 17
really 17
want 17
more 17
and 17
hes 17
already 17
too 17
quick 17
to 17
slip 17
me 17
his 17
food 17
even 17
though 17
i 17
turn 17
my 17
attention 17
to 17
neatly 17
folding 17
my 17
napkin 17
a 17
spoonful 17
of 17
turnips 17
slops 17
into 17
my 17
bowl 17
youve 17
got 17
to 17
stop 17
that 17
i 17
say 17
but 17
since 17
im 17
already 17
scooping 17
up 17
the 17
stuff 17
its 17
not 17
too 17
convincing 17
really 17
its 17
probably 17
illegal 17
or 17
something 17
they 17
have 17
very 17
strict 17
rules 17
about 17
food 17
for 17
instance 17
if 17
you 17
dont 17
finish 17
something 17
and 17
want 17
to 17
save 17
it 17
for 17
later 17
you 17
cant 17
take 17
it 17
from 17
the 17
dining 17
hall 17
apparently 17
in 17
the 17
early 17
days 17
there 17
was 17
some 17
incident 17
of 17
food 17
hoarding 17
for 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
people 17
like 17
gale 17
and 17
me 17
whove 17
been 17
in 17
charge 17
of 17
our 17
families 17
food 17
supply 17
for 17
years 17
it 17

sit 17
well 17
we 17
know 17
how 17
to 17
be 17
hungry 17
but 17
not 17
how 17
to 17
be 17
told 17
how 17
to 17
handle 17
what 17
provisions 17
we 17
have 17
in 17
some 17
ways 17
district 17
is 17
even 17
more 17
controlling 17
than 17
the 17
capitol 17
what 17
can 17
they 17
do 17
theyve 17
already 17
got 17
my 17
communicuff 17

as 17
i 17
scrape 17
my 17
bowl 17
clean 17
i 17
have 17
an 17
inspiration 17
hey 17
maybe 17
i 17
should 17
make 17
that 17
a 17
condition 17
of 17
being 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
that 17
i 17

to 17
give 17
everything 17
to 17

kitchen 17
but 17
still 17
we 17
could 17
i 17
dont 17
have 17

because 17
he 17

could 17
be 17
aboveground 17
out 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
we 17
could 17
be 17
ourselves 17
again 17
do 17
it 17
he 17
says 17
nows 17
the 17
time 17
you 17
could 17
ask 17
for 17
the 17
moon 17
and 17
theyd 17
have 17
to 17
find 17
some 17
way 17
to 17
get 17
it 17
he 17
doesnt 17
know 17
that 17
im 17
already 17
asking 17
for 17
the 17
moon 17
by 17
demanding 17
they 17
spare 17
peetas 17
life 17
before 17
i 17
can 17
decide 17
whether 17
or 17
not 17
to 17
tell 17
him 17
a 17
bell 17
signals 17
the 17
end 17
of 17
our 17
eating 17
shift 17
the 17
thought 17
of 17
facing 17
coin 17
alone 17
makes 17
me 17
nervous 17
what 17
are 17
you 17
scheduled 17
for 17
gale 17
checks 17
his 17

by 17
the 17
way 17
your 17

been 17
noted 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
go 17
to 17
command 17
come 17
with 17
me 17
i 17
ask 17
all 17
right 17
but 17
they 17
might 17
throw 17
me 17
out 17
after 17
yesterday 17
as 17
we 17
go 17
to 17
drop 17
off 17
our 17
trays 17
he 17
says 17
you 17
know 17
you 17
better 17
put 17
buttercup 17
on 17
your 17
list 17
of 17
demands 17
too 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
the 17
concept 17
of 17
useless 17
pets 17
is 17
well 17
known 17
here 17
oh 17
theyll 17
find 17
him 17
a 17
job 17
tattoo 17
it 17
on 17
his 17
paw 17
every 17
morning 17
i 17
say 17
but 17
i 17
make 17
a 17
mental 17
note 17
to 17
include 17
him 17
for 17
prims 17
sake 17
by 17
the 17
time 17
we 17
get 17
to 17
command 17
coin 17
plutarch 17
and 17
all 17
their 17
people 17
have 17
already 17
assembled 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
gale 17
raises 17
some 17
eyebrows 17
but 17
no 17
one 17
throws 17
him 17
out 17
my 17
mental 17
notes 17
have 17
become 17
too 17
jumbled 17
so 17
i 17
ask 17
for 17
a 17
piece 17
of 17
paper 17
and 17
a 17
pencil 17
right 17
off 17
my 17
apparent 17
interest 17
in 17
the 17
proceedingsthe 17
first 17
ive 17
shown 17
since 17
ive 17
been 17
here 17
takes 17
them 17
by 17
surprise 17
several 17
looks 17
are 17
exchanged 17
probably 17
they 17
had 17
some 17
extraspecial 17
lecture 17
planned 17
for 17
me 17
but 17
instead 17
coin 17
personally 17
hands 17
me 17
the 17
supplies 17
and 17
everyone 17
waits 17
in 17
silence 17
while 17
i 17
sit 17
at 17
the 17
table 17
and 17
scrawl 17
out 17
my 17
list 17
buttercup 17
hunting 17
peetas 17
immunity 17
announced 17
in 17
public 17
this 17
is 17
it 17
probably 17
my 17
only 17
chance 17
to 17
bargain 17
think 17
what 17
else 17
do 17
you 17
want 17
i 17

him 17
standing 17
at 17
my 17
shoulder 17
gale 17
i 17
add 17
to 17
the 17
list 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
i 17
can 17
do 17
this 17
without 17
him 17
the 17
headaches 17
coming 17
on 17
and 17
my 17
thoughts 17
begin 17
to 17
tangle 17
i 17
shut 17
my 17
eyes 17
and 17
start 17
to 17
recite 17
silently 17
my 17
name 17
is 17
katniss 17

to 17
keep 17
him 17
alive 17
the 17
list 17
it 17
still 17
seems 17
too 17
small 17
i 17
should 17
try 17
to 17
think 17
bigger 17
beyond 17
our 17
current 17
situation 17
where 17
i 17
am 17
of 17
the 17
utmost 17
importance 17
to 17
the 17
future 17
where 17
i 17
may 17
be 17
worth 17
nothing 17
shouldnt 17
i 17
be 17
asking 17
for 17
more 17

remainder 17
of 17
my 17
people 17

itches 17
with 17
the 17
ashes 17
of 17
the 17
dead 17
i 17
feel 17
the 17
sickening 17
impact 17
of 17
the 17
skull 17
against 17
my 17
shoe 17
the 17
scent 17
of 17
blood 17
and 17
roses 17
stings 17
my 17
nose 17
the 17
pencil 17
moves 17
across 17
the 17
page 17
on 17

ill 17
need 17
him 17
with 17
me 17
to 17
do 17
this 17
with 17
you 17
how 17
off 17
camera 17
by 17
your 17
side 17
at 17
all 17
times 17
do 17
you 17
want 17
him 17
presented 17
as 17
your 17
new 17
lover 17
coin 17
asks 17
she 17
hasnt 17
said 17
this 17
with 17
any 17
particular 17
malicequite 17
the 17
contrary 17
her 17
words 17
are 17
very 17
matteroffact 17
but 17
my 17
mouth 17
still 17
drops 17
open 17
in 17
shock 17
what 17
i 17
think 17
we 17
should 17
continue 17
the 17
current 17
romance 17
a 17
quick 17
defection 17
from 17
peeta 17
could 17
cause 17
the 17
audience 17
to 17
lose 17
sympathy 17
for 17
her 17
says 17
plutarch 17
especially 17
since 17
they 17
think 17
shes 17
pregnant 17
with 17
his 17
child 17
agreed 17
so 17
onscreen 17
gale 17
can 17
simply 17
be 17
portrayed 17
as 17
a 17
fellow 17
rebel 17
is 17
that 17
all 17
right 17
says 17
coin 17
i 17
just 17
stare 17
at 17
her 17
she 17
repeats 17
herself 17
impatiently 17
for 17
gale 17
will 17
that 17
be 17
sufficient 17
we 17
can 17
always 17
work 17
him 17
in 17
as 17
your 17
cousin 17
says 17
fulvia 17
were 17
not 17
cousins 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
say 17
together 17
right 17
but 17
we 17
should 17
probably 17
keep 17
that 17
up 17
for 17
appearances 17
sake 17
on 17
camera 17
says 17
plutarch 17
off 17
camera 17
hes 17
all 17
yours 17
anything 17
else 17
im 17
rattled 17
by 17
the 17
turn 17
in 17
the 17
conversation 17
the 17
implications 17
that 17
i 17
could 17
so 17
readily 17
dispose 17
of 17
peeta 17
that 17
im 17
in 17
love 17
with 17
gale 17
that 17
the 17
whole 17
thing 17
has 17
been 17
an 17
act 17
my 17
cheeks 17
begin 17
to 17
burn 17
the 17
very 17
notion 17
that 17
im 17
devoting 17
any 17
thought 17
to 17
who 17
i 17
want 17
presented 17
as 17
my 17
lover 17
given 17
our 17
current 17
circumstances 17
is 17
demeaning 17
i 17
let 17
my 17
anger 17
propel 17
me 17
into 17
my 17
greatest 17
demand 17
when 17
the 17
war 17
is 17
over 17
if 17
weve 17
won 17
peeta 17
will 17
be 17
pardoned 17
dead 17
silence 17
i 17
feel 17
gales 17
body 17
tense 17
i 17
guess 17
i 17
should 17
have 17
told 17
him 17
before 17
but 17
i 17
wasnt 17
sure 17
how 17
hed 17
respond 17
not 17
when 17
it 17
involved 17
peeta 17
no 17
form 17
of 17
punishment 17
will 17
be 17
inflicted 17
i 17
continue 17
a 17
new 17
thought 17
occurs 17
to 17
me 17
the 17
same 17
goes 17
for 17
the 17
other 17
captured 17
tributes 17
johanna 17
and 17
enobaria 17
frankly 17
i 17
dont 17
care 17
about 17
enobaria 17
the 17
vicious 17
district 17
tribute 17
in 17
fact 17
i 17
dislike 17
her 17
but 17
it 17
seems 17
wrong 17
to 17
leave 17
her 17
out 17
no 17
says 17
coin 17
flatly 17
yes 17
i 17
shoot 17
back 17
its 17
not 17
their 17
fault 17
you 17
abandoned 17
them 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
who 17
knows 17
what 17
the 17
capitols 17
doing 17
to 17
them 17
theyll 17
be 17
tried 17
with 17
other 17
war 17
criminals 17
and 17
treated 17
as 17
the 17
tribunal 17
sees 17
fit 17
she 17
says 17
theyll 17
be 17
granted 17
immunity 17
i 17
feel 17
myself 17
rising 17
from 17
my 17
chair 17
my 17
voice 17
full 17
and 17
resonant 17
you 17
will 17
personally 17
pledge 17
this 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
the 17
entire 17
population 17
of 17
district 17
thirteen 17
and 17
the 17
remainder 17
of 17
twelve 17
soon 17
today 17
it 17
will 17
be 17
recorded 17
for 17
future 17
generations 17
you 17
will 17
hold 17
yourself 17
and 17
your 17
government 17
responsible 17
for 17
their 17
safety 17
or 17
youll 17
find 17
yourself 17
another 17
mockingjay 17
my 17
words 17
hang 17
in 17
the 17
air 17
for 17
a 17
long 17
moment 17
thats 17
her 17
i 17
hear 17
fulvia 17
hiss 17
to 17
plutarch 17
right 17
there 17
with 17
the 17
costume 17
gunfire 17
in 17
the 17
background 17
just 17
a 17
hint 17
of 17
smoke 17
yes 17
thats 17
what 17
we 17
want 17
says 17
plutarch 17
under 17
his 17
breath 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
glare 17
at 17
them 17
but 17
i 17
feel 17
it 17
would 17
be 17
a 17
mistake 17
to 17
turn 17
my 17
attention 17
from 17
coin 17
i 17
can 17
see 17
her 17
tallying 17
the 17
cost 17
of 17
my 17
ultimatum 17
weighing 17
it 17
against 17
my 17
possible 17
worth 17
what 17
do 17
you 17
say 17
president 17
asks 17
plutarch 17
you 17
could 17
issue 17
an 17
official 17
pardon 17
given 17
the 17
circumstances 17
the 17
boyhes 17
not 17
even 17
of 17
age 17
all 17
right 17
coin 17
says 17
finally 17
but 17
youd 17
better 17
perform 17
ill 17
perform 17
when 17
youve 17
made 17
the 17
announcement 17
i 17
say 17
call 17
a 17
national 17
security 17
assembly 17
during 17
reflection 17
today 17
she 17
orders 17
ill 17
make 17
the 17
announcement 17
then 17
is 17
there 17
anything 17
left 17
on 17
your 17
list 17
katniss 17
my 17
papers 17
crumpled 17
into 17
a 17
ball 17
in 17
my 17
right 17
fist 17
i 17
flatten 17
the 17
sheet 17
against 17
the 17
table 17
and 17
read 17
the 17
rickety 17
letters 17
just 17
one 17
more 17
thing 17
i 17
kill 17
snow 17
for 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
ever 17
i 17
see 17
the 17
hint 17
of 17
a 17
smile 17
on 17
the 17
presidents 17
lips 17
when 17
the 17
time 17
comes 17
ill 17
flip 17
you 17
for 17
it 17
maybe 17
shes 17
right 17
i 17
certainly 17
dont 17
have 17
the 17
sole 17
claim 17
against 17
snows 17
life 17
and 17
i 17
think 17
i 17
can 17
count 17
on 17
her 17
getting 17
the 17
job 17
done 17
fair 17
enough 17
coins 17
eyes 17
have 17
flickered 17
to 17
her 17
arm 17
the 17
clock 17
she 17
too 17
has 17
a 17
schedule 17
to 17
adhere 17
to 17
ill 17
leave 17
her 17
in 17
your 17
hands 17
then 17
plutarch 17
she 17
exits 17
the 17
room 17
followed 17
by 17
her 17
team 17
leaving 17
only 17
plutarch 17
fulvia 17
gale 17
and 17
myself 17
excellent 17
excellent 17
plutarch 17
sinks 17
down 17
elbows 17
on 17
the 17
table 17
rubbing 17
his 17
eyes 17
you 17
know 17
what 17
i 17
miss 17
more 17
than 17
anything 17
coffee 17
i 17
ask 17
you 17
would 17
it 17
be 17
so 17
unthinkable 17
to 17
have 17
something 17
to 17
wash 17
down 17
the 17
gruel 17
and 17
turnips 17
we 17
didnt 17
think 17
it 17
would 17
be 17
quite 17
so 17
rigid 17
here 17
fulvia 17
explains 17
to 17
us 17
as 17
she 17
massages 17
plutarchs 17
shoulders 17
not 17
in 17
the 17
higher 17
ranks 17
or 17
at 17
least 17
thered 17
be 17
the 17
option 17
of 17
a 17
little 17
side 17
action 17
says 17
plutarch 17
i 17
mean 17
even 17
twelve 17
had 17
a 17
black 17
market 17
right 17
yeah 17
the 17
hob 17
says 17
gale 17
its 17
where 17
we 17
traded 17
there 17
you 17
see 17
and 17
look 17
how 17
moral 17
you 17
two 17
are 17
virtually 17
incorruptible 17
plutarch 17
sighs 17
oh 17
well 17
wars 17
dont 17
last 17
forever 17
so 17
glad 17
to 17
have 17
you 17
on 17
the 17
team 17
he 17
reaches 17
a 17
hand 17
out 17
to 17
the 17
side 17
where 17
fulvia 17
is 17
already 17
extending 17
a 17
large 17
sketchbook 17
bound 17
in 17
black 17
leather 17
you 17
know 17
in 17
general 17
what 17
were 17
asking 17
of 17
you 17
katniss 17
im 17
aware 17
you 17
have 17
mixed 17
feelings 17
about 17
participating 17
i 17
hope 17
this 17
will 17
helpplutarch 17
slides 17
the 17
sketchbook 17
across 17
to 17
me 17
for 17
a 17
moment 17
i 17
look 17
at 17
it 17
suspiciously 17
then 17
curiosity 17
gets 17
the 17
better 17
of 17
me 17
i 17
open 17
the 17
cover 17
to 17
find 17
a 17
picture 17
of 17
myself 17
standing 17
straight 17
and 17
strong 17
in 17
a 17
black 17
uniform 17
only 17
one 17
person 17
could 17
have 17
designed 17
the 17
outfit 17
at 17
first 17
glance 17
utterly 17
utilitarian 17
at 17
second 17
a 17
work 17
of 17
art 17
the 17
swoop 17
of 17
the 17
helmet 17
the 17
curve 17
to 17
the 17
breastplate 17
the 17
slight 17
fullness 17
of 17
the 17
sleeves 17
that 17
allows 17
the 17
white 17
folds 17
under 17
the 17
arms 17
to 17
show 17
in 17
his 17
hands 17
i 17
am 17
again 17
a 17
mockingjay 17
cinna 17
i 17
whisper 17
yes 17
he 17
made 17
me 17
promise 17
not 17
to 17
show 17
you 17
this 17
book 17
until 17
youd 17
decided 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
on 17
your 17
own 17
believe 17
me 17

plutarch 17
go 17
on 17
flip 17
through 17
i 17
turn 17
the 17
pages 17
slowly 17
seeing 17
each 17
detail 17
of 17
the 17
uniform 17
the 17
carefully 17
tailored 17
layers 17
of 17
body 17
armor 17
the 17
hidden 17
weapons 17
in 17
the 17
boots 17
and 17
belt 17
the 17
special 17
reinforcements 17
over 17
my 17
heart 17
on 17
the 17
final 17
page 17
under 17
a 17
sketch 17
of 17
my 17
mockingjay 17
pin 17

on 17

my 17
voice 17
fails 17

a 17
few 17
weeks 17
before 17

special 17
waiting 17
for 17
you 17
down 17
in 17

thinks 17
theres 17
a 17

be 17
done 17

and 17
i 17

about 17
how 17
on 17
earth 17
we 17
can 17
pull 17
this 17
off 17
we 17
think 17
that 17
it 17
might 17
be 17
best 17
to 17
build 17
you 17
our 17
rebel 17
leader 17
from 17
the 17
outsidein 17
that 17
is 17

say 17
lets 17
find 17
the 17
most 17
stunning 17
mockingjay 17
look 17
possible 17
and 17
then 17
work 17
your 17
personality 17
up 17
to 17
deserving 17
it 17

says 17
brightly 17
you 17
already 17
have 17
her 17
uniform 17
says 17
gale 17
yes 17
but 17
is 17
she 17
scarred 17
and 17
bloody 17
is 17
she 17
glowing 17
with 17
the 17
fire 17
of 17
rebellion 17
just 17
how 17
grimy 17
can 17
we 17
make 17
her 17
without 17
disgusting 17
people 17
at 17
any 17
rate 17
she 17
has 17
to 17
be 17
something 17
i 17
mean 17
obviously 17
thisfulvia 17
moves 17
in 17
on 17
me 17
quickly 17
framing 17
my 17
face 17
with 17
her 17
handswont 17
cut 17
it 17
i 17
jerk 17
my 17
head 17
back 17
reflexively 17
but 17
shes 17
already 17
busy 17
gathering 17
her 17
things 17
so 17
with 17
that 17
in 17
mind 17
we 17
have 17
another 17
little 17
surprise 17
for 17
you 17
come 17

fulvia 17
gives 17
us 17
a 17
wave 17
and 17

and 17
i 17
follow 17
her 17
and 17
plutarch 17
out 17
into 17
the 17
hall 17
so 17
well 17
intended 17
and 17
yet 17
so 17
insulting 17
gale 17
whispers 17
in 17
my 17
ear 17
welcome 17
to 17
the 17
capitol 17
i 17
mouth 17
back 17
but 17
fulvias 17
words 17
have 17
no 17
effect 17
on 17
me 17
i 17
wrap 17
my 17
arms 17
tightly 17
around 17
the 17
sketchbook 17
and 17
allow 17
myself 17
to 17
feel 17
hopeful 17
this 17
must 17
be 17
the 17
right 17
decision 17
if 17
cinna 17
wanted 17
it 17
we 17
board 17
an 17
elevator 17
and 17
plutarch 17
checks 17
his 17
notes 17
lets 17
see 17
its 17
compartment 17
threenineoheight 17
he 17
presses 17
a 17
button 17
marked 17
but 17
nothing 17
happens 17
you 17
must 17
have 17
to 17
key 17
it 17
says 17
fulvia 17
plutarch 17
pulls 17
a 17
key 17
attached 17
to 17
a 17
thin 17
chain 17
from 17
under 17
his 17
shirt 17
and 17
inserts 17
it 17
into 17
a 17
slot 17
i 17
hadnt 17
noticed 17
before 17
the 17
doors 17
slide 17
shut 17
ah 17
there 17
we 17
are 17
the 17
elevator 17
descends 17
ten 17
twenty 17
thirtyplus 17
levels 17
farther 17
down 17
than 17
i 17
even 17
knew 17
district 17
went 17
it 17
opens 17
on 17
a 17
wide 17
white 17
corridor 17
lined 17
with 17
red 17
doors 17
which 17
look 17
almost 17
decorative 17
compared 17
to 17
the 17
gray 17
ones 17
on 17
the 17
upper 17
floors 17
each 17
is 17
plainly 17
marked 17
with 17
a 17
number 17
as 17
we 17
step 17
out 17
i 17
glance 17
behind 17
me 17
to 17
watch 17
the 17
elevator 17
close 17
and 17
see 17
a 17
metallic 17
grate 17
slide 17
into 17
place 17
over 17
the 17
regular 17
doors 17
when 17
i 17
turn 17
a 17
guard 17
has 17
materialized 17
from 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
rooms 17
at 17
the 17
far 17
end 17
of 17
the 17
corridor 17
a 17
door 17
swings 17
silently 17
shut 17
behind 17
him 17
as 17
he 17
strides 17
toward 17
us 17
plutarch 17
moves 17
to 17
meet 17
him 17
raising 17
a 17
hand 17
in 17
greeting 17
and 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
us 17
follow 17
behind 17
him 17
something 17
feels 17
very 17
wrong 17
down 17
here 17
its 17
more 17
than 17
the 17
reinforced 17
elevator 17
or 17
the 17
claustrophobia 17
of 17
being 17
so 17
far 17
underground 17
or 17
the 17
caustic 17
smell 17
of 17
antiseptic 17
one 17
look 17
at 17
gales 17
face 17
and 17
i 17
can 17
tell 17
he 17
senses 17
it 17
as 17
well 17
good 17
morning 17
we 17
were 17
just 17
looking 17
for 17
plutarch 17
begins 17
you 17
have 17
the 17
wrong 17
floor 17
says 17
the 17
guard 17
abruptly 17
really 17
plutarch 17
doublechecks 17
his 17
notes 17
ive 17
got 17
threenineoheight 17
written 17
right 17
here 17
i 17
wonder 17
if 17
you 17
could 17
just 17
give 17
a 17
call 17
up 17
to 17
im 17
afraid 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
ask 17
you 17
to 17
leave 17
now 17
assignment 17
discrepancies 17
can 17
be 17
addressed 17
at 17
the 17
head 17
office 17
says 17
the 17
guard 17
its 17
right 17
ahead 17
of 17
us 17
compartment 17
just 17
a 17
few 17
steps 17
away 17
the 17
doorin 17
fact 17
all 17
the 17
doorsseem 17
incomplete 17
no 17
knobs 17
they 17
must 17
swing 17
free 17
on 17
hinges 17
like 17
the 17
one 17
the 17
guard 17
appeared 17
through 17
where 17
is 17
that 17
again 17
asks 17
fulvia 17
youll 17
find 17
the 17
head 17
office 17
on 17
level 17
seven 17
says 17
the 17
guard 17
extending 17
his 17
arms 17
to 17
corral 17
us 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
elevator 17
from 17
behind 17
door 17
comes 17
a 17
sound 17
just 17
a 17
tiny 17
whimper 17
like 17
something 17
a 17
cowed 17
dog 17
might 17
make 17
to 17
avoid 17
being 17
struck 17
only 17
all 17
too 17
human 17
and 17
familiar 17
my 17
eyes 17
meet 17
gales 17
for 17
just 17
a 17
moment 17
but 17
its 17
long 17
enough 17
for 17
two 17
people 17
who 17
operate 17
the 17
way 17
we 17
do 17
i 17
let 17
cinnas 17
sketchbook 17
fall 17
at 17
the 17
guards 17
feet 17
with 17
a 17
loud 17
bang 17
a 17
second 17
after 17
he 17
leans 17
down 17
to 17
retrieve 17
it 17
gale 17
leans 17
down 17
too 17
intentionally 17
bumping 17
heads 17
oh 17
im 17
sorry 17
he 17
says 17
with 17
a 17
light 17
laugh 17
catching 17
the 17
guards 17
arms 17
as 17
if 17
to 17
steady 17
himself 17
turning 17
him 17
slightly 17
away 17
from 17
me 17
thats 17
my 17
chance 17
i 17
dart 17
around 17
the 17
distracted 17
guard 17
push 17
open 17
the 17
door 17
marked 17
and 17
find 17
them 17
halfnaked 17
bruised 17
and 17
shackled 17
to 17
the 17
wall 17
my 17
prep 17
team 17
the 17
stink 17
of 17
unwashed 17
bodies 17
stale 17
urine 17
and 17
infection 17
breaks 17
through 17
the 17
cloud 17
of 17
antiseptic 17
the 17
three 17
figures 17
are 17
only 17
just 17
recognizable 17
by 17
their 17
most 17
striking 17
fashion 17
choices 17
venias 17
gold 17
facial 17
tattoos 17
flaviuss 17
orange 17
corkscrew 17
curls 17
octavias 17
light 17
evergreen 17
skin 17
which 17
now 17
hangs 17
too 17
loosely 17
as 17
if 17
her 17
body 17
were 17
a 17
slowly 17
deflating 17
balloon 17
on 17
seeing 17
me 17
flavius 17
and 17
octavia 17
shrink 17
back 17
against 17
the 17
tiled 17
walls 17
like 17
theyre 17
anticipating 17
an 17
attack 17
even 17
though 17
i 17
have 17
never 17
hurt 17
them 17
unkind 17
thoughts 17
were 17
my 17
worst 17
offense 17
against 17
them 17
and 17
those 17
i 17
kept 17
to 17
myself 17
so 17
why 17
do 17
they 17
recoil 17
the 17
guards 17
ordering 17
me 17
out 17
but 17
by 17
the 17
shuffling 17
that 17
follows 17
i 17
know 17
gale 17
has 17
somehow 17
detained 17
him 17
for 17
answers 17
i 17
cross 17
to 17
venia 17
who 17
was 17
always 17
the 17
strongest 17
i 17
crouch 17
down 17
and 17
take 17
her 17
icy 17
hands 17
which 17
clutch 17
mine 17
like 17
vises 17
what 17
happened 17
venia 17
i 17
ask 17
what 17
are 17
you 17
doing 17
here 17
they 17
took 17
us 17
from 17
the 17
capitol 17
she 17
says 17
hoarsely 17
plutarch 17
enters 17
behind 17
me 17
what 17
on 17
earth 17
is 17
going 17
on 17
who 17
took 17
you 17
i 17
press 17
her 17
people 17
she 17
says 17
vaguely 17
the 17
night 17
you 17
broke 17
out 17
we 17
thought 17
it 17
might 17
be 17
comforting 17
for 17
you 17
to 17
have 17
your 17
regular 17
team 17
plutarch 17
says 17
behind 17
me 17
cinna 17
requested 17
it 17
cinna 17
requested 17
this 17
i 17
snarl 17
at 17
him 17
because 17
if 17
theres 17
one 17
thing 17
i 17
know 17
its 17
that 17
cinna 17
would 17
never 17
have 17
approved 17
the 17
abuse 17
of 17
these 17
three 17
who 17
he 17
managed 17
with 17
gentleness 17
and 17
patience 17
why 17
are 17
they 17
being 17
treated 17
like 17
criminals 17
i 17
honestly 17
dont 17
know 17
theres 17
something 17
in 17
his 17
voice 17
that 17
makes 17
me 17
believe 17
him 17
and 17
the 17
pallor 17
on 17
fulvias 17
face 17
confirms 17
it 17
plutarch 17
turns 17
to 17
the 17
guard 17
whos 17
just 17
appeared 17
in 17
the 17
doorway 17
with 17
gale 17
right 17
behind 17
him 17
i 17
was 17
only 17
told 17
they 17
were 17
being 17
confined 17
why 17
are 17
they 17
being 17
punished 17
for 17
stealing 17
food 17
we 17
had 17
to 17
restrain 17
them 17
after 17
an 17
altercation 17
over 17
some 17
bread 17
says 17
the 17
guard 17
venias 17
brows 17
come 17
together 17
as 17
if 17
shes 17
still 17
trying 17
to 17
make 17
sense 17
of 17
it 17
no 17
one 17
would 17
tell 17
us 17
anything 17
we 17
were 17
so 17
hungry 17
it 17
was 17
just 17
one 17
slice 17
she 17
took 17
octavia 17
begins 17
to 17
sob 17
muffling 17
the 17
sound 17
in 17
her 17
ragged 17
tunic 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
how 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
i 17
survived 17
the 17
arena 17
octavia 17
sneaked 17
me 17
a 17
roll 17
under 17
the 17
table 17
because 17
she 17
couldnt 17
bear 17
my 17
hunger 17
i 17
crawl 17
across 17
to 17
her 17
shaking 17
form 17
octavia 17
i 17
touch 17
her 17
and 17
she 17
flinches 17
octavia 17
its 17
going 17
to 17
be 17
all 17
right 17
ill 17
get 17
you 17
out 17
of 17
here 17
okay 17
this 17
seems 17
extreme 17
says 17
plutarch 17
its 17
because 17
they 17
took 17
a 17
slice 17
of 17
bread 17
asks 17
gale 17
there 17
were 17
repeated 17
infractions 17
leading 17
up 17
to 17
that 17
they 17
were 17
warned 17
still 17
they 17
took 17
more 17
bread 17
the 17
guard 17
pauses 17
a 17
moment 17
as 17
if 17
puzzled 17
by 17
our 17
density 17
you 17
cant 17
take 17
bread 17
i 17
cant 17
get 17
octavia 17
to 17
uncover 17
her 17
face 17
but 17
she 17
lifts 17
it 17
slightly 17
the 17
shackles 17
on 17
her 17
wrists 17
shift 17
down 17
a 17
few 17
inches 17
revealing 17
raw 17
sores 17
beneath 17
them 17
im 17
bringing 17
you 17
to 17
my 17
mother 17
i 17
address 17
the 17
guard 17
unchain 17
them 17
the 17
guard 17
shakes 17
his 17
head 17
its 17
not 17
authorized 17
unchain 17
them 17
now 17
i 17
yell 17
this 17
breaks 17
his 17
composure 17
average 17
citizens 17
dont 17
address 17
him 17
this 17
way 17
i 17
have 17
no 17
release 17
orders 17
and 17
you 17
have 17
no 17
authority 17
to 17
do 17
it 17
on 17
my 17
authority 17
says 17
plutarch 17
we 17
came 17
to 17
collect 17
these 17
three 17
anyway 17
theyre 17
needed 17
for 17
special 17
defense 17
ill 17
take 17
full 17
responsibility 17
the 17
guard 17
leaves 17
to 17
make 17
a 17
call 17
he 17
returns 17
with 17
a 17
set 17
of 17
keys 17
the 17
preps 17
have 17
been 17
forced 17
into 17
cramped 17
body 17
positions 17
for 17
so 17
long 17
that 17
even 17
once 17
the 17
shackles 17
are 17
removed 17
they 17
have 17
trouble 17
walking 17
gale 17
plutarch 17
and 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
help 17
them 17
flaviuss 17
foot 17
catches 17
on 17
a 17
metal 17
grate 17
over 17
a 17
circular 17
opening 17
in 17
the 17
floor 17
and 17
my 17
stomach 17
contracts 17
when 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
why 17
a 17
room 17
would 17
need 17
a 17
drain 17
the 17
stains 17
of 17
human 17
misery 17
that 17
must 17
have 17
been 17
hosed 17
off 17
these 17
white 17
tiles 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17
i 17
find 17
my 17
mother 17
the 17
only 17
one 17
i 17
trust 17
to 17
care 17
for 17
them 17
it 17
takes 17
her 17
a 17
minute 17
to 17
place 17
the 17
three 17
given 17
their 17
current 17
condition 17
but 17
already 17
she 17
wears 17
a 17
look 17
of 17
consternation 17
and 17
i 17
know 17
its 17
not 17
a 17
result 17
of 17
seeing 17
abused 17
bodies 17
because 17
they 17
were 17
her 17
daily 17
fare 17
in 17
district 17
but 17
the 17
realization 17
that 17
this 17
sort 17
of 17
thing 17
goes 17
on 17
in 17
as 17
well 17
my 17
mother 17
was 17
welcomed 17
into 17
the 17
hospital 17
but 17
shes 17
viewed 17
as 17
more 17
of 17
a 17
nurse 17
than 17
a 17
doctor 17
despite 17
her 17
lifetime 17
of 17
healing 17
still 17
no 17
one 17
interferes 17
when 17
she 17
guides 17
the 17
trio 17
into 17
an 17
examination 17
room 17
to 17
assess 17
their 17
injuries 17
i 17
plant 17
myself 17
on 17
a 17
bench 17
in 17
the 17
hall 17
outside 17
the 17
hospital 17
entrance 17
waiting 17
to 17
hear 17
her 17
verdict 17
she 17
will 17
be 17
able 17
to 17
read 17
in 17
their 17
bodies 17
the 17
pain 17
inflicted 17
upon 17
them 17
gale 17
sits 17
next 17
to 17
me 17
and 17
puts 17
an 17
arm 17
around 17
my 17
shoulder 17
shell 17
fix 17
them 17
up 17
i 17
give 17
a 17
nod 17
wondering 17
if 17
hes 17
thinking 17
about 17
his 17
own 17
brutal 17
flogging 17
back 17
in 17
plutarch 17
and 17
fulvia 17
take 17
the 17
bench 17
across 17
from 17
us 17
but 17
dont 17
offer 17
any 17
comments 17
on 17
the 17
state 17
of 17
my 17
prep 17
team 17
if 17
they 17
had 17
no 17
knowledge 17
of 17
the 17
mistreatment 17
then 17
what 17
do 17
they 17
make 17
of 17
this 17
move 17
on 17
president 17
coins 17
part 17
i 17
decide 17
to 17
help 17
them 17
out 17
i 17
guess 17
weve 17
all 17
been 17
put 17
on 17
notice 17
i 17
say 17
what 17
no 17
what 17
do 17
you 17
mean 17
asks 17
fulvia 17
punishing 17
my 17
prep 17
teams 17
a 17
warning 17
i 17
tell 17
her 17
not 17
just 17
to 17
me 17
but 17
to 17
you 17
too 17
about 17
whos 17
really 17
in 17
control 17
and 17
what 17
happens 17
if 17
shes 17
not 17
obeyed 17
if 17
you 17
had 17
any 17
delusions 17
about 17
having 17
power 17
id 17
let 17
them 17
go 17
now 17
apparently 17
a 17
capitol 17
pedigree 17
is 17
no 17
protection 17
here 17
maybe 17
its 17
even 17
a 17
liability 17
there 17
is 17
no 17
comparison 17
between 17
plutarch 17
who 17
masterminded 17
the 17
rebel 17
breakout 17
and 17
those 17
three 17
beauticians 17
says 17
fulvia 17
icily 17
i 17
shrug 17
if 17
you 17
say 17
so 17
fulvia 17
but 17
what 17
would 17
happen 17
if 17
you 17
got 17
on 17
coins 17
bad 17
side 17
my 17
prep 17
team 17
was 17
kidnapped 17
they 17
can 17
at 17
least 17
hope 17
to 17
one 17
day 17
return 17
to 17
the 17
capitol 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
can 17
live 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
but 17
you 17
where 17
would 17
you 17
two 17
run 17
perhaps 17
were 17
a 17
little 17
more 17
necessary 17
to 17
the 17
war 17
effort 17
than 17
you 17
give 17
us 17
credit 17
for 17
says 17
plutarch 17
unconcerned 17
of 17
course 17
you 17
are 17
the 17
tributes 17
were 17
necessary 17
to 17
the 17
games 17
too 17
until 17
they 17
werent 17
i 17
say 17
and 17
then 17
we 17
were 17
very 17
disposableright 17
plutarch 17
that 17
ends 17
the 17
conversation 17
we 17
wait 17
in 17
silence 17
until 17
my 17
mother 17
finds 17
us 17
theyll 17
be 17
all 17
right 17
she 17
reports 17
no 17
permanent 17
physical 17
injuries 17
good 17
splendid 17
says 17
plutarch 17
how 17
soon 17
can 17
they 17
be 17
put 17
to 17
work 17
probably 17
tomorrow 17
she 17
answers 17
youll 17
have 17
to 17
expect 17
some 17
emotional 17
instability 17
after 17
what 17
theyve 17
been 17
through 17
they 17
were 17
particularly 17
ill 17
prepared 17
coming 17
from 17
their 17
life 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
werent 17
we 17
all 17
says 17
plutarch 17
either 17
because 17
the 17
prep 17
teams 17
incapacitated 17
or 17
im 17
too 17
on 17
edge 17
plutarch 17
releases 17
me 17
from 17
mockingjay 17
duties 17
for 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
day 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
head 17
down 17
to 17
lunch 17
where 17
were 17
served 17
bean 17
and 17
onion 17
stew 17
a 17
thick 17
slice 17
of 17
bread 17
and 17
a 17
cup 17
of 17
water 17
after 17
venias 17
story 17
the 17
bread 17
sticks 17
in 17
my 17
throat 17
so 17
i 17
slide 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
it 17
onto 17
gales 17
tray 17
neither 17
of 17
us 17
speaks 17
much 17
during 17
lunch 17
but 17
when 17
our 17
bowls 17
are 17
clean 17
gale 17
pulls 17
up 17
his 17
sleeve 17
revealing 17
his 17
schedule 17
ive 17
got 17
training 17
next 17
i 17
tug 17
up 17
my 17
sleeve 17
and 17
hold 17
my 17
arm 17
next 17
to 17
his 17
me 17
too 17
i 17
remember 17
that 17
training 17
equals 17
hunting 17
now 17
my 17
eagerness 17
to 17
escape 17
into 17
the 17
woods 17
if 17
only 17
for 17
two 17
hours 17
overrides 17
my 17
current 17
concerns 17
an 17
immersion 17
into 17
greenery 17
and 17
sunlight 17
will 17
surely 17
help 17
me 17
sort 17
out 17
my 17
thoughts 17
once 17
off 17
the 17
main 17
corridors 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
race 17
like 17
schoolchildren 17
for 17
the 17
armory 17
and 17
by 17
the 17
time 17
we 17
arrive 17
im 17
breathless 17
and 17
dizzy 17
a 17
reminder 17
that 17
im 17
not 17
fully 17
recovered 17
the 17
guards 17
provide 17
our 17
old 17
weapons 17
as 17
well 17
as 17
knives 17
and 17
a 17
burlap 17
sack 17
thats 17
meant 17
for 17
a 17
game 17
bag 17
i 17
tolerate 17
having 17
the 17
tracker 17
clamped 17
to 17
my 17
ankle 17
try 17
to 17
look 17
as 17
if 17
im 17
listening 17
when 17
they 17
explain 17
how 17
to 17
use 17
the 17
handheld 17
communicator 17
the 17
only 17
thing 17
that 17
sticks 17
in 17
my 17
head 17
is 17
that 17
it 17
has 17
a 17
clock 17
and 17
we 17
must 17
be 17
back 17
inside 17
by 17
the 17
designated 17
hour 17
or 17
our 17
hunting 17
privileges 17
will 17
be 17
revoked 17
this 17
is 17
one 17
rule 17
i 17
think 17
i 17
will 17
make 17
an 17
effort 17
to 17
abide 17
we 17
go 17
outside 17
into 17
the 17
large 17
fencedin 17
training 17
area 17
beside 17
the 17
woods 17
guards 17
open 17
the 17
welloiled 17
gates 17
without 17
comment 17
we 17
would 17
be 17
hardpressed 17
to 17
get 17
past 17
this 17
fence 17
on 17
our 17
ownthirty 17
feet 17
high 17
and 17
always 17
buzzing 17
with 17
electricity 17
topped 17
with 17
razorsharp 17
curls 17
of 17
steel 17
we 17
move 17
through 17
the 17
woods 17
until 17
the 17
view 17
of 17
the 17
fence 17
has 17
been 17
obscured 17
in 17
a 17
small 17
clearing 17
we 17
pause 17
and 17
drop 17
back 17
our 17
heads 17
to 17
bask 17
in 17
the 17
sunlight 17
i 17
turn 17
in 17
a 17
circle 17
my 17
arms 17
extended 17
at 17
my 17
sides 17
revolving 17
slowly 17
so 17
as 17
not 17
to 17
set 17
the 17
world 17
spinning 17
the 17
lack 17
of 17
rain 17
i 17
saw 17
in 17
has 17
damaged 17
the 17
plants 17
here 17
as 17
well 17
leaving 17
some 17
with 17
brittle 17
leaves 17
building 17
a 17
crunchy 17
carpet 17
under 17
our 17
feet 17
we 17
take 17
off 17
our 17
shoes 17
mine 17
dont 17
fit 17
right 17
anyway 17
since 17
in 17
the 17
spirit 17
of 17
wastenotwantnot 17
that 17
rules 17
i 17
was 17
issued 17
a 17
pair 17
someone 17
had 17
outgrown 17
apparently 17
one 17
of 17
us 17
walks 17
funny 17
because 17
theyre 17
broken 17
in 17
all 17
wrong 17
we 17
hunt 17
like 17
in 17
the 17
old 17
days 17
silent 17
needing 17
no 17
words 17
to 17
communicate 17
because 17
here 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
we 17
move 17
as 17
two 17
parts 17
of 17
one 17
being 17
anticipating 17
each 17
others 17
movements 17
watching 17
each 17
others 17
backs 17
how 17
long 17
has 17
it 17
been 17
eight 17
months 17
nine 17
since 17
we 17
had 17
this 17
freedom 17
its 17
not 17
exactly 17
the 17
same 17
given 17
all 17
thats 17
happened 17
and 17
the 17
trackers 17
on 17
our 17
ankles 17
and 17
the 17
fact 17
that 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
rest 17
so 17
often 17
but 17
its 17
about 17
as 17
close 17
to 17
happiness 17
as 17
i 17
think 17
i 17
can 17
currently 17
get 17
the 17
animals 17
here 17
are 17
not 17
nearly 17
suspicious 17
enough 17
that 17
extra 17
moment 17
it 17
takes 17
to 17
place 17
our 17
unfamiliar 17
scent 17
means 17
their 17
death 17
in 17
an 17
hour 17
and 17
a 17
half 17
weve 17
got 17
a 17
mixed 17
dozenrabbits 17
squirrels 17
and 17
turkeysand 17
decide 17
to 17
knock 17
off 17
to 17
spend 17
the 17
remaining 17
time 17
by 17
a 17
pond 17
that 17
must 17
be 17
fed 17
by 17
an 17
underground 17
spring 17
since 17
the 17
waters 17
cool 17
and 17
sweet 17
when 17
gale 17
offers 17
to 17
clean 17
the 17
game 17
i 17
dont 17
object 17
i 17
stick 17
a 17
few 17
mint 17
leaves 17
on 17
my 17
tongue 17
close 17
my 17
eyes 17
and 17
lean 17
back 17
against 17
a 17
rock 17
soaking 17
in 17
the 17
sounds 17
letting 17
the 17
scorching 17
afternoon 17
sun 17
burn 17
my 17
skin 17
almost 17
at 17
peace 17
until 17
gales 17
voice 17
interrupts 17
me 17
katniss 17
why 17
do 17
you 17
care 17
so 17
much 17
about 17
your 17
prep 17
team 17
i 17
open 17
my 17
eyes 17
to 17
see 17
if 17
hes 17
joking 17
but 17
hes 17
frowning 17
down 17
at 17
the 17
rabbit 17
hes 17
skinning 17
why 17
shouldnt 17
i 17
hm 17
lets 17
see 17
because 17
theyve 17
spent 17
the 17
last 17
year 17
prettying 17
you 17
up 17
for 17
slaughter 17
he 17
suggests 17
its 17
more 17
complicated 17
than 17
that 17
i 17
know 17
them 17
theyre 17
not 17
evil 17
or 17
cruel 17
theyre 17
not 17
even 17
smart 17
hurting 17
them 17
its 17
like 17
hurting 17
children 17
they 17
dont 17
seei 17
mean 17
they 17
dont 17
know 17
i 17
get 17
knotted 17
up 17
in 17
my 17
words 17
they 17
dont 17
know 17
what 17
katniss 17
he 17
says 17
that 17
tributeswho 17
are 17
the 17
actual 17
children 17
involved 17
here 17
not 17
your 17
trio 17
of 17
freaksare 17
forced 17
to 17
fight 17
to 17
the 17
death 17
that 17
you 17
were 17
going 17
into 17
that 17
arena 17
for 17
peoples 17
amusement 17
was 17
that 17
a 17
big 17
secret 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
no 17
but 17
they 17
dont 17
view 17
it 17
the 17
way 17
we 17
do 17
i 17
say 17
theyre 17
raised 17
on 17
it 17
and 17
are 17
you 17
actually 17
defending 17
them 17
he 17
slips 17
the 17
skin 17
from 17
the 17
rabbit 17
in 17
one 17
quick 17
move 17
that 17
stings 17
because 17
in 17
fact 17
i 17
am 17
and 17
its 17
ridiculous 17
i 17
struggle 17
to 17
find 17
a 17
logical 17
position 17
i 17
guess 17
im 17
defending 17
anyone 17
whos 17
treated 17
like 17
that 17
for 17
taking 17
a 17
slice 17
of 17
bread 17
maybe 17
it 17
reminds 17
me 17
too 17
much 17
of 17
what 17
happened 17
to 17
you 17
over 17
a 17
turkey 17
still 17
hes 17
right 17
it 17
does 17
seem 17
strange 17
my 17
level 17
of 17
concern 17
over 17
the 17
prep 17
team 17
i 17
should 17
hate 17
them 17
and 17
want 17
to 17
see 17
them 17
strung 17
up 17
but 17
theyre 17
so 17
clueless 17
and 17
they 17
belonged 17
to 17
cinna 17
and 17
he 17
was 17
on 17
my 17
side 17
right 17
im 17
not 17
looking 17
for 17
a 17
fight 17
gale 17
says 17
but 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
coin 17
was 17
sending 17
you 17
some 17
big 17
message 17
by 17
punishing 17
them 17
for 17
breaking 17
the 17
rules 17
here 17
she 17
probably 17
thought 17
youd 17
see 17
it 17
as 17
a 17
favor 17
he 17
stuffs 17
the 17
rabbit 17
in 17
the 17
sack 17
and 17
rises 17
we 17
better 17
get 17
going 17
if 17
we 17
want 17
to 17
make 17
it 17
back 17
on 17
time 17
i 17
ignore 17
his 17
offer 17
of 17
a 17
hand 17
up 17
and 17
get 17
to 17
my 17
feet 17
unsteadily 17
fine 17
neither 17
of 17
us 17
talks 17
on 17
the 17
way 17
back 17
but 17
once 17
were 17
inside 17
the 17
gate 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
something 17
else 17
during 17
the 17
quarter 17
quell 17
octavia 17
and 17
flavius 17
had 17
to 17
quit 17
because 17
they 17
couldnt 17
stop 17
crying 17
over 17
me 17
going 17
back 17
in 17
and 17
venia 17
could 17
barely 17
say 17
goodbye 17
ill 17
try 17
and 17
keep 17
that 17
in 17
mind 17
as 17
theyremake 17
you 17
says 17
gale 17
do 17
i 17
say 17
we 17
hand 17
the 17
meat 17
over 17
to 17
greasy 17
sae 17
in 17
the 17
kitchen 17
she 17
likes 17
district 17
well 17
enough 17
even 17
though 17
she 17
thinks 17
the 17
cooks 17
are 17
somewhat 17
lacking 17
in 17
imagination 17
but 17
a 17
woman 17
who 17
came 17
up 17
with 17
a 17
palatable 17
wild 17
dog 17
and 17
rhubarb 17
stew 17
is 17
bound 17
to 17
feel 17
as 17
if 17
her 17
hands 17
are 17
tied 17
here 17
exhausted 17
from 17
hunting 17
and 17
my 17
lack 17
of 17
sleep 17
i 17
go 17
back 17
to 17
my 17
compartment 17
to 17
find 17
it 17
stripped 17
bare 17
only 17
to 17
remember 17
weve 17
been 17
moved 17
because 17
of 17
buttercup 17
i 17
make 17
my 17
way 17
up 17
to 17
the 17
top 17
floor 17
and 17
find 17
compartment 17
e 17
it 17
looks 17
exactly 17
like 17
compartment 17
except 17
for 17
the 17
window 17
two 17
feet 17
wide 17
eight 17
inches 17
highcentered 17
at 17
the 17
top 17
of 17
the 17
outside 17
wall 17
theres 17
a 17
heavy 17
metal 17
plate 17
that 17
fastens 17
over 17
it 17
but 17
right 17
now 17
its 17
propped 17
open 17
and 17
a 17
certain 17
cat 17
is 17
nowhere 17
to 17
be 17
seen 17
i 17
stretch 17
out 17
on 17
my 17
bed 17
and 17
a 17
shaft 17
of 17
afternoon 17
sunlight 17
plays 17
on 17
my 17
face 17
the 17
next 17
thing 17
i 17
know 17
my 17
sister 17
is 17
waking 17
me 17
for 17
reflection 17
prim 17
tells 17
me 17
theyve 17
been 17
announcing 17
the 17
assembly 17
since 17
lunch 17
the 17
entire 17
population 17
except 17
those 17
needed 17
for 17
essential 17
jobs 17
is 17
required 17
to 17
attend 17
we 17
follow 17
directions 17
to 17
the 17
collective 17
a 17
huge 17
room 17
that 17
easily 17
holds 17
the 17
thousands 17
who 17
show 17
up 17
you 17
can 17
tell 17
it 17
was 17
built 17
for 17
a 17
larger 17
gathering 17
and 17
perhaps 17
it 17
held 17
one 17
before 17
the 17
pox 17
epidemic 17
prim 17
quietly 17
points 17
out 17
the 17
widespread 17
fallout 17
from 17
that 17
disaster 17
the 17
pox 17
scars 17
on 17
peoples 17
bodies 17
the 17
slightly 17
disfigured 17
children 17
theyve 17
suffered 17
a 17
lot 17
here 17
she 17
says 17
after 17
this 17
morning 17
im 17
in 17
no 17
mood 17
to 17
feel 17
sorry 17
for 17
no 17
more 17
than 17
we 17
did 17
in 17
twelve 17
i 17
say 17
i 17
see 17
my 17
mother 17
lead 17
in 17
a 17
group 17
of 17
mobile 17
patients 17
still 17
wearing 17
their 17
hospital 17
nightgowns 17
and 17
robes 17
finnick 17
stands 17
among 17
them 17
looking 17
dazed 17
but 17
gorgeous 17
in 17
his 17
hands 17
he 17
holds 17
a 17
piece 17
of 17
thin 17
rope 17
less 17
than 17
a 17
foot 17
in 17
length 17
too 17
short 17
for 17
even 17
him 17
to 17
fashion 17
into 17
a 17
usable 17
noose 17
his 17
fingers 17
move 17
rapidly 17
automatically 17
tying 17
and 17
unraveling 17
various 17
knots 17
as 17
he 17
gazes 17
about 17
probably 17
part 17
of 17
his 17
therapy 17
i 17
cross 17
to 17
him 17
and 17
say 17
hey 17
finnick 17
he 17
doesnt 17
seem 17
to 17
notice 17
so 17
i 17
nudge 17
him 17
to 17
get 17
his 17
attention 17
finnick 17
how 17
are 17
you 17
doing 17
katniss 17
he 17
says 17
gripping 17
my 17
hand 17
relieved 17
to 17
see 17
a 17
familiar 17
face 17
i 17
think 17
why 17

other 17
tributes 17
immunity 17
if 17
the 17
rebels 17
won 17

of 17

front 17
of 17
the 17
room 17

habit 17
of 17
punishing 17
anyone 17
that 17
frail 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
the 17
scene 17
i 17
walked 17
in 17
on 17
this 17
morning 17
of 17
octavia 17
huddled 17
against 17
the 17
wall 17
of 17
how 17
coin 17
and 17
i 17
must 17
have 17
vastly 17
different 17
definitions 17
of 17
frailty 17
but 17
i 17
only 17
say 17
no 17
then 17
it 17
shouldnt 17
be 17
a 17
problem 17
to 17
add 17
annie 17
all 17
right 17
says 17
the 17
president 17
penciling 17
in 17
annies 17
name 17
do 17
you 17
want 17
to 17
be 17
up 17
here 17
with 17
me 17
for 17
the 17
announcement 17
i 17
shake 17
my 17
head 17
i 17
didnt 17
think 17
so 17
better 17
hurry 17
and 17
lose 17
yourself 17
in 17
the 17
crowd 17
im 17
about 17
to 17
begin 17
i 17
make 17
my 17
way 17
back 17
to 17
finnick 17
words 17
are 17
another 17
thing 17
not 17
wasted 17
in 17
coin 17
calls 17
the 17
audience 17
to 17
attention 17
and 17
tells 17
them 17
i 17
have 17
consented 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
provided 17
the 17
other 17
victorspeeta 17
johanna 17
enobaria 17
and 17
anniewill 17
be 17
granted 17
full 17
pardon 17
for 17
any 17
damage 17
they 17
do 17
to 17
the 17
rebel 17
cause 17
in 17
the 17
rumbling 17
of 17
the 17
crowd 17
i 17
hear 17
the 17
dissent 17
i 17
suppose 17
no 17
one 17
doubted 17
i 17
would 17
want 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
so 17
naming 17
a 17
priceone 17
that 17
spares 17
possible 17
enemiesangers 17
them 17
i 17
stand 17
indifferent 17
to 17
the 17
hostile 17
looks 17
thrown 17
my 17
way 17
the 17
president 17
allows 17
a 17
few 17
moments 17
of 17
unrest 17
and 17
then 17
continues 17
in 17
her 17
brisk 17
fashion 17
only 17
now 17
the 17
words 17
coming 17
out 17
of 17
her 17
mouth 17
are 17
news 17
to 17
me 17
but 17
in 17
return 17
for 17
this 17
unprecedented 17
request 17
soldier 17
everdeen 17
has 17
promised 17
to 17
devote 17
herself 17
to 17
our 17
cause 17
it 17
follows 17
that 17
any 17
deviance 17
from 17
her 17
mission 17
in 17
either 17
motive 17
or 17
deed 17
will 17
be 17
viewed 17
as 17
a 17
break 17
in 17
this 17
agreement 17
the 17
immunity 17
would 17
be 17
terminated 17
and 17
the 17
fate 17
of 17
the 17
four 17
victors 17
determined 17
by 17
the 17
law 17
of 17
district 17
thirteen 17
as 17
would 17
her 17
own 17
thank 17
you 17
in 17
other 17
words 17
i 17
step 17
out 17
of 17
line 17
and 17
were 17
all 17
dead 17
another 17
force 17
to 17
contend 17
with 17
another 17
power 17
player 17
who 17
has 17
decided 17
to 17
use 17
me 17
as 17
a 17
piece 17
in 17
her 17
games 17
although 17
things 17
never 17
seem 17
to 17
go 17
according 17
to 17
plan 17
first 17
there 17
were 17
the 17
gamemakers 17
making 17
me 17
their 17
star 17
and 17
then 17
scrambling 17
to 17
recover 17
from 17
that 17
handful 17
of 17
poisonous 17
berries 17
then 17
president 17
snow 17
trying 17
to 17
use 17
me 17
to 17
put 17
out 17
the 17
flames 17
of 17
rebellion 17
only 17
to 17
have 17
my 17
every 17
move 17
become 17
inflammatory 17
next 17
the 17
rebels 17
ensnaring 17
me 17
in 17
the 17
metal 17
claw 17
that 17
lifted 17
me 17
from 17
the 17
arena 17
designating 17
me 17
to 17
be 17
their 17
mockingjay 17
and 17
then 17
having 17
to 17
recover 17
from 17
the 17
shock 17
that 17
i 17
might 17
not 17
want 17
the 17
wings 17
and 17
now 17
coin 17
with 17
her 17
fistful 17
of 17
precious 17
nukes 17
and 17
her 17
welloiled 17
machine 17
of 17
a 17
district 17
finding 17
its 17
even 17
harder 17
to 17
groom 17
a 17
mockingjay 17
than 17
to 17
catch 17
one 17
but 17
she 17
has 17
been 17
the 17
quickest 17
to 17
determine 17
that 17
i 17
have 17
an 17
agenda 17
of 17
my 17
own 17
and 17
am 17
therefore 17
not 17
to 17
be 17
trusted 17
she 17
has 17
been 17
the 17
first 17
to 17
publicly 17
brand 17
me 17
as 17
a 17
threat 17
i 17
run 17
my 17
fingers 17
through 17
the 17
thick 17
layer 17
of 17
bubbles 17
in 17
my 17
tub 17
cleaning 17
me 17
up 17
is 17
just 17
a 17
preliminary 17
step 17
to 17
determining 17
my 17
new 17
look 17
with 17
my 17
aciddamaged 17
hair 17
sunburned 17
skin 17
and 17
ugly 17
scars 17
the 17
prep 17
team 17
has 17
to 17
make 17
me 17
pretty 17
and 17
then 17
damage 17
burn 17
and 17
scar 17
me 17
in 17
a 17
more 17
attractive 17
way 17
remake 17
her 17
to 17
beauty 17
base 17
zero 17
fulvia 17
ordered 17
first 17
thing 17
this 17
morning 17
well 17
work 17
from 17
there 17
beauty 17
base 17
zero 17
turns 17
out 17
to 17
be 17
what 17
a 17
person 17
would 17
look 17
like 17
if 17
they 17
stepped 17
out 17
of 17
bed 17
looking 17
flawless 17
but 17
natural 17
it 17
means 17
my 17
nails 17
are 17
perfectly 17
shaped 17
but 17
not 17
polished 17
my 17
hair 17
soft 17
and 17
shiny 17
but 17
not 17
styled 17
my 17
skin 17
smooth 17
and 17
clear 17
but 17
not 17
painted 17
wax 17
the 17
body 17
hair 17
and 17
erase 17
the 17
dark 17
circles 17
but 17
dont 17
make 17
any 17
noticeable 17
enhancements 17
i 17
suppose 17
cinna 17
gave 17
the 17
same 17
instructions 17
the 17
first 17
day 17
i 17
arrived 17
as 17
a 17
tribute 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
only 17
that 17
was 17
different 17
since 17
i 17
was 17
a 17
contestant 17
as 17
a 17
rebel 17
i 17
thought 17
id 17
get 17
to 17
look 17
more 17
like 17
myself 17
but 17
it 17
seems 17
a 17
televised 17
rebel 17
has 17
her 17
own 17
standards 17
to 17
live 17
up 17
to 17
after 17
i 17
rinse 17
the 17
lather 17
from 17
my 17
body 17
i 17
turn 17
to 17
find 17
octavia 17
waiting 17
with 17
a 17
towel 17
she 17
is 17
so 17
altered 17
from 17
the 17
woman 17
i 17
knew 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
stripped 17
of 17
the 17
gaudy 17
clothing 17
the 17
heavy 17
makeup 17
the 17
dyes 17
and 17
jewelry 17
and 17
knickknacks 17
she 17
adorned 17
her 17
hair 17
with 17
i 17
remember 17
how 17
one 17
day 17
she 17
showed 17
up 17
with 17
bright 17
pink 17
tresses 17
studded 17
with 17
blinking 17
colored 17
lights 17
shaped 17
like 17
mice 17
she 17
told 17
me 17
she 17
had 17
several 17
mice 17
at 17
home 17
as 17
pets 17
the 17
thought 17
repulsed 17
me 17
at 17
the 17
time 17
since 17
we 17
consider 17
mice 17
vermin 17
unless 17
cooked 17
but 17
perhaps 17
octavia 17
liked 17
them 17
because 17
they 17
were 17
small 17
soft 17
and 17
squeaky 17
like 17
her 17
as 17
she 17
pats 17
me 17
dry 17
i 17
try 17
to 17
become 17
acquainted 17
with 17
the 17
district 17
octavia 17
her 17
real 17
hair 17
turns 17
out 17
to 17
be 17
a 17
nice 17
auburn 17
her 17
face 17
is 17
ordinary 17
but 17
has 17
an 17
undeniable 17
sweetness 17
shes 17
younger 17
than 17
i 17
thought 17
maybe 17
early 17
twenties 17
devoid 17
of 17
the 17
threeinch 17
decorative 17
nails 17
her 17
fingers 17
appear 17
almost 17
stubby 17
and 17
they 17
cant 17
stop 17
trembling 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
tell 17
her 17
its 17
okay 17
that 17
ill 17
see 17
that 17
coin 17
never 17
hurts 17
her 17
again 17
but 17
the 17
multicolored 17
bruises 17
flowering 17
under 17
her 17
green 17
skin 17
only 17
remind 17
me 17
how 17
impotent 17
i 17
am 17
flavius 17
too 17
appears 17
washed 17
out 17
without 17
his 17
purple 17
lipstick 17
and 17
bright 17
clothes 17
hes 17
managed 17
to 17
get 17
his 17
orange 17
ringlets 17
back 17
in 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
order 17
though 17
its 17
venia 17
whos 17
the 17
least 17
changed 17
her 17
aqua 17
hair 17
lies 17
flat 17
instead 17
of 17
in 17
spikes 17
and 17
you 17
can 17
see 17
the 17
roots 17
growing 17
in 17
gray 17
however 17
the 17
tattoos 17
were 17
always 17
her 17
most 17
striking 17
characteristic 17
and 17
theyre 17
as 17
golden 17
and 17
shocking 17
as 17
ever 17
she 17
comes 17
and 17
takes 17
the 17
towel 17
from 17
octavias 17
hands 17
katniss 17
is 17
not 17
going 17
to 17
hurt 17
us 17
she 17
says 17
quietly 17
but 17
firmly 17
to 17
octavia 17
katniss 17
did 17
not 17
even 17
know 17
we 17
were 17
here 17
things 17
will 17
be 17
better 17
now 17
octavia 17
gives 17
a 17
slight 17
nod 17
but 17
doesnt 17
dare 17
look 17
me 17
in 17
the 17
eye 17
its 17
no 17
simple 17
job 17
getting 17
me 17
back 17
to 17
beauty 17
base 17
zero 17
even 17
with 17
the 17
elaborate 17
arsenal 17
of 17
products 17
tools 17
and 17
gadgets 17
plutarch 17
had 17
the 17
foresight 17
to 17
bring 17
from 17
the 17
capitol 17
my 17
preps 17
do 17
pretty 17
well 17
until 17
they 17
try 17
to 17
address 17
the 17
spot 17
on 17
my 17
arm 17
where 17
johanna 17
dug 17
out 17
the 17
tracker 17
none 17
of 17
the 17
medical 17
team 17
was 17
focusing 17
on 17
looks 17
when 17
they 17
patched 17
up 17
the 17
gaping 17
hole 17
now 17
i 17
have 17
a 17
lumpy 17
jagged 17
scar 17
that 17
ripples 17
out 17
over 17
a 17
space 17
the 17
size 17
of 17
an 17
apple 17
usually 17
my 17
sleeve 17
covers 17
it 17
but 17
the 17
way 17
cinnas 17
mockingjay 17
costume 17
is 17
designed 17
the 17
sleeves 17
stop 17
just 17
above 17
the 17
elbow 17
its 17
such 17
a 17
concern 17
that 17
fulvia 17
and 17
plutarch 17
are 17
called 17
in 17
to 17
discuss 17
it 17
i 17
swear 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
it 17
triggers 17
fulvias 17
gag 17
reflex 17
for 17
someone 17
who 17
works 17
with 17
a 17
gamemaker 17
shes 17
awfully 17
sensitive 17
but 17
i 17
guess 17
shes 17
used 17
to 17
seeing 17
unpleasant 17
things 17
only 17
on 17
a 17
screen 17
everyone 17
knows 17
i 17
have 17
a 17
scar 17
here 17
i 17
say 17
sullenly 17
knowing 17
it 17
and 17
seeing 17
it 17
are 17
two 17
different 17
things 17
says 17
fulvia 17
its 17
positively 17
repulsive 17
plutarch 17
and 17
i 17
will 17
think 17
of 17
something 17
during 17
lunch 17
itll 17
be 17
fine 17
says 17
plutarch 17
with 17
a 17
dismissive 17
wave 17
of 17
his 17
hand 17
maybe 17
an 17
armband 17
or 17
something 17

at 17

covert 17
glances 17
and 17
quiet 17
murmurs 17
i 17
usually 17
evoke 17
are 17
nothing 17
compared 17
to 17
the 17
reaction 17
brought 17
on 17
by 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
my 17
bizarrelooking 17
prep 17
team 17
the 17
gaping 17
mouths 17

follow 17
me 17
through 17
the 17
line 17
accepting 17
bowls 17
of 17
grayish 17
fish 17

a 17
group 17
from 17
the 17
seam 17
they 17
show 17
a 17
little 17
more 17
restraint 17
than 17
the 17
people 17
from 17
do 17
although 17
it 17
may 17
just 17
be 17
from 17
embarrassment 17

wouldnt 17
let 17
that 17
get 17
cold 17
it 17

improve 17
the 17
consistency 17
everyone 17
gets 17
down 17
to 17
eating 17
the 17
stew 17
doesnt 17
taste 17
bad 17
but 17
theres 17
a 17
certain 17
sliminess 17
thats 17
hard 17
to 17
get 17
around 17
like 17
you 17
have 17
to 17
swallow 17
every 17
bite 17
three 17
times 17
before 17
it 17
really 17
goes 17
down 17
gale 17
whos 17
not 17
usually 17
much 17
of 17
a 17
talker 17
during 17
meals 17
makes 17
an 17
effort 17
to 17
keep 17
the 17
conversation 17
going 17
asking 17
about 17
the 17
makeover 17
i 17
know 17
its 17
his 17
attempt 17
at 17
smoothing 17
things 17
over 17
we 17
argued 17
last 17
night 17
after 17
he 17
suggested 17
id 17
left 17
coin 17
no 17
choice 17
but 17
to 17
counter 17
my 17
demand 17
for 17
the 17
victors 17
safety 17
with 17
one 17
of 17
her 17
own 17
katniss 17
shes 17
running 17
this 17
district 17
she 17
cant 17
do 17
it 17
if 17
it 17
seems 17
like 17
shes 17
caving 17
in 17
to 17
your 17
will 17
you 17
mean 17
she 17
cant 17
stand 17
any 17
dissent 17
even 17
if 17
its 17
fair 17
id 17
countered 17
i 17
mean 17
you 17
put 17
her 17
in 17
a 17
bad 17
position 17
making 17
her 17
give 17
peeta 17
and 17
the 17
others 17
immunity 17
when 17
we 17
dont 17
even 17
know 17
what 17
sort 17
of 17
damage 17
they 17
might 17
cause 17
gale 17
had 17
said 17
so 17
i 17
shouldve 17
just 17
gone 17
with 17
the 17
program 17
and 17
let 17
the 17
other 17
tributes 17
take 17
their 17
chances 17
not 17
that 17
it 17
matters 17
because 17
thats 17
what 17
were 17
all 17
doing 17
anyway 17
that 17
was 17
when 17
id 17
slammed 17
the 17
door 17
in 17
his 17
face 17
i 17
hadnt 17
sat 17
with 17
him 17
at 17
breakfast 17
and 17
when 17
plutarch 17
had 17
sent 17
him 17
down 17
to 17
training 17
this 17
morning 17
id 17
let 17
him 17
go 17
without 17
a 17
word 17
i 17
know 17
he 17
only 17
spoke 17
out 17
of 17
concern 17
for 17
me 17
but 17
i 17
really 17
need 17
him 17
to 17
be 17
on 17
my 17
side 17
not 17
coins 17
how 17
can 17
he 17
not 17
know 17
that 17
after 17
lunch 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
are 17
scheduled 17
to 17
go 17
down 17
to 17
special 17
defense 17
to 17
meet 17
beetee 17
as 17
we 17
ride 17
the 17
elevator 17
gale 17
finally 17
says 17
youre 17
still 17
angry 17
and 17
youre 17
still 17
not 17
sorry 17
i 17
reply 17
i 17
still 17
stand 17
by 17
what 17
i 17
said 17
do 17
you 17
want 17
me 17
to 17
lie 17
about 17
it 17
he 17
asks 17
no 17
i 17
want 17
you 17
to 17
rethink 17
it 17
and 17
come 17
up 17
with 17
the 17
right 17
opinion 17
i 17
tell 17
him 17
but 17
this 17
just 17
makes 17
him 17
laugh 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
let 17
it 17
go 17
theres 17
no 17
point 17
in 17
trying 17
to 17
dictate 17
what 17
gale 17
thinks 17
which 17
if 17
im 17
honest 17
is 17
one 17
reason 17
i 17
trust 17
him 17
the 17
special 17
defense 17
level 17
is 17
situated 17
almost 17
as 17
far 17
down 17
as 17
the 17
dungeons 17
where 17
we 17
found 17
the 17
prep 17
team 17
its 17
a 17
beehive 17
of 17
rooms 17
full 17
of 17
computers 17
labs 17
research 17
equipment 17
and 17
testing 17
ranges 17
when 17
we 17
ask 17
for 17
beetee 17
were 17
directed 17
through 17
the 17
maze 17
until 17
we 17
reach 17
an 17
enormous 17
plateglass 17
window 17
inside 17
is 17
the 17
first 17
beautiful 17
thing 17
ive 17
seen 17
in 17
the 17
district 17
compound 17
a 17
replication 17
of 17
a 17
meadow 17
filled 17
with 17
real 17
trees 17
and 17
flowering 17
plants 17
and 17
alive 17
with 17
hummingbirds 17
beetee 17
sits 17
motionless 17
in 17
a 17
wheelchair 17
at 17
the 17
center 17
of 17
the 17
meadow 17
watching 17
a 17
springgreen 17
bird 17
hover 17
in 17
midair 17
as 17
it 17
sips 17
nectar 17
from 17
a 17
large 17
orange 17
blossom 17
his 17
eyes 17
follow 17
the 17
bird 17
as 17
it 17
darts 17
away 17
and 17
he 17
catches 17
sight 17
of 17
us 17
he 17
gives 17
a 17
friendly 17
wave 17
for 17
us 17
to 17
join 17
him 17
inside 17
the 17
airs 17
cool 17
and 17
breathable 17
not 17
humid 17
and 17
muggy 17
as 17
id 17
expected 17
from 17
all 17
sides 17
comes 17
the 17
whir 17
of 17
tiny 17
wings 17
which 17
i 17
used 17
to 17
confuse 17
with 17
the 17
sound 17
of 17
insects 17
in 17
our 17
woods 17
at 17
home 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
wonder 17
what 17
sort 17
of 17
fluke 17
allowed 17
such 17
a 17
pleasing 17
place 17
to 17
be 17
built 17
here 17
beetee 17
still 17
has 17
the 17
pallor 17
of 17
someone 17
in 17
convalescence 17
but 17
behind 17
those 17
illfitting 17
glasses 17
his 17
eyes 17
are 17
alight 17
with 17
excitement 17
arent 17
they 17
magnificent 17
thirteen 17
has 17
been 17
studying 17
their 17
aerodynamics 17
here 17
for 17
years 17
forward 17
and 17
backward 17
flight 17
and 17
speeds 17
up 17
to 17
sixty 17
miles 17
per 17
hour 17
if 17
only 17
i 17
could 17
build 17
you 17
wings 17
like 17
these 17
katniss 17
doubt 17
i 17
could 17
manage 17
them 17
beetee 17
i 17
laugh 17
here 17
one 17
second 17
gone 17
the 17
next 17
can 17
you 17
bring 17
a 17
hummingbird 17
down 17
with 17
an 17
arrow 17
he 17
asks 17
ive 17
never 17
tried 17
not 17
much 17
meat 17
on 17
them 17
i 17
answer 17
no 17
and 17
youre 17
not 17
one 17
to 17
kill 17
for 17
sport 17
he 17
says 17
i 17
bet 17
theyd 17
be 17
hard 17
to 17
shoot 17
though 17
you 17
could 17
snare 17
them 17
maybe 17
gale 17
says 17
his 17
face 17
takes 17
on 17
that 17
distant 17
look 17
it 17
wears 17
when 17
hes 17
working 17
something 17
out 17
take 17
a 17
net 17
with 17
a 17
very 17
fine 17
mesh 17
enclose 17
an 17
area 17
and 17
leave 17
a 17
mouth 17
of 17
a 17
couple 17
square 17
feet 17
bait 17
the 17
inside 17
with 17
nectar 17
flowers 17
while 17
theyre 17
feeding 17
snap 17
the 17
mouth 17
shut 17
theyd 17
fly 17
away 17
from 17
the 17
noise 17
but 17
only 17
encounter 17
the 17
far 17
side 17
of 17
the 17
net 17
would 17
that 17
work 17
asks 17
beetee 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
just 17
an 17
idea 17
says 17
gale 17
they 17
might 17
outsmart 17
it 17
they 17
might 17
but 17
youre 17
playing 17
on 17
their 17
natural 17
instincts 17
to 17
flee 17
danger 17
thinking 17
like 17
your 17
preythats 17
where 17
you 17
find 17
their 17
vulnerabilities 17
says 17
beetee 17
i 17
remember 17
something 17
i 17
dont 17
like 17
to 17
think 17
about 17
in 17
preparation 17
for 17
the 17
quell 17
i 17
saw 17
a 17
tape 17
where 17
beetee 17
who 17
was 17
still 17
a 17
boy 17
connected 17
two 17
wires 17
that 17
electrocuted 17
a 17
pack 17
of 17
kids 17
who 17
were 17
hunting 17
him 17
the 17
convulsing 17
bodies 17
the 17
grotesque 17
expressions 17
beetee 17
in 17
the 17
moments 17
that 17
led 17
up 17
to 17
his 17
victory 17
in 17
those 17
longago 17
hunger 17
games 17
watched 17

through 17
the 17
last 17
few 17

ive 17
been 17
working 17
on 17
a 17
new 17
trident 17
for 17
him 17
though 17
will 17
you 17
something 17
to 17
distract 17
him 17
a 17
little 17
distraction 17
seems 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
last 17
thing 17
finnick 17
needs 17
but 17
i 17
promise 17
to 17
pass 17
on 17
the 17
message 17
four 17
soldiers 17
guard 17
the 17
entrance 17
to 17
the 17
hall 17
marked 17
special 17
weaponry 17
checking 17
the 17
schedules 17
printed 17
on 17
our 17
forearms 17
is 17
just 17
a 17
preliminary 17
step 17
we 17
also 17
have 17
fingerprint 17
retinal 17
and 17
dna 17
scans 17
and 17
have 17
to 17
step 17
through 17
special 17
metal 17
detectors 17
beetee 17
has 17
to 17
leave 17
his 17
wheelchair 17
outside 17
although 17
they 17
provide 17
him 17
with 17
another 17
once 17
were 17
through 17
security 17
i 17
find 17
the 17
whole 17
thing 17
bizarre 17
because 17
i 17
cant 17
imagine 17
anyone 17
raised 17
in 17
district 17
being 17
a 17
threat 17
the 17
government 17
would 17
have 17
to 17
guard 17
against 17
have 17
these 17
precautions 17
been 17
put 17
in 17
place 17
because 17
of 17
the 17
recent 17
influx 17
of 17
immigrants 17
at 17
the 17
door 17
of 17
the 17
armory 17
we 17
encounter 17
a 17
second 17
round 17
of 17
identification 17
checksas 17
if 17
my 17
dna 17
might 17
have 17
changed 17
in 17
the 17
time 17
it 17
took 17
to 17
walk 17
twenty 17
yards 17
down 17
the 17
hallwayand 17
are 17
finally 17
allowed 17
to 17
enter 17
the 17
weapons 17
collection 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
admit 17
the 17
arsenal 17
takes 17
my 17
breath 17
away 17
row 17
upon 17
row 17
of 17
firearms 17
launchers 17
explosives 17
armored 17
vehicles 17
of 17
course 17
the 17
airborne 17
division 17
is 17
housed 17
separately 17
beetee 17
tells 17
us 17
of 17
course 17
i 17
say 17
as 17
if 17
this 17
would 17
be 17
selfevident 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
where 17
a 17
simple 17
bow 17
and 17
arrow 17
could 17
possibly 17
find 17
a 17
place 17
in 17
all 17
this 17
hightech 17
equipment 17
but 17
then 17
we 17
come 17
upon 17
a 17
wall 17
of 17
deadly 17
archery 17
weapons 17
ive 17
played 17
with 17
a 17
lot 17
of 17
the 17
capitols 17
weapons 17
in 17
training 17
but 17
none 17
designed 17
for 17
military 17
combat 17
i 17
focus 17
my 17
attention 17
on 17
a 17
lethallooking 17
bow 17
so 17
loaded 17
down 17
with 17
scopes 17
and 17
gadgetry 17
im 17
certain 17
i 17
cant 17
even 17
lift 17
it 17
let 17
alone 17
shoot 17
it 17
gale 17
maybe 17
youd 17
like 17
to 17
try 17
out 17
a 17
few 17
of 17
these 17
says 17
beetee 17
seriously 17
gale 17
asks 17
youll 17
be 17
issued 17
a 17
gun 17
eventually 17
for 17
battle 17
of 17
course 17
but 17
if 17
you 17
appear 17
as 17
part 17
of 17
katnisss 17
team 17
in 17
the 17
propos 17
one 17
of 17
these 17
would 17
look 17
a 17
little 17
showier 17
i 17
thought 17
you 17
might 17
like 17
to 17
find 17
one 17
that 17
suits 17
you 17
says 17
beetee 17
yeah 17
i 17
would 17
gales 17
hands 17
close 17
around 17
the 17
very 17
bow 17
that 17
caught 17
my 17
attention 17
a 17
moment 17
ago 17
and 17
he 17
hefts 17
it 17
onto 17
his 17
shoulder 17
he 17
points 17
it 17
around 17
the 17
room 17
peering 17
through 17
the 17
scope 17
that 17
doesnt 17
seem 17
very 17
fair 17
to 17
the 17
deer 17
i 17
say 17
wouldnt 17
be 17
using 17
it 17
on 17
deer 17
would 17
i 17
he 17
answers 17
ill 17
be 17
right 17
back 17
says 17
beetee 17
he 17
presses 17
a 17
code 17
into 17
a 17
panel 17
and 17
a 17
small 17
doorway 17
opens 17
i 17
watch 17
until 17
hes 17
disappeared 17
and 17
the 17
doors 17
shut 17
so 17
itd 17
be 17
easy 17
for 17
you 17
using 17
that 17
on 17
people 17
i 17
ask 17

say 17
that 17
gale 17
drops 17
the 17
bow 17
to 17
his 17
side 17
but 17
if 17

a 17
weapon 17

the 17
aftermath 17
of 17
killing 17
a 17
person 17
about 17
how 17
they 17
never 17
leave 17
you 17
beetee 17
wheels 17
back 17
in 17
with 17
a 17
tall 17
black 17
rectangular 17
case 17
awkwardly 17
positioned 17
between 17
his 17
footrest 17
and 17
his 17
shoulder 17
he 17
comes 17
to 17
a 17
halt 17
and 17
tilts 17
it 17
toward 17
me 17
for 17
you 17
i 17
set 17
the 17
case 17
flat 17
on 17
the 17
floor 17
and 17
undo 17
the 17
latches 17
along 17
one 17
side 17
the 17
top 17
opens 17
on 17
silent 17
hinges 17
inside 17
the 17
case 17
on 17
a 17
bed 17
of 17
crushed 17
maroon 17
velvet 17
lies 17
a 17
stunning 17
black 17
bow 17
oh 17
i 17
whisper 17
in 17
admiration 17
i 17
lift 17
it 17
carefully 17
into 17
the 17
air 17
to 17
admire 17
the 17
exquisite 17
balance 17
the 17
elegant 17
design 17
and 17
the 17
curve 17
of 17
the 17
limbs 17
that 17
somehow 17
suggests 17
the 17
wings 17
of 17
a 17
bird 17
extended 17
in 17
flight 17
theres 17
something 17
else 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
hold 17
very 17
still 17
to 17
make 17
sure 17
im 17
not 17
imagining 17
it 17
no 17
the 17
bow 17
is 17
alive 17
in 17
my 17
hands 17
i 17
press 17
it 17
against 17
my 17
cheek 17
and 17
feel 17
the 17
slight 17
hum 17
travel 17
through 17
the 17
bones 17
of 17
my 17
face 17
whats 17
it 17
doing 17
i 17
ask 17
saying 17
hello 17
explains 17
beetee 17
with 17
a 17
grin 17
it 17
heard 17
your 17
voice 17
it 17
recognizes 17
my 17
voice 17
i 17
ask 17
only 17
your 17
voice 17
he 17
tells 17
me 17
you 17
see 17
they 17
wanted 17
me 17
to 17
design 17
a 17
bow 17
based 17
purely 17
on 17
looks 17
as 17
part 17
of 17
your 17
costume 17
you 17
know 17
but 17
i 17
kept 17
thinking 17
what 17
a 17
waste 17
i 17
mean 17
what 17
if 17
you 17
do 17
need 17
it 17
sometime 17
as 17
more 17
than 17
a 17
fashion 17
accessory 17
so 17
i 17
left 17
the 17
outside 17
simple 17
and 17
left 17
the 17
inside 17
to 17
my 17
imagination 17
best 17
explained 17
in 17
practice 17
though 17
want 17
to 17
try 17
those 17
out 17
we 17
do 17
a 17
target 17
range 17
has 17
already 17
been 17
prepared 17
for 17
us 17
the 17
arrows 17
that 17
beetee 17
designed 17
are 17
no 17
less 17
remarkable 17
than 17
the 17
bow 17
between 17
the 17
two 17
i 17
can 17
shoot 17
with 17
accuracy 17
over 17
one 17
hundred 17
yards 17
the 17
variety 17
of 17
arrows 17
razor 17
sharp 17
incendiary 17
explosiveturn 17
the 17
bow 17
into 17
a 17
multipurpose 17
weapon 17
each 17
one 17
is 17
recognizable 17
by 17
a 17
distinctive 17
colored 17
shaft 17
i 17
have 17
the 17
option 17
of 17
voice 17
override 17
at 17
any 17
time 17
but 17
have 17
no 17
idea 17
why 17
i 17
would 17
use 17
it 17
to 17
deactivate 17
the 17
bows 17
special 17
properties 17
i 17
need 17
only 17
tell 17
it 17
good 17
night 17
then 17
it 17
goes 17
to 17
sleep 17
until 17
the 17
sound 17
of 17
my 17
voice 17
wakes 17
it 17
again 17
im 17
in 17
good 17
spirits 17
by 17
the 17
time 17
i 17
get 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
prep 17
team 17
leaving 17
beetee 17
and 17
gale 17
behind 17
i 17
sit 17
patiently 17
through 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
paint 17
job 17
and 17
don 17
my 17
costume 17
which 17
now 17
includes 17
a 17
bloody 17
bandage 17
over 17
the 17
scar 17
on 17
my 17
arm 17
to 17
indicate 17
ive 17
been 17
in 17
recent 17
combat 17
venia 17
affixes 17
my 17
mockingjay 17
pin 17
over 17
my 17
heart 17
i 17
take 17
up 17
my 17
bow 17
and 17
the 17
sheath 17
of 17
normal 17
arrows 17
that 17
beetee 17
made 17
knowing 17
they 17
would 17
never 17
let 17
me 17
walk 17
around 17
with 17
the 17
loaded 17
ones 17
then 17
were 17
out 17
on 17
the 17
soundstage 17
where 17
i 17
seem 17
to 17
stand 17
for 17
hours 17
while 17
they 17
adjust 17
makeup 17
and 17
lighting 17
and 17
smoke 17
levels 17
eventually 17
the 17
commands 17
coming 17
via 17
intercom 17
from 17
the 17
invisible 17
people 17
in 17
the 17
mysterious 17
glassedin 17
booth 17
become 17
fewer 17
and 17
fewer 17
fulvia 17
and 17
plutarch 17
spend 17
more 17
time 17
studying 17
and 17
less 17
time 17
adjusting 17
me 17
finally 17
theres 17
quiet 17
on 17
the 17
set 17
for 17
a 17
full 17
five 17
minutes 17
i 17
am 17
simply 17
considered 17
then 17
plutarch 17
says 17
i 17
think 17
that 17
does 17
it 17
im 17
beckoned 17
over 17
to 17
a 17
monitor 17
they 17
play 17
back 17
the 17
last 17
few 17
minutes 17
of 17
taping 17
and 17
i 17
watch 17
the 17
woman 17
on 17
the 17
screen 17
her 17
body 17
seems 17
larger 17
in 17
stature 17
more 17
imposing 17
than 17
mine 17
her 17
face 17
smudged 17
but 17
sexy 17
her 17
brows 17
black 17
and 17
drawn 17
in 17
an 17
angle 17
of 17
defiance 17
wisps 17
of 17
smokesuggesting 17
she 17
has 17
either 17
just 17
been 17
extinguished 17
or 17
is 17
about 17
to 17
burst 17
into 17
flamesrise 17
from 17
her 17
clothes 17
i 17
do 17
not 17
know 17
who 17
this 17
person 17
is 17
finnick 17
whos 17
been 17
wandering 17
around 17
the 17
set 17
for 17
a 17
few 17
hours 17
comes 17
up 17
behind 17
me 17
and 17
says 17
with 17
a 17
hint 17
of 17
his 17
old 17
humor 17
theyll 17
either 17
want 17
to 17
kill 17
you 17
kiss 17
you 17
or 17
be 17
you 17
everyones 17
so 17
excited 17
so 17
pleased 17
with 17
their 17
work 17
its 17
nearly 17
time 17
to 17
break 17
for 17
dinner 17
but 17
they 17
insist 17
we 17
continue 17
tomorrow 17
well 17
focus 17
on 17
speeches 17
and 17
interviews 17
and 17
have 17
me 17
pretend 17
to 17
be 17
in 17
rebel 17
battles 17
today 17
they 17
want 17
just 17
one 17
slogan 17
just 17
one 17
line 17
that 17
they 17
can 17
work 17
into 17
a 17
short 17
propo 17
to 17
show 17
to 17
coin 17
people 17
of 17
panem 17
we 17
fight 17
we 17
dare 17
we 17
end 17
our 17
hunger 17
for 17
justice 17
thats 17
the 17
line 17
i 17
can 17
tell 17
by 17
the 17
way 17
they 17
present 17
it 17
that 17
theyve 17
spent 17
months 17
maybe 17
years 17
working 17
it 17
out 17
and 17
are 17
really 17
proud 17
of 17
it 17
it 17
seems 17
like 17
a 17
mouthful 17
to 17
me 17
though 17
and 17
stiff 17
i 17
cant 17
imagine 17
actually 17
saying 17
it 17
in 17
real 17
lifeunless 17
i 17
was 17
using 17
a 17
capitol 17
accent 17
and 17
making 17
fun 17
of 17
it 17
like 17
when 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
used 17
to 17
imitate 17
effie 17
trinkets 17
may 17
the 17
odds 17
be 17
ever 17
in 17
your 17
favor 17
but 17
fulvias 17
right 17
in 17
my 17
face 17
describing 17
a 17
battle 17
ive 17
just 17
been 17
in 17
and 17
how 17
my 17
comradesinarms 17
are 17
all 17
lying 17
dead 17
around 17
me 17
and 17
how 17
to 17
rally 17
the 17
living 17
i 17
must 17
turn 17
to 17
the 17
camera 17
and 17
shout 17
out 17
the 17
line 17
im 17
hustled 17
back 17
to 17
my 17
place 17
and 17
the 17
smoke 17
machine 17
kicks 17
in 17
someone 17
calls 17
for 17
quiet 17
the 17
cameras 17
start 17
rolling 17
and 17
i 17
hear 17
action 17
so 17
i 17
hold 17
my 17
bow 17
over 17
my 17
head 17
and 17
yell 17
with 17
all 17
the 17
anger 17
i 17
can 17
muster 17
people 17
of 17
panem 17
we 17
fight 17
we 17
dare 17
we 17
end 17
our 17
hunger 17
for 17
justice 17
theres 17
dead 17
silence 17
on 17
the 17
set 17
it 17
goes 17
on 17
and 17
on 17
finally 17
the 17
intercom 17
crackles 17
and 17
haymitchs 17
acerbic 17
laugh 17
fills 17
the 17
studio 17
he 17
contains 17
himself 17
just 17
long 17
enough 17
to 17
say 17
and 17
that 17
my 17
friends 17
is 17
how 17
a 17
revolution 17
dies 17
the 17
shock 17
of 17
hearing 17
haymitchs 17
voice 17
yesterday 17
of 17
learning 17
that 17
he 17
was 17
not 17
only 17
functional 17
but 17
had 17
some 17
measure 17
of 17
control 17
over 17
my 17
life 17
again 17
enraged 17
me 17
i 17
left 17
the 17
studio 17
directly 17
and 17
refused 17
to 17
acknowledge 17
his 17
comments 17
from 17
the 17
booth 17
today 17
even 17
so 17
i 17
knew 17
immediately 17
he 17
was 17
right 17
about 17
my 17
performance 17
it 17
took 17
the 17
whole 17
of 17
this 17
morning 17
for 17
him 17
to 17
convince 17
the 17
others 17
of 17
my 17
limitations 17
that 17
i 17
cant 17
pull 17
it 17
off 17
i 17
cant 17
stand 17
in 17
a 17
television 17
studio 17
wearing 17
a 17
costume 17
and 17
makeup 17
in 17
a 17
cloud 17
of 17
fake 17
smoke 17
and 17
rally 17
the 17
districts 17
to 17
victory 17
its 17
amazing 17
really 17
how 17
long 17
i 17
have 17
survived 17
the 17
cameras 17
the 17
credit 17
for 17
that 17
of 17
course 17
goes 17
to 17
peeta 17
alone 17
i 17
cant 17
be 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
we 17
gather 17
around 17
the 17
huge 17
table 17
in 17
command 17
coin 17
and 17
her 17
people 17
plutarch 17
fulvia 17
and 17
my 17
prep 17
team 17
a 17
group 17
from 17
that 17
includes 17
haymitch 17
and 17
gale 17
but 17
also 17
a 17
few 17
others 17
i 17
cant 17
explain 17
like 17
leevy 17
and 17
greasy 17
sae 17
at 17
the 17
last 17
minute 17
finnick 17
wheels 17
beetee 17
in 17
accompanied 17
by 17
dalton 17
the 17
cattle 17
expert 17
from 17
i 17
suppose 17
that 17
coin 17
has 17
assembled 17
this 17
strange 17
assortment 17
of 17
people 17
as 17
witnesses 17
to 17
my 17
failure 17
however 17
its 17
haymitch 17
who 17
welcomes 17
everyone 17
and 17
by 17
his 17
words 17
i 17
understand 17
that 17
they 17
have 17
come 17
at 17
his 17
personal 17
invitation 17
this 17
is 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
weve 17
been 17
in 17
a 17
room 17
together 17
since 17
i 17
clawed 17
him 17
i 17
avoid 17
looking 17
at 17
him 17
directly 17
but 17
i 17
catch 17
a 17
glimpse 17
of 17
his 17
reflection 17
in 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
shiny 17
control 17
consoles 17
along 17
the 17
wall 17
he 17
looks 17
slightly 17
yellow 17
and 17
has 17
lost 17
a 17
lot 17
of 17
weight 17
giving 17
him 17
a 17
shrunken 17
appearance 17
for 17
a 17
second 17
im 17
afraid 17
hes 17
dying 17
i 17
have 17
to 17
remind 17
myself 17
that 17
i 17
dont 17
care 17
the 17
first 17
thing 17
haymitch 17
does 17
is 17
to 17
show 17
the 17
footage 17
weve 17
just 17
shot 17
i 17
seem 17
to 17
have 17
reached 17
some 17
new 17
low 17
under 17
plutarch 17
and 17
fulvias 17
guidance 17
both 17
my 17
voice 17
and 17
body 17
have 17
a 17
jerky 17
disjointed 17
quality 17
like 17
a 17
puppet 17
being 17
manipulated 17
by 17
unseen 17
forces 17
all 17
right 17
haymitch 17
says 17
when 17
its 17
over 17
would 17
anyone 17
like 17
to 17
argue 17
that 17
this 17
is 17
of 17
use 17
to 17
us 17
in 17
winning 17
the 17
war 17
no 17
one 17
does 17
that 17
saves 17
time 17
so 17
lets 17
all 17
be 17
quiet 17
for 17
a 17
minute 17
i 17
want 17
everyone 17
to 17
think 17
of 17
one 17
incident 17
where 17
katniss 17
everdeen 17
genuinely 17
moved 17
you 17
not 17
where 17
you 17
were 17
jealous 17
of 17
her 17
hairstyle 17
or 17
her 17
dress 17
went 17
up 17
in 17
flames 17
or 17
she 17
made 17
a 17
halfway 17
decent 17
shot 17
with 17
an 17
arrow 17
not 17
where 17
peeta 17
was 17
making 17
you 17
like 17
her 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
hear 17
one 17
moment 17
where 17
she 17
made 17
you 17
feel 17
something 17
real 17
quiet 17
stretches 17
out 17
and 17
im 17
beginning 17
to 17
think 17
it 17
will 17
never 17
end 17
when 17
leevy 17
speaks 17
up 17
when 17
she 17
volunteered 17
to 17
take 17
prims 17
place 17
at 17
the 17
reaping 17
because 17
im 17
sure 17
she 17
thought 17
she 17
was 17
going 17
to 17
die 17
good 17
excellent 17
example 17
says 17
haymitch 17
he 17
takes 17
a 17
purple 17
marker 17
and 17
writes 17
on 17
a 17
notepad 17
volunteered 17
for 17
sister 17
at 17
reaping 17
haymitch 17
looks 17
around 17
the 17
table 17
somebody 17
else 17
im 17
surprised 17
that 17
the 17
next 17
speaker 17
is 17
boggs 17
who 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
as 17
a 17
muscular 17
robot 17
that 17
does 17
coins 17
bidding 17
when 17
she 17
sang 17
the 17
song 17
while 17
the 17
little 17
girl 17
died 17
somewhere 17
in 17
my 17
head 17
an 17
image 17
surfaces 17
of 17
boggs 17
with 17
a 17
young 17
boy 17
perched 17
up 17
on 17
his 17
hip 17
in 17
the 17
dining 17
hall 17
i 17
think 17
maybe 17
hes 17
not 17
a 17
robot 17
after 17
all 17
who 17
didnt 17
get 17
choked 17
up 17
at 17
that 17
right 17
says 17
haymitch 17
writing 17
it 17
down 17
i 17
cried 17
when 17
she 17
drugged 17
peeta 17
so 17
she 17
could 17
go 17
get 17
him 17
medicine 17
and 17
when 17
she 17
kissed 17
him 17
goodbye 17
blurts 17
out 17
octavia 17
then 17
she 17
covers 17
her 17
mouth 17
like 17
shes 17
sure 17
this 17
was 17
a 17
bad 17
mistake 17
but 17
haymitch 17
only 17
nods 17
oh 17
yeah 17
drugs 17
peeta 17
to 17
save 17
his 17
life 17
very 17
nice 17
the 17
moments 17
begin 17
to 17
come 17
thick 17
and 17
fast 17
and 17
in 17
no 17
particular 17
order 17
when 17
i 17
took 17
rue 17
on 17
as 17
an 17
ally 17
extended 17
my 17
hand 17
to 17
chaff 17
on 17
interview 17
night 17
tried 17
to 17
carry 17
mags 17
and 17
again 17
and 17
again 17
when 17
i 17
held 17
out 17
those 17
berries 17
that 17
meant 17
different 17
things 17
to 17
different 17
people 17
love 17
for 17
peeta 17
refusal 17
to 17
give 17
in 17
under 17
impossible 17
odds 17
defiance 17
of 17
the 17
capitols 17
inhumanity 17
haymitch 17
holds 17
up 17
the 17
notepad 17
so 17
the 17
question 17
is 17
what 17
do 17
all 17
of 17
these 17
have 17
in 17
common 17
they 17
were 17
katnisss 17
says 17
gale 17
quietly 17
no 17
one 17
told 17
her 17
what 17
to 17
do 17
or 17
say 17
unscripted 17
yes 17
says 17
beetee 17
he 17
reaches 17
over 17
and 17
pats 17
my 17
hand 17
so 17
we 17
should 17
just 17
leave 17
you 17
alone 17
right 17
people 17
laugh 17
i 17
even 17
smile 17
a 17
little 17
well 17
thats 17
all 17
very 17
nice 17
but 17
not 17
very 17
helpful 17
says 17
fulvia 17
peevishly 17
unfortunately 17
her 17
opportunities 17
for 17
being 17
wonderful 17
are 17
rather 17
limited 17
here 17
in 17
thirteen 17
so 17
unless 17
youre 17
suggesting 17
we 17
toss 17
her 17
into 17
the 17
middle 17
of 17
combat 17
thats 17
exactly 17
what 17
im 17
suggesting 17
says 17
haymitch 17
put 17
her 17
out 17
in 17
the 17
field 17
and 17
just 17
keep 17
the 17
cameras 17
rolling 17
but 17
people 17
think 17
shes 17
pregnant 17
gale 17
points 17
out 17
well 17
spread 17
the 17
word 17
that 17
she 17
lost 17
the 17
baby 17
from 17
the 17
electrical 17
shock 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
plutarch 17
replies 17
very 17
sad 17
very 17
unfortunate 17
the 17
idea 17
of 17
sending 17
me 17
into 17
combat 17
is 17
controversial 17
but 17
haymitch 17
has 17
a 17
pretty 17
tight 17
case 17
if 17
i 17
perform 17
well 17
only 17
in 17
reallife 17
circumstances 17
then 17
into 17
them 17
i 17
should 17
go 17
every 17
time 17
we 17
coach 17
her 17
or 17
give 17
her 17
lines 17
the 17
best 17
we 17
can 17
hope 17
for 17
is 17
okay 17
it 17
has 17
to 17
come 17
from 17
her 17
thats 17
what 17
people 17
are 17
responding 17
to 17
even 17
if 17
were 17
careful 17
we 17
cant 17
guarantee 17
her 17
safety 17
says 17
boggs 17
shell 17
be 17
a 17
target 17
for 17
every 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
go 17

break 17
in 17
im 17

help 17
to 17
the 17
rebels 17
here 17
and 17
if 17
youre 17
killed 17
asks 17
coin 17
make 17
sure 17
you 17
get 17
some 17
footage 17

can 17
use 17
that 17
anyway 17
i 17
answer 17
fine 17
says 17
coin 17
but 17
lets 17
take 17
it 17
one 17
step 17
at 17
a 17
time 17
find 17
the 17
least 17
dangerous 17
situation 17
that 17
can 17
evoke 17
some 17
spontaneity 17
in 17
you 17
she 17
walks 17
around 17
command 17
studying 17
the 17
illuminated 17
district 17
maps 17
that 17
show 17
the 17
ongoing 17
troop 17
positions 17

eight 17
this 17
afternoon 17
there 17
was 17
heavy 17
bombing 17
this 17
morning 17
but 17
the 17
raid 17
seems 17
to 17
have 17
run 17
its 17
course 17
i 17
want 17
her 17
armed 17
with 17
a 17
squad 17
of 17
bodyguards 17
camera 17
crew 17
on 17
the 17
ground 17
haymitch 17

be 17
airborne 17
and 17
in 17
contact 17
with 17
her 17
lets 17
see 17
what 17
happens 17
there 17
does 17
anyone 17
have 17
any 17
other 17
comments 17
wash 17
her 17
face 17
says 17
dalton 17
everyone 17
turns 17
to 17
him 17
shes 17
still 17
a 17
girl 17
and 17
you 17
made 17
her 17
look 17
thirtyfive 17
feels 17
wrong 17
like 17
something 17
the 17
capitol 17
would 17
do 17
as 17
coin 17
adjourns 17
the 17
meeting 17
haymitch 17
asks 17
her 17
if 17
he 17
can 17
speak 17
to 17
me 17
privately 17
the 17
others 17
leave 17
except 17
for 17
gale 17
who 17
lingers 17
uncertainly 17
by 17
my 17
side 17
what 17
are 17
you 17
worried 17
about 17
haymitch 17
asks 17
him 17
im 17
the 17
one 17
who 17
needs 17
the 17
bodyguard 17
its 17
okay 17
i 17
tell 17
gale 17
and 17
he 17
goes 17
then 17
theres 17
just 17
the 17
hum 17
of 17
the 17
instruments 17
the 17
purr 17
of 17
the 17
ventilation 17
system 17
haymitch 17
takes 17
the 17
seat 17
across 17
from 17
me 17
were 17
going 17
to 17
have 17
to 17
work 17
together 17
again 17
so 17
go 17
ahead 17
just 17
say 17
it 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
the 17
snarling 17
cruel 17
exchange 17
back 17
on 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
the 17
bitterness 17
that 17
followed 17
but 17
all 17
i 17
say 17
is 17
i 17
cant 17
believe 17
you 17
didnt 17
rescue 17
peeta 17
i 17
know 17
he 17
replies 17
theres 17
a 17
sense 17
of 17
incompleteness 17
and 17
not 17
because 17
he 17
hasnt 17
apologized 17
but 17
because 17
we 17
were 17
a 17
team 17
we 17
had 17
a 17
deal 17
to 17
keep 17
peeta 17
safe 17
a 17
drunken 17
unrealistic 17
deal 17
made 17
in 17
the 17
dark 17
of 17
night 17
but 17
a 17
deal 17
just 17
the 17
same 17
and 17
in 17
my 17
heart 17
of 17
hearts 17
i 17
know 17
we 17
both 17
failed 17
now 17
you 17
say 17
it 17
i 17
tell 17
him 17
i 17
cant 17
believe 17
you 17
let 17
him 17
out 17
of 17
your 17
sight 17
that 17
night 17
says 17
haymitch 17
i 17
nod 17
thats 17
it 17
i 17
play 17
it 17
over 17
and 17
over 17
in 17
my 17
head 17
what 17
i 17
could 17
have 17
done 17
to 17
keep 17
him 17
by 17
my 17
side 17
without 17
breaking 17
the 17
alliance 17
but 17
nothing 17
comes 17
to 17
me 17
you 17
didnt 17
have 17
a 17
choice 17
and 17
even 17
if 17
i 17
couldve 17
made 17
plutarch 17
stay 17
and 17
rescue 17
him 17
that 17
night 17
the 17
whole 17
hovercraft 17
wouldve 17
gone 17
down 17
we 17
barely 17
got 17
out 17
as 17
it 17
was 17
i 17
finally 17
meet 17
haymitchs 17
eyes 17
seam 17
eyes 17
gray 17
and 17
deep 17
and 17
ringed 17
with 17
the 17
circles 17
of 17
sleepless 17
nights 17
hes 17
not 17
dead 17

in 17
the 17
game 17

try 17
to 17
say 17
this 17
with 17
optimism 17
but 17
my 17
voice 17
cracks 17
still 17
in 17
and 17
im 17
still 17
your 17
mentor 17
haymitch 17
points 17
his 17
marker 17
at 17
me 17
when 17
youre 17

i 17
return 17
to 17
the 17
remake 17
room 17
and 17
watch 17
the 17
streaks 17
of 17
makeup 17
disappear 17
down 17
the 17
drain 17
as 17
i 17
scrub 17
my 17
face 17
clean 17
the 17
person 17
in 17
the 17
mirror 17
looks 17
ragged 17
with 17
her 17
uneven 17
skin 17
and 17
tired 17
eyes 17
but 17
she 17
looks 17
like 17
me 17
i 17
rip 17
the 17
armband 17
off 17
revealing 17
the 17
ugly 17
scar 17
from 17
the 17
tracker 17
there 17
that 17
looks 17
like 17
me 17

some 17
interwoven 17
metal 17
that 17
fits 17
close 17
to 17
my 17
head 17
the 17
materials 17
supple 17
like 17
fabric 17
and 17
can 17
be 17
drawn 17
back 17
like 17
a 17
hood 17
in 17
case 17
i 17
dont 17

he 17
straps 17
a 17
sheath 17
divided 17
into 17
three 17
cylinders 17
of 17

just 17
as 17
the 17
elevator 17

in 17
a 17
state 17
of 17
agitation 17

ride 17
in 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
i 17
take 17
in 17
finnickhis 17
bare 17
legs 17
showing 17
between 17
his 17
hospital 17
gown 17
and 17
slippers 17
his 17
tangle 17
of 17
hair 17
the 17
halfknotted 17
rope 17
twisted 17
around 17
his 17
fingers 17
the 17
wild 17
look 17
in 17
his 17
eyesand 17
know 17
any 17
plea 17
on 17
my 17
part 17
will 17
be 17
useless 17
even 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
its 17
a 17
good 17
idea 17
to 17
bring 17
him 17
so 17
i 17
smack 17
my 17
hand 17
on 17
my 17
forehead 17
and 17
say 17
oh 17
i 17
forgot 17
its 17
this 17
stupid 17
concussion 17
i 17
was 17
supposed 17
to 17
tell 17
you 17
to 17
report 17
to 17
beetee 17
in 17
special 17
weaponry 17
hes 17
designed 17
a 17
new 17
trident 17
for 17
you 17
at 17
the 17
word 17
trident 17
its 17
as 17
if 17
the 17
old 17
finnick 17
surfaces 17
really 17
whats 17
it 17
do 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
but 17
if 17
its 17
anything 17
like 17
my 17
bow 17
and 17
arrows 17
youre 17
going 17
to 17
love 17
it 17
i 17
say 17
youll 17
need 17
to 17
train 17
with 17
it 17
though 17
right 17
of 17
course 17
i 17
guess 17
i 17
better 17
get 17
down 17
there 17
he 17
says 17
finnick 17
i 17
say 17
maybe 17
some 17
pants 17
he 17
looks 17
down 17
at 17
his 17
legs 17
as 17
if 17
noticing 17
his 17
outfit 17
for 17
the 17
first 17
time 17
then 17
he 17
whips 17
off 17
his 17
hospital 17
gown 17
leaving 17
him 17
in 17
just 17
his 17
underwear 17
why 17
do 17
you 17
find 17
thishe 17
strikes 17
a 17
ridiculously 17
provocative 17
posedistracting 17
i 17
cant 17
help 17
laughing 17
because 17
its 17
funny 17
and 17
its 17
extra 17
funny 17
because 17
it 17
makes 17
boggs 17
look 17
so 17
uncomfortable 17
and 17
im 17
happy 17
because 17
finnick 17
actually 17
sounds 17
like 17
the 17
guy 17
i 17
met 17
at 17
the 17
quarter 17
quell 17
im 17
only 17
human 17
odair 17
i 17
get 17
in 17
before 17
the 17
elevator 17
doors 17
close 17
sorry 17
i 17
say 17
to 17
boggs 17
dont 17
be 17
i 17
thought 17
youhandled 17
that 17
well 17
he 17
says 17
better 17
than 17
my 17
having 17
to 17
arrest 17
him 17
anyway 17
yeah 17
i 17
say 17
i 17
sneak 17
a 17
sidelong 17
glance 17
at 17
him 17
hes 17
probably 17
in 17
his 17
midforties 17
with 17
closecropped 17
gray 17
hair 17
and 17
blue 17
eyes 17
incredible 17
posture 17
hes 17
spoken 17
out 17
twice 17
today 17
in 17
ways 17
that 17
make 17
me 17
think 17
he 17
would 17
rather 17
be 17
friends 17
than 17
enemies 17
maybe 17
i 17
should 17
give 17
him 17
a 17
chance 17
but 17
he 17
just 17
seems 17
so 17
in 17
step 17
with 17

cant 17
take 17
credit 17
for 17
much 17
of 17
it 17
says 17
boggs 17
we 17
basically 17
inherited 17
the 17
place 17
its 17
been 17

oh 17
i 17
let 17
out 17
involuntarily 17
at 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
the 17
fleet 17
row 17
after 17
row 17
of 17
different 17
kinds 17
of 17
hovercraft 17
did 17
you 17
inherit 17
these 17
too 17
some 17
we 17
manufactured 17
some 17
were 17
part 17
of 17
the 17
capitols 17
air 17
force 17
theyve 17
been 17
updated 17
of 17
course 17
says 17
boggs 17
i 17
feel 17
that 17
twinge 17
of 17
hatred 17
against 17
again 17
so 17
you 17
had 17
all 17
this 17
and 17
you 17
left 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
districts 17
defenseless 17
against 17
the 17
capitol 17
its 17
not 17
that 17
simple 17
he 17
shoots 17
back 17
we 17
were 17
in 17
no 17
position 17
to 17
launch 17
a 17
counterattack 17
until 17
recently 17
we 17
could 17
barely 17
stay 17
alive 17
after 17
wed 17
overthrown 17
and 17
executed 17
the 17
capitols 17
people 17
only 17
a 17
handful 17
of 17
us 17
even 17
knew 17
how 17
to 17
pilot 17
we 17
couldve 17
nuked 17
them 17
with 17
missiles 17
yes 17
but 17
theres 17
always 17
the 17
larger 17
question 17
if 17
we 17
engage 17
in 17
that 17
type 17
of 17
war 17
with 17
the 17
capitol 17
would 17
there 17
be 17
any 17
human 17
life 17
left 17
that 17
sounds 17
like 17
what 17
peeta 17
said 17
and 17
you 17
all 17
called 17
him 17
a 17
traitor 17
i 17
counter 17
because 17
he 17
called 17
for 17
a 17
ceasefire 17
says 17
boggs 17
youll 17
notice 17
neither 17
side 17
has 17
launched 17
nuclear 17
weapons 17
were 17
working 17
it 17
out 17
the 17
oldfashioned 17
way 17
over 17
here 17
soldier 17
everdeen 17
he 17
indicates 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
smaller 17
hovercraft 17
i 17
mount 17
the 17
stairs 17
and 17
find 17
it 17
packed 17
with 17
the 17
television 17
crew 17
and 17
equipment 17
everyone 17
else 17
is 17
dressed 17
in 17
s 17
dark 17
gray 17
military 17
jumpsuits 17
even 17
haymitch 17
although 17
he 17
seems 17
unhappy 17
about 17
the 17
snugness 17
of 17
his 17
collar 17
fulvia 17
cardew 17
hustles 17
over 17
and 17
makes 17
a 17
sound 17
of 17
frustration 17
when 17
she 17
sees 17
my 17
clean 17
face 17
all 17
that 17
work 17
down 17
the 17
drain 17
im 17
not 17
blaming 17
you 17
katniss 17
its 17
just 17
that 17
very 17
few 17
people 17
are 17
born 17
with 17
cameraready 17
faces 17
like 17
him 17
she 17
snags 17
gale 17
whos 17
in 17
a 17
conversation 17
with 17
plutarch 17
and 17
spins 17
him 17
toward 17
us 17
isnt 17
he 17
handsome 17
gale 17
does 17
look 17
striking 17
in 17
the 17
uniform 17
i 17
guess 17
but 17
the 17
question 17
just 17
embarrasses 17
us 17
both 17
given 17
our 17
history 17
im 17
trying 17
to 17
think 17
of 17
a 17
witty 17
comeback 17
when 17
boggs 17
says 17
brusquely 17
well 17
dont 17
expect 17
us 17
to 17
be 17
too 17
impressed 17
we 17
just 17
saw 17
finnick 17
odair 17
in 17
his 17
underwear 17
i 17
decide 17
to 17
go 17
ahead 17
and 17
like 17
boggs 17
theres 17
a 17
warning 17
of 17
the 17
upcoming 17
takeoff 17
and 17
i 17
strap 17
myself 17
into 17
a 17
seat 17
next 17
to 17
gale 17
facing 17
off 17
with 17
haymitch 17
and 17
plutarch 17
we 17
glide 17
through 17
a 17
maze 17
of 17
tunnels 17
that 17
opens 17
out 17
onto 17
a 17
platform 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
elevator 17
device 17
lifts 17
the 17
craft 17
slowly 17
up 17
through 17
the 17
levels 17
all 17
at 17
once 17
were 17
outside 17
in 17
a 17
large 17
field 17
surrounded 17
by 17
woods 17
then 17
we 17
rise 17
off 17
the 17
platform 17
and 17
become 17
wrapped 17
in 17
clouds 17
now 17
that 17
the 17
flurry 17
of 17
activity 17
leading 17
up 17
to 17
this 17
mission 17
is 17
over 17
i 17
realize 17
i 17
have 17
no 17
idea 17
what 17
im 17
facing 17
on 17
this 17
trip 17
to 17
district 17
in 17
fact 17
i 17
know 17
very 17
little 17
about 17
the 17
actual 17
state 17
of 17
the 17
war 17
or 17
what 17
it 17
would 17
take 17
to 17
win 17
it 17
or 17
what 17
would 17
happen 17
if 17
we 17
did 17
plutarch 17
tries 17
to 17
lay 17
it 17
out 17
in 17
simple 17
terms 17
for 17
me 17
first 17
of 17
all 17
every 17
district 17
is 17
currently 17
at 17
war 17
with 17
the 17
capitol 17
except 17
which 17
has 17
always 17
had 17
a 17
favored 17
relationship 17
with 17
our 17
enemies 17
despite 17
its 17
participation 17
in 17
the 17
hunger 17
games 17
they 17
get 17
more 17
food 17
and 17
better 17
living 17
conditions 17
after 17
the 17
dark 17
days 17
and 17
the 17
supposed 17
destruction 17
of 17
district 17
became 17
the 17
capitols 17
new 17
center 17
of 17
defense 17
although 17
its 17
publicly 17
presented 17
as 17
the 17
home 17
of 17
the 17
nations 17
stone 17
quarries 17
in 17
the 17
same 17
way 17
that 17
was 17
known 17
for 17
graphite 17
mining 17
district 17
not 17
only 17
manufactures 17
weaponry 17
it 17
trains 17
and 17
even 17
supplies 17
peacekeepers 17
you 17
meansome 17
of 17
the 17
peacekeepers 17
are 17
born 17
in 17
two 17
i 17
ask 17
i 17
thought 17
they 17
all 17
came 17
from 17
the 17
capitol 17
plutarch 17
nods 17
thats 17
what 17
youre 17
supposed 17
to 17
think 17
and 17
some 17
do 17
come 17
from 17
the 17
capitol 17
but 17
its 17
population 17
could 17
never 17
sustain 17
a 17
force 17
that 17
size 17
then 17
theres 17
the 17
problem 17
of 17
recruiting 17
capitolraised 17
citizens 17
for 17
a 17
dull 17
life 17
of 17
deprivation 17
in 17
the 17
districts 17
a 17
twentyyear 17
commitment 17
to 17
the 17
peacekeepers 17
no 17
marriage 17
no 17
children 17
allowed 17
some 17
buy 17
into 17
it 17
for 17
the 17
honor 17
of 17
the 17
thing 17
others 17
take 17
it 17
on 17
as 17
an 17
alternative 17
to 17
punishment 17
for 17
instance 17
join 17
the 17
peacekeepers 17
and 17
your 17
debts 17
are 17
forgiven 17
many 17
people 17
are 17
swamped 17
in 17
debt 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
but 17
not 17
all 17
of 17
them 17
are 17
fit 17
for 17
military 17
duty 17
so 17
district 17
two 17
is 17
where 17
we 17
turn 17
for 17
additional 17
troops 17
its 17
a 17
way 17
for 17
their 17
people 17
to 17
escape 17
poverty 17
and 17
a 17
life 17
in 17
the 17
quarries 17
theyre 17
raised 17
with 17
a 17
warrior 17
mindset 17
youve 17
seen 17
how 17
eager 17
their 17
children 17
are 17
to 17
volunteer 17
to 17
be 17
tributes 17
cato 17
and 17
clove 17
brutus 17
and 17
enobaria 17
ive 17
seen 17
their 17
eagerness 17
and 17
their 17
bloodlust 17
too 17
but 17
all 17
the 17
other 17
districts 17
are 17
on 17
our 17
side 17
i 17
ask 17
yes 17
our 17
goal 17
is 17
to 17
take 17
over 17
the 17
districts 17
one 17
by 17
one 17
ending 17
with 17
district 17
two 17
thus 17
cutting 17
off 17
the 17
capitols 17
supply 17
chain 17
then 17
once 17
its 17
weakened 17
we 17
invade 17
the 17
capitol 17
itself 17
says 17
plutarch 17
that 17
will 17
be 17
a 17
whole 17
other 17
type 17
of 17
challenge 17
but 17
well 17
cross 17
that 17
bridge 17
when 17
we 17
come 17
to 17
it 17
if 17
we 17
win 17
who 17
would 17
be 17
in 17
charge 17
of 17
the 17
government 17
gale 17
asks 17
everyone 17
plutarch 17
tells 17
him 17
were 17
going 17
to 17
form 17
a 17
republic 17
where 17
the 17
people 17
of 17
each 17
district 17
and 17
the 17
capitol 17
can 17
elect 17
their 17
own 17
representatives 17
to 17
be 17
their 17
voice 17
in 17
a 17
centralized 17
government 17
dont 17
look 17
so 17
suspicious 17
its 17
worked 17
before 17
in 17
books 17
haymitch 17
mutters 17
in 17
history 17
books 17
says 17
plutarch 17
and 17
if 17
our 17
ancestors 17
could 17
do 17
it 17
then 17
we 17
can 17
too 17
frankly 17
our 17
ancestors 17
dont 17
seem 17
much 17
to 17
brag 17
about 17
i 17
mean 17
look 17
at 17
the 17
state 17
they 17
left 17
us 17
in 17
with 17
the 17
wars 17
and 17
the 17
broken 17
planet 17
clearly 17
they 17
didnt 17
care 17
about 17
what 17
would 17
happen 17
to 17
the 17
people 17
who 17
came 17
after 17
them 17
but 17
this 17
republic 17
idea 17
sounds 17
like 17
an 17
improvement 17
over 17
our 17
current 17
government 17
and 17
if 17
we 17
lose 17
i 17
ask 17
if 17
we 17
lose 17
plutarch 17
looks 17
out 17
at 17
the 17
clouds 17
and 17
an 17
ironic 17
smile 17
twists 17
his 17
lips 17
then 17
i 17
would 17
expect 17
next 17
years 17
hunger 17
games 17
to 17
be 17
quite 17
unforgettable 17
that 17
reminds 17
me 17
he 17
takes 17
a 17
vial 17
from 17
his 17
vest 17
shakes 17
a 17
few 17
deep 17
violet 17
pills 17
into 17
his 17
hand 17
and 17
holds 17
them 17
out 17
to 17
us 17
we 17
named 17
them 17
nightlock 17
in 17
your 17
honor 17
katniss 17
the 17
rebels 17
cant 17
afford 17
for 17
any 17
of 17
us 17
to 17
be 17
captured 17
now 17
but 17
i 17
promise 17
it 17
will 17
be 17
completely 17
painless 17
i 17
take 17
hold 17
of 17
a 17
capsule 17
unsure 17
of 17
where 17
to 17
put 17
it 17
plutarch 17
taps 17
a 17
spot 17
on 17
my 17
shoulder 17
at 17
the 17
front 17
of 17
my 17
left 17
sleeve 17
i 17
examine 17
it 17
and 17
find 17
a 17
tiny 17
pocket 17
that 17
both 17
secures 17
and 17
conceals 17
the 17
pill 17
even 17
if 17
my 17
hands 17
were 17
tied 17
i 17
could 17
lean 17
my 17
head 17
forward 17
and 17
bite 17
it 17
free 17
cinna 17

seems 17
has 17
thought 17
of 17
everything 17
the 17
hovercraft 17
makes 17
a 17
quick 17
spiral 17
descent 17
onto 17
a 17
wide 17
road 17
on 17
the 17
outskirts 17
of 17
almost 17
immediately 17
the 17
door 17
opens 17
the 17
stairs 17

into 17
place 17
and 17
were 17
spit 17
out 17
onto 17
the 17
asphalt 17
the 17
moment 17
the 17
last 17
person 17
disembarks 17
the 17
equipment 17
retracts 17
then 17
the 17
craft 17
lifts 17
off 17
and 17
vanishes 17
im 17
left 17
with 17
a 17
bodyguard 17
made 17
up 17
of 17
gale 17
boggs 17
and 17
two 17
other 17

of 17
burly 17
capitol 17
cameramen 17
with 17
heavy 17
mobile 17
cameras 17
encasing 17
their 17
bodies 17
like 17
insect 17
shells 17
a 17
woman 17
director 17
named 17
cressida 17
who 17
has 17
a 17
shaved 17

on 17
careful 17
observation 17
i 17
see 17
his 17
tongue 17
has 17
been 17
pierced 17
too 17
and 17

a 17
marble 17
boggs 17
hustles 17
us 17
off 17
the 17
road 17
toward 17
a 17
row 17
of 17
warehouses 17
as 17
a 17
second 17
hovercraft 17
comes 17
in 17
for 17
a 17
landing 17
this 17
one 17
brings 17
crates 17
of 17
medical 17

and 17
a 17
crew 17
of 17
six 17
medicsi 17
can 17
tell 17
by 17
their 17
distinctive 17
white 17
outfits 17
we 17
all 17
follow 17
boggs 17
down 17
an 17
alley 17
that 17
runs 17
between 17
two 17
dull 17
gray 17
warehouses 17
only 17
the 17
occasional 17
access 17
ladder 17
to 17
the 17
roof 17
interrupts 17
the 17
scarred 17
metal 17
walls 17
when 17
we 17
emerge 17
onto 17
the 17
street 17
its 17
like 17
weve 17
entered 17
another 17
world 17
the 17
wounded 17
from 17
this 17
mornings 17
bombing 17
are 17
being 17
brought 17
in 17
on 17
homemade 17
stretchers 17
in 17
wheelbarrows 17
on 17
carts 17
slung 17
across 17
shoulders 17
and 17
clenched 17
tight 17
in 17
arms 17
bleeding 17
limbless 17
unconscious 17
propelled 17
by 17
desperate 17
people 17
to 17
a 17
warehouse 17
with 17
a 17
sloppily 17
painted 17
h 17
above 17
the 17
doorway 17
its 17
a 17
scene 17
from 17
my 17
old 17
kitchen 17
where 17
my 17
mother 17
treated 17
the 17
dying 17
multiplied 17
by 17
ten 17
by 17
fifty 17
by 17
a 17
hundred 17
i 17
had 17
expected 17
bombedout 17
buildings 17
and 17
instead 17
find 17
myself 17
confronted 17
with 17
broken 17
human 17
bodies 17
this 17
is 17
where 17
they 17
plan 17
on 17
filming 17
me 17
i 17

work 17
i 17
say 17
i 17
wont 17
be 17
good 17
here 17
he 17
must 17
see 17
the 17
panic 17
in 17
my 17
eyes 17
because 17
he 17
stops 17
a 17
moment 17
and 17
places 17
his 17
hands 17
on 17
my 17
shoulders 17
you 17
will 17
just 17
let 17
them 17
see 17
you 17
that 17
will 17
do 17
more 17
for 17
them 17
than 17
any 17
doctor 17
in 17
the 17
world 17
could 17
a 17
woman 17
directing 17
the 17
incoming 17
patients 17
catches 17
sight 17
of 17
us 17
does 17
a 17
sort 17
of 17
double 17
take 17
and 17
then 17
strides 17
over 17
her 17
dark 17
brown 17
eyes 17
are 17
puffy 17
with 17
fatigue 17
and 17
she 17
smells 17
of 17
metal 17
and 17
sweat 17
a 17
bandage 17
around 17
her 17
throat 17
needed 17
changing 17
about 17
three 17
days 17
ago 17
the 17
strap 17
of 17
the 17
automatic 17
weapon 17
slung 17
across 17
her 17
back 17
digs 17
into 17
her 17
neck 17
and 17
she 17
shifts 17
her 17
shoulder 17
to 17
reposition 17
it 17
with 17
a 17
jerk 17
of 17
her 17
thumb 17
she 17
orders 17
the 17
medics 17
into 17
the 17
warehouse 17
they 17
comply 17
without 17
question 17

katniss 17
everdeen 17
she 17
looks 17
young 17
to 17
be 17
a 17
commander 17
early 17
thirties 17
but 17
theres 17
an 17
authoritative 17
tone 17
to 17
her 17
voice 17
that 17
makes 17
you 17
feel 17
her 17
appointment 17
wasnt 17
arbitrary 17
beside 17
her 17
in 17
my 17
spankingnew 17
outfit 17
scrubbed 17
and 17
shiny 17
i 17
feel 17
like 17
a 17
recently 17
hatched 17
chick 17
untested 17
and 17
only 17
just 17
learning 17
how 17
to 17
navigate 17
the 17
world 17
yeah 17
i 17
know 17
who 17
she 17
is 17
says 17
paylor 17

alive 17
then 17
we 17
werent 17
sure 17
am 17
i 17
wrong 17
or 17
is 17
there 17
a 17
note 17
of 17
accusation 17
in 17
her 17
voice 17
im 17
still 17
not 17
sure 17
myself 17
i 17
answer 17
been 17
in 17
recovery 17
boggs 17
taps 17
his 17
head 17
bad 17
concussion 17
he 17
lowers 17
his 17
voice 17
a 17
moment 17
miscarriage 17
but 17
she 17
insisted 17
on 17
coming 17
by 17
to 17
see 17
your 17
wounded 17
well 17
weve 17
got 17
plenty 17
of 17
those 17
says 17
paylor 17
you 17
think 17
this 17
is 17
a 17
good 17
idea 17
says 17
gale 17
frowning 17
at 17
the 17
hospital 17
assembling 17
your 17
wounded 17
like 17
this 17
i 17
dont 17
any 17
sort 17
of 17
contagious 17
disease 17
would 17
spread 17
through 17
this 17
place 17
like 17
wildfire 17
i 17
think 17
its 17
slightly 17
better 17
than 17
leaving 17
them 17
to 17
die 17
says 17
paylor 17
thats 17
not 17
what 17
i 17
meant 17
gale 17
tells 17
her 17
well 17
currently 17
thats 17
my 17
other 17
option 17
but 17
if 17
you 17
come 17
up 17
with 17
a 17
third 17
and 17
get 17
coin 17
to 17
back 17
it 17
im 17
all 17
ears 17
paylor 17
waves 17
me 17
toward 17
the 17
door 17
come 17
on 17
in 17
mockingjay 17
and 17
by 17
all 17
means 17
bring 17
your 17
friends 17
i 17
glance 17
back 17
at 17
the 17
freak 17
show 17
that 17
is 17
my 17
crew 17
steel 17
myself 17
and 17
follow 17
her 17
into 17
the 17
hospital 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
heavy 17
industrial 17
curtain 17
hangs 17
the 17
length 17
of 17
the 17
building 17
forming 17
a 17
sizable 17
corridor 17
corpses 17
lie 17
side 17
by 17
side 17
curtain 17
brushing 17
their 17
heads 17
white 17
cloths 17
concealing 17
their 17
faces 17
weve 17
got 17
a 17
mass 17
grave 17
started 17
a 17
few 17
blocks 17
west 17
of 17
here 17
but 17
i 17
cant 17
spare 17
the 17
manpower 17
to 17
move 17
them 17
yet 17
says 17
paylor 17
she 17
finds 17
a 17
slit 17
in 17
the 17
curtain 17
and 17
opens 17
it 17
wide 17
my 17
fingers 17
wrap 17
around 17
gales 17
wrist 17
do 17
not 17
leave 17
my 17
side 17
i 17
say 17
under 17
my 17
breath 17
im 17
right 17
here 17
he 17
answers 17
quietly 17
i 17
step 17
through 17
the 17
curtain 17
and 17
my 17
senses 17
are 17
assaulted 17
my 17
first 17
impulse 17
is 17
to 17
cover 17
my 17
nose 17
to 17
block 17
out 17
the 17
stench 17
of 17
soiled 17
linen 17
putrefying 17
flesh 17
and 17
vomit 17
all 17
ripening 17
in 17
the 17
heat 17
of 17
the 17
warehouse 17
theyve 17
propped 17
open 17
skylights 17
that 17
crisscross 17
the 17
high 17
metal 17
roof 17
but 17
any 17
air 17
thats 17
managing 17
to 17
get 17
in 17
cant 17
make 17
a 17
dent 17
in 17
the 17
fog 17
below 17
the 17
thin 17
shafts 17
of 17
sunlight 17
provide 17
the 17
only 17
illumination 17
and 17
as 17
my 17
eyes 17
adjust 17
i 17
can 17
make 17
out 17
row 17
upon 17
row 17
of 17
wounded 17
in 17
cots 17
on 17
pallets 17
on 17
the 17
floor 17
because 17
there 17
are 17
so 17
many 17
to 17
claim 17
the 17
space 17
the 17
drone 17
of 17
black 17
flies 17
the 17
moaning 17
of 17
people 17
in 17
pain 17
and 17
the 17
sobs 17
of 17
their 17
attending 17
loved 17
ones 17
have 17
combined 17
into 17
a 17
wrenching 17
chorus 17
we 17
have 17
no 17
real 17
hospitals 17
in 17
the 17
districts 17
we 17
die 17
at 17
home 17
which 17
at 17
the 17
moment 17
seems 17
a 17
far 17
desirable 17
alternative 17
to 17
what 17
lies 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
me 17
then 17
i 17
remember 17
that 17
many 17
of 17
these 17
people 17
probably 17
lost 17
their 17
homes 17
in 17
the 17
bombings 17
sweat 17
begins 17
to 17
run 17
down 17
my 17
back 17
fill 17
my 17
palms 17
i 17
breathe 17
through 17
my 17
mouth 17
in 17
an 17
attempt 17
to 17
diminish 17
the 17
smell 17
black 17
spots 17
swim 17
across 17
my 17
field 17
of 17
vision 17
and 17
i 17
think 17
theres 17
a 17
really 17
good 17
chance 17
i 17
could 17
faint 17
but 17
then 17
i 17
catch 17
sight 17
of 17
paylor 17
whos 17
watching 17
me 17
so 17
closely 17
waiting 17
to 17
see 17
what 17
i 17
am 17
made 17
of 17
and 17
if 17
any 17
of 17
them 17
have 17
been 17
right 17
to 17
think 17
they 17
can 17
count 17
on 17
me 17
so 17
i 17
let 17
go 17
of 17
gale 17
and 17
force 17
myself 17
to 17
move 17
deeper 17
into 17
the 17
warehouse 17
to 17
walk 17
into 17
the 17
narrow 17
strip 17
between 17
two 17
rows 17
of 17
beds 17
katniss 17
a 17
voice 17
croaks 17
out 17
from 17
my 17
left 17
breaking 17
apart 17
from 17
the 17
general 17
din 17
katniss 17
a 17
hand 17
reaches 17
for 17
me 17
out 17
of 17
the 17
haze 17
i 17
cling 17
to 17
it 17
for 17
support 17
attached 17
to 17
the 17
hand 17
is 17
a 17
young 17
woman 17
with 17
an 17
injured 17
leg 17
blood 17
has 17
seeped 17
through 17
the 17
heavy 17
bandages 17
which 17
are 17
crawling 17
with 17
flies 17
her 17
face 17
reflects 17
her 17
pain 17
but 17
something 17
else 17
too 17
something 17
that 17
seems 17
completely 17
incongruous 17
with 17
her 17
situation 17
is 17
it 17

a 17
greeting 17

his 17
one 17
good 17
eye 17
fixes 17
on 17

with 17
such 17
intensity 17
as 17
if 17

every 17
detail 17
of 17
my 17
face 17

hear 17
my 17
name 17

through 17
the 17
hot 17
air 17

out 17
into 17
the 17
hospital 17
katniss 17
katniss 17
everdeen 17
the 17
sounds 17
of 17
pain 17
and 17
grief 17
begin 17
to 17
recede 17
to 17
be 17
replaced 17
by 17
words 17
of 17
anticipation 17
from 17
all 17
sides 17
voices 17
beckon 17
me 17
i 17
begin 17
to 17
move 17
clasping 17
the 17
hands 17
extended 17
to 17
me 17
touching 17
the 17
sound 17
parts 17
of 17
those 17
unable 17
to 17
move 17
their 17
limbs 17
saying 17
hello 17
how 17
are 17
you 17
good 17
to 17
meet 17
you 17
nothing 17
of 17
importance 17
no 17
amazing 17
words 17
of 17
inspiration 17
but 17
it 17
doesnt 17
matter 17
boggs 17
is 17
right 17
its 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
me 17
alive 17
that 17
is 17
the 17
inspiration 17
hungry 17
fingers 17
devour 17
me 17
wanting 17
to 17
feel 17
my 17
flesh 17
as 17
a 17
stricken 17
man 17
clutches 17
my 17
face 17
between 17
his 17
hands 17
i 17
send 17
a 17
silent 17
thankyou 17
to 17
dalton 17
for 17
suggesting 17
i 17
wash 17
off 17
the 17
makeup 17
how 17
ridiculous 17
how 17
perverse 17
i 17
would 17
feel 17
presenting 17
that 17
painted 17
capitol 17
mask 17
to 17
these 17
people 17
the 17
damage 17
the 17
fatigue 17
the 17
imperfections 17
thats 17
how 17
they 17
recognize 17
me 17
why 17
i 17
belong 17
to 17
them 17
despite 17
his 17
controversial 17
interview 17
with 17
caesar 17
many 17
ask 17
about 17
peeta 17
assure 17
me 17
that 17
they 17
know 17
he 17
was 17
speaking 17
under 17
duress 17
i 17
do 17
my 17
best 17
to 17
sound 17
positive 17
about 17
our 17
future 17
but 17
people 17
are 17
truly 17
devastated 17
when 17
they 17
learn 17
ive 17
lost 17
the 17
baby 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
come 17
clean 17
and 17
tell 17
one 17
weeping 17
woman 17
that 17
it 17
was 17
all 17
a 17
hoax 17
a 17
move 17
in 17
the 17
game 17
but 17
to 17
present 17
peeta 17
as 17
a 17
liar 17
now 17
would 17
not 17
help 17
his 17
image 17
or 17
mine 17
or 17
the 17
cause 17
i 17
begin 17
to 17
fully 17
understand 17
the 17
lengths 17
to 17
which 17
people 17
have 17
gone 17
to 17
protect 17
me 17
what 17
i 17
mean 17
to 17
the 17
rebels 17
my 17
ongoing 17
struggle 17
against 17
the 17
capitol 17
which 17
has 17
so 17
often 17
felt 17
like 17
a 17
solitary 17
journey 17
has 17
not 17
been 17
undertaken 17
alone 17
i 17
have 17
had 17
thousands 17
upon 17
thousands 17
of 17
people 17
from 17
the 17
districts 17
at 17
my 17
side 17
i 17
was 17
their 17
mockingjay 17
long 17
before 17
i 17
accepted 17
the 17
role 17
a 17
new 17
sensation 17
begins 17
to 17
germinate 17
inside 17
me 17
but 17
it 17
takes 17
until 17
i 17
am 17
standing 17
on 17
a 17
table 17
waving 17
my 17
final 17
goodbyes 17
to 17
the 17
hoarse 17
chanting 17
of 17
my 17
name 17
to 17
define 17
it 17
power 17
i 17
have 17
a 17
kind 17
of 17
power 17
i 17
never 17
knew 17
i 17
possessed 17
snow 17
knew 17
it 17
as 17
soon 17
as 17
i 17
held 17
out 17
those 17
berries 17
plutarch 17
knew 17
when 17
he 17
rescued 17
me 17
from 17
the 17
arena 17
and 17
coin 17
knows 17
now 17
so 17
much 17
so 17
that 17
she 17
must 17
publicly 17
remind 17
her 17
people 17
that 17
i 17
am 17
not 17
in 17
control 17
when 17
were 17
outside 17
again 17
i 17
lean 17
against 17
the 17
warehouse 17
catching 17
my 17
breath 17
accepting 17
the 17
canteen 17
of 17
water 17
from 17
boggs 17
you 17
did 17
great 17
he 17
says 17
well 17
i 17
didnt 17
faint 17
or 17
throw 17
up 17
or 17
run 17
out 17
screaming 17
mostly 17
i 17
just 17
rode 17
the 17
wave 17
of 17
emotion 17
rolling 17
through 17
the 17
place 17
we 17
got 17
some 17
nice 17
stuff 17
in 17
there 17
says 17
cressida 17
i 17
look 17
at 17
the 17
insect 17
cameramen 17
perspiration 17
pouring 17
from 17
under 17
their 17
equipment 17
messalla 17
scribbling 17
notes 17
i 17
had 17
forgotten 17
they 17
were 17
even 17
filming 17
me 17
i 17
didnt 17
do 17
much 17
really 17
i 17
say 17
you 17
have 17
to 17
give 17
yourself 17
some 17
credit 17
for 17
what 17
youve 17
done 17
in 17
the 17
past 17
says 17
boggs 17
what 17
ive 17
done 17
in 17
the 17
past 17
i 17
think 17
of 17
the 17
trail 17
of 17
destruction 17
in 17
my 17
wakemy 17
knees 17
weaken 17
and 17
i 17
slide 17
down 17
to 17
a 17
sitting 17
position 17
thats 17
a 17
mixed 17
bag 17
well 17
youre 17
not 17
perfect 17
by 17
a 17
long 17
shot 17
but 17
times 17
being 17
what 17
they 17
are 17
youll 17
have 17
to 17
do 17
says 17
boggs 17
gale 17
squats 17
down 17
beside 17
me 17
shaking 17
his 17
head 17
i 17
cant 17
believe 17
you 17
let 17
all 17
those 17
people 17
touch 17
you 17
i 17
kept 17
expecting 17
you 17
to 17
make 17
a 17
break 17
for 17
the 17
door 17
shut 17
up 17
i 17
say 17
with 17
a 17
laugh 17
your 17
mothers 17
going 17
to 17
be 17
very 17
proud 17
when 17
she 17
sees 17
the 17
footage 17

my 17
mother 17
wont 17
even 17
notice 17
me 17

too 17
appalled 17
by 17
the 17
conditions 17
in 17
there 17
i 17
turn 17
to 17
boggs 17
and 17
ask 17

in 17
aid 17
wherever 17
we 17
can 17
but 17
its 17
not 17
enough 17
he 17
stops 17
a 17
minute 17
distracted 17
by 17
something 17
in 17
his 17
earpiece 17
i 17
realize 17
i 17
havent 17
heard 17
haymitchs 17
voice 17
once 17
and 17
fiddle 17
with 17
mine 17
wondering 17
if 17

broken 17
were 17
to 17
get 17
to 17
the 17
airstrip 17
immediately 17
boggs 17

lifting 17
me 17
to 17
my 17
feet 17
with 17
one 17
hand 17
theres 17
a 17
problem 17

of 17
problem 17

incoming 17
bombers 17
says 17
boggs 17

behind 17

neck 17
and 17
yanks 17
cinnas 17

up 17
onto 17
my 17
head 17

unsure 17
of 17
whats 17

on 17
i 17
take 17
off 17
running 17
along 17
the 17
front 17
of 17
the 17
warehouse 17
heading 17
for 17
the 17
alley 17
that 17
leads 17
to 17
the 17
airstrip 17
but 17
i 17
dont 17
sense 17
any 17
immediate 17
threat 17
the 17
skys 17
an 17
empty 17
cloudless 17
blue 17
the 17
streets 17
clear 17
except 17
for 17
the 17
people 17
hauling 17
the 17
wounded 17
to 17
the 17
hospital 17
theres 17
no 17
enemy 17
no 17
alarm 17
then 17
the 17
sirens 17
begin 17
to 17
wail 17
within 17
seconds 17
a 17
lowflying 17
vshaped 17
formation 17
of 17
capitol 17
hoverplanes 17
appears 17
above 17
us 17
and 17
the 17
bombs 17
begin 17
to 17
fall 17
im 17
blown 17
off 17
my 17
feet 17
into 17
the 17
front 17
wall 17
of 17
the 17
warehouse 17
theres 17
a 17
searing 17
pain 17
just 17
above 17
the 17
back 17
of 17
my 17
right 17
knee 17
something 17
has 17
struck 17
my 17
back 17
as 17
well 17
but 17
doesnt 17
seem 17
to 17
have 17
penetrated 17
my 17
vest 17
i 17
try 17
to 17
get 17
up 17
but 17
boggs 17
pushes 17
me 17
back 17
down 17
shielding 17
my 17
body 17
with 17
his 17
own 17
the 17
ground 17
ripples 17
under 17
me 17
as 17
bomb 17
after 17
bomb 17
drops 17
from 17
the 17
planes 17
and 17
detonates 17
its 17
a 17
horrifying 17
sensation 17
being 17
pinned 17
against 17
the 17
wall 17
as 17
the 17
bombs 17
rain 17
down 17
what 17
was 17
that 17
expression 17
my 17
father 17
used 17
for 17
easy 17
kills 17
like 17
shooting 17
fish 17
in 17
a 17
barrel 17

so 17
they 17
dont 17
know 17

here 17
i 17
assumed 17
as 17
usual 17
it 17
was 17
my 17
presence 17
that 17
brought 17
on 17
punishment 17
intelligence 17
thinks 17
no 17
that 17
this 17
raid 17
was 17
already 17
scheduled 17
says 17
haymitch 17
now 17
plutarchs 17
voice 17
comes 17
up 17
calm 17
but 17
forceful 17
the 17
voice 17
of 17
a 17
head 17
gamemaker 17
used 17
to 17
calling 17
the 17
shots 17
under 17
pressure 17
theres 17
a 17
light 17
blue 17

boggs 17
plutarch 17
must 17
be 17
in 17
everyones 17
ear 17
because 17
my 17
bodyguards 17
and 17
crew 17
are 17
getting 17
up 17
my 17
eye 17
instinctively 17
searches 17
for 17
gale 17
and 17
sees 17
hes 17
on 17
his 17
feet 17
apparently 17
unharmed 17
youve 17
got 17
maybe 17
fortyfive 17
seconds 17
to 17
the 17
next 17
wave 17
says 17
plutarch 17
i 17
give 17
a 17
grunt 17
of 17
pain 17
as 17
my 17
right 17
leg 17
takes 17
the 17
weight 17
of 17
my 17
body 17
but 17
i 17
keep 17
moving 17
no 17
time 17
to 17
examine 17
the 17
injury 17
better 17
not 17
to 17
look 17
now 17
anyway 17
fortunately 17
i 17
have 17
on 17
shoes 17
that 17
cinna 17
designed 17
they 17
grip 17
the 17
asphalt 17
on 17
contact 17
and 17
spring 17
free 17
of 17
it 17
on 17
release 17
id 17
be 17
hopeless 17
in 17
that 17
illfitting 17
pair 17
that 17
assigned 17
to 17
me 17
boggs 17
has 17
the 17
lead 17
but 17
no 17
one 17
else 17
passes 17
me 17
instead 17
they 17
match 17
my 17
pace 17
protecting 17
my 17
sides 17
my 17
back 17
i 17
force 17
myself 17
into 17
a 17
sprint 17
as 17
the 17
seconds 17
tick 17
away 17
we 17
pass 17
the 17
second 17
gray 17
warehouse 17
and 17
run 17
along 17
a 17
dirt 17
brown 17
building 17
up 17
ahead 17
i 17
see 17
a 17
faded 17
blue 17
facade 17
home 17
of 17
the 17
bunker 17
we 17
have 17
just 17
reached 17
another 17
alley 17
need 17
only 17
to 17
cross 17
it 17
to 17
arrive 17
at 17
the 17
door 17
when 17
the 17
next 17
wave 17
of 17
bombs 17
begins 17
i 17
instinctively 17
dive 17
into 17
the 17
alley 17
and 17
roll 17
toward 17
the 17
blue 17
wall 17
this 17
time 17
its 17
gale 17
who 17
throws 17
himself 17
over 17
me 17
to 17
provide 17
one 17
more 17
layer 17
of 17
protection 17
from 17
the 17
bombing 17
it 17
seems 17
to 17
go 17
on 17
longer 17
this 17
time 17
but 17
we 17
are 17
farther 17
away 17
i 17
shift 17
onto 17
my 17
side 17
and 17
find 17
myself 17
looking 17
directly 17
into 17
gales 17
eyes 17
for 17
an 17
instant 17
the 17
world 17
recedes 17
and 17
there 17
is 17
just 17
his 17
flushed 17
face 17
his 17
pulse 17
visible 17
at 17
his 17
temple 17
his 17
lips 17
slightly 17
parted 17
as 17
he 17
tries 17
to 17
catch 17
his 17
breath 17
you 17
all 17
right 17
he 17
asks 17
his 17
words 17
nearly 17
drowned 17
out 17
by 17
an 17
explosion 17
yeah 17
i 17
dont 17
think 17
theyve 17
seen 17
me 17
i 17
answer 17
i 17
mean 17
theyre 17
not 17
following 17
us 17
no 17
theyve 17
targeted 17
something 17
else 17
says 17
gale 17
i 17
know 17
but 17
theres 17
nothing 17
back 17
there 17
but 17
the 17
realization 17
hits 17
us 17
at 17
the 17
same 17
time 17
the 17
hospital 17
instantly 17
gales 17
up 17
and 17
shouting 17
to 17
the 17
others 17
theyre 17
targeting 17
the 17
hospital 17
not 17
your 17
problem 17
says 17
plutarch 17
firmly 17
get 17
to 17
the 17
bunker 17
but 17
theres 17
nothing 17
there 17
but 17
the 17
wounded 17
i 17
say 17
katniss 17
i 17
hear 17
the 17
warning 17
note 17
in 17
haymitchs 17
voice 17
and 17
know 17
whats 17
coming 17
dont 17
you 17
even 17
think 17
about 17
i 17
yank 17
the 17
earpiece 17
free 17
and 17
let 17
it 17
hang 17
from 17
its 17
wire 17
with 17
that 17
distraction 17
gone 17
i 17
hear 17
another 17
sound 17
machine 17
gun 17
fire 17
coming 17
from 17
the 17
roof 17
of 17
the 17
dirt 17
brown 17
warehouse 17
across 17
the 17
alley 17
someone 17
is 17
returning 17
fire 17
before 17
anyone 17
can 17
stop 17
me 17
i 17
make 17
a 17
dash 17
for 17
an 17
access 17
ladder 17
and 17
begin 17
to 17
scale 17
it 17
climbing 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
things 17
i 17
do 17
best 17
dont 17
stop 17
i 17
hear 17
gale 17
say 17
behind 17
me 17
then 17
theres 17
the 17
sound 17
of 17
his 17
boot 17
on 17
someones 17
face 17
if 17
it 17
belongs 17
to 17
boggs 17
gales 17
going 17
to 17
pay 17
for 17
it 17
dearly 17
later 17
on 17
i 17
make 17
the 17
roof 17
and 17
drag 17
myself 17
onto 17
the 17
tar 17
i 17
stop 17
long 17
enough 17
to 17
pull 17
gale 17
up 17
beside 17
me 17
and 17
then 17
we 17
take 17
off 17
for 17
the 17
row 17
of 17
machine 17
gun 17
nests 17
on 17
the 17
street 17
side 17
of 17
the 17
warehouse 17
each 17
looks 17
to 17
be 17
manned 17
by 17
a 17
few 17
rebels 17
we 17
skid 17
into 17
a 17
nest 17
with 17
a 17
pair 17
of 17
soldiers 17
hunching 17
down 17
behind 17
the 17
barrier 17
boggs 17
know 17
youre 17
up 17
here 17
to 17
my 17
left 17
i 17
see 17
paylor 17
behind 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
guns 17
looking 17
at 17
us 17
quizzically 17
i 17
try 17
to 17
be 17
evasive 17
without 17
flatout 17
lying 17
he 17
knows 17
where 17
we 17
are 17
all 17
right 17
paylor 17
laughs 17
i 17
bet 17
he 17
does 17
you 17
been 17
trained 17
in 17
these 17
she 17
slaps 17
the 17
stock 17
of 17
her 17
gun 17
i 17
have 17
in 17
thirteen 17
says 17
gale 17
but 17
id 17
rather 17
use 17
my 17
own 17
weapons 17
yes 17
weve 17
got 17
our 17
bows 17
i 17
hold 17
mine 17
up 17
then 17
realize 17
how 17
decorative 17
it 17
must 17
seem 17
its 17
more 17
deadly 17
than 17
it 17
looks 17
it 17
would 17
have 17
to 17
be 17
says 17
paylor 17
all 17
right 17
we 17
expect 17
at 17
least 17
three 17
more 17
waves 17
they 17
have 17
to 17
drop 17
their 17
sight 17
shields 17
before 17
they 17
release 17
the 17
bombs 17
thats 17
our 17
chance 17
stay 17
low 17
i 17
position 17
myself 17
to 17
shoot 17
from 17
one 17
knee 17
better 17
start 17
with 17
fire 17
says 17
gale 17
i 17
nod 17
and 17
pull 17
an 17
arrow 17
from 17
my 17
right 17
sheath 17
if 17
we 17
miss 17
our 17
targets 17
these 17
arrows 17
will 17
land 17
somewhereprobably 17
the 17
warehouses 17
across 17
the 17
street 17
a 17
fire 17
can 17
be 17
put 17
out 17
but 17
the 17
damage 17
an 17
explosive 17
can 17
do 17
may 17
be 17
irreparable 17
suddenly 17
they 17
appear 17
in 17
the 17
sky 17
two 17
blocks 17
down 17
maybe 17
a 17
hundred 17
yards 17
above 17

hell 17
know 17
exactly 17
what 17
i 17
mean 17
during 17
migration 17
season 17
when 17
we 17
hunt 17
fowl 17
weve 17
developed 17
a 17
system 17
of 17
dividing 17
the 17
birds 17
so 17
we 17
dont 17
both 17
target 17
the 17
same 17
ones 17
i 17
get 17
the 17
far 17
side 17
of 17
the 17
v 17
gale 17
takes 17
the 17
near 17
and 17
we 17
alternate 17
shots 17
at 17
the 17

theres 17
no 17

for 17

estimate 17
the 17
lead 17

on 17
the 17

and 17
let 17
my 17

fly 17
i 17
catch 17
the 17

my 17

hit 17
the 17

i 17
find 17
a 17
bodyguard 17
cressida 17
and 17
the 17
other 17

waiting 17
i 17

just 17
waves 17
me 17
toward 17
the 17
hospital 17
shes 17
yelling 17
i 17
dont 17
care 17
plutarch 17
just 17
give 17
me 17
five 17
more 17
minutes 17
not 17
one 17
to 17
question 17
a 17
free 17
pass 17
i 17
take 17
off 17
into 17
the 17
street 17
oh 17
no 17
i 17
whisper 17
as 17
i 17
catch 17
sight 17
of 17
the 17
hospital 17
what 17
used 17
to 17
be 17
the 17
hospital 17
i 17
move 17
past 17
the 17
wounded 17
past 17
the 17
burning 17
plane 17
wrecks 17
fixated 17
on 17
the 17
disaster 17
ahead 17
of 17
me 17
people 17
screaming 17
running 17
about 17
frantically 17
but 17
unable 17
to 17
help 17
the 17
bombs 17
have 17
collapsed 17
the 17
hospital 17
roof 17
and 17
set 17
the 17
building 17
on 17
fire 17
effectively 17
trapping 17
the 17
patients 17
within 17
a 17
group 17
of 17
rescuers 17
has 17
assembled 17
trying 17
to 17
clear 17
a 17
path 17
to 17
the 17
inside 17
but 17
i 17
already 17
know 17
what 17
they 17
will 17
find 17
if 17
the 17
crushing 17
debris 17
and 17
the 17
flames 17
didnt 17
get 17
them 17
the 17
smoke 17
did 17
gales 17
at 17
my 17
shoulder 17
the 17
fact 17
that 17
he 17
does 17
nothing 17
only 17
confirms 17
my 17
suspicions 17
miners 17
dont 17
abandon 17
an 17
accident 17
until 17
its 17
hopeless 17
come 17
on 17
katniss 17
haymitch 17
says 17
they 17
can 17
get 17
a 17
hovercraft 17
in 17
for 17
us 17
now 17
he 17
tells 17
me 17
but 17
i 17
cant 17
seem 17
to 17
move 17
why 17
would 17
they 17
do 17
that 17
why 17
would 17
they 17
target 17
people 17
who 17
were 17
already 17
dying 17
i 17
ask 17
him 17
scare 17
others 17
off 17
prevent 17
the 17
wounded 17
from 17
seeking 17
help 17
says 17
gale 17
those 17
people 17
you 17
met 17
they 17
were 17
expendable 17
to 17
snow 17
anyway 17
if 17
the 17
capitol 17
wins 17
what 17
will 17
it 17
do 17
with 17
a 17
bunch 17
of 17
damaged 17
slaves 17
i 17
remember 17
all 17
those 17
years 17
in 17
the 17
woods 17
listening 17
to 17
gale 17
rant 17
against 17
the 17
capitol 17
me 17
not 17
paying 17
close 17
attention 17
wondering 17
why 17
he 17
even 17
bothered 17
to 17
dissect 17
its 17
motives 17
why 17
thinking 17
like 17
our 17
enemy 17
would 17
ever 17
matter 17
clearly 17
it 17
could 17
have 17
mattered 17
today 17
when 17
gale 17
questioned 17
the 17
existence 17
of 17
the 17
hospital 17
he 17
was 17
not 17
thinking 17
of 17
disease 17
but 17
this 17
because 17
he 17
never 17
underestimates 17
the 17
cruelty 17
of 17
those 17
we 17
face 17
i 17
slowly 17
turn 17
my 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
hospital 17
and 17
find 17
cressida 17
flanked 17
by 17
the 17
insects 17
standing 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
yards 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
me 17
her 17
manners 17
unrattled 17
cool 17
even 17
katniss 17
she 17
says 17
president 17
snow 17
just 17
had 17
them 17
air 17
the 17
bombing 17
live 17
then 17
he 17
made 17
an 17
appearance 17
to 17
say 17
that 17
this 17
was 17
his 17
way 17
of 17
sending 17
a 17
message 17
to 17
the 17
rebels 17
what 17
about 17
you 17
would 17
you 17
like 17
to 17
tell 17
the 17
rebels 17
anything 17
yes 17
i 17
whisper 17
the 17
red 17
blinking 17
light 17
on 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
cameras 17
catches 17
my 17
eye 17
i 17
know 17
im 17
being 17
recorded 17
yes 17
i 17
say 17
more 17
forcefully 17
everyone 17
is 17
drawing 17
away 17
from 17
me 17
gale 17
cressida 17
the 17
insectsgiving 17
me 17
the 17
stage 17
but 17
i 17
stay 17
focused 17
on 17
the 17
red 17
light 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
tell 17
the 17
rebels 17
that 17
i 17
am 17
alive 17
that 17
im 17
right 17
here 17
in 17
district 17
eight 17
where 17
the 17
capitol 17
has 17
just 17
bombed 17
a 17
hospital 17
full 17
of 17
unarmed 17
men 17
women 17
and 17
children 17
there 17
will 17
be 17
no 17
survivors 17
the 17
shock 17
ive 17
been 17
feeling 17
begins 17
to 17
give 17
way 17
to 17
fury 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
tell 17
people 17
that 17
if 17
you 17
think 17
for 17
one 17
second 17
the 17
capitol 17
will 17
treat 17
us 17
fairly 17
if 17
theres 17
a 17
ceasefire 17
youre 17
deluding 17
yourself 17
because 17
you 17
know 17
who 17
they 17
are 17
and 17
what 17
they 17
do 17
my 17
hands 17
go 17
out 17
automatically 17
as 17
if 17
to 17
indicate 17
the 17
whole 17
horror 17
around 17
me 17
this 17
is 17
what 17
they 17
do 17
and 17
we 17
must 17
fight 17
back 17
im 17
moving 17
in 17
toward 17
the 17
camera 17
now 17
carried 17
forward 17
by 17
my 17
rage 17
president 17
snow 17
says 17
hes 17
sending 17
us 17
a 17
message 17
well 17
i 17
have 17
one 17
for 17
him 17
you 17
can 17
torture 17
us 17
and 17
bomb 17
us 17
and 17
burn 17
our 17
districts 17
to 17
the 17
ground 17
but 17
do 17
you 17
see 17
that 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
cameras 17
follows 17
as 17
i 17
point 17
to 17
the 17
planes 17
burning 17
on 17
the 17
roof 17
of 17
the 17
warehouse 17
across 17
from 17
us 17
the 17
capitol 17
seal 17
on 17
a 17
wing 17
glows 17
clearly 17
through 17
the 17
flames 17
fire 17
is 17
catching 17
i 17
am 17
shouting 17
now 17
determined 17
that 17
he 17
will 17
not 17
miss 17
a 17
word 17
and 17
if 17
we 17
burn 17
you 17
burn 17
with 17
us 17
my 17
last 17
words 17
hang 17
in 17
the 17
air 17
i 17
feel 17
suspended 17
in 17
time 17
held 17
aloft 17
in 17
a 17
cloud 17
of 17
heat 17
that 17
generates 17
not 17
from 17
my 17
surroundings 17
but 17
from 17
my 17
own 17
being 17
cut 17
cressidas 17
voice 17
snaps 17
me 17
back 17
to 17
reality 17
extinguishes 17
me 17
she 17
gives 17
me 17
a 17
nod 17
of 17
approval 17
thats 17
a 17
wrap 17
boggs 17
appears 17
and 17
gets 17
a 17
firm 17
lock 17
on 17
my 17
arm 17
but 17
im 17
not 17
planning 17
on 17
running 17
now 17
i 17
look 17
over 17
at 17
the 17
hospitaljust 17
in 17
time 17
to 17
see 17
the 17
rest 17
of 17
the 17
structure 17
give 17
wayand 17
the 17
fight 17
goes 17
out 17
of 17
me 17
all 17
those 17
people 17
the 17
hundreds 17
of 17
wounded 17
the 17
relatives 17
the 17
medics 17
from 17
are 17
no 17
more 17
i 17
turn 17
back 17
to 17
boggs 17
see 17
the 17
swelling 17
on 17
his 17
face 17
left 17
by 17
gales 17
boot 17
im 17
no 17
expert 17
but 17
im 17
pretty 17
sure 17
his 17
nose 17
is 17
broken 17
his 17
voice 17
is 17
more 17
resigned 17
than 17
angry 17
though 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
landing 17
strip 17
i 17
obediently 17
take 17
a 17
step 17
forward 17
and 17
wince 17
as 17
i 17
become 17
aware 17
of 17
the 17
pain 17
behind 17
my 17
right 17
knee 17
the 17
adrenaline 17
rush 17
that 17
overrode 17
the 17
sensation 17
has 17
passed 17
and 17
my 17
body 17
parts 17
join 17
in 17
a 17
chorus 17
of 17
complaints 17
im 17
banged 17
up 17
and 17
bloody 17
and 17
someone 17
seems 17
to 17
be 17
hammering 17
on 17
my 17
left 17
temple 17
from 17
inside 17
my 17
skull 17
boggs 17
quickly 17
examines 17
my 17
face 17
then 17
scoops 17
me 17
up 17
and 17
jogs 17
for 17
the 17
runway 17
halfway 17
there 17
i 17
puke 17
on 17
his 17
bulletproof 17
vest 17
its 17
hard 17
to 17
tell 17
because 17
hes 17
short 17
of 17
breath 17
but 17
i 17
think 17
he 17
sighs 17
a 17
small 17
hovercraft 17
different 17
from 17
the 17
one 17
that 17
transported 17
us 17
here 17
waits 17
on 17
the 17
runway 17
the 17
second 17
my 17
teams 17
on 17
board 17
we 17
take 17
off 17
no 17
comfy 17
seats 17
and 17
windows 17
this 17
time 17
we 17
seem 17
to 17
be 17
in 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
cargo 17
craft 17
boggs 17
does 17
emergency 17
first 17
aid 17
on 17
people 17
to 17
hold 17
them 17
until 17
we 17
get 17
back 17
to 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
take 17
off 17
my 17
vest 17
since 17
i 17
got 17
a 17
fair 17
amount 17
of 17
vomit 17
on 17
it 17
as 17
well 17
but 17
its 17
too 17
cold 17
to 17
think 17
about 17
it 17
i 17
lie 17
on 17
the 17
floor 17
with 17
my 17
head 17
in 17
gales 17
lap 17
the 17
last 17
thing 17
i 17
remember 17
is 17
boggs 17
spreading 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
burlap 17
sacks 17
over 17
me 17
when 17
i 17
wake 17
up 17
im 17
warm 17
and 17
patched 17
up 17
in 17
my 17
old 17
bed 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17
my 17
mothers 17
there 17
checking 17
my 17
vital 17
signs 17
how 17
do 17
you 17
feel 17
a 17
little 17
beatup 17
but 17
all 17
right 17
i 17
say 17
no 17
one 17
even 17
told 17
us 17
you 17
were 17
going 17
until 17
you 17
were 17
gone 17
she 17
says 17
i 17
feel 17
a 17
pang 17
of 17
guilt 17
when 17
your 17
familys 17
had 17
to 17
send 17
you 17
off 17
twice 17
to 17
the 17
hunger 17
games 17
this 17
isnt 17
the 17
kind 17
of 17
detail 17
you 17
should 17
overlook 17
im 17
sorry 17
they 17
werent 17
expecting 17
the 17
attack 17
i 17
was 17
just 17
supposed 17
to 17
be 17
visiting 17
the 17
patients 17
i 17
explain 17
next 17
time 17
ill 17
have 17
them 17
clear 17
it 17
with 17
you 17
katniss 17
no 17
one 17
clears 17
anything 17
with 17
me 17
she 17
says 17
its 17
true 17
even 17
i 17
dont 17
not 17
since 17
my 17
father 17
died 17
why 17
pretend 17
well 17
ill 17
have 17
themnotify 17
you 17
anyway 17
on 17
the 17
bedside 17
table 17
is 17
a 17
piece 17
of 17
shrapnel 17
they 17
removed 17
from 17
my 17
leg 17
the 17
doctors 17
are 17
more 17
concerned 17
with 17
the 17
damage 17
my 17
brain 17
might 17
have 17
suffered 17
from 17
the 17
explosions 17
since 17
my 17
concussion 17
hadnt 17
fully 17
healed 17
to 17
begin 17
with 17
but 17
i 17
dont 17
have 17
double 17
vision 17
or 17
anything 17
and 17
i 17
can 17
think 17
clearly 17
enough 17
ive 17
slept 17
right 17
through 17
the 17
late 17
afternoon 17
and 17
night 17
and 17
im 17
starving 17
my 17
breakfast 17
is 17
disappointingly 17
small 17
just 17
a 17
few 17
cubes 17
of 17
bread 17
soaking 17
in 17
warm 17
milk 17
ive 17
been 17
called 17
down 17
to 17
an 17
early 17
morning 17
meeting 17
at 17
command 17
i 17
start 17
to 17
get 17
up 17
and 17
then 17
realize 17
they 17
plan 17
to 17
roll 17
my 17
hospital 17
bed 17
directly 17
there 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
walk 17
but 17
thats 17
out 17
so 17
i 17
negotiate 17
my 17
way 17
into 17
a 17
wheelchair 17
i 17
feel 17
fine 17
really 17
except 17
for 17
my 17
head 17
and 17
my 17
leg 17
and 17
the 17
soreness 17
from 17
the 17
bruises 17
and 17
the 17
nausea 17
that 17
hit 17
a 17
couple 17
minutes 17
after 17
i 17
ate 17
maybe 17
the 17
wheelchairs 17
a 17
good 17
idea 17
as 17
they 17
wheel 17
me 17
down 17
i 17
begin 17
to 17
get 17
uneasy 17
about 17
what 17
i 17
will 17
face 17
gale 17
and 17
i 17
directly 17
disobeyed 17
orders 17
yesterday 17
and 17
boggs 17
has 17
the 17
injury 17
to 17
prove 17
it 17
surely 17
there 17
will 17
be 17
repercussions 17
but 17
will 17
they 17
go 17
so 17
far 17
as 17
coin 17
annulling 17
our 17
agreement 17
for 17
the 17
victors 17
immunity 17
have 17
i 17
stripped 17
peeta 17
of 17
what 17
little 17
protection 17
i 17
could 17
give 17
him 17
when 17
i 17
get 17
to 17
command 17
the 17
only 17
ones 17
whove 17
arrived 17
are 17
cressida 17
messalla 17
and 17
the 17
insects 17
messalla 17
beams 17
and 17
says 17
theres 17
our 17
little 17
star 17
and 17
the 17
others 17
are 17
smiling 17
so 17
genuinely 17
that 17
i 17
cant 17
help 17
but 17
smile 17
in 17
return 17
they 17
impressed 17
me 17
in 17
following 17
me 17
onto 17
the 17
roof 17
during 17
the 17
bombing 17
making 17
plutarch 17
back 17
off 17
so 17
they 17
could 17
get 17
the 17
footage 17
they 17
wanted 17
they 17
more 17
than 17
do 17
their 17
work 17
they 17
take 17
pride 17
in 17
it 17
like 17
cinna 17
i 17
have 17
a 17
strange 17
thought 17
that 17
if 17
we 17
were 17
in 17
the 17
arena 17
together 17
i 17
would 17
pick 17
them 17
as 17
allies 17
cressida 17
messalla 17
andandi 17
have 17
to 17
stop 17
calling 17
you 17
the 17
insects 17
i 17
blurt 17
out 17
to 17
the 17
cameramen 17
i 17
explain 17
how 17
i 17
didnt 17
know 17
their 17
names 17
but 17
their 17
suits 17
suggested 17
the 17
shelled 17
creatures 17
the 17
comparison 17
doesnt 17
seem 17
to 17
bother 17
them 17
even 17
without 17
the 17
camera 17
shells 17
they 17
strongly 17
resemble 17
each 17
other 17
same 17
sandy 17
hair 17
red 17
beards 17
and 17
blue 17
eyes 17
the 17
one 17
with 17
closebitten 17
nails 17
introduces 17
himself 17
as 17
castor 17
and 17
the 17
other 17
whos 17
his 17
brother 17
as 17
pollux 17
i 17
wait 17
for 17
pollux 17
to 17
say 17
hello 17
but 17
he 17
just 17
nods 17
at 17
first 17
i 17
think 17
hes 17
shy 17
or 17
a 17
man 17
of 17
few 17
words 17
but 17
something 17
tugs 17
on 17
methe 17
position 17
of 17
his 17
lips 17
the 17
extra 17
effort 17
he 17
takes 17
to 17
swallowand 17
i 17
know 17
before 17
castor 17
tells 17
me 17
pollux 17
is 17
an 17
avox 17
they 17
have 17
cut 17
out 17
his 17
tongue 17
and 17
he 17
will 17
never 17
speak 17
again 17
and 17
i 17
no 17
longer 17
have 17
to 17
wonder 17
what 17
made 17
him 17
risk 17
everything 17
to 17
help 17
bring 17
down 17
the 17
capitol 17
as 17
the 17
room 17
fills 17
i 17
brace 17
myself 17
for 17
a 17
less 17
congenial 17
reception 17
but 17
the 17
only 17
people 17
who 17
register 17
any 17
kind 17
of 17
negativity 17
are 17
haymitch 17
whos 17
always 17
out 17
of 17
sorts 17
and 17
a 17
sourfaced 17
fulvia 17
cardew 17
boggs 17
wears 17
a 17
fleshcolored 17
plastic 17
mask 17
from 17
his 17
upper 17
lip 17
to 17
his 17
browi 17
was 17
right 17
about 17
the 17
broken 17
noseso 17
his 17
expressions 17
hard 17
to 17
read 17
coin 17
and 17
gale 17
are 17
in 17
the 17
midst 17
of 17
some 17
exchange 17
that 17
seems 17
positively 17
chummy 17
when 17
gale 17
slides 17
into 17
the 17
seat 17
next 17
to 17
my 17
wheelchair 17
i 17
say 17
making 17
new 17
friends 17
his 17
eyes 17
flicker 17
to 17
the 17
president 17
and 17
back 17
well 17
one 17
of 17
us 17
has 17
to 17
be 17
accessible 17
he 17
touches 17
my 17
temple 17
gently 17
how 17
do 17
you 17
feel 17
they 17
must 17
have 17
served 17
stewed 17
garlic 17
and 17
squash 17
for 17
the 17
breakfast 17
vegetable 17
the 17
more 17
people 17
who 17
gather 17
the 17
stronger 17
the 17
fumes 17
are 17
my 17
stomach 17
turns 17
and 17
the 17
lights 17
suddenly 17
seem 17
too 17
bright 17
kind 17
of 17
rocky 17
i 17
say 17
how 17
are 17
you 17
fine 17
they 17
dug 17
out 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
pieces 17
of 17
shrapnel 17
no 17
big 17
deal 17
he 17
says 17
coin 17
calls 17
the 17
meeting 17
to 17
order 17
our 17

usable 17
footage 17
theyve 17
already 17
slapped 17
together 17
a 17
propo 17
and 17
aired 17
it 17
repeatedly 17
my 17
palms 17
grow 17
moist 17
in 17
anticipation 17
of 17
seeing 17
myself 17
on 17
television 17
what 17
if 17
im 17
still 17
awful 17
what 17
if 17
im 17
as 17
stiff 17
and 17
pointless 17
as 17
i 17
was 17
in 17
the 17
studio 17
and 17
theyve 17
just 17
given 17
up 17
on 17
getting 17
anything 17
better 17
individual 17
screens 17
slide 17
up 17
from 17
the 17
table 17
the 17
lights 17
dim 17
slightly 17
and 17
a 17
hush 17
falls 17
over 17
the 17
room 17
at 17
first 17
my 17
screen 17
is 17
black 17
then 17
a 17
tiny 17
spark 17
flickers 17
in 17
the 17
center 17
it 17
blossoms 17
spreads 17
silently 17
eating 17
up 17
the 17
blackness 17
until 17
the 17
entire 17
frame 17
is 17
ablaze 17
with 17
a 17
fire 17
so 17
real 17
and 17
intense 17
i 17
imagine 17
i 17
feel 17
the 17
heat 17
emanating 17
from 17
it 17
the 17
image 17
of 17
my 17
mockingjay 17
pin 17
emerges 17
glowing 17
redgold 17
the 17
deep 17
resonant 17
voice 17
that 17
haunts 17
my 17
dreams 17
begins 17
to 17
speak 17
claudius 17
templesmith 17
the 17
official 17
announcer 17
of 17

the 17
girl 17
who 17
was 17
on 17
fire 17
burns 17
on 17
suddenly 17
there 17
i 17
am 17
replacing 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
standing 17
before 17
the 17
real 17
flames 17
and 17
smoke 17
of 17
district 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
tell 17
the 17
rebels 17
that 17
i 17
am 17
alive 17
that 17
im 17
right 17
here 17
in 17
district 17
eight 17
where 17
the 17
capitol 17
has 17
just 17
bombed 17
a 17
hospital 17
full 17
of 17
unarmed 17
men 17
women 17
and 17
children 17
there 17
will 17
be 17
no 17
survivors 17
cut 17
to 17
the 17
hospital 17
collapsing 17
in 17
on 17
itself 17
the 17
desperation 17
of 17
the 17
onlookers 17
as 17
i 17
continue 17
in 17
voiceover 17
i 17
want 17
to 17
tell 17
people 17
that 17
if 17
you 17
think 17
for 17
one 17
second 17
the 17
capitol 17
will 17
treat 17
us 17
fairly 17
if 17
theres 17
a 17
ceasefire 17
youre 17
deluding 17
yourself 17
because 17
you 17
know 17
who 17
they 17
are 17
and 17
what 17
they 17
do 17
back 17
to 17
me 17
now 17
my 17
hands 17
lifting 17
up 17
to 17
indicate 17
the 17
outrage 17
around 17
me 17
this 17
is 17
what 17
they 17
do 17
and 17
we 17
must 17
fight 17
back 17
now 17
comes 17
a 17
truly 17
fantastic 17
montage 17
of 17
the 17
battle 17
the 17
initial 17
bombs 17
falling 17
us 17
running 17
being 17

the 17
roof 17
diving 17
into 17
the 17

amazing 17
shots 17
of 17

our 17
districts 17

that 17

with 17
the 17
camera 17
tracking 17

melts 17
back 17
into 17
the 17
image 17
of 17
my 17
face 17
shouting 17
at 17
the 17
president 17

fire 17
and 17
the 17
whole 17
screen 17
burns 17
to 17
blackness 17
theres 17
a 17
moment 17
of 17
silent 17
relish 17
then 17
applause 17
followed 17
by 17
demands 17
to 17
see 17
it 17
again 17

by 17
the 17
time 17

to 17
black 17
a 17
second 17

they 17
see 17
it 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
not 17
in 17
the 17
capitol 17
says 17
plutarch 17
we 17
couldnt 17
override 17
their 17
system 17
although 17
beetees 17
working 17
on 17
it 17
but 17
in 17
all 17
the 17
districts 17
we 17
even 17
got 17
it 17
on 17
in 17
two 17
which 17
may 17
be 17
more 17
valuable 17
than 17
the 17
capitol 17
at 17
this 17
point 17
in 17
the 17
game 17
is 17
claudius 17
templesmith 17
with 17
us 17
i 17
ask 17
this 17
gives 17
plutarch 17
a 17
good 17
laugh 17
only 17
his 17
voice 17
but 17
thats 17
ours 17
for 17
the 17
taking 17
we 17
didnt 17
even 17
have 17
to 17
do 17
any 17
special 17
editing 17
he 17
said 17
that 17
actual 17
line 17
in 17
your 17
first 17
games 17
he 17
slaps 17
his 17
hand 17
on 17
the 17
table 17
what 17
say 17
we 17
give 17
another 17
round 17
of 17
applause 17
to 17
cressida 17
her 17
amazing 17
team 17
and 17
of 17
course 17
our 17
oncamera 17
talent 17
i 17
clap 17
too 17
until 17
i 17
realize 17
im 17
the 17
oncamera 17
talent 17
and 17
maybe 17
its 17
obnoxious 17
that 17
im 17
applauding 17
for 17
myself 17
but 17
no 17
ones 17
paying 17
attention 17
i 17
cant 17
help 17
noticing 17
the 17
strain 17
on 17
fulvias 17
face 17
though 17
i 17
think 17
how 17
hard 17
this 17
must 17
be 17
for 17
her 17
watching 17
haymitchs 17
idea 17
succeed 17
under 17
cressidas 17
direction 17
when 17
fulvias 17
studio 17
approach 17
was 17
such 17
a 17
flop 17
coin 17
seems 17
to 17
have 17
reached 17
the 17
end 17
of 17
her 17
tolerance 17
for 17
selfcongratulation 17
yes 17
well 17
deserved 17
the 17
result 17
is 17
more 17
than 17
we 17
had 17
hoped 17
for 17
but 17
i 17
do 17
have 17
to 17
question 17
the 17
wide 17
margin 17
of 17
risk 17
that 17
you 17
were 17
willing 17
to 17
operate 17
within 17
i 17
know 17
the 17
raid 17
was 17
unforeseen 17
however 17
given 17
the 17
circumstances 17
i 17
think 17
we 17
should 17
discuss 17
the 17
decision 17
to 17
send 17
katniss 17
into 17
actual 17
combat 17
the 17
decision 17
to 17
send 17
me 17
into 17
combat 17
then 17
she 17
doesnt 17
know 17
that 17
i 17
flagrantly 17
disregarded 17
orders 17
ripped 17
out 17
my 17
earpiece 17
and 17
gave 17
my 17
bodyguards 17
the 17
slip 17
what 17
else 17
have 17
they 17
kept 17
from 17
her 17
it 17
was 17
a 17
tough 17
call 17
says 17
plutarch 17
furrowing 17
his 17
brow 17
but 17
the 17
general 17
consensus 17
was 17
that 17
we 17
werent 17
going 17
to 17
get 17
anything 17
worth 17
using 17
if 17
we 17
locked 17
her 17
in 17
a 17
bunker 17
somewhere 17
every 17
time 17
a 17
gun 17
went 17
off 17
and 17
youre 17
all 17
right 17
with 17
that 17
asks 17
the 17
president 17
gale 17
has 17
to 17
kick 17
me 17
under 17
the 17
table 17
before 17
i 17
realize 17
that 17
shes 17
talking 17
to 17
me 17
oh 17
yeah 17
im 17
completely 17
all 17
right 17
with 17
that 17
it 17
felt 17
good 17
doing 17
something 17
for 17
a 17
change 17
well 17
lets 17
be 17
just 17
a 17
little 17
more 17
judicious 17
with 17
her 17
exposure 17
especially 17
now 17
that 17
the 17
capitol 17
knows 17
what 17
she 17
can 17
do 17
says 17
coin 17
theres 17
a 17
rumble 17
of 17
assent 17
from 17
around 17
the 17
table 17
no 17
one 17
has 17
ratted 17
out 17
gale 17
and 17
me 17
not 17
plutarch 17
whose 17
authority 17
we 17
ignored 17
not 17
boggs 17
with 17
his 17
broken 17
nose 17
not 17
the 17
insects 17
we 17
led 17
into 17
fire 17
not 17
haymitchno 17
wait 17
a 17
minute 17
haymitch 17
is 17
giving 17
me 17
a 17
deadly 17
smile 17
and 17
saying 17
sweetly 17
yeah 17
we 17
wouldnt 17
want 17
to 17
lose 17
our 17
little 17
mockingjay 17
when 17
shes 17
finally 17
begun 17
to 17
sing 17
i 17
make 17
a 17
note 17
to 17
myself 17
not 17
to 17
end 17
up 17
alone 17
in 17
a 17
room 17
with 17
him 17
because 17
hes 17
clearly 17
having 17
vengeful 17
thoughts 17
over 17
that 17
stupid 17
earpiece 17
so 17
what 17
else 17
do 17
you 17
have 17
planned 17
asks 17
the 17
president 17
plutarch 17
nods 17
to 17
cressida 17
who 17
consults 17
a 17
clipboard 17
we 17
have 17
some 17
terrific 17
footage 17
of 17
katniss 17
at 17
the 17
hospital 17
in 17
eight 17
there 17
should 17
be 17
another 17
propo 17
in 17
that 17
with 17
the 17
theme 17
because 17
you 17
know 17
who 17
they 17
are 17
and 17
what 17
they 17
do 17
well 17
focus 17
on 17
katniss 17
interacting 17
with 17
the 17
patients 17
particularly 17
the 17
children 17
the 17
bombing 17
of 17
the 17
hospital 17
and 17
the 17
wreckage 17
messallas 17
cutting 17
that 17
together 17
were 17
also 17
thinking 17
about 17
a 17
mockingjay 17
piece 17
highlight 17
some 17
of 17
katnisss 17
best 17
moments 17
intercut 17
with 17
scenes 17
of 17
rebel 17
uprisings 17
and 17
war 17
footage 17
we 17
call 17
that 17
one 17
fire 17
is 17
catching 17
and 17
then 17
fulvia 17
came 17
up 17
with 17
a 17
really 17
brilliant 17
idea 17
fulvias 17
mouthfulofsourgrapes 17
expression 17
is 17
startled 17
right 17
off 17
her 17
face 17
but 17
she 17
recovers 17
well 17
i 17
dont 17
know 17
how 17
brilliant 17
it 17
is 17
but 17
i 17
was 17
thinking 17
we 17
could 17
do 17
a 17
series 17
of 17
propos 17
called 17
we 17
remember 17
in 17
each 17
one 17
we 17
would 17
feature 17
one 17
of 17
the 17
dead 17
tributes 17
little 17
rue 17
from 17
eleven 17
or 17
old 17
mags 17
from 17
four 17
the 17
idea 17
being 17
that 17
we 17
could 17
target 17
each 17
district 17
with 17
a 17
very 17
personal 17
piece 17
a 17
tribute 17
to 17
your 17
tributes 17
as 17
it 17
were 17
says 17
plutarch 17
that 17
is 17
brilliant 17
fulvia 17
i 17
say 17
sincerely 17
its 17
the 17
perfect 17
way 17
to 17
remind 17
people 17
why 17
theyre 17
fighting 17
i 17
think 17
it 17
could 17
work 17
she 17
says 17
i 17
thought 17
we 17
might 17
use 17
finnick 17
to 17
intro 17
and 17
narrate 17
the 17
spots 17
if 17
there 17
was 17
interest 17
in 17
them 17
frankly 17
i 17
dont 17
see 17
how 17
we 17
could 17
have 17
too 17
many 17
we 17
remember 17
propos 17
says 17
coin 17
can 17
you 17
start 17
producing 17
them 17
today 17
of 17
course 17
says 17
fulvia 17
obviously 17
mollified 17
by 17
the 17
response 17
to 17
her 17
idea 17
cressida 17
has 17
smoothed 17
everything 17
over 17
in 17
the 17
creative 17
department 17
with 17
her 17
gesture 17
praised 17
fulvia 17
for 17
what 17
is 17
in 17
fact 17
a 17
really 17
good 17
idea 17
and 17
cleared 17
the 17
way 17
to 17
continue 17
her 17
own 17
onair 17
depiction 17
of 17
the 17
mockingjay 17
whats 17
interesting 17
is 17
that 17
plutarch 17
seems 17
to 17
have 17
no 17
need 17
to 17
share 17
in 17
the 17
credit 17
all 17
he 17
wants 17
is 17
for 17
the 17
airtime 17
assault 17
to 17
work 17
i 17
remember 17
that 17
plutarch 17
is 17
a 17
head 17
gamemaker 17
not 17
a 17
member 17
of 17
the 17
crew 17
not 17
a 17
piece 17
in 17
the 17
games 17
therefore 17
his 17
worth 17
is 17
not 17
defined 17
by 17
a 17
single 17
element 17
but 17
by 17
the 17
overall 17
success 17
of 17
the 17
production 17
if 17
we 17
win 17
the 17
war 17
thats 17
when 17
plutarch 17
will 17
take 17
his 17
bow 17
and 17
expect 17
his 17
reward 17
the 17
president 17
sends 17
everyone 17
off 17
to 17
get 17
to 17
work 17
so 17
gale 17
wheels 17
me 17
back 17
to 17
the 17
hospital 17
we 17
laugh 17
a 17
little 17
about 17
the 17
coverup 17
gale 17
says 17
no 17
one 17
wanted 17
to 17
look 17
bad 17
by 17
admitting 17
they 17
couldnt 17
control 17
us 17
im 17
kinder 17
saying 17
they 17
probably 17
didnt 17
want 17
to 17
jeopardize 17
the 17
chance 17
of 17
taking 17
us 17
out 17
again 17
now 17
that 17
theyve 17
gotten 17
some 17
decent 17
footage 17
both 17
things 17
are 17
probably 17
true 17
gale 17
has 17
to 17
go 17
meet 17
beetee 17
down 17
in 17
special 17
weaponry 17
so 17
i 17
doze 17
off 17
it 17
seems 17
like 17
ive 17
only 17
shut 17
my 17
eyes 17
for 17
a 17
few 17
minutes 17
but 17
when 17
i 17
open 17
them 17
i 17
flinch 17
at 17
the 17
sight 17
of 17
haymitch 17
sitting 17
a 17
couple 17
of 17
feet 17
from 17
my 17
bed 17
waiting 17
possibly 17
for 17
several 17
hours 17
if 17
the 17
clock 17
is 17
right 17
i 17
think 17
about 17
hollering 17
for 17
a 17
witness 17
but 17
im 17
going 17
to 17
have 17
to 17
face 17
him 17
sooner 17
or 17
later 17
haymitch 17
leans 17
forward 17
and 17
dangles 17
something 17
on 17
a 17
thin 17
white 17
wire 17
in 17
front 17
of 17
my 17
nose 17
its 17
hard 17
to 17
focus 17
on 17
but 17
im 17
pretty 17
sure 17
what 17
it 17
is 17
he 17
drops 17
it 17
to 17
the 17
sheets 17
that 17
is 17
your 17
earpiece 17
i 17
will 17
give 17
you 17
exactly 17
one 17
more 17
chance 17
to 17
wear 17
it 17
if 17
you 17
remove 17
it 17
from 17
your 17
ear 17
again 17
ill 17
have 17
you 17
fitted 17
with 17
this 17
he 17
holds 17
up 17
some 17
sort 17
of 17
metal 17
headgear 17
that 17
i 17
instantly 17
name 17
the 17
head 17
shackle 17
its 17
an 17
alternative 17
audio 17
unit 17
that 17
locks 17
around 17
your 17
skull 17
and 17
under 17
your 17
chin 17
until 17
its 17
opened 17
with 17
a 17
key 17
and 17
ill 17
have 17
the 17
only 17
key 17
if 17
for 17
some 17
reason 17
youre 17
clever 17
enough 17
to 17
disable 17
ithaymitch 17
dumps 17
the 17
head 17
shackle 17
on 17
the 17
bed 17
and 17
whips 17
out 17
a 17
tiny 17
silver 17
chipill 17
authorize 17
them 17
to 17
surgically 17
implant 17
this 17
transmitter 17
into 17
your 17
ear 17
so 17
that 17
i 17
may 17
speak 17
to 17
you 17
twentyfour 17
hours 17
a 17
day 17
haymitch 17
in 17
my 17
head 17
fulltime 17
horrifying 17
ill 17
keep 17
the 17
earpiece 17
in 17
i 17

he 17
says 17

keep 17
the 17

happy 17
with 17
any 17
of 17
the 17

back 17
in 17
his 17
face 17
with 17
my 17
free 17
hand 17
but 17
he 17
catches 17
it 17
easily 17
probably 17
was 17
expecting 17

images 17
from 17
yesterday 17

to 17
flood 17
into 17
the 17
present 17
the 17
bombing 17
the 17
fiery 17
plane 17
crashes 17
the 17
faces 17
of 17
the 17
wounded 17
who 17
no 17
longer 17

i 17
imagine 17
death 17
from 17
all 17
sides 17
the 17
last 17
moment 17
before 17
seeing 17
a 17
shell 17
hit 17
the 17
ground 17
feeling 17
the 17
wing 17
blown 17
from 17
my 17
plane 17
and 17
the 17
dizzying 17
nosedive 17
into 17
oblivion 17
the 17
warehouse 17
roof 17
falling 17
down 17
at 17
me 17
while 17

helplessly 17
to 17
my 17
cot 17
things 17

basically 17
lives 17
in 17
the 17
hospital 17

fifteen 17
pounds 17

a 17
nervous 17
tremor 17
in 17
his 17
hands 17
theyve 17
still 17
got 17
him 17
groomed 17
but 17
underneath 17
the 17
paint 17
that 17
cannot 17
cover 17
the 17
bags 17
under 17
his 17
eyes 17
and 17
the 17
fine 17
clothes 17
that 17
cannot 17
conceal 17
the 17
pain 17
he 17
feels 17
when 17
he 17
moves 17
is 17
a 17
person 17
badly 17
damaged 17
my 17
mind 17
reels 17
trying 17
to 17
make 17
sense 17
of 17
it 17
i 17
just 17
saw 17
him 17

five 17
days 17
ago 17
how 17
has 17
he 17
deteriorated 17
so 17
rapidly 17
what 17
could 17
they 17
possibly 17
have 17
done 17
to 17
him 17
in 17
such 17
a 17
short 17
time 17
then 17
it 17
hits 17
me 17
i 17
replay 17
in 17
my 17
mind 17
as 17
much 17
as 17
i 17
can 17
of 17
his 17
first 17

for 17
anything 17
that 17
would 17
place 17
it 17
in 17
time 17
there 17
is 17
nothing 17
they 17
could 17
have 17
taped 17
that 17
interview 17
a 17
day 17
or 17
two 17
after 17

a 18
second 18
sleepless 18
night 18
clutching 18
it 18
in 18
my 18
hand 18
replaying 18
peetas 18
words 18
in 18
my 18
head 18
ask 18

know 18
anything 18
except 18
what 18
the 18
capitol 18
tells 18
him 18
its 18
just 18
a 18
capitol 18
propo 18
more 18
noise 18
but 18
if 18
plutarch 18
thinks 18
its 18
just 18
the 18
capitol 18
line 18
why 18
didnt 18
he 18
tell 18
me 18
about 18
it 18
why 18
hasnt 18
anyone 18
let 18
me 18
or 18
finnick 18
know 18
under 18
this 18
debate 18
lies 18
the 18
real 18
source 18
of 18
my 18
distress 18
peeta 18
what 18
have 18
they 18
done 18
to 18
him 18
and 18
what 18
are 18
they 18
doing 18
to 18
him 18
right 18
now 18
clearly 18
snow 18
did 18
not 18
buy 18
the 18
story 18
that 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
knew 18
nothing 18
about 18
the 18
rebellion 18
and 18
his 18
suspicions 18
have 18
been 18
reinforced 18
now 18
that 18
i 18
have 18
come 18
out 18
as 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
peeta 18
can 18
only 18
guess 18
about 18
the 18
rebel 18
tactics 18
or 18
make 18
up 18
things 18
to 18
tell 18
his 18
torturers 18
lies 18
once 18
discovered 18
would 18
be 18
severely 18
punished 18
how 18
abandoned 18
by 18
me 18
he 18
must 18
feel 18
in 18
his 18
first 18
interview 18
he 18
tried 18
to 18
protect 18
me 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
rebels 18
alike 18
and 18
not 18
only 18
have 18
i 18
failed 18
to 18
protect 18
him 18
ive 18
brought 18
down 18
more 18
horrors 18
upon 18
him 18
come 18
morning 18
i 18
stick 18
my 18
forearm 18
in 18
the 18
wall 18
and 18
stare 18
groggily 18
at 18
the 18
days 18
schedule 18
immediately 18
after 18
breakfast 18
i 18
am 18
slated 18
for 18
production 18
in 18
the 18
dining 18
hall 18
as 18
i 18
down 18
my 18
hot 18
grain 18
and 18
milk 18
and 18
mushy 18
beets 18
i 18
spot 18
a 18
communicuff 18
on 18
gales 18
wrist 18
when 18
did 18
you 18
get 18
that 18
back 18
soldier 18
hawthorne 18
i 18
ask 18
yesterday 18
they 18
thought 18
if 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
be 18
in 18
the 18
field 18
with 18
you 18
it 18
could 18
be 18
a 18
backup 18
system 18
of 18
communication 18
says 18
gale 18
no 18
one 18
has 18
ever 18
offered 18
me 18
a 18
communicuff 18
i 18
wonder 18
if 18
i 18
asked 18
for 18
one 18
would 18
i 18
get 18
it 18
well 18
i 18
guess 18
one 18
of 18
us 18
has 18
to 18
be 18
accessible 18
i 18
say 18
with 18
an 18
edge 18
to 18
my 18
voice 18
whats 18
that 18
mean 18
he 18
says 18
nothing 18
just 18
repeating 18
what 18
you 18
said 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
and 18
i 18
totally 18
agree 18
that 18
the 18
accessible 18
one 18
should 18
be 18
you 18
i 18
just 18
hope 18
i 18
still 18
have 18
access 18
to 18
you 18
as 18
well 18
our 18
eyes 18
lock 18
and 18
i 18
realize 18
how 18
furious 18
i 18
am 18
with 18
gale 18
that 18
i 18
dont 18
believe 18
for 18
a 18
second 18
that 18
he 18
didnt 18
see 18
peetas 18
propo 18
that 18
i 18
feel 18
completely 18
betrayed 18
that 18
he 18
didnt 18
tell 18
me 18
about 18
it 18
we 18
know 18
each 18
other 18
too 18
well 18
for 18
him 18
not 18
to 18
read 18
my 18
mood 18
and 18
guess 18
what 18
has 18
caused 18
it 18
katniss 18
he 18
begins 18
already 18
the 18
admission 18
of 18
guilt 18
is 18
in 18
his 18
tone 18
i 18
grab 18
my 18
tray 18
cross 18
to 18
the 18
deposit 18
area 18
and 18
slam 18
the 18
dishes 18
onto 18
the 18
rack 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
im 18
in 18
the 18
hallway 18
hes 18
caught 18
up 18
with 18
me 18
why 18
didnt 18
you 18
say 18
something 18
he 18
asks 18
taking 18
my 18
arm 18
why 18
didnt 18
i 18
i 18
jerk 18
my 18
arm 18
free 18
why 18
didnt 18
you 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
did 18
by 18
the 18
way 18
when 18
i 18
asked 18
you 18
last 18
night 18
about 18
what 18
had 18
been 18
going 18
on 18
im 18
sorry 18
all 18
right 18
i 18
didnt 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
i 18
wanted 18
to 18
tell 18
you 18
but 18
everyone 18
was 18
afraid 18
that 18
seeing 18
peetas 18
propo 18
would 18
make 18
you 18
sick 18
he 18
says 18
they 18
were 18
right 18
it 18
did 18
but 18
not 18
quite 18
as 18
sick 18
as 18
you 18
lying 18
to 18
me 18
for 18
coin 18
at 18
that 18
moment 18
his 18
communicuff 18
starts 18
beeping 18
there 18
she 18
is 18
better 18
run 18
you 18
have 18
things 18
to 18
tell 18
her 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
real 18
hurt 18
registers 18
on 18
his 18
face 18
then 18
cold 18
anger 18
replaces 18
it 18
he 18
turns 18
on 18
his 18
heel 18
and 18
goes 18
maybe 18
i 18
have 18
been 18
too 18
spiteful 18
not 18
given 18
him 18
enough 18
time 18
to 18
explain 18
maybe 18
everyone 18
is 18
just 18
trying 18
to 18
protect 18
me 18
by 18
lying 18
to 18
me 18
i 18
dont 18
care 18
im 18
sick 18
of 18
people 18
lying 18
to 18
me 18
for 18
my 18
own 18
good 18
because 18
really 18
its 18
mostly 18
for 18
their 18
own 18
good 18
lie 18
to 18
katniss 18
about 18
the 18
rebellion 18
so 18
she 18
doesnt 18
do 18
anything 18
crazy 18
send 18
her 18
into 18
the 18
arena 18
without 18
a 18
clue 18
so 18
we 18
can 18
fish 18
her 18
out 18
dont 18
tell 18
her 18
about 18
peetas 18
propo 18
because 18
it 18
might 18
make 18
her 18
sick 18
and 18
its 18
hard 18
enough 18
to 18
get 18
a 18
decent 18
performance 18
out 18
of 18
her 18
as 18
it 18
is 18
i 18
do 18
feel 18
sick 18
heartsick 18
and 18
too 18
tired 18
for 18
a 18
day 18
of 18
production 18
but 18
im 18
already 18
at 18
remake 18
so 18
i 18
go 18
in 18
today 18
i 18
discover 18
we 18
will 18
be 18
returning 18
to 18
district 18
cressida 18
wants 18
to 18
do 18
unscripted 18
interviews 18
with 18
gale 18
and 18
me 18
throwing 18
light 18
on 18
our 18
demolished 18
city 18
if 18
youre 18
both 18
up 18
for 18
that 18
says 18
cressida 18
looking 18
closely 18
at 18
my 18
face 18
count 18
me 18
in 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
stand 18
uncommunicative 18
and 18
stiff 18
a 18
mannequin 18
as 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
dresses 18
me 18
does 18
my 18
hair 18
and 18
dabs 18
makeup 18
on 18
my 18
face 18
not 18
enough 18
to 18
show 18
only 18
enough 18
to 18
take 18
the 18
edge 18
off 18
the 18
circles 18
under 18
my 18
sleepless 18
eyes 18
boggs 18
escorts 18
me 18
down 18
to 18
the 18
hangar 18
but 18
we 18
dont 18
talk 18
beyond 18
a 18
preliminary 18
greeting 18
im 18
grateful 18
to 18
be 18
spared 18
another 18
exchange 18
about 18
my 18
disobedience 18
in 18
especially 18
since 18
his 18
mask 18
looks 18
so 18
uncomfortable 18
at 18
the 18
last 18
moment 18
i 18
remember 18
to 18
send 18
a 18
message 18
to 18
my 18
mother 18
about 18
my 18
leaving 18
and 18
stress 18
that 18
it 18
wont 18
be 18
dangerous 18
we 18
board 18
a 18
hovercraft 18
for 18
the 18
short 18
ride 18
to 18
and 18
im 18
directed 18
to 18
a 18
seat 18
at 18
a 18
table 18
where 18
plutarch 18
gale 18
and 18
cressida 18
are 18
poring 18
over 18
a 18
map 18
plutarchs 18
brimming 18
with 18
satisfaction 18
as 18
he 18
shows 18
me 18
the 18
beforeafter 18
effects 18
of 18
the 18
first 18
couple 18
of 18
propos 18
the 18
rebels 18
who 18
were 18
barely 18
maintaining 18
a 18
foothold 18
in 18
several 18
districts 18
have 18
rallied 18
they 18
have 18
actually 18
taken 18
and 18
the 18
latter 18
so 18
crucial 18
since 18
its 18
panems 18
main 18
food 18
supplierand 18
have 18
made 18
inroads 18
in 18
several 18
other 18
districts 18
as 18
well 18
hopeful 18
very 18
hopeful 18
indeed 18
says 18
plutarch 18
fulvias 18
going 18
to 18
have 18
the 18
first 18
round 18
of 18
we 18
remember 18
spots 18
ready 18
tonight 18
so 18
we 18
can 18
target 18
the 18
individual 18
districts 18
with 18
their 18
dead 18
finnicks 18
absolutely 18
marvelous 18
its 18
painful 18
to 18
watch 18
actually 18
says 18
cressida 18
he 18
knew 18
so 18
many 18
of 18
them 18
personally 18
thats 18
what 18
makes 18
it 18
so 18
effective 18
says 18
plutarch 18
straight 18
from 18
the 18
heart 18
youre 18
all 18
doing 18
beautifully 18
coin 18
could 18
not 18
be 18
more 18
pleased 18
gale 18
didnt 18
tell 18
them 18
then 18
about 18
my 18
pretending 18
not 18
to 18
see 18
peeta 18
and 18
my 18
anger 18
at 18
their 18
coverup 18
but 18
i 18
guess 18
its 18
too 18
little 18
too 18
late 18
because 18
i 18
still 18
cant 18
let 18
it 18
go 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
hes 18
not 18
speaking 18
to 18
me 18
either 18
its 18
not 18
until 18
we 18
land 18
in 18
the 18
meadow 18
that 18
i 18
realize 18
haymitch 18
isnt 18
among 18
our 18
company 18
when 18
i 18
ask 18
plutarch 18
about 18
his 18
absence 18
he 18
just 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
and 18
says 18
he 18
couldnt 18
face 18
it 18
haymitch 18
not 18
able 18
to 18
face 18
something 18
wanted 18
a 18
day 18
off 18
more 18
likely 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
think 18
his 18
actual 18
words 18
were 18
i 18
couldnt 18
face 18
it 18
without 18
a 18
bottle 18
says 18
plutarch 18
i 18
roll 18
my 18
eyes 18
long 18
out 18
of 18
patience 18
with 18
my 18
mentor 18
his 18
weakness 18
for 18
drink 18
and 18
what 18
he 18
can 18
or 18
cant 18
confront 18
but 18
about 18
five 18
minutes 18
after 18
my 18
return 18
to 18
im 18
wishing 18
i 18
had 18
a 18
bottle 18
myself 18
i 18
thought 18
id 18
come 18
to 18

from 18
the 18
air 18
and 18
wandered 18
through 18
its 18
ashes 18
so 18
why 18
does 18
everything 18
bring 18
on 18
a 18
fresh 18
pang 18
of 18
grief 18

too 18
out 18

too 18
many 18

while 18

easily 18
at 18
his 18
old 18
address 18
cressida 18
films 18
him 18
in 18
silence 18
for 18
a 18
few 18
minutes 18
but 18
just 18
as 18
he 18
pulls 18
the 18
one 18
remnant 18
of 18
his 18
previous 18
life 18
from 18
the 18
ashes 18
a 18
twisted 18
metal 18
pokershe 18
starts 18
to 18
question 18
him 18
about 18
his 18
family 18
his 18
job 18
life 18
in 18
the 18
seam 18
she 18
makes 18
him 18
go 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
night 18
of 18
the 18
firebombing 18
and 18
reenact 18
it 18
starting 18
at 18
his 18
house 18
working 18
his 18
way 18
down 18
across 18
the 18
meadow 18
and 18
through 18
the 18
woods 18
to 18
the 18
lake 18
i 18
straggle 18
behind 18
the 18
film 18
crew 18
and 18
the 18
bodyguards 18
feeling 18
their 18
presence 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
violation 18
of 18
my 18
beloved 18
woods 18
this 18
is 18
a 18
private 18
place 18
a 18
sanctuary 18
already 18
corrupted 18
by 18
the 18
capitols 18
evil 18
even 18
after 18
weve 18
left 18
behind 18
the 18
charred 18
stumps 18
near 18
the 18
fence 18
were 18
still 18
tripping 18
over 18
decomposing 18
bodies 18
do 18
we 18
have 18
to 18
record 18
it 18
for 18
everyone 18
to 18
see 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
we 18
reach 18
the 18
lake 18
gale 18
seems 18
to 18
have 18
lost 18
his 18
ability 18
to 18
speak 18
everyones 18
dripping 18
in 18
sweat 18
especially 18
castor 18
and 18
pollux 18
in 18
their 18
insect 18
shellsand 18
cressida 18
calls 18
for 18
a 18
break 18
i 18
scoop 18
up 18
handfuls 18
of 18
water 18
from 18
the 18
lake 18
wishing 18
i 18
could 18
dive 18
in 18
and 18
surface 18
alone 18
and 18
naked 18
and 18
unobserved 18
i 18
wander 18
around 18
the 18
perimeter 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
when 18
i 18
come 18
back 18
around 18
to 18
the 18
little 18
concrete 18
house 18
beside 18
the 18
lake 18
i 18
pause 18
in 18
the 18
doorway 18
and 18
see 18
gale 18
propping 18
the 18
crooked 18
poker 18
he 18
salvaged 18
against 18
the 18
wall 18
by 18
the 18
hearth 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
i 18
have 18
an 18
image 18
of 18
a 18
lone 18
stranger 18
sometime 18
far 18
in 18
the 18
future 18
wandering 18
lost 18
in 18
the 18
wilderness 18
and 18
coming 18
upon 18
this 18
small 18
place 18
of 18
refuge 18
with 18
the 18
pile 18
of 18
split 18
logs 18
the 18
hearth 18
the 18
poker 18
wondering 18
how 18
it 18
came 18
to 18
be 18
gale 18
turns 18
and 18
meets 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18
i 18
know 18
hes 18
thinking 18
about 18
our 18
last 18
meeting 18
here 18
when 18
we 18
fought 18
over 18
whether 18
or 18
not 18
to 18
run 18
away 18
if 18
we 18
had 18
would 18
district 18
still 18
be 18
there 18
i 18
think 18
it 18
would 18
but 18
the 18
capitol 18
would 18
still 18
be 18
in 18
control 18
of 18
panem 18
as 18
well 18
cheese 18
sandwiches 18
are 18
passed 18
around 18
and 18
we 18
eat 18
them 18
in 18
the 18
shade 18
of 18
the 18
trees 18
i 18
intentionally 18
sit 18
at 18
the 18
far 18
edge 18
of 18
the 18
group 18
next 18
to 18
pollux 18
so 18
i 18
dont 18
have 18
to 18
talk 18
no 18
ones 18
talking 18
much 18
really 18
in 18
the 18
relative 18
quiet 18
the 18
birds 18
take 18
back 18
the 18
woods 18
i 18
nudge 18
pollux 18
with 18
my 18
elbow 18
and 18
point 18
out 18
a 18
small 18
black 18
bird 18
with 18
a 18
crown 18
it 18
hops 18
to 18
a 18
new 18
branch 18
momentarily 18
opening 18
its 18
wings 18
showing 18
off 18
its 18
white 18
patches 18
pollux 18
gestures 18
to 18
my 18
pin 18
and 18
raises 18
his 18
eyebrows 18
questioningly 18
i 18
nod 18
confirming 18
its 18
a 18
mockingjay 18
i 18
hold 18
up 18
one 18
finger 18
to 18
say 18
wait 18
ill 18
show 18
you 18
and 18
whistle 18
a 18
birdcall 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
cocks 18
its 18
head 18
and 18
whistles 18
the 18
call 18
right 18
back 18
at 18
me 18
then 18
to 18
my 18
surprise 18
pollux 18
whistles 18
a 18
few 18
notes 18
of 18
his 18
own 18
the 18
bird 18
answers 18
him 18
immediately 18
polluxs 18
face 18
breaks 18
into 18
an 18
expression 18
of 18
delight 18
and 18
he 18
has 18
a 18
series 18
of 18
melodic 18
exchanges 18
with 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
my 18
guess 18
is 18
its 18
the 18
first 18
conversation 18
hes 18
had 18
in 18
years 18
music 18
draws 18
mockingjays 18
like 18
blossoms 18
do 18
bees 18
and 18
in 18
a 18
short 18
while 18
hes 18
got 18
half 18
a 18
dozen 18
of 18
them 18
perched 18
in 18
the 18
branches 18
over 18
our 18
heads 18
he 18
taps 18
me 18
on 18
the 18
arm 18
and 18
uses 18
a 18
twig 18
to 18
write 18
a 18
word 18
in 18
the 18
dirt 18
sing 18
usually 18
id 18
decline 18
but 18
its 18
kind 18
of 18
impossible 18
to 18
say 18
no 18
to 18
pollux 18
given 18
the 18
circumstances 18
besides 18
the 18
mockingjays 18
song 18
voices 18
are 18
different 18
from 18
their 18
whistles 18
and 18
id 18
like 18
him 18
to 18
hear 18
them 18
so 18
before 18
i 18
actually 18
think 18
about 18
what 18
im 18
doing 18
i 18
sing 18
rues 18
four 18
notes 18
the 18
ones 18
she 18
used 18
to 18
signal 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
workday 18
in 18
the 18
notes 18
that 18
ended 18
up 18
as 18
the 18
background 18
music 18
to 18
her 18
murder 18
the 18
birds 18
dont 18
know 18
that 18
they 18
pick 18
up 18
the 18
simple 18
phrase 18
and 18
bounce 18
it 18
back 18
and 18
forth 18
between 18
them 18
in 18
sweet 18
harmony 18
just 18
as 18
they 18
did 18
in 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
before 18
the 18
muttations 18
broke 18
through 18
the 18
trees 18
chased 18
us 18
onto 18
the 18
cornucopia 18
and 18
slowly 18
gnawed 18
cato 18
to 18
a 18
bloody 18
pulp 18
want 18
to 18
hear 18
them 18
do 18
a 18
real 18
song 18
i 18
burst 18
out 18
anything 18
to 18
stop 18
those 18
memories 18
im 18
on 18
my 18
feet 18
moving 18
back 18
into 18
the 18
trees 18
resting 18
my 18
hand 18
on 18
the 18
rough 18
trunk 18
of 18
a 18
maple 18
where 18
the 18
birds 18
perch 18
i 18
have 18
not 18
sung 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
out 18
loud 18
for 18
ten 18
years 18
because 18
its 18
forbidden 18
but 18
i 18
remember 18
every 18
word 18
i 18
begin 18
softly 18
sweetly 18
as 18
my 18
father 18
did 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
where 18
they 18
strung 18
up 18
a 18
man 18
they 18
say 18
murdered 18
three 18
strange 18
things 18
did 18
happen 18
here 18
no 18
stranger 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
if 18
we 18
met 18
up 18
at 18
midnight 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
the 18
mockingjays 18
begin 18
to 18
alter 18
their 18
songs 18
as 18
they 18
become 18
aware 18
of 18
my 18
new 18
offering 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
where 18
the 18
dead 18
man 18
called 18
out 18
for 18
his 18
love 18
to 18
flee 18
strange 18
things 18
did 18
happen 18
here 18
no 18
stranger 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
if 18
we 18
met 18
up 18
at 18
midnight 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
i 18
have 18
the 18
birds 18
attention 18
now 18
in 18
one 18
more 18
verse 18
surely 18
they 18
will 18
have 18
captured 18
the 18
melody 18
as 18
its 18
simple 18
and 18
repeats 18
four 18
times 18
with 18
little 18
variation 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
where 18
i 18
told 18
you 18
to 18
run 18
so 18
wed 18
both 18
be 18
free 18
strange 18
things 18
did 18
happen 18
here 18
no 18
stranger 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
if 18
we 18
met 18
up 18
at 18
midnight 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
a 18
hush 18
in 18
the 18
trees 18
just 18
the 18
rustle 18
of 18
leaves 18
in 18
the 18
breeze 18
but 18
no 18
birds 18
mockingjay 18
or 18
other 18
peetas 18
right 18
they 18
do 18
fall 18
silent 18
when 18
i 18
sing 18
just 18
as 18
they 18
did 18
for 18
my 18
father 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
wear 18
a 18
necklace 18
of 18
rope 18
side 18
by 18
side 18
with 18
me 18
strange 18
things 18
did 18
happen 18
here 18
no 18
stranger 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
if 18
we 18
met 18
up 18
at 18
midnight 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
the 18
birds 18
are 18
waiting 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
continue 18
but 18
thats 18
it 18
last 18
verse 18
in 18
the 18
stillness 18
i 18
remember 18
the 18
scene 18
i 18
was 18
home 18
from 18
a 18
day 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
with 18
my 18
father 18
sitting 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
with 18
prim 18
who 18
was 18
just 18
a 18
toddler 18
singing 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
making 18
us 18
necklaces 18
out 18
of 18
scraps 18
of 18
old 18
rope 18
like 18
it 18
said 18
in 18
the 18
song 18
not 18
knowing 18
the 18
real 18
meaning 18
of 18
the 18
words 18
the 18
tune 18
was 18
simple 18
and 18
easy 18
to 18
harmonize 18
to 18
though 18
and 18
back 18
then 18
i 18
could 18
memorize 18
almost 18
anything 18
set 18
to 18
music 18
after 18
a 18
round 18
or 18
two 18
suddenly 18
my 18
mother 18
snatched 18
the 18
rope 18
necklaces 18
away 18
and 18
was 18
yelling 18
at 18
my 18
father 18
i 18
started 18
to 18
cry 18
because 18
my 18
mother 18
never 18
yelled 18
and 18
then 18
prim 18
was 18
wailing 18
and 18
i 18
ran 18
outside 18
to 18
hide 18
as 18
i 18
had 18
exactly 18
one 18
hiding 18
spotin 18
the 18
meadow 18
under 18
a 18
honeysuckle 18
bushmy 18
father 18
found 18
me 18
immediately 18
he 18
calmed 18
me 18
down 18
and 18
told 18
me 18
everything 18
was 18
fine 18
only 18
wed 18
better 18
not 18
sing 18
that 18
song 18
anymore 18
my 18
mother 18
just 18
wanted 18
me 18
to 18
forget 18
it 18
so 18
of 18
course 18
every 18
word 18
was 18
immediately 18
irrevocably 18
branded 18
into 18
my 18
brain 18
we 18
didnt 18
sing 18
it 18
anymore 18
my 18
father 18
and 18
i 18
or 18
even 18
speak 18
of 18
it 18
after 18
he 18
died 18
it 18
used 18
to 18
come 18
back 18
to 18
me 18
a 18
lot 18
being 18
older 18
i 18
began 18
to 18
understand 18
the 18
lyrics 18
at 18
the 18
beginning 18
it 18
sounds 18
like 18
a 18
guy 18
is 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
his 18
girlfriend 18
to 18
secretly 18
meet 18
up 18
with 18
him 18
at 18
midnight 18
but 18
its 18
an 18
odd 18
place 18
for 18
a 18
tryst 18
a 18
hanging 18
tree 18
where 18
a 18
man 18
was 18
hung 18
for 18
murder 18
the 18
murderers 18
lover 18
must 18
have 18
had 18
something 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
the 18
killing 18
or 18
maybe 18
they 18
were 18
just 18
going 18
to 18
punish 18
her 18
anyway 18
because 18
his 18
corpse 18
called 18
out 18
for 18
her 18
to 18
flee 18
thats 18
weird 18
obviously 18
the 18
talkingcorpse 18
bit 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
until 18
the 18
third 18
verse 18
that 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
begins 18
to 18
get 18
unnerving 18
you 18
realize 18
the 18
singer 18
of 18
the 18
song 18
is 18
the 18
dead 18
murderer 18
hes 18
still 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
and 18
even 18
though 18
he 18
told 18
his 18
lover 18
to 18
flee 18
he 18
keeps 18
asking 18
if 18
shes 18
coming 18
to 18
meet 18
him 18
the 18
phrase 18
where 18
i 18
told 18
you 18
to 18
run 18
so 18
wed 18
both 18
be 18
free 18
is 18
the 18
most 18
troubling 18
because 18
at 18
first 18
you 18
think 18
hes 18
talking 18
about 18
when 18
he 18
told 18
her 18
to 18
flee 18
presumably 18
to 18
safety 18
but 18
then 18
you 18
wonder 18
if 18
he 18
meant 18
for 18
her 18
to 18
run 18
to 18
him 18
to 18
death 18
in 18
the 18
final 18
stanza 18
its 18
clear 18
that 18
thats 18
what 18
hes 18
waiting 18
for 18
his 18
lover 18
with 18
her 18
rope 18
necklace 18
hanging 18
dead 18
next 18
to 18
him 18
in 18
the 18
tree 18
i 18
used 18
to 18
think 18
the 18
murderer 18
was 18
the 18
creepiest 18
guy 18
imaginable 18
now 18
with 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
trips 18
to 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
under 18
my 18
belt 18
i 18
decide 18
not 18
to 18
judge 18
him 18
without 18
knowing 18
more 18
details 18
maybe 18
his 18
lover 18
was 18
already 18
sentenced 18
to 18
death 18
and 18
he 18
was 18
trying 18
to 18
make 18
it 18
easier 18
to 18
let 18
her 18
know 18
hed 18
be 18
waiting 18
or 18
maybe 18
he 18
thought 18
the 18
place 18
he 18
was 18
leaving 18
her 18
was 18
really 18
worse 18
than 18
death 18
didnt 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
kill 18
peeta 18
with 18
that 18
syringe 18
to 18
save 18
him 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
was 18
that 18
really 18
my 18
only 18
option 18
probably 18
not 18
but 18
i 18
couldnt 18
think 18
of 18
another 18
at 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
guess 18
my 18
mother 18
thought 18
the 18
whole 18
thing 18
was 18
too 18
twisted 18
for 18
a 18
sevenyearold 18
though 18
especially 18
one 18
who 18
made 18
her 18
own 18
rope 18
necklaces 18
it 18
wasnt 18
like 18
hanging 18
was 18
something 18
that 18
only 18
happened 18
in 18
a 18
story 18
plenty 18
of 18
people 18
were 18
executed 18
that 18
way 18
in 18
you 18
can 18
bet 18
she 18
didnt 18
want 18
me 18
singing 18
it 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
my 18
music 18
class 18
she 18
probably 18
wouldnt 18
like 18
me 18
doing 18
it 18
here 18
for 18
pollux 18
even 18
but 18
at 18
least 18
im 18
notwait 18
no 18
im 18
wrong 18
as 18
i 18
glance 18
sideways 18
i 18
see 18
castor 18
has 18
been 18
taping 18
me 18
everyone 18
is 18
watching 18
me 18
intently 18
and 18
pollux 18
has 18
tears 18
running 18
down 18
his 18
cheeks 18
because 18
no 18
doubt 18
my 18
freaky 18
song 18
has 18
dredged 18
up 18
some 18
terrible 18
incident 18
in 18
his 18
life 18
great 18
i 18
sigh 18
and 18
lean 18
back 18
against 18
the 18
trunk 18
thats 18
when 18
the 18
mockingjays 18
begin 18
their 18
rendition 18
of 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
in 18
their 18
mouths 18
its 18
quite 18
beautiful 18
conscious 18
of 18
being 18
filmed 18
i 18
stand 18
quietly 18
until 18
i 18
hear 18
cressida 18
call 18
cut 18
plutarch 18
crosses 18
to 18
me 18
laughing 18
where 18
do 18
you 18
come 18
up 18
with 18
this 18
stuff 18
no 18
one 18
would 18
believe 18
it 18
if 18
we 18
made 18
it 18
up 18
he 18
throws 18
an 18
arm 18
around 18
me 18
and 18
kisses 18
me 18
on 18
the 18
top 18
of 18
my 18
head 18
with 18
a 18
loud 18
smack 18
youre 18
golden 18
i 18
wasnt 18
doing 18
it 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
i 18
say 18
lucky 18
they 18
were 18
on 18
then 18
he 18
says 18
come 18
on 18
everybody 18
back 18
to 18
town 18
as 18
we 18
trudge 18
back 18
through 18
the 18
woods 18
we 18
reach 18
a 18
boulder 18
and 18
both 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
turn 18
our 18
heads 18
in 18
the 18
same 18
direction 18
like 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
dogs 18
catching 18
a 18
scent 18
on 18
the 18
wind 18
cressida 18
notices 18
and 18
asks 18
what 18
lies 18
that 18
way 18
we 18
admit 18
without 18
acknowledging 18
each 18
other 18
its 18
our 18
old 18
hunting 18
rendezvous 18
place 18
she 18
wants 18
to 18
see 18
it 18
even 18
after 18
we 18
tell 18
her 18
its 18
nothing 18
really 18
nothing 18
but 18
a 18
place 18
where 18
i 18
was 18
happy 18
i 18
think 18
our 18
rock 18
ledge 18
overlooking 18
the 18
valley 18
perhaps 18
a 18
little 18
less 18
green 18
than 18
usual 18
but 18
the 18
blackberry 18
bushes 18
hang 18
heavy 18
with 18
fruit 18
here 18
began 18
countless 18
days 18
of 18
hunting 18
and 18
snaring 18
fishing 18
and 18
gathering 18
roaming 18
together 18
through 18
the 18
woods 18
unloading 18
our 18
thoughts 18
while 18
we 18
filled 18
our 18
game 18
bags 18
this 18
was 18
the 18
doorway 18
to 18
both 18
sustenance 18
and 18
sanity 18
and 18
we 18
were 18
each 18
others 18
key 18
theres 18
no 18
district 18
to 18
escape 18
from 18
now 18
no 18
peacekeepers 18
to 18
trick 18
no 18
hungry 18
mouths 18
to 18
feed 18
the 18
capitol 18
took 18
away 18
all 18
of 18
that 18
and 18
im 18
on 18
the 18
verge 18
of 18
losing 18
gale 18
as 18
well 18
the 18
glue 18
of 18
mutual 18
need 18
that 18
bonded 18
us 18
so 18
tightly 18
together 18
for 18
all 18
those 18
years 18
is 18
melting 18
away 18
dark 18
patches 18
not 18
light 18
show 18
in 18
the 18
spaces 18
between 18
us 18
how 18
can 18
it 18
be 18
that 18
today 18
in 18
the 18
face 18
of 18
s 18
horrible 18
demise 18
we 18
are 18
too 18
angry 18
to 18
even 18
speak 18
to 18
each 18
other 18
gale 18
as 18
good 18
as 18
lied 18
to 18
me 18
that 18
was 18
unacceptable 18
even 18
if 18
he 18
was 18
concerned 18
about 18
my 18
wellbeing 18
his 18
apology 18
seemed 18
genuine 18
though 18
and 18
i 18
threw 18
it 18
back 18
in 18
his 18
face 18
with 18
an 18
insult 18
to 18
make 18
sure 18
it 18
stung 18
what 18
is 18
happening 18
to 18
us 18
why 18
are 18
we 18
always 18
at 18
odds 18
now 18
its 18
all 18
a 18
muddle 18
but 18
i 18
somehow 18
feel 18
that 18
if 18
i 18
went 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
root 18
of 18
our 18
troubles 18
my 18
actions 18
would 18
be 18
at 18
the 18
heart 18
of 18
it 18
do 18
i 18
really 18
want 18
to 18
drive 18
him 18
away 18
my 18
fingers 18
encircle 18
a 18
blackberry 18
and 18
pluck 18
it 18
from 18
its 18
stem 18
i 18
roll 18
it 18
gently 18
between 18
my 18
thumb 18
and 18
forefinger 18
suddenly 18
i 18
turn 18
to 18
him 18
and 18
toss 18
it 18
in 18
his 18
direction 18
and 18
may 18
the 18
odds 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
throw 18
it 18
high 18
so 18
he 18
has 18
plenty 18
of 18
time 18
to 18
decide 18
whether 18
to 18
knock 18
it 18
aside 18
or 18
accept 18
it 18
gales 18
eyes 18
train 18
on 18
me 18
not 18
the 18
berry 18
but 18
at 18
the 18
last 18
moment 18
he 18
opens 18
his 18
mouth 18
and 18
catches 18
it 18
he 18
chews 18
swallows 18
and 18
theres 18
a 18
long 18
pause 18
before 18
he 18
says 18
be 18
ever 18
in 18
your 18
favor 18
but 18
he 18
does 18
say 18
it 18
cressida 18
has 18
us 18
sit 18
in 18
the 18
nook 18
in 18
the 18
rocks 18
where 18
its 18
impossible 18
not 18
to 18
be 18
touching 18
and 18
coaxes 18
us 18
into 18
talking 18
about 18
hunting 18
what 18
drove 18
us 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
woods 18
how 18
we 18
met 18
favorite 18
moments 18
we 18
thaw 18
begin 18
to 18
laugh 18
a 18
little 18
as 18
we 18
relate 18
mishaps 18
with 18
bees 18
and 18
wild 18
dogs 18
and 18
skunks 18
when 18
the 18
conversation 18
turns 18
to 18
how 18
it 18
felt 18
to 18
translate 18
our 18
skill 18
with 18
weapons 18

of 18
metal 18
that 18

off 18
his 18
shirt 18
and 18
turns 18
his 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
camera 18
i 18
stare 18
at 18
the 18
lash 18
marks 18
and 18
again 18
hear 18
the 18
whistling 18
of 18
the 18
whip 18
see 18
his 18
bloody 18
figure 18
hanging 18
unconscious 18
by 18
his 18
wrists 18
im 18
done 18
i 18
announce 18
ill 18
meet 18
you 18
at 18
the 18
victors 18
village 18
something 18
formy 18
mother 18
i 18
guess 18
i 18
walked 18
here 18
but 18
the 18
next 18
thing 18
im 18
conscious 18
of 18
is 18
sitting 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
the 18
kitchen 18
cabinets 18
of 18
our 18
house 18
in 18
the 18
victors 18
village 18
meticulously 18
lining 18
ceramic 18
jars 18
and 18
glass 18
bottles 18
into 18
a 18
box 18
placing 18
clean 18
cotton 18
bandages 18
between 18
them 18
to 18
prevent 18
breaking 18
wrapping 18
bunches 18
of 18
dried 18
flowers 18
suddenly 18
i 18
remember 18
the 18
rose 18
on 18
my 18
dresser 18
was 18
it 18
real 18
if 18
so 18
is 18
it 18
still 18
up 18
there 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
resist 18
the 18
temptation 18
to 18
check 18
if 18
its 18
there 18
it 18
will 18
only 18
frighten 18
me 18
all 18
over 18
again 18
i 18
hurry 18
with 18
my 18
packing 18
when 18
the 18
cabinets 18
are 18
empty 18
i 18
rise 18
to 18
find 18
that 18
gale 18
has 18
materialized 18
in 18
my 18
kitchen 18
its 18
disturbing 18
how 18
soundlessly 18
he 18
can 18
appear 18
hes 18
leaning 18
on 18
the 18
table 18
his 18
fingers 18
spread 18
wide 18
against 18
the 18
wood 18
grain 18
i 18
set 18
the 18
box 18
between 18
us 18
remember 18
he 18
asks 18
this 18
is 18
where 18
you 18
kissed 18
me 18
so 18
the 18
heavy 18
dose 18
of 18
morphling 18
administered 18
after 18
the 18
whipping 18
wasnt 18
enough 18
to 18
erase 18
that 18
from 18
his 18
consciousness 18
i 18
didnt 18
think 18
youd 18
remember 18
that 18
i 18
say 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
dead 18
to 18
forget 18
maybe 18
even 18
not 18
then 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
maybe 18
ill 18
be 18
like 18
that 18
man 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
still 18
waiting 18
for 18
an 18
answer 18
gale 18
who 18
i 18
have 18
never 18
seen 18
cry 18
has 18
tears 18
in 18
his 18
eyes 18
to 18
keep 18
them 18
from 18
spilling 18
over 18
i 18
reach 18
forward 18
and 18
press 18
my 18
lips 18
against 18
his 18
we 18
taste 18
of 18
heat 18
ashes 18
and 18
misery 18
its 18
a 18
surprising 18
flavor 18
for 18
such 18
a 18
gentle 18
kiss 18
he 18
pulls 18
away 18
first 18
and 18
gives 18
me 18
a 18
wry 18
smile 18
i 18
knew 18
youd 18
kiss 18
me 18
how 18
i 18
say 18
because 18
i 18
didnt 18
know 18
myself 18
because 18
im 18
in 18
pain 18
he 18
says 18

the 18
only 18
way 18

your 18
attention 18

from 18
across 18
the 18

my 18
own 18
dread 18
mirrored 18
back 18
the 18
recognition 18
that 18
with 18
every 18

the 18

of 18

find 18
incriminating 18

both 18
truth 18
and 18
justice 18
will 18
reign 18
the 18

let 18
the 18

tear 18

anyone 18
notice 18

no 18

about 18
the 18

whose 18

has 18
been 18
replaced 18

up 18
every 18

of 18

falls 18
on 18
haymitch 18
its 18
not 18
some 18
big 18
mystery 18
the 18
boys 18
telling 18
us 18
were 18
about 18
to 18
be 18
attacked 18
here 18
in 18
thirteen 18
how 18
would 18
he 18
have 18
that 18
information 18
why 18
should 18
we 18
trust 18
him 18
how 18
do 18
you 18
know 18
haymitch 18
gives 18
a 18
growl 18
of 18
frustration 18
theyre 18
beating 18
him 18
bloody 18
while 18
we 18
speak 18
what 18
more 18
do 18
you 18
need 18
katniss 18
help 18
me 18
out 18
here 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
give 18
myself 18
a 18
shake 18
to 18
free 18
my 18
words 18
haymitchs 18
right 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
where 18
peeta 18
got 18
the 18
information 18
or 18
if 18
its 18
true 18
but 18
he 18
believes 18
it 18
is 18
and 18
theyre 18
i 18
cant 18
say 18
aloud 18
what 18
snows 18
doing 18
to 18
him 18
you 18
dont 18
know 18
him 18
haymitch 18
says 18
to 18
coin 18
we 18
do 18
get 18
your 18
people 18
ready 18
the 18
president 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
alarmed 18
only 18
somewhat 18
perplexed 18
by 18
this 18
turn 18
in 18
events 18
she 18
mulls 18
over 18
the 18
words 18
tapping 18
one 18
finger 18
lightly 18
on 18
the 18
rim 18
of 18
the 18
control 18
board 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
her 18
when 18
she 18
speaks 18
she 18
addresses 18
haymitch 18
in 18
an 18
even 18
voice 18
of 18
course 18
we 18
have 18
prepared 18
for 18
such 18
a 18
scenario 18
although 18
we 18
have 18
decades 18
of 18
support 18
for 18
the 18
assumption 18
that 18
further 18
direct 18
attacks 18
on 18
thirteen 18
would 18
be 18
counterproductive 18
to 18
the 18
capitols 18
cause 18
nuclear 18
missiles 18
would 18
release 18
radiation 18
into 18
the 18
atmosphere 18
with 18
incalculable 18
environmental 18
results 18
even 18
routine 18
bombing 18
could 18
badly 18
damage 18
our 18
military 18
compound 18
which 18
we 18
know 18
they 18
hope 18
to 18
regain 18
and 18
of 18
course 18
they 18
invite 18
a 18
counterstrike 18
it 18
is 18
conceivable 18
that 18
given 18
our 18
current 18
alliance 18
with 18
the 18
rebels 18
those 18
would 18
be 18
viewed 18
as 18
acceptable 18
risks 18
you 18
think 18
so 18
says 18
haymitch 18
its 18
a 18
shade 18
too 18
sincere 18
but 18
the 18
subtleties 18
of 18
irony 18
are 18
often 18
wasted 18
in 18
i 18
do 18
at 18
any 18
rate 18

two 18

since 18
i 18
arrived 18
in 18
i 18
dont 18
remember 18
much 18
about 18
the 18
first 18
i 18
was 18
in 18
intensive 18
care 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
and 18
i 18
think 18
the 18
patients 18
were 18
exempted 18
as 18
the 18
complications 18
of 18
removing 18
us 18
for 18
a 18
practice 18
drill 18
outweighed 18
the 18
benefits 18
i 18
was 18
vaguely 18
aware 18
of 18
a 18
mechanical 18
voice 18
instructing 18
people 18
to 18
congregate 18
in 18
yellow 18

during 18
a 18

were 18
supposed 18
to 18
return 18
to 18
our 18
living 18
quarters 18
i 18
stayed 18
behind 18
a 18
pipe 18
in 18
the 18
laundry 18
room 18
ignored 18
the 18
pulsating 18
beeps 18
coming 18
over 18
the 18
audio 18
system 18
and 18
watched 18
a 18
spider 18
construct 18
a 18
web 18
neither 18
experience 18
has 18
prepared 18

for 18
the 18
wordless 18

fearinducing 18

that 18
now 18

there 18
would 18
be 18
no 18
disregarding 18
this 18
sound 18
which 18
seems 18
designed 18
to 18
throw 18
the 18
whole 18
population 18
into 18
a 18
frenzy 18
but 18
this 18
is 18
and 18
that 18
doesnt 18
happen 18
boggs 18
guides 18
finnick 18
and 18
me 18
out 18
of 18

along 18
the 18
hall 18
to 18
a 18
doorway 18
and 18
onto 18
a 18
wide 18
stairway 18
streams 18
of 18
people 18
are 18
converging 18
to 18
form 18
a 18
river 18
that 18
flows 18
only 18
downward 18
no 18
one 18
shrieks 18
or 18
tries 18
to 18
push 18
ahead 18
even 18
the 18
children 18
dont 18
resist 18
we 18
descend 18
flight 18
after 18
flight 18
speechless 18
because 18
no 18
word 18
could 18
be 18
heard 18
above 18
this 18
sound 18
i 18
look 18
for 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
prim 18
but 18
its 18
impossible 18
to 18
see 18
anyone 18
but 18
those 18
immediately 18
around 18
me 18
theyre 18
both 18
working 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
tonight 18
though 18
so 18
theres 18
no 18
way 18
they 18
can 18
miss 18
the 18
drill 18
my 18
ears 18
pop 18
and 18
my 18
eyes 18
feel 18
heavy 18
we 18
are 18
coalmine 18
deep 18
the 18
only 18
plus 18
is 18
that 18
the 18
farther 18
we 18
retreat 18
into 18
the 18
earth 18
the 18
less 18
shrill 18
the 18
sirens 18
become 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
they 18
were 18
meant 18
to 18
physically 18
drive 18
us 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
surface 18
which 18
i 18
suppose 18
they 18
are 18
groups 18
of 18
people 18
begin 18
to 18
peel 18
off 18
into 18
marked 18
doorways 18
and 18
still 18
boggs 18
directs 18
me 18
downward 18
until 18
finally 18
the 18
stairs 18
end 18
at 18
the 18
edge 18
of 18
an 18
enormous 18
cavern 18
i 18
start 18
to 18
walk 18
straight 18
in 18
and 18
boggs 18
stops 18
me 18
shows 18
me 18
that 18
i 18
must 18
wave 18
my 18
schedule 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
a 18
scanner 18
so 18
that 18
im 18
accounted 18
for 18
no 18

the 18

to 18
make 18
sure 18
no 18
ones 18
gone 18
astray 18
the 18
place 18
seems 18
unable 18
to 18
decide 18
if 18
its 18
natural 18
or 18
manmade 18
certain 18
areas 18
of 18
the 18

the 18
counter 18
after 18
sliding 18
one 18
on 18
my 18
back 18
and 18
getting 18
a 18
grip 18
on 18
the 18
other 18
two 18
with 18
my 18
hands 18
i 18
turn 18
to 18

a 18
group 18
rapidly 18
forming 18
behind 18
me 18
excuse 18
me 18
i 18
say 18
as 18
i 18
carry 18
my 18
supplies 18
through 18
the 18
others 18
is 18
it 18
a 18
matter 18
of 18
timing 18
or 18
is 18
plutarch 18
right 18
are 18
these 18
people 18
modeling 18
their 18
behavior 18
on 18
mine 18
back 18
at 18
our 18
space 18
i 18
open 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
packs 18
to 18
find 18
a 18
thin 18
mattress 18

two 18
sets 18
of 18
gray 18
clothing 18
a 18
toothbrush 18
a 18
comb 18
and 18
a 18
flashlight 18
on 18
examining 18
the 18
contents 18
of 18
the 18
other 18
packs 18
i 18
find 18
the 18
only 18
discernible 18
difference 18
is 18
that 18
they 18
contain 18
both 18
gray 18
and 18
white 18
outfits 18
the 18
latter 18
will 18
be 18
for 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
prim 18
in 18
case 18
they 18
have 18
medical 18
duties 18
after 18
i 18
make 18
up 18
the 18
beds 18

the 18
clothes 18
and 18
return 18
the 18
backpacks 18
ive 18
got 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
but 18
observe 18
the 18
last 18
rule 18
await 18
further 18
instructions 18
i 18
sit 18
crosslegged 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
to 18
await 18
a 18
steady 18
flow 18
of 18
people 18
begins 18
to 18
fill 18
the 18
room 18
claiming 18
spaces 18
collecting 18
supplies 18
it 18
wont 18
take 18
long 18
until 18
the 18
place 18
is 18
full 18
up 18
i 18
wonder 18
if 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
prim 18
are 18
going 18
to 18
stay 18
the 18
night 18
at 18
wherever 18
the 18
hospital 18
patients 18
have 18
been 18
taken 18
but 18
no 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
so 18
they 18
were 18
on 18
the 18
list 18
here 18
im 18
starting 18
to 18
get 18
anxious 18
when 18
my 18
mother 18
appears 18
i 18
look 18
behind 18
her 18
into 18
a 18
sea 18
of 18
strangers 18
wheres 18
prim 18
i 18
ask 18
isnt 18
she 18
here 18
she 18
replies 18
she 18
was 18
supposed 18
to 18
come 18
straight 18
down 18
from 18
the 18
hospital 18
she 18
left 18
ten 18
minutes 18
before 18
i 18
did 18
where 18
is 18
she 18
where 18
could 18
she 18
have 18
gone 18
i 18
squeeze 18
my 18
lids 18
shut 18
tight 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
to 18
track 18
her 18
as 18
i 18
would 18
prey 18
on 18
a 18
hunt 18
see 18
her 18
react 18
to 18
the 18
sirens 18
rush 18
to 18
help 18
the 18
patients 18
nod 18
as 18
they 18
gesture 18
for 18
her 18
to 18
descend 18
to 18
the 18
bunker 18
and 18
then 18
hesitate 18
with 18
her 18
on 18
the 18
stairs 18
torn 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
but 18
why 18
my 18
eyes 18
fly 18
open 18
the 18
cat 18
she 18
went 18
back 18
for 18
him 18
oh 18
no 18
my 18
mother 18
says 18
we 18
both 18
know 18
im 18
right 18
were 18
pushing 18
against 18
the 18
incoming 18
tide 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
bunker 18
up 18
ahead 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
them 18
preparing 18
to 18
shut 18
the 18
thick 18
metal 18
doors 18
slowly 18
rotating 18
the 18
metal 18
wheels 18
on 18
either 18
side 18
inward 18
somehow 18
i 18
know 18
that 18
once 18
they 18
have 18
been 18
sealed 18
nothing 18
in 18
the 18
world 18
will 18
convince 18
the 18
soldiers 18
to 18
open 18
them 18
perhaps 18
it 18
will 18
even 18
be 18
beyond 18
their 18
control 18
im 18
indiscriminately 18
shoving 18
people 18
aside 18
as 18
i 18
shout 18
for 18
them 18
to 18
wait 18
the 18
space 18
between 18
the 18
doors 18
shrinks 18
to 18
a 18
yard 18
a 18
foot 18
there 18
are 18
only 18
a 18
few 18
inches 18
left 18
when 18
i 18
jam 18
my 18
hand 18
through 18
the 18
crack 18
open 18
it 18
let 18
me 18
out 18
i 18
cry 18
consternation 18
shows 18
on 18
the 18
soldiers 18
faces 18
as 18
they 18
reverse 18
the 18
wheels 18
a 18
bit 18
not 18
enough 18
to 18
let 18
me 18
pass 18
but 18
enough 18
to 18
avoid 18
crushing 18
my 18
fingers 18
i 18
take 18
the 18
opportunity 18
to 18
wedge 18
my 18
shoulder 18
into 18
the 18
opening 18
prim 18
i 18
holler 18
up 18
the 18
stairs 18
my 18
mother 18
pleads 18
with 18
the 18
guards 18
as 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
wriggle 18
my 18
way 18
out 18
prim 18
then 18
i 18
hear 18
it 18
the 18
faint 18
sound 18
of 18
footsteps 18
on 18
the 18
stairs 18
were 18
coming 18
i 18
hear 18
my 18
sister 18
call 18

the 18
door 18
that 18
was 18
gale 18
theyre 18
coming 18
i 18
tell 18
the 18
guards 18
and 18
they 18
slide 18
the 18
doors 18
open 18
about 18
a 18
foot 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
dare 18
moveafraid 18
theyll 18
lock 18
us 18
all 18
outuntil 18
prim 18
appears 18
her 18
cheeks 18
flushed 18
with 18
running 18
hauling 18
buttercup 18
i 18
pull 18
her 18
inside 18
and 18
gale 18
follows 18
twisting 18
an 18
armload 18
of 18
baggage 18
sideways 18
to 18
get 18
it 18
into 18
the 18
bunker 18
the 18
doors 18
are 18
closed 18
with 18
a 18
loud 18
and 18
final 18
clank 18
what 18
were 18
you 18
thinking 18
i 18
give 18
prim 18
an 18
angry 18
shake 18
and 18
then 18
hug 18
her 18
squashing 18
buttercup 18
between 18
us 18
prims 18
explanation 18
is 18
already 18
on 18
her 18
lips 18
i 18
couldnt 18
leave 18
him 18
behind 18
katniss 18
not 18
twice 18
you 18
should 18
have 18
seen 18
him 18
pacing 18
the 18
room 18
and 18
howling 18
hed 18
come 18
back 18
to 18
protect 18
us 18
okay 18
okay 18
i 18
take 18
a 18
few 18
breaths 18
to 18
calm 18
myself 18
step 18
back 18
and 18
lift 18
buttercup 18
by 18
the 18
scruff 18
of 18
the 18
neck 18
i 18
shouldve 18
drowned 18
you 18
when 18
i 18
had 18
the 18
chance 18
his 18
ears 18
flatten 18
and 18
he 18
raises 18
a 18
paw 18
i 18
hiss 18
before 18
he 18
gets 18
a 18
chance 18
which 18
seems 18
to 18
annoy 18
him 18
a 18
little 18
since 18
he 18
considers 18
hissing 18
his 18
own 18
personal 18
sound 18
of 18
contempt 18
in 18
retaliation 18
he 18
gives 18
a 18
helpless 18
kitten 18
mew 18
that 18
brings 18
my 18
sister 18
immediately 18
to 18
his 18
defense 18
oh 18
katniss 18
dont 18
tease 18
him 18
she 18
says 18
folding 18
him 18
back 18
in 18
her 18
arms 18
hes 18
already 18
so 18
upset 18
the 18
idea 18
that 18
ive 18
wounded 18
the 18
brutes 18
tiny 18

invites 18
further 18
taunting 18
but 18
prims 18
genuinely 18
distressed 18
for 18
him 18
so 18
instead 18
i 18
visualize 18
buttercups 18
fur 18
lining 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
gloves 18
an 18
image 18
that 18
has 18
helped 18
me 18
deal 18
with 18
him 18
over 18
the 18
years 18
okay 18
sorry 18

under 18
the 18

box 18
of 18
medical 18
supplies 18
from 18
our 18
kitchen 18
in 18

of 18
our 18

chance 18

peeta 18
blood 18
like 18
raindrops 18
on 18
the 18
window 18

if 18
you 18
need 18
me 18
practically 18
everyone 18
withdrew 18
to 18
their 18
spaces 18
when 18
the 18
doors 18
shut 18
so 18
i 18
get 18
to 18
cross 18
to 18
our 18
new 18
home 18
with 18
at 18
least 18
five 18
hundred 18
people 18
watching 18
me 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
appear 18
extra 18
calm 18
to 18
make 18
up 18
for 18
my 18
frantic 18
crashing 18
through 18
the 18
crowd 18
like 18
thats 18
fooling 18
anyone 18
so 18
much 18
for 18
setting 18
an 18
example 18
oh 18
who 18
cares 18
they 18
all 18
think 18
im 18
nuts 18
anyway 18
one 18
man 18
who 18
i 18
think 18
i 18
knocked 18
to 18
the 18
floor 18
catches 18
my 18
eye 18
and 18
rubs 18
his 18
elbow 18
resentfully 18
i 18
almost 18
hiss 18
at 18
him 18
too 18
prim 18
has 18
buttercup 18
installed 18
on 18
the 18
lower 18
bunk 18
draped 18
in 18
a 18
blanket 18
so 18
that 18
only 18
his 18
face 18
pokes 18
out 18
this 18
is 18
how 18
he 18
likes 18
to 18
be 18
when 18
theres 18
thunder 18
the 18
one 18
thing 18
that 18
actually 18
frightens 18
him 18
my 18
mother 18
puts 18
her 18
box 18
carefully 18
in 18
the 18
cube 18
i 18
crouch 18
my 18
back 18
supported 18
by 18
the 18
wall 18
to 18
check 18
what 18
gale 18
managed 18
to 18
rescue 18
in 18
my 18
hunting 18
bag 18
the 18
plant 18
book 18
the 18
hunting 18
jacket 18
my 18
parents 18
wedding 18
photo 18
and 18
the 18
personal 18
contents 18
of 18
my 18
drawer 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
pin 18
now 18
lives 18
with 18
cinnas 18
outfit 18
but 18
theres 18
the 18
gold 18
locket 18
and 18
the 18
silver 18
parachute 18
with 18
the 18
spile 18
and 18
peetas 18
pearl 18
i 18
knot 18
the 18
pearl 18
into 18
the 18
corner 18
of 18
the 18
parachute 18
bury 18
it 18
deep 18
in 18
the 18
recesses 18
of 18
the 18
bag 18
as 18
if 18
its 18
peetas 18
life 18
and 18
no 18
one 18
can 18
take 18
it 18
away 18
as 18
long 18
as 18
i 18
guard 18
it 18
the 18
faint 18
sound 18
of 18
the 18
sirens 18
cuts 18
off 18
sharply 18
coins 18
voice 18
comes 18
over 18
the 18
district 18
audio 18
system 18
thanking 18
us 18
all 18
for 18
an 18
exemplary 18
evacuation 18
of 18
the 18
upper 18
levels 18
she 18
stresses 18
that 18
this 18
is 18
not 18
a 18
drill 18
as 18
peeta 18
mellark 18
the 18
district 18
victor 18
has 18
possibly 18
made 18
a 18
televised 18
reference 18
to 18
an 18
attack 18
on 18
tonight 18
thats 18
when 18
the 18
first 18
bomb 18
hits 18
theres 18
an 18
initial 18
sense 18
of 18
impact 18
followed 18
by 18
an 18
explosion 18
that 18
resonates 18
in 18
my 18
innermost 18
parts 18
the 18
lining 18
of 18
my 18
intestines 18
the 18
marrow 18
of 18
my 18
bones 18
the 18
roots 18
of 18
my 18
teeth 18
were 18
all 18
going 18
to 18
die 18
i 18
think 18
my 18
eyes 18
turn 18
upward 18
expecting 18
to 18
see 18
giant 18
cracks 18
race 18
across 18
the 18
ceiling 18
massive 18
chunks 18
of 18
stone 18
raining 18
down 18
on 18
us 18
but 18
the 18
bunker 18
itself 18
gives 18
only 18
a 18
slight 18
shudder 18
the 18
lights 18
go 18
out 18
and 18
i 18
experience 18
the 18
disorientation 18
of 18
total 18
darkness 18
speechless 18
human 18
soundsspontaneous 18
shrieks 18
ragged 18
breaths 18
baby 18
whimpers 18
one 18
musical 18
bit 18
of 18
insane 18
laughterdance 18
around 18
in 18
the 18
charged 18
air 18
then 18
theres 18
a 18
hum 18
of 18
a 18
generator 18
and 18
a 18
dim 18
wavering 18
glow 18
replaces 18
the 18
stark 18
lighting 18
that 18
is 18
the 18
norm 18
in 18
its 18
closer 18
to 18
what 18
we 18
had 18
in 18
our 18
homes 18
in 18
when 18
the 18
candles 18
and 18
fire 18
burned 18
low 18
on 18
a 18
winters 18
night 18
i 18
reach 18
for 18
prim 18
in 18
the 18
twilight 18
clamp 18
my 18
hand 18
on 18
her 18
leg 18
and 18
pull 18
myself 18
over 18
to 18
her 18
her 18
voice 18
remains 18
steady 18
as 18
she 18
croons 18
to 18
buttercup 18
its 18
all 18
right 18
baby 18
its 18
all 18
right 18
well 18
be 18
okay 18
down 18
here 18
my 18
mother 18
wraps 18
her 18
arms 18
around 18
us 18
i 18
allow 18
myself 18
to 18
feel 18
young 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
and 18
rest 18
my 18
head 18
on 18
her 18
shoulder 18
that 18
was 18
nothing 18
like 18
the 18
bombs 18
in 18
eight 18
i 18
say 18
probably 18
a 18
bunker 18
missile 18
says 18
prim 18
keeping 18
her 18
voice 18
soothing 18
for 18
the 18
cats 18
sake 18
we 18
learned 18
about 18
them 18
during 18
the 18
orientation 18
for 18
new 18
citizens 18
theyre 18
designed 18
to 18
penetrate 18
deep 18
in 18
the 18
ground 18
before 18
they 18
go 18
off 18
because 18
theres 18
no 18
point 18
in 18
bombing 18
thirteen 18
on 18
the 18
surface 18
anymore 18
nuclear 18
i 18
ask 18
feeling 18
a 18
chill 18
run 18
through 18
me 18
not 18
necessarily 18
says 18
prim 18
some 18
just 18
have 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
explosives 18
in 18
them 18
butit 18
could 18
be 18
either 18
kind 18
i 18
guess 18
the 18
gloom 18
makes 18
it 18
hard 18
to 18
see 18
the 18
heavy 18
metal 18
doors 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
bunker 18
would 18
they 18
be 18
any 18
protection 18
against 18
a 18
nuclear 18
attack 18
and 18
even 18
if 18
they 18
were 18
one 18
hundred 18
percent 18
effective 18
at 18
sealing 18
out 18
the 18
radiation 18
which 18
is 18
really 18
unlikely 18
would 18
we 18
ever 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
leave 18
this 18
place 18
the 18
thought 18
of 18
spending 18
whatever 18
remains 18
of 18
my 18
life 18
in 18
this 18
stone 18
vault 18
horrifies 18
me 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
run 18
madly 18
for 18
the 18
door 18
and 18
demand 18
to 18
be 18
released 18
into 18
whatever 18
lies 18
above 18
its 18
pointless 18
they 18
would 18
never 18
let 18
me 18
out 18
and 18
i 18
might 18
start 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
stampede 18
were 18
so 18
far 18
down 18
im 18
sure 18
were 18
safe 18
says 18
my 18
mother 18
wanly 18
is 18
she 18
thinking 18
of 18
my 18
fathers 18
being 18
blown 18
to 18
nothingness 18
in 18
the 18
mines 18
it 18
was 18
a 18
close 18
call 18
though 18
thank 18
goodness 18
peeta 18
had 18
the 18
wherewithal 18
to 18
warn 18
us 18
the 18
wherewithal 18
a 18
general 18
term 18
that 18
somehow 18
includes 18
everything 18
that 18
was 18
needed 18
for 18
him 18
to 18
sound 18
the 18
alarm 18
the 18
knowledge 18
the 18
opportunity 18
the 18
courage 18
and 18
something 18
else 18
i 18
cant 18
define 18
peeta 18
seemed 18
to 18
have 18
been 18
waging 18
a 18
sort 18
of 18
battle 18
in 18
his 18
mind 18
fighting 18
to 18
get 18
the 18
message 18
out 18
why 18
the 18
ease 18
with 18
which 18
he 18
manipulates 18
words 18
is 18
his 18
greatest 18
talent 18
was 18
his 18
difficulty 18
a 18
result 18
of 18
his 18
torture 18
something 18
more 18
like 18
madness 18
coins 18
voice 18
perhaps 18
a 18
shade 18
grimmer 18
fills 18
the 18
bunker 18
the 18
volume 18
level 18
flickering 18
with 18
the 18
lights 18
apparently 18
peeta 18
mellarks 18
information 18
was 18
sound 18
and 18
we 18
owe 18
him 18
a 18
great 18
debt 18
of 18
gratitude 18
sensors 18
indicate 18
the 18
first 18
missile 18
was 18
not 18
nuclear 18
but 18
very 18
powerful 18
we 18
expect 18
more 18
will 18
follow 18
for 18
the 18
duration 18
of 18
the 18
attack 18
citizens 18
are 18
to 18
stay 18
in 18
their 18
assigned 18
areas 18
unless 18
otherwise 18
notified 18
a 18
soldier 18
alerts 18
my 18
mother 18
that 18
shes 18
needed 18
in 18
the 18
firstaid 18
station 18
shes 18
reluctant 18
to 18
leave 18
us 18
even 18
though 18
shell 18
only 18
be 18
thirty 18
yards 18
away 18
well 18
be 18
fine 18
really 18
i 18
tell 18
her 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
anything 18
could 18
get 18
past 18
him 18
i 18
point 18
to 18
buttercup 18
who 18
gives 18
me 18
such 18
a 18
halfhearted 18
hiss 18
we 18
all 18
have 18
to 18
laugh 18
a 18
little 18
even 18
i 18
feel 18
sorry 18
for 18
him 18
after 18
my 18
mother 18
goes 18
i 18
suggest 18
why 18
dont 18
you 18
climb 18
in 18
with 18
him 18
prim 18
i 18
know 18
its 18
sillybut 18
im 18
afraid 18
the 18
bunk 18
might 18
collapse 18
on 18
us 18
during 18
the 18
attack 18
she 18
says 18
if 18
the 18
bunks 18
collapse 18
the 18
whole 18
bunker 18
will 18
have 18
given 18
way 18
and 18
buried 18
us 18
but 18
i 18
decide 18
this 18
kind 18
of 18
logic 18
wont 18
actually 18
be 18
helpful 18
instead 18
i 18
clean 18
out 18
the 18
storage 18
cube 18
and 18
make 18
buttercup 18
a 18
bed 18
inside 18
then 18
i 18
pull 18
a 18
mattress 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
it 18
for 18
my 18
sister 18
and 18
me 18
to 18
share 18
were 18
given 18
clearance 18
in 18
small 18
groups 18
to 18
use 18
the 18
bathroom 18
and 18
brush 18
our 18
teeth 18
although 18
showering 18
has 18
been 18
canceled 18
for 18
the 18
day 18
i 18
curl 18
up 18
with 18
prim 18
on 18
the 18
mattress 18
double 18
layering 18
the 18
blankets 18
because 18
the 18
cavern 18
emits 18
a 18
dank 18
chill 18
buttercup 18
miserable 18
even 18
with 18
prims 18
constant 18
attention 18
huddles 18
in 18
the 18
cube 18
and 18
exhales 18
cat 18
breath 18
in 18
my 18
face 18
despite 18
the 18
disagreeable 18
conditions 18
im 18
glad 18
to 18
have 18
time 18
with 18
my 18
sister 18
my 18
extreme 18
preoccupation 18
since 18
i 18

since 18
the 18
first 18
games 18

attention 18
for 18
her 18
i 18
havent 18
been 18
watching 18
over 18
her 18
the 18
way 18
i 18
should 18
the 18
way 18
i 18
used 18
to 18
after 18
all 18
it 18
was 18
gale 18
who 18
checked 18
our 18
compartment 18
not 18
me 18
something 18
to 18
make 18
up 18
for 18
i 18
realize 18
ive 18
never 18
even 18
bothered 18
to 18
ask 18
her 18
about 18
how 18
shes 18
handling 18
the 18
shock 18
of 18
coming 18
here 18
so 18
how 18
are 18
you 18
liking 18
thirteen 18
prim 18
i 18
offer 18
right 18
now 18
she 18
asks 18
we 18
both 18
laugh 18
i 18
miss 18
home 18
badly 18
sometimes 18
but 18
then 18
i 18
remember 18
theres 18
nothing 18
left 18
to 18
miss 18
anymore 18
i 18
feel 18
safer 18
here 18
we 18
dont 18
have 18
to 18
worry 18
about 18
you 18
well 18
not 18
the 18
same 18
way 18
she 18
pauses 18
and 18
then 18
a 18
shy 18
smile 18
crosses 18
her 18
lips 18
i 18
think 18
theyre 18
going 18
to 18
train 18
me 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
doctor 18
its 18
the 18
first 18
ive 18
heard 18
of 18
it 18
well 18
of 18
course 18
they 18
are 18
theyd 18
be 18
stupid 18
not 18
to 18
theyve 18
been 18
watching 18
me 18
when 18
i 18
help 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
im 18
already 18
taking 18
the 18
medic 18
courses 18
its 18
just 18
beginners 18
stuff 18
i 18
know 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
it 18
from 18
home 18
still 18
theres 18
plenty 18
to 18
learn 18
she 18
tells 18
me 18
thats 18
great 18
i 18
say 18
prim 18
a 18
doctor 18
she 18
couldnt 18
even 18
dream 18
of 18
it 18
in 18
something 18
small 18
and 18
quiet 18
like 18
a 18
match 18
being 18
struck 18
lights 18
up 18
the 18
gloom 18
inside 18
me 18
this 18
is 18
the 18
sort 18
of 18
future 18
a 18
rebellion 18
could 18
bring 18
what 18
about 18
you 18
katniss 18
how 18
are 18
you 18
managing 18
her 18
fingertip 18
moves 18
in 18
short 18
gentle 18
strokes 18
between 18
buttercups 18
eyes 18
and 18
dont 18
say 18
youre 18
fine 18
its 18
true 18
whatever 18
the 18
opposite 18
of 18
fine 18
is 18
thats 18
what 18
i 18
am 18
so 18
i 18
go 18
ahead 18
and 18
tell 18
her 18
about 18
peeta 18
his 18
deterioration 18
onscreen 18
and 18
how 18
i 18
think 18
they 18
must 18
be 18
killing 18
him 18
at 18
this 18
very 18
moment 18
buttercup 18
has 18
to 18
rely 18
on 18
himself 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
because 18
now 18
prim 18
turns 18
her 18
attention 18
to 18
me 18
pulling 18
me 18
closer 18
brushing 18
the 18
hair 18
back 18
behind 18
my 18
ears 18
with 18
her 18
fingers 18
ive 18
stopped 18
talking 18
because 18
theres 18
really 18
nothing 18
left 18
to 18
say 18
and 18
theres 18
this 18
piercing 18
sort 18
of 18
pain 18
where 18
my 18
heart 18
is 18
maybe 18
im 18
even 18
having 18
a 18
heart 18
attack 18
but 18
it 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
worth 18
mentioning 18
katniss 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
president 18
snow 18
will 18
kill 18
peeta 18
she 18
says 18
of 18
course 18
she 18
says 18
this 18
its 18
what 18
she 18
thinks 18
will 18
calm 18
me 18
but 18
her 18
next 18
words 18
come 18
as 18
a 18
surprise 18
if 18
he 18
does 18
he 18
wont 18
have 18
anyone 18
left 18
you 18
want 18
he 18
wont 18
have 18
any 18
way 18
to 18
hurt 18
you 18
suddenly 18
i 18
am 18
reminded 18
of 18
another 18
girl 18
one 18
who 18
had 18
seen 18
all 18
the 18
evil 18
the 18
capitol 18
had 18
to 18
offer 18
johanna 18
mason 18
the 18
tribute 18
from 18
district 18
in 18
the 18
last 18
arena 18
i 18
was 18
trying 18
to 18
prevent 18
her 18
from 18
going 18
into 18
the 18
jungle 18
where 18
the 18
jabberjays 18
mimicked 18
the 18
voices 18
of 18
loved 18
ones 18
being 18
tortured 18
but 18
she 18
brushed 18
me 18
off 18
saying 18
they 18
cant 18
hurt 18
me 18
im 18
not 18
like 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
you 18
theres 18
no 18
one 18
left 18
i 18
love 18
then 18
i 18
know 18
prim 18
is 18
right 18
that 18
snow 18
cannot 18
afford 18
to 18
waste 18
peetas 18
life 18
especially 18
now 18
while 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
causes 18
so 18
much 18
havoc 18
hes 18
killed 18
cinna 18
already 18
destroyed 18
my 18
home 18
my 18
family 18
gale 18
and 18
even 18
haymitch 18
are 18
out 18
of 18
his 18
reach 18
peetas 18
all 18
he 18
has 18
left 18
so 18
what 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
theyll 18
do 18
to 18
him 18
i 18
ask 18
prim 18
sounds 18
about 18
a 18
thousand 18
years 18
old 18
when 18
she 18
speaks 18
whatever 18
it 18
takes 18
to 18
break 18
you 18
what 18
will 18
break 18
me 18
this 18
is 18
the 18
question 18
that 18
consumes 18
me 18
over 18
the 18
next 18
three 18
days 18
as 18
we 18
wait 18
to 18
be 18
released 18
from 18
our 18
prison 18
of 18
safety 18
what 18
will 18
break 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
million 18
pieces 18
so 18
that 18
i 18
am 18
beyond 18
repair 18
beyond 18
usefulness 18
i 18
mention 18
it 18
to 18
no 18
one 18
but 18
it 18
devours 18
my 18
waking 18
hours 18
and 18
weaves 18
itself 18
throughout 18
my 18
nightmares 18
four 18
more 18
bunker 18
missiles 18
fall 18
over 18
this 18
period 18
all 18
massive 18
all 18
very 18
damaging 18
but 18
theres 18
no 18
urgency 18
to 18
the 18
attack 18
the 18
bombs 18
are 18
spread 18
out 18
over 18
the 18
long 18
hours 18
so 18
that 18
just 18
when 18
you 18
think 18
the 18
raid 18
is 18
over 18
another 18
blast 18
sends 18
shock 18
waves 18
through 18
your 18
guts 18
it 18
feels 18
more 18
designed 18
to 18
keep 18
us 18
in 18
lockdown 18
than 18
to 18
decimate 18
cripple 18
the 18
district 18
yes 18
give 18
the 18
people 18
plenty 18
to 18
do 18
to 18
get 18
the 18
place 18
running 18
again 18
but 18
destroy 18
it 18
no 18
coin 18
was 18
right 18
on 18
that 18
point 18
you 18
dont 18
destroy 18
what 18
you 18
want 18
to 18
acquire 18
in 18
the 18
future 18
i 18
assume 18
what 18
they 18
really 18
want 18
in 18
the 18
short 18
term 18
is 18
to 18
stop 18
the 18
airtime 18
assaults 18
and 18
keep 18
me 18
off 18
the 18
televisions 18
of 18
panem 18
we 18
receive 18
next 18
to 18
no 18
information 18
about 18
what 18
is 18
happening 18
our 18
screens 18
never 18
come 18
on 18
and 18
we 18
get 18
only 18
brief 18
audio 18
updates 18
from 18
coin 18
about 18
the 18
nature 18
of 18
the 18
bombs 18
certainly 18
the 18
war 18
is 18
still 18
being 18
waged 18
but 18
as 18
to 18
its 18
status 18
were 18
in 18
the 18
dark 18
inside 18
the 18
bunker 18
cooperation 18
is 18
the 18
order 18
of 18
the 18
day 18
we 18
adhere 18
to 18
a 18
strict 18
schedule 18
for 18
meals 18
and 18
bathing 18
exercise 18
and 18
sleep 18
small 18
periods 18
of 18
socialization 18
are 18
granted 18
to 18
alleviate 18
the 18
tedium 18
our 18
space 18
becomes 18
very 18
popular 18
because 18
both 18
children 18
and 18
adults 18
have 18
a 18
fascination 18
with 18
buttercup 18
he 18
attains 18
celebrity 18
status 18
with 18
his 18
evening 18
game 18
of 18
crazy 18
cat 18
i 18
created 18
this 18
by 18
accident 18
a 18
few 18
years 18
ago 18
during 18
a 18
winter 18
blackout 18
you 18
simply 18
wiggle 18
a 18
flashlight 18
beam 18
around 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
and 18
buttercup 18
tries 18
to 18
catch 18
it 18
im 18
petty 18
enough 18
to 18
enjoy 18
it 18
because 18
i 18
think 18
it 18
makes 18
him 18
look 18
stupid 18
inexplicably 18
everyone 18
here 18
thinks 18
hes 18
clever 18
and 18
delightful 18
im 18
even 18
issued 18
a 18
special 18
set 18
of 18
batteriesan 18
enormous 18
wasteto 18
be 18
used 18
for 18
this 18
purpose 18
the 18
citizens 18
of 18
are 18
truly 18
starved 18
for 18
entertainment 18
its 18
on 18
the 18
third 18
night 18
during 18
our 18
game 18
that 18
i 18
answer 18
the 18
question 18
eating 18
away 18
at 18
me 18
crazy 18
cat 18
becomes 18
a 18
metaphor 18
for 18
my 18
situation 18
i 18
am 18
buttercup 18
peeta 18
the 18
thing 18
i 18
want 18
so 18
badly 18
to 18
secure 18
is 18
the 18
light 18
as 18
long 18
as 18
buttercup 18
feels 18
he 18
has 18
the 18
chance 18
of 18
catching 18
the 18
elusive 18
light 18
under 18
his 18
paws 18
hes 18
bristling 18
with 18
aggression 18
thats 18
how 18
ive 18
been 18
since 18
i 18
left 18
the 18
arena 18
with 18
peeta 18
alive 18
when 18
the 18
light 18
goes 18
out 18
completely 18
buttercups 18
temporarily 18
distraught 18
and 18
confused 18
but 18
he 18
recovers 18
and 18
moves 18
on 18
to 18
other 18
things 18
thats 18
what 18
would 18
happen 18
if 18
peeta 18
died 18
but 18
the 18
one 18
thing 18
that 18
sends 18
buttercup 18
into 18
a 18
tailspin 18
is 18
when 18
i 18
leave 18
the 18
light 18
on 18
but 18
put 18
it 18
hopelessly 18
out 18
of 18
his 18
reach 18
high 18
on 18
the 18
wall 18
beyond 18
even 18
his 18
jumping 18
skills 18
he 18
paces 18
below 18
the 18
wall 18
wails 18
and 18
cant 18
be 18
comforted 18
or 18
distracted 18
hes 18
useless 18
until 18
i 18
shut 18
the 18
light 18
off 18
thats 18
what 18
snow 18
is 18
trying 18
to 18
do 18
to 18
me 18
now 18
only 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
form 18
his 18
game 18
takes 18
maybe 18
this 18
realization 18
on 18
my 18
part 18
is 18
all 18
snow 18
needs 18
thinking 18
that 18
peeta 18
was 18
in 18
his 18
possession 18
and 18
being 18
tortured 18
for 18
rebel 18
information 18
was 18
bad 18
but 18
thinking 18
that 18
hes 18
being 18
tortured 18
specifically 18
to 18
incapacitate 18
me 18
is 18
unendurable 18
and 18
its 18
under 18
the 18
weight 18
of 18
this 18
revelation 18
that 18
i 18
truly 18
begin 18
to 18
break 18
after 18
crazy 18
cat 18
were 18
directed 18
to 18
bed 18
the 18
powers 18
been 18
coming 18
and 18
going 18
sometimes 18
the 18
lamps 18
burn 18
at 18
full 18
brightness 18
other 18
times 18
we 18
squint 18
at 18
one 18
another 18
in 18
the 18
brownouts 18
at 18
bedtime 18
they 18
turn 18
the 18
lamps 18
to 18
near 18
darkness 18
and 18
activate 18
safety 18
lights 18
in 18
each 18
space 18
prim 18
whos 18
decided 18
the 18
walls 18
will 18
hold 18
up 18
snuggles 18
with 18
buttercup 18
on 18
the 18
lower 18
bunk 18
my 18
mothers 18
on 18
the 18
upper 18
i 18
offer 18
to 18
take 18
a 18
bunk 18
but 18
they 18
make 18
me 18
keep 18
to 18
the 18
floor 18
mattress 18
since 18
i 18
flail 18
around 18
so 18
much 18
when 18
im 18
sleeping 18
im 18
not 18
flailing 18
now 18
as 18
my 18
muscles 18
are 18
rigid 18
with 18
the 18
tension 18
of 18
holding 18
myself 18
together 18
the 18
pain 18
over 18
my 18
heart 18
returns 18
and 18
from 18
it 18
i 18
imagine 18
tiny 18
fissures 18
spreading 18
out 18
into 18
my 18
body 18
through 18
my 18
torso 18
down 18
my 18
arms 18
and 18
legs 18
over 18
my 18
face 18
leaving 18
it 18
crisscrossed 18
with 18
cracks 18
one 18
good 18
jolt 18
of 18
a 18
bunker 18
missile 18
and 18
i 18
could 18
shatter 18
into 18
strange 18
razorsharp 18
shards 18
when 18
the 18
restless 18
wiggling 18
majority 18
has 18
settled 18
into 18
sleep 18
i 18
carefully 18
extricate 18
myself 18
from 18
my 18
blanket 18
and 18
tiptoe 18
through 18
the 18
cavern 18
until 18
i 18
find 18
finnick 18
feeling 18
for 18
some 18
unspecified 18
reason 18
that 18
he 18
will 18
understand 18
he 18
sits 18
under 18
the 18
safety 18
light 18
in 18
his 18
space 18
knotting 18
his 18
rope 18
not 18
even 18
pretending 18
to 18
rest 18
as 18
i 18
whisper 18
my 18
discovery 18
of 18
snows 18
plan 18
to 18
break 18
me 18
it 18
dawns 18
on 18
me 18
this 18
strategy 18
is 18
very 18
old 18
news 18
to 18
finnick 18
its 18
what 18
broke 18
him 18
this 18
is 18
what 18
theyre 18
doing 18
to 18
you 18
with 18
annie 18
isnt 18
it 18
i 18
ask 18
well 18
they 18
didnt 18
arrest 18
her 18
because 18
they 18
thought 18
shed 18
be 18
a 18
wealth 18
of 18
rebel 18
information 18
he 18
says 18
they 18
know 18
id 18
never 18
have 18
risked 18
telling 18
her 18
anything 18
like 18
that 18
for 18
her 18
own 18
protection 18
oh 18
finnick 18
im 18
so 18
sorry 18
i 18

no 18
im 18
sorry 18
that 18
i 18
didnt 18
warn 18
you 18
somehow 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
suddenly 18
a 18
memory 18
surfaces 18
im 18
strapped 18
to 18
my 18
bed 18
mad 18
with 18
rage 18
and 18
grief 18
after 18
the 18
rescue 18
finnick 18
is 18
trying 18
to 18
console 18
me 18
about 18
peeta 18
theyll 18
figure 18
out 18
he 18
doesnt 18
know 18
anything 18
pretty 18
fast 18
and 18
they 18
wont 18
kill 18
him 18
if 18
they 18
think 18
they 18
can 18
use 18
him 18
against 18
you 18
you 18
did 18
warn 18
me 18
though 18
on 18
the 18
hovercraft 18
only 18
when 18
you 18
said 18
theyd 18
use 18
peeta 18
against 18
me 18
i 18
thought 18
you 18
meant 18
like 18
bait 18
to 18
lure 18
me 18
into 18
the 18
capitol 18
somehow 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
have 18
said 18
even 18
that 18
it 18
was 18
too 18
late 18
for 18
it 18
to 18
be 18
of 18
any 18
help 18
to 18
you 18
since 18
i 18
hadnt 18
warned 18
you 18
before 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
i 18
shouldve 18
shut 18
up 18
about 18
how 18
snow 18
operates 18
finnick 18
yanks 18
on 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
his 18
rope 18
and 18
an 18
intricate 18
knot 18
becomes 18
a 18
straight 18
line 18
again 18
its 18
just 18
that 18
i 18
didnt 18
understand 18
when 18
i 18
met 18
you 18
after 18
your 18
first 18
games 18
i 18
thought 18
the 18
whole 18
romance 18
was 18
an 18
act 18
on 18
your 18
part 18
we 18
all 18
expected 18
youd 18
continue 18
that 18
strategy 18
but 18
it 18
wasnt 18
until 18
peeta 18
hit 18
the 18
force 18
field 18
and 18
nearly 18
died 18
that 18
i 18
finnick 18
hesitates 18
i 18
think 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
arena 18
how 18
i 18
sobbed 18
when 18
finnick 18
revived 18
peeta 18
the 18
quizzical 18
look 18
on 18
finnicks 18
face 18
the 18
way 18
he 18
excused 18
my 18
behavior 18
blaming 18
it 18
on 18
my 18
pretend 18
pregnancy 18
that 18
you 18
what 18
that 18
i 18
knew 18
id 18
misjudged 18
you 18
that 18
you 18
do 18
love 18
him 18
im 18
not 18
saying 18
in 18
what 18
way 18
maybe 18
you 18
dont 18
know 18
yourself 18
but 18
anyone 18
paying 18
attention 18
could 18
see 18
how 18
much 18
you 18
care 18
about 18
him 18
he 18
says 18
gently 18
anyone 18
on 18
snows 18
visit 18
before 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
he 18
challenged 18
me 18
to 18
erase 18
any 18
doubts 18
of 18
my 18
love 18
for 18
peeta 18
convince 18
me 18
snow 18
said 18
it 18
seems 18
under 18
that 18
hot 18
pink 18
sky 18
with 18
peetas 18
life 18
in 18
limbo 18
i 18
finally 18
did 18
and 18
in 18
doing 18
so 18
i 18
gave 18
him 18
the 18
weapon 18
he 18
needed 18
to 18
break 18
me 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
sit 18
for 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
in 18
silence 18
watching 18
the 18
knots 18
bloom 18
and 18
vanish 18
before 18
i 18
can 18
ask 18
how 18
do 18
you 18
bear 18
it 18
finnick 18
looks 18
at 18
me 18
in 18
disbelief 18
i 18
dont 18
katniss 18
obviously 18
i 18
dont 18
i 18
drag 18
myself 18
out 18
of 18
nightmares 18
each 18
morning 18
and 18
find 18
theres 18
no 18
relief 18
in 18
waking 18
something 18
in 18
my 18
expression 18
stops 18
him 18
better 18
not 18
to 18
give 18
in 18
to 18
it 18
it 18
takes 18
ten 18
times 18
as 18
long 18
to 18
put 18
yourself 18
back 18
together 18
as 18
it 18
does 18
to 18
fall 18
apart 18
well 18
he 18
must 18
know 18
i 18
take 18
a 18
deep 18
breath 18
forcing 18
myself 18
back 18
into 18
one 18
piece 18
the 18
more 18
you 18
can 18
distract 18
yourself 18
the 18
better 18
he 18
says 18
first 18
thing 18
tomorrow 18
well 18
get 18
you 18
your 18
own 18
rope 18
until 18
then 18
take 18
mine 18
i 18
spend 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
night 18
on 18
my 18
mattress 18
obsessively 18
making 18
knots 18
holding 18
them 18
up 18
for 18
buttercups 18
inspection 18
if 18
one 18
looks 18
suspicious 18
he 18
swipes 18
it 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
air 18
and 18
bites 18
it 18
a 18
few 18
times 18
to 18
make 18
sure 18
its 18
dead 18
by 18
morning 18
my 18
fingers 18
are 18
sore 18
but 18
im 18
still 18
holding 18
on 18
with 18
twentyfour 18
hours 18
of 18
quiet 18
behind 18
us 18
coin 18
finally 18
announces 18
we 18
can 18
leave 18
the 18
bunker 18
our 18
old 18
quarters 18
have 18
been 18
destroyed 18
by 18
the 18
bombings 18
everyone 18
must 18
follow 18
exact 18
directions 18
to 18
their 18
new 18
compartments 18
we 18
clean 18
our 18
spaces 18
as 18
directed 18
and 18
file 18
obediently 18
toward 18
the 18
door 18
before 18
im 18
halfway 18
there 18
boggs 18
appears 18
and 18
pulls 18
me 18
from 18
the 18
line 18
he 18
signals 18
for 18
gale 18
and 18
finnick 18
to 18
join 18
us 18
people 18
move 18
aside 18
to 18
let 18
us 18
by 18
some 18
even 18
smile 18
at 18
me 18
since 18
the 18
crazy 18
cat 18
game 18
seems 18
to 18
have 18
made 18
me 18
more 18
lovable 18
out 18
the 18
door 18
up 18
the 18
stairs 18
down 18
the 18
hall 18
to 18
one 18
of 18
those 18
multidirectional 18
elevators 18
and 18
finally 18
we 18
arrive 18
at 18
special 18
defense 18
nothing 18
along 18
our 18
route 18
has 18
been 18
damaged 18
but 18
we 18
are 18
still 18
very 18
deep 18
boggs 18
ushers 18
us 18
into 18
a 18
room 18
virtually 18
identical 18
to 18
command 18
coin 18
plutarch 18
haymitch 18
cressida 18
and 18
everybody 18

around 18
the 18

looks 18
exhausted 18
someone 18
has 18
finally 18
broken 18
out 18
the 18
coffeealthough 18
im 18
sure 18
its 18
viewed 18
only 18
as 18
an 18
emergency 18
stimulantand 18
plutarch 18
has 18
both 18
hands 18
wrapped 18
tightly 18
around 18
his 18
cup 18
as 18
if 18
at 18
any 18
moment 18
it 18
might 18
be 18
taken 18
away 18

no 18

up 18
and 18
aboveground 18

the 18
president 18
you 18

two 18
hours 18
to 18
get 18
footage 18
showing 18
the 18
damage 18
from 18
the 18
bombing 18

that 18
thirteens 18
military 18
unit 18
remains 18
not 18
only 18
functional 18
but 18
dominant 18
and 18
most 18
important 18
that 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
is 18
still 18
alive 18
any 18
questions 18
can 18
we 18
have 18
a 18
coffee 18
asks 18
finnick 18
steaming 18
cups 18
are 18
handed 18
out 18
i 18
stare 18
distastefully 18
at 18
the 18
shiny 18
black 18
liquid 18
never 18
having 18
been 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
fan 18
of 18
the 18
stuff 18
but 18
thinking 18
it 18
might 18
help 18
me 18
stay 18
on 18
my 18
feet 18
finnick 18
sloshes 18
some 18
cream 18
in 18
my 18
cup 18
and 18
reaches 18
into 18
the 18
sugar 18
bowl 18
want 18
a 18
sugar 18
cube 18
he 18
asks 18
in 18
his 18
old 18
seductive 18
voice 18
thats 18
how 18
we 18
met 18
with 18
finnick 18
offering 18
me 18
sugar 18
surrounded 18
by 18
horses 18
and 18
chariots 18
costumed 18
and 18
painted 18
for 18
the 18
crowds 18
before 18
we 18
were 18
allies 18
before 18
i 18
had 18
any 18
idea 18
what 18
made 18
him 18
tick 18
the 18
memory 18
actually 18
coaxes 18
a 18
smile 18
out 18
of 18
me 18
here 18
it 18
improves 18
the 18
taste 18
he 18
says 18
in 18
his 18
real 18
voice 18
plunking 18
three 18
cubes 18
in 18
my 18
cup 18
as 18
i 18
turn 18
to 18
go 18
suit 18
up 18
as 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
i 18
catch 18
gale 18
watching 18
me 18
and 18
finnick 18
unhappily 18
what 18
now 18
does 18
he 18
actually 18
think 18
somethings 18
going 18
on 18
between 18
us 18
maybe 18
he 18
saw 18
me 18
go 18
to 18
finnicks 18
last 18
night 18
i 18
wouldve 18
passed 18
the 18
hawthornes 18
space 18
to 18
get 18
there 18
i 18
guess 18
that 18
probably 18
rubbed 18
him 18
the 18
wrong 18
way 18
me 18
seeking 18
out 18
finnicks 18
company 18
instead 18
of 18
his 18
well 18
fine 18
ive 18
got 18
rope 18
burn 18
on 18
my 18
fingers 18
i 18
can 18
barely 18
hold 18
my 18
eyes 18
open 18
and 18
a 18
camera 18
crews 18
waiting 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
do 18
something 18
brilliant 18
and 18
snows 18
got 18
peeta 18
gale 18
can 18
think 18
whatever 18
he 18
wants 18
in 18
my 18
new 18
remake 18
room 18
in 18
special 18
defense 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
slaps 18
me 18
into 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
suit 18
arranges 18
my 18
hair 18
and 18
applies 18
minimal 18
makeup 18
before 18
my 18
coffees 18
even 18
cooled 18
in 18
ten 18
minutes 18
the 18
cast 18
and 18
crew 18
of 18
the 18
next 18
propos 18
are 18
making 18
the 18
circuitous 18
trek 18
to 18
the 18
outside 18
i 18
slurp 18
my 18
coffee 18
as 18
we 18
travel 18
finding 18
that 18
the 18
cream 18
and 18
sugar 18
greatly 18
enhance 18
its 18
flavor 18
as 18
i 18
knock 18
back 18
the 18
dregs 18
that 18
have 18
settled 18
to 18
the 18
bottom 18
of 18
the 18
cup 18
i 18
feel 18
a 18
slight 18
buzz 18
start 18
to 18
run 18
through 18
my 18
veins 18
after 18
climbing 18
a 18
final 18
ladder 18
boggs 18
hits 18
a 18
lever 18
that 18
opens 18
a 18
trapdoor 18
fresh 18
air 18
rushes 18
in 18
i 18
take 18
big 18
gulps 18
and 18
for 18
the 18
first 18
time 18
allow 18
myself 18
to 18
feel 18
how 18
much 18
i 18
hated 18
the 18
bunker 18
we 18
emerge 18
into 18
the 18
woods 18
and 18
my 18
hands 18
run 18
through 18
the 18
leaves 18
overhead 18
some 18
are 18
just 18
starting 18
to 18
turn 18
what 18
day 18
is 18
it 18
i 18
ask 18
no 18
one 18
in 18
particular 18
boggs 18
tells 18
me 18
september 18
begins 18
next 18
week 18
september 18
that 18
means 18
snow 18
has 18
had 18
peeta 18
in 18
his 18
clutches 18
for 18
five 18
maybe 18
six 18
weeks 18
i 18
examine 18
a 18
leaf 18
on 18
my 18
palm 18
and 18
see 18
im 18
shaking 18
i 18
cant 18
will 18
myself 18
to 18
stop 18
i 18
blame 18
the 18
coffee 18
and 18
try 18
to 18
focus 18
on 18
slowing 18
my 18
breathing 18
which 18
is 18
far 18
too 18
rapid 18
for 18
my 18
pace 18
debris 18
begins 18
to 18
litter 18
the 18
forest 18
floor 18
we 18
come 18
to 18
our 18
first 18
crater 18
thirty 18
yards 18
wide 18
and 18
i 18
cant 18
tell 18
how 18
deep 18
very 18
boggs 18
says 18
anyone 18
on 18
the 18
first 18
ten 18
levels 18
would 18
likely 18
have 18
been 18
killed 18
we 18
skirt 18
the 18
pit 18
and 18
continue 18
on 18
can 18
you 18
rebuild 18
it 18
gale 18
asks 18
not 18
anytime 18
soon 18
that 18
one 18
didnt 18
get 18
much 18
a 18
few 18
backup 18
generators 18
and 18
a 18
poultry 18
farm 18
says 18
boggs 18
well 18
just 18
seal 18
it 18
off 18
the 18
trees 18
disappear 18
as 18
we 18
enter 18
the 18
area 18
inside 18
the 18
fence 18
the 18
craters 18
are 18
ringed 18
with 18
a 18
mixture 18
of 18
old 18
and 18
new 18
rubble 18
before 18
the 18
bombing 18

it 18
even 18
that 18
was 18
never 18
meant 18
to 18
withstand 18
more 18
than 18
a 18
superficial 18
attack 18
how 18
much 18
of 18
an 18
edge 18
did 18

haymitch 18
about 18
ten 18
minutes 18

systems 18
wouldve 18
detected 18
the 18
missiles 18

boggs 18
but 18
it 18
did 18
help 18
right 18
i 18
ask 18
i 18

they 18
were 18
in 18
the 18
bunker 18
only 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
minutes 18
before 18
the 18
first 18
missile 18
hit 18
peeta 18

to 18
the 18

never 18
stop 18
owing 18
him 18
for 18
cressida 18
has 18
the 18
idea 18
to 18
film 18
me 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
the 18
ruins 18
of 18
the 18
old 18
justice 18
building 18
which 18
is 18
something 18
of 18
a 18
joke 18
since 18
the 18
capitols 18
been 18
using 18
it 18
as 18
a 18
backdrop 18
for 18
fake 18
news 18
broadcasts 18
for 18
years 18
to 18
show 18
that 18
the 18
district 18
no 18
longer 18
existed 18
now 18
with 18
the 18
recent 18
attack 18
the 18
justice 18
building 18
sits 18
about 18
ten 18
yards 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
edge 18
of 18
a 18
new 18
crater 18
as 18
we 18
approach 18
what 18
used 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
grand 18
entrance 18
gale 18
points 18
out 18
something 18
and 18
the 18
whole 18
party 18
slows 18
down 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
the 18
problem 18
is 18
at 18
first 18
and 18
then 18
i 18
see 18
the 18
ground 18
strewn 18
with 18
fresh 18
pink 18
and 18
red 18
roses 18
dont 18
touch 18
them 18
i 18
yell 18
theyre 18
for 18
me 18
the 18
sickeningly 18
sweet 18
smell 18
hits 18
my 18
nose 18
and 18
my 18
heart 18
begins 18
to 18
hammer 18
against 18
my 18
chest 18
so 18
i 18
didnt 18
imagine 18
it 18
the 18
rose 18
on 18
my 18
dresser 18
before 18
me 18
lies 18
snows 18
second 18
delivery 18
longstemmed 18
pink 18
and 18
red 18
beauties 18
the 18
very 18
flowers 18
that 18
decorated 18
the 18
set 18
where 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
performed 18
our 18
postvictory 18
interview 18
flowers 18
not 18
meant 18
for 18
one 18
but 18
for 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
lovers 18
i 18
explain 18
to 18
the 18
others 18
as 18
best 18
i 18
can 18
upon 18
inspection 18
they 18
appear 18
to 18
be 18
harmless 18
if 18
genetically 18
enhanced 18
flowers 18
two 18
dozen 18
roses 18
slightly 18
wilted 18
most 18
likely 18
dropped 18
after 18
the 18
last 18
bombing 18
a 18
crew 18
in 18
special 18
suits 18
collects 18
them 18
and 18
carts 18
them 18
away 18
i 18
feel 18
certain 18
they 18
will 18
find 18
nothing 18
extraordinary 18
in 18
them 18
though 18
snow 18
knows 18
exactly 18
what 18
hes 18
doing 18
to 18
me 18
its 18
like 18
having 18
cinna 18
beaten 18
to 18
a 18
pulp 18
while 18
i 18
watch 18
from 18
my 18
tribute 18
tube 18
designed 18
to 18
unhinge 18
me 18
like 18
then 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
rally 18
and 18
fight 18
back 18
but 18
as 18
cressida 18
gets 18
castor 18
and 18
pollux 18
in 18
place 18
i 18
feel 18
my 18
anxiety 18
building 18
im 18
so 18
tired 18
so 18
wired 18
and 18
so 18
unable 18
to 18
keep 18
my 18
mind 18
on 18
anything 18
but 18
peeta 18
since 18
ive 18
seen 18
the 18
roses 18
the 18
coffee 18
was 18
a 18
huge 18
mistake 18
what 18
i 18
didnt 18
need 18
was 18
a 18
stimulant 18
my 18
body 18
visibly 18
shakes 18
and 18
i 18
cant 18
seem 18
to 18
catch 18
my 18
breath 18
after 18
days 18
in 18
the 18
bunker 18
im 18
squinting 18
no 18
matter 18
what 18
direction 18
i 18
turn 18
and 18
the 18
light 18
hurts 18
even 18
in 18
the 18
cool 18
breeze 18
sweat 18
trickles 18
down 18
my 18
face 18
so 18
what 18
exactly 18
do 18
you 18
need 18
from 18
me 18
again 18
i 18
ask 18
just 18
a 18
few 18
quick 18
lines 18
that 18
show 18
youre 18
alive 18
and 18
still 18
fighting 18
says 18
cressida 18
okay 18
i 18
take 18
my 18
position 18
and 18
then 18
im 18
staring 18
into 18
the 18
red 18
light 18
staring 18
staring 18
im 18
sorry 18
ive 18
got 18
nothing 18
cressida 18
walks 18
up 18
to 18
me 18
you 18
feeling 18
okay 18
i 18
nod 18
she 18
pulls 18
a 18
small 18
cloth 18
from 18
her 18
pocket 18
and 18
blots 18
my 18
face 18
how 18

do 18
the 18
old 18
qanda 18
thing 18
yeah 18

would 18
help 18
i 18
think 18
i 18
cross 18
my 18
arms 18
to 18
hide 18
the 18
shaking 18
glance 18
at 18
finnick 18
who 18
gives 18
me 18
a 18
thumbsup 18
but 18
hes 18
looking 18
pretty 18
shaky 18
himself 18
cressidas 18
back 18
in 18
position 18
now 18
so 18

survived 18
the 18
capitol 18
bombing 18
of 18
thirteen 18
how 18
did 18
it 18
compare 18
with 18
what 18
you 18
experienced 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
in 18
eight 18
we 18
were 18
so 18
far 18
underground 18
this 18
time 18
there 18
was 18
no 18
real 18
danger 18
thirteens 18
alive 18
and 18
well 18
and 18
so 18
am 18
my 18
voice 18
cuts 18
off 18
in 18
a 18
dry 18
squeaking 18
sound 18
try 18
the 18
line 18

cressida 18
thirteens 18
alive 18
and 18
well 18
and 18
so 18
am 18
i 18

take 18
a 18
breath 18
trying 18
to 18
force 18
air 18
down 18
into 18
my 18
diaphragm 18
thirteens 18
alive 18
and 18
so 18

still 18
smell 18

arms 18

loosen 18
myself 18
up 18
place 18
my 18
fists 18
on 18
my 18
hips 18
then 18
drop 18
them 18
to 18
my 18
sides 18
salivas 18
filling 18
my 18
mouth 18
at 18
a 18
ridiculous 18
rate 18
and 18
i 18
feel 18
vomit 18
at 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
my 18
throat 18
i 18
swallow 18
hard 18
and 18
open 18
my 18
lips 18
so 18
i 18
can 18
get 18
the 18
stupid 18
line 18
out 18
and 18
go 18
hide 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
andthats 18
when 18
i 18
start 18
crying 18
its 18
impossible 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
impossible 18
to 18
complete 18
even 18
this 18
one 18
sentence 18
because 18
now 18
i 18
know 18
that 18
everything 18
i 18
say 18
will 18
be 18
directly 18
taken 18
out 18
on 18
peeta 18
result 18
in 18
his 18
torture 18
but 18
not 18
his 18
death 18
no 18
nothing 18
so 18
merciful 18
as 18
that 18
snow 18
will 18
ensure 18
that 18
his 18
life 18
is 18
much 18
worse 18
than 18
death 18
cut 18
i 18
hear 18
cressida 18
say 18
quietly 18
whats 18
wrong 18
with 18
her 18
plutarch 18
says 18
under 18
his 18
breath 18
shes 18
figured 18
out 18
how 18
snows 18
using 18
peeta 18
says 18
finnick 18
theres 18
something 18
like 18
a 18
collective 18
sigh 18
of 18
regret 18
from 18
the 18
semicircle 18
of 18
people 18
spread 18
out 18
before 18
me 18
because 18
i 18
know 18
this 18
now 18
because 18
there 18
will 18
never 18
be 18
a 18
way 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
not 18
know 18
this 18
again 18
because 18
beyond 18
the 18
military 18
disadvantage 18
losing 18
a 18
mockingjay 18
entails 18
i 18
am 18
broken 18
several 18
sets 18
of 18
arms 18
would 18
embrace 18
me 18
but 18
in 18
the 18
end 18
the 18
only 18
person 18
i 18
truly 18
want 18
to 18
comfort 18
me 18
is 18
haymitch 18
because 18
he 18
loves 18
peeta 18
too 18
i 18
reach 18
out 18
for 18
him 18
and 18
say 18
something 18
like 18
his 18
name 18
and 18
hes 18
there 18
holding 18
me 18
and 18
patting 18
my 18
back 18
its 18
okay 18
itll 18
be 18
okay 18
sweetheart 18
he 18
sits 18
me 18
on 18
a 18
length 18
of 18
broken 18
marble 18
pillar 18
and 18
keeps 18
an 18
arm 18
around 18
me 18
while 18
i 18
sob 18
i 18
cant 18
do 18
this 18
anymore 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
know 18
he 18
says 18
all 18
i 18
can 18
think 18
of 18
iswhat 18
hes 18
going 18
to 18
do 18
to 18
peeta 18
because 18
im 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
i 18
get 18
out 18
i 18
know 18
haymitchs 18
arm 18
tightens 18
around 18
me 18
did 18
you 18
see 18
how 18
weird 18
he 18
acted 18
what 18
are 18
they 18
doing 18
to 18
him 18
im 18
gasping 18
for 18
air 18
between 18
sobs 18
but 18
i 18
manage 18
one 18
last 18
phrase 18
its 18
my 18
fault 18
and 18
then 18
i 18
cross 18
some 18
line 18
into 18
hysteria 18
and 18
theres 18
a 18
needle 18
in 18
my 18
arm 18
and 18
the 18
world 18
slips 18
away 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
strong 18
whatever 18
they 18
shot 18
into 18
me 18
because 18
its 18
a 18
full 18
day 18
before 18
i 18
come 18
to 18
my 18
sleep 18
wasnt 18
peaceful 18
though 18
i 18
have 18
the 18
sense 18
of 18
emerging 18
from 18
a 18
world 18
of 18
dark 18
haunted 18
places 18
where 18
i 18
traveled 18
alone 18
haymitch 18
sits 18
in 18
the 18
chair 18
by 18
my 18
bed 18
his 18
skin 18
waxen 18
his 18
eyes 18
bloodshot 18
i 18
remember 18
about 18
peeta 18
and 18
start 18
to 18
tremble 18
again 18
haymitch 18
reaches 18
out 18
and 18
squeezes 18
my 18
shoulder 18
its 18
all 18

to 18
get 18
peeta 18

no 18
sense 18
plutarchs 18
sending 18
in 18
a 18
rescue 18
team 18
he 18
has 18
people 18
on 18
the 18
inside 18
he 18
thinks 18
we 18
can 18
get 18
peeta 18
back 18
alive 18
he 18
says 18
why 18
didnt 18
we 18
before 18
i 18
say 18
because 18
its 18
costly 18
but 18
everyone 18
agrees 18
this 18
is 18
the 18
thing 18
to 18
do 18
its 18
the 18
same 18
choice 18
we 18
made 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
to 18

a 18
sip 18
of 18
water 18
what 18

he 18
shrugs 18
covers 18

be 18
blown 18

really 18
excellent 18
shoot 18

in 18
the 18

my 18
way 18
through 18

out 18
on 18
his 18
stomach 18
his 18
hands 18
twisted 18
in 18
his 18
pillowcase 18
although 18
its 18
cowardlycruel 18
even 18
to 18
rouse 18
him 18
from 18
the 18
shadowy 18
muted 18
drug 18
land 18
to 18
stark 18
reality 18
i 18
go 18
ahead 18
and 18
do 18
it 18
because 18
i 18
cant 18
stand 18
to 18
face 18
this 18
by 18
myself 18
as 18

situation 18
his 18
initial 18
agitation 18
mysteriously 18
ebbs 18
dont 18
you 18
see 18
katniss 18
this 18
will 18
decide 18
things 18
one 18
way 18
or 18
the 18
other 18
by 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18

a 18
sunny 18
view 18
of 18
our 18
situation 18
and 18
yet 18
theres 18
something 18
calming 18
about 18
the 18
idea 18
that 18
this 18
torment 18
could 18
come 18
to 18
an 18
end 18
the 18

in 18
the 18
next 18
few 18
hours 18
beetee 18
can 18
air 18
it 18
leading 18
up 18
to 18
the 18
rescue 18
and 18
maybe 18
keep 18
the 18
capitols 18
attention 18
elsewhere 18
yes 18
a 18
distraction 18
says 18
finnick 18
a 18
decoy 18
of 18
sorts 18
what 18
we 18
really 18
need 18
is 18
something 18
so 18
riveting 18
that 18
even 18
president 18
snow 18
wont 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
tear 18
himself 18
away 18
got 18
anything 18
like 18
that 18
asks 18
haymitch 18
having 18
a 18
job 18
that 18
might 18
help 18
the 18
mission 18
snaps 18
me 18
into 18
focus 18
while 18
i 18
knock 18
down 18
breakfast 18
and 18
get 18
prepped 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
think 18
of 18
what 18
i 18
might 18
say 18
president 18
snow 18
must 18
be 18
wondering 18
how 18
that 18
bloodsplattered 18
floor 18
and 18
his 18
roses 18
are 18
affecting 18
me 18
if 18
he 18
wants 18
me 18
broken 18
then 18
i 18
will 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
whole 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
i 18
will 18
convince 18
him 18
of 18
anything 18
by 18
shouting 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
defiant 18
lines 18
at 18
the 18
camera 18
besides 18
that 18
wont 18
buy 18
the 18
rescue 18
team 18
any 18
time 18
outbursts 18
are 18
short 18
its 18
stories 18
that 18
take 18
time 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
if 18
it 18
will 18
work 18
but 18
when 18
the 18
television 18
crews 18
all 18
assembled 18
aboveground 18
i 18
ask 18
cressida 18
if 18
she 18
could 18
start 18
out 18
by 18
asking 18
me 18
about 18
peeta 18
i 18
take 18
a 18
seat 18
on 18
the 18
fallen 18
marble 18
pillar 18
where 18
i 18
had 18
my 18
breakdown 18
wait 18
for 18
the 18
red 18
light 18
and 18
cressidas 18
question 18
how 18
did 18
you 18
meet 18
peeta 18
she 18
asks 18
and 18
then 18
i 18
do 18
the 18
thing 18
that 18
haymitch 18
has 18
wanted 18
since 18
my 18
first 18
interview 18
i 18
open 18
up 18
when 18
i 18
met 18
peeta 18
i 18
was 18
eleven 18
years 18
old 18
and 18
i 18
was 18
almost 18
dead 18
i 18
talk 18
about 18
that 18
awful 18
day 18
when 18
i 18
tried 18
to 18
sell 18
the 18
baby 18
clothes 18
in 18
the 18
rain 18
how 18
peetas 18
mother 18
chased 18
me 18
from 18
the 18
bakery 18
door 18
and 18
how 18
he 18
took 18
a 18
beating 18
to 18
bring 18
me 18
the 18
loaves 18
of 18
bread 18
that 18
saved 18
our 18
lives 18
we 18
had 18
never 18
even 18
spoken 18
the 18
first 18
time 18
i 18
ever 18
talked 18
to 18
peeta 18
was 18
on 18
the 18
train 18
to 18
the 18
games 18
but 18
he 18
was 18
already 18
in 18
love 18
with 18
you 18
says 18
cressida 18
i 18
guess 18
so 18
i 18
allow 18
myself 18
a 18
small 18
smile 18
how 18
are 18
you 18
doing 18
with 18
the 18
separation 18
she 18
asks 18
not 18
well 18
i 18
know 18
at 18
any 18
moment 18
snow 18
could 18
kill 18
him 18
especially 18
since 18
he 18
warned 18
thirteen 18
about 18
the 18
bombing 18
its 18
a 18
terrible 18
thing 18
to 18
live 18
with 18
i 18
say 18
but 18
because 18
of 18
what 18
theyre 18
putting 18
him 18
through 18
i 18
dont 18
have 18
any 18
reservations 18
anymore 18
about 18
doing 18
whatever 18
it 18
takes 18
to 18
destroy 18
the 18
capitol 18
im 18
finally 18
free 18
i 18
turn 18
my 18
gaze 18
skyward 18
and 18
watch 18
the 18
flight 18
of 18
a 18
hawk 18
across 18
the 18
sky 18
president 18
snow 18
once 18
admitted 18
to 18
me 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
was 18
fragile 18
at 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
didnt 18
know 18
what 18
he 18
meant 18
it 18
was 18
hard 18
to 18
see 18
clearly 18
because 18
i 18
was 18
so 18
afraid 18
now 18
im 18
not 18
the 18
capitols 18
fragile 18
because 18
it 18
depends 18
on 18
the 18
districts 18
for 18
everything 18
food 18
energy 18
even 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
that 18
police 18
us 18
if 18
we 18
declare 18
our 18
freedom 18
the 18
capitol 18
collapses 18
president 18
snow 18
thanks 18
to 18
you 18
im 18
officially 18
declaring 18
mine 18
today 18
ive 18
been 18
sufficient 18
if 18
not 18
dazzling 18
everyone 18
loves 18
the 18
bread 18
story 18
but 18
its 18
my 18
message 18
to 18
president 18
snow 18
that 18
gets 18
the 18
wheels 18
spinning 18
in 18
plutarchs 18
brain 18
he 18
hastily 18
calls 18
finnick 18
and 18
haymitch 18
over 18
and 18
they 18
have 18
a 18
brief 18
but 18
intense 18
conversation 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
haymitch 18
isnt 18
happy 18
with 18
plutarch 18
seems 18
to 18
winfinnicks 18
pale 18
but 18
nodding 18
his 18
head 18
by 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
it 18
as 18
finnick 18
moves 18
to 18
take 18
my 18
seat 18
before 18
the 18
camera 18
haymitch 18
tells 18
him 18
you 18
dont 18
have 18
to 18
do 18
this 18
yes 18
i 18
do 18
if 18
it 18
will 18
help 18
her 18
finnick 18
balls 18
up 18
his 18
rope 18
in 18
his 18
hand 18
im 18
ready 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
expect 18
a 18
love 18
story 18
about 18
annie 18
an 18
account 18
of 18
the 18
abuses 18
in 18
district 18
but 18
finnick 18
odair 18
takes 18
a 18
completely 18
different 18
tack 18
president 18
snow 18
used 18
tosell 18
memy 18
body 18
that 18
is 18
finnick 18
begins 18
in 18
a 18
flat 18
removed 18
tone 18
i 18
wasnt 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
if 18
a 18
victor 18
is 18
considered 18
desirable 18
the 18
president 18
gives 18
them 18
as 18
a 18
reward 18
or 18
allows 18
people 18
to 18
buy 18
them 18
for 18
an 18
exorbitant 18
amount 18
of 18
money 18
if 18
you 18
refuse 18
he 18
kills 18
someone 18
you 18
love 18
so 18
you 18
do 18
it 18
that 18
explains 18
it 18
then 18
finnicks 18
parade 18
of 18
lovers 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
they 18
were 18
never 18
real 18
lovers 18
just 18
people 18
like 18
our 18
old 18
head 18
peacekeeper 18
cray 18
who 18
bought 18
desperate 18
girls 18
to 18
devour 18
and 18
discard 18
because 18
he 18
could 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
interrupt 18
the 18
taping 18
and 18
beg 18
finnicks 18
forgiveness 18
for 18
every 18
false 18
thought 18
ive 18
ever 18
had 18
about 18
him 18
but 18
we 18
have 18
a 18
job 18
to 18
do 18
and 18
i 18
sense 18
finnicks 18
role 18
will 18
be 18
far 18
more 18
effective 18
than 18
mine 18
i 18
wasnt 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
but 18
i 18
was 18
the 18
most 18
popular 18
he 18
says 18
and 18
perhaps 18
the 18
most 18
defenseless 18
because 18
the 18
people 18
i 18
loved 18
were 18
so 18
defenseless 18
to 18
make 18
themselves 18
feel 18
better 18
my 18
patrons 18
would 18
make 18
presents 18
of 18
money 18
or 18
jewelry 18
but 18
i 18
found 18
a 18
much 18
more 18
valuable 18
form 18
of 18
payment 18
secrets 18
i 18
think 18
thats 18
what 18
finnick 18
told 18
me 18
his 18
lovers 18
paid 18
him 18
in 18
only 18
i 18
thought 18
the 18
whole 18
arrangement 18
was 18
by 18
his 18
choice 18
secrets 18
he 18
says 18
echoing 18
my 18
thoughts 18
and 18
this 18
is 18
where 18
youre 18
going 18
to 18
want 18
to 18
stay 18
tuned 18
president 18
snow 18
because 18
so 18
very 18
many 18
of 18
them 18
were 18
about 18
you 18
but 18
lets 18
begin 18
with 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
others 18
finnick 18
begins 18
to 18
weave 18
a 18
tapestry 18
so 18
rich 18
in 18
detail 18
that 18
you 18
cant 18
doubt 18
its 18
authenticity 18
tales 18
of 18
strange 18
sexual 18
appetites 18
betrayals 18
of 18
the 18
heart 18
bottomless 18
greed 18
and 18
bloody 18
power 18
plays 18
drunken 18
secrets 18
whispered 18
over 18
damp 18
pillowcases 18
in 18
the 18
dead 18
of 18
night 18
finnick 18
was 18
someone 18
bought 18
and 18
sold 18
a 18
district 18
slave 18
a 18
handsome 18
one 18
certainly 18
but 18
in 18
reality 18
harmless 18
who 18
would 18
he 18
tell 18
and 18
who 18
would 18
believe 18
him 18
if 18
he 18
did 18
but 18
some 18
secrets 18
are 18
too 18
delicious 18
not 18
to 18
share 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
the 18
people 18
finnick 18
namesall 18
seem 18
to 18
be 18
prominent 18
capitol 18
citizensbut 18
i 18
know 18
from 18
listening 18
to 18
the 18
chatter 18
of 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
the 18
attention 18
the 18
most 18
mild 18
slip 18
in 18
judgment 18
can 18
draw 18
if 18
a 18
bad 18
haircut 18
can 18
lead 18
to 18
hours 18
of 18
gossip 18
what 18
will 18
charges 18
of 18
incest 18
backstabbing 18
blackmail 18
and 18
arson 18
produce 18
even 18
as 18
the 18
waves 18
of 18
shock 18
and 18
recrimination 18
roll 18
over 18
the 18
capitol 18
the 18
people 18
there 18
will 18
be 18
waiting 18
as 18
i 18
am 18
now 18
to 18
hear 18
about 18
the 18
president 18
and 18
now 18
on 18
to 18
our 18
good 18
president 18
coriolanus 18
snow 18
says 18
finnick 18
such 18
a 18
young 18
man 18
when 18
he 18
rose 18
to 18
power 18
such 18
a 18
clever 18
one 18
to 18
keep 18
it 18
how 18
you 18
must 18
ask 18
yourself 18
did 18
he 18
do 18
it 18
one 18
word 18
thats 18
all 18
you 18
really 18
need 18
to 18
know 18
poison 18
finnick 18
goes 18
back 18
to 18
snows 18
political 18
ascension 18
which 18
i 18
know 18
nothing 18
of 18
and 18
works 18
his 18
way 18
up 18
to 18
the 18
present 18
pointing 18
out 18
case 18
after 18
case 18
of 18
the 18
mysterious 18
deaths 18
of 18
snows 18
adversaries 18
or 18
even 18
worse 18
his 18
allies 18
who 18
had 18
the 18
potential 18
to 18
become 18
threats 18
people 18
dropping 18
dead 18
at 18
a 18
feast 18
or 18
slowly 18
inexplicably 18
declining 18
into 18
shadows 18
over 18
a 18
period 18
of 18
months 18
blamed 18
on 18
bad 18
shellfish 18
elusive 18
viruses 18
or 18
an 18
overlooked 18
weakness 18
in 18
the 18
aorta 18
snow 18
drinking 18
from 18
the 18
poisoned 18
cup 18
himself 18
to 18
deflect 18
suspicion 18
but 18
antidotes 18
dont 18
always 18
work 18
they 18
say 18
thats 18
why 18
he 18
wears 18
the 18
roses 18
that 18
reek 18
of 18
perfume 18
they 18
say 18
its 18
to 18
cover 18
the 18
scent 18
of 18
blood 18
from 18
the 18
mouth 18
sores 18
that 18
will 18
never 18
heal 18
they 18
say 18
they 18
say 18
they 18
saysnow 18
has 18
a 18
list 18
and 18
no 18
one 18
knows 18
who 18
will 18
be 18
next 18
poison 18
the 18
perfect 18
weapon 18
for 18
a 18
snake 18
since 18
my 18
opinion 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
its 18
noble 18
president 18
are 18
already 18
so 18
low 18
i 18
cant 18
say 18
finnicks 18
allegations 18
shock 18
me 18
they 18
seem 18
to 18
have 18
far 18
more 18
effect 18
on 18
the 18
displaced 18
capitol 18
rebels 18
like 18
my 18
crew 18
and 18
fulviaeven 18
plutarch 18
occasionally 18
reacts 18
in 18
surprise 18
maybe 18
wondering 18
how 18
a 18
specific 18
tidbit 18
passed 18
him 18
by 18
when 18
finnick 18
finishes 18
they 18
just 18
keep 18
the 18
cameras 18
rolling 18
until 18
finally 18
he 18
has 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
one 18
to 18
say 18
cut 18
the 18
crew 18
hurries 18
inside 18
to 18
edit 18
the 18
material 18
and 18
plutarch 18
leads 18
finnick 18
off 18
for 18
a 18
chat 18
probably 18
to 18
see 18
if 18
he 18
has 18
any 18
more 18
stories 18
im 18
left 18
with 18
haymitch 18
in 18
the 18
rubble 18
wondering 18
if 18
finnicks 18
fate 18
would 18
have 18
one 18
day 18
been 18
mine 18
why 18
not 18
snow 18
could 18
have 18
gotten 18
a 18
really 18
good 18
price 18
for 18
the 18
girl 18
on 18
fire 18
is 18
that 18
what 18
happened 18
to 18
you 18
i 18
ask 18
haymitch 18
no 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
younger 18
brother 18
my 18
girl 18
they 18
were 18
all 18
dead 18
two 18
weeks 18
after 18
i 18
was 18
crowned 18
victor 18
because 18
of 18
that 18
stunt 18
i 18
pulled 18
with 18
the 18
force 18
field 18
he 18
answers 18
snow 18
had 18
no 18
one 18
to 18
use 18
against 18
me 18
im 18
surprised 18
he 18
didnt 18
just 18
kill 18
you 18
i 18
say 18
oh 18
no 18
i 18
was 18
the 18
example 18
the 18
person 18
to 18
hold 18
up 18
to 18
the 18
young 18
finnicks 18
and 18
johannas 18
and 18
cashmeres 18
of 18
what 18
could 18
happen 18
to 18
a 18
victor 18
who 18
caused 18
problems 18
says 18
haymitch 18
but 18
he 18
knew 18
he 18
had 18
no 18
leverage 18
against 18
me 18
until 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
came 18
along 18
i 18
say 18
softly 18
i 18
dont 18
even 18
get 18
a 18
shrug 18
in 18
return 18
with 18
our 18
job 18
done 18
theres 18
nothing 18
left 18
for 18
finnick 18
and 18
me 18
to 18
do 18
but 18
wait 18
we 18
try 18
to 18
fill 18
the 18
dragging 18
minutes 18
in 18
special 18
defense 18
tie 18
knots 18
push 18
our 18
lunch 18
around 18
our 18
bowls 18
blow 18
things 18
up 18
on 18
the 18
shooting 18
range 18
because 18
of 18
the 18
danger 18
of 18
detection 18
no 18
communication 18
comes 18
from 18
the 18
rescue 18
team 18
at 18
the 18
designated 18
hour 18
we 18
stand 18
tense 18
and 18
silent 18
in 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
a 18
room 18
full 18
of 18
screens 18
and 18
computers 18
and 18
watch 18
beetee 18
and 18
his 18
team 18
try 18
to 18
dominate 18
the 18
airwaves 18
his 18
usual 18
fidgety 18
distraction 18
is 18
replaced 18
with 18
a 18
determination 18
i 18
have 18
never 18
seen 18
most 18
of 18
my 18
interview 18
doesnt 18
make 18
the 18
cut 18
just 18
enough 18
to 18
show 18
i 18
am 18
alive 18
and 18
still 18
defiant 18
it 18
is 18
finnicks 18
salacious 18
and 18
gory 18
account 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
that 18
takes 18
the 18
day 18
is 18
beetees 18
skill 18
improving 18
or 18
are 18
his 18
counterparts 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
a 18
little 18
too 18
fascinated 18
to 18
want 18
to 18
tune 18
finnick 18
out 18
for 18
the 18
next 18
sixty 18
minutes 18
the 18
capitol 18
feed 18
alternates 18
between 18
the 18
standard 18
afternoon 18
newscast 18
finnick 18
and 18
attempts 18
to 18
black 18
it 18
all 18
out 18
but 18
the 18
rebel 18
techno 18
team 18
manages 18
to 18
override 18
even 18
the 18
latter 18
and 18
in 18
a 18
real 18
coup 18
keeps 18
control 18
for 18
almost 18
the 18
entire 18
attack 18
on 18
snow 18
let 18
it 18
go 18
says 18
beetee 18
throwing 18
up 18
his 18
hands 18
relinquishing 18
the 18
broadcast 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
he 18
mops 18
his 18
face 18
with 18
a 18
cloth 18
if 18
theyre 18
not 18
out 18
of 18
there 18
by 18
now 18
theyre 18
all 18
dead 18
he 18
spins 18
in 18
his 18
chair 18
to 18
see 18
finnick 18
and 18
me 18
reacting 18
to 18
his 18
words 18
it 18
was 18
a 18
good 18
plan 18
though 18
did 18
plutarch 18
show 18
it 18
to 18
you 18
of 18
course 18
not 18
beetee 18
takes 18
us 18
to 18
another 18
room 18
and 18
shows 18
us 18
how 18
the 18
team 18
with 18
the 18
help 18
of 18
rebel 18
insiders 18
will 18
attempthas 18
attemptedto 18
free 18
the 18
victors 18
from 18
an 18
underground 18
prison 18
it 18
seems 18
to 18
have 18
involved 18
knockout 18
gas 18
distributed 18
by 18
the 18
ventilation 18
system 18
a 18
power 18
failure 18
the 18
detonation 18
of 18
a 18
bomb 18
in 18
a 18
government 18
building 18
several 18
miles 18
from 18
the 18
prison 18
and 18
now 18
the 18
disruption 18
of 18
the 18
broadcast 18
beetees 18
glad 18
we 18
find 18
the 18
plan 18
hard 18
to 18
follow 18
because 18
then 18
our 18
enemies 18
will 18
too 18
like 18
your 18
electricity 18
trap 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
i 18
ask 18
exactly 18
and 18
see 18
how 18
well 18
that 18
worked 18
out 18
says 18
beetee 18
wellnot 18
really 18
i 18
think 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
station 18
ourselves 18
in 18
command 18
where 18
surely 18
first 18
word 18
of 18
the 18
rescue 18
will 18
come 18
but 18
we 18
are 18
barred 18
because 18
serious 18
war 18
business 18
is 18
being 18
carried 18
out 18
we 18
refuse 18
to 18
leave 18
special 18
defense 18
and 18
end 18
up 18
waiting 18
in 18
the 18
hummingbird 18
room 18
for 18
news 18
making 18
knots 18
making 18
knots 18
no 18
word 18
making 18
knots 18
ticktock 18
this 18
is 18
a 18
clock 18
do 18
not 18
think 18
of 18
gale 18
do 18
not 18
think 18
of 18
peeta 18
making 18
knots 18
we 18
do 18
not 18
want 18
dinner 18
fingers 18
raw 18
and 18
bleeding 18
finnick 18
finally 18
gives 18
up 18
and 18
assumes 18
the 18
hunched 18
position 18
he 18
took 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
when 18
the 18
jabberjays 18
attacked 18
i 18
perfect 18
my 18
miniature 18
noose 18
the 18
words 18
of 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
replay 18
in 18
my 18
head 18
gale 18
and 18
peeta 18
peeta 18
and 18
gale 18
did 18
you 18
love 18
annie 18
right 18
away 18
finnick 18
i 18
ask 18
no 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
passes 18
before 18
he 18
adds 18
she 18
crept 18
up 18
on 18
me 18
i 18
search 18
my 18
heart 18
but 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
the 18
only 18
person 18
i 18
can 18
feel 18
creeping 18
up 18
on 18
me 18
is 18
snow 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
midnight 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
tomorrow 18
when 18
haymitch 18
pushes 18
open 18
the 18
door 18
theyre 18
back 18
were 18
wanted 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
my 18
mouth 18
opens 18
with 18
a 18
flood 18
of 18
questions 18
that 18
he 18
cuts 18
off 18
with 18
thats 18
all 18
i 18
know 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
run 18
but 18
finnicks 18
acting 18
so 18
strange 18
as 18
if 18
hes 18
lost 18
the 18
ability 18
to 18
move 18
so 18
i 18
take 18
his 18
hand 18
and 18
lead 18
him 18
like 18
a 18
small 18
child 18
through 18
special 18
defense 18
into 18
the 18
elevator 18
that 18
goes 18
this 18
way 18
and 18
that 18
and 18
on 18
to 18
the 18
hospital 18
wing 18
the 18
place 18
is 18
in 18
an 18
uproar 18
with 18
doctors 18
shouting 18
orders 18
and 18
the 18
wounded 18
being 18
wheeled 18
through 18
the 18
halls 18
in 18
their 18
beds 18
were 18
sideswiped 18
by 18
a 18
gurney 18
bearing 18
an 18
unconscious 18
emaciated 18
young 18
woman 18
with 18
a 18
shaved 18
head 18
her 18
flesh 18
shows 18
bruises 18
and 18
oozing 18
scabs 18
johanna 18
mason 18
who 18
actually 18
knew 18
rebel 18
secrets 18
at 18
least 18
the 18
one 18
about 18
me 18
and 18
this 18
is 18
how 18
she 18
has 18
paid 18
for 18
it 18
through 18
a 18
doorway 18
i 18
catch 18
a 18
glimpse 18
of 18
gale 18
stripped 18
to 18
the 18
waist 18
perspiration 18
streaming 18
down 18
his 18
face 18
as 18
a 18
doctor 18
removes 18
something 18
from 18
under 18
his 18
shoulder 18
blade 18
with 18
a 18
long 18
pair 18
of 18
tweezers 18
wounded 18
but 18
alive 18
i 18
call 18
his 18
name 18
start 18
toward 18
him 18
until 18
a 18
nurse 18
pushes 18
me 18
back 18
and 18
shuts 18
me 18
out 18
finnick 18
something 18
between 18
a 18
shriek 18
and 18
a 18
cry 18
of 18
joy 18
a 18
lovely 18
if 18
somewhat 18
bedraggled 18

toward 18
us 18
in 18
nothing 18
but 18
a 18
sheet 18
finnick 18
and 18
suddenly 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
theres 18
no 18
one 18
in 18
the 18
world 18
but 18
these 18
two 18
crashing 18
through 18
space 18
to 18
reach 18
each 18
other 18
they 18
collide 18
enfold 18
lose 18
their 18
balance 18
and 18
slam 18
against 18
a 18
wall 18
where 18
they 18
stay 18
clinging 18
into 18
one 18
being 18
indivisible 18
a 18
pang 18
of 18
jealousy 18
hits 18
me 18
not 18
for 18
either 18
finnick 18
or 18
annie 18
but 18
for 18
their 18
certainty 18
no 18
one 18
seeing 18
them 18
could 18
doubt 18
their 18
love 18
boggs 18
looking 18
a 18
little 18
worse 18
for 18

being 18
held 18
anyway 18
peetas 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
hall 18
the 18
effects 18
of 18
the 18
gas 18
are 18
just 18
wearing 18
off 18
you 18
should 18
be 18
there 18
when 18
he 18
wakes 18
peeta 18
alive 18
and 18
wellmaybe 18

from 18
snow 18
safe 18
here 18
with 18
me 18
in 18
a 18
minute 18
i 18
can 18
touch 18
him 18
see 18
his 18
smile 18
hear 18
his 18
laugh 18
haymitchs 18
grinning 18
at 18
me 18
come 18
on 18
then 18
he 18
says 18
im 18
lightheaded 18
with 18
giddiness 18
what 18
will 18
i 18
say 18
oh 18
who 18
cares 18
what 18
i 18
say 18
peeta 18
will 18
be 18
ecstatic 18
no 18
matter 18
what 18
i 18
do 18
hell 18
probably 18
be 18
kissing 18
me 18
anyway 18
i 18
wonder 18
if 18
it 18
will 18
feel 18
like 18
those 18
last 18
kisses 18
on 18
the 18
beach 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
the 18
ones 18
i 18
havent 18
dared 18
let 18
myself 18
consider 18
until 18
this 18
moment 18
peetas 18
awake 18
already 18
sitting 18
on 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
bed 18
looking 18
bewildered 18
as 18
a 18
trio 18
of 18
doctors 18
reassure 18
him 18
flash 18
lights 18
in 18
his 18
eyes 18
check 18
his 18
pulse 18
im 18
disappointed 18
that 18
mine 18
was 18
not 18
the 18
first 18
face 18
he 18
saw 18
when 18
he 18
woke 18
but 18
he 18
sees 18
it 18
now 18
his 18
features 18
register 18
disbelief 18
and 18
something 18
more 18
intense 18
that 18
i 18
cant 18
quite 18
place 18
desire 18
desperation 18
surely 18
both 18
for 18
he 18
sweeps 18
the 18
doctors 18
aside 18
leaps 18
to 18
his 18
feet 18
and 18
moves 18
toward 18
me 18
i 18
run 18
to 18
meet 18
him 18
my 18
arms 18
extended 18
to 18
embrace 18
him 18
his 18
hands 18
are 18
reaching 18
for 18
me 18
too 18
to 18
caress 18
my 18
face 18
i 18
think 18
my 18
lips 18
are 18
just 18
forming 18
his 18
name 18
when 18
his 18
fingers 18
lock 18
around 18
my 18
throat 18
the 18
cold 18
collar 18
chafes 18
my 18
neck 18
and 18
makes 18
the 18
shivering 18
even 18
harder 18
to 18
control 18
at 18
least 18
i 18
am 18
no 18
longer 18
in 18
the 18
claustrophobic 18
tube 18
while 18
the 18
machines 18
click 18
and 18
whir 18
around 18
me 18
listening 18
to 18
a 18
disembodied 18
voice 18
telling 18
me 18
to 18
hold 18
still 18
while 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
convince 18
myself 18
i 18
can 18
still 18
breathe 18

he 18
comes 18
to 18
check 18
on 18
me 18
to 18
look 18
me 18
over 18
and 18
tell 18
me 18
hes 18
seen 18
a 18
lot 18
worse 18
injuries 18
among 18
the 18
soldiers 18
when 18
they 18
teach 18
choke 18
holds 18
in 18
training 18
it 18
was 18
boggs 18
who 18
knocked 18
out 18
peeta 18
with 18
one 18
blow 18
before 18
any 18
permanent 18
damage 18
could 18
be 18
done 18
i 18
know 18
haymitch 18
would 18
have 18
come 18
to 18
my 18
defense 18
if 18
he 18
hadnt 18
been 18
utterly 18
unprepared 18
to 18
catch 18
both 18
haymitch 18
and 18
myself 18
off 18
guard 18
is 18
a 18
rare 18
thing 18
but 18
we 18
have 18
been 18
so 18
consumed 18
with 18
saving 18
peeta 18
so 18
tortured 18
by 18
having 18
him 18
in 18
the 18
capitols 18
hands 18
that 18
the 18
elation 18
at 18
having 18
him 18
back 18
blinded 18
us 18
if 18
id 18
had 18
a 18
private 18
reunion 18
with 18
peeta 18
he 18
would 18
have 18
killed 18
me 18
now 18
that 18
hes 18
deranged 18
no 18
not 18
deranged 18
i 18
remind 18
myself 18
hijacked 18
thats 18
the 18
word 18
i 18
heard 18
pass 18
between 18
plutarch 18
and 18
haymitch 18
as 18
i 18
was 18
wheeled 18
past 18
them 18
in 18
the 18
hallway 18
hijacked 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
it 18
means 18
prim 18
who 18
appeared 18
moments 18
after 18
the 18
attack 18
and 18
has 18
stayed 18
as 18
close 18
to 18
me 18
as 18
possible 18
ever 18
since 18
spreads 18
another 18
blanket 18
over 18
me 18
i 18
think 18
theyll 18
take 18
the 18
collar 18
off 18
soon 18
katniss 18
you 18
wont 18
be 18
so 18
cold 18
then 18
my 18
mother 18
whos 18
been 18
assisting 18
in 18
a 18
complicated 18
surgery 18
has 18
still 18
not 18
been 18
informed 18
of 18
peetas 18
assault 18
prim 18
takes 18
one 18
of 18
my 18
hands 18
which 18
is 18
clutched 18
in 18
a 18
fist 18
and 18
massages 18
it 18
until 18
it 18
opens 18
and 18
blood 18
begins 18
to 18
flow 18
through 18
my 18
fingers 18
again 18
shes 18
starting 18
on 18
the 18
second 18
fist 18
when 18
the 18
doctors 18
show 18
up 18
remove 18
the 18
collar 18
and 18
give 18
me 18
a 18
shot 18
of 18
something 18
for 18
pain 18
and 18
swelling 18
i 18
lie 18
as 18
instructed 18
with 18
my 18
head 18
still 18
not 18
aggravating 18
the 18
injuries 18
to 18
my 18
neck 18
plutarch 18
haymitch 18
and 18
beetee 18
have 18
been 18
waiting 18
in 18
the 18
hall 18
for 18
the 18
doctors 18
to 18
give 18
them 18
clearance 18
to 18
see 18
me 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
if 18
theyve 18
told 18
gale 18
but 18
since 18
hes 18
not 18
here 18
i 18
assume 18
they 18
havent 18
plutarch 18
ushers 18
the 18
doctors 18
out 18
and 18
tries 18
to 18
order 18
prim 18
to 18
go 18
as 18
well 18
but 18
she 18
says 18
no 18
if 18
you 18
force 18
me 18
to 18
leave 18
ill 18
go 18
directly 18
to 18
surgery 18
and 18
tell 18
my 18
mother 18
everything 18
thats 18
happened 18
and 18
i 18
warn 18
you 18
she 18
doesnt 18
think 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
gamemaker 18
calling 18
the 18
shots 18
on 18
katnisss 18
life 18
especially 18
when 18
youve 18
taken 18
such 18
poor 18
care 18
of 18
her 18
plutarch 18
looks 18
offended 18
but 18
haymitch 18
chuckles 18
id 18
let 18
it 18
go 18
plutarch 18
he 18
says 18
prim 18
stays 18
so 18
katniss 18
peetas 18
condition 18
has 18
come 18
as 18
a 18
shock 18
to 18
all 18
of 18
us 18
says 18
plutarch 18
we 18
couldnt 18
help 18
but 18
notice 18
his 18
deterioration 18
in 18
the 18
last 18
two 18
interviews 18
obviously 18
hed 18
been 18
abused 18
and 18
we 18
put 18
his 18
psychological 18
state 18
down 18
to 18
that 18
now 18
we 18
believe 18
something 18
more 18
was 18
going 18
on 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
has 18
been 18
subjecting 18
him 18
to 18
a 18
rather 18
uncommon 18
technique 18
known 18
as 18
hijacking 18
beetee 18
im 18
sorry 18
beetee 18
says 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
tell 18
you 18
all 18
the 18
specifics 18
of 18
it 18
katniss 18
the 18
capitols 18
very 18
secretive 18
about 18
this 18
form 18
of 18
torture 18
and 18
i 18
believe 18
the 18
results 18
are 18
inconsistent 18
this 18
we 18
do 18
know 18
its 18
a 18
type 18
of 18
fear 18
conditioning 18
the 18
term 18
hijack 18
comes 18
from 18
an 18
old 18
english 18
word 18
that 18
means 18
to 18
capture 18
or 18
even 18
better 18
seize 18
we 18
believe 18
it 18
was 18
chosen 18
because 18
the 18
technique 18
involves 18
the 18
use 18
of 18
tracker 18
jacker 18
venom 18
and 18
the 18
jack 18
suggested 18
hijack 18
you 18
were 18
stung 18
in 18
your 18
first 18
hunger 18
games 18
so 18
unlike 18
most 18
of 18
us 18
you 18
have 18
firsthand 18
knowledge 18
of 18
the 18
effects 18
of 18
the 18
venom 18
terror 18
hallucinations 18
nightmarish 18
visions 18
of 18
losing 18
those 18
i 18
love 18
because 18
the 18
venom 18
targets 18
the 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
brain 18
that 18
houses 18
fear 18
im 18
sure 18
you 18
remember 18
how 18
frightening 18
it 18
was 18
did 18
you 18
also 18
suffer 18
mental 18
confusion 18
in 18
the 18
aftermath 18
asks 18
beetee 18
a 18
sense 18
of 18
being 18
unable 18
to 18
judge 18
what 18
was 18
true 18
and 18
what 18
was 18
false 18
most 18
people 18
who 18
have 18
been 18
stung 18
and 18
lived 18
to 18
tell 18
about 18
it 18
report 18
something 18
of 18
the 18
kind 18
yes 18
that 18
encounter 18
with 18
peeta 18
even 18
after 18
i 18
was 18
clearheaded 18
i 18
wasnt 18
sure 18
if 18
he 18
had 18
saved 18
my 18
life 18
by 18
taking 18
on 18
cato 18
or 18
if 18
id 18
imagined 18
it 18
recall 18
is 18
made 18
more 18
difficult 18
because 18
memories 18
can 18
be 18
changed 18
beetee 18
taps 18
his 18
forehead 18
brought 18
to 18
the 18
forefront 18
of 18
your 18
mind 18
altered 18
and 18
saved 18
again 18
in 18
the 18
revised 18
form 18
now 18
imagine 18
that 18
i 18
ask 18
you 18
to 18
remember 18
somethingeither 18
with 18
a 18
verbal 18
suggestion 18
or 18
by 18
making 18
you 18
watch 18
a 18
tape 18
of 18
the 18
eventand 18
while 18
that 18
experience 18
is 18
refreshed 18
i 18
give 18
you 18
a 18
dose 18
of 18
tracker 18
jacker 18
venom 18
not 18
enough 18
to 18
induce 18
a 18
threeday 18
blackout 18
just 18
enough 18
to 18
infuse 18
the 18
memory 18
with 18
fear 18
and 18
doubt 18
and 18
thats 18
what 18
your 18
brain 18
puts 18
in 18
longterm 18
storage 18
i 18
start 18
to 18
feel 18
sick 18
prim 18
asks 18
the 18
question 18
thats 18
in 18
my 18
mind 18
is 18
that 18
what 18
theyve 18
done 18
to 18
peeta 18
taken 18
his 18
memories 18
of 18
katniss 18
and 18
distorted 18
them 18
so 18
theyre 18
scary 18
beetee 18
nods 18
so 18
scary 18
that 18
hed 18
see 18
her 18
as 18
lifethreatening 18
that 18
he 18
might 18
try 18
to 18
kill 18
her 18
yes 18
thats 18
our 18
current 18
theory 18
i 18
cover 18
my 18
face 18
with 18
my 18
arms 18
because 18
this 18
isnt 18
happening 18
it 18
isnt 18
possible 18
for 18
someone 18
to 18
make 18
peeta 18
forget 18
he 18
loves 18
meno 18
one 18
could 18
do 18
that 18
but 18
you 18
can 18
reverse 18
it 18
right 18
asks 18
prim 18
umvery 18
little 18
data 18
on 18
that 18
says 18
plutarch 18
none 18
really 18
if 18
hijacking 18
rehabilitation 18
has 18
been 18
attempted 18
before 18
we 18
have 18
no 18
access 18
to 18
those 18
records 18
well 18
youre 18
going 18
to 18
try 18
arent 18
you 18
prim 18
persists 18
youre 18
not 18
just 18
going 18
to 18
lock 18
him 18
up 18
in 18
some 18
padded 18
room 18
and 18
leave 18
him 18
to 18
suffer 18
of 18
course 18
well 18
try 18
prim 18
says 18
beetee 18
its 18
just 18
we 18
dont 18
know 18

what 18
degree 18
well 18
succeed 18
if 18
any 18
my 18
guess 18
is 18
that 18
fearful 18
events 18
are 18
the 18
hardest 18
to 18
root 18
out 18
theyre 18
the 18
ones 18
we 18
naturally 18
remember 18
the 18
best 18
after 18
all 18
and 18
apart 18
from 18
his 18
memories 18
of 18

into 18
my 18
room 18
he 18
doesnt 18

on 18
my 18
neck 18
with 18

as 18
light 18
as 18
moth 18
wings 18
plants 18
a 18
kiss 18
between 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18

only 18
when 18
necessary 18
im 18
not 18
imprinted 18
with 18
a 18
schedule 18
so 18
i 18
wander 18
around 18
aimlessly 18
until 18
prims 18

from 18
her 18

pan 18
of 18
sand 18
thats 18
kept 18
under 18
the 18
bathroom 18
sink 18
as 18
prim 18
tucks 18
me 18
into 18
bed 18
he 18
hops 18
up 18
on 18
my 18
pillow 18
vying 18
for 18
her 18
attention 18
she 18
cradles 18
him 18
but 18
stays 18
focused 18
on 18
me 18
katniss 18
i 18
know 18
this 18
whole 18
thing 18
with 18
peeta 18
is 18
terrible 18
for 18
you 18
but 18
remember 18
snow 18

on 18
him 18
for 18
weeks 18
and 18
weve 18
only 18
had 18
him 18
for 18
a 18
few 18
days 18
theres 18
a 18
chance 18
that 18
the 18
old 18
peeta 18
the 18
one 18
who 18
loves 18
you 18

still 18
inside 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
back 18
to 18
you 18
dont 18
give 18
up 18
on 18
him 18
i 18
look 18
at 18
my 18
little 18
sister 18
and 18
think 18
how 18
she 18
has 18
inherited 18
the 18
best 18
qualities 18
our 18
family 18
has 18
to 18
offer 18
my 18
mothers 18
healing 18
hands 18
my 18
fathers 18
level 18
head 18
and 18
my 18
fight 18
theres 18
something 18
else 18
there 18
as 18
well 18
something 18
entirely 18
her 18
own 18
an 18
ability 18
to 18
look 18
into 18
the 18
confusing 18
mess 18
of 18
life 18
and 18
see 18
things 18
for 18
what 18
they 18
are 18
is 18
it 18
possible 18
she 18
could 18
be 18
right 18
that 18
peeta 18
could 18
return 18
to 18
me 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
get 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
hospital 18
prim 18
says 18
placing 18
buttercup 18
on 18
the 18
bed 18
beside 18
me 18
you 18

each 18
other 18
company 18
okay 18
buttercup 18
springs 18
off 18
the 18
bed 18
and 18
follows 18
her 18
to 18
the 18
door 18
complaining 18
loudly 18
when 18
hes 18
left 18
behind 18
were 18
about 18
as 18
much 18
company 18
for 18
each 18
other 18
as 18
dirt 18
after 18
maybe 18
thirty 18
seconds 18
i 18
know 18
i 18
cant 18
stand 18
being 18
confined 18
in 18
the 18
subterranean 18
cell 18
and 18
leave 18
buttercup 18
to 18
his 18
own 18
devices 18
i 18
get 18
lost 18
several 18
times 18
but 18
eventually 18
i 18
make 18
my 18
way 18
down 18
to 18
special 18
defense 18
everyone 18
i 18
pass 18
stares 18
at 18
the 18
bruises 18
and 18
i 18
cant 18
help 18
feeling 18
selfconscious 18
to 18
the 18
point 18
that 18
i 18
tug 18
my 18
collar 18
up 18
to 18
my 18
ears 18
gale 18
must 18
have 18
been 18
released 18
from 18
the 18
hospital 18
this 18
morning 18
as 18
well 18
because 18
i 18
find 18
him 18
in 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
research 18
rooms 18
with 18
beetee 18
theyre 18
immersed 18
heads 18
bent 18
over 18
a 18
drawing 18
taking 18
a 18
measurement 18
versions 18
of 18
the 18
picture 18
litter 18
the 18
table 18
and 18
floor 18
tacked 18
on 18
the 18
corkboard 18
walls 18
and 18
occupying 18
several 18
computer 18
screens 18
are 18
other 18
designs 18
of 18
some 18
sort 18
in 18
the 18
rough 18
lines 18
of 18
one 18
i 18
recognize 18
gales 18
twitchup 18
snare 18
what 18
are 18
these 18
i 18
ask 18
hoarsely 18
pulling 18
their 18
attention 18
from 18
the 18
sheet 18
ah 18
katniss 18
youve 18
found 18
us 18
out 18
says 18
beetee 18
cheerfully 18
what 18
is 18
this 18
a 18
secret 18
i 18
know 18
gales 18
been 18
down 18
here 18
working 18
with 18
beetee 18
a 18
lot 18
but 18
i 18
assumed 18
they 18
were 18
messing 18
around 18
with 18
bows 18
and 18
guns 18
not 18
really 18
but 18
ive 18
felt 18
a 18
little 18
guilty 18
about 18
it 18
stealing 18
gale 18
away 18
from 18
you 18
so 18
much 18
beetee 18
admits 18
since 18
ive 18
spent 18
most 18
of 18
my 18
time 18
in 18
disoriented 18
worried 18
angry 18
being 18
remade 18
or 18
hospitalized 18
i 18
cant 18
say 18
gales 18
absences 18
have 18
inconvenienced 18
me 18
things 18
havent 18
been 18
exactly 18
harmonious 18
between 18
us 18
either 18
but 18
i 18
let 18
beetee 18
think 18
he 18
owes 18
me 18
i 18
hope 18
youve 18
been 18
putting 18
his 18
time 18
to 18
good 18
use 18
come 18
and 18
see 18
he 18
says 18
waving 18
me 18
over 18
to 18
a 18
computer 18
screen 18
this 18
is 18
what 18
theyve 18
been 18
doing 18
taking 18
the 18
fundamental 18
ideas 18
behind 18
gales 18
traps 18
and 18
adapting 18
them 18
into 18
weapons 18
against 18
humans 18
bombs 18
mostly 18
its 18
less 18
about 18
the 18
mechanics 18
of 18
the 18
traps 18
than 18
the 18
psychology 18
behind 18
them 18
boobytrapping 18
an 18
area 18
that 18
provides 18
something 18
essential 18
to 18
survival 18
a 18
water 18
or 18
food 18
supply 18
frightening 18
prey 18
so 18
that 18
a 18
large 18
number 18
flee 18
into 18
a 18
greater 18
destruction 18
endangering 18
offspring 18
in 18
order 18
to 18
draw 18
in 18
the 18
actual 18
desired 18
target 18
the 18
parent 18
luring 18
the 18
victim 18
into 18
what 18
appears 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
safe 18
havenwhere 18
death 18
awaits 18
it 18
at 18
some 18
point 18
gale 18
and 18
beetee 18
left 18
the 18
wilderness 18
behind 18
and 18
focused 18
on 18
more 18
human 18
impulses 18
like 18
compassion 18
a 18
bomb 18
explodes 18
time 18
is 18
allowed 18
for 18
people 18
to 18
rush 18
to 18
the 18
aid 18
of 18
the 18
wounded 18
then 18
a 18
second 18
more 18
powerful 18
bomb 18
kills 18
them 18
as 18
well 18
that 18
seems 18
to 18
be 18
crossing 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
line 18
i 18
say 18
so 18
anything 18
goes 18
they 18
both 18
stare 18
at 18
mebeetee 18
with 18
doubt 18
gale 18
with 18
hostility 18
i 18
guess 18
there 18
isnt 18
a 18
rule 18
book 18
for 18
what 18
might 18
be 18
unacceptable 18
to 18
do 18
to 18
another 18
human 18
being 18
sure 18
there 18
is 18
beetee 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
been 18
following 18
the 18
same 18
rule 18
book 18
president 18
snow 18
used 18
when 18
he 18
hijacked 18
peeta 18
says 18
gale 18
cruel 18
but 18
to 18
the 18
point 18
i 18
leave 18
without 18
further 18
comment 18
i 18
feel 18
if 18
i 18
dont 18
get 18
outside 18
immediately 18
ill 18
just 18
go 18
ballistic 18
but 18
im 18
still 18
in 18
special 18
defense 18
when 18
im 18
waylaid 18
by 18
haymitch 18
come 18
on 18
he 18
says 18
we 18
need 18
you 18
back 18
up 18
at 18
the 18
hospital 18
what 18
for 18
i 18
ask 18
theyre 18
going 18
to 18
try 18
something 18
on 18
peeta 18
he 18
answers 18
send 18
in 18
the 18
most 18
innocuous 18
person 18
from 18
twelve 18
they 18
can 18
come 18
up 18
with 18
find 18
someone 18
peeta 18
might 18
share 18
childhood 18
memories 18
with 18
but 18
nothing 18
too 18
close 18
to 18
you 18
theyre 18
screening 18
people 18
now 18
i 18
know 18
this 18
will 18
be 18
a 18
difficult 18
task 18
since 18
anyone 18
peeta 18
shares 18
childhood 18
memories 18
with 18
would 18
most 18
likely 18
be 18
from 18
town 18
and 18
almost 18
none 18
of 18
those 18
people 18
escaped 18
the 18
flames 18
but 18
when 18
we 18
reach 18
the 18
hospital 18
room 18
that 18
has 18
been 18
turned 18
into 18
a 18
work 18
space 18
for 18

cartwright 18
as 18
always 18
she 18
gives 18
me 18
a 18
smile 18
that 18
suggests 18

her 18
best 18
friend 18
in 18
the 18
world 18

shoe 18
shop 18
in 18
town 18
werent 18
as 18
lucky 18
she 18
looks 18
older 18
wearing 18
the 18
drab 18
clothes 18
that 18
flatter 18
no 18
one 18
with 18
her 18
long 18
yellow 18
hair 18
in 18
a 18
practical 18
braid 18
instead 18
of 18
curls 18
dellys 18
a 18
bit 18
thinner 18
than 18
i 18
remember 18
but 18
she 18
was 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
few 18
kids 18
in 18
district 18
with 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
pounds 18
to 18
spare 18
the 18
diet 18
here 18
the 18
stress 18
the 18
grief 18
of 18
losing 18
her 18
parents 18
have 18
all 18
no 18
doubt 18
contributed 18
how 18
are 18
you 18
doing 18
i 18
ask 18
oh 18
its 18
been 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
changes 18
all 18
at 18
once 18
her 18
eyes 18
fill 18
with 18
tears 18
but 18
everyones 18
really 18
nice 18
here 18
in 18
thirteen 18
dont 18
you 18
think 18
delly 18
means 18
it 18
she 18
genuinely 18
likes 18
people 18
all 18
people 18
not 18
just 18
a 18
select 18
few 18
shes 18
spent 18
years 18
making 18
up 18
her 18
mind 18
about 18
theyve 18
made 18
an 18
effort 18
to 18
make 18
us 18
feel 18
welcome 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
think 18
thats 18
a 18
fair 18
statement 18
without 18
going 18
overboard 18
are 18
you 18
the 18
one 18
theyve 18
picked 18
to 18
see 18
peeta 18
i 18
guess 18
so 18
poor 18
peeta 18
poor 18
you 18
ill 18
never 18
understand 18
the 18
capitol 18
she 18
says 18
better 18
not 18
to 18
maybe 18
i 18
tell 18
her 18
dellys 18
known 18
peeta 18
for 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
says 18
plutarch 18
oh 18
yes 18
dellys 18
face 18
brightens 18
we 18
played 18
together 18
from 18
when 18
we 18
were 18
little 18
i 18
used 18
to 18
tell 18
people 18
he 18
was 18
my 18
brother 18
what 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
haymitch 18
asks 18
me 18
anything 18
that 18
might 18
trigger 18
memories 18
of 18
you 18
we 18
were 18
all 18
in 18
the 18
same 18
class 18
but 18
we 18
never 18
overlapped 18
much 18
i 18
say 18
katniss 18
was 18
always 18
so 18
amazing 18
i 18
never 18
dreamed 18
she 18
would 18
notice 18
me 18
says 18
delly 18
the 18
way 18
she 18
could 18
hunt 18
and 18
go 18
in 18
the 18
hob 18
and 18
everything 18
everyone 18
admired 18
her 18
so 18
haymitch 18
and 18
i 18
both 18
have 18
to 18
take 18
a 18
hard 18
look 18
at 18
her 18
face 18
to 18
doublecheck 18
if 18
shes 18
joking 18
to 18
hear 18
delly 18
describe 18
it 18
i 18
had 18
next 18
to 18
no 18
friends 18
because 18
i 18
intimidated 18
people 18
by 18
being 18
so 18
exceptional 18
not 18
true 18
i 18
had 18
next 18
to 18
no 18
friends 18
because 18
i 18
wasnt 18
friendly 18
leave 18
it 18
to 18
delly 18
to 18
spin 18
me 18
into 18
something 18
wonderful 18
delly 18
always 18
thinks 18
the 18
best 18
of 18
everyone 18
i 18
explain 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
peeta 18
could 18
have 18
bad 18
memories 18
associated 18
with 18
her 18
then 18
i 18
remember 18
wait 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
when 18
i 18
lied 18
about 18
recognizing 18
the 18
avox 18
girl 18
peeta 18
covered 18
for 18
me 18
and 18
said 18
she 18
looked 18
like 18
delly 18
i 18
remember 18
says 18
haymitch 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
it 18
wasnt 18
true 18
delly 18
wasnt 18
actually 18
there 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
it 18
can 18
compete 18
with 18
years 18
of 18
childhood 18
memories 18
especially 18
with 18
such 18
a 18
pleasant 18
companion 18
as 18
delly 18
says 18
plutarch 18
lets 18
give 18
it 18
a 18
shot 18
plutarch 18
haymitch 18
and 18
i 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
observation 18
room 18
next 18
to 18
where 18
peetas 18
confined 18
its 18
crowded 18
with 18
ten 18
members 18
of 18
his 18
recovery 18
team 18
armed 18
with 18
pens 18
and 18

and 18
audio 18
setup 18
allow 18
us 18
to 18
watch 18
peeta 18
secretly 18
he 18
lies 18
on 18
the 18
bed 18
his 18
arms 18
strapped 18
down 18
he 18
doesnt 18
fight 18
the 18
restraints 18
but 18
his 18
hands 18
fidget 18
continuously 18
his 18
expression 18
seems 18
more 18
lucid 18
than 18
when 18
he 18
tried 18
to 18
strangle 18
me 18
but 18
its 18
still 18
not 18
one 18
that 18
belongs 18
to 18
him 18
when 18
the 18
door 18
quietly 18
opens 18
his 18
eyes 18
widen 18
in 18
alarm 18
then 18
become 18
confused 18
delly 18
crosses 18
the 18
room 18
tentatively 18
but 18
as 18
she 18
nears 18
him 18
she 18
naturally 18
breaks 18
into 18
a 18
smile 18

not 18
until 18
all 18
the 18
districts 18
are 18
secure 18
good 18
news 18
is 18
the 18
fightings 18
almost 18
over 18
in 18
all 18
of 18
them 18
but 18
two 18
its 18
a 18
tough 18
nut 18
to 18
crack 18
though 18
thats 18
right 18
first 18
the 18
districts 18
next 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
then 18
i 18
hunt 18
down 18
snow 18
fine 18
i 18
say 18
send 18
me 18
to 18
two 18
district 18
is 18
a 18
large 18
district 18
as 18
one 18
might 18
expect 18
composed 18
of 18
a 18
series 18
of 18
villages 18
spread 18
across 18
the 18
mountains 18
each 18
was 18
originally 18
associated 18
with 18
a 18
mine 18
or 18
quarry 18
although 18
now 18
many 18
are 18
devoted 18
to 18
the 18
housing 18
and 18
training 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
none 18
of 18
this 18
would 18
present 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
challenge 18
since 18
the 18
rebels 18
have 18
s 18
airpower 18
on 18
their 18
side 18
except 18
for 18
one 18
thing 18
at 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
district 18
is 18
a 18
virtually 18
impenetrable 18
mountain 18
that 18
houses 18
the 18
heart 18
of 18
the 18
capitols 18
military 18
weve 18
nicknamed 18
the 18
mountain 18
the 18
nut 18
since 18
i 18
relayed 18
plutarchs 18
tough 18
nut 18
to 18
crack 18
comment 18
to 18
the 18
weary 18
and 18
discouraged 18
rebel 18
leaders 18
here 18
the 18
nut 18
was 18
established 18
directly 18
after 18
the 18
dark 18
days 18
when 18
the 18
capitol 18
had 18
lost 18
and 18
was 18
desperate 18
for 18
a 18
new 18
underground 18
stronghold 18
they 18
had 18
some 18
of 18
their 18
military 18
resources 18
situated 18
on 18
the 18
outskirts 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
itselfnuclear 18
missiles 18
aircraft 18
troopsbut 18
a 18
significant 18
chunk 18
of 18
their 18
power 18
was 18
now 18
under 18
an 18
enemys 18
control 18
of 18
course 18
there 18
was 18
no 18
way 18
they 18
could 18
hope 18
to 18
replicate 18
which 18
was 18
the 18
work 18
of 18
centuries 18
however 18
in 18
the 18
old 18
mines 18
of 18
nearby 18
district 18
they 18
saw 18
opportunity 18
from 18
the 18
air 18
the 18
nut 18
appeared 18
to 18
be 18
just 18
another 18
mountain 18
with 18
a 18
few 18
entrances 18
on 18
its 18
faces 18
but 18
inside 18
were 18
vast 18
cavernous 18
spaces 18
where 18
slabs 18
of 18
stones 18
had 18
been 18
cut 18
hauled 18
to 18
the 18
surface 18
and 18
transported 18
down 18
slippery 18
narrow 18
roads 18
to 18
make 18
distant 18
buildings 18
there 18
was 18
even 18
a 18
train 18
system 18
to 18
facilitate 18
transporting 18
the 18
miners 18
from 18
the 18
nut 18
to 18
the 18
very 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
main 18
town 18
in 18
district 18
it 18
ran 18
right 18
to 18
the 18
square 18
that 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
visited 18
during 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
standing 18
on 18
the 18
wide 18
marble 18
steps 18
of 18
the 18
justice 18
building 18
trying 18
not 18
to 18
look 18
too 18
closely 18
at 18
catos 18
and 18
cloves 18
grieving 18
families 18
assembled 18
below 18
us 18
it 18
was 18
not 18
the 18
most 18
ideal 18
terrain 18
plagued 18
as 18
it 18
was 18
by 18
mudslides 18
floods 18
and 18
avalanches 18
but 18
the 18
advantages 18
outweighed 18
the 18
concerns 18
as 18
theyd 18
cut 18
deep 18
into 18
the 18
mountain 18
the 18
miners 18
had 18
left 18
large 18
pillars 18
and 18
walls 18
of 18
stone 18
to 18
support 18
the 18
infrastructure 18
the 18
capitol 18
reinforced 18
these 18
and 18
set 18
about 18
making 18
the 18
mountain 18
their 18
new 18
military 18
base 18
filling 18
it 18
with 18
computer 18
banks 18
and 18
meeting 18
rooms 18
barracks 18
and 18
arsenals 18
widening 18
entrances 18
to 18
allow 18
the 18
exit 18
of 18
hovercraft 18
from 18
the 18
hangar 18
installing 18
missile 18
launchers 18
but 18
on 18
the 18
whole 18
leaving 18
the 18
exterior 18
of 18
the 18
mountain 18
largely 18
unchanged 18
a 18
rough 18
rocky 18
tangle 18
of 18
trees 18
and 18
wildlife 18
a 18
natural 18
fortress 18
to 18
protect 18
them 18
from 18
their 18
enemies 18
by 18
the 18
other 18
districts 18
standards 18
the 18
capitol 18
babied 18
the 18
inhabitants 18
here 18
just 18
by 18
looking 18
at 18
the 18
district 18
rebels 18
you 18
can 18
tell 18
they 18
were 18
decently 18
fed 18
and 18
cared 18
for 18
in 18
childhood 18
some 18
did 18
end 18
up 18
as 18
quarry 18
and 18
mine 18
workers 18
others 18
were 18
educated 18
for 18
jobs 18
in 18
the 18
nut 18
or 18
funneled 18
into 18
the 18
ranks 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
trained 18
young 18
and 18
hard 18
for 18
combat 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
were 18
an 18
opportunity 18
for 18
wealth 18
and 18
a 18
kind 18
of 18
glory 18
not 18
seen 18
elsewhere 18
of 18
course 18
the 18
people 18
of 18
swallowed 18
the 18
capitols 18
propaganda 18
more 18
easily 18
than 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
embraced 18
their 18
ways 18
but 18
for 18
all 18
that 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
day 18
they 18
were 18
still 18
slaves 18
and 18
if 18
that 18
was 18
lost 18
on 18
the 18
citizens 18
who 18
became 18
peacekeepers 18
or 18
worked 18
in 18
the 18
nut 18
it 18
was 18
not 18
lost 18
on 18
the 18
stonecutters 18
who 18
formed 18
the 18
backbone 18
of 18
the 18
resistance 18
here 18
things 18
stand 18
as 18
they 18
did 18
when 18
i 18
arrived 18
two 18
weeks 18
ago 18
the 18
outer 18
villages 18
are 18
in 18
rebel 18
hands 18
the 18
town 18
divided 18
and 18
the 18
nut 18
is 18
as 18
untouchable 18
as 18
ever 18
its 18
few 18
entrances 18
heavily 18
fortified 18
its 18
heart 18
safely 18
enfolded 18
in 18
the 18
mountain 18
while 18
every 18
other 18
district 18
has 18
now 18
wrested 18
control 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
remains 18
in 18
its 18
pocket 18
each 18
day 18
i 18
do 18
whatever 18
i 18
can 18
to 18
help 18
visit 18
the 18
wounded 18
tape 18
short 18
propos 18
with 18
my 18
camera 18
crew 18
im 18
not 18
allowed 18
in 18
actual 18
combat 18
but 18
they 18
invite 18
me 18
to 18
the 18
meetings 18
on 18
the 18
status 18
of 18
the 18
war 18
which 18
is 18
a 18
lot 18
more 18
than 18
they 18
did 18
in 18
its 18
much 18
better 18
here 18
freer 18
no 18
schedules 18
on 18
my 18
arm 18
fewer 18
demands 18
on 18
my 18
time 18
i 18
live 18
aboveground 18
in 18
the 18
rebel 18
villages 18
or 18
surrounding 18
caves 18
for 18
safetys 18
sake 18
im 18
relocated 18
often 18
during 18
the 18
day 18
ive 18
been 18
given 18
clearance 18
to 18
hunt 18
as 18
long 18
as 18
i 18
take 18
a 18
guard 18
along 18
and 18
dont 18
stray 18
too 18
far 18
in 18
the 18
thin 18
cold 18
mountain 18
air 18
i 18
feel 18
some 18
physical 18
strength 18
returning 18
my 18
mind 18
clearing 18
away 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
fogginess 18
but 18
with 18
this 18
mental 18
clarity 18
comes 18
an 18
even 18
sharper 18
awareness 18
of 18
what 18
has 18
been 18
done 18
to 18
peeta 18
snow 18
has 18
stolen 18
him 18
from 18
me 18
twisted 18
him 18
beyond 18
recognition 18
and 18
made 18
me 18
a 18
present 18
of 18
him 18
boggs 18
who 18
came 18
to 18
when 18
i 18
did 18
told 18
me 18
that 18
even 18
with 18
all 18
the 18
plotting 18
it 18
was 18
a 18
little 18
too 18
easy 18
to 18
rescue 18
peeta 18
he 18
believes 18
if 18
hadnt 18
made 18
the 18
effort 18
peeta 18
wouldve 18
been 18
delivered 18
to 18
me 18
anyway 18
dropped 18
off 18
in 18
an 18
actively 18
warring 18
district 18
or 18
perhaps 18
itself 18
tied 18
up 18
with 18
ribbons 18
and 18
tagged 18
with 18
my 18
name 18
programmed 18
to 18
murder 18
me 18
its 18
only 18
now 18
that 18
hes 18
been 18
corrupted 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
fully 18
appreciate 18
the 18
real 18
peeta 18
even 18
more 18
than 18
i 18
wouldve 18
if 18
hed 18
died 18
the 18
kindness 18
the 18
steadiness 18
the 18
warmth 18
that 18
had 18
an 18
unexpected 18
heat 18
behind 18
it 18
outside 18
of 18
prim 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
gale 18
how 18
many 18
people 18

off 18
nightmares 18
on 18

news 18
katniss 18
i 18
think 18
weve 18
almost 18
got 18
him 18
convinced 18
youre 18
not 18
a 18
mutt 18
or 18
today 18
he 18
was 18
allowed 18
to 18
feed 18
himself 18
pudding 18
when 18
haymitch 18
gets 18
on 18
after 18
he 18
admits 18
peetas 18
no 18
better 18
the 18
only 18
dubious 18
ray 18
of 18
hope 18
has 18
come 18
from 18
my 18
sister 18
prim 18
came 18
up 18
with 18
the 18
idea 18
of 18
trying 18
to 18
hijack 18
him 18
back 18
haymitch 18
tells 18
me 18
bring 18
up 18
the 18
distorted 18
memories 18
of 18
you 18
and 18
then 18
give 18
him 18
a 18
big 18
dose 18
of 18
a 18
calming 18
drug 18
like 18
morphling 18
weve 18
only 18
tried 18
it 18
on 18
one 18
memory 18
the 18
tape 18
of 18
the 18
two 18
of 18
you 18
in 18
the 18
cave 18
when 18
you 18
told 18
him 18
that 18
story 18
about 18
getting 18
prim 18
the 18
goat 18
any 18
improvement 18
i 18
ask 18
well 18
if 18
extreme 18
confusion 18
is 18
an 18
improvement 18
over 18
extreme 18
terror 18
then 18
yes 18
says 18
haymitch 18
but 18
im 18
not 18
sure 18
it 18
is 18
he 18
lost 18
the 18
ability 18
to 18
speak 18
for 18
several 18
hours 18
went 18
into 18
some 18
sort 18
of 18
stupor 18
when 18
he 18
came 18
out 18
the 18
only 18
thing 18
he 18
asked 18
about 18
was 18
the 18
goat 18
right 18
i 18
say 18
hows 18
it 18
out 18
there 18
he 18
asks 18
no 18
forward 18
motion 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
were 18
sending 18
out 18
a 18
team 18
to 18
help 18
with 18
the 18
mountain 18
beetee 18
and 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
others 18
he 18
says 18
you 18
know 18
the 18
brains 18
when 18
the 18
brains 18
are 18
selected 18
im 18
not 18
surprised 18
to 18
see 18
gales 18
name 18
on 18
the 18
list 18
i 18
thought 18
beetee 18
would 18
bring 18
him 18
not 18
for 18
his 18
technological 18
expertise 18
but 18
in 18
the 18
hopes 18
that 18
he 18
could 18
somehow 18
think 18
of 18
a 18
way 18
to 18
ensnare 18
a 18
mountain 18
originally 18
gale 18
offered 18
to 18
come 18
with 18
me 18
to 18
but 18
i 18
could 18
see 18
i 18
was 18
tearing 18
him 18
away 18
from 18
his 18
work 18
with 18
beetee 18
i 18
told 18
him 18
to 18
sit 18
tight 18
and 18
stay 18
where 18
he 18
was 18
most 18
needed 18
i 18
didnt 18
tell 18
him 18
his 18
presence 18
would 18
make 18
it 18
even 18
more 18
difficult 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
mourn 18
peeta 18
gale 18
finds 18
me 18
when 18
they 18
arrive 18
late 18
one 18
afternoon 18
im 18
sitting 18
on 18
a 18
log 18
at 18
the 18
edge 18
of 18
my 18
current 18
village 18
plucking 18
a 18
goose 18
a 18
dozen 18
or 18
so 18
of 18
the 18
birds 18
are 18
piled 18
at 18
my 18
feet 18
great 18
flocks 18
of 18
them 18
have 18
been 18
migrating 18
through 18
here 18
since 18
ive 18
arrived 18
and 18
the 18
pickings 18
are 18
easy 18
without 18
a 18
word 18
gale 18
settles 18
beside 18
me 18
and 18
begins 18
to 18
relieve 18
a 18
bird 18
of 18
its 18
feathers 18
were 18
through 18
about 18
half 18
when 18
he 18
says 18
any 18
chance 18
well 18
get 18
to 18
eat 18
these 18
yeah 18
most 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
camp 18
kitchen 18
but 18
they 18
expect 18
me 18
to 18
give 18
a 18
couple 18
to 18
whoever 18
im 18
staying 18
with 18
tonight 18
i 18
say 18
for 18
keeping 18
me 18
isnt 18
the 18
honor 18
of 18
the 18
thing 18
enough 18
he 18
says 18
youd 18
think 18
i 18
reply 18
but 18
words 18
gotten 18
out 18
that 18
mockingjays 18
are 18
hazardous 18
to 18
your 18
health 18
we 18
pluck 18
in 18
silence 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
longer 18
then 18
he 18
says 18
i 18
saw 18
peeta 18
yesterday 18
through 18
the 18
glass 18
whatd 18
you 18
think 18
i 18
ask 18
something 18
selfish 18
says 18
gale 18
that 18
you 18
dont 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
jealous 18
of 18
him 18
anymore 18
my 18
fingers 18
give 18
a 18
yank 18
and 18
a 18
cloud 18
of 18
feathers 18
floats 18
down 18
around 18
us 18
no 18
just 18
the 18
opposite 18
gale 18
pulls 18
a 18
feather 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
hair 18
i 18
thoughtill 18
never 18
compete 18
with 18
that 18
no 18
matter 18
how 18
much 18
pain 18
im 18
in 18
he 18
spins 18
the 18
feather 18
between 18
his 18
thumb 18
and 18
forefinger 18
i 18
dont 18
stand 18
a 18
chance 18
if 18
he 18
doesnt 18
get 18
better 18
youll 18
never 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
let 18
him 18
go 18
youll 18
always 18
feel 18
wrong 18
about 18
being 18
with 18
me 18
the 18
way 18
i 18
always 18
felt 18
wrong 18
kissing 18
him 18
because 18
of 18
you 18
i 18
say 18
gale 18
holds 18
my 18
gaze 18
if 18
i 18
thought 18
that 18
was 18
true 18
i 18
could 18
almost 18
live 18
with 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
it 18
it 18
is 18
true 18
i 18
admit 18
but 18
so 18
is 18
what 18
you 18
said 18
about 18
peeta 18
gale 18
makes 18
a 18
sound 18
of 18
exasperation 18
nonetheless 18
after 18
weve 18
dropped 18
off 18
the 18
birds 18
and 18
volunteered 18
to 18
go 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
woods 18
to 18
gather 18
kindling 18
for 18
the 18
evening 18
fire 18
i 18
find 18
myself 18
wrapped 18
in 18
his 18
arms 18
his 18
lips 18
brushing 18
the 18
faded 18
bruises 18
on 18
my 18
neck 18
working 18
their 18
way 18
to 18
my 18
mouth 18
despite 18
what 18
i 18
feel 18
for 18
peeta 18
this 18
is 18
when 18
i 18
accept 18
deep 18
down 18
that 18
hell 18
never 18
come 18
back 18
to 18
me 18
or 18
ill 18
never 18
go 18
back 18
to 18
him 18
ill 18
stay 18
in 18
until 18
it 18
falls 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
kill 18
snow 18
and 18
then 18
die 18
for 18
my 18
trouble 18
and 18
hell 18
die 18
insane 18
and 18
hating 18
me 18
so 18
in 18
the 18
fading 18
light 18
i 18
shut 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18
kiss 18
gale 18
to 18
make 18
up 18
for 18
all 18
the 18
kisses 18
ive 18
withheld 18
and 18
because 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
anymore 18
and 18
because 18
im 18
so 18
desperately 18
lonely 18
i 18
cant 18
stand 18
it 18
gales 18
touch 18
and 18
taste 18
and 18
heat 18
remind 18
me 18
that 18
at 18
least 18
my 18
bodys 18
still 18
alive 18
and 18
for 18
the 18
moment 18
its 18
a 18
welcome 18
feeling 18
i 18
empty 18
my 18
mind 18
and 18
let 18
the 18
sensations 18
run 18
through 18
my 18
flesh 18
happy 18
to 18
lose 18
myself 18
when 18
gale 18
pulls 18
away 18
slightly 18
i 18
move 18
forward 18
to 18
close 18
the 18
gap 18
but 18
i 18
feel 18
his 18
hand 18
under 18
my 18
chin 18
katniss 18
he 18
says 18
the 18
instant 18
i 18
open 18
my 18
eyes 18
the 18
world 18
seems 18
disjointed 18
this 18
is 18
not 18
our 18
woods 18
or 18
our 18
mountains 18
or 18
our 18
way 18
my 18
hand 18
automatically 18
goes 18
to 18
the 18
scar 18
on 18
my 18
left 18
temple 18
which 18
i 18
associate 18
with 18
confusion 18
now 18
kiss 18
me 18
bewildered 18
unblinking 18
i 18
stand 18
there 18
while 18
he 18
leans 18
in 18
and 18
presses 18
his 18
lips 18
to 18
mine 18
briefly 18
he 18
examines 18
my 18
face 18
closely 18
whats 18
going 18
on 18
in 18
your 18
head 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
i 18
whisper 18
back 18
then 18
its 18
like 18
kissing 18
someone 18
whos 18
drunk 18
it 18
doesnt 18
count 18
he 18
says 18
with 18
a 18
weak 18
attempt 18
at 18
a 18
laugh 18
he 18
scoops 18
up 18
a 18
pile 18
of 18
kindling 18
and 18
drops 18
it 18
in 18
my 18
empty 18
arms 18
returning 18
me 18
to 18
myself 18
how 18
do 18
you 18
know 18
i 18
say 18
mostly 18
to 18
cover 18
my 18
embarrassment 18
have 18
you 18
kissed 18
someone 18
whos 18
drunk 18
i 18
guess 18
gale 18
couldve 18
been 18
kissing 18
girls 18
right 18
and 18
left 18
back 18
in 18
he 18
certainly 18
had 18
enough 18
takers 18
i 18
never 18
thought 18
about 18
it 18
much 18
before 18
he 18
just 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
no 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
hard 18
to 18
imagine 18
so 18
you 18
never 18
kissed 18
any 18
other 18
girls 18
i 18
ask 18
i 18
didnt 18
say 18
that 18
you 18
know 18
you 18
were 18
only 18
twelve 18
when 18
we 18
met 18
and 18
a 18
real 18
pain 18
besides 18
i 18
did 18
have 18
a 18
life 18
outside 18
of 18
hunting 18
with 18
you 18
he 18
says 18
loading 18
up 18
with 18
firewood 18
suddenly 18
im 18
genuinely 18
curious 18
who 18
did 18
you 18
kiss 18
and 18
where 18
too 18
many 18
to 18
remember 18
behind 18
the 18
school 18
on 18
the 18
slag 18
heap 18
you 18
name 18
it 18
he 18
says 18
i 18
roll 18
my 18
eyes 18
so 18
when 18
did 18
i 18
become 18
so 18
special 18
when 18
they 18
carted 18
me 18
off 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
no 18
about 18
six 18
months 18
before 18
that 18
right 18
after 18
new 18
years 18
we 18
were 18
in 18
the 18
hob 18
eating 18
some 18
slop 18
of 18
greasy 18
saes 18
and 18
darius 18
was 18
teasing 18
you 18
about 18
trading 18
a 18
rabbit 18
for 18
one 18
of 18
his 18
kisses 18
and 18
i 18
realizedi 18
minded 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
i 18
remember 18
that 18
day 18
bitter 18
cold 18
and 18
dark 18
by 18
four 18
in 18
the 18
afternoon 18
wed 18
been 18
hunting 18
but 18
a 18
heavy 18
snow 18
had 18
driven 18
us 18
back 18
into 18
town 18
the 18
hob 18
was 18
crowded 18
with 18
people 18
looking 18
for 18
refuge 18
from 18
the 18
weather 18
greasy 18
saes 18
soup 18
made 18
with 18
stock 18
from 18
the 18
bones 18
of 18
a 18
wild 18
dog 18
wed 18
shot 18
a 18
week 18
earlier 18
was 18
below 18
her 18
usual 18
standards 18
still 18
it 18
was 18
hot 18
and 18
i 18
was 18
starving 18
as 18
i 18
scooped 18
it 18
up 18
sitting 18
crosslegged 18
on 18
her 18
counter 18
darius 18
was 18
leaning 18
on 18
the 18
post 18
of 18
the 18
stall 18
tickling 18
my 18
cheek 18
with 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
my 18
braid 18
while 18
i 18
smacked 18
his 18
hand 18
away 18
he 18
was 18
explaining 18
why 18
one 18
of 18
his 18
kisses 18
merited 18
a 18
rabbit 18
or 18
possibly 18
two 18
since 18
everyone 18
knows 18
redheaded 18
men 18
are 18
the 18
most 18
virile 18
and 18
greasy 18
sae 18
and 18
i 18
were 18
laughing 18
because 18
he 18
was 18
so 18
ridiculous 18
and 18
persistent 18
and 18
kept 18
pointing 18
out 18
women 18
around 18
the 18
hob 18
who 18
he 18
said 18
had 18
paid 18
far 18
more 18
than 18
a 18
rabbit 18
to 18
enjoy 18
his 18
lips 18
see 18
the 18
one 18
in 18
the 18
green 18
muffler 18
go 18
ahead 18
and 18
ask 18
her 18
if 18
you 18
need 18
a 18
reference 18
a 18
million 18
miles 18
from 18
here 18
a 18
billion 18
days 18
ago 18
this 18
happened 18
darius 18
was 18
just 18
joking 18
around 18
i 18
say 18
probably 18
although 18
youd 18
be 18
the 18
last 18
to 18
figure 18
out 18
if 18
he 18
wasnt 18
gale 18
tells 18
me 18
take 18
peeta 18
take 18
me 18
or 18
even 18
finnick 18
i 18
was 18
starting 18
to 18
worry 18
he 18
had 18
his 18
eye 18
on 18
you 18
but 18
he 18
seems 18
back 18
on 18
track 18
now 18
you 18
dont 18
know 18
finnick 18
if 18
you 18
think 18
hed 18
love 18
me 18
i 18
say 18
gale 18
shrugs 18
i 18
know 18
he 18
was 18
desperate 18
that 18
makes 18
people 18
do 18
all 18
kinds 18
of 18
crazy 18
things 18
i 18
cant 18
help 18
thinking 18
thats 18
directed 18
at 18
me 18
bright 18
and 18
early 18
the 18
next 18
morning 18
the 18
brains 18
assemble 18
to 18
take 18
on 18
the 18
problem 18
of 18
the 18
nut 18
im 18
asked 18
to 18
the 18
meeting 18
although 18
i 18
dont 18
have 18
much 18
to 18
contribute 18
i 18
avoid 18
the 18
conference 18
table 18
and 18
perch 18
in 18
the 18
wide 18
windowsill 18
that 18
has 18
a 18
view 18
of 18
the 18
mountain 18
in 18
question 18
the 18
commander 18
from 18
a 18
middleaged 18
woman 18
named 18
lyme 18
takes 18
us 18
on 18
a 18
virtual 18
tour 18
of 18
the 18
nut 18
its 18
interior 18
and 18
fortifications 18
and 18
recounts 18
the 18
failed 18
attempts 18
to 18
seize 18
it 18
ive 18
crossed 18
paths 18
with 18
her 18
briefly 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
times 18
since 18
my 18
arrival 18
and 18
was 18
dogged 18
by 18
the 18
feeling 18
id 18
met 18
her 18
before 18
shes 18
memorable 18
enough 18
standing 18
over 18
six 18
feet 18
tall 18
and 18
heavily 18
muscled 18
but 18
its 18
only 18
when 18
i 18
see 18
a 18
clip 18
of 18
her 18
in 18
the 18
field 18
leading 18
a 18
raid 18
on 18
the 18
main 18
entrance 18
of 18
the 18
nut 18
that 18
something 18
clicks 18
and 18
i 18
realize 18
im 18
in 18
the 18
presence 18
of 18
another 18
victor 18
lyme 18
the 18
tribute 18
from 18
district 18
who 18
won 18
her 18
hunger 18
games 18
over 18
a 18
generation 18
ago 18
effie 18
sent 18
us 18
her 18
tape 18
among 18
others 18
to 18
prepare 18
for 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
ive 18
probably 18
caught 18
glimpses 18
of 18
her 18
during 18
the 18
games 18
over 18
the 18
years 18
but 18
shes 18
kept 18
a 18
low 18
profile 18
with 18
my 18
newfound 18
knowledge 18
of 18
haymitchs 18
and 18
finnicks 18
treatment 18
all 18
i 18
can 18
think 18
is 18
what 18
did 18
the 18
capitol 18
do 18
to 18
her 18
after 18
she 18
won 18
when 18
lyme 18
finishes 18
the 18
presentation 18
the 18
questions 18
from 18
the 18
brains 18
begin 18
hours 18
pass 18
and 18
lunch 18
comes 18
and 18
goes 18
as 18
they 18
try 18
to 18
come 18
up 18
with 18
a 18
realistic 18
plan 18
for 18
taking 18
the 18
nut 18
but 18
while 18
beetee 18
thinks 18
he 18
might 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
override 18
certain 18
computer 18
systems 18
and 18
theres 18
some 18
discussion 18
of 18
putting 18
the 18
handful 18
of 18
internal 18
spies 18
to 18
use 18
no 18
one 18
has 18
any 18
really 18
innovative 18
thoughts 18
as 18
the 18
afternoon 18
wears 18
on 18
talk 18
keeps 18
returning 18
to 18
a 18
strategy 18
that 18
has 18
been 18
tried 18
repeatedlythe 18
storming 18
of 18
the 18
entrances 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
lymes 18
frustration 18
building 18
because 18
so 18
many 18
variations 18
of 18
this 18
plan 18
have 18
already 18
failed 18
so 18
many 18
of 18
her 18
soldiers 18
have 18
been 18
lost 18
finally 18
she 18
bursts 18
out 18
the 18
next 18
person 18
who 18
suggests 18
we 18
take 18
the 18
entrances 18
better 18
have 18
a 18
brilliant 18
way 18
to 18
do 18
it 18
because 18
youre 18
going 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
one 18
leading 18
that 18
mission 18
gale 18
who 18
is 18
too 18
restless 18
to 18
sit 18
at 18
the 18
table 18
for 18
more 18
than 18
a 18
few 18
hours 18
has 18
been 18
alternating 18
between 18
pacing 18
and 18
sharing 18
my 18
windowsill 18
early 18
on 18
he 18
seemed 18
to 18
accept 18
lymes 18
assertion 18
that 18
the 18
entrances 18
couldnt 18
be 18
taken 18
and 18
dropped 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
conversation 18
entirely 18
for 18
the 18
last 18
hour 18
or 18
so 18
hes 18
sat 18
quietly 18
his 18
brow 18
knitted 18
in 18
concentration 18
staring 18
at 18
the 18
nut 18
through 18
the 18
window 18
glass 18
in 18
the 18
silence 18
that 18
follows 18
lymes 18
ultimatum 18
he 18
speaks 18
up 18
is 18
it 18
really 18
so 18
necessary 18
that 18
we 18
take 18
the 18
nut 18
or 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
enough 18
to 18
disable 18
it 18
that 18
would 18
be 18
a 18
step 18
in 18
the 18
right 18
direction 18
says 18
beetee 18
what 18
do 18
you 18
have 18
in 18
mind 18
think 18
of 18
it 18
as 18
a 18
wild 18
dog 18
den 18
gale 18
continues 18
youre 18
not 18
going 18
to 18
fight 18
your 18
way 18
in 18
so 18
you 18
have 18
two 18
choices 18
trap 18
the 18
dogs 18
inside 18
or 18
flush 18
them 18
out 18
weve 18
tried 18
bombing 18
the 18
entrances 18
says 18
lyme 18
theyre 18
set 18
too 18
far 18
inside 18
the 18
stone 18
for 18
any 18
real 18
damage 18
to 18
be 18
done 18
i 18
wasnt 18
thinking 18
of 18
that 18
says 18
gale 18
i 18
was 18
thinking 18
of 18
using 18
the 18
mountain 18
beetee 18
rises 18
and 18
joins 18
gale 18
at 18
the 18
window 18
peering 18
through 18
his 18
illfitting 18
glasses 18
see 18
running 18
down 18
the 18
sides 18
avalanche 18
paths 18
says 18
beetee 18
under 18
his 18
breath 18
itd 18
be 18
tricky 18
wed 18
have 18
to 18
design 18
the 18
detonation 18
sequence 18
with 18
great 18
care 18
and 18
once 18
its 18
in 18
motion 18
we 18
couldnt 18
hope 18
to 18
control 18
it 18
we 18
dont 18
need 18
to 18
control 18
it 18
if 18
we 18
give 18
up 18
the 18
idea 18
that 18
we 18
have 18
to 18
possess 18
the 18
nut 18
says 18
gale 18
only 18
shut 18
it 18
down 18
so 18
youre 18
suggesting 18
we 18
start 18
avalanches 18
and 18
block 18
the 18
entrances 18
asks 18
lyme 18
thats 18
it 18
says 18
gale 18
trap 18
the 18
enemy 18
inside 18
cut 18
off 18
from 18
supplies 18
make 18
it 18
impossible 18
for 18
them 18
to 18
send 18
out 18
their 18
hovercraft 18
while 18
everyone 18
considers 18
the 18
plan 18
boggs 18
flips 18
through 18
a 18
stack 18
of 18
blueprints 18
of 18
the 18
nut 18
and 18
frowns 18
you 18
risk 18
killing 18
everyone 18
inside 18
look 18
at 18
the 18
ventilation 18
system 18
its 18
rudimentary 18
at 18
best 18
nothing 18
like 18
what 18
we 18
have 18
in 18
thirteen 18
it 18
depends 18
entirely 18
on 18
pumping 18
in 18
air 18
from 18
the 18
mountainsides 18
block 18
those 18
vents 18
and 18
youll 18
suffocate 18
whoever 18
is 18
trapped 18
they 18
could 18
still 18
escape 18
through 18
the 18
train 18
tunnel 18
to 18
the 18
square 18
says 18
beetee 18
not 18
if 18
we 18
blow 18
it 18
up 18
says 18
gale 18
brusquely 18
his 18
intent 18
his 18
full 18
intent 18
becomes 18
clear 18
gale 18
has 18
no 18
interest 18
in 18
preserving 18
the 18
lives 18
of 18
those 18
in 18
the 18
nut 18
no 18
interest 18
in 18
caging 18
the 18
prey 18
for 18
later 18
use 18
this 18
is 18
one 18
of 18
his 18
death 18
traps 18
the 18
implications 18
of 18
what 18
gale 18
is 18
suggesting 18
settle 18
quietly 18
around 18
the 18
room 18
you 18
can 18
see 18
the 18
reaction 18
playing 18
out 18
on 18
peoples 18
faces 18
the 18
expressions 18
range 18
from 18
pleasure 18
to 18
distress 18
from 18
sorrow 18
to 18
satisfaction 18
the 18
majority 18
of 18
the 18
workers 18
are 18
citizens 18
from 18
two 18
says 18
beetee 18
neutrally 18
so 18
what 18
says 18
gale 18
well 18
never 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
trust 18
them 18
again 18
they 18
should 18
at 18
least 18
have 18
a 18
chance 18
to 18
surrender 18
says 18
lyme 18
well 18
thats 18
a 18
luxury 18
we 18
werent 18
given 18
when 18
they 18
firebombed 18
twelve 18
but 18
youre 18
all 18
so 18
much 18
cozier 18
with 18
the 18
capitol 18
here 18
says 18
gale 18
by 18
the 18
look 18
on 18
lymes 18
face 18
i 18
think 18
she 18
might 18
shoot 18
him 18
or 18
at 18
least 18
take 18
a 18
swing 18
shed 18
probably 18
have 18
the 18
upper 18
hand 18
too 18
with 18
all 18
her 18
training 18
but 18
her 18
anger 18
only 18
seems 18
to 18
infuriate 18
him 18
and 18
he 18
yells 18
we 18
watched 18
children 18
burn 18
to 18
death 18
and 18
there 18
was 18
nothing 18
we 18
could 18
do 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
close 18
my 18
eyes 18
a 18
minute 18
as 18
the 18
image 18
rips 18
through 18
me 18
it 18
has 18
the 18
desired 18
effect 18
i 18
want 18
everyone 18
in 18
that 18
mountain 18
dead 18
am 18
about 18
to 18
say 18
so 18
but 18
thenim 18
also 18
a 18
girl 18
from 18
district 18
not 18
president 18
snow 18
i 18
cant 18
help 18
it 18
i 18
cant 18
condemn 18
someone 18
to 18
the 18
death 18
hes 18
suggesting 18
gale 18
i 18
say 18
taking 18
his 18
arm 18
and 18
trying 18
to 18
speak 18
in 18
a 18
reasonable 18
tone 18
the 18
nuts 18
an 18
old 18
mine 18
itd 18
be 18
like 18
causing 18
a 18
massive 18
coal 18
mining 18
accident 18
surely 18
the 18
words 18
are 18
enough 18
to 18
make 18
anyone 18
from 18
think 18
twice 18
about 18
the 18
plan 18
but 18
not 18
so 18
quick 18
as 18
the 18
one 18
that 18
killed 18
our 18
fathers 18
he 18
retorts 18
is 18
that 18
everyones 18
problem 18
that 18
our 18
enemies 18
might 18
have 18
a 18
few 18
hours 18
to 18
reflect 18
on 18
the 18
fact 18
that 18
theyre 18
dying 18
instead 18
of 18
just 18
being 18
blown 18
to 18
bits 18
back 18
in 18
the 18
old 18
days 18
when 18
we 18
were 18
nothing 18
more 18
than 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
kids 18
hunting 18
outside 18
of 18
gale 18
said 18
things 18
like 18
this 18
and 18
worse 18
but 18
then 18
they 18
were 18
just 18
words 18
here 18
put 18
into 18
practice 18
they 18
become 18
deeds 18
that 18
can 18
never 18
be 18
reversed 18
you 18
dont 18
know 18
how 18
those 18
district 18
two 18
people 18
ended 18
up 18
in 18
the 18
nut 18
i 18
say 18
they 18
may 18
have 18
been 18
coerced 18
they 18
may 18
be 18
held 18
against 18
their 18
will 18
some 18
are 18
our 18
own 18
spies 18
will 18
you 18
kill 18
them 18
too 18
i 18
would 18
sacrifice 18
a 18
few 18
yes 18
to 18
take 18
out 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
them 18
he 18
replies 18
and 18
if 18
i 18
were 18
a 18
spy 18
in 18
there 18
id 18
say 18
bring 18
on 18
the 18
avalanches 18
i 18
know 18
hes 18
telling 18
the 18
truth 18
that 18
gale 18
would 18
sacrifice 18
his 18
life 18
in 18
this 18
way 18
for 18
the 18
causeno 18
one 18
doubts 18
it 18
perhaps 18
wed 18
all 18
do 18
the 18
same 18
if 18
we 18
were 18
the 18
spies 18
and 18
given 18
the 18
choice 18
i 18
guess 18
i 18
would 18
but 18
its 18
a 18
coldhearted 18
decision 18
to 18
make 18
for 18
other 18
people 18
and 18
those 18
who 18
love 18
them 18
you 18
said 18
we 18
had 18
two 18
choices 18
boggs 18
tells 18
him 18
to 18
trap 18
them 18
or 18
to 18
flush 18
them 18
out 18
i 18
say 18
we 18
try 18
to 18
avalanche 18
the 18
mountain 18
but 18
leave 18
the 18
train 18
tunnel 18
alone 18
people 18
can 18
escape 18
into 18
the 18
square 18
where 18
well 18
be 18
waiting 18
for 18
them 18
heavily 18
armed 18
i 18
hope 18
says 18
gale 18
you 18
can 18
be 18
sure 18
theyll 18
be 18
heavily 18
armed 18
well 18
take 18
them 18
prisoner 18
agrees 18
boggs 18
lets 18
bring 18
thirteen 18
into 18
the 18
loop 18
now 18
beetee 18
suggests 18
let 18
president 18
coin 18
weigh 18
in 18
shell 18
want 18
to 18
block 18
the 18
tunnel 18
says 18
gale 18
with 18
conviction 18
yes 18
most 18
likely 18
but 18
you 18
know 18
peeta 18
did 18
have 18
a 18
point 18
in 18
his 18
propos 18
about 18
the 18
dangers 18
of 18
killing 18
ourselves 18
off 18
ive 18
been 18
playing 18
with 18
some 18
numbers 18
factoring 18
in 18
the 18
casualties 18
and 18
the 18
wounded 18
andi 18
think 18
its 18
at 18
least 18
worth 18
a 18
conversation 18
says 18
beetee 18
only 18
a 18
handful 18
of 18
people 18
are 18
invited 18
to 18
be 18
part 18
of 18
that 18
conversation 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
are 18
released 18
with 18
the 18
rest 18
i 18
take 18
him 18
hunting 18
so 18
he 18
can 18
blow 18
off 18
some 18
steam 18
but 18
hes 18
not 18
talking 18
about 18
it 18
probably 18
too 18
angry 18
with 18
me 18
for 18
countering 18
him 18
the 18
call 18
does 18
happen 18
a 18
decision 18
is 18
made 18
and 18
by 18
evening 18
im 18
suited 18
up 18
in 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
outfit 18
with 18
my 18
bow 18
slung 18
over 18
my 18
shoulder 18
and 18
an 18
earpiece 18
that 18
connects 18
me 18
to 18
haymitch 18
in 18
just 18
in 18
case 18
a 18
good 18
opportunity 18
for 18
a 18
propo 18
arises 18
we 18
wait 18
on 18
the 18
roof 18
of 18
the 18
justice 18
building 18
with 18
a 18
clear 18
view 18
of 18
our 18
target 18
our 18
hoverplanes 18
are 18
initially 18
ignored 18
by 18
the 18
commanders 18
in 18
the 18
nut 18
because 18
in 18
the 18
past 18
theyve 18
been 18
little 18
more 18
trouble 18
than 18
flies 18
buzzing 18
around 18
a 18
honeypot 18
but 18
after 18
two 18
rounds 18
of 18
bombings 18
in 18
the 18
higher 18
elevations 18
of 18
the 18
mountain 18
the 18
planes 18
have 18
their 18
attention 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
the 18
capitols 18
antiaircraft 18
weapons 18
begin 18
to 18
fire 18
its 18
already 18
too 18
late 18
gales 18
plan 18
exceeds 18
anyones 18
expectations 18
beetee 18
was 18
right 18
about 18
being 18
unable 18
to 18
control 18
the 18
avalanches 18
once 18
theyd 18
been 18
set 18
in 18
motion 18
the 18
mountainsides 18
are 18
naturally 18
unstable 18
but 18
weakened 18
by 18
the 18
explosions 18
they 18
seem 18
almost 18
fluid 18
whole 18
sections 18
of 18
the 18
nut 18
collapse 18
before 18
our 18
eyes 18
obliterating 18
any 18
sign 18
that 18
human 18
beings 18
have 18
ever 18
set 18
foot 18
on 18
the 18
place 18
we 18
stand 18
speechless 18
tiny 18
and 18
insignificant 18
as 18
waves 18
of 18
stone 18
thunder 18
down 18
the 18
mountain 18
burying 18
the 18
entrances 18
under 18
tons 18
of 18
rock 18
raising 18
a 18
cloud 18
of 18
dirt 18
and 18
debris 18
that 18
blackens 18
the 18
sky 18
turning 18
the 18
nut 18
into 18
a 18
tomb 18
i 18
imagine 18
the 18
hell 18
inside 18
the 18
mountain 18
sirens 18
wailing 18
lights 18
flickering 18
into 18
darkness 18
stone 18
dust 18
choking 18
the 18
air 18
the 18
shrieks 18
of 18
panicked 18
trapped 18
beings 18
stumbling 18
madly 18
for 18
a 18
way 18
out 18
only 18
to 18
find 18
the 18
entrances 18
the 18
launchpad 18
the 18
ventilation 18
shafts 18
themselves 18
clogged 18
with 18
earth 18
and 18
rock 18
trying 18
to 18
force 18
its 18
way 18
in 18
live 18
wires 18
flung 18
free 18
fires 18
breaking 18
out 18
rubble 18
making 18
a 18
familiar 18
path 18
a 18
maze 18
people 18
slamming 18
shoving 18
scrambling 18
like 18
ants 18
as 18
the 18
hill 18
presses 18
in 18
threatening 18
to 18
crush 18
their 18
fragile 18
shells 18
katniss 18
haymitchs 18
voice 18
is 18
in 18
my 18
earpiece 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
answer 18
back 18
and 18
find 18
both 18
of 18
my 18
hands 18
are 18
clamped 18
tightly 18
over 18
my 18
mouth 18
katniss 18
on 18
the 18
day 18
my 18
father 18
died 18
the 18
sirens 18
went 18
off 18
during 18
my 18
school 18
lunch 18
no 18
one 18
waited 18
for 18
dismissal 18
or 18
was 18
expected 18
to 18
the 18
response 18
to 18
a 18
mine 18
accident 18
was 18
something 18
outside 18
the 18
control 18
of 18
even 18
the 18
capitol 18
i 18
ran 18
to 18
prims 18
class 18
i 18
still 18
remember 18
her 18
tiny 18
at 18
seven 18
very 18
pale 18
but 18
sitting 18
straight 18
up 18
with 18
her 18
hands 18
folded 18
on 18
her 18
desk 18
waiting 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
collect 18
her 18
as 18
id 18
promised 18
i 18
would 18
if 18
the 18
sirens 18
ever 18
sounded 18
she 18
sprang 18
out 18
of 18
her 18
seat 18
grabbed 18
my 18
coat 18
sleeve 18
and 18
we 18
wove 18
through 18
the 18
streams 18
of 18
people 18
pouring 18
out 18
onto 18
the 18
streets 18
to 18
pool 18
at 18
the 18
main 18
entrance 18
of 18
the 18
mine 18
we 18
found 18
our 18
mother 18
clenching 18
the 18
rope 18
that 18
had 18
been 18
hastily 18
strung 18
to 18
keep 18
the 18
crowd 18
back 18
in 18
retrospect 18
i 18
guess 18
i 18
should 18
have 18
known 18
there 18
was 18
a 18
problem 18
right 18
then 18
because 18
why 18
were 18
we 18
looking 18
for 18
her 18
when 18
the 18
reverse 18
should 18
have 18
been 18
true 18
the 18
elevators 18
were 18
screeching 18
burning 18
up 18
and 18
down 18
their 18
cables 18
as 18
they 18
vomited 18
smokeblackened 18
miners 18
into 18
the 18
light 18
of 18
day 18
with 18
each 18
group 18
came 18
cries 18
of 18
relief 18
relatives 18
diving 18
under 18
the 18
rope 18
to 18
lead 18
off 18
their 18
husbands 18
wives 18
children 18
parents 18
siblings 18
we 18
stood 18
in 18
the 18
freezing 18
air 18
as 18
the 18
afternoon 18
turned 18
overcast 18
a 18
light 18
snow 18
dusted 18
the 18
earth 18
the 18
elevators 18
moved 18
more 18
slowly 18
now 18
and 18
disgorged 18
fewer 18
beings 18
i 18
knelt 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
and 18
pressed 18
my 18
hands 18
into 18
the 18
cinders 18
wanting 18
so 18
badly 18
to 18
pull 18
my 18
father 18
free 18
if 18
theres 18
a 18
more 18
helpless 18
feeling 18
than 18
trying 18
to 18
reach 18
someone 18
you 18
love 18
whos 18
trapped 18
underground 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
it 18
the 18
wounded 18
the 18
bodies 18
the 18
waiting 18
through 18
the 18
night 18
blankets 18
put 18
around 18
your 18
shoulders 18
by 18
strangers 18
a 18
mug 18
of 18
something 18
hot 18
that 18
you 18
dont 18
drink 18
and 18
then 18
finally 18
at 18
dawn 18
the 18
grieved 18
expression 18
on 18
the 18
face 18
of 18
the 18
mine 18
captain 18
that 18
could 18
only 18
mean 18
one 18
thing 18
what 18
did 18
we 18
just 18
do 18
katniss 18

soldiers 18
manning 18
the 18
machine 18
guns 18

to 18

their 18
way 18
inside 18

the 18
stairs 18
i 18
cant 18
help 18
brushing 18
my 18
fingers 18
along 18
the 18
unblemished 18
white 18
marble 18
walls 18
so 18
cold 18
and 18
beautiful 18
even 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
match 18
the 18
magnificence 18
of 18
this 18
old 18
building 18
but 18
there 18
is 18
no 18
give 18
to 18
the 18
surfaceonly 18
my 18
flesh 18
yields 18
my 18
warmth 18
taken 18
stone 18
conquers 18
people 18
every 18
time 18
i 18
sit 18
at 18
the 18
base 18
of 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
gigantic 18
pillars 18
in 18
the 18
great 18
entrance 18
hall 18
through 18
the 18
doors 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
the 18
white 18
expanse 18
of 18
marble 18
that 18
leads 18
to 18
the 18
steps 18
on 18
the 18
square 18
i 18
remember 18
how 18
sick 18
i 18
was 18
the 18
day 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
accepted 18
congratulations 18
there 18
for 18
winning 18
the 18
games 18
worn 18
down 18
by 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
failing 18
in 18
my 18
attempt 18
to 18
calm 18
the 18
districts 18
facing 18
the 18
memories 18
of 18
clove 18
and 18
cato 18
particularly 18
catos 18
gruesome 18
slow 18
death 18
by 18
mutts 18
boggs 18
crouches 18
down 18
beside 18
me 18
his 18
skin 18
pale 18
in 18
the 18
shadows 18
we 18
didnt 18
bomb 18
the 18
train 18
tunnel 18
you 18
know 18
some 18
of 18
them 18
will 18
probably 18
get 18
out 18
and 18
then 18
well 18
shoot 18
them 18
when 18
they 18
show 18
their 18
faces 18
i 18
ask 18
only 18
if 18
we 18
have 18
to 18
he 18
answers 18
we 18
could 18
send 18
in 18
trains 18
ourselves 18
help 18
evacuate 18
the 18
wounded 18
i 18
say 18
no 18
it 18
was 18
decided 18
to 18
leave 18
the 18
tunnel 18
in 18
their 18
hands 18
that 18
way 18
they 18
can 18
use 18
all 18
the 18
tracks 18
to 18
bring 18
people 18
out 18
says 18
boggs 18
besides 18
it 18
will 18
give 18
us 18
time 18
to 18
get 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
our 18
soldiers 18
to 18
the 18
square 18
a 18
few 18
hours 18
ago 18
the 18
square 18
was 18
a 18
nomansland 18
the 18
front 18
line 18
of 18
the 18
fight 18
between 18
the 18
rebels 18
and 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
when 18
coin 18
gave 18
approval 18
for 18
gales 18
plan 18
the 18
rebels 18
launched 18
a 18
heated 18
attack 18
and 18
drove 18
the 18
capitol 18
forces 18
back 18
several 18
blocks 18
so 18
that 18
we 18
would 18
control 18
the 18
train 18
station 18
in 18
the 18
event 18
that 18
the 18
nut 18
fell 18
well 18
its 18
fallen 18
the 18
reality 18
has 18
sunk 18
in 18
any 18
survivors 18
will 18
escape 18
to 18
the 18
square 18
i 18
can 18
hear 18
the 18
gunfire 18
starting 18
again 18
as 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
are 18
no 18
doubt 18
trying 18
to 18
fight 18
their 18
way 18
in 18
to 18
rescue 18
their 18
comrades 18
our 18
own 18
soldiers 18
are 18
being 18
brought 18
in 18
to 18
counter 18
this 18
youre 18
cold 18
says 18
boggs 18
ill 18
see 18
if 18
i 18
can 18
find 18
a 18
blanket 18
he 18
goes 18
before 18
i 18
can 18
protest 18
i 18
dont 18
want 18
a 18
blanket 18
even 18
if 18
the 18
marble 18
continues 18
to 18
leech 18
my 18
body 18
heat 18
katniss 18
says 18
haymitch 18
in 18
my 18
ear 18
still 18
here 18
i 18
answer 18
interesting 18
turn 18
of 18
events 18
with 18
peeta 18
this 18
afternoon 18
thought 18
youd 18
want 18
to 18
know 18
he 18
says 18
interesting 18
isnt 18
good 18
it 18
isnt 18
better 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
really 18
have 18
any 18
choice 18
but 18
to 18
listen 18
we 18
showed 18
him 18
that 18
clip 18
of 18
you 18
singing 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
it 18
was 18
never 18
aired 18
so 18
the 18
capitol 18
couldnt 18
use 18
it 18
when 18
he 18
was 18
being 18
hijacked 18
he 18
says 18
he 18
recognized 18
the 18
song 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
my 18
heart 18
skips 18
a 18
beat 18
then 18
i 18
realize 18
its 18
just 18
more 18
tracker 18
jacker 18
serum 18
confusion 18
he 18
couldnt 18
haymitch 18
he 18
never 18
heard 18
me 18
sing 18
that 18
song 18
not 18
you 18
your 18
father 18
he 18
heard 18
him 18
singing 18
it 18
one 18
day 18
when 18
he 18
came 18
to 18
trade 18
at 18
the 18
bakery 18
peeta 18
was 18
small 18
probably 18
six 18
or 18
seven 18
but 18
he 18
remembered 18
it 18
because 18
he 18
was 18
specially 18
listening 18
to 18
see 18
if 18
the 18
birds 18
stopped 18
singing 18
says 18
haymitch 18
guess 18
they 18
did 18
six 18
or 18
seven 18
that 18
would 18
have 18
been 18
before 18
my 18
mother 18
banned 18
the 18
song 18
maybe 18
even 18
right 18
around 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
was 18
learning 18
it 18
was 18
i 18
there 18
too 18
dont 18
think 18
so 18
no 18
mention 18
of 18
you 18
anyway 18
but 18
its 18
the 18
first 18
connection 18
to 18
you 18
that 18
hasnt 18
triggered 18
some 18
mental 18
meltdown 18
says 18
haymitch 18
its 18
something 18
at 18
least 18
katniss 18
my 18
father 18
he 18
seems 18
to 18
be 18
everywhere 18
today 18
dying 18
in 18
the 18
mine 18
singing 18
his 18
way 18
into 18
peetas 18
muddled 18
consciousness 18
flickering 18
in 18
the 18
look 18
boggs 18
gives 18
me 18
as 18
he 18
protectively 18
wraps 18
the 18
blanket 18
around 18
my 18
shoulders 18
i 18
miss 18
him 18
so 18
badly 18
it 18
hurts 18
the 18
gunfires 18
really 18
picking 18
up 18
outside 18
gale 18
hurries 18
by 18
with 18
a 18
group 18
of 18
rebels 18
eagerly 18
headed 18
for 18
the 18
battle 18
i 18
dont 18
petition 18
to 18
join 18
the 18
fighters 18
not 18
that 18
they 18
would 18
let 18
me 18
i 18
have 18
no 18
stomach 18
for 18
it 18
anyway 18
no 18
heat 18
in 18
my 18
blood 18
i 18
wish 18
peeta 18
was 18
herethe 18
old 18
peetabecause 18
he 18
would 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
articulate 18
why 18
it 18
is 18
so 18
wrong 18
to 18
be 18
exchanging 18
fire 18
when 18
people 18
any 18
people 18
are 18
trying 18
to 18
claw 18
their 18
way 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
mountain 18
or 18
is 18
my 18
own 18
history 18
making 18
me 18
too 18
sensitive 18
arent 18
we 18
at 18
war 18
isnt 18
this 18
just 18
another 18
way 18
to 18
kill 18
our 18
enemies 18
night 18
falls 18
quickly 18
huge 18
bright 18
spotlights 18
are 18
turned 18
on 18
illuminating 18
the 18
square 18
every 18
bulb 18
must 18
be 18
burning 18
at 18
full 18
wattage 18
inside 18
the 18
train 18
station 18
as 18
well 18
even 18
from 18
my 18
position 18
across 18
the 18
square 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
clearly 18
through 18
the 18
plateglass 18
front 18
of 18
the 18
long 18
narrow 18
building 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
impossible 18
to 18
miss 18
the 18
arrival 18
of 18
a 18
train 18
or 18
even 18
a 18
single 18
person 18
but 18
hours 18
pass 18
and 18
no 18
one 18
comes 18
with 18
each 18
minute 18
it 18
becomes 18
harder 18
to 18
imagine 18
that 18
anyone 18
survived 18
the 18
assault 18
on 18
the 18
nut 18
its 18
well 18
after 18
midnight 18
when 18
cressida 18

early 18
experiments 18
with 18

lot 18
of 18

a 18
huge 18
image 18
of 18
me 18
lights 18
up 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
screens 18
over 18
the 18

katniss 18
everdeen 18
speaking 18
to 18
you 18
from 18
the 18
steps 18
of 18
your 18
justice 18
building 18
where 18
the 18
pair 18
of 18
trains 18
comes 18
screeching 18
into 18
the 18
train 18
station 18
side 18
by 18
side 18
as 18
the 18
doors 18
slide 18
open 18
people 18
tumble 18
out 18
in 18
a 18
cloud 18
of 18
smoke 18
theyve 18
brought 18
from 18
the 18
nut 18
they 18
must 18
have 18
had 18
at 18
least 18
an 18
inkling 18
of 18
what 18
would 18
await 18
them 18
at 18
the 18
square 18
because 18
you 18
can 18
see 18
them 18
trying 18
to 18
act 18
evasively 18
most 18
of 18
them 18
flatten 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
and 18
a 18
spray 18
of 18
bullets 18
inside 18
the 18
station 18
takes 18
out 18
the 18
lights 18
theyve 18
come 18
armed 18
as 18
gale 18
predicted 18
but 18
theyve 18
come 18
wounded 18
as 18
well 18
the 18
moans 18
can 18
be 18
heard 18
in 18
the 18
otherwise 18
silent 18
night 18
air 18
someone 18
kills 18
the 18
lights 18
on 18
the 18
stairs 18
leaving 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
protection 18
of 18
shadow 18
a 18
flame 18
blooms 18
inside 18
the 18
station 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
trains 18

actually 18
be 18
on 18

a 18
thick 18
black 18
smoke 18
billows 18
against 18
the 18
windows 18
left 18
with 18
no 18
choice 18
the 18
people 18
begin 18
to 18
push 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
square 18
choking 18
but 18
defiantly 18
waving 18
their 18
guns 18
my 18
eyes 18
dart 18
around 18
the 18
rooftops 18
that 18
ring 18
the 18
square 18
every 18
one 18
of 18
them 18
has 18
been 18
fortified 18
with 18
rebelmanned 18
machine 18
gun 18
nests 18
moonlight 18
glints 18
off 18
oiled 18
barrels 18
a 18
young 18
man 18
staggers 18
out 18
from 18
the 18
station 18
one 18
hand 18
pressed 18
against 18
a 18
bloody 18
cloth 18
at 18
his 18
cheek 18
the 18
other 18
dragging 18
a 18
gun 18
when 18
he 18
trips 18
and 18
falls 18
to 18
his 18
face 18
i 18
see 18
the 18
scorch 18
marks 18
down 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
his 18
shirt 18
the 18
red 18
flesh 18
beneath 18
and 18
suddenly 18
hes 18
just 18
another 18
burn 18
victim 18
from 18
a 18
mine 18
accident 18
my 18
feet 18
fly 18
down 18
the 18
steps 18
and 18
i 18
take 18
off 18
running 18
for 18
him 18
stop 18
i 18
yell 18
at 18
the 18
rebels 18
hold 18
your 18
fire 18
the 18
words 18
echo 18
around 18
the 18
square 18
and 18
beyond 18
as 18
the 18
mike 18
amplifies 18
my 18
voice 18
stop 18
im 18
nearing 18
the 18
young 18
man 18
reaching 18
down 18
to 18
help 18
him 18
when 18
he 18
drags 18
himself 18
up 18
to 18
his 18
knees 18
and 18
trains 18
his 18
gun 18
on 18
my 18
head 18
i 18
instinctively 18
back 18
up 18
a 18
few 18
steps 18
raise 18
my 18
bow 18
over 18
my 18
head 18
to 18
show 18
my 18
intention 18
was 18
harmless 18
now 18
that 18
he 18
has 18
both 18
hands 18
on 18
his 18
gun 18
i 18
notice 18
the 18
ragged 18
hole 18
in 18
his 18
cheek 18
where 18
somethingfalling 18
stone 18
maybepunctured 18
the 18
flesh 18
he 18
smells 18
of 18
burning 18
things 18
hair 18
and 18
meat 18
and 18
fuel 18
his 18
eyes 18
are 18
crazed 18
with 18
pain 18
and 18
fear 18
freeze 18
haymitchs 18
voice 18
whispers 18
in 18
my 18
ear 18
i 18
follow 18
his 18
order 18
realizing 18
that 18
this 18
is 18
what 18
all 18
of 18
district 18
all 18
of 18
panem 18
maybe 18
must 18
be 18
seeing 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
at 18
the 18
mercy 18
of 18
a 18
man 18
with 18
nothing 18
to 18
lose 18
his 18
garbled 18
speech 18
is 18
barely 18
comprehensible 18
give 18
me 18
one 18
reason 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
shoot 18
you 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
world 18
recedes 18
theres 18
only 18
me 18
looking 18
into 18
the 18
wretched 18
eyes 18
of 18
the 18
man 18
from 18
the 18
nut 18
who 18
asks 18
for 18
one 18
reason 18
surely 18
i 18
should 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
come 18
up 18
with 18
thousands 18
but 18
the 18
words 18
that 18
make 18
it 18
to 18
my 18
lips 18
are 18
i 18
cant 18
logically 18
the 18
next 18
thing 18
that 18
should 18
happen 18
is 18
the 18
man 18
pulling 18
the 18
trigger 18
but 18
hes 18
perplexed 18
trying 18
to 18
make 18
sense 18
of 18
my 18
words 18
i 18
experience 18
my 18
own 18
confusion 18
as 18
i 18
realize 18
what 18
ive 18
said 18
is 18
entirely 18
true 18
and 18
the 18
noble 18
impulse 18
that 18
carried 18
me 18
across 18
the 18
square 18
is 18
replaced 18
by 18
despair 18
i 18
cant 18
thats 18
the 18
problem 18
isnt 18
it 18
i 18
lower 18
my 18
bow 18

blew 18
up 18
your 18
mine 18

burned 18
my 18
district 18
to 18
the 18
ground 18
weve 18
got 18
every 18
reason 18
to 18
kill 18
each 18
other 18
so 18
do 18
it 18
make 18
the 18
capitol 18
happy 18

done 18
killing 18
their 18
slaves 18
for 18
them 18
i 18
drop 18
my 18
bow 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
and 18
give 18
it 18
a 18
nudge 18
with 18
my 18
boot 18
it 18
slides 18
across 18
the 18
stone 18
and 18
comes 18
to 18
rest 18
at 18
his 18
knees 18

the 18
districts 18

of 18

a 18
piece 18
in 18
their 18
games 18
peeta 18
on 18

that 18
he 18
remembers 18
that 18
night 18
as 18
it 18
happened 18
and 18
maybe 18
forgives 18
me 18
when 18
i 18
die 18
keep 18
talking 18
tell 18
them 18
about 18

the 18
young 18

at 18
me 18
uncomprehendingly 18
i 18
sink 18
on 18
my 18
knees 18
before 18
him 18
my 18
voice 18

and 18

gun 18
off 18
me 18

slowly 18
in 18
a 18
circle 18

you 18
up 18
there 18
i 18

from 18

miners 18
condemn 18
other 18
miners 18
to 18
that 18
kind 18
of 18
death 18
and 18
then 18
stand 18
by 18
to 18
kill 18
whoever 18
manages 18
to 18

on 18
me 18

to 18
the 18
man 18

join 18
us 18
my 18
words 18
hang 18
in 18
the 18
air 18
i 18
look 18
to 18
the 18
screen 18
hoping 18
to 18
see 18
them 18
recording 18
some 18
wave 18
of 18
reconciliation 18
going 18
through 18
the 18
crowd 18
instead 18
i 18
watch 18
myself 18
get 18
shot 18
on 18
television 18
always 18
in 18
the 18
twilight 18
of 18
morphling 18
peeta 18
whispers 18
the 18
word 18
and 18
i 18
go 18
searching 18
for 18
him 18
its 18
a 18
gauzy 18
violettinted 18
world 18
with 18
no 18
hard 18
edges 18
and 18
many 18
places 18
to 18
hide 18
i 18
push 18
through 18
cloud 18
banks 18
follow 18
faint 18
tracks 18
catch 18
the 18
scent 18
of 18
cinnamon 18
of 18
dill 18
once 18
i 18
feel 18
his 18
hand 18
on 18
my 18
cheek 18
and 18
try 18
to 18
trap 18
it 18
but 18
it 18
dissolves 18
like 18
mist 18
through 18
my 18
fingers 18
when 18
i 18
finally 18
begin 18
to 18
surface 18
into 18
the 18
sterile 18
hospital 18
room 18
in 18
i 18
remember 18
i 18
was 18
under 18
the 18
influence 18
of 18
sleep 18
syrup 18
my 18
heel 18
had 18
been 18
injured 18
after 18
id 18
climbed 18
out 18
on 18
a 18
branch 18
over 18
the 18
electric 18
fence 18
and 18
dropped 18
back 18
into 18
peeta 18
had 18
put 18
me 18
to 18
bed 18
and 18
i 18
had 18
asked 18
him 18
to 18
stay 18
with 18
me 18
as 18
i 18
was 18
drifting 18
off 18
he 18
had 18
whispered 18
something 18
i 18
couldnt 18
quite 18
catch 18
but 18
some 18
part 18
of 18
my 18
brain 18
had 18
trapped 18
his 18
single 18
word 18
of 18
reply 18
and 18
let 18
it 18
swim 18
up 18
through 18
my 18
dreams 18
to 18
taunt 18
me 18
now 18
always 18
morphling 18
dulls 18
the 18
extremes 18
of 18
all 18
emotions 18
so 18
instead 18
of 18
a 18
stab 18
of 18
sorrow 18
i 18
merely 18
feel 18
emptiness 18
a 18
hollow 18
of 18
dead 18
brush 18
where 18
flowers 18
used 18
to 18
bloom 18
unfortunately 18
theres 18
not 18
enough 18
of 18
the 18
drug 18
left 18
in 18
my 18
veins 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
ignore 18
the 18
pain 18
in 18
the 18
left 18
side 18
of 18
my 18
body 18
thats 18
where 18
the 18
bullet 18
hit 18
my 18
hands 18
fumble 18
over 18
the 18
thick 18
bandages 18
encasing 18
my 18
ribs 18
and 18
i 18
wonder 18
what 18
im 18
still 18
doing 18
here 18
it 18
wasnt 18
him 18
the 18
man 18
kneeling 18
before 18
me 18
on 18
the 18
square 18
the 18
burned 18
one 18
from 18
the 18
nut 18
he 18
didnt 18
pull 18
the 18
trigger 18
it 18
was 18
someone 18
farther 18
back 18
in 18
the 18
crowd 18
there 18
was 18
less 18
a 18
sense 18
of 18
penetration 18
than 18
the 18
feeling 18
that 18
id 18
been 18
struck 18
with 18
a 18
sledgehammer 18
everything 18
after 18
the 18
moment 18
of 18
impact 18
is 18
confusion 18
riddled 18
with 18
gunfire 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
sit 18
up 18
but 18
the 18
only 18
thing 18
i 18
manage 18
is 18
a 18
moan 18
the 18
white 18
curtain 18
that 18
divides 18
my 18
bed 18
from 18
the 18
next 18
patients 18
whips 18
back 18
and 18
johanna 18
mason 18
stares 18
down 18
at 18
me 18
at 18
first 18
i 18
feel 18
threatened 18
because 18
she 18
attacked 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
remind 18
myself 18
that 18
she 18
did 18
it 18
to 18
save 18
my 18
life 18
it 18
was 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
rebel 18
plot 18
but 18
still 18
that 18
doesnt 18
mean 18
she 18
doesnt 18
despise 18
me 18
maybe 18
her 18
treatment 18
of 18
me 18
was 18
all 18
an 18
act 18
for 18
the 18
capitol 18
im 18
alive 18
i 18
say 18
rustily 18
no 18
kidding 18
brainless 18
johanna 18
walks 18
over 18
and 18
plunks 18
down 18
on 18
my 18
bed 18
sending 18
spikes 18
of 18
pain 18
shooting 18
across 18
my 18
chest 18
when 18
she 18
grins 18
at 18
my 18
discomfort 18
i 18
know 18
were 18
not 18
in 18
for 18
some 18
warm 18
reunion 18
scene 18
still 18
a 18
little 18
sore 18
with 18
an 18
expert 18
hand 18
she 18
quickly 18
detaches 18
the 18
morphling 18
drip 18
from 18
my 18
arm 18
and 18
plugs 18
it 18
into 18
a 18
socket 18
taped 18
into 18
the 18
crook 18
of 18
her 18
own 18
they 18
started 18
cutting 18
back 18
my 18
supply 18
a 18
few 18
days 18
ago 18
afraid 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
turn 18
into 18
one 18
of 18
those 18
freaks 18
from 18
six 18
ive 18
had 18
to 18
borrow 18
from 18
you 18
when 18
the 18
coast 18
was 18
clear 18
didnt 18
think 18
youd 18
mind 18
mind 18
how 18
can 18
i 18
mind 18
when 18
she 18
was 18
almost 18
tortured 18
to 18
death 18
by 18
snow 18
after 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
i 18
have 18
no 18
right 18
to 18
mind 18
and 18
she 18
knows 18
it 18
johanna 18
sighs 18
as 18
the 18
morphling 18
enters 18
her 18
bloodstream 18
maybe 18
they 18
were 18
onto 18
something 18
in 18
six 18
drug 18
yourself 18
out 18
and 18
paint 18
flowers 18
on 18
your 18
body 18
not 18
such 18
a 18
bad 18
life 18
seemed 18
happier 18
than 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
anyway 18
in 18
the 18
weeks 18
since 18
i 18
left 18
shes 18
gained 18
some 18
weight 18
back 18
a 18
soft 18
down 18
of 18
hair 18
has 18
sprouted 18
on 18
her 18
shaved 18
head 18
helping 18
to 18
hide 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
scars 18
but 18
if 18
shes 18
siphoning 18
off 18
my 18
morphling 18
shes 18
struggling 18
theyve 18
got 18
this 18
head 18
doctor 18
who 18
comes 18
around 18
every 18
day 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
helping 18
me 18
recover 18
like 18
some 18
guy 18
whos 18
spent 18
his 18
life 18
in 18
this 18
rabbit 18
warrens 18
going 18
to 18
fix 18
me 18
up 18
complete 18
idiot 18
at 18
least 18
twenty 18
times 18
a 18
session 18
he 18
reminds 18
me 18
that 18
im 18
totally 18
safe 18
i 18
manage 18
a 18
smile 18
its 18
a 18
truly 18
stupid 18
thing 18
to 18
say 18
especially 18
to 18
a 18
victor 18
as 18
if 18
such 18
a 18
state 18
of 18
being 18
ever 18
existed 18
anywhere 18
for 18
anyone 18
how 18
about 18
you 18
mockingjay 18
you 18
feel 18
totally 18
safe 18
oh 18
yeah 18
right 18
up 18
until 18
i 18
got 18
shot 18
i 18
say 18
please 18
that 18
bullet 18
never 18
even 18
touched 18
you 18
cinna 18
saw 18
to 18
that 18
she 18
says 18
i 18
think 18
of 18
the 18
layers 18
of 18
protective 18
armor 18
in 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
outfit 18
but 18
the 18
pain 18
came 18
from 18
somewhere 18
broken 18
ribs 18
not 18
even 18
bruised 18
pretty 18
good 18
the 18
impact 18
ruptured 18
your 18
spleen 18
they 18
couldnt 18
repair 18
it 18
she 18
gives 18
a 18
dismissive 18
wave 18
of 18
her 18
hand 18
dont 18
worry 18
you 18
dont 18
need 18
one 18
and 18
if 18
you 18
did 18
theyd 18
find 18
you 18
one 18
wouldnt 18
they 18
its 18
everybodys 18
job 18
to 18
keep 18
you 18
alive 18
is 18
that 18
why 18
you 18
hate 18
me 18
i 18
ask 18
partly 18
she 18
admits 18
jealousy 18
is 18
certainly 18
involved 18
i 18
also 18
think 18
youre 18
a 18
little 18
hard 18
to 18
swallow 18
with 18
your 18
tacky 18
romantic 18
drama 18
and 18
your 18
defenderofthehelpless 18
act 18
only 18
it 18
isnt 18
an 18
act 18
which 18
makes 18
you 18
more 18
unbearable 18
please 18
feel 18
free 18
to 18
take 18
this 18
personally 18
you 18
should 18
have 18
been 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
no 18
one 18
wouldve 18
had 18
to 18
feed 18
you 18
lines 18
i 18
say 18
true 18
but 18
no 18
one 18
likes 18
me 18
she 18
tells 18
me 18
they 18
trusted 18
you 18
though 18
to 18
get 18
me 18
out 18
i 18
remind 18
her 18
and 18
theyre 18
afraid 18
of 18
you 18
here 18
maybe 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
youre 18
the 18
one 18
theyre 18
scared 18
of 18
now 18
gale 18
appears 18
in 18
the 18
doorway 18
and 18
johanna 18
neatly 18
unhooks 18
herself 18
and 18
reattaches 18
me 18
to 18
the 18
morphling 18
drip 18
your 18
cousins 18
not 18
afraid 18
of 18
me 18
she 18
says 18
confidentially 18
she 18
scoots 18
off 18
my 18
bed 18
and 18
crosses 18
to 18
the 18
door 18
nudging 18
gales 18
leg 18
with 18
her 18
hip 18
as 18
she 18
passes 18
him 18
are 18
you 18
gorgeous 18
we 18
can 18
hear 18
her 18
laughter 18
as 18
she 18
disappears 18
down 18
the 18
hall 18
i 18
raise 18
my 18
eyebrows 18
at 18
him 18
as 18
he 18
takes 18
my 18
hand 18
terrified 18
he 18
mouths 18
i 18
laugh 18
but 18
it 18
turns 18
into 18
a 18
wince 18
easy 18
he 18
strokes 18
my 18
face 18
as 18
the 18
pain 18
ebbs 18
youve 18
got 18
to 18
stop 18
running 18
straight 18
into 18
trouble 18
i 18
know 18
but 18
someone 18
blew 18
up 18
a 18
mountain 18
i 18
answer 18
instead 18
of 18
pulling 18
back 18
he 18
leans 18
in 18
closer 18
searching 18
my 18
face 18
you 18
think 18
im 18
heartless 18
i 18
know 18
youre 18
not 18
but 18
i 18
wont 18
tell 18
you 18
its 18
okay 18
i 18
say 18
now 18
he 18
draws 18
back 18
almost 18
impatiently 18
katniss 18
what 18
difference 18
is 18
there 18
really 18
between 18
crushing 18
our 18
enemy 18
in 18
a 18
mine 18
or 18
blowing 18
them 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
sky 18
with 18
one 18
of 18
beetees 18
arrows 18
the 18
result 18
is 18
the 18
same 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
we 18
were 18
under 18
attack 18
in 18
eight 18
for 18
one 18
thing 18
the 18
hospital 18
was 18
under 18
attack 18
i 18
say 18
yes 18
and 18
those 18
hoverplanes 18
came 18
from 18
district 18
two 18
he 18
says 18
so 18
by 18
taking 18
them 18
out 18
we 18
prevented 18
further 18
attacks 18
but 18
that 18
kind 18
of 18
thinkingyou 18
could 18
turn 18
it 18
into 18
an 18
argument 18
for 18
killing 18
anyone 18
at 18
any 18
time 18
you 18
could 18
justify 18
sending 18
kids 18
into 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
to 18
prevent 18
the 18
districts 18
from 18
getting 18
out 18
of 18
line 18
i 18
say 18
i 18
dont 18
buy 18
that 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
i 18
do 18
i 18
reply 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
those 18
trips 18
to 18
the 18
arena 18
fine 18
we 18
know 18
how 18
to 18
disagree 18
he 18
says 18
we 18
always 18
have 18
maybe 18
its 18
good 18
between 18
you 18
and 18
me 18
weve 18
got 18
district 18
two 18
now 18
really 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
a 18
feeling 18
of 18
triumph 18
flares 18
up 18
inside 18
me 18
then 18
i 18
think 18
about 18
the 18
people 18
on 18
the 18
square 18
was 18
there 18
fighting 18
after 18
i 18
was 18
shot 18
not 18
much 18
the 18
workers 18
from 18
the 18
nut 18
turned 18
on 18
the 18
capitol 18
soldiers 18
the 18
rebels 18
just 18
sat 18
by 18
and 18
watched 18
he 18
says 18
actually 18
the 18
whole 18
country 18
just 18
sat 18
by 18
and 18
watched 18
well 18
thats 18
what 18
they 18
do 18
best 18
i 18
say 18
youd 18
think 18
that 18
losing 18
a 18
major 18
organ 18
would 18
entitle 18
you 18
to 18
lie 18
around 18
a 18
few 18
weeks 18
but 18
for 18
some 18
reason 18
my 18
doctors 18
want 18
me 18
up 18
and 18
moving 18
almost 18
immediately 18
even 18
with 18
the 18
morphling 18
the 18
internal 18
pains 18
severe 18
the 18
first 18
few 18
days 18
but 18
then 18
it 18
slacks 18
off 18
considerably 18
the 18
soreness 18
from 18
the 18
bruised 18
ribs 18
however 18
promises 18
to 18
hang 18
on 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
i 18
begin 18
to 18

likes 18
rumors 18
of 18
my 18
death 18
have 18
been 18

rampant 18
so 18

on 18
their 18
successful 18
battle 18
for 18
unity 18
then 18
i 18
warn 18
the 18
capitol 18
to 18
expect 18
us 18
soon 18
as 18
part 18
of 18
my 18
rehabilitation 18
i 18
take 18
short 18
walks 18
aboveground 18
each 18
day 18
one 18
afternoon 18
plutarch 18
joins 18
me 18
and 18
gives 18
me 18
an 18
update 18
on 18
our 18
current 18
situation 18
now 18
that 18
district 18
has 18
allied 18
with 18
us 18
the 18
rebels 18
are 18
taking 18
a 18
breather 18
from 18
the 18
war 18
to 18
regroup 18
fortifying 18
supply 18
lines 18
seeing 18
to 18
the 18
wounded 18
reorganizing 18
their 18
troops 18
the 18
capitol 18
like 18
during 18
the 18
dark 18
days 18
finds 18
itself 18
completely 18
cut 18
off 18
from 18
outside 18
help 18
as 18
it 18
holds 18
the 18
threat 18
of 18
nuclear 18
attack 18
over 18
its 18
enemies 18
unlike 18
the 18
capitol 18
is 18
not 18
in 18
a 18
position 18
to 18
reinvent 18
itself 18
and 18
become 18
selfsufficient 18
oh 18
the 18
city 18
might 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
scrape 18
along 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
says 18
plutarch 18
certainly 18
there 18
are 18
emergency 18
supplies 18
stockpiled 18
but 18
the 18
significant 18
difference 18
between 18
thirteen 18
and 18
the 18
capitol 18
are 18
the 18
expectations 18
of 18
the 18
populace 18
thirteen 18
was 18
used 18
to 18
hardship 18
whereas 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
all 18
theyve 18
known 18
is 18
panem 18
et 18
circenses 18
whats 18
that 18
i 18
recognize 18
panem 18
of 18
course 18
but 18
the 18
rest 18
is 18
nonsense 18
its 18
a 18
saying 18
from 18
thousands 18
of 18
years 18
ago 18
written 18
in 18
a 18
language 18
called 18
latin 18
about 18
a 18
place 18
called 18
rome 18
he 18
explains 18
panem 18
et 18
circenses 18
translates 18
into 18
bread 18
and 18
circuses 18
the 18
writer 18
was 18
saying 18
that 18
in 18
return 18
for 18
full 18
bellies 18
and 18
entertainment 18
his 18
people 18
had 18
given 18
up 18
their 18
political 18
responsibilities 18
and 18
therefore 18
their 18
power 18
i 18
think 18
about 18
the 18
capitol 18
the 18
excess 18
of 18
food 18
and 18
the 18
ultimate 18
entertainment 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
so 18
thats 18
what 18
the 18
districts 18
are 18
for 18
to 18
provide 18
the 18
bread 18
and 18
circuses 18
yes 18
and 18
as 18
long 18
as 18
that 18
kept 18
rolling 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
could 18
control 18
its 18
little 18
empire 18
right 18
now 18
it 18
can 18
provide 18
neither 18
at 18
least 18
at 18
the 18
standard 18
the 18
people 18
are 18
accustomed 18
to 18
says 18
plutarch 18
we 18
have 18
the 18
food 18
and 18
im 18
about 18
to 18
orchestrate 18
an 18
entertainment 18
propo 18
thats 18
sure 18
to 18
be 18
popular 18
after 18
all 18
everybody 18
loves 18
a 18
wedding 18
i 18
freeze 18
in 18
my 18
tracks 18

at 18
the 18
idea 18
of 18

very 18
little 18
about 18
it 18
different 18
techniques 18
are 18
being 18
tried 18
there 18
will 18
never 18
truly 18
be 18
a 18
way 18
to 18
cure 18
him 18
and 18
now 18
they 18
want 18
me 18
to 18

pretend 18
to 18
be 18
happy 18
for 18

one 18
of 18
the 18
few 18
things 18

few 18
days 18
bring 18
a 18
flurry 18
of 18
activity 18
as 18
the 18
event 18
is 18
planned 18
the 18
differences 18
between 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
are 18
thrown 18
into 18
sharp 18
relief 18
by 18
the 18
event 18
when 18
coin 18
says 18
wedding 18
she 18
means 18
two 18
people 18
signing 18
a 18
piece 18
of 18
paper 18
and 18
being 18
assigned 18
a 18
new 18
compartment 18
plutarch 18
means 18
hundreds 18
of 18
people 18
dressed 18
in 18
finery 18
at 18
a 18
threeday 18
celebration 18
its 18
amusing 18
to 18
watch 18
them 18
haggle 18
over 18
the 18
details 18
plutarch 18
has 18
to 18
fight 18
for 18
every 18
guest 18
every 18
musical 18
note 18
after 18
coin 18
vetoes 18
a 18
dinner 18
entertainment 18
and 18
alcohol 18
plutarch 18
yells 18
whats 18
the 18
point 18
of 18
the 18
propo 18
if 18
no 18
ones 18
having 18
any 18
fun 18
its 18
hard 18
to 18
put 18
a 18
gamemaker 18
on 18
a 18
budget 18
but 18
even 18
a 18
quiet 18
celebration 18
causes 18
a 18
stir 18
in 18
where 18
they 18
seem 18
to 18
have 18
no 18
holidays 18
at 18
all 18
when 18
its 18
announced 18
that 18
children 18
are 18
wanted 18
to 18
sing 18
district 18
s 18
wedding 18
song 18
practically 18
every 18
kid 18
shows 18
up 18
theres 18
no 18
shortage 18
of 18
volunteers 18
to 18
help 18
make 18
decorations 18
in 18
the 18
dining 18
hall 18
people 18
chat 18
excitedly 18
about 18
the 18
event 18
maybe 18
its 18
more 18
than 18
the 18
festivities 18
maybe 18
its 18
that 18
we 18
are 18
all 18
so 18
starved 18
for 18
something 18
good 18
to 18
happen 18
that 18
we 18
want 18
to 18
be 18
part 18
of 18
it 18
it 18
would 18
explain 18
whywhen 18
plutarch 18
has 18
a 18
fit 18
over 18
what 18
the 18
bride 18
will 18
weari 18
volunteer 18
to 18
take 18
annie 18
back 18
to 18
my 18
house 18
in 18
where 18
cinna 18
left 18
a 18
variety 18
of 18
evening 18
clothes 18
in 18
a 18
big 18
storage 18
closet 18
downstairs 18
all 18
of 18
the 18
wedding 18
gowns 18
he 18
designed 18
for 18
me 18
went 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
but 18
there 18
are 18
some 18
dresses 18
i 18
wore 18
on 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
im 18
a 18
little 18
leery 18
about 18
being 18
with 18
annie 18
since 18
all 18
i 18
really 18
know 18
about 18
her 18
is 18
that 18
finnick 18
loves 18
her 18
and 18
everybody 18
thinks 18
shes 18
mad 18
on 18
the 18
hovercraft 18
ride 18
i 18
decide 18
shes 18
less 18
mad 18
than 18
unstable 18
she 18
laughs 18
at 18
odd 18
places 18
in 18
the 18
conversation 18
or 18
drops 18
out 18
of 18
it 18
distractedly 18
those 18
green 18
eyes 18
fixate 18
on 18
a 18
point 18
with 18
such 18
intensity 18
that 18
you 18
find 18
yourself 18
trying 18
to 18
make 18
out 18
what 18
she 18
sees 18
in 18
the 18
empty 18
air 18
sometimes 18
for 18
no 18
reason 18
she 18
presses 18
both 18
her 18
hands 18
over 18
her 18
ears 18
as 18
if 18
to 18
block 18
out 18
a 18
painful 18
sound 18
all 18
right 18
shes 18
strange 18
but 18
if 18
finnick 18
loves 18
her 18
thats 18
good 18
enough 18
for 18
me 18
i 18
got 18
permission 18
for 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
to 18
come 18
along 18
so 18
im 18
relieved 18
of 18
having 18
to 18
make 18
any 18
fashion 18
decisions 18
when 18
i 18
open 18
the 18
closet 18
we 18
all 18
fall 18
silent 18
because 18
cinnas 18
presence 18
is 18
so 18
strong 18
in 18
the 18
flow 18
of 18
the 18
fabrics 18
then 18
octavia 18
drops 18
to 18
her 18
knees 18
rubs 18
the 18
hem 18
of 18
a 18
skirt 18
against 18
her 18
cheek 18
and 18
bursts 18
into 18
tears 18
its 18
been 18
so 18
long 18
she 18
gasps 18
since 18
ive 18
seen 18
anything 18
pretty 18
despite 18
reservations 18
on 18
coins 18
side 18
that 18
its 18
too 18
extravagant 18
and 18
on 18
plutarchs 18
side 18
that 18
its 18
too 18
drab 18
the 18
wedding 18
is 18
a 18
smash 18
hit 18
the 18
three 18
hundred 18
lucky 18
guests 18
culled 18
from 18
and 18
the 18
many 18
refugees 18
wear 18
their 18
everyday 18
clothes 18
the 18
decorations 18
are 18
made 18
from 18
autumn 18
foliage 18
the 18
music 18
is 18
provided 18
by 18
a 18
choir 18
of 18
children 18
accompanied 18
by 18
the 18
lone 18
fiddler 18
who 18
made 18
it 18
out 18
of 18
with 18
his 18
instrument 18
so 18
its 18
simple 18
frugal 18
by 18
the 18
capitols 18
standards 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
because 18
nothing 18
can 18
compete 18
with 18
the 18
beauty 18
of 18
the 18
couple 18
it 18
isnt 18
about 18
their 18
borrowed 18
fineryannie 18
wears 18
a 18
green 18
silk 18
dress 18
i 18
wore 18
in 18
finnick 18
one 18
of 18
peetas 18
suits 18
that 18
they 18
alteredalthough 18
the 18
clothes 18
are 18
striking 18
who 18
can 18
look 18
past 18
the 18
radiant 18
faces 18
of 18
two 18
people 18
for 18
whom 18
this 18
day 18
was 18
once 18
a 18
virtual 18
impossibility 18
dalton 18
the 18
cattle 18
guy 18
from 18
conducts 18
the 18
ceremony 18
since 18
its 18
similar 18
to 18
the 18
one 18
used 18
in 18
his 18
district 18
but 18
there 18
are 18
unique 18
touches 18
of 18
district 18
a 18
net 18
woven 18
from 18
long 18
grass 18
that 18
covers 18
the 18
couple 18
during 18
their 18
vows 18
the 18
touching 18
of 18
each 18
others 18
lips 18
with 18
salt 18
water 18
and 18
the 18
ancient 18
wedding 18
song 18
which 18
likens 18
marriage 18
to 18
a 18
sea 18
voyage 18
no 18
i 18
dont 18
have 18
to 18
pretend 18
to 18
be 18
happy 18
for 18
them 18
after 18
the 18
kiss 18
that 18
seals 18
the 18
union 18
the 18
cheers 18
and 18
a 18
toast 18
with 18
apple 18
cider 18
the 18
fiddler 18
strikes 18
up 18
a 18
tune 18
that 18
turns 18
every 18
head 18
from 18
we 18
may 18
have 18
been 18
the 18
smallest 18
poorest 18
district 18
in 18
panem 18
but 18
we 18
know 18
how 18

has 18
been 18
officially 18
scheduled 18
at 18
this 18
point 18
but 18
plutarch 18
whos 18
calling 18
the 18
propo 18
from 18
the 18
control 18
room 18

have 18
his 18
fingers 18
crossed 18
sure 18
enough 18
greasy 18
sae 18
grabs 18
gale 18
by 18
the 18
hand 18
and 18
pulls 18
him 18
into 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
floor 18
and 18
faces 18
off 18
with 18
him 18
people 18
pour 18
in 18
to 18
join 18
them 18
forming 18
two 18
long 18
lines 18
and 18
the 18
dancing 18
begins 18
im 18
standing 18
off 18
to 18
the 18
side 18
clapping 18
to 18
the 18
rhythm 18
when 18
a 18
bony 18
hand 18
pinches 18
me 18
above 18
the 18
elbow 18
johanna 18
scowls 18
at 18
me 18
are 18
you 18
going 18
to 18
miss 18
the 18
chance 18
to 18
let 18
snow 18
see 18
you 18
dancing 18
shes 18
right 18
what 18
could 18
spell 18
victory 18
louder 18
than 18
a 18
happy 18
mockingjay 18
twirling 18
around 18
to 18
music 18
i 18
find 18
prim 18
in 18
the 18
crowd 18
since 18
winter 18
evenings 18
gave 18
us 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
time 18
to 18
practice 18
were 18
actually 18
pretty 18
good 18
partners 18
i 18
brush 18
off 18
her 18
concerns 18
about 18
my 18
ribs 18
and 18
we 18
take 18
our 18
places 18
in 18
the 18
line 18
it 18
hurts 18
but 18
the 18
satisfaction 18
of 18
having 18
snow 18
watch 18
me 18
dance 18
with 18
my 18
little 18
sister 18
reduces 18
other 18
feelings 18
to 18
dust 18
dancing 18
transforms 18
us 18
we 18
teach 18
the 18
steps 18
to 18
the 18
district 18
guests 18
insist 18
on 18
a 18
special 18
number 18
for 18
the 18
bride 18
and 18
groom 18
join 18
hands 18
and 18
make 18
a 18
giant 18
spinning 18
circle 18
where 18
people 18
show 18
off 18
their 18
footwork 18
nothing 18
silly 18
joyful 18
or 18
fun 18
has 18
happened 18
in 18
so 18
long 18
this 18
could 18
go 18
on 18
all 18
night 18
if 18
not 18
for 18
the 18
last 18
event 18
planned 18
in 18
plutarchs 18
propo 18
one 18
i 18
hadnt 18
heard 18
about 18
but 18
then 18
it 18
was 18
meant 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
surprise 18
four 18
people 18
wheel 18
out 18
a 18
huge 18
wedding 18
cake 18
from 18
a 18
side 18
room 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
guests 18
back 18
up 18
making 18
way 18
for 18
this 18
rarity 18
this 18
dazzling 18
creation 18
with 18
bluegreen 18
whitetipped 18
icing 18
waves 18
swimming 18
with 18
fish 18
and 18
sailboats 18
seals 18
and 18
sea 18
flowers 18
but 18
i 18
push 18
my 18
way 18
through 18
the 18
crowd 18
to 18
confirm 18
what 18
i 18
knew 18
at 18
first 18
sight 18
as 18
surely 18
as 18
the 18
embroidery 18
stitches 18
in 18
annies 18
gown 18
were 18
done 18
by 18
cinnas 18
hand 18
the 18
frosted 18
flowers 18
on 18
the 18
cake 18
were 18
done 18
by 18
peetas 18
this 18
may 18
seem 18
like 18
a 18
small 18
thing 18
but 18
it 18
speaks 18
volumes 18
haymitch 18
has 18
been 18
keeping 18
a 18
great 18
deal 18
from 18
me 18
the 18
boy 18
i 18
last 18
saw 18
screaming 18
his 18
head 18
off 18
trying 18
to 18
tear 18
free 18
of 18
his 18
restraints 18
could 18
never 18
have 18
made 18
this 18
never 18
have 18
had 18
the 18
focus 18
kept 18
his 18
hands 18
steady 18
designed 18
something 18
so 18
perfect 18
for 18
finnick 18
and 18
annie 18
as 18
if 18
anticipating 18
my 18
reaction 18
haymitch 18
is 18
at 18
my 18
side 18
lets 18
you 18
and 18
me 18
have 18
a 18
talk 18
he 18
says 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
hall 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
cameras 18
i 18

his 18
head 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
none 18
of 18
us 18
knows 18
sometimes 18
hes 18
almost 18
rational 18
and 18
then 18
for 18
no 18
reason 18
he 18
goes 18
off 18
again 18
doing 18
the 18
cake 18
was 18
a 18
kind 18
of 18
therapy 18

been 18
working 18
on 18
it 18
for 18
days 18
watching 18
himhe 18
seemed 18
almost 18
like 18
before 18
so 18
hes 18
got 18
the 18
run 18
of 18
the 18
place 18
i 18
ask 18
the 18
idea 18
makes 18
me 18
nervous 18
on 18
about 18
five 18
different 18
levels 18
oh 18

frosted 18
under 18
heavy 18
guard 18

still 18
under 18

and 18
key 18
but 18
ive 18
talked 18
to 18
him 18
haymitch 18
says 18
facetoface 18
i 18
ask 18
and 18
he 18
didnt 18
go 18
nuts 18
no 18
pretty 18
angry 18
with 18
me 18
but 18
for 18
all 18
the 18
right 18
reasons 18
not 18
telling 18
him 18
about 18
the 18
rebel 18
plot 18
and 18
whatnot 18
haymitch 18
pauses 18
a 18
moment 18
as 18
if 18
deciding 18
something 18
he 18
says 18
hed 18
like 18
to 18
see 18
you 18
im 18
on 18
a 18
frosting 18
sailboat 18
tossed 18
around 18
by 18
bluegreen 18
waves 18
the 18
deck 18
shifting 18
beneath 18
my 18
feet 18
my 18
palms 18
press 18
into 18
the 18
wall 18
to 18
steady 18
myself 18
this 18
wasnt 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
plan 18
i 18
wrote 18
peeta 18
off 18
in 18
then 18
i 18
was 18
to 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
kill 18
snow 18
and 18
get 18
taken 18
out 18
myself 18
the 18
gunshot 18
was 18
only 18
a 18
temporary 18
setback 18
never 18
was 18
i 18
supposed 18
to 18
hear 18
the 18
words 18
he 18
says 18
hed 18
like 18
to 18
see 18
you 18
but 18
now 18
that 18
i 18
have 18
theres 18
no 18
way 18
to 18
refuse 18
at 18
midnight 18
im 18
standing 18
outside 18
the 18
door 18
to 18
his 18
cell 18
hospital 18
room 18
we 18
had 18
to 18
wait 18
for 18
plutarch 18
to 18
finish 18
getting 18
his 18
wedding 18
footage 18
which 18
despite 18
the 18
lack 18
of 18
what 18
he 18
calls 18
razzledazzle 18
hes 18
pleased 18
with 18
the 18
best 18
thing 18
about 18
the 18
capitol 18
basically 18
ignoring 18
twelve 18
all 18
these 18
years 18
is 18
that 18
you 18
people 18
still 18
have 18
a 18
little 18
spontaneity 18
the 18
audience 18
eats 18
that 18
up 18
like 18
when 18
peeta 18
announced 18
he 18
was 18
in 18
love 18
with 18
you 18
or 18
you 18
did 18
the 18
trick 18
with 18
the 18
berries 18
makes 18
for 18
good 18
television 18
i 18
wish 18
i 18
could 18
meet 18
with 18
peeta 18
privately 18
but 18
the 18
audience 18
of 18
doctors 18
has 18
assembled 18
behind 18
the 18
oneway 18
glass 18
clipboards 18
ready 18
pens 18
poised 18
when 18
haymitch 18
gives 18
me 18
the 18
okay 18
in 18
my 18
earpiece 18
i 18
slowly 18
open 18
the 18
door 18
those 18
blue 18
eyes 18
lock 18
on 18
me 18
instantly 18
hes 18
got 18
three 18
restraints 18
on 18
each 18
arm 18
and 18
a 18
tube 18
that 18
can 18
dispense 18
a 18
knockout 18
drug 18
just 18
in 18
case 18
he 18
loses 18
control 18
he 18
doesnt 18
fight 18
to 18
free 18
himself 18
though 18
only 18
observes 18
me 18
with 18
the 18
wary 18
look 18
of 18
someone 18
who 18
still 18
hasnt 18
ruled 18
out 18
that 18
hes 18
in 18
the 18
presence 18
of 18
a 18
mutt 18
i 18
walk 18
over 18
until 18
im 18
standing 18
about 18
a 18
yard 18
from 18
the 18
bed 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
my 18
hands 18
so 18
i 18
cross 18
my 18
arms 18
protectively 18
over 18
my 18
ribs 18
before 18
i 18
speak 18
hey 18
hey 18
he 18
responds 18
its 18
like 18
his 18
voice 18
almost 18
his 18
voice 18
except 18
theres 18
something 18
new 18
in 18
it 18
an 18
edge 18
of 18
suspicion 18
and 18
reproach 18
haymitch 18
said 18
you 18
wanted 18
to 18
talk 18
to 18
me 18
i 18
say 18
look 18
at 18
you 18
for 18
starters 18
its 18
like 18
hes 18
waiting 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
transform 18
into 18
a 18
hybrid 18
drooling 18
wolf 18
right 18
before 18
his 18
eyes 18
he 18
stares 18
so 18
long 18
i 18
find 18
myself 18
casting 18
furtive 18
glances 18
at 18
the 18
oneway 18
glass 18
hoping 18
for 18
some 18
direction 18
from 18
haymitch 18
but 18
my 18
earpiece 18
stays 18
silent 18
youre 18
not 18
very 18
big 18

or 18

been 18
through 18
hell 18
and 18
back 18
and 18
yet 18
somehow 18
the 18
observation 18
rubs 18
me 18
the 18
wrong 18
way 18
well 18
youve 18
looked 18
better 18
haymitchs 18
advice 18
to 18
back 18

muffled 18
by 18
peetas 18
laughter 18
and 18
not 18
even 18
remotely 18
nice 18
to 18

when 18
his 18
voice 18
stops 18

katniss 18
i 18

about 18
the 18

one 18
moment 18
of 18
real 18
connection 18
before 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
they 18
showed 18
you 18
the 18
tape 18
of 18
me 18
talking 18
about 18
it 18
i 18

tape 18
of 18

it 18
against 18

the 18
pain 18
in 18
my 18
chest 18
wraps 18
around 18
my 18
ribs 18
like 18
a 18
vise 18
the 18
dancing 18
was 18
a 18
mistake 18
so 18
what 18

you 18
in 18

softly 18
digging 18
in 18
our 18
trash 18
bins 18
burning 18
the 18
bread 18
my 18
mother 18

your 18
eye 18
you 18
looked 18
away 18
and 18
thenfor 18
some 18
reason 18
i 18
think 18

picked 18
a 18
dandelion 18
i 18

remember 18
i 18
have 18
never 18
spoken 18
about 18

moment 18
aloud 18
i 18
must 18
have 18
loved 18
you 18
a 18
lot 18
you 18
did 18
my 18
voice 18

and 18
i 18
pretend 18
to 18

you 18
love 18
me 18
he 18
asks 18
i 18

my 18
eyes 18
on 18
the 18
tiled 18
floor 18
everyone 18
says 18
i 18
did 18
everyone 18
says 18

why 18
snow 18

you 18
tortured 18
to 18
break 18
me 18
thats 18
not 18

answer 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
think 18
when 18
they 18
show 18
me 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
tapes 18
in 18
that 18
first 18
arena 18
it 18
looked 18
like 18
you 18
tried 18
to 18
kill 18
me 18
with 18
those 18
tracker 18
jackers 18
i 18
was 18

a 18
lot 18
of 18
kissing 18

seem 18
very 18
genuine 18
on 18
your 18
part 18
did 18
you 18
like 18
kissing 18
me 18

my 18
angers 18
returning 18
i 18
dont 18
care 18
about 18
his 18
recovery 18
this 18

the 18
business 18
of 18
the 18
people 18
behind 18

okay 18
with 18
both 18
of 18
us 18
you 18
kissing 18
the 18
other 18

behind 18
in 18
a 18
laundry 18
room 18

a 18
long 18
time 18
before 18

get 18
to 18
the 18
bottom 18
of 18

shown 18
up 18
for 18

with 18
other 18
approved 18
duties 18
we 18
feel 18
confident 18
he 18
can 18
manage 18
himself 18
in 18
the 18
field 18
says 18
coin 18
how 18
many 18
training 18
sessions 18
do 18
you 18
estimate 18
youve 18
attended 18
none 18
thats 18
how 18
many 18
well 18
sometimes 18
i 18
was 18
hunting 18
andi 18
trained 18
with 18
beetee 18
down 18
in 18
special 18
weaponry 18

the 18
same 18
katniss 18
says 18
boggs 18
we 18
all 18
know 18
youre 18
smart 18
and 18
brave 18
and 18
a 18
good 18
shot 18
but 18
we 18
need 18
soldiers 18
in 18
the 18
field 18
you 18
dont 18
know 18
the 18
first 18
thing 18
about 18
executing 18
orders 18
and 18
youre 18
not 18
exactly 18
at 18
your 18
physical 18
peak 18
that 18
didnt 18
bother 18
you 18
when 18
i 18
was 18
in 18
eight 18
or 18
two 18
for 18
that 18
matter 18
i 18
counter 18
you 18
werent 18
originally 18
authorized 18
for 18
combat 18
in 18
either 18
case 18
says 18
plutarch 18
shooting 18
me 18
a 18
look 18
that 18
signals 18
im 18
about 18
to 18
reveal 18
too 18
much 18
no 18
the 18
bomber 18
battle 18
in 18
and 18
my 18
intervention 18
in 18
were 18
spontaneous 18
rash 18
and 18
definitely 18
unauthorized 18
and 18
both 18
resulted 18
in 18
your 18
injury 18
boggs 18
reminds 18
me 18
suddenly 18
i 18
see 18
myself 18
through 18
his 18
eyes 18
a 18
smallish 18
seventeenyearold 18
girl 18
who 18
cant 18
quite 18
catch 18
her 18
breath 18
since 18
her 18
ribs 18
havent 18
fully 18
healed 18
disheveled 18
undisciplined 18
recuperating 18
not 18
a 18
soldier 18
but 18
someone 18
who 18
needs 18
to 18
be 18
looked 18
after 18
but 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
go 18
i 18
say 18
why 18
asks 18
coin 18
i 18
cant 18
very 18
well 18
say 18
its 18
so 18
i 18
can 18
carry 18
out 18
my 18
own 18
personal 18
vendetta 18
against 18
snow 18
or 18
that 18
the 18
idea 18
of 18
remaining 18
here 18
in 18
with 18
the 18
latest 18
version 18
of 18
peeta 18
while 18
gale 18
goes 18
off 18
to 18
fight 18
is 18
unbearable 18
but 18
i 18
have 18
no 18
shortage 18
of 18
reasons 18
to 18
want 18
to 18
fight 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
because 18
of 18
twelve 18
because 18
they 18
destroyed 18
my 18
district 18
the 18
president 18
thinks 18
about 18
this 18
a 18
moment 18
considers 18
me 18
well 18
you 18
have 18
three 18
weeks 18
its 18
not 18
long 18
but 18
you 18
can 18
begin 18
training 18
if 18
the 18
assignment 18
board 18
deems 18
you 18
fit 18
possibly 18
your 18
case 18
will 18
be 18
reviewed 18
thats 18
it 18
thats 18
the 18
most 18
i 18
can 18
hope 18
for 18
i 18
guess 18
its 18
my 18
own 18
fault 18
i 18
did 18
blow 18
off 18
my 18
schedule 18
every 18
single 18
day 18
unless 18
something 18
suited 18
me 18
it 18
didnt 18
seem 18
like 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
priority 18
jogging 18
around 18
a 18
field 18
with 18
a 18
gun 18
with 18
so 18
many 18
other 18
things 18
going 18
on 18
and 18
now 18
im 18
paying 18
for 18
my 18
negligence 18
back 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
i 18
find 18
johanna 18
in 18
the 18
same 18
circumstance 18
and 18
spitting 18
mad 18
i 18
tell 18
her 18
about 18
what 18
coin 18
said 18
maybe 18
you 18
can 18
train 18
too 18
fine 18
ill 18
train 18
but 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
the 18
stinking 18
capitol 18
if 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
kill 18
a 18
crew 18
and 18
fly 18
there 18
myself 18
says 18
johanna 18
probably 18
best 18
not 18
to 18
bring 18
that 18
up 18
in 18
training 18
i 18
say 18
but 18
its 18
nice 18
to 18
know 18
ill 18
have 18
a 18
ride 18
johanna 18
grins 18
and 18
i 18
feel 18
a 18
slight 18
but 18
significant 18
shift 18
in 18
our 18
relationship 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
that 18
were 18
actually 18
friends 18
but 18
possibly 18
the 18
word 18
allies 18
would 18
be 18
accurate 18
thats 18
good 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
need 18
an 18
ally 18
the 18
next 18
morning 18
when 18
we 18
report 18
for 18
training 18
at 18
reality 18
slaps 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
face 18
weve 18
been 18
funneled 18
into 18
a 18
class 18
of 18
relative 18
beginners 18
fourteen 18
or 18
fifteenyearolds 18
which 18
seems 18
a 18
little 18
insulting 18
until 18
its 18
obvious 18
that 18
theyre 18
in 18
far 18
better 18
condition 18
than 18
we 18
are 18
gale 18
and 18
the 18
other 18
people 18
already 18
chosen 18
to 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
are 18
in 18
a 18
different 18
accelerated 18
phase 18
of 18
training 18
after 18
we 18
stretchwhich 18
hurts 18

johannas 18
fighting 18
off 18

snarls 18
at 18
me 18
shes 18
a 18
sick 18
greenish 18
color 18
shaking 18
like 18
a 18
leaf 18
i 18
get 18
dressed 18
we 18
must 18
be 18
victors 18
to 18
make 18
it 18
through 18
the 18
morning 18
i 18
think 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
lose 18
johanna 18
when 18
we 18
realize 18
its 18
pouring 18
outside 18
her 18
face 18
turns 18
ashen 18
and 18
she 18
seems 18
to 18
have 18
ceased 18
breathing 18
its 18
just 18
water 18
it 18
wont 18
kill 18
us 18
i 18
say 18
she 18
clenches 18
her 18
jaw 18
and 18
stomps 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
mud 18
rain 18
drenches 18
us 18
as 18
we 18
work 18
our 18
bodies 18
and 18
then 18
slog 18
around 18
the 18
running 18
course 18
i 18
bail 18
after 18
a 18
mile 18
again 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
resist 18
the 18
temptation 18
to 18
take 18
off 18
my 18
shirt 18
so 18
the 18
cold 18
water 18
can 18
sizzle 18
off 18
my 18
ribs 18
i 18
force 18
down 18
my 18
field 18
lunch 18
of 18
soggy 18
fish 18
and 18
beet 18
stew 18
johanna 18
gets 18
halfway 18
through 18
her 18
bowl 18
before 18
it 18
comes 18
back 18
up 18
in 18
the 18
afternoon 18
we 18
learn 18
to 18
assemble 18
our 18
guns 18
i 18
manage 18
it 18
but 18
johanna 18
cant 18
hold 18
her 18
hands 18
steady 18
enough 18
to 18
fit 18
the 18
parts 18
together 18
when 18
yorks 18
back 18
is 18
turned 18
i 18
help 18
her 18
out 18
even 18
though 18
the 18
rain 18
continues 18
the 18
afternoons 18
an 18
improvement 18
because 18

on 18
the 18
shooting 18
range 18
at 18
last 18
something 18
im 18
good 18
at 18
it 18
takes 18
some 18
adjusting 18
from 18
a 18
bow 18
to 18
a 18
gun 18
but 18
by 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
day 18
ive 18
got 18
the 18
best 18
score 18
in 18
my 18
class 18
were 18
just 18
inside 18
the 18
hospital 18
doors 18
when 18
johanna 18
declares 18
this 18
has 18
to 18
stop 18
us 18
living 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
everyone 18
views 18
us 18
as 18
patients 18
its 18
not 18
a 18
problem 18
for 18
me 18
i 18
can 18
move 18
into 18
our 18
family 18
compartment 18
but 18
johannas 18
never 18
been 18
assigned 18
one 18
when 18
she 18
tries 18
to 18
get 18
discharged 18
from 18
the 18
hospital 18
they 18
wont 18
agree 18
to 18
let 18
her 18
live 18
alone 18
even 18
if 18
she 18
comes 18
in 18
for 18
daily 18
talks 18
with 18
the 18
head 18
doctor 18
i 18
think 18
they 18
may 18
have 18
put 18
two 18
and 18
two 18
together 18
about 18
the 18
morphling 18
and 18
this 18
only 18
adds 18
to 18
their 18
view 18
that 18
shes 18
unstable 18
she 18
wont 18
be 18
alone 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
room 18
with 18
her 18
i 18
announce 18

some 18
dissent 18

haymitch 18

by 18
bedtime 18
we 18

a 18
compartment 18
across 18
from 18

mother 18
who 18
agrees 18

after 18
i 18

of 18
wipes 18
herself 18
down 18
with 18
a 18
damp 18
cloth 18
she 18
makes 18
a 18
cursory 18
inspection 18
of 18
the 18
place 18
when 18
she 18
opens 18
the 18
drawer 18

holds 18
my 18
few 18
possessions 18

your 18
sister 18
she 18
asks 18
me 18
no 18
i 18
answer 18
thats 18
the 18
one 18
thing 18
i 18
think 18
my 18
head 18
doctor 18
might 18
be 18
right 18
about 18
theres 18
no 18
going 18
back 18
so 18
we 18
might 18
as 18
well 18
get 18
on 18
with 18
things 18
she 18
neatly 18
returns 18
my 18
keepsakes 18
to 18
the 18
drawer 18
and 18
climbs 18
into 18
the 18
bed 18
across 18
from 18
me 18
just 18
as 18
the 18
lights 18
go 18
out 18
youre 18
not 18
afraid 18
ill 18
kill 18
you 18
tonight 18
like 18
i 18
couldnt 18
take 18
you 18
i 18
answer 18
then 18
we 18
laugh 18
since 18
both 18
our 18
bodies 18
are 18
so 18
wrecked 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
a 18
miracle 18
if 18
we 18
can 18
get 18
up 18
the 18
next 18
day 18
but 18
we 18
do 18
each 18
morning 18
we 18
do 18
and 18
by 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
week 18
my 18
ribs 18
feel 18
almost 18
like 18
new 18
and 18
johanna 18
can 18
assemble 18
her 18
rifle 18
without 18
help 18
soldier 18
york 18
gives 18
the 18
pair 18
of 18
us 18
an 18
approving 18
nod 18
as 18
we 18
knock 18

the 18
day 18
fine 18
job 18

we 18
move 18
out 18
of 18
hearing 18
johanna 18
mutters 18
i 18
think 18
winning 18
the 18
games 18
was 18
easier 18
but 18
the 18
look 18
on 18
her 18
face 18
says 18
shes 18
pleased 18
in 18
fact 18

almost 18
in 18
good 18
spirits 18
when 18
we 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
dining 18
hall 18
where 18
gales 18
waiting 18
to 18

me 18
receiving 18

happiness 18
there 18
are 18
still 18
moments 18
when 18
you 18
can 18
tell 18
something 18
slips 18
in 18
her 18
brain 18
and 18
another 18
world 18
blinds 18
her 18
to 18
us 18
but 18
a 18
few 18
words 18
from 18
finnick 18
call 18
her 18
back 18
delly 18
who 18
ive 18
known 18
since 18
i 18
was 18
little 18
but 18
never 18
gave 18
much 18
thought 18
to 18
has 18
grown 18
in 18
my 18
estimation 18
she 18
was 18
told 18
what 18
peeta 18
said 18
to 18
me 18
that 18
night 18
after 18
the 18
wedding 18
but 18
shes 18
not 18
a 18
gossip 18
haymitch 18
says 18
shes 18
the 18
best 18
defender 18
i 18
have 18
when 18
peeta 18
goes 18
off 18
on 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
tear 18
about 18
me 18
always 18
taking 18
my 18
side 18
blaming 18
his 18
negative 18
perceptions 18
on 18
the 18
capitols 18
torture 18
she 18
has 18
more 18
influence 18
on 18
him 18
than 18
any 18
of 18
the 18
others 18
do 18
because 18
he 18
really 18
does 18
know 18
her 18
anyway 18
even 18
if 18
shes 18
sugarcoating 18
my 18
good 18
points 18
i 18
appreciate 18
it 18
frankly 18
i 18
could 18
use 18
a 18
little 18
sugarcoating 18
im 18
starving 18
and 18
the 18
stew 18
is 18
so 18
deliciousbeef 18
potatoes 18
turnips 18
and 18
onions 18
in 18
a 18
thick 18
gravythat 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
force 18
myself 18
to 18
slow 18
down 18
all 18
around 18
the 18
dining 18
hall 18
you 18
can 18
feel 18
the 18
rejuvenating 18
effect 18
that 18
a 18
good 18
meal 18
can 18
bring 18
on 18
the 18
way 18
it 18
can 18
make 18
people 18
kinder 18
funnier 18
more 18
optimistic 18
and 18
remind 18
them 18
its 18
not 18
a 18
mistake 18
to 18
go 18
on 18
living 18
its 18
better 18
than 18
any 18
medicine 18
so 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
make 18
it 18
last 18
and 18
join 18
in 18
the 18
conversation 18
sop 18
up 18
the 18
gravy 18
on 18
my 18
bread 18
and 18
nibble 18
on 18
it 18
as 18
i 18
listen 18
to 18
finnick 18
telling 18
some 18
ridiculous 18
story 18
about 18
a 18
sea 18
turtle 18
swimming 18
off 18
with 18
his 18
hat 18
laugh 18
before 18

standing 18
there 18
directly 18
across 18
the 18
table 18
behind 18

empty 18
seat 18
next 18
to 18
johanna 18
watching 18
me 18
i 18
choke 18
momentarily 18
as 18
the 18
gravy 18
bread 18
sticks 18
in 18
my 18
throat 18
peeta 18

large 18
guards 18

behind 18

he 18
holds 18
his 18
tray 18
awkwardly 18
balanced 18
on 18
his 18
fingertips 18
since 18
his 18
wrists 18
are 18
shackled 18
with 18
a 18
short 18
chain 18
between 18
them 18

the 18
fancy 18
bracelets 18

johanna 18

trustworthy 18
yet 18

patting 18

the 18
guards 18

and 18
peeta 18
takes 18
a 18
seat 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18

adjoining 18
cells 18

familiar 18
with 18
each 18
others 18

annie 18
whos 18
on 18
johannas 18

that 18
thing 18
where 18
she 18
covers 18
her 18
ears 18
and 18
exits 18
reality 18
finnick 18
shoots 18
johanna 18
an 18
angry 18
look 18
as 18
his 18
arm 18
encircles 18
annie 18
what 18
my 18
head 18
doctor 18

thoughts 18
its 18
part 18
of 18
my 18
therapy 18
replies 18
johanna 18
the 18
life 18
has 18
gone 18
out 18
of 18
our 18
little 18
party 18
finnick 18
murmurs 18
things 18
to 18
annie 18
until 18
she 18
slowly 18
removes 18
her 18
hands 18
then 18
theres 18
a 18
long 18
silence 18
while 18
people 18
pretend 18
to 18
eat 18
annie 18
says 18
delly 18
brightly 18
did 18
you 18
know 18
it 18
was 18
peeta 18
who 18
decorated 18
your 18
wedding 18
cake 18
back 18
home 18
his 18
family 18
ran 18
the 18
bakery 18
and 18
he 18
did 18
all 18
the 18
icing 18
annie 18
cautiously 18
looks 18
across 18
johanna 18
thank 18
you 18
peeta 18
it 18
was 18
beautiful 18
my 18
pleasure 18
annie 18
says 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
hear 18
that 18
old 18
note 18
of 18
gentleness 18
in 18
his 18
voice 18
that 18
i 18
thought 18
was 18
gone 18
forever 18
not 18
that 18
its 18
directed 18
at 18
me 18
but 18
still 18
if 18
were 18
going 18
to 18
fit 18
in 18
that 18
walk 18
we 18
better 18
go 18
finnick 18
tells 18
her 18
he 18
arranges 18
both 18
of 18
their 18
trays 18
so 18
he 18
can 18
carry 18
them 18
in 18
one 18
hand 18
while 18
holding 18
tightly 18
to 18
her 18
with 18
the 18
other 18
good 18
seeing 18
you 18
peeta 18
you 18
be 18
nice 18
to 18
her 18
finnick 18
or 18
i 18
might 18
try 18
and 18
take 18
her 18
away 18
from 18
you 18
it 18
could 18
be 18
a 18
joke 18
if 18
the 18
tone 18
wasnt 18
so 18
cold 18
everything 18
it 18
conveys 18
is 18
wrong 18
the 18
open 18
distrust 18
of 18
finnick 18
the 18
implication 18
that 18
peeta 18
has 18
his 18
eye 18
on 18
annie 18
that 18
annie 18
could 18
desert 18
finnick 18
that 18
i 18
do 18
not 18
even 18
exist 18
oh 18
peeta 18
says 18
finnick 18
lightly 18
dont 18
make 18
me 18
sorry 18
i 18
restarted 18
your 18
heart 18
he 18
leads 18
annie 18
away 18
after 18
giving 18
me 18
a 18
concerned 18
glance 18
when 18
theyre 18
gone 18
delly 18
says 18
in 18
a 18
reproachful 18
voice 18
he 18
did 18
save 18
your 18
life 18
peeta 18
more 18
than 18
once 18
for 18
her 18
he 18
gives 18
me 18
a 18
brief 18
nod 18
for 18
the 18
rebellion 18
not 18
for 18
me 18
i 18
dont 18
owe 18
him 18
anything 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
rise 18
to 18
the 18
bait 18
but 18
i 18
do 18
maybe 18
not 18
but 18
mags 18
is 18
dead 18
and 18
youre 18
still 18
here 18
that 18
should 18
count 18
for 18
something 18
yeah 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
things 18
should 18
count 18
for 18
something 18
that 18
dont 18
seem 18
to 18
katniss 18
ive 18
got 18
some 18
memories 18
i 18
cant 18
make 18
sense 18
of 18
and 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
the 18
capitol 18
touched 18
them 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
nights 18
on 18
the 18
train 18
for 18
instance 18
he 18
says 18
again 18
the 18
implications 18
that 18
more 18
happened 18
on 18
the 18
train 18
than 18
did 18
that 18
what 18
did 18
happenthose 18
nights 18
i 18
only 18
kept 18
my 18
sanity 18
because 18
his 18
arms 18
were 18
around 18
meno 18
longer 18
matters 18
everything 18
a 18
lie 18
everything 18
a 18
way 18
of 18
misusing 18
him 18
peeta 18
makes 18
a 18
little 18
gesture 18
with 18
his 18
spoon 18
connecting 18
gale 18
and 18
me 18
so 18
are 18
you 18
two 18
officially 18
a 18
couple 18
now 18
or 18
are 18
they 18
still 18
dragging 18
out 18
the 18
starcrossed 18
lover 18
thing 18
still 18
dragging 18
says 18
johanna 18
spasms 18
cause 18
peetas 18
hands 18
to 18
tighten 18
into 18
fists 18
then 18
splay 18
out 18
in 18
a 18
bizarre 18
fashion 18
is 18
it 18
all 18
he 18
can 18
do 18
to 18
keep 18
them 18
from 18
my 18
neck 18
i 18
can 18
feel 18
the 18
tension 18
in 18
gales 18
muscles 18
next 18
to 18
me 18
fear 18
an 18
altercation 18
but 18
gale 18
simply 18
says 18
i 18
wouldnt 18
have 18
believed 18
it 18
if 18
i 18
hadnt 18
seen 18
it 18
myself 18
whats 18
that 18
asks 18
peeta 18
you 18
gale 18
answers 18
youll 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
little 18
more 18
specific 18
says 18
peeta 18
what 18
about 18
me 18
that 18
theyve 18
replaced 18
you 18
with 18
the 18
evilmutt 18
version 18
of 18
yourself 18
says 18
johanna 18
gale 18
finishes 18
his 18
milk 18
you 18
done 18
he 18
asks 18
me 18
i 18
rise 18
and 18
we 18
cross 18
to 18
drop 18
off 18
our 18
trays 18
at 18
the 18
door 18
an 18
old 18
man 18
stops 18
me 18
because 18
im 18
still 18
clutching 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
my 18
gravy 18
bread 18
in 18
my 18
hand 18
something 18
in 18
my 18
expression 18
or 18
maybe 18
the 18
fact 18
that 18
ive 18
made 18
no 18
attempt 18
to 18
conceal 18
it 18
makes 18
him 18
go 18
easy 18
on 18
me 18
he 18
lets 18
me 18
stuff 18
the 18
bread 18
in 18
my 18
mouth 18
and 18
move 18
on 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
are 18
almost 18
to 18
my 18
compartment 18
when 18
he 18
speaks 18
again 18
i 18
didnt 18
expect 18
that 18
i 18
told 18
you 18
he 18
hated 18
me 18
i 18
say 18
its 18
the 18
way 18
he 18
hates 18
you 18
its 18
sofamiliar 18
i 18
used 18
to 18
feel 18
like 18
that 18
he 18
admits 18
when 18
id 18
watch 18
you 18
kissing 18
him 18
on 18
the 18
screen 18
only 18
i 18
knew 18
i 18
wasnt 18
being 18
entirely 18
fair 18
he 18
cant 18
see 18
that 18
we 18
reach 18
my 18
door 18
maybe 18
he 18
just 18
sees 18
me 18
as 18
i 18
really 18
am 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
get 18
some 18
sleep 18
gale 18
catches 18
my 18
arm 18
before 18
i 18
can 18
disappear 18
so 18
thats 18
what 18
youre 18
thinking 18
now 18
i 18
shrug 18
katniss 18
as 18
your 18
oldest 18
friend 18

me 18
when 18
i 18
say 18
hes 18
not 18
seeing 18
you 18
as 18
you 18
really 18
are 18
he 18
kisses 18
my 18
cheek 18
and 18
goes 18
i 18
sit 18
on 18
my 18
bed 18
trying 18
to 18
stuff 18
information 18
from 18
my 18
military 18
tactics 18
books 18
into 18
my 18
head 18
while 18
memories 18
of 18
my 18
nights 18
with 18
peeta 18
on 18
the 18
train 18
distract 18
me 18
after 18
about 18
twenty 18
minutes 18
johanna 18
comes 18
in 18
and 18
throws 18
herself 18
across 18
the 18
foot 18
of 18
my 18
bed 18
you 18
missed 18
the 18
best 18
part 18

her 18
temper 18
at 18
peeta 18
over 18
how 18
he 18
treated 18
you 18
she 18
got 18
very 18
squeaky 18
it 18
was 18
like 18
someone 18
stabbing 18
a 18
mouse 18
with 18
a 18
fork 18
repeatedly 18
the 18
whole 18
dining 18
hall 18
was 18
riveted 18
whatd 18
peeta 18
do 18
i 18
ask 18
he 18
started 18
arguing 18
with 18
himself 18
like 18
he 18
was 18
two 18
people 18
the 18
guards 18
had 18
to 18
take 18
him 18
away 18
on 18
the 18
good 18
side 18
no 18
one 18
seemed 18
to 18
notice 18
i 18
finished 18
his 18
stew 18
johanna 18
rubs 18
her 18
hand 18
over 18
her 18
protruding 18
belly 18
i 18
look 18
at 18
the 18
layer 18
of 18
grime 18
under 18
her 18
fingernails 18
wonder 18
if 18
the 18
people 18
in 18
ever 18
bathe 18
we 18
spend 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
hours 18
quizzing 18
each 18
other 18
on 18
military 18
terms 18
i 18
visit 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18

a 18
while 18
when 18
im 18
back 18
in 18
my 18
compartment 18
showered 18
staring 18
into 18
the 18
darkness 18
i 18
finally 18
ask 18
johanna 18
could 18
you 18
really 18
hear 18
him 18
screaming 18
that 18
was 18
part 18
of 18
it 18
she 18
says 18
like 18
the 18
jabberjays 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
only 18
it 18
was 18
real 18

new 18

to 18
show 18
the 18
rebels 18
preparing 18
for 18
the 18
capitol 18
invasion 18
on 18
the 18
whole 18
things 18
are 18
going 18
pretty 18
well 18
then 18
peeta 18
starts 18
showing 18
up 18
for 18
our 18
morning 18
workouts 18
the 18
manacles 18
are 18
off 18
but 18
hes 18
still 18
constantly 18
accompanied 18
by 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
guards 18
after 18
lunch 18
i 18
see 18
him 18
across 18
the 18
field 18
drilling 18
with 18
a 18
group 18
of 18
beginners 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
theyre 18
thinking 18
if 18
a 18
spat 18
with 18
delly 18
can 18
reduce 18
him 18
to 18
arguing 18
with 18
himself 18
hes 18
got 18
no 18
business 18
learning 18
how 18
to 18
assemble 18
a 18
gun 18
when 18
i 18
confront 18
plutarch 18
he 18
assures 18
me 18
that 18
its 18
all 18
for 18
the 18
camera 18
theyve 18
got 18
footage 18
of 18
annie 18
getting 18
married 18
and 18
johanna 18
hitting 18
targets 18
but 18
all 18
of 18
panem 18
is 18
wondering 18
about 18
peeta 18
they 18
need 18
to 18
see 18
hes 18
fighting 18
for 18
the 18
rebels 18
not 18
for 18
snow 18
and 18
maybe 18
if 18
they 18
could 18
just 18
get 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
shots 18
of 18
the 18
two 18
of 18
us 18
not 18
kissing 18
necessarily 18
just 18
looking 18
happy 18
to 18
be 18
back 18
together 18
i 18
walk 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
conversation 18
right 18
then 18
that 18
is 18
not 18
going 18
to 18
happen 18
in 18
my 18
rare 18
moments 18
of 18
downtime 18
i 18
anxiously 18
watch 18
the 18
preparations 18
for 18
the 18
invasions 18
see 18
equipment 18
and 18
provisions 18
readied 18
divisions 18
assembled 18
you 18
can 18
tell 18
when 18
someones 18
received 18
orders 18
because 18
theyre 18
given 18
a 18
very 18
short 18
haircut 18
the 18
mark 18
of 18
a 18
person 18
going 18
into 18
battle 18
there 18
is 18
much 18
talk 18
of 18
the 18
opening 18
offensive 18
which 18
will 18
be 18
to 18
secure 18
the 18
train 18
tunnels 18
that 18
feed 18
up 18
into 18
the 18
capitol 18
just 18
a 18
few 18
days 18
before 18
the 18
first 18
troops 18
are 18
to 18
move 18
out 18
york 18
unexpectedly 18
tells 18
johanna 18
and 18
me 18
shes 18
recommended 18
us 18
for 18
the 18
exam 18
and 18
were 18
to 18
report 18
immediately 18
there 18
are 18
four 18
parts 18
an 18
obstacle 18
course 18
that 18
assesses 18
your 18
physical 18
condition 18
a 18
written 18
tactics 18
exam 18
a 18
test 18
of 18
weapons 18
proficiency 18
and 18
a 18
simulated 18
combat 18
situation 18
in 18
the 18
block 18
i 18
dont 18
even 18
have 18
time 18
to 18
get 18
nervous 18
for 18
the 18
first 18
three 18
and 18
do 18
well 18
but 18
theres 18
a 18
backlog 18
at 18
the 18
block 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
technical 18
bug 18
theyre 18
working 18
out 18
a 18
group 18
of 18
us 18
exchanges 18
information 18
this 18
much 18
seems 18
true 18
you 18
go 18
through 18
alone 18
theres 18
no 18
predicting 18
what 18
situation 18
youll 18
be 18
thrown 18
into 18
one 18
boy 18
says 18
under 18
his 18
breath 18
that 18
hes 18
heard 18
its 18
designed 18
to 18
target 18
each 18
individuals 18
weaknesses 18
my 18
weaknesses 18
thats 18
a 18
door 18
i 18
dont 18
even 18
want 18
to 18
open 18
but 18
i 18
find 18
a 18
quiet 18
spot 18
and 18
try 18
to 18
assess 18
what 18
they 18
might 18
be 18
the 18
length 18
of 18
the 18
list 18
depresses 18
me 18
lack 18
of 18
physical 18
brute 18
force 18
a 18
bare 18
minimum 18
of 18
training 18
and 18
somehow 18
my 18
standout 18
status 18
as 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
to 18
be 18
an 18
advantage 18
in 18
a 18
situation 18
where 18
theyre 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
us 18
to 18
blend 18
into 18
a 18
pack 18
they 18
could 18
nail 18
me 18
to 18
the 18
wall 18
on 18
any 18
number 18
of 18
things 18
johannas 18
called 18
three 18
ahead 18
of 18
me 18
and 18
i 18
give 18
her 18
a 18
nod 18
of 18
encouragement 18
i 18
wish 18
i 18
had 18
been 18
at 18
the 18
top 18
of 18
the 18
list 18
because 18
now 18
im 18
really 18
overthinking 18
the 18
whole 18
thing 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
my 18
names 18
called 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
my 18
strategy 18
should 18
be 18
fortunately 18
once 18
im 18
in 18
the 18
block 18
a 18
certain 18
amount 18
of 18
training 18
does 18
kick 18
in 18
its 18
an 18
ambush 18
situation 18
peacekeepers 18
appear 18
almost 18
instantly 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
make 18
my 18
way 18
to 18
a 18
rendezvous 18
point 18
to 18
meet 18
up 18
with 18
my 18
scattered 18
squad 18
i 18
slowly 18
navigate 18
the 18
street 18
taking 18
out 18
peacekeepers 18
as 18
i 18
go 18
two 18
on 18
the 18
rooftop 18
to 18
my 18
left 18
another 18
in 18
the 18
doorway 18
up 18
ahead 18
its 18
challenging 18
but 18
not 18
as 18
hard 18
as 18
i 18
was 18
expecting 18
theres 18
a 18
nagging 18
feeling 18
that 18
if 18
its 18
too 18
simple 18
i 18
must 18
be 18
missing 18
the 18
point 18
im 18
within 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
buildings 18
from 18
my 18
goal 18
when 18
things 18
begin 18
to 18
heat 18
up 18
a 18
half 18
dozen 18
peacekeepers 18
come 18
charging 18
around 18
the 18
corner 18
they 18
will 18
outgun 18
me 18
but 18
i 18
notice 18
something 18
a 18
drum 18
of 18
gasoline 18
lying 18
carelessly 18
in 18
the 18
gutter 18
this 18
is 18
it 18
my 18
test 18
to 18
perceive 18
that 18
blowing 18
up 18
the 18
drum 18
will 18
be 18
the 18
only 18
way 18
to 18
achieve 18
my 18
mission 18
just 18
as 18
i 18
step 18
out 18
to 18
do 18
it 18
my 18
squadron 18
leader 18
whos 18
been 18
fairly 18
useless 18
up 18
to 18
this 18
point 18
quietly 18
orders 18
me 18
to 18
hit 18
the 18
ground 18
every 18
instinct 18
i 18
have 18
screams 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
ignore 18
the 18
voice 18
to 18
pull 18
the 18
trigger 18
to 18
blow 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
skyhigh 18
and 18
suddenly 18
i 18
realize 18
what 18
the 18
military 18
will 18
think 18
my 18
biggest 18
weakness 18
is 18
from 18
my 18
first 18
moment 18
in 18
the 18
games 18
when 18
i 18
ran 18
for 18
that 18
orange 18
backpack 18
to 18
the 18
firefight 18
in 18
to 18
my 18
impulsive 18
race 18
across 18
the 18
square 18
in 18
i 18
cannot 18
take 18
orders 18
i 18
smack 18
into 18
the 18
ground 18
so 18
hard 18
and 18
fast 18
ill 18
be 18
picking 18
gravel 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
chin 18
for 18
a 18
week 18
someone 18
else 18
blows 18
the 18
gas 18
tank 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
die 18
i 18
make 18
my 18
rendezvous 18
point 18
when 18
i 18
exit 18
the 18
block 18
on 18
the 18
far 18
side 18
a 18
soldier 18
congratulates 18
me 18
stamps 18
my 18
hand 18
with 18
squad 18
number 18
and 18
tells 18
me 18
to 18
report 18
to 18
command 18
almost 18
giddy 18
with 18
success 18
i 18
run 18
through 18
the 18
halls 18
skidding 18
around 18
corners 18
bounding 18
down 18
the 18
steps 18
because 18
the 18
elevators 18
too 18
slow 18
i 18
bang 18
into 18
the 18
room 18
before 18
the 18
oddity 18
of 18
the 18
situation 18
dawns 18
on 18
me 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
be 18
in 18
command 18
i 18
should 18
be 18
getting 18
my 18
hair 18
buzzed 18
the 18
people 18
around 18
the 18
table 18
arent 18
freshly 18
minted 18
soldiers 18
but 18
the 18
ones 18
calling 18
the 18
shots 18
boggs 18
smiles 18
and 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
when 18
he 18
sees 18
me 18
lets 18
see 18
it 18
unsure 18
now 18
i 18
hold 18
out 18
my 18
stamped 18
hand 18
youre 18
with 18
me 18
its 18
a 18
special 18
unit 18
of 18
sharpshooters 18
join 18
your 18
squad 18
he 18
nods 18
over 18
at 18
a 18
group 18
lining 18
the 18
wall 18
gale 18
finnick 18
five 18
others 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
my 18
squad 18
im 18
not 18
only 18
in 18
i 18
get 18
to 18
work 18
under 18
boggs 18
with 18
my 18
friends 18
i 18
force 18
myself 18
to 18
take 18
calm 18
soldierly 18
steps 18
to 18
join 18
them 18
instead 18
of 18
jumping 18
up 18
and 18
down 18
we 18
must 18
be 18
important 18
too 18
because 18
were 18
in 18
command 18
and 18
it 18
has 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
a 18
certain 18
mockingjay 18
plutarch 18
stands 18
over 18
a 18
wide 18
flat 18
panel 18
in 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
table 18
hes 18
explaining 18
something 18
about 18
the 18
nature 18
of 18
what 18
we 18
will 18
encounter 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
im 18
thinking 18
this 18
is 18
a 18
terrible 18
presentationbecause 18
even 18
on 18
tiptoe 18
i 18
cant 18
see 18
whats 18
on 18
the 18
paneluntil 18
he 18
hits 18
a 18
button 18
a 18
holographic 18
image 18
of 18
a 18
block 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
projects 18
into 18
the 18
air 18
this 18
for 18
example 18
is 18
the 18
area 18
surrounding 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
barracks 18
not 18
unimportant 18
but 18
not 18
the 18
most 18
crucial 18
of 18
targets 18
and 18
yet 18
look 18
plutarch 18
enters 18
some 18
sort 18
of 18
code 18
on 18
a 18
keyboard 18
and 18
lights 18
begin 18
to 18
flash 18
theyre 18
in 18
an 18
assortment 18
of 18
colors 18
and 18
blink 18
at 18
different 18
speeds 18
each 18
light 18
is 18
called 18
a 18
pod 18
it 18
represents 18
a 18
different 18
obstacle 18
the 18
nature 18
of 18
which 18
could 18
be 18
anything 18
from 18
a 18
bomb 18
to 18
a 18
band 18
of 18
mutts 18
make 18
no 18
mistake 18
whatever 18
it 18
contains 18
is 18
designed 18
to 18
either 18
trap 18
or 18
kill 18
you 18
some 18
have 18
been 18
in 18
place 18
since 18
the 18
dark 18
days 18
others 18
developed 18
over 18
the 18
years 18
to 18
be 18
honest 18
i 18
created 18
a 18
fair 18
number 18
myself 18
this 18
program 18
which 18
one 18
of 18
our 18
people 18
absconded 18
with 18
when 18
we 18
left 18
the 18
capitol 18
is 18
our 18
most 18
recent 18
information 18
they 18
dont 18
know 18
we 18
have 18
it 18
but 18
even 18
so 18
its 18
likely 18
that 18
new 18
pods 18
have 18
been 18
activated 18
in 18
the 18
last 18
few 18
months 18
this 18
is 18
what 18
you 18
will 18
face 18
im 18
unaware 18
that 18
my 18
feet 18
are 18
moving 18
to 18
the 18
table 18
until 18
im 18
inches 18
from 18
the 18
holograph 18
my 18
hand 18
reaches 18
in 18
and 18
cups 18
a 18
rapidly 18
blinking 18
green 18
light 18
someone 18
joins 18
me 18
his 18
body 18
tense 18
finnick 18
of 18
course 18
because 18
only 18
a 18
victor 18
would 18
see 18
what 18
i 18
see 18
so 18
immediately 18
the 18
arena 18
laced 18
with 18
pods 18
controlled 18
by 18
gamemakers 18
finnicks 18
fingers 18
caress 18
a 18
steady 18
red 18
glow 18
over 18
a 18
doorway 18
ladies 18
and 18
gentlemen 18
his 18
voice 18
is 18
quiet 18
but 18
mine 18
rings 18
through 18
the 18
room 18
let 18
the 18
seventysixth 18
hunger 18
games 18
begin 18
i 18
laugh 18
quickly 18
before 18
anyone 18
has 18
time 18
to 18
register 18
what 18
lies 18
beneath 18
the 18
words 18
i 18
have 18
just 18
uttered 18
before 18
eyebrows 18
are 18
raised 18
objections 18
are 18
uttered 18
two 18
and 18
two 18
are 18
put 18
together 18
and 18
the 18
solution 18
is 18
that 18
i 18
should 18
be 18
kept 18
as 18
far 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
as 18
possible 18
because 18
an 18
angry 18
independently 18
thinking 18
victor 18
with 18
a 18
layer 18
of 18
psychological 18
scar 18
tissue 18
too 18
thick 18
to 18
penetrate 18
is 18
maybe 18
the 18
last 18
person 18
you 18
want 18
on 18
your 18
squad 18
i 18
dont 18
even 18
know 18
why 18
you 18
bothered 18
to 18
put 18
finnick 18
and 18
me 18
through 18
training 18
plutarch 18
i 18
say 18
yeah 18
were 18
already 18
the 18
two 18
bestequipped 18
soldiers 18
you 18
have 18
finnick 18
adds 18
cockily 18
do 18
not 18
think 18
that 18
fact 18
escapes 18
me 18
he 18
says 18
with 18
an 18
impatient 18
wave 18
now 18
back 18
in 18
line 18
soldiers 18
odair 18
and 18
everdeen 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
presentation 18
to 18
finish 18
we 18
retreat 18
to 18
our 18
places 18
ignoring 18
the 18
questioning 18
looks 18
thrown 18
our 18
way 18
i 18
adopt 18
an 18
attitude 18
of 18
extreme 18
concentration 18
as 18
plutarch 18
continues 18
nodding 18
my 18
head 18
here 18
and 18
there 18
shifting 18
my 18
position 18
to 18
get 18
a 18
better 18
view 18
all 18
the 18
while 18
telling 18
myself 18
to 18
hang 18
on 18
until 18
i 18
can 18
get 18
to 18
the 18
woods 18
and 18
scream 18
or 18
curse 18
or 18
cry 18
or 18
maybe 18
all 18
three 18
at 18
once 18
if 18
this 18
was 18
a 18
test 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
both 18
pass 18
it 18
when 18
plutarch 18
finishes 18
and 18
the 18
meetings 18
adjourned 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
bad 18
moment 18
when 18
i 18
learn 18
theres 18
a 18
special 18
order 18
for 18
me 18
but 18
its 18
merely 18
that 18
i 18
skip 18
the 18
military 18
haircut 18
because 18
they 18
would 18
like 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
to 18
look 18
as 18
much 18
like 18
the 18
girl 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
as 18
possible 18
at 18
the 18
anticipated 18
surrender 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
you 18
know 18
i 18
shrug 18
to 18
communicate 18
that 18
my 18
hair 18
lengths 18
a 18
matter 18
of 18
complete 18
indifference 18
to 18
me 18
they 18
dismiss 18
me 18
without 18
further 18
comment 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
gravitate 18
toward 18
each 18
other 18
in 18
the 18
hallway 18
what 18
will 18
i 18
tell 18
annie 18
he 18
says 18
under 18
his 18
breath 18
nothing 18
i 18
answer 18
thats 18
what 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
sister 18
will 18
be 18
hearing 18
from 18
me 18
bad 18
enough 18
that 18
we 18
know 18
were 18
heading 18
back 18
into 18
a 18
fully 18
equipped 18
arena 18
no 18
use 18
dropping 18
it 18
on 18
our 18
loved 18
ones 18
if 18
she 18
sees 18
that 18
holograph 18
he 18
begins 18
she 18
wont 18
its 18
classified 18
information 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
i 18
say 18
anyway 18
its 18
not 18
like 18
an 18
actual 18
games 18
any 18
number 18
of 18
people 18
will 18
survive 18
were 18
just 18
overreacting 18
becausewell 18
you 18
know 18
why 18
you 18
still 18
want 18
to 18
go 18
dont 18
you 18
of 18
course 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
destroy 18
snow 18
as 18
much 18
as 18
you 18
do 18
he 18
says 18
it 18
wont 18
be 18
like 18
the 18
others 18
i 18
say 18
firmly 18
trying 18
to 18
convince 18
myself 18
as 18
well 18
then 18
the 18
real 18
beauty 18
of 18
the 18
situation 18
dawns 18
on 18
me 18
this 18
time 18
snow 18
will 18
be 18
a 18
player 18
too 18
before 18
we 18
can 18
continue 18
haymitch 18
appears 18
he 18
wasnt 18
at 18
the 18
meeting 18
isnt 18
thinking 18
of 18
arenas 18
but 18
something 18
else 18
johannas 18
back 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
i 18
assumed 18
johanna 18
was 18
fine 18
had 18
passed 18
her 18
exam 18
but 18
simply 18
wasnt 18
assigned 18
to 18
a 18
sharpshooters 18
unit 18
shes 18
wicked 18
throwing 18
an 18
ax 18
but 18
about 18
average 18
with 18
a 18
gun 18
is 18
she 18
hurt 18
what 18
happened 18
it 18
was 18
while 18
she 18
was 18
on 18
the 18
block 18
they 18
try 18
to 18
ferret 18
out 18
a 18
soldiers 18
potential 18
weaknesses 18
so 18
they 18
flooded 18
the 18
street 18
says 18
haymitch 18
this 18
doesnt 18
help 18
johanna 18
can 18
swim 18
at 18
least 18
i 18
seem 18
to 18
remember 18
her 18
swimming 18
around 18
some 18
in 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
not 18
like 18
finnick 18
of 18
course 18
but 18
none 18
of 18
us 18
are 18
like 18
finnick 18
so 18
thats 18
how 18
they 18
tortured 18
her 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
soaked 18
her 18
and 18
then 18
used 18
electric 18
shocks 18
says 18
haymitch 18
in 18
the 18
block 18
she 18
had 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
flashback 18
panicked 18
didnt 18
know 18
where 18
she 18
was 18
shes 18
back 18
under 18
sedation 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
just 18
stand 18
there 18
as 18
if 18
weve 18
lost 18
the 18
ability 18
to 18
respond 18
i 18
think 18
of 18
the 18
way 18
johanna 18
never 18
showers 18
how 18
she 18
forced 18
herself 18
into 18
the 18
rain 18
like 18
it 18
was 18
acid 18
that 18
day 18
i 18
had 18
attributed 18
her 18
misery 18
to 18
the 18
morphling 18
withdrawal 18
you 18
two 18
should 18
go 18
see 18
her 18
youre 18
as 18
close 18
to 18
friends 18
as 18
shes 18
got 18
says 18
haymitch 18
that 18
makes 18
the 18
whole 18
thing 18
worse 18
i 18
dont 18
really 18
know 18
whats 18
between 18
johanna 18
and 18
finnick 18
but 18
i 18
hardly 18
know 18
her 18
no 18
family 18
no 18
friends 18
not 18
so 18
much 18
as 18
a 18
token 18
from 18
to 18
set 18
beside 18
her 18
regulation 18
clothes 18
in 18
her 18
anonymous 18
drawer 18
nothing 18
i 18
better 18
go 18
tell 18
plutarch 18
he 18
wont 18
be 18
happy 18
haymitch 18
continues 18
he 18
wants 18
as 18
many 18
victors 18
as 18
possible 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
to 18
follow 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
thinks 18
it 18
makes 18
for 18
better 18
television 18
are 18
you 18
and 18
beetee 18
going 18
i 18
ask 18
as 18
many 18
young 18
and 18
attractive 18
victors 18
as 18
possible 18
haymitch 18
corrects 18
himself 18
so 18
no 18
well 18
be 18
here 18
finnick 18
goes 18
directly 18
down 18
to 18
see 18
johanna 18
but 18
i 18
linger 18
outside 18
a 18
few 18
minutes 18
until 18
boggs 18
comes 18
out 18
hes 18
my 18
commander 18
now 18
so 18
i 18
guess 18
hes 18
the 18
one 18
to 18
ask 18
for 18
any 18
special 18
favors 18
when 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
what 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
do 18
he 18
writes 18
me 18
a 18
pass 18
so 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
go 18
to 18
the 18
woods 18
during 18
reflection 18
provided 18
i 18
stay 18
within 18
sight 18
of 18
the 18
guards 18
i 18
run 18
to 18
my 18
compartment 18
thinking 18
to 18
use 18
the 18
parachute 18
but 18
its 18
so 18
full 18
of 18
ugly 18
memories 18
instead 18
i 18
go 18
across 18
the 18
hall 18
and 18
take 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
white 18
cotton 18
bandages 18
i 18
brought 18
from 18
square 18
sturdy 18
just 18
the 18
thing 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
i 18
find 18
a 18
pine 18
tree 18
and 18
strip 18
handfuls 18
of 18
fragrant 18
needles 18
from 18
the 18
boughs 18
after 18
making 18
a 18
neat 18
pile 18
in 18
the 18
middle 18
of 18
the 18
bandage 18
i 18
gather 18
up 18
the 18
sides 18
give 18
them 18
a 18
twist 18
and 18
tie 18
them 18
tightly 18
with 18
a 18
length 18
of 18
vine 18
making 18
an 18
applesized 18
bundle 18
at 18
the 18
hospital 18
room 18
door 18
i 18
watch 18
johanna 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
realize 18
that 18
most 18
of 18
her 18
ferocity 18
is 18
in 18
her 18
abrasive 18
attitude 18
stripped 18
of 18
that 18
as 18
she 18
is 18
now 18
theres 18
only 18
a 18
slight 18
young 18
woman 18
her 18
wideset 18
eyes 18
fighting 18
to 18
stay 18
awake 18
against 18
the 18
power 18
of 18
the 18
drugs 18
terrified 18
of 18
what 18
sleep 18
will 18
bring 18
i 18
cross 18
to 18
her 18
and 18
hold 18
out 18
the 18
bundle 18
whats 18
that 18
she 18
says 18
hoarsely 18
damp 18
edges 18
of 18
her 18
hair 18
form 18
little 18
spikes 18
over 18
her 18
forehead 18
i 18
made 18
it 18
for 18
you 18
something 18
to 18
put 18
in 18
your 18
drawer 18
i 18
place 18
it 18
in 18
her 18
hands 18
smell 18
it 18
she 18
lifts 18
the 18
bundle 18
to 18
her 18
nose 18
and 18
takes 18
a 18
tentative 18
sniff 18
smells 18
like 18
home 18
tears 18
flood 18
her 18
eyes 18
thats 18
what 18
i 18
was 18
hoping 18
you 18
being 18
from 18
seven 18
and 18
all 18
i 18
say 18
remember 18
when 18
we 18
met 18
you 18
were 18
a 18
tree 18
well 18
briefly 18
suddenly 18
she 18
has 18
my 18
wrist 18
in 18
an 18
iron 18
grip 18
you 18
have 18
to 18
kill 18
him 18
katniss 18
dont 18
worry 18
i 18
resist 18
the 18
temptation 18
to 18
wrench 18
my 18
arm 18
free 18
swear 18
it 18
on 18
something 18
you 18
care 18
about 18
she 18
hisses 18
i 18
swear 18
it 18
on 18
my 18
life 18
but 18
she 18
doesnt 18
let 18
go 18
of 18
my 18
arm 18
on 18
your 18
familys 18
life 18
she 18
insists 18
on 18
my 18
familys 18
life 18
i 18
repeat 18
i 18
guess 18
my 18
concern 18
for 18
my 18
own 18
survival 18
isnt 18
compelling 18
enough 18
she 18
lets 18
go 18
and 18
i 18
rub 18
my 18
wrist 18
why 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
im 18
going 18
anyway 18
brainless 18
that 18
makes 18
her 18
smile 18
a 18
little 18
i 18
just 18
needed 18
to 18
hear 18
it 18
she 18
presses 18
the 18
bundle 18
of 18
pine 18
needles 18
to 18
her 18
nose 18
and 18
closes 18
her 18
eyes 18
the 18
remaining 18
days 18
go 18
by 18
in 18
a 18
whirl 18
after 18
a 18
brief 18
workout 18
each 18
morning 18
my 18
squads 18
on 18
the 18
shooting 18
range 18
fulltime 18
in 18
training 18
i 18
practice 18
mostly 18
with 18
a 18
gun 18
but 18
they 18
reserve 18
an 18
hour 18
a 18
day 18
for 18
specialty 18
weapons 18
which 18
means 18
i 18
get 18
to 18
use 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
bow 18
gale 18
his 18
heavy 18
militarized 18
one 18
the 18
trident 18
beetee 18
designed 18
for 18
finnick 18
has 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
special 18
features 18
but 18
the 18
most 18
remarkable 18
is 18
that 18
he 18
can 18
throw 18
it 18
press 18
a 18
button 18
on 18
a 18
metal 18
cuff 18
on 18
his 18
wrist 18
and 18
return 18
it 18
to 18
his 18
hand 18
without 18
chasing 18
it 18
down 18
sometimes 18
we 18
shoot 18
at 18
peacekeeper 18
dummies 18
to 18
become 18
familiar 18
with 18
the 18
weaknesses 18
in 18
their 18
protective 18
gear 18
the 18
chinks 18
in 18
the 18
armor 18
so 18
to 18
speak 18
if 18
you 18
hit 18
flesh 18
youre 18
rewarded 18
with 18
a 18
burst 18
of 18
fake 18
blood 18
our 18
dummies 18
are 18
soaked 18
in 18
red 18
its 18
reassuring 18
to 18
see 18
just 18
how 18
high 18
the 18
overall 18
level 18
of 18
accuracy 18
is 18
in 18
our 18
group 18
along 18
with 18
finnick 18
and 18
gale 18
the 18
squad 18
includes 18
five 18
soldiers 18
from 18
jackson 18
a 18
middleaged 18
woman 18
whos 18
boggss 18
second 18
in 18
command 18
looks 18
kind 18
of 18
sluggish 18
but 18
can 18
hit 18
things 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
cant 18
even 18
see 18
without 18
a 18
scope 18
farsighted 18
she 18
says 18
theres 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
sisters 18
in 18
their 18
twenties 18
named 18
leegwe 18
call 18
them 18
leeg 18
and 18
leeg 18
for 18
claritywho 18
are 18
so 18
similar 18
in 18
uniform 18
i 18
cant 18
tell 18
them 18
apart 18
until 18
i 18
notice 18
leeg 18
has 18
weird 18
yellow 18
flecks 18
in 18
her 18
eyes 18
two 18
older 18
guys 18
mitchell 18
and 18
homes 18
never 18
say 18
much 18
but 18
can 18
shoot 18
the 18
dust 18
off 18
your 18
boots 18
at 18
fifty 18
yards 18
i 18
see 18
other 18
squads 18
that 18
are 18
also 18
quite 18
good 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
fully 18
understand 18
our 18
status 18
until 18
the 18
morning 18
plutarch 18
joins 18
us 18
squad 18
fourfiveone 18
you 18
have 18
been 18
selected 18
for 18
a 18
special 18
mission 18
he 18
begins 18
i 18
bite 18
the 18
inside 18
of 18
my 18
lip 18
hoping 18
against 18
hope 18
that 18
its 18
to 18
assassinate 18
snow 18
we 18
have 18
numerous 18
sharpshooters 18
but 18
rather 18
a 18
dearth 18
of 18
camera 18
crews 18
therefore 18
weve 18
handpicked 18
the 18
eight 18
of 18
you 18
to 18
be 18
what 18
we 18
call 18
our 18
star 18
squad 18
you 18
will 18
be 18
the 18
onscreen 18
faces 18
of 18
the 18
invasion 18
disappointment 18
shock 18
then 18
anger 18
run 18
through 18
the 18
group 18
what 18
youre 18
saying 18
is 18
we 18
wont 18
be 18
in 18
actual 18
combat 18
snaps 18
gale 18
you 18
will 18
be 18
in 18
combat 18
but 18
perhaps 18
not 18
always 18
on 18
the 18
front 18
line 18
if 18
one 18
can 18
even 18
isolate 18
a 18
front 18
line 18
in 18
this 18
type 18
of 18
war 18
says 18
plutarch 18
none 18
of 18
us 18
wants 18
that 18
finnicks 18
remark 18
is 18
followed 18
by 18
a 18
general 18
rumble 18
of 18
assent 18
but 18
i 18
stay 18
silent 18
were 18
going 18
to 18
fight 18
youre 18
going 18
to 18
be 18
as 18
useful 18
to 18
the 18
war 18
effort 18
as 18
possible 18
plutarch 18
says 18
and 18
its 18
been 18
decided 18
that 18
you 18
are 18
of 18
most 18
value 18
on 18
television 18
just 18
look 18
at 18
the 18
effect 18
katniss 18
had 18
running 18
around 18
in 18
that 18
mockingjay 18
suit 18
turned 18
the 18
whole 18
rebellion 18
around 18
do 18
you 18
notice 18
how 18
shes 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
not 18
complaining 18
its 18
because 18
she 18
understands 18
the 18
power 18
of 18
that 18
screen 18
actually 18
katniss 18
isnt 18
complaining 18
because 18
she 18
has 18
no 18
intention 18
of 18
staying 18
with 18
the 18
star 18
squad 18
but 18
she 18
recognizes 18
the 18
necessity 18
of 18
getting 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
before 18
carrying 18
out 18
any 18
plan 18
still 18
to 18
be 18
too 18
compliant 18
may 18
arouse 18
suspicion 18
as 18
well 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
all 18
pretend 18
is 18
it 18
i 18
ask 18
thatd 18
be 18
a 18
waste 18
of 18
talent 18
dont 18
worry 18
plutarch 18
tells 18
me 18
youll 18
have 18
plenty 18
of 18
real 18
targets 18
to 18
hit 18
but 18
dont 18
get 18
blown 18
up 18
ive 18
got 18
enough 18
on 18
my 18
plate 18
without 18
having 18
to 18
replace 18
you 18
now 18
get 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
put 18
on 18
a 18
good 18
show 18
the 18
morning 18
we 18
ship 18
out 18
i 18
say 18
goodbye 18
to 18
my 18
family 18
i 18
havent 18
told 18
them 18
how 18
much 18
the 18
capitols 18
defenses 18
mirror 18
the 18
weapons 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
but 18
my 18
going 18
off 18
to 18
war 18

long 18
time 18
i 18
feel 18
tears 18
on 18
her 18
cheek 18
something 18
she 18
suppressed 18
when 18
i 18
was 18
slated 18
for 18
the 18
games 18

reassure 18
her 18
prim 18

arms 18
around 18
my 18
neck 18

saying 18
a 18
final 18
goodbye 18
to 18
peeta 18
decide 18
it 18
would 18
only 18
be 18
bad 18
for 18
both 18
of 18
us 18

i 18

slip 18
the 18

secured 18
for 18
over 18
a 18
week 18
rebels 18
pushed 18
out 18
the 18

losing 18
hundreds 18
of 18
lives 18
in 18
the 18
process 18
the 18
capitol 18
forces 18
fell 18
back 18

have 18
regrouped 18
farther 18
into 18
the 18

us 18
lie 18
the 18
boobytrapped 18

empty 18

inviting 18
each 18

do 18
feel 18
very 18
naked 18
pitched 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
openbut 18
boggs 18
says 18
its 18
not 18
an 18
issue 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
capitols 18
air 18
fleet 18
was 18
destroyed 18
in 18
or 18
during 18
the 18
invasion 18
if 18
it 18
has 18
any 18
craft 18
left 18
its 18
holding 18
on 18
to 18
them 18
probably 18
so 18
snow 18
and 18
his 18
inner 18
circle 18
can 18
make 18
a 18
lastminute 18
escape 18
to 18
some 18
presidential 18
bunker 18
somewhere 18
if 18
needed 18
our 18
own 18
hoverplanes 18
were 18
grounded 18
after 18
the 18
capitols 18
antiaircraft 18
missiles 18
decimated 18
the 18
first 18
few 18
waves 18
this 18
war 18
will 18
be 18
battled 18
out 18
on 18
the 18
streets 18
with 18
hopefully 18
only 18
superficial 18
damage 18
to 18
the 18
infrastructure 18
and 18
a 18
minimum 18
of 18
human 18
casualties 18
the 18
rebels 18
want 18
the 18
capitol 18
just 18
as 18
the 18
capitol 18
wanted 18
after 18
three 18
days 18
much 18
of 18
squad 18
risks 18
deserting 18
out 18
of 18
boredom 18
cressida 18
and 18
her 18
team 18
take 18
shots 18
of 18
us 18
firing 18
they 18
tell 18
us 18
were 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
disinformation 18
team 18
if 18
the 18
rebels 18
only 18
shoot 18
plutarchs 18
pods 18
it 18
will 18
take 18
the 18
capitol 18
about 18
two 18
minutes 18
to 18
realize 18
we 18
have 18
the 18
holograph 18
so 18
theres 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
time 18
spent 18
shattering 18
things 18
that 18
dont 18
matter 18
to 18
throw 18
them 18
off 18
the 18
scent 18
mostly 18
we 18
just 18
add 18
to 18
the 18
piles 18
of 18
rainbow 18
glass 18
thats 18
been 18
blown 18
off 18
the 18
exteriors 18
of 18
the 18
candycolored 18
buildings 18
i 18
suspect 18
they 18
are 18
intercutting 18
this 18
footage 18
with 18
the 18
destruction 18
of 18
significant 18
capitol 18
targets 18
once 18
in 18
a 18
while 18
it 18
seems 18
a 18
real 18
sharpshooters 18
services 18
are 18
needed 18
eight 18
hands 18
go 18
up 18
but 18
gale 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
are 18
never 18
chosen 18
its 18
your 18
own 18
fault 18
for 18
being 18
so 18
cameraready 18
i 18
tell 18
gale 18
if 18
looks 18
could 18
kill 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
they 18
quite 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
the 18
three 18
of 18
us 18
particularly 18
me 18
i 18
have 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
outfit 18
with 18
me 18
but 18
ive 18
only 18
been 18
taped 18
in 18
my 18
uniform 18
sometimes 18
i 18
use 18
a 18
gun 18
sometimes 18
they 18
ask 18
me 18
to 18
shoot 18
with 18
my 18
bow 18
and 18
arrows 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
they 18
dont 18
want 18
to 18
entirely 18
lose 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
but 18
they 18
want 18
to 18
downgrade 18
my 18
role 18
to 18
foot 18
soldier 18
since 18
i 18
dont 18
care 18
its 18
amusing 18
rather 18
than 18
upsetting 18
to 18
imagine 18
the 18
arguments 18
going 18
on 18
back 18
in 18
while 18
i 18
outwardly 18
express 18
discontent 18
about 18
our 18
lack 18
of 18
any 18
real 18
participation 18
im 18
busy 18
with 18
my 18
own 18
agenda 18
each 18
of 18
us 18
has 18
a 18
paper 18
map 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
the 18
city 18
forms 18
an 18
almost 18
perfect 18
square 18
lines 18
divide 18
the 18
map 18
into 18
smaller 18
squares 18
with 18
letters 18
along 18
the 18
top 18
and 18
numbers 18
down 18
the 18
side 18
to 18
form 18
a 18
grid 18
i 18
consume 18
this 18
noting 18
every 18
intersection 18
and 18
side 18
street 18
but 18
its 18
remedial 18
stuff 18
the 18
commanders 18
here 18
are 18
working 18
off 18
plutarchs 18
holograph 18
each 18
has 18
a 18
handheld 18
contraption 18
called 18
a 18
holo 18
that 18
produces 18
images 18
like 18
i 18
saw 18
in 18
command 18
they 18
can 18
zoom 18
into 18
any 18
area 18
of 18
the 18
grid 18
and 18
see 18
what 18
pods 18
await 18
them 18
the 18
holos 18
an 18
independent 18
unit 18
a 18
glorified 18
map 18
really 18
since 18
it 18
can 18
neither 18
send 18
nor 18
receive 18
signals 18
but 18
its 18
far 18
superior 18
to 18
my 18
paper 18
version 18
a 18
holo 18
is 18
activated 18
by 18
a 18
specific 18
commanders 18
voice 18
giving 18
his 18
or 18
her 18
name 18
once 18
its 18
working 18
it 18
responds 18
to 18
the 18
other 18
voices 18
in 18
the 18
squadron 18
so 18
if 18
say 18
boggs 18
were 18
killed 18
or 18
severely 18
disabled 18
someone 18
could 18
take 18
over 18
if 18
anyone 18
in 18
the 18
squad 18
repeats 18
nightlock 18
three 18
times 18
in 18
a 18
row 18
the 18
holo 18
will 18
explode 18
blowing 18
everything 18
in 18
a 18
fiveyard 18
radius 18
skyhigh 18
this 18
is 18
for 18
security 18
reasons 18
in 18
the 18
event 18
of 18
capture 18
its 18
understood 18
that 18
we 18
would 18
all 18
do 18
this 18
without 18
hesitation 18
so 18
what 18
i 18
need 18
to 18
do 18
is 18
steal 18
boggss 18
activated 18
holo 18
and 18
clear 18
out 18
before 18
he 18
notices 18
i 18
think 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
easier 18
to 18
steal 18
his 18
teeth 18
on 18
the 18
fourth 18
morning 18
soldier 18
leeg 18
hits 18
a 18
mislabeled 18
pod 18
it 18
doesnt 18
unleash 18
a 18
swarm 18
of 18
muttation 18
gnats 18
which 18
the 18
rebels 18
are 18
prepared 18
for 18
but 18
shoots 18
out 18
a 18
sunburst 18
of 18
metal 18
darts 18
one 18
finds 18
her 18
brain 18
shes 18
gone 18
before 18
the 18
medics 18
can 18
reach 18
her 18
plutarch 18
promises 18
a 18
speedy 18
replacement 18
the 18
following 18
evening 18
the 18
newest 18
member 18
of 18
our 18
squad 18
arrives 18
with 18
no 18
manacles 18
no 18
guards 18
strolling 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
train 18
station 18
with 18
his 18
gun 18
swinging 18
from 18
the 18
strap 18
over 18
his 18
shoulder 18
theres 18
shock 18
confusion 18
resistance 18
but 18
is 18
stamped 18
on 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
peetas 18
hand 18
in 18
fresh 18
ink 18
boggs 18
relieves 18
him 18
of 18
his 18
weapon 18
and 18
goes 18
to 18
make 18
a 18
call 18
it 18
wont 18
matter 18
peeta 18
tells 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
the 18
president 18
assigned 18
me 18
herself 18
she 18
decided 18
the 18
propos 18
needed 18
some 18
heating 18
up 18
maybe 18
they 18
do 18
but 18
if 18
coin 18
sent 18
peeta 18
here 18
shes 18
decided 18
something 18
else 18
as 18
well 18
that 18
im 18
of 18
more 18
use 18
to 18
her 18
dead 18
than 18
alive 18
part 18
iii 18
the 18
assassin 18
ive 18
never 18
really 18
seen 18
boggs 18
angry 18
before 18
not 18
when 18
ive 18
disobeyed 18
his 18
orders 18
or 18
puked 18
on 18
him 18
not 18
even 18
when 18
gale 18
broke 18
his 18
nose 18
but 18
hes 18
angry 18
when 18
he 18
returns 18
from 18
his 18
phone 18
call 18
with 18
the 18
president 18
the 18
first 18
thing 18
he 18
does 18
is 18
instruct 18
soldier 18
jackson 18
his 18
second 18
in 18
command 18
to 18
set 18
up 18
a 18
twoperson 18
roundtheclock 18
guard 18
on 18
peeta 18
then 18
he 18
takes 18
me 18
on 18
a 18
walk 18
weaving 18
through 18
the 18
sprawling 18
tent 18
encampment 18
until 18
our 18
squad 18
is 18
far 18
behind 18
us 18
hell 18
try 18
and 18
kill 18
me 18
anyway 18
i 18
say 18
especially 18
here 18
where 18
there 18
are 18
so 18
many 18
bad 18
memories 18
to 18

but 18
we 18
know 18
its 18
true 18
i 18
say 18
and 18
you 18
must 18
at 18
least 18
have 18
a 18
theory 18
boggs 18
gives 18
me 18
a 18
long 18
hard 18
look 18
before 18

much 18
as 18
i 18

the 18
president 18
doesnt 18
like 18
you 18
she 18
never 18
did 18
it 18
was 18
peeta 18
she 18
wanted 18
rescued 18
from 18
the 18
arena 18
but 18
no 18
one 18
else 18
agreed 18
it 18
made 18
matters 18
worse 18
when 18
you 18
forced 18
her 18
to 18
give 18
the 18
other 18
victors 18
immunity 18
but 18
even 18
that 18
could 18
be 18
overlooked 18
in 18
view 18
of 18
how 18
well 18
youve 18
performed 18
then 18
what 18
is 18
it 18
i 18
insist 18
sometime 18
in 18
the 18
near 18
future 18
this 18
war 18
will 18
be 18
resolved 18
a 18
new 18
leader 18
will 18
be 18
chosen 18
says 18
boggs 18
i 18
roll 18
my 18
eyes 18
boggs 18
no 18
one 18
thinks 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
leader 18
no 18
they 18
dont 18
he 18
agrees 18
but 18
youll 18
throw 18
support 18
to 18
someone 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
president 18
coin 18
or 18
someone 18
else 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
ive 18
never 18
thought 18
about 18
it 18
i 18
say 18
if 18
your 18
immediate 18
answer 18
isnt 18
coin 18
then 18
youre 18
a 18
threat 18
youre 18
the 18
face 18
of 18
the 18
rebellion 18
you 18
may 18
have 18
more 18
influence 18
than 18
any 18
other 18
single 18
person 18
says 18
boggs 18
outwardly 18
the 18
most 18
youve 18
ever 18
done 18
is 18
tolerated 18
her 18
so 18
shell 18
kill 18
me 18
to 18
shut 18
me 18
up 18
the 18
minute 18
i 18
say 18
the 18
words 18
i 18
know 18
theyre 18
true 18
she 18
doesnt 18
need 18
you 18
as 18
a 18
rallying 18
point 18
now 18
as 18
she 18
said 18
your 18
primary 18
objective 18
to 18
unite 18
the 18
districts 18
has 18
succeeded 18
boggs 18
reminds 18
me 18
these 18
current 18
propos 18
could 18
be 18
done 18
without 18
you 18
theres 18
only 18
one 18
last 18
thing 18
you 18
could 18
do 18
to 18
add 18
fire 18
to 18
the 18
rebellion 18
die 18
i 18
say 18
quietly 18
yes 18
give 18
us 18
a 18
martyr 18
to 18
fight 18
for 18
says 18
boggs 18
but 18
thats 18
not 18
going 18
to 18
happen 18
under 18
my 18
watch 18
soldier 18
everdeen 18
im 18
planning 18
for 18
you 18
to 18
have 18
a 18
long 18
life 18
why 18
this 18
kind 18
of 18
thinking 18
will 18
only 18
bring 18
him 18
trouble 18
you 18
dont 18
owe 18
me 18
anything 18
because 18
youve 18
earned 18
it 18
he 18
says 18
now 18
get 18
back 18
to 18
your 18
squad 18
i 18
know 18
i 18
should 18
feel 18
appreciative 18
of 18
boggs 18
sticking 18
his 18
neck 18
out 18
for 18
me 18
but 18
really 18
im 18
just 18
frustrated 18
i 18
mean 18
how 18
can 18
i 18
steal 18
his 18
holo 18
and 18
desert 18
now 18
betraying 18
him 18
was 18
complicated 18
enough 18
without 18
this 18
whole 18
new 18
layer 18
of 18
debt 18
i 18
already 18
owe 18
him 18
for 18
saving 18
my 18
life 18
seeing 18
the 18
cause 18
of 18
my 18
current 18
dilemma 18
calmly 18
pitching 18
his 18
tent 18
back 18
at 18
our 18
site 18
makes 18
me 18
furious 18
what 18
time 18
is 18
my 18
watch 18
i 18
ask 18
jackson 18
she 18
squints 18
at 18
me 18
in 18
doubt 18
or 18
maybe 18
shes 18
just 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
my 18
face 18
in 18
focus 18
i 18
didnt 18
put 18
you 18
in 18
the 18
rotation 18
why 18
not 18
i 18
ask 18
im 18
not 18
sure 18
you 18
could 18
really 18
shoot 18
peeta 18
if 18
it 18
came 18
to 18
it 18
she 18
says 18
i 18
speak 18
up 18
so 18
the 18
whole 18
squad 18
can 18
hear 18
me 18
clearly 18
i 18
wouldnt 18
be 18
shooting 18
peeta 18
hes 18
gone 18
johannas 18
right 18
itd 18
be 18
just 18
like 18
shooting 18
another 18
of 18
the 18
capitols 18
mutts 18
it 18
feels 18
good 18
to 18
say 18
something 18
horrible 18
about 18
him 18
out 18
loud 18
in 18
public 18
after 18
all 18
the 18
humiliation 18
ive 18
felt 18
since 18
his 18
return 18
well 18
that 18
sort 18
of 18
comment 18
isnt 18
recommending 18
you 18
either 18
says 18
jackson 18
put 18
her 18
in 18
the 18
rotation 18
i 18
hear 18
boggs 18
say 18
behind 18
me 18
jackson 18
shakes 18
her 18
head 18
and 18
makes 18
a 18
note 18
midnight 18
to 18
four 18
youre 18
on 18
with 18
me 18
the 18
dinner 18
whistle 18
sounds 18
and 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
line 18
up 18
at 18
the 18
canteen 18
do 18
you 18
want 18
me 18
to 18
kill 18
him 18
he 18
asks 18
bluntly 18
thatll 18
get 18
us 18
both 18
sent 18
back 18
for 18
sure 18
i 18
say 18
but 18
even 18
though 18
im 18
furious 18
the 18
brutality 18
of 18
the 18
offer 18
rattles 18
me 18
i 18
can 18
deal 18
with 18
him 18
you 18
mean 18
until 18
you 18
take 18
off 18
you 18
and 18
your 18
paper 18
map 18
and 18
possibly 18
a 18
holo 18
if 18
you 18
can 18
get 18
your 18
hands 18
on 18
it 18
so 18
gale 18
has 18
not 18
missed 18
my 18
preparations 18
i 18
hope 18
they 18
havent 18
been 18
so 18
obvious 18
to 18
the 18
others 18
none 18
of 18
them 18
know 18
my 18
mind 18
like 18
he 18
does 18
though 18
youre 18
not 18
planning 18
on 18
leaving 18
me 18
behind 18
are 18
you 18
he 18
asks 18
up 18
until 18
this 18
point 18
i 18
was 18
but 18
having 18
my 18
hunting 18
partner 18
to 18
watch 18
my 18
back 18
doesnt 18
sound 18
like 18
a 18
bad 18
idea 18
as 18
your 18
fellow 18
soldier 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
strongly 18
recommend 18
you 18
stay 18
with 18
your 18
squad 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
stop 18
you 18
from 18
coming 18
can 18
i 18
he 18
grins 18
no 18
not 18
unless 18
you 18
want 18
me 18
to 18
alert 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
army 18
squad 18
and 18
the 18
television 18
crew 18
collect 18
dinner 18
from 18
the 18
canteen 18
and 18
gather 18
in 18
a 18
tense 18
circle 18
to 18
eat 18
at 18
first 18
i 18
think 18
that 18
peeta 18
is 18
the 18
cause 18
of 18
the 18
unease 18
but 18
by 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
meal 18
i 18
realize 18
more 18
than 18
a 18
few 18
unfriendly 18
looks 18
have 18
been 18
directed 18
my 18
way 18
this 18
is 18
a 18
quick 18
turnaround 18
since 18
im 18
pretty 18
sure 18
when 18
peeta 18
appeared 18
the 18
whole 18
team 18
was 18
concerned 18
about 18
how 18
dangerous 18
he 18
might 18
be 18
especially 18
to 18
me 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
until 18
i 18
get 18
a 18
phone 18
call 18
through 18
to 18
haymitch 18
that 18
i 18
understand 18
what 18
are 18
you 18
trying 18
to 18
do 18
provoke 18
him 18
into 18
an 18
attack 18
he 18
asks 18
me 18
of 18
course 18
not 18
i 18
just 18
want 18
him 18
to 18
leave 18
me 18
alone 18
i 18
say 18
well 18
he 18
cant 18
not 18
after 18
what 18
the 18
capitol 18
put 18
him 18
through 18
says 18
haymitch 18
look 18
coin 18
may 18
have 18
sent 18
him 18
there 18
hoping 18
hed 18
kill 18
you 18
but 18
peeta 18
doesnt 18
know 18
that 18
he 18
doesnt 18
understand 18
whats 18
happened 18
to 18
him 18
so 18
you 18
cant 18
blame 18
him 18
i 18
dont 18
i 18
say 18
you 18
do 18
youre 18
punishing 18
him 18
over 18
and 18
over 18
for 18
things 18
that 18
are 18
out 18
of 18
his 18
control 18
now 18
im 18
not 18
saying 18
you 18
shouldnt 18
have 18
a 18
fully 18
loaded 18
weapon 18
next 18
to 18
you 18
round 18
the 18
clock 18
but 18
i 18
think 18
its 18
time 18
you 18
flipped 18
this 18
little 18
scenario 18
around 18
in 18
your 18
head 18
if 18
youd 18
been 18
taken 18
by 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
hijacked 18
and 18
then 18
tried 18
to 18
kill 18
peeta 18
is 18
this 18
the 18
way 18
he 18
would 18
be 18
treating 18
you 18
demands 18
haymitch 18
i 18
fall 18
silent 18
it 18
isnt 18
it 18
isnt 18
how 18
he 18
would 18
be 18
treating 18
me 18
at 18
all 18
he 18
would 18
be 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
me 18
back 18
at 18
any 18
cost 18
not 18
shutting 18
me 18
out 18
abandoning 18
me 18
greeting 18
me 18
with 18
hostility 18
at 18
every 18
turn 18
you 18
and 18
me 18
we 18
made 18
a 18
deal 18
to 18
try 18
and 18
save 18
him 18
remember 18
haymitch 18
says 18
when 18
i 18
dont 18
respond 18
he 18
disconnects 18
after 18
a 18
curt 18
try 18
and 18
remember 18
the 18
autumn 18
day 18
turns 18
from 18
brisk 18
to 18
cold 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
squad 18
hunker 18
down 18
in 18
their 18
sleeping 18
bags 18
some 18
sleep 18
under 18
the 18
open 18
sky 18
close 18
to 18
the 18
heater 18
in 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
our 18
camp 18
while 18
others 18
retreat 18
to 18
their 18
tents 18
leeg 18
has 18
finally 18
broken 18
down 18
over 18
her 18
sisters 18
death 18
and 18
her 18
muffled 18
sobs 18
reach 18
us 18
through 18
the 18
canvas 18
i 18
huddle 18
in 18
my 18
tent 18
thinking 18
over 18
haymitchs 18
words 18
realizing 18
with 18
shame 18
that 18
my 18
fixation 18
with 18
assassinating 18
snow 18
has 18
allowed 18
me 18
to 18
ignore 18
a 18
much 18
more 18
difficult 18
problem 18
trying 18
to 18
rescue 18
peeta 18
from 18
the 18
shadowy 18
world 18
the 18
hijacking 18
has 18
stranded 18
him 18
in 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
how 18
to 18
find 18
him 18
let 18
alone 18
lead 18
him 18
out 18
i 18
cant 18
even 18
conceive 18
of 18
a 18
plan 18
it 18
makes 18
the 18
task 18
of 18
crossing 18
a 18
loaded 18
arena 18
locating 18
snow 18
and 18
putting 18
a 18
bullet 18
through 18
his 18
head 18
look 18
like 18
childs 18
play 18
at 18
midnight 18
i 18
crawl 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
tent 18
and 18
position 18
myself 18
on 18
a 18
camp 18
stool 18
near 18
the 18
heater 18
to 18
take 18
my 18
watch 18
with 18
jackson 18
boggs 18
told 18
peeta 18
to 18
sleep 18
out 18
in 18
full 18
view 18
where 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
could 18
keep 18
an 18
eye 18
on 18
him 18
he 18
isnt 18
sleeping 18
though 18
instead 18
he 18
sits 18
with 18
his 18
bag 18
pulled 18
up 18
to 18
his 18
chest 18
clumsily 18
trying 18
to 18
make 18
knots 18
in 18
a 18
short 18
length 18
of 18
rope 18
i 18
know 18
it 18
well 18
its 18
the 18
one 18
finnick 18
lent 18
me 18
that 18
night 18
in 18
the 18
bunker 18
seeing 18
it 18
in 18
his 18
hands 18
its 18
like 18
finnicks 18
echoing 18
what 18
haymitch 18
just 18
said 18
that 18
ive 18
cast 18
off 18
peeta 18
now 18
might 18
be 18
a 18
good 18
time 18
to 18
begin 18
to 18
remedy 18
that 18
if 18
i 18
could 18
think 18
of 18
something 18
to 18
say 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
so 18
i 18
dont 18
i 18
just 18
let 18
the 18
sounds 18
of 18
soldiers 18
breathing 18
fill 18
the 18
night 18
after 18
about 18
an 18
hour 18
peeta 18
speaks 18
up 18
these 18
last 18
couple 18
of 18
years 18
must 18
have 18
been 18
exhausting 18
for 18
you 18
trying 18
to 18
decide 18
whether 18
to 18
kill 18
me 18
or 18
not 18
back 18
and 18
forth 18
back 18
and 18
forth 18
that 18
seems 18
grossly 18
unfair 18
and 18
my 18
first 18
impulse 18
is 18
to 18
say 18
something 18
cutting 18
but 18
i 18
revisit 18
my 18
conversation 18
with 18
haymitch 18
and 18
try 18
to 18
take 18
the 18
first 18
tentative 18
step 18
in 18
peetas 18
direction 18
i 18
never 18
wanted 18
to 18
kill 18
you 18
except 18
when 18
i 18
thought 18
you 18
were 18
helping 18
the 18
careers 18
kill 18
me 18
after 18
that 18
i 18
always 18
thought 18
of 18
you 18
asan 18
ally 18
thats 18
a 18
good 18
safe 18
word 18
empty 18
of 18
any 18
emotional 18
obligation 18
but 18
nonthreatening 18
ally 18
peeta 18
says 18
the 18
word 18
slowly 18
tasting 18
it 18
friend 18
lover 18
victor 18
enemy 18
fiancee 18
target 18
mutt 18
neighbor 18
hunter 18
tribute 18
ally 18
ill 18
add 18
it 18
to 18
the 18
list 18
of 18
words 18
i 18
use 18
to 18
try 18
to 18
figure 18
you 18
out 18
he 18
weaves 18
the 18
rope 18
in 18
and 18
out 18
of 18
his 18
fingers 18
the 18
problem 18
is 18
i 18
cant 18
tell 18
whats 18
real 18
anymore 18
and 18
whats 18
made 18
up 18
the 18
cessation 18
of 18
rhythmic 18
breathing 18
suggests 18
that 18
either 18
people 18
have 18
woken 18
or 18
have 18
never 18
really 18
been 18
asleep 18
at 18
all 18
i 18
suspect 18
the 18
latter 18
finnicks 18
voice 18
rises 18
from 18
a 18
bundle 18
in 18
the 18
shadows 18
then 18
you 18
should 18
ask 18
peeta 18
thats 18
what 18
annie 18
does 18
ask 18
who 18
peeta 18
says 18
who 18
can 18
i 18
trust 18
well 18
us 18
for 18
starters 18
were 18
your 18
squad 18
says 18
jackson 18
youre 18
my 18
guards 18
he 18
points 18
out 18
that 18
too 18
she 18
says 18
but 18
you 18
saved 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
lives 18
in 18
thirteen 18
its 18
not 18
the 18
kind 18
of 18
thing 18
we 18
forget 18
in 18
the 18
quiet 18
that 18
follows 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
imagine 18
not 18
being 18
able 18
to 18
tell 18
illusion 18
from 18
reality 18
not 18
knowing 18
if 18
prim 18
or 18
my 18
mother 18
loved 18
me 18
if 18
snow 18
was 18
my 18
enemy 18
if 18
the 18
person 18
across 18
the 18
heater 18
saved 18
or 18
sacrificed 18
me 18
with 18
very 18
little 18
effort 18
my 18
life 18
rapidly 18
morphs 18
into 18
a 18
nightmare 18
i 18
suddenly 18
want 18
to 18
tell 18
peeta 18
everything 18
about 18
who 18
he 18
is 18
and 18
who 18
i 18
am 18
and 18
how 18
we 18
ended 18
up 18
here 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
how 18
to 18
start 18
worthless 18
im 18
worthless 18
at 18
a 18
few 18
minutes 18
before 18
four 18
peeta 18
turns 18
to 18
me 18
again 18
your 18
favorite 18
colorits 18
green 18
thats 18
right 18
then 18
i 18
think 18
of 18
something 18
to 18
add 18
and 18
yours 18
is 18
orange 18
orange 18
he 18
seems 18
unconvinced 18
not 18
bright 18
orange 18
but 18
soft 18
like 18
the 18
sunset 18
i 18
say 18
at 18
least 18
thats 18
what 18
you 18
told 18
me 18
once 18
oh 18
he 18
closes 18
his 18
eyes 18
briefly 18
maybe 18
trying 18
to 18
conjure 18
up 18
that 18
sunset 18
then 18
nods 18
his 18
head 18
thank 18
you 18
but 18
more 18
words 18
tumble 18
out 18
youre 18
a 18
painter 18
youre 18
a 18
baker 18
you 18
like 18
to 18
sleep 18
with 18
the 18
windows 18
open 18
you 18
never 18
take 18
sugar 18
in 18
your 18
tea 18
and 18
you 18
always 18
doubleknot 18
your 18
shoelaces 18
then 18
i 18
dive 18
into 18
my 18
tent 18
before 18
i 18
do 18
something 18
stupid 18
like 18
cry 18
in 18
the 18
morning 18
gale 18
finnick 18
and 18
i 18
go 18
out 18
to 18
shoot 18
some 18
glass 18
off 18
the 18
buildings 18
for 18
the 18
camera 18
crew 18
when 18
we 18
get 18
back 18
to 18
camp 18
peetas 18
sitting 18
in 18
a 18
circle 18
with 18
the 18
soldiers 18
from 18
who 18
are 18
armed 18
but 18
talking 18
openly 18
with 18
him 18
jackson 18
has 18
devised 18
a 18
game 18
called 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
to 18
help 18
peeta 18
he 18
mentions 18
something 18
he 18
thinks 18
happened 18
and 18
they 18
tell 18
him 18
if 18
its 18
true 18
or 18
imagined 18
usually 18
followed 18
by 18
a 18
brief 18
explanation 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
people 18
from 18
twelve 18
were 18
killed 18
in 18
the 18
fire 18
real 18
less 18
than 18
nine 18
hundred 18
of 18
you 18
made 18
it 18
to 18
thirteen 18
alive 18
the 18
fire 18
was 18
my 18
fault 18
not 18
real 18
president 18
snow 18
destroyed 18
twelve 18
the 18
way 18
he 18
did 18
thirteen 18
to 18
send 18
a 18
message 18
to 18
the 18
rebels 18
this 18
seems 18
like 18
a 18
good 18
idea 18
until 18
i 18
realize 18
that 18
ill 18
be 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
who 18
can 18
confirm 18
or 18
deny 18
most 18
of 18
what 18
weighs 18
on 18
him 18
jackson 18
breaks 18
us 18
up 18
into 18
watches 18
she 18
matches 18
up 18
finnick 18
gale 18
and 18
me 18
each 18
with 18
a 18
soldier 18
from 18
this 18
way 18
peeta 18
will 18
always 18
have 18
access 18
to 18
someone 18
who 18
knows 18
him 18
more 18
personally 18
its 18
not 18
a 18
steady 18
conversation 18
peeta 18
spends 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
considering 18
even 18
small 18
pieces 18
of 18
information 18
like 18
where 18
people 18
bought 18
their 18
soap 18
back 18
home 18
gale 18
fills 18
him 18
in 18
on 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
stuff 18
about 18
finnick 18
is 18
the 18
expert 18
on 18
both 18
of 18
peetas 18
games 18
as 18
he 18
was 18
a 18
mentor 18
in 18
the 18
first 18
and 18
a 18
tribute 18
in 18
the 18
second 18
but 18
since 18
peetas 18
greatest 18
confusion 18
centers 18
around 18
meand 18
not 18
everything 18
can 18
be 18
explained 18
simplyour 18
exchanges 18
are 18
painful 18
and 18
loaded 18
even 18
though 18
we 18
touch 18
on 18
only 18
the 18
most 18
superficial 18
of 18
details 18
the 18
color 18
of 18
my 18
dress 18
in 18
my 18
preference 18
for 18
cheese 18
buns 18
the 18
name 18
of 18
our 18
math 18
teacher 18
when 18
we 18
were 18
little 18
reconstructing 18
his 18
memory 18
of 18
me 18
is 18
excruciating 18
perhaps 18
it 18
isnt 18
even 18
possible 18
after 18
what 18
snow 18
did 18
to 18
him 18
but 18
it 18
does 18
feel 18
right 18
to 18
help 18
him 18
try 18
the 18
next 18
afternoon 18
were 18
notified 18
that 18
the 18
whole 18
squad 18
is 18
needed 18
to 18
stage 18
a 18
fairly 18
complicated 18
propo 18
peetas 18
been 18
right 18
about 18
one 18
thing 18
coin 18
and 18
plutarch 18
are 18
unhappy 18
with 18
the 18
quality 18
of 18
footage 18
theyre 18
getting 18
from 18
the 18
star 18
squad 18
very 18
dull 18
very 18
uninspiring 18
the 18
obvious 18
response 18
is 18
that 18
they 18
never 18
let 18
us 18
do 18
anything 18
but 18
playact 18
with 18
our 18
guns 18
however 18
this 18
is 18
not 18
about 18
defending 18
ourselves 18
its 18
about 18
coming 18
up 18
with 18
a 18
usable 18
product 18
so 18
today 18
a 18
special 18
block 18
has 18
been 18
set 18
aside 18
for 18
filming 18
it 18
even 18
has 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
active 18
pods 18
on 18
it 18
one 18
unleashes 18
a 18
spray 18
of 18
gunfire 18
the 18
other 18
nets 18
the 18
invader 18
and 18
traps 18
them 18
for 18
either 18
interrogation 18
or 18
execution 18
depending 18
on 18
the 18
captors 18
preference 18
but 18
its 18
still 18
an 18
unimportant 18
residential 18
block 18
with 18
nothing 18
of 18
strategic 18
consequence 18
the 18
television 18
crew 18
means 18
to 18
provide 18
a 18
sense 18
of 18
heightened 18
jeopardy 18
by 18
releasing 18
smoke 18
bombs 18
and 18
adding 18
gunfire 18
sound 18
effects 18
we 18
suit 18
up 18
in 18
heavy 18
protective 18
gear 18
even 18
the 18
crew 18
as 18
if 18
were 18
heading 18
into 18
the 18
heart 18
of 18
battle 18
those 18
of 18
us 18
with 18
specialty 18
weapons 18
are 18
allowed 18
to 18
take 18
them 18
along 18
with 18
our 18
guns 18
boggs 18
gives 18
peeta 18
back 18
his 18
gun 18
too 18
although 18
he 18
makes 18
sure 18
to 18
tell 18
him 18
in 18
a 18
loud 18
voice 18
that 18
its 18
only 18
loaded 18
with 18
blanks 18
peeta 18
just 18
shrugs 18
im 18
not 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
shot 18
anyway 18
he 18
seems 18
preoccupied 18
with 18
watching 18
pollux 18
to 18
the 18
point 18
where 18
its 18
getting 18
a 18
little 18
worrisome 18
when 18
he 18
finally 18
puzzles 18
it 18
out 18
and 18
begins 18
to 18
speak 18
with 18
agitation 18
youre 18
an 18
avox 18
arent 18
you 18
i 18
can 18
tell 18
by 18
the 18
way 18
you 18
swallow 18
there 18
were 18
two 18
avoxes 18
with 18
me 18
in 18
prison 18
darius 18
and 18
lavinia 18
but 18
the 18
guards 18
mostly 18
called 18
them 18
the 18
redheads 18
theyd 18
been 18
our 18
servants 18
in 18
the 18
training 18
center 18
so 18
they 18
arrested 18
them 18
too 18
i 18
watched 18
them 18
being 18
tortured 18
to 18
death 18
she 18
was 18
lucky 18
they 18
used 18
too 18
much 18
voltage 18
and 18
her 18
heart 18
stopped 18
right 18
off 18
it 18
took 18
days 18
to 18
finish 18
him 18
off 18
beating 18
cutting 18
off 18
parts 18
they 18
kept 18
asking 18
him 18
questions 18
but 18
he 18
couldnt 18
speak 18
he 18
just 18
made 18
these 18
horrible 18
animal 18
sounds 18
they 18
didnt 18
want 18
information 18
you 18
know 18
they 18
wanted 18
me 18
to 18
see 18
it 18
peeta 18
looks 18
around 18
at 18
our 18
stunned 18
faces 18
as 18
if 18
waiting 18
for 18
a 18
reply 18
when 18
none 18
is 18
forthcoming 18
he 18
asks 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
the 18
lack 18
of 18
response 18
upsets 18
him 18
more 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
he 18
demands 18
real 18
says 18
boggs 18
at 18
least 18
to 18
the 18
best 18
of 18
my 18
knowledgereal 18
peeta 18
sags 18
i 18
thought 18
so 18
there 18
was 18
nothingshiny 18
about 18
it 18
he 18
wanders 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
group 18
muttering 18
something 18
about 18
fingers 18
and 18
toes 18
i 18
move 18
to 18
gale 18
press 18
my 18
forehead 18
into 18
the 18
body 18
armor 18
where 18
his 18
chest 18
should 18
be 18
feel 18
his 18
arm 18
tighten 18
around 18
me 18
we 18
finally 18
know 18
the 18
name 18
of 18
the 18
girl 18
who 18
we 18
watched 18
the 18
capitol 18
abduct 18
from 18
the 18
woods 18
of 18
the 18
fate 18
of 18
the 18
peacekeeper 18
friend 18
who 18
tried 18
to 18
keep 18
gale 18
alive 18
this 18
is 18
no 18
time 18
to 18
call 18
up 18
happy 18
moments 18
of 18
remembrance 18
they 18
lost 18
their 18
lives 18
because 18
of 18
me 18
i 18
add 18
them 18
to 18
my 18
personal 18
list 18
of 18
kills 18
that 18
began 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
and 18
now 18
includes 18
thousands 18
when 18
i 18
look 18
up 18
i 18
see 18
it 18
has 18
taken 18
gale 18
differently 18
his 18
expression 18
says 18
that 18
there 18
are 18
not 18
enough 18
mountains 18
to 18
crush 18
enough 18
cities 18
to 18
destroy 18
it 18
promises 18
death 18
with 18
peetas 18
grisly 18
account 18
fresh 18
in 18
our 18
minds 18
we 18
crunch 18
through 18
the 18
streets 18
of 18
broken 18
glass 18
until 18
we 18
reach 18
our 18
target 18
the 18
block 18
we 18
are 18
to 18
take 18
it 18
is 18
a 18
real 18
if 18
small 18
goal 18
to 18
accomplish 18
we 18
gather 18
around 18
boggs 18
to 18
examine 18
the 18
holo 18
projection 18
of 18
the 18
street 18
the 18
gunfire 18
pod 18
is 18
positioned 18
about 18
a 18
third 18
of 18
the 18
way 18
down 18
just 18
above 18
an 18
apartment 18
awning 18
we 18
should 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
trigger 18
it 18
with 18
bullets 18
the 18
net 18
pod 18
is 18
at 18
the 18
far 18
end 18
almost 18
the 18
next 18
corner 18
this 18
will 18
require 18
someone 18
to 18
set 18
off 18
the 18
body 18
sensor 18
mechanism 18
everyone 18
volunteers 18
except 18
peeta 18
who 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
to 18
know 18
quite 18
whats 18
going 18
on 18
i 18
dont 18
get 18
picked 18
i 18

sent 18
to 18
messalla 18
who 18
dabs 18
some 18
makeup 18
on 18
my 18
face 18
for 18
the 18
anticipated 18
closeups 18
the 18
squad 18
positions 18
itself 18
under 18
boggss 18
direction 18
and 18
then 18
we 18
have 18
to 18
wait 18
for 18
cressida 18
to 18
get 18
the 18
cameramen 18
in 18
place 18
as 18
well 18
theyre 18
both 18
to 18
our 18
left 18
with 18
castor 18
toward 18
the 18
front 18
and 18
pollux 18
bringing 18
up 18
the 18
rear 18
so 18
theyll 18
be 18
sure 18
not 18
to 18
record 18
each 18
other 18
messalla 18
sets 18
off 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
smoke 18
charges 18
for 18
atmosphere 18
since 18
this 18
is 18
both 18
a 18
mission 18
and 18
a 18
shoot 18
im 18
about 18
to 18
ask 18
whos 18
in 18
charge 18
my 18
commander 18
or 18
my 18
director 18
when 18
cressida 18
calls 18
action 18
we 18
slowly 18
proceed 18
down 18
the 18
hazy 18
street 18
just 18
like 18
one 18
of 18
our 18
exercises 18
in 18
the 18
block 18
everyone 18
has 18
at 18
least 18
one 18
section 18
of 18
windows 18
to 18
blow 18
out 18
but 18
gales 18
assigned 18
the 18
real 18
target 18
when 18
he 18
hits 18
the 18
pod 18
we 18
take 18
coverducking 18
into 18
doorways 18
or 18
flattening 18
onto 18
the 18
pretty 18
light 18
orange 18
and 18
pink 18
paving 18
stonesas 18
a 18
hail 18
of 18
bullets 18
sweeps 18
back 18
and 18
forth 18
over 18
our 18
heads 18
after 18
a 18
while 18
boggs 18
orders 18
us 18
forward 18
cressida 18
stops 18
us 18
before 18
we 18
can 18
rise 18
since 18
she 18
needs 18
some 18
closeup 18
shots 18
we 18
take 18
turns 18
reenacting 18
our 18
responses 18
falling 18
to 18
the 18
ground 18
grimacing 18
diving 18
into 18
alcoves 18
we 18
know 18
its 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
serious 18
business 18
but 18
the 18
whole 18
thing 18
feels 18
a 18
little 18
ridiculous 18
especially 18
when 18
it 18
turns 18
out 18
that 18
im 18
not 18
the 18
worst 18
actor 18
in 18
the 18
squad 18
not 18
by 18
a 18
long 18
shot 18
were 18
all 18
laughing 18
so 18
hard 18
at 18
mitchells 18
attempt 18
to 18
project 18
his 18
idea 18
of 18
desperation 18
which 18
involves 18
teeth 18
grinding 18
and 18
nostrils 18
flaring 18
that 18
boggs 18
has 18
to 18
reprimand 18
us 18
pull 18
it 18
together 18
fourfiveone 18
he 18
says 18
firmly 18
but 18
you 18
can 18
see 18
him 18
suppressing 18
a 18
smile 18
as 18
hes 18
doublechecking 18
the 18
next 18
pod 18
positioning 18
the 18
holo 18
to 18
find 18
the 18
best 18
light 18
in 18
the 18
smoky 18
air 18
still 18
facing 18
us 18
as 18
his 18
left 18
foot 18
steps 18
back 18
onto 18
the 18
orange 18
paving 18
stone 18
triggering 18
the 18
bomb 18
that 18
blows 18
off 18
his 18
legs 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
in 18
an 18
instant 18
a 18
painted 18
window 18
shatters 18
revealing 18
the 18
ugly 18
world 18
behind 18
it 18
laughter 18
changes 18
to 18
screams 18
blood 18
stains 18
pastel 18
stones 18
real 18
smoke 18
darkens 18
the 18
special 18
effect 18
stuff 18
made 18
for 18
television 18
a 18
second 18
explosion 18
seems 18
to 18
split 18
the 18
air 18
and 18
leaves 18
my 18
ears 18
ringing 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
make 18
out 18
where 18
it 18
came 18
from 18
i 18
reach 18
boggs 18
first 18
try 18
to 18
make 18
sense 18
of 18
the 18
torn 18
flesh 18
missing 18
limbs 18
to 18
find 18
something 18
to 18
stem 18
the 18
red 18
flow 18
from 18
his 18
body 18
homes 18
pushes 18
me 18
aside 18
wrenching 18
open 18
a 18
firstaid 18
kit 18
boggs 18
clutches 18
my 18
wrist 18
his 18
face 18
gray 18
with 18
dying 18
and 18
ash 18
seems 18
to 18
be 18
receding 18
but 18
his 18
next 18
words 18
are 18
an 18
order 18
the 18
holo 18
the 18
holo 18
i 18
scramble 18
around 18
digging 18
through 18
chunks 18
of 18
tile 18
slick 18
with 18
blood 18
shuddering 18
when 18
i 18
encounter 18
bits 18
of 18
warm 18
flesh 18
find 18
it 18
rammed 18
into 18
a 18
stairwell 18
with 18
one 18
of 18
boggscatching 18
fire 18
part 18
i 18
the 18
spark 18
i 18
clasp 18
the 18
flask 18
between 18
my 18
hands 18
even 18
though 18
the 18
warmth 18
from 18
the 18
tea 18
has 18
long 18
since 18
leached 18
into 18
the 18
frozen 18
air 18
my 18
muscles 18
are 18
clenched 18
tight 18
against 18
the 18
cold 18
if 18
a 18
pack 18
of 18
wild 18
dogs 18
were 18
to 18
appear 18
at 18
this 18
moment 18
the 18
odds 18
of 18
scaling 18
a 18
tree 18
before 18
they 18
attacked 18
are 18
not 18
in 18
my 18
favor 18
i 18
should 18
get 18
up 18
move 18
around 18
and 18
work 18
the 18
stiffness 18
from 18
my 18
limbs 18
but 18
instead 18
i 18
sit 18
as 18
motionless 18
as 18
the 18
rock 18
beneath 18
me 18
while 18
the 18
dawn 18
begins 18
to 18
lighten 18
the 18
woods 18
i 18
cant 18
fight 18
the 18
sun 18
i 18
can 18
only 18
watch 18
helplessly 18
as 18
it 18
drags 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
day 18
that 18
ive 18
been 18
dreading 18
for 18
months 18
by 18
noon 18
they 18
will 18
all 18
be 18
at 18
my 18
new 18
house 18
in 18
the 18
victors 18
village 18
the 18
reporters 18
the 18
camera 18
crews 18
even 18
effie 18
trinket 18
my 18
old 18
escort 18
will 18
have 18
made 18
their 18
way 18
to 18
district 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
i 18
wonder 18
if 18
effie 18
will 18
still 18
be 18
wearing 18
that 18
silly 18
pink 18
wig 18
or 18
if 18
shell 18
be 18
sporting 18
some 18
other 18
unnatural 18
color 18
especially 18
for 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
there 18
will 18
be 18
others 18
waiting 18
too 18
a 18
staff 18
to 18
cater 18
to 18
my 18
every 18
need 18
on 18
the 18
long 18
train 18
trip 18
a 18
prep 18
team 18
to 18
beautify 18
me 18
for 18
public 18
appearances 18
my 18
stylist 18
and 18
friend 18
cinna 18
who 18
designed 18
the 18
gorgeous 18
outfits 18
that 18
first 18
made 18
the 18
audience 18
take 18
notice 18
of 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
if 18
it 18
were 18
up 18
to 18
me 18
i 18
would 18
try 18
to 18
forget 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
entirely 18
never 18
speak 18
of 18
them 18
pretend 18
they 18
were 18
nothing 18
but 18
a 18
bad 18
dream 18
but 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
makes 18
that 18
impossible 18
strategically 18
placed 18
almost 18
midway 18
between 18
the 18
annual 18
games 18
it 18
is 18
the 18
capitols 18
way 18
of 18
keeping 18
the 18
horror 18
fresh 18
and 18
immediate 18
not 18
only 18
are 18
we 18
in 18
the 18
districts 18
forced 18
to 18
remember 18
the 18
iron 18
grip 18
of 18
the 18
capitols 18
power 18
each 18
year 18
we 18
are 18
forced 18
to 18
celebrate 18
it 18
and 18
this 18
year 18
i 18
am 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
stars 18
of 18
the 18
show 18
i 18
will 18
have 18
to 18
travel 18
from 18
district 18
to 18
district 18
to 18
stand 18
before 18
the 18
cheering 18
crowds 18
who 18
secretly 18
loathe 18
me 18
to 18
look 18
down 18
into 18
the 18
faces 18
of 18
the 18
families 18
whose 18
children 18
i 18
have 18
killed 18
the 18
sun 18
persists 18
in 18
rising 18
so 18
i 18
make 18
myself 18
stand 18
all 18
my 18
joints 18
complain 18
and 18
my 18
left 18
leg 18
has 18
been 18
asleep 18
for 18
so 18
long 18
that 18
it 18
takes 18
several 18
minutes 18
of 18
pacing 18
to 18
bring 18
the 18
feeling 18
back 18
into 18
it 18
ive 18
been 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
three 18
hours 18
but 18
as 18
ive 18
made 18
no 18
real 18
attempt 18
at 18
hunting 18
i 18
have 18
nothing 18
to 18
show 18
for 18
it 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
for 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
little 18
sister 18
prim 18
anymore 18
they 18
can 18
afford 18
to 18
buy 18
butcher 18
meat 18
in 18
town 18
although 18
none 18
of 18
us 18
likes 18
it 18
any 18
better 18
than 18
fresh 18
game 18
but 18
my 18
best 18
friend 18
gale 18
hawthorne 18
and 18
his 18
family 18
will 18
be 18
depending 18
on 18
todays 18
haul 18
and 18
i 18
cant 18
let 18
them 18
down 18
i 18
start 18
the 18
hourandahalf 18
trek 18
it 18
will 18
take 18
to 18
cover 18
our 18
snare 18
line 18
back 18
when 18
we 18
were 18
in 18
school 18
we 18
had 18
time 18
in 18
the 18
afternoons 18
to 18
check 18
the 18
line 18
and 18
hunt 18
and 18
gather 18
and 18
still 18
get 18
back 18
to 18
trade 18
in 18
town 18
but 18
now 18
that 18
gale 18
has 18
gone 18
to 18
work 18
in 18
the 18
coal 18
mines 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
all 18
dayive 18
taken 18
over 18
the 18
job 18
by 18
this 18
time 18
gale 18
will 18
have 18
clocked 18
in 18
at 18
the 18
mines 18
taken 18
the 18
stomachchurning 18
elevator 18
ride 18
into 18
the 18
depths 18
of 18
the 18
earth 18
and 18
be 18
pounding 18
away 18
at 18
a 18
coal 18
seam 18
i 18
know 18
what 18
its 18
like 18
down 18
there 18
every 18
year 18
in 18
school 18
as 18
part 18
of 18
our 18
training 18
my 18
class 18
had 18
to 18
tour 18
the 18
mines 18
when 18
i 18
was 18
little 18
it 18
was 18
just 18
unpleasant 18
the 18
claustrophobic 18
tunnels 18
foul 18
air 18
suffocating 18
darkness 18
on 18
all 18
sides 18
but 18
after 18
my 18
father 18
and 18
several 18
other 18
miners 18
were 18
killed 18
in 18
an 18
explosion 18
i 18
could 18
barely 18
force 18
myself 18
onto 18
the 18
elevator 18
the 18
annual 18
trip 18
became 18
an 18
enormous 18
source 18
of 18
anxiety 18
twice 18
i 18
made 18
myself 18
so 18
sick 18
in 18
anticipation 18
of 18
it 18
that 18
my 18
mother 18
kept 18
me 18
home 18
because 18
she 18
thought 18
i 18
had 18
contracted 18
the 18
flu 18
i 18
think 18
of 18
gale 18
who 18
is 18
only 18
really 18
alive 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
with 18
its 18
fresh 18
air 18
and 18
sunlight 18
and 18
clean 18
flowing 18
water 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
how 18
he 18
stands 18
it 18
well 18
yes 18
i 18
do 18
he 18
stands 18
it 18
because 18
its 18
the 18
way 18
to 18
feed 18
his 18
mother 18
and 18
two 18
younger 18
brothers 18
and 18
sister 18
and 18
here 18
i 18
am 18
with 18
buckets 18
of 18
money 18
far 18
more 18
than 18
enough 18
to 18
feed 18
both 18
our 18
families 18
now 18
and 18
he 18
wont 18
take 18
a 18
single 18
coin 18
its 18
even 18
hard 18
for 18
him 18
to 18
let 18
me 18
bring 18
in 18
meat 18
although 18
hed 18
surely 18
have 18
kept 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
prim 18
supplied 18
if 18
id 18
been 18
killed 18
in 18
the 18
games 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
hes 18
doing 18
me 18
a 18
favor 18
that 18
it 18
drives 18
me 18
nuts 18
to 18
sit 18
around 18
all 18
day 18
even 18
so 18
i 18
never 18
drop 18
off 18
the 18
game 18
while 18
hes 18
at 18
home 18
which 18
is 18
easy 18
since 18
he 18
works 18
twelve 18
hours 18
a 18
day 18
the 18
only 18
time 18
i 18
really 18
get 18
to 18
see 18
gale 18
now 18
is 18
on 18
sundays 18
when 18
we 18
meet 18
up 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
to 18
hunt 18
together 18
its 18
still 18
the 18
best 18
day 18
of 18
the 18
week 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
like 18
it 18
used 18
to 18
be 18
before 18
when 18
we 18
could 18
tell 18
each 18
other 18
anything 18
the 18
games 18
have 18
spoiled 18
even 18
that 18
i 18
keep 18
hoping 18
that 18
as 18
time 18
passes 18
well 18
regain 18
the 18
ease 18
between 18
us 18
but 18
part 18
of 18
me 18
knows 18
its 18
futile 18
theres 18
no 18
going 18
back 18
i 18
get 18
a 18
good 18
haul 18
from 18
the 18
traps 18
eight 18
rabbits 18
two 18
squirrels 18
and 18
a 18
beaver 18
that 18
swam 18
into 18
a 18
wire 18
contraption 18
gale 18
designed 18
himself 18
hes 18
something 18
of 18
a 18
whiz 18
with 18
snares 18
rigging 18
them 18
to 18
bent 18
saplings 18
so 18
they 18
pull 18
the 18
kill 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
reach 18
of 18
predators 18
balancing 18
logs 18
on 18
delicate 18
stick 18
triggers 18
weaving 18
inescapable 18
baskets 18
to 18
capture 18
fish 18
as 18
i 18
go 18
along 18
carefully 18
resetting 18
each 18
snare 18
i 18
know 18
i 18
can 18
never 18
quite 18
replicate 18
his 18
eye 18
for 18
balance 18
his 18
instinct 18
for 18
where 18
the 18
prey 18
will 18
cross 18
the 18
path 18
its 18
more 18
than 18
experience 18
its 18
a 18
natural 18
gift 18
like 18
the 18
way 18
i 18
can 18
shoot 18
at 18
an 18
animal 18
in 18
almost 18
complete 18
darkness 18
and 18
still 18
take 18
it 18
down 18
with 18
one 18
arrow 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
make 18
it 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
fence 18
that 18
surrounds 18
district 18
the 18
sun 18
is 18
well 18
up 18
as 18
always 18
i 18
listen 18
a 18
moment 18
but 18
theres 18
no 18
telltale 18
hum 18
of 18
electrical 18
current 18
running 18
through 18
the 18
chain 18
link 18
there 18
hardly 18
ever 18
is 18
even 18
though 18
the 18
thing 18
is 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
charged 18
fulltime 18
i 18
wriggle 18
through 18
the 18
opening 18
at 18
the 18
bottom 18
of 18
the 18
fence 18
and 18
come 18
up 18
in 18
the 18
meadow 18
just 18
a 18
stones 18
throw 18
from 18
my 18
home 18
my 18
old 18
home 18
we 18
still 18
get 18
to 18
keep 18
it 18
since 18
officially 18
its 18
the 18
designated 18
dwelling 18
of 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
sister 18
if 18
i 18
should 18
drop 18
dead 18
right 18
now 18
they 18
would 18
have 18
to 18
return 18
to 18
it 18
but 18
at 18
present 18
theyre 18
both 18
happily 18
installed 18
in 18
the 18
new 18
house 18
in 18
the 18
victors 18
village 18
and 18
im 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
who 18
uses 18
the 18
squat 18
little 18
place 18
where 18
i 18
was 18
raised 18
to 18
me 18
its 18
my 18
real 18
home 18
i 18
go 18
there 18
now 18
to 18
switch 18
my 18
clothes 18
exchange 18
my 18
fathers 18
old 18
leather 18
jacket 18
for 18
a 18
fine 18
wool 18
coat 18
that 18
always 18
seems 18
too 18
tight 18
in 18
the 18
shoulders 18
leave 18
my 18
soft 18
worn 18
hunting 18
boots 18
for 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
expensive 18
machinemade 18
shoes 18
that 18
my 18
mother 18
thinks 18
are 18
more 18
appropriate 18
for 18
someone 18
of 18
my 18
status 18
ive 18
already 18
stowed 18
my 18
bow 18
and 18
arrows 18
in 18
a 18
hollow 18
log 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
although 18
time 18
is 18
ticking 18
away 18
i 18
allow 18
myself 18
a 18
few 18
minutes 18
to 18
sit 18
in 18
the 18
kitchen 18
it 18
has 18
an 18
abandoned 18
quality 18
with 18
no 18
fire 18
on 18
the 18
hearth 18
no 18
cloth 18
on 18
the 18
table 18
i 18
mourn 18
my 18
old 18
life 18
here 18
we 18
barely 18
scraped 18
by 18
but 18
i 18
knew 18
where 18
i 18
fit 18
in 18
i 18
knew 18
what 18
my 18
place 18
was 18
in 18
the 18
tightly 18
interwoven 18
fabric 18
that 18
was 18
our 18
life 18
i 18
wish 18
i 18
could 18
go 18
back 18
to 18
it 18
because 18
in 18
retrospect 18
it 18
seems 18
so 18
secure 18
compared 18
with 18
now 18
when 18
i 18
am 18
so 18
rich 18
and 18
so 18
famous 18
and 18
so 18
hated 18
by 18
the 18
authorities 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
a 18
wailing 18
at 18
the 18
back 18
door 18
demands 18
my 18
attention 18
i 18
open 18
it 18
to 18
find 18
buttercup 18
prims 18
scruffy 18
old 18
tomcat 18
he 18
dislikes 18
the 18
new 18
house 18
almost 18
as 18
much 18
as 18
i 18
do 18
and 18
always 18
leaves 18
it 18
when 18
my 18
sisters 18
at 18
school 18
weve 18
never 18
been 18
particularly 18
fond 18
of 18
each 18
other 18
but 18
now 18
we 18
have 18
this 18
new 18
bond 18
i 18
let 18
him 18
in 18
feed 18
him 18
a 18
chunk 18
of 18
beaver 18
fat 18
and 18
even 18
rub 18
him 18
between 18
the 18
ears 18
for 18
a 18
bit 18
youre 18
hideous 18
you 18
know 18
that 18
right 18
i 18
ask 18
him 18
buttercup 18
nudges 18
my 18
hand 18
for 18
more 18
petting 18
but 18
we 18
have 18
to 18
go 18
come 18
on 18
you 18
i 18
scoop 18
him 18
up 18
with 18
one 18
hand 18
grab 18
my 18
game 18
bag 18
with 18
the 18
other 18
and 18
haul 18
them 18
both 18
out 18
onto 18
the 18
street 18
the 18
cat 18
springs 18
free 18
and 18
disappears 18
under 18
a 18
bush 18
the 18
shoes 18
pinch 18
my 18
toes 18
as 18
i 18
crunch 18
along 18
the 18
cinder 18
street 18
cutting 18
down 18
alleys 18
and 18
through 18
backyards 18
gets 18
me 18
to 18
gales 18
house 18
in 18
minutes 18
his 18
mother 18
hazelle 18
sees 18
me 18
through 18
the 18
window 18
where 18
shes 18
bent 18
over 18
the 18
kitchen 18
sink 18
she 18
dries 18
her 18
hands 18
on 18
her 18
apron 18
and 18
disappears 18
to 18
meet 18
me 18
at 18
the 18
door 18
i 18
like 18
hazelle 18
respect 18
her 18
the 18
explosion 18
that 18
killed 18
my 18
father 18
took 18
out 18
her 18
husband 18
as 18
well 18
leaving 18
her 18
with 18
three 18
boys 18
and 18
a 18
baby 18
due 18
any 18
day 18
less 18
than 18
a 18
week 18
after 18
she 18
gave 18
birth 18
she 18
was 18
out 18
hunting 18
the 18
streets 18
for 18
work 18
the 18
mines 18
werent 18
an 18
option 18
what 18
with 18
a 18
baby 18
to 18
look 18
after 18
but 18
she 18
managed 18
to 18
get 18
laundry 18
from 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
merchants 18
in 18
town 18
at 18
fourteen 18
gale 18
the 18
eldest 18
of 18
the 18
kids 18
became 18
the 18
main 18
supporter 18
of 18
the 18
family 18
he 18
was 18
already 18
signed 18
up 18
for 18
tesserae 18
which 18
entitled 18
them 18
to 18
a 18
meager 18
supply 18
of 18
grain 18
and 18
oil 18
in 18
exchange 18
for 18
his 18
entering 18
his 18
name 18
extra 18
times 18
in 18
the 18
drawing 18
to 18
become 18
a 18
tribute 18
on 18
top 18
of 18
that 18
even 18
back 18
then 18
he 18
was 18
a 18
skilled 18
trapper 18
but 18
it 18
wasnt 18
enough 18
to 18
keep 18
a 18
family 18
of 18
five 18
without 18
hazelle 18
working 18
her 18
fingers 18
to 18
the 18
bone 18
on 18
that 18
washboard 18
in 18
winter 18
her 18
hands 18
got 18
so 18
red 18
and 18
cracked 18
they 18
bled 18
at 18
the 18
slightest 18
provocation 18
still 18
would 18
if 18
it 18
wasnt 18
for 18
a 18
salve 18
my 18
mother 18
concocted 18
but 18
they 18
are 18
determined 18
hazelle 18
and 18
gale 18
that 18
the 18
other 18
boys 18
twelve 18
yearold 18
rory 18
and 18
tenyearold 18
vick 18
and 18
the 18
baby 18
fouryearold 18
posy 18
will 18
never 18
have 18
to 18
sign 18
up 18
for 18
tesserae 18
hazelle 18
smiles 18
when 18
she 18
sees 18
the 18
game 18
she 18
takes 18
the 18
beaver 18
by 18
the 18
tail 18
feeling 18
its 18
weight 18
hes 18
going 18
to 18
make 18
a 18
nice 18
stew 18
unlike 18
gale 18
she 18
has 18
no 18
problem 18
with 18
our 18
hunting 18
arrangement 18
good 18
pelt 18
too 18
i 18
answer 18
its 18
comforting 18
here 18
with 18
hazelle 18
weighing 18
the 18
merits 18
of 18
the 18
game 18
just 18
as 18
we 18
always 18
have 18
she 18
pours 18
me 18
a 18
mug 18
of 18
herb 18
tea 18
which 18
i 18
wrap 18
my 18
chilled 18
fingers 18
around 18
gratefully 18
you 18
know 18
when 18
i 18
get 18
back 18
from 18
the 18
tour 18
i 18
was 18
thinking 18
i 18
might 18
take 18
rory 18
out 18
with 18
me 18
sometimes 18
after 18
school 18
teach 18
him 18
to 18
shoot 18
hazelle 18
nods 18
thatd 18
be 18
good 18
gale 18
means 18
to 18
but 18
hes 18
only 18
got 18
his 18
sundays 18
and 18
i 18
think 18
he 18
likes 18
saving 18
those 18
for 18
you 18
i 18
cant 18
stop 18
the 18
redness 18
that 18
floods 18
my 18
cheeks 18
its 18
stupid 18
of 18
course 18
hardly 18
anybody 18
knows 18
me 18
better 18
than 18
hazelle 18
knows 18
the 18
bond 18
i 18
share 18
with 18
gale 18
im 18
sure 18
plenty 18
of 18
people 18
assumed 18
that 18
wed 18
eventually 18
get 18
married 18
even 18
if 18
i 18
never 18
gave 18
it 18
any 18
thought 18
but 18
that 18
was 18
before 18
the 18
games 18
before 18
my 18
fellow 18
tribute 18
peeta 18
mellark 18
announced 18
he 18
was 18
madly 18
in 18
love 18
with 18
me 18
our 18
romance 18
became 18
a 18
key 18
strategy 18
for 18
our 18
survival 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
only 18
it 18
wasnt 18
just 18
a 18
strategy 18
for 18
peeta 18
im 18
not 18
sure 18
what 18
it 18
was 18
for 18
me 18
but 18
i 18
know 18
now 18
it 18
was 18
nothing 18
but 18
painful 18
for 18
gale 18
my 18
chest 18
tightens 18
as 18
i 18
think 18
about 18
how 18
on 18
the 18
victory 18
tour 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
will 18
have 18
to 18
present 18
ourselves 18
as 18
lovers 18
again 18
i 18
gulp 18
my 18
tea 18
even 18
though 18
its 18
too 18
hot 18
and 18
push 18
back 18
from 18
the 18
table 18
i 18
better 18
get 18
going 18
make 18
myself 18
presentable 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
hazelle 18
hugs 18
me 18
enjoy 18
the 18
food 18
absolutely 18
i 18
say 18
my 18
next 18
stop 18
is 18
the 18
hob 18
where 18
ive 18
traditionally 18
done 18
the 18
bulk 18
of 18
my 18
trading 18
years 18
ago 18
it 18
was 18
a 18
warehouse 18
to 18
store 18
coal 18
but 18
when 18
it 18
fell 18
into 18
disuse 18
it 18
became 18
a 18
meeting 18
place 18
for 18
illegal 18
trades 18
and 18
then 18
blossomed 18
into 18
a 18
fulltime 18
black 18
market 18
if 18
it 18
attracts 18
a 18
somewhat 18
criminal 18
element 18
then 18
i 18
belong 18
here 18
i 18
guess 18
hunting 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
surrounding 18
district 18
violates 18
at 18
least 18
a 18
dozen 18
laws 18
and 18
is 18
punishable 18
by 18
death 18
although 18
they 18
never 18
mention 18
it 18
i 18
owe 18
the 18
people 18
who 18
frequent 18
the 18
hob 18
gale 18
told 18
me 18
that 18
greasy 18
sae 18
the 18
old 18
woman 18
who 18
serves 18
up 18
soup 18
started 18
a 18
collection 18
to 18
sponsor 18
peeta 18
and 18
me 18
during 18
the 18
games 18
it 18
was 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
just 18
a 18
hob 18
thing 18
but 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
other 18
people 18
heard 18
about 18
it 18
and 18
chipped 18
in 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
exactly 18
how 18
much 18
it 18
was 18
and 18
the 18
price 18
of 18
any 18
gift 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
was 18
exorbitant 18
but 18
for 18
all 18
i 18
know 18
it 18
made 18
the 18
difference 18
between 18
my 18
life 18
and 18
death 18
its 18
still 18
odd 18
to 18
drag 18
open 18
the 18
front 18
door 18
with 18
an 18
empty 18
game 18
bag 18
with 18
nothing 18
to 18
trade 18
and 18
instead 18
feel 18
the 18
heavy 18
pocket 18
of 18
coins 18
against 18
my 18
hip 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
hit 18
as 18
many 18
stalls 18
as 18
possible 18
spreading 18
out 18
my 18
purchases 18
of 18
coffee 18
buns 18
eggs 18
yarn 18
and 18
oil 18
as 18
an 18
afterthought 18
i 18
buy 18
three 18
bottles 18
of 18
white 18
liquor 18
from 18
a 18
onearmed 18
woman 18
named 18
ripper 18
a 18
victim 18
of 18
a 18
mine 18
accident 18
who 18
was 18
smart 18
enough 18
to 18
find 18
a 18
way 18
to 18
stay 18
alive 18
the 18
liquor 18
isnt 18
for 18
my 18
family 18
its 18
for 18
haymitch 18
who 18
acted 18
as 18
mentor 18
for 18
peeta 18
and 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
games 18
hes 18
surly 18
violent 18
and 18
drunk 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
time 18
but 18
he 18
did 18
his 18
job 18
more 18
than 18
his 18
jobbecause 18
for 18
the 18
first 18
time 18
in 18
history 18
two 18
tributes 18
were 18
allowed 18
to 18
win 18
so 18
no 18
matter 18
who 18
haymitch 18
is 18
i 18
owe 18
him 18
too 18
and 18
thats 18
for 18
always 18
im 18
getting 18
the 18
white 18
liquor 18
because 18
a 18
few 18
weeks 18
ago 18
he 18
ran 18
out 18
and 18
there 18
was 18
none 18
for 18
sale 18
and 18
he 18
had 18
a 18
withdrawal 18
shaking 18
and 18
screaming 18
at 18
terrifying 18
things 18
only 18
he 18
could 18
see 18
he 18
scared 18
prim 18
to 18
death 18
and 18
frankly 18
it 18
wasnt 18
much 18
fun 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
see 18
him 18
like 18
that 18
either 18
ever 18
since 18
then 18
ive 18
been 18
sort 18
of 18
stockpiling 18
the 18
stuff 18

a 18
shortage 18

head 18
peacekeeper 18

sees 18
me 18
with 18
the 18
bottles 18
hes 18
an 18
older 18
man 18
with 18
a 18
few 18
strands 18
of 18
silver 18
hair 18
combed 18
sideways 18
above 18
his 18
bright 18
red 18
face 18
that 18
stuffs 18
too 18
strong 18
for 18
you 18
girl 18
he 18
should 18
know 18
next 18
to 18
haymitch 18

and 18
slaps 18
down 18

coin 18
for 18
a 18
bottle 18
when 18

on 18
the 18
counter 18
and 18
order 18
some 18

to 18
be 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
gourd 18
and 18
bean 18
mixture 18
a 18
peacekeeper 18

in 18
his 18
twenties 18
but 18
he 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
much 18
older 18

the 18
list 18
him 18
being 18
your 18
cousin 18
and 18
all 18
she 18
says 18
wryly 18
its 18
just 18
one 18
more 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
lie 18
the 18
capitol 18
has 18
concocted 18
when 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
made 18
it 18
into 18
the 18
final 18
eight 18
in 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
they 18
sent 18
reporters 18
to 18
do 18
personal 18
stories 18
about 18
us 18
when 18
they 18
asked 18
about 18
my 18
friends 18
everyone 18
directed 18
them 18
to 18
gale 18
but 18
it 18
wouldnt 18
do 18
what 18
with 18
the 18
romance 18
i 18
was 18
playing 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
to 18
have 18
my 18
best 18
friend 18
be 18
gale 18
he 18
was 18
too 18
handsome 18
too 18
male 18
and 18
not 18
the 18
least 18
bit 18
willing 18
to 18
smile 18
and 18
play 18
nice 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
we 18
do 18
resemble 18
each 18
other 18
though 18
quite 18
a 18
bit 18
we 18
have 18
that 18
seam 18
look 18
dark 18
straight 18
hair 18
olive 18
skin 18
gray 18
eyes 18
so 18
some 18
genius 18
made 18
him 18
my 18
cousin 18
i 18
didnt 18
know 18
about 18
it 18
until 18
we 18
were 18
already 18
home 18
on 18
the 18
platform 18
at 18
the 18
train 18
station 18
and 18
my 18
mother 18
said 18
your 18
cousins 18
can 18
hardly 18
wait 18
to 18
see 18
you 18
then 18
i 18
turned 18
and 18
saw 18
gale 18
and 18
hazelle 18
and 18
all 18
the 18
kids 18
waiting 18
for 18
me 18
so 18
what 18
could 18
i 18
do 18
but 18
go 18
along 18
greasy 18
sae 18
knows 18
were 18
not 18
related 18
but 18
even 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
people 18
who 18
have 18
known 18
us 18
for 18
years 18
seem 18
to 18
have 18
forgotten 18
i 18
just 18
cant 18
wait 18
for 18
the 18
whole 18
thing 18
to 18
be 18
over 18
i 18
whisper 18
i 18
know 18
says 18
greasy 18
sae 18
but 18
youve 18
got 18
to 18
go 18
through 18
it 18
to 18
get 18
to 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
it 18
better 18
not 18
be 18
late 18
a 18
light 18
snow 18
starts 18
to 18
fall 18
as 18
i 18
make 18
my 18
way 18
to 18
the 18
victors 18
village 18
its 18
about 18
a 18
halfmile 18
walk 18
from 18
the 18
square 18
in 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
town 18
but 18
it 18
seems 18
like 18
another 18
world 18
entirely 18
its 18
a 18
separate 18
community 18
built 18
around 18
a 18
beautiful 18
green 18
dotted 18
with 18
flowering 18
bushes 18
there 18
are 18
twelve 18
houses 18
each 18
large 18
enough 18
to 18
hold 18
ten 18
of 18
the 18
one 18
i 18
was 18
raised 18
in 18
nine 18
stand 18
empty 18
as 18
they 18
always 18
have 18
the 18
three 18
in 18
use 18
belong 18
to 18
haymitch 18
peeta 18
and 18
me 18
the 18
houses 18
inhabited 18
by 18
my 18
family 18
and 18
peeta 18
give 18
off 18
a 18
warm 18
glow 18
of 18
life 18
lit 18
windows 18
smoke 18
from 18
the 18
chimneys 18
bunches 18
of 18
brightly 18
colored 18
corn 18
affixed 18
to 18
the 18
front 18
doors 18
as 18
decoration 18
for 18
the 18
upcoming 18
harvest 18
festival 18
however 18
haymitchs 18
house 18
despite 18
the 18
care 18
taken 18
by 18
the 18
groundskeeper 18
exudes 18
an 18
air 18
of 18
abandonment 18
and 18
neglect 18
i 18
brace 18
myself 18
at 18
his 18
front 18
door 18
knowing 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
foul 18
then 18
push 18
inside 18
my 18
nose 18
immediately 18
wrinkles 18
in 18
disgust 18
haymitch 18
refuses 18
to 18
let 18
anyone 18
in 18
to 18
clean 18
and 18
does 18
a 18
poor 18
jobekeepers 18
line 18
the 18
roof 18
across 18
from 18
our 18
former 18
hideout 18
shells 18
are 18
launched 18
into 18
the 18
row 18
of 18
apartments 18
setting 18
off 18
the 18
chain 18
of 18
explosions 18
we 18
heard 18
and 18
the 18
building 18
collapses 18
into 18
rubble 18
and 18
dust 18
now 18
we 18
cut 18
to 18
a 18
live 18
feed 18
a 18
reporter 18
stands 18
on 18
the 18
roof 18
with 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
behind 18
her 18
the 18
apartment 18
block 18
burns 18
firefighters 18
try 18
to 18
control 18
the 18
blaze 18
with 18
water 18
hoses 18
we 18
are 18
pronounced 18
dead 18
finally 18
a 18
bit 18
of 18
luck 18
says 18
homes 18
i 18
guess 18
hes 18
right 18
certainly 18
its 18
better 18
than 18
having 18
the 18
capitol 18
in 18
pursuit 18
of 18
us 18
but 18
i 18
just 18
keep 18
imagining 18
how 18
this 18
will 18
be 18
playing 18
back 18
in 18
where 18
my 18
mother 18
and 18
prim 18
hazelle 18
and 18
the 18
kids 18
annie 18
haymitch 18
and 18
a 18
whole 18
lot 18
of 18
people 18
from 18
think 18
that 18
they 18
have 18
just 18
seen 18
us 18
die 18
my 18
father 18
he 18
just 18
lost 18
my 18
sister 18
and 18
now 18
says 18
leeg 18
we 18
watch 18
as 18
they 18
play 18
the 18
footage 18
over 18
and 18
over 18
revel 18
in 18
their 18
victory 18
especially 18
over 18
me 18
break 18
away 18
to 18
do 18
a 18
montage 18
of 18
the 18
mockingjays 18
rise 18
to 18
rebel 18
poweri 18
think 18
theyve 18
had 18
this 18
part 18
prepared 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
because 18
it 18
seems 18
pretty 18
polishedand 18
then 18
go 18
live 18
so 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
reporters 18
can 18
discuss 18
my 18
welldeserved 18
violent 18
end 18
later 18
they 18
promise 18
snow 18
will 18
make 18
an 18
official 18
statement 18
the 18
screen 18
fades 18
back 18
to 18
a 18
glow 18
the 18
rebels 18
made 18
no 18
attempt 18
to 18
break 18
in 18
during 18
the 18
broadcast 18
which 18
leads 18
me 18
to 18
believe 18
they 18
think 18
its 18
true 18
if 18
thats 18
so 18
we 18
really 18
are 18
on 18
our 18
own 18
so 18
now 18
that 18
were 18
dead 18
whats 18
our 18
next 18
move 18
asks 18
gale 18
isnt 18
it 18
obvious 18
no 18
one 18
even 18
knew 18
peeta 18
had 18
regained 18
consciousness 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
how 18
long 18
hes 18
been 18
watching 18
but 18
by 18
the 18
look 18
of 18
misery 18
on 18
his 18
face 18
long 18
enough 18
to 18
see 18
what 18
happened 18
on 18
the 18
street 18
how 18
he 18
went 18
mad 18
tried 18
to 18
bash 18
my 18
head 18
in 18
and 18
hurled 18
mitchell 18
into 18
the 18
pod 18
he 18
painfully 18
pushes 18
himself 18
up 18
to 18
a 18
sitting 18
position 18
and 18
directs 18
his 18
words 18
to 18
gale 18
our 18
next 18
moveis 18
to 18
kill 18
me 18
that 18
makes 18
two 18
requests 18
for 18
peetas 18
death 18
in 18
less 18
than 18
an 18
hour 18
dont 18
be 18
ridiculous 18
says 18
jackson 18
i 18
just 18
murdered 18
a 18
member 18
of 18
our 18
squad 18
shouts 18
peeta 18
you 18
pushed 18
him 18
off 18
you 18
you 18
couldnt 18
have 18
known 18
he 18
would 18
trigger 18
the 18
net 18
at 18
that 18
exact 18
spot 18
says 18
finnick 18
trying 18
to 18
calm 18
him 18
who 18
cares 18
hes 18
dead 18
isnt 18
he 18
tears 18
begin 18
to 18
run 18
down 18
peetas 18
face 18
i 18
didnt 18
know 18
ive 18
never 18
seen 18
myself 18
like 18
that 18
before 18
katniss 18
is 18
right 18
im 18
the 18
monster 18
im 18
the 18
mutt 18
im 18
the 18
one 18
snow 18
has 18
turned 18
into 18
a 18
weapon 18
its 18
not 18
your 18
fault 18
peeta 18
says 18
finnick 18
you 18
cant 18
take 18
me 18
with 18
you 18
its 18
only 18
a 18
matter 18
of 18
time 18
before 18
i 18
kill 18
someone 18
else 18
peeta 18
looks 18
around 18
at 18
our 18
conflicted 18
faces 18
maybe 18
you 18
think 18
its 18
kinder 18
to 18
just 18
dump 18
me 18
somewhere 18
let 18
me 18
take 18
my 18
chances 18
but 18
thats 18
the 18
same 18
thing 18
as 18
handing 18
me 18
over 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
youd 18
be 18
doing 18
me 18
a 18
favor 18
by 18
sending 18
me 18
back 18
to 18
snow 18
peeta 18
back 18
in 18
snows 18
hands 18
tortured 18
and 18
tormented 18
until 18
no 18
bits 18
of 18
his 18
former 18
self 18
will 18
ever 18
emerge 18
again 18
for 18
some 18
reason 18
the 18
last 18
stanza 18
to 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
starts 18
running 18
through 18
my 18
head 18
the 18
one 18
where 18
the 18
man 18
wants 18
his 18
lover 18
dead 18
rather 18
than 18
have 18
her 18
face 18
the 18
evil 18
that 18
awaits 18
her 18
in 18
the 18
world 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
wear 18
a 18
necklace 18
of 18
rope 18
side 18
by 18
side 18
with 18
me 18
strange 18
things 18
did 18
happen 18
here 18
no 18
stranger 18
would 18
it 18
be 18
if 18
we 18
met 18
up 18
at 18
midnight 18
in 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
ill 18
kill 18
you 18
before 18
that 18
happens 18
says 18
gale 18
i 18
promise 18
peeta 18
hesitates 18
as 18
if 18
considering 18
the 18
reliability 18
of 18
this 18
offer 18
and 18
then 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
its 18
no 18
good 18
what 18
if 18
youre 18
not 18
there 18
to 18
do 18
it 18
i 18
want 18
one 18
of 18
those 18
poison 18
pills 18
like 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
you 18
have 18
nightlock 18
theres 18
one 18
pill 18
back 18
at 18
camp 18
in 18
its 18
special 18
slot 18
on 18
the 18
sleeve 18
of 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
suit 18
but 18
theres 18
another 18
in 18
the 18
breast 18
pocket 18
of 18
my 18
uniform 18
interesting 18
that 18
they 18
didnt 18
issue 18
one 18
to 18
peeta 18
perhaps 18
coin 18
thought 18
he 18
might 18
take 18
it 18
before 18
he 18
had 18
the 18
opportunity 18
to 18
kill 18
me 18
its 18
unclear 18
if 18
peeta 18
means 18
hed 18
finish 18
himself 18
off 18
now 18
to 18
spare 18
us 18
having 18
to 18
murder 18
him 18
or 18
only 18
if 18
the 18
capitol 18
took 18
him 18
prisoner 18
again 18
in 18
the 18
state 18
hes 18
in 18
i 18
expect 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
sooner 18
rather 18
than 18
later 18
it 18
would 18
certainly 18
make 18
things 18
easier 18
on 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
not 18
to 18
have 18
to 18
shoot 18
him 18
it 18
would 18
certainly 18
simplify 18
the 18
problem 18
of 18
dealing 18
with 18
his 18
homicidal 18
episodes 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
if 18
its 18
the 18
pods 18
or 18
the 18
fear 18
or 18
watching 18
boggs 18
die 18
but 18
i 18
feel 18
the 18
arena 18
all 18
around 18
me 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
ive 18
never 18
left 18
really 18
once 18
again 18
im 18
battling 18
not 18
only 18
for 18
my 18
own 18
survival 18
but 18
for 18
peetas 18
as 18
well 18
how 18
satisfying 18
how 18
entertaining 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
for 18
snow 18
to 18
have 18
me 18
kill 18
him 18
to 18
have 18
peetas 18
death 18
on 18
my 18
conscience 18
for 18
whatever 18
is 18
left 18
of 18
my 18
life 18
its 18
not 18
about 18
you 18
i 18
say 18
were 18
on 18
a 18
mission 18
and 18
youre 18
necessary 18
to 18
it 18
i 18
look 18
to 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
group 18
think 18
we 18
might 18
find 18
some 18
food 18
here 18
besides 18
the 18
medical 18
kit 18
and 18
cameras 18
we 18
have 18
nothing 18
but 18
our 18
uniforms 18
and 18
our 18
weapons 18
half 18
of 18
us 18
stay 18
to 18
guard 18
peeta 18
or 18
keep 18
an 18
eye 18
out 18
for 18
snows 18
broadcast 18
while 18
the 18
others 18
hunt 18
for 18
something 18
to 18
eat 18
messalla 18
proves 18
most 18
valuable 18
because 18
he 18
lived 18
in 18
a 18
near 18
replica 18
of 18
this 18
apartment 18
and 18
knows 18
where 18
people 18
would 18
be 18
most 18
likely 18
to 18
stash 18
food 18
like 18
how 18
theres 18
a 18
storage 18
space 18
concealed 18
by 18
a 18
mirrored 18
panel 18
in 18
the 18
bedroom 18
or 18
how 18
easy 18
it 18
is 18
to 18
pop 18
out 18
the 18
ventilation 18
screen 18
in 18
the 18
hallway 18
so 18
even 18
though 18
the 18
kitchen 18
cupboards 18
are 18
bare 18
we 18
find 18
over 18
thirty 18
canned 18
goods 18
and 18
several 18
boxes 18
of 18
cookies 18
the 18
hoarding 18
disgusts 18
the 18
soldiers 18
raised 18
in 18
isnt 18
this 18
illegal 18
says 18
leeg 18
on 18
the 18
contrary 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
youd 18
be 18
considered 18
stupid 18
not 18
to 18
do 18
it 18
says 18
messalla 18
even 18
before 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
people 18
were 18
starting 18
to 18
stock 18
up 18
on 18
scarce 18
supplies 18
while 18
others 18
went 18
without 18
says 18
leeg 18
right 18
says 18
messalla 18
thats 18
how 18
it 18
works 18
here 18
fortunately 18
or 18
we 18
wouldnt 18
have 18
dinner 18
says 18
gale 18
everybody 18
grab 18
a 18
can 18
some 18
of 18
our 18
company 18
seem 18
reluctant 18
to 18
do 18
this 18
but 18
its 18
as 18
good 18
a 18
method 18
as 18
any 18
im 18
really 18
not 18
in 18
the 18
mood 18
to 18
divvy 18
up 18
everything 18
into 18
eleven 18
equal 18
parts 18
factoring 18
in 18
age 18
body 18
weight 18
and 18
physical 18
output 18
i 18
poke 18
around 18
in 18
the 18
pile 18
about 18
to 18
settle 18
on 18
some 18
cod 18
chowder 18
when 18
peeta 18
holds 18
out 18
a 18
can 18
to 18
me 18
here 18
i 18
take 18
it 18
not 18
knowing 18
what 18
to 18
expect 18
the 18
label 18
reads 18
lamb 18
stew 18
i 18
press 18
my 18
lips 18
together 18
at 18
the 18
memories 18
of 18
rain 18
dripping 18
through 18
stones 18
my 18
inept 18
attempts 18
at 18
flirting 18
and 18
the 18
aroma 18
of 18
my 18
favorite 18
capitol 18
dish 18
in 18
the 18
chilly 18
air 18
so 18
some 18
part 18
of 18
it 18
must 18
still 18
be 18
in 18
his 18
head 18
too 18
how 18
happy 18
how 18
hungry 18
how 18
close 18
we 18
were 18
when 18
that 18
picnic 18
basket 18
arrived 18
outside 18
our 18
cave 18
thanks 18
i 18
pop 18
open 18
the 18
top 18
it 18
even 18
has 18
dried 18
plums 18
i 18
bend 18
the 18
lid 18
and 18
use 18
it 18
as 18
a 18
makeshift 18
spoon 18
scooping 18
a 18
bit 18
into 18
my 18
mouth 18
now 18
this 18
place 18
tastes 18
like 18
the 18
arena 18
too 18
were 18
passing 18
around 18
a 18
box 18
of 18
fancy 18
creamfilled 18
cookies 18
when 18
the 18
beeping 18
starts 18
again 18
the 18
seal 18
of 18
panem 18
lights 18
up 18
on 18
the 18
screen 18
and 18
remains 18
there 18
while 18
the 18
anthem 18
plays 18
and 18
then 18
they 18
begin 18
to 18
show 18
images 18
of 18
the 18
dead 18
just 18
as 18
they 18
did 18
with 18
the 18
tributes 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
they 18
start 18
with 18
the 18
four 18
faces 18
of 18
our 18
tv 18
crew 18
followed 18
by 18
boggs 18
gale 18
finnick 18
peeta 18
and 18
me 18
except 18
for 18
boggs 18
they 18
dont 18
bother 18
with 18
the 18
soldiers 18
from 18
either 18
because 18
they 18
have 18
no 18
idea 18
who 18
they 18
are 18
or 18
because 18
they 18
know 18
they 18
wont 18
mean 18
anything 18
to 18
the 18
audience 18
then 18
the 18
man 18
himself 18
appears 18
seated 18
at 18
his 18
desk 18
a 18
flag 18
draped 18
behind 18
him 18
the 18
fresh 18
white 18
rose 18
gleaming 18
in 18
his 18
lapel 18
i 18
think 18
he 18
might 18
have 18
recently 18
had 18
more 18
work 18
done 18
because 18
his 18
lips 18
are 18
puffier 18
than 18
usual 18
and 18
his 18
prep 18
team 18
really 18
needs 18
to 18
use 18
a 18
lighter 18
hand 18
with 18
his 18
blush 18
snow 18
congratulates 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
on 18
a 18
masterful 18
job 18
honors 18
them 18
for 18
ridding 18
the 18
country 18
of 18
the 18
menace 18
called 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
with 18
my 18
death 18
he 18
predicts 18
a 18
turning 18
of 18
the 18
tide 18
in 18
the 18
war 18
since 18
the 18
demoralized 18
rebels 18
have 18
no 18
one 18
left 18
to 18
follow 18
and 18
what 18
was 18
i 18
really 18
a 18
poor 18
unstable 18
girl 18
with 18
a 18
small 18
talent 18
with 18
a 18
bow 18
and 18
arrow 18
not 18
a 18
great 18
thinker 18
not 18
the 18
mastermind 18
of 18
the 18
rebellion 18
merely 18
a 18
face 18
plucked 18
from 18
the 18
rabble 18
because 18
i 18
had 18
caught 18
the 18
nations 18
attention 18
with 18
my 18
antics 18
in 18
the 18
games 18
but 18
necessary 18
so 18
very 18
necessary 18
because 18
the 18
rebels 18
have 18
no 18
real 18
leader 18
among 18
them 18
somewhere 18
in 18
district 18
beetee 18
hits 18
a 18
switch 18
because 18
now 18
its 18
not 18
president 18
snow 18
but 18
president 18
coin 18
whos 18
looking 18
at 18
us 18
she 18
introduces 18
herself 18
to 18
panem 18
identifies 18
herself 18
as 18
the 18
head 18
of 18
the 18
rebellion 18
and 18
then 18
gives 18
my 18
eulogy 18
praise 18
for 18
the 18
girl 18
who 18
survived 18
the 18
seam 18
and 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
then 18
turned 18
a 18
country 18
of 18
slaves 18
into 18
an 18
army 18
of 18
freedom 18
fighters 18
dead 18
or 18
alive 18
katniss 18
everdeen 18
will 18
remain 18
the 18
face 18
of 18
this 18
rebellion 18
if 18
ever 18
you 18
waver 18
in 18
your 18
resolve 18
think 18
of 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
and 18
in 18
her 18
you 18
will 18
find 18
the 18
strength 18
you 18
need 18
to 18
rid 18
panem 18
of 18
its 18
oppressors 18
i 18
had 18
no 18
idea 18
how 18
much 18
i 18
meant 18
to 18
her 18
i 18
say 18
which 18
brings 18
a 18
laugh 18
from 18
gale 18
and 18
questioning 18
looks 18
from 18
the 18
others 18
up 18
comes 18
a 18
heavily 18
doctored 18
photo 18
of 18
me 18
looking 18
beautiful 18
and 18
fierce 18
with 18
a 18
bunch 18
of 18
flames 18
flickering 18
behind 18
me 18
no 18
words 18
no 18
slogan 18
my 18
face 18
is 18
all 18
they 18
need 18
now 18
beetee 18
gives 18
the 18
reins 18
back 18
to 18
a 18
very 18
controlled 18
snow 18
i 18
have 18
the 18
feeling 18
the 18
president 18
thought 18
the 18
emergency 18
channel 18
was 18
impenetrable 18
and 18
someone 18
will 18
end 18
up 18
dead 18
tonight 18
because 18
it 18
was 18
breached 18
tomorrow 18
morning 18
when 18
we 18
pull 18
katniss 18
everdeens 18
body 18
from 18
the 18
ashes 18
we 18
will 18
see 18
exactly 18
who 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
is 18
a 18
dead 18
girl 18
who 18
could 18
save 18
no 18
one 18
not 18
even 18
herself 18
seal 18
anthem 18
and 18
out 18
except 18
that 18
you 18
wont 18
find 18
her 18
says 18
finnick 18
to 18
the 18
empty 18
screen 18
voicing 18
what 18
were 18
all 18
probably 18
thinking 18
the 18
grace 18
period 18
will 18
be 18
brief 18
once 18
they 18
dig 18
through 18
those 18
ashes 18
and 18
come 18
up 18
missing 18
eleven 18
bodies 18
theyll 18
know 18
we 18
escaped 18
we 18
can 18
get 18
a 18
head 18
start 18
on 18
them 18
at 18
least 18
i 18
say 18
suddenly 18
im 18
so 18
tired 18
all 18
i 18
want 18
is 18
to 18
lie 18
down 18
on 18
a 18
nearby 18
green 18
plush 18
sofa 18
and 18
go 18
to 18
sleep 18
to 18
cocoon 18
myself 18
in 18
a 18
comforter 18
made 18
of 18
rabbit 18
fur 18
and 18
goose 18
down 18
instead 18
i 18
pull 18
out 18
the 18
holo 18
and 18
insist 18
that 18
jackson 18
talk 18
me 18
through 18
the 18
most 18
basic 18
commandswhich 18
are 18
really 18
about 18
entering 18
the 18
coordinates 18
of 18
the 18
nearest 18
map 18
grid 18
intersectionso 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
at 18
least 18
begin 18
to 18
operate 18
the 18
thing 18
myself 18
as 18
the 18
holo 18
projects 18
our 18
surroundings 18
i 18
feel 18
my 18
heart 18
sink 18
even 18
further 18
we 18
must 18
be 18
moving 18
closer 18
to 18
crucial 18
targets 18
because 18
the 18
number 18
of 18
pods 18
has 18
noticeably 18
increased 18
how 18
can 18
we 18
possibly 18
move 18
forward 18
into 18
this 18
bouquet 18
of 18
blinking 18
lights 18
without 18
detection 18
we 18
cant 18
and 18
if 18
we 18
cant 18
we 18
are 18
trapped 18
like 18
birds 18
in 18
a 18
net 18
i 18
decide 18
its 18
best 18
not 18
to 18
adopt 18
some 18
sort 18
of 18
superior 18
attitude 18
when 18
im 18
with 18
these 18
people 18
especially 18
when 18
my 18
eyes 18
keep 18
drifting 18
to 18
that 18
green 18
sofa 18
so 18
i 18
say 18
any 18
ideas 18
why 18
dont 18
we 18
start 18
by 18
ruling 18
out 18
possibilities 18
says 18
finnick 18
the 18
street 18
is 18
not 18
a 18
possibility 18
the 18
rooftops 18
are 18
just 18
as 18
bad 18
as 18
the 18
street 18
says 18
leeg 18
we 18
still 18
might 18
have 18
a 18
chance 18
to 18
withdraw 18
go 18
back 18
the 18
way 18
we 18
came 18
says 18
homes 18
but 18
that 18
would 18
mean 18
a 18
failed 18
mission 18
a 18
pang 18
of 18
guilt 18
hits 18
me 18
since 18
ive 18
fabricated 18
said 18
mission 18
it 18
was 18
never 18
intended 18
for 18
all 18
of 18
us 18
to 18
go 18
forward 18
you 18
just 18
had 18
the 18
misfortune 18
to 18
be 18
with 18
me 18
well 18
thats 18
a 18
moot 18
point 18
were 18
with 18
you 18
now 18
says 18
jackson 18
so 18
we 18
cant 18
stay 18
put 18
we 18
cant 18
move 18
up 18
we 18
cant 18
move 18
laterally 18
i 18
think 18
that 18
just 18
leaves 18
one 18
option 18
underground 18
says 18
gale 18
underground 18
which 18
i 18
hate 18
like 18
mines 18
and 18
tunnels 18
and 18
underground 18
where 18
i 18
dread 18
dying 18
which 18
is 18
stupid 18
because 18
even 18
if 18
i 18
die 18
aboveground 18
the 18
next 18
thing 18
theyll 18
do 18
is 18
bury 18
me 18
underground 18
anyway 18
the 18
holo 18
can 18
show 18
subterranean 18
as 18
well 18
as 18
streetlevel 18
pods 18
i 18
see 18
that 18
when 18
we 18
go 18
underground 18
the 18
clean 18
dependable 18
lines 18
of 18
the 18
street 18
plan 18
are 18
interlaced 18
with 18
a 18
twisting 18
turning 18
mess 18
of 18
tunnels 18
the 18
pods 18
look 18
less 18
numerous 18
though 18
two 18
doors 18
down 18
a 18
vertical 18
tube 18
connects 18
our 18
row 18
of 18
apartments 18
to 18
the 18
tunnels 18
to 18
reach 18
the 18
tube 18
apartment 18
we 18
will 18
need 18
to 18
squeeze 18
through 18
a 18
maintenance 18
shaft 18
that 18
runs 18
the 18
length 18
of 18
the 18
building 18
we 18
can 18
enter 18
the 18
shaft 18
through 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
a 18
closet 18
space 18
on 18
the 18
upper 18
floor 18
okay 18
then 18
lets 18
make 18
it 18
look 18
like 18
weve 18
never 18
been 18
here 18
i 18
say 18
we 18
erase 18
all 18
signs 18
of 18
our 18
stay 18
send 18
the 18
empty 18
cans 18
down 18
a 18
trash 18
chute 18
pocket 18

on 18
the 18
front 18

we 18
lock 18
a 18
second 18
bolt 18

least 18
keep 18
the 18
door 18
from 18
swinging 18
open 18
on 18

buries 18
his 18
face 18
in 18
his 18
hands 18
for 18
a 18
few 18
moments 18
then 18
rises 18
to 18
join 18
us 18
should 18
we 18
free 18
his 18
hands 18
asks 18
leeg 18
no 18
peeta 18
growls 18
at 18
her 18
drawing 18
his 18
cuffs 18
in 18
close 18
to 18
his 18
body 18
no 18
i 18
echo 18
but 18
i 18
want 18
the 18
key 18
jackson 18
passes 18
it 18
over 18
without 18
a 18
word 18
i 18
slip 18
it 18
into 18
my 18
pants 18
pocket 18
where 18
it 18
clicks 18
against 18
the 18
pearl 18
when 18
homes 18
pries 18
open 18
the 18
small 18
metal 18
door 18
to 18
the 18
maintenance 18
shaft 18
we 18
encounter 18
another 18
problem 18
theres 18
no 18
way 18
the 18
insect 18
shells 18
will 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
fit 18
through 18
the 18
narrow 18
passage 18
castor 18
and 18
pollux 18
remove 18
them 18
and 18
detach 18
emergency 18
backup 18
cameras 18
each 18
is 18
the 18
size 18
of 18
a 18
shoe 18
box 18
and 18
probably 18
works 18
about 18
as 18
well 18
messalla 18
cant 18
think 18
of 18
anywhere 18
better 18
to 18
hide 18
the 18
bulky 18
shells 18
so 18
we 18
end 18
up 18
dumping 18
them 18
in 18
the 18
closet 18
leaving 18
such 18
an 18
easy 18
trail 18
to 18
follow 18
frustrates 18
me 18
but 18
what 18
else 18
can 18
we 18
do 18
even 18
going 18
single 18
file 18
holding 18
our 18
packs 18
and 18
gear 18
out 18
to 18
the 18
side 18
its 18
a 18
tight 18
fit 18
we 18
sidestep 18
our 18
way 18
past 18
the 18
first 18
apartment 18
and 18
break 18
into 18
the 18
second 18
in 18
this 18
apartment 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
bedrooms 18
has 18
a 18
door 18
marked 18
utility 18
instead 18
of 18
a 18
bathroom 18
behind 18
the 18
door 18
is 18
the 18
room 18
with 18
the 18
entrance 18
to 18
the 18
tube 18
messalla 18
frowns 18
at 18
the 18
wide 18
circular 18
cover 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
returning 18
to 18
his 18
own 18
fussy 18
world 18
its 18
why 18
no 18
one 18
ever 18
wants 18
the 18
center 18
unit 18
workmen 18
coming 18
and 18
going 18
whenever 18
and 18
no 18
second 18
bath 18
but 18
the 18
rents 18
considerably 18
cheaper 18
then 18
he 18
notices 18
finnicks 18
amused 18
expression 18
and 18
adds 18
never 18

the 18

covers 18
simple 18
to 18
unlatch 18
a 18
wide 18
ladder 18
with 18
rubber 18
treads 18
on 18
the 18
steps 18
allows 18
for 18
a 18
swift 18
easy 18
descent 18
into 18
the 18
bowels 18
of 18
the 18
city 18
we 18
gather 18
at 18
the 18
foot 18
of 18
the 18
ladder 18
waiting 18
for 18
our 18
eyes 18
to 18
adjust 18
to 18
the 18
dim 18
strips 18
of 18
lights 18
breathing 18
in 18
the 18
mixture 18
of 18

pollux 18
pale 18

reaches 18
out 18
and 18
latches 18
on 18
to 18
castors 18
wrist 18
like 18
he 18
might 18
fall 18
over 18
if 18
there 18
isnt 18
someone 18
to 18
steady 18
him 18
my 18
brother 18
worked 18
down 18
here 18
after 18
he 18
became 18
an 18
avox 18
says 18
castor 18
of 18
course 18
who 18
else 18
would 18
they 18
get 18
to 18
maintain 18
these 18
dank 18
evilsmelling 18
passages 18
mined 18
with 18
pods 18
took 18
five 18
years 18
before 18
we 18
were 18
able 18
to 18
buy 18
his 18
way 18
up 18
to 18
ground 18
level 18
didnt 18
see 18
the 18
sun 18
once 18
under 18
better 18
conditions 18
on 18
a 18
day 18
with 18
fewer 18
horrors 18
and 18
more 18
rest 18
someone 18
would 18
surely 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
say 18
instead 18
we 18
all 18
stand 18
there 18
for 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
trying 18
to 18
formulate 18
a 18
response 18
finally 18
peeta 18
turns 18
to 18
pollux 18
well 18
then 18
you 18
just 18
became 18
our 18
most 18
valuable 18
asset 18
castor 18
laughs 18
and 18
pollux 18
manages 18
a 18
smile 18
were 18
halfway 18
down 18
the 18
first 18
tunnel 18
when 18
i 18
realize 18
what 18
was 18
so 18
remarkable 18
about 18
the 18
exchange 18
peeta 18
sounded 18
like 18
his 18
old 18
self 18
the 18
one 18
who 18
could 18
always 18
think 18
of 18
the 18
right 18
thing 18
to 18
say 18
when 18
nobody 18
else 18
could 18
ironic 18
encouraging 18
a 18
little 18
funny 18
but 18
not 18
at 18
anyones 18
expense 18
i 18
glance 18
back 18
at 18
him 18
as 18
he 18
trudges 18
along 18
under 18
his 18
guards 18
gale 18
and 18
jackson 18
his 18
eyes 18
fixed 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
his 18
shoulders 18
hunched 18
forward 18
so 18
dispirited 18
but 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
he 18
was 18
really 18
here 18
peeta 18
called 18
it 18
right 18
pollux 18
turns 18
out 18
to 18
be 18
worth 18
ten 18
holos 18
there 18
is 18
a 18
simple 18
network 18
of 18
wide 18
tunnels 18
that 18
directly 18
corresponds 18
to 18
the 18
main 18
street 18
plan 18
above 18
underlying 18
the 18
major 18
avenues 18
and 18
cross 18
streets 18
its 18
called 18
the 18
transfer 18
since 18
small 18
trucks 18
use 18
it 18
to 18
deliver 18
goods 18
around 18
the 18
city 18
during 18
the 18
day 18
its 18
many 18
pods 18
are 18
deactivated 18
but 18
at 18
night 18
its 18
a 18
minefield 18
however 18
hundreds 18
of 18
additional 18
passages 18
utility 18
shafts 18
train 18
tracks 18
and 18
drainage 18
tubes 18
form 18
a 18
multilevel 18
maze 18
pollux 18
knows 18
details 18
that 18
would 18
lead 18
to 18
disaster 18
for 18
a 18
newcomer 18
like 18
which 18
offshoots 18
might 18
require 18
gas 18
masks 18
or 18
have 18
live 18
wires 18
or 18
rats 18
the 18
size 18
of 18
beavers 18
he 18
alerts 18
us 18
to 18
the 18
gush 18
of 18
water 18
that 18
sweeps 18
through 18
the 18
sewers 18
periodically 18
anticipates 18
the 18
time 18
the 18
avoxes 18
will 18
be 18
changing 18
shifts 18
leads 18
us 18
into 18
damp 18
obscure 18
pipes 18
to 18
dodge 18
the 18
nearly 18
silent 18
passage 18
of 18
cargo 18
trains 18
most 18
important 18
he 18
has 18
knowledge 18
of 18
the 18
cameras 18
there 18
arent 18
many 18
down 18
in 18
this 18
gloomy 18
misty 18
place 18
except 18
in 18
the 18
transfer 18
but 18
we 18
keep 18
well 18
out 18
of 18
their 18
way 18
under 18
polluxs 18
guidance 18
we 18
make 18
good 18
time 18
remarkable 18
time 18
if 18
you 18
compare 18
it 18
to 18
our 18
aboveground 18
travel 18
after 18
about 18
six 18
hours 18
fatigue 18
takes 18
over 18
its 18
three 18
in 18
the 18
morning 18
so 18
i 18
figure 18
we 18
still 18
have 18
a 18
few 18
hours 18
before 18
our 18
bodies 18
are 18
discovered 18
missing 18
they 18
search 18
through 18
the 18
rubble 18
of 18
the 18
whole 18
block 18
of 18
apartments 18
in 18
case 18
we 18
tried 18
to 18
escape 18
through 18
the 18
shafts 18
and 18
the 18
hunt 18
begins 18
when 18
i 18
suggest 18
we 18
rest 18
no 18
one 18
objects 18
pollux 18
finds 18
a 18
small 18
warm 18
room 18
humming 18
with 18
machines 18
loaded 18
with 18
levers 18
and 18
dials 18
he 18
holds 18
up 18
his 18
fingers 18
to 18
indicate 18
we 18
must 18
be 18
gone 18
in 18
four 18
hours 18
jackson 18
works 18
out 18
a 18
guard 18
schedule 18
and 18
since 18
im 18
not 18
on 18
the 18
first 18
shift 18
i 18
wedge 18
myself 18
in 18
the 18
tight 18
space 18
between 18
gale 18
and 18
leeg 18
and 18
go 18
right 18
to 18
sleep 18
it 18
seems 18
like 18
only 18
minutes 18
later 18
when 18
jackson 18
shakes 18
me 18
awake 18
tells 18
me 18
im 18
on 18
watch 18
its 18
six 18
oclock 18
and 18
in 18
one 18
hour 18
we 18
must 18
be 18
on 18
our 18
way 18
jackson 18
tells 18
me 18
to 18
eat 18
a 18
can 18
of 18
food 18
and 18
keep 18
an 18
eye 18
on 18
pollux 18
whos 18
insisted 18
on 18
being 18
on 18
guard 18
the 18
entire 18
night 18
he 18
cant 18
sleep 18
down 18
here 18
i 18
drag 18
myself 18
into 18
a 18
state 18
of 18
relative 18
alertness 18
eat 18
a 18
can 18
of 18
potato 18
and 18
bean 18
stew 18
and 18
sit 18
against 18
the 18
wall 18
facing 18
the 18
door 18
pollux 18
seems 18
wide 18
awake 18
hes 18
probably 18
been 18
reliving 18
those 18
five 18
years 18
of 18
imprisonment 18
all 18
night 18
i 18
get 18
out 18
the 18
holo 18
and 18
manage 18
to 18
input 18
our 18
grid 18
coordinates 18
and 18
scan 18
the 18
tunnels 18
as 18
expected 18
more 18
pods 18
are 18
registering 18
the 18
closer 18
we 18
move 18
toward 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
pollux 18
and 18
i 18
click 18
around 18
on 18
the 18
holo 18
seeing 18
what 18
traps 18
lie 18
where 18
when 18
my 18
head 18
begins 18
to 18
spin 18
i 18
hand 18
it 18
over 18
to 18
him 18
and 18
lean 18
back 18
against 18
the 18
wall 18
i 18
look 18
down 18
at 18
the 18
sleeping 18
soldiers 18
crew 18
and 18
friends 18
and 18
i 18
wonder 18
how 18
many 18
of 18
us 18
will 18
ever 18
see 18
the 18
sun 18
again 18
when 18
my 18
eyes 18
fall 18
on 18
peeta 18
whose 18
head 18
rests 18
right 18
by 18
my 18
feet 18
i 18
see 18
hes 18
awake 18
i 18
wish 18
i 18
could 18
read 18
whats 18
going 18
on 18
in 18
his 18
mind 18
that 18
i 18
could 18
go 18
in 18
and 18
untangle 18
the 18
mess 18
of 18
lies 18
then 18
i 18
settle 18
for 18
something 18
i 18
can 18
accomplish 18
have 18
you 18
eaten 18
i 18
ask 18
a 18
slight 18
shake 18
of 18
his 18
head 18
indicates 18
he 18
hasnt 18
i 18
open 18
a 18
can 18
of 18
chicken 18
and 18
rice 18
soup 18
and 18
hand 18
it 18
to 18
him 18
keeping 18
the 18
lid 18
in 18
case 18
he 18
tries 18
to 18
slit 18
his 18
wrists 18
with 18
it 18
or 18
something 18
he 18
sits 18
up 18
and 18
tilts 18
the 18
can 18
chugging 18
back 18
the 18
soup 18
without 18
really 18
bothering 18
to 18
chew 18
it 18
the 18
bottom 18
of 18
the 18
can 18
reflects 18
the 18
lights 18
from 18
the 18
machines 18
and 18
i 18
remember 18
something 18
thats 18
been 18
itching 18
at 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
my 18
mind 18
since 18
yesterday 18
peeta 18
when 18
you 18
asked 18
about 18
what 18
happened 18
to 18
darius 18
and 18
lavinia 18
and 18
boggs 18
told 18
you 18
it 18
was 18
real 18
you 18
said 18
you 18
thought 18
so 18
because 18
there 18
was 18
nothing 18
shiny 18
about 18
it 18
what 18
did 18
you 18
mean 18
oh 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
exactly 18
how 18
to 18
explain 18
it 18
he 18
tells 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
beginning 18
everything 18
was 18
just 18
complete 18
confusion 18
now 18
i 18
can 18
sort 18
certain 18
things 18
out 18
i 18
think 18
theres 18
a 18
pattern 18
emerging 18
the 18
memories 18
they 18
altered 18
with 18
the 18
tracker 18
jacker 18
venom 18
have 18
this 18
strange 18
quality 18
about 18
them 18
like 18
theyre 18
too 18
intense 18
or 18
the 18
images 18
arent 18
stable 18
you 18
remember 18
what 18
it 18
was 18
like 18
when 18
we 18
were 18
stung 18
trees 18
shattered 18
there 18
were 18
giant 18
colored 18
butterflies 18
i 18
fell 18
in 18
a 18
pit 18
of 18
orange 18
bubbles 18
i 18
think 18
about 18
it 18
shiny 18
orange 18
bubbles 18
right 18
but 18
nothing 18
about 18
darius 18
or 18
lavinia 18
was 18
like 18
that 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
theyd 18
given 18
me 18
any 18
venom 18
yet 18
he 18
says 18
well 18
thats 18
good 18
isnt 18
it 18
i 18
ask 18
if 18
you 18
can 18
separate 18
the 18
two 18
then 18
you 18
can 18
figure 18
out 18
whats 18
true 18
yes 18
and 18
if 18
i 18
could 18
grow 18
wings 18
i 18
could 18
fly 18
only 18
people 18
cant 18
grow 18
wings 18
he 18
says 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
real 18
i 18
say 18
but 18
people 18
dont 18
need 18
wings 18
to 18
survive 18
mockingjays 18
do 18
he 18
finishes 18
the 18
soup 18
and 18
returns 18
the 18
can 18
to 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
fluorescent 18
light 18
the 18
circles 18
under 18
his 18
eyes 18
look 18
like 18
bruises 18
theres 18
still 18
time 18
you 18
should 18
sleep 18
unresisting 18
he 18
lies 18
back 18
down 18
but 18
just 18
stares 18
at 18
the 18
needle 18
on 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
dials 18
as 18
it 18
twitches 18
from 18
side 18
to 18
side 18
slowly 18
as 18
i 18
would 18
with 18
a 18
wounded 18
animal 18
my 18
hand 18
stretches 18
out 18
and 18
brushes 18
a 18
wave 18
of 18
hair 18
from 18
his 18
forehead 18
he 18
freezes 18
at 18
my 18
touch 18
but 18
doesnt 18
recoil 18
so 18
i 18
continue 18
to 18
gently 18
smooth 18
back 18
his 18
hair 18
its 18
the 18
first 18
time 18
i 18
have 18
voluntarily 18
touched 18
him 18
since 18
the 18
last 18
arena 18
youre 18
still 18
trying 18
to 18
protect 18
me 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
he 18
whispers 18
real 18
i 18
answer 18
it 18
seems 18
to 18
require 18
more 18
explanation 18
because 18
thats 18
what 18
you 18
and 18
i 18
do 18
protect 18
each 18
other 18
after 18
a 18
minute 18
or 18
so 18
he 18
drifts 18
off 18
to 18
sleep 18
shortly 18
before 18
seven 18
pollux 18
and 18
i 18
move 18
among 18
the 18
others 18
rousing 18
them 18
there 18
are 18
the 18
usual 18
yawns 18
and 18
sighs 18
that 18
accompany 18
waking 18
but 18
my 18
ears 18
are 18
picking 18
up 18
something 18
else 18
too 18
almost 18
like 18
a 18
hissing 18
perhaps 18
its 18
only 18
steam 18
escaping 18
a 18
pipe 18
or 18
the 18
faroff 18
whoosh 18
of 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
trains 18
i 18
hush 18
the 18
group 18
to 18
get 18
a 18
better 18
read 18
on 18
it 18
theres 18
a 18
hissing 18
yes 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
one 18
extended 18
sound 18
more 18
like 18
multiple 18
exhalations 18
that 18
form 18
words 18
a 18
single 18
word 18
echoing 18
throughout 18
the 18
tunnels 18
one 18
word 18
one 18
name 18
repeated 18
over 18
and 18
over 18
again 18
katniss 18
the 18
grace 18
period 18
has 18
ended 18
perhaps 18
snow 18
had 18
them 18
digging 18
through 18
the 18
night 18
as 18
soon 18
as 18
the 18
fire 18
died 18
down 18
anyway 18
they 18
found 18
boggss 18
remains 18
briefly 18
felt 18
reassured 18
and 18
then 18
as 18
the 18
hours 18
went 18
by 18
without 18
further 18
trophies 18
began 18
to 18
suspect 18
at 18
some 18
point 18
they 18
realized 18
that 18
they 18
had 18
been 18
tricked 18
and 18
president 18
snow 18
cant 18
tolerate 18
being 18
made 18
to 18
look 18
like 18
a 18
fool 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
whether 18
they 18
tracked 18
us 18
to 18
the 18
second 18
apartment 18
or 18
assumed 18
we 18
went 18
directly 18
underground 18
they 18
know 18
we 18
are 18
down 18
here 18
now 18
and 18
theyve 18
unleashed 18
something 18
a 18
pack 18
of 18
mutts 18
probably 18
bent 18
on 18
finding 18
me 18
katniss 18
i 18
jump 18
at 18
the 18
proximity 18
of 18
the 18
sound 18
look 18
frantically 18
for 18
its 18
source 18
bow 18
loaded 18
seeking 18
a 18
target 18
to 18
hit 18
katniss 18
peetas 18
lips 18
are 18
barely 18
moving 18
but 18
theres 18
no 18
doubt 18
the 18
name 18
came 18
out 18
of 18
him 18
just 18
when 18
i 18
thought 18
he 18
seemed 18
a 18
little 18
better 18
when 18
i 18
thought 18
he 18
might 18
be 18
inching 18
his 18
way 18
back 18
to 18
me 18
here 18
is 18
proof 18
of 18
how 18
deep 18
snows 18
poison 18
went 18
katniss 18
peetas 18
programmed 18
to 18
respond 18
to 18
the 18
hissing 18
chorus 18
to 18
join 18
in 18
the 18
hunt 18
hes 18
beginning 18
to 18
stir 18
theres 18
no 18
choice 18
i 18
position 18
my 18
arrow 18
to 18
penetrate 18
his 18
brain 18
hell 18
barely 18
feel 18
a 18
thing 18
suddenly 18
hes 18
sitting 18
up 18
eyes 18
wide 18
in 18
alarm 18
short 18
of 18
breath 18
katniss 18
he 18
whips 18
his 18
head 18
toward 18
me 18
but 18
doesnt 18
seem 18
to 18
notice 18
my 18
bow 18
the 18
waiting 18
arrow 18
katniss 18
get 18
out 18
of 18
here 18
i 18
hesitate 18
his 18
voice 18
is 18
alarmed 18
but 18
not 18
insane 18
why 18
whats 18
making 18
that 18
sound 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
only 18
that 18
it 18
has 18
to 18
kill 18
you 18
says 18
peeta 18
run 18
get 18
out 18
go 18
after 18
my 18
own 18
moment 18
of 18
confusion 18
i 18
conclude 18
i 18
do 18
not 18
have 18
to 18
shoot 18
him 18
relax 18
my 18
bowstring 18
take 18
in 18
the 18
anxious 18
faces 18
around 18
me 18
whatever 18
it 18
is 18
its 18
after 18
me 18
it 18
might 18
be 18
a 18
good 18
time 18
to 18
split 18
up 18
but 18
were 18
your 18
guard 18
says 18
jackson 18
and 18
your 18
crew 18
adds 18
cressida 18
im 18
not 18
leaving 18
you 18
gale 18
says 18
i 18
look 18
at 18
the 18
crew 18
armed 18
with 18
nothing 18
but 18
cameras 18
and 18
clipboards 18
and 18
theres 18
finnick 18
with 18
two 18
guns 18
and 18
a 18
trident 18
i 18
suggest 18
that 18
he 18
give 18
one 18
of 18
his 18
guns 18
to 18
castor 18
eject 18
the 18
blank 18
cartridge 18
from 18
peetas 18
load 18
it 18
with 18
a 18
real 18
one 18
and 18
arm 18
pollux 18
since 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
our 18
bows 18
we 18
hand 18
our 18
guns 18
over 18
to 18
messalla 18
and 18
cressida 18
theres 18
no 18
time 18
to 18
show 18
them 18
anything 18
but 18
how 18
to 18
point 18
and 18
pull 18
the 18
trigger 18
but 18
in 18
close 18
quarters 18
that 18
might 18
be 18
enough 18
its 18
better 18
than 18
being 18
defenseless 18
now 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
without 18
a 18
weapon 18
is 18
peeta 18
but 18
anyone 18
whispering 18
my 18
name 18
with 18
a 18
bunch 18
of 18
mutts 18
doesnt 18
need 18
one 18
anyway 18
we 18
leave 18
the 18
room 18
free 18
of 18
everything 18
but 18
our 18
scent 18
theres 18
no 18
way 18
to 18
erase 18
that 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
im 18
guessing 18
thats 18
how 18
the 18
hissing 18
things 18
are 18
tracking 18
us 18
because 18
we 18
havent 18
left 18
much 18
of 18
a 18
physical 18
trail 18
the 18
mutts 18
noses 18
will 18
be 18
abnormally 18
keen 18
but 18
possibly 18
the 18
time 18
we 18
spent 18
slogging 18
through 18
water 18
in 18
drainpipes 18
will 18
help 18
throw 18
them 18
outside 18
the 18
hum 18
of 18
the 18
room 18
the 18
hissing 18
becomes 18
more 18
distinct 18
but 18
its 18
also 18
possible 18
to 18
get 18
a 18
better 18
sense 18
of 18
the 18
mutts 18
location 18
theyre 18
behind 18
us 18
still 18
a 18
fair 18
distance 18
snow 18
probably 18
had 18
them 18
released 18
underground 18
near 18
the 18
place 18
where 18
he 18
found 18
boggss 18
body 18
theoretically 18
we 18
should 18
have 18
a 18
good 18
lead 18
on 18
them 18
although 18
theyre 18
certain 18
to 18
be 18
much 18
faster 18
than 18
we 18
are 18
my 18
mind 18
wanders 18
to 18
the 18
wolflike 18
creatures 18
in 18
the 18
first 18
arena 18
the 18
monkeys 18
in 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
the 18
monstrosities 18
ive 18
witnessed 18
on 18
television 18
over 18
the 18
years 18
and 18
i 18
wonder 18
what 18
form 18
these 18
mutts 18
will 18
take 18
whatever 18
snow 18
thinks 18
will 18
scare 18
me 18
the 18
most 18
pollux 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
worked 18
out 18
a 18
plan 18
for 18
the 18
next 18
leg 18
of 18
our 18
journey 18
and 18
since 18
it 18
heads 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
hissing 18
i 18
see 18
no 18
reason 18
to 18
alter 18
it 18
if 18
we 18
move 18
swiftly 18
maybe 18
we 18
can 18
reach 18
snows 18
mansion 18
before 18
the 18
mutts 18
reach 18
us 18
but 18
theres 18
a 18
sloppiness 18
that 18
comes 18
with 18
speed 18
the 18
poorly 18
placed 18
boot 18
that 18
results 18
in 18
a 18
splash 18
the 18
accidental 18
clang 18
of 18
a 18
gun 18
against 18
a 18
pipe 18
even 18
my 18
own 18
commands 18
issued 18
too 18
loudly 18
for 18
discretion 18
weve 18
covered 18
about 18
three 18
more 18
blocks 18
via 18
an 18
overflow 18
pipe 18
and 18
a 18
section 18
of 18
neglected 18
train 18
track 18
when 18
the 18
screams 18
begin 18
thick 18
guttural 18
bouncing 18
off 18
the 18
tunnel 18
walls 18
avoxes 18
says 18
peeta 18
immediately 18
thats 18
what 18
darius 18
sounded 18
like 18
when 18
they 18
tortured 18
him 18
the 18
mutts 18
must 18
have 18
found 18
them 18
says 18
cressida 18
so 18
theyre 18
not 18
just 18
after 18
katniss 18
says 18
leeg 18
theyll 18
probably 18
kill 18
anyone 18
its 18
just 18
that 18
they 18
wont 18
stop 18
until 18
they 18
get 18
to 18
her 18
says 18
gale 18
after 18
his 18
hours 18
studying 18
with 18
beetee 18
he 18
is 18
most 18
likely 18
right 18
and 18
here 18
i 18
am 18
again 18
with 18
people 18
dying 18
because 18
of 18
me 18
friends 18
allies 18
complete 18
strangers 18
losing 18
their 18
lives 18
for 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
let 18
me 18
go 18
on 18
alone 18
lead 18
them 18
off 18
ill 18
transfer 18
the 18
holo 18
to 18
jackson 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
you 18
can 18
finish 18
the 18
mission 18
no 18
ones 18
going 18
to 18
agree 18
to 18
that 18
says 18
jackson 18
in 18
exasperation 18
were 18
wasting 18
time 18
says 18
finnick 18
listen 18
peeta 18
whispers 18
the 18
screams 18
have 18
stopped 18
and 18
in 18
their 18
absence 18
my 18
name 18
has 18
rebounded 18
startling 18
in 18
its 18
proximity 18
its 18
below 18
as 18
well 18
as 18
behind 18
us 18
now 18
katniss 18
i 18
nudge 18
pollux 18
on 18
the 18
shoulder 18
and 18
we 18
start 18
to 18
run 18
trouble 18
is 18
we 18
had 18
planned 18
to 18
descend 18
to 18
a 18
lower 18
level 18
but 18
thats 18
out 18
now 18
when 18
we 18
come 18
to 18
the 18
steps 18
leading 18
down 18
pollux 18
and 18
i 18
are 18
scanning 18
for 18
a 18
possible 18
alternative 18
on 18
the 18
holo 18
when 18
i 18
start 18
gagging 18
masks 18
on 18
orders 18
jackson 18
theres 18
no 18
need 18
for 18
masks 18
everyone 18
is 18
breathing 18
the 18
same 18
air 18
im 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
losing 18
my 18
stew 18
because 18
im 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
reacting 18
to 18
the 18
odor 18
drifting 18
up 18
from 18
the 18
stairwell 18
cutting 18
through 18
the 18
sewage 18
roses 18
i 18
begin 18
to 18
tremble 18
i 18
swerve 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
smell 18
and 18
stumble 18
right 18
out 18
onto 18
the 18
transfer 18
smooth 18
pastelcolored 18
tiled 18
streets 18
just 18
like 18
the 18
ones 18
above 18
but 18
bordered 18
by 18
white 18
brick 18
walls 18
instead 18
of 18
homes 18
a 18
roadway 18
where 18
delivery 18
vehicles 18
can 18
drive 18
with 18
ease 18
without 18
the 18
congestion 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
empty 18
now 18
of 18
everything 18
but 18
us 18
i 18
swing 18
up 18
my 18
bow 18
and 18
blow 18
up 18
the 18
first 18
pod 18
with 18
an 18
explosive 18
arrow 18
which 18
kills 18
the 18
nest 18
of 18
flesheating 18
rats 18
inside 18
then 18
i 18
sprint 18
for 18
the 18
next 18
intersection 18
where 18
i 18
know 18
one 18
false 18
step 18
will 18
cause 18
the 18
ground 18
beneath 18
our 18
feet 18
to 18
disintegrate 18
feeding 18
us 18
into 18
something 18
labeled 18
meat 18
grinder 18
i 18
shout 18
a 18
warning 18
to 18
the 18
others 18
to 18
stay 18
with 18
me 18
i 18
plan 18
for 18
us 18
to 18
skirt 18
around 18
the 18
corner 18
and 18
then 18
detonate 18
the 18
meat 18
grinder 18
but 18
another 18
unmarked 18
pod 18
lies 18
in 18
wait 18
it 18
happens 18
silently 18
i 18
would 18
miss 18
it 18
entirely 18
if 18
finnick 18
didnt 18
pull 18
me 18
to 18
a 18
stop 18
katniss 18
i 18
whip 18
back 18
around 18
arrow 18
poised 18
for 18
flight 18
but 18
what 18
can 18
be 18
done 18
two 18
of 18
gales 18
arrows 18
already 18
lie 18
useless 18
beside 18
the 18
wide 18
shaft 18
of 18
golden 18
light 18
that 18
radiates 18
from 18
ceiling 18
to 18
floor 18
inside 18
messalla 18
is 18
as 18
still 18
as 18
a 18
statue 18
poised 18
up 18
on 18
the 18
ball 18
of 18
one 18
foot 18
head 18
tilted 18
back 18
held 18
captive 18
by 18
the 18
beam 18
i 18
cant 18
tell 18
if 18
hes 18
yelling 18
although 18
his 18
mouth 18
is 18
stretched 18
wide 18
we 18
watch 18
utterly 18
helpless 18
as 18
the 18
flesh 18
melts 18
off 18
his 18
body 18
like 18
candle 18
wax 18
cant 18
help 18
him 18
peeta 18
starts 18
shoving 18
people 18
forward 18
cant 18
amazingly 18
hes 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
still 18
functional 18
enough 18
to 18
get 18
us 18
moving 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
why 18
hes 18
in 18
control 18
when 18
he 18
should 18
be 18
flipping 18
out 18
and 18
bashing 18
my 18
brains 18
in 18
but 18
that 18
could 18
happen 18
any 18
second 18
at 18
the 18
pressure 18
of 18
his 18
hand 18
against 18
my 18
shoulder 18
i 18
turn 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
grisly 18
thing 18
that 18
was 18
messalla 18
i 18
make 18
my 18
feet 18
go 18
forward 18
fast 18
so 18
fast 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
barely 18
skid 18
to 18
a 18
stop 18
before 18
the 18
next 18
intersection 18
a 18
spray 18
of 18
gunfire 18
brings 18
down 18
a 18
shower 18
of 18
plaster 18
i 18
jerk 18
my 18
head 18
from 18
side 18
to 18
side 18
looking 18
for 18
the 18
pod 18
before 18
i 18
turn 18
and 18
see 18
the 18
squad 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
pounding 18
down 18
the 18
transfer 18
toward 18
us 18
with 18
the 18
meat 18
grinder 18
pod 18
blocking 18
our 18
way 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
but 18
fire 18
back 18
they 18
outnumber 18
us 18
two 18
to 18
one 18
but 18
weve 18
still 18
got 18
six 18
original 18
members 18
of 18
the 18

the 18
same 18
time 18
fish 18
in 18
a 18
barrel 18
i 18
think 18
as 18

stain 18
their 18
white 18
uniforms 18
threequarters 18
of 18
them 18
are 18
down 18
and 18
dead 18
when 18
more 18
begin 18
to 18
pour 18
in 18
from 18
the 18

i 18
flung 18
myself 18

get 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
smell 18
from 18
the 18
those 18
arent 18
peacekeepers 18
they 18
are 18
white 18
fourlimbed 18
about 18
the 18
size 18
of 18
a 18
fullgrown 18
human 18
but 18
thats 18
where 18
the 18
comparisons 18
stop 18
naked 18
with 18
long 18
reptilian 18
tails 18
arched 18
backs 18

over 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
living 18

dead 18
clamp 18
on 18
to 18
their 18
necks 18
with 18
their 18
mouths 18
and 18
rip 18
off 18
the 18
helmeted 18
heads 18
apparently 18
having 18
a 18
capitol 18
pedigree 18
is 18
as 18
useless 18
here 18
as 18
it 18
was 18
in 18
it 18
seems 18
to 18
take 18
only 18
seconds 18
before 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
are 18
decapitated 18
the 18
mutts 18
fall 18
to 18
their 18
bellies 18
and 18
skitter 18
toward 18
us 18
on 18
all 18
fours 18
this 18
way 18
i 18
shout 18
hugging 18
the 18
wall 18
and 18
making 18
a 18
sharp 18
right 18
turn 18
to 18
avoid 18
the 18
pod 18
when 18
everyones 18
joined 18
me 18
i 18
fire 18
into 18
the 18

activates 18
huge 18
mechanical 18
teeth 18
burst 18
through 18
the 18
street 18
and 18
chew 18
the 18
tile 18
to 18
dust 18
that 18
should 18
make 18
it 18
impossible 18
for 18
the 18
mutts 18
to 18
follow 18
us 18

the 18
wolf 18
and 18
monkey 18
mutts 18
ive 18
encountered 18

leap 18
unbelievably 18
far 18
the 18
hissing 18
burns 18
my 18
ears 18
and 18
the 18
reek 18
of 18
roses 18
makes 18
the 18
walls 18
spin 18
i 18

for 18
about 18
ten 18
yards 18
along 18
the 18

and 18
go 18
through 18
a 18

them 18
look 18
homes 18
nods 18
to 18
the 18
pipe 18
where 18
the 18
mutts 18
are 18
slithering 18
onto 18
the 18

back 18
gale 18
shouts 18
with 18
his 18
explosivetipped 18
arrows 18
he 18
rips 18
the 18
far 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
bridge 18
from 18
its 18
foundation 18
the 18
rest 18
sinks 18
into 18
the 18
bubbles 18
just 18
as 18
the 18
mutts 18
reach 18
it 18
for 18
the 18
first 18
time 18
i 18
get 18
a 18
good 18
look 18
at 18
them 18
a 18
mix 18
of 18
human 18
and 18
lizard 18
and 18
who 18
knows 18
what 18
else 18
white 18
tight 18
reptilian 18
skin 18
smeared 18
with 18
gore 18
clawed 18
hands 18
and 18
feet 18
their 18
faces 18
a 18
mess 18
of 18
conflicting 18
features 18
hissing 18
shrieking 18
my 18
name 18
now 18
as 18
their 18
bodies 18
contort 18
in 18
rage 18
lashing 18
out 18
with 18
tails 18
and 18
claws 18
taking 18
huge 18
chunks 18
of 18
one 18
another 18
or 18
their 18
own 18
bodies 18
with 18
wide 18
lathered 18
mouths 18
driven 18
mad 18
by 18
their 18
need 18
to 18
destroy 18
me 18
my 18
scent 18
must 18
be 18
as 18
evocative 18
to 18
them 18
as 18
theirs 18
is 18
to 18
me 18
more 18
so 18
because 18
despite 18
its 18
toxicity 18
the 18
mutts 18
begin 18
to 18
throw 18
themselves 18
into 18
the 18
foul 18
sewer 18
along 18
our 18
bank 18
everyone 18
opens 18
fire 18
i 18
choose 18
my 18
arrows 18
without 18
discretion 18
sending 18
arrowheads 18
fire 18
explosives 18
into 18
the 18
mutts 18
bodies 18
theyre 18
mortal 18
but 18
only 18
just 18
no 18
natural 18
thing 18
could 18
keep 18
coming 18
with 18
two 18
dozen 18
bullets 18
in 18
it 18
yes 18
we 18
can 18
eventually 18
kill 18
them 18
only 18
there 18
are 18
so 18
many 18
an 18
endless 18
supply 18
pouring 18
from 18
the 18
pipe 18
not 18
even 18
hesitating 18
to 18
take 18
to 18
the 18
sewage 18
but 18
its 18
not 18
their 18
numbers 18
that 18
make 18
my 18
hands 18
shake 18
so 18
no 18
mutt 18
is 18
good 18
all 18
are 18
meant 18
to 18
damage 18
you 18
some 18
take 18
your 18
life 18
like 18
the 18
monkeys 18
others 18
your 18
reason 18
like 18
the 18
tracker 18
jackers 18
however 18
the 18
true 18
atrocities 18
the 18
most 18
frightening 18
incorporate 18
a 18
perverse 18
psychological 18
twist 18
designed 18
to 18
terrify 18
the 18
victim 18
the 18
sight 18
of 18
the 18
wolf 18
mutts 18
with 18
the 18
dead 18
tributes 18
eyes 18
the 18
sound 18
of 18
the 18
jabberjays 18
replicating 18
prims 18
tortured 18
screams 18
the 18
smell 18
of 18
snows 18
roses 18
mixed 18
with 18
the 18
victims 18
blood 18
carried 18
across 18
the 18
sewer 18
cutting 18
through 18
even 18
this 18
foulness 18
making 18
my 18
heart 18
run 18
wild 18
my 18
skin 18
turn 18
to 18
ice 18
my 18
lungs 18
unable 18
to 18
suck 18
air 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
snows 18
breathing 18
right 18
in 18
my 18
face 18
telling 18
me 18
its 18
time 18
to 18
die 18
the 18
others 18
are 18
shouting 18
at 18
me 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
seem 18
to 18
respond 18
strong 18
arms 18
lift 18
me 18
as 18
i 18
blast 18
the 18
head 18
off 18
a 18
mutt 18
whose 18
claws 18
have 18
just 18
grazed 18
my 18
ankle 18
im 18
slammed 18
into 18
the 18
ladder 18
hands 18
shoved 18
against 18
the 18
rungs 18
ordered 18
to 18
climb 18
my 18
wooden 18
puppet 18
limbs 18
obey 18
movement 18
slowly 18
brings 18
me 18
back 18
to 18
my 18
senses 18
i 18
detect 18
one 18

with 18

mildew 18
at 18
the 18
next 18
platform 18
my 18
head 18
has 18
cleared 18
and 18
the 18
reality 18
of 18
whats 18
happened 18
hits 18
me 18
i 18
begin 18
frantically 18

his 18
cuffed 18
hands 18
from 18
his 18
face 18
peeta 18
his 18
eyes 18
are 18
like 18
black 18
pools 18
the 18
pupils 18
dilated 18
so 18
that 18
the 18
blue 18
irises 18
have 18
all 18
but 18
vanished 18
the 18
muscles 18
in 18
his 18
wrists 18
are 18
hard 18
as 18
metal 18

rabid 18
beast 18
bent 18
on 18
ripping 18
my 18
throat 18
out 18
and 18
here 18

place 18
in 18
these 18
circumstances 18
i 18
will 18

have 18
to 18
kill 18

hot 18
bitter 18
hatred 18

a 18
long 18
shot 18
its 18
suicide 18
maybe 18
but 18
i 18
do 18
the 18
only 18
thing 18
i 18
can 18
think 18
of 18
i 18
lean 18
in 18
and 18
kiss 18
peeta 18
full 18
on 18
the 18
mouth 18
his 18
whole 18
body 18
starts 18
shuddering 18
but 18
i 18
keep 18
my 18
lips 18
pressed 18
to 18
his 18
until 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
come 18
up 18
for 18
air 18
my 18
hands 18

up 18
his 18
wrists 18
to 18
clasp 18
his 18
dont 18
let 18
him 18
take 18
you 18
from 18
me 18
peetas 18
panting 18
hard 18
as 18
he 18
fights 18
the 18
nightmares 18
raging 18
in 18
his 18
head 18
no 18
i 18
dont 18
want 18
to 18
i 18
clench 18
his 18
hands 18
to 18
the 18
point 18
of 18
pain 18
stay 18
with 18
me 18
his 18
pupils 18
contract 18
to 18
pinpoints 18
dilate 18
again 18
rapidly 18
and 18
then 18
return 18
to 18
something 18
resembling 18
normalcy 18
always 18
he 18
murmurs 18
i 18
help 18
peeta 18
up 18
and 18
address 18
pollux 18
how 18
far 18
to 18
the 18
street 18
he 18
indicates 18
its 18
just 18
above 18
us 18
i 18
climb 18
the 18
last 18
ladder 18
and 18
push 18
open 18
the 18
lid 18
to 18
someones 18
utility 18
room 18
im 18
rising 18
to 18
my 18
feet 18
when 18
a 18
woman 18
throws 18
open 18
the 18
door 18
she 18
wears 18
a 18
bright 18
turquoise 18
silk 18
robe 18
embroidered 18
with 18
exotic 18
birds 18
her 18
magenta 18
hairs 18
fluffed 18
up 18
like 18
a 18
cloud 18
and 18
decorated 18
with 18
gilded 18
butterflies 18
grease 18
from 18
the 18
halfeaten 18
sausage 18
shes 18
holding 18
smears 18
her 18
lipstick 18
the 18
expression 18
on 18
her 18
face 18
says 18
she 18
recognizes 18
me 18
she 18
opens 18
her 18
mouth 18
to 18
call 18
for 18
help 18
without 18
hesitation 18
i 18
shoot 18
her 18
through 18
the 18
heart 18
who 18
the 18
woman 18
was 18
calling 18
to 18
remains 18
a 18
mystery 18
because 18
after 18
searching 18
the 18
apartment 18
we 18
find 18
she 18
was 18
alone 18
perhaps 18
her 18
cry 18
was 18
meant 18
for 18
a 18
nearby 18
neighbor 18
or 18
was 18
simply 18
an 18
expression 18
of 18
fear 18
at 18
any 18
rate 18
theres 18
no 18
one 18
else 18
to 18
hear 18
her 18
this 18
apartment 18
would 18
be 18
a 18
classy 18
place 18
to 18
hole 18
up 18
in 18
for 18
a 18
while 18
but 18
thats 18
a 18
luxury 18
we 18
cant 18
afford 18
how 18
long 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
we 18
have 18
before 18
they 18
figure 18
out 18
some 18
of 18
us 18
couldve 18
survived 18
i 18
ask 18
i 18
think 18
they 18
could 18
be 18
here 18
anytime 18
gale 18
answers 18
they 18
knew 18
we 18
were 18
heading 18
for 18
the 18
streets 18
probably 18
the 18
explosion 18
will 18
throw 18
them 18
for 18
a 18
few 18
minutes 18
then 18
theyll 18
start 18
looking 18
for 18
our 18
exit 18
point 18
i 18
go 18
to 18
a 18
window 18
that 18
overlooks 18
the 18
street 18
and 18
when 18
i 18
peek 18
through 18
the 18
blinds 18
im 18
not 18
faced 18
with 18
peacekeepers 18
but 18
with 18
a 18
bundled 18
crowd 18
of 18
people 18
going 18
about 18
their 18
business 18
during 18
our 18
underground 18
journey 18
we 18
have 18
left 18
the 18
evacuated 18
zones 18
far 18
behind 18
and 18
surfaced 18
in 18
a 18
busy 18
section 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
this 18
crowd 18
offers 18
our 18
only 18
chance 18
of 18
escape 18
i 18
dont 18
have 18
a 18
holo 18
but 18
i 18
have 18
cressida 18
she 18
joins 18
me 18
at 18
the 18
window 18
confirms 18
she 18
knows 18
our 18
location 18
and 18
gives 18
me 18
the 18
good 18
news 18
that 18
we 18
arent 18
many 18
blocks 18
from 18
the 18
presidents 18
mansion 18
one 18
glance 18
at 18
my 18
companions 18
tells 18
me 18
this 18
is 18
no 18
time 18
for 18
a 18
stealth 18
attack 18
on 18
snow 18
gales 18
still 18
losing 18
blood 18
from 18
the 18
neck 18
wound 18
which 18
we 18
havent 18
even 18
cleaned 18
peetas 18
sitting 18
on 18
a 18
velvet 18
sofa 18
with 18
his 18
teeth 18
clamped 18
down 18
on 18
a 18
pillow 18
either 18
fighting 18
off 18
madness 18
or 18
containing 18
a 18
scream 18
pollux 18
weeps 18
against 18
the 18
mantel 18
of 18
an 18
ornate 18
fireplace 18
cressida 18
stands 18
determinedly 18
at 18
my 18
side 18
but 18
shes 18
so 18
pale 18
her 18
lips 18
are 18
bloodless 18
im 18
running 18
on 18
hate 18
when 18
the 18
energy 18
for 18
that 18
ebbs 18
ill 18
be 18
worthless 18
lets 18
check 18
her 18
closets 18
i 18
say 18
in 18
one 18
bedroom 18
we 18
find 18
hundreds 18
of 18
the 18
womans 18
outfits 18
coats 18
pairs 18
of 18
shoes 18
a 18
rainbow 18
of 18
wigs 18
enough 18
makeup 18
to 18
paint 18
a 18
house 18
in 18
a 18
bedroom 18
across 18
the 18
hall 18
theres 18
a 18
similar 18
selection 18
for 18
men 18
perhaps 18
they 18
belong 18
to 18
her 18
husband 18
perhaps 18
to 18
a 18
lover 18
who 18
had 18
the 18
good 18
luck 18
to 18
be 18
out 18
this 18
morning 18
i 18
call 18
the 18
others 18
to 18
dress 18
at 18
the 18
sight 18
of 18
peetas 18
bloody 18
wrists 18
i 18
dig 18
in 18
my 18
pocket 18
for 18
the 18
handcuff 18
key 18
but 18
he 18
jerks 18
away 18
from 18
me 18
no 18
he 18
says 18
dont 18
they 18
help 18
hold 18
me 18
together 18
you 18
might 18
need 18
your 18
hands 18
says 18
gale 18
when 18
i 18
feel 18
myself 18
slipping 18
i 18
dig 18
my 18
wrists 18
into 18
them 18
and 18
the 18
pain 18
helps 18
me 18
focus 18
says 18
peeta 18
i 18
let 18
them 18
be 18
fortunately 18
its 18
cold 18
out 18
so 18
we 18
can 18
conceal 18
most 18
of 18
our 18
uniforms 18
and 18
weapons 18
under 18
flowing 18
coats 18
and 18
cloaks 18
we 18
hang 18
our 18
boots 18
around 18
our 18
necks 18
by 18
their 18
laces 18
and 18
hide 18
them 18
pull 18
on 18
silly 18
shoes 18
to 18
replace 18
them 18
the 18
real 18
challenge 18
of 18
course 18
is 18
our 18
faces 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
run 18
the 18
risk 18
of 18
being 18
recognized 18
by 18
acquaintances 18
gale 18
could 18
be 18
familiar 18
from 18
the 18
propos 18
and 18
news 18
and 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
are 18
known 18
by 18
every 18
citizen 18
of 18
panem 18
we 18
hastily 18
help 18
one 18
another 18
apply 18
thick 18
layers 18
of 18
makeup 18
pull 18
on 18
wigs 18
and 18
sunglasses 18
cressida 18
wraps 18
scarves 18
over 18
peetas 18
and 18
my 18
mouths 18
and 18
noses 18
i 18
can 18
feel 18
the 18
clock 18
ticking 18
away 18
but 18
stop 18
for 18
just 18
a 18
few 18
moments 18
to 18
stuff 18
pockets 18
with 18
food 18
and 18
firstaid 18
supplies 18
stay 18
together 18
i 18
say 18
at 18
the 18
front 18
door 18
then 18
we 18
march 18
right 18
into 18
the 18
street 18
snow 18
flurries 18
have 18
begun 18
to 18
fall 18
agitated 18
people 18
swirl 18
around 18
us 18
speaking 18
of 18
rebels 18
and 18
hunger 18
and 18
me 18
in 18
their 18
affected 18
capitol 18
accents 18
we 18
cross 18
the 18
street 18
pass 18
a 18
few 18
more 18
apartments 18
just 18
as 18
we 18
turn 18
the 18
corner 18
three 18
dozen 18
peacekeepers 18
sweep 18
past 18
us 18
we 18
hop 18
out 18
of 18
their 18
way 18
as 18
the 18
real 18
citizens 18
do 18
wait 18
until 18
the 18
crowd 18
returns 18
to 18
its 18
normal 18
flow 18
and 18
keep 18
moving 18
cressida 18
i 18
whisper 18
can 18
you 18
think 18
of 18
anywhere 18
im 18
trying 18
she 18
says 18
we 18
cover 18
another 18
block 18
and 18
the 18
sirens 18
begin 18
through 18
an 18
apartment 18
window 18
i 18
see 18
an 18
emergency 18
report 18
and 18
pictures 18
of 18
our 18
faces 18
flashing 18
they 18
havent 18
identified 18
who 18
in 18
our 18
party 18
died 18
yet 18
because 18
i 18
see 18
castor 18
and 18
finnick 18
among 18
the 18
photos 18
soon 18
every 18
passerby 18
will 18
be 18
as 18
dangerous 18
as 18
a 18
peacekeeper 18
cressida 18
theres 18
one 18
place 18
its 18
not 18
ideal 18
but 18
we 18
can 18
try 18
it 18
she 18
says 18
we 18
follow 18
her 18
a 18
few 18
more 18
blocks 18
and 18
turn 18
through 18
a 18
gate 18
into 18
what 18
looks 18
like 18
a 18
private 18
residence 18
its 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
shortcut 18
though 18
because 18
after 18
walking 18
through 18
a 18
manicured 18
garden 18
we 18
come 18
out 18
of 18
another 18
gate 18
onto 18
a 18
small 18
back 18
street 18
that 18
connects 18
two 18
main 18
avenues 18
there 18
are 18
a 18
few 18
poky 18
storesone 18
that 18
buys 18
used 18
goods 18
another 18
that 18
sells 18
fake 18
jewelry 18
only 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
people 18
are 18
around 18
and 18
they 18
pay 18
no 18
attention 18
to 18
us 18
cressida 18
begins 18
to 18
babble 18
in 18
a 18
highpitched 18
voice 18
about 18
fur 18
undergarments 18
how 18
essential 18
they 18
are 18
during 18
the 18
cold 18
months 18
wait 18
until 18
you 18
see 18
the 18
prices 18
believe 18
me 18
its 18
half 18
what 18
you 18
pay 18
on 18
the 18
avenues 18
we 18
stop 18
before 18
a 18
grimy 18
storefront 18
filled 18
with 18
mannequins 18
in 18
furry 18
underwear 18
the 18
place 18
doesnt 18
even 18
look 18
open 18
but 18
cressida 18
pushes 18
through 18
the 18
front 18
door 18
setting 18
off 18
a 18
dissonant 18
chiming 18
inside 18
the 18
dim 18
narrow 18
shop 18
lined 18
with 18
racks 18
of 18
merchandise 18
the 18
smell 18
of 18
pelts 18
fills 18
my 18
nose 18
business 18
must 18
be 18
slow 18
since 18
were 18
the 18
only 18
customers 18
cressida 18
heads 18
straight 18
for 18
a 18
hunched 18
figure 18
sitting 18
in 18
the 18
back 18
i 18
follow 18
trailing 18
my 18
fingers 18
through 18
the 18
soft 18
garments 18
as 18
we 18
go 18
behind 18
a 18
counter 18
sits 18
the 18
strangest 18
person 18
ive 18
ever 18
seen 18
shes 18
an 18
extreme 18
example 18
of 18
surgical 18
enhancement 18
gone 18
wrong 18
for 18
surely 18
not 18
even 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
could 18
they 18
find 18
this 18
face 18
attractive 18
the 18
skin 18
has 18
been 18
pulled 18
back 18
tightly 18
and 18
tattooed 18
with 18
black 18
and 18
gold 18
stripes 18
the 18
nose 18
has 18
been 18
flattened 18
until 18
it 18
barely 18
exists 18
ive 18
seen 18
cat 18
whiskers 18
on 18
people 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
before 18
but 18
none 18
so 18
long 18
the 18
result 18
is 18
a 18
grotesque 18
semifeline 18
mask 18
which 18
now 18
squints 18
at 18
us 18
distrustfully 18
cressida 18
takes 18
off 18
her 18
wig 18
revealing 18
her 18
vines 18
tigris 18
she 18
says 18
we 18
need 18
help 18
tigris 18
deep 18
in 18
my 18
brain 18
the 18
name 18
rings 18
a 18
bell 18
she 18
was 18
a 18
fixturea 18
younger 18
less 18
disturbing 18
version 18
of 18
herself 18
in 18
the 18
earliest 18
hunger 18
games 18
i 18
can 18
remember 18
a 18
stylist 18
i 18
think 18
i 18
dont 18
remember 18
for 18
which 18
district 18
not 18
then 18
she 18
must 18
have 18
had 18
one 18
operation 18
too 18
many 18
and 18
crossed 18
the 18
line 18
into 18
repellence 18
so 18
this 18
is 18
where 18
stylists 18
go 18
when 18
theyve 18
outlived 18
their 18
use 18
to 18
sad 18
theme 18
underwear 18
shops 18
where 18
they 18
wait 18
for 18
death 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
public 18
eye 18
i 18
stare 18
at 18
her 18
face 18
wondering 18
if 18
her 18
parents 18
actually 18
named 18
her 18
tigris 18
inspiring 18
her 18
mutilation 18
or 18
if 18
she 18
chose 18
the 18
style 18
and 18
changed 18
her 18
name 18
to 18
match 18
her 18
stripes 18
plutarch 18
said 18
you 18
could 18
be 18
trusted 18
adds 18
cressida 18
great 18
shes 18
one 18
of 18
plutarchs 18
people 18
so 18
if 18
her 18
first 18
move 18
isnt 18
to 18
turn 18
us 18
in 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
to 18
notify 18
plutarch 18
and 18
by 18
extension 18
coin 18
of 18
our 18
whereabouts 18
no 18
tigriss 18
shop 18
is 18
not 18
ideal 18
but 18
its 18
all 18
we 18
have 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
if 18
shell 18
even 18
help 18
us 18
shes 18
peering 18
between 18
an 18
old 18
television 18
on 18
her 18
counter 18
and 18
us 18
as 18
if 18
trying 18
to 18
place 18
us 18
to 18
help 18
her 18
i 18
pull 18
down 18
my 18
scarf 18
remove 18
my 18
wig 18
and 18
step 18
closer 18
so 18
that 18
the 18
light 18
of 18
the 18
screen 18
falls 18
on 18
my 18
face 18
tigris 18
gives 18
a 18
low 18
growl 18
not 18
unlike 18
one 18
buttercup 18
might 18
greet 18
me 18
with 18
she 18
slinks 18
down 18
off 18
her 18
stool 18
and 18
disappears 18
behind 18
a 18
rack 18
of 18
furlined 18
leggings 18
theres 18
a 18
sound 18
of 18
sliding 18
and 18
then 18
her 18
hand 18
emerges 18
and 18
waves 18
us 18
forward 18
cressida 18
looks 18
at 18
me 18
as 18
if 18
to 18
ask 18
are 18
you 18
sure 18
but 18
what 18
choice 18
do 18
we 18
have 18
returning 18
to 18
the 18
streets 18
under 18
these 18
conditions 18
guarantees 18
our 18
capture 18
or 18
death 18
i 18
push 18
around 18
the 18
furs 18
and 18
find 18
tigris 18
has 18
slid 18
back 18
a 18
panel 18
at 18
the 18
base 18
of 18
the 18
wall 18
behind 18
it 18
seems 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
top 18
of 18
a 18
steep 18
stone 18
stairway 18
she 18
gestures 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
enter 18
everything 18
about 18
the 18
situation 18
screams 18
trap 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
moment 18
of 18
panic 18
and 18
find 18
myself 18
turning 18
to 18
tigris 18
searching 18
those 18
tawny 18
eyes 18
why 18
is 18
she 18
doing 18
this 18
shes 18
no 18
cinna 18
someone 18
willing 18
to 18
sacrifice 18
herself 18
for 18
others 18
this 18
woman 18
was 18
the 18
embodiment 18
of 18
capitol 18
shallowness 18
she 18
was 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
stars 18
of 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
untiluntil 18
she 18
wasnt 18
so 18
is 18
that 18
it 18
then 18
bitterness 18
hatred 18
revenge 18
actually 18
im 18
comforted 18
by 18
the 18
idea 18
a 18
need 18
for 18
revenge 18
can 18
burn 18
long 18
and 18
hot 18
especially 18
if 18
every 18
glance 18
in 18
a 18
mirror 18
reinforces 18
it 18
did 18
snow 18
ban 18
you 18
from 18
the 18
games 18
i 18
ask 18
she 18
just 18
stares 18
back 18
at 18
me 18
somewhere 18
her 18
tiger 18
tail 18
flicks 18
with 18
displeasure 18
because 18
im 18
going 18
to 18
kill 18
him 18
you 18
know 18
her 18
mouth 18
spreads 18
into 18
what 18
i 18
take 18
for 18
a 18
smile 18
reassured 18
that 18
this 18
isnt 18
complete 18
madness 18
i 18
crawl 18
through 18
the 18
space 18
about 18
halfway 18
down 18
the 18
steps 18
my 18
face 18
runs 18
into 18
a 18
hanging 18
chain 18
and 18
i 18
pull 18
it 18
illuminating 18
the 18
hideout 18
with 18
a 18
flickering 18
fluorescent 18
bulb 18
its 18
a 18
small 18
cellar 18
with 18
no 18
doors 18
or 18
windows 18
shallow 18
and 18
wide 18
probably 18
just 18
a 18
strip 18
between 18
two 18
real 18
basements 18
a 18
place 18
whose 18
existence 18
could 18
go 18
unnoticed 18
unless 18
you 18
had 18
a 18
very 18
keen 18
eye 18
for 18
dimensions 18
its 18
cold 18
and 18
dank 18
with 18
piles 18
of 18
pelts 18
that 18
im 18
guessing 18
havent 18
seen 18
the 18
light 18
of 18
day 18
in 18
years 18
unless 18
tigris 18
gives 18
us 18
up 18
i 18
dont 18
believe 18
anyone 18
will 18
find 18
us 18
here 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
reach 18
the 18
concrete 18
floor 18
my 18
companions 18
are 18
on 18
the 18
steps 18
the 18
panel 18
slides 18
back 18
in 18
place 18
i 18
hear 18
the 18
underwear 18
rack 18
being 18
adjusted 18
on 18
squeaky 18
wheels 18
tigris 18
padding 18
back 18
to 18
her 18
stool 18
we 18
have 18
been 18
swallowed 18
up 18
by 18
her 18
store 18
just 18
in 18
time 18
too 18
because 18
gale 18
looks 18
on 18
the 18
verge 18
of 18
collapse 18
we 18
make 18
a 18
bed 18
of 18
pelts 18
strip 18
off 18
his 18
layers 18
of 18
weapons 18
and 18
help 18
him 18
onto 18
his 18
back 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
cellar 18
theres 18
a 18
faucet 18
about 18
a 18
foot 18
from 18
the 18
floor 18
with 18
a 18
drain 18
under 18
it 18
i 18
turn 18
the 18
tap 18
and 18
after 18
much 18
sputtering 18
and 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
rust 18
clear 18
water 18
begins 18
to 18
flow 18
we 18
clean 18
gales 18
neck 18
wound 18
and 18
i 18
realize 18
bandages 18
wont 18
be 18
enough 18
hes 18
going 18
to 18
need 18
a 18
few 18
stitches 18
theres 18
a 18
needle 18
and 18
sterile 18
thread 18
in 18
the 18
firstaid 18
supplies 18
but 18
what 18
we 18
lack 18
is 18
a 18
healer 18
it 18
crosses 18
my 18
mind 18
to 18
enlist 18
tigris 18
as 18
a 18
stylist 18
she 18
must 18
know 18
how 18
to 18
work 18
a 18
needle 18
but 18
that 18
would 18
leave 18
no 18
one 18
manning 18
the 18
shop 18
and 18
shes 18
doing 18
enough 18
already 18
i 18
accept 18
that 18
im 18
probably 18
the 18
most 18
qualified 18
for 18
the 18
job 18
grit 18
my 18
teeth 18
and 18
put 18
in 18
a 18
row 18
of 18
jagged 18
sutures 18
its 18
not 18
pretty 18
but 18
its 18
functional 18
i 18
smear 18
it 18
with 18
medicine 18
and 18
wrap 18
it 18
up 18
give 18
him 18
some 18
painkillers 18
you 18
can 18
rest 18
now 18
its 18
safe 18
here 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
he 18
goes 18
out 18
like 18
a 18
light 18
while 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
make 18
fur 18
nests 18
for 18
each 18
of 18
us 18
i 18
attend 18
to 18
peetas 18
wrists 18
gently 18
rinsing 18
away 18
the 18
blood 18
putting 18
on 18
an 18
antiseptic 18
and 18
bandaging 18
them 18
beneath 18
the 18
cuffs 18
youve 18
got 18
to 18
keep 18
them 18
clean 18
otherwise 18
the 18
infection 18
could 18
spread 18
and 18
i 18
know 18
what 18
blood 18
poisoning 18
is 18
katniss 18
says 18
peeta 18
even 18
if 18
my 18
mother 18
isnt 18
a 18
healer 18
im 18
jolted 18
back 18
in 18
time 18
to 18
another 18
wound 18
another 18
set 18
of 18
bandages 18
you 18
said 18
that 18
same 18
thing 18
to 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
first 18
hunger 18
games 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
real 18
he 18
says 18
and 18
you 18
risked 18
your 18
life 18
getting 18
the 18
medicine 18
that 18
saved 18
me 18
real 18
i 18
shrug 18
you 18
were 18
the 18
reason 18
i 18
was 18
alive 18
to 18
do 18
it 18
was 18
i 18
the 18
comment 18
throws 18
him 18
into 18
confusion 18
some 18
shiny 18
memory 18
must 18
be 18
fighting 18
for 18
his 18
attention 18
because 18
his 18
body 18
tenses 18
and 18
his 18
newly 18
bandaged 18
wrists 18
strain 18
against 18
the 18
metal 18
cuffs 18
then 18
all 18
the 18
energy 18
saps 18
from 18
his 18
body 18
im 18
so 18
tired 18
katniss 18
go 18
to 18

few 18
hours 18
if 18

of 18
peacekeepers 18
were 18
to 18
come 18
through 18
that 18
door 18

trapped 18
like 18
rats 18
we 18
are 18
completely 18
at 18
the 18
mercy 18
of 18
a 18
decrepit 18
tigerwoman 18
with 18
what 18
i 18
can 18
only 18
hope 18
is 18
an 18
allconsuming 18
passion 18
for 18
snows 18
death 18
i 18
dont 18
honestly 18

try 18
to 18
get 18
some 18
sleep 18
i 18
say 18
they 18
nod 18
numbly 18
and 18
we 18
all 18
burrow 18
into 18
our 18
pelts 18
the 18
fire 18
inside 18
me 18
has 18
flickered 18
out 18
and 18
with 18
it 18
my 18
strength 18
i 18
surrender 18
to 18
the 18
soft 18
musty 18
fur 18
and 18
oblivion 18
i 18
have 18
only 18
one 18
dream 18
i 18
remember 18
a 18
long 18
and 18
wearying 18
thing 18
in 18
which 18
im 18
trying 18
to 18

trying 18
to 18
ditch 18
her 18
in 18
places 18
but 18
she 18
inexplicably 18
reappears 18
at 18
my 18
side 18
insisting 18
that 18
as 18
my 18
escort 18

responsible 18
for 18
my 18
staying 18

the 18
schedule 18
is 18
constantly 18
shifting 18
derailed 18
by 18
our 18
lack 18
of 18
a 18
stamp 18
from 18
an 18
official 18
or 18
delayed 18
when 18

breaks 18
one 18
of 18
her 18
high 18
heels 18
we 18
camp 18
for 18
days 18
on 18
a 18
bench 18
in 18
a 18
gray 18
station 18
in 18
district 18
awaiting 18
a 18
train 18
that 18
never 18
comes 18
when 18
i 18
wake 18
somehow 18
i 18
feel 18
even 18
more 18
drained 18
by 18
this 18
than 18
my 18
usual 18
nighttime 18
forays 18
into 18
blood 18
and 18
terror 18
cressida 18

it 18
down 18
with 18
a 18
lot 18
of 18
water 18
then 18
i 18
lean 18
against 18
the 18
cellar 18
wall 18
retracing 18
the 18
events 18
of 18
the 18
last 18
day 18
moving 18
death 18
by 18

a 18
minute 18
boggs 18

his 18
plan 18
for 18
our 18
escape 18
to 18
believe 18
them 18
dead 18
is 18
to 18
accept 18
i 18
killed 18
them 18
okay 18

mitchell 18
and 18
boggsthey 18
died 18
on 18
an 18
actual 18
assignment 18
but 18
the 18
others 18
lost 18
their 18
lives 18
defending 18
me 18
on 18
a 18
mission 18
i 18
fabricated 18
my 18
plot 18
to 18
assassinate 18
snow 18
seems 18
so 18
stupid 18
now 18
so 18
stupid 18
as 18
i 18
sit 18
shivering 18
here 18
in 18
this 18
cellar 18
tallying 18
up 18
our 18
losses 18
fingering 18
the 18
tassels 18
on 18
the 18
silver 18
kneehigh 18
boots 18
i 18
stole 18
from 18
the 18
womans 18
home 18
oh 18
yeahi 18
forgot 18
about 18
that 18
i 18
killed 18
her 18
too 18
im 18
taking 18
out 18
unarmed 18
citizens 18
now 18
i 18
think 18
its 18
time 18
i 18
give 18
myself 18
up 18
when 18
everyone 18
finally 18
awakens 18
i 18
confess 18
how 18
i 18
lied 18
about 18
the 18
mission 18
how 18
i 18
jeopardized 18
everyone 18
in 18
pursuit 18
of 18
revenge 18
theres 18
a 18
long 18
silence 18
after 18
i 18
finish 18
then 18
gale 18
says 18
katniss 18
we 18
all 18
knew 18
you 18
were 18
lying 18
about 18
coin 18
sending 18
you 18
to 18
assassinate 18
snow 18
you 18
knew 18
maybe 18
the 18
soldiers 18
from 18
thirteen 18
didnt 18
i 18
reply 18
do 18
you 18
really 18
think 18
jackson 18
believed 18
you 18
had 18
orders 18
from 18
coin 18
cressida 18
asks 18
of 18
course 18
she 18
didnt 18
but 18
she 18
trusted 18
boggs 18
and 18
hed 18
clearly 18
wanted 18
you 18
to 18
go 18
on 18
i 18
never 18
even 18
told 18
boggs 18
what 18
i 18
planned 18
to 18
do 18
i 18
say 18
you 18
told 18
everyone 18
in 18
command 18
gale 18
says 18
it 18
was 18
one 18
of 18
your 18
conditions 18
for 18
being 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
i 18
kill 18
snow 18
those 18
seem 18
like 18
two 18
disconnected 18
things 18
negotiating 18
with 18
coin 18
for 18
the 18
privilege 18
of 18
executing 18
snow 18
after 18
the 18
war 18
and 18
this 18
unauthorized 18
flight 18
through 18
the 18
capitol 18
but 18
not 18
like 18
this 18
i 18
say 18
its 18
been 18
a 18
complete 18
disaster 18
i 18
think 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
considered 18
a 18
highly 18
successful 18
mission 18
says 18
gale 18
weve 18
infiltrated 18
the 18
enemy 18
camp 18
showing 18
that 18
the 18
capitols 18
defenses 18
can 18
be 18
breached 18
weve 18
managed 18
to 18
get 18
footage 18
of 18
ourselves 18
all 18
over 18
the 18
capitols 18
news 18
weve 18
thrown 18
the 18
whole 18
city 18
into 18
chaos 18
trying 18
to 18
find 18
us 18
trust 18
me 18
plutarchs 18
thrilled 18
cressida 18
adds 18
thats 18
because 18
plutarch 18
doesnt 18
care 18
who 18
dies 18
i 18
say 18
not 18
as 18
long 18
as 18
his 18
games 18
are 18
a 18
success 18
cressida 18
and 18
gale 18
go 18
round 18
and 18
round 18
trying 18
to 18
convince 18
me 18
pollux 18
nods 18
at 18
their 18
words 18
to 18
back 18
them 18
up 18
only 18
peeta 18
doesnt 18
offer 18
an 18
opinion 18
what 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
peeta 18
i 18
finally 18
ask 18
him 18
i 18
thinkyou 18
still 18
have 18
no 18
idea 18
the 18
effect 18
you 18
can 18
have 18
he 18
slides 18
his 18
cuffs 18
up 18
the 18
support 18
and 18
pushes 18
himself 18
to 18
a 18
sitting 18
position 18
none 18
of 18
the 18
people 18
we 18
lost 18
were 18
idiots 18
they 18
knew 18
what 18
they 18
were 18
doing 18
they 18
followed 18
you 18
because 18
they 18
believed 18
you 18
really 18
could 18
kill 18
snow 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
why 18
his 18
voice 18
reaches 18
me 18
when 18
no 18
one 18
elses 18
can 18
but 18
if 18
hes 18
right 18
and 18
i 18
think 18
he 18
is 18
i 18
owe 18
the 18
others 18
a 18
debt 18
that 18
can 18
only 18
be 18
repaid 18
in 18
one 18
way 18
i 18
pull 18
my 18
paper 18
map 18
from 18
a 18
pocket 18
in 18
my 18
uniform 18
and 18
spread 18
it 18
out 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
with 18
new 18
resolve 18
where 18
are 18
we 18
cressida 18
tigriss 18
shop 18
sits 18
about 18
five 18
blocks 18
from 18
the 18
city 18
circle 18
and 18
snows 18
mansion 18
were 18
in 18
easy 18
walking 18
distance 18
through 18
a 18
zone 18
in 18
which 18
the 18
pods 18
are 18
deactivated 18
for 18
the 18
residents 18
safety 18
we 18
have 18
disguises 18
that 18
perhaps 18
with 18
some 18
embellishments 18
from 18
tigriss 18
furry 18
stock 18
could 18
get 18
us 18
safely 18
there 18
but 18
then 18
what 18
the 18
mansions 18
sure 18
to 18
be 18
heavily 18
guarded 18
under 18
roundtheclock 18
camera 18
surveillance 18
and 18
laced 18
with 18
pods 18
that 18
could 18
become 18
live 18
at 18
the 18
flick 18
of 18
a 18
switch 18
what 18
we 18
need 18
is 18
to 18
get 18
him 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
open 18
gale 18
says 18
to 18
me 18
then 18
one 18
of 18
us 18
could 18
pick 18
him 18
off 18
does 18
he 18
ever 18
appear 18
in 18
public 18
anymore 18
asks 18
peeta 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
so 18
says 18
cressida 18
at 18
least 18
in 18
all 18
the 18
recent 18
speeches 18
ive 18
seen 18
hes 18
been 18
in 18
the 18
mansion 18
even 18
before 18
the 18
rebels 18
got 18
here 18
i 18
imagine 18
he 18
became 18
more 18
vigilant 18
after 18
finnick 18
aired 18
his 18
crimes 18
thats 18
right 18
its 18
not 18
just 18
the 18
tigrises 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
who 18
hate 18
snow 18
now 18
but 18
a 18
web 18
of 18
people 18
who 18
know 18
what 18
he 18
did 18
to 18
their 18
friends 18
and 18
families 18
it 18
would 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
something 18
bordering 18
on 18
miraculous 18
to 18
lure 18
him 18
out 18
something 18
like 18
i 18
bet 18
hed 18
come 18
out 18
for 18
me 18
i 18
say 18
if 18
i 18
were 18
captured 18
hed 18
want 18
that 18
as 18
public 18
as 18
possible 18
hed 18
want 18
my 18
execution 18
on 18
his 18
front 18
steps 18
i 18
let 18
this 18
sink 18
in 18
then 18
gale 18
could 18
shoot 18
him 18
from 18
the 18
audience 18
no 18
peeta 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
there 18
are 18
too 18
many 18
alternative 18
endings 18
to 18
that 18
plan 18
snow 18
might 18

you 18

publicly 18
without 18

like 18
an 18
extreme 18
solution 18
to 18
jump 18
to 18
immediately 18
he 18
says 18
maybe 18
if 18
all 18
else 18

thinking 18
in 18
the 18
quiet 18

a 18
few 18
minutes 18
later 18
the 18

at 18
the 18
top 18
of 18
the 18

since 18
we 18

natural 18
or 18
from 18
years 18
of 18
practice 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
but 18
theres 18
something 18
in 18
her 18
manner 18
of 18
speaking 18
that 18
suggests 18
a 18
cats 18
purr 18
as 18
we 18
climb 18
the 18
stairs 18
cressida 18

safe 18
house 18
dont 18
worry 18
worry 18
i 18
feel 18
immensely 18
relieved 18
by 18
the 18
news 18
that 18
i 18
wont 18
be 18
givenand 18
have 18
to 18
ignoredirect 18
orders 18
from 18
or 18
make 18
up 18
some 18
viable 18
defense 18
for 18
the 18
decisions 18
ive 18
made 18
over 18
the 18
last 18
couple 18
of 18
days 18
in 18
the 18
shop 18
the 18
counter 18
holds 18
some 18
stale 18
hunks 18
of 18
bread 18
a 18
wedge 18
of 18
moldy 18
cheese 18
and 18
half 18
a 18
bottle 18
of 18
mustard 18
it 18
reminds 18
me 18
that 18
not 18
everyone 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
has 18
full 18
stomachs 18
these 18
days 18
i 18
feel 18
obliged 18
to 18
tell 18
tigris 18
about 18
our 18
remaining 18
food 18
supplies 18
but 18
she 18
waves 18
my 18
objections 18
away 18
i 18
eat 18
next 18
to 18
nothing 18
she 18
says 18
and 18
then 18
only 18
raw 18
meat 18
this 18
seems 18
a 18
little 18
too 18
in 18
character 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
question 18
it 18
i 18
just 18
scrape 18
the 18
mold 18
off 18
the 18
cheese 18
and 18
divide 18
up 18
the 18
food 18
among 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
us 18
while 18
we 18
eat 18
we 18
watch 18
the 18
latest 18
capitol 18
news 18
coverage 18
the 18
government 18
has 18
the 18
rebel 18
survivors 18
narrowed 18
down 18
to 18
the 18
five 18
of 18
us 18
huge 18
bounties 18
are 18
offered 18
for 18
information 18
leading 18
to 18
our 18
capture 18
they 18
emphasize 18
how 18
dangerous 18
we 18
are 18
show 18
us 18
exchanging 18
gunfire 18
with 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
although 18
not 18
the 18
mutts 18
ripping 18
off 18
their 18
heads 18
do 18
a 18
tragic 18
tribute 18
to 18
the 18
woman 18
lying 18
where 18
we 18
left 18
her 18
with 18
my 18
arrow 18
still 18
in 18
her 18
heart 18
someone 18
has 18
redone 18
her 18
makeup 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
the 18
rebels 18
let 18
the 18
capitol 18
broadcast 18
run 18
on 18
uninterrupted 18
have 18
the 18
rebels 18
made 18
a 18
statement 18
today 18
i 18
ask 18
tigris 18
she 18
shakes 18
her 18
head 18
i 18
doubt 18
coin 18
knows 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
me 18
now 18
that 18
im 18
still 18
alive 18
tigris 18
gives 18
a 18
throaty 18
cackle 18
no 18
one 18
knows 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
you 18
girlie 18
then 18
she 18
makes 18
me 18
take 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
the 18
fur 18
leggings 18
even 18
though 18
i 18
cant 18
pay 18
her 18
for 18
them 18
its 18
the 18
kind 18
of 18
gift 18
you 18
have 18
to 18
accept 18
and 18
anyway 18
its 18
cold 18
in 18
that 18
cellardownstairs 18
after 18
supper 18
we 18
continue 18
to 18
rack 18
our 18
brains 18
for 18
a 18
plan 18
nothing 18
good 18
comes 18
up 18
but 18
we 18
do 18
agree 18
that 18
we 18
can 18
no 18
longer 18
go 18
out 18
as 18
a 18
group 18
of 18
five 18
and 18
that 18
we 18
should 18
try 18
to 18
infiltrate 18
the 18
presidents 18
mansion 18
before 18
i 18
turn 18
myself 18
into 18
bait 18
i 18
consent 18
to 18
that 18
second 18
point 18
to 18
avoid 18
further 18
argument 18
if 18
i 18
do 18
decide 18
to 18
give 18
myself 18
up 18
it 18
wont 18
require 18
anyone 18
elses 18
permission 18
or 18
participation 18
we 18
change 18
bandages 18
handcuff 18
peeta 18
back 18
to 18
his 18
support 18
and 18
settle 18
down 18
to 18
sleep 18
a 18
few 18
hours 18
later 18
i 18
slip 18
back 18
into 18
consciousness 18
and 18
become 18
aware 18
of 18
a 18
quiet 18
conversation 18
peeta 18
and 18
gale 18
i 18
cant 18
stop 18
myself 18
from 18
eavesdropping 18
thanks 18
for 18
the 18
water 18
peeta 18
says 18
no 18
problem 18
gale 18
replies 18
i 18
wake 18
up 18
ten 18
times 18
a 18
night 18
anyway 18
to 18
make 18
sure 18
katniss 18
is 18
still 18
here 18
asks 18
peeta 18
something 18
like 18
that 18
gale 18
admits 18
theres 18
a 18
long 18
pause 18
before 18
peeta 18
speaks 18
again 18
that 18
was 18
funny 18
what 18
tigris 18
said 18
about 18
no 18
one 18
knowing 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
her 18
well 18
we 18
never 18
have 18
gale 18
says 18
they 18
both 18
laugh 18
its 18
so 18
strange 18
to 18
hear 18
them 18
talking 18
like 18
this 18
almost 18
like 18
friends 18
which 18
theyre 18
not 18
never 18
have 18
been 18
although 18
theyre 18
not 18
exactly 18
enemies 18
she 18
loves 18
you 18
you 18
know 18
says 18
peeta 18
she 18
as 18
good 18
as 18
told 18
me 18
after 18
they 18
whipped 18
you 18
dont 18
believe 18
it 18
gale 18
answers 18
the 18
way 18
she 18
kissed 18
you 18
in 18
the 18
quarter 18
quellwell 18
she 18
never 18
kissed 18
me 18
like 18
that 18
it 18
was 18
just 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
show 18
peeta 18
tells 18
him 18
although 18
theres 18
an 18
edge 18
of 18
doubt 18
in 18
his 18
voice 18
no 18
you 18
won 18
her 18
over 18
gave 18
up 18
everything 18
for 18
her 18
maybe 18
thats 18
the 18
only 18
way 18
to 18
convince 18
her 18
you 18
love 18
her 18
theres 18
a 18
long 18
pause 18
i 18
should 18
have 18
volunteered 18
to 18
take 18
your 18
place 18
in 18
the 18
first 18
games 18
protected 18
her 18
then 18
you 18
couldnt 18
says 18
peeta 18
shed 18
never 18
have 18
forgiven 18
you 18
you 18
had 18
to 18
take 18
care 18
of 18
her 18
family 18
they 18
matter 18
more 18
to 18
her 18
than 18
her 18
life 18
well 18
it 18
wont 18
be 18
an 18
issue 18
much 18
longer 18
i 18
think 18
its 18
unlikely 18
all 18
three 18
of 18
us 18
will 18
be 18
alive 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
war 18
and 18
if 18
we 18
are 18
i 18
guess 18
its 18
katnisss 18
problem 18
who 18
to 18
choose 18
gale 18
yawns 18
we 18
should 18
get 18
some 18
sleep 18
yeah 18
i 18
hear 18
peetas 18
handcuffs 18
slide 18
down 18
the 18
support 18
as 18
he 18
settles 18
in 18
i 18
wonder 18
how 18
shell 18
make 18
up 18
her 18
mind 18
oh 18
that 18
i 18
do 18
know 18
i 18
can 18
just 18
catch 18
gales 18
last 18
words 18
through 18
the 18
layer 18
of 18
fur 18
katniss 18
will 18
pick 18
whoever 18
she 18
thinks 18
she 18
cant 18
survive 18
without 18
a 18
chill 18
runs 18
through 18
me 18
am 18
i 18
really 18
that 18
cold 18
and 18
calculating 18
gale 18
didnt 18
say 18
katniss 18
will 18
pick 18
whoever 18
it 18
will 18
break 18
her 18
heart 18
to 18
give 18
up 18
or 18
even 18
whoever 18
she 18
cant 18
live 18
without 18
those 18
would 18
have 18
implied 18
i 18
was 18
motivated 18
by 18
a 18
kind 18
of 18
passion 18
but 18
my 18
best 18
friend 18
predicts 18
i 18
will 18
choose 18
the 18
person 18
who 18
i 18
think 18
i 18
cant 18
survive 18
without 18
theres 18
not 18
the 18
least 18
indication 18
that 18
love 18
or 18
desire 18
or 18
even 18
compatibility 18
will 18
sway 18
me 18
ill 18
just 18
conduct 18
an 18
unfeeling 18
assessment 18
of 18
what 18
my 18
potential 18
mates 18
can 18
offer 18
me 18
as 18
if 18
in 18
the 18
end 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
the 18
question 18
of 18
whether 18
a 18
baker 18
or 18
a 18
hunter 18
will 18
extend 18
my 18
longevity 18
the 18
most 18
its 18
a 18
horrible 18
thing 18
for 18
gale 18
to 18
say 18
for 18
peeta 18
not 18
to 18
refute 18
especially 18
when 18
every 18
emotion 18
i 18
have 18
has 18
been 18
taken 18
and 18
exploited 18
by 18
the 18
capitol 18
or 18
the 18
rebels 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
the 18
choice 18
would 18
be 18
simple 18
i 18
can 18
survive 18
just 18
fine 18
without 18
either 18
of 18
them 18
in 18
the 18
morning 18
i 18
have 18
no 18
time 18
or 18
energy 18
to 18
nurse 18
wounded 18
feelings 18
during 18
a 18
predawn 18
breakfast 18
of 18
liver 18
pate 18
and 18
fig 18
cookies 18
we 18
gather 18
around 18
tigriss 18
television 18
for 18
one 18
of 18
beetees 18
breakins 18
theres 18
been 18
a 18
new 18
development 18
in 18
the 18
war 18
apparently 18
inspired 18
by 18
the 18
black 18
wave 18
some 18
enterprising 18
rebel 18
commander 18
came 18
up 18
with 18
the 18
idea 18
of 18
confiscating 18
peoples 18
abandoned 18
automobiles 18
and 18
sending 18
them 18
unmanned 18
down 18
the 18
streets 18
the 18
cars 18
dont 18
trigger 18
every 18
pod 18
but 18
they 18
certainly 18
get 18
the 18
majority 18
at 18
around 18
four 18
in 18
the 18
morning 18
the 18
rebels 18
began 18
carving 18
three 18
separate 18
pathssimply 18
referred 18
to 18
as 18
the 18
a 18
b 18
and 18
c 18
lines 18
to 18
the 18
capitols 18
heart 18
as 18
a 18
result 18
theyve 18
secured 18
block 18
after 18
block 18
with 18
very 18
few 18
casualties 18
this 18
cant 18
last 18
says 18
gale 18
in 18
fact 18
im 18
surprised 18
theyve 18
kept 18
it 18
going 18
so 18
long 18
the 18
capitol 18
will 18
adjust 18
by 18
deactivating 18
specific 18
pods 18
and 18
then 18
manually 18
triggering 18
them 18
when 18
their 18
targets 18
come 18
in 18
range 18
almost 18
within 18
minutes 18
of 18
his 18
prediction 18
we 18
see 18
this 18
very 18
thing 18
happen 18
onscreen 18
a 18
squad 18
sends 18
a 18
car 18
down 18
a 18
block 18
setting 18
off 18
four 18
pods 18
all 18
seems 18
well 18
three 18
scouts 18
follow 18
and 18
make 18
it 18
safely 18
to 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
street 18
but 18
when 18
a 18
group 18
of 18
twenty 18
rebel 18
soldiers 18
follow 18
them 18
theyre 18
blown 18
to 18
bits 18
by 18
a 18
row 18
of 18
potted 18
rosebushes 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
a 18
flower 18
shop 18
i 18
bet 18
its 18
killing 18
plutarch 18
not 18
to 18
be 18
in 18
the 18
control 18
room 18
on 18
this 18
one 18
says 18
peeta 18
beetee 18
gives 18
the 18
broadcast 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
capitol 18
where 18
a 18
grimfaced 18
reporter 18
announces 18
the 18
blocks 18
that 18
civilians 18
are 18
to 18
evacuate 18
between 18
her 18
update 18
and 18
the 18
previous 18
story 18
i 18
am 18
able 18
to 18
mark 18
my 18
paper 18
map 18
to 18
show 18
the 18
relative 18
positions 18
of 18
the 18
opposing 18
armies 18
i 18
hear 18
scuffling 18
out 18
on 18
the 18
street 18
move 18
to 18
the 18
windows 18
and 18
peek 18
out 18
a 18
crack 18
in 18
the 18
shutters 18
in 18
the 18
early 18
morning 18
light 18
i 18
see 18
a 18
bizarre 18
spectacle 18
refugees 18
from 18
the 18
now 18
occupied 18
blocks 18
are 18
streaming 18
toward 18
the 18
capitols 18
center 18
the 18
most 18
panicked 18
are 18
wearing 18
nothing 18
but 18
nightgowns 18
and 18
slippers 18
while 18
the 18
more 18
prepared 18
are 18
heavily 18
bundled 18
in 18
layers 18
of 18
clothes 18
they 18
carry 18
everything 18
from 18
lapdogs 18
to 18
jewelry 18
boxes 18
to 18
potted 18
plants 18
one 18
man 18
in 18
a 18
fluffy 18
robe 18
holds 18
only 18
an 18
overripe 18
banana 18
confused 18
sleepy 18
children 18
stumble 18
along 18
after 18
their 18
parents 18
most 18
either 18
too 18
stunned 18
or 18
too 18
baffled 18
to 18
cry 18
bits 18
of 18
them 18
flash 18
by 18
my 18
line 18
of 18
vision 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
wide 18
brown 18
eyes 18
an 18
arm 18
clutching 18
a 18
favorite 18
doll 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
bare 18
feet 18
bluish 18
in 18
the 18
cold 18
catching 18
on 18
the 18
uneven 18
paving 18
stones 18
of 18
the 18
alley 18
seeing 18
them 18
reminds 18
me 18
of 18
the 18
children 18
of 18
who 18
died 18
fleeing 18
the 18
firebombs 18
i 18
leave 18
the 18
window 18
tigris 18
offers 18
to 18
be 18
our 18
spy 18
for 18
the 18
day 18
since 18
shes 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
of 18
us 18
without 18
a 18
bounty 18
on 18
her 18
head 18
after 18
securing 18
us 18
downstairs 18
she 18
goes 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
capitol 18
to 18
pick 18
up 18
any 18
helpful 18
information 18
down 18
in 18
the 18
cellar 18
i 18
pace 18
back 18
and 18
forth 18
driving 18
the 18
others 18
crazy 18
something 18
tells 18
me 18
that 18
not 18
taking 18
advantage 18
of 18
the 18
flood 18
of 18
refugees 18
is 18
a 18
mistake 18
what 18
better 18
cover 18
could 18
we 18
have 18
on 18
the 18
other 18
hand 18
every 18
displaced 18
person 18
milling 18
about 18
on 18
the 18
streets 18
means 18
another 18
pair 18
of 18
eyes 18
looking 18
for 18
the 18
five 18
rebels 18
on 18
the 18
loose 18
then 18
again 18
what 18
do 18
we 18
gain 18
by 18
staying 18
here 18
all 18
were 18
really 18
doing 18
is 18
depleting 18
our 18
small 18
cache 18
of 18
food 18
and 18
waiting 18
forwhat 18
the 18
rebels 18
to 18
take 18
the 18
capitol 18
it 18
could 18
be 18
weeks 18
before 18
that 18
happens 18
and 18
im 18
not 18
so 18
sure 18
what 18
id 18
do 18
if 18
they 18
did 18
not 18
run 18
out 18
and 18
greet 18
them 18
coin 18
would 18
have 18
me 18
whisked 18
back 18
to 18
before 18
i 18
could 18
say 18
nightlock 18
nightlock 18
nightlock 18
i 18
did 18
not 18
come 18
all 18
this 18
way 18
and 18
lose 18
all 18
those 18
people 18
to 18
turn 18
myself 18
over 18
to 18
that 18
woman 18
i 18
kill 18
snow 18
besides 18
there 18
would 18
be 18
an 18
awful 18
lot 18
of 18
things 18
i 18
couldnt 18
easily 18
explain 18
about 18
the 18
last 18
few 18
days 18
several 18
of 18
which 18
if 18
they 18
came 18
to 18
light 18
would 18
probably 18
blow 18
my 18
deal 18
for 18
the 18
victors 18
immunity 18
right 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
water 18
and 18
forget 18
about 18
me 18
ive 18
got 18
a 18
feeling 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
others 18
are 18
going 18
to 18
need 18
it 18
like 18
peeta 18
who 18
no 18
matter 18
how 18
you 18
spin 18
it 18
can 18
be 18
seen 18
on 18
tape 18
tossing 18
mitchell 18
into 18
that 18
net 18
pod 18
i 18
can 18
imagine 18
what 18
coins 18
war 18
tribunal 18
will 18
do 18
with 18
that 18
by 18
late 18
afternoon 18
were 18
beginning 18
to 18
get 18
uneasy 18
about 18
tigriss 18
long 18
absence 18
talk 18
turns 18
to 18
the 18
possibilities 18
that 18
she 18
has 18
been 18
apprehended 18
and 18
arrested 18
turned 18
us 18
in 18
voluntarily 18
or 18
simply 18
been 18
injured 18
in 18
the 18
wave 18
of 18
refugees 18
but 18
around 18
six 18
oclock 18
we 18
hear 18
her 18
return 18
theres 18
some 18
shuffling 18
around 18
upstairs 18
then 18
she 18
opens 18
the 18
panel 18
the 18
wonderful 18
smell 18
of 18
frying 18
meat 18
fills 18
the 18
air 18
tigris 18
has 18
prepared 18
us 18
a 18
hash 18
of 18
chopped 18
ham 18
and 18
potatoes 18
its 18
the 18
first 18
hot 18
food 18
weve 18
had 18
in 18
days 18
and 18
as 18
i 18
wait 18
for 18
her 18
to 18
fill 18
my 18
plate 18
im 18
in 18
danger 18
of 18
actually 18
drooling 18
as 18
i 18
chew 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
pay 18
attention 18
to 18
tigris 18
telling 18
us 18
how 18
she 18
acquired 18
it 18
but 18
the 18
main 18
thing 18
i 18
absorb 18
is 18
that 18
fur 18
underwear 18
is 18
a 18
valuable 18
trading 18
item 18
at 18
the 18
moment 18
especially 18
for 18
people 18
who 18
left 18
their 18
homes 18
underdressed 18
many 18
are 18
still 18
out 18
on 18
the 18
street 18
trying 18
to 18
find 18
shelter 18
for 18
the 18
night 18
those 18
who 18
live 18
in 18
the 18
choice 18
apartments 18
of 18
the 18
inner 18
city 18
have 18
not 18
flung 18
open 18
their 18
doors 18
to 18
house 18
the 18
displaced 18
on 18
the 18
contrary 18
most 18
of 18
them 18
bolted 18
their 18
locks 18
drew 18
their 18
shutters 18
and 18
pretended 18
to 18
be 18
out 18
now 18
the 18
city 18
circles 18
packed 18
with 18
refugees 18
and 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
are 18
going 18
door 18
to 18
door 18
breaking 18
into 18
places 18
if 18
they 18
have 18
to 18
to 18
assign 18
houseguests 18
on 18
the 18
television 18
we 18
watch 18
a 18
terse 18
head 18
peacekeeper 18
lay 18
out 18
specific 18
rules 18
regarding 18
how 18
many 18
people 18
per 18
square 18
foot 18
each 18
resident 18
will 18
be 18
expected 18
to 18
take 18
in 18
he 18
reminds 18
the 18
citizens 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
that 18
temperatures 18
will 18
drop 18
well 18
below 18
freezing 18
tonight 18
and 18
warns 18
them 18
that 18
their 18
president 18
expects 18
them 18
to 18
be 18
not 18
only 18
willing 18
but 18
enthusiastic 18
hosts 18
in 18
this 18
time 18
of 18
crisis 18
then 18
they 18
show 18
some 18
very 18
stagedlooking 18
shots 18
of 18
concerned 18
citizens 18
welcoming 18
grateful 18
refugees 18
into 18
their 18
homes 18
the 18
head 18
peacekeeper 18
says 18
the 18
president 18
himself 18
has 18
ordered 18
part 18
of 18
his 18
mansion 18
readied 18
to 18
receive 18
citizens 18
tomorrow 18
he 18
adds 18
that 18
shopkeepers 18
should 18
also 18
be 18
prepared 18
to 18
lend 18
their 18
floor 18
space 18
if 18
requested 18
tigris 18
that 18
could 18
be 18
you 18
says 18
peeta 18
i 18
realize 18
hes 18
right 18
that 18
even 18
this 18
narrow 18
hallway 18
of 18
a 18
shop 18
could 18
be 18
appropriated 18
as 18
the 18
numbers 18
swell 18
then 18
well 18
be 18
truly 18
trapped 18
in 18
the 18
cellar 18
in 18
constant 18
danger 18
of 18
discovery 18
how 18
many 18
days 18
do 18
we 18
have 18
one 18
maybe 18
two 18
the 18
head 18
peacekeeper 18
comes 18
back 18
with 18
more 18
instructions 18
for 18
the 18
population 18
it 18
seems 18
that 18
this 18
evening 18
there 18
was 18
an 18
unfortunate 18
incident 18
where 18
a 18
crowd 18
beat 18
to 18
death 18
a 18
young 18
man 18
who 18
resembled 18
peeta 18
henceforth 18
all 18
rebel 18
sightings 18
are 18
to 18
be 18
reported 18
immediately 18
to 18
authorities 18
who 18
will 18
deal 18
with 18
the 18
identification 18
and 18
arrest 18
of 18
the 18
suspect 18
they 18
show 18
a 18
photo 18
of 18
the 18
victim 18
apart 18
from 18
some 18
obviously 18
bleached 18
curls 18
he 18
looks 18
about 18
as 18
much 18
like 18
peeta 18
as 18
i 18
do 18
people 18
have 18
gone 18
wild 18
cressida 18
murmurs 18
we 18
watch 18
a 18
brief 18
rebel 18
update 18
in 18
which 18
we 18
learn 18
that 18
several 18
more 18
blocks 18
have 18
been 18
taken 18
today 18
i 18
make 18
note 18
of 18
the 18
intersections 18
on 18
my 18
map 18
and 18
study 18
it 18
line 18
c 18
is 18
only 18
four 18
blocks 18
from 18
here 18
i 18
announce 18
somehow 18
that 18
fills 18
me 18
with 18
more 18
anxiety 18
than 18
the 18
idea 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
looking 18
for 18
housing 18
i 18
become 18
very 18
helpful 18
let 18
me 18
wash 18
the 18
dishes 18
ill 18
give 18
you 18
a 18
hand 18
gale 18
collects 18
the 18
plates 18
i 18
feel 18
peetas 18
eyes 18
follow 18
us 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
room 18
in 18
the 18
cramped 18
kitchen 18
at 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
tigriss 18
shop 18
i 18
fill 18
the 18
sink 18
with 18
hot 18
water 18
and 18
suds 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
its 18
true 18
i 18
ask 18
that 18
snow 18
will 18
let 18
refugees 18
into 18
the 18
mansion 18
i 18
think 18
he 18
has 18
to 18
now 18
at 18
least 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
says 18
gale 18
im 18
leaving 18
in 18
the 18
morning 18
i 18
say 18
im 18
going 18
with 18
you 18
gale 18
says 18
what 18
should 18
we 18
do 18
with 18
the 18
others 18
pollux 18
and 18
cressida 18
could 18
be 18
useful 18
theyre 18
good 18
guides 18
i 18
say 18
pollux 18
and 18
cressida 18
arent 18
actually 18
the 18
problem 18
but 18
peetas 18
too 18
unpredictable 18
finishes 18
gale 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
hed 18
still 18
let 18
us 18
leave 18
him 18
behind 18
we 18
can 18
make 18
the 18
argument 18
that 18
hell 18
endanger 18
us 18
i 18
say 18
he 18
might 18
stay 18
here 18
if 18
were 18
convincing 18
peetas 18
fairly 18
rational 18
about 18
our 18
suggestion 18
he 18
readily 18
agrees 18
that 18
his 18
company 18
could 18
put 18
the 18
other 18
four 18
of 18
us 18
at 18
risk 18
im 18
thinking 18
this 18
may 18
all 18
work 18
out 18
that 18
he 18
can 18
just 18
sit 18
out 18
the 18
war 18
in 18
tigriss 18
cellar 18
when 18
he 18
announces 18
hes 18
going 18
out 18
on 18
his 18
own 18
to 18
do 18
what 18
asks 18
cressida 18
im 18
not 18
sure 18
exactly 18
the 18
one 18
thing 18
that 18
i 18
might 18
still 18
be 18
useful 18
at 18
is 18
causing 18
a 18
diversion 18
you 18
saw 18
what 18
happened 18
to 18
that 18
man 18
who 18
looked 18
like 18
me 18
he 18
says 18
what 18
if 18
youlose 18
control 18
i 18
say 18
you 18
meango 18
mutt 18
well 18
if 18
i 18
feel 18
that 18
coming 18
on 18
ill 18
try 18
to 18
get 18
back 18
here 18
he 18
assures 18
me 18
and 18
if 18
snow 18
gets 18
you 18
again 18
asks 18
gale 18
you 18
dont 18
even 18
have 18
a 18
gun 18
ill 18
just 18
have 18
to 18
take 18
my 18
chances 18
says 18
peeta 18
like 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
you 18
the 18
two 18
exchange 18
a 18
long 18
look 18
and 18
then 18
gale 18
reaches 18
into 18
his 18
breast 18
pocket 18
he 18
places 18
his 18
nightlock 18
tablet 18
in 18
peetas 18
hand 18
peeta 18
lets 18
it 18
lie 18
on 18
his 18
open 18
palm 18
neither 18
rejecting 18
nor 18
accepting 18
it 18
what 18
about 18
you 18
dont 18
worry 18
beetee 18

me 18
how 18
to 18
detonate 18
my 18
explosive 18
arrows 18
by 18
hand 18
if 18
that 18
fails 18
ive 18
got 18
my 18
knife 18
and 18
ill 18
have 18
katniss 18
says 18
gale 18
with 18
a 18
smile 18
she 18
wont 18
give 18
them 18
the 18
satisfaction 18
of 18
taking 18
me 18
alive 18
the 18
thought 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
dragging 18
gale 18
away 18
starts 18
the 18
tune 18
playing 18
in 18
my 18
head 18
again 18
are 18
you 18
are 18
you 18
coming 18
to 18
the 18
tree 18
take 18
it 18
peeta 18
i 18
say 18
in 18
a 18
strained 18
voice 18
i 18
reach 18
out 18
and 18
close 18
his 18
fingers 18
over 18
the 18
pill 18
no 18
one 18
will 18
be 18
there 18
to 18
help 18
you 18
we 18
spend 18
a 18
fitful 18
night 18
woken 18
by 18
one 18
anothers 18
nightmares 18
minds 18
buzzing 18
with 18
the 18
next 18
days 18
plans 18
im 18
relieved 18
when 18
five 18
oclock 18
rolls 18
around 18
and 18
we 18
can 18
begin 18
whatever 18
this 18
day 18
holds 18
for 18
us 18
we 18
eat 18
a 18
mishmash 18
of 18
our 18
remaining 18
foodcanned 18
peaches 18
crackers 18
and 18
snails 18
leaving 18
one 18
can 18
of 18
salmon 18
for 18
tigris 18
as 18
meager 18
thanks 18
for 18
all 18
shes 18
done 18
the 18
gesture 18
seems 18
to 18
touch 18
her 18
in 18
some 18
way 18
her 18
face 18
contorts 18
in 18
an 18
odd 18
expression 18
and 18
she 18
flies 18
into 18
action 18
she 18
spends 18
the 18
next 18
hour 18
remaking 18
the 18
five 18
of 18
us 18
she 18
redresses 18
us 18
so 18
regular 18
clothes 18
hide 18
our 18
uniforms 18
before 18
we 18
even 18
don 18
our 18
coats 18
and 18
cloaks 18
covers 18
our 18
military 18
boots 18
with 18
some 18
sort 18
of 18
furry 18
slippers 18
secures 18
our 18
wigs 18
with 18
pins 18
cleans 18
off 18
the 18
garish 18
remains 18
of 18
the 18
paint 18
we 18
so 18
hastily 18
applied 18
to 18
our 18
faces 18
and 18
makes 18
us 18
up 18
again 18
drapes 18
our 18
outerwear 18
to 18
conceal 18
our 18
weapons 18
then 18
gives 18
us 18
handbags 18
and 18
bundles 18
of 18
knickknacks 18
to 18
carry 18
in 18
the 18
end 18
we 18
look 18
exactly 18
like 18
the 18
refugees 18
fleeing 18
the 18
rebels 18
never 18
underestimate 18
the 18
power 18
of 18
a 18
brilliant 18
stylist 18
says 18
peeta 18
its 18
hard 18
to 18
tell 18
but 18
i 18
think 18
tigris 18
might 18
actually 18
blush 18
under 18
her 18
stripes 18
there 18
are 18
no 18
helpful 18
updates 18
on 18
the 18
television 18
but 18
the 18
alley 18
seems 18
as 18
thick 18
with 18
refugees 18
as 18
the 18
previous 18
morning 18
our 18
plan 18
is 18
to 18
slip 18
into 18
the 18
crowd 18
in 18
three 18
groups 18
first 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
who 18
will 18
act 18
as 18
guides 18
while 18
keeping 18
a 18
safe 18
lead 18
on 18
us 18
then 18
gale 18
and 18
myself 18
who 18
intend 18
to 18
position 18
ourselves 18
among 18
the 18
refugees 18
assigned 18
to 18
the 18
mansion 18
today 18
then 18
peeta 18
who 18
will 18
trail 18
behind 18
us 18
ready 18
to 18
create 18
a 18
disturbance 18
as 18
needed 18
tigris 18
watches 18
through 18
the 18
shutters 18
for 18
the 18
right 18
moment 18
unbolts 18
the 18
door 18
and 18
nods 18
to 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
take 18
care 18
cressida 18
says 18
and 18
they 18
are 18
gone 18
well 18
be 18
following 18
in 18
a 18
minute 18
i 18
get 18
out 18
the 18
key 18
unlock 18
peetas 18
cuffs 18
and 18
stuff 18
them 18
in 18
my 18
pocket 18
he 18
rubs 18
his 18
wrists 18
flexes 18
them 18
i 18
feel 18
a 18
kind 18
of 18
desperation 18
rising 18
up 18
in 18
me 18
its 18
like 18
im 18
back 18
in 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
with 18
beetee 18
giving 18
johanna 18
and 18
me 18
that 18
coil 18
of 18
wire 18
listen 18
i 18
say 18
dont 18
do 18
anything 18
foolish 18
no 18
its 18
lastresort 18
stuff 18
completely 18
he 18
says 18
i 18
wrap 18
my 18
arms 18
around 18
his 18
neck 18
feel 18
his 18
arms 18
hesitate 18
before 18
they 18
embrace 18
me 18
not 18
as 18
steady 18
as 18
they 18
once 18
were 18
but 18
still 18
warm 18
and 18
strong 18
a 18
thousand 18
moments 18
surge 18
through 18
me 18
all 18
the 18
times 18
these 18
arms 18
were 18
my 18
only 18
refuge 18
from 18
the 18
world 18
perhaps 18
not 18
fully 18
appreciated 18
then 18
but 18
so 18
sweet 18
in 18
my 18
memory 18
and 18
now 18
gone 18
forever 18
all 18
right 18
then 18
i 18
release 18
him 18
its 18
time 18
says 18
tigris 18
i 18
kiss 18
her 18
cheek 18
fasten 18
my 18
red 18
hooded 18
cloak 18
pull 18
my 18
scarf 18
up 18
over 18
my 18
nose 18
and 18
follow 18
gale 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
frigid 18
air 18
sharp 18
icy 18
snowflakes 18
bite 18
my 18
exposed 18
skin 18
the 18
rising 18
suns 18
trying 18
to 18
break 18
through 18
the 18
gloom 18
without 18
much 18
success 18
theres 18
enough 18
light 18
to 18
see 18
the 18
bundled 18
forms 18
closest 18
to 18
you 18
and 18
little 18
more 18
perfect 18
conditions 18
really 18
except 18
that 18
i 18
cant 18
locate 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
drop 18
our 18
heads 18
and 18
shuffle 18
along 18
with 18
the 18
refugees 18
i 18
can 18
hear 18
what 18
i 18
missed 18
peeking 18
through 18
the 18
shutters 18
yesterday 18
crying 18
moaning 18
labored 18
breathing 18
and 18
not 18
too 18
far 18
away 18
gunfire 18
where 18

the 18
man 18

turn 18
off 18
the 18
alley 18
and 18
spill 18
out 18
onto 18
one 18
of 18
the 18
main 18
avenues 18
stay 18
to 18
the 18
right 18
a 18
voice 18
orders 18
and 18
i 18
see 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
interspersed 18
throughout 18
the 18
crowd 18
directing 18
the 18
flow 18
of 18
human 18
traffic 18
scared 18
faces 18
peer 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
plateglass 18
windows 18
of 18
the 18
shops 18
which 18
are 18
already 18
becoming 18
overrun 18
with 18
refugees 18
at 18
this 18
rate 18
tigris 18
may 18
have 18
new 18
houseguests 18
by 18
lunch 18
it 18
was 18
good 18
for 18
everybody 18
that 18
we 18
got 18
out 18
when 18
we 18
did 18
its 18
brighter 18
now 18
even 18
with 18
the 18
snow 18
picking 18
up 18
i 18
catch 18
sight 18
of 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
about 18
thirty 18
yards 18
ahead 18
of 18
us 18
plodding 18
along 18
with 18
the 18
crowd 18
i 18
crane 18
my 18
head 18
around 18
to 18
see 18
if 18
i 18
can 18
locate 18
peeta 18
i 18
cant 18
but 18
ive 18
caught 18
the 18
eye 18
of 18
an 18
inquisitivelooking 18
little 18
girl 18
in 18
a 18
lemon 18
yellow 18
coat 18
i 18
nudge 18
gale 18
and 18
slow 18
my 18
pace 18
ever 18
so 18
slightly 18
to 18
allow 18
a 18
wall 18
of 18
people 18
to 18
form 18
between 18
us 18
we 18
might 18
need 18
to 18
split 18
up 18
i 18
say 18
under 18
my 18
breath 18
theres 18
a 18
girl 18
gunfire 18
rips 18
through 18
the 18
crowd 18
and 18
several 18
people 18
near 18
me 18
slump 18
to 18
the 18
ground 18
screams 18
pierce 18
the 18
air 18
as 18
a 18
second 18
round 18
mows 18
down 18
another 18
group 18
behind 18
us 18
gale 18
and 18
i 18
drop 18
to 18
the 18
street 18
scuttle 18
the 18
ten 18
yards 18
to 18
the 18
shops 18
and 18
take 18
cover 18
behind 18
a 18
display 18
of 18
spikeheeled 18
boots 18
outside 18
a 18
shoe 18
sellers 18
a 18
row 18
of 18
feathery 18
footwear 18
blocks 18
gales 18
view 18
who 18
is 18
it 18
can 18
you 18
see 18
he 18
asks 18
me 18
what 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
between 18
alternating 18
pairs 18
of 18
lavender 18
and 18
mint 18
green 18
leather 18
boots 18
is 18
a 18
street 18
full 18
of 18
bodies 18
the 18
little 18
girl 18
who 18
was 18
watching 18
me 18
kneels 18
beside 18
a 18
motionless 18
woman 18
screeching 18
and 18
trying 18
to 18
rouse 18
her 18
another 18
wave 18
of 18
bullets 18
slices 18
across 18
the 18
chest 18
of 18
her 18
yellow 18
coat 18
staining 18
it 18
with 18
red 18
knocking 18
the 18
girl 18
onto 18
her 18
back 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
looking 18
at 18
her 18
tiny 18
crumpled 18
form 18
i 18
lose 18
my 18
ability 18
to 18
form 18
words 18
gale 18
prods 18
me 18
with 18
his 18
elbow 18
katniss 18
theyre 18
shooting 18
from 18
the 18
roof 18
above 18
us 18
i 18
tell 18
gale 18
i 18
watch 18
a 18
few 18
more 18
rounds 18
see 18
the 18
white 18
uniforms 18
dropping 18
into 18
the 18
snowy 18
streets 18
trying 18
to 18
take 18
out 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
but 18
theyre 18
not 18
exactly 18
crack 18
shots 18
it 18
must 18
be 18
the 18
rebels 18
i 18
dont 18
feel 18
a 18
rush 18
of 18
joy 18
although 18
theoretically 18
my 18
allies 18
have 18
broken 18
through 18
i 18
am 18
transfixed 18
by 18
that 18
lemon 18
yellow 18
coat 18
if 18
we 18
start 18
shooting 18
thats 18
it 18
gale 18
says 18
the 18
whole 18
world 18
will 18
know 18
its 18
us 18
its 18
true 18
were 18
armed 18
only 18
with 18
our 18
fabulous 18
bows 18
to 18
release 18
an 18
arrow 18
would 18
be 18
like 18
announcing 18
to 18
both 18
sides 18
that 18
were 18
here 18
no 18
i 18
say 18
forcefully 18
weve 18
got 18
to 18
get 18
to 18
snow 18
then 18
we 18
better 18
start 18
moving 18
before 18
the 18
whole 18
block 18
goes 18
up 18
says 18
gale 18
hugging 18
the 18
wall 18
we 18
continue 18
along 18
the 18
street 18
only 18
the 18
wall 18
is 18
mostly 18
shopwindows 18
a 18
pattern 18
of 18
sweaty 18
palms 18
and 18
gaping 18
faces 18
presses 18
against 18
the 18
glass 18
i 18
yank 18
my 18
scarf 18
up 18
higher 18
over 18
my 18
cheekbones 18
as 18
we 18
dart 18
between 18
outdoor 18
displays 18
behind 18
a 18
rack 18
of 18
framed 18
photos 18
of 18
snow 18
we 18
encounter 18
a 18
wounded 18
peacekeeper 18
propped 18
against 18
a 18
strip 18
of 18
brick 18
wall 18
he 18
asks 18
us 18
for 18
help 18
gale 18
knees 18
him 18
in 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
head 18
and 18
takes 18
his 18
gun 18
at 18
the 18
intersection 18
he 18
shoots 18
a 18
second 18
peacekeeper 18
and 18
we 18
both 18
have 18
firearms 18
so 18
who 18
are 18
we 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
now 18
i 18
ask 18
desperate 18
citizens 18
of 18
the 18
capitol 18
says 18
gale 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
will 18
think 18
were 18
on 18
their 18
side 18
and 18
hopefully 18
the 18
rebels 18
have 18
more 18
interesting 18
targets 18
im 18
mulling 18
over 18
the 18
wisdom 18
of 18
this 18
latest 18
role 18
as 18
we 18
sprint 18
across 18
the 18
intersection 18
but 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
we 18
reach 18
the 18
next 18
block 18
it 18
no 18
longer 18
matters 18
who 18
we 18
are 18
who 18
anyone 18
is 18
because 18
no 18
one 18
is 18
looking 18
at 18
faces 18
the 18
rebels 18
are 18
here 18
all 18
right 18
pouring 18
onto 18
the 18
avenue 18
taking 18
cover 18
in 18
doorways 18
behind 18
vehicles 18
guns 18
blazing 18
hoarse 18
voices 18
shouting 18
commands 18
as 18
they 18
prepare 18
to 18
meet 18
an 18
army 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
marching 18
toward 18
us 18
caught 18
in 18
the 18
cross 18
fire 18
are 18
the 18
refugees 18
unarmed 18
disoriented 18
many 18
wounded 18
a 18
pods 18
activated 18
ahead 18
of 18
us 18
releasing 18
a 18
gush 18
of 18
steam 18
that 18
parboils 18
everyone 18
in 18
its 18
path 18
leaving 18
the 18
victims 18
intestinepink 18
and 18
very 18
dead 18
after 18
that 18
what 18
little 18
sense 18
of 18
order 18
there 18
was 18
unravels 18
as 18
the 18
remaining 18
curlicues 18
of 18
steam 18
intertwine 18
with 18
the 18
snow 18
visibility 18
extends 18
just 18
to 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
my 18
barrel 18
peacekeeper 18
rebel 18
citizen 18
who 18
knows 18
everything 18
that 18
moves 18
is 18
a 18
target 18
people 18
shoot 18
reflexively 18
and 18
im 18
no 18
exception 18
heart 18
pounding 18
adrenaline 18
burning 18
through 18
me 18
everyone 18
is 18
my 18
enemy 18
except 18
gale 18
my 18
hunting 18
partner 18
the 18
one 18
person 18
who 18
has 18
my 18
back 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
but 18
move 18
forward 18
killing 18
whoever 18
comes 18
into 18
our 18
path 18
screaming 18
people 18
bleeding 18
people 18
dead 18
people 18
everywhere 18
as 18
we 18
reach 18
the 18
next 18
corner 18
the 18
entire 18
block 18
ahead 18
of 18
us 18
lights 18
up 18
with 18
a 18
rich 18
purple 18
glow 18
we 18
backpedal 18
hunker 18
down 18
in 18
a 18
stairwell 18
and 18
squint 18
into 18
the 18
light 18
somethings 18
happening 18
to 18
those 18
illuminated 18
by 18
it 18
theyre 18
assaulted 18
bywhat 18
a 18
sound 18
a 18
wave 18
a 18
laser 18
weapons 18
fall 18
from 18
their 18
hands 18
fingers 18
clutch 18
their 18
faces 18
as 18
blood 18
sprays 18
from 18
all 18
visible 18
orificeseyes 18
noses 18
mouths 18
ears 18
in 18
less 18
than 18
a 18
minute 18
everyones 18
dead 18
and 18
the 18
glow 18
vanishes 18
i 18
grit 18
my 18
teeth 18
and 18
run 18
leaping 18
over 18
the 18
bodies 18
feet 18
slipping 18
in 18
the 18
gore 18
the 18
wind 18
whips 18
the 18
snow 18
into 18
blinding 18
swirls 18
but 18
doesnt 18
block 18
out 18
the 18
sound 18
of 18
another 18
wave 18
of 18
boots 18
headed 18
our 18
way 18
get 18
down 18
i 18
hiss 18
at 18
gale 18
we 18
drop 18
where 18
we 18
are 18
my 18
face 18
lands 18
in 18
a 18
stillwarm 18
pool 18
of 18
someones 18
blood 18
but 18
i 18
play 18
dead 18
remain 18
motionless 18
as 18
the 18
boots 18
march 18
over 18
us 18
some 18
avoid 18
the 18
bodies 18
others 18
grind 18
into 18
my 18
hand 18
my 18
back 18
kick 18
my 18
head 18
in 18
passing 18
as 18
the 18
boots 18
recede 18
i 18
open 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18
nod 18
to 18
gale 18
on 18
the 18
next 18
block 18
we 18
encounter 18
more 18
terrified 18
refugees 18
but 18
few 18
soldiers 18
just 18
when 18
it 18
seems 18
we 18
might 18
have 18
caught 18
a 18
break 18
theres 18
a 18
cracking 18
sound 18
like 18
an 18
egg 18
hitting 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
a 18
bowl 18
but 18
magnified 18
a 18
thousand 18
times 18
we 18
stop 18
look 18
around 18
for 18
the 18
pod 18
theres 18
nothing 18
then 18
i 18
feel 18
the 18
tips 18
of 18
my 18
boots 18
beginning 18
to 18
tilt 18
ever 18
so 18
slightly 18
run 18
i 18
cry 18
to 18
gale 18
theres 18
no 18
time 18
to 18
explain 18
but 18
in 18
a 18
few 18
seconds 18
the 18
nature 18
of 18
the 18
pod 18
becomes 18
clear 18
to 18
everyone 18
a 18
seam 18
has 18
opened 18
up 18
down 18
the 18
center 18
of 18
the 18
block 18
the 18
two 18
sides 18
of 18
the 18
tiled 18
street 18
are 18
folding 18
down 18
like 18
flaps 18
slowly 18
emptying 18
the 18
people 18
into 18
whatever 18
lies 18
beneath 18
im 18
torn 18
between 18
making 18
a 18
beeline 18
for 18
the 18
next 18
intersection 18
and 18
trying 18
to 18
get 18
to 18
the 18
doors 18
that 18
line 18
the 18
street 18
and 18
break 18
my 18
way 18
into 18
a 18
building 18
as 18
a 18
result 18
i 18
end 18
up 18
moving 18
at 18
a 18
slight 18
diagonal 18
as 18
the 18
flap 18
continues 18
to 18
drop 18
i 18
find 18
my 18
feet 18
scrambling 18
harder 18
and 18
harder 18
to 18
find 18
purchase 18
on 18
the 18
slippery 18
tiles 18
its 18
like 18
running 18
along 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
an 18
icy 18
hill 18
that 18
gets 18
steeper 18
at 18
every 18
step 18
both 18
of 18
my 18
destinationsthe 18
intersection 18
and 18
the 18
buildingsare 18
a 18
few 18
feet 18
away 18
when 18
i 18
feel 18
the 18
flap 18
going 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
do 18
but 18
use 18
my 18
last 18
seconds 18
of 18
connection 18
to 18
the 18
tiles 18
to 18
push 18
off 18
for 18
the 18
intersection 18
as 18
my 18
hands 18
latch 18
on 18
to 18
the 18
side 18
i 18
realize 18
the 18
flaps 18
have 18
swung 18
straight 18
down 18
my 18
feet 18
dangle 18
in 18
the 18
air 18
no 18
foothold 18
anywhere 18
from 18
fifty 18
feet 18
below 18
a 18
vile 18
stench 18
hits 18
my 18
nose 18
like 18
rotted 18
corpses 18
in 18
the 18
summer 18
heat 18
black 18
forms 18
crawl 18
around 18
in 18
the 18
shadows 18
silencing 18
whoever 18
survives 18
the 18
fall 18
a 18
strangled 18
cry 18
comes 18
from 18
my 18
throat 18
no 18
one 18
is 18
coming 18
to 18
help 18
me 18
im 18
losing 18
my 18
grip 18
on 18
the 18
icy 18
ledge 18
when 18
i 18
see 18
im 18
only 18
about 18
six 18
feet 18
from 18
the 18
corner 18
of 18
the 18
pod 18
i 18
inch 18
my 18
hands 18
along 18
the 18
ledge 18
trying 18
to 18
block 18
out 18
the 18
terrifying 18
sounds 18
from 18
below 18
when 18
my 18
hands 18
straddle 18
the 18
corner 18
i 18
swing 18
my 18
right 18
boot 18
up 18
over 18
the 18
side 18
it 18
catches 18
on 18
something 18
and 18
i 18
painstakingly 18
drag 18
myself 18
up 18
to 18
street 18
level 18
panting 18
trembling 18
i 18
crawl 18
out 18
and 18
wrap 18
my 18
arm 18
around 18
a 18
lamppost 18
for 18
an 18
anchor 18
although 18
the 18
grounds 18
perfectly 18
flat 18
gale 18
i 18
call 18
into 18
the 18
abyss 18
heedless 18
of 18
being 18
recognized 18
gale 18
over 18
here 18
i 18
look 18
in 18
bewilderment 18
to 18
my 18
left 18
the 18
flap 18
held 18
up 18
everything 18
to 18
the 18
very 18
base 18
of 18
the 18
buildings 18
a 18
dozen 18
or 18
so 18
people 18
made 18
it 18
that 18
far 18
and 18
now 18
hang 18
from 18
whatever 18
provides 18
a 18
handhold 18
doorknobs 18
knockers 18
mail 18
slots 18
three 18
doors 18
down 18
from 18
me 18
gale 18
clings 18
to 18
the 18
decorative 18
iron 18
grating 18
around 18
an 18
apartment 18
door 18
he 18
could 18
easily 18
get 18
inside 18
if 18
it 18
was 18
open 18
but 18
despite 18
repeated 18
kicks 18
to 18
the 18
door 18
no 18
one 18
comes 18
to 18
his 18
aid 18
cover 18
yourself 18
i 18
lift 18
my 18
gun 18
he 18
turns 18
away 18
and 18
i 18
drill 18
the 18
lock 18
until 18
the 18
door 18
flies 18
inward 18
gale 18
swings 18
into 18
the 18
doorway 18
landing 18
in 18
a 18
heap 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
for 18
a 18
moment 18
i 18
experience 18
the 18
elation 18
of 18
his 18
rescue 18
then 18
the 18
whitegloved 18
hands 18
clamp 18
down 18
on 18
him 18
gale 18
meets 18
my 18
eyes 18
mouths 18
something 18
at 18
me 18
i 18
cant 18
make 18
out 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
i 18
cant 18
leave 18
him 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
reach 18
him 18
either 18
his 18
lips 18
move 18
again 18
i 18
shake 18
my 18
head 18
to 18
indicate 18
my 18
confusion 18
at 18
any 18
minute 18
theyll 18
realize 18
who 18
theyve 18
captured 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
are 18
hauling 18
him 18
inside 18
now 18
go 18
i 18
hear 18
him 18
yell 18
i 18
turn 18
and 18
run 18
away 18
from 18
the 18
pod 18
all 18
alone 18
now 18
gale 18
a 18
prisoner 18
cressida 18
and 18
pollux 18
could 18
be 18
dead 18
ten 18
times 18
over 18
and 18
peeta 18
i 18
havent 18
laid 18
eyes 18
on 18
him 18
since 18
we 18
left 18
tigriss 18
i 18
hold 18
on 18
to 18
the 18
idea 18
that 18
he 18
may 18
have 18
gone 18
back 18
felt 18
an 18
attack 18
coming 18
and 18
retreated 18
to 18
the 18
cellar 18
while 18
he 18
still 18
had 18
control 18
realized 18
there 18
was 18
no 18
need 18
for 18
a 18
diversion 18
when 18
the 18
capitol 18
has 18
provided 18
so 18
many 18
no 18
need 18
to 18
be 18
bait 18
and 18
have 18
to 18
take 18
the 18
nightlockthe 18
nightlock 18
gale 18
doesnt 18
have 18
any 18
and 18
as 18
for 18
all 18
that 18
talk 18
of 18
detonating 18
his 18
arrows 18
by 18
hand 18
hell 18
never 18
get 18
the 18
chance 18
the 18
first 18
thing 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
will 18
do 18
is 18
to 18
strip 18
him 18
of 18
his 18
weapons 18
i 18
fall 18
into 18
a 18
doorway 18
tears 18
stinging 18
my 18
eyes 18
shoot 18
me 18
thats 18
what 18
he 18
was 18
mouthing 18
i 18
was 18
supposed 18
to 18
shoot 18
him 18
that 18
was 18
my 18
job 18
that 18
was 18
our 18
unspoken 18
promise 18
all 18
of 18
us 18
to 18
one 18
another 18
and 18
i 18
didnt 18
do 18
it 18
and 18
now 18
the 18
capitol 18
will 18
kill 18
him 18
or 18
torture 18
him 18
or 18
hijack 18
him 18
orthe 18
cracks 18
begin 18
opening 18
inside 18
me 18
threatening 18
to 18
break 18
me 18
into 18
pieces 18
i 18
have 18
only 18
one 18
hope 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
falls 18
lays 18
down 18
its 18
arms 18
and 18
gives 18
up 18
its 18
prisoners 18
before 18
they 18
hurt 18
gale 18
but 18
i 18
cant 18
see 18
that 18
happening 18
while 18
snows 18
alive 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
peacekeepers 18
runs 18
by 18
barely 18
glancing 18
at 18
the 18
whimpering 18
capitol 18
girl 18
huddled 18
in 18
a 18
doorway 18
i 18
choke 18
down 18
my 18
tears 18
wipe 18
the 18
existing 18
ones 18
off 18
my 18
face 18
before 18
they 18
can 18
freeze 18
and 18
pull 18
myself 18
back 18
together 18
okay 18
im 18
still 18
an 18
anonymous 18
refugee 18
or 18
did 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
who 18
caught 18
gale 18
get 18
a 18
glimpse 18
of 18
me 18
as 18
i 18
fled 18
i 18
remove 18
my 18
cloak 18
and 18
turn 18
it 18
inside 18
out 18
letting 18
the 18
black 18
lining 18
show 18
instead 18
of 18
the 18
red 18
exterior 18
arrange 18
the 18
hood 18
so 18
it 18
conceals 18
my 18
face 18
grasping 18
my 18
gun 18
close 18
to 18
my 18
chest 18
i 18
survey 18
the 18
block 18
theres 18
only 18
a 18
handful 18
of 18
dazedlooking 18
stragglers 18
i 18
trail 18
close 18
behind 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
old 18
men 18
who 18
take 18
no 18
notice 18
of 18
me 18
no 18
one 18
will 18
expect 18
me 18
to 18
be 18
with 18
old 18
men 18
when 18
we 18
reach 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
the 18
next 18
intersection 18
they 18
stop 18
and 18
i 18
almost 18
bump 18
into 18
them 18
its 18
the 18
city 18
circle 18
across 18
the 18
wide 18
expanse 18
ringed 18
by 18
grand 18
buildings 18
sits 18
the 18
presidents 18
mansion 18
the 18
circles 18
full 18
of 18
people 18
milling 18
around 18
wailing 18
or 18
just 18
sitting 18
and 18
letting 18
the 18
snow 18
pile 18
up 18
around 18
them 18
i 18
fit 18
right 18
in 18
i 18
begin 18
to 18
weave 18
my 18
way 18
across 18
to 18
the 18
mansion 18
tripping 18
over 18
abandoned 18
treasures 18
and 18
snowfrosted 18
limbs 18
about 18
halfway 18
there 18
i 18
become 18
aware 18
of 18
the 18
concrete 18
barricade 18
its 18
about 18
four 18
feet 18
high 18
and 18
extends 18
in 18
a 18
large 18
rectangle 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
the 18
mansion 18
you 18
would 18
think 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
empty 18
but 18
its 18
packed 18
with 18
refugees 18
maybe 18
this 18
is 18
the 18
group 18
thats 18
been 18
chosen 18
to 18
be 18
sheltered 18
at 18
the 18
mansion 18
but 18
as 18
i 18
draw 18
closer 18
i 18
notice 18
something 18
else 18
everyone 18
inside 18
the 18
barricade 18
is 18
a 18
child 18
toddlers 18
to 18
teenagers 18
scared 18
and 18
frostbitten 18
huddled 18
in 18
groups 18
or 18
rocking 18
numbly 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
they 18
arent 18
being 18
led 18
into 18
the 18
mansion 18
theyre 18
penned 18
in 18
guarded 18
on 18
all 18
sides 18
by 18
peacekeepers 18
i 18
know 18
immediately 18
its 18
not 18
for 18
their 18
protection 18
if 18
the 18
capitol 18
wanted 18
to 18
safeguard 18
them 18
theyd 18
be 18
down 18
in 18
a 18
bunker 18
somewhere 18
this 18
is 18
for 18
snows 18
protection 18
the 18
children 18
form 18
his 18
human 18
shield 18
theres 18
a 18
commotion 18
and 18
the 18
crowd 18
surges 18
to 18
the 18
left 18
im 18
caught 18
up 18
by 18
larger 18
bodies 18
borne 18
sideways 18
carried 18
off 18
course 18
i 18
hear 18
shouts 18
of 18
the 18
rebels 18
the 18
rebels 18
and 18
know 18
they 18
mustve 18
broken 18
through 18
the 18
momentum 18
slams 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
flagpole 18
and 18
i 18
cling 18
to 18
it 18
using 18
the 18
rope 18
that 18
hangs 18
from 18
the 18
top 18
i 18
pull 18
myself 18
up 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
crush 18
of 18
bodies 18
yes 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
the 18
rebel 18
army 18
pouring 18
into 18
the 18
circle 18
driving 18
the 18
refugees 18
back 18
onto 18
the 18
avenues 18
i 18
scan 18
the 18
area 18
for 18
the 18
pods 18
that 18
will 18
surely 18
be 18
detonating 18
but 18
that 18
doesnt 18
happen 18
this 18
is 18
what 18
happens 18
a 18
hovercraft 18
marked 18
with 18
the 18
capitols 18
seal 18
materializes 18
directly 18
over 18
the 18
barricaded 18
children 18
scores 18
of 18
silver 18
parachutes 18
rain 18
down 18
on 18
them 18
even 18
in 18
this 18
chaos 18
the 18
children 18
know 18
what 18
silver 18
parachutes 18
contain 18
food 18
medicine 18
gifts 18
they 18
eagerly 18
scoop 18
them 18
up 18
frozen 18
fingers 18
struggling 18
with 18
the 18
strings 18
the 18
hovercraft 18
vanishes 18
five 18
seconds 18
pass 18
and 18
then 18
about 18
twenty 18
parachutes 18
simultaneously 18
explode 18
a 18
wail 18
rises 18
from 18
the 18
crowd 18
the 18
snows 18
red 18
and 18
littered 18
with 18
undersized 18
body 18
parts 18
many 18
of 18
the 18
children 18
die 18
immediately 18
but 18
others 18
lie 18
in 18
agony 18
on 18
the 18
ground 18
some 18
stagger 18
around 18
mutely 18
staring 18
at 18
the 18
remaining 18
silver 18
parachutes 18
in 18
their 18
hands 18
as 18
if 18
they 18
still 18
might 18
have 18
something 18
precious 18
inside 18
i 18
can 18
tell 18
the 18
peacekeepers 18
didnt 18
know 18
this 18
was 18
coming 18
by 18
the 18
way 18
they 18
are 18
yanking 18
away 18
the 18
barricades 18
making 18
a 18
path 18
to 18
the 18
children 18
another 18
flock 18
of 18
white 18
uniforms 18
sweeps 18
into 18
the 18
opening 18
but 18
these 18
arent 18
peacekeepers 18
theyre 18
medics 18
rebel 18
medics 18
id 18
know 18
the 18
uniforms 18
anywhere 18
they 18
swarm 18
in 18
among 18
the 18
children 18
wielding 18
medical 18
kits 18
first 18
i 18
get 18
a 18
glimpse 18
of 18
the 18
blond 18
braid 18
down 18
her 18
back 18
then 18
as 18
she 18
yanks 18
off 18
her 18
coat 18
to 18
cover 18
a 18
wailing 18
child 18
i 18
notice 18
the 18
duck 18
tail 18
formed 18
by 18
her 18
untucked 18
shirt 18
i 18
have 18
the 18
same 18
reaction 18
i 18
did 18
the 18
day 18
effie 18
trinket 18
called 18
her 18
name 18
at 18
the 18
reaping 18
at 18
least 18
i 18
must 18
go 18
limp 18
because 18
i 18
find 18
myself 18
at 18
the 18
base 18
of 18
the 18
flagpole 18
unable 18
to 18
account 18
for 18
the 18
last 18
few 18
seconds 18
then 18
i 18
am 18
pushing 18
through 18
the 18
crowd 18
just 18
as 18
i 18
did 18
before 18
trying 18
to 18
shout 18
her 18
name 18
above 18
the 18
roar 18
im 18
almost 18
there 18
almost 18
to 18
the 18
barricade 18
when 18
i 18
think 18
she 18
hears 18
me 18
because 18
for 18
just 18
a 18
moment 18
she 18
catches 18
sight 18
of 18
me 18
her 18
lips 18
form 18
my 18
name 18
and 18
thats 18
when 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
parachutes 18
go 18
off 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
i 18
am 18
on 18
fire 18
the 18
balls 18
of 18
flame 18
that 18
erupted 18
from 18
the 18
parachutes 18
shot 18
over 18
the 18
barricades 18
through 18
the 18
snowy 18
air 18
and 18
landed 18
in 18
the 18
crowd 18
i 18
was 18
just 18
turning 18
away 18
when 18
one 18
caught 18
me 18
ran 18
its 18
tongue 18
up 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
my 18
body 18
and 18
transformed 18
me 18
into 18
something 18
new 18
a 18
creature 18
as 18
unquenchable 18
as 18
the 18
sun 18
a 18
fire 18
mutt 18
knows 18
only 18
a 18
single 18
sensation 18
agony 18
no 18
sight 18
no 18
sound 18
no 18
feeling 18
except 18
the 18
unrelenting 18
burning 18
of 18
flesh 18
perhaps 18
there 18
are 18
periods 18
of 18
unconsciousness 18
but 18
what 18
can 18
it 18
matter 18
if 18
i 18
cant 18
find 18
refuge 18
in 18
them 18
i 18
am 18
cinnas 18
bird 18
ignited 18
flying 18
frantically 18
to 18
escape 18
something 18
inescapable 18
the 18
feathers 18
of 18
flame 18
that 18
grow 18
from 18
my 18
body 18
beating 18
my 18
wings 18
only 18
fans 18
the 18
blaze 18
i 18
consume 18
myself 18
but 18
to 18
no 18
end 18
finally 18
my 18
wings 18
begin 18
to 18
falter 18
i 18
lose 18
height 18
and 18
gravity 18
pulls 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
foamy 18
sea 18
the 18
color 18
of 18
finnicks 18
eyes 18
i 18
float 18
on 18
my 18
back 18
which 18
continues 18
to 18
burn 18
beneath 18
the 18
water 18
but 18
the 18
agony 18
quiets 18
to 18
pain 18
when 18
i 18
am 18
adrift 18
and 18
unable 18
to 18
navigate 18
thats 18
when 18
they 18
come 18
the 18
dead 18
the 18
ones 18
i 18
loved 18
fly 18
as 18
birds 18
in 18
the 18
open 18
sky 18
above 18
me 18
soaring 18
weaving 18
calling 18
to 18
me 18
to 18
join 18
them 18
i 18
want 18
so 18
badly 18
to 18
follow 18
them 18
but 18
the 18
seawater 18
saturates 18
my 18
wings 18
making 18
it 18
impossible 18
to 18
lift 18
them 18
the 18
ones 18
i 18
hated 18
have 18
taken 18
to 18
the 18
water 18
horrible 18
scaled 18
things 18
that 18
tear 18
my 18
salty 18
flesh 18
with 18
needle 18
teeth 18
biting 18
again 18
and 18
again 18
dragging 18
me 18
beneath 18
the 18
surface 18
the 18
small 18
white 18
bird 18
tinged 18
in 18
pink 18
dives 18
down 18
buries 18
her 18
claws 18
in 18
my 18
chest 18
and 18
tries 18
to 18
keep 18
me 18
afloat 18
no 18
katniss 18
no 18
you 18
cant 18
go 18
but 18
the 18
ones 18
i 18
hated 18
are 18
winning 18
and 18
if 18
she 18
clings 18
to 18
me 18
shell 18
be 18
lost 18
as 18
well 18
prim 18
let 18
go 18
and 18
finally 18
she 18
doesdeep 18
in 18
the 18
water 18
im 18
deserted 18
by 18
all 18
theres 18
only 18
the 18
sound 18
of 18
my 18
breathing 18
the 18
enormous 18
effort 18
it 18
takes 18
to 18
draw 18
the 18
water 18
in 18
push 18
it 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
lungs 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
stop 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
hold 18
my 18
breath 18
but 18
the 18
sea 18
forces 18
its 18
way 18
in 18
and 18
out 18
against 18
my 18
will 18
let 18
me 18
die 18
let 18
me 18
follow 18
the 18
others 18
i 18
beg 18
whatever 18
holds 18
me 18
here 18
theres 18
no 18
response 18
trapped 18
for 18
days 18
years 18
centuries 18
maybe 18
dead 18
but 18
not 18
allowed 18
to 18
die 18
alive 18
but 18
as 18
good 18
as 18
dead 18
so 18
alone 18
that 18
anyone 18
anything 18
no 18
matter 18
how 18
loathsome 18
would 18
be 18
welcome 18
but 18
when 18
i 18
finally 18
have 18
a 18
visitor 18
its 18
sweet 18
morphling 18
coursing 18
through 18
my 18
veins 18
easing 18
the 18
pain 18
lightening 18
my 18
body 18
so 18
that 18
it 18
rises 18
back 18
toward 18
the 18
air 18
and 18
rests 18
again 18
on 18
the 18
foam 18
foam 18
i 18
really 18
am 18
floating 18
on 18
foam 18
i 18
can 18
feel 18
it 18
beneath 18
the 18
tips 18
of 18
my 18
fingers 18
cradling 18
parts 18
of 18
my 18
naked 18
body 18
theres 18
much 18
pain 18
but 18
theres 18
also 18
something 18
like 18
reality 18
the 18
sandpaper 18
of 18
my 18
throat 18
the 18
smell 18
of 18
burn 18
medicine 18
from 18
the 18
first 18
arena 18
the 18
sound 18
of 18
my 18
mothers 18
voice 18
these 18
things 18
frighten 18
me 18
and 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
return 18
to 18
the 18
deep 18
to 18
make 18
sense 18
of 18
them 18
but 18
theres 18
no 18
going 18
back 18
gradually 18
im 18
forced 18
to 18
accept 18
who 18
i 18
am 18
a 18
badly 18
burned 18
girl 18
with 18
no 18
wings 18
with 18
no 18
fire 18
and 18
no 18
sister 18
in 18
the 18
dazzling 18
white 18
capitol 18
hospital 18
the 18
doctors 18
work 18
their 18
magic 18
on 18
me 18
draping 18
my 18
rawness 18
in 18
new 18
sheets 18
of 18
skin 18
coaxing 18
the 18
cells 18
into 18
thinking 18
they 18
are 18
my 18
own 18
manipulating 18
my 18
body 18
parts 18
bending 18
and 18
stretching 18
the 18
limbs 18
to 18
assure 18
a 18
good 18
fit 18
i 18
hear 18
over 18
and 18
over 18
again 18
how 18
lucky 18
i 18
am 18
my 18
eyes 18
were 18
spared 18
most 18
of 18
my 18
face 18
was 18
spared 18
my 18
lungs 18
are 18
responding 18
to 18
treatment 18
i 18
will 18
be 18
as 18
good 18
as 18
new 18
when 18
my 18
tender 18
skin 18
has 18
toughened 18
enough 18
to 18
withstand 18
the 18
pressure 18
of 18
sheets 18
more 18
visitors 18
arrive 18
the 18
morphling 18
opens 18
the 18
door 18
to 18
the 18
dead 18
and 18
alive 18
alike 18
haymitch 18
yellow 18
and 18
unsmiling 18
cinna 18
stitching 18
a 18
new 18
wedding 18
dress 18
delly 18
prattling 18
on 18
about 18
the 18
niceness 18
of 18
people 18
my 18
father 18
sings 18
all 18
four 18
stanzas 18
of 18
the 18
hanging 18
tree 18
and 18
reminds 18
me 18
that 18
my 18
motherwho 18
sleeps 18
in 18
a 18
chair 18
between 18
shiftsisnt 18
to 18
know 18
about 18
it 18
one 18
day 18
i 18
awake 18
to 18
expectations 18
and 18
know 18
i 18
will 18
not 18
be 18
allowed 18
to 18
live 18
in 18
my 18
dreamland 18
i 18
must 18
take 18
food 18
by 18
mouth 18
move 18
my 18
own 18
muscles 18
make 18
my 18
way 18
to 18
the 18
bathroom 18
a 18
brief 18
appearance 18
by 18
president 18
coin 18
clinches 18
it 18
dont 18
worry 18
she 18
says 18
ive 18
saved 18
him 18
for 18
you 18
the 18
doctors 18
puzzlement 18
grows 18
over 18
why 18
im 18
unable 18
to 18
speak 18
many 18
tests 18
are 18
done 18
and 18
while 18
theres 18
damage 18
to 18
my 18
vocal 18
cords 18
it 18
doesnt 18
account 18
for 18
it 18
finally 18
dr 18
aurelius 18
a 18
head 18
doctor 18
comes 18
up 18
with 18
the 18
theory 18
that 18
ive 18
become 18
a 18
mental 18
rather 18
than 18
physical 18
avox 18
that 18
my 18
silence 18
has 18
been 18
brought 18
on 18
by 18
emotional 18
trauma 18
although 18
hes 18
presented 18
with 18
a 18
hundred 18
proposed 18
remedies 18
he 18
tells 18
them 18
to 18
leave 18
me 18
alone 18
so 18
i 18
dont 18
ask 18
about 18
anyone 18
or 18
anything 18
but 18
people 18
bring 18
me 18
a 18
steady 18
stream 18
of 18
information 18
on 18
the 18
war 18
the 18
capitol 18
fell 18
the 18

pale 18
im 18
like 18
a 18
bizarre 18
patchwork 18
quilt 18
of 18
skin 18
parts 18
of 18
my 18
hair 18
were 18
singed 18
off 18
completely 18
the 18
rest 18
has 18
been 18
chopped 18
off 18
at 18
odd 18
lengths 18
katniss 18
everdeen 18
the 18
girl 18
who 18
was 18
on 18
fire 18
i 18
wouldnt 18
much 18
care 18
except 18
the 18
sight 18
of 18
my 18
body 18
brings 18
back 18
the 18
memory 18
of 18
the 18
pain 18
and 18
why 18
i 18
was 18
in 18
pain 18
and 18
what 18
happened 18
just 18
before 18
the 18
pain 18
started 18
and 18
how 18
i 18
watched 18
my 18
little 18
sister 18
become 18
a 18
human 18
torch 18
closing 18
my 18
eyes 18
doesnt 18
help 18
fire 18
burns 18
brighter 18
in 18
the 18
darkness 18
dr 18
aurelius 18
shows 18
up 18
sometimes 18
i 18
like 18
him 18
because 18
he 18
doesnt 18
say 18
stupid 18
things 18
like 18
how 18
im 18
totally 18
safe 18
or 18
that 18
he 18
knows 18
i 18
cant 18
see 18
it 18
but 18
ill 18
be 18
happy 18
again 18
one 18
day 18
or 18
even 18
that 18
things 18
will 18
be 18
better 18
in 18
panem 18
now 18
he 18
just 18
asks 18
if 18
i 18
feel 18
like 18
talking 18
and 18
when 18
i 18
dont 18
answer 18
he 18
falls 18
asleep 18
in 18
his 18
chair 18
in 18
fact 18
i 18
think 18
his 18
visits 18
are 18
largely 18
motivated 18
by 18
his 18
need 18
for 18
a 18
nap 18
the 18
arrangement 18
works 18
for 18
both 18
of 18
us 18
the 18
time 18
draws 18
near 18
although 18
i 18
could 18
not 18
give 18
you 18
exact 18
hours 18
and 18
minutes 18
president 18
snow 18
has 18
been 18
tried 18
and 18
found 18
guilty 18
sentenced 18
to 18
execution 18
haymitch 18
tells 18
me 18
i 18
hear 18
talk 18
of 18
it 18
as 18
i 18
drift 18
past 18
the 18
guards 18
in 18
the 18
hallways 18
my 18
mockingjay 18
suit 18
arrives 18
in 18
my 18
room 18
also 18
my 18
bow 18
looking 18
no 18
worse 18
for 18
wear 18
but 18
no 18
sheath 18
of 18
arrows 18
either 18
because 18
they 18
were 18
damaged 18
or 18
more 18
likely 18
because 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
have 18
weapons 18
i 18
vaguely 18
wonder 18
if 18
i 18
should 18
be 18
preparing 18
for 18
the 18
event 18
in 18
some 18
way 18
but 18
nothing 18
comes 18
to 18
mind 18
late 18
one 18
afternoon 18
after 18
a 18
long 18
period 18
in 18
a 18
cushioned 18
window 18
seat 18
behind 18
a 18
painted 18
screen 18
i 18
emerge 18
and 18
turn 18
left 18
instead 18
of 18
right 18
i 18
find 18
myself 18
in 18
a 18
strange 18
part 18
of 18
the 18
mansion 18
and 18
immediately 18
lose 18
my 18
bearings 18
unlike 18
the 18
area 18
where 18
im 18
quartered 18
there 18
seems 18
to 18
be 18
no 18
one 18
around 18
to 18
ask 18
i 18
like 18
it 18
though 18
wish 18
id 18
found 18
it 18
sooner 18
its 18
so 18
quiet 18
with 18
the 18
thick 18
carpets 18
and 18
heavy 18
tapestries 18
soaking 18
up 18
the 18
sound 18
softly 18
lit 18
muted 18
colors 18
peaceful 18
until 18
i 18
smell 18
the 18
roses 18
i 18
dive 18
behind 18
some 18
curtains 18
shaking 18
too 18
hard 18
to 18
run 18
while 18
i 18
await 18
the 18
mutts 18
finally 18
i 18
realize 18
there 18
are 18
no 18
mutts 18
coming 18
so 18
what 18
do 18
i 18
smell 18
real 18
roses 18
could 18
it 18
be 18
that 18
i 18
am 18
near 18
the 18
garden 18
where 18
the 18
evil 18
things 18
grow 18
as 18
i 18
creep 18
down 18
the 18
hall 18
the 18
odor 18
becomes 18
overpowering 18
perhaps 18
not 18
as 18
strong 18
as 18
the 18
actual 18
mutts 18
but 18
purer 18
because 18
its 18
not 18
competing 18
with 18
sewage 18
and 18
explosives 18
i 18
turn 18
a 18
corner 18
and 18
find 18
myself 18
staring 18
at 18
two 18
surprised 18
guards 18
not 18
peacekeepers 18
of 18
course 18
there 18
are 18
no 18
more 18
peacekeepers 18
but 18
not 18
the 18
trim 18
grayuniformed 18
soldiers 18
from 18
either 18
these 18
two 18
a 18
man 18
and 18
a 18
woman 18
wear 18
the 18
tattered 18
throwntogether 18
clothes 18
of 18
actual 18
rebels 18
still 18
bandaged 18
and 18
gaunt 18
they 18
are 18
now 18
keeping 18
watch 18
over 18
the 18
doorway 18
to 18
the 18
roses 18
when 18
i 18
move 18
to 18
enter 18
their 18
guns 18
form 18
an 18
x 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
me 18
you 18
cant 18
go 18
in 18
miss 18
says 18
the 18
man 18
soldier 18
the 18
woman 18
corrects 18
him 18
you 18
cant 18
go 18
in 18
soldier 18
everdeen 18
presidents 18
orders 18
i 18
just 18
stand 18
there 18
patiently 18
waiting 18
for 18
them 18
to 18
lower 18
their 18
guns 18
for 18
them 18
to 18
understand 18
without 18
my 18
telling 18
them 18
that 18
behind 18
those 18
doors 18
is 18
something 18
i 18
need 18
just 18
a 18
rose 18
a 18
single 18
bloom 18
to 18
place 18
in 18
snows 18
lapel 18
before 18
i 18
shoot 18
him 18
my 18
presence 18
seems 18
to 18
worry 18
the 18
guards 18
theyre 18
discussing 18
calling 18
haymitch 18
when 18
a 18
woman 18
speaks 18
up 18
behind 18
me 18
let 18
her 18
go 18
in 18
i 18
know 18
the 18
voice 18
but 18
cant 18
immediately 18
place 18
it 18
not 18
seam 18
not 18
definitely 18
not 18
capitol 18
i 18
turn 18
my 18
head 18
and 18
find 18
myself 18
facetoface 18
with 18
paylor 18
the 18
commander 18
from 18
she 18
looks 18
even 18
more 18
beat 18
up 18
than 18
she 18
did 18
at 18
the 18
hospital 18
but 18
who 18
doesnt 18
on 18
my 18
authority 18
says 18
paylor 18
she 18
has 18
a 18
right 18
to 18
anything 18
behind 18
that 18
door 18
these 18
are 18
her 18
soldiers 18
not 18
coins 18
they 18
drop 18
their 18
weapons 18
without 18
question 18
and 18
let 18
me 18
pass 18
at 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
a 18
short 18
hallway 18
i 18
push 18
apart 18
the 18
glass 18
doors 18
and 18
step 18
inside 18
by 18
now 18
the 18
smells 18
so 18
strong 18
that 18
it 18
begins 18
to 18
flatten 18
out 18
as 18
if 18
theres 18
no 18
more 18
my 18
nose 18
can 18
absorb 18
the 18
damp 18
mild 18
air 18
feels 18
good 18
on 18
my 18
hot 18
skin 18
and 18
the 18
roses 18
are 18
glorious 18
row 18
after 18
row 18
of 18
sumptuous 18
blooms 18
in 18
lush 18
pink 18
sunset 18
orange 18
and 18
even 18
pale 18
blue 18
i 18
wander 18
through 18
the 18
aisles 18
of 18
carefully 18
pruned 18
plants 18
looking 18
but 18
not 18
touching 18
because 18
i 18
have 18
learned 18
the 18
hard 18
way 18
how 18
deadly 18
these 18
beauties 18
can 18
be 18
i 18
know 18
when 18
i 18
find 18
it 18
crowning 18
the 18
top 18
of 18
a 18
slender 18
bush 18
a 18
magnificent 18
white 18
bud 18
just 18
beginning 18
to 18
open 18
i 18
pull 18
my 18
left 18
sleeve 18
over 18
my 18
hand 18
so 18
that 18
my 18
skin 18
wont 18
actually 18
have 18
to 18
touch 18
it 18
take 18
up 18
a 18
pair 18
of 18
pruning 18
shears 18
and 18
have 18
just 18
positioned 18
them 18
on 18
the 18
stem 18
when 18
he 18
speaks 18
thats 18
a 18
nice 18
one 18
my 18
hand 18
jerks 18
the 18
shears 18
snap 18
shut 18
severing 18
the 18
stem 18
the 18
colors 18
are 18
lovely 18
of 18
course 18
but 18
nothing 18
says 18
perfection 18
like 18
white 18
i 18
still 18
cant 18
see 18
him 18
but 18
his 18
voice 18
seems 18
to 18
rise 18
up 18
from 18
an 18
adjacent 18
bed 18
of 18
red 18
roses 18
delicately 18
pinching 18
the 18
stem 18
of 18
the 18
bud 18
through 18
the 18
fabric 18
of 18
my 18
sleeve 18
i 18
move 18
slowly 18
around 18
the 18
corner 18
and 18
find 18
him 18
sitting 18
on 18
a 18
stool 18
against 18
the 18
wall 18
hes 18
as 18
well 18
groomed 18
and 18
finely 18
dressed 18
as 18
ever 18
but 18
weighted 18
down 18
with 18
manacles 18
ankle 18
shackles 18
tracking 18
devices 18
in 18
the 18
bright 18
light 18
his 18
skins 18
a 18
pale 18
sickly 18
green 18
he 18
holds 18
a 18
white 18
handkerchief 18
spotted 18
with 18
fresh 18
blood 18
even 18
in 18
his 18
deteriorated 18
state 18
his 18
snake 18
eyes 18
shine 18
bright 18
and 18
cold 18
i 18
was 18
hoping 18
youd 18
find 18
your 18
way 18
to 18
my 18
quarters 18
his 18
quarters 18
i 18
have 18
trespassed 18
into 18
his 18
home 18
the 18
way 18
he 18
slithered 18
into 18
mine 18
last 18
year 18
hissing 18
threats 18
with 18
his 18
bloody 18
rosy 18
breath 18
this 18
greenhouse 18
is 18
one 18
of 18
his 18
rooms 18
perhaps 18
his 18
favorite 18
perhaps 18
in 18
better 18
times 18
he 18
tended 18
the 18
plants 18
himself 18
but 18
now 18
its 18
part 18
of 18
his 18
prison 18
thats 18
why 18
the 18
guards 18
halted 18
me 18
and 18
thats 18
why 18
paylor 18
let 18
me 18
in 18
id 18
supposed 18
he 18
would 18
be 18
secured 18
in 18
the 18
deepest 18
dungeon 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
had 18
to 18
offer 18
not 18
cradled 18
in 18
the 18
lap 18
of 18
luxury 18
yet 18
coin 18
left 18
him 18
here 18
to 18
set 18
a 18
precedent 18
i 18
guess 18
so 18
that 18
if 18
in 18
the 18
future 18
she 18
ever 18
fell 18
from 18
grace 18
it 18
would 18
be 18
understood 18
that 18
presidentseven 18
the 18
most 18
despicableget 18
special 18
treatment 18
who 18
knows 18
after 18
all 18
when 18
her 18
own 18
power 18
might 18
fade 18
there 18
are 18
so 18
many 18
things 18
we 18
should 18
discuss 18
but 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
feeling 18
your 18
visit 18
will 18
be 18
brief 18
so 18
first 18
things 18
first 18
he 18
begins 18
to 18
cough 18
and 18
when 18
he 18
removes 18
the 18
handkerchief 18
from 18
his 18
mouth 18
its 18
redder 18
i 18
wanted 18
to 18
tell 18
you 18
how 18
very 18
sorry 18
i 18
am 18
about 18
your 18
sister 18
even 18
in 18
my 18
deadened 18
drugged 18
condition 18
this 18
sends 18
a 18
stab 18
of 18
pain 18
through 18
me 18
reminding 18
me 18
that 18
there 18
are 18
no 18
limits 18
to 18
his 18
cruelty 18
and 18
how 18
he 18
will 18
go 18
to 18
his 18
grave 18
trying 18
to 18
destroy 18
me 18
so 18
wasteful 18
so 18
unnecessary 18
anyone 18
could 18
see 18
the 18
game 18
was 18
over 18
by 18
that 18
point 18
in 18
fact 18
i 18
was 18
just 18
about 18
to 18
issue 18
an 18
official 18
surrender 18
when 18
they 18
released 18
those 18
parachutes 18
his 18
eyes 18
are 18
glued 18
on 18
me 18
unblinking 18
so 18
as 18
not 18
to 18
miss 18
a 18
second 18
of 18
my 18
reaction 18
but 18
what 18
hes 18
said 18
makes 18
no 18
sense 18
when 18
they 18
released 18
the 18
parachutes 18
well 18
you 18
really 18
didnt 18
think 18
i 18
gave 18
the 18
order 18
did 18
you 18
forget 18
the 18
obvious 18
fact 18
that 18
if 18
id 18
had 18
a 18
working 18
hovercraft 18
at 18
my 18
disposal 18
id 18
have 18
been 18
using 18
it 18
to 18
make 18
an 18
escape 18
but 18
that 18
aside 18
what 18
purpose 18
could 18
it 18
have 18
served 18
we 18
both 18
know 18
im 18
not 18
above 18
killing 18
children 18
but 18
im 18
not 18
wasteful 18
i 18
take 18
life 18
for 18
very 18
specific 18
reasons 18
and 18
there 18
was 18
no 18
reason 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
destroy 18
a 18
pen 18
full 18
of 18
capitol 18
children 18
none 18
at 18
all 18
i 18
wonder 18
if 18
the 18
next 18
fit 18
of 18
coughing 18
is 18
staged 18
so 18
that 18
i 18
can 18
have 18
time 18
to 18
absorb 18
his 18
words 18
hes 18
lying 18
of 18
course 18
hes 18
lying 18
but 18
theres 18
something 18
struggling 18
to 18
free 18
itself 18
from 18
the 18
lie 18
as 18
well 18
however 18
i 18
must 18
concede 18
it 18
was 18
a 18
masterful 18
move 18
on 18
coins 18
part 18
the 18
idea 18
that 18
i 18
was 18
bombing 18
our 18
own 18
helpless 18
children 18
instantly 18
snapped 18
whatever 18
frail 18
allegiance 18
my 18
people 18
still 18
felt 18
to 18
me 18
there 18
was 18
no 18
real 18
resistance 18
after 18
that 18
did 18
you 18
know 18
it 18
aired 18
live 18
you 18
can 18
see 18
plutarchs 18
hand 18
there 18
and 18
in 18
the 18
parachutes 18
well 18
its 18
that 18
sort 18
of 18
thinking 18
that 18
you 18
look 18
for 18
in 18
a 18
head 18
gamemaker 18
isnt 18
it 18
snow 18
dabs 18
the 18
corners 18
of 18
his 18
mouth 18
im 18
sure 18
he 18
wasnt 18
gunning 18
for 18
your 18
sister 18
but 18
these 18
things 18
happen 18
im 18
not 18
with 18
snow 18
now 18
im 18
in 18
special 18
weaponry 18
back 18
in 18
with 18
gale 18
and 18
beetee 18
looking 18
at 18
the 18
designs 18
based 18
on 18
gales 18
traps 18
that 18
played 18
on 18
human 18
sympathies 18
the 18
first 18
bomb 18
killed 18
the 18
victims 18
the 18
second 18
the 18
rescuers 18
remembering 18
gales 18
words 18
beetee 18
and 18
i 18
have 18
been 18
following 18
the 18
same 18
rule 18
book 18
president 18
snow 18
used 18
when 18
he 18
hijacked 18
peeta 18
my 18
failure 18
says 18
snow 18
was 18
being 18
so 18
slow 18
to 18
grasp 18
coins 18
plan 18
to 18
let 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
districts 18
destroy 18
one 18
another 18
and 18
then 18
step 18
in 18
to 18
take 18
power 18
with 18
thirteen 18
barely 18
scratched 18
make 18
no 18
mistake 18
she 18
was 18
intending 18
to 18
take 18
my 18
place 18
right 18
from 18
the 18
beginning 18
i 18
shouldnt 18
be 18
surprised 18
after 18
all 18
it 18
was 18
thirteen 18
that 18
started 18
the 18
rebellion 18
that 18
led 18
to 18
the 18
dark 18
days 18
and 18
then 18
abandoned 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18
districts 18
when 18
the 18
tide 18
turned 18
against 18
it 18
but 18
i 18
wasnt 18
watching 18
coin 18
i 18
was 18
watching 18
you 18
mockingjay 18
and 18
you 18
were 18
watching 18
me 18
im 18
afraid 18
we 18
have 18
both 18
been 18
played 18
for 18
fools 18
i 18
refuse 18
for 18
this 18
to 18
be 18
true 18
some 18
things 18
even 18
i 18
cant 18
survive 18
i 18
utter 18
my 18
first 18
words 18
since 18
my 18
sisters 18
death 18
i 18
dont 18
believe 18
you 18
snow 18
shakes 18
his 18
head 18
in 18
mock 18
disappointment 18
oh 18
my 18
dear 18
miss 18
everdeen 18
i 18
thought 18
we 18
had 18
agreed 18
not 18
to 18
lie 18
to 18
each 18
other 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
hall 18
i 18
find 18
paylor 18
standing 18
in 18
exactly 18
the 18
same 18
spot 18
did 18
you 18
find 18
what 18
you 18
were 18
looking 18
for 18
she 18
asks 18
i 18
hold 18
up 18
the 18
white 18
bud 18
in 18
answer 18
and 18
then 18
stumble 18
past 18
her 18
i 18
must 18
have 18
made 18
it 18
back 18
to 18
my 18
room 18
because 18
the 18
next 18
thing 18
i 18
know 18
im 18
filling 18
a 18
glass 18
with 18
water 18
from 18
the 18
bathroom 18
faucet 18
and 18
sticking 18
the 18
rose 18
in 18
it 18
i 18
sink 18
to 18
my 18
knees 18
on 18
the 18
cold 18
tile 18
and 18
squint 18
at 18
the 18
flower 18
as 18
the 18
whiteness 18
seems 18
hard 18
to 18
focus 18
on 18
in 18
the 18
stark 18
fluorescent 18
light 18
my 18
finger 18
catches 18
the 18
inside 18
of 18
my 18
bracelet 18
twisting 18
it 18
like 18
a 18
tourniquet 18
hurting 18
my 18
wrist 18
im 18
hoping 18
the 18
pain 18
will 18
help 18
me 18
hang 18
on 18
to 18
reality 18
the 18
way 18
it 18
did 18
for 18
peeta 18
i 18
must 18
hang 18
on 18
i 18
must 18
know 18
the 18
truth 18
about 18
what 18
has 18
happened 18
there 18
are 18
two 18
possibilities 18
although 18
the 18
details 18
associated 18
with 18
them 18
may 18
vary 18
first 18
as 18
ive 18
believed 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
sent 18
in 18
that 18
hovercraft 18
dropped 18
the 18
parachutes 18
and 18
sacrificed 18
its 18
childrens 18
lives 18
knowing 18
the 18
recently 18
arrived 18
rebels 18
would 18
go 18
to 18
their 18
aid 18
theres 18
evidence 18
to 18
support 18
this 18
the 18
capitols 18
seal 18
on 18
the 18
hovercraft 18
the 18
lack 18
of 18
any 18
attempt 18
to 18
blow 18
the 18
enemy 18
out 18
of 18
the 18
sky 18
and 18
their 18
long 18
history 18
of 18
using 18
children 18
as 18
pawns 18
in 18
their 18
battle 18
against 18
the 18
districts 18
then 18
theres 18
snows 18
account 18
that 18
a 18
capitol 18
hovercraft 18
manned 18
by 18
rebels 18
bombed 18
the 18
children 18
to 18
bring 18
a 18
speedy 18
end 18
to 18
the 18
war 18
but 18
if 18
this 18
was 18
the 18
case 18
why 18
didnt 18
the 18
capitol 18
fire 18
on 18
the 18
enemy 18
did 18
the 18
element 18
of 18
surprise 18
throw 18
them 18
had 18
they 18
no 18
defenses 18
left 18
children 18
are 18
precious 18
to 18
or 18
so 18
it 18
has 18
always 18
seemed 18
well 18
not 18
me 18
maybe 18
once 18
i 18
had 18
outlived 18
my 18
usefulness 18
i 18
was 18
expendable 18
although 18
i 18
think 18
its 18
been 18
a 18
long 18
time 18
since 18
ive 18
been 18
considered 18
a 18
child 18
in 18
this 18
war 18
and 18
why 18
would 18
they 18
do 18
it 18
knowing 18
their 18
own 18
medics 18
would 18
likely 18
respond 18
and 18
be 18
taken 18
out 18
by 18
the 18
second 18
blast 18
they 18
wouldnt 18
they 18
couldnt 18
snows 18
lying 18
manipulating 18
me 18
as 18
he 18
always 18
has 18
hoping 18
to 18
turn 18
me 18
against 18
the 18
rebels 18
and 18
possibly 18
destroy 18
them 18
yes 18
of 18
course 18
then 18
whats 18
nagging 18
at 18
me 18
those 18
doubleexploding 18
bombs 18
for 18
one 18
its 18
not 18
that 18
the 18
capitol 18
couldnt 18
have 18
the 18
same 18
weapon 18
its 18
just 18
that 18
im 18
sure 18
the 18
rebels 18
did 18
gale 18
and 18
beetees 18
brainchild 18
then 18
theres 18
the 18
fact 18
that 18
snow 18
made 18
no 18
escape 18
attempt 18
when 18
i 18
know 18
him 18
to 18
be 18
the 18
consummate 18
survivor 18
it 18
seems 18
hard 18
to 18
believe 18
he 18
didnt 18
have 18
a 18
retreat 18
somewhere 18
some 18
bunker 18
stocked 18
with 18
provisions 18
where 18
he 18
could 18
live 18
out 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
his 18
snaky 18
little 18
life 18
and 18
finally 18
theres 18
his 18
assessment 18
of 18
coin 18
whats 18
irrefutable 18
is 18
that 18
shes 18
done 18
exactly 18
what 18
he 18
said 18
let 18
the 18
capitol 18
and 18
the 18
districts 18
run 18
one 18
another 18
into 18
the 18
ground 18
and 18
then 18
sauntered 18
in 18
to 18
take 18
power 18
even 18
if 18
that 18
was 18
her 18
plan 18
it 18
doesnt 18
mean 18
she 18
dropped 18
those 18
parachutes 18
victory 18
was 18
already 18
in 18
her 18
grasp 18
everything 18
was 18
in 18
her 18
grasp 18
except 18
me 18
i 18
recall 18
boggss 18
response 18
when 18
i 18
admitted 18
i 18
hadnt 18
put 18
much 18
thought 18
into 18
snows 18
successor 18
if 18
your 18
immediate 18
answer 18
isnt 18
coin 18
then 18
youre 18
a 18
threat 18
youre 18
the 18
face 18
of 18
the 18
rebellion 18
you 18
may 18
have 18
more 18
influence 18
than 18
any 18
other 18
single 18
person 18
outwardly 18
the 18
most 18
youve 18
ever 18
done 18
is 18
tolerated 18
her 18
suddenly 18
im 18
thinking 18
of 18
prim 18
who 18
was 18
not 18
yet 18
fourteen 18
not 18
yet 18
old 18
enough 18
to 18
be 18
granted 18
the 18
title 18
of 18
soldier 18
but 18
somehow 18
working 18
on 18
the 18
front 18
lines 18
how 18
did 18
such 18
a 18
thing 18
happen 18
that 18
my 18
sister 18
would 18
have 18
wanted 18
to 18
be 18
there 18
i 18
have 18
no 18
doubt 18
that 18
she 18
would 18
be 18
more 18
capable 18
than 18
many 18
older 18
than 18
she 18
is 18
a 18
given 18
but 18
for 18
all 18
that 18
someone 18
very 18
high 18
up 18
would 18
have 18
had 18
to 18
approve 18
putting 18
a 18
thirteenyearold 18
in 18
combat 18
did 18
coin 18
do 18
it 18
hoping 18
that 18
losing 18
prim 18
would 18
push 18
me 18
completely 18
over 18
the 18
edge 18
or 18
at 18
least 18
firmly 18
on 18
her 18
side 18
i 18
wouldnt 18
even 18
have 18
had 18
to 18
witness 18
it 18
in 18
person 18
numerous 18
cameras 18
would 18
be 18
covering 18
the 18
city 18
circle 18
capturing 18
the 18
moment 18
forever 18
no 18
now 18
i 18
am 18
going 18
crazy 18
slipping 18
into 18
some 18
state 18
of 18
paranoia 18
too 18
many 18
people 18
would 18
know 18
of 18
the 18
mission 18
word 18
would 18
get 18
out 18
or 18
would 18
it 18
who 18
would 18
have 18
to 18
know 18
besides 18
coin 18
plutarch 18
and 18
a 18
small 18
loyal 18
or 18
easily 18
disposable 18
crew 18
i 18
badly 18
need 18
help 18
working 18
this 18
out 18
only 18
everyone 18

dead 18
cinna 18
boggs 18
finnick 18
prim 18
theres 18
peeta 18
but 18
he 18
couldnt 18
do 18
any 18
more 18
than 18
speculate 18
and 18
who 18
knows 18
what 18
state 18
his 18
minds 18
in 18
anyway 18
and 18
that 18
leaves 18
only 18
gale 18
hes 18
far 18
away 18
but 18
even 18
if 18
he 18
were 18
beside 18
me 18
could 18
i 18
confide 18
in 18
him 18
what 18
could 18
i 18
say 18
how 18
could 18
i 18
phrase 18
it 18
without 18
implying 18
that 18
it 18
was 18
his 18
bomb 18
that 18
killed 18
prim 18
the 18
impossibility 18
of 18
that 18
idea 18
more 18
than 18
any 18
is 18
why 18
snow 18
must 18
be 18
lying 18
ultimately 18
theres 18
only 18
one 18
person 18
to 18
turn 18
to 18
who 18
might 18
know 18
what 18
happened 18
and 18
might 18
still 18
be 18
on 18
my 18
side 18
to 18
broach 18
the 18
subject 18
at 18
all 18
will 18
be 18
a 18
risk 18
but 18
while 18
i 18
think 18
haymitch 18
might 18
gamble 18
with 18
my 18
life 18
in 18
the 18
arena 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
hed 18
rat 18
me 18
out 18
to 18
coin 18
whatever 18
problems 18
we 18
may 18
have 18
with 18
each 18
other 18
we 18
prefer 18
resolving 18
our 18
differences 18
oneonone 18
i 18
scramble 18
off 18
the 18
tiles 18
out 18
the 18
door 18
and 18
across 18
the 18
hall 18
to 18
his 18
room 18
when 18
theres 18
no 18
response 18
to 18
my 18
knock 18
i 18
push 18
inside 18
ugh 18
its 18
amazing 18
how 18
quickly 18
he 18
can 18
defile 18
a 18
space 18
halfeaten 18
plates 18
of 18
food 18
shattered 18
liquor 18
bottles 18
and 18
pieces 18
of 18
broken 18
furniture 18
from 18
a 18
drunken 18
rampage 18
scatter 18
his 18
quarters 18
he 18
lies 18
unkempt 18
and 18
unwashed 18
in 18
a 18
tangle 18
of 18
sheets 18
on 18
the 18
bed 18
passed 18
out 18
haymitch 18
i 18
say 18
shaking 18
his 18
leg 18
of 18
course 18
thats 18
insufficient 18
but 18
i 18
give 18
it 18
a 18
few 18
more 18
tries 18
before 18
i 18
dump 18
the 18
pitcher 18
of 18
water 18
in 18
his 18
face 18
he 18
comes 18
to 18
with 18
a 18
gasp 18
slashing 18
blindly 18
with 18
his 18
knife 18
apparently 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
snows 18
reign 18
didnt 18
equal 18
the 18
end 18
of 18
his 18
terror 18
oh 18
you 18
he 18
says 18
i 18
can 18
tell 18
by 18
his 18
voice 18
that 18
hes 18
still 18
loaded 18
haymitch 18
i 18
begin 18
listen 18
to 18
that 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
found 18
her 18
voice 18
he 18
laughs 18
well 18
plutarchs 18
going 18
to 18
be 18
happy 18
he 18
takes 18
a 18
swig 18
from 18
a 18
bottle 18
why 18
am 18
i 18
soaking 18
wet 18
i 18
lamely 18
drop 18
the 18
pitcher 18
behind 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
pile 18
of 18
dirty 18
clothes 18
i 18
need 18
your 18
help 18
i 18
say 18
haymitch 18
belches 18
filling 18
the 18
air 18
with 18
white 18
liquor 18
fumes 18
what 18
is 18
it 18
sweetheart 18
more 18
boy 18
trouble 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
why 18
but 18
this 18
hurts 18
me 18
in 18
a 18
way 18
haymitch 18
rarely 18
can 18
it 18
must 18
show 18
on 18
my 18
face 18
because 18
even 18
in 18
his 18
drunken 18
state 18
he 18
tries 18
to 18
take 18
it 18
back 18
okay 18
not 18
funny 18
im 18
already 18
at 18
the 18
door 18
not 18
funny 18
come 18
back 18
by 18
the 18
thud 18
of 18
his 18
body 18
hitting 18
the 18
floor 18
i 18
assume 18
he 18
tried 18
to 18
follow 18
me 18
but 18
theres 18
no 18
point 18
i 18
zigzag 18
through 18
the 18
mansion 18
and 18
disappear 18
into 18
a 18
wardrobe 18
full 18
of 18
silken 18
things 18
i 18
yank 18
them 18
from 18
hangers 18
until 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
pile 18
and 18
then 18
burrow 18
into 18
it 18
in 18
the 18
lining 18
of 18
my 18
pocket 18
i 18
find 18
a 18
stray 18
morphling 18
tablet 18
and 18
swallow 18
it 18
dry 18
heading 18
off 18
my 18
rising 18
hysteria 18
its 18
not 18
enough 18
to 18
right 18
things 18
though 18
i 18
hear 18
haymitch 18
calling 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
distance 18
but 18
he 18
wont 18
find 18
me 18
in 18
his 18
condition 18
especially 18
not 18
in 18
this 18
new 18
spot 18
swathed 18
in 18
silk 18
i 18
feel 18
like 18
a 18
caterpillar 18
in 18
a 18
cocoon 18
awaiting 18
metamorphosis 18
i 18
always 18
supposed 18
that 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
peaceful 18
condition 18
at 18
first 18
it 18
is 18
but 18
as 18
i 18
journey 18
into 18
night 18
i 18
feel 18
more 18
and 18
more 18
trapped 18
suffocated 18
by 18
the 18
slippery 18
bindings 18
unable 18
to 18
emerge 18
until 18
i 18
have 18
transformed 18
into 18
something 18
of 18
beauty 18
i 18
squirm 18
trying 18
to 18
shed 18
my 18
ruined 18
body 18
and 18
unlock 18
the 18
secret 18
to 18
growing 18
flawless 18
wings 18
despite 18
enormous 18
effort 18
i 18
remain 18
a 18
hideous 18
creature 18
fired 18
into 18
my 18
current 18
form 18
by 18
the 18
blast 18
from 18
the 18
bombs 18
the 18
encounter 18
with 18
snow 18
opens 18
the 18
door 18
to 18
my 18
old 18
repertoire 18
of 18
nightmares 18
its 18
like 18
being 18
stung 18
by 18
tracker 18
jackers 18
again 18
a 18
wave 18
of 18
horrifying 18
images 18
with 18
a 18
brief 18
respite 18
i 18
confuse 18
with 18
wakingonly 18
to 18
find 18
another 18
wave 18
knocking 18
me 18
back 18
when 18
the 18
guards 18
finally 18
locate 18
me 18
im 18
sitting 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
of 18
the 18
wardrobe 18
tangled 18
in 18
silk 18
screaming 18
my 18
head 18
off 18
i 18
fight 18
them 18
at 18
first 18
until 18
they 18
convince 18
me 18
theyre 18
trying 18
to 18
help 18
peel 18
away 18
the 18
choking 18
garments 18
and 18
escort 18
me 18
back 18
to 18
my 18
room 18
on 18
the 18
way 18
we 18
pass 18
a 18
window 18
and 18
i 18
see 18
a 18
gray 18
snowy 18
dawn 18
spreading 18
across 18
the 18
capitol 18
a 18
very 18
hungover 18
haymitch 18
waits 18
with 18
a 18
handful 18
of 18
pills 18
and 18
a 18
tray 18
of 18
food 18
that 18
neither 18
of 18
us 18
has 18
the 18
stomach 18
for 18
he 18
makes 18
a 18
feeble 18
attempt 18
to 18
get 18
me 18
to 18
talk 18
again 18
but 18
seeing 18
its 18
pointless 18
sends 18
me 18
to 18
a 18
bath 18
someone 18
has 18
drawn 18
the 18
tubs 18
deep 18
with 18
three 18
steps 18
to 18
the 18
bottom 18
i 18
ease 18
down 18
into 18
the 18
warm 18
water 18
and 18
sit 18
up 18
to 18
my 18
neck 18
in 18
suds 18
hoping 18
the 18
medicines 18
kick 18
in 18
soon 18
my 18
eyes 18
focus 18
on 18
the 18
rose 18
that 18
has 18
spread 18
its 18
petals 18
overnight 18
filling 18
the 18
steamy 18
air 18
with 18
its 18
strong 18
perfume 18
i 18
rise 18
and 18
reach 18
for 18
a 18
towel 18
to 18
smother 18
it 18
when 18
theres 18
a 18
tentative 18
knock 18
and 18
the 18
bathroom 18
door 18
opens 18
revealing 18
three 18
familiar 18
faces 18
they 18
try 18
to 18
smile 18
at 18
me 18
but 18
even 18
venia 18
cant 18
conceal 18
her 18
shock 18
at 18
my 18
ravaged 18
mutt 18
body 18
surprise 18
octavia 18
squeaks 18
and 18
then 18
bursts 18
into 18
tears 18
im 18
puzzling 18
over 18
their 18
reappearance 18
when 18
i 18
realize 18
that 18
this 18
must 18
be 18
it 18
the 18
day 18
of 18
the 18
execution 18
theyve 18
come 18
to 18
prep 18
me 18
for 18
the 18
cameras 18
remake 18
me 18
to 18
beauty 18
base 18
zero 18
no 18
wonder 18
octavias 18
crying 18
its 18
an 18
impossible 18
task 18
they 18
can 18
barely 18
touch 18
my 18
patchwork 18
of 18
skin 18
for 18
fear 18
of 18
hurting 18
me 18
so 18
i 18
rinse 18
and 18
dry 18
off 18
myself 18
i 18
tell 18
them 18
i 18
hardly 18
notice 18
the 18
pain 18
anymore 18
but 18
flavius 18
still 18
winces 18
as 18
he 18
drapes 18
a 18
robe 18
around 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
bedroom 18
i 18
find 18
another 18
surprise 18
sitting 18
upright 18
in 18
a 18
chair 18
polished 18
from 18
her 18
metallic 18
gold 18
wig 18
to 18
her 18
patent 18
leather 18
high 18
heels 18
gripping 18
a 18
clipboard 18
remarkably 18
unchanged 18
except 18
for 18
the 18
vacant 18
look 18
in 18
her 18
eyes 18
effie 18
i 18
say 18
hello 18
katniss 18
she 18
stands 18
and 18
kisses 18
me 18
on 18
the 18
cheek 18
as 18
if 18
nothing 18
has 18
occurred 18
since 18
our 18
last 18
meeting 18
the 18
night 18
before 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
well 18
it 18
looks 18
like 18
weve 18
got 18
another 18
big 18
big 18
big 18
day 18
ahead 18
of 18
us 18
so 18
why 18
dont 18
you 18
start 18
your 18
prep 18
and 18
ill 18
just 18
pop 18
over 18
and 18
check 18
on 18
the 18
arrangements 18
okay 18
i 18
say 18
to 18
her 18
back 18
they 18
say 18
plutarch 18
and 18
haymitch 18
had 18
a 18
hard 18
time 18
keeping 18
her 18
alive 18
comments 18
venia 18
under 18
her 18
breath 18
she 18
was 18
imprisoned 18
after 18
your 18
escape 18
so 18
that 18
helps 18
its 18
quite 18
a 18
stretch 18
effie 18
trinket 18
rebel 18
but 18
i 18
dont 18
want 18
coin 18
killing 18
her 18
so 18
i 18
make 18
a 18
mental 18
note 18
to 18
present 18
her 18
that 18
way 18
if 18
asked 18
i 18
guess 18
its 18
good 18
plutarch 18
kidnapped 18
you 18
three 18
after 18
all 18
were 18
the 18
only 18
prep 18
team 18
still 18
alive 18
and 18
all 18
the 18
stylists 18
from 18
the 18
quarter 18
quell 18
are 18
dead 18
says 18
venia 18
she 18
doesnt 18
say 18
who 18
specifically 18
killed 18
them 18
im 18
beginning 18
to 18
wonder 18
if 18
it 18
matters 18
she 18
gingerly 18
takes 18
one 18
of 18
my 18
scarred 18
hands 18
and 18
holds 18
it 18
out 18
for 18
inspection 18
now 18
what 18
do 18
you 18
think 18
for 18

beauty 18
miracle 18
on 18

managing 18
to 18
even 18
out 18

while 18
getting 18
some 18
of 18
the 18
longer 18
locks 18
to 18
hide 18
the 18
bald 18
spots 18
in 18
the 18
back 18
my 18
face 18
since 18
it 18
was 18
spared 18
from 18
the 18
flames 18
presents 18
no 18
more 18
than 18
the 18
usual 18
challenges 18
once 18
im 18
in 18
cinnas 18
mockingjay 18
suit 18
the 18
only 18
scars 18

my 18
mockingjay 18
pin 18
over 18
my 18
heart 18
and 18
we 18
step 18
back 18
to 18
look 18
in 18
the 18
mirror 18
i 18
cant 18
believe 18
how 18
normal 18
theyve 18
made 18
me 18
look 18
on 18
the 18
outside 18
when 18
inwardly 18
im 18
such 18
a 18
wasteland 18
theres 18
a 18
tap 18
at 18
the 18
door 18
and 18
gale 18
steps 18
in 18
can 18
i 18
have 18
a 18
minute 18
he 18
asks 18
in 18
the 18
mirror 18
i 18
watch 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
unsure 18
of 18
where 18
to 18
go 18
they 18
bump 18
into 18
one 18
another 18
a 18
few 18
times 18
and 18
then 18
closet 18
themselves 18
in 18
the 18
bathroom 18
gale 18
comes 18
up 18
behind 18
me 18
and 18
we 18
examine 18
each 18
others 18
reflection 18
im 18
searching 18
for 18
something 18
to 18
hang 18
on 18
to 18
some 18
sign 18
of 18
the 18
girl 18
and 18
boy 18
who 18
met 18
by 18
chance 18
in 18
the 18
woods 18
five 18
years 18
ago 18
and 18
became 18
inseparable 18
im 18
wondering 18
what 18
would 18
have 18
happened 18
to 18
them 18
if 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
had 18
not 18
reaped 18
the 18
girl 18
if 18
she 18
would 18
have 18
fallen 18
in 18
love 18
with 18
the 18
boy 18
married 18
him 18
even 18
and 18
sometime 18
in 18
the 18
future 18
when 18
the 18
brothers 18
and 18
sisters 18
had 18
been 18
raised 18
up 18
escaped 18
with 18
him 18
into 18
the 18
woods 18
and 18
left 18
behind 18
forever 18
would 18
they 18
have 18
been 18
happy 18
out 18
in 18
the 18
wild 18
or 18
would 18
the 18
dark 18
twisted 18
sadness 18
between 18
them 18
have 18
grown 18
up 18
even 18
without 18
the 18
capitols 18
help 18
i 18
brought 18
you 18
this 18
gale 18
holds 18
up 18
a 18
sheath 18
when 18
i 18
take 18
it 18
i 18
notice 18
it 18
holds 18
a 18
single 18
ordinary 18
arrow 18
its 18
supposed 18
to 18
be 18
symbolic 18
you 18
firing 18
the 18
last 18
shot 18
of 18
the 18
war 18
what 18
if 18
i 18
miss 18
i 18
say 18
does 18
coin 18
retrieve 18
it 18
and 18
bring 18
it 18
back 18
to 18
me 18
or 18
just 18
shoot 18
snow 18
through 18
the 18
head 18
herself 18
you 18
wont 18
miss 18
gale 18
adjusts 18
the 18
sheath 18
on 18
my 18
shoulder 18
we 18
stand 18
there 18
facetoface 18
not 18
meeting 18
each 18
others 18
eyes 18
you 18
didnt 18
come 18
see 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
he 18
doesnt 18
answer 18
so 18
finally 18
i 18
just 18
say 18
it 18
was 18
it 18
your 18
bomb 18
i 18
dont 18
know 18
neither 18
does 18
beetee 18
he 18
says 18
does 18
it 18
matter 18
youll 18
always 18
be 18
thinking 18
about 18
it 18
he 18
waits 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
deny 18
it 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
deny 18
it 18
but 18
its 18
true 18
even 18
now 18
i 18
can 18
see 18
the 18
flash 18
that 18
ignites 18
her 18
feel 18
the 18
heat 18
of 18
the 18
flames 18
and 18
i 18
will 18
never 18
be 18
able 18
to 18
separate 18
that 18
moment 18
from 18
gale 18
my 18
silence 18
is 18
my 18
answer 18
that 18
was 18
the 18
one 18
thing 18
i 18
had 18
going 18
for 18
me 18
taking 18
care 18
of 18
your 18
family 18
he 18
says 18
shoot 18
straight 18
okay 18
he 18
touches 18
my 18
cheek 18
and 18
leaves 18
i 18
want 18
to 18
call 18
him 18
back 18
and 18
tell 18
him 18
that 18
i 18
was 18
wrong 18
that 18
ill 18
figure 18
out 18
a 18
way 18
to 18
make 18
peace 18
with 18
this 18
to 18
remember 18
the 18
circumstances 18
under 18
which 18
he 18
created 18
the 18
bomb 18
take 18
into 18
account 18
my 18
own 18
inexcusable 18
crimes 18
dig 18
up 18
the 18
truth 18
about 18
who 18
dropped 18
the 18
parachutes 18
prove 18
it 18
wasnt 18
the 18
rebels 18
forgive 18
him 18
but 18
since 18
i 18
cant 18
ill 18
just 18
have 18
to 18
deal 18
with 18
the 18
pain 18
effie 18
comes 18
in 18
to 18
usher 18
me 18
to 18
some 18
kind 18
of 18
meeting 18
i 18
collect 18
my 18
bow 18
and 18
at 18
the 18
last 18
minute 18
remember 18
the 18
rose 18
glistening 18
in 18
its 18
glass 18
of 18
water 18
when 18
i 18
open 18
the 18
door 18
to 18
the 18
bathroom 18
i 18
find 18
my 18
prep 18
team 18
sitting 18
in 18
a 18
row 18
on 18
the 18
edge 18
of 18
the 18
tub 18
hunched 18
and 18
defeated 18
i 18
remember 18
im 18
not 18
the 18
only 18
one 18
whose 18
world 18
has 18
been 18
stripped 18
away 18
come 18
on 18
i 18
tell 18
them 18
weve 18
got 18
an 18
audience 18
waiting 18
im 18
expecting 18
a 18
production 18
meeting 18
in 18
which 18
plutarch 18
instructs 18
me 18
where 18
to 18
stand 18
and 18
gives 18
me 18
my 18
cue 18
for 18
shooting 18
snow 18
instead 18
i 18
find 18
myself 18
sent 18
into 18
a 18
room 18
where 18
six 18
people 18
sit 18
around 18
a 18
table 18
peeta 18
johanna 18
beetee 18
haymitch 18
annie 18
and 18
enobaria 18
they 18
all 18
wear 18
the 18
gray 18
rebel 18
uniforms 18
from 18
no 18
one 18
looks 18
particularly 18
well 18
whats 18
this 18
i 18
say 18
were 18
not 18
sure 18
haymitch 18
answers 18
it 18
appears 18
to 18
be 18
a 18
gathering 18
of 18
the 18
remaining 18
victors 18
were 18
all 18
thats 18
left 18
i 18
ask 18
the 18
price 18
of 18
celebrity 18
says 18
beetee 18
we 18
were 18
targeted 18
from 18
both 18
sides 18
the 18
capitol 18
killed 18
the 18
victors 18
they 18
suspected 18
of 18
being 18
rebels 18
the 18
rebels 18
killed 18
those 18
thought 18
to 18
be 18
allied 18
with 18
the 18
capitol 18
johanna 18
scowls 18
at 18
enobaria 18
so 18
whats 18
she 18
doing 18
here 18
she 18
is 18
protected 18
under 18
what 18
we 18
call 18
the 18
mockingjay 18
deal 18
says 18
coin 18
as 18
she 18
enters 18
behind 18
me 18
wherein 18
katniss 18
everdeen 18
agreed 18
to 18
support 18
the 18
rebels 18
in 18
exchange 18
for 18
captured 18
victors 18
immunity 18
katniss 18
has 18
upheld 18
her 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
bargain 18
and 18
so 18
shall 18
we 18
enobaria 18
smiles 18
at 18
johanna 18
dont 18
look 18
so 18
smug 18
says 18
johanna 18
well 18
kill 18
you 18
anyway 18
sit 18
down 18
please 18
katniss 18
says 18
coin 18
closing 18
the 18
door 18
i 18
take 18
a 18
seat 18
between 18
annie 18
and 18
beetee 18
carefully 18
placing 18
snows 18
rose 18
on 18
the 18
table 18
as 18
usual 18
coin 18
gets 18
right 18
to 18
the 18
point 18
ive 18
asked 18
you 18
here 18
to 18
settle 18
a 18
debate 18
today 18
we 18
will 18
execute 18
snow 18
in 18
the 18
previous 18
weeks 18
hundreds 18
of 18
his 18
accomplices 18
in 18
the 18
oppression 18
of 18
panem 18
have 18
been 18
tried 18
and 18
now 18
await 18
their 18
own 18
deaths 18
however 18
the 18
suffering 18
in 18
the 18
districts 18
has 18
been 18
so 18
extreme 18
that 18
these 18
measures 18
appear 18
insufficient 18
to 18
the 18
victims 18
in 18
fact 18
many 18
are 18
calling 18
for 18
a 18
complete 18
annihilation 18
of 18
those 18
who 18
held 18
capitol 18
citizenship 18
however 18
in 18
the 18
interest 18
of 18
maintaining 18
a 18
sustainable 18
population 18
we 18
cannot 18
afford 18
this 18
through 18
the 18
water 18
in 18
the 18
glass 18
i 18
see 18
a 18
distorted 18
image 18
of 18
one 18
of 18
peetas 18
hands 18
the 18
burn 18
marks 18
we 18
are 18
both 18
fire 18
mutts 18
now 18
my 18
eyes 18
travel 18
up 18
to 18
where 18
the 18
flames 18
licked 18
across 18
his 18
forehead 18
singeing 18
away 18
his 18
brows 18
but 18
just 18
missing 18
his 18
eyes 18
those 18
same 18
blue 18
eyes 18
that 18
used 18
to 18
meet 18
mine 18
and 18
then 18
flit 18
away 18
at 18
school 18
just 18
as 18
they 18
do 18
now 18
so 18
an 18
alternative 18
has 18
been 18
placed 18
on 18
the 18
table 18
since 18
my 18
colleagues 18
and 18
i 18
can 18
come 18
to 18
no 18
consensus 18
it 18
has 18
been 18
agreed 18
that 18
we 18
will 18
let 18
the 18
victors 18
decide 18
a 18
majority 18
of 18
four 18
will 18
approve 18
the 18
plan 18
no 18
one 18
may 18
abstain 18
from 18
the 18
vote 18
says 18
coin 18
what 18
has 18
been 18
proposed 18
is 18
that 18
in 18
lieu 18
of 18
eliminating 18
the 18
entire 18
capitol 18
population 18
we 18
have 18
a 18
final 18
symbolic 18
hunger 18
games 18
using 18
the 18
children 18
directly 18
related 18
to 18
those 18
who 18
held 18
the 18
most 18
power 18
all 18
seven 18
of 18
us 18
turn 18
to 18
her 18
what 18
says 18
johanna 18
we 18
hold 18
another 18
hunger 18
games 18
using 18
capitol 18
children 18
says 18
coin 18
are 18
you 18
joking 18
asks 18
peeta 18
no 18
i 18
should 18
also 18
tell 18
you 18
that 18
if 18
we 18
do 18
hold 18
the 18
games 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
known 18
it 18
was 18
done 18
with 18
your 18
approval 18
although 18
the 18
individual 18
breakdown 18
of 18
your 18
votes 18
will 18
be 18
kept 18
secret 18
for 18
your 18
own 18
security 18
coin 18
tells 18
us 18
was 18
this 18
plutarchs 18
idea 18
asks 18
haymitch 18
it 18
was 18
mine 18
says 18
coin 18
it 18
seemed 18
to 18
balance 18
the 18
need 18
for 18
vengeance 18
with 18
the 18
least 18
loss 18
of 18
life 18
you 18
may 18
cast 18
your 18
votes 18
no 18

games 18
why 18
not 18
johanna 18
retorts 18
it 18

a 18
group 18
of 18
people 18
sit 18
around 18
and 18
cast 18
their 18

for 18
mercy 18
that 18
was 18
beaten 18
down 18
by 18
the 18
calls 18
for 18
the 18
deaths 18
of 18
the 18
districts 18

up 18
into 18
my 18
nose 18
down 18
into 18
my 18
throat 18
squeezing 18
it 18
tight 18
with 18
despair 18
all 18
those 18
people 18
i 18
loved 18
dead 18
and 18
we 18
are 18
discussing 18

nothing 18
has 18
changed 18
nothing 18
will 18
ever 18
change 18
now 18

i 18
can 18
feel 18
haymitch 18
watching 18
me 18

is 18
the 18
moment 18
then 18
when 18

find 18
out 18
exactly 18
just 18
how 18
alike 18

as 18
she 18
passes 18

me 18
the 18
last 18
touch 18
of 18
powder 18
the 18
instructions 18
from 18
plutarch 18
as 18
im 18
guided 18
to 18
the 18
front 18
doors 18
of 18
the 18
mansion 18
the 18
city 18
circle 18
runs 18
over 18
spills 18
people 18
down 18
the 18
side 18
streets 18

cheers 18
that 18
indicate 18

appeared 18
on 18
the 18
balcony 18
then 18
effie 18
taps 18
my 18
shoulder 18
and 18
i 18
step 18
out 18
into 18
the 18
cold 18
winter 18
sunlight 18
walk 18
to 18
my 18
position 18
accompanied 18
by 18
the 18
deafening 18
roar 18
of 18
the 18
crowd 18
as 18
directed 18
i 18
turn 18
so 18
they 18
see 18
me 18
in 18
profile 18
and 18
wait 18
when 18
they 18
march 18
snow 18
out 18
the 18
door 18
the 18
audience 18
goes 18
insane 18
they 18
secure 18
his 18
hands 18
behind 18
a 18
post 18
which 18
is 18
unnecessary 18
hes 18
not 18
going 18
anywhere 18
theres 18
nowhere 18
to 18
go 18
this 18
is 18
not 18
the 18
roomy 18
stage 18
before 18
the 18
training 18
center 18
but 18
the 18
narrow 18
terrace 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
the 18
presidents 18
mansion 18
no 18
wonder 18
no 18
one 18
bothered 18
to 18
have 18
me 18
practice 18
hes 18
ten 18
yards 18
away 18
i 18
feel 18
the 18
bow 18
purring 18
in 18
my 18
hand 18
reach 18
back 18
and 18
grasp 18
the 18
arrow 18
position 18
it 18
aim 18
at 18
the 18
rose 18
but 18
watch 18
his 18
face 18
he 18
coughs 18
and 18
a 18
bloody 18
dribble 18
runs 18
down 18
his 18
chin 18
his 18
tongue 18
flicks 18
over 18
his 18
puffy 18
lips 18
i 18
search 18
his 18
eyes 18
for 18
the 18
slightest 18
sign 18
of 18
anything 18
fear 18
remorse 18
anger 18
but 18
theres 18
only 18
the 18
same 18
look 18
of 18
amusement 18
that 18
ended 18
our 18
last 18
conversation 18
its 18
as 18
if 18
hes 18
speaking 18
the 18
words 18
again 18
oh 18
my 18
dear 18
miss 18
everdeen 18
i 18
thought 18
we 18
had 18
agreed 18
not 18
to 18
lie 18
to 18
each 18
other 18
hes 18
right 18
we 18
did 18
the 18
point 18
of 18
my 18
arrow 18
shifts 18
upward 18
i 18
release 18
the 18
string 18
and 18
president 18
coin 18
collapses 18
over 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
balcony 18
and 18
plunges 18
to 18
the 18
ground 18
dead 18
in 18
the 18
stunned 18
reaction 18
that 18
follows 18
im 18
aware 18
of 18
one 18
sound 18
snows 18
laughter 18
an 18
awful 18
gurgling 18
cackle 18
accompanied 18
by 18
an 18
eruption 18
of 18
foamy 18
blood 18
when 18
the 18
coughing 18
begins 18
i 18
see 18
him 18
bend 18
forward 18
spewing 18
out 18
his 18
life 18
until 18
the 18
guards 18
block 18
him 18
from 18
my 18
sight 18
as 18
the 18
gray 18
uniforms 18
begin 18
to 18
converge 18
on 18
me 18
i 18
think 18
of 18
what 18
my 18
brief 18
future 18
as 18
the 18
assassin 18
of 18
panems 18
new 18
president 18
holds 18
the 18
interrogation 18
probable 18
torture 18
certain 18
public 18
execution 18
having 18
yet 18
again 18
to 18
say 18
my 18
final 18
goodbyes 18
to 18
the 18
handful 18
of 18
people 18
who 18
still 18
maintain 18
a 18
hold 18
on 18
my 18
heart 18
the 18
prospect 18
of 18
facing 18
my 18
mother 18
who 18
will 18
now 18
be 18
entirely 18
alone 18
in 18
the 18
world 18
decides 18
it 18
good 18
night 18
i 18
whisper 18
to 18
the 18
bow 18
in 18
my 18
hand 18
and 18
feel 18
it 18
go 18
still 18
i 18
raise 18
my 18
left 18
arm 18
and 18
twist 18
my 18
neck 18
down 18
to 18
rip 18
off 18
the 18
pill 18
on 18
my 18
sleeve 18
instead 18
my 18
teeth 18
sink 18
into 18
flesh 18
i 18
yank 18
my 18
head 18
back 18
in 18
confusion 18
to 18
find 18
myself 18
looking 18
into 18
peetas 18
eyes 18
only 18
now 18
they 18
hold 18
my 18
gaze 18
blood 18
runs 18
from 18
the 18
teeth 18
marks 18
on 18
the 18
hand 18
he 18
clamped 18
over 18
my 18
nightlock 18
let 18
me 18
go 18
i 18
snarl 18
at 18
him 18
trying 18
to 18
wrest 18
my 18
arm 18
from 18
his 18
grasp 18
i 18
cant 18
he 18
says 18
as 18
they 18
pull 18
me 18
away 18
from 18
him 18
i 18
feel 18
the 18
pocket 18
ripped 18
from 18
my 18
sleeve 18
see 18
the 18
deep 18
violet 18
pill 18
fall 18
to 18
the 18
ground 18
watch 18
cinnas 18

gift 18
get 18
crunched 18
under 18
a 18
guards 18
boot 18

transform 18
into 18
a 18
wild 18
animal 18
kicking 18
clawing 18
biting 18
doing 18
whatever 18
i 18
can 18
to 18
free 18
myself 18
from 18
this 18
web 18
of 18
hands 18
as 18
the 18
crowd 18
pushes 18
in 18
the 18
guards 18
lift 18
me 18
up 18
above 18
the 18
fray 18
where 18
i 18
continue 18
to 18
thrash 18
as 18
im 18
conveyed 18
over 18
the 18
crush 18
of 18
people 18
i 18
start 18
screaming 18
for 18
gale 18
i 18
cant 18
find 18
him 18

room 18
at 18

one 18
where 18
i 18

during 18
those 18
last 18
precious 18
days 18
before 18

the 18
closet 18

showing 18
the 18
emptiness 18
inside 18
but 18

off 18
my 18
mockingjay 18

or 18
two 18
but 18
its 18
my 18
skin 18
thats 18

most 18
dearly 18
for 18
my 18
struggle 18
with 18

guards 18
the 18
new 18
pink 18
stuff 18

through 18
the 18
laboratorygrown 18
cells 18

up 18
though 18
and 18

too 18
far 18
gone 18
to 18
care 18
i 18
crawl 18
up 18
onto 18
the 18

sent 18
up 18
from 18
the 18
mysterious 18
kitchen 18

the 18
manner 18
of 18
my 18
suicide 18
i 18
curl 18
back 18
up 18
on 18
the 18
bloodstained 18
mattress 18
not 18
cold 18
but 18
feeling 18
so 18
naked 18
with 18
just 18
the 18
paper 18
to 18
cover 18
my 18
tender 18
flesh 18

i 18
can 18
make 18
an 18
excellent 18
noose 18
but 18
theres 18
nothing 18
to 18
hang 18
myself 18
from 18
its 18
possible 18
i 18
could 18
hoard 18
my 18
pills 18
and 18
then 18
knock 18
myself 18
off 18
with 18
a 18
lethal 18
dose 18
except 18
that 18
im 18
sure 18
im 18
being 18
watched 18
round 18
the 18
clock 18
for 18
all 18
i 18
know 18
im 18
on 18
live 18
television 18
at 18
this 18
very 18
moment 18
while 18
commentators 18
try 18
to 18
analyze 18
what 18
could 18
possibly 18
have 18
motivated 18
me 18
to 18
kill 18
coin 18
the 18
surveillance 18
makes 18
almost 18
any 18
suicide 18
attempt 18
impossible 18
taking 18
my 18
life 18
is 18
the 18
capitols 18
privilege 18
again 18
what 18
i 18
can 18
do 18
is 18
give 18
up 18
i 18
resolve 18
to 18
lie 18
on 18
the 18
bed 18
without 18
eating 18
drinking 18
or 18
taking 18
my 18
medications 18
i 18
could 18
do 18
it 18
too 18
just 18
die 18
if 18
it 18
werent 18
for 18
the 18
morphling 18
withdrawal 18
not 18
bit 18
by 18
bit 18
like 18
in 18
the 18
hospital 18
in 18
but 18
cold 18
turkey 18
i 18
must 18
have 18
been 18
on 18
a 18
fairly 18
large 18
dose 18
because 18
when 18
the 18
craving 18
for 18
it 18
hits 18
accompanied 18
by 18
tremors 18
and 18
shooting 18
pains 18
and 18
unbearable 18
cold 18
my 18
resolves 18
crushed 18
like 18
an 18
eggshell 18
im 18
on 18
my 18
knees 18
raking 18
the 18
carpet 18
with 18
my 18
fingernails 18
to 18
find 18
those 18
precious 18
pills 18
i 18
flung 18
away 18
in 18
a 18
stronger 18
moment 18
i 18
revise 18
my 18
suicide 18
plan 18
to 18
slow 18
death 18
by 18
morphling 18
i 18
will 18
become 18
a 18
yellowskinned 18
bag 18
of 18
bones 18
with 18
enormous 18
eyes 18
im 18
a 18
couple 18
of 18
days 18
into 18
the 18
plan 18
making 18
good 18
progress 18
when 18
something 18
unexpected 18
happens 18
i 18
begin 18
to 18
sing 18
at 18
the 18
window 18
in 18
the 18
shower 18
in 18
my 18
sleep 18
hour 18
after 18
hour 18
of 18
ballads 18
love 18
songs 18
mountain 18
airs 18
all 18
the 18
songs 18
my 18
father 18
taught 18
me 18
before 18
he 18
died 18
for 18
certainly 18
there 18
has 18
been 18
very 18
little 18
music 18
in 18
my 18
life 18
since 18
whats 18
amazing 18
is 18
how 18
clearly 18
i 18
remember 18
them 18
the 18
tunes 18
the 18
lyrics 18
my 18
voice 18
at 18
first 18
rough 18
and 18
breaking 18
on 18
the 18
high 18
notes 18
warms 18
up 18
into 18
something 18
splendid 18
a 18
voice 18
that 18
would 18
make 18
the 18
mockingjays 18
fall 18
silent 18
and 18
then 18
tumble 18
over 18
themselves 18
to 18
join 18
in 18
days 18
pass 18
weeks 18
i 18
watch 18
the 18
snows 18
fall 18
on 18
the 18
ledge 18
outside 18
my 18
window 18
and 18
in 18
all 18
that 18
time 18
mine 18
is 18
the 18
only 18
voice 18
i 18
hear 18
what 18
are 18
they 18
doing 18
anyway 18
whats 18
the 18
holdup 18
out 18
there 18
how 18
difficult 18
can 18
it 18
be 18
to 18
arrange 18
the 18
execution 18
of 18
one 18
murderous 18
girl 18
i 18
continue 18
with 18
my 18
own 18
annihilation 18
my 18
bodys 18
thinner 18
than 18
its 18
ever 18
been 18
and 18
my 18
battle 18
against 18
hunger 18
is 18
so 18
fierce 18
that 18
sometimes 18
the 18
animal 18
part 18
of 18
me 18
gives 18
in 18
to 18
the 18
temptation 18
of 18
buttered 18
bread 18
or 18
roasted 18
meat 18
but 18
still 18
im 18
winning 18
for 18
a 18
few 18
days 18
i 18
feel 18
quite 18
unwell 18
and 18
think 18
i 18
may 18
finally 18
be 18
traveling 18
out 18
of 18
this 18
life 18
when 18
i 18
realize 18
my 18
morphling 18
tablets 18
are 18
shrinking 18
they 18
are 18
trying 18
to 18
slowly 18
wean 18
me 18
off 18
the 18
stuff 18
but 18
why 18
surely 18
a 18
drugged 18
mockingjay 18
will 18
be 18
easier 18
to 18
dispose 18
of 18
in 18
front 18
of 18
a 18
crowd 18
and 18
then 18
a 18
terrible 18
thought 18
hits 18
me 18
what 18
if 18
theyre 18
not 18
going 18
to 18
kill 18
me 18
what 18
if 18
they 18
have 18
more 18
plans 18
for 18
me 18
a 18
new 18
way 18
to 18
remake 18
train 18
and 18
use 18
me 18
i 18
wont 18
do 18
it 18
if 18
i 18
cant 18
kill 18
myself 18
in 18
this 18
room 18
i 18
will 18
take 18
the 18
first 18
opportunity 18
outside 18
of 18
it 18
to 18
finish 18
the 18
job 18
they 18
can 18
fatten 18
me 18
up 18
they 18
can 18
give 18
me 18
a 18
full 18
body 18
polish 18
dress 18
me 18
up 18
and 18
make 18
me 18
beautiful 18
again 18
they 18
can 18
design 18
dream 18
weapons 18
that 18
come 18
to 18
life 18
in 18
my 18
hands 18
but 18
they 18
will 18
never 18
again 18
brainwash 18
me 18
into 18
the 18
necessity 18
of 18
using 18
them 18
i 18
no 18
longer 18
feel 18
any 18
allegiance 18
to 18
these 18
monsters 18
called 18
human 18
beings 18
despise 18
being 18
one 18
myself 18
i 18
think 18
that 18
peeta 18
was 18
onto 18
something 18
about 18
us 18
destroying 18
one 18
another 18
and 18
letting 18
some 18
decent 18
species 18
take 18
over 18
because 18
something 18
is 18
significantly 18
wrong 18
with 18
a 18
creature 18
that 18
sacrifices 18
its 18
childrens 18
lives 18
to 18
settle 18
its 18
differences 18
you 18
can 18
spin 18
it 18
any 18
way 18
you 18
like 18
snow 18
thought 18
the 18
hunger 18
games 18
were 18
an 18
efficient 18
means 18
of 18
control 18
coin 18
thought 18
the 18
parachutes 18
would 18
expedite 18
the 18
war 18
but 18
in 18
the 18
end 18
who 18
does 18
it 18
benefit 18
no 18
one 18
the 18
truth 18
is 18
it 18
benefits 18
no 18
one 18
to 18
live 18
in 18
a 18
world 18
where 18
these 18
things 18
happen 18
after 18
two 18
days 18
of 18
my 18
lying 18
on 18
my 18
mattress 18
with 18
no 18
attempt 18
to 18
eat 18
drink 18
or 18
even 18
take 18
a 18
morphling 18
tablet 18
the 18
door 18
to 18
my 18
room 18
opens 18
someone 18
crosses 18
around 18
the 18
bed 18
into 18
my 18
field 18
of 18
vision 18
haymitch 18
your 18
trials 18
over 18
he 18
says 18
come 18
on 18
were 18
going 18
home 18
home 18
whats 18
he 18
talking 18
about 18
my 18
homes 18
gone 18
and 18
even 18
if 18
it 18
were 18
possible 18
to 18
go 18
to 18
this 18
imaginary 18
place 18
i 18
am 18
too 18
weak 18
to 18
move 18
strangers 18
appear 18
rehydrate 18
and 18
feed 18
me 18
bathe 18
and 18
clothe 18
me 18
one 18
lifts 18
me 18
like 18
a 18
rag 18
doll 18
and 18
carries 18
me 18
up 18
to 18
the 18
roof 18
onto 18
a 18
hovercraft 18
and 18
fastens 18
me 18
into 18
a 18
seat 18
haymitch 18
and 18
plutarch 18
sit 18
across 18
from 18
me 18
in 18
a 18
few 18
moments 18
were 18
airborne 18
ive 18
never 18
seen 18
plutarch 18
in 18
such 18
a 18
good 18
mood 18
hes 18
positively 18
glowing 18
you 18
must 18
have 18
a 18
million 18
questions 18
when 18
i 18
dont 18
respond 18
he 18
answers 18
them 18
anyway 18
after 18
i 18
shot 18
coin 18
there 18
was 18
pandemonium 18
when 18
the 18
ruckus 18
died 18
down 18
they 18
discovered 18
snows 18
body 18
still 18
tethered 18
to 18
the 18
post 18
opinions 18
differ 18
on 18
whether 18
he 18
choked 18
to 18
death 18
while 18
laughing 18
or 18
was 18
crushed 18
by 18
the 18
crowd 18
no 18
one 18
really 18
cares 18
an 18
emergency 18
election 18
was 18
thrown 18
together 18
and 18
paylor 18
was 18
voted 18
in 18
as 18
president 18
plutarch 18
was 18
appointed 18
secretary 18
of 18
communications 18
which 18
means 18
he 18
sets 18
the 18
programming 18
for 18
the 18
airwaves 18
the 18
first 18
big 18
televised 18
event 18
was 18
my 18
trial 18
in 18
which 18
he 18
was 18
also 18
a 18
star 18
witness 18
in 18
my 18
defense 18
of 18
course 18
although 18
most 18
of 18
the 18
credit 18
for 18
my 18
exoneration 18
must 18
be 18
given 18
to 18
dr 18
aurelius 18
who 18
apparently 18
earned 18
his 18
naps 18
by 18
presenting 18
me 18
as 18
a 18
hopeless 18
shellshocked 18
lunatic 18
one 18
condition 18
for 18
my 18
release 18
is 18
that 18
ill 18
continue 18
under 18
his 18
care 18
although 18
it 18
will 18
have 18
to 18
be 18
by 18
phone 18
because 18
hed 18
never 18
live 18
in 18
a 18
forsaken 18
place 18
like 18
and 18
im 18
confined 18
there 18
until 18
further 18
notice 18
the 18
truth 18
is 18
no 18
one 18
quite 18
knows 18
what 18
to 18
do 18
with 18
me 18
now 18
that 18
the 18
wars 18
over 18
although 18
if 18
another 18
one 18
should 18
spring 18
up 18
plutarchs 18
sure 18
they 18
could 18
find 18
a 18
role 18
for 18
me 18
then 18
plutarch 18
has 18
a 18
good 18
laugh 18
it 18
never 18
seems 18
to 18
bother 18
him 18
when 18
no 18
one 18
else 18
appreciates 18
his 18
jokes 18
are 18
you 18
preparing 18
for 18
another 18
war 18
plutarch 18
i 18
ask 18
oh 18
not 18
now 18
now 18
were 18
in 18
that 18
sweet 18
period 18
where 18
everyone 18
agrees 18
that 18
our 18
recent 18
horrors 18
should 18
never 18
be 18
repeated 18
he 18
says 18
but 18
collective 18
thinking 18
is 18
usually 18
shortlived 18
were 18
fickle 18
stupid 18
beings 18
with 18
poor 18
memories 18
and 18
a 18
great 18
gift 18
for 18
selfdestruction 18
although 18
who 18
knows 18
maybe 18
this 18
will 18
be 18
it 18
katniss 18
what 18
i 18
ask 18
the 18
time 18
it 18
sticks 18
maybe 18
we 18
are 18
witnessing 18
the 18
evolution 18
of 18
the 18
human 18
race 18
think 18
about 18
that 18
and 18
then 18
he 18
asks 18
me 18
if 18
id 18
like 18
to 18
perform 18
on 18
a 18
new 18
singing 18
program 18
hes 18
launching 18
in 18
a 18
few 18
weeks 18
something 18
upbeat 18
would 18
be 18
good 18
hell 18
send 18
the 18
crew 18
to 18
my 18
house 18
we 18
land 18
briefly 18
in 18
district 18
to 18
drop 18
off 18
plutarch 18
hes 18
meeting 18
with 18
beetee 18
to 18
update 18
the 18
technology 18
on 18
the 18
broadcast 18
system 18
his 18
parting 18
words 18
to 18
me 18
are 18
dont 18
be 18
a 18
stranger 18
when 18

back 18
among 18
the 18
clouds 18
i 18
look 18
at 18
haymitch 18
so 18
why 18
are 18
you 18
going 18
back 18
to 18
twelve 18
they 18
cant 18
seem 18
to 18
find 18
a 18
place 18
for 18
me 18
in 18
the 18
capitol 18
either 18
he 18
says 18
at 18
first 18
i 18
dont 18
question 18
this 18
but 18
doubts 18
begin 18
to 18
creep 18
in 18
haymitch 18
hasnt 18
assassinated 18
anyone 18
he 18
could 18
go 18
anywhere 18
if 18
hes 18
coming 18
back 18
to 18
its 18
because 18
hes 18
been 18
ordered 18
to 18
you 18
have 18
to 18
look 18
after 18
me 18
dont 18
you 18
as 18
my 18
mentor 18
he 18
shrugs 18
then 18
i 18
realize 18
what 18
it 18
means 18
my 18
mothers 18
not 18
coming 18
back 18
no 18
he 18
says 18
he 18
pulls 18
an 18
envelope 18
from 18
his 18
jacket 18
pocket 18
and 18
hands 18
it 18
to 18
me 18
i 18
examine 18
the 18
delicate 18
perfectly 18
formed 18
writing 18
shes 18
helping 18
to 18
start 18
up 18
a 18
hospital 18
in 18
district 18
four 18
she 18
wants 18

as 18
soon 18
as 18
we 18
get 18
in 18
my 18
finger 18
traces 18
the 18
graceful 18
swoop 18
of 18
the 18
letters 18
you 18
know 18
why 18
she 18
cant 18
come 18
back 18

why 18
because 18
between 18
my 18
father 18
and 18
prim 18
and 18
the 18
ashes 18
the 18
place 18
is 18
too 18
painful 18
to 18
bear 18
but 18
apparently 18
not 18
for 18
me 18

mentor 18
haymitch 18
makes 18
me 18
eat 18
a 18
sandwich 18

he 18
believes 18

asleep 18
for 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
the 18

he 18
busies 18
himself 18
going 18
through 18
every 18
compartment 18
on 18
the 18
hovercraft 18
finding 18
the 18
liquor 18

stowing 18

asleep 18
on 18
the 18
sofa 18
in 18
the 18
formal 18
living 18
room 18
a 18
terrible 18
nightmare 18
follows 18
where 18
im 18
lying 18
at 18
the 18
bottom 18
of 18
a 18
deep 18
grave 18
and 18
every 18
dead 18
person 18
i 18
know 18
by 18
name 18
comes 18
by 18
and 18
throws 18
a 18
shovel 18
full 18
of 18
ashes 18
on 18
me 18
its 18
quite 18
a 18
long 18
dream 18
considering 18
the 18
list 18
of 18
people 18
and 18
the 18
deeper 18
im 18
buried 18
the 18
harder 18
it 18
is 18
to 18
breathe 18
i 18
try 18
to 18
call 18
out 18
begging 18
them 18
to 18
stop 18
but 18
the 18
ashes 18
fill 18
my 18
mouth 18
and 18
nose 18
and 18
i 18
cant 18
make 18
any 18
sound 18
still 18
the 18
shovel 18
scrapes 18
on 18
and 18
on 18
and 18
on 18
i 18
wake 18
with 18
a 18
start 18
pale 18
morning 18
light 18
comes 18
around 18
the 18
edges 18
of 18
the 18
shutters 18
the 18
scraping 18
of 18
the 18
shovel 18
continues 18
still 18
half 18
in 18
the 18
nightmare 18
i 18
run 18
down 18
the 18
hall 18
out 18
the 18
front 18
door 18
and 18
around 18
the 18

house 18
because 18

frowning 18
slightly 18
though 18
as 18
he 18
takes 18
me 18
in 18
i 18
make 18
a 18
halfhearted 18
effort 18
to 18
push 18
my 18
hair 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18
realize 18
its 18
matted 18
into 18
clumps 18
i 18
feel 18
defensive 18
what 18
are 18
you 18
doing 18
i 18
went 18
to 18
the 18
woods 18
this 18
morning 18
and 18
dug 18
these 18
up 18
for 18
her 18
he 18
says 18
i 18
thought 18
we 18
could 18
plant 18
them 18
along 18
the 18
side 18
of 18
the 18
house 18
i 18
look 18
at 18
the 18
bushes 18
the 18
clods 18
of 18
dirt 18
hanging 18
from 18
their 18
roots 18
and 18
catch 18
my 18
breath 18
as 18
the 18
word 18
rose 18
registers 18
im 18
about 18
to 18
yell 18
vicious 18
things 18
at 18
peeta 18
when 18
the 18
full 18
name 18
comes 18
to 18
me 18
not 18
plain 18
rose 18
but 18
evening 18
primrose 18
the 18
flower 18
my 18
sister 18
was 18
named 18
for 18
i 18
give 18
peeta 18
a 18
nod 18
of 18
assent 18
and 18
hurry 18
back 18
into 18
the 18
house 18
locking 18
the 18
door 18
behind 18
me 18
but 18
the 18
evil 18
thing 18
is 18
inside 18
not 18
out 18
trembling 18
with 18
weakness 18
and 18
anxiety 18
i 18
run 18
up 18
the 18
stairs 18
my 18
foot 18
catches 18
on 18
the 18
last 18
step 18
and 18
i 18
crash 18
onto 18
the 18
floor 18
i 18
force 18
myself 18
to 18
rise 18
and 18
enter 18
my 18
room 18
the 18
smells 18
very 18
faint 18
but 18
still 18
laces 18
the 18
air 18
its 18
there 18
the 18
white 18
rose 18
among 18
the 18
dried 18
flowers 18
in 18
the 18
vase 18
shriveled 18
and 18
fragile 18
but 18
holding 18
on 18
to 18
that 18
unnatural 18
perfection 18
cultivated 18
in 18
snows 18
greenhouse 18
i 18
grab 18
the 18
vase 18
stumble 18
down 18
to 18
the 18
kitchen 18
and 18
throw 18
its 18
contents 18
into 18
the 18
embers 18
as 18
the 18
flowers 18
flare 18
up 18
a 18
burst 18
of 18
blue 18
flame 18
envelops 18
the 18
rose 18
and 18
devours 18
it 18
fire 18
beats 18
roses 18
again 18
i 18
smash 18
the 18
vase 18
on 18
the 18
floor 18
for 18
good 18
measure 18
back 18
upstairs 18
i 18
throw 18
open 18
the 18
bedroom 18
windows 18
to 18
clear 18
out 18
the 18
rest 18
of 18
snows 18
stench 18
but 18
it 18
still 18
lingers 18
on 18
my 18
clothes 18
and 18
in 18
my 18
pores 18
i 18
strip 18
and 18
flakes 18
of 18
skin 18
the 18
size 18
of 18
playing 18
cards 18
cling 18
to 18
the 18
garments 18
avoiding 18
the 18
mirror 18
i 18
step 18
into 18
the 18
shower 18
and 18
scrub 18
the 18
roses 18
from 18
my 18
hair 18
my 18
body 18
my 18
mouth 18
bright 18
pink 18
and 18
tingling 18
i 18
find 18
something 18
clean 18
to 18

moment 18
to 18

the 18
sweat 18
from 18
his 18
face 18
with 18
a 18
rag 18
i 18
remember 18
seeing 18
him 18
in 18
but 18
he 18
must 18
have 18
come 18
back 18
his 18
greeting 18
gives 18
me 18
the 18
courage 18
to 18
ask 18
did 18
they 18
find 18
anyone 18
in 18
there 18
whole 18

me 18
the 18
pin 18
that 18
gave 18
me 18
a 18
name 18
i 18
swallow 18
hard 18
wonder 18
if 18
shell 18
be 18
joining 18
the 18
cast 18
of 18
my 18
nightmares 18
tonight 18
shoveling 18
the 18
ashes 18
into 18
my 18
mouth 18
i 18
thought 18
maybe 18
since 18
he 18
was 18
the 18
mayor 18
i 18
dont 18
think 18
being 18
the 18
mayor 18
of 18
twelve 18
put 18
the 18
odds 18
in 18
his 18
favor 18
says 18
thom 18
i 18
nod 18
and 18
keep 18
moving 18
careful 18
not 18
to 18
look 18
in 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
the 18
cart 18
all 18
through 18
the 18
town 18
and 18
the 18
seam 18
its 18
the 18
same 18
the 18
reaping 18
of 18
the 18
dead 18
as 18
i 18
near 18
the 18
ruins 18
of 18
my 18
old 18
house 18
the 18
road 18
becomes 18
thick 18
with 18
carts 18
the 18
meadows 18
gone 18
or 18
at 18
least 18
dramatically 18
altered 18
a 18
deep 18
pit 18
has 18
been 18
dug 18
and 18
theyre 18
lining 18
it 18
with 18
bones 18
a 18
mass 18
grave 18
for 18
my 18
people 18
i 18
skirt 18
around 18
the 18
hole 18
and 18
enter 18
the 18
woods 18
at 18
my 18
usual 18
place 18
it 18
doesnt 18
matter 18
though 18
the 18
fence 18
isnt 18
charged 18
anymore 18
and 18
has 18
been 18
propped 18
up 18
with 18
long 18
branches 18
to 18
keep 18
out 18
the 18
predators 18
but 18
old 18
habits 18
die 18
hard 18
i 18
think 18
about 18
going 18
to 18
the 18
lake 18
but 18
im 18
so 18
weak 18
that 18
i 18
barely 18
make 18
it 18
to 18
my 18
meeting 18
place 18
with 18
gale 18
i 18
sit 18
on 18
the 18
rock 18
where 18
cressida 18
filmed 18
us 18
but 18
its 18
too 18
wide 18
without 18
his 18
body 18
beside 18
me 18
several 18
times 18
i 18
close 18
my 18
eyes 18
and 18
count 18
to 18
ten 18
thinking 18
that 18
when 18
i 18
open 18
them 18
he 18
will 18
have 18
materialized 18
without 18
a 18
sound 18
as 18
he 18
so 18
often 18
did 18
i 18
have 18
to 18
remind 18
myself 18
that 18
gales 18
in 18
with 18
a 18
fancy 18
job 18
probably 18
kissing 18
another 18
pair 18
of 18
lips 18
it 18
is 18
the 18
old 18
katnisss 18
favorite 18
kind 18
of 18
day 18
early 18
spring 18
the 18
woods 18
awakening 18
after 18
the 18
long 18
winter 18
but 18
the 18
spurt 18
of 18
energy 18
that 18
began 18
with 18
the 18
primroses 18
fades 18
away 18
by 18
the 18
time 18
i 18
make 18
it 18
back 18
to 18
the 18
fence 18
im 18
so 18
sick 18
and 18
dizzy 18
thom 18
has 18
to 18
give 18
me 18
a 18
ride 18
home 18
in 18
the 18
dead 18
peoples 18
cart 18
help 18
me 18
to 18
the 18
sofa 18
in 18
the 18
living 18
room 18
where 18
i 18
watch 18
the 18
dust 18
motes 18
spin 18
in 18
the 18
thin 18
shafts 18
of 18
afternoon 18
light 18
my 18
head 18
snaps 18
around 18
at 18
the 18
hiss 18
but 18
it 18
takes 18
awhile 18
to 18
believe 18
hes 18
real 18
how 18
could 18
he 18
have 18
gotten 18

wild 18
animal 18

back 18

he 18
holds 18
slightly 18
above 18
the 18
ground 18
the 18
prominent 18
bones 18
in 18
his 18
face 18
hes 18
come 18
on 18
foot 18
then 18
all 18
the 18
way 18
from 18

maybe 18
he 18
just 18
couldnt 18
stand 18

there 18
without 18
her 18
so 18

singing 18
comes 18
out 18
of 18
my 18
body 18
giving 18
voice 18
to 18
my 18
despair 18
buttercup 18
begins 18
to 18
wail 18
as 18

my 18
body 18
until 18
eventually 18
i 18
fall 18
unconscious 18
but 18
he 18
must 18
understand 18
he 18
must 18
know 18
that 18
the 18
unthinkable 18
has 18
happened 18
and 18
to 18
survive 18
will 18
require 18
previously 18
unthinkable 18
acts 18
because 18

arrives 18
on 18
the 18
next 18
train 18
from 18
the 18

idea 18
from 18
our 18
familys 18
plant 18
book 18
the 18
place 18
where 18
we 18
recorded 18
those 18
things 18
you 18
cannot 18
trust 18
to 18
memory 18
the 18
page 18
begins 18
with 18
the 18
persons 18

if 18
not 18
a 18
sketch 18
or 18
painting 18

with 18
the 18
cookies 18
the 18
color 18
of 18

what 18

rue 18
poised 18
on 18
her 18
toes 18
arms 18
slightly 18
extended 18
like 18
a 18
bird 18
about 18
to 18
take 18
flight 18
on 18
and 18
on 18
we 18
seal 18
the 18
pages 18
with 18
salt 18
water 18
and 18

haymitch 18
finally 18
joins 18
us 18
contributing 18
twentythree 18
years 18
of 18
tributes 18
he 18
was 18
forced 18
to 18
mentor 18
additions 18
become 18
smaller 18
an 18
old 18
memory 18
that 18
surfaces 18
a 18
late 18
primrose 18
preserved 18
between 18
the 18
pages 18
strange 18
bits 18
of 18
happiness 18
like 18
the 18
photo 18
of 18
finnick 18
and 18
annies 18
newborn 18
son 18
we 18
learn 18
to 18
keep 18
busy 18
again 18
peeta 18
bakes 18
i 18
hunt 18
haymitch 18
drinks 18
until 18
the 18
liquor 18
runs 18
out 18
and 18
then 18
raises 18
geese 18
until 18
the 18
next 18
train 18
arrives 18
fortunately 18
the 18
geese 18
can 18
take 18
pretty 18
good 18
care 18
of 18
themselves 18
were 18
not 18
alone 18
a 18
few 18
hundred 18
others 18
return 18
because 18
whatever 18
has 18
happened 18
this 18
is 18
our 18
home 18
with 18
the 18
mines 18
closed 18
they 18
plow 18
the 18
ashes 18
into 18
the 18
earth 18
and 18
plant 18
food 18
machines 18
from 18
the 18
capitol 18
break 18
ground 18
for 18
a 18
new 18
factory 18
where 18
we 18
will 18
make 18
medicines 18
although 18
no 18
one 18
seeds 18
it 18
the 18
meadow 18
turns 18
green 18
again 18
peeta 18
and 18
i 18
grow 18
back 18
together 18
there 18
are 18
still 18
moments 18
when 18
he 18
clutches 18
the 18
back 18
of 18
a 18
chair 18
and 18
hangs 18
on 18
until 18
the 18
flashbacks 18
are 18
over 18
i 18
wake 18
screaming 18
from 18
nightmares 18
of 18
mutts 18
and 18
lost 18
children 18
but 18
his 18
arms 18
are 18
there 18
to 18
comfort 18
me 18
and 18
eventually 18
his 18
lips 18
on 18
the 18
night 18
i 18
feel 18
that 18
thing 18
again 18
the 18
hunger 18
that 18
overtook 18
me 18
on 18
the 18
beach 18
i 18
know 18
this 18
would 18
have 18
happened 18
anyway 18
that 18
what 18
i 18
need 18
to 18
survive 18
is 18
not 18
gales 18
fire 18
kindled 18
with 18
rage 18
and 18
hatred 18
i 18
have 18
plenty 18
of 18
fire 18
myself 18
what 18
i 18
need 18
is 18
the 18
dandelion 18
in 18
the 18
spring 18
the 18
bright 18
yellow 18
that 18
means 18
rebirth 18
instead 18
of 18
destruction 18
the 18
promise 18
that 18
life 18
can 18
go 18
on 18
no 18
matter 18
how 18
bad 18
our 18
losses 18
that 18
it 18
can 18
be 18
good 18
again 18
and 18
only 18
peeta 18
can 18
give 18
me 18
that 18
so 18
after 18
when 18
he 18
whispers 18
you 18
love 18
me 18
real 18
or 18
not 18
real 18
i 18
tell 18
him 18
real 18
epilogue 18
they 18
play 18
in 18
the 18
meadow 18
the 18
dancing 18
girl 18
with 18
the 18
dark 18
hair 18
and 18
blue 18
eyes 18
the 18
boy 18
with 18
blond 18
curls 18
and 18
gray 18
eyes 18
struggling 18
to 18
keep 18
up 18
with 18
her 18
on 18
his 18
chubby 18
toddler 18
legs 18
it 18
took 18
five 18
ten 18
fifteen 18
years 18
for 18
me 18
to 18
agree 18
but 18
peeta 18
wanted 18
them 18
so 18
badly 18
when 18
i 18
first 18
felt 18
her 18
stirring 18
inside 18
of 18
me 18
i 18
was 18
consumed 18
with 18
a 18
terror 18
that 18
felt 18
as 18
old 18
as 18
life 18
itself 18
only 18
the 18
joy 18
of 18
holding 18
her 18
in 18
my 18
arms 18
could 18
tame 18
it 18
carrying 18
him 18
was 18
a 18
little 18
easier 18
but 18
not 18
much 18
the 18
questions 18
are 18
just 18
beginning 18
the 18
arenas 18
have 18
been 18
completely 18
destroyed 18
the 18
memorials 18
built 18
there 18
are 18
no 18
more 18
hunger 18
games 18
but 18
they 18
teach 18
about 18
them 18
at 18
school 18
and 18
the 18
girl 18
knows 18
we 18
played 18
a 18
role 18
in 18
them 18
the 18
boy 18
will 18
know 18
in 18
a 18
few 18
years 18
how 18
can 18
i 18
tell 18
them 18
about 18
that 18
world 18
without 18
frightening 18
them 18
to 18
death 18
my 18
children 18
who 18
take 18
the 18
words 18
of 18
the 18
song 18
for 18
granted 18
deep 18
in 18
the 18
meadow 18
under 18
the 18
willow 18
a 18
bed 18
of 18
grass 18
a 18
soft 18
green 18
pillow 18
lay 18
down 18
your 18
head 18
and 18
close 18
your 18
sleepy 18
eyes 18
and 18
when 18
again 18
they 18
open 18
the 18
sun 18
will 18
rise 18
here 18
its 18
safe 18
here 18
its 18
warm 18
here 18
the 18
daisies 18
guard 18
you 18
from 18
every 18
harm 18
here 18
your 18
dreams 18
are 18
sweet 18
and 18
tomorrow 18
brings 18
them 18
true 18
here 18
is 18
the 18
place 18
where 18
i 18
love 18
you 18
my 18
children 18
who 18
dont 18
know 18
they 18
play 18
on 18
a 18
graveyard 18
peeta 18
says 18
it 18
will 18
be 18
okay 18
we 18
have 18
each 18
other 18
and 18
the 18
book 18
we 18
can 18
make 18
them 18
understand 18
in 18
a 18
way 18
that 18
will 18
make 18
them 18
braver 18
but 18
one 18
day 18
ill 18
have 18
to 18
explain 18
about 18
my 18
nightmares 18
why 18
they 18
came 18
why 18
they 18
wont 18
ever 18
really 18
go 18
away 18
ill 18
tell 18
them 18
how 18
i 18
survive 18
it 18
ill 18
tell 18
them 18
that 18
on 18
bad 18
mornings 18
it 18
feels 18
impossible 18
to 18
take 18
pleasure 18
in 18
anything 18
because 18
im 18
afraid 18
it 18
could 18
be 18
taken 18
away 18
thats 18
when 18
i 18
make 18
a 18
list 18
in 18
my 18
head 18
of 18
every 18
act 18
of 18
goodness 18
ive 18
seen 18
someone 18
do 18
its 18
like 18
a 18
game 18
repetitive 18
even 18
a 18
little 18
tedious 18
after 18
more 18
than 18
twenty 18
years 18
but 18
there 18
are 18
much 18
worse 18
games 18
to 18
play 18
the 18
end 18
acknowledgments 18
i 18
would 18
like 18
to 18
pay 18
