six 23

in 23
the 23

will 23

principal 23
rules 23

method 23
which 23
the 23
author 23
has 23
discovered 23
in 23
the 23
third 23
certain 23
of 23
the 23
rules 23
of 23
morals 23
which 23
he 23
has 23
deduced 23

fourth 23
the 23
reasonings 23
by 23
which 23
he 23
establishes 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
god 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
human 23
soul 23

fifth 23
the 23
order 23
of 23
the 23
physical 23
questions 23
which 23
he 23
has 23
investigated 23
and 23
in 23
particular 23
the 23
explication 23
of 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
the 23

of 23
some 23
other 23
difficulties 23
pertaining 23
to 23
medicine 23
as 23
also 23
the 23
difference 23
between 23

that 23

the 23
brutes 23

in 23
the 23
last 23
what 23
the 23
author 23
believes 23
to 23
be 23
required 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
greater 23
advancement 23
in 23
the 23
investigation 23
of 23
nature 23
than 23
has 23
yet 23
been 23
made 23
with 23
the 23
reasons 23
that 23

induced 23

good 23
sense 23
is 23
of 23
all 23
things 23
among 23
men 23
the 23
most 23
equally 23
distributed 23
for 23
every 23
one 23
thinks 23
himself 23
so 23
abundantly 23
provided 23
with 23
it 23
that 23
those 23
even 23
who 23
are 23
the 23
most 23
difficult 23
to 23
satisfy 23
in 23
everything 23
else 23
do 23
not 23
usually 23
desire 23
a 23
larger 23
measure 23
of 23
this 23
quality 23
than 23
they 23
already 23
possess 23
and 23
in 23
this 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
likely 23
that 23
all 23
are 23
mistaken 23
the 23
conviction 23
is 23
rather 23
to 23
be 23
held 23
as 23
testifying 23
that 23
the 23
power 23
of 23
judging 23
aright 23
and 23
of 23
distinguishing 23
truth 23
from 23
error 23
which 23
is 23
properly 23
what 23
is 23
called 23
good 23
sense 23
or 23
reason 23
is 23
by 23
nature 23
equal 23
in 23
all 23
men 23
and 23
that 23
the 23
diversity 23
of 23
our 23
opinions 23
consequently 23
does 23
not 23
arise 23
from 23
some 23
being 23
endowed 23
with 23
a 23
larger 23
share 23
of 23
reason 23
than 23
others 23
but 23
solely 23
from 23
this 23
that 23
we 23
conduct 23
our 23
thoughts 23
along 23
different 23
ways 23
and 23
do 23
not 23
fix 23
our 23
attention 23
on 23
the 23
same 23
objects 23
for 23
to 23
be 23
possessed 23
of 23
a 23
vigorous 23
mind 23
is 23
not 23
enough 23
the 23
prime 23
requisite 23
is 23
rightly 23
to 23
apply 23
it 23
the 23
greatest 23
minds 23
as 23
they 23
are 23
capable 23
of 23
the 23
highest 23
excellences 23
are 23
open 23
likewise 23
to 23
the 23
greatest 23
aberrations 23
and 23
those 23
who 23
travel 23
very 23
slowly 23
may 23
yet 23
make 23
far 23
greater 23
progress 23
provided 23
they 23
keep 23
always 23
to 23
the 23
straight 23
road 23
than 23
those 23
who 23
while 23
they 23
run 23
forsake 23
it 23
for 23
myself 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
fancied 23
my 23
mind 23
to 23
be 23
in 23
any 23
respect 23
more 23
perfect 23
than 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
generality 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
i 23
have 23
often 23
wished 23
that 23
i 23
were 23
equal 23
to 23
some 23
others 23
in 23
promptitude 23
of 23
thought 23
or 23
in 23
clearness 23
and 23
distinctness 23
of 23
imagination 23
or 23
in 23
fullness 23
and 23
readiness 23
of 23
memory 23
and 23
besides 23
these 23
i 23
know 23
of 23
no 23
other 23
qualities 23
that 23
contribute 23
to 23
the 23
perfection 23
of 23
the 23
mind 23
for 23
as 23
to 23
the 23
reason 23
or 23
sense 23
inasmuch 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
that 23
alone 23
which 23
constitutes 23
us 23
men 23
and 23
distinguishes 23
us 23
from 23
the 23
brutes 23
i 23
am 23
disposed 23
to 23
believe 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
to 23
be 23
found 23
complete 23
in 23
each 23
individual 23
and 23
on 23
this 23
point 23
to 23
adopt 23
the 23
common 23
opinion 23
of 23
philosophers 23
who 23
say 23
that 23
the 23
difference 23
of 23
greater 23
and 23
less 23
holds 23
only 23
among 23
the 23
accidents 23
and 23
not 23
among 23
the 23
forms 23
or 23
natures 23
of 23
individuals 23
of 23
the 23
same 23
species 23
i 23
will 23
not 23
hesitate 23
however 23
to 23
avow 23
my 23
belief 23
that 23
it 23
has 23
been 23
my 23
singular 23
good 23
fortune 23
to 23
have 23
very 23
early 23
in 23
life 23
fallen 23
in 23
with 23
certain 23
tracks 23
which 23
have 23
conducted 23
me 23
to 23
considerations 23
and 23
maxims 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
formed 23
a 23
method 23
that 23
gives 23
me 23
the 23
means 23
as 23
i 23
think 23
of 23
gradually 23
augmenting 23
my 23
knowledge 23
and 23
of 23
raising 23
it 23
by 23
little 23
and 23
little 23
to 23
the 23
highest 23
point 23
which 23
the 23
mediocrity 23
of 23
my 23
talents 23
and 23
the 23
brief 23
duration 23
of 23
my 23
life 23
will 23
permit 23
me 23
to 23
reach 23
for 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
reaped 23
from 23
it 23
such 23
fruits 23
that 23
although 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
accustomed 23
to 23
think 23
lowly 23
enough 23
of 23
myself 23
and 23
although 23
when 23
i 23
look 23
with 23
the 23
eye 23
of 23
a 23
philosopher 23
at 23
the 23
varied 23
courses 23
and 23
pursuits 23
of 23
mankind 23
at 23
large 23
i 23
find 23
scarcely 23
one 23
which 23
does 23
not 23
appear 23
in 23
vain 23
and 23
useless 23
i 23
nevertheless 23
derive 23
the 23
highest 23
satisfaction 23
from 23
the 23
progress 23
i 23
conceive 23
myself 23
to 23
have 23
already 23
made 23
in 23
the 23
search 23
after 23
truth 23
and 23
cannot 23
help 23
entertaining 23
such 23
expectations 23
of 23
the 23
future 23
as 23
to 23
believe 23
that 23
if 23
among 23
the 23
occupations 23
of 23
men 23
as 23
men 23
there 23
is 23
any 23
one 23
really 23
excellent 23
and 23
important 23
it 23
is 23
that 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
chosen 23
after 23
all 23
it 23
is 23
possible 23
i 23
may 23
be 23
mistaken 23
and 23
it 23
is 23
but 23
a 23
little 23
copper 23
and 23
glass 23
perhaps 23
that 23
i 23
take 23
for 23
gold 23
and 23
diamonds 23
i 23
know 23
how 23
very 23
liable 23
we 23
are 23
to 23
delusion 23
in 23
what 23
relates 23
to 23
ourselves 23
and 23
also 23
how 23
much 23
the 23
judgments 23
of 23
our 23
friends 23
are 23
to 23
be 23
suspected 23
when 23
given 23
in 23
our 23
favor 23
but 23
i 23
shall 23
endeavor 23
in 23
this 23
discourse 23
to 23
describe 23
the 23
paths 23
i 23
have 23
followed 23
and 23
to 23
delineate 23
my 23
life 23
as 23
in 23
a 23
picture 23
in 23
order 23
that 23
each 23
one 23
may 23
also 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
judge 23
of 23
them 23
for 23
himself 23
and 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
general 23
opinion 23
entertained 23
of 23
them 23
as 23
gathered 23
from 23
current 23
report 23
i 23
myself 23
may 23
have 23
a 23
new 23
help 23
towards 23
instruction 23
to 23
be 23
added 23
to 23
those 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
in 23
the 23
habit 23
of 23
employing 23
my 23
present 23
design 23
then 23
is 23
not 23
to 23
teach 23
the 23
method 23
which 23
each 23
ought 23
to 23
follow 23
for 23
the 23
right 23
conduct 23
of 23
his 23
reason 23
but 23
solely 23
to 23
describe 23
the 23
way 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
endeavored 23
to 23
conduct 23
my 23
own 23
they 23
who 23
set 23
themselves 23
to 23
give 23
precepts 23
must 23
of 23
course 23
regard 23
themselves 23
as 23
possessed 23
of 23
greater 23
skill 23
than 23
those 23
to 23
whom 23
they 23
prescribe 23
and 23
if 23
they 23
err 23
in 23
the 23
slightest 23
particular 23
they 23
subject 23
themselves 23
to 23
censure 23
but 23
as 23
this 23
tract 23
is 23
put 23
forth 23
merely 23
as 23
a 23
history 23
or 23
if 23
you 23
will 23
as 23
a 23
tale 23
in 23
which 23
amid 23
some 23
examples 23
worthy 23
of 23
imitation 23
there 23
will 23
be 23
found 23
perhaps 23
as 23
many 23
more 23
which 23
it 23
were 23
advisable 23
not 23
to 23
follow 23
i 23
hope 23
it 23
will 23
prove 23
useful 23
to 23
some 23
without 23
being 23
hurtful 23
to 23
any 23
and 23
that 23
my 23
openness 23
will 23
find 23
some 23
favor 23
with 23
all 23
from 23
my 23
childhood 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
familiar 23
with 23
letters 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
was 23
given 23
to 23
believe 23
that 23
by 23
their 23
help 23
a 23
clear 23
and 23
certain 23
knowledge 23
of 23
all 23
that 23
is 23
useful 23
in 23
life 23
might 23
be 23
acquired 23
i 23
was 23
ardently 23
desirous 23
of 23
instruction 23
but 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
i 23
had 23
finished 23
the 23
entire 23
course 23
of 23
study 23
at 23
the 23
close 23
of 23
which 23
it 23
is 23
customary 23
to 23
be 23
admitted 23
into 23
the 23
order 23
of 23
the 23
learned 23
i 23
completely 23
changed 23
my 23
opinion 23
for 23
i 23
found 23
myself 23
involved 23
in 23
so 23
many 23
doubts 23
and 23
errors 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
convinced 23
i 23
had 23
advanced 23
no 23
farther 23
in 23
all 23
my 23
attempts 23
at 23
learning 23
than 23
the 23
discovery 23
at 23
every 23
turn 23
of 23
my 23
own 23
ignorance 23
and 23
yet 23
i 23
was 23
studying 23
in 23
one 23
of 23
the 23
most 23
celebrated 23
schools 23
in 23
europe 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
thought 23
there 23
must 23
be 23
learned 23
men 23
if 23
such 23
were 23
anywhere 23
to 23
be 23
found 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
taught 23
all 23
that 23
others 23
learned 23
there 23
and 23
not 23
contented 23
with 23
the 23
sciences 23
actually 23
taught 23
us 23
i 23
had 23
in 23
addition 23
read 23
all 23
the 23
books 23
that 23
had 23
fallen 23
into 23
my 23
hands 23
treating 23
of 23
such 23
branches 23
as 23
are 23
esteemed 23
the 23
most 23
curious 23
and 23
rare 23
i 23
knew 23
the 23
judgment 23
which 23
others 23
had 23
formed 23
of 23
me 23
and 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
find 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
considered 23
inferior 23
to 23
my 23
fellows 23
although 23
there 23
were 23
among 23
them 23
some 23
who 23
were 23
already 23
marked 23
out 23
to 23
fill 23
the 23
places 23
of 23
our 23
instructors 23
and 23
in 23
fine 23
our 23
age 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
as 23
flourishing 23
and 23
as 23
fertile 23
in 23
powerful 23
minds 23
as 23
any 23
preceding 23
one 23
i 23
was 23
thus 23
led 23
to 23
take 23
the 23
liberty 23
of 23
judging 23
of 23
all 23
other 23
men 23
by 23
myself 23
and 23
of 23
concluding 23
that 23
there 23
was 23
no 23
science 23
in 23
existence 23
that 23
was 23
of 23
such 23
a 23
nature 23
as 23
i 23
had 23
previously 23
been 23
given 23
to 23
believe 23
i 23
still 23
continued 23
however 23
to 23
hold 23
in 23
esteem 23
the 23
studies 23
of 23
the 23
schools 23
i 23
was 23
aware 23
that 23
the 23
languages 23
taught 23
in 23
them 23
are 23
necessary 23
to 23
the 23
understanding 23
of 23
the 23
writings 23
of 23
the 23
ancients 23
that 23
the 23
grace 23
of 23
fable 23
stirs 23
the 23
mind 23
that 23
the 23
memorable 23
deeds 23
of 23
history 23
elevate 23
it 23
and 23
if 23
read 23
with 23
discretion 23
aid 23
in 23
forming 23
the 23
judgment 23
that 23
the 23
perusal 23
of 23
all 23
excellent 23
books 23
is 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
to 23
interview 23
with 23
the 23
noblest 23
men 23
of 23
past 23
ages 23
who 23
have 23
written 23
them 23
and 23
even 23
a 23
studied 23
interview 23
in 23
which 23
are 23
discovered 23
to 23
us 23
only 23
their 23
choicest 23
thoughts 23
that 23
eloquence 23
has 23
incomparable 23
force 23
and 23
beauty 23
that 23
poesy 23
has 23
its 23
ravishing 23
graces 23
and 23
delights 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
mathematics 23
there 23
are 23
many 23
refined 23
discoveries 23
eminently 23
suited 23
to 23
gratify 23
the 23
inquisitive 23

as 23

numerous 23
highly 23
useful 23
precepts 23
and 23
exhortations 23
to 23
virtue 23
are 23
contained 23
in 23
treatises 23
on 23
morals 23
that 23
theology 23
points 23
out 23
the 23

with 23
an 23
appearance 23
of 23

on 23
all 23

in 23
fine 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
useful 23
to 23
bestow 23
some 23
attention 23
upon 23
all 23
even 23
upon 23
those 23
abounding 23
the 23
most 23
in 23
superstition 23
and 23
error 23
that 23
we 23
may 23
be 23
in 23
a 23
position 23
to 23
determine 23
their 23
real 23
value 23
and 23
guard 23
against 23
being 23
deceived 23
but 23
i 23
believed 23
that 23
i 23
had 23
already 23
given 23
sufficient 23
time 23
to 23
languages 23
and 23
likewise 23
to 23
the 23
reading 23
of 23
the 23
writings 23
of 23
the 23
ancients 23
to 23
their 23
histories 23
and 23
fables 23
for 23
to 23
hold 23
converse 23
with 23
those 23
of 23
other 23
ages 23
and 23
to 23
travel 23
are 23
almost 23
the 23
same 23
thing 23
it 23
is 23
useful 23
to 23
know 23
something 23
of 23
the 23
manners 23
of 23
different 23
nations 23
that 23
we 23
may 23
be 23
enabled 23
to 23
form 23
a 23
more 23
correct 23
judgment 23
regarding 23
our 23
own 23
and 23
be 23
prevented 23
from 23
thinking 23
that 23
everything 23
contrary 23
to 23
our 23
customs 23
is 23
ridiculous 23
and 23
irrational 23
a 23
conclusion 23
usually 23
come 23
to 23
by 23
those 23
whose 23
experience 23
has 23
been 23
limited 23
to 23
their 23
own 23
country 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
when 23
too 23
much 23
time 23
is 23
occupied 23
in 23
traveling 23
we 23
become 23
strangers 23
to 23
our 23
native 23
country 23
and 23
the 23
over 23
curious 23
in 23
the 23
customs 23
of 23
the 23
past 23
are 23
generally 23
ignorant 23
of 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
present 23
besides 23
fictitious 23
narratives 23
lead 23
us 23
to 23
imagine 23
the 23
possibility 23
of 23
many 23
events 23
that 23
are 23
impossible 23
and 23
even 23
the 23
most 23
faithful 23
histories 23
if 23
they 23
do 23
not 23
wholly 23
misrepresent 23
matters 23
or 23
exaggerate 23
their 23
importance 23
to 23
render 23
the 23
account 23
of 23
them 23
more 23
worthy 23
of 23
perusal 23
omit 23
at 23
least 23
almost 23
always 23
the 23
meanest 23
and 23
least 23
striking 23
of 23
the 23
attendant 23
circumstances 23
hence 23
it 23
happens 23
that 23
the 23
remainder 23
does 23
not 23
represent 23
the 23
truth 23
and 23
that 23
such 23
as 23
regulate 23
their 23
conduct 23
by 23
examples 23
drawn 23
from 23
this 23
source 23
are 23
apt 23
to 23
fall 23
into 23
the 23
extravagances 23
of 23
the 23
knighterrants 23
of 23
romance 23
and 23
to 23
entertain 23
projects 23
that 23
exceed 23
their 23
powers 23
i 23
esteemed 23
eloquence 23
highly 23
and 23
was 23
in 23
raptures 23
with 23
poesy 23
but 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
both 23
were 23
gifts 23
of 23
nature 23
rather 23
than 23
fruits 23
of 23
study 23
those 23
in 23
whom 23
the 23
faculty 23
of 23
reason 23
is 23
predominant 23
and 23
who 23
most 23
skillfully 23
dispose 23
their 23
thoughts 23
with 23
a 23
view 23
to 23
render 23
them 23
clear 23
and 23
intelligible 23
are 23
always 23
the 23
best 23
able 23
to 23
persuade 23
others 23
of 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
what 23
they 23
lay 23
down 23
though 23
they 23
should 23
speak 23
only 23
in 23
the 23
language 23
of 23
lower 23
brittany 23
and 23
be 23
wholly 23
ignorant 23
of 23
the 23
rules 23
of 23
rhetoric 23
and 23
those 23
whose 23
minds 23
are 23
stored 23
with 23
the 23
most 23
agreeable 23
fancies 23
and 23
who 23
can 23
give 23
expression 23
to 23
them 23
with 23
the 23
greatest 23
embellishment 23
and 23
harmony 23
are 23
still 23
the 23
best 23
poets 23
though 23
unacquainted 23
with 23
the 23
art 23
of 23
poetry 23
i 23
was 23
especially 23
delighted 23
with 23
the 23
mathematics 23
on 23
account 23
of 23
the 23
certitude 23
and 23
evidence 23
of 23
their 23
reasonings 23
but 23
i 23
had 23
not 23
as 23
yet 23
a 23
precise 23
knowledge 23
of 23
their 23
true 23
use 23
and 23
thinking 23
that 23
they 23
but 23
contributed 23
to 23
the 23
advancement 23
of 23
the 23
mechanical 23
arts 23
i 23
was 23
astonished 23
that 23
foundations 23
so 23
strong 23
and 23
solid 23
should 23
have 23
had 23
no 23
loftier 23
superstructure 23
reared 23
on 23
them 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
i 23
compared 23
the 23
disquisitions 23
of 23
the 23
ancient 23
moralists 23
to 23
very 23
towering 23
and 23
magnificent 23
palaces 23
with 23
no 23
better 23
foundation 23
than 23
sand 23
and 23
mud 23
they 23
laud 23
the 23
virtues 23
very 23
highly 23
and 23
exhibit 23
them 23
as 23
estimable 23
far 23
above 23
anything 23
on 23
earth 23
but 23
they 23
give 23
us 23
no 23
adequate 23
criterion 23
of 23
virtue 23
and 23
frequently 23
that 23
which 23
they 23
designate 23
with 23
so 23
fine 23
a 23
name 23
is 23
but 23
apathy 23
or 23
pride 23
or 23
despair 23
or 23
parricide 23
i 23
revered 23
our 23
theology 23
and 23
aspired 23
as 23
much 23
as 23
any 23
one 23
to 23
reach 23
heaven 23
but 23
being 23
given 23
assuredly 23
to 23
understand 23
that 23
the 23
way 23
is 23
not 23
less 23
open 23
to 23
the 23
most 23
ignorant 23
than 23
to 23
the 23
most 23
learned 23
and 23
that 23
the 23
revealed 23
truths 23
which 23
lead 23
to 23
heaven 23
are 23
above 23
our 23
comprehension 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
presume 23
to 23
subject 23
them 23
to 23
the 23
impotency 23
of 23
my 23
reason 23
and 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
competently 23
to 23
undertake 23
their 23
examination 23
there 23
was 23
need 23
of 23
some 23
special 23
help 23
from 23
heaven 23
and 23
of 23
being 23
more 23
than 23
man 23
of 23
philosophy 23
i 23
will 23
say 23
nothing 23
except 23
that 23
when 23
i 23
saw 23
that 23
it 23
had 23
been 23
cultivated 23
for 23
many 23
ages 23
by 23
the 23
most 23
distinguished 23
men 23
and 23
that 23
yet 23
there 23
is 23
not 23
a 23
single 23
matter 23
within 23
its 23
sphere 23
which 23
is 23
not 23
still 23
in 23
dispute 23
and 23
nothing 23
therefore 23
which 23
is 23
above 23
doubt 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
presume 23
to 23
anticipate 23
that 23
my 23
success 23
would 23
be 23
greater 23
in 23
it 23
than 23
that 23
of 23
others 23
and 23
further 23
when 23
i 23
considered 23
the 23
number 23
of 23
conflicting 23
opinions 23
touching 23
a 23
single 23
matter 23
that 23
may 23
be 23
upheld 23
by 23
learned 23
men 23
while 23
there 23
can 23
be 23
but 23
one 23
true 23
i 23
reckoned 23
as 23
wellnigh 23
false 23
all 23
that 23
was 23
only 23
probable 23
as 23
to 23
the 23
other 23
sciences 23
inasmuch 23
as 23
these 23
borrow 23
their 23
principles 23
from 23
philosophy 23
i 23
judged 23
that 23
no 23
solid 23
superstructures 23
could 23
be 23
reared 23
on 23
foundations 23
so 23
infirm 23
and 23
neither 23
the 23
honor 23
nor 23
the 23
gain 23
held 23
out 23
by 23
them 23
was 23
sufficient 23
to 23
determine 23
me 23
to 23
their 23
cultivation 23
for 23
i 23
was 23
not 23
thank 23
heaven 23
in 23
a 23
condition 23
which 23
compelled 23
me 23
to 23
make 23
merchandise 23
of 23
science 23
for 23
the 23
bettering 23
of 23
my 23
fortune 23
and 23
though 23
i 23
might 23
not 23
profess 23
to 23
scorn 23
glory 23
as 23
a 23
cynic 23
i 23
yet 23
made 23
very 23
slight 23
account 23
of 23
that 23
honor 23
which 23
i 23
hoped 23
to 23
acquire 23
only 23
through 23
fictitious 23
titles 23
and 23
in 23
fine 23
of 23
false 23
sciences 23
i 23
thought 23
i 23
knew 23
the 23
worth 23
sufficiently 23
to 23
escape 23
being 23
deceived 23
by 23
the 23
professions 23
of 23
an 23
alchemist 23
the 23
predictions 23
of 23
an 23
astrologer 23
the 23
impostures 23
of 23
a 23
magician 23
or 23
by 23
the 23
artifices 23
and 23
boasting 23
of 23
any 23
of 23
those 23
who 23
profess 23
to 23
know 23
things 23
of 23
which 23
they 23
are 23
ignorant 23
for 23
these 23
reasons 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
my 23
age 23
permitted 23
me 23
to 23
pass 23
from 23
under 23
the 23
control 23
of 23
my 23
instructors 23
i 23
entirely 23
abandoned 23
the 23
study 23
of 23
letters 23
and 23
resolved 23
no 23
longer 23
to 23
seek 23
any 23
other 23
science 23
than 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
myself 23
or 23
of 23
the 23
great 23
book 23
of 23
the 23
world 23
i 23
spent 23
the 23
remainder 23
of 23
my 23
youth 23
in 23
traveling 23
in 23
visiting 23
courts 23
and 23
armies 23
in 23
holding 23
intercourse 23
with 23
men 23
of 23
different 23
dispositions 23
and 23
ranks 23
in 23
collecting 23
varied 23
experience 23
in 23
proving 23
myself 23
in 23
the 23
different 23
situations 23
into 23
which 23
fortune 23
threw 23
me 23
and 23
above 23
all 23
in 23
making 23
such 23
reflection 23
on 23
the 23
matter 23
of 23
my 23
experience 23
as 23
to 23
secure 23
my 23
improvement 23
for 23
it 23
occurred 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
find 23
much 23
more 23
truth 23
in 23
the 23
reasonings 23
of 23
each 23
individual 23
with 23
reference 23
to 23
the 23
affairs 23
in 23
which 23
he 23
is 23
personally 23
interested 23
and 23
the 23
issue 23
of 23
which 23
must 23
presently 23
punish 23
him 23
if 23
he 23
has 23
judged 23
amiss 23
than 23
in 23
those 23
conducted 23
by 23
a 23
man 23
of 23
letters 23
in 23
his 23
study 23
regarding 23
speculative 23
matters 23
that 23
are 23
of 23
no 23
practical 23
moment 23
and 23
followed 23
by 23
no 23
consequences 23
to 23
himself 23
farther 23
perhaps 23
than 23
that 23
they 23
foster 23
his 23
vanity 23
the 23
better 23
the 23
more 23
remote 23
they 23
are 23
from 23
common 23
sense 23
requiring 23
as 23
they 23
must 23
in 23
this 23
case 23
the 23
exercise 23
of 23
greater 23
ingenuity 23
and 23
art 23
to 23
render 23
them 23
probable 23
in 23
addition 23
i 23
had 23
always 23
a 23
most 23
earnest 23
desire 23
to 23
know 23
how 23
to 23
distinguish 23
the 23
true 23
from 23
the 23
false 23
in 23
order 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
be 23
able 23
clearly 23
to 23
discriminate 23
the 23
right 23
path 23
in 23
life 23
and 23
proceed 23
in 23
it 23
with 23
confidence 23
it 23
is 23
true 23
that 23
while 23
busied 23
only 23
in 23
considering 23
the 23
manners 23
of 23
other 23
men 23
i 23
found 23
here 23
too 23
scarce 23
any 23
ground 23
for 23
settled 23
conviction 23
and 23
remarked 23
hardly 23
less 23
contradiction 23
among 23
them 23
than 23
in 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
the 23
philosophers 23
so 23
that 23
the 23
greatest 23
advantage 23
i 23
derived 23
from 23
the 23
study 23
consisted 23
in 23
this 23
that 23
observing 23
many 23
things 23
which 23
however 23
extravagant 23
and 23
ridiculous 23
to 23
our 23
apprehension 23
are 23
yet 23
by 23
common 23
consent 23
received 23
and 23
approved 23
by 23
other 23
great 23
nations 23
i 23
learned 23
to 23
entertain 23
too 23
decided 23
a 23
belief 23
in 23
regard 23
to 23
nothing 23
of 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
persuaded 23
merely 23
by 23
example 23
and 23
custom 23
and 23
thus 23
i 23
gradually 23
extricated 23
myself 23
from 23
many 23
errors 23
powerful 23
enough 23
to 23
darken 23
our 23
natural 23
intelligence 23
and 23
incapacitate 23
us 23
in 23
great 23
measure 23
from 23
listening 23
to 23
reason 23
but 23
after 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
occupied 23
several 23
years 23
in 23
thus 23
studying 23
the 23
book 23
of 23
the 23
world 23
and 23
in 23
essaying 23
to 23
gather 23
some 23
experience 23
i 23
at 23
length 23
resolved 23
to 23
make 23
myself 23
an 23
object 23
of 23
study 23
and 23
to 23
employ 23
all 23
the 23
powers 23
of 23
my 23
mind 23
in 23
choosing 23
the 23
paths 23
i 23
ought 23
to 23
follow 23
an 23
undertaking 23
which 23
was 23
accompanied 23
with 23
greater 23
success 23
than 23
it 23
would 23
have 23
been 23
had 23
i 23
never 23
quitted 23
my 23
country 23
or 23
my 23
books 23
part 23
ii 23
i 23
was 23
then 23
in 23
germany 23
attracted 23
thither 23
by 23
the 23
wars 23
in 23
that 23
country 23
which 23
have 23
not 23
yet 23
been 23
brought 23
to 23
a 23
termination 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
was 23
returning 23
to 23
the 23
army 23
from 23
the 23
coronation 23
of 23
the 23
emperor 23
the 23
setting 23
in 23
of 23
winter 23
arrested 23
me 23
in 23
a 23
locality 23
where 23
as 23
i 23
found 23
no 23
society 23
to 23
interest 23
me 23
and 23
was 23
besides 23
fortunately 23
undisturbed 23
by 23
any 23
cares 23
or 23
passions 23
i 23
remained 23
the 23
whole 23
day 23
in 23
seclusion 23
with 23
full 23
opportunity 23
to 23
occupy 23
my 23
attention 23
with 23
my 23
own 23
thoughts 23
of 23
these 23
one 23
of 23
the 23
very 23
first 23
that 23
occurred 23
to 23
me 23
was 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
seldom 23
so 23
much 23
perfection 23
in 23
works 23
composed 23
of 23
many 23
separate 23
parts 23
upon 23
which 23
different 23
hands 23
had 23
been 23
employed 23
as 23
in 23
those 23
completed 23
by 23
a 23
single 23
master 23
thus 23
it 23
is 23
observable 23
that 23
the 23
buildings 23
which 23
a 23
single 23
architect 23
has 23
planned 23
and 23
executed 23
are 23
generally 23
more 23
elegant 23
and 23
commodious 23
than 23
those 23
which 23
several 23
have 23
attempted 23
to 23
improve 23
by 23
making 23
old 23
walls 23
serve 23
for 23
purposes 23
for 23
which 23
they 23
were 23
not 23
originally 23
built 23
thus 23
also 23
those 23
ancient 23
cities 23
which 23
from 23
being 23
at 23
first 23
only 23
villages 23
have 23
become 23
in 23
course 23
of 23
time 23
large 23
towns 23
are 23
usually 23
but 23
ill 23
laid 23
out 23
compared 23
with 23
the 23
regularity 23
constructed 23
towns 23
which 23
a 23
professional 23
architect 23
has 23
freely 23
planned 23
on 23
an 23
open 23
plain 23
so 23
that 23
although 23
the 23
several 23
buildings 23
of 23
the 23
former 23
may 23
often 23
equal 23
or 23
surpass 23
in 23
beauty 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
latter 23
yet 23
when 23
one 23
observes 23
their 23
indiscriminate 23
juxtaposition 23
there 23
a 23
large 23
one 23
and 23
here 23
a 23
small 23
and 23
the 23
consequent 23
crookedness 23
and 23
irregularity 23
of 23
the 23
streets 23
one 23
is 23
disposed 23
to 23
allege 23
that 23
chance 23
rather 23
than 23
any 23
human 23
will 23
guided 23
by 23
reason 23
must 23
have 23
led 23
to 23
such 23
an 23
arrangement 23
and 23
if 23
we 23
consider 23
that 23
nevertheless 23
there 23
have 23
been 23
at 23
all 23
times 23
certain 23
officers 23
whose 23
duty 23
it 23
was 23
to 23
see 23
that 23
private 23
buildings 23
contributed 23
to 23
public 23
ornament 23
the 23
difficulty 23
of 23
reaching 23
high 23
perfection 23
with 23
but 23
the 23
materials 23
of 23
others 23
to 23
operate 23
on 23
will 23
be 23
readily 23
acknowledged 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
i 23
fancied 23
that 23
those 23
nations 23
which 23
starting 23
from 23
a 23
semibarbarous 23
state 23
and 23
advancing 23
to 23
civilization 23
by 23
slow 23
degrees 23
have 23
had 23
their 23
laws 23
successively 23
determined 23
and 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
forced 23
upon 23
them 23
simply 23
by 23
experience 23
of 23
the 23
hurtfulness 23
of 23
particular 23
crimes 23
and 23
disputes 23
would 23
by 23
this 23
process 23
come 23
to 23
be 23
possessed 23
of 23
less 23
perfect 23
institutions 23
than 23
those 23
which 23
from 23
the 23
commencement 23
of 23
their 23
association 23
as 23
communities 23
have 23
followed 23
the 23
appointments 23
of 23
some 23
wise 23
legislator 23
it 23
is 23
thus 23
quite 23
certain 23
that 23
the 23
constitution 23
of 23
the 23
true 23
religion 23
the 23
ordinances 23
of 23
which 23
are 23
derived 23
from 23
god 23
must 23
be 23
incomparably 23
superior 23
to 23
that 23
of 23
every 23
other 23
and 23
to 23
speak 23
of 23
human 23
affairs 23
i 23
believe 23
that 23
the 23
preeminence 23
of 23
sparta 23
was 23
due 23
not 23
to 23
the 23
goodness 23
of 23
each 23
of 23
its 23
laws 23
in 23
particular 23
for 23
many 23
of 23
these 23
were 23
very 23
strange 23
and 23
even 23
opposed 23
to 23
good 23
morals 23
but 23
to 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
originated 23
by 23
a 23
single 23
individual 23
they 23
all 23
tended 23
to 23
a 23
single 23
end 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
the 23
sciences 23
contained 23
in 23
books 23
such 23
of 23
them 23
at 23
least 23
as 23
are 23
made 23
up 23
of 23
probable 23
reasonings 23
without 23
demonstrations 23
composed 23
as 23
they 23
are 23
of 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
many 23
different 23
individuals 23
massed 23
together 23
are 23
farther 23
removed 23
from 23
truth 23
than 23
the 23
simple 23
inferences 23
which 23
a 23
man 23
of 23
good 23
sense 23
using 23
his 23
natural 23
and 23
unprejudiced 23
judgment 23
draws 23
respecting 23
the 23
matters 23
of 23
his 23
experience 23
and 23
because 23
we 23
have 23
all 23
to 23
pass 23
through 23
a 23
state 23
of 23
infancy 23
to 23
manhood 23
and 23
have 23
been 23
of 23
necessity 23
for 23
a 23
length 23
of 23
time 23
governed 23
by 23
our 23
desires 23
and 23
preceptors 23
whose 23
dictates 23
were 23
frequently 23
conflicting 23
while 23
neither 23
perhaps 23
always 23
counseled 23
us 23
for 23
the 23
best 23
i 23
farther 23
concluded 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
almost 23
impossible 23
that 23
our 23
judgments 23
can 23
be 23
so 23
correct 23
or 23
solid 23
as 23
they 23
would 23
have 23
been 23
had 23
our 23
reason 23
been 23
mature 23
from 23
the 23
moment 23
of 23
our 23
birth 23
and 23
had 23
we 23
always 23
been 23
guided 23
by 23
it 23
alone 23
it 23
is 23
true 23
however 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
customary 23
to 23
pull 23
down 23
all 23
the 23
houses 23
of 23
a 23
town 23
with 23
the 23
single 23
design 23
of 23
rebuilding 23
them 23
differently 23
and 23
thereby 23
rendering 23
the 23
streets 23
more 23
handsome 23
but 23
it 23
often 23
happens 23
that 23
a 23
private 23
individual 23
takes 23
down 23
his 23
own 23
with 23
the 23
view 23
of 23
erecting 23
it 23
anew 23
and 23
that 23
people 23
are 23
even 23
sometimes 23
constrained 23
to 23
this 23
when 23
their 23
houses 23
are 23
in 23
danger 23
of 23
falling 23
from 23
age 23
or 23
when 23
the 23
foundations 23
are 23
insecure 23
with 23
this 23
before 23
me 23
by 23
way 23
of 23
example 23
i 23
was 23
persuaded 23
that 23
it 23
would 23
indeed 23
be 23
preposterous 23
for 23
a 23
private 23
individual 23
to 23
think 23
of 23
reforming 23
a 23
state 23
by 23
fundamentally 23
changing 23
it 23
throughout 23
and 23
overturning 23
it 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
set 23
it 23
up 23
amended 23
and 23
the 23
same 23
i 23
thought 23
was 23
true 23
of 23
any 23
similar 23
project 23
for 23
reforming 23
the 23
body 23
of 23
the 23
sciences 23
or 23
the 23
order 23
of 23
teaching 23
them 23
established 23
in 23
the 23
schools 23
but 23
as 23
for 23
the 23
opinions 23
which 23
up 23
to 23
that 23
time 23
i 23
had 23
embraced 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
do 23
better 23
than 23
resolve 23
at 23
once 23
to 23
sweep 23
them 23
wholly 23
away 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
afterwards 23
be 23
in 23
a 23
position 23
to 23
admit 23
either 23
others 23
more 23
correct 23
or 23
even 23
perhaps 23
the 23
same 23
when 23
they 23
had 23
undergone 23
the 23
scrutiny 23
of 23
reason 23
i 23
firmly 23
believed 23
that 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
i 23
should 23
much 23
better 23
succeed 23
in 23
the 23
conduct 23
of 23
my 23
life 23
than 23
if 23
i 23
built 23
only 23
upon 23
old 23
foundations 23
and 23
leaned 23
upon 23
principles 23
which 23
in 23
my 23
youth 23
i 23
had 23
taken 23
upon 23
trust 23
for 23
although 23
i 23
recognized 23
various 23
difficulties 23
in 23
this 23
undertaking 23
these 23
were 23
not 23
however 23
without 23
remedy 23
nor 23
once 23
to 23
be 23
compared 23
with 23
such 23
as 23
attend 23
the 23
slightest 23
reformation 23
in 23
public 23
affairs 23
large 23
bodies 23
if 23
once 23
overthrown 23
are 23
with 23
great 23
difficulty 23
set 23
up 23
again 23
or 23
even 23
kept 23
erect 23
when 23
once 23
seriously 23
shaken 23
and 23
the 23
fall 23
of 23
such 23
is 23
always 23
disastrous 23
then 23
if 23
there 23
are 23
any 23
imperfections 23
in 23
the 23
constitutions 23
of 23
states 23
and 23
that 23
many 23
such 23
exist 23
the 23
diversity 23
of 23
constitutions 23
is 23
alone 23
sufficient 23
to 23
assure 23
us 23
custom 23
has 23
without 23
doubt 23
materially 23
smoothed 23
their 23
inconveniences 23
and 23
has 23
even 23
managed 23
to 23
steer 23
altogether 23
clear 23
of 23
or 23
insensibly 23
corrected 23
a 23
number 23
which 23
sagacity 23
could 23
not 23
have 23
provided 23
against 23
with 23
equal 23
effect 23
and 23
in 23
fine 23
the 23
defects 23
are 23
almost 23
always 23
more 23
tolerable 23
than 23
the 23
change 23
necessary 23
for 23
their 23
removal 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
manner 23
that 23
highways 23
which 23
wind 23
among 23
mountains 23
by 23
being 23
much 23
frequented 23
become 23
gradually 23
so 23
smooth 23
and 23
commodious 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
much 23
better 23
to 23
follow 23
them 23
than 23
to 23
seek 23
a 23
straighter 23
path 23
by 23
climbing 23
over 23
the 23
tops 23
of 23
rocks 23
and 23
descending 23
to 23
the 23
bottoms 23
of 23
precipices 23
hence 23
it 23
is 23
that 23
i 23
cannot 23
in 23
any 23
degree 23
approve 23
of 23
those 23
restless 23
and 23
busy 23
meddlers 23
who 23
called 23
neither 23
by 23
birth 23
nor 23
fortune 23
to 23
take 23
part 23
in 23
the 23
management 23
of 23
public 23
affairs 23
are 23
yet 23
always 23
projecting 23
reforms 23
and 23
if 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
this 23
tract 23
contained 23
aught 23
which 23
might 23
justify 23
the 23
suspicion 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
a 23
victim 23
of 23
such 23
folly 23
i 23
would 23
by 23
no 23
means 23
permit 23
its 23
publication 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
contemplated 23
anything 23
higher 23
than 23
the 23
reformation 23
of 23
my 23
own 23
opinions 23
and 23
basing 23
them 23
on 23
a 23
foundation 23
wholly 23
my 23
own 23
and 23
although 23
my 23
own 23
satisfaction 23
with 23
my 23
work 23
has 23
led 23
me 23
to 23
present 23
here 23
a 23
draft 23
of 23
it 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
by 23
any 23
means 23
therefore 23
recommend 23
to 23
every 23
one 23
else 23
to 23
make 23
a 23
similar 23
attempt 23
those 23
whom 23
god 23
has 23
endowed 23
with 23
a 23
larger 23
measure 23
of 23
genius 23
will 23
entertain 23
perhaps 23
designs 23
still 23
more 23
exalted 23
but 23
for 23
the 23
many 23
i 23
am 23
much 23
afraid 23
lest 23
even 23
the 23
present 23
undertaking 23
be 23
more 23
than 23
they 23
can 23
safely 23
venture 23
to 23
imitate 23
the 23
single 23
design 23
to 23
strip 23
ones 23
self 23
of 23
all 23
past 23
beliefs 23
is 23
one 23
that 23
ought 23
not 23
to 23
be 23
taken 23
by 23
every 23
one 23
the 23
majority 23
of 23
men 23
is 23
composed 23
of 23
two 23
classes 23
for 23
neither 23
of 23
which 23
would 23
this 23
be 23
at 23
all 23
a 23
befitting 23
resolution 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
of 23
those 23
who 23
with 23
more 23
than 23
a 23
due 23
confidence 23
in 23
their 23
own 23
powers 23
are 23
precipitate 23
in 23
their 23
judgments 23
and 23
want 23
the 23
patience 23
requisite 23
for 23
orderly 23
and 23
circumspect 23
thinking 23
whence 23
it 23
happens 23
that 23
if 23
men 23
of 23
this 23
class 23
once 23
take 23
the 23
liberty 23
to 23
doubt 23
of 23
their 23
accustomed 23
opinions 23
and 23
quit 23
the 23
beaten 23
highway 23
they 23
will 23
never 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
thread 23
the 23
byway 23
that 23
would 23
lead 23
them 23
by 23
a 23
shorter 23
course 23
and 23
will 23
lose 23
themselves 23
and 23
continue 23
to 23
wander 23
for 23
life 23
in 23
the 23
second 23
place 23
of 23
those 23
who 23
possessed 23
of 23
sufficient 23
sense 23
or 23
modesty 23
to 23
determine 23
that 23
there 23
are 23
others 23
who 23
excel 23
them 23
in 23
the 23
power 23
of 23
discriminating 23
between 23
truth 23
and 23
error 23
and 23
by 23
whom 23
they 23
may 23
be 23
instructed 23
ought 23
rather 23
to 23
content 23
themselves 23
with 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
such 23
than 23
trust 23
for 23
more 23
correct 23
to 23
their 23
own 23
reason 23
for 23
my 23
own 23
part 23
i 23
should 23
doubtless 23
have 23
belonged 23
to 23
the 23
latter 23
class 23
had 23
i 23
received 23
instruction 23
from 23
but 23
one 23
master 23
or 23
had 23
i 23
never 23
known 23
the 23
diversities 23
of 23
opinion 23
that 23
from 23
time 23
immemorial 23
have 23
prevailed 23
among 23
men 23
of 23
the 23
greatest 23
learning 23
but 23
i 23
had 23
become 23
aware 23
even 23
so 23
early 23
as 23
during 23
my 23
college 23
life 23
that 23
no 23
opinion 23
however 23
absurd 23
and 23
incredible 23
can 23
be 23
imagined 23
which 23
has 23
not 23
been 23
maintained 23
by 23
some 23
on 23
of 23
the 23
philosophers 23
and 23
afterwards 23
in 23
the 23
course 23
of 23
my 23
travels 23
i 23
remarked 23
that 23
all 23
those 23
whose 23
opinions 23
are 23
decidedly 23
repugnant 23
to 23
ours 23
are 23
not 23
in 23
that 23
account 23
barbarians 23
and 23
savages 23
but 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
that 23
many 23
of 23
these 23
nations 23
make 23
an 23
equally 23
good 23
if 23
not 23
better 23
use 23
of 23
their 23
reason 23
than 23
we 23
do 23
i 23
took 23
into 23
account 23
also 23
the 23
very 23
different 23
character 23
which 23
a 23
person 23
brought 23
up 23
from 23
infancy 23
in 23
france 23
or 23
germany 23
exhibits 23
from 23
that 23
which 23
with 23
the 23
same 23
mind 23
originally 23
this 23
individual 23
would 23
have 23
possessed 23
had 23
he 23
lived 23
always 23
among 23
the 23
chinese 23
or 23
with 23
savages 23
and 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
in 23
dress 23
itself 23
the 23
fashion 23
which 23
pleased 23
us 23
ten 23
years 23
ago 23
and 23
which 23
may 23
again 23
perhaps 23
be 23
received 23
into 23
favor 23
before 23
ten 23
years 23
have 23
gone 23
appears 23
to 23
us 23
at 23
this 23
moment 23
extravagant 23
and 23
ridiculous 23
i 23
was 23
thus 23
led 23
to 23
infer 23
that 23
the 23
ground 23
of 23
our 23
opinions 23
is 23
far 23
more 23
custom 23
and 23
example 23
than 23
any 23
certain 23
knowledge 23
and 23
finally 23
although 23
such 23
be 23
the 23
ground 23
of 23
our 23
opinions 23
i 23
remarked 23
that 23
a 23
plurality 23
of 23
suffrages 23
is 23
no 23
guarantee 23
of 23
truth 23
where 23
it 23
is 23
at 23
all 23
of 23
difficult 23
discovery 23
as 23
in 23
such 23
cases 23
it 23
is 23
much 23
more 23
likely 23
that 23
it 23
will 23
be 23
found 23
by 23
one 23
than 23
by 23
many 23
i 23
could 23
however 23
select 23
from 23
the 23
crowd 23
no 23
one 23
whose 23
opinions 23
seemed 23
worthy 23
of 23
preference 23
and 23
thus 23
i 23
found 23
myself 23
constrained 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
to 23
use 23
my 23
own 23
reason 23
in 23
the 23
conduct 23
of 23
my 23
life 23
but 23
like 23
one 23
walking 23
alone 23
and 23
in 23
the 23
dark 23
i 23
resolved 23
to 23
proceed 23
so 23
slowly 23
and 23
with 23
such 23
circumspection 23
that 23
if 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
advance 23
far 23
i 23
would 23
at 23
least 23
guard 23
against 23
falling 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
even 23
choose 23
to 23
dismiss 23
summarily 23
any 23
of 23
the 23
opinions 23
that 23
had 23
crept 23
into 23
my 23
belief 23
without 23
having 23
been 23
introduced 23
by 23
reason 23
but 23
first 23
of 23
all 23
took 23
sufficient 23
time 23
carefully 23
to 23
satisfy 23
myself 23
of 23
the 23
general 23
nature 23
of 23
the 23
task 23
i 23
was 23
setting 23
myself 23
and 23
ascertain 23
the 23
true 23
method 23
by 23
which 23
to 23
arrive 23
at 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
whatever 23
lay 23
within 23
the 23
compass 23
of 23
my 23
powers 23
among 23
the 23
branches 23
of 23
philosophy 23
i 23
had 23
at 23
an 23
earlier 23
period 23
given 23
some 23
attention 23
to 23
logic 23
and 23
among 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
mathematics 23
to 23
geometrical 23
analysis 23
and 23
algebra 23
three 23
arts 23
or 23
sciences 23
which 23
ought 23
as 23
i 23
conceived 23
to 23
contribute 23
something 23
to 23
my 23
design 23
but 23
on 23
examination 23
i 23
found 23
that 23
as 23
for 23
logic 23
its 23
syllogisms 23
and 23
the 23
majority 23
of 23
its 23
other 23
precepts 23
are 23
of 23
avail 23
rather 23
in 23
the 23
communication 23
of 23
what 23
we 23
already 23
know 23
or 23
even 23
as 23
the 23
art 23
of 23
lully 23
in 23
speaking 23
without 23
judgment 23
of 23
things 23
of 23
which 23
we 23
are 23
ignorant 23
than 23
in 23
the 23
investigation 23
of 23
the 23
unknown 23
and 23
although 23
this 23
science 23
contains 23
indeed 23
a 23
number 23
of 23
correct 23
and 23
very 23
excellent 23
precepts 23
there 23
are 23
nevertheless 23
so 23
many 23
others 23
and 23
these 23
either 23
injurious 23
or 23
superfluous 23
mingled 23
with 23
the 23
former 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
almost 23
quite 23
as 23
difficult 23
to 23
effect 23
a 23
severance 23
of 23
the 23
true 23
from 23
the 23
false 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
to 23
extract 23
a 23
diana 23
or 23
a 23
minerva 23
from 23
a 23
rough 23
block 23
of 23
marble 23
then 23
as 23
to 23
the 23
analysis 23
of 23
the 23
ancients 23
and 23
the 23
algebra 23
of 23
the 23
moderns 23
besides 23
that 23
they 23
embrace 23
only 23
matters 23
highly 23
abstract 23
and 23
to 23
appearance 23
of 23
no 23
use 23
the 23
former 23
is 23
so 23
exclusively 23
restricted 23
to 23
the 23
consideration 23
of 23
figures 23
that 23
it 23
can 23
exercise 23
the 23
understanding 23
only 23
on 23
condition 23
of 23
greatly 23
fatiguing 23
the 23
imagination 23
and 23
in 23
the 23
latter 23
there 23
is 23
so 23
complete 23
a 23
subjection 23
to 23
certain 23
rules 23
and 23
formulas 23
that 23
there 23
results 23
an 23
art 23
full 23
of 23
confusion 23
and 23
obscurity 23
calculated 23
to 23
embarrass 23
instead 23
of 23
a 23
science 23
fitted 23
to 23
cultivate 23
the 23
mind 23
by 23
these 23
considerations 23
i 23
was 23
induced 23
to 23
seek 23
some 23
other 23
method 23
which 23
would 23
comprise 23
the 23
advantages 23
of 23
the 23
three 23
and 23
be 23
exempt 23
from 23
their 23
defects 23
and 23
as 23
a 23
multitude 23
of 23
laws 23
often 23
only 23
hampers 23
justice 23
so 23
that 23
a 23
state 23
is 23
best 23
governed 23
when 23
with 23
few 23
laws 23
these 23
are 23
rigidly 23
administered 23
in 23
like 23
manner 23
instead 23
of 23
the 23
great 23
number 23
of 23
precepts 23
of 23
which 23
logic 23
is 23
composed 23
i 23
believed 23
that 23
the 23
four 23
following 23
would 23
prove 23
perfectly 23
sufficient 23
for 23
me 23
provided 23
i 23
took 23
the 23
firm 23
and 23
unwavering 23
resolution 23
never 23
in 23
a 23
single 23
instance 23
to 23
fail 23
in 23
observing 23
them 23
the 23
first 23
was 23
never 23
to 23
accept 23
anything 23
for 23
true 23
which 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
clearly 23
know 23
to 23
be 23
such 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
say 23
carefully 23
to 23
avoid 23
precipitancy 23
and 23
prejudice 23
and 23
to 23
comprise 23
nothing 23
more 23
in 23
my 23
judgement 23
than 23
what 23
was 23
presented 23
to 23
my 23
mind 23
so 23
clearly 23
and 23
distinctly 23
as 23
to 23
exclude 23
all 23
ground 23
of 23
doubt 23
the 23
second 23
to 23
divide 23
each 23
of 23
the 23
difficulties 23
under 23
examination 23
into 23
as 23
many 23
parts 23
as 23
possible 23
and 23
as 23
might 23
be 23
necessary 23
for 23
its 23
adequate 23
solution 23
the 23
third 23
to 23
conduct 23
my 23
thoughts 23
in 23
such 23
order 23
that 23
by 23
commencing 23
with 23
objects 23
the 23
simplest 23
and 23
easiest 23
to 23
know 23
i 23
might 23
ascend 23
by 23
little 23
and 23
little 23
and 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
step 23
by 23
step 23
to 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
the 23
more 23
complex 23
assigning 23
in 23
thought 23
a 23
certain 23
order 23
even 23
to 23
those 23
objects 23
which 23
in 23
their 23
own 23
nature 23
do 23
not 23
stand 23
in 23
a 23
relation 23
of 23
antecedence 23
and 23
sequence 23
and 23
the 23
last 23
in 23
every 23
case 23
to 23
make 23
enumerations 23
so 23
complete 23
and 23
reviews 23
so 23
general 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
be 23
assured 23
that 23
nothing 23
was 23
omitted 23
the 23
long 23
chains 23
of 23
simple 23
and 23
easy 23
reasonings 23
by 23
means 23
of 23
which 23
geometers 23
are 23
accustomed 23
to 23
reach 23
the 23
conclusions 23
of 23
their 23
most 23
difficult 23
demonstrations 23
had 23
led 23
me 23
to 23
imagine 23
that 23
all 23
things 23
to 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
which 23
man 23
is 23
competent 23
are 23
mutually 23
connected 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
and 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
so 23
far 23
removed 23
from 23
us 23
as 23
to 23
be 23
beyond 23
our 23
reach 23
or 23
so 23
hidden 23
that 23
we 23
cannot 23
discover 23
it 23
provided 23
only 23
we 23
abstain 23
from 23
accepting 23
the 23
false 23
for 23
the 23
true 23
and 23
always 23
preserve 23
in 23
our 23
thoughts 23
the 23
order 23
necessary 23
for 23
the 23
deduction 23
of 23
one 23
truth 23
from 23
another 23
and 23
i 23
had 23
little 23
difficulty 23
in 23
determining 23
the 23
objects 23
with 23
which 23
it 23
was 23
necessary 23
to 23
commence 23
for 23
i 23
was 23
already 23
persuaded 23
that 23
it 23
must 23
be 23
with 23
the 23
simplest 23
and 23
easiest 23
to 23
know 23
and 23
considering 23
that 23
of 23
all 23
those 23
who 23
have 23
hitherto 23
sought 23
truth 23
in 23
the 23
sciences 23
the 23
mathematicians 23
alone 23
have 23
been 23
able 23
to 23
find 23
any 23
demonstrations 23
that 23
is 23
any 23
certain 23
and 23
evident 23
reasons 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
doubt 23
but 23
that 23
such 23
must 23
have 23
been 23
the 23
rule 23
of 23
their 23
investigations 23
i 23
resolved 23
to 23
commence 23
therefore 23
with 23
the 23
examination 23
of 23
the 23
simplest 23
objects 23
not 23
anticipating 23
however 23
from 23
this 23
any 23
other 23
advantage 23
than 23
that 23
to 23
be 23
found 23
in 23
accustoming 23
my 23
mind 23
to 23
the 23
love 23
and 23
nourishment 23
of 23
truth 23
and 23
to 23
a 23
distaste 23
for 23
all 23
such 23
reasonings 23
as 23
were 23
unsound 23
but 23
i 23
had 23
no 23
intention 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
of 23
attempting 23
to 23
master 23
all 23
the 23
particular 23
sciences 23
commonly 23
denominated 23
mathematics 23
but 23
observing 23
that 23
however 23
different 23
their 23
objects 23
they 23
all 23
agree 23
in 23
considering 23
only 23
the 23
various 23
relations 23
or 23
proportions 23
subsisting 23
among 23
those 23
objects 23
i 23
thought 23
it 23
best 23
for 23
my 23
purpose 23
to 23
consider 23
these 23
proportions 23
in 23
the 23
most 23
general 23
form 23
possible 23
without 23
referring 23
them 23
to 23
any 23
objects 23
in 23
particular 23
except 23
such 23
as 23
would 23
most 23
facilitate 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
them 23
and 23
without 23
by 23
any 23
means 23
restricting 23
them 23
to 23
these 23
that 23
afterwards 23
i 23
might 23
thus 23
be 23
the 23
better 23
able 23
to 23
apply 23
them 23
to 23
every 23
other 23
class 23
of 23
objects 23
to 23
which 23
they 23
are 23
legitimately 23
applicable 23
perceiving 23
further 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
understand 23
these 23
relations 23
i 23
should 23
sometimes 23
have 23
to 23
consider 23
them 23
one 23
by 23
one 23
and 23
sometimes 23
only 23
to 23
bear 23
them 23
in 23
mind 23
or 23
embrace 23
them 23
in 23
the 23
aggregate 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
the 23
better 23
to 23
consider 23
them 23
individually 23
i 23
should 23
view 23
them 23
as 23
subsisting 23
between 23
straight 23
lines 23
than 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
find 23
no 23
objects 23
more 23
simple 23
or 23
capable 23
of 23
being 23
more 23
distinctly 23
represented 23
to 23
my 23
imagination 23
and 23
senses 23
and 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
retain 23
them 23
in 23
the 23
memory 23
or 23
embrace 23
an 23
aggregate 23
of 23
many 23
i 23
should 23
express 23
them 23
by 23
certain 23
characters 23
the 23
briefest 23
possible 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
i 23
believed 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
borrow 23
all 23
that 23
was 23
best 23
both 23
in 23
geometrical 23
analysis 23
and 23
in 23
algebra 23
and 23
correct 23
all 23
the 23
defects 23
of 23
the 23
one 23
by 23
help 23
of 23
the 23
other 23
and 23
in 23
point 23
of 23
fact 23
the 23
accurate 23
observance 23
of 23
these 23
few 23
precepts 23
gave 23
me 23
i 23
take 23
the 23
liberty 23
of 23
saying 23
such 23
ease 23
in 23
unraveling 23
all 23
the 23
questions 23
embraced 23
in 23
these 23
two 23
sciences 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
two 23
or 23
three 23
months 23
i 23
devoted 23
to 23
their 23
examination 23
not 23
only 23
did 23
i 23
reach 23
solutions 23
of 23
questions 23
i 23
had 23
formerly 23
deemed 23
exceedingly 23
difficult 23
but 23
even 23
as 23
regards 23
questions 23
of 23
the 23
solution 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
continued 23
ignorant 23
i 23
was 23
enabled 23
as 23
it 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
to 23
determine 23
the 23
means 23
whereby 23
and 23
the 23
extent 23
to 23
which 23
a 23
solution 23
was 23
possible 23
results 23
attributable 23
to 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
i 23
commenced 23
with 23
the 23
simplest 23
and 23
most 23
general 23
truths 23
and 23
that 23
thus 23
each 23
truth 23
discovered 23
was 23
a 23
rule 23
available 23
in 23
the 23
discovery 23
of 23
subsequent 23
ones 23
nor 23
in 23
this 23
perhaps 23
shall 23
i 23
appear 23
too 23

the 23
child 23

who 23
has 23
been 23
instructed 23
in 23
the 23

arithmetic 23

has 23
made 23

of 23
human 23
genius 23
now 23
in 23
conclusion 23
the 23
method 23
which 23
teaches 23
adherence 23
to 23
the 23
true 23
order 23
and 23
an 23
exact 23
enumeration 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
conditions 23
of 23
the 23
thing 23
sought 23
includes 23
all 23
that 23
gives 23
certitude 23
to 23
the 23
rules 23
of 23
arithmetic 23
but 23
the 23
chief 23
ground 23
of 23
my 23
satisfaction 23
with 23
thus 23
method 23
was 23
the 23
assurance 23
i 23
had 23
of 23
thereby 23
exercising 23
my 23
reason 23
in 23
all 23
matters 23
if 23
not 23
with 23
absolute 23
perfection 23
at 23
least 23
with 23
the 23
greatest 23
attainable 23
by 23
me 23
besides 23
i 23
was 23
conscious 23
that 23
by 23
its 23
use 23
my 23
mind 23
was 23
becoming 23
gradually 23
habituated 23
to 23
clearer 23
and 23
more 23
distinct 23
conceptions 23
of 23
its 23
objects 23
and 23
i 23
hoped 23
also 23
from 23
not 23
having 23
restricted 23
this 23
method 23
to 23
any 23
particular 23
matter 23
to 23
apply 23
it 23
to 23
the 23
difficulties 23
of 23
the 23
other 23
sciences 23
with 23
not 23
less 23
success 23
than 23
to 23
those 23
of 23
algebra 23
i 23
should 23
not 23
however 23
on 23
this 23
account 23
have 23
ventured 23
at 23
once 23
on 23
the 23
examination 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
difficulties 23
of 23
the 23
sciences 23
which 23
presented 23
themselves 23
to 23
me 23
for 23
this 23
would 23
have 23
been 23
contrary 23
to 23
the 23
order 23
prescribed 23
in 23
the 23
method 23
but 23
observing 23
that 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
such 23
is 23
dependent 23
on 23
principles 23
borrowed 23
from 23
philosophy 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
found 23
nothing 23
certain 23
i 23
thought 23
it 23
necessary 23
first 23
of 23
all 23
to 23
endeavor 23
to 23
establish 23
its 23
principles 23
and 23
because 23
i 23
observed 23
besides 23
that 23
an 23
inquiry 23
of 23
this 23
kind 23
was 23
of 23
all 23
others 23
of 23
the 23
greatest 23
moment 23
and 23
one 23
in 23
which 23
precipitancy 23
and 23
anticipation 23
in 23
judgment 23
were 23
most 23
to 23
be 23
dreaded 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
i 23
ought 23
not 23
to 23
approach 23
it 23
till 23
i 23
had 23
reached 23
a 23
more 23
mature 23
age 23
being 23
at 23
that 23
time 23
but 23
twentythree 23
and 23
had 23
first 23
of 23
all 23
employed 23
much 23
of 23
my 23
time 23
in 23
preparation 23
for 23
the 23
work 23
as 23
well 23
by 23
eradicating 23
from 23
my 23
mind 23
all 23
the 23
erroneous 23
opinions 23
i 23
had 23
up 23
to 23
that 23
moment 23
accepted 23
as 23
by 23
amassing 23
variety 23
of 23
experience 23
to 23
afford 23
materials 23
for 23
my 23
reasonings 23
and 23
by 23
continually 23
exercising 23
myself 23
in 23
my 23
chosen 23
method 23
with 23
a 23
view 23
to 23
increased 23
skill 23
in 23
its 23
application 23
part 23
iii 23
and 23
finally 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
enough 23
before 23
commencing 23
to 23
rebuild 23
the 23
house 23
in 23
which 23
we 23
live 23
that 23
it 23
be 23
pulled 23
down 23
and 23
materials 23
and 23
builders 23
provided 23
or 23
that 23
we 23
engage 23
in 23
the 23
work 23
ourselves 23
according 23
to 23
a 23
plan 23
which 23
we 23
have 23
beforehand 23
carefully 23
drawn 23
out 23
but 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
likewise 23
necessary 23
that 23
we 23
be 23
furnished 23
with 23
some 23
other 23
house 23
in 23
which 23
we 23
may 23
live 23
commodiously 23
during 23
the 23
operations 23
so 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
not 23
remain 23
irresolute 23
in 23
my 23
actions 23
while 23
my 23
reason 23
compelled 23
me 23
to 23
suspend 23
my 23
judgement 23
and 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
not 23
be 23
prevented 23
from 23
living 23
thenceforward 23
in 23
the 23
greatest 23
possible 23
felicity 23
i 23
formed 23
a 23
provisory 23
code 23
of 23
morals 23
composed 23
of 23
three 23
or 23
four 23
maxims 23
with 23
which 23
i 23
am 23
desirous 23
to 23
make 23
you 23
acquainted 23
the 23
first 23
was 23
to 23
obey 23
the 23
laws 23
and 23
customs 23
of 23
my 23
country 23
adhering 23
firmly 23
to 23
the 23
faith 23
in 23
which 23
by 23
the 23
grace 23
of 23
god 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
educated 23
from 23
my 23
childhood 23
and 23
regulating 23
my 23
conduct 23
in 23
every 23
other 23
matter 23
according 23
to 23
the 23
most 23
moderate 23
opinions 23
and 23
the 23
farthest 23
removed 23
from 23
extremes 23
which 23
should 23
happen 23
to 23
be 23
adopted 23
in 23
practice 23
with 23
general 23
consent 23
of 23
the 23
most 23
judicious 23
of 23
those 23
among 23
whom 23
i 23
might 23
be 23
living 23
for 23
as 23
i 23
had 23
from 23
that 23
time 23
begun 23
to 23
hold 23
my 23
own 23
opinions 23
for 23
nought 23
because 23
i 23
wished 23
to 23
subject 23
them 23
all 23
to 23
examination 23
i 23
was 23
convinced 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
do 23
better 23
than 23
follow 23
in 23
the 23
meantime 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
the 23
most 23
judicious 23
and 23
although 23
there 23
are 23
some 23
perhaps 23
among 23
the 23
persians 23
and 23
chinese 23
as 23
judicious 23
as 23
among 23
ourselves 23
expediency 23
seemed 23
to 23
dictate 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
regulate 23
my 23
practice 23
conformably 23
to 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
those 23
with 23
whom 23
i 23
should 23
have 23
to 23
live 23
and 23
it 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
ascertain 23
the 23
real 23
opinions 23
of 23
such 23
i 23
ought 23
rather 23
to 23
take 23
cognizance 23
of 23
what 23
they 23
practised 23
than 23
of 23
what 23
they 23
said 23
not 23
only 23
because 23
in 23
the 23
corruption 23
of 23
our 23
manners 23
there 23
are 23
few 23
disposed 23
to 23
speak 23
exactly 23
as 23
they 23
believe 23
but 23
also 23
because 23
very 23
many 23
are 23
not 23
aware 23
of 23
what 23
it 23
is 23
that 23
they 23
really 23
believe 23
for 23
as 23
the 23
act 23
of 23
mind 23
by 23
which 23
a 23
thing 23
is 23
believed 23
is 23
different 23
from 23
that 23
by 23
which 23
we 23
know 23
that 23
we 23
believe 23
it 23
the 23
one 23
act 23
is 23
often 23
found 23
without 23
the 23
other 23
also 23
amid 23
many 23
opinions 23
held 23
in 23
equal 23
repute 23
i 23
chose 23
always 23
the 23
most 23
moderate 23
as 23
much 23
for 23
the 23
reason 23
that 23
these 23
are 23
always 23
the 23
most 23
convenient 23
for 23
practice 23
and 23
probably 23
the 23
best 23
for 23
all 23
excess 23
is 23
generally 23
vicious 23
as 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
event 23
of 23
my 23
falling 23
into 23
error 23
i 23
might 23
be 23
at 23
less 23
distance 23
from 23
the 23
truth 23
than 23
if 23
having 23
chosen 23
one 23
of 23
the 23
extremes 23
it 23
should 23
turn 23
out 23
to 23
be 23
the 23
other 23
which 23
i 23
ought 23
to 23
have 23
adopted 23
and 23
i 23
placed 23
in 23
the 23
class 23
of 23
extremes 23
especially 23
all 23
promises 23
by 23
which 23
somewhat 23
of 23
our 23
freedom 23
is 23
abridged 23
not 23
that 23
i 23
disapproved 23
of 23
the 23
laws 23
which 23
to 23
provide 23
against 23
the 23
instability 23
of 23
men 23
of 23
feeble 23
resolution 23
when 23
what 23
is 23
sought 23
to 23
be 23
accomplished 23
is 23
some 23
good 23
permit 23
engagements 23
by 23
vows 23
and 23
contracts 23
binding 23
the 23
parties 23
to 23
persevere 23
in 23
it 23
or 23
even 23
for 23
the 23
security 23
of 23
commerce 23
sanction 23
similar 23
engagements 23
where 23
the 23
purpose 23
sought 23
to 23
be 23
realized 23
is 23
indifferent 23
but 23
because 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
find 23
anything 23
on 23
earth 23
which 23
was 23
wholly 23
superior 23
to 23
change 23
and 23
because 23
for 23
myself 23
in 23
particular 23
i 23
hoped 23
gradually 23
to 23
perfect 23
my 23
judgments 23
and 23
not 23
to 23
suffer 23
them 23
to 23
deteriorate 23
i 23
would 23
have 23
deemed 23
it 23
a 23
grave 23
sin 23
against 23
good 23
sense 23
if 23
for 23
the 23
reason 23
that 23
i 23
approved 23
of 23
something 23
at 23
a 23
particular 23
time 23
i 23
therefore 23
bound 23
myself 23
to 23
hold 23
it 23
for 23
good 23
at 23
a 23
subsequent 23
time 23
when 23
perhaps 23
it 23
had 23
ceased 23
to 23
be 23
so 23
or 23
i 23
had 23
ceased 23
to 23
esteem 23
it 23
such 23
my 23
second 23
maxim 23
was 23
to 23
be 23
as 23
firm 23
and 23
resolute 23
in 23
my 23
actions 23
as 23
i 23
was 23
able 23
and 23
not 23
to 23
adhere 23
less 23
steadfastly 23
to 23
the 23
most 23
doubtful 23
opinions 23
when 23
once 23
adopted 23
than 23
if 23
they 23
had 23
been 23
highly 23
certain 23
imitating 23
in 23
this 23
the 23
example 23
of 23
travelers 23
who 23
when 23
they 23
have 23
lost 23
their 23
way 23
in 23
a 23
forest 23
ought 23
not 23
to 23
wander 23
from 23
side 23
to 23
side 23
far 23
less 23
remain 23
in 23
one 23
place 23
but 23
proceed 23
constantly 23
towards 23
the 23
same 23
side 23
in 23
as 23
straight 23
a 23
line 23
as 23
possible 23
without 23
changing 23
their 23
direction 23
for 23
slight 23
reasons 23
although 23
perhaps 23
it 23
might 23
be 23
chance 23
alone 23
which 23
at 23
first 23
determined 23
the 23
selection 23
for 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
if 23
they 23
do 23
not 23
exactly 23
reach 23
the 23
point 23
they 23
desire 23
they 23
will 23
come 23
at 23
least 23
in 23
the 23
end 23
to 23
some 23
place 23
that 23
will 23
probably 23
be 23
preferable 23
to 23
the 23
middle 23
of 23
a 23
forest 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
since 23
in 23
action 23
it 23
frequently 23
happens 23
that 23
no 23
delay 23
is 23
permissible 23
it 23
is 23
very 23
certain 23
that 23
when 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
in 23
our 23
power 23
to 23
determine 23
what 23
is 23
true 23
we 23
ought 23
to 23
act 23
according 23
to 23
what 23
is 23
most 23
probable 23
and 23
even 23
although 23
we 23
should 23
not 23
remark 23
a 23
greater 23
probability 23
in 23
one 23
opinion 23
than 23
in 23
another 23
we 23
ought 23
notwithstanding 23
to 23
choose 23
one 23
or 23
the 23
other 23
and 23
afterwards 23
consider 23
it 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
it 23
relates 23
to 23
practice 23
as 23
no 23
longer 23
dubious 23
but 23
manifestly 23
true 23
and 23
certain 23
since 23
the 23
reason 23
by 23
which 23
our 23
choice 23
has 23
been 23
determined 23
is 23
itself 23
possessed 23
of 23
these 23
qualities 23
this 23
principle 23
was 23
sufficient 23
thenceforward 23
to 23
rid 23
me 23
of 23
all 23
those 23
repentings 23
and 23
pangs 23
of 23
remorse 23
that 23
usually 23
disturb 23
the 23
consciences 23
of 23
such 23
feeble 23
and 23
uncertain 23
minds 23
as 23
destitute 23
of 23
any 23
clear 23
and 23
determinate 23
principle 23
of 23
choice 23
allow 23
themselves 23
one 23
day 23
to 23
adopt 23
a 23
course 23
of 23
action 23
as 23
the 23
best 23
which 23
they 23
abandon 23
the 23
next 23
as 23
the 23
opposite 23
my 23
third 23
maxim 23
was 23
to 23
endeavor 23
always 23
to 23
conquer 23
myself 23
rather 23
than 23
fortune 23
and 23
change 23
my 23
desires 23
rather 23
than 23
the 23
order 23
of 23
the 23
world 23
and 23
in 23
general 23
accustom 23
myself 23
to 23
the 23
persuasion 23
that 23
except 23
our 23
own 23
thoughts 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
absolutely 23
in 23
our 23
power 23
so 23
that 23
when 23
we 23
have 23
done 23
our 23
best 23
in 23
things 23
external 23
to 23
us 23
all 23
wherein 23
we 23
fail 23
of 23
success 23
is 23
to 23
be 23
held 23
as 23
regards 23
us 23
absolutely 23
impossible 23
and 23
this 23
single 23
principle 23
seemed 23
to 23
me 23
sufficient 23
to 23
prevent 23
me 23
from 23
desiring 23
for 23
the 23
future 23
anything 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
obtain 23
and 23
thus 23
render 23
me 23
contented 23
for 23
since 23
our 23
will 23
naturally 23
seeks 23
those 23
objects 23
alone 23
which 23
the 23
understanding 23
represents 23
as 23
in 23
some 23
way 23
possible 23
of 23
attainment 23
it 23
is 23
plain 23
that 23
if 23
we 23
consider 23
all 23
external 23
goods 23
as 23
equally 23
beyond 23
our 23
power 23
we 23
shall 23
no 23
more 23
regret 23
the 23
absence 23
of 23
such 23
goods 23
as 23
seem 23
due 23
to 23
our 23
birth 23
when 23
deprived 23
of 23
them 23
without 23
any 23
fault 23
of 23
ours 23
than 23
our 23
not 23
possessing 23
the 23
kingdoms 23
of 23
china 23
or 23
mexico 23
and 23
thus 23
making 23
so 23
to 23
speak 23
a 23
virtue 23
of 23
necessity 23
we 23
shall 23
no 23
more 23
desire 23
health 23
in 23
disease 23
or 23
freedom 23
in 23
imprisonment 23
than 23
we 23
now 23
do 23
bodies 23
incorruptible 23
as 23
diamonds 23
or 23
the 23
wings 23
of 23
birds 23
to 23
fly 23
with 23
but 23
i 23
confess 23
there 23
is 23
need 23
of 23
prolonged 23
discipline 23
and 23
frequently 23
repeated 23
meditation 23
to 23
accustom 23
the 23
mind 23
to 23
view 23
all 23
objects 23
in 23
this 23
light 23
and 23
i 23
believe 23
that 23
in 23
this 23
chiefly 23
consisted 23
the 23
secret 23
of 23
the 23
power 23
of 23
such 23
philosophers 23
as 23
in 23
former 23
times 23
were 23
enabled 23
to 23
rise 23
superior 23
to 23
the 23
influence 23
of 23
fortune 23
and 23
amid 23
suffering 23
and 23
poverty 23
enjoy 23
a 23
happiness 23
which 23
their 23
gods 23
might 23
have 23
envied 23
for 23
occupied 23
incessantly 23
with 23
the 23
consideration 23
of 23
the 23
limits 23
prescribed 23
to 23
their 23
power 23
by 23
nature 23
they 23
became 23
so 23
entirely 23
convinced 23
that 23
nothing 23
was 23
at 23
their 23
disposal 23
except 23
their 23
own 23
thoughts 23
that 23
this 23
conviction 23
was 23
of 23
itself 23
sufficient 23
to 23
prevent 23
their 23
entertaining 23
any 23
desire 23
of 23
other 23
objects 23
and 23
over 23
their 23
thoughts 23
they 23
acquired 23
a 23
sway 23
so 23
absolute 23
that 23
they 23
had 23
some 23
ground 23
on 23
this 23
account 23
for 23
esteeming 23
themselves 23
more 23
rich 23
and 23
more 23
powerful 23
more 23
free 23
and 23
more 23
happy 23
than 23
other 23
men 23
who 23
whatever 23
be 23
the 23
favors 23
heaped 23
on 23
them 23
by 23
nature 23
and 23
fortune 23
if 23
destitute 23
of 23
this 23
philosophy 23
can 23
never 23
command 23
the 23
realization 23
of 23
all 23
their 23
desires 23
in 23
fine 23
to 23
conclude 23
this 23
code 23
of 23
morals 23
i 23
thought 23
of 23
reviewing 23
the 23
different 23
occupations 23
of 23
men 23
in 23
this 23
life 23
with 23
the 23
view 23
of 23
making 23
choice 23
of 23
the 23
best 23
and 23
without 23
wishing 23
to 23
offer 23
any 23
remarks 23
on 23
the 23
employments 23
of 23
others 23
i 23
may 23
state 23
that 23
it 23
was 23
my 23
conviction 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
do 23
better 23
than 23
continue 23
in 23
that 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
was 23
engaged 23
viz 23
in 23
devoting 23
my 23
whole 23
life 23
to 23
the 23
culture 23
of 23
my 23
reason 23
and 23
in 23
making 23
the 23
greatest 23
progress 23
i 23
was 23
able 23
in 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
truth 23
on 23
the 23
principles 23
of 23
the 23
method 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
prescribed 23
to 23
myself 23
this 23
method 23
from 23
the 23
time 23
i 23
had 23
begun 23
to 23
apply 23
it 23
had 23
been 23
to 23
me 23
the 23
source 23
of 23
satisfaction 23
so 23
intense 23
as 23
to 23
lead 23
me 23
to 23
believe 23
that 23
more 23
perfect 23
or 23
more 23
innocent 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
enjoyed 23
in 23
this 23
life 23
and 23
as 23
by 23
its 23
means 23
i 23
daily 23
discovered 23
truths 23
that 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
of 23
some 23
importance 23
and 23
of 23
which 23
other 23
men 23
were 23
generally 23
ignorant 23
the 23
gratification 23
thence 23
arising 23
so 23
occupied 23
my 23
mind 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
wholly 23
indifferent 23
to 23
every 23
other 23
object 23
besides 23
the 23
three 23
preceding 23
maxims 23
were 23
founded 23
singly 23
on 23
the 23
design 23
of 23
continuing 23
the 23
work 23
of 23
self 23
instruction 23
for 23
since 23
god 23
has 23
endowed 23
each 23
of 23
us 23
with 23
some 23
light 23
of 23
reason 23
by 23
which 23
to 23
distinguish 23
truth 23
from 23
error 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
have 23
believed 23
that 23
i 23
ought 23
for 23
a 23
single 23
moment 23
to 23
rest 23
satisfied 23
with 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
another 23
unless 23
i 23
had 23
resolved 23
to 23
exercise 23
my 23
own 23
judgment 23
in 23
examining 23
these 23
whenever 23
i 23
should 23
be 23
duly 23
qualified 23
for 23
the 23
task 23
nor 23
could 23
i 23
have 23
proceeded 23
on 23
such 23
opinions 23
without 23
scruple 23
had 23
i 23
supposed 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
thereby 23
forfeit 23
any 23
advantage 23
for 23
attaining 23
still 23
more 23
accurate 23
should 23
such 23
exist 23
and 23
in 23
fine 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
have 23
restrained 23
my 23
desires 23
nor 23
remained 23
satisfied 23
had 23
i 23
not 23
followed 23
a 23
path 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
thought 23
myself 23
certain 23
of 23
attaining 23
all 23
the 23
knowledge 23
to 23
the 23
acquisition 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
was 23
competent 23
as 23
well 23
as 23
the 23
largest 23
amount 23
of 23
what 23
is 23
truly 23
good 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
ever 23
hope 23
to 23
secure 23
inasmuch 23
as 23
we 23
neither 23
seek 23
nor 23
shun 23
any 23
object 23
except 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
our 23
understanding 23
represents 23
it 23
as 23
good 23
or 23
bad 23
all 23
that 23
is 23
necessary 23
to 23
right 23
action 23
is 23
right 23
judgment 23
and 23
to 23
the 23
best 23
action 23
the 23
most 23
correct 23
judgment 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
the 23
acquisition 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
virtues 23
with 23
all 23
else 23
that 23
is 23
truly 23
valuable 23
and 23
within 23
our 23
reach 23
and 23
the 23
assurance 23
of 23
such 23
an 23
acquisition 23
cannot 23
fail 23
to 23
render 23
us 23
contented 23
having 23
thus 23
provided 23
myself 23
with 23
these 23
maxims 23
and 23
having 23
placed 23
them 23
in 23
reserve 23
along 23
with 23
the 23
truths 23
of 23
faith 23
which 23
have 23
ever 23
occupied 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
in 23
my 23
belief 23
i 23
came 23
to 23
the 23
conclusion 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
with 23
freedom 23
set 23
about 23
ridding 23
myself 23
of 23
what 23
remained 23
of 23
my 23
opinions 23
and 23
inasmuch 23
as 23
i 23
hoped 23
to 23
be 23
better 23
able 23
successfully 23
to 23
accomplish 23
this 23
work 23
by 23
holding 23
intercourse 23
with 23
mankind 23
than 23
by 23
remaining 23
longer 23
shut 23
up 23
in 23
the 23
retirement 23
where 23
these 23
thoughts 23
had 23
occurred 23
to 23
me 23
i 23
betook 23
me 23
again 23
to 23
traveling 23
before 23
the 23
winter 23
was 23
well 23
ended 23
and 23
during 23
the 23
nine 23
subsequent 23
years 23
i 23
did 23
nothing 23
but 23
roam 23
from 23
one 23
place 23
to 23
another 23
desirous 23
of 23
being 23
a 23
spectator 23
rather 23
than 23
an 23
actor 23
in 23
the 23
plays 23
exhibited 23
on 23
the 23
theater 23
of 23
the 23
world 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
made 23
it 23
my 23
business 23
in 23
each 23
matter 23
to 23
reflect 23
particularly 23
upon 23
what 23
might 23
fairly 23
be 23
doubted 23
and 23
prove 23
a 23
source 23
of 23
error 23
i 23
gradually 23
rooted 23
out 23
from 23
my 23
mind 23
all 23
the 23
errors 23
which 23
had 23
hitherto 23
crept 23
into 23
it 23
not 23
that 23
in 23
this 23
i 23
imitated 23
the 23
sceptics 23
who 23
doubt 23
only 23
that 23
they 23
may 23
doubt 23
and 23
seek 23
nothing 23
beyond 23
uncertainty 23
itself 23
for 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
my 23
design 23
was 23
singly 23
to 23
find 23
ground 23
of 23
assurance 23
and 23
cast 23
aside 23
the 23
loose 23
earth 23
and 23
sand 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
reach 23
the 23
rock 23
or 23
the 23
clay 23
in 23
this 23
as 23
appears 23
to 23
me 23
i 23
was 23
successful 23
enough 23
for 23
since 23
i 23
endeavored 23
to 23
discover 23
the 23
falsehood 23
or 23
incertitude 23
of 23
the 23
propositions 23
i 23
examined 23
not 23
by 23
feeble 23
conjectures 23
but 23
by 23
clear 23
and 23
certain 23
reasonings 23
i 23
met 23
with 23
nothing 23
so 23
doubtful 23
as 23
not 23
to 23
yield 23
some 23
conclusion 23
of 23
adequate 23
certainty 23
although 23
this 23
were 23
merely 23
the 23
inference 23
that 23
the 23
matter 23
in 23
question 23
contained 23
nothing 23
certain 23
and 23
just 23
as 23
in 23
pulling 23
down 23
an 23
old 23
house 23
we 23
usually 23
reserve 23
the 23
ruins 23
to 23
contribute 23
towards 23
the 23
erection 23
so 23
in 23
destroying 23
such 23
of 23
my 23
opinions 23
as 23
i 23
judged 23
to 23
be 23
illfounded 23
i 23
made 23
a 23
variety 23
of 23
observations 23
and 23
acquired 23
an 23
amount 23
of 23
experience 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
availed 23
myself 23
in 23
the 23
establishment 23
of 23
more 23
certain 23
and 23
further 23
i 23
continued 23
to 23
exercise 23
myself 23
in 23
the 23
method 23
i 23
had 23
prescribed 23
for 23
besides 23
taking 23
care 23
in 23
general 23
to 23
conduct 23
all 23
my 23
thoughts 23
according 23
to 23
its 23
rules 23
i 23
reserved 23
some 23
hours 23
from 23
time 23
to 23
time 23
which 23
i 23
expressly 23
devoted 23
to 23
the 23
employment 23
of 23
the 23
method 23
in 23
the 23
solution 23
of 23
mathematical 23
difficulties 23
or 23
even 23
in 23
the 23
solution 23
likewise 23
of 23
some 23
questions 23
belonging 23
to 23
other 23
sciences 23
but 23
which 23
by 23
my 23
having 23
detached 23
them 23
from 23
such 23
principles 23
of 23
these 23
sciences 23
as 23
were 23
of 23
inadequate 23
certainty 23
were 23
rendered 23
almost 23
mathematical 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
this 23
will 23
be 23
manifest 23
from 23
the 23
numerous 23
examples 23
contained 23
in 23
this 23
volume 23
and 23
thus 23
without 23
in 23
appearance 23
living 23
otherwise 23
than 23
those 23
who 23
with 23
no 23
other 23
occupation 23
than 23
that 23
of 23
spending 23
their 23
lives 23
agreeably 23
and 23
innocently 23
study 23
to 23
sever 23
pleasure 23
from 23
vice 23
and 23
who 23
that 23
they 23
may 23
enjoy 23
their 23
leisure 23
without 23
ennui 23
have 23
recourse 23
to 23
such 23
pursuits 23
as 23
are 23
honorable 23
i 23
was 23
nevertheless 23
prosecuting 23
my 23
design 23
and 23
making 23
greater 23
progress 23
in 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
truth 23
than 23
i 23
might 23
perhaps 23
have 23
made 23
had 23
i 23
been 23
engaged 23
in 23
the 23
perusal 23
of 23
books 23
merely 23
or 23
in 23
holding 23
converse 23
with 23
men 23
of 23
letters 23
these 23
nine 23
years 23
passed 23
away 23
however 23
before 23
i 23
had 23
come 23
to 23
any 23
determinate 23
judgment 23
respecting 23
the 23
difficulties 23
which 23
form 23
matter 23
of 23
dispute 23
among 23
the 23
learned 23
or 23
had 23
commenced 23
to 23
seek 23
the 23
principles 23
of 23
any 23
philosophy 23
more 23
certain 23
than 23
the 23
vulgar 23
and 23
the 23
examples 23
of 23
many 23
men 23
of 23
the 23
highest 23
genius 23
who 23
had 23
in 23
former 23
times 23
engaged 23
in 23
this 23
inquiry 23
but 23
as 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
without 23
success 23
led 23
me 23
to 23
imagine 23
it 23
to 23
be 23
a 23
work 23
of 23
so 23
much 23
difficulty 23
that 23
i 23
would 23
not 23
perhaps 23
have 23
ventured 23
on 23
it 23
so 23
soon 23
had 23
i 23
not 23
heard 23
it 23
currently 23
rumored 23
that 23
i 23
had 23
already 23
completed 23
the 23
inquiry 23
i 23
know 23
not 23
what 23
were 23
the 23
grounds 23
of 23
this 23
opinion 23
and 23
if 23
my 23
conversation 23
contributed 23
in 23
any 23
measure 23
to 23
its 23
rise 23
this 23
must 23
have 23
happened 23
rather 23
from 23
my 23
having 23
confessed 23
my 23
ignorance 23
with 23
greater 23
freedom 23
than 23
those 23
are 23
accustomed 23
to 23
do 23
who 23
have 23
studied 23
a 23
little 23
and 23
expounded 23
perhaps 23
the 23
reasons 23
that 23
led 23
me 23
to 23
doubt 23
of 23
many 23
of 23
those 23
things 23
that 23
by 23
others 23
are 23
esteemed 23
certain 23
than 23
from 23
my 23
having 23
boasted 23
of 23
any 23
system 23
of 23
philosophy 23
but 23
as 23
i 23
am 23
of 23
a 23
disposition 23
that 23
makes 23
me 23
unwilling 23
to 23
be 23
esteemed 23
different 23
from 23
what 23
i 23
really 23
am 23
i 23
thought 23
it 23
necessary 23
to 23
endeavor 23
by 23
all 23
means 23
to 23
render 23
myself 23
worthy 23
of 23
the 23
reputation 23
accorded 23
to 23
me 23
and 23
it 23
is 23
now 23
exactly 23
eight 23
years 23
since 23
this 23
desire 23
constrained 23
me 23
to 23
remove 23
from 23
all 23
those 23
places 23
where 23
interruption 23
from 23
any 23
of 23
my 23
acquaintances 23
was 23
possible 23
and 23
betake 23
myself 23
to 23
this 23
country 23
in 23
which 23
the 23
long 23
duration 23
of 23
the 23
war 23
has 23
led 23
to 23
the 23
establishment 23
of 23
such 23
discipline 23
that 23
the 23
armies 23
maintained 23
seem 23
to 23
be 23
of 23
use 23
only 23
in 23
enabling 23
the 23
inhabitants 23
to 23
enjoy 23
more 23
securely 23
the 23
blessings 23
of 23
peace 23
and 23
where 23
in 23
the 23
midst 23
of 23
a 23
great 23
crowd 23
actively 23
engaged 23
in 23
business 23
and 23
more 23
careful 23
of 23
their 23
own 23
affairs 23
than 23
curious 23
about 23
those 23
of 23
others 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
enabled 23
to 23
live 23
without 23
being 23
deprived 23
of 23
any 23
of 23
the 23
conveniences 23
to 23
be 23
had 23
in 23
the 23
most 23
populous 23
cities 23
and 23
yet 23
as 23
solitary 23
and 23
as 23
retired 23
as 23
in 23
the 23
midst 23
of 23
the 23
most 23
remote 23
deserts 23
part 23
iv 23
i 23
am 23
in 23
doubt 23
as 23
to 23
the 23
propriety 23
of 23
making 23
my 23
first 23
meditations 23
in 23
the 23
place 23
above 23
mentioned 23
matter 23
of 23
discourse 23
for 23
these 23
are 23
so 23
metaphysical 23
and 23
so 23
uncommon 23
as 23
not 23
perhaps 23
to 23
be 23
acceptable 23
to 23
every 23
one 23
and 23
yet 23
that 23
it 23
may 23
be 23
determined 23
whether 23
the 23
foundations 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
laid 23
are 23
sufficiently 23
secure 23
i 23
find 23
myself 23
in 23
a 23
measure 23
constrained 23
to 23
advert 23
to 23
them 23
i 23
had 23
long 23
before 23
remarked 23
that 23
in 23
relation 23
to 23
practice 23
it 23
is 23
sometimes 23
necessary 23
to 23
adopt 23
as 23
if 23
above 23
doubt 23
opinions 23
which 23
we 23
discern 23
to 23
be 23
highly 23
uncertain 23
as 23
has 23
been 23
already 23
said 23
but 23
as 23
i 23
then 23
desired 23
to 23
give 23
my 23
attention 23
solely 23
to 23
the 23
search 23
after 23
truth 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
a 23
procedure 23
exactly 23
the 23
opposite 23
was 23
called 23
for 23
and 23
that 23
i 23
ought 23
to 23
reject 23
as 23
absolutely 23
false 23
all 23
opinions 23
in 23
regard 23
to 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
suppose 23
the 23
least 23
ground 23
for 23
doubt 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
ascertain 23
whether 23
after 23
that 23
there 23
remained 23
aught 23
in 23
my 23
belief 23
that 23
was 23
wholly 23
indubitable 23
accordingly 23
seeing 23
that 23
our 23
senses 23
sometimes 23
deceive 23
us 23
i 23
was 23
willing 23
to 23
suppose 23
that 23
there 23
existed 23
nothing 23
really 23
such 23
as 23
they 23
presented 23
to 23
us 23
and 23
because 23
some 23
men 23
err 23
in 23
reasoning 23
and 23
fall 23
into 23
paralogisms 23
even 23
on 23
the 23
simplest 23
matters 23
of 23
geometry 23
i 23
convinced 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
as 23
open 23
to 23
error 23
as 23
any 23
other 23
rejected 23
as 23
false 23
all 23
the 23
reasonings 23
i 23
had 23
hitherto 23
taken 23
for 23
demonstrations 23
and 23
finally 23
when 23
i 23
considered 23
that 23
the 23
very 23
same 23
thoughts 23
presentations 23
which 23
we 23
experience 23
when 23
awake 23
may 23
also 23
be 23
experienced 23
when 23
we 23
are 23
asleep 23
while 23
there 23
is 23
at 23
that 23
time 23
not 23
one 23
of 23
them 23
true 23
i 23
supposed 23
that 23
all 23
the 23
objects 23
presentations 23
that 23
had 23
ever 23
entered 23
into 23
my 23
mind 23
when 23
awake 23
had 23
in 23
them 23
no 23
more 23
truth 23
than 23
the 23
illusions 23
of 23
my 23
dreams 23
but 23
immediately 23
upon 23
this 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
whilst 23
i 23
thus 23
wished 23
to 23
think 23
that 23
all 23
was 23
false 23
it 23
was 23
absolutely 23
necessary 23
that 23
i 23
who 23
thus 23
thought 23
should 23
be 23
somewhat 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
this 23
truth 23
i 23
think 23
therefore 23
i 23
am 23
cogito 23
ergo 23
sum 23
was 23
so 23
certain 23
and 23
of 23
such 23
evidence 23
that 23
no 23
ground 23
of 23
doubt 23
however 23
extravagant 23
could 23
be 23
alleged 23
by 23
the 23
sceptics 23
capable 23
of 23
shaking 23
it 23
i 23
concluded 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
without 23
scruple 23
accept 23
it 23
as 23
the 23
first 23
principle 23
of 23
the 23
philosophy 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
was 23
in 23
search 23
in 23
the 23
next 23
place 23
i 23
attentively 23
examined 23
what 23
i 23
was 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
suppose 23
that 23
i 23
had 23
no 23
body 23
and 23
that 23
there 23
was 23
no 23
world 23
nor 23
any 23
place 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
might 23
be 23
but 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
therefore 23
suppose 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
not 23
and 23
that 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
from 23
the 23
very 23
circumstance 23
that 23
i 23
thought 23
to 23
doubt 23
of 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
other 23
things 23
it 23
most 23
clearly 23
and 23
certainly 23
followed 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
while 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
if 23
i 23
had 23
only 23
ceased 23
to 23
think 23
although 23
all 23
the 23
other 23
objects 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
ever 23
imagined 23
had 23
been 23
in 23
reality 23
existent 23
i 23
would 23
have 23
had 23
no 23
reason 23
to 23
believe 23
that 23
i 23
existed 23
i 23
thence 23
concluded 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
a 23
substance 23
whose 23
whole 23
essence 23
or 23
nature 23
consists 23
only 23
in 23
thinking 23
and 23
which 23
that 23
it 23
may 23
exist 23
has 23
need 23
of 23
no 23
place 23
nor 23
is 23
dependent 23
on 23
any 23
material 23
thing 23
so 23
that 23
i 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
say 23
the 23
mind 23
by 23
which 23
i 23
am 23
what 23
i 23
am 23
is 23
wholly 23
distinct 23
from 23
the 23
body 23
and 23
is 23
even 23
more 23
easily 23
known 23
than 23
the 23
latter 23
and 23
is 23
such 23
that 23
although 23
the 23
latter 23
were 23
not 23
it 23
would 23
still 23
continue 23
to 23
be 23
all 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
after 23
this 23
i 23
inquired 23
in 23
general 23
into 23
what 23
is 23
essential 23
i 23
to 23
the 23
truth 23
and 23
certainty 23
of 23
a 23
proposition 23
for 23
since 23
i 23
had 23
discovered 23
one 23
which 23
i 23
knew 23
to 23
be 23
true 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
i 23
must 23
likewise 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
discover 23
the 23
ground 23
of 23
this 23
certitude 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
words 23
i 23
think 23
therefore 23
i 23
am 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
at 23
all 23
which 23
gives 23
me 23
assurance 23
of 23
their 23
truth 23
beyond 23
this 23
that 23
i 23
see 23
very 23
clearly 23
that 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
think 23
it 23
is 23
necessary 23
to 23
exist 23
i 23
concluded 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
take 23
as 23
a 23
general 23
rule 23
the 23
principle 23
that 23
all 23
the 23
things 23
which 23
we 23
very 23
clearly 23
and 23
distinctly 23
conceive 23
are 23
true 23
only 23
observing 23
however 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
some 23
difficulty 23
in 23
rightly 23
determining 23
the 23
objects 23
which 23
we 23
distinctly 23
conceive 23
in 23
the 23
next 23
place 23
from 23
reflecting 23
on 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
i 23
doubted 23
and 23
that 23
consequently 23
my 23
being 23
was 23
not 23
wholly 23
perfect 23
for 23
i 23
clearly 23
saw 23
that 23
it 23
was 23
a 23
greater 23
perfection 23
to 23
know 23
than 23
to 23
doubt 23
i 23
was 23
led 23
to 23
inquire 23
whence 23
i 23
had 23
learned 23
to 23
think 23
of 23
something 23
more 23
perfect 23
than 23
myself 23
and 23
i 23
clearly 23
recognized 23
that 23
i 23
must 23
hold 23
this 23
notion 23
from 23
some 23
nature 23
which 23
in 23
reality 23
was 23
more 23
perfect 23
as 23
for 23
the 23
thoughts 23
of 23
many 23
other 23
objects 23
external 23
to 23
me 23
as 23
of 23
the 23
sky 23
the 23
earth 23
light 23
heat 23
and 23
a 23
thousand 23
more 23
i 23
was 23
less 23
at 23
a 23
loss 23
to 23
know 23
whence 23
these 23
came 23
for 23
since 23
i 23
remarked 23
in 23
them 23
nothing 23
which 23
seemed 23
to 23
render 23
them 23
superior 23
to 23
myself 23
i 23
could 23
believe 23
that 23
if 23
these 23
were 23
true 23
they 23
were 23
dependencies 23
on 23
my 23
own 23
nature 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
it 23
possessed 23
a 23
certain 23
perfection 23
and 23
if 23
they 23
were 23
false 23
that 23
i 23
held 23
them 23
from 23
nothing 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
say 23
that 23
they 23
were 23
in 23
me 23
because 23
of 23
a 23
certain 23
imperfection 23
of 23
my 23
nature 23
but 23
this 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
the 23
case 23
withthe 23
idea 23
of 23
a 23
nature 23
more 23
perfect 23
than 23
myself 23
for 23
to 23
receive 23
it 23
from 23
nothing 23
was 23
a 23
thing 23
manifestly 23
impossible 23
and 23
because 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
less 23
repugnant 23
that 23
the 23
more 23
perfect 23
should 23
be 23
an 23
effect 23
of 23
and 23
dependence 23
on 23
the 23
less 23
perfect 23
than 23
that 23
something 23
should 23
proceed 23
from 23
nothing 23
it 23
was 23
equally 23
impossible 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
hold 23
it 23
from 23
myself 23
accordingly 23
it 23
but 23
remained 23
that 23
it 23
had 23
been 23
placed 23
in 23
me 23
by 23
a 23
nature 23
which 23
was 23
in 23
reality 23
more 23
perfect 23
than 23
mine 23
and 23
which 23
even 23
possessed 23
within 23
itself 23
all 23
the 23
perfections 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
form 23
any 23
idea 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
say 23
in 23
a 23
single 23
word 23
which 23
was 23
god 23
and 23
to 23
this 23
i 23
added 23
that 23
since 23
i 23
knew 23
some 23
perfections 23
which 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
possess 23
i 23
was 23
not 23
the 23
only 23
being 23
in 23
existence 23
i 23
will 23
here 23
with 23
your 23
permission 23
freely 23
use 23
the 23
terms 23
of 23
the 23
schools 23
but 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
that 23
there 23
was 23
of 23
necessity 23
some 23
other 23
more 23
perfect 23
being 23
upon 23
whom 23
i 23
was 23
dependent 23
and 23
from 23
whom 23
i 23
had 23
received 23
all 23
that 23
i 23
possessed 23
for 23
if 23
i 23
had 23
existed 23
alone 23
and 23
independently 23
of 23
every 23
other 23
being 23
so 23
as 23
to 23
have 23
had 23
from 23
myself 23
all 23
the 23
perfection 23
however 23
little 23
which 23
i 23
actually 23
possessed 23
i 23
should 23
have 23
been 23
able 23
for 23
the 23
same 23
reason 23
to 23
have 23
had 23
from 23
myself 23
the 23
whole 23
remainder 23
of 23
perfection 23
of 23
the 23
want 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
was 23
conscious 23
and 23
thus 23
could 23
of 23
myself 23
have 23
become 23
infinite 23
eternal 23
immutable 23
omniscient 23
allpowerful 23
and 23
in 23
fine 23
have 23
possessed 23
all 23
the 23
perfections 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
recognize 23
in 23
god 23
for 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
know 23
the 23
nature 23
of 23
god 23
whose 23
existence 23
has 23
been 23
established 23
by 23
the 23
preceding 23
reasonings 23
as 23
far 23
as 23
my 23
own 23
nature 23
permitted 23
i 23
had 23
only 23
to 23
consider 23
in 23
reference 23
to 23
all 23
the 23
properties 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
found 23
in 23
my 23
mind 23
some 23
idea 23
whether 23
their 23
possession 23
was 23
a 23
mark 23
of 23
perfection 23
and 23
i 23
was 23
assured 23
that 23
no 23
one 23
which 23
indicated 23
any 23
imperfection 23
was 23
in 23
him 23
and 23
that 23
none 23
of 23
the 23
rest 23
was 23
awanting 23
thus 23
i 23
perceived 23
that 23
doubt 23
inconstancy 23
sadness 23
and 23
such 23
like 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
found 23
in 23
god 23
since 23
i 23
myself 23
would 23
have 23
been 23
happy 23
to 23
be 23
free 23
from 23
them 23
besides 23
i 23
had 23
ideas 23
of 23
many 23
sensible 23
and 23
corporeal 23
things 23
for 23
although 23
i 23
might 23
suppose 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
dreaming 23
and 23
that 23
all 23
which 23
i 23
saw 23
or 23
imagined 23
was 23
false 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
nevertheless 23
deny 23
that 23
the 23
ideas 23
were 23
in 23
reality 23
in 23
my 23
thoughts 23
but 23
because 23
i 23
had 23
already 23
very 23
clearly 23
recognized 23
in 23
myself 23
that 23
the 23
intelligent 23
nature 23
is 23
distinct 23
from 23
the 23
corporeal 23
and 23
as 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
all 23
composition 23
is 23
an 23
evidence 23
of 23
dependency 23
and 23
that 23
a 23
state 23
of 23
dependency 23
is 23
manifestly 23
a 23
state 23
of 23
imperfection 23
i 23
therefore 23
determined 23
that 23
it 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
a 23
perfection 23
in 23
god 23
to 23
be 23
compounded 23
of 23
these 23
two 23
natures 23
and 23
that 23
consequently 23
he 23
was 23
not 23
so 23
compounded 23
but 23
that 23
if 23
there 23
were 23
any 23
bodies 23
in 23
the 23
world 23
or 23
even 23
any 23
intelligences 23
or 23
other 23
natures 23
that 23
were 23
not 23
wholly 23
perfect 23
their 23
existence 23
depended 23
on 23
his 23
power 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
way 23
that 23
they 23
could 23
not 23
subsist 23
without 23
him 23
for 23
a 23
single 23
moment 23
i 23
was 23
disposed 23
straightway 23
to 23
search 23
for 23
other 23
truths 23
and 23
when 23
i 23
had 23
represented 23
to 23
myself 23
the 23
object 23
of 23
the 23
geometers 23
which 23
i 23
conceived 23
to 23
be 23
a 23
continuous 23
body 23
or 23
a 23
space 23
indefinitely 23
extended 23
in 23
length 23
breadth 23
and 23
height 23
or 23
depth 23
divisible 23
into 23
divers 23
parts 23
which 23
admit 23
of 23
different 23
figures 23
and 23
sizes 23
and 23
of 23
being 23
moved 23
or 23
transposed 23
in 23
all 23
manner 23
of 23
ways 23
for 23
all 23
this 23
the 23
geometers 23
suppose 23
to 23
be 23
in 23
the 23
object 23
they 23
contemplate 23
i 23
went 23
over 23
some 23
of 23
their 23
simplest 23
demonstrations 23
and 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
i 23
observed 23
that 23
the 23
great 23
certitude 23
which 23
by 23
common 23
consent 23
is 23
accorded 23
to 23
these 23
demonstrations 23
is 23
founded 23
solely 23
upon 23
this 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
clearly 23
conceived 23
in 23
accordance 23
with 23
the 23
rules 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
laid 23
down 23
in 23
the 23
next 23
place 23
i 23
perceived 23
that 23
there 23
was 23
nothing 23
at 23
all 23
in 23
these 23
demonstrations 23
which 23
could 23
assure 23
me 23
of 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
their 23
object 23
thus 23
for 23
example 23
supposing 23
a 23
triangle 23
to 23
be 23
given 23
i 23
distinctly 23
perceived 23
that 23
its 23
three 23
angles 23
were 23
necessarily 23
equal 23
to 23
two 23
right 23
angles 23
but 23
i 23
did 23
not 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
perceive 23
anything 23
which 23
could 23
assure 23
me 23
that 23
any 23
triangle 23
existed 23
while 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
recurring 23
to 23
the 23
examination 23
of 23
the 23
idea 23
of 23
a 23
perfect 23
being 23
i 23
found 23
that 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
the 23
being 23
was 23
comprised 23
in 23
the 23
idea 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
that 23
the 23
equality 23
of 23
its 23
three 23
angles 23
to 23
two 23
right 23
angles 23
is 23
comprised 23
in 23
the 23
idea 23
of 23
a 23
triangle 23
or 23
as 23
in 23
the 23
idea 23
of 23
a 23
sphere 23
the 23
equidistance 23
of 23
all 23
points 23
on 23
its 23
surface 23
from 23
the 23
center 23
or 23
even 23
still 23
more 23
clearly 23
and 23
that 23
consequently 23
it 23
is 23
at 23
least 23
as 23
certain 23
that 23
god 23
who 23
is 23
this 23
perfect 23
being 23
is 23
or 23
exists 23
as 23
any 23
demonstration 23
of 23
geometry 23
can 23
be 23
but 23
the 23
reason 23
which 23
leads 23
many 23
to 23
persuade 23
them 23
selves 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
a 23
difficulty 23
in 23
knowing 23
this 23
truth 23
and 23
even 23
also 23
in 23
knowing 23
what 23
their 23
mind 23
really 23
is 23
is 23
that 23
they 23
never 23
raise 23
their 23
thoughts 23
above 23
sensible 23
objects 23
and 23
are 23
so 23
accustomed 23
to 23
consider 23
nothing 23
except 23
by 23
way 23
of 23
imagination 23
which 23
is 23
a 23
mode 23
of 23
thinking 23
limited 23
to 23
material 23
objects 23
that 23
all 23
that 23
is 23
not 23
imaginable 23
seems 23
to 23
them 23
not 23
intelligible 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
this 23
is 23
sufficiently 23
manifest 23
from 23
the 23
single 23
circumstance 23
that 23
the 23
philosophers 23
of 23
the 23
schools 23
accept 23
as 23
a 23
maxim 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
in 23
the 23
understanding 23
which 23
was 23
not 23
previously 23
in 23
the 23
senses 23
in 23
which 23
however 23
it 23
is 23
certain 23
that 23
the 23
ideas 23
of 23
god 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
soul 23
have 23
never 23
been 23
and 23
it 23
appears 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
they 23
who 23
make 23
use 23
of 23
their 23
imagination 23
to 23
comprehend 23
these 23
ideas 23
do 23
exactly 23
the 23
some 23
thing 23
as 23
if 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
hear 23
sounds 23
or 23
smell 23
odors 23
they 23
strove 23
to 23
avail 23
themselves 23
of 23
their 23
eyes 23
unless 23
indeed 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
this 23
difference 23
that 23
the 23
sense 23
of 23
sight 23
does 23
not 23
afford 23
us 23
an 23
inferior 23
assurance 23
to 23
those 23
of 23
smell 23
or 23
hearing 23
in 23
place 23
of 23
which 23
neither 23
our 23
imagination 23
nor 23
our 23
senses 23
can 23
give 23
us 23
assurance 23
of 23
anything 23
unless 23
our 23
understanding 23
intervene 23
finally 23
if 23
there 23
be 23
still 23
persons 23
who 23
are 23
not 23
sufficiently 23
persuaded 23
of 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
god 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
soul 23
by 23
the 23
reasons 23
i 23
have 23
adduced 23
i 23
am 23
desirous 23
that 23
they 23
should 23
know 23
that 23
all 23
the 23
other 23
propositions 23
of 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
which 23
they 23
deem 23
themselves 23
perhaps 23
more 23
assured 23
as 23
that 23
we 23
have 23
a 23
body 23
and 23
that 23
there 23
exist 23
stars 23
and 23
an 23
earth 23
and 23
such 23
like 23
are 23
less 23
certain 23
for 23
although 23
we 23
have 23
a 23
moral 23
assurance 23
of 23
these 23
things 23
which 23
is 23
so 23
strong 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
an 23
appearance 23
of 23
extravagance 23
in 23
doubting 23
of 23
their 23
existence 23
yet 23
at 23
the 23
same 23
time 23
no 23
one 23
unless 23
his 23
intellect 23
is 23
impaired 23
can 23
deny 23
when 23
the 23
question 23
relates 23
to 23
a 23
metaphysical 23
certitude 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
sufficient 23
reason 23
to 23
exclude 23
entire 23
assurance 23
in 23
the 23
observation 23
that 23
when 23
asleep 23
we 23
can 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
imagine 23
ourselves 23
possessed 23
of 23
another 23
body 23
and 23
that 23
we 23
see 23
other 23
stars 23
and 23
another 23
earth 23
when 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
of 23
the 23
kind 23
for 23
how 23
do 23
we 23
know 23
that 23
the 23
thoughts 23
which 23
occur 23
in 23
dreaming 23
are 23
false 23
rather 23
than 23
those 23
other 23
which 23
we 23
experience 23
when 23
awake 23
since 23
the 23
former 23
are 23
often 23
not 23
less 23
vivid 23
and 23
distinct 23
than 23
the 23
latter 23
and 23
though 23
men 23
of 23
the 23
highest 23
genius 23
study 23
this 23
question 23
as 23
long 23
as 23
they 23
please 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
believe 23
that 23
they 23
will 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
give 23
any 23
reason 23
which 23
can 23
be 23
sufficient 23
to 23
remove 23
this 23
doubt 23
unless 23
they 23
presuppose 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
god 23
for 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
even 23
the 23
principle 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
taken 23
as 23
a 23
rule 23
viz 23
that 23
all 23
the 23
things 23
which 23
we 23
clearly 23
and 23
distinctly 23
conceive 23
are 23
true 23
is 23
certain 23
only 23
because 23
god 23
is 23
or 23
exists 23
and 23
because 23
he 23
is 23
a 23
perfect 23
being 23
and 23
because 23
all 23
that 23
we 23
possess 23
is 23
derived 23
from 23
him 23
whence 23
it 23
follows 23
that 23
our 23
ideas 23
or 23
notions 23
which 23
to 23
the 23
extent 23
of 23
their 23
clearness 23
and 23
distinctness 23
are 23
real 23
and 23
proceed 23
from 23
god 23
must 23
to 23
that 23
extent 23
be 23
true 23
accordingly 23
whereas 23
we 23
not 23
infrequently 23
have 23
ideas 23
or 23
notions 23
in 23
which 23
some 23
falsity 23
is 23
contained 23
this 23
can 23
only 23
be 23
the 23
case 23
with 23
such 23
as 23
are 23
to 23
some 23
extent 23
confused 23
and 23
obscure 23
and 23
in 23
this 23
proceed 23
from 23
nothing 23
participate 23
of 23
negation 23
that 23
is 23
exist 23
in 23
us 23
thus 23
confused 23
because 23
we 23
are 23
not 23
wholly 23
perfect 23
and 23
it 23
is 23
evident 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
less 23
repugnant 23
that 23
falsity 23
or 23
imperfection 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
imperfection 23
should 23
proceed 23
from 23
god 23
than 23
that 23
truth 23
or 23
perfection 23
should 23
proceed 23
from 23
nothing 23
but 23
if 23
we 23
did 23
not 23
know 23
that 23
all 23
which 23
we 23
possess 23
of 23
real 23
and 23
true 23
proceeds 23
from 23
a 23
perfect 23
and 23
infinite 23
being 23
however 23
clear 23
and 23
distinct 23
our 23
ideas 23
might 23
be 23
we 23
should 23
have 23
no 23
ground 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
for 23
the 23
assurance 23
that 23
they 23
possessed 23
the 23
perfection 23
of 23
being 23
true 23
but 23
after 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
god 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
soul 23
has 23
rendered 23
us 23
certain 23
of 23
this 23
rule 23
we 23
can 23
easily 23
understand 23
that 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
the 23
thoughts 23
we 23
experience 23
when 23
awake 23
ought 23
not 23
in 23
the 23
slightest 23
degree 23
to 23
be 23
called 23
in 23
question 23
on 23
account 23
of 23
the 23
illusions 23
of 23
our 23
dreams 23
for 23
if 23
it 23
happened 23
that 23
an 23
individual 23
even 23
when 23
asleep 23
had 23
some 23
very 23
distinct 23
idea 23
as 23
for 23
example 23
if 23
a 23
geometer 23
should 23
discover 23
some 23
new 23
demonstration 23
the 23
circumstance 23
of 23
his 23
being 23
asleep 23
would 23
not 23
militate 23
against 23
its 23
truth 23
and 23
as 23
for 23
the 23
most 23
ordinary 23
error 23
of 23
our 23
dreams 23
which 23
consists 23
in 23
their 23
representing 23
to 23
us 23
various 23
objects 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
as 23
our 23
external 23
senses 23
this 23
is 23
not 23
prejudicial 23
since 23
it 23
leads 23
us 23
very 23
properly 23
to 23
suspect 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
the 23
ideas 23
of 23
sense 23
for 23
we 23
are 23
not 23
infrequently 23
deceived 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
manner 23
when 23
awake 23
as 23
when 23
persons 23
in 23
the 23
jaundice 23
see 23
all 23
objects 23
yellow 23
or 23
when 23
the 23
stars 23
or 23
bodies 23
at 23
a 23
great 23
distance 23
appear 23
to 23
us 23
much 23
smaller 23
than 23
they 23
are 23
for 23
in 23
fine 23
whether 23
awake 23
or 23
asleep 23
we 23
ought 23
never 23
to 23
allow 23
ourselves 23
to 23
be 23
persuaded 23
of 23
the 23
truth 23
of 23
anything 23
unless 23
on 23
the 23
evidence 23
of 23
our 23
reason 23
and 23
it 23
must 23
be 23
noted 23
that 23
i 23
say 23
of 23
our 23
reason 23
and 23
not 23
of 23
our 23
imagination 23
or 23
of 23
our 23
senses 23
thus 23
for 23
example 23
although 23
we 23
very 23
clearly 23
see 23
the 23
sun 23
we 23
ought 23
not 23
therefore 23
to 23
determine 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
only 23
of 23
the 23
size 23
which 23
our 23
sense 23
of 23
sight 23
presents 23
and 23
we 23
may 23
very 23
distinctly 23
imagine 23
the 23
head 23
of 23
a 23
lion 23
joined 23
to 23
the 23
body 23
of 23
a 23
goat 23
without 23
being 23
therefore 23
shut 23
up 23
to 23
the 23
conclusion 23
that 23
a 23
chimaera 23
exists 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
a 23
dictate 23
of 23
reason 23
that 23
what 23
we 23
thus 23
see 23
or 23
imagine 23
is 23
in 23
reality 23
existent 23
but 23
it 23
plainly 23
tells 23
us 23
that 23
all 23
our 23
ideas 23
or 23
notions 23
contain 23
in 23
them 23
some 23
truth 23
for 23
otherwise 23
it 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
that 23
god 23
who 23
is 23
wholly 23
perfect 23
and 23
veracious 23
should 23
have 23
placed 23
them 23
in 23
us 23
and 23
because 23
our 23
reasonings 23
are 23
never 23
so 23
clear 23
or 23
so 23
complete 23
during 23
sleep 23
as 23
when 23
we 23
are 23
awake 23
although 23
sometimes 23
the 23
acts 23
of 23
our 23
imagination 23
are 23
then 23
as 23
lively 23
and 23
distinct 23
if 23
not 23
more 23
so 23
than 23
in 23
our 23
waking 23
moments 23
reason 23
further 23
dictates 23
that 23
since 23
all 23
our 23
thoughts 23
cannot 23
be 23
true 23
because 23
of 23
our 23
partial 23
imperfection 23
those 23
possessing 23
truth 23
must 23
infallibly 23
be 23
found 23
in 23
the 23
experience 23
of 23
our 23
waking 23
moments 23
rather 23
than 23
in 23
that 23
of 23
our 23
dreams 23
part 23
v 23
i 23
would 23
here 23
willingly 23
have 23
proceeded 23
to 23
exhibit 23
the 23
whole 23
chain 23
of 23
truths 23
which 23
i 23
deduced 23
from 23
these 23
primary 23
but 23
as 23
with 23
a 23
view 23
to 23
this 23
it 23
would 23
have 23
been 23
necessary 23
now 23
to 23
treat 23
of 23
many 23
questions 23
in 23
dispute 23
among 23
the 23
earned 23
with 23
whom 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
wish 23
to 23
be 23
embroiled 23
i 23
believe 23
that 23
it 23
will 23
be 23
better 23
for 23
me 23
to 23
refrain 23
from 23
this 23
exposition 23
and 23
only 23
mention 23
in 23
general 23
what 23
these 23
truths 23
are 23
that 23
the 23
more 23
judicious 23
may 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
determine 23
whether 23
a 23
more 23
special 23
account 23
of 23
them 23
would 23
conduce 23
to 23
the 23
public 23
advantage 23
i 23
have 23
ever 23
remained 23
firm 23
in 23
my 23
original 23
resolution 23
to 23
suppose 23
no 23
other 23
principle 23
than 23
that 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
recently 23
availed 23
myself 23
in 23
demonstrating 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
god 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
soul 23
and 23
to 23
accept 23
as 23
true 23
nothing 23
that 23
did 23
not 23
appear 23
to 23
me 23
more 23
clear 23
and 23
certain 23
than 23
the 23
demonstrations 23
of 23
the 23
geometers 23
had 23
formerly 23
appeared 23
and 23
yet 23
i 23
venture 23
to 23
state 23
that 23
not 23
only 23
have 23
i 23
found 23
means 23
to 23
satisfy 23
myself 23
in 23
a 23
short 23
time 23
on 23
all 23
the 23
principal 23
difficulties 23
which 23
are 23
usually 23
treated 23
of 23
in 23
philosophy 23
but 23
i 23
have 23
also 23
observed 23
certain 23
laws 23
established 23
in 23
nature 23
by 23
god 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
manner 23
and 23
of 23
which 23
he 23
has 23
impressed 23
on 23
our 23
minds 23
such 23
notions 23
that 23
after 23
we 23
have 23
reflected 23
sufficiently 23
upon 23
these 23
we 23
cannot 23
doubt 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
accurately 23
observed 23
in 23
all 23
that 23
exists 23
or 23
takes 23
place 23
in 23
the 23
world 23
and 23
farther 23
by 23
considering 23
the 23
concatenation 23
of 23
these 23
laws 23
it 23
appears 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
discovered 23
many 23
truths 23
more 23
useful 23
and 23
more 23
important 23
than 23
all 23
i 23
had 23
before 23
learned 23
or 23
even 23
had 23
expected 23
to 23
learn 23
but 23
because 23
i 23
have 23
essayed 23
to 23
expound 23
the 23
chief 23
of 23
these 23
discoveries 23
in 23
a 23
treatise 23
which 23
certain 23
considerations 23
prevent 23
me 23
from 23
publishing 23
i 23
cannot 23
make 23
the 23
results 23
known 23
more 23
conveniently 23
than 23
by 23
here 23
giving 23
a 23
summary 23
of 23
the 23
contents 23
of 23
this 23
treatise 23
it 23
was 23
my 23
design 23
to 23
comprise 23
in 23
it 23
all 23
that 23
before 23
i 23
set 23
myself 23
to 23
write 23
it 23
i 23
thought 23
i 23
knew 23
of 23
the 23
nature 23
of 23
material 23
objects 23
but 23
like 23
the 23
painters 23
who 23
finding 23
themselves 23
unable 23
to 23
represent 23
equally 23
well 23
on 23
a 23
plain 23
surface 23
all 23
the 23
different 23
faces 23
of 23
a 23
solid 23
body 23
select 23
one 23
of 23
the 23
chief 23
on 23
which 23
alone 23
they 23
make 23
the 23
light 23
fall 23
and 23
throwing 23
the 23
rest 23
into 23
the 23
shade 23
allow 23
them 23
to 23
appear 23
only 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
they 23
can 23
be 23
seen 23
while 23
looking 23
at 23
the 23
principal 23
one 23
so 23
fearing 23
lest 23
i 23
should 23
not 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
compense 23
in 23
my 23
discourse 23
all 23
that 23
was 23
in 23
my 23
mind 23
i 23
resolved 23
to 23
expound 23
singly 23
though 23
at 23
considerable 23
length 23
my 23
opinions 23
regarding 23
light 23
then 23
to 23
take 23
the 23
opportunity 23
of 23
adding 23
something 23
on 23
the 23
sun 23
and 23
the 23
fixed 23
stars 23
since 23
light 23
almost 23
wholly 23
proceeds 23
from 23
them 23
on 23
the 23
heavens 23
since 23
they 23
transmit 23
it 23
on 23
the 23
planets 23
comets 23
and 23
earth 23
since 23
they 23
reflect 23
it 23
and 23
particularly 23
on 23
all 23
the 23
bodies 23
that 23
are 23
upon 23
the 23
earth 23
since 23
they 23
are 23
either 23
colored 23
or 23
transparent 23
or 23
luminous 23
and 23
finally 23
on 23
man 23
since 23
he 23
is 23
the 23
spectator 23
of 23
these 23
objects 23
further 23
to 23
enable 23
me 23
to 23
cast 23
this 23
variety 23
of 23
subjects 23
somewhat 23
into 23
the 23
shade 23
and 23
to 23
express 23
my 23
judgment 23
regarding 23
them 23
with 23
greater 23
freedom 23
without 23
being 23
necessitated 23
to 23
adopt 23
or 23
refute 23
the 23
opinions 23
of 23
the 23
learned 23
i 23
resolved 23
to 23
leave 23
all 23
the 23
people 23
here 23
to 23
their 23
disputes 23
and 23
to 23
speak 23
only 23
of 23
what 23
would 23
happen 23
in 23
a 23
new 23
world 23
if 23
god 23
were 23
now 23
to 23
create 23
somewhere 23
in 23
the 23
imaginary 23
spaces 23
matter 23
sufficient 23
to 23
compose 23
one 23
and 23
were 23
to 23
agitate 23
variously 23
and 23
confusedly 23
the 23
different 23
parts 23
of 23
this 23
matter 23
so 23
that 23
there 23
resulted 23
a 23
chaos 23
as 23
disordered 23
as 23
the 23
poets 23
ever 23
feigned 23
and 23
after 23
that 23
did 23
nothing 23
more 23
than 23
lend 23
his 23
ordinary 23
concurrence 23
to 23
nature 23
and 23
allow 23
her 23
to 23
act 23
in 23
accordance 23
with 23
the 23
laws 23
which 23
he 23
had 23
established 23
on 23
this 23
supposition 23
i 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
described 23
this 23
matter 23
and 23
essayed 23
to 23
represent 23
it 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
manner 23
that 23
to 23
my 23
mind 23
there 23
can 23
be 23
nothing 23
clearer 23
and 23
more 23
intelligible 23
except 23
what 23
has 23
been 23
recently 23
said 23
regarding 23
god 23
and 23
the 23
soul 23
for 23
i 23
even 23
expressly 23
supposed 23
that 23
it 23
possessed 23
none 23
of 23
those 23
forms 23
or 23
qualities 23
which 23
are 23
so 23
debated 23
in 23
the 23
schools 23
nor 23
in 23
general 23
anything 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
which 23
is 23
not 23
so 23
natural 23
to 23
our 23
minds 23
that 23
no 23
one 23
can 23
so 23
much 23
as 23
imagine 23
himself 23
ignorant 23
of 23
it 23
besides 23
i 23
have 23
pointed 23
out 23
what 23
are 23
the 23
laws 23
of 23
nature 23
and 23
with 23
no 23
other 23
principle 23
upon 23
which 23
to 23
found 23
my 23
reasonings 23
except 23
the 23
infinite 23
perfection 23
of 23
god 23
i 23
endeavored 23
to 23
demonstrate 23
all 23
those 23
about 23
which 23
there 23
could 23
be 23
any 23
room 23
for 23
doubt 23
and 23
to 23
prove 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
such 23
that 23
even 23
if 23
god 23
had 23
created 23
more 23
worlds 23
there 23
could 23
have 23
been 23
none 23
in 23
which 23
these 23
laws 23
were 23
not 23
observed 23
thereafter 23
i 23
showed 23
how 23
the 23
greatest 23
part 23
of 23
the 23
matter 23
of 23
this 23
chaos 23
must 23
in 23
accordance 23
with 23
these 23
laws 23
dispose 23
and 23
arrange 23
itself 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
way 23
as 23
to 23
present 23
the 23
appearance 23
of 23
heavens 23
how 23
in 23
the 23
meantime 23
some 23
of 23
its 23
parts 23
must 23
compose 23
an 23
earth 23
and 23
some 23
planets 23
and 23
comets 23
and 23
others 23
a 23
sun 23
and 23
fixed 23
stars 23
and 23
making 23
a 23
digression 23
at 23
this 23
stage 23
on 23
the 23
subject 23
of 23
light 23
i 23
expounded 23
at 23
considerable 23
length 23
what 23
the 23
nature 23
of 23
that 23
light 23
must 23
be 23
which 23
is 23
found 23
in 23
the 23
sun 23
and 23
the 23
stars 23
and 23
how 23
thence 23
in 23
an 23
instant 23
of 23
time 23
it 23
traverses 23
the 23
immense 23
spaces 23
of 23
the 23
heavens 23
and 23
how 23
from 23
the 23
planets 23
and 23
comets 23
it 23
is 23
reflected 23
towards 23
the 23
earth 23
to 23
this 23
i 23
likewise 23
added 23
much 23
respecting 23
the 23
substance 23
the 23
situation 23
the 23
motions 23
and 23
all 23
the 23
different 23
qualities 23
of 23
these 23
heavens 23
and 23
stars 23
so 23
that 23
i 23
thought 23
i 23
had 23
said 23
enough 23
respecting 23
them 23
to 23
show 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
nothing 23
observable 23
in 23
the 23
heavens 23
or 23
stars 23
of 23
our 23
system 23
that 23
must 23
not 23
or 23
at 23
least 23
may 23
not 23
appear 23
precisely 23
alike 23
in 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
system 23
which 23
i 23
described 23
i 23
came 23
next 23
to 23
speak 23
of 23
the 23
earth 23
in 23
particular 23
and 23
to 23
show 23
how 23
even 23
though 23
i 23
had 23
expressly 23
supposed 23
that 23
god 23
had 23
given 23
no 23
weight 23
to 23
the 23
matter 23
of 23
which 23
it 23
is 23
composed 23
this 23
should 23
not 23
prevent 23
all 23
its 23
parts 23
from 23
tending 23
exactly 23
to 23
its 23
center 23
how 23
with 23
water 23
and 23
air 23
on 23
its 23
surface 23
the 23
disposition 23
of 23
the 23
heavens 23
and 23
heavenly 23
bodies 23
more 23
especially 23
of 23
the 23
moon 23
must 23
cause 23
a 23
flow 23
and 23
ebb 23
like 23
in 23
all 23
its 23
circumstances 23
to 23
that 23
observed 23
in 23
our 23
seas 23
as 23
also 23
a 23
certain 23
current 23
both 23
of 23
water 23
and 23
air 23
from 23
east 23
to 23
west 23
such 23
as 23
is 23
likewise 23
observed 23
between 23
the 23
tropics 23
how 23
the 23
mountains 23
seas 23
fountains 23
and 23
rivers 23
might 23
naturally 23
be 23
formed 23
in 23
it 23
and 23
the 23
metals 23
produced 23
in 23
the 23
mines 23
and 23
the 23
plants 23
grow 23
in 23
the 23
fields 23
and 23
in 23
general 23
how 23
all 23
the 23
bodies 23
which 23
are 23
commonly 23
denominated 23
mixed 23
or 23
composite 23
might 23
be 23
generated 23
and 23
among 23
other 23
things 23
in 23
the 23
discoveries 23
alluded 23
to 23
inasmuch 23
as 23
besides 23
the 23
stars 23
i 23
knew 23
nothing 23
except 23
fire 23
which 23
produces 23
light 23
i 23
spared 23
no 23
pains 23
to 23
set 23
forth 23
all 23
that 23
pertains 23
to 23
its 23
nature 23
the 23
manner 23
of 23
its 23
production 23
and 23
support 23
and 23
to 23
explain 23
how 23
heat 23
is 23
sometimes 23
found 23
without 23
light 23
and 23
light 23
without 23
heat 23
to 23
show 23
how 23
it 23
can 23
induce 23
various 23
colors 23
upon 23
different 23
bodies 23
and 23
other 23
diverse 23
qualities 23
how 23
it 23
reduces 23
some 23
to 23
a 23
liquid 23
state 23
and 23
hardens 23
others 23
how 23
it 23
can 23
consume 23
almost 23
all 23
bodies 23
or 23
convert 23
them 23
into 23
ashes 23
and 23
smoke 23
and 23
finally 23
how 23
from 23
these 23
ashes 23
by 23
the 23
mere 23
intensity 23
of 23
its 23
action 23
it 23
forms 23
glass 23
for 23
as 23
this 23
transmutation 23
of 23
ashes 23
into 23
glass 23
appeared 23
to 23
me 23
as 23
wonderful 23
as 23
any 23
other 23
in 23
nature 23
i 23
took 23
a 23
special 23
pleasure 23
in 23
describing 23
it 23
i 23
was 23
not 23
however 23
disposed 23
from 23
these 23
circumstances 23
to 23
conclude 23
that 23
this 23
world 23
had 23
been 23
created 23
in 23
the 23
manner 23
i 23
described 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
much 23
more 23
likely 23
that 23
god 23
made 23
it 23
at 23
the 23
first 23
such 23
as 23
it 23
was 23
to 23
be 23
but 23
this 23
is 23
certain 23
and 23
an 23
opinion 23
commonly 23
received 23
among 23
theologians 23
that 23
the 23
action 23
by 23
which 23
he 23
now 23
sustains 23
it 23
is 23
the 23
same 23
with 23
that 23
by 23
which 23
he 23
originally 23
created 23
it 23
so 23
that 23
even 23
although 23
he 23
had 23
from 23
the 23
beginning 23
given 23
it 23
no 23
other 23
form 23
than 23
that 23
of 23
chaos 23
provided 23
only 23
he 23
had 23
established 23
certain 23
laws 23
of 23
nature 23
and 23
had 23
lent 23
it 23
his 23
concurrence 23
to 23
enable 23
it 23
to 23
act 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
wont 23
to 23
do 23
it 23
may 23
be 23
believed 23
without 23
discredit 23
to 23
the 23
miracle 23
of 23
creation 23
that 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
alone 23
things 23
purely 23
material 23
might 23
in 23
course 23
of 23
time 23
have 23
become 23
such 23
as 23
we 23
observe 23
them 23
at 23
present 23
and 23
their 23
nature 23
is 23
much 23
more 23
easily 23
conceived 23
when 23
they 23
are 23
beheld 23
coming 23
in 23
this 23
manner 23
gradually 23
into 23
existence 23
than 23
when 23
they 23
are 23
only 23
considered 23
as 23
produced 23
at 23
once 23
in 23
a 23
finished 23
and 23
perfect 23
state 23
from 23
the 23
description 23
of 23
inanimate 23
bodies 23
and 23
plants 23
i 23
passed 23
to 23
animals 23
and 23
particularly 23
to 23
man 23
but 23
since 23
i 23
had 23
not 23
as 23
yet 23
sufficient 23
knowledge 23
to 23
enable 23
me 23
to 23
treat 23
of 23
these 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
manner 23
as 23
of 23
the 23
rest 23
that 23
is 23
to 23
say 23
by 23
deducing 23
effects 23
from 23
their 23
causes 23
and 23
by 23
showing 23
from 23
what 23
elements 23
and 23
in 23
what 23
manner 23
nature 23
must 23
produce 23
them 23
i 23
remained 23
satisfied 23
with 23
the 23
supposition 23
that 23
god 23
formed 23
the 23
body 23
of 23
man 23
wholly 23
like 23
to 23
one 23
of 23
ours 23
as 23
well 23
in 23
the 23
external 23
shape 23
of 23
the 23
members 23
as 23
in 23
the 23
internal 23
conformation 23
of 23
the 23
organs 23
of 23
the 23
same 23
matter 23
with 23
that 23
i 23
had 23
described 23
and 23
at 23
first 23
placed 23
in 23
it 23
no 23
rational 23
soul 23
nor 23
any 23
other 23
principle 23
in 23
room 23
of 23
the 23
vegetative 23
or 23
sensitive 23
soul 23
beyond 23
kindling 23
in 23
the 23
heart 23
one 23
of 23
those 23
fires 23
without 23
light 23
such 23
as 23
i 23
had 23
already 23
described 23
and 23
which 23
i 23
thought 23
was 23
not 23
different 23
from 23
the 23
heat 23
in 23
hay 23
that 23
has 23
been 23
heaped 23
together 23
before 23
it 23
is 23
dry 23
or 23
that 23
which 23
causes 23
fermentation 23
in 23
new 23
wines 23
before 23
they 23
are 23
run 23
clear 23
of 23
the 23
fruit 23
for 23
when 23
i 23
examined 23
the 23
kind 23
of 23
functions 23
which 23
might 23
as 23
consequences 23
of 23
this 23
supposition 23
exist 23
in 23
this 23
body 23
i 23
found 23
precisely 23
all 23
those 23
which 23
may 23
exist 23
in 23
us 23
independently 23
of 23
all 23
power 23
of 23
thinking 23
and 23
consequently 23
without 23
being 23
in 23
any 23
measure 23
owing 23
to 23
the 23
soul 23
in 23
other 23
words 23
to 23
that 23
part 23
of 23
us 23
which 23
is 23
distinct 23
from 23
the 23
body 23
and 23
of 23
which 23
it 23
has 23
been 23
said 23
above 23
that 23
the 23
nature 23
distinctively 23
consists 23
in 23
thinking 23
functions 23
in 23
which 23
the 23
animals 23
void 23
of 23
reason 23
may 23
be 23
said 23
wholly 23
to 23
resemble 23
us 23
but 23
among 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
discover 23
any 23
of 23
those 23
that 23
as 23
dependent 23
on 23
thought 23
alone 23
belong 23
to 23
us 23
as 23
men 23
while 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
i 23
did 23
afterwards 23
discover 23
these 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
i 23
supposed 23
god 23
to 23
have 23
created 23
a 23
rational 23
soul 23
and 23
to 23
have 23
annexed 23
it 23
to 23
this 23
body 23
in 23
a 23
particular 23
manner 23
which 23
i 23
described 23
but 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
show 23
how 23
i 23
there 23
handled 23
this 23
matter 23
i 23
mean 23
here 23
to 23
give 23
the 23
explication 23
of 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
arteries 23
which 23
as 23
the 23
first 23
and 23
most 23
general 23
motion 23
observed 23
in 23
animals 23
will 23
afford 23
the 23
means 23
of 23
readily 23
determining 23
what 23
should 23
be 23
thought 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
rest 23
and 23
that 23
there 23
may 23
be 23
less 23
difficulty 23
in 23
understanding 23
what 23
i 23
am 23
about 23
to 23
say 23
on 23
this 23
subject 23
i 23
advise 23
those 23
who 23
are 23
not 23
versed 23
in 23
anatomy 23
before 23
they 23
commence 23
the 23
perusal 23
of 23
these 23
observations 23
to 23
take 23
the 23
trouble 23
of 23
getting 23
dissected 23
in 23
their 23
presence 23
the 23
heart 23
of 23
some 23
large 23
animal 23
possessed 23
of 23
lungs 23
for 23
this 23
is 23
throughout 23
sufficiently 23
like 23
the 23
human 23
and 23
to 23
have 23
shown 23
to 23
them 23
its 23
two 23
ventricles 23
or 23
cavities 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
that 23
in 23
the 23
right 23
side 23
with 23
which 23
correspond 23
two 23
very 23
ample 23
tubes 23
viz 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
vena 23
cava 23
which 23
is 23
the 23
principal 23
receptacle 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
and 23
the 23
trunk 23
of 23
the 23
tree 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
of 23
which 23
all 23
the 23
other 23
veins 23
in 23
the 23
body 23
are 23
branches 23
and 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
vena 23
arteriosa 23
inappropriately 23
so 23
denominated 23
since 23
it 23
is 23
in 23
truth 23
only 23
an 23
artery 23
which 23
taking 23
its 23
rise 23
in 23
the 23
heart 23
is 23
divided 23
after 23
passing 23
out 23
from 23
it 23
into 23
many 23
branches 23
which 23
presently 23
disperse 23
themselves 23
all 23
over 23
the 23
lungs 23
in 23
the 23
second 23
place 23
the 23
cavity 23
in 23
the 23
left 23
side 23
with 23
which 23
correspond 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
manner 23
two 23
canals 23
in 23
size 23
equal 23
to 23
or 23
larger 23
than 23
the 23
preceding 23
viz 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
arteria 23
venosa 23
likewise 23
inappropriately 23
thus 23
designated 23
because 23
it 23
is 23
simply 23
a 23
vein 23
which 23
comes 23
from 23
the 23
lungs 23
where 23
it 23
is 23
divided 23
into 23
many 23
branches 23
interlaced 23
with 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
and 23
those 23
of 23
the 23
tube 23
called 23
the 23
windpipe 23
through 23
which 23
the 23
air 23
we 23
breathe 23
enters 23
and 23
the 23
great 23
artery 23
which 23
issuing 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
sends 23
its 23
branches 23
all 23
over 23
the 23
body 23
i 23
should 23
wish 23
also 23
that 23
such 23
persons 23
were 23
carefully 23
shown 23
the 23
eleven 23
pellicles 23
which 23
like 23
so 23
many 23
small 23
valves 23
open 23
and 23
shut 23
the 23
four 23
orifices 23
that 23
are 23
in 23
these 23
two 23
cavities 23
viz 23
three 23
at 23
the 23
entrance 23
of 23
the 23
hollow 23
veins 23
where 23
they 23
are 23
disposed 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
manner 23
as 23
by 23
no 23
means 23
to 23
prevent 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
it 23
contains 23
from 23
flowing 23
into 23
the 23
right 23
ventricle 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
yet 23
exactly 23
to 23
prevent 23
its 23
flowing 23
out 23
three 23
at 23
the 23
entrance 23
to 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
which 23
arranged 23
in 23
a 23
manner 23
exactly 23
the 23
opposite 23
of 23
the 23
former 23
readily 23
permit 23
the 23
blood 23
contained 23
in 23
this 23
cavity 23
to 23
pass 23
into 23
the 23
lungs 23
but 23
hinder 23
that 23
contained 23
in 23
the 23
lungs 23
from 23
returning 23
to 23
this 23
cavity 23
and 23
in 23
like 23
manner 23
two 23
others 23
at 23
the 23
mouth 23
of 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
which 23
allow 23
the 23
blood 23
from 23
the 23
lungs 23
to 23
flow 23
into 23
the 23
left 23
cavity 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
but 23
preclude 23
its 23
return 23
and 23
three 23
at 23
the 23
mouth 23
of 23
the 23
great 23
artery 23
which 23
suffer 23
the 23
blood 23
to 23
flow 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
but 23
prevent 23
its 23
reflux 23
nor 23
do 23
we 23
need 23
to 23
seek 23
any 23
other 23
reason 23
for 23
the 23
number 23
of 23
these 23
pellicles 23
beyond 23
this 23
that 23
the 23
orifice 23
of 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
being 23
of 23
an 23
oval 23
shape 23
from 23
the 23
nature 23
of 23
its 23
situation 23
can 23
be 23
adequately 23
closed 23
with 23
two 23
whereas 23
the 23
others 23
being 23
round 23
are 23
more 23
conveniently 23
closed 23
with 23
three 23
besides 23
i 23
wish 23
such 23
persons 23
to 23
observe 23
that 23
the 23
grand 23
artery 23
and 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
are 23
of 23
much 23
harder 23
and 23
firmer 23
texture 23
than 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
and 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
and 23
that 23
the 23
two 23
last 23
expand 23
before 23
entering 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
there 23
form 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
two 23
pouches 23
denominated 23
the 23
auricles 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
which 23
are 23
composed 23
of 23
a 23
substance 23
similar 23
to 23
that 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
itself 23
and 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
always 23
more 23
warmth 23
in 23
the 23
heart 23
than 23
in 23
any 23
other 23
part 23
of 23
the 23
body 23
and 23
finally 23
that 23
this 23
heat 23
is 23
capable 23
of 23
causing 23
any 23
drop 23
of 23
blood 23
that 23
passes 23
into 23
the 23
cavities 23
rapidly 23
to 23
expand 23
and 23
dilate 23
just 23
as 23
all 23
liquors 23
do 23
when 23
allowed 23
to 23
fall 23
drop 23
by 23
drop 23
into 23
a 23
highly 23
heated 23
vessel 23
for 23
after 23
these 23
things 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
necessary 23
for 23
me 23
to 23
say 23
anything 23
more 23
with 23
a 23
view 23
to 23
explain 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
except 23
that 23
when 23
its 23
cavities 23
are 23
not 23
full 23
of 23
blood 23
into 23
these 23
the 23
blood 23
of 23
necessity 23
flows 23
from 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
into 23
the 23
right 23
and 23
from 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
into 23
the 23
left 23
because 23
these 23
two 23
vessels 23
are 23
always 23
full 23
of 23
blood 23
and 23
their 23
orifices 23
which 23
are 23
turned 23
towards 23
the 23
heart 23
cannot 23
then 23
be 23
closed 23
but 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
two 23
drops 23
of 23
blood 23
have 23
thus 23
passed 23
one 23
into 23
each 23
of 23
the 23
cavities 23
these 23
drops 23
which 23
cannot 23
but 23
be 23
very 23
large 23
because 23
the 23
orifices 23
through 23
which 23
they 23
pass 23
are 23
wide 23
and 23
the 23
vessels 23
from 23
which 23
they 23
come 23
full 23
of 23
blood 23
are 23
immediately 23
rarefied 23
and 23
dilated 23
by 23
the 23
heat 23
they 23
meet 23
with 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
they 23
cause 23
the 23
whole 23
heart 23
to 23
expand 23
and 23
at 23
the 23
same 23
time 23
press 23
home 23
and 23
shut 23
the 23
five 23
small 23
valves 23
that 23
are 23
at 23
the 23
entrances 23
of 23
the 23
two 23
vessels 23
from 23
which 23
they 23
flow 23
and 23
thus 23
prevent 23
any 23
more 23
blood 23
from 23
coming 23
down 23
into 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
becoming 23
more 23
and 23
more 23
rarefied 23
they 23
push 23
open 23
the 23
six 23
small 23
valves 23
that 23
are 23
in 23
the 23
orifices 23
of 23
the 23
other 23
two 23
vessels 23
through 23
which 23
they 23
pass 23
out 23
causing 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
all 23
the 23
branches 23
of 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
grand 23
artery 23
to 23
expand 23
almost 23
simultaneously 23
with 23
the 23
heart 23
which 23
immediately 23
thereafter 23
begins 23
to 23
contract 23
as 23
do 23
also 23
the 23
arteries 23
because 23
the 23
blood 23
that 23
has 23
entered 23
them 23
has 23
cooled 23
and 23
the 23
six 23
small 23
valves 23
close 23
and 23
the 23
five 23
of 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
open 23
anew 23
and 23
allow 23
a 23
passage 23
to 23
other 23
two 23
drops 23
of 23
blood 23
which 23
cause 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
the 23
arteries 23
again 23
to 23
expand 23
as 23
before 23
and 23
because 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
thus 23
enters 23
into 23
the 23
heart 23
passes 23
through 23
these 23
two 23
pouches 23
called 23
auricles 23
it 23
thence 23
happens 23
that 23
their 23
motion 23
is 23
the 23
contrary 23
of 23
that 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
that 23
when 23
it 23
expands 23
they 23
contract 23
but 23
lest 23
those 23
who 23
are 23
ignorant 23
of 23
the 23
force 23
of 23
mathematical 23
demonstrations 23
and 23
who 23
are 23
not 23
accustomed 23
to 23
distinguish 23
true 23
reasons 23
from 23
mere 23
verisimilitudes 23
should 23
venture 23
without 23
examination 23
to 23
deny 23
what 23
has 23
been 23
said 23
i 23
wish 23
it 23
to 23
be 23
considered 23
that 23
the 23
motion 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
now 23
explained 23
follows 23
as 23
necessarily 23
from 23
the 23
very 23
arrangement 23
of 23
the 23
parts 23
which 23
may 23
be 23
observed 23
in 23
the 23
heart 23
by 23
the 23
eye 23
alone 23
and 23
from 23
the 23
heat 23
which 23
may 23
be 23
felt 23
with 23
the 23
fingers 23
and 23
from 23
the 23
nature 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
as 23
learned 23
from 23
experience 23
as 23
does 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
a 23
clock 23
from 23
the 23
power 23
the 23
situation 23
and 23
shape 23
of 23
its 23
counterweights 23
and 23
wheels 23
but 23
if 23
it 23
be 23
asked 23
how 23
it 23
happens 23
that 23
the 23
blood 23
in 23
the 23
veins 23
flowing 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
continually 23
into 23
the 23
heart 23
is 23
not 23
exhausted 23
and 23
why 23
the 23
arteries 23
do 23
not 23
become 23
too 23
full 23
since 23
all 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
passes 23
through 23
the 23
heart 23
flows 23
into 23
them 23
i 23
need 23
only 23
mention 23
in 23
reply 23
what 23
has 23
been 23
written 23
by 23
a 23
physician 23
of 23
england 23
who 23
has 23
the 23
honor 23
of 23
having 23
broken 23
the 23
ice 23
on 23
this 23
subject 23
and 23
of 23
having 23
been 23
the 23
first 23
to 23
teach 23
that 23
there 23
are 23
many 23
small 23
passages 23
at 23
the 23
extremities 23
of 23
the 23
arteries 23
through 23
which 23
the 23
blood 23
received 23
by 23
them 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
passes 23
into 23
the 23
small 23
branches 23
of 23
the 23
veins 23
whence 23
it 23
again 23
returns 23
to 23
the 23
heart 23
so 23
that 23
its 23
course 23
amounts 23
precisely 23
to 23
a 23
perpetual 23
circulation 23
of 23
this 23
we 23
have 23
abundant 23
proof 23
in 23
the 23
ordinary 23
experience 23
of 23
surgeons 23
who 23
by 23
binding 23
the 23
arm 23
with 23
a 23
tie 23
of 23
moderate 23
straitness 23
above 23
the 23
part 23
where 23
they 23
open 23
the 23
vein 23
cause 23
the 23
blood 23
to 23
flow 23
more 23
copiously 23
than 23
it 23
would 23
have 23
done 23
without 23
any 23
ligature 23
whereas 23
quite 23
the 23
contrary 23
would 23
happen 23
were 23
they 23
to 23
bind 23
it 23
below 23
that 23
is 23
between 23
the 23
hand 23
and 23
the 23
opening 23
or 23
were 23
to 23
make 23
the 23
ligature 23
above 23
the 23
opening 23
very 23
tight 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
manifest 23
that 23
the 23
tie 23
moderately 23
straightened 23
while 23
adequate 23
to 23
hinder 23
the 23
blood 23
already 23
in 23
the 23
arm 23
from 23
returning 23
towards 23
the 23
heart 23
by 23
the 23
veins 23
cannot 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
prevent 23
new 23
blood 23
from 23
coming 23
forward 23
through 23
the 23
arteries 23
because 23
these 23
are 23
situated 23
below 23
the 23
veins 23
and 23
their 23
coverings 23
from 23
their 23
greater 23
consistency 23
are 23
more 23
difficult 23
to 23
compress 23
and 23
also 23
that 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
comes 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
tends 23
to 23
pass 23
through 23
them 23
to 23
the 23
hand 23
with 23
greater 23
force 23
than 23
it 23
does 23
to 23
return 23
from 23
the 23
hand 23
to 23
the 23
heart 23
through 23
the 23
veins 23
and 23
since 23
the 23
latter 23
current 23
escapes 23
from 23
the 23
arm 23
by 23
the 23
opening 23
made 23
in 23
one 23
of 23
the 23
veins 23
there 23
must 23
of 23
necessity 23
be 23
certain 23
passages 23
below 23
the 23
ligature 23
that 23
is 23
towards 23
the 23
extremities 23
of 23
the 23
arm 23
through 23
which 23
it 23
can 23
come 23
thither 23
from 23
the 23
arteries 23
this 23
physician 23
likewise 23
abundantly 23
establishes 23
what 23
he 23
has 23
advanced 23
respecting 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
from 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
certain 23
pellicles 23
so 23
disposed 23
in 23
various 23
places 23
along 23
the 23
course 23
of 23
the 23
veins 23
in 23
the 23
manner 23
of 23
small 23
valves 23
as 23
not 23
to 23
permit 23
the 23
blood 23
to 23
pass 23
from 23
the 23
middle 23
of 23
the 23
body 23
towards 23
the 23
extremities 23
but 23
only 23
to 23
return 23
from 23
the 23
extremities 23
to 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
farther 23
from 23
experience 23
which 23
shows 23
that 23
all 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
is 23
in 23
the 23
body 23
may 23
flow 23
out 23
of 23
it 23
in 23
a 23
very 23
short 23
time 23
through 23
a 23
single 23
artery 23
that 23
has 23
been 23
cut 23
even 23
although 23
this 23
had 23
been 23
closely 23
tied 23
in 23
the 23
immediate 23
neighborhood 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
cut 23
between 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
the 23
ligature 23
so 23
as 23
to 23
prevent 23
the 23
supposition 23
that 23
the 23
blood 23
flowing 23
out 23
of 23
it 23
could 23
come 23
from 23
any 23
other 23
quarter 23
than 23
the 23
heart 23
but 23
there 23
are 23
many 23
other 23
circumstances 23
which 23
evince 23
that 23
what 23
i 23
have 23
alleged 23
is 23
the 23
true 23
cause 23
of 23
the 23
motion 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
thus 23
in 23
the 23
first 23
place 23
the 23
difference 23
that 23
is 23
observed 23
between 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
flows 23
from 23
the 23
veins 23
and 23
that 23
from 23
the 23
arteries 23
can 23
only 23
arise 23
from 23
this 23
that 23
being 23
rarefied 23
and 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
distilled 23
by 23
passing 23
through 23
the 23
heart 23
it 23
is 23
thinner 23
and 23
more 23
vivid 23
and 23
warmer 23
immediately 23
after 23
leaving 23
the 23
heart 23
in 23
other 23
words 23
when 23
in 23
the 23
arteries 23
than 23
it 23
was 23
a 23
short 23
time 23
before 23
passing 23
into 23
either 23
in 23
other 23
words 23
when 23
it 23
was 23
in 23
the 23
veins 23
and 23
if 23
attention 23
be 23
given 23
it 23
will 23
be 23
found 23
that 23
this 23
difference 23
is 23
very 23
marked 23
only 23
in 23
the 23
neighborhood 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
is 23
not 23
so 23
evident 23
in 23
parts 23
more 23
remote 23
from 23
it 23
in 23
the 23
next 23
place 23
the 23
consistency 23
of 23
the 23

the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
and 23
the 23
great 23
artery 23
are 23
composed 23
sufficiently 23
shows 23
that 23
the 23
blood 23
is 23
impelled 23
against 23
them 23
with 23
more 23
force 23
than 23
against 23
the 23
veins 23
and 23
why 23
should 23
the 23
left 23
cavity 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
the 23
great 23
artery 23

wider 23
and 23
larger 23
than 23
the 23
right 23
cavity 23
and 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
were 23
it 23
not 23
that 23
the 23
blood 23
of 23
the 23
venous 23
artery 23
having 23
only 23
been 23
in 23
the 23
lungs 23
after 23
it 23
has 23
passed 23
through 23
the 23
heart 23
is 23
thinner 23
and 23
rarefies 23
more 23
readily 23
and 23
in 23
a 23
higher 23
degree 23
than 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
proceeds 23
immediately 23
from 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
and 23
what 23
can 23
physicians 23
conjecture 23
from 23
feeling 23
the 23
pulse 23
unless 23
they 23
know 23
that 23
according 23
as 23
the 23
blood 23
changes 23
its 23
nature 23
it 23
can 23
be 23
rarefied 23
by 23
the 23
warmth 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
in 23
a 23
higher 23
or 23
lower 23
degree 23
and 23
more 23
or 23
less 23
quickly 23
than 23
before 23
and 23
if 23
it 23
be 23
inquired 23
how 23
this 23
heat 23
is 23
communicated 23
to 23
the 23
other 23
members 23
must 23
it 23
not 23
be 23
admitted 23
that 23
this 23
is 23
effected 23
by 23
means 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
passing 23
through 23
the 23
heart 23
is 23
there 23
heated 23
anew 23
and 23
thence 23
diffused 23
over 23
all 23
the 23
body 23
whence 23
it 23
happens 23
that 23
if 23
the 23
blood 23
be 23
withdrawn 23
from 23
any 23
part 23
the 23
heat 23
is 23
likewise 23
withdrawn 23
by 23
the 23
same 23
means 23
and 23
although 23
the 23
heart 23
were 23
ashot 23
as 23
glowing 23
iron 23
it 23
would 23
not 23
be 23
capable 23
of 23
warming 23
the 23
feet 23
and 23
hands 23
as 23
at 23
present 23
unless 23
it 23
continually 23
sent 23
thither 23
new 23
blood 23
we 23
likewise 23
perceive 23
from 23
this 23
that 23
the 23
true 23
use 23
of 23
respiration 23
is 23
to 23
bring 23
sufficient 23
fresh 23
air 23
into 23
the 23
lungs 23
to 23
cause 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
flows 23
into 23
them 23
from 23
the 23
right 23
ventricle 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
where 23
it 23
has 23
been 23
rarefied 23
and 23
as 23
it 23
were 23
changed 23
into 23
vapors 23
to 23
become 23
thick 23
and 23
to 23
convert 23
it 23
anew 23
into 23
blood 23
before 23
it 23
flows 23
into 23
the 23
left 23
cavity 23
without 23
which 23
process 23
it 23
would 23
be 23
unfit 23
for 23
the 23
nourishment 23
of 23
the 23
fire 23
that 23
is 23
there 23
this 23
receives 23
confirmation 23
from 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
observed 23
of 23
animals 23
destitute 23
of 23
lungs 23
that 23
they 23
have 23
also 23
but 23
one 23
cavity 23
in 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
that 23
in 23
children 23
who 23
cannot 23
use 23
them 23
while 23
in 23
the 23
womb 23
there 23
is 23
a 23
hole 23
through 23
which 23
the 23
blood 23
flows 23
from 23
the 23
hollow 23
vein 23
into 23
the 23
left 23
cavity 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
a 23
tube 23
through 23
which 23
it 23
passes 23
from 23
the 23
arterial 23
vein 23
into 23
the 23
grand 23
artery 23
without 23
passing 23
through 23
the 23
lung 23
in 23
the 23
next 23
place 23
how 23
could 23
digestion 23
be 23
carried 23
on 23
in 23
the 23
stomach 23
unless 23
the 23
heart 23
communicated 23
heat 23
to 23
it 23
through 23
the 23
arteries 23
and 23
along 23
with 23
this 23
certain 23
of 23
the 23
more 23
fluid 23
parts 23
of 23

blood 23

assist 23
in 23
the 23
dissolution 23
of 23
the 23
food 23
that 23
has 23
been 23
taken 23
in 23
is 23
not 23
also 23
the 23
operation 23
which 23
converts 23
the 23
juice 23
of 23
food 23
into 23
blood 23
easily 23
comprehended 23
when 23
it 23
is 23
considered 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
distilled 23
by 23
passing 23
and 23
repassing 23
through 23
the 23
heart 23
perhaps 23
more 23
than 23
one 23
or 23
two 23
hundred 23
times 23
in 23
a 23
day 23
and 23
what 23
more 23

be 23
adduced 23
to 23
explain 23
nutrition 23

rarefied 23

from 23
the 23
heart 23
towards 23
the 23
extremities 23
of 23
the 23

causes 23
certain 23
of 23

parts 23
to 23
remain 23
in 23
the 23
members 23
at 23

of 23
some 23

others 23

into 23
certain 23
parts 23
in 23
the 23

way 23
that 23
some 23
sieves 23
are 23
observed 23
to 23
act 23
which 23
by 23
being 23
variously 23
perforated 23

in 23
the 23

place 23
what 23
above 23
all 23
is 23
here 23
worthy 23
of 23
observation 23
is 23
the 23
generation 23
of 23
the 23
animal 23
spirits 23
which 23
are 23
like 23
a 23
very 23
subtle 23
wind 23
or 23
rather 23
a 23
very 23
pure 23
and 23
vivid 23
flame 23
which 23
continually 23
ascending 23
in 23
great 23
abundance 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
to 23
the 23
brain 23
thence 23
penetrates 23
through 23
the 23
nerves 23
into 23
the 23
muscles 23
and 23
gives 23
motion 23
to 23
all 23
the 23
members 23
so 23
that 23
to 23
account 23
for 23
other 23
parts 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
as 23
most 23
agitated 23
and 23
penetrating 23
are 23
the 23
fittest 23
to 23
compose 23
these 23
spirits 23
proceeding 23
towards 23
the 23
brain 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
necessary 23
to 23
suppose 23
any 23
other 23
cause 23
than 23
simply 23
that 23
the 23
arteries 23
which 23
carry 23
them 23
thither 23
proceed 23
from 23
the 23
heart 23
in 23
the 23
most 23
direct 23
lines 23
and 23
that 23
according 23
to 23
the 23
rules 23
of 23
mechanics 23
which 23
are 23
the 23
same 23
with 23
those 23
of 23
nature 23
when 23
many 23
objects 23
tend 23
at 23
once 23
to 23
the 23
same 23
point 23
where 23
there 23
is 23
not 23
sufficient 23
room 23
for 23
all 23
as 23
is 23
the 23
case 23
with 23
the 23
parts 23
of 23
the 23
blood 23
which 23
flow 23
forth 23
from 23
the 23
left 23
cavity 23
of 23
the 23
heart 23
and 23
tend 23
towards 23
the 23
brain 23
the 23
weaker 23
and 23
less 23
agitated 23
parts 23
must 23
necessarily 23
be 23
driven 23
aside 23
from 23
that 23
point 23
by 23
the 23
stronger 23
which 23
alone 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
reach 23
it 23
i 23
had 23
expounded 23
all 23
these 23
matters 23
with 23
sufficient 23
minuteness 23
in 23
the 23
treatise 23
which 23
i 23
formerly 23
thought 23
of 23
publishing 23
and 23
after 23
these 23
i 23
had 23
shown 23
what 23
must 23
be 23
the 23
fabric 23
of 23
the 23
nerves 23
and 23
muscles 23
of 23
the 23
human 23
body 23
to 23
give 23
the 23
animal 23
spirits 23
contained 23
in 23
it 23
the 23
power 23
to 23
move 23
the 23
members 23
as 23
when 23
we 23
see 23
heads 23
shortly 23
after 23
they 23
have 23
been 23
struck 23
off 23
still 23
move 23

bite 23
the 23
earth 23
although 23
no 23
longer 23
animated 23
what 23
changes 23
must 23
take 23
place 23
in 23
the 23
brain 23
to 23
produce 23
waking 23
sleep 23

dreams 23
how 23
light 23

all 23
the 23
other 23
qualities 23
of 23
external 23
objects 23
impress 23
it 23
with 23
different 23
ideas 23
by 23
means 23
of 23
the 23
senses 23
how 23
hunger 23
thirst 23
and 23
the 23
other 23
internal 23
affections 23
can 23
likewise 23
impress 23
upon 23
it 23
divers 23
ideas 23
what 23
must 23
be 23
understood 23
by 23
the 23
common 23
sense 23
sensus 23

in 23
which 23
these 23
ideas 23
are 23
received 23
by 23
the 23
memory 23
which 23
retains 23
them 23
by 23
the 23
fantasy 23
which 23
can 23
change 23
them 23
in 23
various 23
ways 23
and 23
out 23
of 23
them 23
compose 23
new 23
ideas 23

same 23
means 23
distributing 23
the 23
animal 23
spirits 23
through 23
the 23
muscles 23
can 23
cause 23
the 23
members 23
of 23
such 23
a 23
body 23
to 23
move 23
in 23
as 23
many 23
different 23
ways 23
and 23
in 23
a 23
manner 23
as 23
suited 23
whether 23
to 23
the 23
objects 23
that 23
are 23
presented 23
to 23
its 23
senses 23

to 23
its 23
internal 23
affections 23
as 23
can 23
take 23
place 23
in 23
our 23
own 23
case 23
apart 23
from 23
the 23
guidance 23
of 23
the 23
will 23
nor 23
will 23
this 23
appear 23
at 23
all 23
strange 23
to 23
those 23
who 23
are 23
acquainted 23
with 23
the 23
variety 23
of 23
movements 23
performed 23
by 23
the 23
different 23
automata 23

moving 23
machines 23
fabricated 23
by 23
human 23
industry 23

that 23
with 23
help 23
of 23
but 23
few 23
pieces 23
compared 23

are 23
found 23
in 23
the 23
body 23
of 23
each 23
animal 23
such 23
persons 23
will 23
look 23
upon 23
this 23
body 23
as 23
a 23
machine 23
made 23
by 23
the 23
hands 23
of 23
god 23
which 23
is 23
incomparably 23
better 23
arranged 23
and 23
adequate 23
to 23
movements 23
more 23
admirable 23
than 23
is 23
any 23
machine 23
of 23
human 23
invention 23
and 23
here 23
i 23
specially 23
stayed 23
to 23
show 23
that 23
were 23
there 23
such 23
machines 23
exactly 23
resembling 23
organs 23
and 23
outward 23
form 23
an 23
ape 23
or 23
any 23
other 23
irrational 23
animal 23
we 23
could 23
have 23
no 23
means 23
of 23
knowing 23
that 23
they 23
were 23
in 23
any 23
respect 23
of 23
a 23
different 23
nature 23
from 23
these 23

there 23
were 23
machines 23
bearing 23
the 23
image 23
of 23
our 23
bodies 23
and 23
capable 23
of 23
imitating 23
our 23
actions 23
as 23
far 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
morally 23
possible 23
there 23
would 23
still 23
remain 23
two 23
most 23
certain 23
tests 23
whereby 23
to 23
know 23
that 23
they 23
were 23
not 23
therefore 23
really 23
men 23
of 23
these 23
the 23
first 23
is 23
that 23
they 23
could 23
never 23
use 23
words 23
or 23
other 23
signs 23
arranged 23
in 23
such 23
a 23
manner 23
as 23
is 23
competent 23
to 23
us 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
declare 23
our 23
thoughts 23
to 23
others 23
for 23
we 23
may 23
easily 23
conceive 23
a 23
machine 23
to 23
be 23
so 23
constructed 23
that 23
it 23
emits 23
vocables 23
and 23
even 23
that 23
it 23
emits 23
some 23
correspondent 23
to 23
the 23
action 23
upon 23
it 23
of 23
external 23
objects 23
which 23
cause 23
a 23
change 23
in 23
its 23
organs 23
for 23
example 23
if 23
touched 23
in 23
a 23
particular 23
place 23
it 23
may 23
demand 23
what 23
we 23
wish 23
to 23
say 23
to 23
it 23
if 23
in 23
another 23
it 23
may 23
cry 23
out 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
hurt 23
and 23
such 23
like 23
but 23
not 23
that 23
it 23
should 23
arrange 23
them 23
variously 23
so 23
as 23
appositely 23
to 23
reply 23
to 23
what 23
is 23
said 23
in 23
its 23
presence 23
as 23
men 23
of 23
the 23
lowest 23
grade 23
of 23
intellect 23
can 23
do 23
the 23
second 23
test 23
is 23
that 23
although 23
such 23
machines 23
might 23
execute 23
many 23
things 23
with 23
equal 23
or 23
perhaps 23
greater 23
perfection 23
than 23
any 23
of 23
us 23
they 23
would 23
without 23
doubt 23
fail 23
in 23
certain 23
others 23
from 23
which 23
it 23
could 23
be 23
discovered 23
that 23
they 23
did 23
not 23
act 23
from 23
knowledge 23
but 23
solely 23
from 23
the 23
disposition 23
of 23
their 23
organs 23
for 23
while 23
reason 23
is 23
an 23
universal 23
instrument 23
that 23
is 23
alike 23
available 23
on 23
every 23
occasion 23
these 23
organs 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
need 23
a 23
particular 23
arrangement 23
for 23
each 23
particular 23
action 23
whence 23
it 23
must 23
be 23
morally 23
impossible 23
that 23
there 23
should 23
exist 23
in 23
any 23
machine 23
a 23
diversity 23
of 23
organs 23
sufficient 23
to 23
enable 23
it 23
to 23
act 23
in 23
all 23
the 23
occurrences 23
of 23
life 23
in 23
the 23
way 23
in 23
which 23
our 23
reason 23
enables 23
us 23
to 23
act 23
again 23
by 23
means 23
of 23
these 23
two 23
tests 23
we 23
may 23
likewise 23
know 23
the 23
difference 23
between 23
men 23
and 23
brutes 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
highly 23
deserving 23
of 23
remark 23
that 23
there 23
are 23
no 23
men 23
so 23
dull 23
and 23
stupid 23
not 23
even 23
idiots 23
as 23
to 23
be 23
incapable 23
of 23
joining 23
together 23
different 23
words 23
and 23
thereby 23
constructing 23
a 23
declaration 23
by 23
which 23
to 23
make 23
their 23
thoughts 23
understood 23
and 23
that 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
there 23
is 23
no 23
other 23
animal 23
however 23
perfect 23
or 23
happily 23
circumstanced 23
which 23
can 23
do 23
the 23
like 23
nor 23
does 23
this 23
inability 23
arise 23
from 23
want 23
of 23
organs 23
for 23
we 23
observe 23
that 23
magpies 23
and 23
parrots 23
can 23
utter 23
words 23
like 23
ourselves 23
and 23
are 23
yet 23
unable 23
to 23
speak 23
as 23
we 23
do 23
that 23
is 23
so 23
as 23
to 23
show 23
that 23
they 23
understand 23
what 23
they 23
say 23
in 23
place 23
of 23
which 23
men 23
born 23
deaf 23
and 23
dumb 23
and 23
thus 23
not 23
less 23
but 23
rather 23
more 23
than 23
the 23
brutes 23
destitute 23
of 23
the 23
organs 23
which 23
others 23
use 23
in 23
speaking 23
are 23
in 23
the 23
habit 23
of 23
spontaneously 23
inventing 23
certain 23
signs 23
by 23
which 23
they 23
discover 23
their 23
thoughts 23
to 23
those 23
who 23
being 23
usually 23
in 23
their 23
company 23
have 23
leisure 23
to 23
learn 23
their 23
language 23
and 23
this 23
proves 23
not 23
only 23
that 23
the 23
brutes 23
have 23
less 23
reason 23
than 23
man 23
but 23
that 23
they 23
have 23
none 23
at 23
all 23
for 23
we 23
see 23
that 23
very 23
little 23
is 23
required 23
to 23
enable 23
a 23
person 23
to 23
speak 23
and 23
since 23
a 23
certain 23
inequality 23
of 23
capacity 23
is 23
observable 23
among 23
animals 23
of 23
the 23
same 23
species 23
as 23
well 23
as 23
among 23
men 23
and 23
since 23
some 23
are 23
more 23
capable 23
of 23
being 23
instructed 23
than 23
others 23
it 23
is 23
incredible 23
that 23
the 23
most 23
perfect 23
ape 23
or 23
parrot 23
of 23
its 23
species 23
should 23
not 23
in 23
this 23
be 23
equal 23
to 23
the 23
most 23
stupid 23
infant 23
of 23
its 23
kind 23
or 23
at 23
least 23
to 23
one 23
that 23
was 23
crackbrained 23
unless 23
the 23
soul 23
of 23
brutes 23
were 23
of 23
a 23
nature 23
wholly 23
different 23
from 23
ours 23
and 23
we 23
ought 23
not 23
to 23
confound 23
speech 23
with 23
the 23
natural 23
movements 23
which 23
indicate 23
the 23
passions 23
and 23
can 23
be 23
imitated 23
by 23
machines 23
as 23
well 23
as 23
manifested 23
by 23
animals 23
nor 23
must 23
it 23
be 23
thought 23
with 23
certain 23
of 23
the 23
ancients 23
that 23
the 23
brutes 23
speak 23
although 23
we 23
do 23
not 23
understand 23
their 23
language 23
for 23
if 23
such 23
were 23
the 23
case 23
since 23
they 23
are 23
endowed 23
with 23
many 23
organs 23
analogous 23
to 23
ours 23
they 23
could 23
as 23
easily 23
communicate 23
their 23
thoughts 23
to 23
us 23
as 23
to 23
their 23
fellows 23
it 23
is 23
also 23
very 23
worthy 23
of 23
remark 23
that 23
though 23
there 23
are 23
many 23
animals 23
which 23
manifest 23
more 23
industry 23
than 23
we 23
in 23
certain 23
of 23
their 23
actions 23
the 23
same 23
animals 23
are 23
yet 23
observed 23
to 23
show 23
none 23
at 23
all 23
in 23
many 23
others 23
so 23
that 23
the 23
circumstance 23
that 23
they 23
do 23
better 23
than 23
we 23
does 23
not 23
prove 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
endowed 23
with 23
mind 23
for 23
it 23
would 23
thence 23
follow 23
that 23
they 23
possessed 23
greater 23
reason 23
than 23
any 23
of 23
us 23
and 23
could 23
surpass 23
us 23
in 23
all 23
things 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
it 23
rather 23
proves 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
destitute 23
of 23
reason 23
and 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
nature 23
which 23
acts 23
in 23
them 23
according 23
to 23
the 23
disposition 23
of 23
their 23
organs 23
thus 23
it 23
is 23
seen 23
that 23
a 23
clock 23
composed 23
only 23
of 23
wheels 23
and 23
weights 23
can 23
number 23
the 23
hours 23
and 23
measure 23
time 23
more 23
exactly 23
than 23
we 23
with 23
all 23
our 23
skin 23
i 23
had 23
after 23
this 23
described 23
the 23
reasonable 23
soul 23
and 23
shown 23
that 23
it 23
could 23
by 23
no 23
means 23
be 23
educed 23
from 23
the 23
power 23
of 23
matter 23
as 23
the 23
other 23
things 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
spoken 23
but 23
that 23
it 23
must 23
be 23
expressly 23
created 23
and 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
sufficient 23
that 23
it 23
be 23
lodged 23
in 23
the 23
human 23
body 23
exactly 23
like 23
a 23
pilot 23
in 23
a 23
ship 23
unless 23
perhaps 23
to 23
move 23
its 23
members 23
but 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
necessary 23
for 23
it 23
to 23
be 23
joined 23
and 23
united 23
more 23
closely 23
to 23
the 23
body 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
have 23
sensations 23
and 23
appetites 23
similar 23
to 23
ours 23
and 23
thus 23
constitute 23
a 23
real 23
man 23
i 23
here 23
entered 23
in 23
conclusion 23
upon 23
the 23
subject 23
of 23
the 23
soul 23
at 23
considerable 23
length 23
because 23
it 23
is 23
of 23
the 23
greatest 23
moment 23
for 23
after 23
the 23
error 23
of 23
those 23
who 23
deny 23
the 23
existence 23
of 23
god 23
an 23
error 23
which 23
i 23
think 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
sufficiently 23
refuted 23
there 23
is 23
none 23
that 23
is 23
more 23
powerful 23
in 23
leading 23
feeble 23
minds 23
astray 23
from 23
the 23
straight 23
path 23
of 23
virtue 23
than 23
the 23
supposition 23
that 23
the 23
soul 23
of 23
the 23
brutes 23
is 23
of 23
the 23
same 23
nature 23
with 23
our 23
own 23
and 23
consequently 23
that 23
after 23
this 23
life 23
we 23
have 23
nothing 23
to 23
hope 23
for 23
or 23
fear 23
more 23
than 23
flies 23
and 23
ants 23
in 23
place 23
of 23
which 23
when 23
we 23
know 23
how 23
far 23
they 23
differ 23
we 23
much 23
better 23
comprehend 23
the 23
reasons 23
which 23
establish 23
that 23
the 23
soul 23
is 23
of 23
a 23
nature 23
wholly 23
independent 23
of 23
the 23
body 23
and 23
that 23
consequently 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
liable 23
to 23
die 23
with 23
the 23
latter 23
and 23
finally 23
because 23
no 23
other 23
causes 23
are 23
observed 23
capable 23
of 23
destroying 23
it 23
we 23
are 23
naturally 23
led 23
thence 23
to 23
judge 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
immortal 23
part 23
vi 23
three 23
years 23
have 23
now 23
elapsed 23
since 23
i 23
finished 23
the 23
treatise 23
containing 23
all 23
these 23
matters 23
and 23
i 23
was 23
beginning 23
to 23
revise 23
it 23
with 23
the 23
view 23
to 23
put 23
it 23
into 23
the 23
hands 23
of 23
a 23
printer 23
when 23
i 23
learned 23
that 23
persons 23
to 23
whom 23
i 23
greatly 23
defer 23
and 23
whose 23
authority 23
over 23
my 23
actions 23
is 23
hardly 23
less 23
influential 23
than 23
is 23
my 23
own 23
reason 23
over 23
my 23
thoughts 23
had 23
condemned 23
a 23
certain 23
doctrine 23
in 23
physics 23
published 23
a 23
short 23
time 23
previously 23
by 23
another 23
individual 23
to 23
which 23
i 23
will 23
not 23
say 23
that 23
i 23
adhered 23
but 23
only 23
that 23
previously 23
to 23
their 23
censure 23
i 23
had 23
observed 23
in 23
it 23
nothing 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
imagine 23
to 23
be 23
prejudicial 23
either 23
to 23
religion 23
or 23
to 23
the 23
state 23
and 23
nothing 23
therefore 23
which 23
would 23
have 23
prevented 23
me 23
from 23
giving 23
expression 23
to 23
it 23
in 23
writing 23
if 23
reason 23
had 23
persuaded 23
me 23
of 23
its 23
truth 23
and 23
this 23
led 23
me 23
to 23
fear 23
lest 23
among 23
my 23
own 23
doctrines 23
likewise 23
some 23
one 23
might 23
be 23
found 23
in 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
departed 23
from 23
the 23
truth 23
notwithstanding 23
the 23
great 23
care 23
i 23
have 23
always 23
taken 23
not 23
to 23
accord 23
belief 23
to 23
new 23
opinions 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
not 23
the 23
most 23
certain 23
demonstrations 23
and 23
not 23
to 23
give 23
expression 23
to 23
aught 23
that 23
might 23
tend 23
to 23
the 23
hurt 23
of 23
any 23
one 23
this 23
has 23
been 23
sufficient 23
to 23
make 23
me 23
alter 23
my 23
purpose 23
of 23
publishing 23
them 23
for 23
although 23
the 23
reasons 23
by 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
induced 23
to 23
take 23
this 23
resolution 23
were 23
very 23
strong 23
yet 23
my 23
inclination 23
which 23
has 23
always 23
been 23
hostile 23
to 23
writing 23
books 23
enabled 23
me 23
immediately 23
to 23
discover 23
other 23
considerations 23
sufficient 23
to 23
excuse 23
me 23
for 23
not 23
undertaking 23
the 23
task 23
and 23
these 23
reasons 23
on 23
one 23
side 23
and 23
the 23
other 23
are 23
such 23
that 23
not 23
only 23
is 23
it 23
in 23
some 23
measure 23
my 23
interest 23
here 23
to 23
state 23
them 23
but 23
that 23
of 23
the 23
public 23
perhaps 23
to 23
know 23
them 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
made 23
much 23
account 23
of 23
what 23
has 23
proceeded 23
from 23
my 23
own 23
mind 23
and 23
so 23
long 23
as 23
i 23
gathered 23
no 23
other 23
advantage 23
from 23
the 23
method 23
i 23
employ 23
beyond 23
satisfying 23
myself 23
on 23
some 23
difficulties 23
belonging 23
to 23
the 23
speculative 23
sciences 23
or 23
endeavoring 23
to 23
regulate 23
my 23
actions 23
according 23
to 23
the 23
principles 23
it 23
taught 23
me 23
i 23
never 23
thought 23
myself 23
bound 23
to 23
publish 23
anything 23
respecting 23
it 23
for 23
in 23
what 23
regards 23
manners 23
every 23
one 23
is 23
so 23
full 23
of 23
his 23
own 23
wisdom 23
that 23
there 23
might 23
be 23
found 23
as 23
many 23
reformers 23
as 23
heads 23
if 23
any 23
were 23
allowed 23
to 23
take 23
upon 23
themselves 23
the 23
task 23
of 23
mending 23
them 23
except 23
those 23
whom 23
god 23
has 23
constituted 23
the 23
supreme 23
rulers 23
of 23
his 23
people 23
or 23
to 23
whom 23
he 23
has 23
given 23
sufficient 23
grace 23
and 23
zeal 23
to 23
be 23
prophets 23
and 23
although 23
my 23
speculations 23
greatly 23
pleased 23
myself 23
i 23
believed 23
that 23
others 23
had 23
theirs 23
which 23
perhaps 23
pleased 23
them 23
still 23
more 23
but 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
i 23
had 23
acquired 23
some 23
general 23
notions 23
respecting 23
physics 23
and 23
beginning 23
to 23
make 23
trial 23
of 23
them 23
in 23
various 23
particular 23
difficulties 23
had 23
observed 23
how 23
far 23
they 23
can 23
carry 23
us 23
and 23
how 23
much 23
they 23
differ 23
from 23
the 23
principles 23
that 23
have 23
been 23
employed 23
up 23
to 23
the 23
present 23
time 23
i 23
believed 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
keep 23
them 23
concealed 23
without 23
sinning 23
grievously 23
against 23
the 23
law 23
by 23
which 23
we 23
are 23
bound 23
to 23
promote 23
as 23
far 23
as 23
in 23
us 23
lies 23
the 23
general 23
good 23
of 23
mankind 23
for 23
by 23
them 23
i 23
perceived 23
it 23
to 23
be 23
possible 23
to 23
arrive 23
at 23
knowledge 23
highly 23
useful 23
in 23
life 23
and 23
in 23
room 23
of 23
the 23
speculative 23
philosophy 23
usually 23
taught 23
in 23
the 23
schools 23
to 23
discover 23
a 23
practical 23
by 23
means 23
of 23
which 23
knowing 23
the 23
force 23
and 23
action 23
of 23
fire 23
water 23
air 23
the 23
stars 23
the 23
heavens 23
and 23
all 23
the 23
other 23
bodies 23
that 23
surround 23
us 23
as 23
distinctly 23
as 23
we 23
know 23
the 23
various 23
crafts 23
of 23
our 23
artisans 23
we 23
might 23
also 23
apply 23
them 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
way 23
to 23
all 23
the 23
uses 23
to 23
which 23
they 23
are 23
adapted 23
and 23
thus 23
render 23
ourselves 23
the 23
lords 23
and 23
possessors 23
of 23
nature 23
and 23
this 23
is 23
a 23
result 23
to 23
be 23
desired 23
not 23
only 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
the 23
invention 23
of 23
an 23
infinity 23
of 23
arts 23
by 23
which 23
we 23
might 23
be 23
enabled 23
to 23
enjoy 23
without 23
any 23
trouble 23
the 23
fruits 23
of 23
the 23
earth 23
and 23
all 23
its 23
comforts 23
but 23
also 23
and 23
especially 23
for 23
the 23
preservation 23
of 23
health 23
which 23
is 23
without 23
doubt 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
blessings 23
of 23
this 23
life 23
the 23
first 23
and 23
fundamental 23
one 23
for 23
the 23
mind 23
is 23
so 23
intimately 23
dependent 23
upon 23
the 23
condition 23
and 23
relation 23
of 23
the 23
organs 23
of 23
the 23
body 23
that 23
if 23
any 23
means 23
can 23
ever 23
be 23
found 23
to 23
render 23
men 23
wiser 23
and 23
more 23
ingenious 23
than 23
hitherto 23
i 23
believe 23
that 23
it 23
is 23
in 23
medicine 23
they 23
must 23
be 23
sought 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
true 23
that 23
the 23
science 23
of 23
medicine 23
as 23
it 23
now 23
exists 23
contains 23
few 23
things 23
whose 23
utility 23
is 23
very 23
remarkable 23
but 23
without 23
any 23
wish 23
to 23
depreciate 23
it 23
i 23
am 23
confident 23
that 23
there 23
is 23
no 23
one 23
even 23
among 23
those 23
whose 23
profession 23
it 23
is 23
who 23
does 23
not 23
admit 23
that 23
all 23
at 23
present 23
known 23
in 23
it 23
is 23
almost 23
nothing 23
in 23
comparison 23
of 23
what 23
remains 23
to 23
be 23
discovered 23
and 23
that 23
we 23
could 23
free 23
ourselves 23
from 23
an 23
infinity 23
of 23
maladies 23
of 23
body 23
as 23
well 23
as 23
of 23
mind 23
and 23
perhaps 23
also 23
even 23
from 23
the 23
debility 23
of 23
age 23
if 23
we 23
had 23
sufficiently 23
ample 23
knowledge 23
of 23
their 23
causes 23
and 23
of 23
all 23
the 23
remedies 23
provided 23
for 23
us 23
by 23
nature 23
but 23
since 23
i 23
designed 23
to 23
employ 23
my 23
whole 23
life 23
in 23
the 23
search 23
after 23
so 23
necessary 23
a 23
science 23
and 23
since 23
i 23
had 23
fallen 23
in 23
with 23
a 23
path 23
which 23
seems 23
to 23
me 23
such 23
that 23
if 23
any 23
one 23
follow 23
it 23
he 23
must 23
inevitably 23
reach 23
the 23
end 23
desired 23
unless 23
he 23
be 23
hindered 23
either 23
by 23
the 23
shortness 23
of 23
life 23
or 23
the 23
want 23
of 23
experiments 23
i 23
judged 23
that 23
there 23
could 23
be 23
no 23
more 23
effectual 23
provision 23
against 23
these 23
two 23
impediments 23
than 23
if 23
i 23
were 23
faithfully 23
to 23
communicate 23
to 23
the 23
public 23
all 23
the 23
little 23
i 23
might 23
myself 23
have 23
found 23
and 23
incite 23
men 23
of 23
superior 23
genius 23
to 23
strive 23
to 23
proceed 23
farther 23
by 23
contributing 23
each 23
according 23
to 23
his 23
inclination 23
and 23
ability 23
to 23
the 23
experiments 23
which 23
it 23
would 23
be 23
necessary 23
to 23
make 23
and 23
also 23
by 23
informing 23
the 23
public 23
of 23
all 23
they 23
might 23
discover 23
so 23
that 23
by 23
the 23
last 23
beginning 23
where 23
those 23
before 23
them 23
had 23
left 23
off 23
and 23
thus 23
connecting 23
the 23
lives 23
and 23
labours 23
of 23
many 23
we 23
might 23
collectively 23
proceed 23
much 23
farther 23
than 23
each 23
by 23
himself 23
could 23
do 23
i 23
remarked 23
moreover 23
with 23
respect 23
to 23
experiments 23
that 23
they 23
become 23
always 23
more 23
necessary 23
the 23
more 23
one 23
is 23
advanced 23
in 23
knowledge 23
for 23
at 23
the 23
commencement 23
it 23
is 23
better 23
to 23
make 23
use 23
only 23
of 23
what 23
is 23
spontaneously 23
presented 23
to 23
our 23
senses 23
and 23
of 23
which 23
we 23
cannot 23
remain 23
ignorant 23
provided 23
we 23
bestow 23
on 23
it 23
any 23
reflection 23
however 23
slight 23
than 23
to 23
concern 23
ourselves 23
about 23
more 23
uncommon 23
and 23
recondite 23
phenomena 23
the 23
reason 23
of 23
which 23
is 23
that 23
the 23
more 23
uncommon 23
often 23
only 23
mislead 23
us 23
so 23
long 23
as 23
the 23
causes 23
of 23
the 23
more 23
ordinary 23
are 23
still 23
unknown 23
and 23
the 23
circumstances 23
upon 23
which 23
they 23
depend 23
are 23
almost 23
always 23
so 23
special 23
and 23
minute 23
as 23
to 23
be 23
highly 23
difficult 23
to 23
detect 23
but 23
in 23
this 23
i 23
have 23
adopted 23
the 23
following 23
order 23
first 23
i 23
have 23
essayed 23
to 23
find 23
in 23
general 23
the 23
principles 23
or 23
first 23
causes 23
of 23
all 23
that 23
is 23
or 23
can 23
be 23
in 23
the 23
world 23
without 23
taking 23
into 23
consideration 23
for 23
this 23
end 23
anything 23
but 23
god 23
himself 23
who 23
has 23
created 23
it 23
and 23
without 23
educing 23
them 23
from 23
any 23
other 23
source 23
than 23
from 23
certain 23
germs 23
of 23
truths 23
naturally 23
existing 23
in 23
our 23
minds 23
in 23
the 23
second 23
place 23
i 23
examined 23
what 23
were 23
the 23
first 23
and 23
most 23
ordinary 23
effects 23
that 23
could 23
be 23
deduced 23
from 23
these 23
causes 23
and 23
it 23
appears 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
i 23
have 23
found 23
heavens 23
stars 23
an 23
earth 23
and 23
even 23
on 23
the 23
earth 23
water 23
air 23
fire 23
minerals 23
and 23
some 23
other 23
things 23
of 23
this 23
kind 23
which 23
of 23
all 23
others 23
are 23
the 23
most 23
common 23
and 23
simple 23
and 23
hence 23
the 23
easiest 23
to 23
know 23
afterwards 23
when 23
i 23
wished 23
to 23
descend 23
to 23
the 23
more 23
particular 23
so 23
many 23
diverse 23
objects 23
presented 23
themselves 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
i 23
believed 23
it 23
to 23
be 23
impossible 23
for 23
the 23
human 23
mind 23
to 23
distinguish 23
the 23
forms 23
or 23
species 23
of 23
bodies 23
that 23
are 23
upon 23
the 23
earth 23
from 23
an 23
infinity 23
of 23
others 23
which 23
might 23
have 23
been 23
if 23
it 23
had 23
pleased 23
god 23
to 23
place 23
them 23
there 23
or 23
consequently 23
to 23
apply 23
them 23
to 23
our 23
use 23
unless 23
we 23
rise 23
to 23
causes 23
through 23
their 23
effects 23
and 23
avail 23
ourselves 23
of 23
many 23
particular 23
experiments 23
thereupon 23
turning 23
over 23
in 23
my 23
mind 23
i 23
the 23
objects 23
that 23
had 23
ever 23
been 23
presented 23
to 23
my 23
senses 23
i 23
freely 23
venture 23
to 23
state 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
observed 23
any 23
which 23
i 23
could 23
not 23
satisfactorily 23
explain 23
by 23
the 23
principles 23
had 23
discovered 23
but 23
it 23
is 23
necessary 23
also 23
to 23
confess 23
that 23
the 23
power 23
of 23
nature 23
is 23
so 23
ample 23
and 23
vast 23
and 23
these 23
principles 23
so 23
simple 23
and 23
general 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
hardly 23
observed 23
a 23
single 23
particular 23
effect 23
which 23
i 23
cannot 23
at 23
once 23
recognize 23
as 23
capable 23
of 23
being 23
deduced 23
in 23
man 23
different 23
modes 23
from 23
the 23
principles 23
and 23
that 23
my 23
greatest 23
difficulty 23
usually 23
is 23
to 23
discover 23
in 23
which 23
of 23
these 23
modes 23
the 23
effect 23
is 23
dependent 23
upon 23
them 23
for 23
out 23
of 23
this 23
difficulty 23
cannot 23
otherwise 23
extricate 23
myself 23
than 23
by 23
again 23
seeking 23
certain 23
experiments 23
which 23
may 23
be 23
such 23
that 23
their 23
result 23
is 23
not 23
the 23
same 23
if 23
it 23
is 23
in 23
the 23
one 23
of 23
these 23
modes 23
at 23
we 23
must 23
explain 23
it 23
as 23
it 23
would 23
be 23
if 23
it 23
were 23
to 23
be 23
explained 23
in 23
the 23
other 23
as 23
to 23
what 23
remains 23
i 23
am 23
now 23
in 23
a 23
position 23
to 23
discern 23
as 23
i 23
think 23
with 23
sufficient 23
clearness 23
what 23
course 23
must 23
be 23
taken 23
to 23
make 23
the 23
majority 23
those 23
experiments 23
which 23
may 23
conduce 23
to 23
this 23
end 23
but 23
i 23
perceive 23
likewise 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
such 23
and 23
so 23
numerous 23
that 23
neither 23
my 23
hands 23
nor 23
my 23
income 23
though 23
it 23
were 23
a 23
thousand 23
times 23
larger 23
than 23
it 23
is 23
would 23
be 23
sufficient 23
for 23
them 23
all 23
so 23
that 23
according 23
as 23
henceforward 23
i 23
shall 23
have 23
the 23
means 23
of 23
making 23
more 23
or 23
fewer 23
experiments 23
i 23
shall 23
in 23
the 23
same 23
proportion 23
make 23
greater 23
or 23
less 23
progress 23
in 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
nature 23
this 23
was 23
what 23
i 23
had 23
hoped 23
to 23
make 23
known 23
by 23
the 23
treatise 23
i 23
had 23
written 23
and 23
so 23
clearly 23
to 23
exhibit 23
the 23
advantage 23
that 23
would 23
thence 23
accrue 23
to 23
the 23
public 23
as 23
to 23
induce 23
all 23
who 23
have 23
the 23
common 23
good 23
of 23
man 23
at 23
heart 23
that 23
is 23
all 23
who 23
are 23
virtuous 23
in 23
truth 23
and 23
not 23
merely 23
in 23
appearance 23
or 23
according 23
to 23
opinion 23
as 23
well 23
to 23
communicate 23
to 23
me 23
the 23
experiments 23
they 23
had 23
already 23
made 23
as 23
to 23
assist 23
me 23
in 23
those 23
that 23
remain 23
to 23
be 23
made 23
but 23
since 23
that 23
time 23
other 23
reasons 23
have 23
occurred 23
to 23
me 23
by 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
led 23
to 23
change 23
my 23
opinion 23
and 23
to 23
think 23
that 23
i 23
ought 23
indeed 23
to 23
go 23
on 23
committing 23
to 23
writing 23
all 23
the 23
results 23
which 23
i 23
deemed 23
of 23
any 23
moment 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
i 23
should 23
have 23
tested 23
their 23
truth 23
and 23
to 23
bestow 23
the 23
same 23
care 23
upon 23
them 23
as 23
i 23
would 23
have 23
done 23
had 23
it 23
been 23
my 23
design 23
to 23
publish 23
them 23
this 23
course 23
commended 23
itself 23
to 23
me 23
as 23
well 23
because 23
i 23
thus 23
afforded 23
myself 23
more 23
ample 23
inducement 23
to 23
examine 23
them 23
thoroughly 23
for 23
doubtless 23
that 23
is 23
always 23
more 23
narrowly 23
scrutinized 23
which 23
we 23
believe 23
will 23
be 23
read 23
by 23
many 23
than 23
that 23
which 23
is 23
written 23
merely 23
for 23
our 23
private 23
use 23
and 23
frequently 23
what 23
has 23
seemed 23
to 23
me 23
true 23
when 23
i 23
first 23
conceived 23
it 23
has 23
appeared 23
false 23
when 23
i 23
have 23
set 23
about 23
committing 23
it 23
to 23
writing 23
as 23
because 23
i 23
thus 23
lost 23
no 23
opportunity 23
of 23
advancing 23
the 23
interests 23
of 23
the 23
public 23
as 23
far 23
as 23
in 23
me 23
lay 23
and 23
since 23
thus 23
likewise 23
if 23
my 23
writings 23
possess 23
any 23
value 23
those 23
into 23
whose 23
hands 23
they 23
may 23
fall 23
after 23
my 23
death 23
may 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
put 23
them 23
to 23
what 23
use 23
they 23
deem 23
proper 23
but 23
i 23
resolved 23
by 23
no 23
means 23
to 23
consent 23
to 23
their 23
publication 23
during 23
my 23
lifetime 23
lest 23
either 23
the 23
oppositions 23
or 23
the 23
controversies 23
to 23
which 23
they 23
might 23
give 23
rise 23
or 23
even 23
the 23
reputation 23
such 23
as 23
it 23
might 23
be 23
which 23
they 23
would 23
acquire 23
for 23
me 23
should 23
be 23
any 23
occasion 23
of 23
my 23
losing 23
the 23
time 23
that 23
i 23
had 23
set 23
apart 23
for 23
my 23
own 23
improvement 23
for 23
though 23
it 23
be 23
true 23
that 23
every 23
one 23
is 23
bound 23
to 23
promote 23
to 23
the 23
extent 23
of 23
his 23
ability 23
the 23
good 23
of 23
others 23
and 23
that 23
to 23
be 23
useful 23
to 23
no 23
one 23
is 23
really 23
to 23
be 23
worthless 23
yet 23
it 23
is 23
likewise 23
true 23
that 23
our 23
cares 23
ought 23
to 23
extend 23
beyond 23
the 23
present 23
and 23
it 23
is 23
good 23
to 23
omit 23
doing 23
what 23
might 23
perhaps 23
bring 23
some 23
profit 23
to 23
the 23
living 23
when 23
we 23
have 23
in 23
view 23
the 23
accomplishment 23
of 23
other 23
ends 23
that 23
will 23
be 23
of 23
much 23
greater 23
advantage 23
to 23
posterity 23
and 23
in 23
truth 23
i 23
am 23
quite 23
willing 23
it 23
should 23
be 23
known 23
that 23
the 23
little 23
i 23
have 23
hitherto 23
learned 23
is 23
almost 23
nothing 23
in 23
comparison 23
with 23
that 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
am 23
ignorant 23
and 23
to 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
despair 23
of 23
being 23
able 23
to 23
attain 23
for 23
it 23
is 23
much 23
the 23
same 23
with 23
those 23
who 23
gradually 23
discover 23
truth 23
in 23
the 23
sciences 23
as 23
with 23
those 23
who 23
when 23
growing 23
rich 23
find 23
less 23
difficulty 23
in 23
making 23
great 23
acquisitions 23
than 23
they 23
formerly 23
experienced 23
when 23
poor 23
in 23
making 23
acquisitions 23
of 23
much 23
smaller 23
amount 23
or 23
they 23
may 23
be 23
compared 23
to 23
the 23
commanders 23
of 23
armies 23
whose 23
forces 23
usually 23
increase 23
in 23
proportion 23
to 23
their 23
victories 23
and 23
who 23
need 23
greater 23
prudence 23
to 23
keep 23
together 23
the 23
residue 23
of 23
their 23
troops 23
after 23
a 23
defeat 23
than 23
after 23
a 23
victory 23
to 23
take 23
towns 23
and 23
provinces 23
for 23
he 23
truly 23
engages 23
in 23
battle 23
who 23
endeavors 23
to 23
surmount 23
all 23
the 23
difficulties 23
and 23
errors 23
which 23
prevent 23
him 23
from 23
reaching 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
truth 23
and 23
he 23
is 23
overcome 23
in 23
fight 23
who 23
admits 23
a 23
false 23
opinion 23
touching 23
a 23
matter 23
of 23
any 23
generality 23
and 23
importance 23
and 23
he 23
requires 23
thereafter 23
much 23
more 23
skill 23
to 23
recover 23
his 23
former 23
position 23
than 23
to 23
make 23
great 23
advances 23
when 23
once 23
in 23
possession 23
of 23
thoroughly 23
ascertained 23
principles 23
as 23
for 23
myself 23
if 23
i 23
have 23
succeeded 23
in 23
discovering 23
any 23
truths 23
in 23
the 23
sciences 23
and 23
i 23
trust 23
that 23
what 23
is 23
contained 23
in 23
this 23
volume 23
will 23
show 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
found 23
some 23
i 23
can 23
declare 23
that 23
they 23
are 23
but 23
the 23
consequences 23
and 23
results 23
of 23
five 23
or 23
six 23
principal 23
difficulties 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
surmounted 23
and 23
my 23
encounters 23
with 23
which 23
i 23
reckoned 23
as 23
battles 23
in 23
which 23
victory 23
declared 23
for 23
me 23
i 23
will 23
not 23
hesitate 23
even 23
to 23
avow 23
my 23
belief 23
that 23
nothing 23
further 23
is 23
wanting 23
to 23
enable 23
me 23
fully 23
to 23
realize 23
my 23
designs 23
than 23
to 23
gain 23
two 23
or 23
three 23
similar 23
victories 23
and 23
that 23
i 23
am 23
not 23
so 23
far 23
advanced 23
in 23
years 23
but 23
that 23
according 23
to 23
the 23
ordinary 23
course 23
of 23
nature 23
i 23
may 23
still 23
have 23
sufficient 23
leisure 23
for 23
this 23
end 23
but 23
i 23
conceive 23
myself 23
the 23
more 23
bound 23
to 23
husband 23
the 23
time 23
that 23
remains 23
the 23
greater 23
my 23
expectation 23
of 23
being 23
able 23
to 23
employ 23
it 23
aright 23
and 23
i 23
should 23
doubtless 23
have 23
much 23
to 23
rob 23
me 23
of 23
it 23
were 23
i 23
to 23
publish 23
the 23
principles 23
of 23
my 23
physics 23
for 23
although 23
they 23
are 23
almost 23
all 23
so 23
evident 23
that 23
to 23
assent 23
to 23
them 23
no 23
more 23
is 23
needed 23
than 23
simply 23
to 23
understand 23
them 23
and 23
although 23
there 23
is 23
not 23
one 23
of 23
them 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
expect 23
to 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
give 23
demonstration 23
yet 23
as 23
it 23
is 23
impossible 23
that 23
they 23
can 23
be 23
in 23
accordance 23
with 23
all 23
the 23
diverse 23
opinions 23
of 23
others 23
i 23
foresee 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
frequently 23
be 23
turned 23
aside 23
from 23
my 23
grand 23
design 23
on 23
occasion 23
of 23
the 23
opposition 23
which 23
they 23
would 23
be 23
sure 23
to 23
awaken 23
it 23
may 23
be 23
said 23
that 23
these 23
oppositions 23
would 23
be 23
useful 23
both 23
in 23
making 23
me 23
aware 23
of 23
my 23
errors 23
and 23
if 23
my 23
speculations 23
contain 23
anything 23
of 23
value 23
in 23
bringing 23
others 23
to 23
a 23
fuller 23
understanding 23
of 23
it 23
and 23
still 23
farther 23
as 23
many 23
can 23
see 23
better 23
than 23
one 23
in 23
leading 23
others 23
who 23
are 23
now 23
beginning 23
to 23
avail 23
themselves 23
of 23
my 23
principles 23
to 23
assist 23
me 23
in 23
turn 23
with 23
their 23
discoveries 23
but 23
though 23
i 23
recognize 23
my 23
extreme 23
liability 23
to 23
error 23
and 23
scarce 23
ever 23
trust 23
to 23
the 23
first 23
thoughts 23
which 23
occur 23
to 23
me 23
yetthe 23
experience 23
i 23
have 23
had 23
of 23
possible 23
objections 23
to 23
my 23
views 23
prevents 23
me 23
from 23
anticipating 23
any 23
profit 23
from 23
them 23
for 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
had 23
frequent 23
proof 23
of 23
the 23
judgments 23
as 23
well 23
of 23
those 23
i 23
esteemed 23
friends 23
as 23
of 23
some 23
others 23
to 23
whom 23
i 23
thought 23
i 23
was 23
an 23
object 23
of 23
indifference 23
and 23
even 23
of 23
some 23
whose 23
malignancy 23
and 23
envy 23
would 23
i 23
knew 23
determine 23
them 23
to 23
endeavor 23
to 23
discover 23
what 23
partiality 23
concealed 23
from 23
the 23
eyes 23
of 23
my 23
friends 23
but 23
it 23
has 23
rarely 23
happened 23
that 23
anything 23
has 23
been 23
objected 23
to 23
me 23
which 23
i 23
had 23
myself 23
altogether 23
overlooked 23
unless 23
it 23
were 23
something 23
far 23
removed 23
from 23
the 23
subject 23
so 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
met 23
with 23
a 23
single 23
critic 23
of 23
my 23
opinions 23
who 23
did 23
not 23
appear 23
to 23
me 23
either 23
less 23
rigorous 23
or 23
less 23
equitable 23
than 23
myself 23
and 23
further 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
observed 23
that 23
any 23
truth 23
before 23
unknown 23
has 23
been 23
brought 23
to 23
light 23
by 23
the 23
disputations 23
that 23
are 23
practised 23
in 23
the 23
schools 23
for 23
while 23
each 23
strives 23
for 23
the 23
victory 23
each 23
is 23
much 23
more 23
occupied 23
in 23
making 23
the 23
best 23
of 23
mere 23
verisimilitude 23
than 23
in 23
weighing 23
the 23
reasons 23
on 23
both 23
sides 23
of 23
the 23
question 23
and 23
those 23
who 23
have 23
been 23
long 23
good 23
advocates 23
are 23
not 23
afterwards 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
the 23
better 23
judges 23
as 23
for 23
the 23
advantage 23
that 23
others 23
would 23
derive 23
from 23
the 23
communication 23
of 23
my 23
thoughts 23
it 23
could 23
not 23
be 23
very 23
great 23
because 23
i 23
have 23
not 23
yet 23
so 23
far 23
prosecuted 23
them 23
as 23
that 23
much 23
does 23
not 23
remain 23
to 23
be 23
added 23
before 23
they 23
can 23
be 23
applied 23
to 23
practice 23
and 23
i 23
think 23
i 23
may 23
say 23
without 23
vanity 23
that 23
if 23
there 23
is 23
any 23
one 23
who 23
can 23
carry 23
them 23
out 23
that 23
length 23
it 23
must 23
be 23
myself 23
rather 23
than 23
another 23
not 23
that 23
there 23
may 23
not 23
be 23
in 23
the 23
world 23
many 23
minds 23
incomparably 23
superior 23
to 23
mine 23
but 23
because 23
one 23
cannot 23
so 23
well 23
seize 23
a 23
thing 23
and 23
make 23
it 23
ones 23
own 23
when 23
it 23
has 23
been 23
learned 23
from 23
another 23
as 23
when 23
one 23
has 23
himself 23
discovered 23
it 23
and 23
so 23
true 23
is 23
this 23
of 23
the 23
present 23
subject 23
that 23
though 23
i 23
have 23
often 23
explained 23
some 23
of 23
my 23
opinions 23
to 23
persons 23
of 23
much 23
acuteness 23
who 23
whilst 23
i 23
was 23
speaking 23
appeared 23
to 23
understand 23
them 23
very 23
distinctly 23
yet 23
when 23
they 23
repeated 23
them 23
i 23
have 23
observed 23
that 23
they 23
almost 23
always 23
changed 23
them 23
to 23
such 23
an 23
extent 23
that 23
i 23
could 23
no 23
longer 23
acknowledge 23
them 23
as 23
mine 23
i 23
am 23
glad 23
by 23
the 23
way 23
to 23
take 23
this 23
opportunity 23
of 23
requesting 23
posterity 23
never 23
to 23
believe 23
on 23
hearsay 23
that 23
anything 23
has 23
proceeded 23
from 23
me 23
which 23
has 23
not 23
been 23
published 23
by 23
myself 23
and 23
i 23
am 23
not 23
at 23
all 23
astonished 23
at 23
the 23
extravagances 23
attributed 23
to 23
those 23
ancient 23
philosophers 23
whose 23
own 23
writings 23
we 23
do 23
not 23
possess 23
whose 23
thoughts 23
however 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
suppose 23
to 23
have 23
been 23
really 23
absurd 23
seeing 23
they 23
were 23
among 23
the 23
ablest 23
men 23
of 23
their 23
times 23
but 23
only 23
that 23
these 23
have 23
been 23
falsely 23
represented 23
to 23
us 23
it 23
is 23
observable 23
accordingly 23
that 23
scarcely 23
in 23
a 23
single 23
instance 23
has 23
any 23
one 23
of 23
their 23
disciples 23
surpassed 23
them 23
and 23
i 23
am 23
quite 23
sure 23
that 23
the 23
most 23
devoted 23
of 23
the 23
present 23
followers 23
of 23
aristotle 23
would 23
think 23
themselves 23
happy 23
if 23
they 23
had 23
as 23
much 23
knowledge 23
of 23
nature 23
as 23
he 23
possessed 23
were 23
it 23
even 23
under 23
the 23
condition 23
that 23
they 23
should 23
never 23
afterwards 23
attain 23
to 23
higher 23
in 23
this 23
respect 23
they 23
are 23
like 23
the 23
ivy 23
which 23
never 23
strives 23
to 23
rise 23
above 23
the 23
tree 23
that 23
sustains 23
it 23
and 23
which 23
frequently 23
even 23
returns 23
downwards 23
when 23
it 23
has 23
reached 23
the 23
top 23
for 23
it 23
seems 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
they 23
also 23
sink 23
in 23
other 23
words 23
render 23
themselves 23
less 23
wise 23
than 23
they 23
would 23
be 23
if 23
they 23
gave 23
up 23
study 23
who 23
not 23
contented 23
with 23
knowing 23
all 23
that 23
is 23
intelligibly 23
explained 23
in 23
their 23
author 23
desire 23
in 23
addition 23
to 23
find 23
in 23
him 23
the 23
solution 23
of 23
many 23
difficulties 23
of 23
which 23
he 23
says 23
not 23
a 23
word 23
and 23
never 23
perhaps 23
so 23
much 23
as 23
thought 23
their 23
fashion 23
of 23
philosophizing 23
however 23
is 23
well 23
suited 23
to 23
persons 23
whose 23
abilities 23
fall 23
below 23
mediocrity 23
for 23
the 23
obscurity 23
of 23
the 23
distinctions 23
and 23
principles 23
of 23
which 23
they 23
make 23
use 23
enables 23
them 23
to 23
speak 23
of 23
all 23
things 23
with 23
as 23
much 23
confidence 23
as 23
if 23
they 23
really 23
knew 23
them 23
and 23
to 23
defend 23
all 23
that 23
they 23
say 23
on 23
any 23
subject 23
against 23
the 23
most 23
subtle 23
and 23
skillful 23
without 23
its 23
being 23
possible 23
for 23
any 23
one 23
to 23
convict 23
them 23
of 23
error 23
in 23
this 23
they 23
seem 23
to 23
me 23
to 23
be 23
like 23
a 23
blind 23
man 23
who 23
in 23
order 23
to 23
fight 23
on 23
equal 23
terms 23
with 23
a 23
person 23
that 23
sees 23
should 23
have 23
made 23
him 23
descend 23
to 23
the 23
bottom 23
of 23
an 23
intensely 23
dark 23
cave 23
and 23
i 23
may 23
say 23
that 23
such 23
persons 23
have 23
an 23
interest 23
in 23
my 23
refraining 23
from 23
publishing 23
the 23
principles 23
of 23
the 23
philosophy 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
make 23
use 23
for 23
since 23
these 23
are 23
of 23
a 23
kind 23
the 23
simplest 23
and 23
most 23
evident 23
i 23
should 23
by 23
publishing 23
them 23
do 23
much 23
the 23
same 23
as 23
if 23
i 23
were 23
to 23
throw 23
open 23
the 23
windows 23
and 23
allow 23
the 23
light 23
of 23
day 23
to 23
enter 23
the 23
cave 23
into 23
which 23
the 23
combatants 23
had 23
descended 23
but 23
even 23
superior 23
men 23
have 23
no 23
reason 23
for 23
any 23
great 23
anxiety 23
to 23
know 23
these 23
principles 23
for 23
if 23
what 23
they 23
desire 23
is 23
to 23
be 23
able 23
to 23
speak 23
of 23
all 23
things 23
and 23
to 23
acquire 23
a 23
reputation 23
for 23
learning 23
they 23
will 23
gain 23
their 23
end 23
more 23
easily 23
by 23
remaining 23
satisfied 23
with 23
the 23
appearance 23
of 23
truth 23
which 23
can 23
be 23
found 23
without 23
much 23
difficulty 23
in 23
all 23
sorts 23
of 23
matters 23
than 23
by 23
seeking 23
the 23
truth 23
itself 23
which 23
unfolds 23
itself 23
but 23
slowly 23
and 23
that 23
only 23
in 23
some 23
departments 23
while 23
it 23
obliges 23
us 23
when 23
we 23
have 23
to 23
speak 23
of 23
others 23
freely 23
to 23
confess 23
our 23
ignorance 23
if 23
however 23
they 23
prefer 23
the 23
knowledge 23
of 23
some 23
few 23
truths 23
to 23
the 23
vanity 23
of 23
appearing 23
ignorant 23
of 23
none 23
as 23
such 23
knowledge 23
is 23
undoubtedly 23
much 23
to 23
be 23
preferred 23
and 23
if 23
they 23
choose 23
to 23
follow 23
a 23
course 23
similar 23
to 23
mine 23
they 23
do 23
not 23
require 23
for 23
this 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
say 23
anything 23
more 23
than 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
said 23
in 23
this 23
discourse 23
for 23
if 23
they 23
are 23
capable 23
of 23
making 23
greater 23
advancement 23
than 23
i 23
have 23
made 23
they 23
will 23
much 23
more 23
be 23
able 23
of 23
themselves 23
to 23
discover 23
all 23
that 23
i 23
believe 23
myself 23
to 23
have 23
found 23
since 23
as 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
examined 23
aught 23
except 23
in 23
order 23
it 23
is 23
certain 23
that 23
what 23
yet 23
remains 23
to 23
be 23
discovered 23
is 23
in 23
itself 23
more 23
difficult 23
and 23
recondite 23
than 23
that 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
been 23
enabled 23
to 23
find 23
and 23
the 23
gratification 23
would 23
be 23
much 23
less 23
in 23
learning 23
it 23
from 23
me 23
than 23
in 23
discovering 23
it 23
for 23
themselves 23
besides 23
this 23
the 23
habit 23
which 23
they 23
will 23
acquire 23
by 23
seeking 23
first 23
what 23
is 23
easy 23
and 23
then 23
passing 23
onward 23
slowly 23
and 23
step 23
by 23
step 23
to 23
the 23
more 23
difficult 23
will 23
benefit 23
them 23
more 23
than 23
all 23
my 23
instructions 23
thus 23
in 23
my 23
own 23
case 23
i 23
am 23
persuaded 23
that 23
if 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
taught 23
from 23
my 23
youth 23
all 23
the 23
truths 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
since 23
sought 23
out 23
demonstrations 23
and 23
had 23
thus 23
learned 23
them 23
without 23
labour 23
i 23
should 23
never 23
perhaps 23
have 23
known 23
any 23
beyond 23
these 23
at 23
least 23
i 23
should 23
never 23
have 23
acquired 23
the 23
habit 23
and 23
the 23
facility 23
which 23
i 23
think 23
i 23
possess 23
in 23
always 23
discovering 23
new 23
truths 23
in 23
proportion 23
as 23
i 23
give 23
myself 23
to 23
the 23
search 23
and 23
in 23
a 23
single 23
word 23
if 23
there 23
is 23
any 23
work 23
in 23
the 23
world 23
which 23
cannot 23
be 23
so 23
well 23
finished 23
by 23
another 23
as 23
by 23
him 23
who 23
has 23
commenced 23
it 23
it 23
is 23
that 23
at 23
which 23
i 23
labour 23
it 23
is 23
true 23
indeed 23
as 23
regards 23
the 23
experiments 23
which 23
may 23
conduce 23
to 23
this 23
end 23
that 23
one 23
man 23
is 23
not 23
equal 23
to 23
the 23
task 23
of 23
making 23
them 23
all 23
but 23
yet 23
he 23
can 23
advantageously 23
avail 23
himself 23
in 23
this 23
work 23
of 23
no 23
hands 23
besides 23
his 23
own 23
unless 23
those 23
of 23
artisans 23
or 23
parties 23
of 23
the 23
same 23
kind 23
whom 23
he 23
could 23
pay 23
and 23
whom 23
the 23
hope 23
of 23
gain 23
a 23
means 23
of 23
great 23
efficacy 23
might 23
stimulate 23
to 23
accuracy 23
in 23
the 23
performance 23
of 23
what 23
was 23
prescribed 23
to 23
them 23
for 23
as 23
to 23
those 23
who 23
through 23
curiosity 23
or 23
a 23
desire 23
of 23
learning 23
of 23
their 23
own 23
accord 23
perhaps 23
offer 23
him 23
their 23
services 23
besides 23
that 23
in 23
general 23
their 23
promises 23
exceed 23
their 23
performance 23
and 23
that 23
they 23
sketch 23
out 23
fine 23
designs 23
of 23
which 23
not 23
one 23
is 23
ever 23
realized 23
they 23
will 23
without 23
doubt 23
expect 23
to 23
be 23
compensated 23
for 23
their 23
trouble 23
by 23
the 23
explication 23
of 23
some 23
difficulties 23
or 23
at 23
least 23
by 23
compliments 23
and 23
useless 23
speeches 23
in 23
which 23
he 23
cannot 23
spend 23
any 23
portion 23
of 23
his 23
time 23
without 23
loss 23
to 23
himself 23
and 23
as 23
for 23
the 23
experiments 23
that 23
others 23
have 23
already 23
made 23
even 23
although 23
these 23
parties 23
should 23
be 23
willing 23
of 23
themselves 23
to 23
communicate 23
them 23
to 23
him 23
which 23
is 23
what 23
those 23
who 23
esteem 23
them 23
secrets 23
will 23
never 23
do 23
the 23
experiments 23
are 23
for 23
the 23
most 23
part 23
accompanied 23
with 23
so 23
many 23
circumstances 23
and 23
superfluous 23
elements 23
as 23
to 23
make 23
it 23
exceedingly 23
difficult 23
to 23
disentangle 23
the 23
truth 23
from 23
its 23
adjuncts 23
besides 23
he 23
will 23
find 23
almost 23
all 23
of 23
them 23
so 23
ill 23
described 23
or 23
even 23
so 23
false 23
because 23
those 23
who 23
made 23
them 23
have 23
wished 23
to 23
see 23
in 23
them 23
only 23
such 23
facts 23
as 23
they 23
deemed 23
conformable 23
to 23
their 23
principles 23
that 23
if 23
in 23
the 23
entire 23
number 23
there 23
should 23
be 23
some 23
of 23
a 23
nature 23
suited 23
to 23
his 23
purpose 23
still 23
their 23
value 23
could 23
not 23
compensate 23
for 23
the 23
time 23
what 23
would 23
be 23
necessary 23
to 23
make 23
the 23
selection 23
so 23
that 23
if 23
there 23
existed 23
any 23
one 23
whom 23
we 23
assuredly 23
knew 23
to 23
be 23
capable 23
of 23
making 23
discoveries 23
of 23
the 23
highest 23
kind 23
and 23
of 23
the 23
greatest 23
possible 23
utility 23
to 23
the 23
public 23
and 23
if 23
all 23
other 23
men 23
were 23
therefore 23
eager 23
by 23
all 23
means 23
to 23
assist 23
him 23
in 23
successfully 23
prosecuting 23
his 23
designs 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
see 23
that 23
they 23
could 23
do 23
aught 23
else 23
for 23
him 23
beyond 23
contributing 23
to 23
defray 23
the 23
expenses 23
of 23
the 23
experiments 23
that 23
might 23
be 23
necessary 23
and 23
for 23
the 23
rest 23
prevent 23
his 23
being 23
deprived 23
of 23
his 23
leisure 23
by 23
the 23
unseasonable 23
interruptions 23
of 23
any 23
one 23
but 23
besides 23
that 23
i 23
neither 23
have 23
so 23
high 23
an 23
opinion 23
of 23
myself 23
as 23
to 23
be 23
willing 23
to 23
make 23
promise 23
of 23
anything 23
extraordinary 23
nor 23
feed 23
on 23
imaginations 23
so 23
vain 23
as 23
to 23
fancy 23
that 23
the 23
public 23
must 23
be 23
much 23
interested 23
in 23
my 23
designs 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
on 23
the 23
other 23
hand 23
own 23
a 23
soul 23
so 23
mean 23
as 23
to 23
be 23
capable 23
of 23
accepting 23
from 23
any 23
one 23
a 23
favor 23
of 23
which 23
it 23
could 23
be 23
supposed 23
that 23
i 23
was 23
unworthy 23
these 23
considerations 23
taken 23
together 23
were 23
the 23
reason 23
why 23
for 23
the 23
last 23
three 23
years 23
i 23
have 23
been 23
unwilling 23
to 23
publish 23
the 23
treatise 23
i 23
had 23
on 23
hand 23
and 23
why 23
i 23
even 23
resolved 23
to 23
give 23
publicity 23
during 23
my 23
life 23
to 23
no 23
other 23
that 23
was 23
so 23
general 23
or 23
by 23
which 23
the 23
principles 23
of 23
my 23
physics 23
might 23
be 23
understood 23
but 23
since 23
then 23
two 23
other 23
reasons 23
have 23
come 23
into 23
operation 23
that 23
have 23
determined 23
me 23
here 23
to 23
subjoin 23
some 23
particular 23
specimens 23
and 23
give 23
the 23
public 23
some 23
account 23
of 23
my 23
doings 23
and 23
designs 23
of 23
these 23
considerations 23
the 23
first 23
is 23
that 23
if 23
i 23
failed 23
to 23
do 23
so 23
many 23
who 23
were 23
cognizant 23
of 23
my 23
previous 23
intention 23
to 23
publish 23
some 23
writings 23
might 23
have 23
imagined 23
that 23
the 23
reasons 23
which 23
induced 23
me 23
to 23
refrain 23
from 23
so 23
doing 23
were 23
less 23
to 23
my 23
credit 23
than 23
they 23
really 23
are 23
for 23
although 23
i 23
am 23
not 23
immoderately 23
desirous 23
of 23
glory 23
or 23
even 23
if 23
i 23
may 23
venture 23
so 23
to 23
say 23
although 23
i 23
am 23
averse 23
from 23
it 23
in 23
so 23
far 23
as 23
i 23
deem 23
it 23
hostile 23
to 23
repose 23
which 23
i 23
hold 23
in 23
greater 23
account 23
than 23
aught 23
else 23
yet 23
at 23
the 23
same 23
time 23
i 23
have 23
never 23
sought 23
to 23
conceal 23
my 23
actions 23
as 23
if 23
they 23
were 23
crimes 23
nor 23
made 23
use 23
of 23
many 23
precautions 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
remain 23
unknown 23
and 23
this 23
partly 23
because 23
i 23
should 23
have 23
thought 23
such 23
a 23
course 23
of 23
conduct 23
a 23
wrong 23
against 23
myself 23
and 23
partly 23
because 23
it 23
would 23
have 23
occasioned 23
me 23
some 23
sort 23
of 23
uneasiness 23
which 23
would 23
again 23
have 23
been 23
contrary 23
to 23
the 23
perfect 23
mental 23
tranquillity 23
which 23
i 23
court 23
and 23
forasmuch 23
as 23
while 23
thus 23
indifferent 23
to 23
the 23
thought 23
alike 23
of 23
fame 23
or 23
of 23
forgetfulness 23
i 23
have 23
yet 23
been 23
unable 23
to 23
prevent 23
myself 23
from 23
acquiring 23
some 23
sort 23
of 23
reputation 23
i 23
have 23
thought 23
it 23
incumbent 23
on 23
me 23
to 23
do 23
my 23
best 23
to 23
save 23
myself 23
at 23
least 23
from 23
being 23
illspoken 23
of 23
the 23
other 23
reason 23
that 23
has 23
determined 23
me 23
to 23
commit 23
to 23
writing 23
these 23
specimens 23
of 23
philosophy 23
is 23
that 23
i 23
am 23
becoming 23
daily 23
more 23
and 23
more 23
alive 23
to 23
the 23
delay 23
which 23
my 23
design 23
of 23
selfinstruction 23
suffers 23
for 23
want 23
of 23
the 23
infinity 23
of 23
experiments 23
i 23
require 23
and 23
which 23
it 23
is 23
impossible 23
for 23
me 23
to 23
make 23
without 23
the 23
assistance 23
of 23
others 23
and 23
without 23
flattering 23
myself 23
so 23
much 23
as 23
to 23
expect 23
the 23
public 23
to 23
take 23
a 23
large 23
share 23
in 23
my 23
interests 23
i 23
am 23
yet 23
unwilling 23
to 23
be 23
found 23
so 23
far 23
wanting 23
in 23
the 23
duty 23
i 23
owe 23
to 23
myself 23
as 23
to 23
give 23
occasion 23
to 23
those 23
who 23
shall 23
survive 23
me 23
to 23
make 23
it 23
matter 23
of 23
reproach 23
against 23
me 23
some 23
day 23
that 23
i 23
might 23
have 23
left 23
them 23
many 23
things 23
in 23
a 23
much 23
more 23
perfect 23
state 23
than 23
i 23
have 23
done 23
had 23
i 23
not 23
too 23
much 23
neglected 23
to 23
make 23
them 23
aware 23
of 23
the 23
ways 23
in 23
which 23
they 23
could 23
have 23
promoted 23
the 23
accomplishment 23
of 23
my 23
designs 23
and 23
i 23
thought 23
that 23
it 23
was 23
easy 23
for 23
me 23
to 23
select 23
some 23
matters 23
which 23
should 23
neither 23
be 23
obnoxious 23
to 23
much 23
controversy 23
nor 23
should 23
compel 23
me 23
to 23
expound 23
more 23
of 23
my 23
principles 23
than 23
i 23
desired 23
and 23
which 23
should 23
yet 23
be 23
sufficient 23
clearly 23
to 23
exhibit 23
what 23
i 23
can 23
or 23
cannot 23
accomplish 23
in 23
the 23
sciences 23
whether 23
or 23
not 23
i 23
have 23
succeeded 23
in 23
this 23
it 23
is 23
not 23
for 23
me 23
to 23
say 23
and 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
wish 23
to 23
forestall 23
the 23
judgments 23
of 23
others 23
by 23
speaking 23
myself 23
of 23
my 23
writings 23
but 23
it 23
will 23
gratify 23
me 23
if 23
they 23
be 23
examined 23
and 23
to 23
afford 23
the 23
greater 23
inducement 23
to 23
this 23
i 23
request 23
all 23
who 23
may 23
have 23
any 23
objections 23
to 23
make 23
to 23
them 23
to 23
take 23
the 23
trouble 23
of 23
forwarding 23
these 23
to 23
my 23
publisher 23
who 23
will 23
give 23
me 23
notice 23
of 23
them 23
that 23
i 23
may 23
endeavor 23
to 23
subjoin 23
at 23
the 23
same 23
time 23
my 23
reply 23
and 23
in 23
this 23
way 23
readers 23
seeing 23
both 23
at 23
once 23
will 23
more 23
easily 23
determine 23
where 23
the 23
truth 23
lies 23
for 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
engage 23
in 23
any 23
case 23
to 23
make 23
prolix 23
replies 23
but 23
only 23
with 23
perfect 23
frankness 23
to 23
avow 23
my 23
errors 23
if 23
i 23
am 23
convinced 23
of 23
them 23
or 23
if 23
i 23
cannot 23
perceive 23
them 23
simply 23
to 23
state 23
what 23
i 23
think 23
is 23
required 23
for 23
defense 23
of 23
the 23
matters 23
i 23
have 23
written 23
adding 23
thereto 23
no 23
explication 23
of 23
any 23
new 23
matte 23
that 23
it 23
may 23
not 23
be 23
necessary 23
to 23
pass 23
without 23
end 23
from 23
one 23
thing 23
to 23
another 23
if 23
some 23
of 23
the 23
matters 23
of 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
spoken 23
in 23
the 23
beginning 23
of 23
the 23
dioptrics 23
and 23
meteorics 23
should 23
offend 23
at 23
first 23
sight 23
because 23
i 23
call 23
them 23
hypotheses 23
and 23
seem 23
indifferent 23
about 23
giving 23
proof 23
of 23
them 23
i 23
request 23
a 23
patient 23
and 23
attentive 23
reading 23
of 23
the 23
whole 23
from 23
which 23
i 23
hope 23
those 23
hesitating 23
will 23
derive 23
satisfaction 23
for 23
it 23
appears 23
to 23
me 23
that 23
the 23
reasonings 23
are 23
so 23
mutually 23
connected 23
in 23
these 23
treatises 23
that 23
as 23
the 23
last 23
are 23
demonstrated 23
by 23
the 23
first 23
which 23
are 23
their 23
causes 23
the 23
first 23
are 23
in 23
their 23
turn 23
demonstrated 23
by 23
the 23
last 23
which 23
are 23
their 23
effects 23
nor 23
must 23
it 23
be 23
imagined 23
that 23
i 23
here 23
commit 23
the 23
fallacy 23
which 23
the 23
logicians 23
call 23
a 23
circle 23
for 23
since 23
experience 23
renders 23
the 23
majority 23
of 23
these 23
effects 23
most 23
certain 23
the 23
causes 23
from 23
which 23
i 23
deduce 23
them 23
do 23
not 23
serve 23
so 23
much 23
to 23
establish 23
their 23
reality 23
as 23
to 23
explain 23
their 23
existence 23
but 23
on 23
the 23
contrary 23
the 23
reality 23
of 23
the 23
causes 23
is 23
established 23
by 23
the 23
reality 23
of 23
the 23
effects 23
nor 23
have 23
i 23
called 23
them 23
hypotheses 23
with 23
any 23
other 23
end 23
in 23
view 23
except 23
that 23
it 23
may 23
be 23
known 23
that 23
i 23
think 23
i 23
am 23
able 23
to 23
deduce 23
them 23
from 23
those 23
first 23
truths 23
which 23
i 23
have 23
already 23
expounded 23
and 23
yet 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
expressly 23
determined 23
not 23
to 23
do 23
so 23
to 23
prevent 23
a 23
certain 23
class 23
of 23
minds 23
from 23
thence 23
taking 23
occasion 23
to 23
build 23
some 23
extravagant 23
philosophy 23
upon 23
what 23
they 23
may 23
take 23
to 23
be 23
my 23
principles 23
and 23
my 23
being 23
blamed 23
for 23
it 23
i 23
refer 23
to 23
those 23
who 23
imagine 23
that 23
they 23
can 23
master 23
in 23
a 23
day 23
all 23
that 23
another 23
has 23
taken 23
twenty 23
years 23
to 23
think 23
out 23
as 23
soon 23
as 23
he 23
has 23
spoken 23
two 23
or 23
three 23
words 23
to 23
them 23
on 23
the 23
subject 23
or 23
who 23
are 23
the 23
more 23
liable 23
to 23
error 23
and 23
the 23
less 23
capable 23
of 23
perceiving 23
truth 23
in 23
very 23
proportion 23
as 23
they 23
are 23
more 23
subtle 23
and 23
lively 23
as 23
to 23
the 23
opinions 23
which 23
are 23
truly 23
and 23
wholly 23
mine 23
i 23
offer 23
no 23
apology 23
for 23
them 23
as 23
new 23
persuaded 23
as 23
i 23
am 23
that 23
if 23
their 23
reasons 23
be 23
well 23
considered 23
they 23
will 23
be 23
found 23
to 23
be 23
so 23
simple 23
and 23
so 23
conformed 23
to 23
common 23
sense 23
as 23
to 23
appear 23
less 23
extraordinary 23
and 23
less 23
paradoxical 23
than 23
any 23
others 23
which 23
can 23
be 23
held 23
on 23
the 23
same 23
subjects 23
nor 23
do 23
i 23
even 23
boast 23
of 23
being 23
the 23
earliest 23
discoverer 23
of 23
any 23
of 23
them 23
but 23
only 23
of 23
having 23
adopted 23
them 23
neither 23
because 23
they 23
had 23
nor 23
because 23
they 23
had 23
not 23
been 23
held 23
by 23
others 23
but 23
solely 23
because 23
reason 23
has 23
convinced 23
me 23
of 23
their 23
truth 23
though 23
artisans 23
may 23
not 23
be 23
able 23
at 23
once 23
to 23
execute 23
the 23
invention 23
which 23
is 23
explained 23
in 23
the 23
dioptrics 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
think 23
that 23
any 23
one 23
on 23
that 23
account 23
is 23
entitled 23
to 23
condemn 23
it 23
for 23
since 23
address 23
and 23
practice 23
are 23
required 23
in 23
order 23
so 23
to 23
make 23
and 23
adjust 23
the 23
machines 23
described 23
by 23
me 23
as 23
not 23
to 23
overlook 23
the 23
smallest 23
particular 23
i 23
should 23
not 23
be 23
less 23
astonished 23
if 23
they 23
succeeded 23
on 23
the 23
first 23
attempt 23
than 23
if 23
a 23
person 23
were 23
in 23
one 23
day 23
to 23
become 23
an 23
accomplished 23
performer 23
on 23
the 23
guitar 23
by 23
merely 23
having 23
excellent 23
sheets 23
of 23
music 23
set 23
up 23
before 23
him 23
and 23
if 23
i 23
write 23
in 23
french 23
which 23
is 23
the 23
language 23
of 23
my 23
country 23
in 23
preference 23
to 23
latin 23
which 23
is 23
that 23
of 23
my 23
preceptors 23
it 23
is 23
because 23
i 23
expect 23
that 23
those 23
who 23
make 23
use 23
of 23
their 23
unprejudiced 23
natural 23
reason 23
will 23
be 23
better 23
judges 23
of 23
my 23
opinions 23
than 23
those 23
who 23
give 23
heed 23
to 23
the 23
writings 23
of 23
the 23
ancients 23
only 23
and 23
as 23
for 23
those 23
who 23
unite 23
good 23
sense 23
with 23
habits 23
of 23
study 23
whom 23
alone 23
i 23
desire 23
for 23
judges 23
they 23
will 23
not 23
i 23
feel 23
assured 23
be 23
so 23
partial 23
to 23
latin 23
as 23
to 23
refuse 23
to 23
listen 23
to 23
my 23
reasonings 23
merely 23
because 23
i 23
expound 23
them 23
in 23
the 23
vulgar 23
tongue 23
in 23
conclusion 23
i 23
am 23
unwilling 23
here 23
to 23
say 23
anything 23
very 23
specific 23
of 23
the 23
progress 23
which 23
i 23
expect 23
to 23
make 23
for 23
the 23
future 23
in 23
the 23
sciences 23
or 23
to 23
bind 23
myself 23
to 23
the 23
public 23
by 23
any 23
promise 23
which 23
i 23
am 23
not 23
certain 23
of 23
being 23
able 23
to 23
fulfill 23
but 23
this 23
only 23
will 23
i 23
say 23
that 23
i 23
have 23
resolved 23
to 23
devote 23
what 23
time 23
i 23
may 23
still 23
have 23
to 23
live 23
to 23
no 23
other 23
occupation 23
than 23
that 23
of 23
endeavoring 23
to 23
acquire 23
some 23
knowledge 23
of 23
nature 23
which 23
shall 23
be 23
of 23
such 23
a 23
kind 23
as 23
to 23
enable 23
us 23
therefrom 23
to 23
deduce 23
rules 23
in 23
medicine 23
of 23
greater 23
certainty 23
than 23
those 23
at 23
present 23
in 23
use 23
and 23
that 23
my 23
inclination 23
is 23
so 23
much 23
opposed 23
to 23
all 23
other 23
pursuits 23
especially 23
to 23
such 23
as 23
cannot 23
be 23
useful 23
to 23
some 23
without 23
being 23
hurtful 23
to 23
others 23
that 23
if 23
by 23
any 23
circumstances 23
i 23
had 23
been 23
constrained 23
to 23
engage 23
in 23
such 23
i 23
do 23
not 23
believe 23
that 23
i 23
should 23
have 23
been 23
able 23
to 23
succeed 23
of 23

preface 24
this 24
work 24
is 24
called 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
not 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
although 24
its 24
parallelism 24
with 24
the 24
speculative 24
critique 24
would 24
seem 24
to 24
require 24
the 24
latter 24
term 24
the 24
reason 24
of 24
this 24
appears 24
sufficiently 24
from 24
the 24
treatise 24
itself 24
its 24
business 24
is 24
to 24
show 24
that 24
there 24
is 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
for 24
this 24
purpose 24
it 24
criticizes 24
the 24
entire 24
practical 24
faculty 24
of 24
reason 24
if 24
it 24
succeeds 24
in 24
this 24
it 24
has 24
no 24
need 24
to 24
criticize 24
the 24
pure 24
faculty 24
itself 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
see 24
whether 24
reason 24
in 24
making 24
such 24
a 24
claim 24
does 24
not 24
presumptuously 24
overstep 24
itself 24
as 24
is 24
the 24
case 24
with 24
the 24
speculative 24
reason 24
for 24
if 24
as 24
pure 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
actually 24
practical 24
it 24
proves 24
its 24
own 24
reality 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
its 24
concepts 24
by 24
fact 24
and 24
all 24
disputation 24
against 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
its 24
being 24
real 24
is 24
futile 24
with 24
this 24
faculty 24
transcendental 24
freedom 24
is 24
also 24
established 24
freedom 24
namely 24
in 24
that 24
absolute 24
sense 24
in 24
which 24
speculative 24
reason 24
required 24
it 24
in 24
its 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
causality 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
escape 24
the 24
antinomy 24
into 24
which 24
it 24
inevitably 24
falls 24
when 24
in 24
the 24
chain 24
of 24
cause 24
and 24
effect 24
it 24
tries 24
to 24
think 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
speculative 24
reason 24
could 24
only 24
exhibit 24
this 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
problematically 24
as 24
not 24
impossible 24
to 24
thought 24
without 24
assuring 24
it 24
any 24
objective 24
reality 24
and 24
merely 24
lest 24
the 24
supposed 24
impossibility 24
of 24
what 24
it 24
must 24
at 24
least 24
allow 24
to 24
be 24
thinkable 24
should 24
endanger 24
its 24
very 24
being 24
and 24
plunge 24
it 24
into 24
an 24
abyss 24
of 24
scepticism 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
the 24
reality 24
of 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
is 24
proved 24
by 24
an 24
apodeictic 24
law 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
keystone 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
system 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
even 24
the 24
speculative 24
and 24
all 24
other 24
concepts 24
those 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
immortality 24
which 24
as 24
being 24
mere 24
ideas 24
remain 24
in 24
it 24
unsupported 24
now 24
attach 24
themselves 24
to 24
this 24
concept 24
and 24
by 24
it 24
obtain 24
consistence 24
and 24
objective 24
reality 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
their 24
possibility 24
is 24
proved 24
by 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
freedom 24
actually 24
exists 24
for 24
this 24
idea 24
is 24
revealed 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
freedom 24
however 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
one 24
of 24
all 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
the 24
speculative 24
reason 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
know 24
the 24
possibility 24
a 24
priori 24
without 24
however 24
understanding 24
it 24
because 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
we 24
know 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
immortality 24
however 24
are 24
not 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
but 24
only 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
necessary 24
object 24
of 24
a 24
will 24
determined 24
by 24
this 24
law 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
our 24
pure 24
reason 24
hence 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
these 24
ideas 24
we 24
cannot 24
affirm 24
that 24
we 24
know 24
and 24
understand 24
i 24
will 24
not 24
say 24
the 24
actuality 24
but 24
even 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
them 24
however 24
they 24
are 24
the 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
application 24
of 24
the 24
morally 24
determined 24
will 24
to 24
its 24
object 24
which 24
is 24
given 24
to 24
it 24
a 24
priori 24
viz 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
consequently 24
in 24
this 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
their 24
possibility 24
must 24
be 24
assumed 24
although 24
we 24
cannot 24
theoretically 24
know 24
and 24
understand 24
it 24
to 24
justify 24
this 24
assumption 24
it 24
is 24
sufficient 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
that 24
they 24
contain 24
no 24
intrinsic 24
impossibility 24
contradiction 24
here 24
we 24
have 24
what 24
as 24
far 24
as 24
speculative 24
reason 24
is 24
concerned 24
is 24
a 24
merely 24
subjective 24
principle 24
of 24
assent 24
which 24
however 24
is 24
objectively 24
valid 24
for 24
a 24
reason 24
equally 24
pure 24
but 24
practical 24
and 24
this 24
principle 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
assures 24
objective 24
reality 24
and 24
authority 24
to 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
immortality 24
nay 24
there 24
is 24
a 24
subjective 24
necessity 24
a 24
need 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
to 24
assume 24
them 24
nevertheless 24
the 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
of 24
reason 24
is 24
not 24
hereby 24
enlarged 24
but 24
only 24
the 24
possibility 24
is 24
given 24
which 24
heretofore 24
was 24
merely 24
a 24
problem 24
and 24
now 24
becomes 24
assertion 24
and 24
thus 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
is 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
elements 24
of 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
and 24
this 24
need 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
merely 24
hypothetical 24
one 24
for 24
the 24
arbitrary 24
purposes 24
of 24
speculation 24
that 24
we 24
must 24
assume 24
something 24
if 24
we 24
wish 24
in 24
speculation 24
to 24
carry 24
reason 24
to 24
its 24
utmost 24
limits 24
but 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
need 24
which 24
has 24
the 24
force 24
of 24
law 24
to 24
assume 24
something 24
without 24
which 24
that 24
cannot 24
be 24
which 24
we 24
must 24
inevitably 24
set 24
before 24
us 24
as 24
the 24
aim 24
of 24
our 24
action 24
preface 24
paragraph 24
lest 24
any 24
one 24
should 24
imagine 24
that 24
he 24
finds 24
an 24
inconsistency 24
here 24
when 24
i 24
call 24
freedom 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
hereafter 24
maintain 24
in 24
the 24
treatise 24
itself 24
that 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
the 24
condition 24
under 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
first 24
become 24
conscious 24
of 24
freedom 24
i 24
will 24
merely 24
remark 24
that 24
freedom 24
is 24
the 24
ratio 24
essendi 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
while 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
the 24
ratio 24
cognoscendi 24
of 24
freedom 24
for 24
pad 24
not 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
been 24
previously 24
distinctly 24
thought 24
in 24
our 24
reason 24
we 24
should 24
never 24
consider 24
ourselves 24
justified 24
in 24
assuming 24
such 24
a 24
thing 24
as 24
freedom 24
although 24
it 24
be 24
not 24
contradictory 24
but 24
were 24
there 24
no 24
freedom 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
impossible 24
to 24
trace 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
in 24
ourselves 24
at 24
all 24
it 24
would 24
certainly 24
be 24
more 24
satisfactory 24
to 24
our 24
speculative 24
reason 24
if 24
it 24
could 24
solve 24
these 24
problems 24
for 24
itself 24
without 24
this 24
circuit 24
and 24
preserve 24
the 24
solution 24
for 24
practical 24
use 24
as 24
a 24
thing 24
to 24
be 24
referred 24
to 24
but 24
in 24
fact 24
our 24
faculty 24
of 24
speculation 24
is 24
not 24
so 24
well 24
provided 24
those 24
who 24
boast 24
of 24
such 24
high 24
knowledge 24
ought 24
not 24
to 24
keep 24
it 24
back 24
but 24
to 24
exhibit 24
it 24
publicly 24
that 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
tested 24
and 24
appreciated 24
they 24
want 24
to 24
prove 24
very 24
good 24
let 24
them 24
prove 24
and 24
the 24
critical 24
philosophy 24
lays 24
its 24
arms 24
at 24
their 24
feet 24
as 24
the 24
victors 24
quid 24
statis 24
nolint 24
atqui 24
licet 24
esse 24
beatis 24
as 24
they 24
then 24
do 24
not 24
in 24
fact 24
choose 24
to 24
do 24
so 24
probably 24
because 24
they 24
cannot 24
we 24
must 24
take 24
up 24
these 24
arms 24
again 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
seek 24
in 24
the 24
mortal 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
and 24
to 24
base 24
on 24
this 24
the 24
notions 24
of 24
god 24
freedom 24
and 24
immortality 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
which 24
speculation 24
cannot 24
adequately 24
prove 24
here 24
first 24
is 24
explained 24
the 24
enigma 24
of 24
the 24
critical 24
philosophy 24
viz 24
how 24
we 24
deny 24
objective 24
reality 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
categories 24
in 24
speculation 24
and 24
yet 24
admit 24
this 24
reality 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
this 24
must 24
at 24
first 24
seem 24
inconsistent 24
as 24
long 24
as 24
this 24
practical 24
use 24
is 24
only 24
nominally 24
known 24
but 24
when 24
by 24
a 24
thorough 24
analysis 24
of 24
it 24
one 24
becomes 24
aware 24
that 24
the 24
reality 24
spoken 24
of 24
does 24
not 24
imply 24
any 24
theoretical 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
categories 24
and 24
extension 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
but 24
that 24
what 24
is 24
meant 24
is 24
that 24
in 24
this 24
respect 24
an 24
object 24
belongs 24
to 24
them 24
because 24
either 24
they 24
are 24
contained 24
in 24
the 24
necessary 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
a 24
priori 24
or 24
are 24
inseparably 24
connected 24
with 24
its 24
object 24
then 24
this 24
inconsistency 24
disappears 24
because 24
the 24
use 24
we 24
make 24
of 24
these 24
concepts 24
is 24
different 24
from 24
what 24
speculative 24
reason 24
requires 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
there 24
now 24
appears 24
an 24
unexpected 24
and 24
very 24
satisfactory 24
proof 24
of 24
the 24
consistency 24
of 24
the 24
speculative 24
critical 24
philosophy 24
for 24
whereas 24
it 24
insisted 24
that 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
as 24
such 24
including 24
our 24
own 24
subject 24
have 24
only 24
the 24
value 24
of 24
phenomena 24
while 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
must 24
be 24
supposed 24
as 24
their 24
basis 24
so 24
that 24
not 24
everything 24
supersensible 24

on 24

all 24
possible 24
to 24

any 24
notion 24

that 24
we 24

remove 24
all 24
this 24

a 24
clear 24

the 24

which 24
constitutes 24

merit 24

much 24
by 24
way 24
of 24

already 24
undergone 24
their 24
special 24

examination 24
are 24
now 24

then 24
again 24
subjected 24
to 24
examination 24
this 24
would 24
not 24
in 24
other 24
cases 24
be 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
the 24
systematic 24
process 24
by 24
which 24
a 24
science 24
is 24
established 24
since 24
matters 24
which 24
have 24
been 24
decided 24
ought 24
only 24
to 24
be 24
cited 24
and 24
not 24
again 24
discussed 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
however 24
it 24
was 24
not 24
only 24
allowable 24
but 24
necessary 24
because 24
reason 24
is 24
here 24
considered 24
in 24
transition 24
to 24
a 24
different 24
use 24
of 24
these 24
concepts 24
from 24
what 24
it 24
had 24
made 24
of 24
them 24
before 24
such 24
a 24
transition 24
necessitates 24
a 24
comparison 24
of 24
the 24
old 24
and 24
the 24
new 24
usage 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
distinguish 24
well 24
the 24
new 24
path 24
from 24
the 24
old 24
one 24
and 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
to 24
allow 24
their 24
connection 24
to 24
be 24
observed 24
accordingly 24
considerations 24
of 24
this 24
kind 24
including 24
those 24
which 24
are 24
once 24
more 24
directed 24
to 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
in 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
reason 24
must 24
not 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
an 24
interpolation 24
serving 24
only 24
to 24
fill 24
up 24
the 24
gaps 24
in 24
the 24
critical 24
system 24
of 24
speculative 24
reason 24
for 24
this 24
is 24
for 24
its 24
own 24
purpose 24
complete 24
or 24
like 24
the 24
props 24
and 24
buttresses 24
which 24
in 24
a 24
hastily 24
constructed 24
building 24
are 24
often 24
added 24
afterwards 24
but 24
as 24
true 24
members 24
which 24
make 24
the 24
connexion 24
of 24
the 24
system 24
plain 24
and 24
show 24
us 24
concepts 24
here 24
presented 24
as 24
real 24
which 24
there 24
could 24
only 24
be 24
presented 24
problematically 24
this 24
remark 24
applies 24
especially 24
to 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
respecting 24
which 24
one 24
cannot 24
but 24
observe 24
with 24
surprise 24
that 24
so 24
many 24
boast 24
of 24
being 24
able 24
to 24
understand 24
it 24
quite 24
well 24
and 24
to 24
explain 24
its 24
possibility 24
while 24
they 24
regard 24
it 24
only 24
psychologically 24
whereas 24
if 24
they 24
had 24
studied 24
it 24
in 24
a 24
transcendental 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
they 24
must 24
have 24
recognized 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
only 24
indispensable 24
as 24
a 24
problematical 24
concept 24
in 24
the 24
complete 24
use 24
of 24
speculative 24
reason 24
but 24
also 24
quite 24
incomprehensible 24
and 24
if 24
they 24
afterwards 24
came 24
to 24
consider 24
its 24
practical 24
use 24
they 24
must 24
needs 24
have 24
come 24
to 24
the 24
very 24
mode 24
of 24
determining 24
the 24
principles 24
of 24
this 24
to 24
which 24
they 24
are 24
now 24
so 24
loth 24
to 24
assent 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
is 24
the 24
stone 24
of 24
stumbling 24
for 24
all 24
empiricists 24
but 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
the 24
key 24
to 24
the 24
loftiest 24
practical 24
principles 24
for 24
critical 24
moralists 24
who 24
perceive 24
by 24
its 24
means 24
that 24
they 24
must 24
necessarily 24
proceed 24
by 24
a 24
rational 24
method 24
for 24
this 24
reason 24
i 24
beg 24
the 24
reader 24
not 24
to 24
pass 24
lightly 24
over 24
what 24
is 24
said 24
of 24
this 24
concept 24
at 24
the 24
end 24
of 24
the 24
analytic 24
i 24
must 24
leave 24
it 24
to 24
those 24
who 24
are 24
acquainted 24
with 24
works 24
of 24
this 24
kind 24
to 24
judge 24
whether 24
such 24
a 24
system 24
as 24
that 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24
which 24
is 24
here 24
developed 24
from 24
the 24
critical 24
examination 24
of 24
it 24
has 24
cost 24
much 24
or 24
little 24
trouble 24
especially 24
in 24
seeking 24
not 24
to 24
miss 24
the 24
true 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
from 24
which 24
the 24
whole 24
can 24
be 24
rightly 24
sketched 24
it 24
presupposes 24
indeed 24
the 24
fundamental 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
metaphysic 24
of 24
morals 24
but 24
only 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
this 24
gives 24
a 24
preliminary 24
acquaintance 24
with 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
duty 24
and 24
assigns 24
and 24
justifies 24
a 24
definite 24
formula 24
thereof 24
in 24
other 24
respects 24
it 24
is 24
independent 24
it 24
results 24
from 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
this 24
practical 24
faculty 24
itself 24
that 24
the 24
complete 24
classification 24
of 24
all 24
practical 24
sciences 24
cannot 24
be 24
added 24
as 24
in 24
the 24
critique 24

with 24
a 24
view 24
to 24
their 24
classification 24
until 24
the 24

of 24
this 24

however 24
does 24
not 24

critical 24
examination 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24

the 24

which 24

better 24
perhaps 24
than 24

forth 24

that 24

me 24
that 24
i 24
have 24
not 24
first 24
defined 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
or 24
of 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
although 24
this 24
reproach 24
would 24
be 24
unfair 24
because 24
this 24
definition 24
might 24
reasonably 24
be 24
presupposed 24
as 24
given 24
in 24
psychology 24
however 24
the 24
definition 24
there 24
given 24
might 24
be 24
such 24
as 24
to 24
found 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
on 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
as 24
is 24
commonly 24
done 24
and 24
thus 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
practical 24
philosophy 24
would 24
be 24
necessarily 24
made 24
empirical 24
which 24
however 24
remains 24
to 24
be 24
proved 24
and 24
in 24
this 24
critique 24
is 24
altogether 24
refuted 24
it 24
will 24
therefore 24
give 24
this 24
definition 24
here 24
in 24
such 24
a 24
manner 24
as 24
it 24
ought 24
to 24
be 24
given 24
in 24

leave 24
this 24
contested 24

itself 24
supplies 24
the 24
rest 24
it 24
is 24
easily 24
seen 24
that 24
the 24
question 24
whether 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
is 24
always 24
based 24
on 24
pleasure 24

whether 24

certain 24
conditions 24
pleasure 24
only 24
follows 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24

by 24
this 24
definition 24
left 24
undecided 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
composed 24
only 24
of 24
terms 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
ie 24
of 24
categories 24
which 24
contain 24
nothing 24
empirical 24
such 24
precaution 24
is 24
very 24
desirable 24
in 24
all 24
philosophy 24
and 24
yet 24
is 24
often 24
neglected 24
namely 24
not 24
to 24
prejudge 24
questions 24
by 24
adventuring 24
definitions 24
before 24
the 24
notion 24
has 24
been 24
completely 24
analysed 24
which 24
is 24
often 24
very 24
late 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
observed 24
through 24
the 24
whole 24
course 24
of 24
the 24
critical 24
philosophy 24
of 24
the 24
theoretical 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24
that 24
frequent 24
opportunity 24
offers 24
of 24
supplying 24
defects 24
in 24
the 24
old 24
dogmatic 24
method 24
of 24
philosophy 24
and 24
of 24
correcting 24
errors 24
which 24
are 24
not 24
observed 24
until 24
we 24
make 24
such 24
rational 24
use 24
of 24
these 24
notions 24
viewing 24
them 24
as 24
a 24
whole 24
when 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
study 24
a 24
particular 24
faculty 24
of 24
the 24
human 24
mind 24
in 24
its 24
sources 24
its 24
content 24
and 24
its 24
limits 24
then 24
from 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
human 24
knowledge 24
we 24
must 24
begin 24
with 24
its 24
parts 24
with 24
an 24
accurate 24
and 24
complete 24
exposition 24
of 24
them 24
complete 24
namely 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
is 24
possible 24
in 24
the 24
present 24
state 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
of 24
its 24
elements 24
but 24
there 24
is 24
another 24
thing 24
to 24
be 24
attended 24
to 24
which 24
is 24
of 24
a 24
more 24
philosophical 24
and 24
architectonic 24
character 24
namely 24
to 24
grasp 24
correctly 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
and 24
from 24
thence 24
to 24
get 24
a 24
view 24
of 24
all 24
those 24
parts 24
as 24
mutually 24
related 24
by 24
the 24
aid 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
and 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
their 24
derivation 24
from 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
this 24
is 24
only 24
possible 24
through 24
the 24
most 24
intimate 24
acquaintance 24
with 24
the 24
system 24
and 24
those 24
who 24
find 24
the 24
first 24
inquiry 24
too 24
troublesome 24
and 24
do 24
not 24
think 24
it 24
worth 24
their 24
while 24
to 24
attain 24
such 24
an 24
acquaintance 24
cannot 24
reach 24
the 24
second 24
stage 24
namely 24
the 24
general 24
view 24
which 24
is 24
a 24
synthetical 24
return 24
to 24
that 24
which 24
had 24
previously 24
been 24
given 24
analytically 24
it 24
is 24
no 24
wonder 24
then 24
if 24
they 24
find 24
inconsistencies 24
everywhere 24
although 24
the 24
gaps 24
which 24
these 24
indicate 24
are 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
system 24
itself 24
but 24
in 24
their 24
own 24
incoherent 24
train 24
of 24
thought 24
i 24
have 24
no 24
fear 24
as 24
regards 24
this 24
treatise 24
of 24
the 24
reproach 24
that 24
i 24
wish 24
to 24
introduce 24
a 24
new 24
language 24
since 24
the 24
sort 24
of 24
knowledge 24
here 24
in 24
question 24
has 24
itself 24
somewhat 24
of 24
an 24
everyday 24
character 24
nor 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
the 24
former 24
critique 24
could 24
this 24
reproach 24
occur 24
to 24
anyone 24
who 24
had 24
thought 24
it 24
through 24
and 24
not 24
merely 24
turned 24
over 24
the 24
leaves 24
to 24
invent 24
new 24
words 24
where 24
the 24
language 24
has 24
no 24
lack 24
of 24
expressions 24
for 24
given 24
notions 24
is 24
a 24
childish 24
effort 24
to 24
distinguish 24
oneself 24
from 24
the 24
crowd 24
if 24
not 24
by 24
new 24
and 24
true 24
thoughts 24
yet 24
by 24
new 24
patches 24
on 24
the 24
old 24
garment 24
if 24
therefore 24
the 24
readers 24
of 24
that 24
work 24
know 24
any 24
more 24
familiar 24
expressions 24
which 24
are 24
as 24
suitable 24
to 24
the 24
thought 24
as 24
those 24
seem 24
to 24
me 24
to 24
be 24
or 24
if 24
they 24
think 24
they 24
can 24
show 24
the 24
futility 24
of 24
these 24
thoughts 24
themselves 24
and 24
hence 24
that 24
of 24
the 24
expression 24
they 24
would 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
case 24
very 24
much 24
oblige 24
me 24
for 24
i 24
only 24
desire 24
to 24
be 24
understood 24
and 24
in 24
the 24
second 24
case 24
they 24
would 24
deserve 24
well 24
of 24
philosophy 24
but 24
as 24
long 24
as 24
these 24
thoughts 24
stand 24
i 24
very 24
much 24
doubt 24
that 24
suitable 24
and 24
yet 24
more 24
common 24
expressions 24
for 24
them 24
can 24
be 24
found 24
preface 24
paragraph 24
i 24
am 24
more 24
afraid 24
in 24
the 24
present 24
treatise 24
of 24
occasional 24
misconception 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
some 24
expressions 24
which 24
i 24
have 24
chosen 24
with 24
the 24
greatest 24
care 24
in 24
order 24
that 24
the 24
notion 24
to 24
which 24
they 24
point 24
may 24
not 24
be 24
missed 24
thus 24
in 24
the 24
table 24
of 24
categories 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24
under 24
the 24
title 24
of 24
modality 24
the 24
permitted 24
and 24
forbidden 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
objective 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
possible 24
and 24
impossible 24
have 24
almost 24
the 24
same 24
meaning 24
in 24
common 24
language 24
as 24
the 24
next 24
category 24
duty 24
and 24
contrary 24
to 24
duty 24
here 24
however 24
the 24
former 24
means 24
what 24
coincides 24
with 24
or 24
contradicts 24
a 24
merely 24
possible 24
practical 24
precept 24
for 24
example 24
the 24
solution 24
of 24
all 24
problems 24
of 24
geometry 24
and 24
mechanics 24
the 24
latter 24
what 24
is 24
similarly 24
related 24
to 24
a 24
law 24
actually 24
present 24
in 24
the 24
reason 24
and 24
this 24
distinction 24
is 24
not 24
quite 24
foreign 24
even 24
to 24
common 24
language 24
although 24
somewhat 24
unusual 24
for 24
example 24
it 24
is 24
forbidden 24
to 24
an 24
orator 24
as 24
such 24
to 24
forge 24
new 24
words 24
or 24
constructions 24
in 24
a 24
certain 24
degree 24
this 24
is 24
permitted 24
to 24
a 24
poet 24
in 24
neither 24
case 24
is 24
there 24
any 24
question 24
of 24
duty 24
for 24
if 24
anyone 24
chooses 24
to 24
forfeit 24
his 24
reputation 24
as 24
an 24
orator 24
no 24
one 24
can 24
prevent 24
him 24
we 24
have 24
here 24
only 24
to 24
do 24
with 24
the 24
distinction 24
of 24
imperatives 24
into 24
problematical 24
assertorial 24
and 24
apodeictic 24
similarly 24

i 24

moral 24

practical 24
perfection 24

have 24
distinguished 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
wisdom 24
from 24
that 24
of 24
holiness 24
although 24
i 24
have 24
stated 24
that 24
essentially 24
and 24
objectively 24
they 24
are 24
the 24
same 24
but 24
in 24
that 24
place 24
i 24
understand 24
by 24
the 24
former 24
only 24
that 24
wisdom 24
to 24
which 24
man 24
the 24
stoic 24
lays 24
claim 24
therefore 24
i 24
take 24
it 24
subjectively 24
as 24
an 24
attribute 24
alleged 24
to 24
belong 24
to 24
man 24
perhaps 24
the 24
expression 24
virtue 24
with 24
which 24
also 24
the 24
made 24
great 24
show 24
would 24
better 24
mark 24
the 24
characteristic 24
of 24
his 24
school 24
the 24
expression 24
of 24
a 24
postulate 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
might 24
give 24
most 24
occasion 24
to 24
misapprehension 24
in 24
case 24
the 24
reader 24
confounded 24
it 24
with 24
the 24
signification 24
of 24
the 24
postulates 24
in 24
pure 24
mathematics 24
which 24
carry 24
apodeictic 24
certainty 24
with 24
them 24
these 24
however 24
postulate 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
an 24
action 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
which 24
has 24
been 24
previously 24
recognized 24
a 24
priori 24
in 24
theory 24
as 24
possible 24
and 24
that 24
with 24
perfect 24
certainty 24
but 24
the 24
former 24
postulates 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
itself 24
god 24
and 24
the 24
immortality 24
of 24
the 24
soul 24
from 24
apodeictic 24
practical 24
laws 24
and 24
therefore 24
only 24
for 24
the 24
purposes 24
of 24
a 24
practical 24
reason 24
this 24
certainty 24
of 24
the 24
postulated 24
possibility 24
then 24
is 24
not 24
at 24
all 24
theoretic 24
and 24
consequently 24
not 24
apodeictic 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
known 24
necessity 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
object 24
but 24
a 24
necessary 24
supposition 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
subject 24
necessary 24
for 24
the 24
obedience 24
to 24
its 24
objective 24
but 24
practical 24
laws 24
it 24
is 24
therefore 24
merely 24
a 24
necessary 24
hypothesis 24
i 24
could 24
find 24
no 24
better 24
expression 24
for 24
this 24
rational 24
necessity 24
which 24
is 24
subjective 24
but 24
yet 24
true 24
and 24
unconditional 24
in 24
this 24
manner 24
then 24
the 24
a 24
priori 24
principles 24
of 24
two 24
faculties 24
of 24
the 24
mind 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
cognition 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
desire 24
would 24
be 24
found 24
and 24
determined 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
conditions 24
extent 24
and 24
limits 24
of 24
their 24
use 24
and 24
thus 24
a 24
sure 24
foundation 24
be 24
paid 24
for 24
a 24
scientific 24
system 24
of 24
philosophy 24
both 24
theoretic 24
and 24
practical 24
nothing 24
worse 24
could 24
happen 24
to 24
these 24
labours 24
than 24
that 24
anyone 24
should 24
make 24
the 24
unexpected 24
discovery 24
that 24
there 24
neither 24
is 24
nor 24
can 24
be 24
any 24
a 24
priori 24
knowledge 24
at 24
all 24
but 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
danger 24
of 24
this 24
this 24
would 24
be 24
the 24
same 24
thing 24
as 24
if 24
one 24
sought 24
to 24
prove 24
by 24
reason 24
that 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
reason 24
for 24
we 24
only 24
say 24
that 24
we 24
know 24
something 24
by 24
reason 24
when 24
we 24
are 24
conscious 24
that 24
we 24
could 24
have 24
known 24
it 24
even 24
if 24
it 24
had 24
not 24
been 24
given 24
to 24
us 24
in 24
experience 24
hence 24
rational 24
knowledge 24
and 24
knowledge 24
a 24
priori 24
are 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
clear 24
contradiction 24
to 24
try 24
to 24
extract 24
necessity 24
from 24
a 24
principle 24
of 24
experience 24
ex 24
pumice 24
aquam 24
and 24
to 24
try 24
by 24
this 24
to 24
give 24
a 24
judgement 24
true 24
universality 24
without 24
which 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
rational 24
inference 24
not 24
even 24
inference 24
from 24
analogy 24
which 24
is 24
at 24
least 24
a 24
presumed 24
universality 24
and 24
objective 24
necessity 24
to 24
substitute 24
subjective 24
necessity 24
that 24
is 24
custom 24
for 24
objective 24
which 24
exists 24
only 24
in 24
a 24
priori 24
judgements 24
is 24
to 24
deny 24
to 24
reason 24
the 24
power 24
of 24
judging 24
about 24
the 24
object 24
ie 24
of 24
knowing 24
it 24
and 24
what 24
belongs 24
to 24
it 24
it 24
implies 24
for 24
example 24
that 24
we 24
must 24
not 24
say 24
of 24
something 24
which 24
often 24
or 24
always 24
follows 24
a 24
certain 24
antecedent 24
state 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
conclude 24
from 24
this 24
to 24
that 24
for 24
this 24
would 24
imply 24
objective 24
necessity 24
and 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
an 24
a 24
priori 24
connexion 24
but 24
only 24
that 24
we 24
may 24
expect 24
similar 24
cases 24
just 24
as 24
animals 24
do 24
that 24
is 24
that 24
we 24
reject 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
altogether 24
as 24
false 24
and 24
a 24
mere 24
delusion 24
as 24
to 24
attempting 24
to 24
remedy 24
this 24
want 24
of 24
objective 24
and 24
consequently 24
universal 24
validity 24
by 24
saying 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
see 24
no 24
ground 24
for 24
attributing 24
any 24
other 24
sort 24
of 24
knowledge 24
to 24
other 24
rational 24
beings 24
if 24
this 24
reasoning 24
were 24
valid 24
our 24
ignorance 24
would 24
do 24
more 24
for 24
the 24
enlargement 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
than 24
all 24
our 24
meditation 24
for 24
then 24
on 24
this 24
very 24
ground 24
that 24
we 24
have 24
no 24
knowledge 24
of 24
any 24
other 24
rational 24
beings 24
besides 24
man 24
we 24
should 24
have 24
a 24
right 24
to 24
suppose 24
them 24
to 24
be 24
of 24

of 24
a 24
judgement 24

its 24

this 24
universal 24
assent 24

paragraph 24
hume 24
would 24
be 24
quite 24
satisfied 24
with 24
this 24
system 24
of 24
universal 24
empiricism 24
for 24
as 24
is 24
well 24
known 24
he 24
desired 24
nothing 24
more 24
than 24
that 24
instead 24
of 24
ascribing 24
any 24
objective 24
meaning 24
to 24
the 24
necessity 24
in 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
cause 24
a 24
merely 24
subjective 24
one 24
should 24
be 24
assumed 24
viz 24
custom 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
deny 24
that 24
reason 24
could 24
judge 24
about 24
god 24
freedom 24
and 24
immortality 24
and 24
if 24
once 24
his 24
principles 24
were 24
granted 24
he 24
was 24
certainly 24
well 24
able 24
to 24
deduce 24
his 24
conclusions 24
therefrom 24
with 24
all 24
logical 24
coherence 24
but 24
even 24
hume 24
did 24
not 24
make 24
his 24
empiricism 24
so 24
universal 24
as 24
to 24
include 24
mathematics 24
he 24
holds 24
the 24
principles 24
of 24
mathematics 24
to 24
be 24
analytical 24
and 24
if 24
his 24
were 24
correct 24
they 24
would 24
certainly 24
be 24
apodeictic 24
also 24
but 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
infer 24
from 24
this 24
that 24
reason 24
has 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
forming 24
apodeictic 24
judgements 24
in 24
philosophy 24
also 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
those 24
which 24
are 24
synthetical 24
judgements 24
like 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
causality 24
but 24
if 24
we 24
adopt 24
a 24
universal 24
empiricism 24
then 24
mathematics 24
will 24
be 24
included 24
now 24
if 24
this 24
science 24
is 24
in 24
contradiction 24
with 24
a 24
reason 24
that 24
admits 24
only 24
empirical 24
principles 24
as 24
it 24
inevitably 24
is 24
in 24
the 24
antinomy 24
in 24
which 24
mathematics 24
prove 24
the 24
infinite 24
divisibility 24
of 24
space 24
which 24
empiricism 24
cannot 24
admit 24
then 24
the 24
greatest 24
possible 24
evidence 24
of 24
demonstration 24
is 24
in 24
manifest 24
contradiction 24
with 24
the 24
alleged 24
conclusions 24
from 24
experience 24
and 24
we 24
are 24
driven 24
to 24
ask 24
like 24
cheseldens 24
blind 24
patient 24
which 24
deceives 24
me 24
sight 24
or 24
touch 24
for 24
empiricism 24
is 24
based 24
on 24
a 24
necessity 24
felt 24
rationalism 24
on 24
a 24
necessity 24
seen 24
and 24
thus 24
universal 24
empiricism 24
reveals 24
itself 24
as 24
absolute 24
scepticism 24
it 24
is 24
erroneous 24
to 24
attribute 24
this 24
in 24
such 24
an 24
unqualified 24
sense 24
to 24
hume 24
since 24
he 24
left 24
at 24
least 24
one 24
certain 24
touchstone 24
which 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
found 24
in 24
a 24
priori 24
principles 24
although 24
experience 24
consists 24
not 24
only 24
of 24
feelings 24
but 24
also 24
of 24
judgements 24
names 24
that 24
designate 24
the 24
followers 24
of 24
a 24
sect 24
have 24
always 24
been 24
accompanied 24
with 24
much 24
injustice 24
just 24
as 24
if 24
one 24
said 24
n 24
is 24
an 24
idealist 24
for 24
although 24
he 24
not 24
only 24
admits 24
but 24
even 24
insists 24
that 24
our 24
ideas 24
of 24
external 24
things 24
have 24
actual 24
objects 24
of 24
external 24
things 24
corresponding 24
to 24
them 24
yet 24
he 24
holds 24
that 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
the 24
intuition 24
does 24
not 24
depend 24
on 24

on 24

in 24
this 24
philosophical 24

age 24
such 24
empiricism 24
can 24
scarcely 24
be 24
serious 24

it 24
is 24
probably 24
put 24

only 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
faculty 24
of 24
cognition 24
because 24
this 24
raised 24
the 24
suspicion 24
which 24
was 24
afterwards 24
confirmed 24
that 24
it 24
might 24
easily 24
pass 24
beyond 24
its 24
limits 24
and 24
be 24
lost 24
among 24
unattainable 24
objects 24
or 24
even 24
contradictory 24
notions 24
it 24
is 24
quite 24
different 24
with 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
in 24
this 24
reason 24
is 24
concerned 24
with 24
the 24
grounds 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
is 24
a 24
faculty 24
either 24
to 24
produce 24
objects 24
corresponding 24
to 24
ideas 24
or 24
to 24
determine 24
ourselves 24
to 24
the 24
effecting 24
of 24
such 24
objects 24
whether 24
the 24
physical 24
power 24
is 24
sufficient 24
or 24
not 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
determine 24
our 24
causality 24
for 24
here 24
reason 24
can 24
at 24
least 24
attain 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
has 24
always 24
objective 24
reality 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
volition 24
only 24
that 24
is 24
in 24
question 24
the 24
first 24
question 24
here 24
then 24
is 24
whether 24
pure 24
reason 24
of 24
itself 24
alone 24
suffices 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
or 24
whether 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
a 24
ground 24
of 24
determination 24
only 24
as 24
dependent 24
on 24
empirical 24
conditions 24
now 24
here 24
there 24
comes 24
in 24
a 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
justified 24
by 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
reason 24
although 24
not 24
capable 24
of 24
being 24
presented 24
empirically 24
viz 24
that 24
of 24
freedom 24
and 24
if 24
we 24
can 24
now 24
discover 24
means 24
of 24
proving 24
that 24
this 24
property 24
does 24
in 24
fact 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
human 24
will 24
and 24
so 24
to 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
all 24
rational 24
beings 24
then 24
it 24
will 24
not 24
only 24
be 24
shown 24
that 24
pure 24
reason 24
can 24
be 24
practical 24
but 24
that 24
it 24
alone 24
and 24
not 24
reason 24
empirically 24
limited 24
is 24
indubitably 24
practical 24
consequently 24
we 24
shall 24
have 24
to 24
make 24
a 24
critical 24
examination 24
not 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
but 24
only 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
generally 24
for 24
when 24
once 24
pure 24
reason 24
is 24
shown 24
to 24
exist 24
it 24
needs 24
no 24
critical 24
examination 24
for 24
reason 24
itself 24
contains 24
the 24
standard 24
for 24
the 24
critical 24
examination 24
of 24
every 24
use 24
of 24
it 24
the 24
critique 24
then 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
generally 24
is 24
bound 24
to 24
prevent 24
the 24
empirically 24
conditioned 24
reason 24
from 24
claiming 24
exclusively 24
to 24
furnish 24
the 24
ground 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
if 24
it 24
is 24
proved 24
that 24
there 24
is 24
a 24

is 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
transcendent 24
and 24
expresses 24
itself 24
in 24

precepts 24
which 24
go 24
quite 24
beyond 24

the 24

one 24
is 24

in 24

has 24
to 24

with 24
the 24

in 24
the 24

the 24
practical 24
rule 24
is 24
always 24
a 24
product 24
of 24
reason 24
because 24
it 24
prescribes 24
action 24
as 24
a 24
means 24
to 24
the 24
effect 24

in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
with 24
whom 24
reason 24
does 24
not 24
of 24
itself 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
this 24
rule 24
is 24
an 24
imperative 24
ie 24
a 24
rule 24
characterized 24
by 24
shall 24
which 24
expresses 24
the 24
objective 24
necessitation 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
and 24
signifies 24
that 24
if 24
reason 24
completely 24
determined 24
the 24
will 24
the 24
action 24
would 24
inevitably 24
take 24
place 24
according 24
to 24
this 24
rule 24
imperatives 24
therefore 24
are 24
objectively 24
valid 24
and 24
are 24
quite 24
distinct 24
from 24
maxims 24
which 24
are 24
subjective 24
principles 24
the 24
former 24
either 24
determine 24
the 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
the 24
rational 24
being 24
as 24
an 24
efficient 24
cause 24
ie 24
merely 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
effect 24
and 24
the 24
means 24
of 24
attaining 24
it 24
or 24
they 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
only 24
whether 24
it 24
is 24
adequate 24
to 24
the 24
effect 24
or 24
not 24
the 24
former 24
would 24
be 24
hypothetical 24
imperatives 24
and 24
contain 24
mere 24
precepts 24
of 24
skill 24
the 24
latter 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
would 24
be 24
categorical 24
and 24
would 24
alone 24
be 24
practical 24
laws 24
thus 24
maxims 24
are 24
principles 24
but 24
not 24
imperatives 24
imperatives 24
themselves 24
however 24
when 24
they 24
are 24
conditional 24
ie 24
do 24
not 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
simply 24
as 24
will 24
but 24
only 24
in 24
respect 24
to 24
a 24
desired 24
effect 24
that 24
is 24
when 24
they 24
are 24
hypothetical 24
imperatives 24
are 24
practical 24
precepts 24
but 24
not 24
laws 24
laws 24
must 24
be 24
sufficient 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24

even 24
before 24

it 24

easy 24

that 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
directed 24
to 24
something 24
else 24
which 24
it 24

presupposed 24
that 24
it 24

as 24
to 24
this 24

we 24
must 24
leave 24
it 24
to 24
the 24
actor 24
himself 24

he 24
looks 24

this 24

this 24

then 24
it 24

a 24

it 24

the 24

the 24

man 24
may 24

repulse 24
a 24
poor 24
man 24
whom 24
he 24
at 24
other 24
times 24
takes 24
pleasure 24
in 24
benefiting 24
because 24
he 24
has 24
only 24
just 24
enough 24
money 24
in 24
his 24
pocket 24
to 24
pay 24
for 24
his 24
admission 24
to 24
the 24
theatre 24
if 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
his 24
will 24
rests 24
on 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
the 24
agreeableness 24
or 24
disagreeableness 24
that 24
he 24
expects 24
from 24
any 24
cause 24
it 24
is 24
all 24
the 24
same 24
to 24
him 24
by 24
what 24
sort 24
of 24
ideas 24
he 24
will 24
be 24
affected 24
the 24
only 24
thing 24
that 24
concerns 24
him 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
decide 24
his 24
choice 24
is 24
how 24
great 24
how 24
long 24
continued 24
how 24
easily 24
obtained 24
and 24
how 24
often 24
repeated 24
this 24
agreeableness 24
is 24
just 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
man 24
who 24
wants 24
money 24
to 24
spend 24
it 24
is 24
all 24
the 24
same 24
whether 24
the 24
gold 24
was 24
dug 24
out 24
of 24
the 24
mountain 24
or 24
washed 24
out 24
of 24
the 24
sand 24
provided 24
it 24
is 24
everywhere 24
accepted 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
value 24
so 24
the 24
man 24
who 24
cares 24
only 24
for 24
the 24
enjoyment 24
of 24
life 24
does 24
not 24
ask 24
whether 24
the 24
ideas 24
are 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
or 24
the 24
senses 24
but 24
only 24
how 24
much 24
and 24
how 24
great 24
pleasure 24
they 24
will 24
give 24
for 24
the 24
longest 24
time 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
those 24
that 24
would 24
gladly 24
deny 24
to 24
pure 24
reason 24
the 24
power 24
of 24
determining 24
the 24
will 24
without 24
the 24
presupposition 24
of 24
any 24
feeling 24
who 24
could 24
deviate 24
so 24
far 24
from 24
their 24
own 24
exposition 24
as 24
to 24
describe 24
as 24
quite 24
heterogeneous 24
what 24
they 24
have 24
themselves 24
previously 24
brought 24
under 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
principle 24
thus 24
for 24
example 24
it 24
is 24
observed 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
find 24
pleasure 24
in 24
the 24
mere 24
exercise 24
of 24
power 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
our 24
strength 24
of 24
mind 24
in 24
overcoming 24
obstacles 24
which 24
are 24
opposed 24
to 24
our 24
designs 24
in 24
the 24
culture 24
of 24
our 24
mental 24
talents 24
etc 24
and 24
we 24
justly 24
call 24
these 24
more 24
refined 24
pleasures 24
and 24
enjoyments 24
because 24
they 24
are 24
more 24
in 24
our 24
power 24
than 24
others 24
they 24
do 24
not 24
wear 24
out 24
but 24
rather 24
increase 24
the 24
capacity 24
for 24
further 24
enjoyment 24
of 24
them 24
and 24
while 24
they 24
delight 24
they 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
cultivate 24
but 24
to 24
say 24
on 24
this 24
account 24
that 24
they 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
a 24
different 24
way 24
and 24
not 24
through 24
sense 24
whereas 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
pleasure 24
presupposes 24
a 24
feeling 24
for 24
it 24
implanted 24
in 24
us 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
first 24
condition 24
of 24
this 24
satisfaction 24
this 24
is 24
just 24
as 24
when 24
ignorant 24
persons 24
that 24
like 24
to 24
dabble 24
in 24
metaphysics 24
imagine 24
matter 24
so 24
subtle 24
so 24
supersubtle 24
that 24
they 24
almost 24
make 24
themselves 24
giddy 24
with 24
it 24
and 24
then 24
think 24
that 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
they 24
have 24
conceived 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
spiritual 24
and 24
yet 24
extended 24
being 24
if 24
with 24
epicurus 24
we 24
make 24
virtue 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
only 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
pleasure 24
it 24
promises 24
we 24
cannot 24
afterwards 24
blame 24
him 24
for 24
holding 24
that 24
this 24
pleasure 24
is 24
of 24
the 24
same 24
kind 24
as 24
those 24
of 24
the 24
coarsest 24
senses 24
for 24
we 24
have 24
no 24
reason 24
whatever 24
to 24
charge 24
him 24
with 24
holding 24
that 24
the 24
ideas 24
by 24
which 24
this 24
feeling 24
is 24
excited 24
in 24
us 24
belong 24
merely 24
to 24
the 24
bodily 24
senses 24
as 24
far 24
as 24
can 24
be 24
conjectured 24
he 24
sought 24
the 24
source 24
of 24
many 24
of 24
them 24
in 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
higher 24
cognitive 24
faculty 24
but 24
this 24
did 24
not 24
prevent 24
him 24
and 24
could 24
not 24
prevent 24
him 24
from 24
holding 24
on 24
the 24
principle 24
above 24
stated 24
that 24
the 24
pleasure 24
itself 24
which 24
those 24
intellectual 24
ideas 24
give 24
us 24
and 24
by 24
which 24
alone 24
they 24
can 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
just 24
of 24
the 24
same 24
kind 24
consistency 24
is 24
the 24
highest 24
obligation 24
of 24
a 24
philosopher 24
and 24
yet 24
the 24
most 24
rarely 24
found 24
the 24
ancient 24
greek 24
schools 24
give 24
us 24
more 24
examples 24
of 24
it 24
than 24
we 24
find 24
in 24
our 24
syncretistic 24
age 24
in 24
which 24
a 24
certain 24
shallow 24
and 24
dishonest 24
system 24
of 24
compromise 24
of 24
contradictory 24
principles 24
is 24
devised 24
because 24
it 24
commends 24
itself 24
better 24
to 24
a 24
public 24
which 24
is 24
content 24
to 24
know 24
something 24
of 24
everything 24
and 24
nothing 24
thoroughly 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
please 24
every 24
party 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
however 24
much 24
understanding 24
and 24
reason 24
may 24
be 24
used 24
in 24
it 24
cannot 24
contain 24
any 24
other 24
determining 24
principles 24
for 24
the 24
will 24
than 24
those 24
which 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
lower 24
desires 24
and 24
either 24
there 24
are 24
no 24
higher 24
desires 24
at 24
all 24
or 24
pure 24
reason 24
must 24
of 24
itself 24
alone 24
be 24
practical 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
must 24
be 24
able 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
by 24
the 24
mere 24
form 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
rule 24
without 24
supposing 24
any 24
feeling 24
and 24
consequently 24
without 24
any 24
idea 24
of 24
the 24
pleasant 24
or 24
unpleasant 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
the 24
desire 24
and 24
which 24
is 24
always 24
an 24
empirical 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
principles 24
then 24
only 24
when 24
reason 24
of 24
itself 24
determines 24
the 24
will 24
not 24
as 24
the 24
servant 24
of 24
the 24
inclination 24
it 24
is 24
really 24
a 24
higher 24
desire 24
to 24
which 24
that 24
which 24
is 24
pathologically 24
determined 24
is 24
subordinate 24
and 24
is 24
really 24
and 24
even 24
specifically 24
distinct 24
from 24
the 24
latter 24
so 24
that 24
even 24
the 24
slightest 24
admixture 24
of 24
the 24
motives 24
of 24
the 24
latter 24
impairs 24
its 24
strength 24
and 24
superiority 24
just 24
as 24
in 24
a 24
mathematical 24
demonstration 24
the 24
least 24
empirical 24
condition 24
would 24
degrade 24
and 24
destroy 24
its 24
force 24
and 24
value 24
reason 24
with 24
its 24
practical 24
law 24
determines 24
the 24
will 24
immediately 24
not 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
an 24
intervening 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
not 24
even 24
of 24
pleasure 24
in 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
and 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
because 24
it 24
can 24
as 24
pure 24
reason 24
be 24
practical 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
possible 24

legislative 24
remark 24
ii 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
to 24
be 24
happy 24
is 24
necessarily 24
the 24
wish 24
of 24
every 24
finite 24
rational 24
being 24
and 24
this 24
therefore 24
is 24
inevitably 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
its 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
for 24
we 24
are 24
not 24
in 24
possession 24
originally 24
of 24
satisfaction 24
with 24
our 24
whole 24
existence 24
a 24
bliss 24
which 24
would 24
imply 24
a 24
consciousness 24
of 24
our 24
own 24
independent 24
selfsufficiency 24
this 24
is 24
a 24
problem 24
imposed 24
upon 24
us 24
by 24
our 24
own 24
finite 24
nature 24
because 24
we 24
have 24
wants 24
and 24
these 24
wants 24
regard 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
our 24
desires 24
that 24
is 24
something 24
that 24
is 24
relative 24
to 24
a 24
subjective 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
which 24
determines 24
what 24
we 24
need 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
be 24
satisfied 24
with 24
our 24
condition 24
but 24
just 24
because 24
this 24
material 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
empirically 24
known 24
by 24
the 24
subject 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
to 24
regard 24
this 24
problem 24
as 24
a 24
law 24
for 24
a 24
law 24
being 24
objective 24
must 24
contain 24
the 24
very 24
same 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
all 24
cases 24
and 24
for 24
all 24
rational 24
beings 24
for 24
although 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
happiness 24
is 24
in 24
every 24
case 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
practical 24
relation 24
of 24
the 24
objects 24
to 24
the 24
desires 24
yet 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
a 24
general 24
name 24
for 24
the 24
subjective 24
determining 24
principles 24
and 24
determines 24
nothing 24
specifically 24
whereas 24
this 24
is 24
what 24
alone 24
we 24
are 24
concerned 24
with 24
in 24
this 24
practical 24
problem 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
solved 24
at 24
all 24
without 24
such 24
specific 24
determination 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
every 24
mans 24
own 24
special 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
and 24
pain 24
that 24
decides 24
in 24
what 24
he 24
is 24
to 24
place 24
his 24
happiness 24
and 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
same 24
subject 24
this 24
will 24
vary 24
with 24
the 24
difference 24
of 24
his 24
wants 24
according 24
as 24
this 24
feeling 24
changes 24
and 24
thus 24
a 24
law 24
which 24
is 24
subjectively 24

all 24

would 24
be 24
known 24

from 24
objective 24

on 24
subjective 24
conditions 24
of 24
choice 24
and 24
hence 24
that 24
they 24
must 24
always 24
be 24
represented 24

mere 24

never 24

also 24
bold 24
good 24
as 24

apply 24
it 24
therefore 24
to 24
the 24
present 24
case 24

ask 24
whether 24
it 24
could 24
take 24
the 24

whether 24
i 24
can 24
by 24
my 24

at 24
the 24

give 24

can 24
produce 24

proof 24
i 24
at 24
once 24
become 24
aware 24
that 24
such 24
a 24
principle 24
viewed 24
as 24
a 24
law 24
would 24
annihilate 24
itself 24
because 24
the 24
result 24
would 24
be 24
that 24
there 24
would 24
be 24
no 24
deposits 24
a 24
practical 24
law 24
which 24
i 24
recognise 24
as 24
such 24
must 24
be 24
qualified 24
for 24
universal 24
legislation 24
this 24
is 24
an 24
identical 24
proposition 24
and 24
therefore 24
selfevident 24
now 24
if 24
i 24
say 24
that 24
my 24
will 24
is 24
subject 24
to 24
a 24
practical 24

cannot 24

in 24

fitted 24
to 24
be 24
a 24
universal 24
practical 24

for 24
this 24
is 24
so 24
far 24
from 24
being 24
fitted 24
for 24
a 24
universal 24
legislation 24
that 24
if 24
put 24
in 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
a 24
universal 24
law 24
it 24
would 24
destroy 24
itself 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
it 24
is 24
therefore 24
surprising 24
that 24
intelligent 24
men 24
could 24
have 24
thought 24
of 24
calling 24
the 24
desire 24
of 24
happiness 24
a 24
universal 24
practical 24
law 24
on 24
the 24
ground 24
that 24
the 24
desire 24
is 24
universal 24
and 24
therefore 24
also 24
the 24
maxim 24
by 24
which 24
everyone 24
makes 24
this 24
desire 24
determine 24
his 24
will 24
for 24
whereas 24
in 24
other 24
cases 24
a 24
universal 24
law 24
of 24
nature 24
makes 24
everything 24
harmonious 24
here 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
if 24
we 24
attribute 24
to 24
the 24
maxim 24
the 24
universality 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
the 24
extreme 24
opposite 24
of 24
harmony 24
will 24
follow 24
the 24
greatest 24
opposition 24
and 24
the 24
complete 24
destruction 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
itself 24
and 24
its 24
purpose 24
for 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
all 24
has 24
not 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
object 24
but 24
everyone 24
has 24
his 24
own 24
his 24
private 24
welfare 24
which 24
may 24
accidentally 24
accord 24
with 24
the 24
purposes 24
of 24
others 24
which 24
are 24
equally 24
selfish 24
but 24
it 24
is 24
far 24
from 24
sufficing 24
for 24
a 24
law 24
because 24
the 24
occasional 24
exceptions 24
which 24
one 24
is 24
permitted 24
to 24
make 24
are 24
endless 24
and 24
cannot 24
be 24
definitely 24
embraced 24
in 24
one 24
universal 24
rule 24
in 24
this 24
manner 24
then 24
results 24
a 24
harmony 24
like 24
that 24
which 24
a 24

the 24
consciousness 24

we 24

as 24
we 24

that 24
it 24

to 24
us 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24

that 24
it 24

practical 24
reason 24

with 24
this 24
concept 24
first 24
proposes 24
to 24
speculative 24
reason 24
the 24
most 24
insoluble 24
problem 24
thereby 24
placing 24
it 24
in 24
the 24
greatest 24
perplexity 24
is 24
evident 24
from 24
the 24
following 24
consideration 24
since 24
nothing 24
in 24
phenomena 24
can 24
be 24
explained 24
by 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
but 24
the 24
mechanism 24
of 24
nature 24
must 24
constitute 24
the 24
only 24
clue 24
moreover 24
when 24
pure 24
reason 24
tries 24
to 24
ascend 24
in 24
the 24
series 24
of 24
causes 24
to 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
it 24
falls 24
into 24
an 24
antinomy 24
which 24
is 24
entangled 24
in 24
incomprehensibilities 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
side 24
as 24
much 24
as 24
the 24
other 24
whilst 24
the 24
latter 24
namely 24
mechanism 24
is 24
at 24
least 24
useful 24
in 24
the 24
explanation 24
of 24
phenomena 24
therefore 24
no 24
one 24
would 24
ever 24
have 24
been 24
so 24
rash 24
as 24
to 24
introduce 24
freedom 24
into 24

the 24

is 24
strange 24
enough 24

has 24
no 24

all 24
the 24

of 24
our 24

thought 24
of 24
a 24
possible 24

which 24

merely 24
problematical 24
is 24
unconditionally 24
commanded 24
as 24
a 24

without 24

anything 24
from 24
experience 24
or 24
from 24
any 24
external 24

something 24
by 24
which 24
some 24
desired 24
effect 24
can 24
be 24
attained 24
for 24
then 24
the 24

would 24
depend 24
on 24
physical 24

a 24

as 24
regards 24
the 24

thus 24
it 24
is 24
at 24
least 24
not 24
impossible 24
to 24
conceive 24
that 24
a 24
law 24

only 24
applies 24
to 24
the 24
subjective 24
form 24

yet 24
serves 24
as 24
a 24
principle 24

by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
objective 24
form 24
of 24

in 24

we 24
may 24
call 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
this 24
fundamental 24
law 24
a 24
fact 24
of 24
reason 24

we 24
cannot 24
reason 24
it 24
out 24
from 24
antecedent 24

the 24

for 24
this 24

not 24
antecedently 24
given 24
but 24
it 24
forces 24
itself 24
on 24
us 24
as 24
a 24
synthetic 24
a 24
priori 24
proposition 24
which 24
is 24
not 24
based 24
on 24
any 24
intuition 24
either 24
pure 24
or 24
empirical 24
it 24

indeed 24

if 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
the 24

were 24
presupposed 24

to 24
presuppose 24
freedom 24
as 24
a 24
positive 24
concept 24
would 24
require 24
an 24
intellectual 24
intuition 24
which 24
cannot 24
here 24
be 24
assumed 24
however 24
when 24
we 24
regard 24
this 24
law 24
as 24
given 24
it 24
must 24
be 24
observed 24
in 24
order 24
not 24
to 24
fall 24
into 24
any 24
misconception 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
an 24

the 24
sole 24

the 24

has 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
an 24
imperative 24
because 24
in 24
them 24
as 24
rational 24
beings 24
we 24
can 24
suppose 24
a 24
pure 24
will 24
but 24
being 24
creatures 24
affected 24
with 24
wants 24
and 24
physical 24
motives 24
not 24
a 24
holy 24
will 24
that 24
is 24
one 24

the 24
relation 24

which 24
implies 24
a 24
constraint 24
to 24
an 24
action 24
though 24
only 24
by 24
reason 24
and 24
its 24
objective 24
law 24
and 24
this 24
action 24
is 24
called 24
duty 24
because 24
an 24
elective 24
will 24
subject 24
to 24
pathological 24
affections 24
though 24
not 24
determined 24
by 24
them 24
and 24
therefore 24
still 24
free 24
implies 24
a 24
wish 24
that 24
arises 24
from 24
subjective 24
causes 24
and 24
therefore 24
may 24
often 24
be 24
opposed 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
objective 24
determining 24
principle 24
whence 24
it 24
requires 24
the 24
moral 24
constraint 24
of 24
a 24
resistance 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24

may 24
be 24
called 24

rightly 24
conceived 24

any 24
maxim 24
which 24
could 24
not 24
at 24
the 24

time 24
be 24
objectively 24
a 24

on 24

not 24

all 24
practical 24
laws 24

above 24

restrictive 24
laws 24

consequently 24
above 24
obligation 24

this 24
holiness 24
of 24
will 24
is 24
however 24
a 24
practical 24
idea 24
which 24
must 24
necessarily 24
serve 24
as 24
a 24
type 24
to 24
which 24
finite 24
rational 24

can 24
only 24
approximate 24
indefinitely 24

as 24
the 24
necessity 24
involved 24
in 24
the 24
law 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
physical 24
necessity 24
it 24
can 24
only 24
consist 24
in 24
the 24
formal 24

law 24
in 24
general 24
all 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
practical 24

rests 24
on 24
subjective 24
conditions 24

them 24
only 24
a 24
conditional 24
universality 24

they 24
all 24
turn 24
on 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
now 24
it 24
is 24
indeed 24
undeniable 24
that 24
every 24
volition 24
must 24
have 24
an 24
object 24
and 24
therefore 24
a 24
matter 24
but 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
follow 24
that 24
this 24
is 24
the 24

the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
for 24

it 24
is 24
so 24
then 24
this 24
cannot 24
be 24
exhibited 24
in 24
a 24
universally 24
legislative 24
form 24
since 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
the 24
expectation 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
would 24
be 24
the 24
determining 24
cause 24
of 24
the 24
choice 24
and 24
the 24
volition 24
must 24
presuppose 24
the 24
dependence 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
on 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
something 24
but 24
this 24
dependence 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
sought 24
in 24
empirical 24
conditions 24
and 24
therefore 24
can 24
never 24
furnish 24
a 24
foundation 24
for 24
a 24
necessary 24
and 24
universal 24
rule 24
thus 24
the 24
happiness 24
of 24
others 24
may 24
be 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
the 24

of 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24

if 24
it 24
were 24
the 24
determining 24

not 24
only 24
a 24
rational 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
the 24
welfare 24
of 24
others 24

also 24
a 24

such 24
as 24
the 24
sympathetic 24
disposition 24
in 24
some 24
men 24
occasions 24
but 24
i 24
cannot 24
assume 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
this 24

in 24
every 24
rational 24

not 24
at 24
all 24
in 24
god 24
the 24

then 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
may 24
remain 24
but 24
it 24
must 24
not 24
be 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
it 24
else 24
the 24
maxim 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
fit 24
for 24
a 24

hence 24
the 24
mere 24
form 24
of 24
law 24
which 24
limits 24
the 24

also 24

it 24
for 24
example 24
let 24
the 24
matter 24
be 24
my 24

this 24
rule 24
if 24
i 24
attribute 24
it 24
to 24
everyone 24

in 24

i 24
may 24
in 24
the 24

every 24

only 24
if 24
i 24
include 24
the 24

therefore 24
the 24
law 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
promote 24
the 24

the 24
direct 24

the 24

when 24

false 24

the 24

thereby 24
pointing 24
out 24
the 24

felt 24
and 24
therefore 24
it 24
refers 24
to 24
experience 24
and 24
is 24
founded 24
on 24
it 24
and 24
then 24
the 24
variety 24
of 24
judgement 24
must 24
be 24
endless 24
this 24
principle 24
therefore 24
does 24
not 24
prescribe 24
the 24
same 24
practical 24
rules 24
to 24
all 24
rational 24
beings 24
although 24
the 24
rules 24
are 24
all 24
included 24
under 24
a 24
common 24
title 24
namely 24
that 24
of 24
happiness 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
however 24
is 24
conceived 24
as 24
objectively 24
necessary 24
only 24
because 24
it 24
holds 24
for 24
everyone 24
that 24

of 24
morality 24

there 24
is 24
a 24
great 24
difference 24
between 24
that 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
advised 24
to 24
do 24
and 24
that 24
to 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
obliged 24
the 24
commonest 24
intelligence 24
can 24
easily 24
and 24
without 24
hesitation 24
see 24
what 24
on 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
autonomy 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
requires 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
but 24
on 24
supposition 24
of 24
heteronomy 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
it 24
is 24
hard 24
and 24
requires 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
to 24
see 24
what 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
what 24
duty 24
is 24
is 24
plain 24
of 24
itself 24
to 24
everyone 24
but 24
what 24
is 24
to 24
bring 24
true 24
durable 24
advantage 24
such 24
as 24
will 24
extend 24
to 24
the 24
whole 24
of 24
ones 24
existence 24
is 24
always 24
veiled 24
in 24
impenetrable 24
obscurity 24
and 24
much 24
prudence 24
is 24
required 24
to 24
adapt 24
the 24
practical 24
rule 24
founded 24
on 24
it 24
to 24
the 24
ends 24
of 24
life 24
even 24
tolerably 24
by 24
making 24
proper 24
exceptions 24
but 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
commands 24
the 24
most 24
punctual 24
obedience 24
from 24
everyone 24
it 24
must 24
therefore 24
not 24
be 24
so 24
difficult 24
to 24
judge 24
what 24
it 24
requires 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
that 24
the 24
commonest 24
unpractised 24
understanding 24
even 24
without 24
worldly 24
prudence 24
should 24
fail 24
to 24
apply 24
it 24
rightly 24
it 24

always 24
in 24
everyones 24
power 24
to 24
satisfy 24
the 24
categorical 24
command 24
of 24
morality 24
whereas 24
it 24
is 24
seldom 24
possible 24
and 24
by 24
no 24
means 24
so 24
to 24
everyone 24
to 24
satisfy 24
the 24
empirically 24
conditioned 24
precept 24
of 24
happiness 24
even 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
a 24
single 24
purpose 24
the 24
reason 24
is 24
that 24
in 24
the 24
former 24
case 24
there 24
is 24
question 24
only 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
genuine 24
and 24
pure 24
but 24
in 24
the 24
latter 24

physical 24
power 24
to 24
realize 24
a 24
desired 24

command 24
that 24
everyone 24
should 24
try 24
to 24
make 24
himself 24
happy 24
would 24
be 24
foolish 24
for 24
one 24
never 24
commands 24
anyone 24
to 24
do 24
what 24
he 24
of 24
himself 24
infallibly 24
wishes 24
to 24
do 24
we 24
must 24
only 24
command 24
the 24
means 24
or 24
rather 24
supply 24
them 24
since 24
he 24
cannot 24
do 24
everything 24
that 24
he 24
wishes 24
but 24
to 24
command 24
morality 24
under 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
duty 24
is 24
quite 24
rational 24
for 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
place 24
not 24
everyone 24
is 24
willing 24
to 24
obey 24
its 24
precepts 24
if 24
they 24
oppose 24
his 24
inclinations 24
and 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
means 24
of 24
obeying 24
this 24
law 24
these 24
need 24
not 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
be 24
taught 24
for 24

this 24
respect 24
whatever 24
he 24
wishes 24
to 24
do 24
be 24

do 24
he 24
who 24
has 24
lost 24
at 24
play 24
may 24
be 24
vexed 24
at 24
himself 24
and 24
his 24
folly 24
but 24
if 24
he 24
is 24
conscious 24
of 24
having 24
cheated 24
at 24
play 24
although 24
he 24
has 24
gained 24
thereby 24
he 24
must 24
despise 24
himself 24
as 24
soon 24
as 24
he 24
compares 24
himself 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
this 24
must 24
therefore 24
be 24
something 24
different 24
from 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
for 24
a 24
man 24
must 24
have 24
a 24
different 24
criterion 24
when 24
he 24
is 24
compelled 24
to 24
say 24
to 24
himself 24
i 24
am 24
a 24
worthless 24
fellow 24
though 24
i 24
have 24
filled 24
my 24
purse 24
and 24
when 24
he 24
approves 24
himself 24
and 24
says 24
i 24
am 24
a 24
prudent 24

bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
finally 24
there 24
is 24
something 24
further 24
in 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
our 24
practical 24
reason 24
which 24
accompanies 24
the 24
transgression 24
of 24
a 24
moral 24
law 24
namely 24
its 24
ill 24
desert 24
now 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
punishment 24
as 24
such 24
cannot 24
be 24
united 24
with 24
that 24
of 24
becoming 24
a 24
partaker 24
of 24
happiness 24
for 24
although 24
he 24
who 24
inflicts 24
the 24
punishment 24
may 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
have 24
the 24
benevolent 24
purpose 24
of 24
directing 24
this 24
punishment 24
to 24
this 24
end 24
yet 24
it 24
must 24
first 24
be 24
justified 24
in 24
itself 24
as 24
punishment 24
ie 24
as 24
mere 24
harm 24
so 24
that 24
if 24
it 24
stopped 24
there 24
and 24
the 24
person 24
punished 24
could 24
get 24
no 24
glimpse 24
of 24
kindness 24
hidden 24
behind 24
this 24
harshness 24
he 24
must 24
yet 24
admit 24
that 24
justice 24
was 24
done 24
him 24
and 24
that 24
his 24
reward 24
was 24
perfectly 24
suitable 24
to 24
his 24
conduct 24
in 24
every 24
punishment 24
as 24
such 24
there 24
must 24
first 24
be 24
justice 24
and 24
this 24
constitutes 24
the 24
essence 24
of 24
the 24
notion 24
benevolence 24
may 24
indeed 24
be 24
united 24
with 24
it 24
but 24
the 24
man 24
who 24
has 24
deserved 24
punishment 24
has 24
not 24
the 24
least 24
reason 24
to 24
reckon 24
upon 24
this 24
punishment 24
then 24
is 24
a 24
physical 24
evil 24
which 24
though 24
it 24
be 24
not 24
connected 24
with 24
moral 24
evil 24
as 24
a 24
natural 24
consequence 24
ought 24
to 24
be 24
connected 24
with 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
consequence 24
by 24
the 24
principles 24
of 24
a 24
moral 24
legislation 24
now 24
if 24
every 24
crime 24
even 24
without 24
regarding 24
the 24
physical 24
consequence 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
actor 24
is 24
in 24
itself 24
punishable 24
that 24
is 24
forfeits 24
happiness 24
at 24
least 24
partially 24
it 24
is 24
obviously 24
absurd 24
to 24
say 24
that 24
the 24
crime 24
consisted 24
just 24
in 24
this 24
that 24
be 24
has 24
drawn 24
punishment 24
on 24
himself 24
thereby 24
injuring 24
his 24
private 24
happiness 24
which 24
on 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
selflove 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
proper 24
notion 24
of 24
all 24
crime 24
according 24
to 24
this 24
view 24
the 24
punishment 24
would 24
be 24
the 24
reason 24
for 24
calling 24
anything 24
a 24
crime 24
and 24
justice 24
would 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
consist 24
in 24
omitting 24
all 24
punishment 24
and 24
even 24
preventing 24
that 24
which 24
naturally 24
follows 24
for 24
if 24
this 24
were 24
done 24
there 24
would 24
no 24
longer 24
be 24
any 24
evil 24
in 24
the 24
action 24
since 24
the 24
harm 24
which 24
otherwise 24
followed 24
it 24
and 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
which 24
alone 24
the 24
action 24
was 24
called 24
evil 24
would 24
now 24
be 24
prevented 24
to 24
look 24
however 24
on 24
all 24
rewards 24
and 24
punishments 24
as 24
merely 24
the 24
machinery 24
in 24
the 24
hand 24
of 24
a 24
higher 24
power 24
which 24
is 24
to 24
serve 24
only 24
to 24
set 24
rational 24
creatures 24
striving 24
after 24
their 24
final 24
end 24
happiness 24
this 24
is 24
to 24
reduce 24
the 24
will 24
to 24
a 24
mechanism 24
destructive 24
of 24
freedom 24
this 24
is 24
so 24
evident 24
that 24
it 24
need 24
not 24
detain 24
us 24
more 24
refined 24
though 24
equally 24
false 24
is 24
the 24
theory 24
of 24
those 24
who 24
suppose 24
a 24
certain 24
special 24
moral 24
sense 24
which 24
sense 24
and 24
not 24
reason 24
determines 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
in 24
consequence 24
of 24
which 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
virtue 24
is 24
supposed 24
to 24
be 24
directly 24
connected 24
with 24
contentment 24
and 24
pleasure 24
that 24
of 24
vice 24
with 24
mental 24
dissatisfaction 24
and 24
pain 24
thus 24
reducing 24
the 24
whole 24
to 24
the 24
desire 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
without 24
repeating 24
what 24
has 24
been 24
said 24
above 24
i 24
will 24
here 24
only 24
remark 24
the 24
fallacy 24
they 24
fall 24
into 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
imagine 24
the 24
vicious 24
man 24
as 24
tormented 24
with 24
mental 24
dissatisfaction 24
by 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
his 24
transgressions 24
they 24
must 24
first 24
represent 24
him 24
as 24
in 24
the 24
main 24
basis 24
of 24
his 24
character 24
at 24
least 24
in 24
some 24
degree 24
morally 24
good 24
just 24
as 24
he 24
who 24
is 24
pleased 24
with 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
right 24
conduct 24
must 24
be 24
conceived 24
as 24
already 24
virtuous 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
duty 24
must 24
therefore 24
have 24
preceded 24
any 24
regard 24
to 24
this 24
satisfaction 24
and 24
cannot 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
it 24
a 24
man 24
must 24
first 24
appreciate 24
the 24
importance 24
of 24
what 24
we 24
call 24
duty 24
the 24
authority 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
the 24
immediate 24
dignity 24
which 24
the 24
following 24
of 24
it 24
gives 24
to 24
the 24
person 24
in 24
his 24
own 24
eyes 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
feel 24
that 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
his 24
conformity 24
to 24
it 24
and 24
the 24
bitter 24
remorse 24
that 24
accompanies 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
its 24
transgression 24
it 24
is 24
therefore 24
impossible 24
to 24
feel 24
this 24
satisfaction 24
or 24
dissatisfaction 24
prior 24
to 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
obligation 24
or 24
to 24
make 24
it 24
the 24
basis 24
of 24
the 24

the 24

whether 24

be 24
the 24

an 24
end 24

an 24

the 24
ground 24

of 24
this 24
determination 24
and 24
therefore 24
contain 24
also 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
taken 24
as 24
its 24
determining 24
principle 24
such 24
an 24
end 24
is 24
always 24
empirical 24
and 24
therefore 24
may 24
serve 24
for 24
the 24
epicurean 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24

theory 24
but 24
not 24
for 24
the 24
pure 24
rational 24
principle 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
duty 24
thus 24
talents 24
and 24
the 24
improvement 24
of 24
them 24
because 24
they 24
contribute 24
to 24
the 24
advantages 24
of 24
life 24
or 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
god 24
if 24
agreement 24
with 24
it 24
be 24
taken 24

any 24
antecedent 24

only 24
by 24
reason 24
of 24
the 24

therefrom 24
hence 24
it 24
follows 24
first 24
that 24
all 24
the 24
principles 24
here 24
stated 24
are 24
material 24
secondly 24
that 24
they 24
include 24
all 24
possible 24
material 24
principles 24
and 24
finally 24
the 24
conclusion 24
that 24
since 24
material 24
principles 24
are 24
quite 24
incapable 24
of 24

to 24
which 24
the 24
mere 24
form 24
of 24
a 24
universal 24

must 24
constitute 24
the 24
supreme 24

immediate 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
one 24
possible 24
which 24
is 24
adequate 24
to 24
furnish 24
categorical 24
imperatives 24
that 24
is 24
practical 24

which 24
make 24

this 24
it 24

by 24
a 24
fact 24
in 24
which 24
pure 24

in 24
us 24
proves 24
itself 24
actually 24
practical 24
namely 24
the 24

at 24
the 24

that 24
this 24

is 24
inseparably 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24

as 24
belonging 24

at 24

of 24
itself 24
but 24
by 24
virtue 24
of 24
certain 24
dynamical 24
laws 24
which 24
determine 24
its 24
causality 24
in 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
for 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
elsewhere 24
proved 24
that 24
if 24
freedom 24
is 24
predicated 24
of 24
us 24
it 24
transports 24
us 24
into 24
an 24
intelligible 24
order 24
of 24
things 24
now 24
if 24
we 24
compare 24
with 24
this 24
the 24
analytical 24
part 24
of 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
pure 24
speculative 24
reason 24
we 24
shall 24
see 24
a 24
remarkable 24
contrast 24
there 24
it 24
was 24
not 24
fundamental 24
principles 24
but 24
pure 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
space 24
and 24
time 24
that 24
was 24
the 24
first 24
datum 24
that 24
made 24
a 24
priori 24
knowledge 24
possible 24
though 24
only 24
of 24
objects 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
synthetical 24
principles 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
mere 24
concepts 24
without 24
intuition 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
they 24
could 24
only 24
exist 24
with 24
reference 24
to 24
this 24
intuition 24
and 24
therefore 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
possible 24
experience 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
concepts 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
united 24
with 24
this 24
intuition 24
which 24
alone 24
make 24
that 24
knowledge 24
possible 24
which 24
we 24
call 24
experience 24
beyond 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
and 24
therefore 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
things 24
as 24
noumena 24
all 24
positive 24
knowledge 24
was 24
rightly 24
disclaimed 24
for 24
speculative 24
reason 24
this 24
reason 24
however 24
went 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
to 24
establish 24
with 24
certainty 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
noumena 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
possibility 24
nay 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
thinking 24
them 24
for 24
example 24
it 24
showed 24
against 24
all 24
objections 24
that 24
the 24
supposition 24
of 24
freedom 24
negatively 24
considered 24
was 24
quite 24
consistent 24
with 24
those 24
principles 24
and 24
limitations 24
of 24
pure 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
but 24
it 24
could 24
not 24
give 24
us 24
any 24
definite 24
enlargement 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
such 24
objects 24

on 24
the 24
contrary 24
cut 24
off 24
all 24

them 24
altogether 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
although 24
it 24
gives 24
no 24
view 24
yet 24
gives 24
us 24
a 24

the 24

their 24

from 24
the 24

therefore 24
belong 24
to 24

the 24
least 24
attention 24

that 24
this 24

really 24
serves 24
as 24
the 24
model 24
for 24
the 24
determinations 24
of 24
our 24

when 24

tested 24
by 24
the 24

always 24
consider 24
what 24
it 24

be 24
if 24
it 24
were 24
to 24
hold 24
as 24
a 24
universal 24
law 24
of 24
nature 24
it 24
is 24
manifest 24
that 24
in 24
this 24
view 24
it 24
would 24
oblige 24
everyone 24
to 24
speak 24
the 24

it 24
cannot 24
hold 24
as 24
a 24
universal 24

that 24
statements 24

be 24
allowed 24

have 24
the 24
force 24
of 24
proof 24
and 24
yet 24
to 24
be 24
purposely 24
untrue 24

i 24

i 24
ask 24
myself 24
what 24
it 24
should 24
be 24
in 24
order 24
that 24
a 24
system 24
of 24
which 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
law 24
should 24
maintain 24
itself 24
it 24
is 24
obvious 24
that 24
in 24
such 24
a 24
system 24
no 24
one 24
could 24
arbitrarily 24
put 24
an 24
end 24
to 24
his 24
own 24
life 24
for 24
such 24
an 24
arrangement 24

not 24
be 24
a 24
permanent 24
order 24

so 24
in 24
all 24
similar 24
cases 24
now 24
in 24
nature 24
as 24
it 24
actually 24

an 24

the 24
free 24

is 24
not 24
of 24
itself 24
determined 24
to 24
maxims 24
which 24
could 24
of 24
themselves 24
be 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
a 24
natural 24
system 24
of 24
universal 24
laws 24
or 24
which 24
could 24
even 24
be 24
adapted 24
to 24
a 24
system 24
so 24
constituted 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
its 24
maxims 24
are 24
private 24
inclinations 24
which 24
constitute 24
indeed 24
a 24
natural 24
whole 24
in 24
conformity 24
with 24
pathological 24
physical 24
laws 24
but 24
could 24
not 24
form 24
part 24
of 24
a 24
system 24
of 24
nature 24
which 24
would 24
only 24
be 24
possible 24
through 24
our 24
will 24
acting 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
pure 24
practical 24
laws 24
yet 24
we 24
are 24
through 24
reason 24
conscious 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
to 24
which 24
all 24
our 24
maxims 24
are 24
subject 24
as 24
though 24
a 24
natural 24
order 24
must 24
be 24
originated 24
from 24
our 24
will 24
this 24
law 24
therefore 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
a 24
natural 24
system 24
not 24
given 24
in 24
experience 24
and 24
yet 24
possible 24
through 24
freedom 24
a 24
system 24
therefore 24
which 24
is 24
supersensible 24
and 24
to 24
which 24
we 24
give 24
objective 24
reality 24
at 24
least 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
since 24
we 24
look 24
on 24
it 24
as 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
our 24
will 24
as 24
pure 24
rational 24
beings 24
hence 24
the 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
laws 24
of 24
a 24
natural 24
system 24
to 24
which 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
subject 24
and 24
of 24
a 24
natural 24
system 24
which 24
is 24
subject 24
to 24
a 24

as 24
far 24
as 24
its 24
relation 24
to 24
its 24
free 24
actions 24
is 24
concerned 24
rests 24
on 24
this 24
that 24
in 24
the 24
former 24
the 24
objects 24
must 24
be 24
causes 24
of 24
the 24
ideas 24
which 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
whereas 24
in 24
the 24
latter 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
the 24
objects 24
so 24
that 24
its 24
causality 24
has 24
its 24
determining 24
principle 24
solely 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
faculty 24
of 24
reason 24
which 24
may 24
therefore 24
be 24
called 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
there 24
are 24
therefore 24
two 24
very 24
distinct 24
problems 24
how 24
on 24
the 24
one 24

an 24

no 24

we 24
are 24
here 24

only 24
with 24

the 24

in 24
this 24

criticism 24
may 24
and 24
must 24
begin 24
with 24
pure 24
practical 24
laws 24
and 24
their 24
reality 24
but 24
instead 24
of 24
intuition 24
it 24
takes 24
as 24
their 24
foundation 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
their 24
existence 24
in 24
the 24
intelligible 24
world 24
namely 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
for 24
this 24
concept 24
has 24
no 24
other 24
meaning 24
and 24
these 24
laws 24
are 24
only 24
possible 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
freedom 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
but 24
freedom 24
being 24
supposed 24
they 24
are 24
necessary 24
or 24
conversely 24
freedom 24
is 24
necessary 24
because 24
those 24
laws 24
are 24
necessary 24
being 24
practical 24
postulates 24
it 24
cannot 24
be 24
further 24
explained 24
how 24
this 24
consciousness 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
or 24
what 24
is 24
the 24
same 24
thing 24
of 24
freedom 24
is 24
possible 24
but 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
admissible 24
is 24
well 24
established 24
in 24
the 24
theoretical 24
critique 24
the 24
exposition 24
of 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
is 24
now 24
finished 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
shown 24
first 24
what 24
it 24
contains 24
that 24
it 24
subsists 24
for 24
itself 24
quite 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
independent 24
of 24
empirical 24
principles 24
and 24
next 24
in 24
what 24
it 24
is 24
distinguished 24
from 24
all 24
other 24
practical 24
principles 24
with 24
the 24
deduction 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
justification 24
of 24
its 24
objective 24
and 24
universal 24
validity 24
and 24
the 24
discernment 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
synthetical 24
proposition 24
a 24
priori 24
we 24
cannot 24
expect 24
to 24
succeed 24
so 24
well 24
as 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
the 24
principles 24
of 24
pure 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
for 24
these 24
referred 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
possible 24
experience 24
namely 24
to 24
phenomena 24
and 24
we 24
could 24
prove 24
that 24
these 24
phenomena 24
could 24
be 24
known 24
as 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
only 24
by 24
being 24
brought 24
under 24
the 24
categories 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
these 24
laws 24
and 24
consequently 24
that 24
all 24
possible 24
experience 24
must 24
conform 24
to 24
these 24
laws 24
but 24
i 24
could 24
not 24
proceed 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
with 24
the 24
deduction 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
for 24
this 24
does 24
not 24
concern 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
properties 24
of 24
objects 24
which 24
may 24
be 24
given 24
to 24
the 24
reason 24
from 24
some 24
other 24
source 24
but 24
a 24
knowledge 24
which 24
can 24
itself 24
be 24
the 24
ground 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
objects 24
and 24
by 24
which 24
reason 24
in 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24
has 24
causality 24
ie 24
pure 24
reason 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
a 24
faculty 24
immediately 24
determining 24
the 24
will 24
now 24
all 24
our 24
human 24
insight 24
is 24
at 24
an 24
end 24
as 24
soon 24
as 24
we 24
have 24
arrived 24
at 24
fundamental 24
powers 24
or 24
faculties 24
for 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
these 24
cannot 24
be 24
understood 24
by 24
any 24
means 24
and 24
just 24
as 24
little 24
should 24
it 24
be 24
arbitrarily 24
invented 24
and 24
assumed 24
therefore 24
in 24
the 24
theoretic 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
experience 24
alone 24
that 24
can 24
justify 24
us 24
in 24
assuming 24
them 24
but 24
this 24
expedient 24
of 24
adducing 24
empirical 24
proofs 24
instead 24
of 24
a 24
deduction 24
from 24
a 24
priori 24
sources 24
of 24
knowledge 24
is 24
denied 24
us 24
here 24
in 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
faculty 24
of 24
reason 24
for 24
whatever 24
requires 24
to 24
draw 24
the 24
proof 24
of 24
its 24
reality 24
from 24
experience 24
must 24
depend 24
for 24
the 24
grounds 24
of 24
its 24
possibility 24
on 24
principles 24
of 24
experience 24
and 24
pure 24
yet 24
practical 24
reason 24
by 24
its 24
very 24
notion 24
cannot 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
such 24
further 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
given 24
as 24
a 24
fact 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
a 24
priori 24
conscious 24
and 24
which 24
is 24
apodeictically 24
certain 24
though 24
it 24
be 24
granted 24
that 24
in 24
experience 24
no 24
example 24
of 24
its 24
exact 24
fulfilment 24
can 24
be 24
found 24
hence 24
the 24
objective 24
reality 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
cannot 24
be 24
proved 24
by 24
any 24
deduction 24

any 24
efforts 24
of 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
whether 24
speculative 24

empirically 24
supported 24

therefore 24
even 24
if 24
we 24
renounced 24
its 24
apodeictic 24
certainty 24
it 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
proved 24
a 24

by 24
experience 24

it 24

firmly 24
established 24

itself 24

instead 24
of 24
this 24
vainly 24
sought 24
deduction 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
principle 24
something 24
else 24
is 24
found 24
which 24
was 24
quite 24
unexpected 24
namely 24
that 24
this 24
moral 24
principle 24

conversely 24
as 24
the 24
principle 24

the 24
deduction 24
of 24
an 24
inscrutable 24
faculty 24

no 24

of 24

compelled 24
at 24
least 24
to 24
assume 24
the 24

to 24
find 24
amongst 24

in 24
the 24

the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
itself 24
does 24
not 24

a 24
justification 24
proves 24
not 24
merely 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
freedom 24
but 24
that 24
it 24
really 24
belongs 24
to 24
beings 24
who 24
recognize 24
this 24
law 24
as 24
binding 24
on 24
themselves 24
the 24
moral 24

fact 24
a 24
law 24

therefore 24

a 24
supersensible 24
system 24
of 24
nature 24

the 24
metaphysical 24
law 24
of 24
events 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24

law 24
of 24
causality 24
of 24
the 24
sensible 24
system 24
of 24
nature 24
and 24
it 24
therefore 24
determines 24
what 24
speculative 24
philosophy 24
was 24
compelled 24
to 24
leave 24
undetermined 24
namely 24
the 24
law 24
for 24
a 24
causality 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
which 24
in 24
the 24
latter 24
was 24
only 24
negative 24
and 24
therefore 24
for 24
the 24
first 24
time 24
gives 24
this 24
concept 24
objective 24
reality 24
this 24
sort 24
of 24
credential 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24

that 24
it 24

forth 24
as 24

principle 24
of 24

deduction 24
of 24
freedom 24
which 24
is 24
a 24
causality 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
is 24
a 24
sufficient 24
substitute 24
for 24
all 24
a 24
priori 24
justification 24
since 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
was 24
compelled 24
to 24
assume 24
at 24
least 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
freedom 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
satisfy 24
a 24
want 24
of 24
its 24
own 24
for 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
proves 24
its 24
reality 24
so 24
as 24
even 24
to 24
satisfy 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
the 24
speculative 24
reason 24
by 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
it 24
adds 24
a 24
positive 24
definition 24
to 24
a 24
causality 24
previously 24
conceived 24
only 24
negatively 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
which 24
was 24
incomprehensible 24
to 24
speculative 24
reason 24
which 24
yet 24
was 24
compelled 24
to 24
suppose 24
it 24
for 24
it 24
adds 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
reason 24
that 24
directly 24
determines 24
the 24
will 24
by 24
imposing 24
on 24
its 24
maxims 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
a 24
universal 24
legislative 24
form 24
and 24
thus 24
it 24
is 24
able 24
for 24
the 24
first 24
time 24
to 24
give 24
objective 24
though 24
only 24
practical 24
reality 24
to 24
reason 24
which 24
always 24
became 24
transcendent 24
when 24
it 24
sought 24
to 24
proceed 24
speculatively 24
with 24
its 24
ideas 24
it 24
thus 24
changes 24
the 24
transcendent 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
into 24
an 24
immanent 24
use 24
so 24
that 24
reason 24
is 24
itself 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
ideas 24
an 24
efficient 24
cause 24
in 24
the 24
field 24
of 24
experience 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
beings 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
as 24
such 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
unconditioned 24
and 24
yet 24
for 24
every 24
series 24
of 24
conditions 24
there 24
must 24
be 24
something 24
unconditioned 24
and 24
therefore 24
there 24
must 24
be 24
a 24
causality 24
which 24
is 24
determined 24
wholly 24
by 24
itself 24
hence 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
freedom 24
as 24
a 24
faculty 24
of 24
absolute 24
spontaneity 24
was 24
not 24
found 24
to 24
be 24
a 24
want 24
but 24
as 24
far 24
as 24
its 24
possibility 24
is 24
concerned 24
an 24
analytic 24
principle 24
of 24
pure 24
speculative 24
reason 24
but 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
absolutely 24
impossible 24
to 24
find 24
in 24
experience 24
any 24
example 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
this 24
idea 24
because 24
amongst 24
the 24
causes 24
of 24

to 24
physical 24

if 24
reason 24
sought 24
to 24

this 24
it 24

have 24
to 24
show 24
how 24
the 24
logical 24
relation 24
of 24
principle 24

consequence 24
can 24
be 24
used 24
synthetically 24
in 24
a 24
different 24
sort 24
of 24
intuition 24
from 24
the 24
sensible 24
that 24
is 24
how 24
a 24

possible 24
this 24
it 24
can 24
never 24
do 24
and 24
as 24
practical 24
reason 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
even 24
concern 24
itself 24
with 24
it 24
since 24
it 24
only 24
places 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
causality 24
of 24
man 24
as 24
a 24
sensible 24
creature 24
which 24
is 24
given 24
in 24
pure 24
reason 24
which 24
is 24
therefore 24
called 24
practical 24
and 24
therefore 24
it 24
employs 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
not 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
know 24
objects 24
but 24
to 24
determine 24
causality 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
objects 24
in 24
general 24
it 24
can 24
abstract 24
altogether 24
from 24
the 24
application 24
of 24
this 24
notion 24
to 24
objects 24
with 24
a 24
view 24
to 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
since 24
this 24
concept 24
is 24
always 24
found 24
a 24
priori 24
in 24
the 24
understanding 24
even 24
independently 24
of 24
any 24
intuition 24
reason 24
then 24
employs 24
it 24
only 24
for 24
a 24
practical 24
purpose 24
and 24
hence 24
we 24
can 24
transfer 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
into 24
the 24
intelligible 24
order 24
of 24
things 24
admitting 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
that 24
we 24
cannot 24
understand 24
how 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
can 24
determine 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
these 24
things 24
but 24
reason 24
must 24
cognise 24
causality 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
actions 24
of 24
the 24

in 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
in 24
a 24
definite 24
manner 24
otherwise 24
practical 24
reason 24
could 24
not 24
really 24
produce 24
any 24
action 24
but 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
notion 24
which 24
it 24
forms 24
of 24
its 24
own 24
causality 24

david 24
hume 24
of 24
whom 24
we 24
may 24
say 24
that 24
he 24
commenced 24
the 24
assault 24
on 24
the 24
claims 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
which 24
made 24
a 24
thorough 24
investigation 24
of 24
it 24
necessary 24
argued 24
thus 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
is 24
a 24
notion 24
that 24
involves 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
connexion 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
different 24
things 24
and 24
that 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
are 24
different 24
so 24
that 24
given 24
a 24
i 24
know 24
that 24
something 24
quite 24
distinct 24
there 24
from 24

b 24
must 24
necessarily 24
also 24
exist 24
now 24
necessity 24
can 24
be 24
attributed 24
to 24
a 24
connection 24
only 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
known 24
a 24
priori 24
for 24
experience 24
would 24
only 24
enable 24
us 24
to 24
know 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
connection 24
that 24
it 24
exists 24
not 24
that 24
it 24
necessarily 24
exists 24
now 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
says 24
he 24
to 24
know 24
a 24

and 24
as 24
necessary 24
the 24
connection 24
between 24
one 24
thing 24
and 24
another 24
or 24
between 24
one 24
attribute 24
and 24
another 24
quite 24
distinct 24
when 24
they 24
have 24
not 24
been 24
given 24
in 24
experience 24
therefore 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
cause 24
is 24
fictitious 24
and 24
delusive 24
and 24
to 24
speak 24
in 24
the 24
mildest 24
way 24
is 24
an 24
illusion 24
only 24
excusable 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
the 24
custom 24
a 24
subjective 24
necessity 24
of 24
perceiving 24
certain 24
things 24
or 24
their 24
attributes 24
as 24
often 24
associated 24
in 24
existence 24
along 24
with 24
or 24
in 24
succession 24
to 24
one 24
another 24
is 24
insensibly 24
taken 24
for 24
an 24
objective 24
necessity 24
of 24
supposing 24
such 24
a 24
connection 24
in 24
the 24
objects 24
themselves 24
and 24
thus 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
cause 24
has 24
been 24
acquired 24
surreptitiously 24
and 24
not 24
legitimately 24
nay 24
it 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
so 24
acquired 24
or 24
authenticated 24
since 24
it 24
demands 24
a 24
connection 24
in 24
itself 24
vain 24
chimerical 24
and 24
untenable 24
in 24
presence 24
of 24
reason 24
and 24
to 24
which 24
no 24
object 24
can 24
ever 24
correspond 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
was 24

introduced 24
as 24
the 24
sole 24
source 24
of 24
principles 24
as 24
far 24
as 24
all 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
is 24
concerned 24
mathematics 24
therefore 24
remaining 24
excepted 24
and 24
with 24
empiricism 24
the 24
most 24
thorough 24
scepticism 24
even 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
the 24
whole 24
science 24
of 24
nature 24
as 24
philosophy 24
for 24
on 24
such 24
principles 24
we 24
can 24
never 24
conclude 24
from 24
given 24
attributes 24
of 24
things 24
as 24
existing 24
to 24
a 24
consequence 24
for 24
this 24
would 24
require 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
which 24
involves 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
connection 24
we 24
can 24
only 24
guided 24
by 24
imagination 24
expect 24
similar 24
cases 24
an 24
expectation 24
which 24
is 24
never 24
certain 24
however 24
of 24
ten 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
fulfilled 24
of 24
no 24
event 24
could 24
we 24
say 24
a 24
certain 24
thing 24
must 24
have 24
preceded 24
it 24
on 24
which 24
it 24
necessarily 24
followed 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
must 24
have 24
a 24
cause 24
and 24
therefore 24
however 24
frequent 24
the 24
cases 24
we 24
have 24
known 24
in 24
which 24
there 24
was 24
such 24
an 24
antecedent 24
so 24
that 24
a 24
rule 24
could 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
them 24
yet 24
we 24
never 24
could 24
suppose 24
it 24
as 24
always 24
and 24
necessarily 24
so 24
happening 24
we 24
should 24
therefore 24
be 24
obliged 24
to 24
leave 24
its 24
share 24
to 24
blind 24
chance 24
with 24
which 24
all 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
comes 24
to 24
an 24
end 24
and 24
this 24
firmly 24
establishes 24
scepticism 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
arguments 24
ascending 24
from 24
effects 24
to 24
causes 24
and 24
makes 24
it 24
impregnable 24
mathematics 24
escaped 24
well 24
so 24
far 24
because 24
hume 24
thought 24
that 24
its 24
propositions 24
were 24
analytical 24
that 24
is 24
proceeded 24
from 24
one 24
property 24
to 24
another 24
by 24
virtue 24
of 24
identity 24
and 24
consequently 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
contradiction 24
this 24
however 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
case 24
since 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
they 24
are 24
synthetical 24
and 24
although 24
geometry 24
for 24
example 24
has 24
not 24
to 24
do 24
with 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
but 24
only 24
with 24
their 24
a 24
priori 24
properties 24
in 24
a 24
possible 24
intuition 24
yet 24
it 24
proceeds 24
just 24
as 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
the 24
causal 24
notion 24
from 24
one 24
property 24
a 24
to 24
another 24
wholly 24
distinct 24
b 24
as 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
former 24
nevertheless 24
mathematical 24
science 24
so 24
highly 24
vaunted 24
for 24
its 24
apodeictic 24
certainty 24
must 24
at 24
last 24
fall 24
under 24
this 24
empiricism 24
for 24
the 24
same 24
reason 24
for 24
which 24
hume 24
put 24
custom 24
in 24
the 24
place 24
of 24
objective 24
necessity 24
in 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
and 24
in 24
spite 24
of 24
all 24
its 24
pride 24
must 24
consent 24
to 24
lower 24
its 24
bold 24
pretension 24
of 24
claiming 24
assent 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
depend 24
for 24
assent 24
to 24
the 24
universality 24
of 24
its 24
propositions 24
on 24
the 24
kindness 24
of 24
observers 24
who 24
when 24
called 24
as 24
witnesses 24
would 24
surely 24
not 24
hesitate 24
to 24
admit 24
that 24
what 24
the 24
geometer 24
propounds 24
as 24
a 24
theorem 24
they 24
have 24
always 24
perceived 24
to 24
be 24
the 24
fact 24
and 24
consequently 24
although 24
it 24
be 24
not 24
necessarily 24
true 24
yet 24
they 24
would 24
permit 24
us 24
to 24
expect 24
it 24
to 24
be 24
true 24
in 24
the 24
future 24
in 24
this 24
manner 24
humes 24
empiricism 24
leads 24
inevitably 24
to 24
scepticism 24
even 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
mathematics 24
and 24
consequently 24
in 24
every 24
scientific 24
theoretical 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
for 24
this 24
belongs 24
either 24
to 24
philosophy 24
or 24
mathematics 24
whether 24
with 24
such 24
a 24
terrible 24
overthrow 24
of 24
the 24
chief 24
branches 24
of 24
knowledge 24
common 24
reason 24
will 24
escape 24
better 24
and 24
will 24
not 24
rather 24
become 24
irrecoverably 24
involved 24
in 24
this 24
destruction 24
of 24
all 24
knowledge 24
so 24
that 24
from 24
the 24
same 24
principles 24
a 24
universal 24
scepticism 24
should 24
follow 24
affecting 24
indeed 24
only 24
the 24
learned 24
this 24
i 24
will 24
leave 24
everyone 24
to 24
judge 24
for 24
himself 24
as 24
regards 24
my 24
own 24
labours 24
in 24
the 24
critical 24
examination 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
which 24
were 24
occasioned 24
by 24
humes 24
sceptical 24
teaching 24
but 24
went 24
much 24
further 24
and 24
embraced 24
the 24
whole 24
field 24
of 24
pure 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
in 24
its 24
synthetic 24
use 24
and 24
consequently 24
the 24
field 24
of 24
what 24
is 24
called 24
metaphysics 24
in 24
general 24
i 24
proceeded 24
in 24
the 24
following 24
manner 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
doubts 24
raised 24
by 24
the 24
scottish 24
philosopher 24
touching 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
if 24
hume 24
took 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
for 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
as 24
is 24
almost 24
always 24
done 24
he 24
was 24
quite 24
right 24
in 24
declaring 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
to 24
be 24
a 24
deception 24
and 24
false 24
illusion 24
for 24
as 24
to 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
and 24
their 24
attributes 24
as 24
such 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
to 24
see 24
why 24
because 24
a 24
is 24
given 24
b 24
which 24
is 24
different 24
must 24
necessarily 24
be 24
also 24
given 24
and 24
therefore 24
he 24
could 24
by 24
no 24
means 24
admit 24
such 24
an 24
a 24
priori 24
knowledge 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
still 24
less 24
could 24
this 24
acute 24
writer 24
allow 24
an 24
empirical 24
origin 24
of 24
this 24
concept 24
since 24
this 24
is 24
directly 24
contradictory 24
to 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
connection 24
which 24
constitutes 24
the 24
essence 24
of 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
hence 24
the 24
notion 24
was 24
proscribed 24
and 24
in 24
its 24
place 24
was 24
put 24
custom 24
in 24
the 24
observation 24
of 24
the 24
course 24
of 24
perceptions 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
it 24
resulted 24
however 24
from 24
my 24
inquiries 24
that 24
the 24
objects 24
with 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
do 24
in 24
experience 24
are 24
by 24
no 24
means 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
but 24
merely 24
phenomena 24
and 24
that 24
although 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
to 24
see 24
how 24
if 24
a 24
is 24
supposed 24
it 24
should 24
be 24
contradictory 24
that 24
b 24
which 24
is 24
quite 24
different 24
from 24
a 24
should 24
not 24
also 24
be 24
supposed 24
ie 24
to 24
see 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
connection 24
between 24
a 24
as 24
cause 24
and 24
b 24
as 24
effect 24
yet 24
it 24
can 24
very 24
well 24
be 24
conceived 24
that 24
as 24
phenomena 24
they 24
may 24
be 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
in 24
one 24
experience 24
in 24
a 24
certain 24
way 24
eg 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
timerelations 24
so 24
that 24
they 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
separated 24
without 24
contradicting 24
that 24
connection 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
which 24
this 24
experience 24
is 24
possible 24
in 24
which 24
they 24
are 24
objects 24
and 24
in 24
which 24
alone 24
they 24
are 24
cognisable 24
by 24
us 24
and 24
so 24
it 24
was 24
found 24
to 24
be 24
in 24
fact 24
so 24
that 24
i 24
was 24
able 24
not 24
only 24
to 24
prove 24
the 24
objective 24
reality 24
of 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
cause 24
in 24
regard 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
but 24
also 24
to 24
deduce 24
it 24
as 24
an 24
a 24
priori 24
concept 24
by 24
reason 24
of 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
connection 24
it 24
implied 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
show 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
its 24
origin 24
from 24
pure 24
understanding 24
without 24
any 24
empirical 24
sources 24
and 24
thus 24
after 24
removing 24
the 24
source 24
of 24
empiricism 24
i 24
was 24
able 24
also 24
to 24
overthrow 24
the 24
inevitable 24
consequence 24
of 24
this 24
namely 24
scepticism 24
first 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
physical 24
science 24
and 24
then 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
mathematics 24
in 24
which 24
empiricism 24
has 24
just 24
the 24
same 24
grounds 24
both 24
being 24
sciences 24
which 24
have 24
reference 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
possible 24
experience 24
herewith 24
overthrowing 24
the 24
thorough 24
doubt 24
of 24
whatever 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
professes 24
to 24
discern 24
but 24
how 24
is 24
it 24
with 24
the 24
application 24
of 24
this 24
category 24
of 24
causality 24
and 24
all 24
the 24
others 24
for 24
without 24
them 24
there 24
can 24
be 24

existing 24
to 24
things 24
which 24
are 24
not 24
objects 24
of 24
possible 24
experience 24
but 24
lie 24
beyond 24
its 24
bounds 24
for 24
i 24
was 24
able 24
to 24
deduce 24
the 24
objective 24

of 24
these 24
concepts 24
only 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24

but 24
even 24
this 24
very 24
fact 24
that 24
i 24
have 24
saved 24
them 24
only 24
in 24
case 24
i 24
have 24
proved 24
that 24
objects 24
may 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
them 24
be 24
thought 24
though 24
not 24
determined 24
a 24
priori 24
this 24
it 24
is 24
that 24
gives 24
them 24
a 24
place 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
by 24
which 24
they 24
are 24
referred 24
to 24
objects 24
in 24
general 24
sensible 24
or 24
not 24
sensible 24
if 24
anything 24
is 24
still 24
wanting 24
it 24
is 24
that 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
application 24
of 24
these 24
categories 24
and 24
especially 24
that 24
of 24
causality 24
to 24
objects 24
namely 24
intuition 24
for 24
where 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
given 24
the 24
application 24
with 24
a 24
view 24
to 24
theoretic 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
as 24
a 24
noumenon 24

impossible 24
and 24
therefore 24
if 24
anyone 24
ventures 24
on 24
it 24
is 24
as 24
in 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
pure 24

absolutely 24
forbidden 24

of 24
causality 24
remains 24
and 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
used 24
even 24
of 24
noumena 24
but 24
without 24
our 24
being 24
able 24
in 24
the 24
least 24
to 24
define 24
the 24
concept 24
theoretically 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
produce 24
knowledge 24
for 24
that 24
this 24
concept 24
even 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
an 24
object 24
contains 24
nothing 24
impossible 24
was 24
shown 24
by 24
this 24
that 24
even 24
while 24
applied 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
sense 24
its 24
seat 24
was 24
certainly 24
fixed 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
and 24
although 24
when 24
referred 24
to 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
capable 24
of 24
being 24
determined 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
represent 24
a 24
definite 24
object 24
for 24
the 24
purpose 24
of 24
theoretic 24
knowledge 24
yet 24
for 24
any 24
other 24
purpose 24
for 24
instance 24
a 24
practical 24
it 24
might 24
be 24
capable 24
of 24
being 24
determined 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
have 24
such 24
application 24
this 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
the 24
case 24
if 24
as 24
hume 24
maintained 24
this 24
concept 24
of 24
causality 24
contained 24
something 24
absolutely 24
impossible 24
to 24
be 24
thought 24
in 24
order 24
now 24
to 24
discover 24
this 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
application 24
of 24
the 24
said 24
concept 24
to 24
noumena 24
we 24
need 24
only 24
recall 24
why 24
we 24
are 24
not 24
content 24
with 24
its 24
application 24
to 24
objects 24
of 24
experience 24
but 24
desire 24
also 24
to 24
apply 24
it 24
to 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
it 24
will 24
appear 24
then 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
theoretic 24
but 24
a 24
practical 24
purpose 24
that 24
makes 24
this 24
a 24
necessity 24
in 24
speculation 24
even 24
if 24
we 24
were 24
successful 24
in 24
it 24
we 24
should 24
not 24
really 24
gain 24
anything 24
in 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
nature 24
or 24
generally 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
such 24
objects 24
as 24
are 24
given 24
but 24
we 24
should 24
make 24
a 24
wide 24
step 24
from 24
the 24
sensibly 24
conditioned 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
already 24
enough 24
to 24
do 24
to 24
maintain 24
ourselves 24
and 24
to 24
follow 24
carefully 24
the 24
chain 24
of 24
causes 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
complete 24
our 24
knowledge 24
of 24
principles 24
and 24
to 24
fix 24
its 24
limits 24
whereas 24
there 24
always 24
remains 24
an 24
infinite 24
chasm 24
unfilled 24
between 24
those 24
limits 24
and 24
what 24
we 24
know 24
and 24
we 24
should 24
have 24
hearkened 24
to 24
a 24
vain 24
curiosity 24
rather 24
than 24
a 24
soliddesire 24
of 24
knowledge 24
but 24
besides 24
the 24
relation 24
in 24
which 24
the 24
understanding 24
stands 24
to 24
objects 24
in 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
it 24
has 24
also 24
a 24
relation 24
to 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
which 24
is 24
therefore 24
called 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
the 24
pure 24
will 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
pure 24
understanding 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
called 24
reason 24
is 24
practical 24
through 24
the 24
mere 24
conception 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
the 24
objective 24
reality 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24

or 24
what 24

the 24
same 24
thing 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
is 24
given 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
a 24
priori 24
as 24
it 24
were 24
by 24
a 24
fact 24
for 24
so 24
we 24
may 24
name 24
a 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
is 24
inevitable 24
although 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
rest 24
on 24
empirical 24
principles 24
now 24
in 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
will 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
is 24
already 24
contained 24
and 24
hence 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
will 24
contains 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
causality 24
accompanied 24
with 24
freedom 24
that 24
is 24
one 24
which 24
is 24
not 24
determinable 24
by 24
physical 24
laws 24
and 24
consequently 24
is 24
not 24
capable 24
of 24
any 24
empirical 24
intuition 24
in 24
proof 24
of 24
its 24
reality 24
but 24
nevertheless 24
completely 24
justifies 24
its 24
objective 24
reality 24
a 24
priori 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
not 24
indeed 24
as 24
is 24
easily 24
seen 24
for 24
the 24
purposes 24
of 24
the 24
theoretical 24
but 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
now 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
that 24
has 24
free 24
will 24
is 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
causa 24
noumenon 24
and 24
that 24
this 24
notion 24
involves 24
no 24
contradiction 24
we 24
are 24
already 24
assured 24
by 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
cause 24
has 24
arisen 24
wholly 24
from 24
pure 24
understanding 24
and 24
has 24
its 24
objective 24
reality 24
assured 24
by 24
the 24
deduction 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
moreover 24
in 24
its 24
origin 24
independent 24
of 24
any 24
sensible 24
conditions 24
it 24
is 24
therefore 24
not 24
restricted 24
to 24
phenomena 24
unless 24
we 24
wanted 24
to 24
make 24
a 24
definite 24
theoretic 24
use 24
of 24
it 24
but 24
can 24
be 24
applied 24
equally 24
to 24
things 24
that 24
are 24
objects 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
but 24
since 24
this 24
application 24
cannot 24
rest 24
on 24
any 24
intuition 24
for 24
intuition 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
sensible 24
therefore 24
causa 24
noumenon 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
theoretic 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
although 24
a 24
possible 24
and 24
thinkable 24
is 24
yet 24
an 24
empty 24
notion 24
now 24
i 24
do 24
not 24
desire 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
this 24
to 24
understand 24
theoretically 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
has 24
a 24
pure 24
will 24
it 24
is 24
enough 24
for 24
me 24
to 24
have 24
thereby 24
designated 24
it 24
as 24
such 24
and 24
hence 24
to 24
combine 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
with 24
that 24
of 24
freedom 24
and 24
what 24
is 24
inseparable 24
from 24
it 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
its 24
determining 24
principle 24
now 24
this 24
right 24
i 24
certainly 24
have 24
by 24
virtue 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
notempirical 24
origin 24
of 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
cause 24
since 24
i 24
do 24
not 24
consider 24
myself 24
entitled 24
to 24
make 24
any 24
use 24
of 24
it 24
except 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
determines 24
its 24
reality 24
that 24
is 24
only 24
a 24
practical 24
use 24
if 24
with 24
hume 24
i 24
had 24
denied 24
to 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
all 24
objective 24
reality 24
in 24
its 24
theoretic 24
use 24
not 24
merely 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
the 24
supersensible 24
but 24
also 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
it 24
would 24
have 24
lost 24
all 24
significance 24
and 24
being 24
a 24
theoretically 24
impossible 24
notion 24
would 24
have 24
been 24
declared 24
to 24
be 24
quite 24
useless 24
and 24
since 24
what 24
is 24
nothing 24
cannot 24
be 24
made 24
any 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
a 24
concept 24
theoretically 24
null 24
would 24
have 24
been 24
absurd 24
but 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
a 24
causality 24
free 24
from 24
empirical 24
conditions 24
although 24
empty 24
ie 24
without 24
any 24
appropriate 24
intuition 24
is 24
yet 24
theoretically 24
possible 24
and 24
refers 24
to 24
an 24
indeterminate 24
object 24
but 24
in 24
compensation 24
significance 24
is 24
given 24
to 24
it 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
consequently 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
sense 24
i 24
have 24
indeed 24
no 24
intuition 24
which 24
should 24
determine 24
its 24
objective 24
theoretic 24
reality 24
but 24
not 24
the 24
less 24
it 24
has 24
a 24
real 24
application 24
which 24
is 24
exhibited 24
in 24
concreto 24
in 24
intentions 24
or 24
maxims 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
has 24
a 24
practical 24
reality 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
specified 24
and 24
this 24
is 24
sufficient 24
to 24
justify 24
it 24
even 24
with 24
a 24
view 24
to 24
noumena 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
now 24
this 24
objective 24
reality 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
in 24
the 24
sphere 24
of 24
the 24
supersensible 24
once 24
brought 24
in 24
gives 24
an 24
objective 24
reality 24
also 24
to 24
all 24
the 24
other 24
categories 24
although 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
stand 24
in 24
necessary 24
connexion 24
with 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
a 24
reality 24
only 24
of 24
practical 24
application 24
which 24
has 24
not 24
the 24
least 24
effect 24
in 24
enlarging 24
our 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
of 24
these 24
objects 24
or 24
the 24
discernment 24
of 24
their 24
nature 24
by 24
pure 24
reason 24
so 24
we 24
shall 24
find 24
also 24
in 24
the 24
sequel 24
that 24
these 24
categories 24
refer 24
only 24
to 24
beings 24
as 24
intelligences 24
and 24
in 24
them 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
reason 24
to 24
the 24
will 24
consequently 24
always 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
practical 24
and 24
beyond 24
this 24
cannot 24
pretend 24
to 24
any 24
knowledge 24
of 24
these 24
beings 24
and 24
whatever 24
other 24
properties 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
theoretical 24
representation 24
of 24
supersensible 24
things 24
may 24
be 24
brought 24
into 24
connexion 24
with 24
these 24
categories 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
to 24
be 24
reckoned 24
as 24
knowledge 24
but 24
only 24
as 24
a 24
right 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
however 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
necessity 24
to 24
admit 24
and 24
assume 24
such 24
beings 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
where 24
we 24
conceive 24
supersensible 24
beings 24
eg 24
god 24
according 24
to 24
analogy 24
that 24
is 24
a 24
purely 24
rational 24
relation 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
make 24
a 24
practical 24
use 24
with 24
reference 24
to 24
what 24
is 24
sensible 24
and 24
thus 24
the 24
application 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
solely 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
does 24
not 24
give 24
pure 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
the 24
least 24
encouragement 24
to 24
run 24

must 24
first 24
be 24
known 24

considered 24
a 24

the 24

principle 24

the 24
latter 24
therefore 24
as 24
determined 24
by 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
judgement 24
whether 24
a 24
thing 24
is 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24

not 24

not 24
depend 24
at 24
all 24
on 24
the 24
comparison 24
with 24
our 24
physical 24
power 24
and 24
the 24
question 24
is 24
only 24
whether 24
we 24
should 24
will 24
an 24
action 24
that 24
is 24
directed 24
to 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
if 24
the 24
object 24
were 24
in 24
our 24
power 24
hence 24
the 24
previous 24
question 24
is 24
only 24
as 24
the 24
moral 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
for 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
object 24
but 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
the 24
only 24
objects 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
are 24
therefore 24
those 24
of 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
for 24
by 24
the 24
former 24
is 24
meant 24
an 24
object 24
necessarily 24
desired 24
according 24
to 24
a 24
principle 24
of 24
reason 24
by 24
the 24
latter 24
one 24
necessarily 24
shunned 24
also 24
according 24
to 24
a 24
principle 24
of 24
reason 24
if 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
good 24
is 24
not 24
to 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
an 24
antecedent 24
practical 24
law 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
is 24
to 24
serve 24
as 24
its 24
foundation 24
it 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
something 24
whose 24
existence 24
promises 24
pleasure 24
and 24
thus 24
determines 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
to 24
produce 24
it 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
determines 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
now 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
to 24
discern 24
a 24
priori 24
what 24
idea 24
will 24
be 24
accompanied 24
with 24
pleasure 24
and 24
what 24
with 24
pain 24
it 24
will 24
depend 24
on 24
experience 24
alone 24
to 24
find 24
out 24
what 24
is 24
primarily 24
good 24
or 24
evil 24
the 24
property 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
with 24
reference 24
to 24
which 24
alone 24
this 24
experiment 24
can 24
be 24
made 24
is 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
and 24
pain 24
a 24
receptivity 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
internal 24
sense 24
thus 24
that 24
only 24
would 24
be 24
primarily 24
good 24
with 24
which 24
the 24
sensation 24
of 24
pleasure 24
is 24
immediately 24
connected 24
and 24
that 24
simply 24
evil 24
which 24
immediately 24
excites 24
pain 24
since 24
however 24
this 24
is 24
opposed 24
even 24
to 24
the 24
usage 24
of 24
language 24
which 24
distinguishes 24
the 24
pleasant 24
from 24
the 24
good 24
the 24
unpleasant 24
from 24
the 24
evil 24
and 24
requires 24
that 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
shall 24
always 24
be 24
judged 24
by 24
reason 24
and 24
therefore 24
by 24
concepts 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
communicated 24
to 24
everyone 24
and 24
not 24
by 24
mere 24
sensation 24
which 24
is 24
limited 24
to 24
individual 24
subjects 24
and 24
their 24
susceptibility 24
and 24
since 24
nevertheless 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
cannot 24
be 24
connected 24
with 24
any 24
idea 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
a 24
priori 24
the 24
philosopher 24
who 24
thought 24
himself 24
obliged 24
to 24
make 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
his 24
practical 24
judgements 24
would 24
call 24
that 24
good 24
which 24
is 24
a 24
means 24
to 24
the 24
pleasant 24
and 24
evil 24
what 24
is 24
a 24
cause 24
of 24
unpleasantness 24
and 24

the 24
judgement 24
on 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
means 24
to 24
ends 24
certainly 24
belongs 24
to 24
reason 24
but 24
although 24
reason 24
is 24
alone 24
capable 24
of 24
discerning 24
the 24
connexion 24
of 24
means 24
with 24
their 24
ends 24
so 24
that 24
the 24
will 24
might 24
even 24
be 24
defined 24
as 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
ends 24
since 24
these 24
are 24
always 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
desires 24
yet 24
the 24
practical 24
maxims 24
which 24
would 24
follow 24
from 24
the 24
aforesaid 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
good 24
being 24
merely 24
a 24
means 24
would 24
never 24
contain 24
as 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
anything 24
good 24
in 24
itself 24
but 24
only 24
something 24
good 24
for 24
something 24
the 24
good 24
would 24
always 24
be 24
merely 24
the 24
useful 24
and 24
that 24
for 24
which 24
it 24
is 24
useful 24
must 24
always 24
lie 24
outside 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
sensation 24
now 24
if 24
this 24
as 24
a 24
pleasant 24
sensation 24
were 24
to 24
be 24
distinguished 24
from 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
good 24
then 24
there 24
would 24
be 24
nothing 24
primarily 24
good 24
at 24
all 24
but 24
the 24
good 24
would 24
have 24
to 24
be 24
sought 24
only 24
in 24
the 24
means 24
to 24
something 24
else 24
namely 24
some 24
pleasantness 24
it 24
is 24
an 24
old 24
formula 24
of 24
the 24
schools 24
nihil 24
appetimus 24
nisi 24
sub 24
ratione 24
boni 24
nihil 24
aversamur 24
nisi 24
sub 24
ratione 24
mali 24
and 24
it 24
is 24
used 24
often 24
correctly 24
but 24
often 24
also 24
in 24
a 24
manner 24
injurious 24
to 24
philosophy 24
because 24
the 24
expressions 24
boni 24
and 24
mali 24
are 24
ambiguous 24
owing 24
to 24
the 24
poverty 24
of 24
language 24
in 24
consequence 24
of 24
which 24
they 24
admit 24
a 24
double 24
sense 24
and 24
therefore 24
inevitably 24
bring 24
the 24
practical 24
laws 24
into 24
ambiguity 24
and 24
philosophy 24
which 24
in 24
employing 24
them 24
becomes 24
aware 24
of 24
the 24
different 24
meanings 24
in 24
the 24
same 24
word 24
but 24
can 24
find 24
no 24
special 24
expressions 24
for 24
them 24
is 24
driven 24
to 24
subtile 24
distinctions 24
about 24
which 24
there 24
is 24
subsequently 24
no 24
unanimity 24
because 24
the 24
distinction 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
directly 24
marked 24
by 24
any 24
suitable 24
expression 24
besides 24
this 24
the 24
expression 24
sub 24
ratione 24
boni 24
is 24
also 24
ambiguous 24
for 24
it 24
may 24
mean 24
we 24
represent 24
something 24
to 24
ourselves 24
as 24
good 24
when 24
and 24
because 24
we 24
desire 24
will 24
it 24
or 24
we 24
desire 24
something 24
because 24
we 24
represent 24
it 24
to 24
ourselves 24
as 24
good 24
so 24
that 24
either 24
the 24
desire 24
determines 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
as 24
a 24
good 24
or 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
good 24
determines 24
the 24
desire 24
the 24
will 24
so 24
that 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
case 24
sub 24
ratione 24
boni 24
would 24
mean 24
we 24
will 24
something 24
under 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
the 24
good 24
in 24
the 24
second 24

of 24
this 24

bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
the 24
german 24
language 24
has 24
the 24
good 24
fortune 24
to 24
possess 24
expressions 24
which 24
do 24
not 24
allow 24
this 24
difference 24
to 24
be 24
overlooked 24
it 24
possesses 24
two 24
very 24
distinct 24
concepts 24
and 24
especially 24
distinct 24
expressions 24
for 24
that 24
which 24
the 24
latins 24
express 24
by 24
a 24
single 24
word 24
bonum 24
for 24
bonum 24

woe 24
so 24
that 24
we 24
express 24
two 24
quite 24
distinct 24
judgements 24
when 24
we 24
consider 24
in 24
an 24
action 24
the 24
good 24

evil 24
of 24
it 24

weal 24

woe 24
ill 24
hence 24
it 24
already 24
follows 24
that 24
the 24
above 24
quoted 24
psychological 24
proposition 24
is 24
at 24
least 24
very 24
doubtful 24
if 24
it 24
is 24
translated 24
we 24
desire 24
nothing 24
except 24
with 24
a 24
view 24
to 24
our 24
weal 24
or 24
woe 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
if 24
we 24
render 24
it 24
thus 24
under 24
the 24
direction 24
of 24
reason 24
we 24
desire 24
nothing 24
except 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
we 24
esteem 24
it 24
good 24
or 24
evil 24
it 24
is 24
indubitably 24
certain 24
and 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
quite 24
clearly 24
expressed 24
well 24
or 24
ill 24
always 24
implies 24
only 24
a 24
reference 24
to 24
our 24
condition 24
as 24
pleasant 24
or 24
unpleasant 24
as 24
one 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
and 24
if 24
we 24
desire 24
or 24
avoid 24
an 24
object 24
on 24
this 24
account 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
referred 24
to 24
our 24
sensibility 24
and 24
to 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
that 24

quite 24
gratuitously 24
we 24
must 24
at 24
least 24
at 24
first 24
leave 24
it 24
undecided 24
whether 24
the 24
will 24
has 24
merely 24
empirical 24
principles 24
of 24
determination 24
or 24
whether 24
it 24
has 24
not 24
also 24
pure 24
a 24
priori 24
principles 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
contrary 24
to 24
all 24
rules 24
of 24
philosophical 24
method 24
to 24
assume 24
as 24
decided 24
that 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
very 24
point 24
in 24
question 24
supposing 24
that 24
we 24
wished 24
to 24
begin 24
with 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
good 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
deduce 24
from 24
it 24
the 24
laws 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
then 24
this 24
concept 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
as 24
a 24
good 24
would 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
assign 24
to 24
us 24
this 24
object 24
as 24
the 24
sole 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
now 24
since 24
this 24
concept 24
had 24
not 24
any 24
practical 24
a 24
priori 24
law 24
for 24
its 24
standard 24
the 24
criterion 24
of 24
good 24
or 24
evil 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
placed 24
in 24
anything 24
but 24
the 24
agreement 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
with 24
our 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
and 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
could 24
only 24
consist 24
in 24
determining 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
place 24
this 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
in 24
connexion 24
with 24
all 24
the 24
sensations 24
of 24
my 24
existence 24
and 24
in 24
the 24
second 24
place 24
the 24
means 24
of 24
securing 24
to 24
myself 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
pleasure 24
now 24
as 24
experience 24
alone 24
can 24
decide 24
what 24
conforms 24
to 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
and 24
by 24
hypothesis 24
the 24
practical 24
law 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
based 24
on 24
this 24
as 24
a 24
condition 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
a 24
priori 24
practical 24
laws 24
would 24
be 24
at 24
once 24
excluded 24
because 24
it 24
was 24
imagined 24
to 24
be 24
necessary 24
first 24
of 24
all 24
to 24
find 24
an 24
object 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
which 24
as 24
a 24
good 24
should 24
constitute 24
the 24
universal 24
though 24
empirical 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
but 24
what 24
it 24
was 24
necessary 24
to 24
inquire 24
first 24
of 24
all 24
was 24
whether 24
there 24
is 24
not 24
an 24
a 24
priori 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
this 24
could 24
never 24
be 24
found 24
anywhere 24
but 24
in 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
this 24
law 24
prescribes 24
to 24
maxims 24
merely 24
their 24
form 24
without 24
regard 24
to 24
an 24
object 24
since 24
however 24
we 24
laid 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
all 24
practical 24
law 24
in 24
an 24
object 24
determined 24
by 24
our 24
conceptions 24
of 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
whereas 24
without 24
a 24
previous 24
law 24
that 24
object 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
conceived 24
by 24
empirical 24
concepts 24
we 24
have 24
deprived 24
ourselves 24
beforehand 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
even 24
conceiving 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
if 24
we 24
had 24
first 24
investigated 24
the 24
latter 24
analytically 24
we 24
should 24
have 24
found 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
good 24
as 24
an 24
object 24
that 24
determines 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
makes 24
it 24
possible 24
but 24
that 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
that 24
first 24
determines 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
good 24
and 24
makes 24
it 24
possible 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
deserves 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
good 24
absolutely 24
this 24
remark 24
which 24
only 24
concerns 24
the 24
method 24
of 24
ultimate 24
ethical 24
inquiries 24
is 24
of 24
importance 24
it 24
explains 24
at 24
once 24
the 24
occasion 24
of 24
all 24
the 24
mistakes 24
of 24
philosophers 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
morals 24
for 24
they 24
sought 24
for 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
they 24
could 24
make 24
the 24
matter 24
and 24
principle 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
which 24
consequently 24
could 24
not 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
directly 24
but 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
that 24
object 24
referred 24
to 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
whereas 24
they 24
ought 24
first 24
to 24
have 24
searched 24
for 24
a 24
law 24
that 24
would 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
directly 24
and 24
afterwards 24
determine 24
the 24
object 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
the 24
will 24
now 24
whether 24
they 24
placed 24
this 24
object 24
of 24
pleasure 24
which 24
was 24
to 24
supply 24
the 24
supreme 24
conception 24
of 24
goodness 24
in 24
happiness 24
in 24
perfection 24
in 24
moral 24
feeling 24
or 24
in 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
god 24
their 24
principle 24
in 24
every 24
case 24
implied 24
heteronomy 24
and 24
they 24
must 24
inevitably 24
come 24
upon 24
empirical 24
conditions 24
of 24
a 24
moral 24
law 24
since 24
their 24
object 24
which 24
was 24
to 24
be 24
the 24
immediate 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
called 24
good 24
or 24
bad 24
except 24
in 24
its 24
immediate 24
relation 24
to 24
feeling 24
which 24
is 24
always 24
empirical 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
a 24
formal 24
law 24
that 24
is 24
one 24
which 24
prescribes 24
to 24
reason 24
nothing 24
more 24
than 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
its 24
universal 24
legislation 24
as 24
the 24
supreme 24
condition 24
of 24
its 24
maxims 24
that 24
can 24
be 24
a 24
priori 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
ancients 24
avowed 24
this 24
error 24
without 24
concealment 24
by 24
directing 24
all 24
their 24
moral 24
inquiries 24
to 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
they 24
intended 24
afterwards 24
to 24
make 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
whereas 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
far 24
later 24
when 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
has 24
been 24
first 24
established 24
for 24
itself 24
and 24
shown 24
to 24
be 24
the 24
direct 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
that 24
this 24
object 24
can 24
be 24
presented 24
to 24
the 24
will 24
whose 24
form 24
is 24
now 24
determined 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
this 24
we 24
shall 24
undertake 24
in 24
the 24
dialectic 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
moderns 24
with 24
whom 24
the 24
question 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
has 24
gone 24
out 24
of 24
fashion 24
or 24
at 24
least 24
seems 24
to 24
have 24
become 24
a 24
secondary 24
matter 24
hide 24
the 24
same 24
error 24
under 24
vague 24
expressions 24
as 24
in 24
many 24
other 24
cases 24
it 24
shows 24
itself 24
nevertheless 24
in 24
their 24
systems 24
as 24
it 24
always 24
produces 24
heteronomy 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
from 24
this 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
derived 24
a 24
moral 24
law 24
giving 24
universal 24
commands 24
now 24
since 24
the 24
notions 24
of 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
as 24
consequences 24
of 24
the 24
a 24
priori 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
imply 24
also 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
principle 24
and 24
therefore 24
a 24
causality 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
hence 24
they 24
do 24
not 24
originally 24
refer 24
to 24
objects 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
be 24
for 24
instance 24
special 24
modes 24

in 24
its 24

they 24
are 24
all 24

namely 24
that 24

consists 24

a 24

are 24

that 24
consequently 24
it 24
is 24
referred 24
to 24
the 24

which 24
concern 24
its 24
physical 24

whilst 24
yet 24
each 24
category 24
is 24
taken 24
so 24
universally 24
that 24
the 24

that 24
causality 24
can 24
be 24
placed 24
outside 24

finally 24
the 24

introduce 24

transition 24
from 24

only 24
problematically 24
these 24

nothing 24
further 24
here 24
in 24
explanation 24
of 24
the 24
present 24
table 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
intelligible 24

itself 24
a 24
division 24
of 24
this 24
kind 24
based 24
on 24
principles 24
is 24
very 24
useful 24
in 24
any 24

both 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
thoroughness 24
and 24
intelligibility 24
thus 24
for 24
instance 24
we 24
know 24
from 24
the 24
preceding 24
table 24
and 24
its 24
first 24
number 24
what 24
we 24
must 24
begin 24
from 24
in 24
practical 24
inquiries 24
namely 24
from 24
the 24
maxims 24
which 24
every 24
one 24
founds 24
on 24
his 24
own 24
inclinations 24
the 24
precepts 24
which 24
hold 24
for 24
a 24
species 24
of 24
rational 24
beings 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
agree 24
in 24
certain 24
inclinations 24
and 24
finally 24
the 24
law 24
which 24
holds 24
for 24
all 24
without 24
regard 24
to 24
their 24
inclinations 24
etc 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
we 24
survey 24
the 24
whole 24
plan 24
of 24
what 24
has 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
every 24
question 24
of 24

that 24

to 24
be 24
answered 24

also 24
the 24

that 24

be 24

the 24

they 24
themselves 24

are 24

it 24

not 24

a 24
question 24
to 24
be 24
decided 24
by 24
the 24
practical 24
judgement 24
by 24
which 24
what 24
is 24
said 24
in 24
the 24
rule 24
universally 24
in 24
abstracto 24
is 24
applied 24
to 24
an 24
action 24
in 24
concreto 24
but 24
since 24
a 24
practical 24
rule 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
place 24
as 24
practical 24
concerns 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
an 24

in 24
the 24
second 24
place 24
as 24
a 24
practical 24
rule 24
of 24
pure 24

implies 24
necessity 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
and 24
therefore 24
is 24
a 24
practical 24
law 24
not 24
a 24
physical 24
law 24
depending 24
on 24
empirical 24
principles 24
of 24
determination 24
but 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
freedom 24
by 24
which 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
determined 24
independently 24
on 24
anything 24
empirical 24
merely 24
by 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
and 24
its 24
form 24
whereas 24
all 24
instances 24
that 24
can 24
occur 24
of 24
possible 24
actions 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
empirical 24
that 24
is 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
experience 24
of 24
physical 24
nature 24
hence 24
it 24
seems 24
absurd 24
to 24
expect 24
to 24
find 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
a 24
case 24
which 24
while 24
as 24
such 24
it 24
depends 24
only 24
on 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
nature 24
yet 24
admits 24
of 24
the 24
application 24
to 24
it 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
freedom 24
and 24
to 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
apply 24
the 24
supersensible 24
idea 24
of 24
the 24
morally 24
good 24
which 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
exhibited 24
in 24
it 24
in 24
concreto 24
thus 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
is 24
subject 24
to 24
the 24
same 24
difficulties 24
as 24
that 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
the 24
latter 24
however 24
had 24
means 24
at 24
hand 24
of 24
escaping 24
from 24
these 24
difficulties 24
because 24
in 24
regard 24
to 24
the 24
theoretical 24
employment 24
intuitions 24
were 24
required 24
to 24
which 24
pure 24
concepts 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
could 24
be 24
applied 24
and 24
such 24
intuitions 24
though 24
only 24
of 24
objects 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
can 24
be 24
given 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
far 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
union 24
of 24
the 24
manifold 24
in 24
them 24
conforming 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
a 24

concepts 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
as 24
schemata 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
the 24
morally 24
good 24
is 24
something 24
whose 24
object 24
is 24
supersensible 24
for 24
which 24
therefore 24
nothing 24
corresponding 24
can 24
be 24
found 24
in 24
any 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
judgement 24
depending 24
on 24
laws 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
seems 24
therefore 24
to 24
be 24
subject 24
to 24
special 24
difficulties 24
arising 24
from 24
this 24
that 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
freedom 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
applied 24
to 24
actions 24
which 24
are 24
events 24
taking 24
place 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
and 24
which 24
so 24
far 24
belong 24
to 24
physical 24
nature 24
but 24
here 24
again 24
is 24
opened 24
a 24
favourable 24
prospect 24
for 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
judgement 24
when 24
i 24
subsume 24
under 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
an 24
action 24
possible 24
to 24
me 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
i 24
am 24
not 24
concerned 24
with 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
as 24
an 24
event 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
this 24
is 24
a 24
matter 24
that 24
belongs 24
to 24
the 24
decision 24
of 24
reason 24
in 24
its 24
theoretic 24
use 24
according 24
to 24
the 24

which 24
is 24
sketched 24
by 24
transcendental 24
imagination 24
here 24
however 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
do 24
not 24

the 24
schema 24
of 24
a 24

therefore 24
a 24

this 24
ask 24
yourself 24
whether 24
if 24
the 24
action 24
you 24
propose 24
were 24

take 24

by 24
a 24

of 24
which 24
you 24
were 24
yourself 24
a 24
part 24
you 24
could 24
regard 24
it 24
as 24
possible 24
by 24
your 24
own 24
will 24
everyone 24
does 24
in 24
fact 24
decide 24
by 24
this 24
rule 24
whether 24
actions 24
are 24
morally 24
good 24
or 24
evil 24
thus 24
people 24
say 24
if 24
everyone 24
permitted 24
himself 24
to 24
deceive 24
when 24
he 24
thought 24
it 24
to 24
his 24
advantage 24
or 24
thought 24
himself 24
justified 24
in 24
shortening 24
his 24
life 24
as 24
soon 24
as 24
he 24
was 24
thoroughly 24
weary 24
of 24
it 24
or 24
looked 24
with 24
perfect 24
indifference 24
on 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
others 24
and 24
if 24
you 24
belonged 24
to 24
such 24
an 24
order 24
of 24
things 24
would 24
you 24
do 24
so 24
with 24
the 24
assent 24
of 24
your 24
own 24
will 24
now 24
everyone 24
knows 24
well 24
that 24
if 24
he 24
secretly 24
allows 24
himself 24
to 24
deceive 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
follow 24
that 24
everyone 24
else 24
does 24
so 24
or 24
if 24
unobserved 24
he 24
is 24
destitute 24
of 24
compassion 24
others 24
would 24
not 24
necessarily 24
be 24
so 24
to 24
him 24
hence 24
this 24
comparison 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
of 24
his 24
actions 24
with 24
a 24
universal 24
law 24
of 24
nature 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
his 24
will 24
such 24
a 24
law 24
is 24
nevertheless 24
a 24
type 24
of 24
the 24
estimation 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
on 24
moral 24
principles 24
if 24
the 24
maxim 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
is 24
not 24
such 24
as 24
to 24
stand 24

of 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
a 24
universal 24
law 24
of 24
nature 24
then 24
it 24
is 24
morally 24
impossible 24
this 24
is 24

befitting 24
the 24

only 24
what 24
pure 24

also 24
conceive 24

conversely 24
be 24

the 24
caution 24
against 24

is 24
much 24
more 24

quite 24
reconcilable 24
with 24
the 24
purity 24
and 24
sublimity 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
besides 24
it 24
is 24
not 24

the 24
danger 24
on 24
this 24
side 24
is 24
not 24
so 24
general 24
empiricism 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
cuts 24
up 24
at 24
the 24
roots 24
the 24
morality 24
of 24
intentions 24
in 24
which 24

not 24

only 24

to 24
give 24
to 24
themselves 24

substitutes 24
for 24
duty 24
something 24
quite 24
different 24
namely 24
an 24
empirical 24

determine 24
the 24
will 24
if 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
takes 24
place 24
in 24
conformity 24
indeed 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
but 24
only 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
a 24
feeling 24
no 24
matter 24
of 24
what 24
kind 24
which 24
has 24
to 24
be 24
presupposed 24
in 24
order 24
that 24
the 24
law 24
may 24
be 24
sufficient 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
therefore 24
not 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
then 24
the 24
action 24
will 24
possess 24
legality 24
but 24
not 24
morality 24
now 24
if 24
we 24
understand 24
by 24
motive 24
elater 24
animi 24
the 24
subjective 24
ground 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
whose 24
reason 24
does 24
not 24
necessarily 24
conform 24
to 24
the 24
objective 24
law 24
by 24
virtue 24
of 24
its 24
own 24
nature 24
then 24
it 24
will 24
follow 24
first 24
that 24
not 24
motives 24
can 24
be 24
attributed 24
to 24
the 24
divine 24
will 24
and 24
that 24
the 24
motives 24
of 24
the 24
human 24
will 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
that 24
of 24
every 24
created 24
rational 24
being 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
anything 24
else 24
than 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
consequently 24
that 24
the 24
objective 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
must 24
always 24
and 24
alone 24
be 24
also 24
the 24
subjectively 24
sufficient 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
if 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
merely 24
to 24
fulfil 24
the 24
letter 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
without 24
containing 24
its 24
spirit 24
we 24
may 24
say 24
of 24
every 24
action 24
that 24
conforms 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
but 24
is 24
not 24
done 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
morally 24
good 24
in 24
the 24
letter 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
spirit 24
the 24
intention 24
since 24
then 24
for 24
the 24
purpose 24
of 24
giving 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
influence 24
over 24
the 24
will 24
we 24
must 24
not 24
seek 24
for 24
any 24
other 24
motives 24
that 24
might 24
enable 24
us 24
to 24
dispense 24
with 24
the 24
motive 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
because 24
that 24
would 24
produce 24
mere 24
hypocrisy 24
without 24
consistency 24
and 24
it 24
is 24
even 24
dangerous 24
to 24
allow 24
other 24
motives 24
for 24
instance 24
that 24
of 24
interest 24
even 24
to 24
cooperate 24
along 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
hence 24
nothing 24
is 24
left 24
us 24
but 24
to 24
determine 24
carefully 24
in 24
what 24
way 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
becomes 24
a 24
motive 24
and 24
what 24
effect 24
this 24
has 24
upon 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
for 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
question 24
how 24
a 24
law 24
can 24
be 24
directly 24
and 24
of 24
itself 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
essence 24
of 24
morality 24
this 24
is 24
for 24
human 24
reason 24
an 24
insoluble 24
problem 24
and 24
identical 24
with 24
the 24
question 24
how 24
a 24
free 24
will 24
is 24
possible 24
therefore 24
what 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
show 24
a 24
priori 24
is 24
not 24
why 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
in 24
itself 24
supplies 24
a 24
motive 24
but 24
what 24
effect 24
it 24
as 24
such 24
produces 24
or 24
more 24
correctly 24
speaking 24
must 24
produce 24
on 24
the 24
mind 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
the 24
essential 24
point 24
in 24
every 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
that 24
being 24
a 24
free 24
will 24
it 24
is 24
determined 24
simply 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
not 24
only 24
without 24
the 24
cooperation 24
of 24
sensible 24
impulses 24
but 24
even 24
to 24
the 24
rejection 24
of 24
all 24
such 24
and 24
to 24
the 24
checking 24
of 24
all 24
inclinations 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
might 24
be 24
opposed 24
to 24
that 24
law 24
so 24
far 24
then 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
motive 24
is 24
only 24
negative 24
and 24
this 24
motive 24
can 24
be 24
known 24
a 24
priori 24
to 24
be 24
such 24
for 24
all 24
inclination 24
and 24
every 24
sensible 24
impulse 24
is 24
founded 24
on 24
feeling 24
and 24
the 24
negative 24
effect 24
produced 24
on 24
feeling 24
by 24
the 24
check 24
on 24
the 24
inclinations 24
is 24
itself 24
feeling 24
consequently 24
we 24
can 24
see 24
a 24
priori 24
that 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
must 24
by 24
thwarting 24
all 24
our 24
inclinations 24
produce 24
a 24
feeling 24
which 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
pain 24
and 24
in 24
this 24
we 24
have 24
the 24
first 24
perhaps 24
the 24
only 24
instance 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
able 24
from 24
a 24
priori 24
considerations 24
to 24
determine 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
a 24
cognition 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
to 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
or 24
displeasure 24
all 24
the 24
inclinations 24
together 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
reduced 24
to 24
a 24
tolerable 24
system 24
in 24
which 24
case 24
their 24
satisfaction 24
is 24
called 24
happiness 24
constitute 24
selfregard 24
solipsismus 24
this 24
is 24
either 24
the 24
selflove 24
that 24
consists 24
in 24
an 24
excessive 24
fondness 24
for 24
oneself 24
philautia 24
or 24
satisfaction 24
with 24
oneself 24
arrogantia 24
the 24
former 24
is 24
called 24
particularly 24
selfishness 24
the 24
latter 24
selfconceit 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
only 24
checks 24
selfishness 24
looking 24
on 24
it 24
as 24
natural 24
and 24
active 24
in 24
us 24
even 24
prior 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
to 24
limit 24
it 24
to 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
agreement 24
with 24
this 24
law 24
and 24
then 24
it 24
is 24
called 24
rational 24
selflove 24
but 24
selfconceit 24
reason 24
strikes 24
down 24
altogether 24
since 24
all 24
claims 24
to 24
selfesteem 24
which 24
precede 24
agreement 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
are 24
vain 24
and 24
unjustifiable 24
for 24
the 24
certainty 24
of 24
a 24
state 24
of 24
mind 24
that 24
coincides 24
with 24
this 24
law 24
is 24
the 24
first 24
condition 24
of 24
personal 24
worth 24
as 24
we 24
shall 24
presently 24
show 24
more 24
clearly 24
and 24
prior 24
to 24
this 24
conformity 24
any 24
pretension 24
to 24
worth 24
is 24
false 24
and 24
unlawful 24
now 24
the 24
propensity 24
to 24
selfesteem 24
is 24
one 24
of 24
the 24
inclinations 24
which 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
checks 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
that 24
esteem 24
rests 24
only 24
on 24
morality 24
therefore 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
breaks 24
down 24
selfconceit 24
but 24
as 24
this 24
law 24
is 24
something 24
positive 24
in 24
itself 24
namely 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
an 24
intellectual 24
causality 24
that 24
is 24
of 24
freedom 24
it 24
must 24
be 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
respect 24
for 24
by 24
opposing 24
the 24
subjective 24
antagonism 24
of 24
the 24
inclinations 24
it 24
weakens 24
selfconceit 24
and 24
since 24
it 24
even 24
breaks 24
down 24
that 24
is 24
humiliates 24
this 24
conceit 24
it 24
is 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
highest 24
respect 24
and 24
consequently 24
is 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
a 24
positive 24
feeling 24
which 24
is 24
not 24
of 24
empirical 24
origin 24
but 24
is 24
known 24
a 24
priori 24
therefore 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
a 24
feeling 24
which 24
is 24
produced 24
by 24
an 24
intellectual 24
cause 24
and 24
this 24
feeling 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
one 24
that 24
we 24
know 24
quite 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
perceive 24
in 24
the 24
preceding 24
chapter 24
we 24
have 24
seen 24
that 24
everything 24
that 24
presents 24
itself 24
as 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
prior 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
by 24
that 24
law 24
itself 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
supreme 24
condition 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
excluded 24
from 24
the 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
called 24
the 24
unconditionally 24
good 24
and 24
that 24
the 24
mere 24
practical 24
form 24
which 24
consists 24
in 24
the 24
adaptation 24
of 24
the 24
maxims 24
to 24
universal 24
legislation 24
first 24
determines 24
what 24
is 24
good 24
in 24
itself 24
and 24
absolutely 24
and 24
is 24
the 24
basis 24
of 24
the 24
maxims 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
will 24
which 24
alone 24
is 24
good 24
in 24
every 24
respect 24
however 24
we 24
find 24
that 24
our 24
nature 24
as 24
sensible 24
beings 24
is 24
such 24
that 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
desire 24
objects 24
of 24
inclination 24
whether 24
of 24
hope 24
or 24
fear 24
first 24
presents 24
itself 24
to 24
us 24
and 24
our 24
pathologically 24
affected 24
self 24
although 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
its 24
maxims 24
quite 24
unfit 24
for 24
universal 24
legislation 24
yet 24
just 24
as 24
if 24
it 24
constituted 24
our 24
entire 24
self 24
strives 24
to 24
put 24
its 24
pretensions 24
forward 24
first 24
and 24
to 24
have 24
them 24
acknowledged 24
as 24
the 24
first 24
and 24
original 24
this 24
propensity 24
to 24
make 24
ourselves 24
in 24
the 24
subjective 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
our 24
choice 24
serve 24
as 24
the 24
objective 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
generally 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
selflove 24
and 24
if 24
this 24
pretends 24
to 24
be 24
legislative 24
as 24
an 24
unconditional 24
practical 24
principle 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
selfconceit 24
now 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
alone 24
is 24
truly 24
objective 24
namely 24
in 24
every 24
respect 24
entirely 24
excludes 24
the 24
influence 24
of 24
selflove 24
on 24
the 24
supreme 24
practical 24
principle 24
and 24
indefinitely 24
checks 24
the 24
selfconceit 24
that 24
prescribes 24
the 24
subjective 24
conditions 24
of 24
the 24
former 24
as 24
laws 24
now 24
whatever 24
checks 24
our 24
selfconceit 24
in 24
our 24
own 24
judgement 24
humiliates 24
therefore 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
inevitably 24
humbles 24
every 24
man 24
when 24
he 24
compares 24
with 24
it 24
the 24
physical 24
propensities 24
of 24
his 24
nature 24
that 24
the 24
idea 24
of 24
which 24
as 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
our 24
will 24
humbles 24
us 24
in 24
our 24
selfconsciousness 24
awakes 24
respect 24
for 24
itself 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
itself 24
positive 24
and 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
therefore 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
even 24
subjectively 24
a 24
cause 24
of 24
respect 24
now 24
since 24
everything 24
that 24
enters 24
into 24
selflove 24
belongs 24
to 24
inclination 24
and 24
all 24
inclination 24
rests 24
on 24
feelings 24
and 24
consequently 24
whatever 24
checks 24
all 24
the 24
feelings 24
together 24
in 24
selflove 24
has 24
necessarily 24
by 24
this 24
very 24
circumstance 24
an 24
influence 24
on 24
feeling 24
hence 24
we 24
comprehend 24
how 24
it 24
is 24
possible 24
to 24
perceive 24
a 24
priori 24
that 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
can 24
produce 24
an 24
effect 24
on 24
feeling 24
in 24
that 24
it 24
excludes 24
the 24
inclinations 24
and 24
the 24
propensity 24
to 24
make 24
them 24
the 24
supreme 24
practical 24
condition 24
ie 24
selflove 24
from 24
all 24
participation 24
in 24
the 24
supreme 24
legislation 24
this 24
effect 24
is 24
on 24
one 24
side 24
merely 24
negative 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
side 24
relatively 24
to 24
the 24
restricting 24
principle 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
positive 24
no 24
special 24
kind 24
of 24
feeling 24
need 24
be 24
assumed 24
for 24
this 24
under 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
a 24
practical 24
or 24
moral 24
feeling 24
as 24
antecedent 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
serving 24
as 24
its 24
foundation 24
the 24
negative 24
effect 24
on 24
feeling 24
unpleasantness 24
is 24
pathological 24
like 24
every 24
influence 24
on 24
feeling 24
and 24
like 24
every 24
feeling 24
generally 24
but 24
as 24
an 24
effect 24
of 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
consequently 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
a 24
supersensible 24
cause 24
namely 24
the 24
subject 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
supreme 24
lawgiver 24
this 24
feeling 24
of 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24
affected 24
by 24
inclinations 24
is 24
called 24
humiliation 24
intellectual 24
selfdepreciation 24
but 24
with 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
positive 24
source 24
of 24
this 24
humiliation 24
the 24
law 24
it 24
is 24
respect 24
for 24
it 24
there 24
is 24
indeed 24
no 24
feeling 24
for 24
this 24
law 24
but 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
it 24
removes 24
the 24
resistance 24
out 24
of 24
the 24
way 24
this 24
removal 24
of 24
an 24
obstacle 24
is 24
in 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
reason 24
esteemed 24
equivalent 24
to 24
a 24
positive 24
help 24
to 24
its 24
causality 24
therefore 24
this 24
feeling 24
may 24
also 24
be 24
called 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
for 24
both 24
reasons 24
together 24
a 24
moral 24
feeling 24
while 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
therefore 24
is 24
a 24
formal 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
action 24
by 24
practical 24
pure 24
reason 24
and 24
is 24
moreover 24
a 24
material 24
though 24
only 24
objective 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
action 24
as 24
called 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
it 24
is 24
also 24
a 24
subjective 24
determining 24
principle 24
that 24
is 24
a 24
motive 24
to 24
this 24
action 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
it 24
has 24
influence 24
on 24
the 24
morality 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
and 24
produces 24
a 24
feeling 24
conducive 24
to 24
the 24
influence 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
on 24
the 24
will 24
there 24
is 24
here 24
in 24
the 24
subject 24
no 24
antecedent 24
feeling 24
tending 24
to 24
morality 24
for 24
this 24
is 24
impossible 24
since 24
every 24
feeling 24
is 24
sensible 24
and 24
the 24
motive 24
of 24
moral 24
intention 24
must 24
be 24
free 24
from 24
all 24
sensible 24
conditions 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
while 24
the 24
sensible 24
feeling 24
which 24
is 24
at 24
the 24
bottom 24
of 24
all 24
our 24
inclinations 24
is 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
that 24
impression 24
which 24
we 24
call 24
respect 24
the 24
cause 24
that 24
determines 24
it 24
lies 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
this 24
impression 24
therefore 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
its 24
origin 24
must 24
be 24
called 24
not 24
a 24
pathological 24
but 24
a 24
practical 24
effect 24
for 24
by 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
deprives 24
selflove 24
of 24
its 24
influence 24
and 24
selfconceit 24
of 24
its 24
illusion 24
it 24
lessens 24
the 24
obstacle 24
to 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
produces 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
superiority 24
of 24
its 24
objective 24
law 24
to 24
the 24
impulses 24
of 24
the 24
sensibility 24
and 24
thus 24
by 24
removing 24
the 24
counterpoise 24
it 24
gives 24
relatively 24
greater 24
weight 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
in 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
reason 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
a 24
will 24
affected 24
by 24
the 24
aforesaid 24
impulses 24
thus 24
the 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
motive 24
to 24
morality 24
but 24
is 24
morality 24
itself 24
subjectively 24
considered 24
as 24
a 24
motive 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
by 24
rejecting 24
all 24
the 24
rival 24
pretensions 24
of 24
selflove 24
gives 24
authority 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
which 24
now 24
alone 24
has 24
influence 24
now 24
it 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
observed 24
that 24
as 24
respect 24
is 24
an 24
effect 24
on 24
feeling 24
and 24
therefore 24
on 24
the 24
sensibility 24
of 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24
it 24
presupposes 24
this 24
sensibility 24
and 24
therefore 24
also 24
the 24
finiteness 24
of 24
such 24
beings 24
on 24
whom 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
imposes 24
respect 24
and 24
that 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
cannot 24
be 24
attributed 24
to 24
a 24
supreme 24
being 24
or 24
to 24
any 24
being 24
free 24
from 24
all 24
sensibility 24
in 24
whom 24
therefore 24
this 24
sensibility 24
cannot 24
be 24
an 24
obstacle 24
to 24
practical 24
reason 24
this 24
feeling 24
which 24
we 24
call 24
the 24
moral 24
feeling 24
is 24
therefore 24
produced 24
simply 24
by 24
reason 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
serve 24
for 24
the 24
estimation 24
of 24
actions 24
nor 24
for 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
the 24
objective 24
moral 24
law 24
itself 24
but 24
merely 24
as 24
a 24
motive 24
to 24
make 24
this 24
of 24
itself 24
a 24
maxim 24
but 24
what 24
name 24
could 24
we 24
more 24
suitably 24
apply 24
to 24
this 24
singular 24
feeling 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
compared 24
to 24
any 24
pathological 24
feeling 24
it 24
is 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
peculiar 24
kind 24
that 24
it 24
seems 24
to 24
be 24
at 24
the 24
disposal 24
of 24
reason 24
only 24
and 24
that 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
respect 24
applies 24
always 24
to 24
persons 24
only 24
not 24
to 24
things 24
the 24
latter 24
may 24
arouse 24
inclination 24
and 24
if 24
they 24
are 24
animals 24
eg 24
horses 24
dogs 24
etc 24
even 24
love 24
or 24
fear 24
like 24
the 24
sea 24
a 24
volcano 24
a 24
beast 24
of 24
prey 24
but 24
never 24
respect 24
something 24
that 24
comes 24
nearer 24
to 24
this 24
feeling 24
is 24
admiration 24
and 24
this 24
as 24
an 24
affection 24
astonishment 24
can 24
apply 24
to 24
things 24
also 24
eg 24
lofty 24
mountains 24
the 24
magnitude 24
number 24
and 24
distance 24
of 24
the 24
heavenly 24
bodies 24
the 24
strength 24
and 24
swiftness 24
of 24
many 24
animals 24
etc 24
but 24
all 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
respect 24
a 24
man 24
also 24
may 24
be 24
an 24
object 24
to 24
me 24
of 24
love 24
fear 24
or 24
admiration 24
even 24
to 24
astonishment 24
and 24
yet 24
not 24
be 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
respect 24
his 24
jocose 24
humour 24
his 24
courage 24
and 24
strength 24
his 24
power 24
from 24
the 24
rank 24
be 24
has 24
amongst 24
others 24
may 24
inspire 24
me 24
with 24
sentiments 24
of 24
this 24
kind 24
but 24
still 24
inner 24
respect 24
for 24
him 24
is 24
wanting 24
fontenelle 24
says 24
i 24
bow 24
before 24
a 24
great 24
man 24
but 24
my 24
mind 24
does 24
not 24
bow 24
i 24
would 24
add 24
before 24
an 24
humble 24
plain 24
man 24
in 24
whom 24
i 24
perceive 24
uprightness 24
of 24
character 24
in 24
a 24
higher 24
degree 24
than 24
i 24
am 24
conscious 24
of 24
in 24
myself 24
my 24
mind 24
bows 24
whether 24
i 24
choose 24
it 24
or 24
not 24
and 24
though 24
i 24
bear 24
my 24
head 24
never 24
so 24
high 24
that 24
he 24
may 24
not 24
forget 24
my 24
superior 24
rank 24
why 24
is 24
this 24
because 24
his 24
example 24
exhibits 24
to 24
me 24
a 24
law 24
that 24
humbles 24
my 24
selfconceit 24
when 24
i 24
compare 24
it 24
with 24
my 24
conduct 24
a 24
law 24
the 24
practicability 24
of 24
obedience 24
to 24
which 24
i 24
see 24
proved 24
by 24
fact 24
before 24
my 24
eyes 24
now 24
i 24
may 24
even 24
be 24
conscious 24
of 24
a 24
like 24
degree 24
of 24
uprightness 24
and 24
yet 24
the 24
respect 24
remains 24
for 24
since 24
in 24
man 24
all 24
good 24
is 24
defective 24
the 24
law 24
made 24
visible 24
by 24
an 24
example 24
still 24
humbles 24
my 24
pride 24
my 24
standard 24
being 24
furnished 24
by 24
a 24
man 24
whose 24
imperfections 24
whatever 24
they 24
may 24
be 24
are 24
not 24
known 24
to 24
me 24
as 24
my 24
own 24
are 24
and 24
who 24
therefore 24
appears 24
to 24
me 24
in 24
a 24
more 24
favourable 24
light 24
respect 24
is 24
a 24
tribute 24
which 24
we 24
cannot 24
refuse 24
to 24
merit 24
whether 24
we 24
will 24
or 24
not 24
we 24
may 24
indeed 24
outwardly 24
withhold 24
it 24
but 24
we 24
cannot 24
help 24
feeling 24
it 24
inwardly 24
respect 24
is 24
so 24
far 24
from 24
being 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
that 24
we 24
only 24
reluctantly 24
give 24
way 24
to 24
it 24
as 24
regards 24
a 24
man 24
we 24
try 24
to 24
find 24
out 24
something 24
that 24
may 24
lighten 24
the 24
burden 24
of 24
it 24
some 24
fault 24
to 24
compensate 24
us 24
for 24
the 24
humiliation 24
which 24
such 24
which 24
such 24
an 24
example 24

even 24
the 24
dead 24
are 24
not 24
always 24
secure 24
from 24
this 24
criticism 24
especially 24
if 24
their 24
example 24
appears 24
inimitable 24
even 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
itself 24
in 24
its 24
solemn 24
majesty 24
is 24
exposed 24
to 24
this 24
endeavour 24
to 24
save 24
oneself 24
from 24
yielding 24
it 24
respect 24
can 24
it 24
be 24
thought 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
for 24
any 24
other 24
reason 24
that 24
we 24
are 24
so 24
ready 24
to 24
reduce 24
it 24
to 24
the 24
level 24
of 24
our 24
familiar 24
inclination 24
or 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
for 24
any 24
other 24
reason 24
that 24
we 24
all 24
take 24
such 24
trouble 24
to 24
make 24
it 24
out 24
to 24
be 24
the 24
chosen 24
precept 24
of 24
our 24
own 24
interest 24
well 24
understood 24
but 24
that 24
we 24
want 24
to 24
be 24
free 24
from 24
the 24
deterrent 24
respect 24
which 24
shows 24
us 24
our 24
own 24
unworthiness 24
with 24
such 24
severity 24
nevertheless 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
so 24
little 24
is 24
there 24
pain 24
in 24
it 24
that 24
if 24
once 24
one 24
has 24
laid 24
aside 24
selfconceit 24
and 24
allowed 24
practical 24
influence 24
to 24
that 24
respect 24
he 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
satisfied 24
with 24
contemplating 24
the 24
majesty 24
of 24
this 24
law 24
and 24
the 24
soul 24
believes 24
itself 24
elevated 24
in 24
proportion 24
as 24
it 24
sees 24
the 24
holy 24
law 24
elevated 24
above 24
it 24
and 24
its 24
frail 24
nature 24
no 24
doubt 24
great 24
talents 24
and 24
activity 24
proportioned 24
to 24
them 24
may 24
also 24
occasion 24
respect 24
or 24
an 24
analogous 24
feeling 24
it 24
is 24
very 24
proper 24
to 24
yield 24
it 24
to 24
them 24
and 24
then 24
it 24
appears 24
as 24
if 24
this 24
sentiment 24
were 24
the 24
same 24
thing 24
as 24
admiration 24
but 24
if 24
we 24
look 24
closer 24
we 24
shall 24
observe 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
always 24
uncertain 24
how 24
much 24
of 24
the 24
ability 24
is 24
due 24
to 24
native 24
talent 24
and 24
how 24
much 24
to 24
diligence 24
in 24
cultivating 24
it 24
reason 24
represents 24
it 24
to 24
us 24
as 24
probably 24
the 24
fruit 24
of 24
cultivation 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
meritorious 24
and 24
this 24
notably 24
reduces 24
our 24
selfconceit 24
and 24
either 24
casts 24
a 24
reproach 24
on 24
us 24
or 24
urges 24
us 24
to 24
follow 24
such 24
an 24
example 24
in 24
the 24
way 24
that 24
is 24
suitable 24
to 24
us 24
this 24
respect 24
then 24
which 24
we 24
show 24
to 24
such 24
a 24
person 24
properly 24
speaking 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
that 24
his 24
example 24
exhibits 24
is 24
not 24
mere 24
admiration 24
and 24
this 24
is 24
confirmed 24
also 24
by 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
when 24
the 24
common 24
run 24
of 24
admirers 24
think 24
they 24
have 24
learned 24
from 24
any 24
source 24
the 24
badness 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
mans 24
character 24
for 24
instance 24
voltaires 24
they 24
give 24
up 24
all 24
respect 24
for 24
him 24
whereas 24
the 24
true 24
scholar 24
still 24
feels 24
it 24
at 24
least 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
his 24
talents 24
because 24
he 24
is 24
himself 24
engaged 24
in 24
a 24
business 24
and 24
a 24
vocation 24
which 24
make 24
imitation 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
man 24
in 24
some 24
degree 24
a 24
law 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
therefore 24
the 24
only 24
and 24
the 24
undoubted 24
moral 24
motive 24
and 24
this 24
feeling 24
is 24
directed 24
to 24
no 24
object 24
except 24
on 24
the 24
ground 24
of 24
this 24
law 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
first 24
determines 24
the 24
will 24
objectively 24
and 24
directly 24
in 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
reason 24
and 24
freedom 24
whose 24
causality 24
can 24
be 24
determined 24
only 24
by 24
the 24
law 24
consists 24
just 24
in 24
this 24
that 24
it 24
restricts 24
all 24
inclinations 24
and 24
consequently 24
selfesteem 24
by 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
obedience 24
to 24
its 24
pure 24
law 24
this 24
restriction 24
now 24
has 24
an 24
effect 24
on 24
feeling 24
and 24
produces 24
the 24
impression 24
of 24
displeasure 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
known 24
a 24
priori 24
from 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
so 24
far 24
only 24
a 24
negative 24
effect 24
which 24
arising 24
from 24
the 24
influence 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
checks 24
the 24
activity 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
determined 24
by 24
inclinations 24
and 24
hence 24
checks 24
the 24
opinion 24
of 24
his 24
personal 24
worth 24
which 24
in 24
the 24
absence 24
of 24
agreement 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
reduced 24
to 24
nothing 24
hence 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
this 24
law 24
on 24
feeling 24
is 24
merely 24
humiliation 24
we 24
can 24
therefore 24
perceive 24
this 24
a 24
priori 24
but 24
cannot 24
know 24
by 24
it 24
the 24
force 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
motive 24
but 24
only 24
the 24
resistance 24
to 24
motives 24
of 24
the 24
sensibility 24
but 24
since 24
the 24
same 24
law 24
is 24
objectively 24
that 24
is 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
an 24
immediate 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
consequently 24
this 24
humiliation 24
takes 24
place 24
only 24
relatively 24
to 24
the 24
purity 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
hence 24
the 24
lowering 24
of 24
the 24
pretensions 24
of 24
moral 24
selfesteem 24
that 24
is 24
humiliation 24
on 24
the 24
sensible 24
side 24
is 24
an 24
elevation 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
ie 24
practical 24
esteem 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
on 24
the 24
intellectual 24
side 24
in 24
a 24
word 24
it 24
is 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
its 24
cause 24
is 24
intellectual 24
a 24
positive 24
feeling 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
known 24
a 24
priori 24
for 24
whatever 24
diminishes 24
the 24
obstacles 24
to 24
an 24
activity 24
furthers 24
this 24
activity 24
itself 24
now 24
the 24
recognition 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
an 24
activity 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
from 24
objective 24
principles 24
which 24
only 24
fails 24
to 24
reveal 24
its 24
effect 24
in 24
actions 24
because 24
subjective 24
pathological 24
causes 24
hinder 24
it 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
then 24
must 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
a 24
positive 24
though 24
indirect 24
effect 24
of 24
it 24
on 24
feeling 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
this 24
respect 24
weakens 24
the 24
impeding 24
influence 24
of 24
inclinations 24
by 24
humiliating 24
selfesteem 24
and 24
hence 24
also 24
as 24
a 24
subjective 24
principle 24
of 24
activity 24
that 24
is 24
as 24
a 24
motive 24
to 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
and 24
as 24
a 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
maxims 24
of 24
a 24
life 24
conformable 24
to 24
it 24
from 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
a 24
motive 24
arises 24
that 24
of 24
an 24
interest 24
which 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
attributed 24
to 24
any 24
being 24
unless 24
it 24
possesses 24
reason 24
and 24
which 24
signifies 24
a 24
motive 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
conceived 24
by 24
the 24
reason 24
since 24
in 24
a 24
morally 24
good 24
will 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
motive 24
the 24
moral 24
interest 24
is 24
a 24
pure 24
interest 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
alone 24
independent 24
of 24
sense 24
on 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
an 24
interest 24
is 24
based 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
maxim 24
this 24
therefore 24
is 24
morally 24
good 24
only 24
in 24
case 24
it 24
rests 24
simply 24
on 24
the 24
interest 24
taken 24
in 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
all 24
three 24
notions 24
however 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
motive 24
of 24
an 24
interest 24
and 24
of 24
a 24
maxim 24
can 24
be 24
applied 24
only 24
to 24
finite 24
beings 24
for 24
they 24
all 24
suppose 24
a 24
limitation 24
of 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
the 24
being 24
in 24
that 24
the 24
subjective 24
character 24
of 24
his 24
choice 24
does 24
not 24
of 24
itself 24
agree 24
with 24
the 24
objective 24
law 24
of 24
a 24
practical 24
reason 24
they 24
suppose 24
that 24
the 24
being 24
requires 24
to 24
be 24
impelled 24
to 24
action 24
by 24
something 24
because 24
an 24
internal 24
obstacle 24
opposes 24
itself 24
therefore 24
they 24
cannot 24
be 24
applied 24
to 24
the 24
divine 24
will 24
there 24
is 24
something 24
so 24
singular 24
in 24
the 24
unbounded 24
esteem 24
for 24
the 24
pure 24
moral 24
law 24
apart 24
from 24
all 24
advantage 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
presented 24
for 24
our 24
obedience 24
by 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
voice 24
of 24
which 24
makes 24
even 24
the 24
boldest 24
sinner 24
tremble 24
and 24
compels 24
him 24
to 24
hide 24
himself 24
from 24
it 24
that 24
we 24
cannot 24
wonder 24
if 24
we 24
find 24
this 24
influence 24
of 24
a 24
mere 24
intellectual 24
idea 24
on 24
the 24
feelings 24
quite 24
incomprehensible 24
to 24
speculative 24
reason 24
and 24
have 24
to 24
be 24
satisfied 24
with 24
seeing 24
so 24
much 24
of 24
this 24
a 24
priori 24
that 24
such 24
a 24
feeling 24
is 24
inseparably 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
in 24
every 24
finite 24
rational 24
being 24
if 24
this 24
feeling 24
of 24
respect 24
were 24
pathological 24
and 24
therefore 24
were 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
based 24
on 24
the 24
inner 24
sense 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
in 24
vain 24
to 24
try 24
to 24
discover 24
a 24
connection 24
of 24
it 24
with 24
any 24
idea 24
a 24
priori 24
but 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
feeling 24
that 24
applies 24
merely 24
to 24
what 24
is 24
practical 24
and 24
depends 24
on 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
a 24
law 24
simply 24
as 24
to 24
its 24
form 24
not 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
any 24
object 24
and 24
therefore 24
cannot 24
be 24
reckoned 24
either 24
as 24
pleasure 24
or 24
pain 24
and 24
yet 24
produces 24
an 24
interest 24
in 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
which 24
we 24
call 24
the 24
moral 24
interest 24
just 24
as 24
the 24
capacity 24
of 24

the 24

only 24
by 24
our 24

is 24
respect 24

the 24

the 24
law 24

this 24

it 24

clearly 24
no 24
other 24
than 24
the 24
moral 24
for 24
no 24
other 24
precludes 24
all 24

from 24
exercising 24
any 24
direct 24
influence 24
on 24
the 24

is 24
objectively 24

the 24
exclusion 24

this 24
by 24
reason 24
of 24
that 24

includes 24
in 24
its 24
concept 24
practical 24
obligation 24
that 24

feeling 24
that 24
arises 24
from 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
this 24

is 24
not 24
pathological 24
as 24
would 24
be 24
a 24
feeling 24
produced 24
by 24
an 24

senses 24

practical 24
only 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
is 24
made 24
possible 24
by 24
a 24
preceding 24
objective 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24

a 24
causality 24
of 24
the 24
reason 24
as 24
submission 24
to 24
the 24

therefore 24
that 24
is 24
as 24
a 24

announcing 24

for 24
the 24
sensibly 24
affected 24
subject 24
it 24

merely 24
by 24
the 24

something 24

about 24
by 24

through 24

the 24

in 24
the 24

objectively 24
agreement 24

the 24

it 24
has 24
been 24
already 24
laid 24
down 24
we 24
shall 24
perceive 24
that 24
it 24
always 24
rests 24
on 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
a 24
duty 24

an 24
example 24

us 24

can 24
never 24
have 24
any 24

a 24
moral 24
ground 24

that 24
it 24

very 24
good 24

even 24
in 24
a 24
psychological 24

the 24

already 24

thy 24
neighbour 24
as 24
thyself 24

requires 24
respect 24

a 24

commands 24
love 24

it 24
to 24
our 24
own 24
arbitrary 24

however 24
considered 24

impossible 24

command 24
therefore 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
practical 24
love 24
that 24
is 24
meant 24
in 24
that 24
pith 24
of 24
all 24
laws 24
to 24
love 24
god 24
means 24
in 24
this 24
sense 24
to 24
like 24
to 24
do 24
his 24
commandments 24
to 24
love 24
ones 24
neighbour 24
means 24
to 24
like 24
to 24
practise 24
all 24
duties 24
towards 24
him 24
but 24
the 24
command 24
that 24
makes 24
this 24
a 24
rule 24
cannot 24
command 24
us 24
to 24
have 24
this 24
disposition 24
in 24
actions 24
conformed 24
to 24
duty 24
but 24
only 24
to 24
endeavour 24
after 24
it 24
for 24
a 24
command 24
to 24
like 24
to 24
do 24
a 24
thing 24
is 24
in 24
itself 24
contradictory 24
because 24
if 24
we 24
already 24
know 24
of 24
ourselves 24
what 24
we 24
are 24
bound 24
to 24
do 24
and 24
if 24
further 24
we 24
are 24
conscious 24
of 24
liking 24
to 24
do 24
it 24
a 24
command 24
would 24
be 24
quite 24
needless 24
and 24
if 24
we 24
do 24
it 24
not 24
willingly 24
but 24
only 24
out 24
of 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
a 24
command 24
that 24
makes 24
this 24
respect 24
the 24
motive 24
of 24
our 24
maxim 24
would 24
directly 24
counteract 24
the 24
disposition 24
commanded 24
that 24
law 24
of 24
all 24
laws 24
therefore 24
like 24
all 24
the 24
moral 24
precepts 24
of 24
the 24
gospel 24
exhibits 24
the 24
moral 24
disposition 24
in 24
all 24
its 24
perfection 24
in 24
which 24
viewed 24
as 24
an 24
ideal 24
of 24
holiness 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
attainable 24
by 24
any 24
creature 24
but 24
yet 24
is 24
the 24
pattern 24
which 24
we 24
should 24
strive 24
to 24
approach 24
and 24
in 24
an 24
uninterrupted 24
but 24
infinite 24
progress 24
become 24
like 24
to 24
in 24
fact 24
if 24
a 24
rational 24
creature 24
could 24
ever 24
reach 24
this 24
point 24
that 24
he 24
thoroughly 24
likes 24
to 24
do 24
all 24
moral 24
laws 24
this 24
would 24
mean 24
that 24
there 24
does 24
not 24
exist 24
in 24
him 24
even 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
a 24
desire 24
that 24
would 24
tempt 24
him 24
to 24
deviate 24
from 24
them 24
for 24
to 24
overcome 24
such 24
a 24
desire 24
always 24
costs 24
the 24
subject 24
some 24
sacrifice 24
and 24
therefore 24
requires 24
selfcompulsion 24
that 24
is 24
inward 24
constraint 24
to 24
something 24
that 24
one 24
does 24
not 24
quite 24
like 24
to 24
do 24
and 24
no 24
creature 24
can 24
ever 24
reach 24
this 24
stage 24
of 24
moral 24
disposition 24
for 24
being 24
a 24
creature 24
and 24
therefore 24
always 24
dependent 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
what 24
be 24
requires 24
for 24
complete 24
satisfaction 24
he 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
quite 24
free 24
from 24
desires 24
and 24
inclinations 24
and 24
as 24
these 24
rest 24
on 24
physical 24
causes 24
they 24
can 24
never 24
of 24
themselves 24
coincide 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
the 24
sources 24
of 24
which 24
are 24
quite 24
different 24
and 24
therefore 24
they 24
make 24
it 24
necessary 24
to 24
found 24
the 24
mental 24
disposition 24
of 24
ones 24
maxims 24
on 24
moral 24
obligation 24
not 24
on 24
ready 24
inclination 24
but 24
on 24
respect 24
which 24
demands 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
even 24
though 24
one 24
may 24
not 24
like 24
it 24
not 24
on 24
love 24
which 24
apprehends 24
no 24
inward 24
reluctance 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
towards 24
the 24
law 24

latter 24
namely 24
love 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
which 24
would 24
then 24
cease 24
to 24
be 24
a 24
command 24
and 24
then 24
morality 24
which 24
would 24
have 24
passed 24
subjectively 24
into 24
holiness 24
would 24
cease 24
to 24
be 24
virtue 24

be 24

constant 24
though 24
unattainable 24
goal 24
of 24
his 24
endeavours 24
for 24
in 24
the 24
case 24
of 24
what 24
we 24
highly 24
esteem 24
but 24
yet 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
our 24
weakness 24
dread 24
the 24
increased 24
facility 24
of 24
satisfying 24
it 24
changes 24
the 24
most 24
reverential 24
awe 24
into 24
inclination 24
and 24
respect 24
into 24
love 24
at 24
least 24
this 24
would 24
be 24
the 24
perfection 24
of 24
a 24
disposition 24
devoted 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
if 24
it 24
were 24
possible 24
for 24
a 24
creature 24
to 24
attain 24
it 24
this 24
law 24
is 24
in 24
striking 24
contrast 24
with 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
which 24
some 24
make 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24

up 24

as 24
we 24
can 24
see 24
every 24
rational 24
creature 24

is 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24

disposition 24
that 24
he 24
ought 24

proper 24
moral 24
condition 24
in 24
which 24
he 24
can 24
always 24

perfect 24
purity 24
of 24
the 24
disposition 24

is 24
nothing 24

moral 24
fanaticism 24
and 24
exaggerated 24
selfconceit 24
that 24
is 24
infused 24
into 24
the 24
mind 24
by 24
exhortation 24
to 24
actions 24
as 24
noble 24
sublime 24
and 24
magnanimous 24
by 24
which 24
men 24
are 24
led 24
into 24
the 24
delusion 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
duty 24
that 24
is 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24

whose 24
yoke 24
an 24
easy 24
yoke 24
indeed 24
because 24
reason 24
itself 24
imposes 24
it 24
on 24
us 24
they 24
must 24
bear 24
whether 24
they 24
like 24
it 24

not 24
that 24
constitutes 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
their 24
actions 24
and 24
which 24
always 24
humbles 24
them 24
while 24
they 24
obey 24
it 24
fancying 24
that 24
those 24
actions 24
are 24
expected 24
from 24
them 24
not 24
from 24
duty 24
but 24
as 24
pure 24
merit 24
for 24
not 24
only 24
would 24
they 24
in 24
imitating 24
such 24
deeds 24
from 24
such 24
a 24
principle 24
not 24
have 24
fulfilled 24
the 24
spirit 24
of 24
the 24
law 24
in 24
the 24
least 24
which 24
consists 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
legality 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
without 24
regard 24
to 24
principle 24
but 24
in 24
the 24
subjection 24
of 24
the 24
mind 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
not 24
only 24
do 24
they 24
make 24
the 24
motives 24
pathological 24
seated 24
in 24
sympathy 24
or 24
selflove 24
not 24
moral 24
in 24
the 24
law 24
but 24
they 24
produce 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
a 24
vain 24
highflying 24
fantastic 24
way 24
of 24
thinking 24
flattering 24
themselves 24
with 24
a 24
spontaneous 24
goodness 24
of 24
heart 24
that 24
needs 24
neither 24
spur 24
nor 24
bridle 24
for 24
which 24
no 24
command 24
is 24
needed 24
and 24
thereby 24
forgetting 24
their 24
obligation 24
which 24
they 24
ought 24
to 24
think 24
of 24
rather 24
than 24
merit 24
indeed 24
actions 24
of 24
others 24
which 24
are 24
done 24
with 24
great 24
sacrifice 24
and 24
merely 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
duty 24
may 24
be 24
praised 24
as 24
noble 24
and 24
sublime 24
but 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
there 24
are 24
traces 24
which 24
suggest 24
that 24
they 24
were 24
done 24
wholly 24
out 24
of 24
respect 24
for 24
duty 24
and 24
not 24
from 24
excited 24
feelings 24
if 24
these 24
however 24
are 24
set 24
before 24
anyone 24
as 24
examples 24
to 24
be 24
imitated 24
respect 24
for 24
duty 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
true 24
moral 24
feeling 24
must 24
be 24
employed 24
as 24
the 24
motive 24
this 24
severe 24
holy 24
precept 24
which 24
never 24
allows 24
our 24
vain 24
selflove 24
to 24
dally 24
with 24
pathological 24
impulses 24
however 24
analogous 24
they 24
may 24
be 24
to 24
morality 24
and 24
to 24
take 24
a 24
pride 24
in 24
meritorious 24
worth 24
now 24
if 24
we 24
search 24
we 24
shall 24
find 24
for 24
all 24
actions 24
that 24
are 24
worthy 24
of 24
praise 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
duty 24
which 24
commands 24
and 24
does 24
not 24
leave 24
us 24
to 24
choose 24
what 24
may 24
be 24
agreeable 24
to 24
our 24
inclinations 24
this 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
way 24
of 24
representing 24
things 24
that 24
can 24
give 24
a 24
moral 24
training 24
to 24
the 24
soul 24
because 24
it 24
alone 24
is 24
capable 24
of 24
solid 24
and 24
accurately 24
defined 24
principles 24
if 24
fanaticism 24
in 24
its 24
most 24
general 24
sense 24
is 24
a 24
deliberate 24
over 24
stepping 24
of 24
the 24
limits 24
of 24
human 24
reason 24
then 24
moral 24
fanaticism 24
is 24
such 24
an 24
over 24
stepping 24
of 24
the 24
bounds 24
that 24
practical 24
pure 24
reason 24
sets 24
to 24
mankind 24
in 24
that 24
it 24
forbids 24
us 24
to 24
place 24
the 24
subjective 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
correct 24
actions 24
that 24
is 24
their 24
moral 24
motive 24
in 24
anything 24
but 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
or 24
to 24
place 24
the 24
disposition 24
which 24
is 24
thereby 24
brought 24
into 24
the 24
maxims 24
in 24
anything 24
but 24
respect 24
for 24
this 24
law 24
and 24
hence 24
commands 24
us 24
to 24
take 24
as 24
the 24
supreme 24
vital 24
principle 24
of 24
all 24
morality 24
in 24
men 24
the 24
thought 24
of 24
duty 24
which 24
strikes 24
down 24
all 24
arrogance 24
as 24
well 24

the 24

maintained 24
humanity 24
in 24
its 24
proper 24
dignity 24
in 24
his 24

no 24

to 24
be 24

this 24

it 24
is 24
not 24
even 24
the 24

part 24
of 24

no 24

would 24
perhaps 24
even 24
desire 24

merely 24
negative 24

pleasant 24
it 24

in 24
fact 24
only 24
the 24
escaping 24

sinking 24
in 24
personal 24
worth 24
after 24
everything 24
else 24
that 24
is 24
valuable 24

been 24
lost 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
a 24
respect 24
for 24
something 24
quite 24
different 24
from 24
life 24
something 24
in 24
comparison 24
and 24
contrast 24
with 24
which 24
life 24
with 24
all 24
its 24
enjoyment 24
has 24
no 24
value 24
he 24
still 24
lives 24
only 24
because 24
it 24
is 24
his 24
duty 24
not 24
because 24
he 24
finds 24
anything 24
pleasant 24
in 24
life 24
such 24
is 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
the 24
true 24
motive 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
no 24
other 24
than 24
the 24
pure 24
moral 24
law 24
itself 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
it 24
makes 24
us 24
conscious 24
of 24
the 24
sublimity 24
of 24
our 24
own 24
supersensible 24
existence 24
and 24
subjectively 24
produces 24
respect 24
for 24
their 24
higher 24
nature 24
in 24
men 24
who 24
are 24
also 24
conscious 24
of 24
their 24
sensible 24
existence 24
and 24
of 24
the 24
consequent 24
dependence 24
of 24
their 24
pathologically 24
very 24
susceptible 24
nature 24
now 24
with 24
this 24
motive 24
may 24
be 24
combined 24
so 24
many 24
charms 24
and 24
satisfactions 24
of 24
life 24
that 24
even 24
on 24
this 24
account 24
alone 24
the 24
most 24
prudent 24
choice 24
of 24
a 24
rational 24
epicurean 24
reflecting 24
on 24
the 24
greatest 24
advantage 24
of 24
life 24
would 24
declare 24
itself 24
on 24
the 24
side 24
of 24
moral 24
conduct 24
and 24
it 24
may 24
even 24
be 24
advisable 24
to 24
join 24
this 24
prospect 24
of 24
a 24
cheerful 24
enjoyment 24
of 24
life 24
with 24
that 24
supreme 24
motive 24
which 24
is 24
already 24
sufficient 24
of 24
itself 24
but 24
only 24
as 24
a 24
counterpoise 24
to 24
the 24
attractions 24
which 24
vice 24
does 24
not 24
fail 24
to 24
exhibit 24
on 24
the 24
opposite 24
side 24
and 24
not 24
so 24
as 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
smallest 24
degree 24
to 24
place 24
in 24
this 24
the 24
proper 24
moving 24
power 24
when 24
duty 24
is 24
in 24
question 24
for 24
that 24
would 24
be 24
just 24
the 24
same 24
as 24

only 24

that 24

advance 24

the 24

know 24

with 24

it 24

not 24

as 24
practical 24

has 24
to 24

only 24
a 24
law 24
because 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24

always 24
implies 24
the 24

only 24
after 24
that 24
can 24
it 24
proceed 24
to 24

of 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
a 24
practical 24
reason 24
namely 24
those 24
of 24
absolute 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
assign 24
them 24
in 24

with 24
those 24
principles 24
for 24
prior 24
to 24
those 24
principles 24
they 24
cannot 24
possibly 24
be 24
given 24
as 24
good 24
and 24
evil 24
by 24
any 24
faculty 24
of 24
knowledge 24
and 24
only 24
then 24
could 24
the 24
section 24
be 24
concluded 24
with 24
the 24
last 24
chapter 24
that 24
namely 24
which 24
treats 24
of 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
to 24
the 24
sensibility 24
and 24
of 24
its 24
necessary 24
influence 24
thereon 24
which 24
is 24
a 24
priori 24
cognisable 24
that 24
is 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
sentiment 24
thus 24
the 24
analytic 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
pure 24
reason 24
has 24
the 24
whole 24
extent 24
of 24
the 24
conditions 24
of 24
its 24
use 24
in 24
common 24
with 24
the 24
theoretical 24
but 24
in 24
reverse 24
order 24
the 24
analytic 24
of 24
pure 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
was 24
divided 24
into 24
transcendental 24

and 24

i 24
may 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
analogy 24
merely 24
use 24
these 24
designations 24
which 24
are 24
not 24
quite 24
suitable 24
this 24
logic 24
again 24
was 24
there 24
divided 24
into 24
the 24
analytic 24
of 24
concepts 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
principles 24
here 24
into 24
that 24
of 24
principles 24
and 24
concepts 24
the 24
aesthetic 24
also 24
had 24
in 24
the 24
former 24
case 24
two 24
parts 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
the 24
two 24
kinds 24
of 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
here 24
the 24
sensibility 24
is 24
not 24
considered 24
as 24
a 24
capacity 24
of 24
intuition 24
at 24
all 24
but 24
merely 24
as 24
feeling 24
which 24
can 24
be 24
a 24
subjective 24
ground 24
of 24
desire 24
and 24
in 24
regard 24
to 24
it 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
admits 24
no 24
further 24
division 24
it 24
is 24
also 24
easy 24
to 24
see 24
the 24
reason 24
why 24
this 24
division 24
into 24
two 24
parts 24
with 24
its 24
subdivision 24
was 24
not 24
actually 24
adopted 24
here 24
as 24
one 24
might 24
have 24
been 24
induced 24
to 24
attempt 24
by 24
the 24
example 24
of 24
the 24
former 24
critique 24
for 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
pure 24
reason 24
that 24
is 24
here 24
considered 24
in 24
its 24
practical 24
use 24
and 24
consequently 24
as 24
proceeding 24
from 24
a 24

principles 24
and 24
not 24
from 24

of 24

the 24
division 24
of 24
the 24
analytic 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
must 24
resemble 24
that 24

a 24
syllogism 24

proceeding 24
from 24
the 24

through 24
a 24

containing 24
a 24
subsumption 24
of 24
possible 24
actions 24
as 24
good 24
or 24
evil 24
under 24

first 24
to 24
establish 24

verify 24
the 24
purity 24
of 24
its 24
origin 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
this 24
common 24
reason 24
before 24
science 24
could 24
take 24
it 24
in 24
hand 24
to 24
make 24
use 24
of 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
fact 24

is 24
prior 24
to 24

drawn 24

this 24
circumstance 24
may 24
be 24
readily 24
explained 24
from 24
what 24
has 24
just 24
been 24
said 24
because 24
practical 24
pure 24
reason 24
must 24
necessarily 24
begin 24
with 24
principles 24
which 24

of 24
all 24
science 24

cannot 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
it 24
it 24
was 24
possible 24
to 24
effect 24
this 24
verification 24
of 24
moral 24
principles 24
as 24
principles 24
of 24
a 24

appeal 24
to 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24

sense 24
for 24
this 24

anything 24

or 24
pain 24
which 24
necessarily 24
attaches 24
to 24
it 24
as 24
exciting 24
desire 24
whereas 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
positively 24
refuses 24
to 24
admit 24
this 24
feeling 24
into 24
its 24
principle 24
as 24
a 24
condition 24
the 24
heterogeneity 24
of 24
the 24
determining 24
principles 24
the 24
empirical 24
and 24
rational 24
is 24
clearly 24
detected 24
by 24
this 24
resistance 24
of 24
a 24
practically 24
legislating 24
reason 24
against 24
every 24
admixture 24
of 24
inclination 24
and 24
by 24
a 24
peculiar 24
kind 24
of 24
sentiment 24
which 24
however 24
does 24
not 24
precede 24
the 24
legislation 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
is 24
produced 24
by 24
this 24
as 24
a 24
constraint 24
namely 24
by 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
a 24
respect 24
such 24
as 24
no 24
man 24
has 24
for 24
inclinations 24
of 24
whatever 24
kind 24
but 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
only 24
and 24
it 24
is 24
detected 24
in 24
so 24
marked 24
and 24
prominent 24
a 24
manner 24
that 24
even 24
the 24
most 24
uninstructed 24
cannot 24
fail 24
to 24
see 24
at 24
once 24
in 24
an 24
example 24
presented 24
to 24
him 24
that 24
empirical 24
principles 24
of 24
volition 24
may 24
indeed 24
urge 24
him 24
to 24
follow 24
their 24
attractions 24
but 24
that 24
he 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
expected 24
to 24
obey 24
anything 24
but 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
law 24
of 24
reason 24
alone 24
the 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
doctrine 24
of 24
happiness 24
and 24
the 24
doctrine 24
of 24
morality 24
in 24
the 24
former 24
of 24
which 24
empirical 24
principles 24
constitute 24
the 24
entire 24
foundation 24
while 24
in 24
the 24
second 24
they 24
do 24
not 24
form 24
the 24
smallest 24
part 24
of 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
first 24
and 24
most 24
important 24
office 24
of 24
the 24
analytic 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
it 24
must 24
proceed 24
in 24
it 24
with 24
as 24
much 24
exactness 24
and 24
so 24
to 24
speak 24
scrupulousness 24
as 24
any 24
geometer 24
in 24
his 24
work 24
the 24
philosopher 24
however 24
has 24
greater 24
difficulties 24
to 24
contend 24
with 24
here 24
as 24
always 24
in 24
rational 24
cognition 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
concepts 24
merely 24
without 24
construction 24
because 24
he 24
cannot 24
take 24
any 24
intuition 24
as 24
a 24
foundation 24
for 24
a 24
pure 24
noumenon 24
he 24
has 24
however 24
this 24
advantage 24
that 24
like 24
the 24
chemist 24
he 24
can 24
at 24
any 24
time 24
make 24
an 24
experiment 24
with 24
every 24
mans 24
practical 24
reason 24
for 24
the 24
purpose 24
of 24
distinguishing 24
the 24
moral 24
pure 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
from 24
the 24
empirical 24
namely 24
by 24
adding 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
to 24
the 24
empirically 24
affected 24
will 24
eg 24
that 24
of 24
the 24
man 24
who 24
would 24
be 24
ready 24
to 24
lie 24
because 24
he 24
can 24
gain 24
something 24
thereby 24
it 24
is 24
as 24
if 24
the 24
analyst 24
added 24
alkali 24
to 24
a 24
solution 24
of 24
lime 24
in 24
hydrochloric 24
acid 24
the 24
acid 24
at 24
once 24
forsakes 24
the 24
lime 24
combines 24
with 24
the 24
alkali 24
and 24
the 24
lime 24
is 24
precipitated 24
just 24
in 24
the 24
same 24
way 24
if 24
to 24
a 24
man 24
who 24
is 24
otherwise 24
honest 24
or 24
who 24
for 24
this 24
occasion 24
places 24
himself 24
only 24
in 24
thought 24
in 24
the 24
position 24
of 24
an 24
honest 24
man 24
we 24
present 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
by 24
which 24
he 24
recognises 24
the 24
worthlessness 24
of 24
the 24
liar 24
his 24
practical 24
reason 24
in 24
forming 24
a 24
judgement 24
of 24
what 24
ought 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
at 24
once 24
forsakes 24
the 24
advantage 24
combines 24
with 24
that 24
which 24
maintains 24
in 24
him 24
respect 24
for 24
his 24
own 24
person 24
truthfulness 24
and 24
the 24
advantage 24
after 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
separated 24
and 24
washed 24
from 24
every 24
particle 24
of 24
reason 24
which 24
is 24
altogether 24
on 24
the 24
side 24
of 24
duty 24
is 24
easily 24
weighed 24
by 24
everyone 24
so 24
that 24
it 24
can 24
enter 24
into 24
combination 24
with 24
reason 24
in 24
other 24
cases 24
only 24
not 24
where 24
it 24
could 24
be 24
opposed 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
reason 24
never 24
forsakes 24
but 24
most 24
closely 24
unites 24
itself 24
with 24
but 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
follow 24
that 24
this 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
happiness 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
morality 24
is 24
an 24
opposition 24
between 24
them 24
and 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
does 24
not 24
require 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
renounce 24
all 24
claim 24
to 24
happiness 24
but 24
only 24
that 24
the 24
moment 24
duty 24
is 24
in 24
question 24
we 24
should 24
take 24
no 24
account 24
of 24
happiness 24
it 24
may 24
even 24
in 24
certain 24
respects 24
be 24
a 24
duty 24
to 24
provide 24
for 24
happiness 24
partly 24
because 24
including 24
skill 24
wealth 24
riches 24
it 24
contains 24
means 24
for 24
the 24
fulfilment 24
of 24
our 24
duty 24
partly 24
because 24
the 24
absence 24
of 24
it 24
eg 24
poverty 24
implies 24
temptations 24
to 24
transgress 24
our 24
duty 24
but 24
it 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
an 24
immediate 24
duty 24
to 24
promote 24
our 24
happiness 24
still 24
less 24
can 24
it 24
be 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
all 24
duty 24
now 24
as 24
all 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
except 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
alone 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
are 24
all 24
empirical 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
such 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
happiness 24
they 24
must 24
all 24
be 24
kept 24
apart 24
from 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
never 24
be 24
incorporated 24
with 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
condition 24
since 24
this 24
would 24
be 24
to 24
destroy 24
all 24
moral 24
worth 24
just 24
as 24
much 24
as 24
any 24
empirical 24
admixture 24
with 24
geometrical 24
principles 24
would 24
destroy 24
the 24
certainty 24
of 24
mathematical 24
evidence 24
which 24
in 24
platos 24
opinion 24
is 24
the 24
most 24
excellent 24
thing 24
in 24
mathematics 24
even 24
surpassing 24
their 24
utility 24
instead 24
however 24
of 24
the 24
deduction 24
of 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
explanation 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
knowledge 24
a 24
priori 24
the 24
utmost 24
we 24
were 24
able 24
to 24
do 24
was 24
to 24
show 24
that 24
if 24
we 24
saw 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
an 24
efficient 24
cause 24
we 24
should 24
also 24
see 24
not 24
merely 24
the 24
possibility 24
but 24
even 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
the 24
supreme 24
practical 24
law 24
of 24
rational 24
beings 24
to 24
whom 24
we 24
attribute 24
freedom 24
of 24
causality 24
of 24
their 24
will 24
because 24
both 24
concepts 24
are 24
so 24
inseparably 24
united 24
that 24
we 24
might 24
define 24
practical 24
freedom 24
as 24
independence 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
on 24
anything 24
but 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
but 24
we 24
cannot 24
perceive 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
an 24
efficient 24
cause 24
especially 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
we 24
are 24
fortunate 24
if 24
only 24
we 24
can 24
be 24
sufficiently 24
assured 24
that 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
proof 24
of 24
its 24
impossibility 24
and 24
are 24
now 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
postulates 24
it 24
compelled 24
and 24
therefore 24
authorized 24
to 24
assume 24
it 24
however 24
there 24
are 24
still 24
many 24
who 24
think 24
that 24
they 24
can 24
explain 24
this 24
freedom 24
on 24
empirical 24
principles 24
like 24
any 24
other 24
physical 24
faculty 24
and 24
treat 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
psychological 24
property 24
the 24
explanation 24
of 24
which 24
only 24
requires 24
a 24
more 24
exact 24
study 24
of 24
the 24
nature 24
of 24
the 24
soul 24
and 24
of 24
the 24
motives 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
not 24
as 24
a 24
transcendental 24
predicate 24
of 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
that 24
belongs 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
which 24
is 24
really 24
the 24
point 24
they 24
thus 24
deprive 24
us 24
of 24
the 24
grand 24
revelation 24
which 24
we 24
obtain 24
through 24
practical 24
reason 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
the 24
revelation 24
namely 24
of 24
a 24
supersensible 24
world 24
by 24
the 24
realization 24
of 24
the 24
otherwise 24
transcendent 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
and 24
by 24
this 24
deprive 24
us 24
also 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
itself 24
which 24
admits 24
no 24
empirical 24
principle 24
of 24
determination 24
therefore 24
it 24
will 24
be 24
necessary 24
to 24
add 24
something 24
here 24
as 24
a 24
protection 24
against 24
this 24
delusion 24
and 24
to 24
exhibit 24
empiricism 24
in 24
its 24
naked 24
superficiality 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
causality 24
as 24
physical 24
necessity 24
in 24
opposition 24
to 24
the 24
same 24
notion 24
as 24
freedom 24
concerns 24
only 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
determinable 24
in 24
time 24
and 24
consequently 24
as 24
phenomena 24
in 24
opposition 24
to 24
their 24
causality 24
as 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
now 24
if 24
we 24
take 24
the 24
attributes 24
of 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
time 24
for 24
attributes 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
which 24
is 24
the 24
common 24
view 24
then 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
to 24
reconcile 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
causal 24
relation 24
with 24
freedom 24
they 24
are 24
contradictory 24
for 24
from 24
the 24
former 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
every 24
event 24
and 24
consequently 24
every 24
action 24
that 24
takes 24
place 24
at 24
a 24
certain 24
point 24
of 24
time 24
is 24
a 24
necessary 24
result 24
of 24
what 24
existed 24
in 24
time 24
preceding 24
now 24
as 24
time 24
past 24
is 24
no 24
longer 24
in 24
my 24
power 24
hence 24
every 24
action 24
that 24
i 24
perform 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
necessary 24

paragraph 24
if 24
then 24
we 24
would 24
attribute 24
freedom 24
to 24
a 24
being 24
whose 24
existence 24
is 24
determined 24
in 24
time 24
we 24
cannot 24
except 24
him 24
from 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
necessity 24
as 24
to 24
all 24
events 24
in 24
his 24
existence 24
and 24
consequently 24
as 24
to 24
his 24
actions 24
also 24
for 24
that 24
would 24
be 24
to 24
hand 24
him 24
over 24
to 24
blind 24
chance 24
now 24
as 24
this 24
law 24
inevitably 24
applies 24
to 24
all 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
things 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
their 24
existence 24
is 24
determinable 24
in 24
time 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
if 24
this 24
were 24
the 24
mode 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
had 24
also 24
to 24
conceive 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
these 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
freedom 24
must 24
be 24
rejected 24
as 24
a 24
vain 24
and 24
impossible 24
conception 24
consequently 24
if 24
we 24
would 24
still 24
save 24
it 24
no 24
other 24
way 24
remains 24
but 24
to 24
consider 24
that 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
a 24
thing 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
determinable 24
in 24
time 24
and 24
therefore 24
its 24
causality 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
physical 24
necessity 24
belong 24
to 24
appearance 24
and 24
to 24
attribute 24
freedom 24
to 24
the 24
same 24
being 24
as 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
itself 24
this 24
is 24
certainly 24
inevitable 24
if 24
we 24
would 24
retain 24
both 24
these 24
contradictory 24
concepts 24
together 24
but 24
in 24
application 24
when 24
we 24
try 24
to 24
explain 24
their 24
combination 24
in 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
action 24
great 24
difficulties 24
present 24
themselves 24
which 24
seem 24
to 24
render 24
such 24
a 24
combination 24
impracticable 24
when 24
i 24
say 24
of 24
a 24
man 24
who 24
commits 24
a 24
theft 24
that 24
by 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
causality 24
this 24
deed 24
is 24
a 24
necessary 24
result 24
of 24
the 24
determining 24
causes 24
in 24
preceding 24
time 24
then 24
it 24
was 24
impossible 24
that 24
it 24
could 24
not 24
have 24
happened 24
how 24
then 24
can 24
the 24
judgement 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
make 24
any 24
change 24
and 24
suppose 24
that 24
it 24
could 24
have 24
been 24
omitted 24
because 24
the 24
law 24
says 24
that 24
it 24
ought 24
to 24
have 24
been 24
omitted 24
that 24
is 24
how 24
can 24
a 24
man 24
be 24
called 24
quite 24
free 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
moment 24
and 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
same 24
action 24
in 24
which 24
he 24
is 24
subject 24
to 24
an 24
inevitable 24
physical 24
necessity 24
some 24
try 24
to 24
evade 24
this 24
by 24
saying 24
that 24
the 24
causes 24
that 24
determine 24
his 24
causality 24
are 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
kind 24
as 24
to 24
agree 24
with 24
a 24
comparative 24
notion 24
of 24
freedom 24
according 24
to 24
this 24
that 24
is 24
sometimes 24
called 24
a 24
free 24
effect 24
the 24
determining 24
physical 24
cause 24
of 24
which 24
lies 24
within 24
the 24
acting 24
thing 24
itself 24
eg 24
that 24
which 24
a 24
projectile 24
performs 24
when 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
free 24
motion 24
in 24
which 24
case 24
we 24
use 24
the 24
word 24
freedom 24
because 24
while 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
flight 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
urged 24
by 24
anything 24
external 24
or 24
as 24
we 24
call 24
the 24
motion 24
of 24
a 24
clock 24
a 24
free 24
motion 24
because 24
it 24
moves 24
its 24
hands 24
itself 24
which 24
therefore 24
do 24
not 24
require 24
to 24
be 24
pushed 24
by 24
external 24
force 24
so 24
although 24
the 24
actions 24
of 24
man 24
are 24
necessarily 24
determined 24
by 24
causes 24
which 24
precede 24
in 24
time 24
we 24
yet 24
call 24
them 24
free 24
because 24
these 24
causes 24
are 24
ideas 24
produced 24
by 24
our 24
own 24
faculties 24
whereby 24
desires 24
are 24
evoked 24
on 24
occasion 24
of 24
circumstances 24
and 24
hence 24
actions 24
are 24
wrought 24
according 24
to 24
our 24
own 24
pleasure 24
this 24
is 24
a 24
wretched 24
subterfuge 24
with 24
which 24
some 24
persons 24
still 24
let 24
themselves 24
be 24
put 24
off 24
and 24
so 24
think 24
they 24
have 24
solved 24
with 24
a 24
petty 24
word 24
jugglery 24
that 24
difficult 24
problem 24
at 24
the 24
solution 24
of 24
which 24
centuries 24
have 24
laboured 24
in 24
vain 24
and 24
which 24
can 24
therefore 24
scarcely 24
be 24
found 24
so 24
completely 24
on 24
the 24
surface 24
in 24
fact 24
in 24
the 24
question 24
about 24
the 24
freedom 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
all 24
moral 24
laws 24
and 24
the 24
consequent 24
responsibility 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
matter 24
whether 24
the 24
principles 24
which 24
necessarily 24
determine 24
causality 24
by 24
a 24
physical 24
law 24
reside 24
within 24
the 24
subject 24
or 24
without 24
him 24
or 24
in 24
the 24
former 24
case 24
whether 24
these 24
principles 24
are 24
instinctive 24
or 24
are 24
conceived 24
by 24
reason 24
if 24
as 24
is 24
admitted 24
by 24
these 24
men 24
themselves 24
these 24
determining 24
ideas 24
have 24
the 24
ground 24
of 24
their 24
existence 24
in 24
time 24
and 24
in 24
the 24
antecedent 24
state 24
and 24
this 24
again 24
in 24
an 24
antecedent 24
etc 24
then 24
it 24
matters 24
not 24
that 24
these 24
are 24
internal 24
it 24
matters 24
not 24
that 24
they 24
have 24
a 24
psychological 24
and 24
not 24
a 24
mechanical 24
causality 24
that 24
is 24
produce 24
actions 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
ideas 24
and 24
not 24
by 24
bodily 24
movements 24
they 24
are 24
still 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
whose 24
existence 24
is 24
determinable 24
in 24
time 24

therefore 24
under 24
the 24
necessitation 24
of 24
conditions 24
of 24
past 24
time 24
which 24
therefore 24
when 24
the 24
subject 24
has 24
to 24
act 24
are 24
no 24
longer 24
in 24
his 24
power 24
this 24
may 24
imply 24
psychological 24
freedom 24
if 24
we 24
choose 24
to 24
apply 24
this 24
term 24
to 24
a 24
merely 24
internal 24
chain 24
of 24
ideas 24
in 24
the 24
mind 24
but 24
it 24
involves 24
physical 24
necessity 24
and 24
therefore 24
leaves 24
no 24
room 24
for 24
transcendental 24
freedom 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
conceived 24
as 24
independence 24
on 24
everything 24
empirical 24
and 24
consequently 24
on 24
nature 24
generally 24
whether 24
it 24
is 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
internal 24

in 24
the 24

which 24
alone 24

a 24

no 24

no 24

imputation 24

possible 24
just 24
for 24
this 24
reason 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
events 24
in 24
time 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
physical 24

may 24
be 24
called 24
the 24
mechanism 24
of 24
nature 24
although 24
we 24
do 24
not 24
mean 24
by 24
this 24
that 24
things 24
which 24
are 24
subject 24

be 24
really 24
material 24
machines 24
we 24
look 24
here 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
the 24
connection 24
of 24
events 24
in 24
a 24
timeseries 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
developed 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
physical 24
law 24
whether 24
the 24
subject 24
in 24
which 24
this 24
development 24
takes 24
place 24
is 24
called 24
automaton 24
materiale 24
when 24
the 24
mechanical 24
being 24
is 24
moved 24
by 24
matter 24
or 24
with 24
leibnitz 24
spirituale 24
when 24
it 24
is 24
impelled 24
by 24
ideas 24
and 24
if 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
our 24
will 24
were 24
no 24
other 24
than 24
the 24
latter 24
say 24
the 24
psychological 24
and 24
comparative 24
not 24
also 24
transcendental 24
that 24
is 24
absolute 24
then 24
it 24
would 24
at 24
bottom 24
be 24
nothing 24
better 24
than 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
a 24
turnspit 24
which 24
when 24
once 24
it 24
is 24
wound 24
up 24
accomplishes 24
its 24
motions 24
of 24
itself 24
now 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
remove 24
in 24
the 24
supposed 24
case 24
the 24
apparent 24
contradiction 24
between 24
freedom 24
and 24
the 24
mechanism 24
of 24
nature 24
in 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
action 24
we 24
must 24
remember 24
what 24
was 24
said 24
in 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
or 24
what 24
follows 24
therefrom 24
viz 24
that 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
nature 24
which 24
cannot 24
coexist 24
with 24
the 24
freedom 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
appertains 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
attributes 24
of 24
the 24
thing 24
that 24
is 24
subject 24
to 24
timeconditions 24
consequently 24
only 24
to 24
those 24
of 24
the 24
acting 24
subject 24
as 24
a 24
phenomenon 24
that 24
therefore 24
in 24
this 24
respect 24
the 24
determining 24
principles 24
of 24
every 24
action 24
of 24
the 24
same 24
reside 24
in 24
what 24
belongs 24
to 24
past 24
time 24
and 24
is 24
no 24
longer 24
in 24
his 24
power 24
in 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
included 24
his 24
own 24
past 24
actions 24
and 24
the 24
character 24
that 24
these 24
may 24
determine 24
for 24
him 24
in 24
his 24
own 24
eyes 24
as 24
a 24
phenomenon 24
but 24
the 24
very 24
same 24
subject 24
being 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
side 24
conscious 24
of 24
himself 24
as 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
himself 24
considers 24
his 24
existence 24
also 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
subject 24
to 24
timeconditions 24
and 24
regards 24
himself 24
as 24
only 24
determinable 24
by 24
laws 24
which 24
he 24
gives 24
himself 24
through 24
reason 24
and 24
in 24
this 24
his 24
existence 24
nothing 24
is 24
antecedent 24
to 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
his 24
will 24
but 24
every 24
action 24
and 24
in 24
general 24
every 24
modification 24
of 24
his 24
existence 24
varying 24
according 24
to 24
his 24
internal 24
sense 24
even 24
the 24
whole 24
series 24
of 24
his 24
existence 24
as 24
a 24
sensible 24
being 24
is 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
his 24
supersensible 24
existence 24
nothing 24
but 24
the 24
result 24
and 24
never 24
to 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
his 24
causality 24
as 24
a 24
noumenon 24
in 24
this 24
view 24
now 24
the 24
rational 24
being 24
can 24
justly 24
say 24
of 24
every 24
unlawful 24
action 24
that 24
he 24
performs 24
that 24
he 24
could 24
very 24
well 24
have 24
left 24
it 24
undone 24
although 24
as 24
appearance 24
it 24
is 24
sufficiently 24
determined 24
in 24
the 24
past 24
and 24
in 24
this 24
respect 24
is 24
absolutely 24
necessary 24
for 24
it 24
with 24
all 24
the 24
past 24
which 24
determines 24
it 24
belongs 24
to 24
the 24
one 24
single 24
phenomenon 24
of 24
his 24
character 24
which 24
he 24
makes 24
for 24
himself 24
in 24
consequence 24
of 24
which 24
he 24
imputes 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
those 24
appearances 24
to 24
himself 24
as 24
a 24
cause 24
independent 24
of 24
sensibility 24
with 24
this 24
agree 24
perfectly 24
the 24
judicial 24
sentences 24
of 24
that 24
wonderful 24
faculty 24
in 24
us 24
which 24
we 24
call 24
conscience 24
a 24
man 24
may 24
use 24
as 24
much 24
art 24
as 24
he 24
likes 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
paint 24
to 24
himself 24
an 24
unlawful 24
act 24
that 24
he 24
remembers 24
as 24
an 24
unintentional 24
error 24
a 24
mere 24
oversight 24
such 24
as 24
one 24
can 24
never 24
altogether 24
avoid 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
something 24
in 24
which 24
he 24
was 24
carried 24
away 24
by 24
the 24
stream 24
of 24
physical 24
necessity 24
and 24
thus 24
to 24
make 24
himself 24
out 24
innocent 24
yet 24
he 24
finds 24
that 24
the 24
advocate 24
who 24
speaks 24
in 24
his 24
favour 24
can 24
by 24
no 24
means 24
silence 24
the 24
accuser 24
within 24
if 24
only 24
he 24
is 24
conscious 24
that 24
at 24
the 24
time 24
when 24
he 24
did 24
this 24
wrong 24
he 24
was 24
in 24
his 24
senses 24
that 24
is 24
in 24
possession 24
of 24
his 24
freedom 24
and 24
nevertheless 24
he 24
accounts 24
for 24
his 24
error 24
from 24
some 24
bad 24
habits 24
which 24
by 24
gradual 24
neglect 24
of 24
attention 24
he 24
has 24
allowed 24
to 24
grow 24
upon 24
him 24
to 24
such 24
a 24
degree 24
that 24
he 24
can 24
regard 24
his 24
error 24
as 24
its 24
natural 24
consequence 24
although 24
this 24
cannot 24
protect 24
him 24
from 24
the 24
blame 24
and 24
reproach 24
which 24
he 24
casts 24
upon 24
himself 24
this 24
is 24
also 24
the 24
ground 24
of 24
repentance 24
for 24
a 24
long 24
past 24
action 24
at 24
every 24
recollection 24
of 24
it 24
a 24
painful 24
feeling 24
produced 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
sentiment 24
and 24
which 24
is 24
practically 24
void 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
cannot 24
serve 24
to 24
undo 24
what 24
has 24
been 24
done 24
hence 24
priestley 24
as 24
a 24
true 24
and 24
consistent 24
fatalist 24
declares 24
it 24
absurd 24
and 24
he 24
deserves 24
to 24
be 24
commended 24
for 24
this 24
candour 24
more 24
than 24
those 24
who 24
while 24
they 24
maintain 24
the 24
mechanism 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
fact 24
and 24
its 24
freedom 24
in 24
words 24
only 24
yet 24
wish 24
it 24
to 24
be 24
thought 24
that 24
they 24
include 24
it 24
in 24
their 24
system 24
of 24
compromise 24
although 24
they 24
do 24
not 24
explain 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
such 24
moral 24
imputation 24
but 24
the 24
pain 24
is 24
quite 24
legitimate 24
because 24
when 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
our 24
intelligible 24
supersensible 24
existence 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
in 24
question 24
reason 24
recognizes 24
no 24
distinction 24
of 24
time 24
and 24
only 24
asks 24
whether 24
the 24
event 24
belongs 24
to 24
me 24
as 24
my 24
act 24
and 24
then 24
always 24
morally 24
connects 24
the 24
same 24
feeling 24
with 24
it 24
whether 24
it 24
has 24
happened 24
just 24
now 24
or 24
long 24
ago 24
for 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
consciousness 24
of 24
its 24
existence 24
ie 24
freedom 24
the 24
life 24
of 24
sense 24
is 24
but 24
a 24
single 24
phenomenon 24
which 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
it 24
contains 24
merely 24
manifestations 24
of 24
the 24
mental 24
disposition 24
with 24
regard 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
ie 24
of 24
the 24
character 24
must 24
be 24
judged 24
not 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
physical 24
necessity 24
that 24
belongs 24
to 24
it 24
as 24
phenomenon 24
but 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
absolute 24
spontaneity 24
of 24
freedom 24
it 24
may 24
therefore 24
be 24
admitted 24
that 24
if 24
it 24
were 24
possible 24
to 24
have 24
so 24
profound 24
an 24
insight 24
into 24
a 24
mans 24
mental 24
character 24
as 24
shown 24
by 24
internal 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
external 24
actions 24
as 24
to 24
know 24
all 24
its 24
motives 24
even 24
the 24
smallest 24
and 24
likewise 24
all 24
the 24
external 24
occasions 24
that 24
can 24
influence 24
them 24
we 24
could 24
calculate 24
a 24
mans 24
conduct 24
for 24
the 24
future 24
with 24
as 24
great 24
certainty 24
as 24
a 24
lunar 24
or 24
solar 24
eclipse 24
and 24
nevertheless 24
we 24
may 24
maintain 24
that 24
the 24
man 24
is 24
free 24
in 24
fact 24
if 24
we 24
were 24
capable 24
of 24
a 24
further 24
glance 24
namely 24
an 24
intellectual 24
intuition 24
of 24
the 24
same 24
subject 24
which 24
indeed 24
is 24
not 24
granted 24
to 24
us 24
and 24
instead 24
of 24
it 24
we 24
have 24
only 24
the 24
rational 24
concept 24
then 24
we 24
should 24
perceive 24
that 24
this 24
whole 24
chain 24
of 24
appearances 24
in 24
regard 24
to 24
all 24
that 24
concerns 24
the 24
moral 24
laws 24
depends 24
on 24
the 24
spontaneity 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
as 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
itself 24
of 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
which 24
no 24
physical 24
explanation 24
can 24
be 24
given 24
in 24
default 24
of 24
this 24
intuition 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
assures 24
us 24
of 24
this 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
our 24
actions 24
as 24
appearance 24
to 24
our 24
sensible 24
nature 24
and 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
this 24
sensible 24
nature 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
substratum 24
in 24
us 24
in 24
this 24
view 24
which 24
is 24
natural 24
to 24
our 24
reason 24
though 24
inexplicable 24
we 24
can 24
also 24
justify 24
some 24
judgements 24
which 24
we 24
passed 24
with 24
all 24
conscientiousness 24
and 24
which 24
yet 24
at 24
first 24
sight 24
seem 24
quite 24
opposed 24
to 24
all 24
equity 24
there 24
are 24
cases 24
in 24
which 24
men 24
even 24
with 24
the 24
same 24
education 24
which 24
has 24
been 24
profitable 24
to 24
others 24
yet 24
show 24
such 24
early 24
depravity 24
and 24
so 24
continue 24
to 24
progress 24
in 24
it 24
to 24
years 24
of 24
manhood 24
that 24
they 24
are 24
thought 24
to 24
be 24
born 24
villains 24
and 24
their 24
character 24
altogether 24
incapable 24
of 24
improvement 24
and 24
nevertheless 24
they 24
are 24
judged 24
for 24
what 24
they 24
do 24
or 24
leave 24
undone 24
they 24
are 24
reproached 24
for 24
their 24
faults 24
as 24
guilty 24
nay 24
they 24
themselves 24
the 24
children 24
regard 24
these 24
reproaches 24
as 24
well 24
founded 24
exactly 24
as 24
if 24
in 24
spite 24
of 24
the 24
hopeless 24
natural 24
quality 24
of 24
mind 24
ascribed 24
to 24
them 24
they 24
remained 24
just 24
as 24
responsible 24
as 24
any 24
other 24
man 24
this 24
could 24
not 24
happen 24
if 24
we 24
did 24
not 24
suppose 24
that 24
whatever 24
springs 24
from 24
a 24
mans 24
choice 24
as 24
every 24
action 24
intentionally 24
performed 24
undoubtedly 24
does 24
has 24
as 24
its 24
foundation 24
a 24
free 24
causality 24
which 24
from 24
early 24
youth 24
expresses 24
its 24
character 24
in 24
its 24
manifestations 24
ie 24
actions 24
these 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
the 24
uniformity 24
of 24
conduct 24
exhibit 24
a 24
natural 24
connection 24
which 24
however 24
does 24
not 24
make 24
the 24
vicious 24
quality 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
necessary 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
is 24
the 24
consequence 24
of 24
the 24
evil 24
principles 24
voluntarily 24
adopted 24
and 24
unchangeable 24
which 24
only 24
make 24
it 24
so 24
much 24
the 24
more 24
culpable 24
and 24
deserving 24
of 24
punishment 24
there 24
still 24
remains 24
a 24
difficulty 24
in 24
the 24
combination 24
of 24
freedom 24
with 24
the 24
mechanism 24
of 24
nature 24
in 24
a 24
being 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
a 24
difficulty 24
which 24
even 24
after 24
all 24
the 24
foregoing 24
is 24
admitted 24
threatens 24
freedom 24
with 24
complete 24
destruction 24
but 24
with 24
this 24
danger 24
there 24
is 24
also 24
a 24
circumstance 24
that 24
offers 24
hope 24
of 24
an 24
issue 24
still 24
favourable 24
to 24
freedom 24
namely 24
that 24
the 24
same 24
difficulty 24
presses 24
much 24
more 24
strongly 24
in 24
fact 24
as 24
we 24
shall 24
presently 24
see 24
presses 24
only 24
on 24
the 24
system 24
that 24
holds 24
the 24
existence 24
determinable 24
in 24
time 24
and 24
space 24
to 24
be 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
therefore 24
oblige 24
us 24
to 24
give 24
up 24
our 24
capital 24
supposition 24
of 24
the 24
ideality 24
of 24
time 24
as 24
a 24
mere 24
form 24
of 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
and 24
consequently 24
as 24
a 24
mere 24
manner 24
of 24
representation 24
which 24
is 24
proper 24
to 24
the 24
subject 24
as 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
and 24
therefore 24
it 24
only 24
requires 24
that 24
this 24
view 24
be 24
reconciled 24
with 24
this 24
idea 24
the 24
difficulty 24
is 24
as 24
follows 24
even 24
if 24
it 24
is 24
admitted 24
that 24
the 24
supersensible 24
subject 24
can 24
be 24
free 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
a 24
given 24
action 24
although 24
as 24
a 24
subject 24
also 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
he 24
is 24
under 24
mechanical 24
conditions 24
with 24
respect 24
to 24
the 24
same 24
action 24
still 24
as 24
soon 24
as 24
we 24
allow 24
that 24
god 24
as 24
universal 24
first 24
cause 24
is 24
also 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
substance 24
a 24
proposition 24
which 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
given 24
up 24
without 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
giving 24
up 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
god 24
as 24
the 24
being 24
of 24
all 24
beings 24
and 24
therewith 24
giving 24
up 24
his 24
all 24
sufficiency 24
on 24
which 24
everything 24
in 24
theology 24
depends 24
it 24
seems 24
as 24
if 24
we 24
must 24
admit 24
that 24
a 24
mans 24
actions 24
have 24
their 24
determining 24
principle 24
in 24
something 24
which 24
is 24
wholly 24
out 24
of 24
his 24
power 24
namely 24
in 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
a 24
supreme 24
being 24
distinct 24
from 24
himself 24
and 24
on 24
whom 24
his 24
own 24
existence 24
and 24
the 24
whole 24
determination 24
of 24
his 24
causality 24
are 24
absolutely 24
dependent 24
in 24
point 24
of 24
fact 24
if 24
a 24
mans 24
actions 24
as 24
belonging 24
to 24
his 24
modifications 24
in 24
time 24
were 24
not 24
merely 24
modifications 24
of 24
him 24
as 24
appearance 24
but 24
as 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
itself 24
freedom 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
saved 24
man 24
would 24
be 24
a 24
marionette 24
or 24
an 24
automaton 24
like 24
vaucansons 24
prepared 24
and 24
wound 24
up 24
by 24
the 24
supreme 24
artist 24
selfconsciousness 24
would 24
indeed 24
make 24
him 24
a 24
thinking 24
automaton 24
but 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
his 24
own 24
spontaneity 24
would 24
be 24
mere 24
delusion 24
if 24
this 24
were 24
mistaken 24
for 24
freedom 24
and 24
it 24
would 24
deserve 24
this 24
name 24
only 24
in 24
a 24
comparative 24
sense 24
since 24
although 24
the 24
proximate 24

a 24
long 24

of 24
their 24
determining 24
causes 24
are 24
internal 24
yet 24
the 24
last 24
and 24
highest 24
is 24
found 24
in 24
a 24
foreign 24
hand 24
therefore 24
i 24
do 24
not 24
see 24
how 24
those 24
who 24
still 24
insist 24
on 24
regarding 24
time 24
and 24
space 24
as 24
attributes 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
can 24
avoid 24
admitting 24
the 24
fatality 24
of 24
actions 24
or 24
if 24
like 24
the 24
otherwise 24
acute 24
mendelssohn 24
they 24
allow 24
them 24
to 24
be 24
conditions 24
necessarily 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
finite 24
and 24
derived 24
beings 24
but 24
not 24
to 24
that 24
of 24
the 24
infinite 24
supreme 24
being 24
i 24
do 24
not 24
see 24
on 24
what 24
ground 24
they 24
can 24
justify 24
such 24
a 24
distinction 24
or 24
indeed 24
how 24
they 24
can 24
avoid 24
the 24
contradiction 24
that 24
meets 24
them 24
when 24
they 24
hold 24
that 24
existence 24
in 24
time 24
is 24
an 24
attribute 24
necessarily 24
belonging 24
to 24
finite 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
whereas 24
god 24
is 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
this 24
existence 24
but 24
cannot 24
be 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
time 24
or 24
space 24
itself 24
since 24
this 24
must 24
be 24
presupposed 24
as 24
a 24
necessary 24
a 24
priori 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
and 24
consequently 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
these 24
things 24
his 24
causality 24
must 24
be 24
subject 24
to 24
conditions 24
and 24
even 24
to 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
time 24
and 24
this 24
would 24
inevitably 24
bring 24
in 24
everything 24
contradictory 24
to 24
the 24
notions 24
of 24
his 24
infinity 24
and 24
independence 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
it 24
is 24
quite 24
easy 24
for 24
us 24
to 24
draw 24
the 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
attribute 24
of 24
the 24
divine 24
existence 24
of 24
being 24
independent 24
on 24
all 24
timeconditions 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
the 24
distinction 24
being 24
that 24
between 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
in 24
itself 24
and 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
appearance 24
hence 24
if 24
this 24
ideality 24
of 24
time 24
and 24
space 24
is 24
not 24
adopted 24
nothing 24
remains 24
but 24
spinozism 24
in 24
which 24
space 24
and 24
time 24
are 24
essential 24
attributes 24
of 24
the 24
supreme 24
being 24
himself 24
and 24
the 24
things 24
dependent 24
on 24
him 24
ourselves 24
therefore 24
included 24
are 24
not 24
substances 24
but 24
merely 24
accidents 24
inhering 24
in 24
him 24
since 24
if 24
these 24
things 24
as 24
his 24
effects 24
exist 24
in 24

this 24
being 24
the 24
condition 24

themselves 24
then 24
the 24

his 24
actions 24

in 24
spite 24
of 24
the 24
absurdity 24
of 24
its 24
fundamental 24
idea 24
argues 24
more 24
consistently 24
than 24
the 24
creation 24
theory 24
can 24
when 24

bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
the 24
abovementioned 24
difficulty 24
is 24
resolved 24
briefly 24
and 24
clearly 24
as 24
follows 24
if 24
existence 24
in 24
time 24
is 24
a 24
mere 24
sensible 24
mode 24
of 24
representation 24
belonging 24
to 24
thinking 24
beings 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
and 24
consequently 24
does 24
not 24
apply 24
to 24
them 24
as 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
then 24
the 24
creation 24
of 24
these 24
beings 24
is 24
a 24
creation 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
since 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
creation 24
does 24
not 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
sensible 24
form 24
of 24
representation 24
of 24
existence 24
or 24
to 24
causality 24
but 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
referred 24
to 24
noumena 24
consequently 24
when 24
i 24
say 24
of 24
beings 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
that 24
they 24
are 24
created 24
i 24
so 24
far 24
regard 24
them 24
as 24
noumena 24
as 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
a 24
contradiction 24
therefore 24
to 24
say 24
that 24
god 24
is 24
a 24
creator 24
of 24
appearances 24
so 24
also 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
contradiction 24
to 24
say 24
that 24
as 24
creator 24
he 24
is 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
actions 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
appearances 24
although 24
he 24
is 24
the 24
cause 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
acting 24
beings 24
which 24
are 24
noumena 24
if 24
now 24
it 24
is 24
possible 24
to 24
affirm 24
freedom 24
in 24
spite 24
of 24
the 24
natural 24
mechanism 24
of 24
actions 24
as 24
appearances 24
by 24
regarding 24
existence 24
in 24
time 24
as 24
something 24
that 24
belongs 24
only 24
to 24
appearances 24
not 24
to 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
then 24
the 24
circumstance 24
that 24
the 24
acting 24
beings 24
are 24
creatures 24
cannot 24
make 24
the 24
slightest 24
difference 24
since 24
creation 24
concerns 24
their 24
supersensible 24
and 24
not 24
their 24
sensible 24
existence 24
and 24
therefore 24
cannot 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
appearances 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
quite 24
different 24
if 24
the 24
beings 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
as 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
existed 24
in 24
time 24
since 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
the 24
creator 24
of 24
substance 24
would 24
be 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
the 24
author 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
mechanism 24
of 24
this 24
substance 24
of 24
so 24
great 24
importance 24
is 24
the 24
separation 24
of 24
time 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
space 24
from 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
which 24
was 24
effected 24
in 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
speculative 24
reason 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
said 24
that 24
the 24
solution 24
here 24
proposed 24
involves 24
great 24
difficulty 24
in 24
itself 24
and 24
is 24
scarcely 24
susceptible 24
of 24
a 24
lucid 24
exposition 24
but 24
is 24
any 24
other 24
solution 24
that 24
has 24
been 24
attempted 24
or 24
that 24
may 24
be 24
attempted 24
easier 24
and 24
more 24
intelligible 24
rather 24
might 24
we 24
say 24
that 24
the 24
dogmatic 24
teachers 24
of 24
metaphysics 24
have 24
shown 24
more 24
shrewdness 24
than 24
candour 24
in 24
keeping 24
this 24
difficult 24
point 24
out 24
of 24
sight 24
as 24
much 24
as 24
possible 24
in 24
the 24
hope 24
that 24
if 24
they 24
said 24
nothing 24
about 24
it 24
probably 24
no 24
one 24
would 24
think 24
of 24
it 24
if 24
science 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
advanced 24
all 24
difficulties 24
must 24
be 24
laid 24
open 24
and 24
we 24
must 24
even 24
search 24
for 24
those 24
that 24
are 24
hidden 24
for 24
every 24
difficulty 24
calls 24
forth 24
a 24
remedy 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
discovered 24
without 24
science 24
gaining 24
either 24
in 24
extent 24
or 24
in 24
exactness 24
and 24
thus 24
even 24
obstacles 24
become 24
means 24
of 24
increasing 24
the 24
thoroughness 24
of 24
science 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
if 24
the 24
difficulties 24
are 24
intentionally 24
concealed 24
or 24
merely 24
removed 24
by 24
palliatives 24
then 24
sooner 24
or 24
later 24
they 24
burst 24
out 24
into 24
incurable 24
mischiefs 24
which 24
bring 24
science 24
to 24
ruin 24
in 24
an 24
absolute 24
scepticism 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
properly 24
speaking 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
freedom 24
alone 24
amongst 24
all 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
pure 24
speculative 24
reason 24
that 24
so 24
greatly 24
enlarges 24
our 24
knowledge 24
in 24
the 24
sphere 24
of 24
the 24
supersensible 24
though 24
only 24
of 24
our 24
practical 24
knowledge 24
i 24
ask 24
myself 24
why 24
it 24
exclusively 24
possesses 24
so 24
great 24
fertility 24
whereas 24
the 24
others 24
only 24
designate 24
the 24
vacant 24
space 24
for 24
possible 24
beings 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
but 24
are 24
unable 24
by 24
any 24
means 24
to 24
define 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
them 24
i 24
presently 24
find 24
that 24
as 24
i 24
cannot 24
think 24
anything 24
without 24
a 24
category 24
i 24
must 24
first 24
look 24
for 24
a 24
category 24
for 24
the 24
rational 24
idea 24
of 24
freedom 24
with 24
which 24
i 24
am 24
now 24
concerned 24
and 24
this 24
is 24
the 24
category 24
of 24
causality 24
and 24
although 24
freedom 24
a 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
reason 24
being 24
a 24
transcendent 24
concept 24
cannot 24
have 24
any 24
intuition 24
corresponding 24
to 24
it 24
yet 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
for 24
the 24
synthesis 24
of 24
which 24
the 24
former 24
demands 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
namely 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
causality 24
must 24
have 24
a 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
given 24
by 24
which 24
first 24
its 24
objective 24
reality 24
is 24
assured 24
now 24
the 24
categories 24
are 24
all 24
divided 24
into 24
two 24
classes 24
the 24
mathematical 24
which 24
concern 24
the 24
unity 24
of 24
synthesis 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
objects 24
and 24
the 24
dynamical 24
which 24
refer 24
to 24
the 24
unity 24
of 24
synthesis 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
objects 24
the 24
former 24
those 24
of 24
magnitude 24
and 24
quality 24
always 24
contain 24
a 24
synthesis 24
of 24
the 24
homogeneous 24
and 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
possible 24
to 24
find 24
in 24
this 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
antecedent 24
to 24
what 24
is 24
given 24
in 24
sensible 24
intuition 24
as 24
conditioned 24
in 24
space 24
and 24
time 24
as 24
this 24
would 24
itself 24
have 24
to 24
belong 24
to 24
space 24
and 24
time 24
and 24
therefore 24
be 24
again 24
still 24
conditioned 24
whence 24
it 24
resulted 24
in 24
the 24
dialectic 24
of 24
pure 24
theoretic 24
reason 24
that 24
the 24
opposite 24
methods 24
of 24
attaining 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
and 24
the 24
totality 24
of 24
the 24
conditions 24
were 24
both 24
wrong 24
the 24
categories 24
of 24
the 24
second 24
class 24
those 24
of 24
causality 24
and 24
of 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
a 24
thing 24
did 24
not 24
require 24
this 24
homogeneity 24
of 24
the 24
conditioned 24
and 24
the 24
condition 24
in 24
synthesis 24
since 24
here 24
what 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
explain 24
is 24
not 24
how 24
the 24
intuition 24
is 24
compounded 24
from 24
a 24
manifold 24
in 24
it 24
but 24
only 24
how 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
conditioned 24
object 24
corresponding 24
to 24
it 24
is 24
added 24
to 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
condition 24
added 24
namely 24
in 24
the 24
understanding 24
as 24
connected 24
therewith 24
and 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
it 24
was 24
allowable 24
to 24
suppose 24
in 24
the 24
supersensible 24
world 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
antecedent 24
to 24
the 24
altogether 24
conditioned 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
both 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
causal 24
connection 24
and 24
the 24
contingent 24
existence 24
of 24
things 24
themselves 24
although 24
this 24
unconditioned 24
remained 24
indeterminate 24
and 24
to 24
make 24
the 24
synthesis 24
transcendent 24
hence 24
it 24
was 24
found 24
in 24
the 24
dialectic 24
of 24
the 24
pure 24
speculative 24
reason 24
that 24
the 24
two 24
apparently 24
opposite 24
methods 24
of 24
obtaining 24
for 24
the 24
conditioned 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
were 24
not 24
really 24
contradictory 24
eg 24
in 24
the 24
synthesis 24
of 24
causality 24
to 24
conceive 24
for 24
the 24
conditioned 24
in 24
the 24
series 24
of 24
causes 24
and 24
effects 24
of 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
a 24
causality 24
which 24
has 24
no 24
sensible 24
condition 24
and 24
that 24
the 24
same 24
action 24
which 24
as 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
is 24
always 24
sensibly 24
conditioned 24
that 24
is 24
mechanically 24
necessary 24
yet 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
may 24
be 24
derived 24
from 24
a 24
causality 24
not 24
sensibly 24
conditioned 24
being 24
the 24
causality 24
of 24
the 24
acting 24
being 24
as 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
world 24
and 24
may 24
consequently 24
be 24
conceived 24
as 24
free 24
now 24
the 24
only 24
point 24
in 24
question 24
was 24
to 24
change 24
this 24
may 24
be 24
into 24
is 24
that 24
is 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
be 24
able 24
to 24
show 24
in 24
an 24
actual 24
case 24
as 24
it 24
were 24
by 24
a 24
fact 24
that 24
certain 24
actions 24
imply 24
such 24
a 24
causality 24
namely 24
the 24
intellectual 24
sensibly 24
unconditioned 24
whether 24
they 24
are 24
actual 24
or 24
only 24
commanded 24
that 24
is 24
objectively 24
necessary 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
sense 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
hope 24
to 24
find 24
this 24
connections 24
in 24
actions 24
actually 24
given 24
in 24
experience 24
as 24
events 24
of 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
since 24
causality 24
with 24
freedom 24
must 24
always 24
be 24
sought 24
outside 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
intelligence 24
but 24
things 24
of 24
sense 24
of 24
sense 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
intelligence 24
but 24
things 24
of 24
sense 24
are 24
the 24
only 24
things 24
offered 24
to 24
our 24
perception 24
and 24
observation 24
hence 24
nothing 24
remained 24
but 24
to 24
find 24
an 24
incontestable 24
objective 24
principle 24
of 24
causality 24
which 24
excludes 24
all 24
sensible 24
conditions 24
that 24
is 24
a 24
principle 24
in 24
which 24
reason 24
does 24
not 24
appeal 24
further 24
to 24
something 24
else 24
as 24
a 24
determining 24
ground 24
of 24
its 24
causality 24
but 24
contains 24
this 24
determining 24
ground 24
itself 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
that 24
principle 24
and 24
in 24
which 24
therefore 24
it 24
is 24
itself 24
as 24
pure 24
reason 24
practical 24
now 24
this 24
principle 24
had 24
not 24
to 24
be 24
searched 24
for 24
or 24
discovered 24
it 24
had 24
long 24
been 24
in 24
the 24
reason 24
of 24
all 24
men 24
and 24
incorporated 24
in 24
their 24
nature 24
and 24
is 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
morality 24
therefore 24
that 24
unconditioned 24
causality 24
with 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
it 24
namely 24
freedom 24
is 24
no 24
longer 24
merely 24
indefinitely 24
and 24
problematically 24
thought 24
this 24
speculative 24
reason 24
could 24
prove 24
to 24
be 24
feasible 24
but 24
is 24
even 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
its 24
causality 24
definitely 24
and 24
assertorially 24
known 24
and 24
with 24
it 24
the 24
fact 24
that 24
a 24
being 24
i 24
myself 24
belonging 24
to 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
belongs 24
also 24
to 24
the 24
supersensible 24
world 24
this 24
is 24
also 24
positively 24
known 24
and 24
thus 24
the 24
reality 24
of 24
the 24
supersensible 24
world 24
is 24
established 24
and 24
in 24
practical 24
respects 24
definitely 24
given 24
and 24
this 24
definiteness 24
which 24
for 24
theoretical 24
purposes 24
would 24
be 24
transcendent 24
is 24
for 24
practical 24
purposes 24
immanent 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
however 24
make 24
a 24
similar 24
step 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
second 24
dynamical 24
idea 24
namely 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
necessary 24
being 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
rise 24
to 24
it 24
from 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
without 24
the 24
aid 24
of 24
the 24
first 24
dynamical 24
idea 24
for 24
if 24
we 24
attempted 24
to 24
do 24
so 24
we 24
should 24
have 24
ventured 24
to 24
leave 24
at 24
a 24
bound 24
all 24
that 24
is 24
given 24
to 24
us 24
and 24
to 24
leap 24
to 24
that 24
of 24
which 24
nothing 24
is 24
given 24
us 24
that 24
can 24
help 24
us 24
to 24
effect 24
the 24
connection 24
of 24
such 24
a 24
supersensible 24
being 24
with 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
since 24
the 24
necessary 24
being 24
would 24
have 24
to 24
be 24
known 24
as 24
given 24
outside 24
ourselves 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
it 24
is 24
now 24
obvious 24
that 24
this 24
connection 24
is 24
quite 24
possible 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
our 24
own 24
subject 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
i 24
know 24
myself 24
to 24
be 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
side 24
as 24
an 24
intelligible 24
supersensible 24
being 24
determined 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
freedom 24
and 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
side 24
as 24
acting 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
freedom 24
alone 24
that 24
enables 24
us 24
to 24
find 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
and 24
intelligible 24
for 24
the 24
conditioned 24
and 24
sensible 24
without 24
going 24
out 24
of 24
ourselves 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
our 24
own 24
reason 24
that 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
supreme 24
and 24
unconditional 24
practical 24
law 24
knows 24
that 24
itself 24
and 24
the 24
being 24
that 24
is 24
conscious 24
of 24
this 24
law 24
our 24
own 24
person 24
belong 24
to 24
the 24
pure 24
world 24
of 24
understanding 24
and 24
moreover 24
defines 24
the 24
manner 24
in 24
which 24
as 24
such 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
active 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
understood 24
why 24
in 24
the 24
whole 24
faculty 24
of 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
practical 24
reason 24
only 24
that 24
can 24
help 24
us 24
to 24
pass 24
beyond 24
the 24
world 24
of 24
sense 24
and 24
give 24
us 24
knowledge 24
of 24
a 24
supersensible 24
order 24
and 24
connection 24
which 24
however 24
for 24
this 24
very 24
reason 24
cannot 24
be 24
extended 24
further 24
than 24
is 24
necessary 24
for 24
pure 24
practical 24
purposes 24
let 24
me 24
be 24
permitted 24
on 24
this 24
occasion 24
to 24
make 24
one 24
more 24
remark 24
namely 24
that 24
every 24
step 24
that 24
we 24
make 24
with 24
pure 24
reason 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
practical 24

the 24
maxim 24
already 24
recognized 24

praised 24
by 24
others 24
namely 24
that 24
in 24
every 24
scientific 24
inquiry 24
we 24
should 24
pursue 24
our 24
way 24
steadily 24
with 24
all 24
possible 24

any 24
objections 24
that 24
may 24
be 24
raised 24
from 24
outside 24

as 24

as 24
we 24
can 24

out 24
our 24
inquiry 24
truthfully 24
and 24
completely 24

this 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
found 24
in 24

but 24
as 24
all 24
conceptions 24
of 24

must 24
be 24

these 24

never 24

hence 24
can 24
never 24
enable 24
us 24
to 24
know 24
objects 24
as 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
but 24
only 24
as 24
appearances 24
and 24
since 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
found 24
in 24
this 24
chain 24
of 24
appearances 24
which 24
consists 24
only 24
of 24
conditioned 24

arises 24
an 24
inevitable 24
illusion 24

these 24
latter 24
were 24

a 24
warning 24
critique 24
they 24
are 24
always 24
regarded 24
as 24
such 24
this 24

would 24
never 24
be 24
noticed 24

delusive 24
if 24
it 24
did 24
not 24
betray 24
itself 24
by 24
a 24
conflict 24
of 24
reason 24
with 24
itself 24
when 24
it 24
applies 24
to 24
appearances 24
its 24
fundamental 24
principle 24
of 24
presupposing 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
to 24
everything 24
conditioned 24
by 24

however 24
reason 24
is 24
compelled 24
to 24
trace 24
this 24
illusion 24
to 24
its 24
source 24
and 24
search 24
how 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
removed 24
and 24
this 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
done 24
by 24
a 24
complete 24
critical 24
examination 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
pure 24

the 24
antinomy 24

pure 24

which 24
is 24
manifest 24
in 24
its 24

is 24
in 24
fact 24
the 24
most 24
beneficial 24
error 24
into 24
which 24
human 24
reason 24
could 24
ever 24
have 24
fallen 24
since 24
it 24
at 24

drives 24
us 24

the 24

escape 24
from 24
this 24
labyrinth 24
and 24
when 24
this 24
key 24
is 24
found 24
it 24
further 24
discovers 24
that 24
which 24
we 24
did 24
not 24
seek 24
but 24
yet 24
had 24
need 24
of 24
namely 24
a 24
view 24
into 24
a 24
higher 24
and 24
an 24
immutable 24
order 24
of 24
things 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
even 24
now 24
are 24
and 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
thereby 24
enabled 24
by 24
definite 24
precepts 24
to 24
continue 24
to 24
live 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
highest 24
dictates 24
of 24
reason 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
seen 24
in 24
detail 24
in 24
the 24
critique 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
how 24
in 24
its 24
speculative 24
employment 24
this 24
natural 24
dialectic 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
solved 24
and 24
how 24
the 24
error 24
which 24
arises 24
from 24
a 24
very 24
natural 24
illusion 24
may 24
be 24
guarded 24
against 24
but 24
reason 24
in 24
its 24
practical 24
use 24
is 24
not 24
a 24
whit 24
better 24
off 24
as 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
it 24
likewise 24
seeks 24
to 24
find 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
for 24
the 24
practically 24
conditioned 24
which 24
rests 24
on 24
inclinations 24
and 24
natural 24
wants 24
and 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
as 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
but 24
even 24
when 24
this 24
is 24
given 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
it 24
seeks 24
the 24
unconditioned 24
totality 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
under 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
to 24
define 24
this 24
idea 24
practically 24
ie 24
sufficiently 24
for 24
the 24
maxims 24
of 24
our 24
rational 24
conduct 24
is 24
the 24
business 24
of 24
practical 24
wisdom 24
and 24
this 24
again 24
as 24
a 24
science 24
is 24
philosophy 24
in 24
the 24
sense 24
in 24
which 24
the 24
word 24
was 24
understood 24
by 24
the 24
ancients 24
with 24
whom 24
it 24
meant 24
instruction 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
in 24
which 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
was 24
to 24
be 24
placed 24
and 24
the 24
conduct 24
by 24
which 24
it 24
was 24
to 24
be 24
obtained 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
well 24
to 24
leave 24
this 24
word 24
in 24
its 24
ancient 24
signification 24
as 24
a 24
doctrine 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
reason 24
endeavours 24
to 24
make 24
this 24
into 24
a 24
science 24
for 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
band 24
the 24
restriction 24
annexed 24
would 24
suit 24
the 24
greek 24
expression 24
which 24
signifies 24
the 24
love 24
of 24
wisdom 24
and 24
yet 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
would 24
be 24
sufficient 24
to 24
embrace 24
under 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
philosophy 24
the 24
love 24
of 24
science 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
of 24
all 24
speculative 24
rational 24
knowledge 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
serviceable 24
to 24
reason 24
both 24
for 24
that 24
conception 24
and 24
also 24
for 24
the 24
practical 24
principle 24
determining 24
our 24
conduct 24
without 24
letting 24
out 24
of 24
sight 24
the 24
main 24
end 24
on 24
account 24
of 24
which 24
alone 24
it 24
can 24
be 24
called 24
a 24
doctrine 24
of 24
practical 24
wisdom 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
it 24
would 24
be 24
no 24
harm 24
to 24
deter 24
the 24
selfconceit 24
of 24
one 24
who 24
ventures 24
to 24
claim 24
the 24
title 24
of 24
philosopher 24
by 24
holding 24
before 24
him 24
in 24
the 24
very 24
definition 24
a 24
standard 24
of 24
selfestimation 24
which 24
would 24
very 24
much 24
lower 24
his 24
pretensions 24
for 24
a 24
teacher 24
of 24
wisdom 24
would 24
mean 24
something 24
more 24
than 24
a 24
scholar 24
who 24
has 24
not 24
come 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
to 24
guide 24
himself 24
much 24
less 24
to 24
guide 24
others 24
with 24
certain 24
expectation 24
of 24
attaining 24
so 24
high 24
an 24
end 24
it 24
would 24
mean 24
a 24
master 24
in 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
wisdom 24
which 24
implies 24
more 24
than 24
a 24
modest 24
man 24

claim 24
for 24
himself 24
thus 24
philosophy 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
wisdom 24
would 24
always 24
remain 24

ideal 24

objectively 24
is 24
presented 24

the 24
sole 24

of 24
a 24

since 24
this 24
is 24
merely 24
formal 24
viz 24
as 24
prescribing 24
only 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
the 24
maxim 24
as 24
universally 24

it 24
abstracts 24
as 24
a 24
determining 24
principle 24
from 24
all 24
matter 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
from 24
every 24
object 24
of 24
volition 24
hence 24
though 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
may 24
be 24
the 24
whole 24
object 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24

ie 24
a 24
pure 24

yet 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
on 24
that 24
account 24
to 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
its 24
determining 24
principle 24
and 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
alone 24
must 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
the 24
principle 24
on 24
which 24
that 24
and 24
its 24
realization 24
or 24
promotion 24
are 24
aimed 24
at 24
this 24
remark 24
is 24
important 24
in 24
so 24
delicate 24
a 24
case 24
as 24
the 24
determination 24

where 24
the 24

out 24

all 24

always 24
presupposes 24
morally 24
right 24
behaviour 24
as 24
its 24
condition 24

two 24
elements 24

one 24

must 24
be 24

this 24
either 24
so 24
that 24
their 24

considered 24
as 24
analytical 24

as 24
synthetical 24

understood 24
in 24
two 24
ways 24
either 24
the 24

virtuous 24

the 24
rational 24
pursuit 24

are 24
not 24
two 24
distinct 24
actions 24

absolutely 24
identical 24

which 24

in 24
this 24
that 24

something 24
distinct 24
from 24

virtue 24
as 24
a 24
cause 24
produces 24
an 24
effect 24
the 24
ancient 24
greek 24
schools 24
were 24
properly 24
speaking 24
only 24
two 24
and 24
in 24
determining 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
these 24
followed 24
in 24
fact 24
one 24
and 24
the 24
same 24
method 24
inasmuch 24
as 24
they 24
did 24
not 24
allow 24
virtue 24
and 24
happiness 24
to 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
two 24
distinct 24
elements 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
consequently 24
sought 24
the 24
unity 24
of 24
the 24
principle 24
by 24
the 24
rule 24
of 24
identity 24
but 24
they 24
differed 24
as 24
to 24
which 24
of 24
the 24
two 24
was 24
to 24
be 24
taken 24
as 24
the 24
fundamental 24
notion 24
the 24
epicurean 24
said 24
to 24
be 24
conscious 24
that 24
ones 24
maxims 24
lead 24
to 24
happiness 24
is 24
virtue 24
the 24
stoic 24
said 24
to 24
be 24
conscious 24
of 24
ones 24
virtue 24
is 24
happiness 24
with 24
the 24
former 24
prudence 24
was 24
equivalent 24
to 24
morality 24
with 24
the 24
latter 24
who 24
chose 24
a 24
higher 24
designation 24
for 24
virtue 24
morality 24
alone 24
was 24
true 24
wisdom 24
while 24
we 24
must 24
admire 24
the 24
men 24
who 24
in 24
such 24
early 24
times 24
tried 24
all 24
imaginable 24
ways 24
of 24
extending 24
the 24
domain 24
of 24
philosophy 24
we 24
must 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
lament 24
that 24
their 24
acuteness 24
was 24
unfortunately 24
misapplied 24
in 24
trying 24
to 24
trace 24
out 24
identity 24
between 24
two 24
extremely 24
heterogeneous 24
notions 24
those 24
of 24
happiness 24
and 24
virtue 24
but 24
it 24
agrees 24
with 24
the 24
dialectical 24
spirit 24
of 24
their 24
times 24
and 24
subtle 24
minds 24
are 24
even 24
now 24
sometimes 24
misled 24
in 24
the 24
same 24
way 24
to 24
get 24
rid 24
of 24
irreconcilable 24
differences 24
in 24
principle 24
by 24
seeking 24
to 24
change 24
them 24
into 24
a 24
mere 24
contest 24
about 24
words 24
and 24
thus 24
apparently 24
working 24
out 24
the 24
identity 24
of 24
the 24
notion 24
under 24
different 24
names 24
and 24
this 24
usually 24
occurs 24
in 24
cases 24
where 24
the 24
combination 24
of 24
heterogeneous 24
principles 24
lies 24
so 24
deep 24

so 24
high 24

would 24

complete 24

already 24
contained 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24

not 24
with 24
the 24

moreover 24
two 24
wholes 24
may 24
be 24
specifically 24
distinct 24
although 24
they 24
consist 24
of 24
the 24

the 24

only 24
the 24
form 24
of 24
the 24

for 24
its 24

viz 24
the 24
rational 24
use 24
of 24
the 24

for 24
attaining 24
it 24
now 24
it 24
is 24
clear 24
from 24
the 24
analytic 24
that 24
the 24
maxims 24
of 24
virtue 24
and 24
those 24
of 24
private 24
happiness 24
are 24
quite 24
heterogeneous 24
as 24
to 24
their 24
supreme 24
practical 24
principle 24
and 24
although 24
they 24
belong 24
to 24
one 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
together 24
they 24
make 24
possible 24
yet 24
they 24
are 24
so 24
far 24
from 24
coinciding 24
that 24
they 24
restrict 24
and 24
check 24
one 24
another 24
very 24
much 24
in 24

the 24
question 24
how 24
is 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
practically 24
possible 24
still 24
remains 24
an 24
unsolved 24
problem 24
notwithstanding 24
all 24
the 24
attempts 24
at 24
coalition 24
that 24
have 24
hitherto 24
been 24
made 24
the 24
analytic 24
has 24
however 24
shown 24
what 24
it 24
is 24
that 24
makes 24
the 24
problem 24
difficult 24
to 24
solve 24
namely 24
that 24
happiness 24
and 24
morality 24
are 24
two 24
specifically 24
distinct 24
elements 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
therefore 24
their 24
combination 24
cannot 24
be 24
analytically 24
cognised 24
as 24
if 24
the 24
man 24
that 24
seeks 24
his 24
own 24
happiness 24
should 24
find 24
by 24
mere 24
analysis 24
of 24
his 24
conception 24
that 24
in 24
so 24
acting 24
he 24
is 24
virtuous 24
or 24
as 24
if 24
the 24
man 24
that 24
follows 24
virtue 24
should 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
such 24
conduct 24
find 24
that 24
he 24
is 24
already 24
happy 24
ipso 24
facto 24
but 24
must 24
be 24
a 24
synthesis 24
of 24
concepts 24
now 24
since 24
this 24
combination 24
is 24
recognised 24
as 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
therefore 24
as 24
practically 24
necessary 24
and 24
consequently 24
not 24
as 24
derived 24
from 24
experience 24
so 24
that 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
does 24
not 24
rest 24
on 24
any 24
empirical 24
principle 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
the 24
deduction 24
legitimation 24
of 24
this 24
concept 24
must 24
be 24
transcendental 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
priori 24
morally 24
necessary 24
to 24
produce 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
by 24
freedom 24
of 24

therefore 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
its 24

must 24

solely 24

by 24
our 24

virtue 24

either 24
analytical 24

been 24
shown 24
that 24

it 24
must 24
then 24
be 24
synthetical 24
and 24
more 24
particularly 24
must 24
be 24
conceived 24
as 24
the 24
connection 24
of 24
cause 24
and 24

it 24

a 24

ie 24
one 24
that 24
is 24

by 24

consequently 24
either 24
the 24

must 24
be 24
the 24

absolutely 24

all 24

no 24

can 24
be 24
founded 24
on 24
them 24
but 24
the 24
second 24
is 24
also 24

not 24
depend 24
upon 24
the 24

a 24
misconception 24
because 24
the 24
relation 24
between 24
appearances 24
was 24
taken 24
for 24
a 24
relation 24
of 24
the 24
things 24
in 24
themselves 24
to 24
these 24
appearances 24
when 24
we 24
find 24
ourselves 24
obliged 24
to 24
go 24
so 24
far 24
namely 24
to 24
the 24
connection 24
with 24
an 24
intelligible 24
world 24
to 24
find 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
reason 24
points 24
out 24
to 24
all 24
rational 24
beings 24
as 24
the 24
goal 24
of 24
all 24
their 24
moral 24
wishes 24
it 24
must 24
seem 24
strange 24
that 24
nevertheless 24
the 24
philosophers 24
both 24
of 24
ancient 24
and 24
modern 24
times 24
have 24
been 24
able 24
to 24
find 24
happiness 24
in 24
accurate 24
proportion 24
to 24
virtue 24
even 24
in 24
this 24
life 24
in 24
the 24
sensible 24
world 24
or 24
have 24
persuaded 24
themselves 24
that 24
they 24
were 24
conscious 24
thereof 24
for 24
epicurus 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
the 24
stoics 24
extolled 24
above 24
everything 24
the 24
happiness 24
that 24
springs 24
from 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
living 24
virtuously 24
and 24
the 24
former 24
was 24
not 24
so 24
base 24
in 24
his 24
practical 24
precepts 24
as 24
one 24
might 24
infer 24
from 24
the 24
principles 24
of 24
his 24
theory 24
which 24
he 24
used 24
for 24
explanation 24
and 24
not 24
for 24
action 24
or 24
as 24
they 24
were 24
interpreted 24
by 24
many 24
who 24
were 24
misled 24
by 24
his 24
using 24
the 24
term 24
pleasure 24
for 24
contentment 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
he 24
reckoned 24
the 24
most 24
disinterested 24
practice 24
of 24
good 24
amongst 24
the 24
ways 24
of 24
enjoying 24
the 24
most 24
intimate 24
delight 24
and 24
his 24
scheme 24
of 24
pleasure 24
by 24
which 24
he 24
meant 24
constant 24
cheerfulness 24
of 24
mind 24
included 24
the 24
moderation 24
and 24
control 24
of 24
the 24
inclinations 24
such 24
as 24
the 24
strictest 24
moral 24
philosopher 24
might 24
require 24
he 24
differed 24
from 24
the 24
stoics 24
chiefly 24
in 24
making 24
this 24
pleasure 24
the 24
motive 24
which 24
they 24
very 24
rightly 24
refused 24
to 24
do 24
for 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
hand 24
the 24
virtuous 24
epicurus 24
like 24
many 24
wellintentioned 24
men 24
of 24
this 24
day 24
who 24
do 24
not 24
reflect 24
deeply 24
enough 24
on 24
their 24
principles 24
fell 24
into 24
the 24
error 24
of 24
presupposing 24
the 24
virtuous 24
disposition 24
in 24
the 24
persons 24
for 24
whom 24
he 24
wished 24
to 24
provide 24
the 24
springs 24
to 24
virtue 24
and 24
indeed 24
the 24
upright 24
man 24
cannot 24
be 24
happy 24
if 24
he 24
is 24
not 24
first 24
conscious 24
of 24
his 24
uprightness 24
since 24
with 24
such 24
a 24
character 24
the 24
reproach 24
that 24
his 24
habit 24
of 24
thought 24
would 24
oblige 24
him 24
to 24
make 24
against 24
himself 24
in 24
case 24
of 24
transgression 24
and 24
his 24
moral 24
selfcondemnation 24
would 24
rob 24
him 24
of 24
all 24
enjoyment 24
of 24
the 24
pleasantness 24
which 24
his 24
condition 24
might 24
otherwise 24
contain 24
but 24
the 24
question 24
is 24
how 24
is 24
such 24
a 24
disposition 24
possible 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
instance 24
and 24
such 24
a 24
habit 24
of 24
thought 24
in 24
estimating 24
the 24
worth 24
of 24
ones 24
existence 24
since 24
prior 24
to 24
it 24
there 24
can 24
be 24
in 24
the 24
subject 24
no 24
feeling 24
at 24
all 24
for 24
moral 24
worth 24
if 24
a 24
man 24
is 24
virtuous 24
without 24
being 24
conscious 24
of 24
his 24
integrity 24
in 24
every 24
action 24
he 24
will 24
certainly 24
not 24
enjoy 24
life 24
however 24
favourable 24
fortune 24
may 24
be 24
to 24
him 24
in 24
its 24
physical 24
circumstances 24
but 24
can 24
we 24
make 24
him 24
virtuous 24
in 24
the 24
first 24
instance 24
in 24
other 24
words 24
before 24
he 24
esteems 24
the 24
moral 24
worth 24
of 24
his 24
existence 24
so 24
highly 24
by 24
praising 24
to 24
him 24
the 24
peace 24
of 24
mind 24
that 24
would 24
result 24
from 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
an 24
integrity 24
for 24
which 24
he 24
has 24
no 24
sense 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
however 24
there 24
is 24
here 24
an 24
occasion 24
of 24
a 24
vitium 24
subreptionis 24
and 24
as 24
it 24
were 24
of 24
an 24
optical 24
illusion 24
in 24
the 24
selfconsciousness 24
of 24
what 24
one 24
does 24
as 24
distinguished 24
from 24
what 24
one 24
feels 24
an 24
illusion 24
which 24
even 24
the 24
most 24
experienced 24
cannot 24
altogether 24
avoid 24
the 24
moral 24
disposition 24
of 24
mind 24
is 24
necessarily 24
combined 24
with 24
a 24
consciousness 24
that 24
the 24
will 24
is 24
determined 24
directly 24
by 24
the 24
law 24
now 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
a 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
is 24
always 24
the 24
source 24
of 24
a 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
the 24
resulting 24
action 24
but 24
this 24
pleasure 24
this 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
oneself 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
action 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
directly 24
by 24
reason 24
is 24
the 24
source 24
of 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
and 24
this 24
remains 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
not 24
sensible 24
determination 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
now 24
as 24
this 24
determination 24
has 24
exactly 24
the 24
same 24
effect 24
within 24
in 24
impelling 24
to 24
activity 24
that 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
the 24
pleasure 24
to 24
be 24
expected 24
from 24
the 24
desired 24
action 24
would 24
have 24
had 24
we 24
easily 24
look 24
on 24
what 24
we 24
ourselves 24
do 24
as 24
something 24
which 24
we 24
merely 24
passively 24
feel 24
and 24
take 24
the 24
moral 24
spring 24
for 24
a 24
sensible 24
impulse 24
just 24
as 24
it 24
happens 24
in 24
the 24
socalled 24
illusion 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
the 24
inner 24
sense 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
sublime 24
thing 24
in 24
human 24
nature 24
to 24
be 24
determined 24
to 24
actions 24
immediately 24
by 24
a 24
purely 24
rational 24
law 24
sublime 24
even 24
is 24
the 24
illusion 24
that 24
regards 24
the 24
subjective 24
side 24
of 24
this 24
capacity 24
of 24
intellectual 24
determination 24
as 24
something 24
sensible 24
and 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
a 24
special 24
sensible 24
feeling 24
for 24
an 24
intellectual 24
feeling 24
would 24
be 24
a 24
contradiction 24
it 24
is 24
also 24
of 24
great 24
importance 24
to 24
attend 24
to 24
this 24
property 24
of 24
our 24
personality 24
and 24
as 24
much 24
as 24
possible 24
to 24
cultivate 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
reason 24
on 24
this 24
feeling 24
but 24
we 24
must 24
beware 24
lest 24
by 24
falsely 24
extolling 24
this 24
moral 24
determining 24
principle 24
as 24
a 24
spring 24
making 24
its 24
source 24
lie 24
in 24
particular 24
feelings 24
of 24
pleasure 24
which 24
are 24
in 24
fact 24
only 24
results 24
we 24
degrade 24
and 24
disfigure 24
the 24
true 24
genuine 24
spring 24
the 24
law 24
itself 24
by 24
putting 24
as 24
it 24
were 24
a 24
false 24
foil 24
upon 24
it 24
respect 24
not 24
pleasure 24
or 24
enjoyment 24
of 24
happiness 24
is 24
something 24
for 24
which 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
possible 24
that 24
reason 24
should 24
have 24
any 24
antecedent 24
feeling 24
as 24
its 24
foundation 24
for 24
this 24
would 24
always 24
be 24
sensible 24
and 24
pathological 24
and 24
consciousness 24
of 24
immediate 24
obligation 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
by 24
the 24
law 24
is 24
by 24
no 24
means 24
analogous 24
to 24
the 24
feeling 24
of 24
pleasure 24
although 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
it 24
produces 24
the 24
same 24
effect 24
but 24
from 24
different 24
sources 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
by 24
this 24
mode 24
of 24
conception 24
however 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
attain 24
what 24
we 24
are 24
seeking 24
namely 24
that 24
actions 24
be 24
done 24
not 24
merely 24
in 24
accordance 24
with 24
duty 24
as 24
a 24
result 24
of 24
pleasant 24
feelings 24
but 24
from 24
duty 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
the 24
true 24
end 24
of 24
all 24
moral 24
cultivation 24
have 24
we 24
not 24
however 24
a 24
word 24
which 24
does 24
not 24
express 24
enjoyment 24
as 24
happiness 24
does 24
but 24
indicates 24
a 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
ones 24
existence 24
an 24
analogue 24
of 24
the 24
happiness 24
which 24
must 24
necessarily 24
accompany 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
virtue 24
yes 24
this 24
word 24
is 24
selfcontentment 24
which 24
in 24
its 24
proper 24
signification 24
always 24
designates 24
only 24
a 24
negative 24
satisfaction 24
in 24
ones 24
existence 24
in 24
which 24
one 24
is 24
conscious 24
of 24
needing 24
nothing 24
freedom 24
and 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
faculty 24
of 24
following 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
with 24
unyielding 24
resolution 24
is 24
independence 24
of 24
inclinations 24
at 24
least 24
as 24
motives 24
determining 24
though 24
not 24
as 24
affecting 24
our 24
desire 24
and 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
i 24
am 24
conscious 24
of 24
this 24
freedom 24
in 24
following 24
my 24
moral 24
maxims 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
only 24
source 24
of 24
an 24
unaltered 24
contentment 24
which 24
is 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
with 24
it 24
and 24
rests 24
on 24
no 24
special 24
feeling 24
this 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
intellectual 24
contentment 24
the 24
sensible 24
contentment 24
improperly 24
socalled 24
which 24
rests 24
on 24
the 24
satisfaction 24
of 24
the 24
inclinations 24
however 24
delicate 24
they 24
may 24
be 24
imagined 24
to 24
be 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
adequate 24
to 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
it 24
for 24
the 24
inclinations 24
change 24
they 24
grow 24
with 24
the 24
indulgence 24
shown 24
them 24
and 24
always 24
leave 24
behind 24
a 24
still 24
greater 24
void 24
than 24
we 24
had 24
thought 24
to 24
fill 24
hence 24
they 24
are 24
always 24
burdensome 24
to 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24
and 24
although 24
he 24
cannot 24
lay 24
them 24
aside 24
they 24
wrest 24
from 24
him 24
the 24
wish 24
to 24
be 24
rid 24
of 24
them 24

an 24
inclination 24
to 24
what 24
is 24
right 24
eg 24
to 24
beneficence 24

it 24

much 24
facilitate 24
the 24
efficacy 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24

from 24
this 24
we 24
can 24
understand 24
how 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
this 24
faculty 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
produces 24
by 24
action 24
virtue 24
a 24
consciousness 24
of 24
mastery 24
over 24
ones 24
inclinations 24
and 24
therefore 24
of 24
independence 24
of 24
them 24
and 24
consequently 24
also 24
of 24
the 24
discontent 24
that 24
always 24
accompanies 24
them 24
and 24
thus 24
a 24
negative 24
satisfaction 24
with 24
ones 24
state 24
ie 24
contentment 24
which 24
is 24
primarily 24
contentment 24
with 24
ones 24
own 24
person 24
freedom 24
itself 24
becomes 24
in 24
this 24
way 24
namely 24
indirectly 24
capable 24
of 24
an 24
enjoyment 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
called 24
happiness 24
because 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
depend 24
on 24
the 24
positive 24
concurrence 24
of 24
a 24
feeling 24
nor 24
is 24
it 24
strictly 24
speaking 24
bliss 24
since 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
include 24
complete 24
independence 24
of 24
inclinations 24
and 24
wants 24
but 24
it 24
resembles 24
bliss 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
the 24
determination 24
of 24
ones 24
will 24
at 24
least 24
can 24
hold 24
itself 24
free 24
from 24
their 24
influence 24
and 24
thus 24
at 24
least 24
in 24
its 24
origin 24
this 24
enjoyment 24
is 24
analogous 24
to 24
the 24
selfsufficiency 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
ascribe 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
supreme 24
being 24
from 24
this 24
solution 24
of 24
the 24
antinomy 24
of 24
practical 24
pure 24
reason 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
in 24
practical 24
principles 24
we 24
may 24
at 24
least 24
conceive 24
as 24
possible 24
a 24
natural 24
and 24
necessary 24
connection 24
between 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
the 24
expectation 24
of 24
a 24
proportionate 24
happiness 24
as 24
its 24
result 24
though 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
follow 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
know 24
or 24
perceive 24
this 24
connection 24

on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
pursuit 24
of 24
happiness 24
cannot 24
possibly 24
produce 24
morality 24
that 24
therefore 24
morality 24
is 24
the 24
supreme 24
good 24
as 24
the 24
first 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24

second 24

only 24
in 24
such 24
a 24

it 24
is 24

only 24

the 24
whole 24

must 24
necessarily 24
conceive 24
it 24

it 24
commands 24
us 24

the 24

of 24

such 24

of 24

wholly 24

the 24
least 24
opposed 24
to 24

the 24

namely 24
that 24
this 24

arbitrary 24

if 24
they 24

close 24
its 24

strictly 24
and 24
admit 24
nothing 24
from 24
the 24
latter 24
into 24
its 24
domain 24
while 24
the 24
latter 24
would 24
extend 24
its 24
bounds 24
over 24
everything 24
and 24
when 24
its 24

us 24
to 24
affirm 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
second 24
element 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
viz 24
happiness 24
proportioned 24
to 24
that 24
morality 24

this 24
on 24
grounds 24
as 24
disinterested 24
as 24
before 24
and 24
solely 24
from 24
impartial 24
reason 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
must 24
lead 24
to 24
the 24
supposition 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
a 24
cause 24
adequate 24
to 24
this 24
effect 24
in 24
other 24
words 24
it 24
must 24
postulate 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
as 24
the 24
necessary 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
is 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
legislation 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
we 24
proceed 24
to 24
exhibit 24
this 24
connection 24
in 24
a 24
convincing 24
manner 24
happiness 24
is 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
a 24
rational 24
being 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
with 24
whom 24
everything 24
goes 24
according 24
to 24
his 24
wish 24
and 24
will 24
it 24
rests 24
therefore 24
on 24
the 24
harmony 24
of 24
physical 24
nature 24
with 24
his 24
whole 24
end 24
and 24
likewise 24
with 24
the 24
essential 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
his 24
will 24
now 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
freedom 24
commands 24
by 24
determining 24
principles 24
which 24
ought 24
to 24
be 24
quite 24
independent 24
of 24
nature 24
and 24
of 24
its 24
harmony 24
with 24
our 24
faculty 24
of 24
desire 24
as 24
springs 24
but 24
the 24
acting 24
rational 24
being 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
is 24
not 24
the 24

of 24
the 24

and 24
of 24
nature 24
itself 24
there 24
is 24
not 24
the 24
least 24
ground 24
therefore 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
for 24
a 24
necessary 24
connection 24
between 24
morality 24
and 24
proportionate 24
happiness 24
in 24
a 24

therefore 24

on 24
it 24

as 24

is 24
concerned 24
with 24
his 24

such 24
a 24

is 24
postulated 24
as 24

we 24
ought 24
to 24
endeavour 24
to 24
promote 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24

therefore 24
must 24
be 24
possible 24
accordingly 24
the 24

a 24

all 24

distinct 24
from 24

itself 24

containing 24
the 24

of 24
the 24
exact 24

of 24

with 24

is 24
also 24
postulated 24
now 24
this 24
supreme 24

must 24
contain 24
the 24
principle 24

not 24
merely 24
with 24
a 24
law 24
of 24
the 24

of 24
rational 24
beings 24
but 24
with 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
this 24
law 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
make 24
it 24
the 24
supreme 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24

consequently 24
not 24
merely 24
with 24
the 24
form 24

with 24

as 24
their 24
motive 24
that 24
is 24
with 24
their 24
moral 24
character 24
therefore 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
is 24
possible 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
only 24
on 24
the 24

a 24
supreme 24

having 24
a 24
causality 24
corresponding 24
to 24
moral 24
character 24
now 24
a 24

that 24

capable 24
of 24
acting 24
on 24
the 24
conception 24

such 24

according 24
to 24
this 24
conception 24
of 24

is 24
his 24
will 24
therefore 24
the 24
supreme 24
cause 24
of 24
nature 24
which 24
must 24
be 24
presupposed 24
as 24
a 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
is 24
a 24

which 24
is 24
the 24

will 24
consequently 24
its 24
author 24
that 24

god 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
the 24
postulate 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
highest 24

likewise 24
the 24

the 24
reality 24
of 24
a 24
highest 24
original 24
good 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
now 24
it 24
was 24
seen 24
to 24
be 24
a 24
duty 24
for 24
us 24
to 24
promote 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
consequently 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
merely 24
allowable 24
but 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
necessity 24
connected 24
with 24
duty 24
as 24
a 24
requisite 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
presuppose 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
this 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
as 24
this 24
is 24
possible 24
only 24
on 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
it 24
inseparably 24
connects 24
the 24
supposition 24
of 24
this 24
with 24
duty 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
is 24
morally 24
necessary 24
to 24
assume 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
it 24
must 24
be 24
remarked 24
here 24
that 24
this 24
moral 24
necessity 24
is 24
subjective 24
that 24
is 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
want 24
and 24
not 24
objective 24
that 24
is 24
itself 24
a 24
duty 24
for 24
there 24
cannot 24
be 24
a 24
duty 24
to 24
suppose 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
anything 24
since 24
this 24
concerns 24
only 24
the 24
theoretical 24
employment 24
of 24
reason 24
moreover 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
meant 24
by 24
this 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
necessary 24
to 24
suppose 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
as 24
a 24
basis 24
of 24
all 24
obligation 24
in 24
general 24
for 24
this 24
rests 24
as 24
has 24
been 24
sufficiently 24
proved 24
simply 24
on 24
the 24
autonomy 24
of 24
reason 24
itself 24
what 24
belongs 24
to 24
duty 24
here 24
is 24
only 24
the 24
endeavour 24
to 24
realize 24
and 24
promote 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
which 24
can 24
therefore 24
be 24
postulated 24
and 24
as 24
our 24
reason 24
finds 24
it 24
not 24
conceivable 24
except 24
on 24
the 24
supposition 24
of 24
a 24
supreme 24
intelligence 24
the 24
admission 24
of 24
this 24
existence 24
is 24
therefore 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
our 24
duty 24
although 24
the 24
admission 24
itself 24
belongs 24
to 24
the 24
domain 24
of 24
speculative 24
reason 24
considered 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
this 24
alone 24
as 24
a 24
principle 24
of 24
explanation 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
a 24
hypothesis 24
but 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
intelligibility 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
given 24
us 24
by 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
consequently 24
of 24
a 24
requirement 24
for 24
practical 24
purposes 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
called 24
faith 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
say 24
a 24
pure 24
rational 24
faith 24
since 24
pure 24
reason 24
both 24
in 24
its 24
theoretical 24
and 24
practical 24
use 24
is 24
the 24
sole 24
source 24
from 24
which 24
it 24
springs 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
from 24
this 24
deduction 24
it 24
is 24
now 24
intelligible 24
why 24
the 24
greek 24
schools 24
could 24
never 24
attain 24
the 24
solution 24
of 24
their 24
problem 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
because 24
they 24
made 24
the 24
rule 24
of 24
the 24
use 24
which 24
the 24
will 24
of 24
man 24
makes 24
of 24
his 24
freedom 24
the 24
sole 24
and 24
sufficient 24
ground 24
of 24
this 24
possibility 24
thinking 24
that 24
they 24
had 24
no 24
need 24
for 24
that 24
purpose 24
of 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
god 24
no 24
doubt 24
they 24
were 24
so 24
far 24
right 24
that 24
they 24
established 24
the 24
principle 24
of 24
morals 24
of 24
itself 24
independently 24
of 24
this 24
postulate 24
from 24
the 24
relation 24
of 24
reason 24
only 24
to 24
the 24
will 24
and 24
consequently 24
made 24
it 24
the 24
supreme 24
practical 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
but 24
it 24
was 24
not 24
therefore 24
the 24
whole 24
condition 24
of 24
its 24
possibility 24
the 24
epicureans 24
had 24
indeed 24
assumed 24
as 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
morality 24
a 24
wholly 24
false 24
one 24
namely 24
that 24
of 24
happiness 24
and 24
had 24
substituted 24
for 24
a 24
law 24
a 24
maxim 24
of 24
arbitrary 24
choice 24
according 24
to 24
every 24
mans 24
inclination 24
they 24
proceeded 24
however 24
consistently 24
enough 24
in 24
this 24
that 24
they 24
degraded 24
their 24
summum 24
bonum 24
likewise 24
just 24
in 24
proportion 24
to 24
the 24
meanness 24
of 24
their 24
fundamental 24
principle 24
and 24
looked 24
for 24
no 24
greater 24
happiness 24
than 24
can 24
be 24
attained 24
by 24
human 24
prudence 24
including 24
temperance 24
and 24
moderation 24
of 24
the 24
inclinations 24
and 24
this 24
as 24
we 24
know 24
would 24
be 24
scanty 24
enough 24
and 24
would 24
be 24
very 24
different 24
according 24
to 24
circumstances 24
not 24
to 24
mention 24
the 24
exceptions 24
that 24
their 24
maxims 24
must 24
perpetually 24
admit 24
and 24
which 24
make 24
them 24
incapable 24
of 24
being 24
laws 24
the 24
stoics 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
had 24
chosen 24
their 24
supreme 24
practical 24
principle 24
quite 24
rightly 24
making 24
virtue 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
but 24
when 24
they 24
represented 24
the 24
degree 24
of 24
virtue 24
required 24
by 24
its 24
pure 24
law 24
as 24
fully 24
attainable 24
in 24
this 24
life 24
they 24
not 24
only 24
strained 24
the 24
moral 24
powers 24
of 24
the 24
man 24
whom 24
they 24
called 24
the 24
wise 24
beyond 24
all 24
the 24
limits 24
of 24
his 24
nature 24
and 24
assumed 24
a 24
thing 24
that 24
contradicts 24
all 24
our 24
knowledge 24
of 24
men 24
but 24
also 24
and 24
principally 24
they 24
would 24
not 24
allow 24
the 24
second 24
element 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
namely 24
happiness 24
to 24
be 24
properly 24
a 24
special 24
object 24
of 24
human 24
desire 24
but 24
made 24
their 24
wise 24
man 24
like 24
a 24
divinity 24
in 24
his 24
consciousness 24
of 24
the 24
excellence 24
of 24
his 24
person 24
wholly 24
independent 24
of 24
nature 24
as 24
regards 24
his 24
own 24
contentment 24
they 24
exposed 24
him 24
indeed 24
to 24
the 24
evils 24
of 24
life 24
but 24
made 24
him 24
not 24
subject 24
to 24
them 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
representing 24
him 24
also 24
as 24
free 24
from 24
moral 24
evil 24
they 24
thus 24
in 24
fact 24
left 24
out 24
the 24
second 24
element 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
namely 24
personal 24
happiness 24
placing 24
it 24
solely 24
in 24
action 24
and 24
satisfaction 24
with 24
ones 24
own 24
personal 24
worth 24
thus 24
including 24
it 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
being 24
morally 24
minded 24
in 24
which 24
they 24
might 24
have 24
been 24
sufficiently 24
refuted 24
by 24
the 24
voice 24
of 24
their 24
own 24
nature 24
the 24
doctrine 24
of 24
christianity 24
even 24
if 24
we 24
do 24
not 24
yet 24
consider 24
it 24
as 24
a 24
religious 24
doctrine 24
gives 24
touching 24
this 24
point 24
a 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
the 24
kingdom 24
of 24
god 24
which 24
alone 24
satisfies 24
the 24
strictest 24
demand 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
holy 24
unyielding 24
and 24
demands 24
holiness 24
of 24
morals 24
although 24
all 24
the 24
moral 24
perfection 24
to 24
which 24
man 24
can 24
attain 24
is 24
still 24
only 24
virtue 24
that 24
is 24
a 24
rightful 24
disposition 24
arising 24
from 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
implying 24
consciousness 24
of 24
a 24
constant 24
propensity 24
to 24
transgression 24
or 24
at 24
least 24
a 24
want 24
of 24
purity 24
that 24
is 24
a 24
mixture 24
of 24
many 24
spurious 24
not 24
moral 24
motives 24
of 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
consequently 24
a 24
selfesteem 24
combined 24
with 24
humility 24
in 24
respect 24
then 24
of 24
the 24
holiness 24
which 24
the 24
christian 24
law 24
requires 24
this 24
leaves 24
the 24
creature 24
nothing 24
but 24
a 24
progress 24
in 24
infinitum 24
but 24
for 24
that 24
very 24
reason 24
it 24
justifies 24
him 24
in 24
hoping 24
for 24
an 24
endless 24
duration 24
of 24
his 24
existence 24
the 24
worth 24
of 24
a 24
character 24
perfectly 24
accordant 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
is 24
infinite 24
since 24
the 24
only 24
restriction 24
on 24
all 24
possible 24
happiness 24
in 24
the 24
judgement 24
of 24
a 24
wise 24
and 24
all 24
powerful 24
distributor 24
of 24
it 24
is 24
the 24
absence 24
of 24
conformity 24
of 24
rational 24
beings 24
to 24
their 24
duty 24
but 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
of 24
itself 24
does 24
not 24
promise 24
any 24
happiness 24
for 24
according 24
to 24
our 24
conceptions 24
of 24
an 24
order 24
of 24
nature 24
in 24
general 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
with 24
obedience 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
now 24
christian 24
morality 24
supplies 24
this 24
defect 24
of 24
the 24
second 24
indispensable 24
element 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
by 24
representing 24
the 24
world 24
in 24
which 24
rational 24
beings 24
devote 24
themselves 24
with 24
all 24
their 24
soul 24
to 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
as 24
a 24
kingdom 24
of 24
god 24
in 24
which 24
nature 24
and 24
morality 24
are 24
brought 24
into 24
a 24
harmony 24
foreign 24
to 24
each 24
of 24
itself 24
by 24
a 24
holy 24
author 24
who 24
makes 24
the 24
derived 24
summum 24
bonum 24
possible 24
holiness 24
of 24
life 24
is 24
prescribed 24
to 24
them 24
as 24
a 24
rule 24
even 24
in 24
this 24
life 24
while 24
the 24
welfare 24
proportioned 24
to 24
it 24
namely 24
bliss 24
is 24
represented 24
as 24
attainable 24
only 24
in 24
an 24
eternity 24
because 24
the 24
former 24
must 24
always 24
be 24
the 24
pattern 24
of 24
their 24
conduct 24
in 24
every 24
state 24
and 24
progress 24
towards 24
it 24
is 24
already 24
possible 24
and 24
necessary 24
in 24
this 24
life 24
while 24
the 24
latter 24
under 24
the 24
name 24
of 24
happiness 24
cannot 24
be 24
attained 24
at 24
all 24
in 24
this 24
world 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
our 24
own 24
power 24
is 24
concerned 24
and 24
therefore 24
is 24
made 24
simply 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
hope 24
nevertheless 24
the 24
christian 24
principle 24
of 24
morality 24
itself 24
is 24
not 24
theological 24
so 24
as 24
to 24
be 24
heteronomy 24
but 24
is 24
autonomy 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
since 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
make 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
his 24
will 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
these 24
laws 24
but 24
only 24
of 24
the 24
attainment 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
on 24
condition 24
of 24
following 24
these 24
laws 24
and 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
even 24
place 24
the 24
proper 24
spring 24
of 24
this 24
obedience 24
in 24
the 24
desired 24
results 24
but 24
solely 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
duty 24
as 24
that 24
of 24
which 24
the 24
faithful 24
observance 24
alone 24
constitutes 24
the 24
worthiness 24
to 24
obtain 24
those 24
happy 24
consequences 24
it 24
is 24
commonly 24
held 24
that 24
the 24
christian 24
precept 24
of 24
morality 24
has 24
no 24
advantage 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
purity 24
over 24
the 24
moral 24
conceptions 24
of 24
the 24
stoics 24
the 24
distinction 24
between 24
them 24
is 24
however 24
very 24
obvious 24
the 24
stoic 24
system 24
made 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
strength 24
of 24
mind 24
the 24
pivot 24
on 24
which 24
all 24
moral 24
dispositions 24
should 24
turn 24
and 24
although 24
its 24
disciples 24
spoke 24
of 24
duties 24
and 24
even 24
defined 24
them 24
very 24
well 24
yet 24
they 24
placed 24
the 24
spring 24
and 24
proper 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
in 24
an 24
elevation 24
of 24
the 24
mind 24
above 24
the 24
lower 24
springs 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
which 24
owe 24
their 24
power 24
only 24
to 24
weakness 24
of 24
mind 24
with 24
them 24
therefore 24
virtue 24
was 24
a 24
sort 24
of 24
heroism 24
in 24
the 24
wise 24
man 24
raising 24
himself 24
above 24
the 24
animal 24
nature 24
of 24
man 24
is 24
sufficient 24
for 24
himself 24
and 24
while 24
he 24
prescribes 24
duties 24
to 24
others 24
is 24
himself 24
raised 24
above 24
them 24
and 24
is 24
not 24
subject 24
to 24
any 24
temptation 24
to 24
transgress 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
all 24
this 24
however 24
they 24
could 24
not 24
have 24
done 24
if 24
they 24
had 24
conceived 24
this 24
law 24
in 24
all 24
its 24
purity 24
and 24
strictness 24
as 24
the 24
precept 24
of 24
the 24
gospel 24
does 24
when 24
i 24
give 24
the 24
name 24
idea 24
to 24
a 24
perfection 24
to 24
which 24
nothing 24
adequate 24
can 24
be 24
given 24
in 24
experience 24
it 24
does 24
not 24
follow 24
that 24
the 24
moral 24
ideas 24
are 24
thing 24
transcendent 24
that 24
is 24
something 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
even 24
determine 24
the 24
concept 24
adequately 24
or 24
of 24
which 24
it 24
is 24
uncertain 24
whether 24
there 24
is 24
any 24
object 24
corresponding 24
to 24
it 24
at 24
all 24
as 24
is 24
the 24
case 24
with 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
speculative 24
reason 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
being 24
types 24
of 24
practical 24
perfection 24
they 24
serve 24
as 24
the 24
indispensable 24
rule 24
of 24
conduct 24
and 24
likewise 24
as 24
the 24
standard 24
of 24
comparison 24
now 24
if 24
i 24
consider 24
christian 24
morals 24
on 24
their 24
philosophical 24
side 24
then 24
compared 24
with 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
the 24
greek 24
schools 24
they 24
would 24
appear 24
as 24
follows 24
the 24
ideas 24
of 24
the 24
cynics 24
the 24
epicureans 24
the 24
stoics 24
and 24
the 24
christians 24
are 24
simplicity 24
of 24
nature 24
prudence 24
wisdom 24
and 24
holiness 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
the 24
way 24
of 24
attaining 24
them 24
the 24
greek 24
schools 24
were 24
distinguished 24
from 24
one 24
another 24
thus 24
that 24
the 24
cynics 24
only 24
required 24
common 24
sense 24
the 24
others 24
the 24
path 24
of 24
science 24
but 24
both 24
found 24
the 24
mere 24
use 24
of 24
natural 24
powers 24
sufficient 24
for 24
the 24
purpose 24
christian 24
morality 24
because 24
its 24
precept 24
is 24
framed 24
as 24
a 24
moral 24
precept 24
must 24
be 24
so 24
pure 24
and 24
unyielding 24
takes 24
from 24
man 24
all 24
confidence 24
that 24
be 24
can 24
be 24
fully 24
adequate 24
to 24
it 24
at 24
least 24
in 24
this 24
life 24
but 24
again 24
sets 24
it 24
up 24
by 24
enabling 24
us 24
to 24
hope 24
that 24
if 24
we 24
act 24
as 24
well 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
our 24
power 24
to 24
do 24
then 24
what 24
is 24
not 24
in 24
our 24
power 24
will 24
come 24
in 24
to 24
our 24
aid 24
from 24
another 24
source 24
whether 24
we 24
know 24
how 24

be 24

conceptions 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
in 24
this 24
manner 24
the 24
moral 24
laws 24
lead 24
through 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
as 24
the 24
object 24
and 24
final 24
end 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
to 24
religion 24
that 24
is 24
to 24
the 24
recognition 24
of 24
all 24
duties 24
as 24
divine 24
commands 24
not 24
as 24
sanctions 24

arbitrary 24
ordinances 24
of 24
a 24
foreign 24

contingent 24
in 24
themselves 24
but 24
as 24
essential 24
laws 24
of 24
every 24
free 24
will 24
in 24
itself 24
which 24
nevertheless 24
must 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
commands 24
of 24
the 24
supreme 24
being 24
because 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
from 24
a 24
morally 24
perfect 24
holy 24

good 24
and 24
at 24
the 24
same 24

and 24
consequently 24
only 24
through 24
harmony 24
with 24
this 24
will 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
hope 24
to 24
attain 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
makes 24
it 24
our 24

all 24

neither 24

hope 24
being 24
made 24
the 24
fundamental 24
springs 24
which 24
if 24
taken 24
as 24
principles 24
would 24
destroy 24
the 24
whole 24
moral 24
worth 24
of 24
actions 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
commands 24
me 24
to 24
make 24
the 24
highest 24
possible 24
good 24
in 24
a 24
world 24
the 24
ultimate 24
object 24
of 24
all 24
my 24
conduct 24
but 24
i 24
cannot 24
hope 24
to 24
effect 24
this 24
otherwise 24
than 24
by 24
the 24
harmony 24
of 24
my 24
will 24
with 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
holy 24
and 24
good 24
author 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
and 24
although 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
as 24
a 24
whole 24
in 24
which 24
the 24
greatest 24
happiness 24
is 24
conceived 24
as 24
combined 24
in 24
the 24
most 24
exact 24
proportion 24
with 24
the 24
highest 24
degree 24
of 24
moral 24
perfection 24
possible 24
in 24
creatures 24
includes 24
my 24
own 24
happiness 24
yet 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
this 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
which 24
is 24
enjoined 24
to 24
promote 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
but 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
limits 24
by 24
strict 24
conditions 24
my 24
unbounded 24
desire 24
of 24
happiness 24
hence 24
also 24
morality 24
is 24
not 24
properly 24
the 24
doctrine 24
how 24
we 24
should 24
make 24
ourselves 24
happy 24
but 24
how 24
we 24
should 24
become 24
worthy 24
of 24
happiness 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
when 24
religion 24
is 24
added 24
that 24
there 24
also 24
comes 24
in 24
the 24
hope 24
of 24
participating 24
some 24
day 24
in 24
happiness 24
in 24
proportion 24
as 24
we 24
have 24
endeavoured 24
to 24
be 24
not 24
unworthy 24
of 24
it 24
a 24
man 24
is 24
worthy 24
to 24
possess 24
a 24
thing 24
or 24
a 24
state 24
when 24
his 24
possession 24
of 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
harmony 24
with 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
we 24
can 24
now 24
easily 24
see 24
that 24
all 24
worthiness 24
depends 24
on 24
moral 24
conduct 24
since 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
this 24
constitutes 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
the 24
rest 24
which 24
belongs 24
to 24
ones 24
state 24
namely 24
the 24
participation 24
of 24
happiness 24
now 24
it 24
follows 24
from 24
this 24
that 24
morality 24
should 24
never 24
be 24
treated 24
as 24
a 24
doctrine 24
of 24
happiness 24
that 24
is 24
an 24
instruction 24
how 24
to 24
become 24
happy 24
for 24
it 24
has 24
to 24
do 24
simply 24
with 24
the 24
rational 24
condition 24
conditio 24
sine 24
qua 24
non 24
of 24
happiness 24
not 24
with 24
the 24
means 24
of 24
attaining 24
it 24
but 24
when 24
morality 24
has 24
been 24
completely 24
expounded 24
which 24
merely 24
imposes 24
duties 24
instead 24
of 24
providing 24
rules 24
for 24
selfish 24
desires 24
then 24
first 24
after 24
the 24
moral 24
desire 24
to 24
promote 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
to 24
bring 24
the 24
kingdom 24
of 24
god 24
to 24
us 24
has 24
been 24
awakened 24
a 24
desire 24
founded 24
on 24
a 24
law 24
and 24
which 24
could 24
not 24
previously 24
arise 24
in 24
any 24
selfish 24
mind 24
and 24
when 24
for 24
the 24
behoof 24
of 24
this 24
desire 24
the 24
step 24
to 24
religion 24
has 24
been 24
taken 24
then 24
this 24
ethical 24
doctrine 24
may 24
be 24
also 24
called 24
a 24
doctrine 24
of 24
happiness 24
because 24
the 24
hope 24
of 24
happiness 24
first 24
begins 24
with 24
religion 24
only 24
we 24
can 24
also 24
see 24
from 24
this 24
that 24
when 24
we 24
ask 24
what 24
is 24
gods 24
ultimate 24
end 24
in 24
creating 24
the 24
world 24
we 24
must 24
not 24
name 24
the 24
happiness 24
of 24
the 24
rational 24
beings 24
in 24
it 24
but 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
adds 24
a 24
further 24
condition 24
to 24
that 24
wish 24
of 24
such 24
beings 24
namely 24
the 24
condition 24
of 24
being 24
worthy 24
of 24
happiness 24
that 24
is 24
the 24
morality 24
of 24
these 24
same 24
rational 24
beings 24
a 24
condition 24
which 24
alone 24
contains 24
the 24
rule 24
by 24
which 24
only 24
they 24
can 24
hope 24
to 24
share 24
in 24
the 24
former 24

the 24
hand 24
of 24
a 24
wise 24
author 24
for 24
as 24
wisdom 24
theoretically 24
considered 24
signifies 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
practically 24
the 24
accordance 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
with 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
we 24
cannot 24
attribute 24
to 24
a 24
supreme 24
independent 24
wisdom 24
an 24
end 24
based 24
merely 24
on 24
goodness 24
for 24
we 24
cannot 24
conceive 24
the 24
action 24
of 24
this 24
goodness 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
the 24

add 24
the 24
remark 24
that 24
whilst 24
we 24
ascribe 24
to 24
god 24
various 24
attributes 24
the 24
quality 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
also 24
find 24
applicable 24
to 24
creatures 24

that 24
in 24
him 24

are 24
raised 24

the 24

designations 24
of 24
omnipotence 24
omniscience 24
omnipresence 24
etc 24
there 24
are 24
three 24
that 24
are 24
ascribed 24
to 24
god 24
exclusively 24
and 24
yet 24
without 24
the 24
addition 24
of 24

and 24
which 24
are 24
all 24

the 24
only 24

the 24
only 24
blessed 24

only 24
wise 24

these 24
conceptions 24

imply 24
the 24
absence 24
of 24
limitation 24
in 24
the 24
order 24
of 24
these 24
attributes 24

everything 24

the 24

an 24

the 24

to 24

it 24
the 24

conception 24
of 24
a 24
substance 24
a 24
character 24
which 24
practical 24

furnishes 24
by 24
the 24

of 24
a 24

not 24
define 24

able 24

because 24
they 24
are 24
mere 24

no 24

consequently 24
by 24

in 24

postulated 24

the 24

the 24

could 24
not 24
assure 24
them 24
by 24
this 24
the 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
does 24
indeed 24
obtain 24
an 24
accession 24
but 24
it 24
consists 24
only 24
in 24
this 24
that 24
those 24
concepts 24
which 24
otherwise 24
it 24
had 24
to 24
look 24
upon 24
as 24
problematical 24
merely 24
thinkable 24
concepts 24
are 24
now 24
shown 24
assertorially 24
to 24
be 24
such 24
as 24
actually 24
have 24
objects 24
because 24
practical 24
reason 24
indispensably 24
requires 24
their 24
existence 24
for 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
its 24
object 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
which 24
practically 24
is 24
absolutely 24
necessary 24
and 24
this 24
justifies 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
in 24
assuming 24
them 24
but 24
this 24
extension 24
of 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
is 24
no 24
extension 24
of 24
speculative 24
that 24
is 24
we 24
cannot 24
make 24
any 24
positive 24
use 24
of 24
it 24
in 24
a 24
theoretical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
for 24
as 24
nothing 24
is 24
accomplished 24
in 24
this 24
by 24
practical 24
reason 24
further 24
than 24
that 24
these 24
concepts 24
are 24
real 24
and 24
actually 24
have 24
their 24
possible 24
objects 24

nothing 24
in 24
the 24
way 24
of 24

is 24
given 24
thereby 24
which 24
indeed 24
could 24
not 24
be 24
demanded 24
hence 24
the 24
admission 24
of 24
this 24
reality 24
does 24
not 24
render 24
any 24
synthetical 24
proposition 24
possible 24
consequently 24
this 24
discovery 24
does 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
least 24
help 24
us 24
to 24
extend 24
this 24
knowledge 24
of 24
ours 24
in 24
a 24
speculative 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
although 24
it 24
does 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
employment 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
the 24
above 24
three 24
ideas 24
of 24

are 24
still 24
in 24
themselves 24
not 24
cognitions 24
they 24
are 24
however 24
transcendent 24
thoughts 24
in 24
which 24
there 24
is 24
nothing 24
impossible 24
now 24
by 24
help 24
of 24
an 24
apodeictic 24
practical 24
law 24
being 24
necessary 24
conditions 24
of 24
that 24
which 24
it 24

to 24
be 24
made 24
an 24
object 24
they 24
acquire 24
objective 24
reality 24
that 24
is 24
we 24
learn 24
from 24
it 24
that 24
they 24
have 24
objects 24
without 24
being 24
able 24
to 24
point 24
out 24
how 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
them 24
is 24
related 24
to 24
an 24
object 24
and 24
this 24
too 24
is 24
still 24
not 24
a 24
cognition 24
of 24
these 24
objects 24
for 24
we 24
cannot 24
thereby 24
form 24
any 24
synthetical 24
judgement 24
about 24
them 24
nor 24
determine 24
their 24
application 24
theoretically 24
consequently 24
we 24
can 24
make 24
no 24
theoretical 24
rational 24
use 24
of 24
them 24
at 24
all 24
in 24
which 24
use 24
all 24
speculative 24
knowledge 24
of 24
reason 24
consists 24
nevertheless 24
the 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
not 24
indeed 24
of 24
these 24
objects 24
but 24
of 24
reason 24
generally 24
is 24
so 24
far 24
enlarged 24
by 24
this 24
that 24
by 24
the 24
practical 24
postulates 24
objects 24
were 24
given 24
to 24
those 24

this 24

first 24

there 24

therefore 24
no 24
extension 24
of 24
the 24

supersensible 24

but 24
an 24

its 24

in 24

as 24
it 24
is 24
compelled 24
to 24
admit 24
that 24
there 24
are 24
such 24

although 24
it 24

extend 24
this 24

of 24
the 24
objects 24
which 24
have 24
now 24
been 24
given 24
it 24
on 24
practical 24
grounds 24
and 24
only 24
for 24
practical 24
use 24
for 24
this 24
accession 24
then 24
pure 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
for 24
which 24
all 24
those 24
ideas 24
are 24
transcendent 24
and 24
without 24

simply 24

thank 24
its 24

possibility 24

realizing 24

object 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
whereas 24
apart 24
from 24
this 24
they 24
are 24
transcendent 24
and 24
merely 24
regulative 24
principles 24
of 24
speculative 24
reason 24
which 24
do 24
not 24
require 24
it 24
to 24
assume 24
a 24
new 24
object 24
beyond 24
experience 24
but 24
only 24
to 24
bring 24
its 24
use 24
in 24
experience 24
nearer 24
to 24
completeness 24
but 24
when 24
once 24
reason 24
is 24
in 24
possession 24
of 24
this 24
accession 24
it 24
will 24
go 24
to 24
work 24
with 24
these 24
ideas 24
as 24
speculative 24
reason 24
properly 24
only 24
to 24
assure 24
the 24
certainty 24
of 24
its 24
practical 24
use 24
in 24
a 24
negative 24
manner 24
that 24
is 24
not 24
extending 24
but 24
clearing 24
up 24
its 24
knowledge 24
so 24
as 24
on 24
one 24
side 24
to 24
keep 24
off 24
anthropomorphism 24
as 24
the 24
source 24
of 24
superstition 24
or 24
seeming 24
extension 24
of 24
these 24
conceptions 24
by 24
supposed 24
experience 24
and 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
side 24
fanaticism 24
which 24
promises 24
the 24
same 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
supersensible 24
intuition 24
or 24
feelings 24
of 24
the 24
like 24
kind 24
all 24
these 24
are 24
hindrances 24
to 24
the 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
so 24
that 24
the 24
removal 24
of 24
them 24
may 24
certainly 24
be 24
considered 24
an 24
extension 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
in 24
a 24
practical 24
point 24
of 24
view 24
without 24
contradicting 24
the 24
admission 24
that 24
for 24
speculative 24
purposes 24
reason 24
has 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
least 24
gained 24
by 24
this 24
every 24
employment 24
of 24
reason 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
an 24
object 24
requires 24
pure 24
concepts 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
categories 24
without 24
which 24
no 24
object 24
can 24
be 24
conceived 24
these 24
can 24
be 24
applied 24
to 24
the 24
theoretical 24
employment 24
of 24
reason 24
ie 24
to 24
that 24
kind 24
of 24
knowledge 24
only 24
in 24
case 24
an 24
intuition 24
which 24
is 24
always 24
sensible 24
is 24
taken 24
as 24
a 24
basis 24
and 24
therefore 24
merely 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
conceive 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
them 24
an 24
object 24
of 24
possible 24

now 24
here 24
what 24
have 24
to 24
be 24
thought 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
categories 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
be 24
known 24
are 24
ideas 24
of 24
reason 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
given 24
in 24
any 24
experience 24
only 24
we 24
are 24
not 24
here 24
concerned 24
with 24
the 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
objects 24
of 24
these 24
ideas 24
but 24
only 24
with 24
this 24
whether 24
they 24
have 24
objects 24
at 24
all 24
this 24
reality 24
is 24
supplied 24
by 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
and 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
has 24
nothing 24
further 24
to 24
do 24
in 24
this 24
but 24
to 24
think 24
those 24
objects 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
categories 24
this 24
as 24
we 24
have 24
elsewhere 24
clearly 24
shown 24
can 24
be 24
done 24
well 24
enough 24
without 24
needing 24
any 24
intuition 24
either 24
sensible 24
or 24
supersensible 24
because 24
the 24
categories 24
have 24
their 24
seat 24
and 24
origin 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
simply 24
as 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
thought 24
before 24
and 24
independently 24
of 24
any 24
intuition 24
and 24
they 24
always 24
only 24
signify 24
an 24
object 24
in 24
general 24
no 24
matter 24
in 24
what 24
way 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
given 24
to 24
us 24
now 24
when 24
the 24
categories 24
are 24
to 24
be 24
applied 24
to 24
these 24
ideas 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
possible 24
to 24
give 24
them 24
any 24
object 24
in 24
intuition 24
but 24
that 24
such 24
an 24
object 24
actually 24
exists 24
and 24
consequently 24
that 24
the 24
category 24
as 24
a 24
mere 24
form 24
of 24
thought 24
is 24
here 24
not 24
empty 24
but 24
has 24
significance 24
this 24
is 24
sufficiently 24
assured 24
them 24
by 24
an 24
object 24
which 24
practical 24
reason 24
presents 24
beyond 24
doubt 24
in 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
the 24
reality 24
of 24
the 24
conceptions 24
which 24
are 24
required 24
for 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
without 24
however 24
effecting 24
by 24
this 24
accession 24
the 24
least 24
extension 24
of 24
our 24
knowledge 24
on 24
theoretical 24
principles 24
when 24
these 24
ideas 24
of 24
god 24
of 24
an 24
intelligible 24
world 24
the 24
kingdom 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
of 24
immortality 24
are 24
further 24
determined 24
by 24
predicates 24
taken 24
from 24
our 24
own 24
nature 24
we 24
must 24
not 24
regard 24
this 24
determination 24
as 24
a 24
sensualizing 24
of 24
those 24
pure 24
rational 24
ideas 24
anthropomorphism 24
nor 24
as 24
a 24
transcendent 24
knowledge 24
of 24
supersensible 24
objects 24
for 24
these 24
predicates 24
are 24
no 24
others 24
than 24
understanding 24
and 24
will 24
considered 24
too 24
in 24
the 24
relation 24
to 24
each 24
other 24
in 24
which 24
they 24
must 24
be 24
conceived 24
in 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
therefore 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
use 24
is 24
made 24
of 24
them 24
as 24
to 24
all 24
the 24
rest 24
that 24
belongs 24
to 24
these 24
conceptions 24
psychologically 24
that 24
is 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
we 24
observe 24
these 24
faculties 24
of 24
ours 24
empirically 24
in 24
their 24
exercise 24
eg 24
that 24
the 24
understanding 24
of 24
man 24
is 24
discursive 24
and 24
its 24
notions 24
therefore 24
not 24
intuitions 24
but 24
thoughts 24
that 24
these 24
follow 24
one 24
another 24
in 24
time 24
that 24
his 24
will 24
has 24
its 24
satisfaction 24
always 24
dependent 24
on 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
its 24
object 24
etc 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
the 24
case 24
in 24
the 24
supreme 24
being 24
from 24
all 24
this 24
we 24
abstract 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
and 24
then 24
there 24
remains 24
of 24
the 24
notions 24
by 24
which 24
we 24
conceive 24
a 24
pure 24
intelligence 24
nothing 24
more 24
than 24
just 24
what 24
is 24
required 24
for 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
conceiving 24
a 24
moral 24
law 24
there 24
is 24
then 24
a 24
knowledge 24
of 24
god 24
indeed 24
but 24
only 24
for 24
practical 24
purposes 24
and 24
if 24
we 24
attempt 24
to 24
extend 24
it 24
to 24
a 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
we 24
find 24
an 24
understanding 24
that 24
has 24
intuitions 24
not 24
thoughts 24
a 24
will 24
that 24
is 24
directed 24
to 24
objects 24
on 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
which 24
its 24
satisfaction 24
does 24
not 24
in 24
the 24
least 24
depend 24
not 24
to 24
mention 24
the 24
transcendental 24
predicates 24
as 24
for 24
example 24
a 24
magnitude 24
of 24
existence 24
that 24
is 24
duration 24
which 24
however 24
is 24
not 24
in 24
time 24
the 24
only 24
possible 24
means 24
we 24
have 24
of 24
conceiving 24
existence 24
as 24
magnitude 24
now 24
these 24
are 24
all 24
attributes 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
form 24
no 24
conception 24
that 24
would 24
help 24
to 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
and 24
we 24
learn 24
from 24
this 24
that 24
they 24
can 24
never 24
be 24
used 24
for 24
a 24
theory 24
of 24
supersensible 24
beings 24
so 24
that 24
on 24
this 24
side 24
they 24
are 24
quite 24
incapable 24
of 24
being 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
a 24
speculative 24
knowledge 24
and 24
their 24
use 24
is 24
limited 24
simply 24
to 24
the 24
practice 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
this 24
last 24
is 24
so 24
obvious 24
and 24
can 24
be 24
proved 24
so 24
clearly 24
by 24
fact 24
that 24
we 24
may 24
confidently 24
challenge 24
all 24
pretended 24
natural 24
theologians 24
a 24
singular 24
name 24
to 24
specify 24
over 24
and 24
above 24
the 24
merely 24
ontological 24
predicates 24
one 24
single 24

this 24
object 24
of 24
theirs 24

which 24
we 24
could 24
not 24
show 24
incontrovertibly 24
that 24
if 24
we 24
abstract 24
from 24
it 24
everything 24
anthropomorphic 24
nothing 24
would 24
remain 24
to 24
us 24
but 24
the 24
mere 24
word 24
without 24
our 24
being 24
able 24
to 24
connect 24
with 24
it 24
the 24
smallest 24
notion 24
by 24
which 24
we 24
could 24
hope 24
for 24
an 24
extension 24
of 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
but 24
as 24
to 24
the 24
practical 24
there 24
still 24
remains 24
to 24
us 24
of 24
the 24
attributes 24
of 24
understanding 24
and 24
will 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
a 24
relation 24
to 24
which 24
objective 24
reality 24
is 24
given 24
by 24
the 24
practical 24
law 24
which 24
determines 24
a 24
priori 24
precisely 24
this 24
relation 24
of 24
the 24
understanding 24
to 24
the 24
will 24
when 24
once 24
this 24
is 24
done 24
then 24
reality 24
is 24
given 24
to 24
the 24
conception 24

this 24
would 24
be 24
contrary 24
to 24
the 24
signification 24
of 24
the 24
word 24
which 24
always 24
counts 24
as 24
learning 24
only 24
that 24
which 24
one 24
must 24
be 24
learned 24
and 24
which 24
therefore 24
he 24
cannot 24
discover 24
of 24
himself 24
by 24
reason 24
even 24
in 24
that 24
case 24
the 24
philosopher 24
would 24
make 24
too 24
poor 24
a 24
figure 24
with 24
his 24
knowledge 24
of 24
god 24
as 24
a 24
positive 24
science 24
to 24
let 24
himself 24
be 24
called 24
on 24
that 24
account 24
a 24
learned 24
man 24
according 24
to 24
these 24
remarks 24
it 24
is 24
now 24
easy 24
to 24
find 24
the 24
answer 24
to 24
the 24
weighty 24
question 24
whether 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
god 24
is 24
one 24
belonging 24
to 24
physics 24
and 24
therefore 24
also 24
to 24
metaphysics 24
which 24
contains 24
the 24
pure 24
a 24
priori 24
principles 24
of 24
the 24
former 24
in 24
their 24
universal 24
import 24
or 24
to 24
morals 24
if 24
we 24
have 24
recourse 24
to 24
god 24
as 24
the 24
author 24
of 24
all 24
things 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
explain 24
the 24
arrangements 24
of 24
nature 24
or 24
its 24
changes 24
this 24
is 24
at 24
least 24
not 24
a 24
physical 24
explanation 24
and 24
is 24
a 24
complete 24
confession 24
that 24
our 24
philosophy 24
has 24
come 24
to 24
an 24
end 24
since 24
we 24
are 24
obliged 24
to 24
assume 24
something 24
of 24
which 24
in 24
itself 24
we 24
have 24
otherwise 24
no 24
conception 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
be 24
able 24
to 24
frame 24
a 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
what 24
we 24
see 24
before 24
our 24
eyes 24
metaphysics 24
however 24
cannot 24
enable 24
us 24
to 24
attain 24
by 24
certain 24
inference 24
from 24
the 24
knowledge 24
of 24
this 24
world 24
to 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
god 24
and 24
to 24
the 24
proof 24
of 24
his 24
existence 24
for 24
this 24
reason 24
that 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
say 24
that 24
this 24
world 24
could 24
be 24
produced 24
only 24
by 24
a 24
god 24
according 24
to 24
the 24
conception 24
implied 24
by 24
this 24
word 24
we 24
should 24
know 24
this 24
world 24
as 24
the 24
most 24
perfect 24
whole 24
possible 24
and 24
for 24
this 24
purpose 24
should 24
also 24
know 24
all 24
possible 24
worlds 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
be 24
able 24
to 24
compare 24
them 24
with 24
this 24
in 24
other 24
words 24
we 24
should 24
be 24
omniscient 24
it 24
is 24
absolutely 24
impossible 24
however 24
to 24
know 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
this 24
being 24
from 24
mere 24
concepts 24
because 24
every 24
existential 24
proposition 24
that 24
is 24
every 24
proposition 24
that 24
affirms 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
a 24
being 24
of 24
which 24
i 24
frame 24
a 24
concept 24
is 24
a 24
synthetic 24
proposition 24
that 24
is 24
one 24
by 24
which 24
i 24
go 24
beyond 24
that 24
conception 24
and 24
affirm 24
of 24
it 24
more 24
than 24
was 24
thought 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
itself 24
namely 24
that 24
this 24
concept 24
in 24
the 24
understanding 24
has 24
an 24
object 24
corresponding 24
to 24
it 24
outside 24
the 24
understanding 24
and 24
this 24
it 24
is 24
obviously 24
impossible 24
to 24
elicit 24
by 24
any 24
reasoning 24
there 24
remains 24
therefore 24
only 24
one 24
single 24
process 24
possible 24
for 24
reason 24
to 24
attain 24
this 24
knowledge 24
namely 24
to 24
start 24
from 24
the 24
supreme 24
principle 24
of 24
its 24
pure 24
practical 24
use 24
which 24
in 24
every 24
case 24
is 24
directed 24
simply 24
to 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
something 24
as 24
a 24
consequence 24
of 24
reason 24
and 24
thus 24
determine 24
its 24
object 24
then 24
its 24
inevitable 24
problem 24
namely 24
the 24
necessary 24
direction 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
to 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
discovers 24
to 24
us 24
not 24
only 24
the 24
necessity 24
of 24
assuming 24
such 24
a 24
first 24
being 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
this 24
good 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
but 24
what 24
is 24
most 24
remarkable 24
something 24
which 24
reason 24
in 24
its 24
progress 24
on 24
the 24
path 24
of 24
physical 24
nature 24
altogether 24
failed 24
to 24
find 24
namely 24
an 24
accurately 24
defined 24
conception 24
of 24
this 24
first 24
being 24
as 24
we 24
can 24
know 24
only 24
a 24
small 24
part 24
of 24
this 24
world 24
and 24
can 24
still 24
less 24
compare 24
it 24
with 24
all 24
possible 24
worlds 24
we 24
may 24
indeed 24
from 24
its 24
order 24
design 24
and 24
greatness 24
infer 24
a 24
wise 24
good 24
powerful 24
etc 24
author 24
of 24
it 24
but 24
not 24
that 24
he 24
is 24
allwise 24
allgood 24
allpowerful 24
etc 24
it 24
may 24
indeed 24
very 24
well 24
be 24
granted 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
be 24
justified 24
in 24
supplying 24
this 24
inevitable 24
defect 24
by 24
a 24
legitimate 24
and 24
reasonable 24
hypothesis 24
namely 24
that 24
when 24
wisdom 24
goodness 24
etc 24
are 24
displayed 24
in 24
all 24
the 24
parts 24
that 24
offer 24
themselves 24
to 24
our 24
nearer 24
knowledge 24
it 24
is 24
just 24
the 24
same 24
in 24
all 24
the 24
rest 24
and 24
that 24
it 24
would 24
therefore 24
be 24
reasonable 24
to 24
ascribe 24
all 24
possible 24
perfections 24
to 24
the 24
author 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
but 24
these 24
are 24
not 24
strict 24
logical 24
inferences 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
pride 24
ourselves 24
on 24
our 24
insight 24
but 24
only 24
permitted 24
conclusions 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
may 24
be 24
indulged 24
and 24
which 24
require 24
further 24
recommendation 24
before 24
we 24
can 24
make 24
use 24
of 24
them 24
on 24
the 24
path 24
of 24
empirical 24
inquiry 24
then 24
physics 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
god 24
remains 24
always 24
a 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
perfection 24
of 24
the 24
first 24
being 24
not 24
accurately 24
enough 24
determined 24
to 24
be 24
held 24
adequate 24
to 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
deity 24
with 24
metaphysic 24
in 24
its 24
transcendental 24
part 24
nothing 24
whatever 24
can 24
be 24
accomplished 24
bookchapter 24
paragraph 24
when 24
i 24
now 24
try 24
to 24
test 24
this 24
conception 24
by 24
reference 24
to 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
practical 24
reason 24
i 24
find 24
that 24
the 24
moral 24
principle 24
admits 24
as 24
possible 24
only 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
an 24
author 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
possessed 24
of 24
the 24
highest 24
perfection 24
he 24
must 24
be 24
omniscient 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
know 24
my 24
conduct 24
up 24
to 24
the 24
inmost 24
root 24
of 24
my 24
mental 24
state 24
in 24
all 24
possible 24
cases 24
and 24
into 24
all 24
future 24
time 24
omnipotent 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
allot 24
to 24
it 24
its 24
fitting 24
consequences 24
similarly 24
he 24
must 24
be 24
omnipresent 24
eternal 24
etc 24
thus 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
by 24
means 24
of 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
as 24
the 24
object 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
determines 24
the 24
concept 24
of 24
the 24
first 24
being 24
as 24
the 24
supreme 24
being 24
a 24
thing 24
which 24
the 24
physical 24
and 24
in 24
its 24
higher 24
development 24
the 24
metaphysical 24
in 24
other 24
words 24
the 24
whole 24
speculative 24
course 24
of 24
reason 24
was 24
unable 24
to 24
effect 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
god 24
then 24
is 24
one 24
that 24
belongs 24
originally 24
not 24
to 24
physics 24
ie 24
to 24
speculative 24
reason 24
but 24
to 24
morals 24
the 24
same 24
may 24
be 24
said 24
of 24
the 24
other 24
conceptions 24
of 24
reason 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
treated 24
above 24
as 24
postulates 24
of 24
it 24
in 24
its 24
practical 24
use 24
in 24
the 24
history 24
of 24
grecian 24
philosophy 24
we 24
find 24
no 24
distinct 24
traces 24
of 24
a 24
pure 24
rational 24
theology 24
earlier 24
than 24
anaxagoras 24
but 24
this 24
is 24
not 24
because 24
the 24
older 24
philosophers 24
had 24
not 24
intelligence 24
or 24
penetration 24
enough 24
to 24
raise 24
themselves 24
to 24
it 24
by 24
the 24
path 24
of 24
speculation 24
at 24
least 24
with 24
the 24
aid 24
of 24
a 24
thoroughly 24
reasonable 24
hypothesis 24
what 24
could 24
have 24
been 24
easier 24
what 24
more 24
natural 24
than 24
the 24
thought 24
which 24
of 24
itself 24
occurs 24
to 24
everyone 24
to 24
assume 24
instead 24
of 24
several 24
causes 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
instead 24
of 24
an 24
indeterminate 24
degree 24
of 24
perfection 24
a 24
single 24
rational 24
cause 24
having 24
all 24
perfection 24
but 24
the 24
evils 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
seemed 24
to 24
them 24
to 24
be 24
much 24
too 24
serious 24
objections 24
to 24
allow 24
them 24
to 24
feel 24
themselves 24
justified 24
in 24
such 24
a 24
hypothesis 24
they 24
showed 24
intelligence 24
and 24
penetration 24
then 24
in 24
this 24
very 24
point 24
that 24
they 24
did 24
not 24
allow 24
themselves 24
to 24
adopt 24
it 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
looked 24
about 24
amongst 24
natural 24
causes 24
to 24
see 24
if 24
they 24
could 24
not 24
find 24
in 24
them 24
the 24
qualities 24
and 24
power 24
required 24
for 24
a 24
first 24
being 24
but 24
when 24
this 24
acute 24
people 24
had 24
advanced 24
so 24
far 24
in 24
their 24
investigations 24
of 24
nature 24
as 24
to 24
treat 24
even 24
moral 24
questions 24
philosophically 24
on 24
which 24
other 24
nations 24
had 24
never 24
done 24
anything 24
but 24
talk 24
then 24
first 24
they 24
found 24
a 24
new 24
and 24
practical 24
want 24
which 24
did 24
not 24
fail 24
to 24
give 24
definiteness 24
to 24
their 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
first 24
being 24
and 24
in 24
this 24
the 24
speculative 24
reason 24
played 24
the 24
part 24
of 24
spectator 24
or 24
at 24
best 24
had 24
the 24
merit 24
of 24
embellishing 24
a 24
conception 24
that 24
had 24
not 24
grown 24
on 24
its 24
own 24
ground 24
and 24
of 24
applying 24
a 24
series 24
of 24
confirmations 24
from 24
the 24
study 24
of 24
nature 24
now 24
brought 24
forward 24
for 24
the 24
first 24
time 24
not 24
indeed 24
to 24
strengthen 24
the 24
authority 24
of 24
this 24
conception 24
which 24
was 24
already 24
established 24
but 24
rather 24
to 24
make 24

supposed 24
discovery 24

the 24
reader 24
of 24
the 24
critique 24

will 24
be 24
thoroughly 24
convinced 24
how 24
highly 24
necessary 24
that 24
laborious 24
deduction 24
of 24
the 24
categories 24
was 24
and 24
how 24
fruitful 24
for 24
theology 24
and 24
morals 24
for 24
if 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
hand 24
we 24
place 24
them 24
in 24
pure 24
understanding 24
it 24
is 24
by 24
this 24
deduction 24
alone 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
be 24
prevented 24
from 24
regarding 24
them 24
with 24
plato 24
as 24
innate 24
and 24
founding 24
on 24
them 24
extravagant 24
pretensions 24
to 24
theories 24
of 24
the 24
supersensible 24
to 24
which 24
we 24
can 24
see 24
no 24
end 24
and 24
by 24
which 24
we 24
should 24
make 24
theology 24
a 24
magic 24
lantern 24
of 24
chimeras 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
if 24
we 24
regard 24
them 24
as 24
acquired 24
this 24
deduction 24
saves 24
us 24
from 24
restricting 24
with 24
epicurus 24
all 24
and 24
every 24
use 24
of 24
them 24
even 24
for 24
practical 24
purposes 24
to 24
the 24
objects 24
and 24
motives 24
of 24
the 24
senses 24
but 24
now 24
that 24
the 24
critique 24
has 24
shown 24
by 24
that 24
deduction 24
first 24
that 24
they 24
are 24
not 24
of 24
empirical 24
origin 24
but 24
have 24
their 24
seat 24
and 24
source 24
a 24
priori 24
in 24
the 24
pure 24
understanding 24
secondly 24
that 24
as 24
they 24
refer 24
to 24
objects 24
in 24
general 24
independently 24
of 24
the 24
intuition 24
of 24
them 24
hence 24
although 24
they 24
cannot 24
effect 24
theoretical 24
knowledge 24
except 24
in 24
application 24
to 24
empirical 24
objects 24
yet 24
when 24
applied 24
to 24
an 24
object 24
given 24
by 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
they 24
enable 24
us 24
to 24
conceive 24
the 24
supersensible 24
definitely 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
however 24
as 24
it 24
is 24
defined 24
by 24
such 24
predicates 24
as 24
are 24
necessarily 24
connected 24
with 24
the 24
pure 24
practical 24
purpose 24
given 24
a 24
priori 24
and 24
with 24
its 24
possibility 24
the 24
speculative 24
restriction 24
of 24
pure 24
reason 24
and 24
its 24
practical 24
extension 24
bring 24
it 24
into 24
that 24
relation 24
of 24
equality 24
in 24
which 24
reason 24
in 24
general 24
can 24
be 24
employed 24
suitably 24
to 24
its 24
end 24
and 24
this 24
example 24
proves 24
better 24
than 24
any 24
other 24
that 24
the 24
path 24
to 24
wisdom 24
if 24
it 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
made 24
sure 24
and 24
not 24
to 24
be 24
impassable 24

must 24
with 24
us 24
men 24
inevitably 24
pass 24
through 24
science 24
but 24
it 24
is 24
not 24
till 24
this 24
is 24
complete 24
that 24
we 24
can 24
be 24
convinced 24
that 24
it 24
leads 24

satisfy 24

inquiring 24

resort 24

assure 24
myself 24
of 24
their 24
reality 24
but 24
to 24
explain 24
them 24
i 24
have 24
to 24
presuppose 24
a 24
deity 24
as 24
their 24
cause 24
and 24
then 24
since 24
the 24
inference 24
from 24
an 24
effect 24
to 24
a 24
definite 24
cause 24
is 24
always 24

a 24

perfectly 24
defined 24

we 24

hence 24
the 24
highest 24
degree 24
of 24
certainty 24
to 24
which 24
this 24
presupposition 24
can 24
be 24

that 24
it 24

a 24

making 24
something 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
the 24

of 24
my 24
will 24

as 24
to 24
promote 24
it 24
with 24
all 24
my 24
powers 24
in 24
which 24
case 24
i 24
must 24
suppose 24
its 24
possibility 24

consequently 24
also 24
the 24
conditions 24
necessary 24
thereto 24
namely 24
god 24
freedom 24
and 24
immortality 24
since 24
i 24
cannot 24
prove 24
these 24
by 24
my 24
speculative 24
reason 24
although 24
neither 24
can 24
i 24
refute 24
them 24
this 24
duty 24
is 24
founded 24

something 24
that 24
is 24
indeed 24
quite 24
independent 24
of 24
these 24
suppositions 24

is 24
of 24
itself 24
apodeictically 24
certain 24
namely 24
the 24
moral 24

it 24

further 24

no 24

a 24
chimera 24
of 24
his 24
own 24
brain 24
would 24
fain 24
conclude 24
that 24
such 24
an 24
object 24
really 24
exists 24
somewhere 24
i 24
quite 24
agree 24
with 24
him 24
in 24
this 24
in 24
all 24
cases 24
where 24
the 24
want 24
is 24
founded 24
on 24
inclination 24
which 24
cannot 24
necessarily 24
postulate 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
its 24
object 24
even 24
for 24
the 24
man 24
that 24
is 24
affected 24
by 24
it 24
much 24
less 24
can 24
it 24
contain 24
a 24
demand 24
valid 24
for 24
everyone 24
and 24
therefore 24
it 24
is 24
merely 24
a 24
subjective 24
ground 24
of 24
the 24
wish 24
but 24
in 24
the 24
present 24
case 24
we 24
have 24
a 24
want 24
of 24
reason 24
springing 24
from 24
an 24
objective 24
determining 24
principle 24
of 24
the 24
will 24
namely 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
which 24
necessarily 24
binds 24
every 24
rational 24
being 24
and 24
therefore 24
justifies 24
him 24
in 24
assuming 24
a 24
priori 24
in 24
nature 24
the 24
conditions 24
proper 24
for 24
it 24
and 24
makes 24
the 24
latter 24
inseparable 24
from 24
the 24
complete 24
practical 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
duty 24
to 24
realize 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
to 24
the 24
utmost 24
of 24
our 24
power 24
therefore 24
it 24
must 24
be 24
possible 24
consequently 24
it 24
is 24
unavoidable 24
for 24
every 24
rational 24
being 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
to 24
assume 24
what 24
is 24
necessary 24
for 24
its 24
objective 24
possibility 24
the 24
assumption 24
is 24
as 24
necessary 24
as 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
in 24
connection 24
with 24
which 24
alone 24
it 24
is 24
valid 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
prevent 24
misconception 24
in 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
a 24
notion 24
as 24
yet 24
so 24
unusual 24
as 24
that 24
of 24
a 24
faith 24
of 24
pure 24
practical 24
reason 24
let 24
me 24
be 24
permitted 24
to 24
add 24
one 24
more 24
remark 24
it 24
might 24
almost 24
seem 24
as 24
if 24
this 24
rational 24
faith 24
were 24
here 24
announced 24
as 24
itself 24
a 24
command 24
namely 24
that 24
we 24
should 24
assume 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
as 24
possible 24
but 24
a 24
faith 24
that 24
is 24
commanded 24
is 24
nonsense 24
let 24
the 24
preceding 24
analysis 24
however 24
be 24
remembered 24
of 24
what 24
is 24
required 24
to 24
be 24
supposed 24
in 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
and 24
it 24
will 24
be 24
seen 24
that 24
it 24
cannot 24
be 24
commanded 24
to 24
assume 24
this 24
possibility 24
and 24
no 24
practical 24
disposition 24
of 24
mind 24
is 24
required 24
to 24
admit 24
it 24
but 24
that 24
speculative 24
reason 24
must 24
concede 24
it 24
without 24
being 24
asked 24
for 24
no 24
one 24
can 24
affirm 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
impossible 24
in 24
itself 24
that 24
rational 24
beings 24
in 24
the 24
world 24
should 24
at 24
the 24
same 24
time 24
be 24
worthy 24
of 24
happiness 24
in 24
conformity 24
with 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
and 24
also 24
possess 24
this 24
happiness 24
proportionately 24
now 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
the 24
first 24
element 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
namely 24
that 24
which 24
concerns 24
morality 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
gives 24
merely 24
a 24
command 24
and 24
to 24
doubt 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
that 24
element 24
would 24
be 24
the 24
same 24
as 24
to 24
call 24
in 24
question 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
itself 24
but 24
as 24
regards 24
the 24
second 24
element 24
of 24
that 24
object 24
namely 24
happiness 24
perfectly 24
proportioned 24
to 24
that 24
worthiness 24
it 24
is 24
true 24
that 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
need 24
of 24
a 24
command 24
to 24
admit 24
its 24
possibility 24
in 24
general 24
for 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
has 24
nothing 24
to 24
say 24
against 24
it 24
but 24
the 24
manner 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
to 24
conceive 24
this 24
harmony 24
of 24
the 24
laws 24
of 24
nature 24
with 24
those 24
of 24
freedom 24

in 24
it 24
something 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
which 24
we 24
have 24
a 24
choice 24
because 24
theoretical 24
reason 24
decides 24
nothing 24
with 24
apodeictic 24
certainty 24
about 24
it 24
and 24
in 24
respect 24
of 24
this 24
there 24
may 24
be 24
a 24
moral 24
interest 24
which 24
turns 24
the 24
scale 24

had 24
said 24
above 24
that 24
in 24
a 24
mere 24
course 24
of 24
nature 24

the 24
world 24
an 24
accurate 24
correspondence 24

moral 24
worth 24

not 24
to 24
be 24
expected 24

must 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
impossible 24

that 24
therefore 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
the 24
summum 24
bonum 24
cannot 24
be 24
admitted 24
from 24
this 24
side 24
except 24
on 24
the 24
supposition 24
of 24
a 24
moral 24
author 24
of 24
the 24

purposely 24

the 24

it 24
until 24
the 24
manner 24
of 24
this 24
belief 24
should 24
be 24
defined 24
more 24
precisely 24
the 24
fact 24
is 24
that 24
the 24
impossibility 24
referred 24

merely 24
subjective 24

even 24
that 24

would 24
cease 24

it 24

thus 24

a 24
very 24
obscure 24

doubtful 24
view 24
into 24
the 24

when 24
the 24

allows 24
us 24
only 24
to 24
conjecture 24
his 24

his 24
majesty 24

behold 24

disinterested 24
respect 24

only 24
when 24
this 24
respect 24
has 24
become 24
active 24

dominant 24
does 24
it 24
allow 24
us 24
by 24

a 24
prospect 24

there 24

for 24
true 24
moral 24
disposition 24
immediately 24
devoted 24
to 24
the 24
law 24
and 24
a 24
rational 24
creature 24
can 24
become 24
worthy 24

sharing 24
in 24
the 24
summum 24

corresponds 24
to 24
the 24

not 24
merely 24
to 24
his 24

what 24

well 24

that 24
the 24

wisdom 24
by 24

not 24

moral 24
goodness 24
some 24
preparatory 24

these 24

some 24
effect 24

it 24

a 24
man 24
to 24
feel 24
his 24

the 24

a 24
power 24
unexpected 24

himself 24

himself 24
from 24
all 24

intention 24

arguing 24
away 24
virtue 24
altogether 24
out 24
of 24
all 24
human 24
examples 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
make 24
it 24
an 24
empty 24
name 24
often 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
wellmeant 24
strictness 24
in 24
determining 24
the 24
true 24
moral 24
import 24
of 24
actions 24
according 24
to 24
an 24
uncompromising 24
law 24
comparison 24
with 24
such 24
a 24
law 24
instead 24
of 24
with 24
examples 24
lowers 24
selfconceit 24
in 24
moral 24
matters 24
very 24
much 24
and 24
not 24
merely 24
teaches 24
humility 24
but 24
makes 24
every 24
one 24
feel 24
it 24
when 24
he 24
examines 24
himself 24
closely 24
nevertheless 24
we 24
can 24
for 24
the 24
most 24
part 24
observe 24
in 24
those 24
who 24
defend 24
the 24
purity 24
of 24
purpose 24
in 24
giving 24
examples 24
that 24
where 24
there 24
is 24
the 24
presumption 24
of 24
uprightness 24
they 24
are 24
anxious 24
to 24
remove 24
even 24
the 24
least 24
spot 24
lest 24
if 24
all 24
examples 24
had 24
their 24
truthfulness 24
disputed 24
and 24
if 24
the 24
purity 24
of 24
all 24
human 24
virtue 24
were 24
denied 24
it 24
might 24
in 24
the 24
end 24
be 24
regarded 24
as 24
a 24
mere 24
phantom 24
and 24
so 24
all 24
effort 24
to 24
attain 24
it 24
be 24
made 24
light 24
of 24
as 24
vain 24
affectation 24
and 24
delusive 24
conceit 24
i 24
do 24
not 24
know 24
why 24
the 24
educators 24
of 24
youth 24
have 24
not 24
long 24
since 24
made 24
use 24
of 24
this 24
propensity 24
of 24
reason 24
to 24
enter 24
with 24
pleasure 24
upon 24
the 24
most 24
subtle 24
examination 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
questions 24
that 24
are 24
thrown 24
up 24
and 24
why 24
they 24
have 24
not 24
after 24
first 24
laying 24
the 24
foundation 24
of 24
a 24
purely 24
moral 24
catechism 24
searched 24
through 24
the 24
biographies 24
of 24
ancient 24
and 24
modern 24
times 24
with 24
the 24
view 24
of 24
having 24
at 24
hand 24
instances 24
of 24
the 24
duties 24
laid 24
down 24
in 24
which 24
especially 24
by 24
comparison 24
of 24
similar 24
actions 24
under 24
different 24
circumstances 24
they 24
might 24
exercise 24
the 24
critical 24
judgement 24
of 24
their 24
scholars 24
in 24
remarking 24
their 24
greater 24
or 24
less 24
moral 24
significance 24
this 24
is 24
a 24
thing 24
in 24
which 24
they 24
would 24
find 24
that 24
even 24
early 24
youth 24
which 24
is 24
still 24
unripe 24
for 24
speculation 24
of 24
other 24
kinds 24
would 24
soon 24
become 24
very 24
acute 24
and 24
not 24
a 24
little 24
interested 24
because 24
it 24
feels 24
the 24
progress 24
of 24
its 24
faculty 24
of 24
judgement 24
and 24
what 24
is 24
most 24
important 24
they 24
could 24
hope 24
with 24
confidence 24
that 24
the 24
frequent 24
practice 24
of 24
knowing 24
and 24
approving 24
good 24
conduct 24
in 24
all 24
its 24
purity 24
and 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
hand 24
of 24
remarking 24
with 24
regret 24
or 24
contempt 24
the 24
least 24
deviation 24
from 24
it 24
although 24
it 24
may 24
be 24
pursued 24
only 24
as 24
a 24
sport 24
in 24
which 24
children 24
may 24
compete 24
with 24
one 24
another 24
yet 24
will 24
leave 24
a 24
lasting 24
impression 24
of 24
esteem 24
on 24
the 24
one 24
hand 24
and 24
disgust 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
and 24
so 24
by 24
the 24
mere 24
habit 24
of 24
looking 24
on 24
such 24
actions 24
as 24
deserving 24
approval 24
or 24
blame 24
a 24
good 24
foundation 24
would 24
be 24
laid 24
for 24
uprightness 24
in 24
the 24
future 24
course 24
of 24
life 24
only 24
i 24
wish 24
they 24
would 24
spare 24
them 24
the 24
example 24
of 24
socalled 24
noble 24
supermeritorious 24
actions 24
in 24
which 24
our 24
sentimental 24
books 24
so 24
much 24
abound 24
and 24
would 24
refer 24
all 24
to 24
duty 24
merely 24
and 24
to 24
the 24
worth 24
that 24
a 24
man 24
can 24
and 24
must 24
give 24
himself 24
in 24
his 24
own 24
eyes 24
by 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
not 24
having 24
transgressed 24
it 24
since 24
whatever 24
runs 24
up 24
into 24
empty 24
wishes 24
and 24
longings 24
after 24
inaccessible 24
perfection 24
produces 24
mere 24
heroes 24
of 24
romance 24
who 24
while 24
they 24
pique 24
themselves 24
on 24
their 24
feeling 24
for 24
transcendent 24
greatness 24
release 24
themselves 24
in 24
return 24
from 24
the 24
observance 24
of 24
common 24
and 24
everyday 24
obligations 24
which 24
then 24
seem 24
to 24
them 24
petty 24
and 24
insignificant 24
it 24
is 24
quite 24
proper 24
to 24
extol 24
actions 24
that 24
display 24
a 24
great 24
unselfish 24
sympathizing 24
mind 24
or 24
humanity 24
but 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
we 24
must 24
fix 24
attention 24
not 24
so 24
much 24
on 24
the 24
elevation 24
of 24
soul 24
which 24
is 24
very 24
fleeting 24

which 24
a 24
more 24
enduring 24
impression 24
may 24
be 24
expected 24
because 24
this 24
implies 24
principle 24
whereas 24
the 24
former 24
only 24
implies 24

for 24
to 24
common 24
sense 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
decided 24
long 24
ago 24
not 24
indeed 24
by 24
abstract 24
general 24
formulae 24
but 24
by 24
habitual 24
use 24
like 24
the 24
distinction 24
between 24
the 24
right 24
and 24
left 24
hand 24
we 24
will 24
then 24
point 24
out 24
the 24
criterion 24
of 24
pure 24
virtue 24
in 24
an 24
example 24
first 24
and 24
imagining 24
that 24
it 24
is 24
set 24
before 24
a 24
boy 24
of 24
say 24
ten 24
years 24
old 24
for 24
his 24
judgement 24
we 24
will 24
see 24
whether 24
he 24
would 24
necessarily 24
judge 24
so 24
of 24
himself 24
without 24
being 24
guided 24
by 24
his 24
teacher 24
tell 24
him 24
the 24
history 24
of 24
an 24
honest 24
man 24
whom 24
men 24
want 24
to 24
persuade 24
to 24
join 24
the 24
calumniators 24
of 24
an 24
innocent 24
and 24
powerless 24
person 24
say 24
anne 24
boleyn 24
accused 24
by 24
henry 24
viii 24
of 24
england 24
he 24
is 24
offered 24
advantages 24
great 24
gifts 24
or 24
high 24
rank 24
he 24
rejects 24
them 24
this 24
will 24
excite 24
mere 24
approbation 24
and 24
applause 24
in 24
the 24
mind 24
of 24
the 24
hearer 24
now 24
begins 24
the 24
threatening 24
of 24
loss 24
amongst 24
these 24
traducers 24
are 24
his 24
best 24
friends 24
who 24
now 24
renounce 24
his 24
friendship 24
near 24
kinsfolk 24
who 24
threaten 24
to 24
disinherit 24
him 24
he 24
being 24
without 24
fortune 24
powerful 24
persons 24
who 24
can 24
persecute 24
and 24
harass 24
him 24
in 24
all 24
places 24
and 24
circumstances 24
a 24
prince 24
who 24
threatens 24
him 24
with 24
loss 24
of 24
freedom 24
yea 24
loss 24
of 24
life 24
then 24
to 24
fill 24
the 24
measure 24
of 24
suffering 24
and 24
that 24
he 24
may 24
feel 24
the 24
pain 24
that 24
only 24
the 24
morally 24
good 24
heart 24
can 24
feel 24
very 24
deeply 24
let 24
us 24
conceive 24
his 24
family 24
threatened 24
with 24
extreme 24
distress 24
and 24
want 24
entreating 24
him 24
to 24
yield 24
conceive 24
himself 24
though 24
upright 24
yet 24
with 24
feelings 24
not 24
hard 24
or 24
insensible 24
either 24
to 24
compassion 24
or 24
to 24
his 24
own 24
distress 24
conceive 24
him 24
i 24
say 24
at 24
the 24
moment 24
when 24
he 24
wishes 24
that 24
he 24
had 24
never 24
lived 24
to 24
see 24
the 24
day 24
that 24
exposed 24
him 24
to 24
such 24
unutterable 24
anguish 24
yet 24
remaining 24
true 24
to 24
his 24
uprightness 24
of 24
purpose 24
without 24
wavering 24
or 24
even 24
doubting 24
then 24
will 24
my 24
youthful 24
hearer 24
be 24
raised 24
gradually 24
from 24
mere 24
approval 24
to 24
admiration 24
from 24
that 24
to 24
amazement 24
and 24
finally 24
to 24
the 24
greatest 24
veneration 24
and 24
a 24
lively 24
wish 24
that 24
be 24
himself 24
could 24
be 24
such 24
a 24
man 24
though 24
certainly 24
not 24
in 24
such 24
circumstances 24
yet 24
virtue 24
is 24
here 24
worth 24
so 24
much 24
only 24
because 24
it 24
costs 24
so 24
much 24
not 24
because 24
it 24
brings 24
any 24
profit 24
all 24
the 24
admiration 24
and 24
even 24
the 24
endeavour 24
to 24
resemble 24
this 24
character 24
rest 24
wholly 24
on 24
the 24
purity 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
principle 24
which 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
strikingly 24
shown 24
by 24
removing 24
from 24
the 24
springs 24
of 24
action 24
everything 24
that 24
men 24
may 24
regard 24
as 24
part 24
of 24
happiness 24
morality 24
then 24
must 24
have 24
the 24
more 24
power 24
over 24
the 24
human 24
heart 24
the 24
more 24
purely 24
it 24
is 24
exhibited 24
whence 24
it 24
follows 24
that 24
if 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
the 24
image 24
of 24
holiness 24
and 24
virtue 24
are 24
to 24
exercise 24
any 24
influence 24
at 24
all 24
on 24
our 24
souls 24
they 24
can 24
do 24
so 24
only 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
they 24
are 24
laid 24
to 24
heart 24
in 24
their 24
purity 24
as 24
motives 24
unmixed 24
with 24
any 24
view 24
to 24
prosperity 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
in 24
suffering 24
that 24
they 24
display 24
themselves 24
most 24
nobly 24
now 24
that 24
whose 24
removal 24
strengthens 24
the 24
effect 24
of 24
a 24
moving 24
force 24
must 24
have 24
been 24
a 24
hindrance 24
consequently 24
every 24
admixture 24
of 24
motives 24
taken 24
from 24
our 24
own 24
happiness 24
is 24
a 24
hindrance 24
to 24
the 24
influence 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
on 24
the 24
heart 24
i 24
affirm 24
further 24
that 24
even 24
in 24
that 24
admired 24
action 24
if 24
the 24
motive 24
from 24
which 24
it 24
was 24
done 24
was 24
a 24
high 24
regard 24
for 24
duty 24
then 24
it 24
is 24
just 24
this 24
respect 24
for 24
the 24
law 24
that 24
has 24
the 24
greatest 24
influence 24
on 24
the 24
mind 24
of 24
the 24
spectator 24
not 24
any 24
pretension 24
to 24
a 24
supposed 24
inward 24
greatness 24
of 24
mind 24
or 24
noble 24
meritorious 24
sentiments 24
consequently 24
duty 24
not 24
merit 24
must 24
have 24
not 24
only 24
the 24
most 24
definite 24
but 24
when 24
it 24
is 24
represented 24
in 24
the 24
true 24
light 24
of 24
its 24
inviolability 24
the 24
most 24
penetrating 24
influence 24
on 24
the 24
mind 24
it 24
is 24
more 24
necessary 24
than 24
ever 24
to 24
direct 24
attention 24
to 24
this 24
method 24
in 24
our 24
times 24
when 24
men 24
hope 24
to 24
produce 24
more 24
effect 24
on 24
the 24
mind 24
with 24
soft 24
tender 24
feelings 24
or 24
highflown 24
puffingup 24
pretensions 24
which 24
rather 24
wither 24
the 24
heart 24
than 24
strengthen 24
it 24
than 24
by 24
a 24
plain 24
and 24
earnest 24
representation 24
of 24
duty 24
which 24
is 24
more 24
suited 24
to 24
human 24
imperfection 24
and 24
to 24
progress 24
in 24
goodness 24
to 24
set 24
before 24
children 24
as 24
a 24
pattern 24
actions 24
that 24
are 24
called 24
noble 24
magnanimous 24
meritorious 24
with 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
captivating 24
them 24
by 24
infusing 24
enthusiasm 24
for 24
such 24
actions 24
is 24
to 24
defeat 24
our 24
end 24
for 24
as 24
they 24
are 24
still 24
so 24
backward 24
in 24
the 24
observance 24
of 24
the 24
commonest 24
duty 24
and 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
correct 24
estimation 24
of 24
it 24
this 24
means 24
simply 24
to 24
make 24
them 24
fantastical 24
romancers 24
betimes 24
but 24
even 24
with 24
the 24
instructed 24
and 24
experienced 24
part 24
of 24
mankind 24
this 24
supposed 24
spring 24
has 24
if 24
not 24
an 24
injurious 24
at 24
least 24
no 24
genuine 24
moral 24
effect 24
on 24
the 24
heart 24
which 24
however 24
is 24
what 24
it 24
was 24
desired 24
to 24
produce 24
all 24
feelings 24
especially 24
those 24
that 24
are 24
to 24
produce 24
unwonted 24
exertions 24
must 24
accomplish 24
their 24
effect 24
at 24
the 24
moment 24
they 24
are 24
at 24
their 24
height 24
and 24
before 24
the 24
calm 24
down 24
otherwise 24
they 24
effect 24
nothing 24
for 24
as 24
there 24
was 24
nothing 24
to 24
strengthen 24
the 24
heart 24
but 24
only 24
to 24
excite 24
it 24
it 24
naturally 24
returns 24
to 24
its 24
normal 24
moderate 24
tone 24
and 24
thus 24
falls 24
back 24
into 24
its 24
previous 24
languor 24
principles 24
must 24
be 24
built 24
on 24
conceptions 24
on 24
any 24
other 24
basis 24
there 24
can 24
only 24
be 24
paroxysms 24
which 24
can 24
give 24
the 24
person 24
no 24
moral 24
worth 24
nay 24
not 24
even 24
confidence 24
in 24
himself 24
without 24
which 24
the 24
highest 24
good 24
in 24
man 24
consciousness 24
of 24
the 24
morality 24
of 24
his 24
mind 24
and 24
character 24
cannot 24
exist 24
now 24
if 24
these 24
conceptions 24
are 24
to 24
become 24
subjectively 24
practical 24
we 24
must 24
not 24
rest 24
satisfied 24
with 24
admiring 24
the 24
objective 24
law 24
of 24
morality 24
and 24
esteeming 24
it 24
highly 24
in 24
reference 24
to 24
humanity 24
but 24
we 24
must 24
consider 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
it 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
man 24
as 24
an 24
individual 24
and 24
then 24
this 24
law 24
appears 24
in 24
a 24
form 24
indeed 24
that 24
is 24
highly 24
deserving 24
of 24
respect 24
but 24
not 24
so 24
pleasant 24
as 24
if 24
it 24
belonged 24
to 24
the 24
element 24
to 24
which 24
he 24
is 24
naturally 24
accustomed 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24
as 24
often 24
compelling 24
him 24
to 24
quit 24
this 24
element 24
not 24
without 24
selfdenial 24
and 24
to 24
betake 24
himself 24
to 24
a 24
higher 24
in 24
which 24
he 24
can 24
only 24
maintain 24
himself 24
with 24
trouble 24
and 24
with 24
unceasing 24
apprehension 24
of 24
a 24
relapse 24
in 24
a 24
word 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
demands 24
obedience 24
from 24
duty 24
not 24
from 24
predilection 24
which 24
cannot 24
and 24
ought 24
not 24
to 24
be 24
presupposed 24
at 24
all 24
let 24
us 24
now 24
see 24
in 24
an 24
example 24
whether 24
the 24
conception 24
of 24
an 24
action 24
as 24
a 24
noble 24
and 24
magnanimous 24
one 24
has 24
more 24
subjective 24
moving 24
power 24
than 24
if 24
the 24
action 24
is 24
conceived 24
merely 24
as 24
duty 24
in 24
relation 24
to 24
the 24
solemn 24
law 24
of 24
morality 24
the 24
action 24
by 24
which 24
a 24
man 24
endeavours 24
at 24
the 24
greatest 24
peril 24
of 24
life 24
to 24
rescue 24
people 24
from 24
shipwreck 24
at 24
last 24
losing 24
his 24
life 24
in 24
the 24
attempt 24
is 24
reckoned 24
on 24
one 24
side 24
as 24
duty 24
but 24
on 24
the 24
other 24
and 24
for 24
the 24
most 24
part 24
as 24
a 24
meritorious 24
action 24
but 24
our 24
esteem 24
for 24
it 24
is 24
much 24
weakened 24
by 24
the 24
notion 24
of 24
duty 24
to 24
himself 24
which 24
seems 24
in 24
this 24
case 24
to 24
be 24
somewhat 24
infringed 24
more 24
decisive 24
is 24
the 24
magnanimous 24
sacrifice 24
of 24
life 24
for 24
the 24
safety 24
of 24
ones 24
country 24
and 24
yet 24
there 24
still 24
remains 24
some 24
scruple 24
whether 24
it 24
is 24
a 24
perfect 24
duty 24
to 24
devote 24
ones 24
self 24
to 24
this 24
purpose 24
spontaneously 24
and 24
unbidden 24
and 24
the 24
action 24
has 24
not 24
in 24
itself 24
the 24
full 24
force 24
of 24
a 24
pattern 24
and 24
impulse 24

the 24
judging 24
of 24
actions 24

a 24

that 24
merely 24
furnishes 24
a 24
principle 24

of 24
what 24

require 24
from 24

as 24
contrasted 24
with 24
that 24

prescribes 24

the 24
former 24
only 24
nonessential 24
duties 24
and 24
thus 24
we 24
teach 24
how 24
to 24
distinguish 24
different 24
kinds 24
of 24

which 24
meet 24
in 24

the 24
other 24
point 24
to 24
which 24
attention 24
must 24
be 24
directed 24
is 24
the 24
question 24
whether 24
the 24
action 24
was 24
also 24
subjectively 24
done 24
for 24
the 24
sake 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
so 24
that 24
it 24
not 24
only 24
is 24
morally 24
correct 24
as 24
a 24
deed 24
but 24
also 24
by 24
the 24
maxim 24
from 24
which 24
it 24
is 24
done 24
has 24
moral 24
worth 24
as 24
a 24
disposition 24
now 24
there 24
is 24
no 24
doubt 24
that 24
this 24
practice 24
and 24
the 24
resulting 24
culture 24
of 24
our 24
reason 24
in 24
judging 24
merely 24
of 24
the 24
practical 24
must 24
gradually 24
produce 24
a 24
certain 24
interest 24
even 24
in 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
reason 24
and 24
consequently 24
in 24
morally 24
good 24
actions 24
for 24
we 24
ultimately 24
take 24
a 24
liking 24
for 24
a 24
thing 24
the 24
contemplation 24
of 24
which 24
makes 24
us 24
feel 24
that 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
our 24
cognitive 24
faculties 24
is 24
extended 24
and 24
this 24
extension 24
is 24
especially 24
furthered 24
by 24
that 24
in 24
which 24
we 24
find 24
moral 24
correctness 24
since 24
it 24
is 24
only 24
in 24
such 24
an 24
order 24
of 24
things 24
that 24
reason 24
with 24
its 24
faculty 24
of 24
determining 24
a 24
priori 24
on 24
principle 24
what 24
ought 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
can 24
find 24
satisfaction 24
an 24
observer 24
of 24
nature 24
takes 24
liking 24
at 24
last 24
to 24
objects 24
that 24
at 24
first 24
offended 24
his 24
senses 24
when 24
he 24
discovers 24
in 24
them 24
the 24
great 24
adaptation 24
of 24
their 24
organization 24
to 24
design 24
so 24
that 24
his 24
reason 24
finds 24
food 24
in 24
its 24
contemplation 24
so 24
leibnitz 24
spared 24
an 24
insect 24
that 24
he 24
had 24
carefully 24
examined 24
with 24
the 24
microscope 24
and 24
replaced 24
it 24
on 24
its 24
leaf 24
because 24
he 24
had 24
found 24
himself 24
instructed 24
by 24
the 24
view 24
of 24
it 24
and 24
had 24
as 24
it 24
were 24
received 24
a 24
benefit 24
from 24
it 24

this 24
employment 24
of 24
the 24
faculty 24
of 24
judgement 24
which 24
makes 24
us 24
feel 24
our 24
own 24
cognitive 24
powers 24
is 24
not 24
yet 24
the 24
interest 24
in 24
actions 24
and 24
in 24
their 24
morality 24
itself 24
it 24
merely 24
causes 24
us 24
to 24
take 24
pleasure 24
in 24
engaging 24
in 24
such 24
criticism 24
and 24
it 24
gives 24
to 24
virtue 24
or 24
the 24
disposition 24
that 24
conforms 24
to 24
moral 24
laws 24
a 24
form 24
of 24
beauty 24
which 24
is 24
admired 24
but 24
not 24
on 24
that 24
account 24
sought 24
after 24

of 24
the 24
harmony 24
of 24
our 24
powers 24
of 24
conception 24

strengthened 24

a 24
satisfaction 24
which 24
may 24
also 24
be 24
communicated 24
to 24
others 24
while 24
nevertheless 24
the 24
existence 24
of 24
the 24
object 24
remains 24
indifferent 24

becoming 24

are 24
elevated 24
above 24

animal 24
nature 24
now 24
however 24
the 24
second 24
exercise 24
comes 24
in 24
the 24
living 24
exhibition 24
of 24
morality 24
of 24
character 24
by 24
examples 24
in 24
which 24
attention 24
is 24
directed 24
to 24
purity 24
of 24
will 24
first 24
only 24
as 24
a 24
negative 24
perfection 24
in 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
in 24
an 24
action 24
done 24
from 24
duty 24
no 24
motives 24
of 24
inclination 24
have 24
any 24
influence 24
in 24
determining 24

the 24
pupils 24
attention 24
is 24
fixed 24
upon 24
the 24
consciousness 24

his 24
freedom 24

although 24
this 24
renunciation 24
at 24
first 24
excites 24
a 24
feeling 24
of 24
pain 24
nevertheless 24
by 24
its 24
withdrawing 24
the 24
pupil 24
from 24

constraint 24
of 24
even 24

him 24
at 24
the 24

time 24
a 24
deliverance 24
from 24
the 24
manifold 24
dissatisfaction 24
in 24
which 24
all 24
these 24
wants 24
entangle 24
him 24
and 24
the 24
mind 24
is 24
made 24
capable 24
of 24
receiving 24
the 24
sensation 24
of 24
satisfaction 24
from 24
other 24
sources 24
the 24
heart 24
is 24
freed 24

lightened 24
of 24
a 24
burden 24
that 24
always 24
secretly 24
presses 24
on 24
it 24
when 24
instances 24
of 24
pure 24
moral 24
resolutions 24
reveal 24
to 24
the 24
man 24
an 24
inner 24
faculty 24
of 24
which 24
otherwise 24
he 24
has 24
no 24
right 24
knowledge 24
the 24
inward 24
freedom 24
to 24
release 24
himself 24
from 24
the 24
boisterous 24
importunity 24
of 24
inclinations 24
to 24
such 24
a 24
degree 24
that 24
none 24
of 24
them 24
not 24
even 24
the 24
dearest 24
shall 24
have 24
any 24
influence 24
on 24
a 24
resolution 24
for 24
which 24
we 24
are 24
now 24

employ 24

reason 24

the 24
offer 24
of 24
satisfaction 24
are 24
so 24
strongly 24
opposed 24
by 24
vanity 24
selfishness 24
and 24
even 24
an 24
otherwise 24
not 24
illegitimate 24
antipathy 24
to 24
the 24
man 24
whose 24
rights 24
are 24
impaired 24
by 24
me 24
i 24
am 24
nevertheless 24
able 24
to 24
discard 24
all 24
these 24
considerations 24
in 24
this 24
there 24
is 24
implied 24
a 24
consciousness 24
of 24
independence 24
on 24
inclinations 24
and 24
circumstances 24
and 24
of 24
the 24
possibility 24
of 24
being 24
sufficient 24
for 24
myself 24
which 24
is 24
salutary 24
to 24
me 24
in 24
general 24
for 24
other 24
purposes 24
also 24
and 24
now 24
the 24
law 24
of 24
duty 24
in 24
consequence 24
of 24
the 24
positive 24
worth 24
which 24
obedience 24
to 24
it 24
makes 24
us 24
feel 24
finds 24
easier 24
access 24
through 24
the 24
respect 24
for 24
ourselves 24
in 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
our 24
freedom 24
when 24
this 24
is 24
well 24
established 24
when 24
a 24
man 24
dreads 24
nothing 24
more 24
than 24
to 24
find 24
himself 24
on 24
selfexamination 24
worthless 24
and 24
contemptible 24
in 24
his 24
own 24
eyes 24
then 24
every 24
good 24
moral 24
disposition 24
can 24
be 24
grafted 24
on 24
it 24
because 24
this 24
is 24
the 24
best 24
nay 24
the 24
only 24
guard 24
that 24
can 24
keep 24
off 24
from 24
the 24
mind 24
the 24
pressure 24
of 24
ignoble 24
and 24
corrupting 24
motives 24
i 24
have 24
only 24
intended 24
to 24
point 24
out 24
the 24
most 24
general 24
maxims 24
of 24
the 24
methodology 24
of 24
moral 24
cultivation 24
and 24
exercise 24
as 24
the 24
manifold 24
variety 24
of 24
duties 24
requires 24
special 24
rules 24
for 24
each 24
kind 24
and 24
this 24
would 24
be 24
a 24
prolix 24
affair 24
i 24
shall 24
be 24
readily 24
excused 24
if 24

with 24
ever 24
new 24

increasing 24
admiration 24

the 24
oftener 24
and 24

them 24
directly 24
with 24
the 24
consciousness 24
of 24
my 24

occupy 24
in 24
the 24

therein 24
to 24
an 24
unbounded 24
extent 24
with 24
worlds 24
upon 24

from 24
my 24
invisible 24
self 24
my 24
personality 24
and 24
exhibits 24
me 24
in 24
a 24
world 24
which 24
has 24
true 24
infinity 24
but 24
which 24
is 24
traceable 24
only 24
by 24
the 24
understanding 24
and 24
with 24
which 24
i 24
discern 24
that 24
i 24
am 24
not 24
in 24
a 24
merely 24
contingent 24
but 24
in 24

universal 24

a 24
countless 24
multitude 24

as 24
it 24
were 24
my 24
importance 24
as 24
an 24
animal 24
creature 24
which 24
after 24
it 24
has 24
been 24
for 24
a 24
short 24
time 24
provided 24
with 24
vital 24
power 24
one 24
knows 24
not 24
how 24
must 24
again 24
give 24
back 24
the 24
matter 24
of 24
which 24
it 24
was 24
formed 24
to 24
the 24
planet 24
it 24
inhabits 24
a 24
mere 24
speck 24
in 24
the 24
universe 24
the 24
second 24
on 24
the 24
contrary 24

elevates 24
my 24
worth 24
as 24
an 24
intelligence 24
by 24
my 24
personality 24
in 24
which 24
the 24
moral 24
law 24
reveals 24
to 24
me 24
a 24
life 24
independent 24
of 24
animality 24
and 24
even 24
of 24
the 24
whole 24
sensible 24
world 24
at 24
least 24
so 24
far 24
as 24
may 24
be 24
inferred 24
from 24
the 24
destination 24
assigned 24
to 24
my 24
existence 24
by 24
this 24
law 24
a 24
destination 24
not 24
restricted 24
to 24
conditions 24
and 24
limits 24
of 24
this 24
life 24
but 24
reaching 24
into 24
the 24
infinite 24
but 24
though 24
admiration 24
and 24
respect 24
may 24
excite 24
to 24
inquiry 24
they 24
cannot 24
supply 24
the 24
want 24
of 24
it 24
what 24
then 24
is 24
to 24
be 24
done 24
in 24
order 24
to 24
enter 24
on 24
this 24
in 24
a 24
useful 24
manner 24
and 24
one 24
adapted 24
to 24
the 24
loftiness 24
of 24
the 24
subject 24
examples 24
may 24
serve 24
in 24
this 24
as 24
a 24
warning 24
and 24
also 24
for 24
imitation 24
the 24
contemplation 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
began 24
from 24
the 24
noblest 24
spectacle 24
that 24
the 24
human 24
senses 24
present 24
to 24
us 24
and 24
that 24
our 24
understanding 24
can 24
bear 24
to 24
follow 24
in 24
their 24
vast 24
reach 24
and 24
it 24
ended 24
in 24
astrology 24
morality 24
began 24
with 24
the 24
noblest 24
attribute 24
of 24
human 24
nature 24
the 24
development 24
and 24
cultivation 24
of 24
which 24
give 24
a 24
prospect 24
of 24
infinite 24
utility 24
and 24
ended 24
in 24
fanaticism 24
or 24
superstition 24
so 24
it 24
is 24
with 24
all 24
crude 24
attempts 24
where 24
the 24
principal 24
part 24
of 24
the 24
business 24
depends 24
on 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
reason 24
a 24
use 24
which 24
does 24
not 24
come 24
of 24
itself 24
like 24
the 24
use 24
of 24
the 24
feet 24
by 24
frequent 24
exercise 24
especially 24
when 24
attributes 24
are 24
in 24
question 24
which 24
cannot 24
be 24
directly 24
exhibited 24
in 24
common 24
experience 24
but 24
after 24
the 24
maxim 24
had 24
come 24
into 24
vogue 24
though 24
late 24
to 24
examine 24
carefully 24
beforehand 24
all 24
the 24
steps 24
that 24
reason 24
purposes 24
to 24
take 24
and 24
not 24
to 24
let 24
it 24
proceed 24
otherwise 24
than 24
in 24
the 24
track 24
of 24
a 24
previously 24
well 24
considered 24
method 24
then 24
the 24
study 24
of 24
the 24
structure 24
of 24
the 24
universe 24
took 24
quite 24
a 24
different 24
direction 24
and 24
thereby 24
attained 24
an 24
incomparably 24
happier 24
result 24
the 24
fall 24
of 24
a 24
stone 24
the 24
motion 24
of 24
a 24
sling 24
resolved 24
into 24
their 24
elements 24
and 24
the 24
forces 24
that 24
are 24
manifested 24
in 24
them 24
and 24
treated 24
mathematically 24
produced 24
at 24
last 24
that 24
clear 24
and 24
henceforward 24
unchangeable 24
insight 24
into 24
the 24
system 24
of 24
the 24
world 24
which 24
as 24
observation 24
is 24
continued 24
may 24
hope 24
always 24
to 24
extend 24
itself 24
but 24
need 24
never 24
fear 24
to 24
be 24
compelled 24
to 24
retreat 24
this 24
example 24
may 24
suggest 24
to 24
us 24
to 24
enter 24
on 24
the 24
same 24
path 24
in 24
treating 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
capacities 24
of 24
our 24
nature 24
and 24
may 24
give 24
us 24
hope 24
of 24
a 24
like 24
good 24
result 24
we 24
have 24
at 24
hand 24
the 24
instances 24
of 24
the 24
moral 24
judgement 24
of 24
reason 24
by 24
analysing 24
these 24
into 24
their 24
elementary 24
conceptions 24
and 24
in 24

of 24
mathematics 24
adopting 24
a 24
process 24
similar 24
to 24
that 24
of 24
chemistry 24
the 24
separation 24
of 24
the 24
empirical 24
from 24
the 24
rational 24
elements 24
that 24
may 24
be 24
found 24
in 24
them 24
by 24
repeated 24
experiments 24
on 24
common 24
sense 24
we 24
may 24
exhibit 24
both 24
pure 24
and 24
learn 24
with 24
certainty 24
what 24
each 24
part 24
can 24
accomplish 24
of 24
itself 24

to 24
prevent 24
on 24

the 24
errors 24

a 24

we 25
produce 25

reason 25
in 25
one 25
sphere 25
of 25
its 25
cognition 25
is 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
consider 25
questions 25
which 25
it 25
cannot 25
decline 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
presented 25
by 25
its 25
own 25
nature 25
but 25
which 25
it 25
cannot 25
answer 25
as 25
they 25
transcend 25
every 25
faculty 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
it 25
falls 25
into 25
this 25
difficulty 25
without 25
any 25
fault 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
it 25
begins 25
with 25
principles 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
dispensed 25
with 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
the 25
truth 25
and 25
sufficiency 25
of 25
which 25
are 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
insured 25
by 25
experience 25
with 25
these 25
principles 25
it 25
rises 25
in 25
obedience 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
nature 25
to 25
ever 25
higher 25
and 25
more 25
remote 25
conditions 25
but 25
it 25
quickly 25
discovers 25
that 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
its 25
labours 25
must 25
remain 25
ever 25
incomplete 25
because 25
new 25
questions 25
never 25
cease 25
to 25
present 25
themselves 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
finds 25
itself 25
compelled 25
to 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
principles 25
which 25
transcend 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
experience 25
while 25
they 25
are 25
regarded 25
by 25
common 25
sense 25
without 25
distrust 25
it 25
thus 25
falls 25
into 25
confusion 25
and 25
contradictions 25
from 25
which 25
it 25
conjectures 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
latent 25
errors 25
which 25
however 25
it 25
is 25
unable 25
to 25
discover 25
because 25
the 25
principles 25
it 25
employs 25
transcending 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
cannot 25
be 25
tested 25
by 25
that 25

those 25
who 25
persisted 25

raising 25
new 25
edifices 25
although 25
on 25
no 25
settled 25
or 25
uniform 25
plan 25
in 25
recent 25
times 25
the 25
hope 25
dawned 25
upon 25
us 25
of 25
seeing 25
those 25
disputes 25
settled 25
and 25
the 25
legitimacy 25
of 25
her 25
claims 25
established 25

a 25
kind 25

the 25
human 25
understandingthat 25

affirmed 25

this 25
socalled 25
queen 25
could 25
not 25
refer 25
her 25
descent 25
to 25
any 25
higher 25
source 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
common 25
experience 25
a 25
circumstance 25
which 25
necessarily 25
brought 25
suspicion 25
on 25
her 25
claimsas 25
this 25
genealogy 25
was 25
incorrect 25
she 25
persisted 25
in 25
the 25
advancement 25
of 25
her 25
claims 25
to 25
sovereignty 25
thus 25
metaphysics 25
necessarily 25
fell 25
back 25
into 25
the 25
antiquated 25
and 25
rotten 25
constitution 25
of 25
dogmatism 25
and 25
again 25
became 25
obnoxious 25
to 25
the 25
contempt 25

and 25
complete 25
indifferentismthe 25
mother 25
of 25
chaos 25
and 25
night 25
in 25
the 25
scientific 25
world 25
but 25
at 25
the 25

time 25
the 25
source 25
of 25

at 25
least 25
the 25
prelude 25
to 25
the 25
recreation 25
and 25
reinstallation 25
of 25
a 25

it 25
has 25
fallen 25
into 25

and 25

in 25

vain 25
to 25
profess 25
indifference 25
in 25

such 25
inquiries 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
indifferent 25

humanity 25
besides 25
these 25
pretended 25
indifferentists 25
however 25
much 25
they 25
may 25
try 25
to 25
disguise 25
themselves 25
by 25
the 25
assumption 25
of 25
a 25
popular 25
style 25
and 25
by 25
changes 25
on 25
the 25
language 25
of 25
the 25
schools 25
unavoidably 25
fall 25
into 25
metaphysical 25
declarations 25
and 25
propositions 25
which 25
they 25
profess 25
to 25
regard 25
with 25
so 25
much 25
contempt 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
this 25
indifference 25
which 25
has 25
arisen 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
science 25
and 25
which 25
relates 25
to 25
that 25
kind 25
of 25
knowledge 25
which 25
we 25
should 25
wish 25
to 25
see 25
destroyed 25
the 25
last 25
is 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
that 25
well 25
deserves 25
our 25
attention 25
and 25
reflection 25
it 25
is 25
plainly 25
not 25
the 25
effect 25
of 25
the 25
levity 25
but 25
of 25
the 25
matured 25
judgement 25
of 25
the 25
age 25
which 25
refuses 25
to 25
be 25
any 25
longer 25
entertained 25
with 25
illusory 25
knowledge 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
a 25
call 25
to 25
reason 25
again 25
to 25
undertake 25
the 25
most 25
laborious 25
of 25
all 25
tasksthat 25
of 25
selfexamination 25
and 25
to 25
establish 25
a 25
tribunal 25
which 25
may 25
secure 25
it 25
in 25
its 25
wellgrounded 25
claims 25
while 25
it 25
pronounces 25
against 25
all 25
baseless 25
assumptions 25
and 25
pretensions 25
not 25
in 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
manner 25
but 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
own 25
eternal 25
and 25
unchangeable 25
laws 25
this 25
tribunal 25
is 25
nothing 25
less 25
than 25
the 25
critical 25
investigation 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
footnote 25
we 25
very 25
often 25
hear 25
complaints 25
of 25
the 25
shallowness 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
age 25
and 25
of 25
the 25
decay 25
of 25
profound 25
science 25
but 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
think 25
that 25
those 25
which 25
rest 25
upon 25
a 25
secure 25
foundation 25
such 25
as 25
mathematics 25
physical 25
science 25
etc 25
in 25
the 25
least 25
deserve 25
this 25
reproach 25
but 25
that 25
they 25
rather 25
maintain 25
their 25
ancient 25
fame 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
case 25
indeed 25
far 25
surpass 25
it 25
the 25
same 25
would 25
be 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
other 25
kinds 25
of 25
cognition 25
if 25
their 25
principles 25
were 25
but 25
firmly 25
established 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
this 25
security 25
indifference 25
doubt 25
and 25
finally 25
severe 25
criticism 25
are 25
rather 25
signs 25
of 25
a 25
profound 25
habit 25
of 25
thought 25
our 25
age 25
is 25
the 25
age 25
of 25
criticism 25
to 25
which 25
everything 25
must 25
be 25
subjected 25
the 25
sacredness 25
of 25
religion 25
and 25
the 25
authority 25
of 25
legislation 25
are 25
by 25
many 25
regarded 25
as 25
grounds 25
of 25
exemption 25
from 25
the 25
examination 25
of 25
this 25
tribunal 25
but 25
if 25
they 25
on 25
they 25
are 25
exempted 25
they 25
become 25
the 25
subjects 25
of 25
just 25
suspicion 25
and 25
cannot 25
lay 25
claim 25
to 25
sincere 25
respect 25
which 25
reason 25
accords 25
only 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
has 25
stood 25
the 25
test 25
of 25
a 25
free 25
and 25
public 25
examination 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
mean 25
by 25
this 25
a 25
criticism 25
of 25
books 25
and 25
systems 25
but 25
a 25
critical 25
inquiry 25
into 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
reason 25
with 25
reference 25
to 25
the 25
cognitions 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
strives 25
to 25
attain 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experience 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
regarding 25
the 25
possibility 25
or 25
impossibility 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
and 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
origin 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
of 25
the 25
extent 25
and 25
limits 25
of 25
this 25
science 25
all 25
this 25
must 25
be 25
done 25
on 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
principles 25
this 25
paththe 25
only 25
one 25
now 25
remaininghas 25
been 25
entered 25
upon 25
by 25
me 25
and 25
i 25
flatter 25
myself 25
that 25
i 25
have 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
discovered 25
the 25
cause 25
ofand 25
consequently 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
removingall 25
the 25
errors 25
which 25
have 25
hitherto 25
set 25
reason 25
at 25
variance 25
with 25
itself 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
nonempirical 25
thought 25
i 25
have 25
not 25
returned 25
an 25
evasive 25
answer 25
to 25
the 25
questions 25
of 25
reason 25
by 25
alleging 25
the 25
inability 25
and 25
limitation 25
of 25
the 25
faculties 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
i 25
have 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
examined 25
them 25
completely 25
in 25
the 25
light 25
of 25
principles 25
and 25
after 25
having 25
discovered 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
doubts 25
and 25
contradictions 25
into 25
which 25
reason 25
fell 25
have 25
solved 25
them 25
to 25
its 25
perfect 25
satisfaction 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
these 25
questions 25
have 25
not 25
been 25
solved 25
as 25
dogmatism 25
in 25
its 25
vain 25
fancies 25
and 25
desires 25
had 25
expected 25
for 25
it 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
satisfied 25
by 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
magical 25
arts 25
and 25
of 25
these 25
i 25
have 25
no 25
knowledge 25
but 25
neither 25
do 25
these 25
come 25
within 25
the 25
compass 25
of 25
our 25
mental 25
powers 25
and 25
it 25
was 25
the 25
duty 25
of 25
philosophy 25
to 25
destroy 25
the 25
illusions 25
which 25
had 25
their 25
origin 25
in 25
misconceptions 25
whatever 25
darling 25
hopes 25
and 25
valued 25
expectations 25
may 25
be 25
ruined 25
by 25
its 25
explanations 25
my 25
chief 25
aim 25
in 25
this 25
work 25
has 25
been 25
thoroughness 25
and 25
i 25
make 25
bold 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
single 25
metaphysical 25
problem 25
that 25
does 25
not 25
find 25
its 25
solution 25
or 25
at 25
least 25
the 25
key 25
to 25
its 25
solution 25
here 25
pure 25
reason 25
is 25
a 25
perfect 25
unity 25
and 25
therefore 25
if 25
the 25
principle 25
presented 25
by 25
it 25
prove 25
to 25
be 25
insufficient 25
for 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
even 25
a 25
single 25
one 25
of 25
those 25
questions 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
very 25
nature 25
of 25
reason 25
gives 25
birth 25
we 25
must 25
reject 25
it 25
as 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
perfectly 25
certain 25
of 25
its 25
sufficiency 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
others 25
while 25
i 25
say 25
this 25
i 25
think 25
i 25
see 25
upon 25
the 25
countenance 25
of 25
the 25
reader 25
signs 25
of 25
dissatisfaction 25
mingled 25
with 25
contempt 25
when 25
he 25
hears 25
declarations 25
which 25
sound 25
so 25
boastful 25
and 25
extravagant 25
and 25
yet 25
they 25
are 25
beyond 25
comparison 25
more 25
moderate 25
than 25
those 25
advanced 25
by 25
the 25
commonest 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
commonest 25
philosophical 25
programme 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
dogmatist 25
professes 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
simple 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
or 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
primal 25
being 25
such 25
a 25
dogmatist 25
promises 25
to 25
extend 25
human 25
knowledge 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
while 25
i 25
humbly 25
confess 25
that 25
this 25
is 25
completely 25
beyond 25
my 25
power 25
instead 25
of 25
any 25
such 25
attempt 25
i 25
confine 25
myself 25
to 25
the 25
examination 25
of 25
reason 25
alone 25
and 25
its 25
pure 25
thought 25
and 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
need 25
to 25
seek 25
far 25
for 25
the 25
sumtotal 25
of 25
its 25
cognition 25
because 25
it 25
has 25
its 25
seat 25
in 25
my 25
own 25
mind 25
besides 25
common 25
logic 25
presents 25
me 25
with 25
a 25
complete 25
and 25
systematic 25
catalogue 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
simple 25
operations 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
my 25
task 25
to 25
answer 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
far 25
reason 25
can 25
go 25
without 25
the 25
material 25
presented 25
and 25
the 25
aid 25
furnished 25
by 25
experience 25
so 25
much 25
for 25
the 25
completeness 25
and 25
thoroughness 25
necessary 25
in 25
the 25
execution 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
task 25
the 25
aims 25
set 25
before 25
us 25
are 25
not 25
arbitrarily 25
proposed 25
but 25
are 25
imposed 25
upon 25
us 25
by 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
cognition 25
itself 25
the 25
above 25
remarks 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
our 25
critical 25
inquiry 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
form 25
there 25
are 25
two 25
indispensable 25
conditions 25
which 25
any 25
one 25
who 25
undertakes 25
so 25
difficult 25
a 25
task 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
is 25
bound 25
to 25
fulfil 25
these 25
conditions 25
are 25
certitude 25
and 25
clearness 25
as 25
regards 25
certitude 25
i 25
have 25
fully 25
convinced 25
myself 25
that 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
thought 25
opinion 25
is 25
perfectly 25
inadmissible 25
and 25
that 25
everything 25
which 25
bears 25
the 25
least 25
semblance 25
of 25
an 25
hypothesis 25
must 25
be 25
excluded 25
as 25
of 25
no 25
value 25
in 25
such 25
discussions 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
necessary 25
condition 25
of 25
every 25
cognition 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
established 25
upon 25
a 25
priori 25
grounds 25
that 25
it 25
shall 25
be 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
much 25
more 25
is 25
this 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
an 25
attempt 25
to 25
determine 25
all 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
and 25
to 25
furnish 25
the 25
standardand 25
consequently 25
an 25
example 25
of 25
all 25
apodeictic 25
philosophical 25
certitude 25
whether 25
i 25
have 25
succeeded 25
in 25
what 25
i 25
professed 25
to 25
do 25
it 25
is 25
for 25
the 25
reader 25
to 25
determine 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
authors 25
business 25
merely 25
to 25
adduce 25
grounds 25
and 25
reasons 25
without 25
determining 25
what 25
influence 25
these 25
ought 25
to 25
have 25
on 25
the 25
mind 25
of 25
his 25
judges 25
but 25
lest 25
anything 25
he 25
may 25
have 25
said 25
may 25
become 25
the 25
innocent 25
cause 25
of 25
doubt 25
in 25
their 25
minds 25
or 25
tend 25
to 25
weaken 25
the 25
effect 25
which 25
his 25
arguments 25
might 25
otherwise 25
producehe 25
may 25
be 25
allowed 25
to 25
point 25
out 25
those 25
passages 25
which 25
may 25
occasion 25
mistrust 25
or 25
difficulty 25

these 25
do 25
not 25
concern 25
the 25
main 25
purpose 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
work 25
he 25
does 25
this 25
solely 25
with 25
the 25
view 25
of 25
removing 25
from 25
the 25
mind 25
of 25
the 25
reader 25
any 25
doubts 25
which 25
might 25
affect 25
his 25
judgement 25
of 25
the 25
work 25
as 25
a 25
whole 25
and 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
its 25
ultimate 25
aim 25
i 25
know 25
no 25
investigations 25
more 25
necessary 25
for 25
a 25
full 25
insight 25
into 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
which 25
we 25
call 25
understanding 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
for 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
rules 25
and 25
limits 25
of 25
its 25
use 25
than 25
those 25
undertaken 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
chapter 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
under 25
the 25
title 25
of 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
they 25
have 25
also 25
cost 25
me 25
by 25
far 25
the 25
greatest 25
labourlabour 25
which 25
i 25
hope 25
will 25
not 25
remain 25
uncompensated 25
the 25
view 25
there 25
taken 25
which 25
goes 25
somewhat 25
deeply 25
into 25
the 25
subject 25
has 25
two 25
sides 25
the 25
one 25
relates 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
is 25
intended 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
and 25
to 25
render 25
comprehensible 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
its 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
and 25
it 25
forms 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
an 25
essential 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
critique 25
the 25
other 25
considers 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
itself 25
its 25
possibility 25
and 25
its 25
powers 25
of 25
cognitionthat 25
is 25
from 25
a 25
subjective 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
and 25
although 25
this 25
exposition 25
is 25
of 25
great 25
importance 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
belong 25
essentially 25
to 25
the 25
main 25
purpose 25
of 25
the 25
work 25
because 25
the 25
grand 25
question 25
is 25
what 25
and 25
how 25
much 25
can 25
reason 25
and 25
understanding 25
apart 25
from 25
experience 25
cognize 25
and 25
not 25
how 25
is 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
thought 25
itself 25
possible 25
as 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
an 25
inquiry 25
into 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
a 25
given 25
effect 25
and 25
has 25
thus 25
in 25
it 25
some 25
semblance 25
of 25
an 25
hypothesis 25
although 25
as 25
i 25
shall 25
show 25
on 25
another 25
occasion 25
this 25
is 25
really 25
not 25
the 25
fact 25
it 25
would 25
seem 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
instance 25
i 25
had 25
allowed 25
myself 25
to 25
enounce 25
a 25
mere 25
opinion 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
reader 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
at 25
liberty 25
to 25
hold 25
a 25
different 25
opinion 25
but 25
i 25
beg 25
to 25
remind 25
him 25
that 25
if 25
my 25
subjective 25
deduction 25
does 25
not 25
produce 25
in 25
his 25
mind 25
the 25
conviction 25
of 25
its 25
certitude 25
at 25
which 25
i 25
aimed 25
the 25
objective 25
deduction 25
with 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
present 25
work 25
is 25
properly 25
concerned 25
is 25
in 25
every 25
respect 25
satisfactory 25
as 25
regards 25
clearness 25
the 25
reader 25
has 25
a 25
right 25
to 25
demand 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
discursive 25
or 25
logical 25
clearness 25
that 25
is 25
on 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
secondly 25
intuitive 25
or 25
aesthetic 25
clearness 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
intuitions 25
that 25
is 25
by 25
examples 25
or 25
other 25
modes 25
of 25
illustration 25
in 25
concreto 25
i 25
have 25
done 25
what 25
i 25
could 25
for 25
the 25
first 25
kind 25
of 25
intelligibility 25
this 25
was 25
essential 25
to 25
my 25
purpose 25
and 25
it 25
thus 25
became 25
the 25
accidental 25
cause 25
of 25
my 25
inability 25
to 25
do 25
complete 25
justice 25
to 25
the 25
second 25
requirement 25
i 25
have 25
been 25
almost 25
always 25
at 25
a 25
loss 25
during 25
the 25
progress 25
of 25
this 25
work 25
how 25
to 25
settle 25
this 25
question 25
examples 25
and 25
illustrations 25
always 25
appeared 25
to 25
me 25
necessary 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
sketch 25
of 25
the 25
critique 25
naturally 25
fell 25
into 25
their 25
proper 25
places 25
but 25
i 25
very 25
soon 25
became 25
aware 25
of 25
the 25
magnitude 25
of 25
my 25
task 25
and 25
the 25
numerous 25
problems 25
with 25
which 25
i 25
should 25
be 25
engaged 25
and 25
as 25
i 25
perceived 25
that 25
this 25
critical 25
investigation 25
would 25
even 25
if 25
delivered 25
in 25
the 25
driest 25
scholastic 25
manner 25
be 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
brief 25
i 25
found 25
it 25
unadvisable 25
to 25
enlarge 25
it 25
still 25
more 25
with 25
examples 25
and 25
explanations 25
which 25
are 25
necessary 25
only 25
from 25
a 25
popular 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
i 25
was 25
induced 25
to 25
take 25
this 25
course 25
from 25
the 25
consideration 25
also 25
that 25
the 25
present 25
work 25
is 25
not 25
intended 25
for 25
popular 25
use 25
that 25
those 25
devoted 25
to 25
science 25
do 25
not 25
require 25
such 25
helps 25
although 25
they 25
are 25
always 25
acceptable 25
and 25
that 25
they 25
would 25
have 25
materially 25
interfered 25
with 25
my 25
present 25
purpose 25
abbe 25
terrasson 25
remarks 25
with 25
great 25
justice 25
that 25
if 25
we 25
estimate 25
the 25
size 25
of 25
a 25
work 25
not 25
from 25
the 25
number 25
of 25
its 25
pages 25
but 25
from 25
the 25
time 25
which 25
we 25
require 25
to 25
make 25
ourselves 25
master 25
of 25
it 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
said 25
of 25
many 25
a 25
book 25
that 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
much 25
shorter 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
not 25
so 25
short 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
comprehensibility 25
of 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
speculative 25
cognition 25
connected 25
under 25
a 25
single 25
principle 25
we 25
may 25
say 25
with 25
equal 25
justice 25
many 25
a 25
book 25
would 25
have 25
been 25
much 25
clearer 25
if 25
it 25
had 25
not 25
been 25
intended 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
very 25
clear 25
for 25
explanations 25
and 25
examples 25
and 25
other 25
helps 25
to 25
intelligibility 25
aid 25
us 25
in 25
the 25
comprehension 25
of 25
parts 25
but 25
they 25
distract 25
the 25
attention 25
dissipate 25
the 25
mental 25
power 25
of 25
the 25
reader 25
and 25
stand 25
in 25
the 25
way 25
of 25
his 25
forming 25
a 25
clear 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
as 25
he 25
cannot 25
attain 25
soon 25
enough 25
to 25
a 25
survey 25
of 25
the 25
system 25
and 25
the 25
colouring 25
and 25
embellishments 25
bestowed 25
upon 25
it 25
prevent 25
his 25
observing 25
its 25
articulation 25
or 25
organizationwhich 25
is 25
the 25
most 25
important 25
consideration 25
with 25
him 25
when 25
he 25
comes 25
to 25
judge 25
of 25
its 25
unity 25
and 25
stability 25
the 25
reader 25
must 25
naturally 25
have 25
a 25
strong 25
inducement 25
to 25
cooperate 25
with 25
the 25
present 25
author 25
if 25
he 25
has 25
formed 25
the 25
intention 25
of 25
erecting 25
a 25
complete 25
and 25
solid 25
edifice 25
of 25
metaphysical 25
science 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
plan 25
now 25
laid 25
before 25
him 25
metaphysics 25
as 25
here 25
represented 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
science 25
which 25
admits 25
of 25
completionand 25
with 25
little 25
labour 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
united 25
in 25
a 25
short 25
time 25
so 25
that 25
nothing 25
will 25
be 25
left 25
to 25
future 25
generations 25
except 25
the 25
task 25
of 25
illustrating 25
and 25
applying 25
it 25
didactically 25
for 25
this 25
science 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
inventory 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
given 25
us 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
systematically 25
arranged 25
nothing 25
can 25
escape 25
our 25
notice 25
for 25
what 25
reason 25
produces 25
from 25
itself 25
cannot 25
lie 25
concealed 25
but 25
must 25
be 25
brought 25
to 25
the 25
light 25
by 25
reason 25
itself 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
discovered 25
the 25
common 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
ideas 25
we 25
seek 25
the 25
perfect 25
unity 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
cognitions 25
which 25
are 25
based 25
upon 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
and 25
uninfluenced 25
by 25
any 25
empirical 25
element 25
or 25
any 25
peculiar 25
intuition 25
leading 25
to 25
determinate 25
experience 25
renders 25
this 25
completeness 25
not 25
only 25
practicable 25
but 25
also 25
necessary 25

fully 25

advances 25
with 25
that 25
undeviating 25
certainty 25

characterizes 25
the 25

at 25
no 25

to 25
determine 25

those 25

engaged 25
in 25
metaphysical 25
pursuits 25
unable 25

come 25
to 25
an 25
understanding 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
method 25
which 25
they 25
ought 25
to 25
follow 25
if 25
we 25
find 25
them 25
after 25
the 25
most 25
elaborate 25
preparations 25
invariably 25
brought 25
to 25
a 25
stand 25
before 25
the 25
goal 25
is 25
reached 25
and 25
compelled 25
to 25
retrace 25
their 25
steps 25
and 25
strike 25
into 25
fresh 25
paths 25
we 25
may 25
then 25
feel 25
quite 25
sure 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
far 25
from 25
having 25
attained 25
to 25
the 25
certainty 25
of 25
scientific 25
progress 25
and 25
may 25
rather 25
be 25
said 25
to 25
be 25
merely 25
groping 25
about 25
in 25
the 25
dark 25
in 25
these 25
circumstances 25
we 25
shall 25
render 25
an 25
important 25
service 25
to 25
reason 25
if 25
we 25
succeed 25
in 25
simply 25
indicating 25
the 25
path 25
along 25
which 25
it 25
must 25
travel 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
any 25
resultseven 25
if 25
it 25
should 25
be 25
found 25
necessary 25
to 25
abandon 25
many 25
of 25
those 25
aims 25
which 25
without 25
reflection 25
have 25
been 25
proposed 25
for 25
its 25
attainment 25
that 25
logic 25
has 25
advanced 25
in 25
this 25
sure 25
course 25
even 25
from 25
the 25
earliest 25
times 25
is 25
apparent 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
since 25
aristotle 25
it 25
has 25
been 25
unable 25
to 25
advance 25
a 25
step 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
all 25
appearance 25
has 25
reached 25
its 25
completion 25
for 25
if 25
some 25
of 25
the 25
moderns 25
have 25
thought 25
to 25
enlarge 25
its 25
domain 25
by 25
introducing 25
psychological 25
discussions 25
on 25
the 25
mental 25
faculties 25
such 25
as 25
imagination 25
and 25
wit 25
metaphysical 25
discussions 25
on 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
knowledge 25
and 25
the 25
different 25
kinds 25
of 25
certitude 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
difference 25
of 25
the 25
objects 25
idealism 25
scepticism 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
or 25
anthropological 25
discussions 25
on 25
prejudices 25
their 25
causes 25
and 25
remedies 25
this 25
attempt 25
on 25
the 25
part 25
of 25
these 25
authors 25
only 25
shows 25
their 25
ignorance 25
of 25
the 25
peculiar 25
nature 25
of 25
logical 25
science 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
enlarge 25
but 25
disfigure 25
the 25
sciences 25
when 25
we 25
lose 25
sight 25
of 25
their 25
respective 25
limits 25
and 25
allow 25
them 25
to 25
run 25
into 25
one 25
another 25
now 25
logic 25
is 25
enclosed 25
within 25
limits 25
which 25
admit 25
of 25
perfectly 25
clear 25
definition 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
science 25
which 25
has 25
for 25
its 25
object 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
exposition 25
and 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
formal 25
laws 25
of 25
all 25
thought 25
whether 25
it 25
be 25
a 25
priori 25
or 25
empirical 25
whatever 25
be 25
its 25
origin 25
or 25
its 25
object 25
and 25
whatever 25
the 25
difficultiesnatural 25
or 25
accidental 25
which 25
it 25
encounters 25
in 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
the 25
early 25
success 25
of 25
logic 25
must 25
be 25
attributed 25
exclusively 25
to 25
the 25
narrowness 25
of 25
its 25
field 25
in 25
which 25
abstraction 25
may 25
or 25
rather 25
must 25
be 25
made 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
cognition 25
with 25
their 25
characteristic 25
distinctions 25
and 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
has 25
only 25
to 25
deal 25
with 25
itself 25
and 25
with 25
its 25
own 25
forms 25
it 25
is 25
obviously 25
a 25
much 25
more 25
difficult 25
task 25
for 25
reason 25
to 25
strike 25
into 25
the 25
sure 25
path 25
of 25
science 25
where 25
it 25
has 25
to 25
deal 25
not 25
simply 25
with 25
itself 25
but 25
with 25
objects 25
external 25
to 25
itself 25
hence 25
logic 25
is 25
properly 25
only 25
a 25
propaedeuticforms 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
the 25
vestibule 25
of 25
the 25
sciences 25
and 25
while 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
form 25
a 25
correct 25
judgement 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
various 25
branches 25
of 25
knowledge 25
still 25
the 25
acquisition 25
of 25
real 25
substantive 25
knowledge 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
sought 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
sciences 25
properly 25
so 25
called 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
objective 25
sciences 25
now 25
these 25
sciences 25
if 25
they 25
can 25
be 25
termed 25
rational 25
at 25
all 25
must 25
contain 25
elements 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
and 25
this 25
cognition 25
may 25
stand 25
in 25
a 25
twofold 25
relation 25
to 25
its 25
object 25
either 25
it 25
may 25
have 25
to 25
determine 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
objectwhich 25
must 25
be 25
supplied 25
extraneously 25

it 25
may 25
have 25
to 25
establish 25

a 25

must 25
be 25
treated 25
first 25
and 25
must 25
be 25
carefully 25
distinguished 25
from 25

supplied 25
from 25
other 25

any 25

only 25
lead 25
to 25
irremediable 25
confusion 25
mathematics 25
and 25
physics 25
are 25
the 25
two 25
theoretical 25
sciences 25
which 25
have 25
to 25
determine 25
their 25

purely 25
a 25

the 25

is 25
also 25

on 25
other 25
sources 25
of 25

in 25
the 25

times 25
of 25
which 25
history 25
affords 25
us 25
any 25

mathematics 25
had 25
already 25
entered 25
on 25
the 25

of 25
science 25
among 25
that 25
wonderful 25
nation 25
the 25
greeks 25
still 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
supposed 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
as 25
easy 25
for 25
this 25
science 25
to 25
strike 25
into 25
or 25
rather 25
to 25
construct 25
for 25
itself 25
that 25
royal 25
road 25
as 25
it 25
was 25
for 25
logic 25
in 25
which 25
reason 25
has 25
only 25
to 25
deal 25
with 25
itself 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
i 25
believe 25
that 25
it 25
must 25
have 25
remained 25
longchiefly 25
among 25
the 25
egyptiansin 25

stage 25
of 25
blind 25
groping 25
after 25
its 25
true 25
aims 25
and 25
destination 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
revolutionized 25
by 25
the 25
happy 25
idea 25
of 25
one 25
man 25
who 25
struck 25
out 25
and 25
determined 25
for 25
all 25
time 25
the 25
path 25
which 25
this 25
science 25
must 25
follow 25

this 25
intellectual 25

more 25
important 25
in 25
its 25
results 25
than 25
the 25
discovery 25
of 25
the 25
passage 25
round 25

celebrated 25
cape 25
of 25
good 25

of 25

diogenes 25
laertius 25
in 25
naming 25

supposed 25

of 25
the 25

according 25

not 25

require 25
to 25
be 25
provedmakes 25
it 25
apparent 25
that 25
the 25
change 25
introduced 25
by 25
the 25
first 25
indication 25
of 25
this 25
new 25
path 25
must 25
have 25
seemed 25
of 25
the 25
utmost 25
importance 25
to 25
the 25
mathematicians 25
of 25
that 25
age 25
and 25
it 25
has 25
thus 25
been 25
secured 25
against 25
the 25
chance 25
of 25
oblivion 25
a 25
new 25
light 25
must 25
have 25
flashed 25
on 25
the 25
mind 25
of 25
the 25
first 25
man 25
thales 25
or 25
whatever 25
may 25
have 25
been 25
his 25
name 25
who 25
demonstrated 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
the 25
isosceles 25
triangle 25
for 25
he 25
found 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
not 25
sufficient 25
to 25
meditate 25
on 25
the 25
figure 25
as 25
it 25
lay 25
before 25
his 25
eyes 25
or 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
as 25
it 25
existed 25
in 25
his 25
mind 25
and 25
thus 25
endeavour 25
to 25
get 25
at 25
the 25
knowledge 25
of 25
its 25
properties 25
but 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
necessary 25
to 25
produce 25
these 25
properties 25

it 25
were 25
by 25
a 25
positive 25
a 25
priori 25
construction 25
and 25
that 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
arrive 25
with 25
certainty 25
at 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
he 25
must 25
not 25
attribute 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
any 25
other 25
properties 25
than 25
those 25
which 25
necessarily 25
followed 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
he 25
had 25
himself 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
his 25
conception 25
placed 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
a 25
much 25
longer 25
period 25
elapsed 25
before 25
physics 25
entered 25
on 25
the 25
highway 25
of 25
science 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
about 25
a 25
century 25
and 25
a 25
half 25
since 25
the 25
wise 25
bacon 25
gave 25
a 25
new 25
direction 25
to 25
physical 25
studies 25

ratheras 25
others 25

already 25

fresh 25

to 25
the 25
pursuit 25
of 25
this 25
new 25
direction 25
here 25
too 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
mathematics 25
we 25
find 25
evidence 25
of 25
a 25
rapid 25
intellectual 25
revolution 25
in 25
the 25
remarks 25
which 25
follow 25

shall 25
confine 25
myself 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
side 25
of 25
natural 25
science 25
when 25
galilei 25
experimented 25
with 25
balls 25
of 25
a 25
definite 25
weight 25
on 25
the 25
inclined 25
plane 25
when 25
torricelli 25
caused 25
the 25
air 25
to 25
sustain 25
a 25
weight 25
which 25
he 25
had 25
calculated 25
beforehand 25
to 25
be 25
equal 25
to 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
definite 25
column 25
of 25
water 25
or 25
when 25
stahl 25
at 25
a 25
later 25
period 25
converted 25
metals 25
into 25
lime 25
and 25
reconverted 25
lime 25
into 25
metal 25
by 25
the 25
addition 25
and 25
subtraction 25
of 25
certain 25
elements 25
footnote 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
here 25
follow 25
with 25
exactness 25
the 25
history 25
of 25
the 25
experimental 25
method 25
of 25
which 25
indeed 25
the 25
first 25
steps 25
are 25
involved 25
in 25
some 25
obscurity 25
a 25
light 25
broke 25
upon 25
all 25
natural 25
philosophers 25
they 25
learned 25
that 25
reason 25
only 25
perceives 25
that 25
which 25
it 25
produces 25
after 25
its 25
own 25
design 25
that 25
it 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
content 25
to 25
follow 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
in 25
the 25
leadingstrings 25
of 25
nature 25
but 25
must 25
proceed 25
in 25
advance 25
with 25
principles 25
of 25
judgement 25
according 25
to 25
unvarying 25
laws 25
and 25
compel 25
nature 25
to 25
reply 25
its 25
questions 25
for 25
accidental 25
observations 25
made 25
according 25
to 25
no 25
preconceived 25
plan 25
cannot 25
be 25
united 25
under 25
a 25
necessary 25
law 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
this 25
that 25
reason 25
seeks 25
for 25
and 25
requires 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
can 25
give 25
to 25
concordant 25
phenomena 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
laws 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
when 25
experiment 25
is 25
directed 25
by 25
these 25
rational 25
principles 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
have 25
any 25
real 25
utility 25
reason 25
must 25
approach 25
nature 25
with 25
the 25
view 25
indeed 25
of 25
receiving 25
information 25
from 25
it 25
not 25
however 25
in 25
the 25
character 25
of 25
a 25
pupil 25
who 25
listens 25
to 25
all 25
that 25
his 25
master 25
chooses 25
to 25
tell 25
him 25
but 25
in 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
judge 25
who 25
compels 25
the 25
witnesses 25
to 25
reply 25
to 25
those 25
questions 25
which 25
he 25
himself 25
thinks 25
fit 25
to 25
propose 25
to 25
this 25
single 25
idea 25
must 25
the 25
revolution 25
be 25
ascribed 25
by 25
which 25
after 25
groping 25
in 25
the 25
dark 25
for 25
so 25
many 25
centuries 25
natural 25
science 25
was 25
at 25
length 25
conducted 25
into 25
the 25
path 25
of 25
certain 25
progress 25
we 25
come 25
now 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
a 25
purely 25
speculative 25
science 25
which 25
occupies 25
a 25
completely 25
isolated 25
position 25
and 25
is 25
entirely 25
independent 25
of 25
the 25
teachings 25
of 25
experience 25
it 25
deals 25
with 25
mere 25
conceptionsnot 25
like 25
mathematics 25
with 25
conceptions 25
applied 25
to 25
intuitionand 25
in 25
it 25
reason 25
is 25
the 25
pupil 25
of 25
itself 25
alone 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
oldest 25
of 25
the 25
sciences 25
and 25
would 25
still 25
survive 25
even 25
if 25
all 25
the 25
rest 25
were 25
swallowed 25
up 25
in 25
the 25
abyss 25
of 25
an 25
alldestroying 25
barbarism 25
but 25
it 25
has 25
not 25
yet 25
had 25
the 25
good 25
fortune 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
the 25
sure 25
scientific 25
method 25
this 25
will 25
be 25
apparent 25
if 25
we 25
apply 25
the 25
tests 25
which 25
we 25
proposed 25
at 25
the 25
outset 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
reason 25
perpetually 25
comes 25
to 25
a 25
stand 25
when 25
it 25
attempts 25
to 25
gain 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
perception 25
even 25
of 25
those 25
laws 25
which 25
the 25
most 25
common 25
experience 25
confirms 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
compelled 25
to 25
retrace 25
its 25
steps 25
in 25
innumerable 25
instances 25
and 25
to 25
abandon 25
the 25
path 25
on 25
which 25
it 25
had 25
entered 25
because 25
this 25
does 25
not 25
lead 25
to 25
the 25
desired 25
result 25
we 25
find 25
too 25
that 25
those 25
who 25
are 25
engaged 25
in 25
metaphysical 25
pursuits 25
are 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
agree 25
among 25
themselves 25
but 25
that 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
this 25
science 25
appears 25
to 25
furnish 25
an 25
arena 25
specially 25
adapted 25
for 25
the 25
display 25
of 25
skill 25
or 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
strength 25
in 25
mockcontests 25
a 25
field 25
in 25
which 25
no 25
combatant 25
ever 25
yet 25
succeeded 25
in 25
gaining 25
an 25
inch 25
of 25
ground 25
in 25
which 25
at 25
least 25
no 25
victory 25
was 25
ever 25
yet 25
crowned 25
with 25
permanent 25
possession 25
this 25
leads 25
us 25
to 25
inquire 25
why 25
it 25
is 25
that 25
in 25
metaphysics 25
the 25
sure 25
path 25
of 25
science 25
has 25
not 25
hitherto 25
been 25
found 25
shall 25
we 25
suppose 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
discover 25
it 25
why 25
then 25
should 25
nature 25
have 25
visited 25
our 25
reason 25
with 25
restless 25
aspirations 25
after 25
it 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
one 25
of 25
our 25
weightiest 25
concerns 25
nay 25
more 25
how 25
little 25
cause 25
should 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
place 25
confidence 25
in 25
our 25
reason 25
if 25
it 25
abandons 25
us 25
in 25
a 25
matter 25
about 25
which 25
most 25
of 25
all 25
we 25
desire 25
to 25
know 25
the 25
truthand 25
not 25
only 25
so 25
but 25
even 25
allures 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
pursuit 25
of 25
vain 25
phantoms 25
only 25
to 25
betray 25
us 25
in 25
the 25
end 25
or 25
if 25
the 25
path 25
has 25
only 25
hitherto 25
been 25
missed 25
what 25
indications 25
do 25
we 25
possess 25
to 25
guide 25
us 25
in 25
a 25
renewed 25
investigation 25
and 25
to 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
hope 25
for 25
greater 25
success 25
than 25
has 25
fallen 25
to 25
the 25
lot 25
of 25
our 25
predecessors 25
it 25
appears 25
to 25
me 25
that 25
the 25
examples 25
of 25
mathematics 25
and 25
natural 25
philosophy 25
which 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
seen 25
were 25
brought 25
into 25
their 25
present 25
condition 25
by 25
a 25
sudden 25
revolution 25
are 25
sufficiently 25
remarkable 25
to 25
fix 25
our 25
attention 25
on 25
the 25
essential 25
circumstances 25
of 25
the 25
change 25
which 25
has 25
proved 25
so 25
advantageous 25
to 25
them 25
and 25
to 25
induce 25
us 25
to 25
make 25
the 25
experiment 25
of 25
imitating 25
them 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
analogy 25
which 25
as 25
rational 25
sciences 25
they 25
bear 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
may 25
permit 25
it 25
has 25
hitherto 25
been 25
assumed 25
that 25
our 25
cognition 25
must 25
conform 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
but 25
all 25
attempts 25
to 25
ascertain 25
anything 25
about 25
these 25
objects 25
a 25
priori 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
extend 25
the 25
range 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
have 25
been 25
rendered 25
abortive 25
by 25
this 25
assumption 25
let 25
us 25
then 25
make 25
the 25
experiment 25
whether 25
we 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
more 25
successful 25
in 25
metaphysics 25
if 25
we 25
assume 25
that 25
the 25
objects 25
must 25
conform 25
to 25
our 25
cognition 25
this 25
appears 25
at 25
all 25
events 25
to 25
accord 25
better 25
with 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
our 25
gaining 25
the 25
end 25
we 25
have 25
in 25
view 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
of 25
arriving 25
at 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
a 25
priori 25
of 25
determining 25
something 25
with 25
respect 25
to 25
these 25
objects 25
before 25
they 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
we 25
here 25
propose 25
to 25
do 25
just 25
what 25
copernicus 25
did 25
in 25
attempting 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
celestial 25
movements 25
when 25
he 25
found 25
that 25
he 25
could 25
make 25
no 25
progress 25
by 25
assuming 25
that 25
all 25
the 25
heavenly 25
bodies 25
revolved 25
round 25
the 25
spectator 25
he 25
reversed 25
the 25
process 25
and 25
tried 25
the 25
experiment 25
of 25
assuming 25
that 25
the 25
spectator 25
revolved 25
while 25
the 25
stars 25
remained 25
at 25
rest 25
we 25
may 25
make 25
the 25
same 25
experiment 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
objects 25
if 25
the 25
intuition 25
must 25
conform 25
to 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
objects 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
see 25
how 25
we 25
can 25
know 25
anything 25
of 25
them 25
a 25
priori 25
if 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
object 25
conforms 25
to 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
intuition 25
i 25
can 25
then 25
easily 25
conceive 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
now 25
as 25
i 25
cannot 25
rest 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
intuitions 25
butif 25
they 25
are 25
to 25
become 25
cognitionsmust 25
refer 25
them 25
as 25
representations 25
to 25
something 25
as 25
object 25
and 25
must 25
determine 25
the 25
latter 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
here 25
again 25

two 25

this 25

i 25
am 25
reduced 25

i 25
may 25

i 25
am 25
at 25
no 25
loss 25
how 25
to 25
proceed 25
for 25
experience 25
itself 25
is 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
cognition 25
which 25
requires 25
understanding 25
before 25
objects 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
me 25
that 25
is 25
a 25

presuppose 25
in 25
myself 25
laws 25
of 25

are 25
expressed 25

these 25
conceptions 25
then 25
all 25
the 25

must 25
necessarily 25
conform 25
now 25
there 25
are 25
objects 25
which 25
reason 25
thinks 25

that 25
necessarily 25

the 25

these 25

hereafter 25
furnish 25
an 25
excellent 25
test 25
of 25
the 25
new 25
method 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
adopted 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
based 25
on 25
the 25
principle 25
that 25
we 25
only 25
cognize 25
in 25
things 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
which 25
we 25
ourselves 25
place 25
in 25
them 25
footnote 25
this 25
method 25
accordingly 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
borrowed 25
from 25
the 25
natural 25
philosopher 25
consists 25
in 25
seeking 25
for 25
the 25
elements 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
admits 25
of 25
confirmation 25
or 25
refutation 25
by 25
experiment 25
now 25
the 25
propositions 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
especially 25
when 25
they 25
transcend 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
do 25
not 25
admit 25
of 25
our 25
making 25
any 25
experiment 25
with 25
their 25
objects 25
as 25
in 25
natural 25
science 25
hence 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
those 25
conceptions 25
and 25
principles 25
which 25
we 25
assume 25
a 25
priori 25
our 25
only 25
course 25
ill 25
be 25
to 25
view 25
them 25
from 25
two 25
different 25
sides 25
we 25
must 25
regard 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
conception 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
experience 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
senses 25
and 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
reason 25
isolated 25
and 25
transcending 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
mere 25
thought 25
now 25
if 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
when 25
we 25
regard 25
things 25
from 25
this 25
double 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
the 25
result 25
is 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
but 25
that 25
when 25
we 25
regard 25
them 25
from 25
a 25
single 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
reason 25
is 25
involved 25
in 25
selfcontradiction 25
then 25
the 25
experiment 25
will 25
establish 25
the 25
correctness 25
of 25
this 25
distinction 25
this 25
attempt 25
succeeds 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
we 25
could 25
desire 25
and 25
promises 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
in 25
its 25
first 25
partthat 25
is 25
where 25
it 25
is 25
occupied 25
with 25
conceptions 25
a 25
priori 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
corresponding 25
objects 25
may 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
experiencethe 25
certain 25
course 25
of 25
science 25
for 25
by 25
this 25
new 25
method 25
we 25
are 25
enabled 25
perfectly 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
and 25
what 25
is 25
more 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
satisfactorily 25
the 25
laws 25
which 25
lie 25
a 25
priori 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
experienceneither 25
of 25
which 25
was 25
possible 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
procedure 25
hitherto 25
followed 25
but 25
from 25
this 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
part 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
we 25
derive 25
a 25
surprising 25
result 25
and 25
one 25
which 25
to 25
all 25
appearance 25
militates 25
against 25
the 25
great 25
end 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
as 25
treated 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
part 25
for 25
we 25
come 25
to 25
the 25
conclusion 25
that 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
is 25
unable 25
to 25
transcend 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
yet 25
this 25
is 25
precisely 25
the 25
most 25
essential 25
object 25
of 25
this 25
science 25
the 25
estimate 25
of 25
our 25
rational 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
at 25
which 25
we 25
arrive 25
is 25
that 25
it 25
has 25
only 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
phenomena 25
and 25
that 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
while 25
possessing 25
a 25
real 25
existence 25
lie 25
beyond 25
its 25
sphere 25
here 25
we 25
are 25
enabled 25
to 25
put 25
the 25
justice 25
of 25
this 25
estimate 25
to 25
the 25
test 25
for 25
that 25
which 25
of 25
necessity 25
impels 25
us 25
to 25
transcend 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
of 25
all 25
phenomena 25
is 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
which 25
reason 25
absolutely 25
requires 25
in 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
complete 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
now 25
if 25
it 25
appears 25
that 25
when 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
we 25
assume 25
that 25
our 25
cognition 25
conforms 25
to 25
its 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
cannot 25
be 25
thought 25
without 25
contradiction 25
and 25
that 25
when 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
assume 25
that 25
our 25
representation 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
does 25
not 25
conform 25
to 25
these 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
that 25
these 25
objects 25
as 25
phenomena 25
conform 25
to 25
our 25
mode 25
of 25
representation 25
the 25
contradiction 25
disappears 25
we 25
shall 25
then 25
be 25
convinced 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
we 25
began 25
by 25
assuming 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
experiment 25
we 25
may 25
look 25
upon 25
it 25
as 25
established 25
that 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
does 25
not 25
lie 25
in 25
things 25
as 25
we 25
know 25
them 25
or 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
but 25
in 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
beyond 25
the 25
range 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
footnote 25
this 25
experiment 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
has 25
a 25
great 25
similarity 25
to 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
chemists 25
which 25
they 25
term 25
the 25
experiment 25
of 25
reduction 25
or 25
more 25
usually 25
the 25
synthetic 25
process 25
the 25
analysis 25
of 25
the 25
metaphysician 25
separates 25
pure 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
into 25
two 25
heterogeneous 25
elements 25
viz 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
and 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
dialectic 25
combines 25
these 25
again 25
into 25
harmony 25
with 25
the 25
necessary 25
rational 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
finds 25
that 25
this 25
harmony 25
never 25
results 25
except 25
through 25
the 25
above 25
distinction 25
which 25
is 25
therefore 25
concluded 25
to 25
be 25
just 25
but 25
after 25
we 25
have 25
thus 25
denied 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
to 25
make 25
any 25
progress 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
supersensible 25
it 25
still 25
remains 25
for 25
our 25
consideration 25
whether 25
data 25
do 25
not 25
exist 25
in 25
practical 25
cognition 25
which 25
may 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
determine 25
the 25
transcendent 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
to 25
rise 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
experience 25
from 25
a 25
practical 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
satisfy 25
the 25
great 25
ends 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
speculative 25
reason 25
has 25
thus 25
at 25
least 25
made 25
room 25
for 25
such 25
an 25
extension 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
and 25
if 25
it 25
must 25
leave 25
this 25
space 25
vacant 25
still 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
rob 25
us 25
of 25
the 25
liberty 25
to 25
fill 25
it 25
up 25
if 25
we 25
can 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
practical 25
datanay 25
it 25
even 25

hypothesis 25

at 25
the 25

at 25
such 25
a 25

of 25

are 25
always 25
hypothetical 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
critique 25
itself 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
not 25
hypothetically 25
but 25
apodeictically 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
representations 25
of 25

introduce 25
a 25
complete 25
revolution 25
in 25

of 25
the 25
science 25
itself 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
it 25
marks 25
out 25
and 25
defines 25
both 25
the 25
external 25
boundaries 25
and 25
the 25
internal 25
structure 25
of 25
this 25
science 25
for 25
pure 25
speculative 25
reason 25
has 25
this 25
peculiarity 25
that 25
in 25
choosing 25
the 25
various 25
objects 25
of 25
thought 25
it 25
is 25
able 25
to 25
define 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
faculties 25
and 25
even 25
to 25
give 25
a 25
complete 25
enumeration 25
of 25
the 25
possible 25
modes 25
of 25
proposing 25
problems 25
to 25
itself 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
sketch 25
out 25
the 25
entire 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
for 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
in 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
nothing 25
must 25
be 25
attributed 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
but 25
what 25
the 25
thinking 25
subject 25
derives 25
from 25
itself 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
reason 25
is 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
cognition 25
a 25
perfectly 25
distinct 25
independent 25
unity 25
in 25
which 25
as 25
in 25
an 25
organized 25
body 25
every 25
member 25
exists 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
the 25
others 25
and 25
all 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
each 25
so 25
that 25
no 25
principle 25
can 25
be 25
viewed 25
with 25
safety 25
in 25
one 25
relationship 25
unless 25
it 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
viewed 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
total 25
use 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
hence 25
too 25
metaphysics 25
has 25
this 25
singular 25
advantagean 25
advantage 25
which 25
falls 25
to 25
the 25
lot 25
of 25
no 25
other 25
science 25
which 25
has 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
objectsthat 25
if 25
once 25
it 25
is 25
conducted 25
into 25
the 25
sure 25
path 25
of 25
science 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
this 25
criticism 25
it 25
can 25
then 25
take 25
in 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
its 25
cognitions 25
and 25
can 25
thus 25
complete 25
its 25
work 25
and 25
leave 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
posterity 25
as 25
a 25
capital 25
which 25
can 25
never 25
receive 25
fresh 25
accessions 25
for 25
metaphysics 25
has 25
to 25
deal 25
only 25
with 25
principles 25
and 25
with 25
the 25
limitations 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
employment 25
as 25
determined 25
by 25
these 25
principles 25
to 25
this 25
perfection 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
bound 25
as 25
the 25
fundamental 25
science 25
to 25
attain 25
and 25
to 25
it 25
the 25
maxim 25
may 25
justly 25
be 25
applied 25
nil 25
actum 25
reputans 25
si 25
quid 25
superesset 25
agendum 25
but 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
asked 25
what 25
kind 25
of 25
a 25
treasure 25
is 25
this 25
that 25
we 25
propose 25
to 25
bequeath 25
to 25
posterity 25
what 25
is 25
the 25
real 25
value 25
of 25
this 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
purified 25
by 25
criticism 25
and 25
thereby 25
reduced 25
to 25
a 25
permanent 25
condition 25
a 25
cursory 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
work 25
will 25
lead 25
to 25
the 25
supposition 25
that 25
its 25
use 25
is 25
merely 25
negative 25
that 25
it 25
only 25
serves 25
to 25
warn 25
us 25
against 25
venturing 25
with 25
speculative 25
reason 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
this 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
its 25
primary 25
use 25
but 25
this 25
at 25
once 25
assumes 25
a 25
positive 25
value 25
when 25
we 25
observe 25
that 25
the 25
principles 25
with 25
which 25
speculative 25
reason 25
endeavours 25
to 25
transcend 25
its 25
limits 25
lead 25
inevitably 25
not 25
to 25
the 25
extension 25
but 25
to 25
the 25
contraction 25
of 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
reason 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
threaten 25
to 25
extend 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
sensibility 25
which 25
is 25
their 25
proper 25
sphere 25
over 25
the 25
entire 25
realm 25
of 25
thought 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
supplant 25
the 25
pure 25
practical 25
use 25
of 25
reason 25
so 25
far 25
then 25
as 25
this 25
criticism 25
is 25
occupied 25
in 25
confining 25
speculative 25
reason 25
within 25
its 25
proper 25
bounds 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
negative 25
but 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
thereby 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
removes 25
an 25
obstacle 25
which 25
impedes 25
and 25
even 25
threatens 25
to 25
destroy 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
practical 25
reason 25
it 25
possesses 25
a 25
positive 25
and 25
very 25
important 25
value 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
admit 25
this 25
we 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
be 25
convinced 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
use 25
of 25
pure 25
reasonthe 25
moral 25
usein 25
which 25
it 25
inevitably 25
transcends 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
sensibility 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
speculation 25
requiring 25
only 25
to 25
be 25
insured 25
against 25
the 25
effects 25
of 25
a 25
speculation 25
which 25
would 25
involve 25
it 25
in 25
contradiction 25
with 25
itself 25
to 25
deny 25
the 25
positive 25
advantage 25
of 25
the 25
service 25
which 25
this 25
criticism 25
renders 25
us 25
would 25
be 25
as 25
absurd 25
as 25
to 25
maintain 25
that 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
police 25
is 25
productive 25
of 25
no 25
positive 25
benefit 25
since 25
its 25
main 25
business 25
is 25
to 25
prevent 25
the 25
violence 25
which 25
citizen 25
has 25
to 25
apprehend 25
from 25
citizen 25
that 25
so 25
each 25
may 25
pursue 25
his 25
vocation 25
in 25
peace 25
and 25
security 25
that 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
are 25
only 25
forms 25
of 25
sensible 25
intuition 25
and 25
hence 25
are 25
only 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
that 25
moreover 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
consequently 25
no 25
elements 25
for 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
things 25
except 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
a 25
corresponding 25
intuition 25
can 25
be 25
given 25
to 25
these 25
conceptions 25
that 25
accordingly 25
we 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
only 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
sensible 25
intuition 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
phenomenonall 25
this 25
is 25
proved 25
in 25
the 25
analytical 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
critique 25
and 25
from 25
this 25
the 25
limitation 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
speculative 25
cognition 25
to 25
the 25
mere 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
follows 25
as 25
a 25
necessary 25
result 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
carefully 25
borne 25
in 25
mind 25
that 25
while 25
we 25
surrender 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
cognizing 25
we 25
still 25
reserve 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
thinking 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
for 25
otherwise 25
we 25
should 25
require 25
to 25
affirm 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
appearance 25
without 25
something 25
that 25
appearswhich 25
would 25
be 25
absurd 25
now 25
let 25
us 25
suppose 25
for 25
a 25
moment 25
that 25
we 25
had 25
not 25
undertaken 25
this 25
criticism 25
and 25
accordingly 25
had 25
not 25
drawn 25
the 25
necessary 25
distinction 25
between 25
things 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
and 25
by 25
consequence 25
the 25
mechanism 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
determined 25
by 25
causality 25
would 25
then 25
have 25
absolute 25
validity 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
all 25
things 25
as 25
efficient 25
causes 25
i 25
should 25
then 25
be 25
unable 25
to 25
assert 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
being 25
eg 25
the 25
human 25
soul 25
that 25
its 25
will 25
is 25
free 25
and 25
yet 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
subject 25
to 25
natural 25
necessity 25
that 25
is 25
not 25
free 25
without 25
falling 25
into 25
a 25
palpable 25
contradiction 25
for 25
in 25
both 25
propositions 25
i 25
should 25
take 25
the 25
soul 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
signification 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
general 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itselfas 25
without 25
previous 25
criticism 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
but 25
take 25
it 25
suppose 25
now 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
undertaken 25
this 25
criticism 25
and 25
have 25
learnt 25
that 25
an 25
object 25
may 25
be 25
taken 25
in 25
two 25
senses 25
first 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
secondly 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
that 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
has 25
reference 25
only 25
to 25
things 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
sense 25
we 25
then 25
see 25
how 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
involve 25
any 25
contradiction 25
to 25
assert 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
that 25
the 25
will 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
spherein 25
visible 25
actionis 25
necessarily 25
obedient 25
to 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
not 25
free 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
that 25
as 25
belonging 25
to 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
subject 25
to 25
that 25
law 25
and 25
accordingly 25
is 25
free 25
now 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
that 25
i 25
cannot 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
and 25
still 25
less 25
by 25
empirical 25
observation 25
cognize 25
my 25
soul 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
cognize 25
liberty 25
as 25
the 25
property 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
to 25
which 25
i 25
ascribe 25
effects 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
for 25
to 25
do 25
so 25
i 25
must 25
cognize 25
this 25
being 25
as 25
existing 25
and 25
yet 25
not 25
in 25
time 25
whichsince 25
i 25
cannot 25
support 25
my 25
conception 25
by 25
any 25
intuitionis 25
impossible 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
while 25
i 25
cannot 25
cognize 25
i 25
can 25
quite 25
well 25
think 25
freedom 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
my 25
representation 25
of 25
it 25
involves 25
at 25
least 25
no 25
contradiction 25
if 25
we 25
bear 25
in 25
mind 25
the 25
critical 25
distinction 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
modes 25
of 25
representation 25
the 25
sensible 25
and 25
the 25
intellectual 25
and 25
the 25
consequent 25
limitation 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
which 25
flow 25
from 25
them 25
suppose 25
now 25
that 25
morality 25
necessarily 25
presupposed 25
liberty 25
in 25
the 25
strictest 25
sense 25
as 25
a 25
property 25
of 25
our 25
will 25
suppose 25
that 25
reason 25
contained 25
certain 25
practical 25
original 25
principles 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
were 25
absolutely 25
impossible 25
without 25
this 25
presupposition 25
and 25
suppose 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
that 25
speculative 25
reason 25
had 25
proved 25
that 25
liberty 25
was 25
incapable 25
of 25
being 25
thought 25
at 25
all 25
it 25
would 25
then 25
follow 25
that 25
the 25
moral 25
presupposition 25
must 25
give 25
way 25
to 25
the 25
speculative 25
affirmation 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
which 25
involves 25
an 25
obvious 25
contradiction 25
and 25
that 25
liberty 25
and 25
with 25
it 25
morality 25
must 25
yield 25
to 25
the 25
mechanism 25
of 25
nature 25
for 25
the 25
negation 25
of 25
morality 25
involves 25
no 25
contradiction 25
except 25
on 25
the 25
presupposition 25
of 25
liberty 25
now 25
morality 25
does 25
not 25
require 25
the 25
speculative 25
cognition 25
of 25
liberty 25
it 25
is 25
enough 25
that 25
i 25
can 25
think 25
it 25
that 25
its 25
conception 25
involves 25
no 25
contradiction 25
that 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
interfere 25
with 25
the 25
mechanism 25
of 25
nature 25
but 25
even 25
this 25
requirement 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
satisfy 25
if 25
we 25
had 25
not 25
learnt 25
the 25
twofold 25
sense 25
in 25
which 25
things 25
may 25
be 25
taken 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
that 25
the 25
doctrine 25
of 25
morality 25
and 25
the 25
doctrine 25
of 25
nature 25
are 25
confined 25
within 25
their 25
proper 25
limits 25
for 25
this 25
result 25
then 25
we 25
are 25
indebted 25
to 25
a 25
criticism 25
which 25
warns 25
us 25
of 25
our 25
unavoidable 25
ignorance 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
establishes 25
the 25
necessary 25
limitation 25
of 25
our 25
theoretical 25
cognition 25

the 25

that 25
random 25

an 25
important 25

the 25
inquiring 25

the 25

them 25
as 25

the 25
idle 25

above 25
all 25

an 25
inestimable 25
benefit 25
on 25
morality 25

that 25
all 25

socratic 25
method 25

plain 25
that 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
arises 25
from 25
the 25
feeling 25
which 25
exists 25
in 25
the 25
breast 25
of 25
every 25
man 25

the 25
temporal 25
is 25
inadequate 25

satisfy 25
the 25

manner 25

in 25
opposition 25
to 25
all 25
the 25
claims 25

gives 25
rise 25
to 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
freedom 25

that 25
the 25
glorious 25
order 25
beauty 25
and 25
providential 25
care 25
everywhere 25
displayed 25
in 25
nature 25

rise 25
to 25
the 25
belief 25
in 25
a 25
wise 25
and 25
great 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
such 25
is 25
the 25
genesis 25
of 25
these 25
general 25
convictions 25
of 25
mankind 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
depend 25
on 25
rational 25
grounds 25

this 25
public 25
property 25
not 25
only 25
remains 25
undisturbed 25
but 25
is 25
even 25
raised 25
to 25
greater 25
importance 25
by 25
the 25
doctrine 25
that 25

no 25
right 25
to 25
arrogate 25

ever 25
held 25

us 25
in 25
the 25
highest 25
estimation 25
can 25
without 25
difficulty 25
attain 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
schools 25
should 25
therefore 25
confine 25
themselves 25
to 25
the 25
elaboration 25

these 25
universally 25
comprehensible 25

arrogant 25

the 25

are 25
dangerous 25

the 25

favour 25
a 25
criticism 25

this 25
kind 25
by 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
labours 25
of 25
reason 25
can 25
be 25
established 25
on 25
a 25
firm 25
basis 25
than 25
to 25
support 25
the 25
ridiculous 25
despotism 25
of 25
the 25
schools 25
which 25
raise 25
a 25
loud 25
cry 25
of 25
danger 25
to 25
the 25
public 25
over 25
the 25
destruction 25
of 25
cobwebs 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
public 25
has 25
never 25
taken 25
any 25
notice 25
and 25
the 25
loss 25
of 25
which 25
therefore 25
it 25
can 25
never 25
feel 25
this 25
critical 25
science 25
is 25
not 25
opposed 25
to 25
the 25
dogmatic 25
procedure 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
pure 25
cognition 25
for 25
pure 25
cognition 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
dogmatic 25
that 25
is 25
must 25
rest 25
on 25
strict 25
demonstration 25
from 25
sure 25
principles 25
a 25
prioribut 25
to 25
dogmatism 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
the 25
presumption 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
make 25
any 25
progress 25
with 25
a 25
pure 25
cognition 25
derived 25
from 25
philosophical 25
conceptions 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
which 25
reason 25
has 25
long 25
been 25
in 25
the 25
habit 25
of 25
employing 25
without 25
first 25
inquiring 25
in 25
what 25
way 25
and 25
by 25
what 25
right 25
reason 25
has 25
come 25
into 25
the 25
possession 25
of 25
these 25
principles 25
dogmatism 25
is 25
thus 25
the 25
dogmatic 25
procedure 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
without 25
previous 25
criticism 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
powers 25
and 25
in 25
opposing 25
this 25
procedure 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
supposed 25
to 25
lend 25
any 25
countenance 25
to 25
that 25
loquacious 25
shallowness 25
which 25
arrogates 25
to 25
itself 25
the 25
name 25
of 25
popularity 25
nor 25
yet 25
to 25
scepticism 25
which 25
makes 25
short 25
work 25
with 25
the 25
whole 25
science 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
our 25
criticism 25
is 25
the 25
necessary 25
preparation 25
for 25
a 25
thoroughly 25
scientific 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
which 25
must 25
perform 25
its 25
task 25
entirely 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
the 25
complete 25
satisfaction 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
and 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
treated 25
not 25
popularly 25
but 25
scholastically 25
in 25
carrying 25
out 25
the 25
plan 25
which 25
the 25
critique 25
prescribes 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
future 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
we 25
must 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
the 25
strict 25
method 25
of 25
the 25
celebrated 25
wolf 25
the 25
greatest 25
of 25
all 25
dogmatic 25
philosophers 25
he 25
was 25
the 25
first 25
to 25
point 25
out 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
establishing 25
fixed 25
principles 25
of 25
clearly 25
defining 25
our 25
conceptions 25
and 25
of 25
subjecting 25
our 25
demonstrations 25
to 25
the 25
most 25
severe 25
scrutiny 25
instead 25
of 25
rashly 25
jumping 25
at 25
conclusions 25
the 25
example 25
which 25
he 25
set 25
served 25
to 25
awaken 25
that 25
spirit 25
of 25
profound 25
and 25
thorough 25
investigation 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
yet 25
extinct 25
in 25
germany 25
he 25
would 25
have 25
been 25
peculiarly 25
well 25
fitted 25
to 25
give 25
a 25
truly 25
scientific 25
character 25
to 25
metaphysical 25
studies 25
had 25
it 25
occurred 25
to 25
him 25
to 25
prepare 25
the 25
field 25
by 25
a 25
criticism 25
of 25
the 25
organum 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
itself 25
that 25
he 25
failed 25
to 25
perceive 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
procedure 25
must 25
be 25
ascribed 25
to 25
the 25
dogmatic 25
mode 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
characterized 25
his 25
age 25
and 25
on 25
this 25
point 25
the 25
philosophers 25
of 25
his 25
time 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
of 25
all 25
previous 25
times 25
have 25
nothing 25
to 25
reproach 25
each 25
other 25
with 25
those 25
who 25
reject 25
at 25
once 25
the 25
method 25
of 25
wolf 25
and 25
of 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
other 25
aim 25
but 25
to 25
shake 25
off 25
the 25
fetters 25
of 25
science 25
to 25
change 25
labour 25
into 25
sport 25
certainty 25
into 25
opinion 25
and 25
philosophy 25
into 25
philodoxy 25
in 25
this 25
second 25
edition 25
i 25
have 25
endeavoured 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
possible 25
to 25
remove 25
the 25
difficulties 25
and 25
obscurity 25
which 25
without 25
fault 25
of 25
mine 25
perhaps 25
have 25
given 25
rise 25
to 25
many 25
misconceptions 25
even 25
among 25
acute 25
thinkers 25
in 25
the 25
propositions 25
themselves 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
demonstrations 25
by 25
which 25
they 25
are 25
supported 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
form 25
and 25
the 25
entire 25
plan 25
of 25
the 25
work 25
i 25
have 25
found 25
nothing 25
to 25
alter 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
attributed 25
partly 25
to 25
the 25
long 25
examination 25
to 25
which 25
i 25
had 25
subjected 25
the 25
whole 25
before 25
offering 25
it 25
to 25
the 25
public 25
and 25
partly 25
to 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
case 25
for 25
pure 25
speculative 25
reason 25
is 25
an 25
organic 25
structure 25
in 25
which 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
isolated 25
or 25
independent 25
but 25
every 25
single 25
part 25
is 25
essential 25
to 25
all 25
the 25
rest 25
and 25
hence 25
the 25
slightest 25
imperfection 25
whether 25
defect 25
or 25
positive 25
error 25
could 25
not 25
fail 25
to 25
betray 25
itself 25
in 25
use 25
i 25
venture 25
further 25
to 25
hope 25
that 25
this 25
system 25
will 25
maintain 25
the 25
same 25
unalterable 25
character 25
for 25
the 25
future 25
i 25
am 25
led 25
to 25
entertain 25
this 25
confidence 25
not 25
by 25
vanity 25
but 25
by 25
the 25
evidence 25
which 25
the 25
equality 25
of 25
the 25
result 25
affords 25
when 25
we 25
proceed 25
first 25
from 25
the 25
simplest 25
elements 25
up 25
to 25
the 25
complete 25
whole 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
and 25
then 25
backwards 25
from 25
the 25
whole 25
to 25
each 25
part 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
the 25
attempt 25
to 25
make 25
the 25
slightest 25
alteration 25
in 25
any 25
part 25
leads 25
inevitably 25
to 25
contradictions 25
not 25
merely 25
in 25
this 25
system 25
but 25
in 25
human 25
reason 25
itself 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
there 25
is 25
still 25
much 25
room 25
for 25
improvement 25
in 25
the 25
exposition 25
of 25
the 25
doctrines 25
contained 25
in 25
this 25
work 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
edition 25
i 25
have 25
endeavoured 25
to 25
remove 25
misapprehensions 25
of 25
the 25
aesthetical 25
part 25
especially 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
time 25
to 25
clear 25
away 25
the 25
obscurity 25
which 25
has 25
been 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
to 25
supply 25
the 25
supposed 25
want 25
of 25
sufficient 25
evidence 25
in 25
the 25
demonstration 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
lastly 25
to 25
obviate 25
the 25
misunderstanding 25
of 25
the 25
paralogisms 25
which 25
immediately 25
precede 25
the 25
rational 25
psychology 25

have 25
not 25
extended 25
my 25
alterations 25
partly 25
from 25
want 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
partly 25
because 25
i 25
am 25
not 25
aware 25
that 25
any 25
portion 25
of 25
the 25
remainder 25
has 25
given 25
rise 25
to 25
misconceptions 25
among 25
intelligent 25

impartial 25
critics 25

a 25

to 25

of 25

of 25

is 25
some 25
obscurity 25
of 25

passage 25

this 25
permanent 25
cannot 25
be 25
an 25
intuition 25
in 25
me 25
for 25
all 25
the 25
determining 25
grounds 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25

as 25
such 25
do 25
themselves 25
require 25
a 25
permanent 25
distinct 25
from 25
them 25

may 25
determine 25
my 25
existence 25

changes 25

they 25
change 25
it 25
may 25
probably 25
be 25
urged 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
this 25
proof 25
that 25
after 25
all 25
i 25
am 25
only 25
conscious 25
immediately 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
in 25
me 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
my 25
representation 25
of 25
external 25
things 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
it 25
must 25
always 25
remain 25
uncertain 25
whether 25
anything 25
corresponding 25
to 25
this 25
representation 25
does 25
or 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
externally 25
to 25
me 25
but 25
i 25
am 25
conscious 25
through 25
internal 25
experience 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
in 25
time 25
consequently 25
also 25
of 25
the 25
determinability 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
and 25
that 25
is 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
simple 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
representation 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
the 25
same 25
as 25
the 25
empirical 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
which 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
determined 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
something 25
which 25
while 25
connected 25
with 25
my 25
existence 25
is 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
this 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
in 25
time 25
is 25
therefore 25
identical 25
with 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
a 25
relation 25
to 25
something 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
experience 25
not 25
fiction 25
sense 25
not 25
imagination 25
which 25
inseparably 25
connects 25
the 25
external 25
with 25
my 25
internal 25
sense 25
for 25
the 25
external 25
sense 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
intuition 25
to 25
something 25
real 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
and 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
this 25
something 25
as 25
opposed 25
to 25
the 25
mere 25
imagination 25
of 25
it 25
rests 25
solely 25
on 25
its 25
inseparable 25
connection 25
with 25
internal 25
experience 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
its 25
possibility 25
if 25
with 25
the 25
intellectual 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
in 25
the 25
representation 25
i 25
am 25
which 25
accompanies 25
all 25
my 25
judgements 25
and 25
all 25
the 25
operations 25
of 25
my 25
understanding 25
i 25
could 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
connect 25
a 25
determination 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
by 25
intellectual 25
intuition 25
then 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
a 25
relation 25
to 25
something 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
necessary 25
but 25
the 25
internal 25
intuition 25
in 25
which 25
alone 25
my 25
existence 25
can 25
be 25
determined 25
though 25
preceded 25
by 25
that 25
purely 25
intellectual 25
consciousness 25
is 25
itself 25
sensible 25
and 25
attached 25
to 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
time 25
hence 25
this 25
determination 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
and 25
consequently 25
my 25
internal 25
experience 25
itself 25
must 25
depend 25
on 25
something 25
permanent 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
in 25
me 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
therefore 25
only 25
in 25
something 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
to 25
which 25
i 25
must 25
look 25
upon 25
myself 25
as 25
being 25
related 25
thus 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
sense 25
is 25
necessarily 25
connected 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
that 25
is 25
i 25
am 25
just 25
as 25
certainly 25
conscious 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
things 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
related 25
to 25
my 25
sense 25
as 25
i 25
am 25
that 25
i 25
myself 25
exist 25
as 25
determined 25
in 25
time 25
but 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
ascertain 25
to 25
what 25
given 25
intuitions 25
objects 25
external 25
me 25
really 25
correspond 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
what 25
intuitions 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
external 25
sense 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
imagination 25
i 25
must 25
have 25
recourse 25
in 25
every 25
particular 25
case 25
to 25
those 25
rules 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
even 25
internal 25
experience 25
is 25
distinguished 25
from 25
imagination 25
and 25
which 25
are 25
always 25
based 25
on 25
the 25
proposition 25
that 25
there 25
really 25
is 25
an 25
external 25
experience 25
we 25
may 25
add 25
the 25
remark 25
that 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
something 25
permanent 25
in 25
existence 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
same 25
thing 25
as 25
the 25
permanent 25
representation 25
for 25
a 25
representation 25
may 25
be 25
very 25
variable 25
and 25
changingas 25
all 25
our 25
representations 25
even 25
that 25
of 25
matter 25
areand 25
yet 25
refer 25
to 25
something 25
permanent 25
which 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
distinct 25
from 25
all 25
my 25
representations 25
and 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
necessarily 25
included 25
in 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
my 25
own 25
existence 25
and 25
with 25
it 25
constitutes 25
one 25
experiencean 25
experience 25
which 25
would 25
not 25
even 25
be 25
possible 25
internally 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
not 25
also 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
in 25
part 25
external 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
we 25
are 25
no 25
more 25
able 25
to 25
reply 25
than 25
we 25
are 25
in 25
general 25
to 25
think 25
the 25
stationary 25
in 25
time 25
the 25
coexistence 25
of 25
which 25
with 25
the 25
variable 25
produces 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
change 25
in 25
attempting 25
to 25
render 25
the 25
exposition 25
of 25
my 25
views 25
as 25
intelligible 25
as 25
possible 25
i 25
have 25
been 25
compelled 25
to 25
leave 25
out 25
or 25
abridge 25
various 25
passages 25
which 25
were 25
not 25
essential 25
to 25
the 25
completeness 25
of 25
the 25
work 25
but 25
which 25
many 25
readers 25
might 25
consider 25
useful 25
in 25
other 25
respects 25
and 25
might 25
be 25
unwilling 25
to 25
miss 25
this 25
trifling 25
loss 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
avoided 25
without 25
swelling 25
the 25
book 25
beyond 25
due 25
limits 25
may 25
be 25
supplied 25
at 25
the 25
pleasure 25
of 25
the 25
reader 25
by 25
a 25
comparison 25
with 25
the 25
first 25
edition 25
and 25
will 25
i 25
hope 25
be 25
more 25
than 25
compensated 25
for 25
by 25
the 25
greater 25
clearness 25
of 25
the 25
exposition 25
as 25
it 25
now 25
stands 25
i 25
have 25
observed 25
with 25
pleasure 25
and 25
thankfulness 25
in 25
the 25
pages 25
of 25
various 25
reviews 25
and 25
treatises 25
that 25
the 25
spirit 25
of 25
profound 25
and 25
thorough 25
investigation 25
is 25
not 25
extinct 25
in 25
germany 25
though 25
it 25
may 25
have 25
been 25
overborne 25
and 25
silenced 25
for 25
a 25
time 25
by 25
the 25
fashionable 25
tone 25
of 25
a 25
licence 25
in 25
thinking 25
which 25
gives 25
itself 25
the 25
airs 25
of 25
genius 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
difficulties 25
which 25
beset 25
the 25
paths 25
of 25
criticism 25
have 25
not 25
prevented 25
energetic 25
and 25
acute 25
thinkers 25
from 25
making 25
themselves 25
masters 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
to 25
which 25
these 25
paths 25

is 25
not 25
popular 25
but 25
scholastic 25
in 25
its 25
character 25
and 25
which 25
alone 25
can 25
hope 25
for 25
a 25
lasting 25
existence 25

an 25
abiding 25
value 25

these 25
deserving 25
men 25

so 25
happily 25
combine 25
profundity 25
of 25

with 25
a 25
talent 25
for 25
lucid 25
expositiona 25

which 25
i 25
myself 25
am 25

leave 25
the 25
task 25
of 25
removing 25
any 25
obscurity 25
which 25
may 25
still 25
adhere 25
to 25
the 25
statement 25
of 25
my 25
doctrines 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
danger 25
is 25
not 25
that 25
of 25
being 25
refuted 25
but 25
of 25
being 25
misunderstood 25
for 25
my 25
own 25
part 25
i 25
must 25
henceforward 25
abstain 25
from 25
controversy 25
although 25
i 25
shall 25
carefully 25
attend 25
to 25
all 25
suggestions 25
whether 25
from 25
friends 25

adversaries 25

this 25
propaedeutic 25

during 25
these 25
labours 25
i 25
have 25
advanced 25
pretty 25
far 25
in 25
years 25

sixtyfourth 25

economize 25
time 25
if 25
i 25
am 25
to 25
carry 25
out 25
my 25
plan 25
of 25
elaborating 25
the 25
metaphysics 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
of 25

introduction 25
i 25
of 25
the 25
difference 25
between 25
pure 25
and 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
that 25
all 25
our 25
knowledge 25
begins 25
with 25
experience 25
there 25
can 25
be 25
no 25
doubt 25
for 25
how 25
is 25
it 25
possible 25
that 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
should 25
be 25
awakened 25
into 25
exercise 25
otherwise 25
than 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
objects 25
which 25
affect 25
our 25
senses 25
and 25
partly 25
of 25
themselves 25
produce 25
representations 25
partly 25
rouse 25
our 25
powers 25
of 25
understanding 25
into 25
activity 25
to 25
compare 25
to 25
connect 25
or 25
to 25
separate 25
these 25
and 25
so 25
to 25
convert 25
the 25
raw 25
material 25
of 25
our 25
sensuous 25
impressions 25
into 25
a 25
knowledge 25
of 25
objects 25
which 25
is 25
called 25
experience 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
time 25
therefore 25
no 25
knowledge 25
of 25
ours 25
is 25
antecedent 25
to 25
experience 25
but 25
begins 25
with 25
it 25
but 25
though 25
all 25
our 25
knowledge 25
begins 25
with 25
experience 25
it 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
follows 25
that 25
all 25
arises 25
out 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
possible 25
that 25
our 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
is 25
a 25
compound 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
we 25
receive 25
through 25
impressions 25
and 25
that 25
which 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
supplies 25
from 25
itself 25
sensuous 25
impressions 25
giving 25
merely 25
the 25
occasion 25
an 25
addition 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
distinguish 25
from 25
the 25
original 25
element 25
given 25
by 25
sense 25
till 25
long 25
practice 25
has 25
made 25
us 25
attentive 25
to 25
and 25
skilful 25
in 25
separating 25
it 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
a 25
question 25
which 25
requires 25
close 25
investigation 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
answered 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
whether 25
there 25
exists 25
a 25
knowledge 25
altogether 25
independent 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
even 25
of 25
all 25
sensuous 25
impressions 25
knowledge 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
is 25
called 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
contradistinction 25
to 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
which 25
has 25
its 25
sources 25
a 25
posteriori 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
experience 25
but 25
the 25
expression 25
a 25
priori 25
is 25
not 25
as 25
yet 25
definite 25
enough 25
adequately 25
to 25
indicate 25
the 25
whole 25
meaning 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
above 25
started 25
for 25
in 25
speaking 25
of 25
knowledge 25
which 25
has 25
its 25
sources 25
in 25
experience 25
we 25
are 25
wont 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
may 25
be 25
known 25
a 25
priori 25
because 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
derive 25
this 25
knowledge 25
immediately 25
from 25
experience 25
but 25
from 25
a 25
general 25
rule 25
which 25
however 25
we 25
have 25
itself 25
borrowed 25
from 25
experience 25
thus 25
if 25
a 25
man 25
undermined 25
his 25
house 25
we 25
say 25
he 25
might 25
know 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
it 25
would 25
have 25
fallen 25
that 25
is 25
he 25
needed 25
not 25
to 25
have 25
waited 25
for 25
the 25
experience 25
that 25
it 25
did 25
actually 25
fall 25
but 25
still 25
a 25
priori 25
he 25
could 25
not 25
know 25
even 25
this 25
much 25
for 25
that 25
bodies 25
are 25
heavy 25
and 25
consequently 25
that 25
they 25
fall 25
when 25
their 25
supports 25
are 25
taken 25
away 25
must 25
have 25
been 25
known 25
to 25
him 25
previously 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
experience 25
by 25
the 25
term 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
therefore 25
we 25
shall 25
in 25
the 25
sequel 25
understand 25
not 25
such 25
as 25
is 25
independent 25
of 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
kind 25
of 25
experience 25
but 25
such 25
as 25
is 25
absolutely 25
so 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
opposed 25
to 25
this 25
is 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
or 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
a 25
posteriori 25
that 25
is 25
through 25
experience 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
is 25
either 25
pure 25
or 25
impure 25
pure 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
is 25
that 25
with 25
which 25
no 25
empirical 25
element 25
is 25
mixed 25
up 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
proposition 25
every 25
change 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
is 25
a 25
proposition 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
impure 25
because 25
change 25
is 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
derived 25
from 25
experience 25
ii 25
the 25
human 25
intellect 25
even 25
in 25
an 25
unphilosophical 25
state 25
is 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
certain 25
cognitions 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
question 25
now 25
is 25
as 25
to 25
a 25
criterion 25
by 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
securely 25
distinguish 25
a 25
pure 25
from 25
an 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
experience 25
no 25
doubt 25
teaches 25
us 25
that 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
object 25
is 25
constituted 25
in 25
such 25
and 25
such 25
a 25
manner 25
but 25
not 25
that 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
possibly 25
exist 25
otherwise 25
now 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
if 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
proposition 25
which 25
contains 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
necessity 25
in 25
its 25
very 25
conception 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
if 25
moreover 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
derived 25
from 25
any 25
other 25
proposition 25
unless 25
from 25
one 25
equally 25
involving 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
necessity 25
it 25
is 25
absolutely 25
priori 25
secondly 25
an 25
empirical 25
judgement 25
never 25
exhibits 25
strict 25
and 25
absolute 25
but 25
only 25
assumed 25
and 25
comparative 25
universality 25
by 25
induction 25
therefore 25
the 25
most 25
we 25
can 25
say 25
isso 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
hitherto 25
observed 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
exception 25
to 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
rule 25
if 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
a 25
judgement 25
carries 25
with 25
it 25
strict 25
and 25
absolute 25
universality 25
that 25
is 25
admits 25
of 25
no 25
possible 25
exception 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
derived 25
from 25
experience 25
but 25
is 25
valid 25
absolutely 25
a 25
priori 25
empirical 25
universality 25
is 25
therefore 25
only 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
extension 25
of 25
validity 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
predicated 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
valid 25
in 25
most 25
cases 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
asserted 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
which 25
holds 25
good 25
in 25
all 25
as 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
the 25
affirmation 25
all 25
bodies 25
are 25
heavy 25
when 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
strict 25
universality 25
characterizes 25
a 25
judgement 25
it 25
necessarily 25
indicates 25
another 25
peculiar 25
source 25
of 25
knowledge 25
namely 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
necessity 25
and 25
strict 25
universality 25
therefore 25
are 25
infallible 25
tests 25
for 25
distinguishing 25
pure 25
from 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
and 25
are 25
inseparably 25
connected 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
but 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
these 25
criteria 25
the 25
empirical 25
limitation 25
is 25
sometimes 25
more 25
easily 25
detected 25
than 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
or 25
the 25
unlimited 25
universality 25
which 25
we 25
attach 25
to 25
a 25
judgement 25
is 25
often 25
a 25
more 25
convincing 25
proof 25
than 25
its 25
necessity 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
advisable 25
to 25
use 25
the 25
criteria 25
separately 25
each 25
being 25
by 25
itself 25
infallible 25
now 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
human 25
cognition 25
we 25
have 25
judgements 25
which 25
are 25
necessary 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
strictest 25
sense 25
universal 25
consequently 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
an 25
easy 25
matter 25
to 25
show 25
if 25
we 25
desire 25
an 25
example 25
from 25
the 25
sciences 25
we 25
need 25
only 25
take 25
any 25
proposition 25
in 25
mathematics 25
if 25
we 25
cast 25
our 25
eyes 25
upon 25
the 25
commonest 25
operations 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
proposition 25
every 25
change 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
cause 25
will 25
amply 25
serve 25
our 25
purpose 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
case 25
indeed 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
so 25
plainly 25
involves 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
necessity 25
of 25
connection 25
with 25
an 25
effect 25
and 25
of 25
a 25
strict 25
universality 25
of 25
the 25
law 25
that 25
the 25
very 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
would 25
entirely 25
disappear 25
were 25
we 25
to 25
derive 25
it 25
like 25
hume 25
from 25
a 25
frequent 25
association 25
of 25
what 25
happens 25
with 25
that 25
which 25
precedes 25
and 25
the 25
habit 25
thence 25
originating 25
of 25
connecting 25
representationsthe 25
necessity 25
inherent 25
in 25
the 25
judgement 25
being 25
therefore 25
merely 25
subjective 25
besides 25
without 25
seeking 25
for 25
such 25
examples 25
of 25
principles 25
existing 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
cognition 25
we 25
might 25
easily 25
show 25
that 25
such 25

are 25
the 25
indispensable 25
basis 25
of 25
the 25

itself 25

consequently 25
prove 25
their 25
existence 25
a 25
priori 25
for 25
whence 25
could 25
our 25
experience 25
itself 25
acquire 25
certainty 25
if 25
all 25
the 25
rules 25
on 25
which 25
it 25
depends 25
were 25
themselves 25
empirical 25
and 25
consequently 25
fortuitous 25
no 25
one 25
therefore 25
can 25
admit 25
the 25

of 25
the 25

of 25
such 25

but 25
for 25
the 25
present 25
we 25
may 25
content 25
ourselves 25
with 25
having 25
established 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
we 25
do 25
possess 25
and 25
exercise 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25

secondly 25
with 25
having 25
pointed 25
out 25
the 25
proper 25
tests 25
of 25
such 25
cognition 25
namely 25
universality 25
and 25
necessity 25
not 25
only 25
in 25
judgements 25
however 25
but 25
even 25
in 25
conceptions 25
is 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
origin 25
manifest 25
for 25
example 25
if 25
we 25
take 25
away 25
by 25
degrees 25
from 25
our 25

the 25

it 25
occupied 25
still 25
remains 25

this 25

is 25
utterly 25
impossible 25
to 25
annihilate 25
in 25
thought 25
again 25
if 25
we 25
take 25
away 25
in 25

itself 25
upon 25
us 25
we 25

affords 25
us 25
neither 25

on 25
account 25
of 25
their 25
importance 25
we 25
consider 25
far 25
preferable 25
to 25
and 25
as 25
having 25
a 25
far 25
more 25
elevated 25
aim 25
than 25
all 25
that 25

so 25
high 25

we 25
set 25
upon 25

investigations 25
that 25
even 25
at 25
the 25
risk 25
of 25

we 25
persist 25

out 25
and 25
permit 25
neither 25
doubt 25
nor 25

nor 25
indifference 25
to 25
restrain 25
us 25
from 25
the 25

with 25
all 25

for 25
its 25
especial 25
object 25

is 25
at 25
the 25
very 25
outset 25
dogmatical 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
confidently 25
takes 25
upon 25
itself 25
the 25
execution 25
of 25

now 25
the 25
safe 25
ground 25
of 25
experience 25
being 25
thus 25
abandoned 25
it 25
seems 25
nevertheless 25
natural 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
hesitate 25
to 25
erect 25
a 25
building 25
with 25
the 25
cognitions 25
we 25
possess 25
without 25
knowing 25
whence 25
they 25
come 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
strength 25
of 25
principles 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
undiscovered 25
instead 25
of 25
thus 25
trying 25
to 25
build 25
without 25
a 25
foundation 25
it 25
is 25
rather 25
to 25
be 25
expected 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
long 25
ago 25
have 25
put 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
the 25
understanding 25
can 25
arrive 25
at 25
these 25
a 25
priori 25
cognitions 25
and 25
what 25
is 25
the 25
extent 25
validity 25
and 25
worth 25
which 25
they 25
may 25
possess 25
we 25
say 25
this 25
is 25
natural 25
enough 25
meaning 25
by 25
the 25
word 25
natural 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
consistent 25
with 25
a 25
just 25
and 25
reasonable 25
way 25
of 25
thinking 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
understand 25
by 25
the 25
term 25
that 25
which 25
usually 25
happens 25
nothing 25
indeed 25
could 25
be 25
more 25
natural 25
and 25
more 25
comprehensible 25
than 25
that 25
this 25
investigation 25
should 25
be 25
left 25
long 25
unattempted 25
for 25
one 25
part 25
of 25
our 25
pure 25
knowledge 25
the 25
science 25
of 25
mathematics 25
has 25
been 25
long 25
firmly 25
established 25
and 25
thus 25
leads 25
us 25
to 25
form 25
flattering 25
expectations 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
others 25
though 25
these 25
may 25
be 25
of 25
quite 25
a 25
different 25
nature 25
besides 25
when 25
we 25
get 25
beyond 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
experience 25
we 25
are 25
of 25
course 25
safe 25
from 25
opposition 25
in 25
that 25
quarter 25
and 25
the 25
charm 25
of 25
widening 25
the 25
range 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
is 25
so 25
great 25
that 25
unless 25
we 25
are 25
brought 25
to 25
a 25
standstill 25
by 25
some 25
evident 25
contradiction 25
we 25
hurry 25
on 25
undoubtingly 25
in 25
our 25
course 25
this 25
however 25
may 25
be 25
avoided 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
sufficiently 25
cautious 25
in 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
our 25
fictions 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
the 25
less 25
fictions 25
on 25
that 25
account 25
mathematical 25
science 25
affords 25
us 25
a 25
brilliant 25
example 25
how 25
far 25
independently 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
we 25
may 25
carry 25
our 25
a 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
that 25
the 25
mathematician 25
occupies 25
himself 25
with 25
objects 25
and 25
cognitions 25
only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
can 25
be 25
represented 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
intuition 25
but 25
this 25
circumstance 25
is 25
easily 25
overlooked 25
because 25
the 25
said 25
intuition 25
can 25
itself 25
be 25
given 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
therefore 25
is 25
hardly 25
to 25
be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
a 25
mere 25
pure 25
conception 25
deceived 25
by 25
such 25
a 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
can 25
perceive 25
no 25
limits 25
to 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
the 25
light 25
dove 25
cleaving 25
in 25
free 25
flight 25
the 25
thin 25
air 25
whose 25
resistance 25
it 25
feels 25
might 25
imagine 25
that 25
her 25
movements 25
would 25
be 25
far 25
more 25
free 25
and 25
rapid 25
in 25
airless 25
space 25
just 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
way 25
did 25
plato 25
abandoning 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
because 25
of 25
the 25
narrow 25
limits 25
it 25
sets 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
venture 25
upon 25
the 25
wings 25
of 25
ideas 25
beyond 25
it 25
into 25
the 25
void 25
space 25
of 25
pure 25
intellect 25
he 25
did 25
not 25
reflect 25
that 25
he 25
made 25
no 25
real 25
progress 25
by 25
all 25
his 25
efforts 25
for 25
he 25
met 25
with 25
no 25
resistance 25
which 25
might 25
serve 25
him 25
for 25
a 25
support 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
whereon 25
to 25
rest 25
and 25
on 25
which 25
he 25
might 25
apply 25
his 25
powers 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
let 25
the 25
intellect 25
acquire 25
momentum 25
for 25
its 25
progress 25
it 25
is 25
indeed 25
the 25
common 25
fate 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
in 25
speculation 25
to 25
finish 25
the 25
imposing 25
edifice 25
of 25
thought 25
as 25
rapidly 25
as 25
possible 25
and 25
then 25
for 25
the 25
first 25
time 25
to 25
begin 25
to 25
examine 25
whether 25
the 25
foundation 25
is 25
a 25
solid 25
one 25
or 25
no 25
arrived 25
at 25
this 25
point 25
all 25
sorts 25
of 25
excuses 25
are 25
sought 25
after 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
console 25
us 25
for 25
its 25
want 25
of 25
stability 25
or 25
rather 25
indeed 25
to 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
dispense 25
altogether 25
with 25
so 25
late 25
and 25
dangerous 25
an 25
investigation 25
but 25
what 25
frees 25
us 25
during 25
the 25
process 25
of 25
building 25
from 25
all 25
apprehension 25
or 25
suspicion 25
and 25
flatters 25
us 25
into 25
the 25
belief 25
of 25
its 25
solidity 25
is 25
this 25
a 25
great 25
part 25
perhaps 25
the 25
greatest 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
business 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25
consists 25
in 25
the 25
analysation 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
which 25
we 25
already 25
possess 25
of 25
objects 25
by 25
this 25
means 25
we 25
gain 25
a 25
multitude 25
of 25
cognitions 25
which 25
although 25
really 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
elucidations 25
or 25
explanations 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
though 25
in 25
a 25
confused 25
manner 25
was 25
already 25
thought 25
in 25
our 25
conceptions 25
are 25
at 25
least 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
their 25
form 25
prized 25
as 25
new 25
introspections 25
whilst 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
regards 25
their 25
matter 25
or 25
content 25
we 25
have 25
really 25
made 25
no 25
addition 25
to 25
our 25
conceptions 25
but 25
only 25
disinvolved 25
them 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
process 25
does 25
furnish 25
a 25
real 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
which 25

a 25
sure 25
progress 25
and 25
useful 25
results 25
reason 25
deceived 25
by 25
this 25
slips 25
in 25
without 25
being 25
itself 25
aware 25
of 25
it 25
assertions 25
of 25
a 25
quite 25
different 25
kind 25
in 25
which 25
to 25
given 25
conceptions 25
it 25
adds 25
others 25
a 25
priori 25
indeed 25
but 25
entirely 25
foreign 25
to 25
them 25
without 25
our 25
knowing 25
how 25
it 25
arrives 25
at 25
these 25
and 25
indeed 25
without 25
such 25
a 25
question 25
ever 25
suggesting 25
itself 25
i 25
shall 25
therefore 25
at 25
once 25
proceed 25
to 25
examine 25
the 25
difference 25
between 25
these 25
two 25
modes 25
of 25
knowledge 25
iv 25
of 25
the 25
difference 25
between 25
analytical 25
and 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
in 25
all 25
judgements 25
wherein 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
a 25
subject 25
to 25
the 25
predicate 25
is 25
cogitated 25
i 25
mention 25
affirmative 25
judgements 25
only 25
here 25
the 25
application 25
to 25
negative 25
will 25
be 25
very 25
easy 25
this 25
relation 25
is 25
possible 25
in 25
two 25
different 25
ways 25
either 25
the 25
predicate 25
b 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
a 25
as 25
somewhat 25
which 25
is 25
contained 25
though 25
covertly 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
a 25
or 25
the 25
predicate 25
b 25
lies 25
completely 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
a 25
although 25
it 25
stands 25
in 25
connection 25
with 25
it 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
instance 25
i 25
term 25
the 25
judgement 25
analytical 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
synthetical 25
analytical 25
judgements 25
affirmative 25
are 25
therefore 25
those 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25
predicate 25
with 25
the 25
subject 25
is 25
cogitated 25
through 25
identity 25
those 25
in 25
which 25
this 25
connection 25
is 25
cogitated 25
without 25
identity 25
are 25
called 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
the 25
former 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
explicative 25
the 25
latter 25
augmentative 25
judgements 25
because 25
the 25
former 25
add 25
in 25
the 25
predicate 25
nothing 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
but 25
only 25
analyse 25
it 25
into 25
its 25
constituent 25
conceptions 25
which 25
were 25
thought 25
already 25
in 25
the 25
subject 25
although 25
in 25
a 25
confused 25
manner 25
the 25
latter 25
add 25
to 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
a 25
predicate 25
which 25
was 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
it 25
and 25
which 25
no 25
analysis 25
could 25
ever 25
have 25
discovered 25
therein 25
for 25
example 25
when 25
i 25
say 25
all 25
bodies 25
are 25
extended 25
this 25
is 25
an 25
analytical 25
judgement 25
for 25
i 25
need 25
not 25
go 25
beyond 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
find 25
extension 25
connected 25
with 25
it 25
but 25
merely 25
analyse 25
the 25
conception 25
that 25
is 25
become 25
conscious 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
properties 25
which 25
i 25
think 25
in 25
that 25
conception 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
discover 25
this 25
predicate 25
in 25
it 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
an 25
analytical 25
judgement 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
when 25
i 25
say 25
all 25
bodies 25
are 25
heavy 25
the 25
predicate 25
is 25
something 25
totally 25
different 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
i 25
think 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
by 25
the 25
addition 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
predicate 25
therefore 25
it 25
becomes 25
a 25
synthetical 25
judgement 25
judgements 25
of 25
experience 25
as 25
such 25
are 25
always 25
synthetical 25
for 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
absurd 25
to 25
think 25
of 25
grounding 25
an 25
analytical 25
judgement 25
on 25
experience 25
because 25
in 25
forming 25
such 25
a 25
judgement 25
i 25
need 25
not 25
go 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
my 25
conceptions 25
and 25
therefore 25
recourse 25
to 25
the 25
testimony 25
of 25
experience 25
is 25
quite 25
unnecessary 25
that 25
bodies 25
are 25
extended 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
empirical 25
judgement 25
but 25
a 25
proposition 25
which 25
stands 25
firm 25
a 25
priori 25
for 25
before 25
addressing 25
myself 25
to 25
experience 25
i 25
already 25
have 25
in 25
my 25
conception 25
all 25
the 25
requisite 25
conditions 25
for 25
the 25
judgement 25
and 25
i 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
extract 25
the 25
predicate 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
and 25
thereby 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
become 25
conscious 25
of 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
a 25
necessity 25
which 25
i 25
could 25
never 25
learn 25
from 25
experience 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
though 25
at 25
first 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
at 25
all 25
include 25
the 25
predicate 25
of 25
weight 25
in 25
my 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
in 25
general 25
that 25
conception 25
still 25
indicates 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
totality 25
of 25
experience 25
to 25
which 25
i 25
can 25
still 25
add 25
other 25
parts 25
and 25
this 25
i 25
do 25
when 25
i 25
recognize 25
by 25
observation 25
that 25
bodies 25
are 25
heavy 25
i 25
can 25
cognize 25
beforehand 25
by 25
analysis 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
through 25
the 25
characteristics 25
of 25
extension 25
impenetrability 25
shape 25
etc 25
all 25
which 25
are 25
cogitated 25
in 25
this 25
conception 25
but 25
now 25
i 25
extend 25
my 25
knowledge 25
and 25
looking 25
back 25
on 25
experience 25
from 25
which 25
i 25
had 25
derived 25
this 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
i 25
find 25
weight 25
at 25
all 25
times 25
connected 25
with 25
the 25
above 25
characteristics 25
and 25
therefore 25
i 25
synthetically 25
add 25
to 25
my 25
conceptions 25
this 25
as 25
a 25
predicate 25
and 25
say 25
all 25
bodies 25
are 25
heavy 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
experience 25
upon 25
which 25
rests 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
predicate 25
of 25
weight 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
because 25
both 25
conceptions 25
although 25
the 25
one 25
is 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
still 25
belong 25
to 25
one 25
another 25
only 25
contingently 25
however 25
as 25
parts 25
of 25
a 25
whole 25
namely 25
of 25
experience 25
which 25
is 25
itself 25
a 25
synthesis 25
of 25
intuitions 25
but 25
to 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
a 25
priori 25
such 25
aid 25
is 25
entirely 25
wanting 25
if 25
i 25
go 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
conception 25
a 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
recognize 25
another 25
b 25
as 25
connected 25
with 25
it 25
what 25
foundation 25
have 25
i 25
to 25
rest 25
on 25
whereby 25
to 25
render 25
the 25
synthesis 25
possible 25
i 25
have 25
here 25
no 25
longer 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
looking 25
out 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
what 25
i 25
want 25
let 25
us 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
proposition 25
everything 25
that 25
happens 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
something 25
that 25
happens 25
i 25
indeed 25
think 25
an 25
existence 25
which 25
a 25
certain 25
time 25
antecedes 25
and 25
from 25
this 25
i 25
can 25
derive 25
analytical 25
judgements 25
but 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
lies 25
quite 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
above 25
conception 25
and 25
indicates 25
something 25
entirely 25
different 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
happens 25
and 25
is 25
consequently 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
that 25
conception 25
how 25
then 25
am 25
i 25
able 25
to 25
assert 25
concerning 25
the 25
general 25
conceptionthat 25
which 25
happenssomething 25
entirely 25
different 25
from 25

recognize 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
although 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
it 25
yet 25
as 25
belonging 25
to 25
it 25
and 25
even 25
necessarily 25
what 25
is 25
here 25
the 25
unknown 25
x 25
upon 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
rests 25
when 25
it 25
believes 25
it 25
has 25
found 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
a 25
a 25
foreign 25
predicate 25

it 25
nevertheless 25
considers 25
to 25
be 25
connected 25
with 25
it 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
experience 25
because 25
the 25
principle 25
adduced 25
annexes 25
the 25
two 25
representations 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
to 25
the 25
representation 25

only 25

universality 25

also 25

speculative 25

analytical 25
judgements 25
are 25
indeed 25
highly 25
important 25
and 25
necessary 25
they 25
are 25
so 25
only 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
that 25
clearness 25

conceptions 25

is 25
requisite 25
for 25
a 25
sure 25
and 25
extended 25
synthesis 25
and 25
this 25
alone 25
is 25
a 25
real 25
acquisition 25

all 25
theoretical 25
sciences 25
of 25

synthetical 25
judgements 25

principles 25
mathematical 25
judgements 25
are 25
always 25
synthetical 25
hitherto 25
this 25
fact 25
though 25
incontestably 25
true 25
and 25
very 25
important 25
in 25
its 25
consequences 25
seems 25
to 25
have 25
escaped 25
the 25
analysts 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
nay 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
complete 25
opposition 25
to 25
all 25
their 25
conjectures 25
for 25
as 25
it 25
was 25
found 25
that 25
mathematical 25
conclusions 25
all 25
proceed 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
which 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
every 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
requires 25
people 25
became 25
persuaded 25
that 25
the 25
fundamental 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
also 25
were 25
recognized 25
and 25
admitted 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
way 25
but 25
the 25
notion 25
is 25
fallacious 25
for 25
although 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
can 25
certainly 25
be 25
discerned 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
this 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
when 25
another 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
precedes 25
from 25
which 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
deduced 25
but 25
never 25
of 25
itself 25
before 25
all 25
be 25
it 25
observed 25
that 25
proper 25
mathematical 25
propositions 25
are 25
always 25
judgements 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
not 25
empirical 25
because 25
they 25
carry 25
along 25
with 25
them 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
necessity 25

cannot 25

demurred 25
to 25
it 25
matters 25
not 25
i 25
will 25
then 25
limit 25
my 25
assertion 25
to 25
pure 25
mathematics 25
the 25
very 25
conception 25
of 25
which 25
implies 25
that 25
it 25
consists 25
of 25
knowledge 25
altogether 25
nonempirical 25
and 25
a 25
priori 25
we 25
might 25
indeed 25
at 25
first 25
suppose 25
that 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
a 25
merely 25
analytical 25
proposition 25
following 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
sum 25
of 25
seven 25
and 25
five 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
regard 25
it 25
more 25
narrowly 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
seven 25
and 25
five 25
contains 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
uniting 25
of 25
both 25
sums 25
into 25
one 25
whereby 25
it 25
cannot 25
at 25
all 25
be 25
cogitated 25
what 25
this 25
single 25
number 25
is 25
which 25
embraces 25
both 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
twelve 25
is 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
obtained 25
by 25
merely 25
cogitating 25
the 25
union 25
of 25
seven 25
and 25
five 25
and 25
we 25
may 25
analyse 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
possible 25
sum 25
as 25
long 25
as 25
we 25
will 25
still 25
we 25
shall 25
never 25
discover 25
in 25
it 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
twelve 25
we 25
must 25
go 25
beyond 25
these 25
conceptions 25
and 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
an 25
intuition 25
which 25
corresponds 25
to 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
twoour 25
five 25
fingers 25
for 25
example 25
or 25
like 25
segner 25
in 25
his 25
arithmetic 25
five 25
points 25
and 25
so 25
by 25
degrees 25
add 25
the 25
units 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
five 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
intuition 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
seven 25
for 25
i 25
first 25
take 25
the 25
number 25
and 25
for 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
calling 25
in 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
the 25
fingers 25
of 25
my 25
hand 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
intuition 25
i 25
add 25
the 25
units 25
which 25
i 25
before 25
took 25
together 25
to 25
make 25
up 25
the 25
number 25
gradually 25
now 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
material 25
image 25
my 25
hand 25
to 25
the 25
number 25
and 25
by 25
this 25
process 25
i 25
at 25
length 25
see 25
the 25
number 25
arise 25
that 25
should 25
be 25
added 25
to 25
i 25
have 25
certainly 25
cogitated 25
in 25
my 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
sum 25
but 25
not 25
that 25
this 25
sum 25
was 25
equal 25
to 25
arithmetical 25
propositions 25
are 25
therefore 25
always 25
synthetical 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
become 25
more 25
clearly 25
convinced 25
by 25
trying 25
large 25
numbers 25
for 25
it 25
will 25
thus 25
become 25
quite 25
evident 25
that 25
turn 25
and 25
twist 25
our 25
conceptions 25
as 25
we 25
may 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
without 25
having 25
recourse 25
to 25
intuition 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
the 25
sum 25
total 25
or 25
product 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
mere 25
analysis 25
of 25
our 25
conceptions 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
is 25
any 25
principle 25
of 25
pure 25
geometry 25
analytical 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
between 25
two 25
points 25
is 25
the 25
shortest 25
is 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
for 25
my 25
conception 25
of 25
straight 25
contains 25
no 25
notion 25
of 25
quantity 25
but 25
is 25
merely 25
qualitative 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
shortest 25
is 25
therefore 25
fore 25
wholly 25
an 25
addition 25
and 25
by 25
no 25
analysis 25
can 25
it 25
be 25
extracted 25
from 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
intuition 25
must 25
therefore 25
here 25
lend 25
its 25
aid 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
and 25
thus 25
only 25
our 25
synthesis 25
is 25
possible 25
some 25
few 25
principles 25
preposited 25
by 25
geometricians 25
are 25
indeed 25
really 25
analytical 25
and 25
depend 25
on 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
they 25
serve 25
however 25
like 25
identical 25
propositions 25
as 25
links 25
in 25
the 25
chain 25
of 25
method 25
not 25
as 25
principlesfor 25
example 25
a 25
a 25
the 25
whole 25
is 25
equal 25
to 25
itself 25
or 25
ab 25
a 25
the 25
whole 25
is 25
greater 25
than 25
its 25
part 25
and 25
yet 25
even 25
these 25
principles 25
themselves 25
though 25
they 25
derive 25
their 25
validity 25
from 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
are 25
only 25
admitted 25
in 25
mathematics 25
because 25
they 25
can 25
be 25
presented 25
in 25
intuition 25
what 25
causes 25
us 25
here 25
commonly 25
to 25
believe 25
that 25
the 25
predicate 25
of 25
such 25
apodeictic 25
judgements 25
is 25
already 25
contained 25
in 25
our 25
conception 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
judgement 25
is 25
therefore 25
analytical 25
is 25
merely 25
the 25
equivocal 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
expression 25
we 25
must 25
join 25
in 25
thought 25
a 25
certain 25
predicate 25
to 25
a 25
given 25
conception 25
and 25
this 25
necessity 25
cleaves 25
already 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
not 25
what 25
we 25
must 25
join 25
in 25
thought 25
to 25
the 25
given 25
conception 25
but 25
what 25
we 25
really 25
think 25
therein 25
though 25
only 25
obscurely 25
and 25
then 25
it 25
becomes 25
manifest 25
that 25
the 25
predicate 25
pertains 25
to 25
these 25
conceptions 25
necessarily 25
indeed 25
yet 25
not 25
as 25
thought 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
itself 25
but 25
by 25
virtue 25
of 25
an 25
intuition 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
added 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
the 25
science 25
of 25
natural 25
philosophy 25
physics 25
contains 25
in 25
itself 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
a 25
priori 25
as 25
principles 25
i 25
shall 25
adduce 25
two 25
propositions 25
for 25
instance 25
the 25
proposition 25
in 25
all 25
changes 25
of 25
the 25
material 25
world 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
matter 25
remains 25
unchanged 25
or 25
that 25
in 25
all 25
communication 25
of 25
motion 25
action 25
and 25
reaction 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
equal 25
in 25
both 25
of 25
these 25
not 25
only 25
is 25
the 25
necessity 25
and 25
therefore 25
their 25
origin 25
a 25
priori 25
clear 25
but 25
also 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
for 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
matter 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
cogitate 25
its 25
permanency 25
but 25
merely 25
its 25
presence 25
in 25
space 25
which 25
it 25
fills 25
i 25
therefore 25
really 25
go 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
matter 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
think 25
on 25
to 25
it 25
something 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
i 25
did 25
not 25
think 25
in 25
it 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
therefore 25
not 25
analytical 25
but 25
synthetical 25
and 25
nevertheless 25
conceived 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
so 25
it 25
is 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
propositions 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
part 25
of 25
natural 25
philosophy 25
as 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
even 25
if 25
we 25
look 25
upon 25
it 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25
attempted 25
science 25
yet 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
an 25
indispensable 25
one 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
it 25
must 25
contain 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
a 25
priori 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
merely 25
the 25
duty 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
to 25
dissect 25
and 25
thereby 25
analytically 25
to 25
illustrate 25
the 25
conceptions 25
which 25
we 25
form 25
a 25
priori 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
we 25
seek 25
to 25
widen 25
the 25
range 25
of 25
our 25
a 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
we 25
must 25
avail 25
ourselves 25
of 25
such 25
principles 25
as 25
add 25
something 25
to 25
the 25
original 25
conceptionsomething 25
not 25
identical 25
with 25
nor 25
contained 25

it 25

by 25
means 25
of 25
synthetical 25

far 25
behind 25
us 25
the 25
limits 25

a 25

perhaps 25
many 25
may 25
still 25
express 25
doubts 25
but 25
we 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
look 25
at 25
the 25
different 25
propositions 25

are 25
commonly 25

convinced 25
that 25

form 25
a 25
science 25
of 25
pure 25
physics 25
physica 25
pura 25
or 25
rationalis 25
which 25
well 25
deserves 25
to 25
be 25
separately 25
exposed 25
as 25
a 25
special 25
science 25
in 25
its 25
whole 25
extent 25
whether 25
that 25

great 25
or 25
confined 25
yet 25
in 25
a 25
certain 25
sense 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
knowledge 25
must 25
unquestionably 25
be 25
looked 25
upon 25
as 25
given 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
metaphysics 25
must 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
really 25
existing 25
if 25
not 25
as 25
a 25
science 25
nevertheless 25
as 25
a 25
natural 25
disposition 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
metaphysica 25
naturalis 25
for 25
human 25
reason 25
without 25
any 25
instigations 25
imputable 25
to 25
the 25
mere 25
vanity 25
of 25
great 25
knowledge 25
unceasingly 25
progresses 25
urged 25
on 25
by 25
its 25
own 25
feeling 25
of 25
need 25
towards 25
such 25
questions 25
as 25
cannot 25
be 25
answered 25
by 25
any 25
empirical 25
application 25
of 25
reason 25
or 25
principles 25
derived 25
therefrom 25
and 25
so 25
there 25
has 25
ever 25
really 25
existed 25
in 25
every 25
man 25
some 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
it 25
will 25
always 25
exist 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
reason 25
awakes 25
to 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
its 25
power 25
of 25
speculation 25
and 25
now 25
the 25
question 25
arises 25
how 25
is 25
metaphysics 25
as 25
a 25
natural 25
disposition 25
possible 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
how 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
universal 25
human 25
reason 25
do 25
those 25
questions 25
arise 25
which 25
pure 25
reason 25
proposes 25
to 25
itself 25
and 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
impelled 25
by 25
its 25
own 25
feeling 25
of 25
need 25
to 25
answer 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
it 25
can 25
but 25
as 25
in 25
all 25
the 25
attempts 25
hitherto 25
made 25
to 25
answer 25
the 25
questions 25
which 25
reason 25
is 25
prompted 25
by 25
its 25
very 25
nature 25
to 25
propose 25
to 25
itself 25
for 25
example 25
whether 25
the 25
world 25
had 25
a 25
beginning 25
or 25
has 25
existed 25
from 25
eternity 25
it 25
has 25
always 25
met 25
with 25
unavoidable 25
contradictions 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
rest 25
satisfied 25
with 25
the 25
mere 25
natural 25
disposition 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
that 25
is 25
with 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
whence 25
indeed 25
some 25
sort 25
of 25
metaphysical 25
system 25
always 25
arises 25
but 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
possible 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
certainty 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
whether 25
we 25
know 25
or 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
the 25
things 25
of 25
which 25
metaphysics 25
treats 25
we 25
must 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
a 25
decision 25
on 25
the 25
subjects 25
of 25
its 25
questions 25
or 25
on 25
the 25
ability 25
or 25
inability 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
form 25
any 25
judgement 25
respecting 25
them 25
and 25
therefore 25
either 25
to 25
extend 25
with 25
confidence 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
our 25
pure 25
reason 25
or 25
to 25
set 25
strictly 25
defined 25
and 25
safe 25
limits 25
to 25
its 25
action 25
this 25
last 25
question 25
which 25
arises 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
above 25
universal 25
problem 25
would 25
properly 25
run 25
thus 25
how 25
is 25
metaphysics 25
possible 25
as 25
a 25
science 25
thus 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
reason 25
leads 25
at 25
last 25
naturally 25
and 25
necessarily 25
to 25
science 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
use 25
of 25
reason 25
without 25
criticism 25
leads 25
to 25
groundless 25
assertions 25
against 25
which 25
others 25
equally 25
specious 25
can 25
always 25
be 25
set 25
thus 25
ending 25
unavoidably 25
in 25
scepticism 25
besides 25
this 25
science 25
cannot 25
be 25
of 25
great 25
and 25
formidable 25
prolixity 25
because 25
it 25
has 25
not 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
objects 25
of 25
reason 25
the 25
variety 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
inexhaustible 25
but 25
merely 25
with 25
reason 25
herself 25
and 25
her 25
problems 25
problems 25
which 25
arise 25
out 25
of 25
her 25
own 25
bosom 25
and 25
are 25
not 25
proposed 25
to 25
her 25
by 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
outward 25
things 25
but 25
by 25
her 25
own 25
nature 25
and 25
when 25
once 25
reason 25
has 25
previously 25
become 25
able 25
completely 25
to 25
understand 25
her 25
own 25
power 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
objects 25
which 25
she 25
meets 25
with 25
in 25
experience 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
easy 25
to 25
determine 25
securely 25
the 25
extent 25
and 25
limits 25
of 25
her 25
attempted 25
application 25
to 25
objects 25
beyond 25
the 25
confines 25
of 25
experience 25
we 25
may 25
and 25
must 25
therefore 25
regard 25
the 25
attempts 25
hitherto 25
made 25
to 25
establish 25
metaphysical 25
science 25
dogmatically 25
as 25
nonexistent 25
for 25
what 25
of 25
analysis 25
that 25
is 25
mere 25
dissection 25
of 25
conceptions 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
one 25
or 25
other 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
aim 25
of 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
preparation 25
for 25
metaphysics 25
proper 25
which 25
has 25
for 25
its 25
object 25
the 25
extension 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
synthesis 25
of 25
our 25
a 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
mere 25
analysis 25
is 25
of 25
course 25
useless 25
because 25
it 25
only 25
shows 25
what 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
these 25
conceptions 25
but 25
not 25
how 25
we 25
arrive 25
a 25
priori 25
at 25
them 25
and 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
her 25
duty 25
to 25
show 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
be 25
able 25
afterwards 25
to 25
determine 25
their 25
valid 25
use 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
all 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
to 25
all 25
knowledge 25
in 25
general 25
but 25
little 25
selfdenial 25
indeed 25
is 25
needed 25
to 25
give 25
up 25
these 25
pretensions 25
seeing 25
the 25
undeniable 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
dogmatic 25
mode 25
of 25
procedure 25
inevitable 25
contradictions 25
of 25
reason 25
with 25
herself 25
have 25
long 25
since 25
ruined 25
the 25
reputation 25
of 25
every 25
system 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
that 25
has 25
appeared 25
up 25
to 25
this 25

the 25

extension 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
be 25
here 25
possible 25
or 25
if 25
so 25
in 25
what 25
cases 25
we 25
can 25
regard 25
a 25
science 25
of 25
the 25
mere 25
criticism 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
its 25
sources 25
and 25
limits 25
as 25
the 25
propaedeutic 25
to 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
such 25
a 25
science 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
called 25
a 25
doctrine 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
its 25
use 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
speculation 25
would 25
be 25
only 25
negative 25
not 25
to 25
enlarge 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
but 25
to 25
purify 25
our 25
reason 25
and 25
to 25
shield 25
it 25
against 25
errorwhich 25
alone 25
is 25
no 25
little 25
gain 25
i 25
apply 25
the 25
term 25
transcendental 25
to 25
all 25
knowledge 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
so 25
much 25
occupied 25
with 25
objects 25
as 25
with 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
of 25
these 25
objects 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
cognition 25
is 25
possible 25
a 25
priori 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
such 25
conceptions 25
would 25
be 25
called 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
but 25
this 25
again 25
is 25
still 25
beyond 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
our 25
present 25
essay 25
for 25
as 25
such 25
a 25
science 25
must 25
contain 25
a 25
complete 25
exposition 25
not 25
only 25
of 25
our 25
synthetical 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
of 25
our 25
analytical 25
a 25
priori 25
knowledge 25
it 25
is 25
of 25
too 25
wide 25
a 25
range 25
for 25
our 25
present 25
purpose 25
because 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
require 25
to 25
carry 25
our 25
analysis 25
any 25
farther 25
than 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
understand 25
in 25
their 25
full 25
extent 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
synthesis 25
a 25
priori 25
with 25
which 25
alone 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
do 25
this 25
investigation 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
properly 25
call 25
a 25
doctrine 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
transcendental 25
critique 25
because 25
it 25
aims 25
not 25
at 25
the 25
enlargement 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
correction 25
and 25
guidance 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
and 25
is 25
to 25
serve 25
as 25
a 25
touchstone 25
of 25
the 25
worth 25
or 25
worthlessness 25
of 25
all 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
is 25
the 25
sole 25
object 25
of 25
our 25
present 25
essay 25
such 25
a 25
critique 25
is 25
consequently 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
possible 25
a 25
preparation 25
for 25
an 25
organon 25
and 25
if 25
this 25
new 25
organon 25
should 25
be 25
found 25
to 25
fail 25
at 25
least 25
for 25
a 25
canon 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
complete 25
system 25
of 25
the 25
philosophy 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
whether 25
it 25
extend 25
or 25
limit 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
that 25
reason 25
might 25
one 25
day 25
be 25
set 25
forth 25
both 25
analytically 25
and 25
synthetically 25
for 25
that 25
this 25
is 25
possible 25
nay 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
system 25
is 25
not 25
of 25
so 25
great 25
extent 25
as 25
to 25
preclude 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
its 25
ever 25
being 25
completed 25
is 25
evident 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
here 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
outward 25
objects 25
which 25
is 25
infinite 25
but 25
solely 25
with 25
the 25
mind 25
which 25
judges 25
of 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
objects 25
and 25
again 25
with 25
the 25
mind 25
only 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
its 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
our 25
investigations 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
sought 25
without 25
but 25
altogether 25
within 25
ourselves 25
cannot 25
remain 25
concealed 25
and 25
in 25
all 25
probability 25
is 25
limited 25
enough 25
to 25
be 25
completely 25
surveyed 25
and 25
fairly 25
estimated 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
worth 25
or 25
worthlessness 25
still 25
less 25
let 25
the 25
reader 25
here 25
expect 25
a 25
critique 25
of 25
books 25
and 25
systems 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
our 25
present 25
object 25
is 25
exclusively 25
a 25
critique 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
itself 25
only 25
when 25
we 25
make 25
this 25
critique 25
our 25
foundation 25
do 25
we 25
possess 25
a 25
pure 25
touchstone 25
for 25
estimating 25
the 25
philosophical 25
value 25
of 25
ancient 25
and 25
modern 25
writings 25
on 25
this 25
subject 25
and 25
without 25
this 25
criterion 25
the 25
incompetent 25
historian 25
or 25
judge 25
decides 25
upon 25
and 25
corrects 25
the 25
groundless 25
assertions 25
of 25
others 25
with 25
his 25
own 25
which 25
have 25
themselves 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
foundation 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
is 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
for 25
which 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
must 25
sketch 25
the 25
whole 25
plan 25
architectonically 25
that 25
is 25
from 25
principles 25
with 25
a 25
full 25
guarantee 25
for 25
the 25
validity 25
and 25
stability 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
parts 25
which 25
enter 25
into 25
the 25
building 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
if 25
this 25
critique 25
itself 25
does 25
not 25
assume 25
the 25
title 25
of 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
because 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
complete 25
system 25
it 25
ought 25
to 25
contain 25
a 25
full 25
analysis 25
of 25
all 25
human 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
our 25
critique 25
must 25
indeed 25
lay 25
before 25
us 25
a 25
complete 25
enumeration 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
radical 25
conceptions 25
which 25
constitute 25
the 25
said 25
pure 25
knowledge 25
but 25
from 25
the 25
complete 25
analysis 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
themselves 25
as 25
also 25
from 25
a 25
complete 25
investigation 25
of 25
those 25
derived 25
from 25
them 25
it 25
abstains 25
with 25
reason 25
partly 25
because 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
deviating 25
from 25
the 25
end 25
in 25
view 25
to 25
occupy 25
itself 25
with 25
this 25
analysis 25
since 25
this 25
process 25
is 25
not 25
attended 25
with 25
the 25
difficulty 25
and 25
insecurity 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
synthesis 25
to 25
which 25
our 25
critique 25
is 25
entirely 25
devoted 25
and 25
partly 25
because 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
inconsistent 25
with 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
our 25
plan 25
to 25
burden 25
this 25
essay 25
with 25
the 25
vindication 25
of 25
the 25
completeness 25
of 25
such 25
an 25
analysis 25
and 25
deduction 25
with 25
which 25
after 25
all 25
we 25
have 25
at 25
present 25
nothing 25
to 25
do 25
this 25
completeness 25
of 25
the 25
analysis 25
of 25
these 25
radical 25
conceptions 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
of 25
the 25
deduction 25
from 25
the 25
conceptions 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
given 25
by 25
the 25
analysis 25
we 25
can 25
however 25
easily 25
attain 25
provided 25
only 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
all 25
these 25
radical 25
conceptions 25
which 25
are 25
to 25
serve 25
as 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
synthesis 25
and 25
that 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
this 25
main 25
purpose 25
nothing 25
is 25
wanting 25
to 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
therefore 25
belongs 25
all 25
that 25
constitutes 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
complete 25
idea 25
of 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
but 25
still 25
not 25
the 25
science 25
itself 25
because 25
it 25
only 25
proceeds 25
so 25
far 25
with 25
the 25
analysis 25
as 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
judging 25
completely 25
of 25
our 25
synthetical 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
principal 25
thing 25
we 25
must 25
attend 25
to 25
in 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
the 25
parts 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
like 25
this 25
is 25
that 25
no 25
conceptions 25
must 25
enter 25
it 25
which 25
contain 25
aught 25
empirical 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
that 25
the 25
knowledge 25
a 25
priori 25
must 25
be 25
completely 25
pure 25
hence 25
although 25
the 25
highest 25
principles 25
and 25
fundamental 25
conceptions 25
of 25
morality 25
are 25
certainly 25
cognitions 25
a 25
priori 25
yet 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
belong 25
to 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
because 25
though 25
they 25
certainly 25
do 25
not 25
lay 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
pain 25
pleasure 25
desires 25
inclinations 25
etc 25
which 25
are 25
all 25
of 25
empirical 25
origin 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
its 25
precepts 25
yet 25
still 25
into 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
dutyas 25
an 25
obstacle 25
to 25
be 25
overcome 25
or 25
as 25
an 25
incitement 25
which 25
should 25
not 25
be 25
made 25
into 25
a 25
motivethese 25
empirical 25
conceptions 25
must 25
necessarily 25
enter 25
in 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
pure 25
morality 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
is 25
consequently 25
a 25
philosophy 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
and 25
merely 25
speculative 25
reason 25
for 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
practical 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
contains 25
motives 25
relates 25
to 25
feelings 25
and 25
these 25
belong 25
to 25
empirical 25
sources 25
of 25
cognition 25
if 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
divide 25
this 25
science 25
from 25
the 25
universal 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
in 25
general 25
it 25
ought 25
to 25
comprehend 25
first 25
a 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
elements 25
and 25
secondly 25
a 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
method 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
each 25
of 25
these 25
main 25
divisions 25
will 25
have 25
its 25
subdivisions 25
the 25
separate 25
reasons 25
for 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
here 25
particularize 25
only 25
so 25
much 25
seems 25
necessary 25
by 25
way 25
of 25
introduction 25
of 25
premonition 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
two 25
sources 25
of 25
human 25
knowledge 25
which 25
probably 25
spring 25
from 25
a 25
common 25
but 25
to 25
us 25
unknown 25
root 25
namely 25
sense 25
and 25
understanding 25
by 25
the 25
former 25
objects 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
by 25
the 25
latter 25
thought 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
sense 25
may 25
contain 25
representations 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
form 25
the 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
objects 25
are 25
given 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
it 25
belongs 25
to 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
the 25
transcendental 25
doctrine 25
of 25
sense 25
must 25
form 25
the 25
first 25

these 25

each 25
other 25
but 25
also 25
in 25
separate 25
places 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
space 25
must 25
already 25
exist 25
as 25
a 25
foundation 25
consequently 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
space 25
cannot 25
be 25
borrowed 25
from 25
the 25
relations 25
of 25
external 25
phenomena 25
through 25
experience 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
this 25
external 25

is 25
itself 25
only 25
possible 25
through 25
the 25
said 25

space 25
then 25
is 25
a 25
necessary 25
representation 25
a 25

which 25
serves 25
for 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
all 25
external 25
intuitions 25
we 25
never 25
can 25
imagine 25
or 25
make 25
a 25
representation 25
to 25
ourselves 25
of 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
space 25
though 25
we 25
may 25
easily 25
enough 25
think 25
that 25
no 25
objects 25
are 25
found 25
in 25
it 25
it 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
as 25
a 25
determination 25
dependent 25
on 25
them 25
and 25
is 25
a 25
representation 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
necessarily 25
supplies 25
the 25
basis 25
for 25
external 25
phenomena 25
space 25
is 25
no 25
discursive 25
or 25
as 25
we 25
say 25
general 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
relations 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
a 25
pure 25
intuition 25
for 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
we 25
can 25
only 25
represent 25
to 25
ourselves 25
one 25
space 25
and 25
when 25
we 25
talk 25
of 25
divers 25
spaces 25
we 25
mean 25
only 25
parts 25
of 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
space 25
moreover 25
these 25
parts 25
cannot 25
antecede 25
this 25
one 25
allembracing 25
space 25
as 25
the 25
component 25
parts 25
from 25
which 25
the 25
aggregate 25
can 25
be 25
made 25
up 25
but 25
can 25
be 25
cogitated 25
only 25
as 25
existing 25
in 25
it 25
space 25
is 25
essentially 25
one 25
and 25
multiplicity 25
in 25
it 25
consequently 25
the 25
general 25
notion 25
of 25
spaces 25
of 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
space 25
depends 25
solely 25
upon 25
limitations 25
hence 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
intuition 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
empirical 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
root 25
of 25
all 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
space 25
thus 25
moreover 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
geometryfor 25
example 25
that 25
in 25
a 25
triangle 25
two 25
sides 25
together 25
are 25
greater 25
than 25
the 25
third 25
are 25
never 25
deduced 25
from 25
general 25
conceptions 25
of 25
line 25
and 25
triangle 25
but 25
from 25
intuition 25
and 25
this 25
a 25
priori 25
with 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
space 25
is 25
represented 25
as 25
an 25
infinite 25
given 25
quantity 25
now 25
every 25
conception 25
must 25
indeed 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
representation 25
which 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
an 25
infinite 25
multitude 25
of 25
different 25
possible 25
representations 25
which 25
therefore 25
comprises 25
these 25
under 25
itself 25
but 25
no 25
conception 25
as 25
such 25
can 25
be 25
so 25
conceived 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
contained 25
within 25
itself 25
an 25
infinite 25
multitude 25
of 25
representations 25
nevertheless 25
space 25
is 25
so 25
conceived 25
of 25
for 25
all 25
parts 25
of 25
space 25
are 25
equally 25
capable 25
of 25
being 25
produced 25
to 25
infinity 25
consequently 25
the 25
original 25
representation 25
of 25
space 25
is 25
an 25
intuition 25
a 25

firstly 25
that 25
such 25

do 25
really 25
flow 25
from 25
the 25
given 25
conception 25

secondly 25
that 25
the 25
said 25
cognitions 25
are 25
only 25
possible 25
under 25
the 25
presupposition 25

determines 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
space 25
synthetically 25
and 25
yet 25
a 25

then 25
must 25
be 25
our 25
representation 25

that 25
such 25
a 25
cognition 25

may 25
be 25
possible 25

must 25

conception 25
no 25
propositions 25

go 25
out 25
beyond 25

conception 25

yet 25
this 25
happens 25
in 25
geometry 25

but 25
this 25

be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25

united 25
with 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
their 25
necessity 25
as 25
space 25
has 25
only 25
three 25
dimensions 25

propositions 25

this 25

ii 25
now 25
how 25
can 25
an 25
external 25
intuition 25
anterior 25
to 25

themselves 25

in 25

obviously 25
not 25
otherwise 25

in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
has 25
its 25
seat 25
in 25
the 25

it 25

clear 25
that 25
we 25

as 25
they 25
are 25

so 25
we 25
may 25
correctly 25
say 25
that 25
space 25
contains 25
all 25
which 25
can 25
appear 25
to 25
us 25
externally 25

not 25
all 25
things 25
considered 25
as 25
things 25

themselves 25
be 25
they 25
intuited 25
or 25
not 25
or 25
by 25
whatsoever 25
subject 25
one 25
will 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
intuitions 25
of 25
other 25
thinking 25
beings 25
we 25
cannot 25
judge 25
whether 25
they 25
are 25
or 25
are 25
not 25
bound 25
by 25
the 25
same 25
conditions 25
which 25
limit 25
our 25
own 25
intuition 25
and 25
which 25
for 25
us 25
are 25
universally 25
valid 25
if 25
we 25
join 25
the 25
limitation 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
then 25
the 25
judgement 25
will 25
possess 25
unconditioned 25
validity 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
proposition 25
all 25
objects 25
are 25
beside 25
each 25
other 25
in 25
space 25
is 25
valid 25
only 25
under 25
the 25
limitation 25
that 25
these 25
things 25
are 25
taken 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
our 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
join 25
the 25
condition 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
and 25
say 25
all 25
things 25
as 25
external 25
phenomena 25
are 25
beside 25
each 25
other 25
in 25
space 25
then 25
the 25
rule 25
is 25
valid 25
universally 25
and 25
without 25
any 25
limitation 25
our 25
expositions 25
consequently 25
teach 25
the 25
reality 25
ie 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
space 25
in 25
regard 25
of 25
all 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
externally 25
as 25
object 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
also 25
the 25
ideality 25
of 25
space 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
objects 25
when 25
they 25
are 25
considered 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
reason 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
that 25
is 25
without 25
reference 25
to 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
our 25
sensibility 25
we 25
maintain 25
therefore 25
the 25
empirical 25
reality 25
of 25
space 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
all 25
possible 25
external 25
experience 25
although 25
we 25
must 25
admit 25
its 25
transcendental 25
ideality 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
nothing 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
we 25
withdraw 25
the 25
condition 25
upon 25
which 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
depends 25
and 25
look 25
upon 25
space 25
as 25
something 25
that 25
belongs 25
to 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
with 25
the 25
exception 25
of 25
space 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
representation 25
subjective 25
and 25
referring 25
to 25
something 25
external 25
to 25
us 25
which 25
could 25
be 25
called 25
objective 25
a 25
priori 25
for 25
there 25
are 25
no 25
other 25
subjective 25
representations 25
from 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
deduce 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
a 25
priori 25
as 25
we 25
can 25
from 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
space 25
see 25
ss 25
therefore 25
to 25
speak 25
accurately 25
no 25
ideality 25
whatever 25
belongs 25
to 25
these 25
although 25
they 25
agree 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
with 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
space 25
that 25
they 25
belong 25
merely 25
to 25
the 25
subjective 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
sensuous 25
perception 25
such 25
a 25
mode 25
for 25
example 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
sight 25
of 25
hearing 25
and 25
of 25
feeling 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
sensations 25
of 25
colour 25
sound 25
and 25
heat 25
but 25
which 25
because 25
they 25
are 25
only 25
sensations 25
and 25
not 25
intuitions 25
do 25
not 25
of 25
themselves 25
give 25
us 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
any 25

my 25
purpose 25
in 25
the 25
above 25
remark 25
is 25
merely 25
this 25
to 25
guard 25
any 25
one 25
against 25
illustrating 25
the 25
asserted 25
ideality 25
of 25

by 25
examples 25
quite 25
insufficient 25
for 25
example 25
by 25
colour 25

etc 25
for 25
these 25
must 25
be 25
contemplated 25
not 25
as 25
properties 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
only 25
as 25
changes 25
in 25

where 25
for 25
or 25
sake 25
of 25

i 25
have 25
placed 25
under 25
the 25
head 25
of 25

exposition 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
properly 25
transcendental 25
here 25
i 25
shall 25
add 25
that 25

with 25
it 25
the 25

possible 25
only 25
through 25

in 25

that 25
if 25
this 25

were 25
not 25
an 25
intuition 25
internal 25
a 25

no 25
conception 25
of 25
whatever 25

render 25
comprehensible 25
the 25

in 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25

for 25
example 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
a 25

in 25
a 25

only 25
in 25

that 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
meet 25
with 25
two 25
contradictorily 25
opposed 25
determinations 25
in 25
one 25
thing 25
that 25
is 25
after 25
each 25
other 25
thus 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25

explains 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
so 25
much 25
synthetical 25
knowledge 25
a 25

as 25
is 25
exhibited 25
in 25
the 25
general 25
doctrine 25
of 25
motion 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
little 25
fruitful 25
ss 25
conclusions 25
from 25
the 25
above 25
conceptions 25
a 25

is 25
not 25
something 25
which 25
subsists 25
of 25
itself 25
or 25
which 25
inheres 25
in 25
things 25
as 25
an 25
objective 25
determination 25
and 25
therefore 25
remains 25
when 25

is 25
made 25
of 25
the 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25

real 25
yet 25
without 25
presenting 25
to 25
any 25
power 25
of 25
perception 25
any 25
real 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
case 25
as 25
an 25
order 25
or 25
determination 25
inherent 25
in 25
things 25
themselves 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
antecedent 25
to 25
things 25

their 25

of 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
all 25
this 25
is 25
quite 25
possible 25
when 25
we 25
regard 25
time 25
as 25
merely 25
the 25
subjective 25
condition 25
under 25
which 25
all 25
our 25
intuitions 25
take 25
place 25
for 25
in 25
that 25
case 25
this 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
inward 25
intuition 25
can 25
be 25
represented 25
prior 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
and 25
consequently 25
a 25
priori 25
b 25
time 25
is 25
nothing 25
else 25
than 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
the 25
intuitions 25
of 25
self 25
and 25
of 25
our 25
internal 25
state 25
for 25
time 25
cannot 25
be 25
any 25
determination 25

it 25

to 25
do 25
neither 25
with 25
shape 25
nor 25
position 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
it 25
determines 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
representations 25
in 25
our 25
internal 25
state 25
and 25
precisely 25
because 25
this 25
internal 25
intuition 25
presents 25
to 25
us 25
no 25
shape 25
or 25
form 25
we 25
endeavour 25
to 25
supply 25
this 25
want 25
by 25
analogies 25
and 25
represent 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
time 25
by 25
a 25
line 25
progressing 25
to 25
infinity 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
which 25
constitutes 25
a 25
series 25
which 25
is 25
only 25
of 25
one 25
dimension 25
and 25
we 25
conclude 25
from 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
this 25
line 25
as 25
to 25
all 25
the 25

this 25
single 25
exception 25
that 25
the 25

coexistent 25
whilst 25
those 25
of 25

are 25
successive 25
from 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
clear 25
also 25
that 25
the 25

itself 25
an 25

because 25
all 25

we 25
add 25
the 25

the 25

it 25

this 25

this 25

in 25
such 25

we 25

in 25

elucidation 25
against 25

but 25
denies 25
to 25
it 25
absolute 25
and 25
transcendental 25
reality 25
i 25
have 25
heard 25
from 25
intelligent 25
men 25
an 25
objection 25
so 25
unanimously 25
urged 25
that 25
i 25
conclude 25
that 25
it 25
must 25
naturally 25
present 25
itself 25
to 25
every 25
reader 25
to 25
whom 25
these 25
considerations 25
are 25
novel 25
it 25
runs 25
thus 25
changes 25
are 25
real 25
this 25
the 25
continual 25
change 25
in 25
our 25
own 25
representations 25
demonstrates 25
even 25
though 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
all 25
external 25
phenomena 25
together 25
with 25
their 25
changes 25
is 25
denied 25
now 25
changes 25
are 25
only 25
possible 25
in 25
time 25
and 25
therefore 25
time 25
must 25
be 25
something 25
real 25
but 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
difficulty 25
in 25
answering 25
this 25
i 25
grant 25
the 25
whole 25
argument 25
time 25
no 25
doubt 25
is 25
something 25
real 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
real 25
form 25
of 25
our 25
internal 25
intuition 25
it 25
therefore 25
has 25
subjective 25
reality 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
our 25
internal 25
experience 25
that 25
is 25
i 25
have 25
really 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
of 25
my 25
determinations 25
therein 25
time 25
therefore 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
but 25
as 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
representation 25
of 25
myself 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
could 25
intuite 25
myself 25
or 25
be 25
intuited 25
by 25
another 25
being 25
without 25
this 25
condition 25
of 25
sensibility 25
then 25
those 25
very 25
determinations 25
which 25
we 25
now 25
represent 25
to 25
ourselves 25
as 25
changes 25
would 25
present 25
to 25
us 25
a 25
knowledge 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
consequently 25
of 25
change 25
would 25
not 25
appear 25
the 25
empirical 25
reality 25
of 25
time 25
therefore 25
remains 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
our 25
experience 25
but 25
absolute 25
reality 25
according 25
to 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
above 25
cannot 25
be 25
granted 25
it 25
time 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
our 25
internal 25
intuition 25
if 25
we 25
take 25
away 25
from 25
it 25
the 25
special 25
condition 25
of 25
our 25
sensibility 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
time 25
also 25
vanishes 25
and 25
it 25
inheres 25
not 25
in 25
the 25

themselves 25

everything 25

not 25
come 25

to 25
judge 25
of 25

merely 25
in 25
their 25

the 25

necessary 25
accordance 25
with 25
those 25
of 25
mathematics 25

our 25
theory 25

all 25

away 25

even 25
only 25
the 25
subjective 25
constitution 25

our 25
mode 25

can 25
we 25
cognize 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25

antecedent 25
to 25
all 25

such 25

of 25
very 25
diversified 25
character 25
supposing 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
carry 25
our 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
even 25
to 25
the 25
very 25
highest 25
degree 25
of 25
clearness 25
we 25
should 25
not 25
thereby 25
advance 25
one 25
step 25
nearer 25
to 25
a 25
knowledge 25
of 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
for 25
we 25
could 25
only 25
at 25
best 25
arrive 25
at 25
a 25
complete 25
cognition 25
of 25
our 25
own 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
our 25
sensibility 25
and 25
this 25
always 25
under 25
the 25
conditions 25
originally 25
attaching 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
namely 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
while 25
the 25
question 25
what 25
are 25
objects 25
considered 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
remains 25
unanswerable 25
even 25
after 25
the 25
most 25
thorough 25
examination 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
to 25
say 25
then 25
that 25
all 25
our 25
sensibility 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
confused 25
representation 25
of 25
things 25
containing 25
exclusively 25
that 25
which 25
belongs 25
to 25
them 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
this 25
under 25
an 25
accumulation 25
of 25
characteristic 25
marks 25
and 25
partial 25
representations 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
distinguish 25
in 25
consciousness 25
is 25
a 25
falsification 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
sensibility 25
and 25
phenomenization 25
which 25
renders 25
our 25
whole 25
doctrine 25
thereof 25
empty 25
and 25
useless 25
the 25
difference 25
between 25
a 25
confused 25
and 25
a 25
clear 25
representation 25
is 25
merely 25
logical 25
and 25
has 25
nothing 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
content 25
no 25
doubt 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
right 25
as 25
employed 25
by 25
a 25
sound 25
understanding 25
contains 25
all 25
that 25
the 25
most 25
subtle 25
investigation 25
could 25
unfold 25
from 25
it 25
although 25
in 25
the 25
ordinary 25
practical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
word 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
conscious 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
representations 25
comprised 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
assert 25
that 25
the 25
ordinary 25
conception 25
is 25
a 25
sensuous 25
one 25
containing 25
a 25
mere 25
phenomenon 25
for 25
right 25
cannot 25
appear 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
but 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
represents 25
a 25
property 25
the 25
moral 25
property 25
of 25
actions 25
which 25
belongs 25
to 25
them 25
in 25
themselves 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
representation 25
in 25
intuition 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
contains 25
nothing 25
which 25
could 25
belong 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
merely 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
or 25
appearance 25
of 25
something 25
and 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
affected 25
by 25
that 25
appearance 25
and 25
this 25
receptivity 25
of 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
is 25
called 25
sensibility 25
and 25
remains 25
toto 25
caelo 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
itself 25
even 25
though 25
we 25
should 25
examine 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
to 25
the 25
very 25
bottom 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
admitted 25
that 25
the 25
leibnitzwolfian 25
philosophy 25
has 25
assigned 25
an 25
entirely 25
erroneous 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
to 25
all 25
investigations 25
into 25
the 25
nature 25
and 25
origin 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
regards 25
the 25
distinction 25
between 25
the 25
sensuous 25
and 25
the 25
intellectual 25
as 25
merely 25
logical 25
whereas 25
it 25
is 25
plainly 25
transcendental 25
and 25
concerns 25
not 25
merely 25
the 25
clearness 25
or 25
obscurity 25
but 25
the 25
content 25
and 25
origin 25
of 25
both 25
for 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
sensibility 25
not 25
only 25
does 25
not 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
an 25
indistinct 25
and 25
confused 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
in 25
fact 25
gives 25
us 25
no 25
knowledge 25
of 25
these 25
at 25
all 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
we 25
abstract 25
in 25
thought 25
our 25
own 25
subjective 25
nature 25
the 25
object 25
represented 25
with 25
the 25
properties 25
ascribed 25
to 25
it 25
by 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
entirely 25
disappears 25
because 25
it 25
was 25
only 25
this 25
subjective 25
nature 25
that 25
determined 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
in 25
phenomena 25
we 25
commonly 25
indeed 25
distinguish 25
that 25
which 25
essentially 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
them 25
and 25
is 25
valid 25
for 25
the 25
sensuous 25
faculty 25
of 25
every 25
human 25
being 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
same 25
intuition 25
accidentally 25
as 25
valid 25
not 25
for 25
the 25
sensuous 25
faculty 25
in 25
general 25
but 25
for 25
a 25
particular 25
state 25
or 25
organization 25
of 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
sense 25
accordingly 25
we 25
are 25
accustomed 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
a 25
cognition 25
which 25
represents 25
the 25
object 25
itself 25
whilst 25
the 25
latter 25
presents 25
only 25
a 25
particular 25
appearance 25
or 25
phenomenon 25
thereof 25
this 25
distinction 25
however 25
is 25
only 25
empirical 25
if 25
we 25
stop 25
here 25
as 25
is 25
usual 25
and 25
do 25
not 25
regard 25
the 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
as 25
itself 25
a 25
mere 25
phenomenon 25
as 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
do 25
in 25
which 25
nothing 25
that 25
can 25
appertain 25
to 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
our 25
transcendental 25
distinction 25
is 25
lost 25
and 25
we 25
believe 25
that 25
we 25
cognize 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
although 25
in 25
the 25
whole 25
range 25
of 25
the 25
sensuous 25
world 25
investigate 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
its 25
objects 25
as 25
profoundly 25
as 25
we 25
may 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
nothing 25
but 25
phenomena 25
thus 25
we 25
call 25
the 25
rainbow 25
a 25
mere 25
appearance 25
of 25
phenomenon 25
in 25
a 25
sunny 25
shower 25
and 25
the 25
rain 25
the 25
reality 25
or 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
right 25
enough 25
if 25
we 25
understand 25
the 25
latter 25
conception 25
in 25
a 25
merely 25
physical 25
sense 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
that 25
which 25
in 25
universal 25
experience 25
and 25
under 25
whatever 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensuous 25
perception 25
is 25
known 25
in 25
intuition 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
and 25
so 25
determined 25
and 25
not 25
otherwise 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
consider 25
this 25
empirical 25
datum 25
generally 25
and 25
inquire 25
without 25
reference 25
to 25
its 25
accordance 25
with 25
all 25
our 25
senses 25
whether 25
there 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
it 25
aught 25
which 25
represents 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
the 25
raindrops 25
of 25
course 25
are 25
not 25
such 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
as 25
phenomena 25
empirical 25
objects 25
the 25
question 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
representation 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
is 25
transcendental 25
and 25
not 25
only 25
are 25
the 25
raindrops 25
mere 25
phenomena 25
but 25
even 25
their 25
circular 25
form 25
nay 25
the 25
space 25
itself 25
through 25
which 25
they 25
fall 25
is 25
nothing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
both 25
are 25
mere 25
modifications 25
or 25
fundamental 25
dispositions 25
of 25
our 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
whilst 25
the 25
transcendental 25
object 25
remains 25
for 25
us 25
utterly 25
unknown 25
the 25
second 25
important 25
concern 25
of 25
our 25
aesthetic 25
is 25
that 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
obtain 25
favour 25
merely 25
as 25
a 25
plausible 25
hypothesis 25
but 25
possess 25
as 25
undoubted 25
a 25
character 25
of 25
certainty 25
as 25
can 25
be 25
demanded 25
of 25
any 25
theory 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
serve 25
for 25
an 25
organon 25
in 25
order 25
fully 25
to 25
convince 25
the 25
reader 25
of 25
this 25
certainty 25
we 25
shall 25
select 25
a 25
case 25
which 25
will 25
serve 25
to 25
make 25
its 25
validity 25
apparent 25
and 25
also 25
to 25
illustrate 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
in 25
ss 25
suppose 25
then 25
that 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
objective 25
and 25
conditions 25
of 25

of 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
both 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
very 25
many 25
apodeictic 25
and 25
synthetic 25
propositions 25

priori 25
but 25
especially 25
spaceand 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
we 25
shall 25
prefer 25
it 25
for 25
investigation 25
at 25
present 25
as 25
the 25
propositions 25
of 25
geometry 25
are 25
cognized 25
synthetically 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
with 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
i 25
inquire 25
whence 25
do 25
you 25
obtain 25
propositions 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
and 25
on 25
what 25
basis 25
does 25
the 25
understanding 25
rest 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
such 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
and 25
universally 25
valid 25
truths 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
other 25
way 25
than 25
through 25
intuitions 25

conceptions 25

which 25
they 25
are 25
founded 25

afford 25
any 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25

such 25
as 25
is 25
itself 25
also 25
empirical 25
that 25

the 25
qualities 25
of 25

absolute 25
universality 25
which 25
nevertheless 25
are 25
the 25
characteristics 25

all 25
geometrical 25
propositions 25

first 25

to 25
arrive 25
at 25
such 25

mere 25

no 25
synthetical 25
cognitions 25

only 25
analytical 25
ones 25
can 25
be 25
obtained 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
proposition 25
two 25
straight 25

cannot 25
enclose 25
a 25

with 25
these 25
alone 25
no 25
figure 25
is 25
possible 25
and 25
try 25
to 25
deduce 25
it 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
and 25
the 25
number 25
two 25
or 25
take 25
the 25
proposition 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
construct 25
a 25
figure 25
with 25
three 25
straight 25
lines 25
and 25
endeavour 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
to 25
deduce 25
it 25
from 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
and 25
the 25
number 25
three 25
all 25
your 25
endeavours 25
are 25
in 25
vain 25
and 25
you 25
find 25
yourself 25
forced 25
to 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
intuition 25
as 25
in 25
fact 25
geometry 25
always 25
does 25
you 25
therefore 25
give 25
yourself 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
intuition 25
but 25
of 25
what 25
kind 25
is 25
this 25
intuition 25
is 25
it 25
a 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
or 25
is 25
it 25
an 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
if 25
the 25
latter 25
then 25
neither 25
an 25
universally 25
valid 25
much 25
less 25
an 25
apodeictic 25
proposition 25
can 25
arise 25
from 25
it 25
for 25
experience 25
never 25
can 25
give 25
us 25
any 25
such 25
proposition 25
you 25
must 25
therefore 25
give 25
yourself 25
an 25

a 25

upon 25
that 25
ground 25
your 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
now 25
if 25
there 25
did 25
not 25
exist 25
within 25
you 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
intuition 25
a 25

this 25
subjective 25

its 25
form 25
also 25
the 25
universal 25
condition 25
a 25

under 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
this 25
external 25

itself 25
possible 25
if 25
the 25

that 25

the 25

something 25
in 25
itself 25
without 25

to 25
you 25
the 25

how 25

you 25
affirm 25
that 25
that 25
which 25
lies 25
necessarily 25
in 25
your 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
construct 25
a 25
triangle 25
must 25
also 25
necessarily 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
triangle 25
in 25
itself 25
for 25
to 25
your 25
conceptions 25
of 25
three 25
lines 25
you 25
could 25
not 25
add 25
anything 25
new 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
figure 25
which 25
therefore 25
must 25
necessarily 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
because 25
the 25
object 25
is 25
given 25
before 25
your 25
cognition 25
and 25
not 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
it 25
if 25
therefore 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
also 25
were 25
not 25
a 25
mere 25
form 25
of 25
your 25
intuition 25
which 25
contains 25
conditions 25
a 25

under 25
which 25
alone 25
things 25
can 25
become 25
external 25
objects 25
for 25
you 25
and 25
without 25
which 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
the 25
objects 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
nothing 25
you 25

proposition 25
whatsoever 25
regarding 25
external 25

it 25

therefore 25
not 25
merely 25
possible 25

probable 25

indubitably 25
certain 25
that 25

the 25
necessary 25

of 25
all 25
our 25
external 25

all 25

intuitions 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
which 25
all 25
objects 25
are 25
therefore 25
mere 25
phenomena 25

not 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
in 25
this 25
particular 25

for 25
this 25
reason 25
in 25
respect 25
to 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
phenomena 25
much 25
may 25
be 25
said 25
a 25
priori 25
whilst 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
which 25
may 25
lie 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
these 25
phenomena 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
say 25
anything 25
ii 25
in 25
confirmation 25
of 25
this 25
theory 25
of 25
the 25
ideality 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
internal 25

consequently 25
of 25
all 25
objects 25
of 25
sense 25
as 25
mere 25
phenomena 25
we 25
may 25
especially 25
remark 25
that 25
all 25
in 25
our 25
cognition 25
that 25
belongs 25
to 25
intuition 25
contains 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
mere 25
relations 25
the 25
feelings 25
of 25
pain 25
and 25
pleasure 25
and 25
the 25
will 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
cognitions 25
are 25
excepted 25
the 25
relations 25

wit 25
of 25
place 25
in 25
an 25

extension 25
change 25
of 25
place 25

to 25
which 25
this 25
change 25
is 25
determined 25
moving 25

on 25

taking 25
place 25
in 25
the 25

themselves 25
with 25
the 25
exception 25
of 25

of 25
place 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
by 25
intuition 25
now 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
mere 25
relations 25
a 25
thing 25
cannot 25
be 25
known 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
it 25
may 25
therefore 25
be 25
fairly 25
concluded 25
that 25
as 25
through 25
the 25
external 25
sense 25
nothing 25
but 25
mere 25
representations 25
of 25
relations 25
are 25
given 25
us 25
the 25
said 25
external 25
sense 25
in 25
its 25
representation 25
can 25
contain 25
only 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
but 25
not 25
the 25
essential 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
the 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
internal 25
intuition 25
not 25
only 25
because 25
in 25
the 25
internal 25
intuition 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
senses 25
constitutes 25
the 25
material 25
with 25
which 25
the 25
mind 25
is 25
occupied 25
but 25
because 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
place 25
and 25
which 25
itself 25
antecedes 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
these 25
representations 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
which 25
as 25
the 25
formal 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
mode 25

relations 25
of 25
the 25
successive 25
the 25
coexistent 25
and 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
always 25
must 25
be 25
coexistent 25
with 25
succession 25
the 25
permanent 25
now 25
that 25
which 25
as 25
representation 25
can 25
antecede 25
every 25
exercise 25
of 25
thought 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
is 25
intuition 25
and 25
when 25
it 25
contains 25
nothing 25
but 25
relations 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
intuition 25
which 25
as 25
it 25
presents 25
us 25
with 25
no 25
representation 25
except 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
something 25
is 25
placed 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
can 25
be 25
nothing 25
else 25
than 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
mind 25
is 25
affected 25
by 25
its 25
own 25
activity 25
to 25
witits 25
presenting 25
to 25
itself 25
representations 25
consequently 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
mind 25
is 25
affected 25
by 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
nothing 25
but 25
an 25
internal 25
sense 25
in 25
respect 25
to 25
its 25
form 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25
represented 25
through 25
the 25
medium 25
of 25
sense 25
is 25
so 25
far 25
phenomenal 25
consequently 25
we 25
must 25
either 25
refuse 25
altogether 25
to 25
admit 25
an 25
internal 25
sense 25
or 25
the 25
subject 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
that 25
sense 25
could 25
only 25
be 25
represented 25
by 25
it 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
it 25
would 25
judge 25
of 25
itself 25
if 25
its 25
intuition 25
were 25
pure 25
spontaneous 25
activity 25
that 25
is 25
were 25
intellectual 25
the 25
difficulty 25
here 25
lies 25
wholly 25
in 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
can 25
the 25
subject 25
have 25
an 25
internal 25
intuition 25
of 25
itself 25
but 25
this 25
difficulty 25
is 25
common 25
to 25
every 25
theory 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
self 25
apperception 25
is 25
the 25
simple 25
representation 25
of 25
the 25
ego 25
and 25
if 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
that 25
representation 25
alone 25
all 25
the 25
manifold 25
representations 25
in 25
the 25
subject 25
were 25
spontaneously 25
given 25
then 25
our 25
internal 25
intuition 25
would 25
be 25
intellectual 25
this 25
consciousness 25
in 25
man 25
requires 25
an 25
internal 25
perception 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
representations 25
which 25
are 25
previously 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
subject 25
and 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
these 25
representations 25
are 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
without 25
spontaneity 25
must 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
this 25
difference 25
the 25
want 25
of 25
spontaneity 25
be 25
called 25
sensibility 25
if 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
selfconsciousness 25
is 25
to 25
apprehend 25
what 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
it 25
must 25
all 25
act 25
that 25
and 25
can 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
alone 25
produce 25
an 25
intuition 25
of 25
self 25
but 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
this 25
intuition 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
original 25
constitution 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
determines 25
in 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
time 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
manifold 25
representations 25
are 25
to 25
combine 25
themselves 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
since 25
the 25
subject 25
intuites 25
itself 25
not 25
as 25
it 25
would 25
represent 25
itself 25
immediately 25
and 25
spontaneously 25
but 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
mind 25
is 25
internally 25
affected 25
consequently 25
as 25
it 25
appears 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
iii 25
when 25
we 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
external 25
objects 25
and 25
also 25
the 25
selfintuition 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
represent 25
both 25
objects 25
and 25
subject 25
in 25
space 25

our 25

they 25
appearthis 25
is 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
equivalent 25
to 25
asserting 25
that 25
these 25
objects 25
are 25
mere 25
illusory 25
appearances 25
for 25
when 25
we 25
speak 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
the 25
objects 25
nay 25
even 25
the 25
properties 25
which 25
we 25
ascribe 25
to 25
them 25
are 25
looked 25
upon 25
as 25
really 25
given 25
only 25
that 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
property 25
depends 25
upon 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
in 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
given 25
object 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
the 25
object 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
the 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
thus 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
say 25
that 25
bodies 25
seem 25
or 25
appear 25
to 25
be 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
or 25
that 25
my 25
soul 25
seems 25
merely 25
to 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
my 25
selfconsciousness 25
although 25
i 25
maintain 25
that 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
in 25
conformity 25
to 25
which 25
i 25
set 25
both 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
their 25
existence 25
abide 25
in 25
my 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
and 25
not 25
in 25
the 25
objects 25
in 25
themselves 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
my 25
own 25
fault 25
if 25
out 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
i 25
should 25
reckon 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
i 25
made 25
mere 25
illusory 25
appearance 25
but 25
this 25
will 25
not 25
happen 25
because 25
of 25
our 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
ideality 25
of 25
all 25
sensuous 25
intuitions 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
if 25
we 25
ascribe 25
objective 25

to 25
these 25

it 25
becomes 25
impossible 25

avoid 25
changing 25
everything 25
into 25
mere 25

if 25
we 25
regard 25
space 25

time 25
as 25
properties 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
found 25

then 25
find 25
ourselves 25

as 25
we 25
are 25
compelled 25
to 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
two 25

all 25

we 25
cannot 25
blame 25
the 25
good 25
berkeley 25
for 25
degrading 25
bodies 25
to 25
mere 25
illusory 25
appearances 25
nay 25
even 25
our 25
own 25
existence 25
which 25
would 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
depend 25
upon 25
the 25
selfexistent 25
reality 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
mere 25
nonentity 25
as 25
time 25
would 25
necessarily 25
be 25
changed 25
with 25
it 25
into 25
mere 25
appearancean 25
absurdity 25
which 25
no 25
one 25
has 25
as 25
yet 25
been 25
guilty 25
of 25
footnote 25
the 25
predicates 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
can 25
be 25
affixed 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
itself 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
our 25
sensuous 25
faculty 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
red 25
colour 25
or 25
the 25
perfume 25
to 25
the 25
rose 25
but 25
illusory 25
appearance 25
never 25
can 25
be 25
attributed 25
as 25
a 25
predicate 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
for 25
this 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
attributes 25
to 25
this 25
object 25
in 25
itself 25
that 25
which 25
belongs 25
to 25
it 25
only 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
our 25
sensuous 25
faculty 25
or 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
in 25
general 25
eg 25
the 25
two 25
handles 25
which 25
were 25
formerly 25
ascribed 25
to 25
saturn 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
never 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
itself 25
but 25
always 25
in 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
and 25
which 25
moreover 25
is 25
inseparable 25
from 25
our 25
representation 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
we 25
denominate 25
phenomenon 25
thus 25
the 25
predicates 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
are 25
rightly 25
attributed 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
the 25
senses 25
as 25
such 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
illusion 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
if 25
i 25
ascribe 25
redness 25
of 25
the 25
rose 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
or 25
to 25
saturn 25
his 25
handles 25
or 25
extension 25
to 25
all 25
external 25
objects 25
considered 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
without 25
regarding 25
the 25
determinate 25
relation 25
of 25
these 25
objects 25
to 25
the 25
subject 25
and 25
without 25
limiting 25
my 25
judgement 25
to 25
that 25
relationthen 25
and 25
then 25
only 25
arises 25
illusion 25
iv 25
in 25
natural 25
theology 25
where 25
we 25
think 25
of 25
an 25
objectgodwhich 25
never 25
can 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
intuition 25
to 25
us 25
and 25
even 25
to 25
himself 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
we 25
carefully 25
avoid 25
attributing 25
to 25
his 25
intuition 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
timeand 25
intuition 25
all 25
his 25
cognition 25
must 25
be 25
and 25
not 25
thought 25
which 25
always 25
includes 25
limitation 25
but 25
with 25
what 25
right 25
can 25
we 25
do 25
this 25
if 25
we 25
make 25
them 25
forms 25
of 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
such 25
moreover 25
as 25
would 25
continue 25
to 25
exist 25
as 25
a 25
priori 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
even 25
though 25
the 25
things 25
themselves 25
were 25
annihilated 25
for 25
as 25
conditions 25
of 25
all 25
existence 25
in 25
general 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
must 25
be 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
supreme 25
being 25
also 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
thus 25
make 25
them 25
objective 25
forms 25
of 25
all 25
things 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
other 25
way 25
left 25
than 25
to 25
make 25
them 25
subjective 25
forms 25
of 25
our 25
mode 25
of 25
intuitionexternal 25
and 25
internal 25
which 25
is 25
called 25
sensuous 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
primitive 25
that 25
is 25
is 25
not 25
such 25
as 25
gives 25
in 25
itself 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
intuition 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
which 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
can 25
judge 25
can 25
belong 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
creator 25
but 25
is 25
dependent 25
on 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
is 25
possible 25
therefore 25
only 25
on 25
condition 25
that 25
the 25
representative 25
faculty 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
is 25
affected 25
by 25
the 25
object 25
it 25
is 25
moreover 25
not 25
necessary 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
limit 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
in 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
to 25
the 25
sensuous 25
faculty 25
of 25
man 25
it 25
may 25
well 25
be 25
that 25
all 25
finite 25
thinking 25
beings 25
must 25
necessarily 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
agree 25
with 25
man 25
though 25
as 25
to 25
this 25
we 25
cannot 25
decide 25
but 25
sensibility 25
does 25
not 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
this 25
universality 25
cease 25
to 25
be 25
sensibility 25
for 25
this 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
deduced 25
intuitus 25
derivativus 25
and 25
not 25
an 25
original 25
intuitus 25
originarius 25
consequently 25
not 25
an 25
intellectual 25
intuition 25
and 25
this 25
intuition 25
as 25
such 25
for 25
reasons 25
above 25
mentioned 25
seems 25
to 25
belong 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
supreme 25
being 25
but 25
never 25
to 25
a 25
being 25
dependent 25
quoad 25
its 25
existence 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
its 25
intuition 25
which 25
its 25
existence 25
determines 25
and 25
limits 25
relatively 25
to 25
given 25
objects 25
this 25
latter 25
remark 25
however 25
must 25
be 25
taken 25
only 25
as 25
an 25
illustration 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
any 25

the 25
grand 25

in 25
possession 25

pure 25

namely 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
in 25

we 25
find 25
when 25
in 25
a 25
judgement 25

we 25

out 25

is 25
not 25

is 25
certainly 25
found 25
a 25

in 25
the 25
intuition 25

corresponds 25
to 25

can 25
be 25
united 25
synthetically 25
with 25
it 25

the 25
judgements 25
which 25
these 25
pure 25
intuitions 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
make 25
never 25
reach 25
farther 25
than 25
to 25

our 25

springs 25
from 25
two 25
main 25
sources 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
first 25
of 25

is 25
the 25

representations 25
receptivity 25
for 25

the 25

therefore 25
that 25

be 25
carefully 25

short 25

dry 25

of 25
an 25
object 25
would 25
of 25
course 25
exclude 25
all 25
those 25
cognitions 25
which 25
were 25
of 25
empirical 25
content 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
logic 25
would 25
also 25
examine 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
of 25
objects 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
that 25
origin 25
cannot 25
be 25
ascribed 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
themselves 25
while 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
general 25
logic 25
has 25
nothing 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
but 25
contemplates 25
our 25
representations 25
be 25
they 25
given 25
primitively 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
ourselves 25
or 25
be 25
they 25
only 25
of 25
empirical 25
origin 25
solely 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
observes 25
in 25
employing 25
them 25
in 25
the 25
process 25
of 25
thought 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
consequently 25
general 25
logic 25
treats 25
of 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
only 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
applied 25
to 25
representations 25
from 25
whatever 25
source 25
they 25
may 25
have 25
arisen 25
and 25
here 25
i 25
shall 25
make 25
a 25
remark 25
which 25
the 25
reader 25
must 25
bear 25
well 25
in 25
mind 25
in 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
the 25
following 25
considerations 25
to 25
wit 25
that 25
not 25
every 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
only 25
those 25
through 25
which 25
we 25
cognize 25
that 25
and 25
how 25
certain 25
representations 25
intuitions 25
or 25
conceptions 25
are 25
applied 25
or 25
are 25
possible 25
only 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
possibility 25
of 25
cognition 25
and 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
use 25
of 25
it 25
are 25
transcendental 25
therefore 25
neither 25
is 25
space 25
nor 25
any 25
a 25
priori 25
geometrical 25
determination 25
of 25
space 25
a 25
transcendental 25
representation 25
but 25
only 25
the 25
knowledge 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
representation 25
is 25
not 25
of 25
empirical 25
origin 25
and 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
its 25
relating 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
although 25
itself 25
a 25
priori 25
can 25
be 25
called 25
transcendental 25
so 25
also 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
space 25
to 25
objects 25
in 25
general 25
would 25
be 25
transcendental 25
but 25
if 25
it 25
be 25
limited 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
sense 25
it 25
is 25
empirical 25
thus 25
the 25
distinction 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
and 25
empirical 25
belongs 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
cognitions 25
and 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
these 25
to 25
their 25
object 25
accordingly 25
in 25
the 25
expectation 25
that 25
there 25
may 25
perhaps 25
be 25
conceptions 25
which 25
relate 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
objects 25
not 25
as 25
pure 25
or 25
sensuous 25
intuitions 25
but 25
merely 25
as 25
acts 25
of 25
pure 25
thought 25
which 25
are 25
therefore 25
conceptions 25
but 25
neither 25
of 25
empirical 25
nor 25
aesthetical 25
originin 25
this 25
expectation 25
i 25
say 25
we 25
form 25
to 25
ourselves 25
by 25
anticipation 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
of 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
rational 25
cognition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
cogitate 25
objects 25
entirely 25
a 25
priori 25
a 25
science 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
which 25
should 25
determine 25
the 25
origin 25
the 25
extent 25
and 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
such 25
cognitions 25
must 25
be 25
called 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
because 25
it 25
has 25
not 25
like 25
general 25
logic 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
empirical 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
pure 25
rational 25
cognitions 25
without 25
distinction 25
but 25
concerns 25
itself 25
with 25

only 25
in 25

iii 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
general 25
logic 25
into 25
analytic 25
and 25
dialectic 25
the 25
old 25
question 25
with 25
which 25
people 25
sought 25
to 25
push 25
logicians 25
into 25
a 25
corner 25
so 25
that 25
they 25
must 25
either 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
pitiful 25
sophisms 25
or 25
confess 25
their 25
ignorance 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
vanity 25
of 25
their 25
whole 25
art 25
is 25
this 25
what 25
is 25

we 25

to 25
be 25
told 25

itself 25
a 25
strong 25
evidence 25

if 25

we 25
are 25
presented 25
with 25
the 25
ridiculous 25
spectacle 25
of 25
one 25
as 25
the 25
ancients 25
said 25
milking 25
the 25
hegoat 25
and 25
the 25
other 25
holding 25

in 25
the 25
accordance 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
with 25

facto 25
distinguished 25
from 25

for 25
a 25
cognition 25
is 25
false 25
if 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
accord 25
with 25
the 25
object 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
relates 25
although 25
it 25
contains 25
something 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
affirmed 25
of 25
other 25
objects 25
now 25
an 25
universal 25
criterion 25
of 25
truth 25
would 25
be 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
valid 25
for 25
all 25
cognitions 25
without 25
distinction 25
of 25
their 25
objects 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
since 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
criterion 25
we 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
all 25
relation 25
to 25
its 25
object 25
and 25
truth 25
relates 25
precisely 25
to 25
this 25
content 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
utterly 25
absurd 25
to 25
ask 25
for 25
a 25
mark 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
this 25
content 25
of 25
cognition 25
and 25
that 25
accordingly 25
a 25
sufficient 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
universal 25
test 25
of 25
truth 25
cannot 25
possibly 25
be 25
found 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
termed 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
its 25
matter 25
we 25
shall 25
say 25
of 25
the 25

our 25
cognitions 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
their 25
matter 25
no 25
universal 25
test 25
can 25
be 25
demanded 25
because 25
such 25
a 25
demand 25
is 25
selfcontradictory 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25

to 25
our 25
cognition 25
in 25

of 25
its 25
mere 25
form 25
excluding 25
all 25
content 25
it 25
is 25
equally 25
manifest 25
that 25
logic 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
exhibits 25
the 25
universal 25
and 25
necessary 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
must 25
in 25
these 25
very 25
laws 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
criteria 25
of 25
truth 25
whatever 25
contradicts 25
these 25
rules 25
is 25
false 25
because 25
thereby 25
the 25
understanding 25
is 25
made 25
to 25
contradict 25
its 25
own 25
universal 25
laws 25
of 25
thought 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
contradict 25
itself 25
these 25
criteria 25
however 25
apply 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
truth 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
thought 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
they 25
are 25
perfectly 25
accurate 25
yet 25
not 25
sufficient 25
for 25
although 25
a 25
cognition 25
may 25
be 25
perfectly 25
accurate 25
as 25
to 25
logical 25
form 25
that 25
is 25
not 25
selfcontradictory 25
it 25
is 25
notwithstanding 25
quite 25
possible 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
not 25
stand 25
in 25
agreement 25
with 25
its 25
object 25
consequently 25
the 25
merely 25
logical 25
criterion 25
of 25
truth 25
namely 25
the 25
accordance 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
with 25
the 25
universal 25
and 25
formal 25
laws 25
of 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
conditio 25
sine 25
qua 25
non 25
or 25
negative 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
truth 25
farther 25
than 25
this 25
logic 25
cannot 25
go 25
and 25
the 25
error 25
which 25
depends 25
not 25
on 25
the 25
form 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
it 25
has 25
no 25
test 25
to 25
discover 25
general 25
logic 25
then 25
resolves 25
the 25
whole 25
formal 25
business 25
of 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
into 25
its 25
elements 25

exhibits 25
them 25
as 25
principles 25
of 25
all 25
logical 25
judging 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
this 25
part 25
of 25
logic 25
may 25
therefore 25
be 25
called 25
analytic 25
and 25
is 25
at 25
least 25
the 25
negative 25
test 25
of 25
truth 25
because 25
all 25
cognitions 25
must 25
first 25
of 25
an 25
be 25
estimated 25
and 25
tried 25
according 25
to 25
these 25
laws 25
before 25
we 25
proceed 25
to 25
investigate 25
them 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
their 25
content 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
discover 25
whether 25
they 25
contain 25
positive 25
truth 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
their 25

because 25
however 25

of 25
a 25
cognition 25
accurately 25
as 25
it 25
may 25
accord 25
with 25
logical 25
laws 25
is 25
insufficient 25
to 25
supply 25
us 25
with 25
material 25
objective 25
truth 25
no 25
one 25
by 25
means 25
of 25

alone 25
can 25
venture 25
to 25
predicate 25
anything 25
of 25

decide 25
concerning 25
objects 25
unless 25

has 25
obtained 25

wellgrounded 25
information 25
about 25
them 25
in 25

we 25
may 25

sadly 25
deficientthat 25
general 25
logic 25
which 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
canon 25
of 25
judgement 25
has 25

employed 25
as 25
an 25

rather 25

thus 25
been 25
grossly 25
misapplied 25
now 25
general 25
logic 25

its 25
assumed 25
character 25
of 25

called 25
dialectic 25
different 25
as 25

the 25

this 25

a 25
science 25

an 25
art 25

may 25
safely 25
infer 25
from 25
their 25
actual 25
employment 25
of 25
it 25
that 25
with 25
them 25
it 25
was 25
nothing 25
else 25
than 25
a 25
logic 25
of 25
illusiona 25
sophistical 25
art 25

giving 25
ignorance 25
nay 25
even 25
intentional 25
sophistries 25
the 25
colouring 25

which 25
the 25
thoroughness 25
of 25
procedure 25
which 25
logic 25
requires 25
was 25
imitated 25
and 25
their 25
topic 25
employed 25
to 25
cloak 25
the 25
empty 25
pretensions 25
now 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
taken 25
as 25
a 25
safe 25
and 25
useful 25
warning 25
that 25
general 25
logic 25
considered 25
as 25
an 25
organon 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
a 25
logic 25
of 25
illusion 25
that 25
is 25
be 25
dialectical 25
for 25
as 25
it 25
teaches 25
us 25
nothing 25
whatever 25
respecting 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
but 25
merely 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
their 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
relate 25
to 25
and 25
are 25
quite 25
indifferent 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
objects 25
any 25
attempt 25
to 25
employ 25
it 25

an 25
instrument 25

to 25
extend 25

enlarge 25
the 25
range 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
must 25
end 25
in 25
mere 25
prating 25

able 25
to 25
maintain 25

oppose 25
with 25
some 25
appearance 25
of 25
truth 25
any 25
single 25
assertion 25
whatever 25
such 25
instruction 25
is 25
quite 25
unbecoming 25
the 25
dignity 25
of 25
philosophy 25
for 25
these 25
reasons 25
we 25
have 25
chosen 25
to 25
denominate 25
this 25
part 25
of 25
logic 25
dialectic 25
in 25
the 25
sense 25
of 25
a 25
critique 25
of 25
dialectical 25
illusion 25
and 25
we 25
wish 25
the 25
term 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
understood 25
in 25
this 25
place 25
iv 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
into 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
and 25
dialectic 25
in 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
we 25
isolate 25
the 25
understanding 25
as 25
in 25
transcendental 25
aesthetic 25
the 25
sensibility 25
and 25
select 25
from 25
our 25
cognition 25
merely 25
that 25
part 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
has 25
its 25
origin 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
alone 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
this 25
pure 25
cognition 25
however 25
depends 25
upon 25
this 25
as 25
its 25
condition 25
that 25
objects 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
applied 25
be 25
given 25

without 25
intuition 25
the 25
whole 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
is 25
without 25

is 25
therefore 25
quite 25
void 25

part 25
of 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
then 25
which 25
treats 25

elements 25

pure 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25

of 25
the 25
principles 25

no 25
object 25
at 25
all 25
can 25
be 25
thought 25
is 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
a 25
logic 25
of 25
truth 25
for 25
no 25
cognition 25
can 25
contradict 25
it 25
without 25
losing 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
all 25
content 25
that 25
is 25
losing 25
all 25
reference 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
and 25
therefore 25
all 25
truth 25
but 25
because 25
we 25
are 25
very 25
easily 25
seduced 25
into 25
employing 25
these 25
pure 25
cognitions 25
and 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
by 25
themselves 25

that 25
even 25
beyond 25
the 25
boundaries 25
of 25

which 25
yet 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
source 25
whence 25
we 25
can 25
obtain 25

those 25

conceptions 25
may 25
be 25

the 25
risk 25
of 25
making 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
empty 25
sophisms 25
a 25
material 25
and 25
objective 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
mere 25
formal 25
principles 25

the 25

of 25
passing 25

on 25
objects 25

distinctionobjects 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
nay 25
perhaps 25
cannot 25
be 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
in 25
any 25
way 25
now 25
as 25
it 25
ought 25
properly 25
to 25
be 25
only 25
a 25
canon 25

the 25
empirical 25

this 25
kind 25

logic 25

misused 25

we 25
seek 25
to 25
employ 25
it 25
as 25
an 25
organon 25
of 25
the 25
universal 25

unlimited 25
exercise 25

we 25

reduce 25
all 25
acts 25

so 25
that 25

be 25
represented 25

the 25

judging 25

cognition 25

of 25
conceptions 25
but 25
conceptions 25
as 25
predicates 25
of 25
possible 25
judgements 25
relate 25
to 25
some 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
yet 25
undetermined 25
object 25
thus 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
body 25
indicates 25
somethingfor 25

can 25
be 25
cognized 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
that 25
conception 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
a 25
conception 25
for 25
the 25
reason 25
alone 25
that 25
other 25
representations 25

contained 25

it 25

of 25
which 25
it 25
can 25
relate 25

every 25

all 25
the 25

therefore 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
when 25
we 25
can 25
completely 25
exhibit 25
the 25
functions 25

in 25
judgements 25

that 25
this 25
may 25

all 25

consider 25
only 25
the 25

we 25
find 25
that 25
the 25

be 25
treated 25

precisely 25
because 25

the 25

valid 25
for 25
the 25

just 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
a 25
general 25

had 25
extent 25
to 25

of 25
which 25
the 25

applied 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
let 25
us 25
compare 25
a 25
singular 25
with 25
a 25
general 25
judgement 25
merely 25
as 25
a 25

therefore 25
in 25
itself 25
essentially 25
different 25
thus 25
if 25
we 25
estimate 25
a 25

not 25
merely 25
according 25
to 25
its 25

be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
affirmative 25

although 25
in 25

they 25
are 25
rightly 25

at 25

ward 25
off 25

by 25

only 25

far 25

that 25
the 25
mortal 25

excluded 25
from 25
it 25

the 25
soul 25

this 25
exception 25
infinite 25

more 25

more 25

taken 25

from 25
the 25
whole 25

propositions 25

a 25
question 25
not 25

nothing 25

a 25
certain 25
consequence 25
finally 25
the 25
disjunctive 25
judgement 25
contains 25
a 25

of 25
two 25

more 25
propositions 25
to 25
each 25

not 25
of 25

of 25
logical 25
opposition 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
proposition 25
excludes 25
that 25

it 25

at 25
the 25

a 25
relation 25
of 25

the 25
disjunctive 25

therefore 25

relation 25

the 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
a 25

the 25

a 25
complemental 25
part 25
of 25

the 25
sum 25
total 25
of 25
the 25
divided 25
cognition 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
proposition 25
the 25
world 25
exists 25
either 25
through 25
blind 25
chance 25
or 25
through 25
internal 25
necessity 25
or 25
through 25
an 25
external 25
cause 25
each 25
of 25
these 25
propositions 25
embraces 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
possible 25
cognition 25
as 25
to 25
the 25

the 25

out 25

equivalent 25

placing 25
it 25
in 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
others 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25

to 25
taking 25
it 25
out 25

the 25
rest 25
there 25
is 25
therefore 25
in 25
a 25
disjunctive 25
judgement 25
a 25
certain 25
community 25
of 25
cognitions 25
which 25
consists 25
in 25
this 25
that 25
they 25
mutually 25
exclude 25
each 25
other 25
yet 25
thereby 25
determine 25
as 25
a 25
whole 25
the 25
true 25
cognition 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
taken 25
together 25
they 25
make 25
up 25
the 25
complete 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
particular 25
given 25
cognition 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
all 25
that 25
i 25
find 25
necessary 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
what 25
follows 25
to 25
remark 25
in 25
this 25
place 25
the 25
modality 25
of 25
judgements 25
is 25
a 25
quite 25
peculiar 25
function 25
with 25
this 25
distinguishing 25
characteristic 25
that 25
it 25
contributes 25
nothing 25
to 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25
for 25
besides 25
quantity 25
quality 25
and 25
relation 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
that 25
constitutes 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25
but 25
concerns 25
itself 25
only 25
with 25
the 25
value 25
of 25
the 25
copula 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
thought 25
in 25
general 25
problematical 25
judgements 25
are 25
those 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
affirmation 25
or 25
negation 25
is 25
accepted 25
as 25
merely 25
possible 25
ad 25
libitum 25
in 25
the 25
assertorical 25
we 25
regard 25
the 25
proposition 25
as 25
real 25
true 25
in 25
the 25
apodeictical 25
we 25
look 25
on 25
it 25
as 25
necessary 25
thus 25
the 25
two 25
judgements 25
antecedens 25
et 25
consequens 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
which 25
constitutes 25
a 25
hypothetical 25
judgement 25
likewise 25
those 25
the 25
members 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
in 25
whose 25
reciprocity 25
the 25
disjunctive 25
consists 25
are 25
only 25
problematical 25
in 25
the 25
example 25
above 25
given 25
the 25
proposition 25
there 25
exists 25
perfect 25
justice 25
is 25
not 25
stated 25
assertorically 25
but 25
as 25
an 25
ad 25
libitum 25
judgement 25
which 25
someone 25
may 25
choose 25
to 25
adopt 25
and 25
the 25
consequence 25
alone 25
is 25
assertorical 25
hence 25
such 25
judgements 25
may 25
be 25
obviously 25
false 25
and 25
yet 25
taken 25
problematically 25
be 25
conditions 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
thus 25
the 25
proposition 25
the 25
world 25
exists 25
only 25
by 25
blind 25
chance 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
disjunctive 25
judgement 25
of 25
problematical 25
import 25
only 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
one 25
may 25
accept 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
moment 25
and 25
it 25
helps 25
us 25
like 25
the 25
indication 25
of 25
the 25
wrong 25
road 25
among 25
all 25
the 25
roads 25
that 25
one 25
can 25
take 25
to 25
find 25
out 25
the 25
true 25
proposition 25
the 25
problematical 25
proposition 25
is 25
therefore 25
that 25
which 25
expresses 25
only 25
logical 25
possibility 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
objective 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
expresses 25
a 25
free 25
choice 25
to 25
admit 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
propositiona 25
merely 25
arbitrary 25
reception 25
of 25
it 25
into 25
the 25

the 25
assertorical 25
speaks 25
of 25
logical 25
reality 25

truth 25
as 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
a 25
hypothetical 25
syllogism 25
the 25
antecedens 25
presents 25
itself 25
in 25
a 25
problematical 25
form 25
in 25
the 25
major 25
in 25
an 25
assertorical 25
form 25
in 25
the 25
minor 25
and 25
it 25
shows 25
that 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
apodeictical 25
proposition 25
cogitates 25
the 25
assertorical 25
as 25
determined 25
by 25
these 25
very 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
consequently 25
as 25
affirming 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
manner 25
it 25
expresses 25
logical 25
necessity 25
now 25
because 25
all 25
is 25
here 25
gradually 25
incorporated 25
with 25
the 25
understandinginasmuch 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
we 25
judge 25
problematically 25
then 25
accept 25
assertorically 25
our 25
judgement 25
as 25
true 25
lastly 25
affirm 25
it 25
as 25
inseparably 25
united 25
with 25
the 25
understanding 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
necessary 25
and 25
apodeictical 25
we 25
may 25
safely 25
reckon 25
these 25
three 25
functions 25
of 25
modality 25
as 25
so 25
many 25

the 25

the 25

synthesis 25
in 25
its 25
most 25
general 25
signification 25
i 25

the 25
process 25

their 25

this 25
synthesis 25
is 25
pure 25
when 25
the 25
diversity 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
empirically 25
but 25
a 25
priori 25
as 25
that 25
in 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
our 25
representations 25
must 25
be 25
given 25
previously 25

any 25

it 25
given 25
a 25

empirically 25
is 25
the 25
first 25
requisite 25
for 25
the 25
production 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
which 25
in 25
its 25
beginning 25
indeed 25
may 25
be 25
crude 25

confused 25
and 25
therefore 25
in 25
need 25
of 25

synthesis 25
is 25
that 25
by 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
elements 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
are 25
collected 25
and 25
united 25
into 25
a 25
certain 25
content 25
consequently 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
first 25
thing 25

we 25

fix 25
our 25
attention 25
if 25
we 25

to 25
investigate 25
the 25

knowledge 25
synthesis 25
generally 25
speaking 25

we 25

afterwards 25
see 25
the 25
mere 25
operation 25

blind 25

indispensable 25
function 25

the 25
soul 25
without 25
which 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
no 25
cognition 25
whatever 25
but 25
of 25
the 25
working 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
seldom 25
even 25
conscious 25
but 25
to 25
reduce 25
this 25

to 25

is 25
a 25
function 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
by 25

of 25
which 25
we 25
attain 25
to 25

the 25
proper 25
meaning 25
of 25
the 25
term 25
pure 25
synthesis 25
represented 25
generally 25
gives 25
us 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25

by 25

that 25

rests 25
upon 25
a 25
basis 25
of 25
a 25

synthetical 25
unity 25
thus 25
our 25
numeration 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
more 25
observable 25
in 25
large 25
numbers 25
is 25
a 25
synthesis 25
according 25
to 25
conceptions 25
because 25
it 25
takes 25
place 25

for 25

the 25

therefore 25
the 25

in 25
the 25
synthesis 25

the 25

the 25

first 25
thing 25
which 25
must 25
be 25

us 25
for 25

the 25
second 25

this 25

yet 25
no 25

these 25
conceptions 25
are 25

the 25

the 25

abide 25

a 25
design 25
worthy 25
of 25
an 25
acute 25
thinker 25

aristotle 25
to 25
search 25
for 25
these 25
fundamental 25
conceptions 25
destitute 25
however 25
of 25
any 25
guiding 25
principle 25
he 25
picked 25
them 25
up 25
just 25

they 25

to 25
him 25

at 25
first 25
hunted 25
out 25
ten 25
which 25
he 25
called 25
categories 25

afterwards 25
be 25
believed 25
that 25
he 25
had 25
discovered 25
five 25

were 25
added 25
under 25
the 25

his 25
catalogue 25
still 25
remained 25
defective 25
besides 25
there 25
are 25
to 25
be 25

is 25
to 25
be 25
remarked 25
that 25
the 25

as 25
the 25
true 25
primitive 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25

have 25
also 25
their 25
pure 25

conceptions 25

in 25
a 25
complete 25
system 25
of 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
must 25
by 25
no 25

be 25
passed 25
over 25
though 25
in 25
a 25
merely 25
critical 25
essay 25
we 25
must 25
be 25
contented 25
with 25
the 25
simple 25
mention 25

the 25

it 25
be 25

so 25
with 25
the 25
rest 25
the 25
categories 25
combined 25
with 25
the 25
modes 25
of 25
pure 25
sensibility 25
or 25
with 25
one 25
another 25
afford 25
a 25
great 25
number 25
of 25
deduced 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
a 25
complete 25
enumeration 25
of 25
which 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
useful 25
and 25
not 25
unpleasant 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
place 25
a 25
perfectly 25
dispensable 25
occupation 25
i 25
purposely 25
omit 25
the 25
definitions 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
in 25
this 25
treatise 25
i 25
shall 25
analyse 25
these 25
conceptions 25
only 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
is 25
necessary 25
for 25
the 25
doctrine 25
of 25
method 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
form 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
this 25
critique 25
in 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
definitions 25
of 25
them 25
would 25
be 25
with 25
justice 25
demanded 25
of 25
me 25
but 25
to 25
give 25
them 25
here 25
would 25
only 25
bide 25
from 25
our 25
view 25
the 25
main 25
aim 25
of 25
our 25
investigation 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
raising 25
doubts 25
and 25
objections 25
the 25
consideration 25
of 25
which 25
without 25
injustice 25
to 25
our 25
main 25
purpose 25
may 25
be 25
very 25
well 25
postponed 25
till 25
another 25
opportunity 25
meanwhile 25
it 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
sufficiently 25
clear 25
from 25
the 25
little 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
said 25
on 25
this 25
subject 25
that 25
the 25
formation 25
of 25
a 25
complete 25
vocabulary 25
of 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
accompanied 25
by 25
all 25
the 25
requisite 25
explanations 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
a 25
possible 25
but 25
an 25
easy 25
undertaking 25
the 25
compartments 25
already 25
exist 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
necessary 25
to 25
fill 25
them 25
up 25
and 25
a 25
systematic 25
topic 25
like 25
the 25
present 25
indicates 25
with 25
perfect 25
precision 25
the 25
proper 25
place 25
to 25
which 25
each 25
conception 25
belongs 25
while 25
it 25
readily 25
points 25
out 25
any 25
that 25
have 25
not 25
yet 25
been 25
filled 25
up 25
ss 25
our 25
table 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
suggests 25
considerations 25
of 25
some 25
importance 25
which 25
may 25
perhaps 25
have 25
significant 25
results 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
scientific 25
form 25
of 25
all 25
rational 25
cognitions 25
for 25
that 25
this 25
table 25
is 25
useful 25
in 25
the 25
theoretical 25
part 25
of 25
philosophy 25
nay 25
indispensable 25
for 25
the 25
sketching 25
of 25
the 25
complete 25
plan 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
that 25
science 25
rests 25
upon 25
conceptions 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
for 25
dividing 25
it 25
mathematically 25
according 25
to 25
fixed 25
principles 25
is 25
most 25
manifest 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25
contains 25
all 25
the 25
elementary 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
nay 25
even 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
these 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
itself 25
and 25
consequently 25
indicates 25
all 25
the 25
momenta 25
and 25
also 25
the 25
internal 25
arrangement 25
of 25
a 25
projected 25
speculative 25
science 25
as 25
i 25
have 25
elsewhere 25
shown 25
footnote 25
in 25
the 25
metaphysical 25
principles 25
of 25
natural 25
science 25
here 25
follow 25
some 25
of 25
these 25
observations 25
i 25
this 25
table 25
which 25
contains 25
four 25
classes 25
of 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
may 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
instance 25
be 25
divided 25
into 25
two 25
classes 25
the 25
first 25
of 25
which 25
relates 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
intuitionpure 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
empirical 25
the 25
second 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
these 25
objects 25
either 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
one 25
another 25
or 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
former 25
of 25
these 25
classes 25
of 25
categories 25
i 25
would 25
entitle 25
the 25
mathematical 25
and 25
the 25
latter 25
the 25
dynamical 25
categories 25
the 25
former 25
as 25
we 25
see 25
has 25
no 25
correlates 25
these 25
are 25
only 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
class 25
this 25
difference 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
ground 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
understanding 25
ii 25
the 25
number 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
in 25
each 25
class 25
is 25
always 25
the 25
same 25
namely 25
threea 25
fact 25
which 25
also 25
demands 25
some 25
consideration 25
because 25
in 25
all 25
other 25
cases 25
division 25
a 25
priori 25
through 25
conceptions 25
is 25
necessarily 25
dichotomy 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
added 25
that 25
the 25
third 25
category 25
in 25
each 25
triad 25
always 25
arises 25
from 25
the 25
combination 25
of 25
the 25
second 25
with 25
the 25
first 25
thus 25
totality 25
is 25
nothing 25
else 25
but 25
plurality 25
contemplated 25
as 25
unity 25
limitation 25
is 25
merely 25
reality 25
conjoined 25
with 25
negation 25
community 25
is 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
a 25
substance 25
reciprocally 25
determining 25
and 25
determined 25
by 25
other 25
substances 25
and 25
finally 25
necessity 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
existence 25
which 25
is 25
given 25
through 25
the 25
possibility 25
itself 25
let 25
it 25
not 25
be 25
supposed 25
however 25
that 25
the 25
third 25
category 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
deduced 25
and 25
not 25
a 25
primitive 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
for 25
the 25
conjunction 25
of 25
the 25
first 25
and 25
second 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
produce 25
the 25
third 25
conception 25
requires 25
a 25
particular 25
function 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
is 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
identical 25
with 25
those 25
which 25
are 25
exercised 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
and 25
second 25
thus 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
number 25
which 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
totality 25
is 25
not 25
always 25
possible 25
where 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
multitude 25
and 25
unity 25
exist 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
the 25
infinite 25
or 25
if 25
i 25
conjoin 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
substance 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
follow 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
influence 25
that 25
is 25
how 25
one 25
substance 25
can 25
be 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
something 25
in 25
another 25
substance 25
will 25
be 25
understood 25
from 25
that 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
a 25
particular 25
act 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
is 25
here 25
necessary 25
and 25
so 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
instances 25
iii 25
with 25
respect 25
to 25
one 25
category 25
namely 25
that 25
of 25
community 25
which 25
is 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
third 25
class 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
so 25
easy 25
as 25
with 25
the 25
others 25
to 25
detect 25
its 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
disjunctive 25
judgement 25
which 25
corresponds 25
to 25
it 25
in 25
the 25
table 25
of 25
the 25
logical 25
functions 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
assure 25
ourselves 25
of 25
this 25
accordance 25
we 25
must 25
observe 25
that 25
in 25
every 25
disjunctive 25
judgement 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
complex 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
it 25
is 25
represented 25
as 25
a 25
whole 25
divided 25
into 25
parts 25
and 25
since 25
one 25
part 25
cannot 25
be 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
they 25
are 25
cogitated 25
as 25
coordinated 25
with 25
not 25
subordinated 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
so 25
that 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
determine 25
each 25
other 25
unilaterally 25
as 25
in 25
a 25
linear 25
series 25
but 25
reciprocally 25
as 25
in 25
an 25
aggregateif 25
one 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
is 25
posited 25
all 25
the 25
rest 25
are 25
excluded 25
and 25
conversely 25
now 25
a 25
like 25
connection 25
is 25
cogitated 25
in 25
a 25
whole 25
of 25
things 25
for 25
one 25
thing 25
is 25
not 25
subordinated 25
as 25
effect 25
to 25
another 25
as 25
cause 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
is 25
coordinated 25
contemporaneously 25
and 25
reciprocally 25
as 25
a 25
cause 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
others 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
a 25
bodythe 25
parts 25
of 25
which 25
mutually 25
attract 25
and 25
repel 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
an 25
entirely 25
different 25
kind 25
of 25
connection 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
we 25
find 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
cause 25
to 25
the 25
effect 25
the 25
principle 25
to 25
the 25
consequence 25
for 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
connection 25
the 25
consequence 25
does 25
not 25
in 25
its 25
turn 25
determine 25
the 25
principle 25
and 25
therefore 25
does 25
not 25
constitute 25
with 25
the 25
latter 25
a 25
wholejust 25
as 25
the 25
creator 25
does 25
not 25
with 25
the 25
world 25
make 25
up 25
a 25
whole 25
the 25
process 25
of 25
understanding 25
by 25
which 25
it 25
represents 25
to 25
itself 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
a 25
divided 25
conception 25
is 25
employed 25
also 25
when 25
we 25
think 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
as 25
divisible 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
manner 25
as 25
the 25
members 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
exclude 25
one 25
another 25
and 25
yet 25
are 25
connected 25
in 25
one 25
sphere 25
so 25
the 25
understanding 25
represents 25
to 25
itself 25
the 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25

others 25
and 25
yet 25
as 25
united 25
in 25
one 25
whole 25
ss 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
of 25
the 25
ancients 25
there 25
exists 25
one 25
more 25
leading 25
division 25
which 25
contains 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
which 25
although 25
not 25
numbered 25
among 25
the 25
categories 25
ought 25
according 25
to 25
them 25
as 25
conceptions 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
be 25
valid 25
of 25
objects 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
they 25
would 25
augment 25

number 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25

the 25

be 25
grounded 25

some 25

all 25

this 25

the 25
categories 25

all 25

most 25
unguardedly 25
changed 25
these 25

an 25

there 25
is 25
unity 25
of 25
conception 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
qualitative 25
unity 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
by 25
this 25
term 25
we 25
understand 25
only 25
the 25
unity 25
in 25
our 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25

secondly 25
there 25
is 25
truth 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
the 25
deductions 25
from 25
it 25
the 25
more 25
true 25
deductions 25
we 25
have 25
from 25
a 25
given 25
conception 25
the 25
more 25
criteria 25
of 25
its 25
objective 25
reality 25
this 25
we 25
might 25
call 25
the 25
qualitative 25
plurality 25
of 25
characteristic 25
marks 25
which 25
belong 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
as 25
to 25
a 25
common 25
foundation 25
but 25
are 25
not 25
cogitated 25
as 25
a 25
quantity 25
in 25
it 25
thirdly 25
there 25
is 25
perfectionwhich 25
consists 25
in 25
this 25
that 25
the 25
plurality 25
falls 25
back 25
upon 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
and 25
accords 25
completely 25
with 25
that 25
conception 25
and 25
with 25
no 25
other 25
this 25
we 25
may 25
denominate 25
qualitative 25
completeness 25
hence 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
these 25
logical 25
criteria 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
cognition 25
are 25
merely 25
the 25
three 25
categories 25
of 25
quantity 25
modified 25
and 25
transformed 25
to 25
suit 25
an 25
unauthorized 25
manner 25
of 25
applying 25
them 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
three 25
categories 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
production 25
of 25
the 25
quantum 25
must 25
be 25
homogeneous 25
throughout 25
are 25
transformed 25
solely 25
with 25
a 25
view 25
to 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
heterogeneous 25
parts 25
of 25
cognition 25
in 25
one 25
act 25
of 25
consciousness 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
quality 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
that 25
connection 25
thus 25
the 25
criterion 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
conception 25
not 25
of 25

is 25
the 25
definition 25
of 25

in 25
which 25

all 25
that 25

it 25

finally 25
the 25
completeness 25
of 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
thus 25
deduced 25

requisites 25
for 25
the 25
reproduction 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25

thus 25
also 25
the 25
criterion 25

test 25
of 25
an 25

the 25

speaking 25

we 25

a 25
great 25
number 25
of 25
empirical 25
conceptions 25
without 25
opposition 25

any 25

consider 25
ourselves 25
even 25
without 25
any 25
attempt 25
at 25
deduction 25
justified 25
in 25
attaching 25
to 25
them 25
a 25
sense 25
and 25
a 25
supposititious 25
signification 25
because 25
we 25
have 25
always 25
experience 25
at 25
hand 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
their 25
objective 25
reality 25

exist 25

usurped 25
conceptions 25

as 25
fortune 25
fate 25
which 25
circulate 25
with 25
almost 25
universal 25
indulgence 25
and 25
yet 25
are 25
occasionally 25
challenged 25
by 25
the 25
question 25
quid 25
juris 25
in 25
such 25
cases 25
we 25
have 25
great 25
difficulty 25
in 25
discovering 25
any 25
deduction 25
for 25
these 25
terms 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
we 25
cannot 25
produce 25
any 25
manifest 25
ground 25
of 25
right 25
either 25
from 25

from 25

on 25
which 25
the 25
claim 25

them 25
can 25
be 25
founded 25
among 25
the 25
many 25
conceptions 25
which 25

very 25
variegated 25

and 25
their 25
title 25

be 25
so 25
employed 25
always 25
requires 25
a 25
deduction 25

as 25
to 25
justify 25
such 25
use 25
of 25
them 25
proofs 25
from 25
experience 25
are 25
not 25
sufficient 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
know 25
how 25
these 25
conceptions 25
can 25
apply 25
to 25
objects 25
without 25
being 25
derived 25

therefore 25
an 25
examination 25

manner 25

conceptions 25
can 25
apply 25

priori 25
to 25
objects 25
the 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
i 25
distinguish 25
it 25
from 25
the 25
empirical 25
deduction 25
which 25
indicates 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
conception 25
is 25
obtained 25
through 25
experience 25
and 25
reflection 25
thereon 25
consequently 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
itself 25
with 25
the 25
right 25
but 25
only 25
with 25
the 25
fact 25
of 25
our 25
obtaining 25
conceptions 25
in 25
such 25
and 25
such 25
a 25
manner 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
seen 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
two 25
perfectly 25
different 25
kinds 25
of 25
conceptions 25
which 25
nevertheless 25
agree 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
in 25
this 25
that 25
they 25
both 25
apply 25
to 25
objects 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
these 25
are 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
as 25
forms 25
of 25
sensibility 25
and 25
the 25
categories 25
as 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
to 25
attempt 25
an 25
empirical 25
deduction 25
of 25
either 25
of 25
these 25
classes 25
would 25
be 25
labour 25
in 25
vain 25
because 25
the 25
distinguishing 25
characteristic 25
of 25
their 25
nature 25
consists 25
in 25
this 25
that 25
they 25
apply 25
to 25
their 25
objects 25
without 25
having 25
borrowed 25
anything 25
from 25
experience 25
towards 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
them 25
consequently 25
if 25
a 25
deduction 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
is 25
necessary 25
it 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
transcendental 25
meanwhile 25
with 25
respect 25
to 25
these 25
conceptions 25
as 25
with 25
respect 25
to 25
all 25
our 25
cognition 25
we 25
certainly 25
may 25
discover 25
in 25
experience 25
if 25
not 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
their 25
possibility 25
yet 25
the 25
occasioning 25
causes 25
of 25
their 25
production 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
found 25
that 25
the 25
impressions 25
of 25
sense 25
give 25
the 25
first 25
occasion 25
for 25
bringing 25
into 25
action 25
the 25
whole 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
and 25
for 25
the 25
production 25
of 25
experience 25
which 25
contains 25
two 25
very 25
dissimilar 25
elements 25
namely 25
a 25
matter 25
for 25
cognition 25
given 25
by 25
the 25
senses 25
and 25
a 25
certain 25
form 25
for 25
the 25
arrangement 25
of 25
this 25
matter 25
arising 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
inner 25
fountain 25
of 25
pure 25
intuition 25
and 25
thought 25
and 25
these 25
on 25
occasion 25
given 25
by 25
sensuous 25
impressions 25
are 25
called 25
into 25
exercise 25
and 25
produce 25
conceptions 25
such 25
an 25
investigation 25
into 25
the 25
first 25
efforts 25
of 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
to 25
mount 25
from 25
particular 25
perceptions 25
to 25
general 25
conceptions 25
is 25
undoubtedly 25
of 25
great 25
utility 25
and 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
thank 25
the 25
celebrated 25
locke 25
for 25
having 25
first 25
opened 25
the 25
way 25
for 25
this 25
inquiry 25
but 25
a 25

pure 25

the 25
pure 25
and 25
legitimate 25
origin 25
of 25

the 25
use 25
of 25
the 25

extends 25
only 25

therefore 25
all 25
geometrical 25
cognition 25

it 25
is 25
founded 25
upon 25
a 25

immediate 25

with 25
the 25

the 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
of 25
seeking 25
a 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
not 25
only 25
of 25
these 25

themselves 25

likewise 25
of 25

because 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
make 25
affirmations 25
concerning 25

not 25
by 25

of 25
the 25

that 25
even 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25

is 25
rendered 25
equivocal 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
we 25
are 25
very 25
ready 25
with 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
to 25
carry 25
the 25

of 25
sensuous 25
intuitionand 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
found 25
a 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
of 25
it 25
needful 25
the 25
reader 25
then 25
must 25
be 25
quite 25
convinced 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
before 25
taking 25
a 25
single 25
step 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
because 25
otherwise 25
he 25
goes 25
to 25
work 25
blindly 25
and 25
after 25
he 25
has 25
wondered 25
about 25
in 25
all 25
directions 25
returns 25
to 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
utter 25
ignorance 25
from 25
which 25
he 25
started 25
he 25
ought 25
moreover 25
clearly 25
to 25
recognize 25
beforehand 25
the 25
unavoidable 25
difficulties 25
in 25
his 25
undertaking 25
so 25
that 25
he 25
may 25
not 25
afterwards 25
complain 25
of 25
the 25
obscurity 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
subject 25
itself 25
is 25
deeply 25
involved 25

too 25
soon 25
impatient 25
of 25
the 25
obstacles 25
in 25
his 25
path 25
because 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
choice 25
of 25
only 25
two 25
thingseither 25
at 25
once 25
to 25

up 25

beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25

to 25
bring 25
this 25
critical 25
investigation 25
to 25
completion 25
we 25
have 25
been 25
able 25
with 25
very 25
little 25
trouble 25
to 25
make 25
it 25
comprehensible 25
how 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
although 25
a 25
priori 25
cognitions 25
must 25
necessarily 25
apply 25
to 25
external 25
objects 25

render 25
a 25
synthetical 25
cognition 25
of 25
these 25
possible 25
independently 25
of 25
all 25

only 25
by 25

of 25
such 25
pure 25
form 25
of 25
sensibility 25
an 25
object 25
can 25
appear 25
to 25
us 25
that 25

an 25
object 25

empirical 25

are 25
pure 25
intuitions 25
which 25
contain 25
a 25

the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
objects 25
as 25
phenomena 25

an 25

objective 25
validity 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
categories 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25

not 25
represent 25
the 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
objects 25
are 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
in 25
intuition 25
objects 25

consequently 25
appear 25
to 25
us 25
without 25
necessarily 25
connecting 25
themselves 25
with 25
these 25
and 25
consequently 25
without 25
any 25
necessity 25
binding 25
on 25

to 25
contain 25
a 25

the 25
conditions 25
of 25
these 25
objects 25
thus 25
we 25
find 25
ourselves 25
involved 25
in 25
a 25
difficulty 25
which 25
did 25
not 25
present 25
itself 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
sensibility 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
cannot 25
discover 25
how 25
the 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
of 25
thought 25
can 25
have 25
objective 25
validity 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
can 25
become 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
all 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
for 25
phenomena 25
may 25
certainly 25
be 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
in 25
intuition 25
without 25
any 25
help 25
from 25
the 25
functions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
let 25
us 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
which 25
indicates 25
a 25
peculiar 25
kind 25
of 25
synthesis 25
namely 25
that 25
with 25
something 25
a 25
something 25
entirely 25
different 25
b 25
is 25
connected 25
according 25
to 25
a 25
law 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
priori 25
manifest 25
why 25
phenomena 25
should 25
contain 25
anything 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
we 25
are 25
of 25
course 25
debarred 25
from 25
appealing 25
for 25
proof 25
to 25
experience 25
for 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
must 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
it 25
hence 25
remains 25
doubtful 25
a 25
priori 25
whether 25
such 25
a 25
conception 25
be 25
not 25
quite 25
void 25
and 25
without 25
any 25
corresponding 25
object 25
among 25
phenomena 25
for 25
that 25
objects 25
of 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
must 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensibility 25
existing 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
is 25
quite 25
evident 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
without 25
these 25
they 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
objects 25
for 25
us 25
but 25
that 25
they 25
must 25
also 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
conditions 25
which 25
understanding 25
requires 25
for 25
the 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
of 25
thought 25
is 25
an 25
assertion 25
the 25
grounds 25
for 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
so 25
easily 25
to 25
be 25
discovered 25
for 25
phenomena 25
might 25
be 25
so 25
constituted 25
as 25
not 25
to 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
thought 25
and 25
all 25
things 25
might 25
lie 25
in 25
such 25
confusion 25
that 25
for 25
example 25
nothing 25
could 25
be 25
met 25
with 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
phenomena 25
to 25
suggest 25
a 25
law 25
of 25
synthesis 25
and 25
so 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
so 25
that 25
this 25
conception 25
would 25
be 25
quite 25
void 25
null 25
and 25
without 25
significance 25
phenomena 25
would 25
nevertheless 25
continue 25
to 25
present 25
objects 25
to 25
our 25
intuition 25
for 25
mere 25
intuition 25
does 25
not 25
in 25
any 25
respect 25
stand 25
in 25
need 25
of 25
the 25
functions 25
of 25
thought 25
if 25
we 25
thought 25
to 25
free 25
ourselves 25
from 25
the 25
labour 25
of 25
these 25
investigations 25
by 25
saying 25
experience 25
is 25
constantly 25
offering 25
us 25
examples 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
in 25
phenomena 25
and 25
presents 25
us 25
with 25
abundant 25
opportunity 25
of 25
abstracting 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
so 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
of 25
corroborating 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
we 25
should 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
be 25
overlooking 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
cannot 25
arise 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
at 25
all 25
that 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
it 25
must 25
either 25
have 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
basis 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
or 25
be 25
rejected 25
as 25
a 25
mere 25
chimera 25
for 25
this 25
conception 25
demands 25
that 25
something 25
a 25
should 25
be 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
nature 25
that 25
something 25
else 25
b 25
should 25
follow 25
from 25
it 25
necessarily 25

according 25
to 25
an 25
absolutely 25
universal 25
law 25
we 25
may 25
certainly 25
collect 25
from 25
phenomena 25
a 25
law 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
usually 25
happens 25
but 25
the 25
element 25
of 25
necessity 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
it 25
hence 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
to 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
belongs 25
a 25
dignity 25
which 25
is 25
utterly 25
wanting 25
in 25
any 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
no 25
mere 25
mechanical 25
synthesis 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
addition 25
but 25
a 25
dynamical 25
one 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
effect 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
cogitated 25
as 25
merely 25
annexed 25
to 25
the 25
cause 25
but 25
as 25
posited 25
by 25
and 25
through 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
resulting 25
from 25
it 25
the 25
strict 25
universality 25
of 25
this 25
law 25
never 25
can 25
be 25
a 25
characteristic 25
of 25
empirical 25
laws 25
which 25
obtain 25
through 25
induction 25
only 25
a 25
comparative 25
universality 25
that 25
is 25
an 25
extended 25
range 25
of 25
practical 25
application 25
but 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
would 25
entirely 25
lose 25
all 25
their 25
peculiar 25
character 25
if 25
we 25
treated 25
them 25
merely 25
as 25
the 25
productions 25
of 25
experience 25
ss 25
transition 25
to 25
the 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
there 25
are 25
only 25
two 25
possible 25
ways 25
in 25
which 25
synthetical 25
representation 25
and 25
its 25
objects 25
can 25
coincide 25
with 25
and 25
relate 25
necessarily 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
as 25
it 25
were 25

together 25
either 25
the 25
object 25
alone 25

the 25
former 25
case 25
the 25
relation 25

only 25
empirical 25

determinative 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
representation 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
cognize 25
anything 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
now 25
there 25
are 25
only 25
two 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
firstly 25
intuition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
object 25
though 25
only 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
is 25
given 25
secondly 25
conception 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
object 25
which 25
corresponds 25
to 25
this 25
intuition 25
is 25
thought 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
from 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
on 25
aesthetic 25
that 25
the 25
first 25
condition 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
objects 25
can 25
be 25
intuited 25
must 25
in 25
fact 25
exist 25
as 25
a 25
formal 25
basis 25
for 25
them 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
with 25
this 25
formal 25
condition 25
of 25
sensibility 25
therefore 25
all 25
phenomena 25
necessarily 25
correspond 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
through 25
it 25
that 25
they 25
can 25
be 25
phenomena 25
at 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
can 25
be 25
empirically 25
intuited 25
and 25
given 25
now 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
whether 25
there 25
do 25
not 25
exist 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
conceptions 25
of 25
understanding 25
also 25
as 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
something 25
if 25
not 25
intuited 25
is 25
yet 25
thought 25
as 25
object 25
if 25
this 25
question 25
be 25
answered 25
in 25
the 25
affirmative 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
all 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
is 25
necessarily 25
conformable 25
to 25
such 25
conceptions 25
since 25
if 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
presupposed 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
that 25
anything 25
can 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
now 25
all 25
experience 25
contains 25
besides 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
senses 25
through 25
which 25
an 25
object 25
is 25
given 25
a 25
conception 25
also 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
intuition 25
accordingly 25
conceptions 25
of 25
objects 25
in 25
general 25
must 25
lie 25
as 25
a 25
priori 25
conditions 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
all 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
as 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
will 25
rest 25
upon 25
this 25
that 25
experience 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
thought 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
by 25
their 25
means 25
for 25
in 25
that 25
case 25
they 25
apply 25
necessarily 25
and 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
because 25
only 25
through 25
them 25
can 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
be 25
thought 25
the 25
whole 25
aim 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
of 25
all 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
is 25
to 25
show 25
that 25
these 25
conceptions 25
are 25
a 25
priori 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
all 25

which 25
afford 25
us 25
the 25

foundation 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
are 25
for 25
that 25
very 25
reason 25
necessary 25
but 25
the 25
analysis 25
of 25
the 25
experiences 25
in 25
which 25
they 25
are 25
met 25
with 25
is 25
not 25
deduction 25
but 25
only 25
an 25
illustration 25
of 25
them 25
because 25
from 25
experience 25
they 25
could 25
never 25
derive 25
the 25
attribute 25
of 25
necessity 25
without 25
their 25
original 25
applicability 25
and 25
relation 25
to 25
all 25
possible 25
experience 25
in 25
which 25
all 25
objects 25

on 25

pure 25
conceptions 25

david 25
hume 25
perceived 25
that 25
to 25
render 25
this 25
possible 25
it 25
was 25
necessary 25
that 25
the 25
conceptions 25
should 25
have 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
origin 25
but 25
as 25
he 25
could 25
not 25
explain 25
how 25
it 25
was 25
possible 25
that 25
conceptions 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
connected 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
must 25
nevertheless 25
be 25
thought 25
as 25
necessarily 25
connected 25
in 25
the 25
objectand 25
it 25
never 25
occurred 25
to 25
him 25
that 25
the 25
understanding 25
itself 25
might 25
perhaps 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
be 25
the 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
experience 25
in 25
which 25
its 25
objects 25
were 25
presented 25
to 25
ithe 25
was 25
forced 25
to 25
drive 25
these 25
conceptions 25
from 25
experience 25
that 25
is 25
from 25
a 25
subjective 25
necessity 25
arising 25
from 25
repeated 25
association 25
of 25
experiences 25
erroneously 25
considered 25
to 25
be 25
objective 25
in 25
one 25
word 25
from 25
habit 25
but 25
he 25
proceeded 25
with 25
perfect 25
consequence 25
and 25
declared 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
impossible 25
with 25
such 25
conceptions 25
and 25
the 25
principles 25
arising 25
from 25
them 25
to 25
overstep 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25

the 25
empirical 25
derivation 25
however 25
which 25
both 25
of 25
these 25
philosophers 25
attributed 25
to 25
these 25
conceptions 25
cannot 25
possibly 25
be 25
reconciled 25
with 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
we 25
do 25
possess 25
scientific 25
a 25

cognitions 25

those 25
of 25
pure 25

general 25
physics 25
the 25
former 25
of 25
these 25
two 25
celebrated 25
men 25
opened 25
a 25
wide 25
door 25
to 25
extravagancefor 25
if 25
reason 25
has 25
once 25
undoubted 25
right 25
on 25
its 25
side 25
it 25

not 25

limits 25
by 25
vague 25
recommendations 25
of 25
moderation 25
the 25
latter 25
gave 25
himself 25
up 25
entirely 25
to 25
scepticisma 25
natural 25
consequence 25
after 25
having 25
discovered 25
as 25
he 25
thought 25
that 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
was 25
not 25
trustworthy 25
we 25
now 25
intend 25
to 25
make 25
a 25
trial 25
whether 25
it 25
be 25
not 25
possible 25
safely 25
to 25
conduct 25

these 25
two 25
rocks 25
to 25
assign 25
her 25
determinate 25

yet 25
leave 25
open 25
for 25
her 25
the 25
entire 25
sphere 25
of 25
her 25
legitimate 25
activity 25
i 25
shall 25
merely 25
premise 25
an 25
explanation 25
of 25
what 25
the 25
categories 25
are 25
they 25
are 25
conceptions 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
general 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
its 25
intuition 25
is 25
contemplated 25
as 25
determined 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
logical 25
functions 25
of 25
judgement 25
the 25
following 25
will 25
make 25
this 25
plain 25
the 25
function 25
of 25
the 25
categorical 25
judgement 25
is 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
subject 25
to 25
predicate 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
the 25
proposition 25
all 25
bodies 25
are 25
divisible 25
but 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
merely 25
logical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
it 25
still 25
remains 25
undetermined 25
to 25
which 25
of 25
these 25
two 25
conceptions 25
belongs 25
the 25
function 25
of 25
subject 25
and 25
to 25
which 25
that 25
of 25
predicate 25
for 25
we 25
could 25
also 25
say 25
some 25
divisible 25
is 25
a 25
body 25
but 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
substance 25
when 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
is 25
brought 25
under 25
it 25
determines 25
that 25
and 25
its 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
in 25

nevertheless 25
always 25
presuppose 25

the 25
conception 25

thus 25
the 25

one 25
thing 25
in 25
the 25
above 25
demonstration 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
make 25
abstraction 25
namely 25
that 25
the 25
manifold 25
to 25
be 25
intuited 25
must 25
be 25
given 25
previously 25
to 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
independently 25
of 25
it 25
how 25
this 25
takes 25
place 25
remains 25
here 25
undetermined 25
for 25
if 25
i 25
cogitate 25
an 25
understanding 25
which 25
was 25
itself 25
intuitive 25
as 25
for 25
example 25
a 25
divine 25
understanding 25
which 25
should 25
not 25
represent 25
given 25
objects 25
but 25
by 25
whose 25
representation 25
the 25
objects 25
themselves 25
should 25
be 25
given 25
or 25
produced 25
the 25
categories 25
would 25
possess 25
no 25
significance 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
they 25
are 25
merely 25
rules 25
for 25
an 25
understanding 25
whose 25
whole 25
power 25
consists 25
in 25
thought 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
act 25
of 25
submitting 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
which 25
is 25
presented 25
to 25
it 25
in 25
intuition 25
from 25
a 25
very 25
different 25
quarter 25
to 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
apperception 25
a 25
faculty 25
therefore 25
which 25
cognizes 25
nothing 25
per 25
se 25
but 25
only 25
connects 25
and 25
arranges 25
the 25
material 25
of 25
cognition 25
the 25
intuition 25
namely 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
presented 25
to 25
it 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
but 25
to 25
show 25
reasons 25
for 25
this 25
peculiar 25
character 25
of 25
our 25
understandings 25
that 25
it 25
produces 25
unity 25

a 25
certain 25

number 25
thereof 25
is 25
as 25
impossible 25
as 25
to 25
explain 25
why 25
we 25

precisely 25
so 25
many 25

are 25
two 25
elements 25
firstly 25
the 25
conception 25

an 25

cogitated 25
the 25

secondly 25
the 25
intuition 25
whereby 25
the 25
object 25

given 25
for 25

the 25
conception 25

not 25
be 25

would 25
still 25
be 25
a 25
thought 25
as 25

its 25
form 25
but 25
without 25
any 25
object 25

no 25
cognition 25

our 25

a 25

it 25

no 25
proper 25
knowledge 25

i 25
merely 25
indicate 25
what 25

what 25

contained 25
in 25
it 25
for 25
i 25
have 25
not 25
shown 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
which 25
my 25
pure 25
conception 25

could 25
be 25
applicable 25

i 25

able 25
to 25
furnish 25
any 25
intuition 25
corresponding 25
to 25
it 25

am 25
only 25
able 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
our 25
intuition 25
is 25
not 25
valid 25
for 25
it 25
but 25
the 25
most 25
important 25
point 25
is 25
this 25
that 25

a 25
something 25
of 25

kind 25

for 25
example 25
the 25
conception 25

substance 25

something 25

never 25
as 25
mere 25
predicate 25
in 25
regard 25

this 25
conception 25

am 25
quite 25
ignorant 25
whether 25
there 25
can 25
really 25
be 25
anything 25
to 25
correspond 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
determination 25

clearly 25
proved 25
by 25
the 25
consideration 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
represent 25

not 25
an 25

way 25

under 25
the 25
image 25
of 25
a 25
line 25
which 25
we 25
draw 25
in 25
thought 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
representation 25
without 25
which 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
cognize 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
its 25
dimension 25
and 25
also 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
necessitated 25
to 25
take 25
our 25
determination 25
of 25
periods 25
of 25
time 25
or 25
of 25
points 25

all 25
our 25
internal 25

from 25
the 25
changes 25
which 25
we 25
perceive 25
in 25
outward 25
things 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
arrange 25
the 25
determinations 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25

phenomena 25

arrange 25
those 25

external 25
senses 25
in 25
space 25

we 25
grant 25
respecting 25
this 25
latter 25

by 25

of 25
them 25

only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
are 25
affected 25
externally 25
we 25
must 25
also 25
confess 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
that 25
by 25

not 25

this 25

this 25
is 25
asserted 25

the 25
pure 25

unquestionably 25
elements 25

exist 25
in 25
the 25

there 25
are 25
only 25
two 25

a 25

harmony 25
of 25

therefore 25
independent 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
assertion 25

them 25
a 25

nothing 25
remains 25

to 25
adopt 25
the 25
second 25

were 25
of 25

that 25
on 25
the 25
part 25

the 25
understanding 25
the 25
categories 25
do 25
contain 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25

all 25

with 25
respect 25

the 25
questions 25
how 25
they 25
make 25

what 25
are 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25

thereof 25
with 25

inform 25
the 25

it 25
is 25
quite 25

pure 25
reasona 25
middle 25

a 25

derived 25
from 25

are 25
merely 25
subjective 25
aptitudes 25

thought 25
implanted 25
in 25
us 25
contemporaneously 25
with 25
our 25
existence 25
which 25
were 25
so 25
ordered 25
and 25
disposed 25
by 25
our 25
creator 25
that 25
their 25
exercise 25
perfectly 25
harmonizes 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25

that 25
with 25
such 25
an 25
hypothesis 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
say 25
at 25
what 25
point 25
we 25
must 25
stop 25
in 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
predetermined 25
aptitudes 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
categories 25
would 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
entirely 25
lose 25
that 25
character 25
of 25
necessity 25
which 25
is 25
essentially 25
involved 25
in 25
the 25
very 25
conception 25
of 25
them 25
is 25
a 25
conclusive 25
objection 25
to 25
it 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
for 25
example 25
which 25
expresses 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
an 25
effect 25
under 25
a 25
presupposed 25
condition 25
would 25
be 25
false 25
if 25
it 25
rested 25
only 25
upon 25
such 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
subjective 25
necessity 25
of 25
uniting 25
certain 25
empirical 25
representations 25
according 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
rule 25
of 25
relation 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
then 25
saythe 25
effect 25
is 25
connected 25
with 25
its 25
cause 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
necessarily 25
but 25
only 25
i 25
am 25
so 25
constituted 25
that 25
i 25
can 25
think 25
this 25
representation 25
as 25
so 25
connected 25
and 25
not 25
otherwise 25
now 25
this 25
is 25
just 25
what 25
the 25
sceptic 25
wants 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
all 25
our 25
knowledge 25
depending 25
on 25
the 25
supposed 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
our 25
judgement 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
mere 25
illusion 25
nor 25
would 25
there 25
be 25
wanting 25
people 25
who 25
would 25
deny 25
any 25
such 25
subjective 25
necessity 25
in 25
respect 25
to 25
themselves 25
though 25
they 25
must 25
feel 25
it 25
at 25
all 25
events 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
dispute 25
with 25
any 25
one 25
on 25
that 25
which 25
merely 25
depends 25
on 25

his 25

up 25

this 25
science 25
accordingly 25
treats 25
in 25
its 25
analytic 25
of 25

itself 25

be 25
discovered 25

introduction 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
faculty 25
of 25

be 25
defined 25
as 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
laws 25
or 25
rules 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
may 25
be 25
termed 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
subsumption 25
under 25
these 25
rules 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
distinguishing 25
whether 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
does 25
or 25
does 25
not 25
stand 25
under 25
a 25
given 25
rule 25
casus 25
datae 25
legis 25
general 25
logic 25
contains 25
no 25
directions 25
or 25
precepts 25
for 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
nor 25
can 25
it 25
contain 25
any 25
such 25
for 25
as 25
it 25
makes 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
content 25
of 25
cognition 25
no 25
duty 25
is 25
left 25
for 25
it 25
except 25
that 25
of 25
exposing 25
analytically 25
the 25
mere 25
form 25
of 25
cognition 25
in 25
conceptions 25
judgements 25
and 25
conclusions 25
and 25
of 25
thereby 25
establishing 25
formal 25
rules 25
for 25
all 25
exercise 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
now 25
if 25
this 25
logic 25
wished 25
to 25
give 25
some 25
general 25
direction 25
how 25
we 25
should 25
subsume 25
under 25
these 25
rules 25
that 25
is 25
how 25
we 25
should 25
distinguish 25
whether 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
did 25
or 25
did 25
not 25
stand 25
under 25
them 25
this 25
again 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
done 25
otherwise 25
than 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
a 25
rule 25
but 25
this 25
rule 25
precisely 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
rule 25
requires 25
for 25
itself 25
direction 25
from 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
the 25
understanding 25
is 25
capable 25
of 25
being 25
instructed 25
by 25
rules 25
but 25
that 25
the 25
judgement 25
is 25
a 25
peculiar 25
talent 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
and 25
cannot 25
require 25
tuition 25
but 25
only 25
exercise 25
this 25
faculty 25
is 25
therefore 25
the 25
specific 25
quality 25
of 25
the 25
socalled 25
mother 25
wit 25
the 25
want 25
of 25
which 25
no 25
scholastic 25
discipline 25
can 25
compensate 25
for 25
although 25
education 25
may 25
furnish 25
and 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
engraft 25
upon 25
a 25
limited 25
understanding 25
rules 25
borrowed 25
from 25
other 25
minds 25
yet 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
employing 25
these 25
rules 25
correctly 25
must 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
pupil 25
himself 25
and 25
no 25
rule 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
prescribe 25
to 25
him 25
with 25
this 25
purpose 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25
or 25
deficiency 25
of 25
this 25
gift 25
of 25
nature 25
secure 25
from 25
misuse 25
a 25
physician 25
therefore 25
a 25
judge 25
or 25
a 25
statesman 25
may 25
have 25
in 25
his 25
head 25
many 25
admirable 25
pathological 25
juridical 25
or 25
political 25
rules 25
in 25
a 25
degree 25
that 25
may 25
enable 25
him 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
profound 25
teacher 25
in 25
his 25
particular 25
science 25
and 25
yet 25
in 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
these 25
rules 25
he 25
may 25
very 25
possibly 25
blundereither 25
because 25
he 25
is 25
wanting 25
in 25
natural 25
judgement 25
though 25
not 25
in 25
understanding 25
and 25
whilst 25
he 25
can 25
comprehend 25
the 25
general 25
in 25
abstracto 25
cannot 25
distinguish 25
whether 25
a 25
particular 25
case 25
in 25
concreto 25
ought 25
to 25
rank 25
under 25
the 25
former 25
or 25
because 25
his 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
has 25
not 25
been 25
sufficiently 25
exercised 25
by 25
examples 25
and 25
real 25
practice 25
indeed 25
the 25
grand 25
and 25
only 25
use 25
of 25
examples 25
is 25
to 25
sharpen 25
the 25
judgement 25
for 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
correctness 25
and 25
precision 25
of 25
the 25
insight 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
examples 25
are 25
commonly 25
injurious 25
rather 25
than 25
otherwise 25
because 25
as 25
casus 25
in 25
terminis 25
they 25
seldom 25
adequately 25
fulfil 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
rule 25
besides 25
they 25
often 25
weaken 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
our 25
understanding 25
to 25
apprehend 25
rules 25
or 25
laws 25
in 25
their 25
universality 25
independently 25
of 25
particular 25
circumstances 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
hence 25
accustom 25
us 25
to 25
employ 25
them 25
more 25
as 25
formulae 25
than 25
as 25
principles 25
examples 25
are 25
thus 25
the 25
gocart 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
which 25
he 25
who 25
is 25
naturally 25
deficient 25
in 25
that 25
faculty 25
cannot 25
afford 25
to 25
dispense 25
with 25
footnote 25
deficiency 25
in 25
judgement 25
is 25
properly 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
called 25
stupidity 25
and 25
for 25
such 25
a 25
failing 25
we 25
know 25
no 25
remedy 25
a 25
dull 25
or 25
narrowminded 25
person 25
to 25
whom 25
nothing 25
is 25
wanting 25
but 25
a 25
proper 25
degree 25
of 25
understanding 25
may 25
be 25
improved 25
by 25
tuition 25
even 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
to 25
deserve 25
the 25
epithet 25
of 25
learned 25
but 25
as 25
such 25
persons 25
frequently 25
labour 25
under 25
a 25
deficiency 25
in 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
uncommon 25
to 25
find 25
men 25
extremely 25
learned 25
who 25
in 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
their 25
science 25
betray 25
a 25
lamentable 25
degree 25
this 25
irremediable 25
want 25
but 25
although 25
general 25
logic 25
cannot 25
give 25
directions 25
to 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
the 25
case 25
is 25
very 25
different 25
as 25
regards 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
insomuch 25
that 25
it 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
especial 25
duty 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
to 25
secure 25
and 25
direct 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
determinate 25
rules 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
in 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
for 25
as 25
a 25
doctrine 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
an 25
endeavour 25
to 25
enlarge 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
cognitions 25
philosophy 25
is 25
worse 25
than 25
useless 25
since 25
from 25
all 25
the 25
attempts 25
hitherto 25
made 25
little 25
or 25
no 25
ground 25
has 25
been 25
gained 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
critique 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
guard 25
against 25
the 25
mistakes 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
lapsus 25
judicii 25
in 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
few 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
we 25
possess 25
although 25
its 25
use 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
purely 25
negative 25
philosophy 25
is 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
apply 25
all 25
its 25
acuteness 25
and 25
penetration 25
but 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
has 25
this 25
peculiarity 25
that 25
besides 25
indicating 25
the 25
rule 25
or 25
rather 25
the 25
general 25
condition 25
for 25
rules 25
which 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
it 25
can 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
indicate 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
case 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
rule 25
must 25
be 25
applied 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
superiority 25
which 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
possesses 25
above 25
all 25
other 25
sciences 25
except 25
mathematics 25
lies 25
in 25
this 25
it 25
treats 25
of 25
conceptions 25
which 25
must 25
relate 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
their 25
objects 25
whose 25
objective 25
validity 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
a 25
posteriori 25
and 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
under 25
the 25
obligation 25
of 25
presenting 25
in 25
general 25

sufficient 25
tests 25

in 25
harmony 25

the 25
second 25
will 25

hesitate 25
as 25
to 25
the 25

the 25

these 25

also 25

in 25
other 25
words 25
whether 25
the 25

a 25
possible 25

relate 25
a 25

solely 25

whether 25

as 25
things 25

for 25
we 25
have 25
there 25
seen 25
that 25
conceptions 25
are 25
quite 25
impossible 25
and 25
utterly 25
without 25
signification 25
unless 25
either 25
to 25
them 25
or 25
at 25
least 25

the 25
elements 25
of 25
which 25
they 25
consist 25
an 25
object 25
be 25
given 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
they 25
cannot 25
possibly 25
apply 25
to 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
without 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
whether 25
and 25
how 25
these 25
may 25
be 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
and 25
further 25
that 25
the 25
only 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
objects 25
can 25
be 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
is 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
modification 25
of 25
our 25
sensibility 25

finally 25
that 25
pure 25

to 25
the 25
function 25
of 25
the 25

in 25
the 25

must 25
contain 25

formal 25
conditions 25

alone 25
the 25

be 25
applied 25
to 25
any 25
object 25
this 25
formal 25
and 25
pure 25
condition 25
of 25
sensibility 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
is 25
restricted 25
in 25
its 25
employment 25
we 25
shall 25
name 25
the 25
schema 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
with 25
these 25
schemata 25
we 25
shall 25
call 25
the 25
schematism 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25

the 25

is 25
in 25
itself 25
always 25
a 25
mere 25
product 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
but 25
as 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
imagination 25
has 25
for 25
its 25
aim 25
no 25
single 25
intuition 25
but 25
merely 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
sensibility 25
the 25
schema 25
is 25
clearly 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
the 25
image 25
thus 25
if 25
i 25
place 25
five 25
points 25
one 25
after 25
another 25
this 25
is 25
an 25
image 25
of 25
the 25
number 25
five 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
if 25
i 25
only 25
think 25
a 25
number 25
in 25
general 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
either 25
five 25
or 25
a 25
hundred 25
this 25
thought 25
is 25
rather 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
method 25
of 25
representing 25
in 25
an 25
image 25
a 25
sum 25
eg 25
a 25
thousand 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
conception 25
than 25
the 25
image 25
itself 25
an 25
image 25
which 25
i 25
should 25
find 25
some 25
little 25
difficulty 25
in 25
reviewing 25
and 25
comparing 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
now 25
this 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
general 25
procedure 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
to 25
present 25
its 25
image 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
i 25
call 25
the 25
schema 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
in 25
truth 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
images 25
of 25
objects 25

schemata 25
which 25
lie 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
our 25
pure 25
sensuous 25
conceptions 25
no 25
image 25
could 25
ever 25
be 25
adequate 25
to 25
our 25
conception 25

a 25

the 25

never 25

the 25

the 25

it 25

how 25
the 25

therefore 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
a 25

determinations 25

finally 25
to 25
the 25
complex 25
or 25
totality 25
in 25
time 25
hence 25
it 25
is 25
apparent 25
that 25
the 25
schematism 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
amounts 25
to 25
nothing 25
else 25
than 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
intuition 25
in 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
and 25
thus 25
indirectly 25
to 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
apperception 25
as 25
a 25
function 25
corresponding 25
to 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
a 25
receptivity 25
thus 25
the 25
schemata 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
are 25
the 25
true 25
and 25
only 25
conditions 25
whereby 25
our 25
understanding 25
receives 25
an 25
application 25
to 25
objects 25
and 25
consequently 25
significance 25
finally 25
therefore 25
the 25
categories 25
are 25
only 25
capable 25
of 25
empirical 25
use 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
serve 25
merely 25
to 25
subject 25
phenomena 25
to 25
the 25
universal 25
rules 25
of 25
synthesis 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
necessary 25
unity 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
the 25
necessary 25
union 25
of 25
all 25
consciousness 25
in 25
one 25
original 25
apperception 25
and 25
so 25
to 25
render 25
them 25
susceptible 25
of 25
a 25
complete 25
connection 25
in 25
one 25
experience 25
but 25
within 25
this 25
whole 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
lie 25
all 25
our 25
cognitions 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
universal 25
relation 25
to 25
this 25
experience 25
consists 25
transcendental 25
truth 25
which 25
antecedes 25
all 25
empirical 25
truth 25
and 25
renders 25
the 25
latter 25
possible 25
it 25
is 25
however 25
evident 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
that 25
although 25
the 25
schemata 25
of 25
sensibility 25
are 25
the 25
sole 25
agents 25
in 25
realizing 25
the 25
categories 25
they 25
do 25
nevertheless 25
also 25
restrict 25
them 25
that 25
is 25
they 25
limit 25
the 25
categories 25
by 25
conditions 25
which 25
lie 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
understanding 25
namely 25
in 25
sensibility 25
hence 25
the 25
schema 25
is 25
properly 25
only 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
or 25
the 25
sensuous 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25

now 25
if 25
we 25
remove 25
a 25
restrictive 25
condition 25
we 25
thereby 25
amplify 25
it 25
appears 25
the 25
formerly 25
limited 25
conception 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
the 25
categories 25
in 25
their 25
pure 25
signification 25
free 25
from 25
all 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensibility 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
valid 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
the 25
schemata 25
represent 25
them 25
merely 25
as 25
they 25
appear 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
categories 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
significance 25
far 25
more 25
extended 25
and 25
wholly 25
independent 25
of 25
all 25
schemata 25
in 25
truth 25
there 25
does 25
always 25
remain 25
to 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
after 25
abstracting 25
every 25
sensuous 25

in 25
this 25
case 25
no 25

therefore 25
they 25

us 25
a 25

the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
in 25
the 25
foregoing 25
chapter 25
we 25
have 25
merely 25
considered 25
the 25
general 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
transcendental 25
faculty 25
of 25
judgement 25
is 25
justified 25
in 25
using 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
for 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
our 25
duty 25
at 25
present 25
is 25
to 25
exhibit 25
in 25
systematic 25
connection 25
those 25
judgements 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
really 25
produces 25
a 25
priori 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
our 25
table 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
will 25
certainly 25
afford 25
us 25
the 25
natural 25
and 25
safe 25
guidance 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
precisely 25
the 25
categories 25
whose 25
application 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
must 25
constitute 25
all 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
which 25
to 25
sensibility 25
will 25
on 25
that 25
very 25
account 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
a 25
complete 25
and 25
systematic 25
catalogue 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
transcendental 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
principles 25
a 25
priori 25
are 25
so 25
called 25
not 25
merely 25
because 25
they 25
contain 25
in 25
themselves 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
other 25
judgements 25
but 25
also 25
because 25
they 25
themselves 25
are 25
not 25
grounded 25
in 25
higher 25
and 25
more 25
general 25
cognitions 25
this 25
peculiarity 25
however 25
does 25
not 25
raise 25
them 25
altogether 25
above 25
the 25
need 25
of 25
a 25
proof 25
for 25
although 25
there 25
could 25
be 25
found 25
no 25
higher 25
cognition 25
and 25
therefore 25
no 25
objective 25
proof 25
and 25
although 25
such 25
a 25
principle 25
rather 25
serves 25
as 25
the 25
foundation 25
for 25
all 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
this 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
hinders 25
us 25
from 25
drawing 25
a 25
proof 25
from 25
the 25
subjective 25
sources 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
such 25
a 25
proof 25
is 25
necessary 25
moreover 25
because 25
without 25
it 25
the 25
principle 25
might 25
be 25
liable 25
to 25
the 25
imputation 25
of 25
being 25
a 25
mere 25
gratuitous 25
assertion 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
place 25
we 25
shall 25
limit 25
our 25
investigations 25
to 25
those 25
principles 25
which 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
categories 25
for 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
transcendental 25
aesthetic 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
are 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
as 25
also 25
the 25
restriction 25
of 25
these 25
principles 25
namely 25
that 25
they 25
cannot 25
be 25
applied 25
to 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselvesthese 25
of 25
course 25
do 25
not 25
fall 25
within 25
the 25
scope 25
of 25
our 25
present 25
inquiry 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
mathematical 25
science 25
form 25
no 25
part 25
of 25
this 25
system 25
because 25
they 25
are 25
all 25
drawn 25
from 25
intuition 25
and 25
not 25
from 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
these 25
principles 25
however 25
will 25
necessarily 25
be 25
considered 25
here 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25

not 25
indeed 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
proving 25
their 25
accuracy 25
and 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
which 25
is 25
unnecessary 25
but 25
merely 25
to 25
render 25
conceivable 25
and 25
deduce 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
evident 25

cognitions 25
but 25
we 25
shall 25
have 25
also 25
to 25
speak 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
analytical 25
judgements 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
proper 25
subject 25
of 25
our 25
inquiries 25
because 25
this 25
very 25
opposition 25
will 25
free 25
the 25
theory 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
from 25
all 25
ambiguity 25
and 25
place 25
it 25
clearly 25
before 25

there 25
may 25
exist 25
no 25

our 25
judgement 25

may 25
nevertheless 25
connect 25
conceptions 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
manner 25
that 25
they 25
do 25
not 25

can 25
also 25
however 25

positive 25
use 25

negative 25

truth 25

always 25
be 25
recognizable 25

the 25
principle 25
of 25
contradiction 25
for 25
the 25
contrary 25
of 25

conception 25
in 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
will 25
be 25
always 25
properly 25
negatived 25

the 25
conception 25
itself 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
affirmed 25

limit 25
its 25
application 25
merely 25
to 25
relations 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
consequently 25
a 25
formula 25
like 25
the 25
preceding 25
is 25
quite 25
foreign 25
to 25
its 25
true 25
purpose 25
the 25
misunderstanding 25
arises 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
we 25
first 25
of 25
all 25
separate 25
a 25
predicate 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
and 25
afterwards 25
connect 25
with 25
this 25
predicate 25
its 25
opposite 25
and 25
hence 25
do 25
not 25
establish 25
any 25
contradiction 25
with 25
the 25
subject 25
but 25
only 25
with 25
its 25
predicate 25
which 25
has 25
been 25
conjoined 25
with 25
the 25
subject 25
synthetically 25
a 25
contradiction 25
moreover 25
which 25
obtains 25
only 25
when 25
the 25
first 25
and 25
second 25
predicate 25
are 25
affirmed 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
if 25
i 25
say 25
a 25
man 25
who 25
is 25
ignorant 25
is 25
not 25
learned 25
the 25
condition 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
must 25
be 25
added 25
for 25
he 25
who 25
is 25
at 25
one 25
time 25
ignorant 25
may 25
at 25
another 25
be 25
learned 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
say 25
no 25
ignorant 25
man 25
is 25
a 25
learned 25
man 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
analytical 25
because 25
the 25
characteristic 25
ignorance 25
is 25
now 25
a 25
constituent 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
negative 25
proposition 25
is 25
evident 25
immediately 25
from 25
the 25
proposition 25
of 25
contradiction 25
without 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
adding 25
the 25
condition 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
reason 25
why 25

altered 25
the 25
formula 25
of 25

cognized 25
anything 25

those 25

relate 25

mediately 25

partly 25
on 25
the 25

the 25

of 25
the 25

only 25

they 25

not 25
possess 25
that 25

is 25
peculiar 25

the 25

lose 25
its 25

of 25
this 25
point 25
we 25
shall 25
be 25
better 25
able 25
to 25
judge 25
at 25
the 25
conclusion 25
of 25
this 25
system 25
of 25

the 25

is 25
naturally 25
our 25
guide 25
to 25
the 25
table 25
of 25
principles 25
because 25
these 25
are 25
nothing 25
else 25
than 25
rules 25
for 25
the 25
objective 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
accordingly 25
all 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25

are 25
axioms 25
of 25

these 25
appellations 25
i 25
have 25
chosen 25
advisedly 25
in 25
order 25
that 25
we 25
might 25
not 25
lose 25
sight 25
of 25
the 25
distinctions 25
in 25

of 25
the 25

and 25
the 25

of 25
these 25
principles 25
it 25
will 25
however 25
soon 25
appear 25
thata 25
fact 25
which 25
concerns 25
both 25
the 25
evidence 25
of 25
these 25

the 25

to 25
the 25
categories 25
of 25

and 25
quality 25
if 25
we 25
attend 25
merely 25
to 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
these 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
these 25
categories 25
are 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
others 25
in 25
as 25
much 25
as 25
the 25
former 25
are 25
possessed 25
of 25
an 25

but 25
the 25
latter 25

a 25

discursive 25
though 25
in 25
both 25
instances 25
a 25
complete 25
certitude 25
i 25
shall 25
therefore 25
call 25
the 25
former 25
mathematical 25
and 25
the 25
latter 25
dynamical 25
principles 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
observed 25
however 25
that 25
by 25
these 25
terms 25
i 25
mean 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
in 25
the 25
one 25

the 25
principles 25

those 25
of 25

in 25
the 25
other 25
i 25
have 25
here 25
in 25

merely 25
the 25

the 25

become 25
possible 25
accordingly 25
i 25
have 25
named 25
these 25

rather 25
with 25
reference 25
to 25
their 25
application 25
than 25
their 25

and 25
i 25
shall 25
now 25
proceed 25
to 25
consider 25
them 25
in 25

the 25

of 25
the 25

consequently 25
there 25
is 25
possible 25
a 25
synthesis 25
also 25
of 25
the 25
production 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
a 25

from 25
its 25
commencement 25
that 25
is 25
from 25
the 25
pure 25
intuition 25
onwards 25
up 25
to 25
a 25
certain 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
sensation 25
now 25
as 25
sensation 25
in 25
itself 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
objective 25
representation 25
and 25
in 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
neither 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
space 25
nor 25
of 25
time 25
it 25
cannot 25
possess 25
any 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
and 25
yet 25
there 25
does 25
belong 25
to 25
it 25
a 25
quantity 25
and 25
that 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
its 25
apprehension 25
in 25
which 25
empirical 25
consciousness 25
can 25
within 25
a 25
certain 25
time 25
rise 25
from 25
nothing 25
up 25
to 25
its 25
given 25
amount 25
consequently 25
an 25
intensive 25
quantity 25
and 25
thus 25
we 25
must 25
ascribe 25
intensive 25
quantity 25
that 25
is 25
a 25
degree 25
of 25
influence 25
on 25
sense 25
to 25
all 25
objects 25
of 25
perception 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
this 25
perception 25
contains 25
sensation 25
all 25
cognition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
enabled 25
to 25
cognize 25
and 25
determine 25
a 25
priori 25
what 25
belongs 25
to 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
an 25
anticipation 25
and 25
without 25
doubt 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
sense 25
in 25
which 25
epicurus 25
employed 25
his 25
expression 25
prholepsis 25
but 25
as 25
there 25
is 25
in 25
phenomena 25
something 25
which 25
is 25
never 25
cognized 25
a 25
priori 25
which 25
on 25
this 25
account 25
constitutes 25
the 25
proper 25
difference 25
between 25
pure 25
and 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
sensation 25
as 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
perception 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
sensation 25
is 25
just 25
that 25
element 25
in 25
cognition 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
at 25
all 25
anticipated 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
might 25
very 25
well 25
term 25
the 25
pure 25
determinations 25
in 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
as 25
well 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
figure 25
as 25
to 25
quantity 25
anticipations 25
of 25
phenomena 25
because 25
they 25
represent 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
which 25
may 25
always 25
be 25
given 25
a 25
posteriori 25
in 25
experience 25
but 25
suppose 25
that 25
in 25
every 25
sensation 25
as 25
sensation 25
in 25
general 25
without 25
any 25
particular 25
sensation 25
being 25
thought 25
of 25
there 25
existed 25
something 25
which 25
could 25
be 25
cognized 25
a 25
priori 25
this 25
would 25
deserve 25
to 25
be 25
called 25
anticipation 25
in 25
a 25
special 25
sensespecial 25
because 25
it 25
may 25
seem 25
surprising 25
to 25
forestall 25
experience 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
concerns 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
only 25
derive 25
from 25
itself 25
yet 25
such 25
really 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
here 25
apprehension 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
sensation 25
alone 25
fills 25
only 25
one 25
moment 25
that 25
is 25
if 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
take 25
into 25
consideration 25
a 25
succession 25
of 25
many 25
sensations 25
as 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
the 25
apprehension 25

advancing 25
from 25
parts 25
to 25
an 25
entire 25
representation 25
sensation 25
has 25
therefore 25
no 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
the 25
want 25
of 25
sensation 25
in 25
a 25
moment 25
of 25
time 25
would 25
represent 25
it 25
as 25
empty 25
consequently 25
that 25
which 25
in 25
the 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
corresponds 25
to 25
sensation 25

it 25
negation 25
now 25
every 25
sensation 25
is 25
capable 25
of 25
a 25
diminution 25
so 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
decrease 25
and 25
thus 25
gradually 25
disappear 25
therefore 25
between 25
reality 25
in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25

there 25
exists 25

from 25

smaller 25

in 25
a 25

has 25
always 25
a 25
quantity 25
which 25
however 25
is 25
not 25

not 25
progress 25
from 25

if 25
all 25

has 25
a 25

negation 25
there 25
is 25
an 25
endless 25
sequence 25

ever 25
smaller 25

if 25
nevertheless 25
every 25

no 25

either 25
immediately 25

ever 25
to 25
draw 25
from 25

a 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
empty 25

of 25
empty 25

for 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
an 25
entire 25
absence 25
of 25
reality 25
in 25
a 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
cannot 25
of 25

be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
perception 25
secondly 25
such 25

cannot 25
be 25
deduced 25
from 25
the 25
contemplation 25
of 25
any 25

the 25

nor 25
ought 25
it 25
ever 25
to 25

admitted 25
in 25

of 25
any 25

even 25
the 25

of 25
a 25

that 25
is 25
if 25
no 25
part 25
thereof 25
is 25
empty 25
yet 25
because 25
every 25
reality 25
has 25
its 25
degree 25
which 25
with 25
the 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
unchanged 25
can 25
diminish 25
through 25
endless 25

with 25
which 25

the 25
intensive 25
quantity 25
in 25
different 25
phenomena 25

be 25
smaller 25

greater 25
although 25
the 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
intuition 25
remains 25
equal 25
and 25
unaltered 25
we 25
shall 25
give 25
an 25
example 25
of 25
this 25
almost 25
all 25
natural 25
philosophers 25
remarking 25
a 25
great 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
different 25
kinds 25
in 25
bodies 25
with 25
the 25
same 25
volume 25
partly 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
the 25
momentum 25
of 25
gravity 25
or 25
weight 25
partly 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
the 25
momentum 25
of 25
resistance 25
to 25
other 25
bodies 25
in 25
motion 25
conclude 25
unanimously 25
that 25
this 25
volume 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
must 25
be 25
void 25
in 25
all 25
bodies 25
although 25
in 25
different 25
proportion 25
but 25
who 25
would 25
suspect 25
that 25
these 25
for 25
the 25
most 25
part 25
mathematical 25
and 25
mechanical 25
inquirers 25
into 25
nature 25
should 25
ground 25
this 25
conclusion 25
solely 25
on 25
a 25
metaphysical 25
hypothesisa 25
sort 25
of 25
hypothesis 25
which 25
they 25
profess 25
to 25
disparage 25
and 25
avoid 25
yet 25
this 25
they 25
do 25
in 25
assuming 25
that 25
the 25
real 25
in 25
space 25
i 25
must 25
not 25
here 25
call 25
it 25
impenetrability 25
or 25
weight 25
because 25
these 25
are 25
empirical 25
conceptions 25
is 25
always 25
identical 25
and 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
distinguished 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
that 25
is 25
multiplicity 25
now 25
to 25
this 25
presupposition 25
for 25
which 25
they 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
ground 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
which 25
consequently 25
is 25
merely 25
metaphysical 25
i 25
oppose 25
a 25
transcendental 25
demonstration 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
will 25
not 25
explain 25
the 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
filling 25
up 25
of 25
spaces 25
but 25
which 25
nevertheless 25
completely 25
does 25
away 25
with 25
the 25
supposed 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
abovementioned 25
presupposition 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
explain 25
the 25
said 25
difference 25
otherwise 25
than 25
by 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
empty 25
spaces 25
this 25
demonstration 25
moreover 25
has 25
the 25
merit 25
of 25
setting 25
the 25
understanding 25
at 25
liberty 25
to 25
conceive 25
this 25
distinction 25
in 25
a 25
different 25
manner 25
if 25
the 25
explanation 25
of 25
the 25
fact 25
requires 25
any 25
such 25
hypothesis 25
for 25
we 25
perceive 25
that 25
although 25
two 25
equal 25
spaces 25
may 25
be 25
completely 25
filled 25
by 25
matters 25
altogether 25
different 25
so 25
that 25
in 25
neither 25
of 25
them 25
is 25
there 25
left 25
a 25
single 25
point 25
wherein 25
matter 25
is 25
not 25
present 25
nevertheless 25
every 25
reality 25
has 25
its 25
degree 25
of 25
resistance 25
or 25
of 25
weight 25
which 25
without 25
diminution 25
of 25
the 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
can 25
become 25
less 25
and 25
less 25
ad 25
infinitum 25
before 25
it 25
passes 25
into 25
nothingness 25
and 25
disappears 25

decrease 25
in 25
its 25

to 25

without 25
leaving 25
the 25
smallest 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
space 25
empty 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25

it 25
with 25
those 25
lesser 25

intention 25
here 25
is 25
by 25
no 25

to 25
maintain 25
that 25
this 25
is 25

specific 25
gravity 25
i 25
wish 25
only 25
to 25
prove 25
from 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
that 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
perceptions 25
makes 25
such 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
explanation 25
possible 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
erroneous 25
to 25

in 25

nevertheless 25
this 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
anticipation 25
of 25

must 25
somewhat 25
startle 25
an 25
inquirer 25
whom 25
initiation 25
into 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
has 25
rendered 25
cautious 25
we 25
must 25
naturally 25
entertain 25
some 25
doubt 25
whether 25
or 25
not 25
the 25
understanding 25
can 25
enounce 25
any 25
such 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25

the 25

made 25
of 25
its 25
empirical 25

thus 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
question 25
not 25
unworthy 25
of 25
solution 25
how 25
the 25

can 25
pronounce 25
synthetically 25

a 25

thus 25

even 25
in 25

nothing 25

the 25

to 25
say 25
the 25
empirical 25

can 25
be 25
raised 25

the 25

the 25

our 25
internal 25

the 25

indeed 25
relates 25
a 25

its 25

the 25

the 25

empirical 25
consciousness 25
in 25

now 25
this 25

must 25
be 25
combined 25
in 25
original 25
apperception 25

to 25
relations 25
of 25

my 25

my 25

therefore 25
all 25
that 25

become 25
an 25

therefore 25
the 25
rule 25
all 25
empirical 25

these 25

this 25
peculiarity 25
that 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
concern 25

the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25

merely 25

in 25
which 25
we 25
apprehend 25
a 25

in 25
a 25

can 25
be 25
determined 25
a 25

in 25
such 25
a 25
manner 25
that 25
the 25

produce 25
this 25
a 25

every 25

the 25

although 25
we 25

arrive 25
by 25
this 25
path 25
at 25
a 25
conclusion 25
of 25
the 25
fact 25

the 25

how 25

therefore 25
entitle 25
these 25
two 25

footnote 25
kants 25

the 25
case 25
is 25
very 25

does 25
not 25
admit 25
of 25
being 25
constructed 25
it 25
is 25
clear 25
that 25
they 25
must 25
only 25
concern 25
the 25
relations 25
of 25
existence 25

be 25
merely 25
regulative 25
principles 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
therefore 25
neither 25
axioms 25
nor 25
anticipations 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
thought 25
of 25
thus 25
if 25
a 25
perception 25
is 25
given 25
us 25
in 25
a 25
certain 25

the 25

only 25
how 25
it 25

quoad 25

in 25
this 25
given 25
modus 25
of 25
time 25
analogies 25
in 25
philosophy 25
mean 25
something 25
very 25
different 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
they 25
represent 25
in 25
mathematics 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
they 25
are 25
formulae 25
which 25
enounce 25
the 25
equality 25
of 25
two 25
relations 25
of 25
quantity 25
and 25
are 25
always 25
constitutive 25
so 25
that 25
if 25
two 25

the 25

the 25
third 25

be 25
constructed 25

the 25

of 25
these 25
formulae 25

in 25
philosophy 25
analogy 25
is 25
not 25
the 25

two 25
quantitative 25

of 25
two 25
qualitative 25

three 25

a 25

in 25
discovering 25
it 25
an 25

therefore 25
only 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
unity 25

out 25
of 25

in 25

phenomena 25
not 25
as 25

merely 25
as 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
the 25

holds 25
good 25
also 25
of 25
the 25
postulates 25
of 25
empirical 25
thought 25
in 25
general 25
which 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
mere 25
intuition 25
which 25
concerns 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
phenomena 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
perception 25
which 25
concerns 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
phenomena 25

the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
experience 25
which 25
concerns 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
these 25
perceptions 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
only 25
regulative 25
principles 25
and 25
clearly 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
the 25
mathematical 25
which 25
are 25
constitutive 25
not 25
indeed 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
certainty 25
which 25
both 25
possess 25
a 25

but 25
in 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
evidence 25
thereof 25
consequently 25
also 25
in 25
the 25
manner 25
of 25
demonstration 25
but 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
observed 25
of 25
all 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
and 25
must 25
be 25
particularly 25
remarked 25
in 25
this 25
place 25
is 25
this 25
that 25
these 25
analogies 25
possess 25
significance 25
and 25
validity 25
not 25
as 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
but 25
only 25
as 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
their 25
truth 25
can 25
therefore 25
be 25
proved 25
only 25
as 25
such 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
the 25
phenomena 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
subjoined 25
directly 25
under 25
the 25
categories 25
but 25
only 25
under 25
their 25
schemata 25
for 25
if 25
the 25
objects 25
to 25
which 25
those 25
principles 25
must 25
be 25
applied 25
were 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
quite 25
impossible 25
to 25
cognize 25
aught 25
concerning 25
them 25
synthetically 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
they 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
phenomena 25
a 25
complete 25
knowledge 25
of 25
whicha 25
knowledge 25
to 25
which 25
all 25
principles 25
a 25

must 25
at 25
last 25
relateis 25
the 25
only 25
possible 25
experience 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
these 25
principles 25
can 25
have 25
nothing 25
else 25
for 25
their 25
aim 25
than 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
in 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
synthesis 25
of 25
phenomena 25
but 25
this 25
synthesis 25
is 25
cogitated 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
schema 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
of 25
whose 25
unity 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
synthesis 25
in 25
general 25
the 25
category 25
contains 25
the 25
function 25
unrestricted 25
by 25
any 25
sensuous 25
condition 25
these 25
principles 25
will 25
therefore 25
authorize 25
us 25
to 25
connect 25
phenomena 25
according 25
to 25
an 25
analogy 25
with 25
the 25
logical 25
and 25
universal 25
unity 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
consequently 25
to 25
employ 25
the 25
categories 25
in 25
the 25
principles 25
themselves 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
them 25
to 25
experience 25
we 25
shall 25
use 25
only 25
their 25
schemata 25
as 25
the 25
key 25
to 25
their 25
proper 25
application 25
instead 25

all 25

many 25

all 25

possible 25
permanence 25

in 25
fact 25
just 25
another 25
expression 25

as 25
the 25

of 25
all 25

does 25
not 25
affect 25
time 25
itself 25
but 25
only 25
the 25
phenomena 25
in 25
time 25
just 25
as 25
coexistence 25
cannot 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
a 25
modus 25
of 25

itself 25
seeing 25
that 25
in 25
time 25
no 25
parts 25
are 25
coexistent 25
but 25
all 25
successive 25
if 25
we 25
were 25
to 25
attribute 25
succession 25
to 25
time 25
itself 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
obliged 25
to 25
cogitate 25
another 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
this 25
succession 25
would 25
be 25
possible 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
permanent 25
that 25
existence 25
in 25
different 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25
successive 25
series 25
of 25

receives 25
a 25
quantity 25
which 25
we 25
entitle 25
duration 25
for 25
in 25
mere 25
succession 25
existence 25
is 25
perpetually 25
vanishing 25
and 25
recommencing 25
and 25
therefore 25
never 25
has 25
even 25
the 25
least 25
quantity 25
without 25
the 25
permanent 25
then 25
no 25
relation 25
in 25
time 25
is 25
possible 25
now 25
time 25
in 25
itself 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
perception 25
consequently 25
the 25
permanent 25
in 25
phenomena 25
must 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
determination 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
consequently 25
also 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
all 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
of 25
perceptions 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
all 25
existence 25
and 25
all 25
change 25
in 25
time 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
a 25
mode 25
in 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
abides 25
unchangeably 25
therefore 25
in 25
all 25
phenomena 25
the 25
permanent 25
is 25
the 25
object 25
in 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
substance 25
phenomenon 25
but 25
all 25
that 25
changes 25
or 25
can 25
change 25
belongs 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
this 25
substance 25
or 25
substances 25
consequently 25
to 25
its 25
determinations 25
i 25
find 25
that 25
in 25
all 25
ages 25
not 25
only 25
the 25
philosopher 25
but 25
even 25
the 25
common 25
understanding 25
has 25
preposited 25
this 25
permanence 25
as 25
a 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
change 25
in 25
phenomena 25
indeed 25
i 25
am 25
compelled 25
to 25
believe 25
that 25
they 25
will 25
always 25
accept 25
this 25
as 25
an 25
indubitable 25
fact 25
only 25
the 25
philosopher 25
expresses 25
himself 25
in 25
a 25
more 25
precise 25
and 25
definite 25
manner 25
when 25
he 25
says 25
in 25
all 25
changes 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
the 25
substance 25
remains 25
and 25
the 25
accidents 25
alone 25
are 25
changeable 25
but 25
of 25
this 25
decidedly 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
i 25
nowhere 25
meet 25
with 25
even 25
an 25
attempt 25
at 25
proof 25
nay 25
it 25
very 25
rarely 25
has 25
the 25
good 25
fortune 25
to 25
stand 25
as 25
it 25
deserves 25
to 25
do 25
at 25
the 25
head 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
and 25
entirely 25
a 25
priori 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
in 25
truth 25
the 25
statement 25
that 25
substance 25
is 25
permanent 25
is 25
tautological 25
for 25
this 25
very 25
permanence 25
is 25
the 25
ground 25
on 25
which 25
we 25
apply 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
substance 25
to 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
been 25
obliged 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
in 25
all 25
phenomena 25
there 25
is 25
something 25
permanent 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
changeable 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
a 25
determination 25
but 25
because 25
a 25
proof 25
of 25
this 25
nature 25
cannot 25
be 25
dogmatical 25
that 25
is 25
cannot 25
be 25
drawn 25
from 25
conceptions 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
concerns 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
as 25
philosophers 25
never 25
reflected 25
that 25
such 25
propositions 25
are 25
valid 25
only 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
therefore 25
cannot 25
be 25
proved 25
except 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
a 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
it 25
is 25
no 25
wonder 25
that 25
while 25
it 25
has 25
served 25
as 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
for 25
we 25
feel 25
the 25
need 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
it 25
has 25
never 25
been 25
supported 25
by 25
proof 25
a 25
philosopher 25
was 25
asked 25
what 25
is 25
the 25
weight 25
of 25
smoke 25
he 25
answered 25
subtract 25
from 25
the 25
weight 25
of 25
the 25
burnt 25
wood 25
the 25
weight 25
of 25
the 25
remaining 25
ashes 25
and 25
you 25
will 25
have 25
the 25
weight 25
of 25
the 25
smoke 25
thus 25
he 25
presumed 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
incontrovertible 25
that 25
even 25
in 25
fire 25
the 25
matter 25
substance 25
does 25
not 25
perish 25
but 25
that 25
only 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
it 25
undergoes 25
a 25
change 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
was 25
the 25
saying 25
from 25
nothing 25
comes 25
nothing 25
only 25
another 25
inference 25
from 25
the 25
principle 25
or 25
permanence 25
or 25
rather 25
of 25
the 25
everabiding 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
true 25
subject 25
in 25
phenomena 25
for 25
if 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
which 25
we 25
call 25
substance 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
proper 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
determination 25
of 25
time 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
all 25
existence 25
in 25
past 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
future 25
time 25
must 25
be 25
determinable 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
it 25
alone 25
hence 25
we 25
are 25
entitled 25
to 25
apply 25
the 25
term 25
substance 25
to 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
only 25
because 25
we 25
suppose 25
its 25
existence 25
in 25
all 25
time 25
a 25
notion 25
which 25
the 25
word 25
permanence 25
does 25
not 25
fully 25
express 25
as 25
it 25
seems 25
rather 25
to 25
be 25
referable 25
to 25
future 25
time 25
however 25
the 25
internal 25
necessity 25
perpetually 25
to 25
be 25
is 25
inseparably 25
connected 25
with 25
the 25
necessity 25
always 25
to 25
have 25
been 25
and 25
so 25
the 25
expression 25
may 25
stand 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
gigni 25
de 25

are 25
two 25
propositions 25
which 25
the 25
ancients 25
never 25
parted 25
and 25
which 25
people 25
nowadays 25
sometimes 25
mistakenly 25
disjoin 25
because 25
they 25
imagine 25
that 25
the 25
propositions 25
apply 25
to 25
objects 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
former 25
might 25
be 25
inimical 25
to 25
the 25
dependence 25
even 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
its 25
substance 25
also 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
upon 25
a 25
supreme 25
cause 25
but 25
this 25
apprehension 25
is 25
entirely 25
needless 25
for 25
the 25
question 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
is 25
only 25
of 25
phenomena 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
which 25
never 25
could 25
be 25
possible 25
if 25
we 25
admitted 25
the 25
possibility 25
that 25
new 25
things 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
their 25
substance 25
should 25
arise 25
for 25
in 25
that 25
case 25
we 25
should 25
lose 25
altogether 25
that 25
which 25
alone 25
can 25
represent 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
time 25
to 25

the 25
identity 25

alone 25
all 25
change 25
possesses 25
complete 25
and 25
thorough 25
unity 25
this 25
permanence 25
is 25
however 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25

we 25
represent 25

ourselves 25
the 25

stands 25
under 25
the 25
title 25

because 25

may 25
say 25
employing 25

this 25
very 25
notion 25

then 25
have 25
a 25
point 25
of 25

it 25

how 25

by 25
what 25
can 25
we 25
fix 25

determine 25
this 25
point 25

connect 25
this 25
beginning 25
with 25
objects 25

existed 25
previously 25

thereof 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
that 25
the 25
origin 25
or 25
extinction 25
of 25
substance 25
itself 25
is 25
impossibleall 25
this 25
has 25
been 25
fully 25
established 25
in 25
treating 25
of 25
the 25
foregoing 25
principle 25
this 25
principle 25
might 25
have 25
been 25
expressed 25
as 25
follows 25
all 25
alteration 25
succession 25
of 25
phenomena 25
is 25
merely 25
change 25
for 25
the 25
changes 25
of 25
substance 25
are 25
not 25
origin 25
or 25
extinction 25
because 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
change 25
presupposes 25
the 25
same 25
subject 25
as 25
existing 25
with 25
two 25
opposite 25
determinations 25
and 25
consequently 25
as 25
permanent 25
after 25
this 25
premonition 25
we 25
shall 25
proceed 25
to 25
the 25
proof 25
i 25
perceive 25
that 25
phenomena 25
succeed 25
one 25
another 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
things 25
exists 25
at 25
one 25
time 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
which 25
existed 25
in 25
a 25
former 25
state 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
then 25
i 25
really 25
connect 25
together 25
two 25
perceptions 25
in 25
time 25
now 25
connection 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
operation 25
of 25
mere 25
sense 25
and 25
intuition 25
but 25
is 25
the 25
product 25
of 25
a 25
synthetical 25
faculty 25
of 25
imagination 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
a 25
relation 25
of 25
time 25
but 25
imagination 25
can 25
connect 25
these 25
two 25
states 25
in 25
two 25
ways 25
so 25
that 25
either 25
the 25
one 25
or 25
the 25
other 25
may 25
antecede 25
in 25
time 25
for 25
time 25
in 25
itself 25
cannot 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
perception 25
and 25
what 25
in 25
an 25
object 25
precedes 25
and 25
what 25
follows 25
cannot 25
be 25
empirically 25
determined 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
it 25
i 25
am 25
only 25
conscious 25
then 25
that 25
my 25
imagination 25
places 25
one 25
state 25
before 25
and 25
the 25
other 25
after 25
not 25
that 25
the 25
one 25
state 25
antecedes 25
the 25
other 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
the 25
objective 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
successive 25
phenomena 25
remains 25
quite 25
undetermined 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
mere 25
perception 25
now 25
in 25
order 25
that 25
this 25
relation 25
may 25
be 25
cognized 25
as 25
determined 25
the 25
relation 25
between 25
the 25
two 25
states 25
must 25
be 25
so 25
cogitated 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
thereby 25
determined 25
as 25
necessary 25
which 25
of 25
them 25
must 25
be 25
placed 25
before 25
and 25
which 25
after 25
and 25
not 25
conversely 25
but 25
the 25
conception 25
which 25
carries 25
with 25
it 25
a 25
necessity 25
of 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
can 25
be 25
none 25
other 25
than 25
a 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
lie 25
in 25
mere 25
perception 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
the 25
former 25
of 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
latter 25
in 25
time 25
as 25
its 25
necessary 25
consequence 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
something 25
which 25
might 25
possibly 25
antecede 25
or 25
which 25
might 25
in 25
some 25
cases 25
not 25
be 25
perceived 25
to 25
follow 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
because 25
we 25
subject 25
the 25
sequence 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
consequently 25
all 25
change 25
to 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
that 25
experience 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
becomes 25
possible 25
and 25
consequently 25
that 25
phenomena 25
themselves 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
are 25
possible 25
only 25
by 25
virtue 25
of 25
this 25
law 25
our 25
apprehension 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
phenomena 25
is 25
always 25
successive 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25
parts 25
succeed 25
one 25
another 25
whether 25
they 25
succeed 25
one 25
another 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
also 25
is 25
a 25
second 25
point 25
for 25
reflection 25
which 25
was 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
now 25
we 25
may 25
certainly 25
give 25
the 25
name 25
of 25
object 25
to 25
everything 25
even 25
to 25
every 25
representation 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
are 25
conscious 25
thereof 25
but 25
what 25
this 25
word 25
may 25
mean 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
phenomena 25
not 25
merely 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
as 25
representations 25
are 25
objects 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
indicate 25
an 25
object 25
is 25
a 25
question 25
requiring 25
deeper 25
consideration 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
regarded 25
merely 25
as 25
representations 25
are 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
objects 25
of 25
consciousness 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
apprehension 25
that 25
is 25
reception 25
into 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
imagination 25
and 25
we 25
must 25
therefore 25
say 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
phenomena 25
is 25
always 25
produced 25
successively 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
if 25
phenomena 25
were 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
no 25
man 25
would 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
conjecture 25
from 25
the 25
succession 25
of 25
our 25
representations 25
how 25
this 25
manifold 25
is 25
connected 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
do 25
only 25
with 25
our 25
representations 25
how 25
things 25
may 25
be 25
in 25
themselves 25
without 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
representations 25
through 25
which 25
they 25
affect 25
us 25
is 25
utterly 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
now 25
although 25
phenomena 25
are 25
not 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
are 25
nevertheless 25
the 25
only 25
thing 25
given 25
to 25
us 25
to 25
be 25
cognized 25
it 25
is 25
my 25
duty 25
to 25
show 25
what 25
sort 25
of 25
connection 25
in 25
time 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
phenomena 25
themselves 25
while 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
this 25
manifold 25
in 25
apprehension 25
is 25
always 25
successive 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
of 25
a 25
house 25
which 25
stands 25
before 25
me 25
is 25
successive 25
now 25
comes 25
the 25
question 25
whether 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
this 25
house 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
successivewhich 25
no 25
one 25
will 25
be 25
at 25
all 25
willing 25
to 25
grant 25
but 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
i 25
raise 25
my 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
the 25
transcendental 25
signification 25
thereof 25
i 25
find 25
that 25
the 25
house 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
that 25
is 25
a 25
representation 25
the 25
transcendental 25
object 25
of 25
which 25
remains 25
utterly 25
unknown 25
what 25
then 25
am 25
i 25
to 25
understand 25
by 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
can 25
the 25
manifold 25
be 25
connected 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
itselfnot 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
merely 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
here 25
that 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
my 25
successive 25
apprehension 25
is 25
regarded 25
as 25
representation 25
whilst 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
which 25
is 25
given 25
me 25
notwithstanding 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
complex 25
of 25
these 25
representations 25
is 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
object 25
thereof 25
with 25
which 25
my 25
conception 25
drawn 25
from 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25
apprehension 25
must 25
harmonize 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
soon 25
seen 25
that 25
as 25
accordance 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
with 25
its 25
object 25
constitutes 25
truth 25
the 25
question 25
now 25
before 25
us 25
can 25
only 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
empirical 25
truth 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25
apprehension 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
distinguished 25
therefrom 25
as 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
them 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
subject 25
to 25
a 25
rule 25
which 25
distinguishes 25
it 25
from 25
every 25
other 25
apprehension 25
and 25
which 25
renders 25
necessary 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
which 25
contains 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
this 25
necessary 25
rule 25
of 25
apprehension 25
is 25
the 25
object 25
let 25
us 25
now 25
proceed 25
to 25
our 25
task 25
that 25
something 25
happens 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
something 25
or 25
some 25
state 25
exists 25
which 25
before 25
was 25
not 25
cannot 25
be 25
empirically 25
perceived 25
unless 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
precedes 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
contain 25
in 25
itself 25
this 25
state 25
for 25
a 25
reality 25
which 25
should 25
follow 25
upon 25
a 25
void 25
time 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
a 25
beginning 25
which 25
no 25
state 25
of 25
things 25
precedes 25
can 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
be 25
apprehended 25
as 25
the 25
void 25
time 25
itself 25
every 25
apprehension 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
is 25
therefore 25
a 25
perception 25
which 25
follows 25
upon 25
another 25
perception 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
all 25
synthesis 25
of 25
apprehension 25
as 25
i 25
have 25
shown 25
above 25
in 25
the 25
example 25
of 25
a 25
house 25
my 25
apprehension 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
is 25
not 25
yet 25
sufficiently 25
distinguished 25
from 25
other 25
apprehensions 25
but 25
i 25
remark 25
also 25
that 25
if 25
in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
which 25
contains 25
an 25
occurrence 25
i 25
call 25
the 25
antecedent 25
state 25
of 25
my 25
perception 25
a 25
and 25
the 25
following 25
state 25
b 25
the 25
perception 25
b 25
can 25
only 25
follow 25
a 25
in 25
apprehension 25
and 25
the 25
perception 25
a 25
cannot 25
follow 25
b 25
but 25
only 25
precede 25
it 25
for 25
example 25
i 25
see 25
a 25
ship 25
float 25
down 25
the 25
stream 25
of 25
a 25
river 25
my 25
perception 25
of 25
its 25
place 25
lower 25
down 25
follows 25
upon 25
my 25
perception 25
of 25
its 25
place 25
higher 25
up 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
the 25
river 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
this 25
phenomenon 25
the 25
vessel 25
should 25
be 25
perceived 25
first 25
below 25
and 25
afterwards 25
higher 25
up 25
the 25
stream 25
here 25
therefore 25
the 25
order 25
in 25
the 25
sequence 25
of 25
perceptions 25
in 25
apprehension 25
is 25
determined 25
and 25
by 25
this 25
order 25
apprehension 25
is 25
regulated 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
example 25
my 25
perceptions 25
in 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
a 25
house 25
might 25
begin 25
at 25
the 25
roof 25
and 25
end 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
or 25
vice 25
versa 25
or 25
i 25
might 25
apprehend 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
this 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
by 25
going 25
from 25
left 25
to 25
right 25
and 25
from 25
right 25
to 25
left 25
accordingly 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
these 25
perceptions 25
there 25
was 25
no 25
determined 25
order 25
which 25
necessitated 25
my 25
beginning 25
at 25
a 25
certain 25
point 25
in 25
order 25
empirically 25
to 25
connect 25
the 25
manifold 25
but 25
this 25
rule 25
is 25
always 25
to 25
be 25
met 25
with 25
in 25
the 25
perception 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
happens 25
and 25
it 25
makes 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
the 25
successive 25
perceptions 25
in 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
necessary 25
i 25
must 25
therefore 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
deduce 25
the 25
subjective 25
sequence 25
of 25
apprehension 25
from 25
the 25
objective 25
sequence 25
of 25
phenomena 25
for 25
otherwise 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
quite 25
undetermined 25
and 25
one 25
phenomenon 25
is 25
not 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
another 25
the 25
former 25
alone 25
proves 25
nothing 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
an 25
object 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
arbitrary 25
the 25
latter 25
must 25
consist 25
in 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
order 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
one 25
thing 25
that 25
which 25
happens 25
follows 25
that 25
of 25
another 25
thing 25
which 25
precedes 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
alone 25
can 25
i 25
be 25
authorized 25
to 25
say 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
itself 25
and 25
not 25
merely 25
of 25
my 25
own 25
apprehension 25
that 25
a 25
certain 25
order 25
or 25
sequence 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
therein 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
i 25
cannot 25
arrange 25
my 25
apprehension 25
otherwise 25
than 25
in 25
this 25
order 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
this 25
rule 25
then 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
that 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
antecedes 25
an 25
event 25
there 25
be 25
found 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
in 25
this 25
event 25
follows 25
always 25
and 25
necessarily 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
reverse 25
this 25
and 25
go 25
back 25
from 25
the 25
event 25
and 25
determine 25
by 25
apprehension 25
that 25
which 25
antecedes 25
it 25
for 25
no 25
phenomenon 25
goes 25
back 25
from 25
the 25
succeeding 25
point 25
of 25
time 25
to 25
the 25
preceding 25
point 25
although 25
it 25
does 25
certainly 25
relate 25
to 25
a 25
preceding 25
point 25
of 25
time 25
from 25
a 25
given 25
time 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
there 25
is 25
always 25
a 25
necessary 25
progression 25
to 25
the 25
determined 25
succeeding 25
time 25
therefore 25
because 25
there 25
certainly 25
is 25
something 25
that 25
follows 25
i 25
must 25
of 25
necessity 25
connect 25
it 25
with 25
something 25
else 25
which 25
antecedes 25
and 25
upon 25
which 25
it 25
follows 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
that 25
is 25
necessarily 25
so 25
that 25
the 25
event 25
as 25
conditioned 25
affords 25
certain 25
indication 25
of 25
a 25
condition 25
and 25
this 25
condition 25
determines 25
the 25
event 25
let 25
us 25
suppose 25
that 25
nothing 25
precedes 25
an 25
event 25
upon 25
which 25
this 25
event 25
must 25
follow 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
all 25
sequence 25
of 25
perception 25
would 25
then 25
exist 25
only 25
in 25
apprehension 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
would 25
be 25
merely 25
subjective 25
and 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
thereby 25
be 25
objectively 25
determined 25
what 25
thing 25
ought 25
to 25
precede 25
and 25
what 25
ought 25
to 25
follow 25
in 25
perception 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
nothing 25
but 25
a 25
play 25
of 25
representations 25
which 25
would 25
possess 25
no 25
application 25
to 25
any 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
possible 25
through 25
perception 25
to 25
distinguish 25
one 25
phenomenon 25
from 25
another 25
as 25
regards 25
relations 25
of 25
time 25
because 25
the 25
succession 25
in 25
the 25
act 25
of 25
apprehension 25
would 25
always 25
be 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
sort 25
and 25
therefore 25
there 25
would 25
be 25
nothing 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
to 25
determine 25
the 25
succession 25
and 25
to 25
render 25
a 25
certain 25
sequence 25
objectively 25
necessary 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
i 25
cannot 25
say 25
that 25
two 25
states 25
in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
follow 25
one 25
upon 25
the 25
other 25
but 25
only 25
that 25
one 25
apprehension 25
follows 25
upon 25
another 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
merely 25
subjective 25
and 25
does 25
not 25
determine 25
an 25
object 25
and 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
be 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
objectnot 25
even 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
accordingly 25
when 25
we 25
know 25
in 25
experience 25
that 25
something 25
happens 25
we 25
always 25
presuppose 25
that 25
something 25
precedes 25
whereupon 25
it 25
follows 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
for 25
otherwise 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
say 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
that 25
it 25
follows 25
because 25
the 25
mere 25
succession 25
in 25
my 25
apprehension 25
if 25
it 25
be 25
not 25
determined 25
by 25
a 25
rule 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
something 25
preceding 25
does 25
not 25
authorize 25
succession 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
only 25
therefore 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
phenomena 25
are 25
determined 25
in 25
their 25
sequence 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
they 25
happen 25
by 25
the 25
preceding 25
state 25
can 25
i 25
make 25
my 25
subjective 25
synthesis 25
of 25
apprehension 25
objective 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
under 25
this 25
presupposition 25
that 25
even 25
the 25
experience 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
is 25
possible 25
no 25
doubt 25
it 25
appears 25
as 25
if 25
this 25
were 25
in 25
thorough 25
contradiction 25
to 25
all 25
the 25
notions 25
which 25
people 25
have 25
hitherto 25
entertained 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
understanding 25
according 25
to 25
these 25
opinions 25
it 25
is 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
perception 25
and 25
comparison 25
of 25
similar 25
consequences 25
following 25
upon 25
certain 25
antecedent 25
phenomena 25
that 25
the 25
understanding 25
is 25
led 25
to 25
the 25
discovery 25
of 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
certain 25
events 25
always 25
follow 25
certain 25
phenomena 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
by 25
this 25
process 25
that 25
we 25
attain 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
cause 25
upon 25
such 25
a 25
basis 25
it 25
is 25
clear 25
that 25
this 25
conception 25
must 25
be 25
merely 25
empirical 25
and 25
the 25
rule 25
which 25
it 25
furnishes 25
us 25
witheverything 25
that 25
happens 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
causewould 25
be 25
just 25
as 25
contingent 25
as 25
experience 25
itself 25
the 25
universality 25
and 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
rule 25
or 25
law 25
would 25
be 25
perfectly 25
spurious 25
attributes 25
of 25
it 25
indeed 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
possess 25
universal 25
validity 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
be 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
founded 25
on 25
deduction 25
but 25
the 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
this 25
law 25
as 25
with 25
other 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
representations 25
eg 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
draw 25
in 25
perfect 25
clearness 25
and 25
completeness 25
from 25
experience 25
only 25
because 25
we 25
had 25
already 25
placed 25
them 25
therein 25
and 25
by 25
that 25
means 25
and 25
by 25
that 25
alone 25
had 25
rendered 25
experience 25
possible 25
indeed 25
the 25
logical 25
clearness 25
of 25
this 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
rule 25
determining 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
events 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
when 25
we 25
have 25
made 25
use 25
thereof 25
in 25
experience 25
nevertheless 25
the 25
recognition 25
of 25
this 25
rule 25
as 25
a 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
of 25
phenomena 25
in 25
time 25
was 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
experience 25
itself 25
and 25
consequently 25
preceded 25
it 25
a 25
priori 25
it 25
is 25
now 25
our 25
duty 25
to 25
show 25
by 25
an 25
example 25
that 25
we 25
never 25
even 25
in 25
experience 25
attribute 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
succession 25
or 25
effect 25
of 25
an 25
eventthat 25
is 25
the 25
happening 25
of 25
something 25
that 25
did 25
not 25
exist 25
before 25
and 25
distinguish 25
it 25
from 25
the 25
subjective 25
succession 25
of 25
apprehension 25
unless 25
when 25
a 25
rule 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
which 25
compels 25
us 25
to 25
observe 25
this 25
order 25
of 25
perception 25
in 25
preference 25
to 25
any 25
other 25
and 25
that 25
indeed 25
it 25
is 25
this 25
necessity 25
which 25
first 25
renders 25
possible 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
succession 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
we 25
have 25
representations 25
within 25
us 25
of 25
which 25
also 25
we 25
can 25
be 25
conscious 25
but 25
however 25
widely 25
extended 25
however 25
accurate 25
and 25
thoroughgoing 25
this 25
consciousness 25
may 25
be 25
these 25
representations 25
are 25
still 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
representations 25
that 25
is 25
internal 25
determinations 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
in 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
relation 25
of 25
time 25
now 25
how 25
happens 25
it 25
that 25
to 25
these 25
representations 25
we 25
should 25
set 25
an 25
object 25
or 25
that 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
their 25
subjective 25
reality 25
as 25
modifications 25
we 25
should 25
still 25
further 25
attribute 25
to 25
them 25
a 25
certain 25
unknown 25
objective 25
reality 25
it 25
is 25
clear 25
that 25
objective 25
significancy 25
cannot 25
consist 25
in 25
a 25
relation 25
to 25
another 25
representation 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
we 25
desire 25
to 25
term 25
object 25
for 25
in 25
that 25
case 25
the 25
question 25
again 25
arises 25
how 25
does 25
this 25
other 25
representation 25
go 25
out 25
of 25
itself 25
and 25
obtain 25
objective 25
significancy 25
over 25
and 25
above 25
the 25
subjective 25
which 25
is 25
proper 25
to 25
it 25
as 25
a 25
determination 25
of 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
mind 25
if 25
we 25
try 25
to 25
discover 25
what 25
sort 25
of 25
new 25
property 25
the 25
relation 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
gives 25
to 25
our 25
subjective 25
representations 25
and 25
what 25
new 25
importance 25
they 25
thereby 25
receive 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
this 25
relation 25
has 25
no 25
other 25
effect 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
rendering 25
necessary 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
our 25

in 25
a 25
certain 25
manner 25
and 25
of 25
subjecting 25
them 25
to 25
a 25
rule 25
and 25
that 25
conversely 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
because 25
a 25
certain 25

necessary 25
in 25
the 25

of 25

i 25

from 25
all 25
this 25
it 25

obvious 25
that 25
the 25

which 25
the 25

one 25
another 25

the 25
order 25
of 25

may 25
be 25
taken 25
retrogressively 25
as 25
well 25
as 25

if 25
this 25

to 25
the 25
sequence 25
of 25
perceptions 25
consequently 25
of 25
their 25
empirical 25
truth 25
and 25
therefore 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
causality 25
in 25
the 25
succession 25
of 25
phenomena 25
is 25
therefore 25
valid 25
for 25
all 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
itself 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
here 25
however 25
a 25
difficulty 25
arises 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
resolved 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
causality 25
among 25
phenomena 25
is 25
limited 25
in 25
our 25
formula 25
to 25
the 25
succession 25
thereof 25
although 25
in 25
practice 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
the 25
principle 25
applies 25
also 25
when 25
the 25
phenomena 25
exist 25
together 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
and 25
that 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
may 25
be 25
simultaneous 25
for 25
example 25
there 25
is 25
heat 25
in 25
a 25
room 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
in 25
the 25
open 25
air 25
i 25
look 25
about 25
for 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
find 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
fire 25
now 25
the 25
fire 25
as 25
the 25
cause 25
is 25
simultaneous 25
with 25
its 25
effect 25
the 25
heat 25
of 25
the 25
room 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
then 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
succession 25
as 25
regards 25
time 25
between 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
but 25
they 25
are 25
simultaneous 25
and 25
still 25
the 25
law 25
holds 25
good 25
the 25
greater 25
part 25
of 25
operating 25
causes 25
in 25
nature 25
are 25
simultaneous 25
with 25
their 25
effects 25
and 25
the 25
succession 25
in 25
time 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
produced 25
only 25
because 25
the 25
cause 25
cannot 25
achieve 25
the 25
total 25
of 25
its 25
effect 25
in 25
one 25
moment 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
moment 25
when 25
the 25
effect 25
first 25
arises 25
it 25
is 25
always 25
simultaneous 25
with 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
its 25
cause 25
because 25
if 25
the 25
cause 25
had 25
but 25
a 25
moment 25
before 25
ceased 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
effect 25
could 25
not 25
have 25
arisen 25
here 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
specially 25
remembered 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
consider 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
not 25
the 25
lapse 25
thereof 25
the 25
relation 25
remains 25
even 25
though 25
no 25
time 25
has 25
elapsed 25
the 25
time 25
between 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
its 25
immediate 25
effect 25
may 25
entirely 25
vanish 25
and 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
be 25
thus 25
simultaneous 25
but 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
remains 25
always 25
determinable 25
according 25
to 25
time 25
if 25
for 25
example 25
i 25
consider 25
a 25
leaden 25
ball 25
which 25
lies 25
upon 25
a 25
cushion 25
and 25
makes 25
a 25
hollow 25
in 25
it 25
as 25
a 25
cause 25
then 25
it 25
is 25
simultaneous 25
with 25
the 25
effect 25
but 25
i 25
distinguish 25
the 25
two 25
through 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
time 25
of 25
the 25
dynamical 25
connection 25
of 25
both 25
for 25
if 25
i 25
lay 25
the 25
ball 25
upon 25
the 25
cushion 25
then 25
the 25
hollow 25
follows 25
upon 25
the 25
before 25
smooth 25
surface 25
but 25
supposing 25
the 25
cushion 25
has 25
from 25
some 25
cause 25
or 25
another 25
a 25
hollow 25
there 25
does 25
not 25
thereupon 25
follow 25
a 25
leaden 25
ball 25
thus 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
succession 25
of 25
time 25
is 25
in 25
all 25
instances 25
the 25
only 25
empirical 25
criterion 25
of 25
effect 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
the 25
antecedent 25
cause 25
the 25
glass 25
is 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
rising 25
of 25
the 25
water 25
above 25
its 25
horizontal 25
surface 25
although 25
the 25
two 25
phenomena 25
are 25
contemporaneous 25
for 25
as 25
soon 25
as 25
i 25
draw 25
some 25
water 25
with 25
the 25
glass 25
from 25
a 25
larger 25
vessel 25
an 25
effect 25
follows 25
thereupon 25
namely 25
the 25
change 25
of 25
the 25
horizontal 25
state 25
which 25
the 25
water 25
had 25
in 25
the 25
large 25
vessel 25
into 25
a 25
concave 25
which 25
it 25
assumes 25
in 25
the 25
glass 25
this 25
conception 25
of 25
causality 25
leads 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
action 25
that 25
of 25
action 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
force 25
and 25
through 25
it 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substance 25
as 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
wish 25
this 25
critical 25
essay 25
the 25
sole 25
purpose 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
treat 25
of 25
the 25
sources 25
of 25
our 25
synthetical 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
to 25
be 25
crowded 25
with 25
analyses 25
which 25
merely 25
explain 25
but 25
do 25
not 25
enlarge 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
conceptions 25
i 25
reserve 25
the 25
detailed 25
explanation 25
of 25
the 25
above 25
conceptions 25
for 25
a 25
future 25
system 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
such 25
an 25
analysis 25
indeed 25
executed 25
with 25
great 25
particularity 25
may 25
already 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
wellknown 25
works 25
on 25
this 25
subject 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
at 25
present 25
refrain 25
from 25
making 25
a 25
few 25
remarks 25
on 25
the 25
empirical 25
criterion 25
of 25
a 25
substance 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
seems 25
to 25
be 25
more 25
evident 25
and 25
more 25
easily 25
recognized 25
through 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
action 25
than 25
through 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
permanence 25
of 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
where 25
action 25
consequently 25
activity 25
and 25
force 25
exists 25
substance 25
also 25
must 25
exist 25
and 25
in 25
it 25
alone 25
must 25
be 25
sought 25
the 25
seat 25
of 25
that 25
fruitful 25
source 25
of 25
phenomena 25
very 25
well 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
explain 25
what 25
we 25
mean 25
by 25
substance 25
and 25
wish 25
to 25
avoid 25
the 25
vice 25
of 25
reasoning 25
in 25
a 25
circle 25
the 25
answer 25
is 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
so 25
easy 25
how 25
shall 25
we 25
conclude 25
immediately 25
from 25
the 25
action 25
to 25
the 25
permanence 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
acts 25
this 25
being 25
nevertheless 25
an 25
essential 25
and 25
peculiar 25
criterion 25
of 25
substance 25
phenomenon 25
but 25
after 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
above 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
this 25
question 25
becomes 25
easy 25
enough 25
although 25
by 25
the 25
common 25
mode 25
of 25
proceduremerely 25
analysing 25
our 25
conceptionsit 25
would 25
be 25
quite 25
impossible 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
action 25
indicates 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
causality 25
to 25
the 25
effect 25
now 25
because 25
all 25
effect 25
consists 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
happens 25
therefore 25
in 25
the 25
changeable 25
the 25
last 25
subject 25
thereof 25
is 25
the 25
permanent 25
as 25
the 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
changes 25
that 25
is 25
substance 25
for 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
actions 25
are 25
always 25
the 25
first 25
ground 25
of 25
all 25
change 25
in 25
phenomena 25
and 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
be 25
a 25
property 25
of 25
a 25
subject 25
which 25
itself 25
changes 25
because 25
if 25
this 25
were 25
the 25
case 25
other 25
actions 25
and 25
another 25
subject 25
would 25
be 25
necessary 25
to 25
determine 25
this 25
change 25
from 25
all 25
this 25
it 25
results 25
that 25
action 25
alone 25
as 25
an 25
empirical 25
criterion 25
is 25
a 25
sufficient 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
substantiality 25
without 25
any 25
necessity 25
on 25
my 25
part 25
of 25
endeavouring 25
to 25
discover 25
the 25
permanence 25
of 25
substance 25
by 25
a 25
comparison 25
besides 25
by 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
induction 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
attain 25
to 25
the 25
completeness 25
which 25
the 25
magnitude 25
and 25
strict 25
universality 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
requires 25
for 25
that 25
the 25
primary 25
subject 25
of 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
all 25
arising 25
and 25
passing 25
away 25
all 25
origin 25
and 25
extinction 25
cannot 25
itself 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
phenomena 25
arise 25
and 25
pass 25
away 25
is 25
a 25
sound 25
and 25
safe 25
conclusion 25
a 25
conclusion 25
which 25
leads 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
empirical 25
necessity 25
and 25
permanence 25
in 25
existence 25
and 25
consequently 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
substance 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
when 25
something 25
happens 25
the 25
mere 25
fact 25
of 25
the 25
occurrence 25
without 25
regard 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
occurs 25
is 25
an 25
object 25
requiring 25
investigation 25
the 25
transition 25
from 25
the 25
nonbeing 25
of 25
a 25
state 25
into 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
it 25
supposing 25
that 25
this 25
state 25
contains 25
no 25
quality 25
which 25
previously 25
existed 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
is 25
a 25
fact 25
of 25
itself 25
demanding 25
inquiry 25
such 25
an 25
event 25
as 25
has 25
been 25
shown 25
in 25
no 25
a 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
substance 25
for 25
substance 25
does 25
not 25
thus 25
originate 25
but 25
its 25
condition 25
or 25
state 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
only 25
change 25
and 25
not 25
origin 25
from 25
nothing 25
if 25
this 25
origin 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
effect 25
of 25
a 25
foreign 25
cause 25
it 25
is 25
termed 25
creation 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
admitted 25
as 25
an 25
event 25
among 25
phenomena 25
because 25
the 25
very 25
possibility 25
of 25
it 25
would 25
annihilate 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
experience 25
if 25
however 25
i 25
regard 25
all 25
things 25
not 25
as 25
phenomena 25
but 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
objects 25
of 25
understanding 25
alone 25
they 25
although 25
substances 25
may 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
dependent 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
their 25
existence 25
on 25
a 25
foreign 25
cause 25
but 25
this 25
would 25
require 25
a 25
very 25
different 25
meaning 25
in 25
the 25
words 25
a 25
meaning 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
apply 25
to 25
phenomena 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
how 25
a 25
thing 25
can 25
be 25
changed 25
how 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
that 25
upon 25
one 25
state 25
existing 25
in 25
one 25
point 25
of 25

of 25
the 25

thus 25
when 25
a 25

moves 25

it 25

now 25
the 25
question 25
arises 25
how 25
a 25
thing 25
passes 25
from 25
one 25
state 25
a 25
into 25
another 25
state 25
b 25
between 25
two 25
moments 25
there 25
is 25
always 25
a 25
certain 25
time 25
and 25
between 25
two 25
states 25
existing 25
in 25
these 25
moments 25
there 25
is 25
always 25
a 25
difference 25
having 25
a 25
certain 25
quantity 25
for 25
all 25
parts 25
of 25
phenomena 25
are 25
in 25
their 25
turn 25
quantities 25
consequently 25
every 25
transition 25
from 25
one 25
state 25
into 25
another 25
is 25
always 25
effected 25
in 25
a 25
time 25
contained 25
between 25
two 25
moments 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
first 25
determines 25
the 25
state 25
which 25
leaves 25
and 25
the 25
second 25
determines 25
the 25
state 25
into 25
the 25
thing 25
passes 25
the 25
thing 25
leaves 25
and 25
the 25
second 25
determines 25
the 25
state 25
into 25
which 25
the 25
thing 25
both 25
moments 25
then 25
are 25
limitations 25
of 25
the 25
time 25
of 25
a 25
change 25
consequently 25
of 25
the 25
intermediate 25
state 25
between 25
both 25
and 25
as 25
such 25
they 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
total 25
of 25
the 25
change 25
now 25
every 25
change 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
which 25
evidences 25
its 25
causality 25
in 25
the 25
whole 25
time 25
during 25
which 25
the 25
charge 25
takes 25
place 25
the 25
cause 25
therefore 25
does 25
not 25
produce 25
the 25
change 25
all 25
at 25
once 25
or 25
in 25
one 25
moment 25
but 25
in 25
a 25
time 25
so 25
that 25
as 25
the 25
time 25
gradually 25
increases 25
from 25
the 25
commencing 25
instant 25
a 25
to 25
its 25
completion 25
at 25
b 25

like 25
manner 25
also 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25

b 25
a 25

generated 25

between 25

is 25
therefore 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
a 25
continuous 25

of 25
the 25
causality 25

in 25
so 25

as 25
it 25
is 25
uniform 25
we 25
call 25
a 25

the 25

does 25
not 25
consist 25
of 25
these 25
momenta 25
but 25
is 25
generated 25
or 25
produced 25
by 25
them 25

their 25

is 25
the 25

of 25
the 25
continuity 25
of 25
all 25
change 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
that 25
neither 25
time 25
itself 25
nor 25
any 25
phenomenon 25
in 25
time 25
consists 25
of 25
parts 25
which 25
are 25
the 25
smallest 25
possible 25
but 25
that 25
notwithstanding 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
passes 25
in 25
the 25
process 25
of 25
a 25
change 25
through 25
all 25
these 25
parts 25
as 25
elements 25
to 25
its 25
second 25
state 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
smallest 25
degree 25
of 25
reality 25
in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
just 25
as 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
smallest 25
degree 25
in 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25

so 25
the 25
new 25
state 25

grows 25
up 25
out 25
of 25

through 25
all 25
the 25
infinite 25

differences 25
of 25
which 25
one 25
from 25

taken 25
all 25
together 25
are 25
less 25

a 25

not 25
our 25
business 25
to 25
inquire 25
here 25
into 25
the 25
utility 25
of 25
this 25
principle 25
in 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25

how 25
such 25
a 25
proposition 25
which 25

to 25
extend 25

knowledge 25
of 25

is 25
possible 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
is 25
indeed 25
a 25
question 25
which 25
deserves 25
investigation 25
although 25
the 25
first 25
view 25
seems 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
truth 25
and 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
and 25
the 25
question 25
how 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
may 25
be 25
considered 25
superfluous 25
for 25
there 25
are 25
so 25
many 25
groundless 25
pretensions 25
to 25
the 25
enlargement 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
take 25
it 25
as 25
a 25
general 25
rule 25
to 25
be 25
mistrustful 25
of 25
all 25
such 25

without 25
a 25
thoroughgoing 25

nothing 25

nothing 25

principle 25
thus 25
i 25
can 25
perceive 25
the 25
moon 25
and 25
then 25
the 25
earth 25
or 25
conversely 25
first 25
the 25
earth 25
and 25
then 25
the 25
moon 25
and 25
for 25
the 25
reason 25
that 25
my 25
perceptions 25
of 25
these 25
objects 25
can 25
reciprocally 25
follow 25
each 25
other 25
i 25
say 25
they 25
exist 25
contemporaneously 25
now 25
coexistence 25
is 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
but 25
time 25
itself 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
perception 25
and 25
therefore 25
we 25
cannot 25
conclude 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
things 25
are 25
placed 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
the 25
other 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
perception 25
of 25
these 25
things 25
can 25
follow 25
each 25
other 25
reciprocally 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
in 25
apprehension 25
would 25
only 25
present 25
to 25
us 25
each 25
of 25
these 25
perceptions 25
as 25
present 25
in 25
the 25
subject 25
when 25
the 25
other 25
is 25
not 25
present 25
and 25
contrariwise 25
but 25
would 25
not 25
show 25
that 25
the 25
objects 25
are 25
coexistent 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
if 25
the 25
one 25
exists 25
the 25
other 25
also 25
exists 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
and 25
that 25
this 25
is 25
necessarily 25
so 25
in 25
order 25
that 25
the 25
perceptions 25
may 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
following 25
each 25
other 25
reciprocally 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
or 25
category 25
of 25
the 25
reciprocal 25
sequence 25
of 25
the 25
determinations 25
of 25
phenomena 25
existing 25
as 25
they 25
do 25
apart 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
yet 25
contemporaneously 25
is 25
requisite 25
to 25
justify 25
us 25
in 25
saying 25
that 25
the 25
reciprocal 25
succession 25
of 25
perceptions 25
has 25
its 25
foundation 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
and 25
to 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
represent 25
coexistence 25
as 25
objective 25
but 25
that 25
relation 25
of 25
substances 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
one 25
contains 25
determinations 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
substance 25
is 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
influence 25
and 25
when 25
this 25
influence 25
is 25
reciprocal 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
community 25
or 25
reciprocity 25
consequently 25
the 25
coexistence 25
of 25
substances 25
in 25
space 25
cannot 25
be 25
cognized 25
in 25
experience 25
otherwise 25
than 25
under 25
the 25
precondition 25
of 25
their 25
reciprocal 25
action 25
this 25
is 25
therefore 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
themselves 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
things 25
are 25
coexistent 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
exist 25
in 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
but 25
how 25
can 25
we 25
know 25
that 25
they 25
exist 25
in 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
only 25
by 25
observing 25
that 25
the 25
order 25
in 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
apprehension 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
is 25
arbitrary 25
and 25
a 25
matter 25
of 25
indifference 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
proceed 25
from 25
a 25
through 25
b 25
c 25
d 25
to 25
e 25
or 25
contrariwise 25
from 25
e 25
to 25
a 25
for 25
if 25
they 25
were 25
successive 25
in 25
time 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
order 25
let 25
us 25
suppose 25
which 25
begins 25
with 25
a 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
impossible 25
for 25
the 25
apprehension 25
in 25
perception 25
to 25
begin 25
with 25
e 25
and 25
go 25
backwards 25
to 25
a 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
a 25
belongs 25
to 25
past 25
time 25
and 25
therefore 25
cannot 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
apprehension 25
let 25
us 25
assume 25
that 25
in 25
a 25
number 25
of 25
substances 25
considered 25
as 25
phenomena 25
each 25
is 25
completely 25
isolated 25
that 25
is 25
that 25
no 25
one 25
acts 25
upon 25
another 25
then 25
i 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
coexistence 25
of 25
these 25
cannot 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
possible 25
perception 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
one 25
cannot 25
by 25
any 25
mode 25
of 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
lead 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
another 25
for 25
we 25
imagine 25
them 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
to 25
be 25
separated 25
by 25
a 25
completely 25
void 25

and 25
thus 25
perception 25
which 25
proceeds 25
from 25
the 25
one 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
in 25

would 25
indeed 25
determine 25
their 25
existence 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
a 25
following 25
perception 25
but 25
would 25
be 25
quite 25
unable 25
to 25
distinguish 25
whether 25
the 25
one 25
phenomenon 25
follows 25
objectively 25
upon 25
the 25
first 25
or 25
is 25
coexistent 25
with 25
it 25
besides 25
the 25
mere 25
fact 25
of 25
existence 25
then 25
there 25
must 25
be 25
something 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
a 25
determines 25
the 25
position 25
of 25

only 25
under 25
this 25

can 25
substances 25
be 25
empirically 25
represented 25
as 25
existing 25
contemporaneously 25

determines 25
the 25

here 25
is 25
by 25
no 25

therefore 25
no 25

the 25
perception 25

the 25

conversely 25
for 25
otherwise 25
succession 25

the 25

of 25
the 25
possibility 25

also 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
things 25
agree 25
with 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
our 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25

this 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
objective 25

all 25
the 25

a 25

be 25
regarded 25
as 25
empty 25

from 25

in 25
this 25

it 25
is 25
called 25
an 25
empirical 25

such 25

the 25

a 25

in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
pure 25
conception 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
nevertheless 25
belongs 25
to 25
experience 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
its 25
object 25
can 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
this 25
alone 25
for 25
where 25
shall 25
we 25
find 25
the 25
criterion 25
or 25
character 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
which 25
is 25
cogitated 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
an 25
a 25

synthetical 25
conception 25
if 25
not 25
in 25

which 25
constitutes 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
that 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
conception 25
no 25
contradiction 25
exists 25
is 25
indeed 25
a 25
necessary 25
logical 25
condition 25
but 25
very 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
sufficient 25
to 25
establish 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
is 25
thought 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
thus 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
figure 25
which 25
is 25
contained 25
within 25
two 25
straight 25
lines 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
contradiction 25
for 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
two 25
straight 25
lines 25
and 25
of 25
their 25
junction 25
contain 25
no 25
negation 25
of 25
a 25
figure 25
the 25
impossibility 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
does 25
not 25
rest 25
upon 25
the 25
conception 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
upon 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
space 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
upon 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
its 25
determinations 25
but 25
these 25
have 25
themselves 25
objective 25
reality 25
that 25
is 25
they 25
apply 25
to 25
possible 25
things 25
because 25
they 25
contain 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
now 25
we 25
shall 25
proceed 25
to 25
point 25
out 25
the 25
extensive 25
utility 25
and 25
influence 25
of 25
this 25
postulate 25
of 25
possibility 25
when 25
i 25
represent 25
to 25
myself 25
a 25
thing 25
that 25
is 25
permanent 25
so 25
that 25
everything 25
in 25
it 25
which 25
changes 25
belongs 25
merely 25
to 25
its 25
state 25
or 25
condition 25
from 25
such 25
a 25
conception 25
alone 25
i 25
never 25
can 25
cognize 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
possible 25
or 25
if 25
i 25
represent 25
to 25
myself 25
something 25
which 25
is 25
so 25
constituted 25
that 25
when 25
it 25
is 25
posited 25
something 25
else 25
follows 25
always 25
and 25
infallibly 25
my 25
thought 25
contains 25
no 25
selfcontradiction 25
but 25
whether 25
such 25
a 25
property 25
as 25
causality 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
any 25
possible 25
thing 25
my 25
thought 25
alone 25
affords 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
judging 25
finally 25
i 25
can 25
represent 25
to 25
myself 25
different 25
things 25
substances 25
which 25
are 25
so 25
constituted 25
that 25
the 25
state 25
or 25
condition 25
of 25
one 25
causes 25
a 25
change 25
in 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
and 25
reciprocally 25
but 25
whether 25
such 25
a 25
relation 25
is 25
a 25
property 25
of 25
things 25
cannot 25
be 25
perceived 25
from 25
these 25
conceptions 25
which 25
contain 25
a 25
merely 25
arbitrary 25
synthesis 25
only 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
therefore 25
that 25
these 25
conceptions 25
express 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
relations 25
of 25
perceptions 25
in 25
every 25
experience 25
do 25
we 25
know 25
that 25
they 25
possess 25
objective 25
reality 25
that 25
is 25
transcendental 25
truth 25
and 25
that 25
independent 25
of 25
experience 25
though 25
not 25
independent 25
of 25
all 25
relation 25
to 25
form 25
of 25
an 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
its 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
in 25
which 25
alone 25
objects 25
can 25
be 25
empirically 25
cognized 25
but 25
when 25
we 25
fashion 25
to 25
ourselves 25
new 25
conceptions 25
of 25
substances 25
forces 25
action 25
and 25
reaction 25
from 25
the 25
material 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
by 25
perception 25
without 25
following 25
the 25
example 25
of 25
experience 25
in 25
their 25
connection 25
we 25
create 25
mere 25
chimeras 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
discover 25
any 25
criterion 25
because 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
taken 25
experience 25
for 25
our 25
instructress 25
though 25
we 25
have 25
borrowed 25
the 25
conceptions 25
from 25
her 25
such 25
fictitious 25
conceptions 25
derive 25
their 25
character 25
of 25
possibility 25
not 25
like 25
the 25
categories 25
a 25
priori 25
as 25
conceptions 25
on 25
which 25
all 25
experience 25
depends 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
posteriori 25
as 25
conceptions 25
given 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
experience 25
itself 25
and 25
their 25
possibility 25
must 25
either 25
be 25
cognized 25
a 25
posteriori 25
and 25
empirically 25
or 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
cognized 25
at 25
all 25
a 25
substance 25
which 25
is 25
permanently 25
present 25
in 25
space 25
yet 25
without 25
filling 25
it 25
like 25
that 25
tertium 25
quid 25
between 25
matter 25
and 25
the 25
thinking 25
subject 25
which 25
some 25
have 25
tried 25
to 25
introduce 25
into 25
metaphysics 25
or 25
a 25
peculiar 25
fundamental 25
power 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
of 25
intuiting 25
the 25
future 25
by 25
anticipation 25
instead 25
of 25
merely 25
inferring 25
from 25
past 25
and 25
present 25
events 25
or 25
finally 25
a 25
power 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
to 25
place 25
itself 25
in 25
community 25
of 25
thought 25
with 25
other 25
men 25
however 25
distant 25
they 25
may 25
bethese 25
are 25
conceptions 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
which 25
has 25
no 25
ground 25
to 25
rest 25
upon 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
based 25
upon 25
experience 25
and 25
its 25
known 25
laws 25
and 25
without 25
experience 25
they 25
are 25
a 25
merely 25
arbitrary 25
conjunction 25
of 25
thoughts 25
which 25
though 25
containing 25
no 25
internal 25
contradiction 25
has 25
no 25
claim 25
to 25
objective 25
reality 25
neither 25
consequently 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
is 25
thought 25
in 25
these 25
conceptions 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
concerns 25
reality 25
it 25
is 25
selfevident 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
cogitate 25
such 25
a 25
possibility 25
in 25
concreto 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experience 25
because 25
reality 25
is 25
concerned 25
only 25
with 25
sensation 25
as 25
the 25
matter 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
not 25
with 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
thought 25
with 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
no 25
doubt 25
indulge 25
in 25
shaping 25
fancies 25
but 25
i 25
pass 25
by 25
everything 25
which 25
derives 25
its 25
possibility 25
from 25
reality 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
i 25
purpose 25
treating 25
here 25
merely 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
i 25
maintain 25
then 25
that 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
is 25
not 25
derived 25
from 25
such 25
conceptions 25
per 25
se 25
but 25
only 25
when 25
considered 25
as 25
formal 25
and 25
objective 25
conditions 25
of 25
an 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
it 25
seems 25
indeed 25
as 25
if 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
triangle 25
could 25
be 25
cognized 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
alone 25
which 25
is 25
certainly 25
independent 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
we 25
can 25
certainly 25
give 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
a 25
corresponding 25
object 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
can 25
construct 25
it 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
triangle 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
it 25
must 25
remain 25
a 25
mere 25
product 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
and 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
corresponding 25
to 25
it 25
must 25
remain 25
doubtful 25
unless 25
we 25
can 25
discover 25
some 25
other 25
ground 25
unless 25
we 25
know 25
that 25
the 25
figure 25
can 25
be 25
cogitated 25
under 25
the 25
conditions 25
upon 25
which 25
all 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
rest 25
now 25
the 25
facts 25
that 25
space 25
is 25
a 25
formal 25
condition 25
a 25
priori 25
of 25
external 25
experience 25
that 25
the 25
formative 25
synthesis 25
by 25
which 25
we 25
construct 25
a 25
triangle 25
in 25
imagination 25
is 25
the 25
very 25
same 25
as 25
that 25
we 25
employ 25
in 25
the 25
apprehension 25
of 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
making 25
an 25
empirical 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
are 25
what 25
alone 25
connect 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
thing 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
manner 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
continuous 25
quantities 25
indeed 25
of 25
quantities 25
in 25
general 25
for 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
them 25
are 25
without 25
exception 25
synthetical 25
is 25
never 25
evident 25
from 25
the 25
conceptions 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
only 25
when 25
they 25
are 25
considered 25
as 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
objects 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
where 25
indeed 25
should 25
we 25
look 25
for 25
objects 25
to 25
correspond 25
to 25
our 25
conceptions 25
if 25
not 25
in 25
experience 25
by 25
which 25
alone 25
objects 25
are 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
it 25
is 25
however 25
true 25
that 25
without 25
antecedent 25
experience 25
we 25
can 25
cognize 25
and 25
characterize 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25

all 25
determination 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
time 25
presupposes 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
something 25
permanent 25
in 25
perception 25
but 25
this 25
permanent 25
something 25
cannot 25
be 25
something 25
in 25
me 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
my 25
existence 25
in 25
time 25
is 25
itself 25
determined 25
by 25
this 25

something 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
the 25
perception 25
of 25
this 25
permanent 25
existence 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
a 25
thing 25
without 25
me 25
and 25
not 25
through 25
the 25
mere 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
without 25
me 25
consequently 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
in 25
time 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
real 25
things 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
now 25
consciousness 25
in 25

necessarily 25
connected 25
with 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
this 25
determination 25
in 25
time 25
hence 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
consciousness 25
in 25
time 25
is 25
necessarily 25
connected 25
also 25
with 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
without 25
me 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
these 25
things 25
is 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
determination 25
in 25
time 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
own 25
existence 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
an 25
immediate 25
consciousness 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
other 25
things 25
without 25
me 25
remark 25
i 25
the 25
reader 25
will 25
observe 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
foregoing 25
proof 25
the 25
game 25
which 25
idealism 25
plays 25
is 25
retorted 25
upon 25
itself 25
and 25
with 25
more 25
justice 25
it 25
assumed 25
that 25
the 25
only 25
immediate 25
experience 25
is 25
internal 25
and 25
that 25
from 25
this 25
we 25
can 25
only 25
infer 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
external 25
things 25
but 25
as 25
always 25
happens 25
when 25
we 25
reason 25
from 25
given 25
effects 25
to 25
determined 25
causes 25
idealism 25
has 25
reasoned 25
with 25
too 25
much 25
haste 25
and 25
uncertainty 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
possible 25
that 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
our 25
representations 25
may 25
lie 25
in 25
ourselves 25
and 25
that 25
we 25
ascribe 25
it 25
falsely 25
to 25
external 25
things 25
but 25
our 25
proof 25
shows 25
that 25
external 25
experience 25
is 25
properly 25
immediate 25
that 25
only 25
by 25
virtue 25
of 25
itnot 25
indeed 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
our 25
own 25
existence 25

certainly 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
our 25
existence 25
in 25
time 25
that 25
is 25
internal 25
experienceis 25
possible 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
that 25
the 25
representation 25
i 25
am 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
expression 25
of 25
the 25
consciousness 25
which 25
can 25
accompany 25
all 25
my 25
thoughts 25
is 25
that 25
which 25
immediately 25
includes 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
subject 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
representation 25
we 25
cannot 25
find 25
any 25
knowledge 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
and 25
therefore 25
also 25
no 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
that 25
is 25
experience 25
for 25
experience 25
contains 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
the 25
thought 25
of 25
something 25
existing 25
intuition 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
internal 25
intuition 25
that 25
is 25
time 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
subject 25
must 25
be 25
determined 25
but 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
external 25
things 25
is 25
absolutely 25
requisite 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
so 25
that 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
internal 25
experience 25
is 25
itself 25
possible 25
only 25
mediately 25
and 25

we 25
an 25

no 25

is 25
our 25

already 25
possess 25

for 25
merely 25
to 25
imagine 25
also 25
an 25

annihilate 25
the 25

supported 25
by 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25

possible 25
to 25
perceive 25
a 25

this 25

find 25
that 25
we 25
possess 25
nothing 25
permanent 25

from 25

that 25
the 25

not 25
follow 25
that 25
every 25
intuitive 25
representation 25
of 25
external 25

involves 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
these 25

their 25

may 25
very 25
well 25
be 25
the 25

previous 25

the 25
sole 25
aim 25
of 25
our 25
remarks 25
has 25
however 25
been 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
internal 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
external 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
whether 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
supposed 25
experience 25
be 25
purely 25
imaginary 25
must 25
be 25
discovered 25
from 25
its 25
particular 25
determinations 25
and 25
by 25
comparing 25
these 25
with 25
the 25
criteria 25
of 25
all 25
real 25
experience 25
finally 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
third 25
postulate 25
it 25
applies 25
to 25
material 25
necessity 25
in 25
existence 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
merely 25
formal 25
and 25
logical 25
necessity 25
in 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
conceptions 25
now 25
as 25
we 25

the 25

any 25

we 25
can 25
do 25
so 25
comparatively 25
a 25

that 25
is 25
relatively 25
to 25
some 25

only 25
be 25

be 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
complex 25
of 25

of 25
which 25
the 25
previously 25
given 25
perception 25
is 25
a 25
partthe 25
necessity 25
of 25
existence 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
cognized 25
from 25
conceptions 25
but 25
always 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
from 25
its 25
connection 25
with 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
perception 25
but 25
the 25
only 25
existence 25
cognized 25
under 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
other 25
given 25
phenomena 25
as 25

is 25
the 25
existence 25

given 25
causes 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
causality 25
it 25
is 25
consequently 25
not 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
substances 25
but 25
the 25
necessity 25

the 25
state 25
of 25
things 25
that 25
we 25
cognize 25

that 25
not 25
immediately 25
but 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25

given 25
in 25
perception 25
according 25
to 25
empirical 25
laws 25
of 25
causality 25
hence 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
the 25
criterion 25
of 25
necessity 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
law 25
of 25

everything 25
which 25
happens 25
is 25
determined 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
by 25
its 25
cause 25
thus 25
we 25
cognize 25
only 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25

in 25
nature 25
the 25
causes 25
of 25

are 25
given 25
us 25
moreover 25
the 25
criterion 25
of 25
necessity 25
in 25
existence 25
possesses 25
no 25
application 25
beyond 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
even 25
in 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
valid 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
substances 25
because 25
these 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
empirical 25
effects 25
or 25
as 25
something 25
that 25
happens 25
and 25
has 25
a 25
beginning 25
necessity 25
therefore 25
regards 25
only 25
the 25
relations 25
of 25
phenomena 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
dynamical 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
and 25
the 25
possibility 25
grounded 25
thereon 25
of 25
reasoning 25
from 25
some 25
given 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25

a 25

to 25
another 25

everything 25
that 25

hypothetically 25

a 25
principle 25
which 25
subjects 25
the 25

the 25

to 25

as 25
all 25
principles 25

we 25
could 25
very 25
easily 25
exhibit 25
in 25
their 25
proper 25
order 25
that 25

in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25

assign 25
to 25
each 25
its 25
proper 25
place 25

the 25
already 25
practised 25
reader 25
will 25
do 25
this 25
for 25
himself 25

discover 25
the 25
clue 25
to 25
such 25
an 25
arrangement 25
but 25
the 25
combined 25
result 25
of 25
all 25
is 25
simply 25
this 25
to 25
admit 25
into 25
the 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
nothing 25
which 25
might 25
cause 25
a 25
break 25
in 25

be 25
foreign 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25

the 25
continuous 25
connection 25
of 25
all 25

the 25
unity 25
of 25

all 25

enough 25
questions 25

the 25

a 25
single 25

every 25

even 25
if 25

they 25
would 25
still 25
not 25
belong 25

is 25
the 25
only 25
mode 25
of 25

consequently 25
whether 25
some 25
other 25
sphere 25
of 25

the 25
understanding 25
has 25
no 25
power 25
to 25
decide 25
its 25
proper 25
occupation 25
being 25
with 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
that 25

moreover 25
the 25
poverty 25
of 25
the 25
usual 25
arguments 25
which 25
go 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
vast 25
sphere 25
of 25
possibility 25
of 25
which 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
real 25
every 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
is 25
but 25
a 25
small 25
part 25
is 25
very 25
remarkable 25
all 25
real 25
is 25
possible 25
from 25
this 25
follows 25
naturally 25
according 25

of 25

the 25
particular 25
proposition 25

real 25
now 25
this 25
seems 25
to 25
be 25
equivalent 25
to 25
much 25
is 25
possible 25
that 25
is 25
not 25
real 25
no 25
doubt 25
it 25
does 25
seem 25
as 25
if 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
consider 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
the 25
possible 25
to 25
be 25
greater 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
real 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
something 25
must 25
be 25
added 25
to 25
the 25
former 25
to 25
constitute 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
this 25
notion 25
of 25
adding 25
to 25
the 25
possible 25
is 25
absurd 25
for 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
in 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
the 25
possible 25
and 25
consequently 25
requires 25
to 25
be 25
added 25
to 25
it 25
is 25
manifestly 25
impossible 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
understanding 25
requires 25
a 25
connection 25
with 25
some 25
perception 25
but 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
connected 25
with 25
this 25
perception 25
is 25
real 25
even 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
immediately 25
perceived 25
but 25
that 25
another 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
in 25
complete 25
coherence 25
with 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
perception 25
consequently 25
more 25
than 25
one 25
allembracing 25
experience 25
is 25
possible 25
is 25
an 25
inference 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
concluded 25
from 25
the 25
data 25
given 25
us 25
by 25
experience 25
and 25
still 25
less 25
without 25
any 25
data 25
at 25
all 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
under 25
conditions 25
which 25
are 25
themselves 25
merely 25
possible 25
is 25
not 25
possible 25
in 25
any 25
respect 25
and 25
yet 25
we 25
can 25
find 25
no 25
more 25
certain 25
ground 25
on 25
which 25
to 25
base 25
the 25
discussion 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
whether 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
possibility 25
is 25
wider 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
experience 25
i 25
have 25
merely 25
mentioned 25
these 25
questions 25
that 25
in 25
treating 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
there 25
might 25
be 25
no 25
omission 25
of 25
anything 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
common 25
opinion 25
belongs 25
to 25
them 25
in 25
reality 25
however 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
absolute 25
possibility 25
possibility 25
which 25
is 25
valid 25
in 25
every 25
respect 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
employed 25
empirically 25
but 25
belongs 25
to 25
reason 25
alone 25
which 25
passes 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
all 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
we 25
have 25
therefore 25
contented 25
ourselves 25
with 25
a 25
merely 25
critical 25
remark 25
leaving 25
the 25
subject 25
to 25
be 25
explained 25
in 25
the 25
sequel 25
before 25

some 25

its 25

by 25
which 25
we 25
present 25
an 25

do 25
not 25
augment 25
the 25

the 25

do 25
really 25
think 25

on 25
the 25
system 25

principles 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
remarkable 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
perceive 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
from 25

alone 25

must 25
always 25
have 25
an 25
intuition 25
by 25
which 25
to 25
make 25
evident 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
categories 25
of 25
relation 25
how 25
a 25
thing 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
subject 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
a 25
mere 25
determination 25
of 25
other 25
things 25
that 25
is 25
can 25
be 25
substance 25
or 25
how 25
because 25
something 25
exists 25
some 25
other 25
thing 25
must 25
exist 25
consequently 25
how 25
a 25
thing 25
can 25
be 25
a 25
cause 25
or 25
how 25
when 25
several 25
things 25
exist 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
one 25
of 25
these 25
things 25
exists 25
some 25
consequence 25
to 25
the 25
others 25
follows 25
and 25
reciprocally 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
a 25
community 25
of 25
substances 25
can 25
be 25
possibleare 25
questions 25
whose 25
solution 25
cannot 25
be 25
obtained 25
from 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
the 25
very 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
other 25
categories 25
for 25
example 25
how 25
a 25
thing 25
can 25
be 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
sort 25
with 25
many 25
others 25
that 25
is 25
can 25
be 25
a 25
quantity 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
intuition 25
we 25
cannot 25
know 25
whether 25
we 25
do 25
really 25
think 25
an 25
object 25
by 25
the 25
categories 25
and 25
where 25
an 25
object 25
can 25
anywhere 25
be 25
found 25
to 25
cohere 25
with 25
them 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
truth 25
is 25
established 25
that 25
the 25
categories 25
are 25
not 25
in 25
themselves 25
cognitions 25
but 25
mere 25
forms 25
of 25
thought 25
for 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
cognitions 25
from 25
given 25
intuitions 25
for 25
the 25
same 25
reason 25
is 25
it 25
true 25
that 25
from 25
categories 25
alone 25
no 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
can 25
be 25
made 25
for 25
example 25
in 25
every 25
existence 25
there 25
is 25
substance 25
that 25
is 25
something 25
that 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
subject 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
mere 25
predicate 25
or 25
everything 25
is 25
a 25
quantityto 25
construct 25
propositions 25
such 25
as 25
these 25
we 25
require 25
something 25
to 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
go 25
out 25
beyond 25
the 25
given 25
conception 25
and 25
connect 25
another 25
with 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
same 25
reason 25
the 25
attempt 25
to 25
prove 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
for 25
example 25
everything 25
that 25
exists 25
contingently 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
has 25
never 25
succeeded 25
we 25
could 25
never 25
get 25
further 25
than 25
proving 25
that 25
without 25
this 25
relation 25
to 25
conceptions 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
conceive 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
contingent 25
that 25
is 25
could 25
not 25
a 25
priori 25
through 25
the 25
understanding 25
cognize 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
thing 25
but 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
hence 25
follow 25
that 25
this 25
is 25
also 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
said 25
to 25
be 25
contingent 25
if 25
accordingly 25
we 25
look 25
back 25
to 25
our 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
we 25
were 25
able 25
to 25
prove 25
it 25
as 25
valid 25
only 25
of 25
objects 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
indeed 25
only 25
as 25
itself 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
consequently 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
given 25
in 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
and 25
not 25
from 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
that 25
however 25
the 25
proposition 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25
contingent 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
cause 25
is 25
evident 25
to 25
every 25
one 25
merely 25
from 25
conceptions 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
denied 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
contingent 25
is 25
cogitated 25
as 25
involving 25
not 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
modality 25
as 25
that 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
conceived 25
but 25
that 25
of 25
relation 25
as 25
that 25
which 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
the 25
consequence 25
of 25
something 25
else 25
and 25
so 25
it 25
is 25
really 25
an 25
identical 25
proposition 25
that 25
which 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
consequence 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
in 25
fact 25
when 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
give 25
examples 25
of 25
contingent 25
existence 25
we 25
always 25
refer 25
to 25
changes 25
and 25
not 25
merely 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
conceiving 25
the 25
opposite 25
but 25
change 25
is 25
an 25
event 25
which 25
as 25
such 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
a 25
cause 25
and 25
considered 25
per 25
se 25
its 25
nonexistence 25
is 25
therefore 25
possible 25
and 25
we 25
become 25
cognizant 25
of 25
its 25
contingency 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
the 25
effect 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
hence 25
if 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
assumed 25
to 25
be 25
contingent 25
it 25
is 25
an 25
analytical 25
proposition 25
to 25
say 25
it 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
footnote 25
we 25
can 25
easily 25
conceive 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
matter 25
but 25
the 25
ancients 25
did 25
not 25
thence 25
infer 25
its 25
contingency 25
but 25
even 25
the 25
alternation 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
and 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
a 25
given 25
state 25
in 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
which 25
all 25
change 25
consists 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
proves 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
that 25
statethe 25
ground 25
of 25
proof 25
being 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
its 25
opposite 25
for 25
example 25
a 25
body 25
is 25
in 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
rest 25
after 25
motion 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
infer 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
the 25
motion 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
for 25
this 25
opposite 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
logical 25
and 25
not 25
a 25
real 25
opposite 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
if 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
the 25
motion 25
what 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
prove 25
is 25
that 25
instead 25
of 25
the 25
motion 25
which 25
took 25
place 25
in 25
the 25
preceding 25
point 25
of 25
time 25
it 25
was 25
possible 25
for 25
the 25
body 25
to 25
have 25
been 25
then 25
in 25
rest 25
not 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
afterwards 25
in 25
rest 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
both 25
opposites 25
are 25
perfectly 25
consistent 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
still 25
more 25
remarkable 25
that 25
to 25
understand 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
categories 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
we 25
require 25
not 25
merely 25
intuitions 25

external 25
intuitions 25

take 25
the 25
pure 25

find 25
that 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25

the 25
conception 25

of 25
demonstrating 25
the 25
objective 25

of 25
this 25
conception 25
we 25
require 25
an 25

consequently 25

in 25

the 25
proper 25
ground 25
of 25
this 25
fact 25
is 25
that 25
all 25
change 25

be 25
perceived 25
as 25
change 25
presupposes 25
something 25
permanent 25

sense 25
no 25

is 25

lastly 25
the 25
objective 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
category 25
of 25

cannot 25
be 25
conceived 25
by 25
mere 25
reason 25
and 25
consequently 25
its 25
objective 25
reality 25
cannot 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
without 25
an 25
intuition 25
and 25
that 25
external 25
in 25
space 25
for 25
how 25
can 25
we 25
conceive 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
community 25
that 25
is 25
when 25
several 25
substances 25
exist 25
that 25
some 25
effect 25
on 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
follows 25
from 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
and 25
reciprocally 25
and 25
therefore 25
that 25
because 25
something 25
exists 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
something 25
else 25
must 25
exist 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
understood 25
from 25
its 25
own 25
existence 25
alone 25
for 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
very 25
essence 25
of 25
communitywhich 25
is 25
inconceivable 25
as 25
a 25
property 25
of 25
things 25
which 25
are 25
perfectly 25
isolated 25

cogitated 25
by 25
the 25

alonea 25
community 25

the 25
mediating 25
aid 25
of 25
a 25

from 25
their 25

such 25
a 25

to 25
him 25
with 25
justice 25
inconceivable 25
but 25
we 25
can 25
very 25

conceive 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
community 25
of 25

if 25
we 25

ourselves 25
as 25

it 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
that 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
quantities 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
quantity 25
can 25
be 25
grounded 25
only 25
in 25
external 25
intuition 25
and 25
that 25
by 25
its 25
means 25

to 25
ask 25
ourselves 25
firstly 25
whether 25
we 25
cannot 25
rest 25
perfectly 25
contented 25
with 25
what 25
it 25
contains 25
or 25
whether 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
of 25
necessity 25
be 25
contented 25
with 25
it 25
if 25
we 25
can 25
find 25
nowhere 25
else 25
a 25
solid 25
foundation 25
to 25
build 25
upon 25
and 25
secondly 25
by 25
what 25
title 25
we 25
possess 25
this 25
land 25
itself 25
and 25
how 25
we 25
hold 25
it 25
secure 25
against 25
all 25
hostile 25
claims 25
although 25
in 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
our 25
analytic 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
given 25
sufficient 25
answers 25
to 25
these 25
questions 25
yet 25
a 25
summary 25
recapitulation 25
of 25
these 25
solutions 25
may 25
be 25
useful 25
in 25
strengthening 25
our 25
conviction 25
by 25
uniting 25
in 25
one 25
point 25
the 25
momenta 25
of 25
the 25
arguments 25
we 25
have 25
seen 25

everything 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
draws 25
from 25
itself 25
without 25
borrowing 25
from 25
experience 25

nevertheless 25

only 25
for 25
the 25
behoof 25
and 25
use 25
of 25

the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
whether 25
constitutive 25
a 25
priori 25
as 25
the 25
mathematical 25
principles 25
or 25
merely 25
regulative 25
as 25
the 25

nothing 25
but 25
the 25

schema 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
for 25
experience 25
possesses 25
its 25
unity 25
from 25
the 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
originally 25
and 25
from 25
itself 25
imparts 25
to 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
imagination 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25

in 25
a 25
priori 25
relation 25
to 25
and 25
agreement 25
with 25
which 25
phenomena 25
as 25
data 25
for 25
a 25
possible 25
cognition 25
must 25
stand 25
but 25
although 25
these 25
rules 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
are 25
not 25
only 25
a 25
priori 25
true 25
but 25
the 25
very 25
source 25
of 25
all 25
truth 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
the 25
accordance 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
with 25
objects 25
and 25
on 25
this 25
ground 25
that 25
they 25
contain 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
as 25
the 25
ensemble 25
of 25
all 25
cognition 25
it 25
seems 25
to 25
us 25
not 25
enough 25
to 25
propound 25
what 25
is 25
truewe 25
desire 25
also 25
to 25
be 25
told 25
what 25
we 25
want 25
to 25
know 25
if 25
then 25
we 25
learn 25
nothing 25
more 25
by 25
this 25
critical 25
examination 25
than 25
what 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
practised 25
in 25
the 25
merely 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
without 25
any 25
such 25
subtle 25
inquiry 25
the 25
presumption 25
is 25
that 25
the 25
advantage 25
we 25
reap 25
from 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
worth 25
the 25
labour 25
bestowed 25
upon 25
it 25
it 25
may 25
certainly 25
be 25
answered 25
that 25
no 25
rash 25
curiosity 25
is 25
more 25
prejudicial 25
to 25
the 25
enlargement 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
than 25
that 25
which 25
must 25
know 25
beforehand 25
the 25
utility 25
of 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
piece 25
of 25
information 25
which 25
we 25
seek 25
before 25
we 25
have 25
entered 25
on 25
the 25
needful 25
investigations 25
and 25
before 25
one 25
could 25
form 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
of 25
its 25
utility 25
even 25
though 25
it 25
were 25
placed 25
before 25
our 25
eyes 25
but 25
there 25
is 25
one 25
advantage 25
in 25
such 25
transcendental 25
inquiries 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
made 25
comprehensible 25
to 25
the 25
dullest 25
and 25
most 25
reluctant 25
learnerthis 25
namely 25
that 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
is 25
occupied 25
merely 25
with 25
empirical 25
exercise 25
and 25
does 25
not 25
reflect 25
on 25
the 25
sources 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
cognition 25
may 25
exercise 25
its 25
functions 25
very 25
well 25
and 25
very 25
successfully 25
but 25
is 25
quite 25
unable 25
to 25
do 25
one 25
thing 25
and 25
that 25
of 25
very 25
great 25
importance 25
to 25
determine 25
namely 25
the 25
bounds 25
that 25
limit 25
its 25
employment 25
and 25
to 25
know 25
what 25
lies 25
within 25
or 25
without 25
its 25
own 25
sphere 25
this 25
purpose 25
can 25
be 25
obtained 25
only 25
by 25
such 25
profound 25
investigations 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
instituted 25
but 25
if 25
it 25
cannot 25
distinguish 25
whether 25
certain 25
questions 25
lie 25
within 25
its 25
horizon 25
or 25
not 25
it 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
sure 25
either 25
as 25
to 25
its 25
claims 25
or 25
possessions 25
but 25
must 25
lay 25
its 25
account 25
with 25
many 25
humiliating 25
corrections 25
when 25
it 25
transgresses 25
as 25
it 25
unavoidably 25
will 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
territory 25
and 25
loses 25
itself 25
in 25
fanciful 25
opinions 25
and 25
blinding 25
illusions 25

from 25

us 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25

only 25
one 25

although 25
all 25
these 25
principles 25

which 25
this 25
science 25

generated 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
entirely 25
a 25

would 25
nevertheless 25
have 25
no 25
significance 25
if 25
we 25
were 25
not 25
always 25
able 25
to 25
exhibit 25
their 25
significance 25
in 25
and 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
phenomena 25
empirical 25
objects 25
hence 25
it 25
is 25
requisite 25
that 25
an 25
abstract 25
conception 25
be 25
made 25
sensuous 25
that 25
is 25
that 25
an 25
object 25
corresponding 25
to 25
it 25
in 25
intuition 25
be 25
forthcoming 25
otherwise 25
the 25
conception 25
remains 25
as 25
we 25
say 25
without 25
sense 25
that 25
is 25
without 25
meaning 25
mathematics 25
fulfils 25
this 25
requirement 25
by 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
the 25
figure 25
which 25
is 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
evident 25
to 25
the 25
senses 25
the 25
same 25
science 25
finds 25
support 25
and 25
significance 25
in 25
number 25
this 25
in 25
its 25
turn 25
finds 25
it 25
in 25
the 25

or 25
in 25
counters 25
or 25
in 25
lines 25
and 25

the 25
conception 25
itself 25
is 25
always 25
produced 25
a 25
priori 25
together 25
with 25
the 25
synthetical 25
principles 25
or 25
formulas 25
from 25
such 25
conceptions 25
but 25
the 25
proper 25
employment 25
of 25
them 25
and 25
their 25
application 25
to 25
objects 25
can 25
exist 25
nowhere 25
but 25
in 25

the 25
possibility 25

which 25
as 25
regards 25
its 25
form 25
they 25
contain 25
a 25

that 25
this 25
is 25
also 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
all 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
and 25
the 25
principles 25
based 25
upon 25
them 25
is 25
evident 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
render 25
intelligible 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
corresponding 25
to 25
them 25
without 25
having 25
recourse 25
to 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensibility 25
consequently 25
to 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
phenomena 25
to 25
which 25
as 25
their 25
only 25
proper 25
objects 25
their 25
use 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
confined 25

as 25
if 25
this 25
condition 25
is 25
removed 25
all 25
significance 25
that 25
is 25
all 25

an 25

and 25
no 25
example 25
can 25
be 25
found 25
to 25
make 25
it 25
comprehensible 25
what 25
sort 25
of 25
things 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
think 25
under 25
such 25
conceptions 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
quantity 25
cannot 25
be 25
explained 25
except 25
by 25
saying 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
whereby 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
cogitated 25
how 25
many 25
times 25
one 25
is 25
placed 25
in 25
it 25
but 25
this 25
how 25
many 25
times 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
successive 25
repetition 25
consequently 25
upon 25
time 25
and 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
homogeneous 25
therein 25
reality 25
in 25
contradistinction 25
to 25
negation 25
can 25
be 25
explained 25
only 25
by 25
cogitating 25
a 25
time 25
which 25
is 25
either 25
filled 25
therewith 25
or 25
is 25
void 25
if 25
i 25
leave 25
out 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
permanence 25
which 25
is 25
existence 25
in 25
all 25
time 25
there 25
remains 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substance 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
logical 25
notion 25
of 25
subject 25
a 25
notion 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
endeavour 25
to 25
realize 25
by 25
representing 25
to 25
myself 25
something 25
that 25
can 25
exist 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
subject 25
but 25
not 25
only 25
am 25
i 25
perfectly 25
ignorant 25
of 25
any 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
this 25
logical 25
prerogative 25
can 25
belong 25
to 25
a 25
thing 25
i 25
can 25
make 25
nothing 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
notion 25
and 25
draw 25
no 25
inference 25
from 25
it 25
because 25
no 25
object 25
to 25
which 25
to 25
apply 25
the 25
conception 25
is 25
determined 25
and 25
we 25
consequently 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
whether 25
it 25
has 25
any 25
meaning 25
at 25
all 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
if 25
i 25
leave 25
out 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
something 25
follows 25
upon 25
some 25
other 25
thing 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
i 25
can 25
find 25
nothing 25
in 25
the 25
pure 25
category 25
except 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
something 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
sort 25
that 25
from 25
it 25
a 25
conclusion 25
may 25
be 25
drawn 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
some 25
other 25
thing 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
only 25
be 25
impossible 25
to 25
distinguish 25
between 25
a 25
cause 25
and 25
an 25
effect 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
power 25
to 25
draw 25
conclusions 25
requires 25
conditions 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
quite 25
ignorant 25
the 25
conception 25

not 25
determined 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
mode 25

it 25

principle 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25
contingent 25

a 25
cause 25
comes 25
with 25
a 25
gravity 25
and 25
selfassumed 25
authority 25
that 25
seems 25
to 25
require 25
no 25
support 25
from 25
without 25
but 25
i 25
ask 25
what 25
is 25
meant 25
by 25
contingent 25
the 25
answer 25
is 25
that 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
possible 25
but 25
i 25
should 25
like 25
very 25
well 25
to 25
know 25
by 25
what 25
means 25
this 25
possibility 25
of 25
nonexistence 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
cognized 25
if 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
represent 25
to 25
ourselves 25
a 25
succession 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
succession 25
an 25
existence 25
which 25
follows 25
a 25
nonexistence 25
or 25
conversely 25
consequently 25
change 25
for 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
not 25
selfcontradictory 25
is 25
a 25
lame 25
appeal 25
to 25
a 25
logical 25
condition 25
which 25
is 25
no 25
doubt 25
a 25
necessary 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
is 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
sufficient 25
for 25
the 25
real 25
objective 25
possibility 25
of 25
nonexistence 25
i 25
can 25
annihilate 25
in 25
thought 25
every 25
existing 25
substance 25
without 25
selfcontradiction 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
infer 25
from 25
this 25
their 25
objective 25
contingency 25
in 25
existence 25
that 25
is 25

entirely 25
from 25

accordingly 25

it 25

advisable 25
therefore 25
to 25
express 25
ourselves 25
thus 25
the 25
pure 25
categories 25
apart 25
from 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensibility 25
have 25
a 25
merely 25
transcendental 25
meaning 25
but 25
are 25
nevertheless 25
not 25

because 25
this 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
impossible 25

as 25
all 25
the 25

absent 25
to 25

therefore 25
in 25
the 25
character 25

be 25

at 25
all 25
when 25
separated 25

to 25
determine 25
any 25

there 25
lurks 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
this 25
subject 25
an 25
illusion 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
difficult 25
to 25
avoid 25
the 25
categories 25
are 25
not 25
based 25
as 25

their 25
origin 25
upon 25

like 25
the 25
forms 25

they 25
seem 25
therefore 25
to 25
be 25

an 25
application 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
sensuous 25
objects 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
case 25
they 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
mere 25
forms 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
contain 25
only 25
the 25
logical 25
faculty 25
of 25
uniting 25
a 25
priori 25
in 25
consciousness 25
the 25
manifold 25
given 25
in 25
intuition 25
apart 25
then 25
from 25
the 25
only 25
intuition 25
possible 25
for 25
us 25
they 25
have 25
still 25
less 25
meaning 25
than 25
the 25
pure 25
sensuous 25
forms 25

and 25
time 25
for 25
through 25
them 25
an 25
object 25
is 25
at 25
least 25
given 25
while 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25
manifold 25
when 25
the 25
intuition 25
which 25
alone 25
gives 25
the 25
manifold 25
is 25
wanting 25
has 25
no 25
meaning 25
at 25
all 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
when 25
we 25
designate 25
certain 25
objects 25
as 25
phenomena 25
or 25
sensuous 25
existences 25
thus 25
distinguishing 25
our 25
mode 25
of 25
intuiting 25
them 25
from 25
their 25
own 25
nature 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
by 25
this 25
very 25
distinction 25
we 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
place 25
the 25
latter 25
considered 25
in 25
this 25
their 25
own 25
nature 25
although 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
so 25
intuite 25
them 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
the 25
former 25
or 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
do 25
so 25
place 25
other 25
possible 25
things 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
objects 25
of 25
our 25
senses 25
but 25
are 25
cogitated 25
by 25
the 25
understanding 25
alone 25
and 25
call 25
them 25
intelligible 25
existences 25
noumena 25
now 25
the 25
question 25
arises 25
whether 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
our 25
understanding 25
do 25
possess 25
significance 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
these 25
latter 25
and 25
may 25
possibly 25
be 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
cognizing 25
them 25
but 25
we 25
are 25
met 25
at 25
the 25
very 25
commencement 25
with 25
an 25
ambiguity 25
which 25
may 25
easily 25
occasion 25
great 25
misapprehension 25
the 25
understanding 25
when 25
it 25
terms 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
a 25
certain 25
relation 25
phenomenon 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
forms 25
out 25
of 25
this 25
relation 25
a 25
representation 25
or 25
notion 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
hence 25
believes 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
form 25
also 25
conceptions 25
of 25
such 25
objects 25
now 25
as 25
the 25
understanding 25
possesses 25
no 25
other 25
fundamental 25
conceptions 25
besides 25
the 25
categories 25
it 25
takes 25
for 25
granted 25
that 25
an 25
object 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
must 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
being 25
thought 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
these 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
and 25
is 25
thereby 25
led 25
to 25
hold 25
the 25
perfectly 25
undetermined 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
intelligible 25
existence 25
a 25
something 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
sensibility 25
for 25
a 25
determinate 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
existence 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
cognize 25
in 25
some 25
way 25
or 25
other 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
if 25
by 25
the 25
term 25
noumenon 25
we 25
understand 25
a 25
thing 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
our 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
thus 25
making 25
abstraction 25
of 25
our 25
mode 25
of 25
intuiting 25
it 25
this 25
is 25
a 25
noumenon 25
in 25
the 25
negative 25
sense 25
of 25
the 25
word 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
understand 25
by 25
it 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
a 25
nonsensuous 25
intuition 25
we 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
assume 25
a 25
peculiar 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
an 25
intellectual 25
intuition 25
to 25

which 25
does 25
not 25
however 25
belong 25
to 25
us 25

the 25
very 25
possibility 25

we 25

no 25

this 25
is 25

the 25
positive 25
sense 25
the 25
doctrine 25

also 25
the 25
doctrine 25

negative 25
sense 25

not 25

themselves 25

the 25

at 25
the 25

comprehends 25
that 25
it 25

employ 25
its 25
categories 25
for 25
the 25
consideration 25

as 25
mere 25
forms 25
of 25

not 25
extend 25
to 25
these 25
what 25
therefore 25
we 25
call 25
noumenon 25

i 25

thought 25
by 25

there 25
remains 25
no 25
cognition 25

such 25
an 25

not 25
follow 25

representation 25
has 25
any 25

if 25
i 25
take 25
away 25
all 25
intuition 25
there 25
still 25
remains 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
thought 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
determining 25
an 25
object 25
for 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
intuition 25
thus 25
the 25
categories 25
do 25
in 25
some 25
measure 25
really 25
extend 25
further 25
than 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
think 25
objects 25
in 25
general 25
without 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
sensibility 25
in 25
which 25
these 25

are 25
given 25
but 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
apply 25
to 25
and 25
determine 25
a 25
wider 25
sphere 25
of 25
objects 25
because 25
we 25
cannot 25
assume 25
that 25
such 25
can 25
be 25
given 25
without 25
presupposing 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
another 25
than 25
the 25
sensuous 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
a 25
supposition 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
justified 25
in 25
making 25
i 25
call 25
a 25
conception 25
problematical 25
which 25
contains 25
in 25
itself 25
no 25
contradiction 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
connected 25
with 25
other 25
cognitions 25
as 25
a 25
limitation 25
of 25
given 25
conceptions 25
but 25
whose 25
objective 25
reality 25
cannot 25
be 25
cognized 25
in 25
any 25
manner 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
noumenon 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
cogitated 25
not 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
sense 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
solely 25
through 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
is 25
not 25
selfcontradictory 25
for 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
entitled 25
to 25
maintain 25
that 25
sensibility 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
possible 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
nay 25
further 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
restrain 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
within 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
limit 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
sensuous 25
cognition 25
for 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
which 25
lie 25
beyond 25
its 25
province 25
are 25
called 25
noumena 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
purpose 25
of 25
indicating 25
that 25
this 25
cognition 25
does 25
not 25
extend 25
its 25
application 25
to 25
all 25
that 25
the 25
understanding 25
thinks 25
but 25
after 25
all 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
noumena 25
is 25
quite 25
incomprehensible 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
phenomena 25
all 25
is 25
for 25
us 25
a 25
mere 25
void 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
possess 25
an 25
understanding 25
whose 25
province 25
does 25
problematically 25
extend 25
beyond 25
this 25
sphere 25
but 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
possess 25
an 25
intuition 25
indeed 25
not 25
even 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
intuition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
objects 25
beyond 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
sensibility 25
could 25
be 25
given 25
us 25
and 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
might 25
be 25
employed 25
assertorically 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
noumenon 25
is 25
therefore 25
merely 25
a 25
limitative 25
conception 25
and 25
therefore 25
only 25
of 25
negative 25
use 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
or 25
fictitious 25
notion 25
but 25
is 25
connected 25
with 25
the 25
limitation 25
of 25
sensibility 25
without 25
however 25
being 25
capable 25
of 25
presenting 25
us 25
with 25
any 25
positive 25
datum 25
beyond 25
this 25
sphere 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
objects 25
into 25
phenomena 25
and 25
noumena 25
and 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
into 25
a 25
mundus 25
sensibilis 25
and 25
intelligibilis 25
is 25
therefore 25
quite 25
inadmissible 25
in 25
a 25
positive 25
sense 25
although 25
conceptions 25
do 25
certainly 25
admit 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
division 25
for 25
the 25
class 25

no 25
determinate 25
object 25
corresponding 25
to 25
them 25
and 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
possess 25
objective 25
validity 25
if 25
we 25
abandon 25
the 25
senses 25
how 25
can 25
it 25
be 25
made 25
conceivable 25
that 25
the 25
categories 25
which 25
are 25
the 25
only 25
conceptions 25
that 25
could 25
serve 25
as 25
conceptions 25

any 25
sense 25

meaning 25
at 25
all 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
something 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
mere 25
unity 25
of 25
thought 25
namely 25
a 25
possible 25
intuition 25
is 25
requisite 25
for 25
their 25
application 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
noumenon 25
considered 25
as 25
merely 25
problematical 25
is 25
however 25
not 25
only 25
admissible 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
limitative 25
conception 25
of 25
sensibility 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
a 25
noumenon 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
particular 25
intelligible 25
object 25
for 25
our 25
understanding 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
kind 25
of 25
understanding 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
could 25
belong 25
is 25
itself 25
a 25
problem 25
for 25
we 25
cannot 25
form 25
the 25
most 25
distant 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
understanding 25
which 25
should 25
cognize 25
an 25
object 25
not 25
discursively 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
categories 25
but 25
intuitively 25
in 25
a 25
nonsensuous 25
intuition 25
our 25
understanding 25
attains 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
a 25
sort 25
of 25
negative 25
extension 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
limited 25
by 25
but 25
rather 25
limits 25
sensibility 25
by 25
giving 25
the 25
name 25
of 25
noumena 25
to 25
things 25
not 25
considered 25
as 25
phenomena 25
but 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
it 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
prescribes 25
limits 25
to 25
itself 25
for 25
it 25
confesses 25
itself 25
unable 25
to 25
cognize 25
these 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
and 25
hence 25
is 25
compelled 25
to 25
cogitate 25
them 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25
unknown 25
something 25
i 25
find 25
however 25
in 25
the 25
writings 25
of 25
modern 25
authors 25
an 25
entirely 25
different 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
expressions 25
mundus 25
sensibilis 25
and 25
intelligibilis 25
which 25
quite 25
departs 25
from 25
the 25
meaning 25
of 25
the 25
ancientsan 25
acceptation 25
in 25
which 25
indeed 25
there 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
no 25
difficulty 25
but 25
which 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
depends 25
on 25
mere 25
verbal 25
quibbling 25
according 25
to 25
this 25
meaning 25
some 25
have 25
chosen 25
to 25
call 25
the 25
complex 25
of 25
phenomena 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
intuited 25
mundus 25
sensibilis 25
but 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
connection 25
thereof 25
is 25
cogitated 25
according 25
to 25
general 25
laws 25
of 25
thought 25
mundus 25
intelligibilis 25
astronomy 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
mean 25
by 25
the 25
word 25
the 25
mere 25
observation 25
of 25
the 25
starry 25
heaven 25
may 25
represent 25
the 25
former 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
astronomy 25
such 25
as 25
the 25
copernican 25
or 25
newtonian 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
such 25
twisting 25
of 25
words 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
sophistical 25
subterfuge 25
to 25
avoid 25
a 25
difficult 25
question 25
by 25
modifying 25
its 25
meaning 25
to 25
suit 25
our 25
own 25
convenience 25
to 25
be 25
sure 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
are 25
employed 25
in 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
but 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
whether 25
these 25
can 25
be 25
applied 25
when 25
the 25
object 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
we 25
regard 25
it 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
cogitated 25
as 25
given 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
alone 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
the 25
senses 25
the 25
question 25
therefore 25
is 25
whether 25
over 25
and 25
above 25
the 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
a 25
transcendental 25
use 25
is 25
possible 25
which 25
applies 25
to 25
the 25
noumenon 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
this 25
question 25
we 25
have 25
answered 25
in 25
the 25
negative 25
when 25
therefore 25
we 25
say 25
the 25
senses 25
represent 25
objects 25
as 25
they 25
appear 25
the 25
understanding 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
the 25
latter 25
statement 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
understood 25
in 25
a 25
transcendental 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
an 25
empirical 25
signification 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
they 25
must 25
be 25
represented 25
in 25
the 25
complete 25
connection 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
not 25
according 25
to 25
what 25
they 25
may 25
be 25
apart 25
from 25
their 25
relation 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
consequently 25
not 25
as 25
objects 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
for 25
this 25
must 25
ever 25
remain 25
unknown 25
to 25
us 25
nay 25
it 25
is 25
also 25
quite 25
unknown 25
to 25
us 25
whether 25
any 25
such 25
transcendental 25
or 25
extraordinary 25
cognition 25
is 25
possible 25
under 25
any 25
circumstances 25
at 25
least 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
our 25
categories 25
understanding 25
and 25
sensibility 25
with 25
us 25
can 25
determine 25
objects 25
only 25
in 25
conjunction 25
if 25
we 25
separate 25
them 25
we 25
have 25
intuitions 25
without 25
conceptions 25
or 25
conceptions 25
without 25
intuitions 25
in 25
both 25
cases 25
representations 25
which 25
we 25
cannot 25
apply 25
to 25
any 25
determinate 25
object 25
if 25
after 25
all 25
our 25
inquiries 25
and 25
explanations 25
any 25
one 25
still 25
hesitates 25
to 25
abandon 25
the 25
mere 25
transcendental 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
let 25
him 25
attempt 25
to 25
construct 25
with 25
them 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
it 25
would 25
of 25
course 25
be 25
unnecessary 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
to 25
construct 25
an 25
analytical 25
proposition 25
for 25
that 25
does 25
not 25
extend 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
but 25
being 25
concerned 25
only 25
about 25
what 25
is 25
cogitated 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
itself 25
it 25
leaves 25
it 25
quite 25
undecided 25
whether 25
the 25
conception 25
has 25
any 25
relation 25
to 25
objects 25
or 25
merely 25
indicates 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
thoughtcomplete 25
abstraction 25
being 25
made 25
of 25
the 25
modi 25
in 25
which 25
an 25
object 25
may 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
proposition 25
it 25
is 25
sufficient 25
for 25
the 25
understanding 25
to 25
know 25
what 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
conceptionto 25
what 25
it 25
applies 25
is 25
to 25
it 25
indifferent 25
the 25
attempt 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
made 25
with 25
a 25
synthetical 25
and 25
socalled 25
transcendental 25
principle 25
for 25

everything 25

everything 25

whence 25
can 25
the 25

draw 25
these 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
when 25

contained 25
therein 25
do 25
not 25

may 25
connect 25
in 25
the 25

have 25
no 25
logical 25

the 25
proposition 25
never 25

any 25
such 25

ipso 25
facto 25
completely 25
renouncing 25
pure 25

nonsensuous 25

thus 25
the 25

admitted 25
to 25
be 25
true 25
from 25
mere 25
habit 25

but 25
because 25
reflection 25
neither 25
precedes 25
nor 25
follows 25
it 25
is 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
judgement 25
that 25
has 25
its 25
origin 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
all 25
judgements 25

nay 25
all 25

that 25
is 25
a 25
distinction 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
given 25

belong 25
the 25
act 25
whereby 25
i 25
compare 25

the 25
faculty 25
of 25

which 25
originates 25
them 25

whereby 25
i 25
distinguish 25
whether 25
they 25
are 25

with 25
each 25
other 25
as 25
belonging 25

now 25
the 25
relations 25
in 25
which 25
conceptions 25
can 25
stand 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
are 25
those 25
of 25
identity 25

of 25
the 25

of 25
the 25

the 25

matter 25
and 25
form 25
the 25
proper 25
determination 25
of 25
these 25
relations 25
rests 25
on 25
the 25
question 25
to 25
what 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
they 25
subjectively 25
belong 25
whether 25
to 25
sensibility 25
or 25
understanding 25
for 25
on 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
solve 25
this 25
question 25
depends 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
must 25
cogitate 25
these 25
relations 25
before 25
constructing 25
any 25
objective 25
judgement 25
we 25
compare 25
the 25
conceptions 25
that 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
placed 25
in 25
the 25
judgement 25
and 25
observe 25
whether 25
there 25
exists 25
identity 25
of 25
many 25
representations 25
in 25
one 25
conception 25
if 25
a 25
general 25
judgement 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
constructed 25
or 25
difference 25
if 25
a 25
particular 25
whether 25
there 25
is 25
agreement 25
when 25
affirmative 25
and 25
opposition 25
when 25
negative 25
judgements 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
constructed 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
call 25
these 25
conceptions 25
conceptions 25
of 25
comparison 25
conceptus 25
comparationis 25
but 25
as 25
when 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
not 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
logical 25
form 25
but 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
conceptions 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
whether 25
the 25
things 25
themselves 25
are 25
identical 25
or 25
different 25
in 25
agreement 25
or 25
opposition 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
the 25
things 25
can 25
have 25
a 25
twofold 25
relation 25
to 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
to 25
wit 25
a 25
relation 25
either 25
to 25
sensibility 25
or 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
as 25
on 25
this 25
relation 25
depends 25
their 25
relation 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
transcendental 25
reflection 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
given 25
representations 25
to 25
one 25
or 25
the 25
other 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
can 25
alone 25
determine 25
this 25
latter 25
relation 25
thus 25
we 25
shall 25
not 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
discover 25
whether 25
the 25
things 25
are 25
identical 25
or 25
different 25
in 25
agreement 25
or 25
opposition 25
etc 25
from 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
things 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
comparison 25
comparatio 25
but 25
only 25
by 25
distinguishing 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
cognition 25
to 25
which 25
they 25
belong 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
transcendental 25
reflection 25
we 25
may 25
therefore 25
with 25
justice 25
say 25
that 25
logical 25
reflection 25
is 25
mere 25
comparison 25
for 25
in 25
it 25
no 25
account 25
is 25
taken 25
of 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
given 25
conceptions 25
belong 25
and 25
they 25
are 25
consequently 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
regards 25
their 25
origin 25
to 25
be 25
treated 25
as 25
homogeneous 25
while 25
transcendental 25
reflection 25
which 25
applies 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
themselves 25
contains 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
objective 25
comparison 25
of 25
representations 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
is 25
therefore 25
very 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
former 25
because 25
the 25
faculties 25

throw 25

if 25
a 25

the 25

thus 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
two 25

all 25

the 25
fact 25

intuited 25
at 25
the 25

in 25

sufficient 25

justify 25
us 25
in 25
holding 25

leibnitz 25
regarded 25

account 25
of 25
the 25
confused 25

of 25
their 25

he 25
gave 25
them 25
the 25

not 25
to 25

this 25

leibnitz 25
first 25
assumed 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25

of 25
an 25

in 25

found 25

their 25
external 25

the 25

their 25
state 25
that 25

their 25

hence 25
with 25
him 25
space 25

were 25
possiblethe 25
former 25
through 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25

through 25
the 25

with 25
each 25
other 25
as 25

so 25
would 25
it 25
really 25
be 25
if 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
were 25
capable 25
of 25
an 25
immediate 25
application 25
to 25
objects 25

if 25
space 25

time 25
were 25
determinations 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
being 25
merely 25
sensuous 25
intuitions 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
determine 25
all 25
objects 25
solely 25
as 25
phenomena 25

form 25
of 25
intuition 25
as 25
a 25
subjective 25
property 25
of 25
sensibility 25
must 25
antecede 25
all 25
matter 25
sensations 25
consequently 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
must 25
antecede 25
all 25
phenomena 25
and 25
all 25
data 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
rather 25
make 25
experience 25
itself 25
possible 25
but 25
the 25
intellectual 25
philosopher 25
could 25
not 25
endure 25
that 25
the 25
form 25
should 25
precede 25
the 25
things 25
themselves 25
and 25
determine 25
their 25
possibility 25
an 25
objection 25
perfectly 25
correct 25
if 25
we 25
assume 25
that 25
we 25
intuite 25
things 25
as 25

although 25
with 25
confused 25

is 25
a 25

at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
all 25
perception 25
and 25
the 25

primitive 25
the 25

must 25
be 25
given 25
per 25

conclude 25

we 25
judge 25

let 25
me 25
be 25
allowed 25
to 25
term 25
the 25
position 25
which 25
we 25
assign 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
either 25
in 25
the 25
sensibility 25

in 25
the 25
pure 25

the 25
transcendental 25
place 25
in 25
this 25
manner 25
the 25
appointment 25
of 25
the 25
position 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
taken 25
by 25
each 25
conception 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
difference 25
in 25
its 25
use 25
and 25
the 25
directions 25
for 25
determining 25
this 25
place 25
to 25
all 25
conceptions 25
according 25
to 25
rules 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
transcendental 25
topic 25
a 25
doctrine 25
which 25
would 25
thoroughly 25
shield 25
us 25
from 25
the 25
surreptitious 25
devices 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
the 25
delusions 25
which 25
thence 25
arise 25
as 25
it 25
would 25
always 25
distinguish 25
to 25
what 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
each 25
conception 25
properly 25
belonged 25
every 25
conception 25
every 25
title 25
under 25
which 25
many 25
cognitions 25
rank 25
together 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
a 25
logical 25
place 25
upon 25
this 25
is 25
based 25
the 25
logical 25
topic 25
of 25
aristotle 25
of 25
which 25
teachers 25
and 25
rhetoricians 25
could 25
avail 25
themselves 25
in 25
order 25
under 25
certain 25
titles 25
of 25
thought 25
to 25
observe 25
what 25
would 25
best 25
suit 25
the 25
matter 25
they 25
had 25
to 25
treat 25
and 25
thus 25
enable 25
themselves 25
to 25
quibble 25
and 25
talk 25
with 25
fluency 25
and 25
an 25
appearance 25
of 25
profundity 25
transcendental 25
topic 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
contains 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
abovementioned 25
four 25
titles 25
of 25
all 25
comparison 25
and 25
distinction 25
which 25
differ 25
from 25
categories 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
that 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
represent 25
the 25
object 25
according 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
constitutes 25
its 25
conception 25
quantity 25
reality 25
but 25
set 25
forth 25
merely 25
the 25
comparison 25
of 25
representations 25
which 25
precedes 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
this 25
comparison 25
requires 25
a 25
previous 25
reflection 25
that 25
is 25
a 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
place 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25
the 25
things 25
which 25
are 25
compared 25
belong 25
whether 25
to 25
wit 25
they 25
are 25
cogitated 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
or 25
given 25
by 25
sensibility 25
conceptions 25
may 25
be 25
logically 25
compared 25
without 25
the 25
trouble 25
of 25
inquiring 25
to 25
what 25
faculty 25
their 25
objects 25
belong 25
whether 25
as 25
noumena 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
or 25
as 25
phenomena 25
to 25
sensibility 25
if 25
however 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
employ 25
these 25
conceptions 25
in 25

this 25

should 25
make 25
a 25
very 25
unsafe 25
use 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
and 25
construct 25
pretended 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
which 25
critical 25
reason 25
cannot 25
acknowledge 25
and 25
which 25
are 25
based 25
solely 25
upon 25
a 25
transcendental 25
amphiboly 25
that 25
is 25
upon 25
a 25
substitution 25
of 25
an 25

want 25
of 25
this 25
doctrine 25
of 25
transcendental 25

consequently 25
deceived 25
by 25

the 25

intellectual 25
system 25
of 25

rather 25
believed 25
himself 25

our 25
table 25
of 25
the 25

us 25
the 25
unexpected 25
advantage 25
of 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
exhibit 25
the 25
distinctive 25
peculiarities 25
of 25
his 25
system 25
in 25
all 25
its 25
parts 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
of 25
exposing 25
the 25
fundamental 25
principle 25
of 25
this 25
peculiar 25
mode 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
rested 25
upon 25
naught 25
but 25
a 25
misconception 25
he 25
compared 25
all 25
things 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
merely 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
naturally 25
found 25
no 25
other 25
differences 25
than 25
those 25
by 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
distinguishes 25
its 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
one 25
from 25
another 25

conditions 25
of 25

contain 25
in 25
themselves 25
their 25
own 25
means 25
of 25
distinction 25
he 25
did 25
not 25
look 25
upon 25
as 25
primitive 25
because 25
sensibility 25
was 25
to 25
him 25
but 25
a 25
confused 25
mode 25
of 25
representation 25
and 25
not 25
any 25
particular 25
source 25
of 25

for 25
him 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25

itself 25

distinguished 25
from 25

in 25
their 25

the 25

accordingly 25
the 25
objects 25

as 25
judged 25

leibnitz 25
did 25
not 25
announce 25
this 25
proposition 25
with 25
precisely 25
the 25
pomp 25
of 25
a 25
new 25
principle 25
he 25
yet 25
employed 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
establishment 25
of 25
new 25
propositions 25
and 25
his 25
followers 25
introduced 25
it 25
into 25
their 25
leibnitziowolfian 25
system 25
of 25
philosophy 25
according 25
to 25
this 25
principle 25
for 25
example 25
all 25
evils 25
are 25
but 25
consequences 25
of 25
the 25
limited 25
nature 25
of 25
created 25
beings 25
that 25
is 25
negations 25
because 25
these 25
are 25
the 25
only 25
opposite 25
of 25
reality 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
general 25
this 25
is 25
really 25
the 25
case 25
but 25
not 25
in 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
the 25
upholders 25
of 25
this 25
system 25
deem 25
it 25
not 25
only 25
possible 25
but 25
natural 25
also 25
to 25
connect 25
and 25
unite 25
all 25
reality 25
in 25
one 25
being 25
because 25
they 25
acknowledge 25
no 25
other 25
sort 25
of 25
opposition 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
contradiction 25
by 25
which 25
the 25
conception 25
itself 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
annihilated 25
and 25
find 25
themselves 25
unable 25
to 25
conceive 25
an 25
opposition 25
of 25
reciprocal 25
destruction 25
so 25
to 25
speak 25
in 25
which 25
one 25
real 25
cause 25
destroys 25
the 25
effect 25
of 25
another 25
and 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
whose 25
representation 25
we 25
meet 25
with 25
only 25
in 25
sensibility 25
rd 25
the 25
leibnitzian 25
monadology 25
has 25
really 25
no 25
better 25
foundation 25
than 25
on 25
this 25
philosophers 25
mode 25
of 25
falsely 25
representing 25
the 25
difference 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
and 25
external 25
solely 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
substances 25
in 25
general 25
must 25
have 25
something 25
inward 25
which 25
is 25
therefore 25
free 25
from 25
external 25
relations 25
consequently 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
composition 25
also 25
the 25
simplethat 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
represented 25
by 25
a 25
unitis 25
therefore 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
internal 25
in 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
the 25
internal 25
state 25
of 25
substances 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
consist 25
in 25
place 25
shape 25
contact 25
or 25
motion 25
determinations 25
which 25
are 25
all 25
external 25
relations 25
and 25
we 25
can 25
ascribe 25
to 25
them 25
no 25
other 25
than 25
that 25
whereby 25
we 25
internally 25
determine 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
sense 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
representation 25
thus 25
then 25
were 25
constructed 25
the 25
monads 25
which 25
were 25
to 25
form 25
the 25
elements 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
the 25
active 25
force 25
of 25
which 25
consists 25
in 25
representation 25
the 25
effects 25
of 25
this 25
force 25
being 25
thus 25
entirely 25
confined 25
to 25
themselves 25
for 25
the 25
same 25
reason 25
his 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
possible 25
community 25
of 25
substances 25
could 25
not 25
represent 25
it 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
predetermined 25
harmony 25
and 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
as 25
a 25
physical 25
influence 25
for 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
everything 25
is 25
occupied 25
only 25
internally 25
that 25
is 25

its 25
own 25
representations 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25

not 25
stand 25
in 25
active 25
and 25
living 25
connection 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
another 25
but 25
some 25
third 25
cause 25
operating 25
on 25
all 25
without 25
exception 25
was 25
necessary 25
to 25
make 25
the 25
different 25
states 25
correspond 25
with 25
one 25
another 25

this 25
did 25
not 25
happen 25
by 25

through 25
the 25

the 25

a 25
cause 25
occupied 25

connected 25
with 25
all 25

the 25
leibnitzian 25
school 25

also 25
reciprocal 25

to 25
universal 25

th 25
this 25
philosophers 25
celebrated 25
doctrine 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
he 25
intellectualized 25
these 25
forms 25
of 25
sensibility 25
originated 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
delusion 25
of 25
transcendental 25
reflection 25
if 25
i 25
attempt 25
to 25
represent 25
by 25
the 25
mere 25
understanding 25
the 25
external 25
relations 25
of 25
things 25
i 25
can 25
do 25
so 25
only 25
by 25
employing 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
their 25
reciprocal 25
action 25
and 25
if 25
i 25
wish 25
to 25
connect 25
one 25
state 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
thing 25
with 25
another 25
state 25
i 25
must 25
avail 25
myself 25
of 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
and 25
thus 25
leibnitz 25
regarded 25
space 25
as 25
a 25
certain 25
order 25
in 25
the 25
community 25
of 25
substances 25
and 25
time 25
as 25
the 25
dynamical 25
sequence 25
of 25
their 25
states 25
that 25
which 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
possess 25
proper 25
to 25
themselves 25
and 25
independent 25
of 25
things 25
he 25
ascribed 25
to 25
a 25
necessary 25
confusion 25
in 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
them 25
whereby 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
form 25
of 25
dynamical 25
relations 25
is 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
selfexistent 25
intuition 25
antecedent 25
even 25
to 25
things 25
themselves 25
thus 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
were 25
the 25
intelligible 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
things 25
substances 25
and 25
their 25
states 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
things 25
were 25
intelligible 25
substances 25
substantiae 25
noumena 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
he 25
made 25
these 25
conceptions 25
valid 25
of 25
phenomena 25
because 25
he 25
did 25
not 25
allow 25
to 25
sensibility 25
a 25
peculiar 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
but 25
sought 25
all 25
even 25
the 25
empirical 25
representation 25
of 25
objects 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
left 25
to 25
sense 25
naught 25
but 25
the 25
despicable 25
task 25
of 25
confusing 25
and 25
disarranging 25
the 25
representations 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
but 25
even 25
if 25
we 25
could 25
frame 25
any 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
concerning 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
which 25
is 25
impossible 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
apply 25
to 25
phenomena 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
represent 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
i 25
should 25
be 25
obliged 25
in 25
transcendental 25
reflection 25
to 25
compare 25
my 25
conceptions 25
only 25
under 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensibility 25
and 25
so 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
determinations 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
of 25
phenomena 25
what 25
things 25
may 25
be 25
in 25
themselves 25
i 25
know 25
not 25
and 25
need 25
not 25
know 25
because 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
never 25
presented 25
to 25
me 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
i 25
must 25
adopt 25
the 25
same 25
mode 25
of 25
procedure 25
with 25
the 25
other 25
conceptions 25
of 25

seek 25
to 25
discover 25
in 25
all 25
parts 25
of 25

it 25
occupies 25

in 25
all 25
the 25
functions 25
and 25
operations 25
it 25
performs 25
and 25
which 25
are 25
indeed 25
never 25
anything 25
but 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
sense 25
i 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
find 25
anything 25
that 25

absolutely 25

only 25
what 25
is 25
comparatively 25
internal 25

it 25
should 25
be 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25

a 25
mere 25
chimera 25
for 25
matter 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
object 25
for 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25

the 25
transcendental 25
object 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
which 25
we 25
call 25
matter 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
nescio 25
quid 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
understand 25
even 25
though 25
someone 25
were 25
found 25
able 25
to 25
tell 25
us 25
for 25
we 25
can 25
understand 25
nothing 25
that 25
does 25
not 25
bring 25
with 25
it 25
something 25
in 25
intuition 25
corresponding 25
to 25
the 25
expressions 25
employed 25
if 25
by 25
the 25
complaint 25
of 25
being 25
unable 25
to 25
perceive 25
the 25
internal 25
nature 25
of 25
things 25
it 25
is 25
meant 25
that 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
comprehend 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
what 25
the 25
things 25
which 25
appear 25
to 25
us 25
may 25
be 25
in 25
themselves 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
silly 25
and 25
unreasonable 25
complaint 25
for 25
those 25
who 25
talk 25
thus 25
really 25
desire 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
cognize 25
consequently 25
to 25
intuite 25
things 25
without 25
senses 25
and 25
therefore 25
wish 25
that 25
we 25
possessed 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
perfectly 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
human 25
faculty 25
not 25
merely 25
in 25
degree 25
but 25
even 25
as 25
regards 25
intuition 25
and 25
the 25
mode 25
thereof 25
so 25
that 25
thus 25
we 25
should 25
not 25
be 25
men 25
but 25
belong 25
to 25
a 25
class 25
of 25
beings 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
whose 25
existence 25
much 25
less 25
their 25
nature 25
and 25
constitution 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
cognizing 25
by 25
observation 25
and 25
analysis 25
of 25
phenomena 25
we 25
penetrate 25
into 25
the 25
interior 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
say 25
what 25
progress 25
this 25
knowledge 25
may 25
make 25
in 25
time 25
but 25
those 25
transcendental 25
questions 25
which 25
pass 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
nature 25
we 25
could 25
never 25
answer 25
even 25
although 25
all 25
nature 25
were 25
laid 25
open 25
to 25
us 25
because 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
observing 25
our 25
own 25
mind 25
with 25
any 25
other 25
intuition 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
our 25
internal 25
sense 25
for 25
herein 25
lies 25
the 25
mystery 25
of 25
the 25
origin 25
and 25
source 25
of 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
sensibility 25
its 25
application 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
and 25
the 25
transcendental 25
ground 25
of 25
this 25
unity 25
of 25
subjective 25
and 25
objective 25
lie 25
too 25
deeply 25
concealed 25
for 25
us 25
who 25
cognize 25
ourselves 25
only 25
through 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
consequently 25
as 25
phenomena 25
to 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
discover 25
in 25
our 25
existence 25
anything 25
but 25
phenomena 25
the 25
nonsensuous 25
cause 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
earnestly 25
desire 25
to 25
penetrate 25
to 25
the 25
great 25
utility 25
of 25
this 25
critique 25
of 25
conclusions 25
arrived 25
at 25
by 25
the 25
processes 25
of 25
mere 25
reflection 25
consists 25
in 25
its 25
clear 25
demonstration 25
of 25
the 25
nullity 25
of 25
all 25
conclusions 25
respecting 25
objects 25
which 25
are 25
compared 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
alone 25
while 25
it 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
confirms 25
what 25
we 25
particularly 25
insisted 25
on 25
namely 25
that 25
although 25
phenomena 25
are 25
not 25
included 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
among 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
they 25
are 25
nevertheless 25
the 25
only 25
things 25
by 25
which 25
our 25
cognition 25
can 25
possess 25
objective 25
reality 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
which 25
give 25
us 25
intuitions 25
to 25
correspond 25
with 25
our 25
conceptions 25
when 25
we 25
reflect 25
in 25
a 25
purely 25
logical 25
manner 25
we 25
do 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
compare 25
conceptions 25
in 25
our 25
understanding 25
to 25
discover 25
whether 25
both 25
have 25
the 25
same 25
content 25
whether 25
they 25
are 25
selfcontradictory 25
or 25
not 25
whether 25
anything 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
either 25
conception 25
which 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
is 25
given 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
thinking 25
that 25
given 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
apply 25
these 25
conceptions 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
general 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
sense 25
without 25
first 25
determining 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
sensuous 25
or 25
intellectual 25
intuition 25
certain 25
limitations 25
present 25
themselves 25
which 25
forbid 25
us 25
to 25
pass 25
beyond 25
the 25
conceptions 25
and 25
render 25
all 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
them 25
impossible 25
and 25
thus 25
these 25
limitations 25
prove 25
that 25
the 25
representation 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
general 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
insufficient 25
but 25
without 25
sensuous 25
determination 25
and 25
independently 25
of 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
selfcontradictory 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
therefore 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
objects 25
as 25
in 25
logic 25
or 25
admitting 25
them 25
must 25
think 25
them 25
under 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
that 25
consequently 25
the 25
intelligible 25
requires 25
an 25
altogether 25
peculiar 25
intuition 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
possess 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
for 25
us 25
nothing 25
while 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
phenomena 25
cannot 25
be 25
objects 25
in 25
themselves 25
for 25
when 25
i 25
merely 25
think 25
things 25
in 25
general 25
the 25
difference 25
in 25
their 25
external 25
relations 25
cannot 25
constitute 25
a 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
things 25
themselves 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
former 25
presupposes 25
the 25
latter 25
and 25
if 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
one 25
of 25
two 25
things 25
is 25
not 25
internally 25
different 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
i 25
am 25
merely 25
thinking 25
the 25
same 25
thing 25
in 25
different 25
relations 25
further 25
by 25
the 25
addition 25
of 25
one 25
affirmation 25
reality 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
the 25
positive 25
therein 25
is 25
really 25
augmented 25
and 25
nothing 25
is 25
abstracted 25
or 25
withdrawn 25
from 25
it 25
hence 25
the 25
real 25
in 25
things 25
cannot 25
be 25
in 25
contradiction 25
with 25
or 25
opposition 25
to 25
itselfand 25
so 25
on 25
the 25
true 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reflection 25
in 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
has 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
shown 25
been 25
so 25
misconceived 25
by 25
leibnitz 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
acute 25
philosophers 25
of 25
either 25
ancient 25
or 25
modern 25
times 25
that 25
he 25
has 25
been 25
misled 25
into 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
a 25
baseless 25
system 25
of 25
intellectual 25
cognition 25
which 25
professes 25
to 25
determine 25
its 25
objects 25
without 25
the 25
intervention 25
of 25
the 25
senses 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
the 25
exposition 25
of 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
amphiboly 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
as 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
these 25
false 25
principles 25
is 25
of 25
great 25
utility 25
in 25
determining 25
with 25
certainty 25
the 25
proper 25
limits 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
it 25
is 25
right 25
to 25
say 25
whatever 25
is 25
affirmed 25
or 25
denied 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
of 25
a 25
conception 25
can 25
be 25
affirmed 25
or 25
denied 25
of 25
any 25
part 25
of 25
it 25
dictum 25
de 25
omni 25
et 25
nullo 25
but 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
absurd 25
so 25
to 25
alter 25
this 25
logical 25
proposition 25
as 25
to 25
say 25
whatever 25
is 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
a 25
general 25
conception 25
is 25
likewise 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
particular 25
conceptions 25
which 25
rank 25
under 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
latter 25
are 25
particular 25
conceptions 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
their 25
content 25
is 25
greater 25
than 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
cogitated 25
in 25
the 25
general 25
conception 25
and 25
yet 25
the 25
whole 25
intellectual 25
system 25
of 25
leibnitz 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
this 25
false 25
principle 25
and 25
with 25
it 25
must 25
necessarily 25
fall 25
to 25
the 25
ground 25
together 25
with 25
all 25
the 25
ambiguous 25
principles 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
have 25
thence 25
originated 25
leibnitzs 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
identity 25
of 25
indiscernibles 25
or 25
indistinguishables 25
is 25
really 25
based 25
on 25
the 25
presupposition 25
that 25
if 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
a 25
certain 25
distinction 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
it 25
is 25
also 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
met 25
with 25
in 25
things 25
themselves 25
that 25
consequently 25
all 25
things 25
are 25
completely 25
identical 25
numero 25
eadem 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
as 25
to 25
quality 25
or 25
quantity 25
in 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
them 25
but 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
anything 25
abstraction 25
has 25
been 25
made 25
of 25
many 25
necessary 25
conditions 25
of 25
intuition 25
that 25
of 25
which 25
abstraction 25
has 25
been 25
made 25
is 25
rashly 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
nonexistent 25
and 25
nothing 25
is 25
attributed 25
to 25
the 25
thing 25
but 25
what 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
its 25
conception 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cubic 25
foot 25
of 25
space 25
however 25
i 25
may 25
think 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
completely 25
identical 25
but 25
two 25
cubic 25
feet 25
in 25
space 25
are 25
nevertheless 25
distinct 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
from 25
the 25
sole 25
fact 25
of 25
their 25
being 25
in 25
different 25
places 25
they 25
are 25
numero 25
diversa 25
and 25
these 25
places 25
are 25
conditions 25
of 25
intuition 25
wherein 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
given 25
and 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
to 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
sensibility 25
in 25
like 25
manner 25
there 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
no 25
contradiction 25
when 25
a 25
negative 25
is 25
not 25
connected 25
with 25
an 25
affirmative 25
and 25
merely 25
affirmative 25
conceptions 25
cannot 25
in 25
conjunction 25
produce 25
any 25
negation 25
but 25
in 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
wherein 25
reality 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
motion 25
is 25
given 25
we 25
find 25
conditions 25
opposite 25
directionsof 25
which 25
abstraction 25
has 25
been 25
made 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
motion 25
in 25
generalwhich 25
render 25
possible 25
a 25
contradiction 25
or 25
opposition 25
not 25
indeed 25
of 25
a 25
logical 25
kindand 25
which 25
from 25
pure 25
positives 25
produce 25
zero 25
we 25
are 25
therefore 25
not 25
justified 25
in 25
saying 25
that 25
all 25
reality 25
is 25
in 25
perfect 25
agreement 25
and 25
harmony 25
because 25
no 25
contradiction 25
is 25
discoverable 25
among 25
its 25
conceptions 25
according 25
to 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
internal 25
is 25
the 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
relations 25
or 25
external 25
determinations 25
when 25
therefore 25
i 25
abstract 25
all 25
conditions 25
of 25
intuition 25
and 25
confine 25
myself 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
general 25
i 25
can 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
external 25
relations 25
and 25
there 25
must 25
nevertheless 25
remain 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
indicates 25
no 25
relation 25
but 25
merely 25
internal 25
determinations 25
now 25
it 25
seems 25
to 25
follow 25
that 25
in 25
everything 25
substance 25
there 25
is 25
something 25
which 25
is 25
absolutely 25
internal 25
and 25
which 25
antecedes 25
all 25
external 25
determinations 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
renders 25
them 25
possible 25
and 25
that 25
therefore 25
this 25
substratum 25
is 25
something 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
contain 25
any 25
external 25
relations 25
and 25
is 25
consequently 25
simple 25
for 25
corporeal 25
things 25
are 25
never 25
anything 25
but 25
relations 25
at 25
least 25
of 25
their 25
parts 25
external 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
we 25
know 25
of 25
no 25
other 25
absolutely 25
internal 25
determinations 25
than 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
this 25
substratum 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
simple 25
but 25
also 25
analogously 25
with 25
our 25
internal 25
sense 25
determined 25
through 25
representations 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
all 25
things 25
are 25
properly 25
monads 25
or 25
simple 25
beings 25
endowed 25
with 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
representation 25
now 25
all 25
this 25
would 25
be 25
perfectly 25
correct 25
if 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
were 25
the 25
only 25
necessary 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
presentation 25
of 25
objects 25
of 25
external 25

on 25
the 25
contrary 25
manifest 25

a 25
permanent 25
phenomenon 25
in 25
space 25
impenetrable 25
extension 25
can 25
contain 25
mere 25

absolutely 25
internal 25

the 25
primary 25
substratum 25
of 25
all 25
external 25
perception 25
by 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
i 25
cannot 25
think 25
anything 25
external 25
without 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
thinking 25
something 25
internal 25

the 25
reason 25
that 25
conceptions 25

relations 25
presuppose 25
given 25
things 25

without 25
these 25
are 25
impossible 25
but 25
as 25
an 25
intuition 25
there 25
is 25
something 25
that 25
is 25
space 25
which 25
with 25
all 25
it 25
contains 25
consists 25
of 25
purely 25
formal 25
or 25
indeed 25
real 25
relations 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
general 25

this 25
presents 25
to 25
us 25
the 25
substratum 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
cognized 25
through 25
conceptions 25
alone 25
i 25
cannot 25
say 25
because 25
a 25
thing 25
cannot 25
be 25
represented 25
by 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
without 25
something 25
absolutely 25
internal 25
there 25
is 25
also 25
in 25
the 25
things 25
themselves 25
which 25
are 25
contained 25
under 25
these 25
conceptions 25
and 25
in 25
their 25
intuition 25
nothing 25
external 25
to 25
which 25
something 25
absolutely 25
internal 25
does 25
not 25
serve 25
as 25
the 25
foundation 25
for 25
when 25
we 25
have 25
made 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
intuition 25
there 25
certainly 25
remains 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
internal 25
in 25
general 25
through 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
external 25
is 25
possible 25
but 25
this 25
necessity 25
which 25
is 25
grounded 25
upon 25
abstraction 25
alone 25
does 25
not 25
obtain 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
things 25
themselves 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
given 25
in 25
intuition 25
with 25
such 25
determinations 25
as 25
express 25
mere 25
relations 25
without 25
having 25
anything 25
internal 25
as 25
their 25
foundation 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
things 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
neither 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
only 25
phenomena 25
what 25
we 25
cognize 25
in 25
matter 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
relations 25
what 25
we 25
call 25
its 25
internal 25
determinations 25
are 25
but 25
comparatively 25
internal 25
but 25
there 25
are 25
some 25
selfsubsistent 25
and 25
permanent 25
through 25
which 25
a 25
determined 25
object 25
is 25
given 25
that 25
i 25
when 25
abstraction 25
is 25
made 25
of 25
these 25
relations 25
have 25
nothing 25
more 25
to 25
think 25
does 25
not 25
destroy 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
as 25
phenomenon 25
nor 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
abstracto 25
but 25
it 25
does 25
away 25
with 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
determinable 25
according 25
to 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
a 25
noumenon 25
it 25
is 25
certainly 25
startling 25
to 25
hear 25
that 25
a 25
thing 25
consists 25
solely 25
of 25
relations 25
but 25
this 25
thing 25
is 25
simply 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
cannot 25
be 25
cogitated 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
mere 25
categories 25
it 25
does 25
itself 25
consist 25
in 25
the 25
mere 25
relation 25
of 25
something 25
in 25
general 25
to 25
the 25
senses 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
way 25
we 25
cannot 25
cogitate 25
relations 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
abstracto 25
if 25
we 25
commence 25
with 25
conceptions 25
alone 25
in 25
any 25
other 25
manner 25
than 25
that 25
one 25
is 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
determinations 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
for 25
that 25
is 25
itself 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
or 25
category 25
of 25
relation 25
but 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
we 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
intuition 25
we 25
lose 25
altogether 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
manifold 25
determines 25
to 25
each 25
of 25
its 25
parts 25
its 25
place 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
sensibility 25
space 25
and 25
yet 25
this 25
mode 25
antecedes 25
all 25
empirical 25
causality 25

if 25
any 25
one 25
wishes 25
here 25
to 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
the 25
usual 25
subterfuge 25

to 25
say 25
that 25
at 25

be 25

opposition 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
requisite 25
for 25
him 25
to 25
adduce 25
an 25
example 25
of 25
this 25
pure 25
and 25
nonsensuous 25
reality 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
understood 25
whether 25
the 25
notion 25
represents 25
something 25

nothing 25

an 25
example 25
cannot 25
be 25
found 25

in 25
experience 25
which 25
never 25
presents 25
to 25
us 25
anything 25
more 25
than 25
phenomena 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
proposition 25
means 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25

not 25
contain 25

ever 25
doubted 25

by 25

things 25

from 25
our 25
own 25

no 25
more 25
than 25
saying 25
that 25
our 25
mode 25

intuition 25
is 25
not 25

left 25

another 25

also 25

no 25

so 25
far 25

it 25
does 25
not 25
therefore 25
follow 25
that 25
it 25
may 25

employed 25
purely 25

without 25
the 25

we 25
cannot 25
call 25

pure 25
thought 25

a 25
perfectly 25

therefore 25
not 25
the 25
conception 25

merely 25
a 25
problematical 25

only 25

not 25
apply 25
to 25
all 25

remains 25

absolutely 25
denied 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25

a 25
determinate 25

without 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
enlarging 25
its 25
own 25
field 25

moreover 25
it 25
forbids 25

to 25
apply 25
its 25

itself 25
only 25
however 25
as 25
a 25
transcendental 25

is 25
the 25

a 25

consequently 25
not 25
itself 25
a 25

we 25

to 25
call 25
this 25

nonsensuous 25
we 25

at 25

do 25
so 25

quite 25

only 25

the 25

leaving 25
at 25
the 25

an 25

neither 25

the 25

us 25
to 25

it 25

not 25

no 25

a 25

a 25

one 25
but 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
source 25
of 25
cognition 25
besides 25
these 25
two 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
error 25
is 25
caused 25
solely 25
by 25
the 25
unobserved 25
influence 25
of 25
the 25

thus 25
it 25
happens 25
that 25
the 25
subjective 25
grounds 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25

are 25
confounded 25
with 25
the 25

cause 25
them 25
to 25
deviate 25
from 25
their 25
proper 25
determination 25
just 25
as 25
a 25
body 25
in 25

would 25
always 25
of 25
itself 25
proceed 25
in 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
but 25
if 25
another 25

gives 25
to 25
it 25
a 25
different 25
direction 25
it 25
will 25
then 25
start 25
off 25
into 25
a 25
curvilinear 25
line 25
of 25
motion 25
to 25
distinguish 25
the 25
peculiar 25
action 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
from 25
the 25

mingles 25
with 25
it 25

is 25
necessary 25
to 25
consider 25
an 25
erroneous 25
judgement 25
as 25
the 25
diagonal 25
between 25
two 25
forces 25
that 25
determine 25
the 25

in 25
two 25

down 25
all 25

clearly 25
perceived 25
by 25

take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25

the 25

follows 25
in 25
our 25

subjectively 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25

the 25
appearance 25

now 25
from 25
this 25

it 25

that 25
the 25
subjective 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
certain 25
connection 25
of 25
our 25
conceptions 25
is 25
regarded 25
as 25
an 25
objective 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
this 25
illusion 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
avoid 25
just 25
as 25
we 25
cannot 25
avoid 25
perceiving 25
that 25
the 25
sea 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
higher 25
at 25
a 25
distance 25
than 25
it 25
is 25
near 25
the 25
shore 25
because 25
we 25
see 25
the 25
former 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
higher 25
rays 25
than 25
the 25
latter 25
or 25
which 25
is 25
a 25
still 25
stronger 25
case 25
as 25
even 25
the 25
astronomer 25
cannot 25
prevent 25
himself 25
from 25
seeing 25
the 25
moon 25
larger 25
at 25
its 25
rising 25
than 25
some 25
time 25
afterwards 25
although 25
he 25
is 25
not 25
deceived 25
by 25
this 25
illusion 25
transcendental 25
dialectic 25
will 25
therefore 25
content 25
itself 25
with 25
exposing 25
the 25
illusory 25
appearance 25
in 25
transcendental 25
judgements 25
and 25
guarding 25
us 25
against 25
it 25

to 25
make 25

entirely 25
disappear 25

cease 25
to 25
be 25

is 25
utterly 25
beyond 25
its 25
power 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
here 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
a 25
natural 25
and 25
unavoidable 25
illusion 25
which 25
rests 25
upon 25
subjective 25
principles 25
and 25
imposes 25
these 25
upon 25
us 25
as 25
objective 25
while 25
logical 25
dialectic 25
in 25
the 25
detection 25
of 25
sophisms 25
has 25
to 25
do 25
merely 25
with 25
an 25
error 25
in 25
the 25
logical 25
consequence 25
of 25
the 25
propositions 25

unavoidable 25

the 25

even 25

the 25

us 25
the 25

the 25

the 25
term 25

merely 25
a 25

the 25

exposed 25
for 25
in 25
this 25

alone 25

we 25
find 25

in 25
this 25

laws 25
are 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
limitations 25
of 25
our 25
freedom 25
upon 25
conditions 25

it 25
subsists 25
in 25
perfect 25
harmony 25

itself 25

for 25
their 25
object 25
that 25
which 25

completely 25
our 25
own 25

we 25
ourselves 25
may 25

how 25

things 25
in 25
themselves 25
how 25
the 25
nature 25

is 25
to 25

a 25
question 25

it 25

well 25
nigh 25
impossible 25

at 25

what 25
we 25
have 25
said 25
that 25

something 25
very 25
different 25

may 25
indeed 25
precede 25
other 25
cognitions 25

logical 25
procedure 25

us 25
sufficient 25

the 25

principle 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
pure 25

rest 25
reason 25
as 25
observed 25
in 25
the 25

not 25
applicable 25

to 25

pure 25

so 25
not 25
immediately 25

mediately 25
through 25
the 25

is 25
essentially 25
different 25
from 25
this 25
unity 25

is 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
that 25
everything 25
which 25
happens 25
has 25
a 25

is 25
not 25
a 25
principle 25
cognized 25

this 25
principle 25
makes 25
the 25

of 25

possible 25

borrows 25
nothing 25
from 25

which 25
without 25
a 25
reference 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
could 25
never 25
have 25
produced 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
any 25
such 25
synthetical 25
unity 25

to 25
discover 25
the 25
general 25
condition 25
of 25
its 25
judgement 25
the 25
conclusion 25
and 25
a 25
syllogism 25
is 25
itself 25
nothing 25
but 25
a 25
judgement 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
subsumption 25
of 25
its 25
condition 25
under 25
a 25
general 25
rule 25
the 25
major 25
now 25
as 25
this 25
rule 25
may 25
itself 25
be 25
subjected 25
to 25
the 25
same 25
process 25
of 25
reason 25

thus 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25

be 25
sought 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
a 25
prosyllogism 25
as 25
long 25
as 25
the 25
process 25
can 25
be 25
continued 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
manifest 25
that 25
the 25
peculiar 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
logical 25
use 25
is 25
to 25
find 25
for 25
the 25
conditioned 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
whereby 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
completed 25
but 25
this 25
logical 25
maxim 25
cannot 25
be 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
unless 25
we 25
admit 25
that 25
if 25
the 25
conditioned 25
is 25
given 25
the 25
whole 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
subordinated 25
to 25
one 25
anothera 25
series 25
which 25
is 25
consequently 25
itself 25
unconditionedis 25
also 25
given 25
that 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
and 25
its 25
connection 25
but 25
this 25
principle 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
is 25
evidently 25
synthetical 25
for 25
analytically 25
the 25
conditioned 25
certainly 25
relates 25
to 25
some 25
condition 25
but 25
not 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
from 25
this 25
principle 25
also 25
there 25
must 25
originate 25
different 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
is 25
perfectly 25
ignorant 25

to 25

only 25

of 25
a 25
possible 25
experience 25
the 25
cognition 25

always 25
conditioned 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
if 25
it 25
does 25
really 25
exist 25
must 25
be 25
especially 25
considered 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
determinations 25
which 25
distinguish 25
it 25
from 25
whatever 25
is 25
conditioned 25
and 25
will 25
thus 25
afford 25
us 25
material 25
for 25
many 25
a 25
priori 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
the 25
principles 25
resulting 25
from 25
this 25
highest 25
principle 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
will 25
however 25
be 25
transcendent 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
phenomena 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
impossible 25
to 25
make 25
any 25
adequate 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
this 25
principle 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
completely 25
different 25
from 25
all 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25

our 25

in 25

contrary 25
a 25
merely 25

us 25
to 25

the 25

conclusions 25
from 25
experience 25

by 25
the 25
standard 25

it 25
estimates 25
the 25
degree 25
of 25

empirical 25

notwithstanding 25
such 25
conceptions 25
possess 25
objective 25
validity 25
they 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
conceptus 25
ratiocinati 25
conceptions 25
legitimately 25
concluded 25
in 25
cases 25
where 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
they 25
have 25
been 25
admitted 25
on 25
account 25
of 25
having 25
the 25
appearance 25
of 25
being 25
correctly 25
concluded 25
and 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
conceptus 25
ratiocinantes 25
sophistical 25
conceptions 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
sufficiently 25
demonstrated 25
in 25
that 25
part 25
of 25
our 25
treatise 25
which 25
relates 25
to 25
the 25
dialectical 25
conclusions 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
shall 25
omit 25
any 25
consideration 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
this 25
place 25
as 25
we 25
called 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
categories 25
we 25
shall 25
also 25
distinguish 25
those 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
by 25
a 25
new 25
name 25
and 25
call 25
them 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
these 25
terms 25
however 25
we 25
must 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
explain 25
and 25
justify 25
section 25
iof 25
ideas 25
in 25
general 25
despite 25
the 25
great 25
wealth 25
of 25
words 25
which 25
european 25
languages 25
possess 25
the 25
thinker 25
finds 25
himself 25
often 25
at 25
a 25
loss 25
for 25
an 25
expression 25
exactly 25
suited 25
to 25
his 25
conception 25
for 25
want 25
of 25
which 25
he 25
is 25
unable 25
to 25
make 25
himself 25
intelligible 25
either 25
to 25
others 25
or 25
to 25
himself 25
to 25
coin 25
new 25
words 25
is 25
a 25
pretension 25
to 25
legislation 25
in 25
language 25
which 25
is 25
seldom 25
successful 25
and 25
before 25
recourse 25
is 25
taken 25
to 25
so 25
desperate 25
an 25
expedient 25
it 25
is 25
advisable 25
to 25
examine 25
the 25
dead 25
and 25
learned 25
languages 25
with 25
the 25
hope 25
and 25
the 25
probability 25
that 25
we 25
may 25
there 25
meet 25
with 25
some 25
adequate 25
expression 25
of 25
the 25
notion 25
we 25
have 25
in 25
our 25
minds 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
even 25
if 25
the 25
original 25
meaning 25
of 25
the 25
word 25
has 25
become 25
somewhat 25
uncertain 25
from 25
carelessness 25
or 25
want 25
of 25
caution 25
on 25
the 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
authors 25
of 25
it 25
it 25
is 25
always 25
better 25
to 25
adhere 25
to 25
and 25
confirm 25
its 25
proper 25
meaningeven 25
although 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
doubtful 25
whether 25
it 25
was 25
formerly 25
used 25
in 25
exactly 25
this 25
sensethan 25
to 25
make 25
our 25
labour 25
vain 25
by 25
want 25
of 25
sufficient 25
care 25
to 25
render 25
ourselves 25
intelligible 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
when 25
it 25
happens 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
only 25
a 25
single 25
word 25
to 25
express 25
a 25
certain 25
conception 25
and 25
this 25
word 25
in 25
its 25
usual 25
acceptation 25
is 25
thoroughly 25
adequate 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
the 25
accurate 25
distinction 25
of 25
which 25
from 25
related 25
conceptions 25
is 25
of 25
great 25
importance 25
we 25
ought 25
not 25
to 25
employ 25
the 25
expression 25
improvidently 25
or 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
variety 25
and 25
elegance 25
of 25
style 25
use 25
it 25
as 25
a 25
synonym 25
for 25
other 25
cognate 25
words 25
it 25
is 25
our 25
duty 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
carefully 25
to 25
preserve 25
its 25
peculiar 25
signification 25
as 25
otherwise 25
it 25
easily 25
happens 25
that 25
when 25
the 25
attention 25
of 25
the 25
reader 25
is 25
no 25
longer 25
particularly 25
attracted 25
to 25
the 25
expression 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
lost 25
amid 25
the 25
multitude 25
of 25
other 25
words 25
of 25
very 25
different 25
import 25
the 25
thought 25
which 25
it 25
conveyed 25
and 25
which 25
it 25
alone 25
conveyed 25
is 25
lost 25
with 25
it 25
plato 25
employed 25
the 25
expression 25
idea 25
in 25
a 25
way 25
that 25
plainly 25
showed 25
he 25
meant 25
by 25
it 25
something 25
which 25
is 25
never 25
derived 25
from 25
the 25
senses 25
but 25
which 25
far 25
transcends 25
even 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
with 25
which 25
aristotle 25
occupied 25
himself 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
in 25
experience 25
nothing 25
perfectly 25
corresponding 25
to 25
them 25
could 25
be 25
found 25
ideas 25
are 25
according 25
to 25
him 25
archetypes 25
of 25
things 25
themselves 25
and 25
not 25
merely 25
keys 25
to 25
possible 25
experiences 25
like 25
the 25
categories 25
in 25
his 25
view 25
they 25
flow 25
from 25
the 25
highest 25
reason 25
by 25
which 25
they 25
have 25
been 25
imparted 25
to 25
human 25
reason 25
which 25
however 25
exists 25
no 25
longer 25
in 25
its 25
original 25
state 25
but 25
is 25
obliged 25
with 25
great 25
labour 25
to 25
recall 25
by 25
reminiscencewhich 25
is 25
called 25
philosophythe 25
old 25
but 25
now 25
sadly 25
obscured 25
ideas 25
i 25
will 25
not 25
here 25
enter 25
upon 25
any 25
literary 25
investigation 25
of 25
the 25
sense 25
which 25
this 25
sublime 25
philosopher 25
attached 25
to 25
this 25
expression 25
i 25
shall 25
content 25
myself 25
with 25
remarking 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
nothing 25
unusual 25
in 25
common 25
conversation 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
written 25
works 25
by 25
comparing 25
the 25
thoughts 25
which 25
an 25
author 25
has 25
delivered 25
upon 25
a 25
subject 25
to 25
understand 25
him 25
better 25
than 25
he 25
understood 25
himself 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
he 25
may 25
not 25
have 25
sufficiently 25
determined 25
his 25
conception 25
and 25
thus 25
have 25
sometimes 25
spoken 25
nay 25
even 25
thought 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
his 25
own 25
opinions 25
plato 25
perceived 25
very 25
clearly 25
that 25
our 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
has 25
the 25
feeling 25
of 25
a 25
much 25
higher 25
vocation 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
merely 25
spelling 25
out 25
phenomena 25
according 25
to 25
synthetical 25
unity 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
read 25
them 25
as 25
experience 25
and 25
that 25
our 25
reason 25
naturally 25
raises 25
itself 25
to 25
cognitions 25
far 25
too 25
elevated 25
to 25
admit 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
given 25
by 25
experience 25
corresponding 25
to 25
them 25
cognitions 25
which 25
are 25
nevertheless 25
real 25
and 25
are 25
not 25
mere 25
phantoms 25
of 25
the 25
brain 25
this 25
philosopher 25
found 25
his 25
ideas 25
especially 25
in 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
practical 25
that 25
is 25
which 25
rests 25
upon 25
freedom 25
which 25
in 25
its 25
turn 25
ranks 25
under 25
cognitions 25
that 25
are 25
the 25
peculiar 25
product 25
of 25
reason 25
he 25
who 25
would 25
derive 25
from 25
experience 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
virtue 25
who 25
would 25
make 25
as 25
many 25
have 25
really 25
done 25
that 25
which 25
at 25
best 25
can 25
but 25
serve 25
as 25
an 25
imperfectly 25
illustrative 25
example 25
a 25
model 25
for 25
or 25
the 25
formation 25
of 25
a 25
perfectly 25
adequate 25
idea 25
on 25
the 25
subject 25
would 25
in 25
fact 25
transform 25
virtue 25
into 25
a 25
nonentity 25
changeable 25
according 25
to 25
time 25
and 25
circumstance 25
and 25
utterly 25
incapable 25
of 25
being 25
employed 25
as 25
a 25
rule 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
every 25
one 25
is 25
conscious 25
that 25
when 25
any 25
one 25
is 25
held 25
up 25
to 25
him 25
as 25
a 25
model 25
of 25
virtue 25
he 25
compares 25
this 25
socalled 25
model 25

the 25
very 25
miserable 25

pernicious 25
pretext 25

impracticability 25

the 25
greatest 25
possible 25
human 25
freedom 25

the 25
former 25

to 25

the 25
least 25
a 25
necessary 25
idea 25

must 25
be 25
placed 25
at 25
the 25

only 25
of 25
the 25
first 25
plan 25

the 25
constitution 25

a 25
state 25

of 25
all 25
its 25
laws 25

in 25
this 25
it 25
not 25
necessary 25
at 25
the 25
outset 25
to 25
take 25
account 25
of 25
the 25
obstacles 25
which 25
lie 25
in 25
our 25
wayobstacles 25
which 25
perhaps 25
do 25
not 25
necessarily 25
arise 25
from 25
the 25
character 25
of 25
human 25
nature 25
but 25
rather 25
from 25
the 25
previous 25
neglect 25
of 25
true 25
ideas 25
in 25
legislation 25
for 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
pernicious 25
and 25
more 25
unworthy 25
of 25
a 25
philosopher 25
than 25
the 25
vulgar 25
appeal 25
to 25
a 25
socalled 25
adverse 25
experience 25
which 25
indeed 25
would 25
not 25
have 25
existed 25
if 25
those 25
institutions 25
had 25
been 25
established 25
at 25
the 25
proper 25
time 25
and 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
ideas 25
while 25
instead 25
of 25
this 25
conceptions 25
crude 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
they 25
have 25
been 25
drawn 25
from 25
experience 25
have 25
marred 25
and 25
frustrated 25
all 25
our 25
better 25
views 25
and 25
intentions 25
the 25
more 25
legislation 25
and 25
government 25
are 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25
this 25
idea 25
the 25
more 25
rare 25
do 25
punishments 25
become 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
reasonable 25
to 25
maintain 25
as 25
plato 25
did 25
that 25
in 25
a 25
perfect 25
state 25
no 25
punishments 25
at 25
all 25
would 25
be 25
necessary 25
now 25
although 25
a 25
perfect 25
state 25
may 25
never 25
exist 25
the 25
idea 25
is 25
not 25
on 25
that 25
account 25
the 25
less 25
just 25
which 25
holds 25
up 25
this 25
maximum 25
as 25
the 25
archetype 25
or 25
standard 25
of 25
a 25
constitution 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
bring 25
legislative 25
government 25
always 25
nearer 25
and 25
nearer 25
to 25
the 25
greatest 25
possible 25
perfection 25
for 25
at 25
what 25
precise 25
degree 25
human 25
nature 25
must 25
stop 25
in 25
its 25
progress 25
and 25
how 25
wide 25
must 25
be 25
the 25
chasm 25
which 25
must 25
necessarily 25
exist 25
between 25
the 25
idea 25
and 25
its 25
realization 25
are 25
problems 25
which 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
or 25
ought 25
to 25
determine 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
destination 25
of 25
freedom 25
to 25
overstep 25
all 25
assigned 25
limits 25
between 25
itself 25
and 25
the 25
idea 25
but 25
not 25
only 25
in 25
that 25
wherein 25
human 25
reason 25
is 25
a 25
real 25
causal 25
agent 25
and 25
where 25
ideas 25
are 25
operative 25
causes 25
of 25
actions 25
and 25
their 25
objects 25

of 25
its 25

most 25
perfect 25
of 25

it 25

say 25

hence 25
in 25
the 25
conclusion 25
of 25
a 25

we 25
restrict 25

therefore 25
seek 25
for 25
first 25
an 25

another 25

the 25
presupposition 25
which 25
supposes 25
nothing 25

the 25

an 25

the 25

foundation 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25

human 25
reasonat 25

as 25
modes 25

corresponding 25
to 25
their 25
transcendental 25
employment 25
in 25

be 25
thus 25
of 25
no 25
greater 25

to 25
direct 25
the 25

we 25
again 25
light 25
upon 25
an 25
expression 25
which 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
impossible 25
to 25
dispense 25
with 25
and 25
which 25
nevertheless 25
owing 25
to 25
the 25
ambiguity 25
attaching 25
to 25
it 25
from 25

abuse 25
we 25
cannot 25
employ 25
with 25
safety 25
the 25
word 25
absolute 25
is 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
few 25
words 25
which 25
in 25
its 25
original 25
signification 25
was 25
perfectly 25
adequate 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
it 25
was 25
intended 25
to 25

no 25
other 25
word 25

lossor 25
which 25
is 25
the 25

incautious 25
and 25
loose 25
employmentof 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
followed 25
by 25
the 25
loss 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
itself 25
and 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
occupies 25
much 25
of 25
the 25
attention 25
of 25
reason 25
its 25
loss 25
would 25
be 25
greatly 25
to 25
the 25
detriment 25
of 25
all 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
the 25
word 25
absolute 25
is 25
at 25
present 25
frequently 25
used 25
to 25
denote 25
that 25
something 25
can 25
be 25
predicated 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
considered 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
intrinsically 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
absolutely 25
possible 25
would 25
signify 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
possible 25
in 25
itself 25
interne 25
which 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
the 25
least 25
that 25
one 25
can 25
predicate 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
it 25
is 25
sometimes 25
employed 25
to 25
indicate 25
that 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
valid 25
in 25
all 25
respectsfor 25
example 25
absolute 25
sovereignty 25
absolutely 25
possible 25
would 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
signify 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
possible 25
in 25
all 25
relations 25
and 25
in 25
every 25
respect 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
most 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
predicated 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
now 25
these 25
significations 25
do 25
in 25
truth 25
frequently 25
coincide 25
thus 25
for 25
example 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
intrinsically 25
impossible 25
is 25
also 25
impossible 25
in 25
all 25
relations 25
that 25
is 25
absolutely 25
impossible 25
but 25
in 25
most 25
cases 25
they 25
differ 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
toto 25
caelo 25
and 25
i 25
can 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
conclude 25
that 25
because 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
possible 25
it 25
is 25
also 25
possible 25
in 25
all 25
relations 25
and 25
therefore 25
absolutely 25
nay 25
more 25
i 25
shall 25
in 25
the 25
sequel 25
show 25
that 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
does 25
not 25
by 25
any 25
means 25
depend 25
on 25
internal 25
necessity 25
and 25
that 25
therefore 25
it 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
synonymous 25
with 25
it 25
of 25
an 25
opposite 25
which 25
is 25
intrinsically 25
impossible 25
we 25
may 25
affirm 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
all 25
respects 25
impossible 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
the 25
thing 25
itself 25
of 25
which 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
opposite 25
is 25

that 25
the 25

an 25
internal 25

this 25

in 25
certain 25
cases 25
a 25
mere 25
empty 25
word 25
with 25
which 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25

very 25

of 25
a 25
conception 25

great 25
utility 25
in 25
speculative 25

him 25

shall 25
i 25
employ 25
the 25

absolute 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
that 25

nothing 25

all 25

everything 25
that 25
immediately 25
relates 25
to 25
the 25

rather 25
to 25
their 25

itself 25

the 25
synthetical 25

cogitated 25
in 25
the 25
category 25
even 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
this 25
unity 25
may 25
hence 25
be 25
called 25
the 25
rational 25
unity 25
of 25
phenomena 25
as 25
the 25
other 25

be 25
termed 25
the 25
unity 25

the 25

has 25
an 25
immediate 25
relation 25

the 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
not 25
indeed 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
latter 25
contains 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
for 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
conditions 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
conception 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
employed 25
in 25
experience 25
because 25
no 25
experience 25
is 25
unconditioned 25
but 25
solely 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
directing 25
it 25
to 25
a 25
certain 25
unity 25
of 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
has 25
no 25
conception 25
and 25
the 25
aim 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
collect 25
into 25
an 25
absolute 25
whole 25
all 25
acts 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
hence 25
the 25
objective 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
always 25
transcendent 25
while 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
must 25
according 25
to 25
their 25
nature 25
be 25
always 25
immanent 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
limited 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
i 25
understand 25
by 25
idea 25
a 25
necessary 25
conception 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
which 25
no 25
corresponding 25
object 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
accordingly 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
at 25
present 25
under 25
consideration 25
are 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
they 25
are 25
conceptions 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
for 25
they 25
regard 25
all 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
as 25
determined 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
an 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
conditions 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
mere 25
fictions 25
but 25
natural 25
and 25
necessary 25
products 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
have 25
hence 25
a 25
necessary 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
finally 25
they 25
are 25
transcendent 25
and 25
overstep 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
all 25
experiences 25
in 25
which 25
consequently 25
no 25
object 25
can 25
ever 25
be 25
presented 25
that 25
would 25
be 25
perfectly 25
adequate 25
to 25
a 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
when 25
we 25
use 25
the 25
word 25
idea 25
we 25
say 25
as 25
regards 25
its 25
object 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
a 25
great 25
deal 25
but 25
as 25
regards 25
its 25
subject 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
respect 25
of 25
its 25
reality 25
under 25
conditions 25
of 25
experience 25
exceedingly 25
little 25
because 25
the 25
idea 25
as 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
maximum 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
completely 25
and 25
adequately 25
presented 25
in 25
concreto 25
now 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
merely 25
speculative 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
properly 25
the 25
sole 25
aim 25
and 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
approximation 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
is 25
never 25
attained 25
in 25
practice 25
is 25
the 25
same 25
thing 25
as 25
if 25
the 25
conception 25
were 25
nonexistentit 25
is 25
commonly 25
said 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
an 25
idea 25
so 25
we 25
might 25
very 25
well 25
say 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
all 25
phenomena 25
is 25
only 25
an 25
idea 25
for 25
as 25
we 25
never 25
can 25
present 25
an 25
adequate 25
representation 25
of 25
it 25
it 25
remains 25
for 25
us 25
a 25
problem 25
incapable 25
of 25
solution 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
practical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
we 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
action 25
and 25
practice 25
according 25
to 25
rules 25
an 25
idea 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
can 25
always 25
be 25
given 25
really 25
in 25
concreto 25
although 25
only 25
partially 25
nay 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
indispensable 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
practical 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
the 25
practice 25
or 25
execution 25
of 25
the 25
idea 25
is 25
always 25
limited 25
and 25
defective 25
but 25
nevertheless 25
within 25
indeterminable 25
boundaries 25
consequently 25
always 25
under 25
the 25
influence 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
absolute 25
perfection 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
practical 25
idea 25
is 25
always 25
in 25
the 25
highest 25
degree 25
fruitful 25
and 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
real 25
actions 25
indispensably 25
necessary 25
in 25
the 25
idea 25
pure 25
reason 25
possesses 25
even 25
causality 25
and 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
producing 25
that 25
which 25
its 25
conception 25
contains 25
hence 25
we 25
cannot 25
say 25
of 25
wisdom 25
in 25
a 25
disparaging 25
way 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
an 25
idea 25
for 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
necessary 25
unity 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
aims 25

must 25
be 25
for 25
all 25
practical 25
exertions 25
and 25
endeavours 25
the 25
primitive 25
condition 25
and 25
rulea 25
rule 25
which 25
if 25
not 25
constitutive 25
is 25
at 25
least 25
limitative 25
now 25
although 25
we 25
must 25
say 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
they 25
are 25
only 25
ideas 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
on 25
this 25
account 25
look 25
upon 25
them 25
as 25
superfluous 25
and 25
nugatory 25
for 25
although 25
no 25
object 25
can 25
be 25
determined 25
by 25
them 25
they 25
can 25
be 25
of 25
great 25
utility 25
unobserved 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
the 25
edifice 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
as 25
the 25
canon 25
for 25
its 25
extended 25
and 25
selfconsistent 25
exercisea 25
canon 25
which 25
indeed 25
does 25
not 25
enable 25
it 25
to 25
cognize 25
more 25
in 25
an 25
object 25
than 25
it 25
would 25
cognize 25
by 25
the 25
help 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
conceptions 25
but 25
which 25
guides 25
it 25
more 25
securely 25
in 25
its 25
cognition 25
not 25
to 25
mention 25
that 25
they 25
perhaps 25
render 25
possible 25
a 25
transition 25
from 25
our 25
conceptions 25

nature 25

nonego 25
to 25
the 25
practical 25
conceptions 25

thus 25
produce 25
for 25
even 25
ethical 25
ideas 25

all 25
this 25
must 25
be 25
looked 25
for 25
in 25
the 25
sequel 25
but 25
setting 25
aside 25
in 25
conformity 25

our 25
original 25
purpose 25
the 25

in 25
a 25

more 25

wit 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
use 25

here 25
must 25
strike 25
into 25
the 25
same 25
path 25
which 25
we 25
followed 25
in 25
our 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
shall 25
consider 25
the 25
logical 25
form 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
reason 25
that 25
we 25
may 25
see 25
whether 25
reason 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
thereby 25
a 25
source 25
of 25
conceptions 25

been 25
given 25
in 25

is 25
easy 25
to 25
perceive 25
that 25
the 25
sole 25
aim 25
of 25
pure 25

the 25

the 25

the 25
side 25
of 25

that 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
itself 25

preposit 25
the 25
whole 25

thus 25
present 25
them 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
once 25
have 25
a 25
completely 25
and 25
unconditionally 25
given 25
condition 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
further 25
necessity 25
in 25
proceeding 25
with 25
the 25

for 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25

for 25
the 25
understanding 25
takes 25
of 25
itself 25
every 25
step 25
downward 25
from 25
the 25
condition 25
to 25
the 25
conditioned 25
thus 25
the 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
are 25
available 25
only 25
for 25
ascending 25
in 25
the 25

of 25

till 25
we 25
reach 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
that 25
is 25
principles 25
as 25
regards 25
descending 25
to 25
the 25
conditioned 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
widely 25
extensive 25
logical 25
use 25
which 25
reason 25
makes 25
of 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
but 25
that 25
a 25
transcendental 25
use 25
thereof 25
is 25
impossible 25
and 25
that 25
when 25
we 25
form 25
an 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
such 25

of 25
all 25
future 25

in 25
the 25
world 25
this 25
idea 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
ens 25
rationis 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
fiction 25
of 25
thought 25
and 25
not 25
a 25
necessary 25
presupposition 25
of 25
reason 25
for 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25

presupposes 25
the 25
totality 25
of 25
its 25
conditions 25
but 25
not 25
of 25
its 25
consequences 25
consequently 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
transcendental 25
ideaand 25
it 25
is 25
with 25
these 25
alone 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
at 25
present 25
occupied 25
finally 25
it 25
is 25
obvious 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
among 25
the 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
a 25
certain 25
connection 25
and 25
unity 25
and 25
that 25
pure 25
reason 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
them 25
collects 25
all 25
its 25
cognitions 25
into 25
one 25
system 25
from 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
self 25
to 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
through 25
these 25
to 25
the 25
supreme 25
being 25
the 25
progression 25
is 25
so 25
natural 25
that 25
it 25
seems 25
to 25
resemble 25
the 25
logical 25
march 25
of 25
reason 25
from 25
the 25
premisses 25
to 25
the 25
conclusion 25
now 25
whether 25
there 25
lies 25
unobserved 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
these 25
ideas 25
an 25
analogy 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
kind 25
as 25
exists 25
between 25
the 25
logical 25
and 25
transcendental 25
procedure 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
another 25
of 25
those 25
questions 25
the 25
answer 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
expect 25
till 25
we 25
arrive 25
at 25
a 25
more 25
advanced 25
stage 25
in 25
our 25
inquiries 25
in 25
this 25
cursory 25
and 25
preliminary 25
view 25
we 25
have 25
meanwhile 25
reached 25
our 25
aim 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
dispelled 25
the 25
ambiguity 25
which 25
attached 25
to 25
the 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
from 25

thus 25
marked 25
out 25

said 25
that 25
the 25

of 25
a 25
merely 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
is 25
something 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
conception 25

the 25
idea 25

necessary 25
product 25

original 25

that 25
is 25
adequate 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
given 25
by 25
reason 25
is 25
impossible 25
for 25
such 25
an 25
object 25
must 25
be 25
capable 25

being 25
presented 25

intuited 25
in 25
a 25
possible 25
experience 25
but 25
we 25
should 25
express 25
our 25
meaning 25
better 25
and 25
with 25
less 25
risk 25
of 25
being 25
misunderstood 25
if 25
we 25
said 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
knowledge 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
which 25
perfectly 25
corresponds 25
to 25
an 25
idea 25
although 25
we 25
may 25
possess 25
a 25
problematical 25
conception 25
thereof 25
now 25
the 25
transcendental 25
subjective 25
reality 25
at 25
least 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
rests 25
upon 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
led 25
to 25
such 25
ideas 25
by 25
a 25
necessary 25
procedure 25
of 25
reason 25
there 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
syllogisms 25
which 25
contain 25
no 25
empirical 25
premisses 25
and 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
conclude 25
from 25
something 25
that 25
we 25
do 25
know 25
to 25
something 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
even 25
possess 25
a 25
conception 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
nevertheless 25
by 25
an 25
unavoidable 25
illusion 25
ascribe 25
objective 25
reality 25
such 25
arguments 25
are 25
as 25

their 25
result 25
rather 25
to 25
be 25
termed 25
sophisms 25
than 25
syllogisms 25
although 25
indeed 25
as 25
regards 25
their 25
origin 25
they 25
are 25
very 25
well 25
entitled 25
to 25
the 25
latter 25
name 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
fictions 25
or 25
accidental 25
products 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
are 25
necessitated 25
by 25
its 25
very 25
nature 25

are 25
sophisms 25
not 25
of 25
men 25
but 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
herself 25
from 25
which 25
the 25
wisest 25
cannot 25
free 25
himself 25
after 25
long 25
labour 25
he 25
may 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
guard 25
against 25
the 25
error 25

he 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
thoroughly 25
rid 25
of 25
the 25
illusion 25
which 25
continually 25
mocks 25

misleads 25
him 25
of 25
these 25
dialectical 25
arguments 25

are 25
three 25
kinds 25

the 25
number 25

the 25

the 25

a 25

in 25
this 25

the 25

its 25
foundation 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25

parent 25
of 25
an 25
unavoidable 25
though 25
not 25
insoluble 25
mental 25
illusion 25
we 25
now 25
come 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
was 25
not 25
inserted 25
in 25
the 25
general 25
list 25
of 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
and 25
yet 25
must 25
be 25
reckoned 25
with 25
them 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
without 25
in 25
the 25
least 25
altering 25
or 25
indicating 25
a 25
deficiency 25
in 25
that 25
table 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
conception 25
or 25
if 25
the 25
term 25
is 25
preferred 25
the 25
judgement 25
i 25
think 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
readily 25
perceived 25
that 25
this 25
thought 25
is 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
the 25
vehicle 25
of 25
all 25
conceptions 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
consequently 25
of 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
also 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
regarded 25
as 25
a 25
transcendental 25
conception 25
although 25
it 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
peculiar 25
claim 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
ranked 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
its 25
only 25
use 25
is 25
to 25
indicate 25
that 25
all 25
thought 25
is 25
accompanied 25
by 25
consciousness 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
pure 25
as 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
from 25
empirical 25
content 25
impressions 25
of 25
the 25
senses 25
it 25
enables 25
us 25
to 25
distinguish 25
two 25
different 25
kinds 25
of 25
objects 25
i 25
as 25
thinking 25
am 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
and 25
am 25
called 25
soul 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
senses 25
is 25
called 25
body 25
thus 25
the 25
expression 25
i 25
as 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
designates 25
the 25
objectmatter 25
of 25
psychology 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
the 25
rational 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
science 25
i 25
desire 25
to 25
know 25
nothing 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
but 25
what 25
independently 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
which 25
determines 25
me 25
in 25
concreto 25
may 25
be 25
concluded 25
from 25
this 25
conception 25
i 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
appears 25
in 25
all 25
thought 25
now 25
the 25
rational 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
is 25
really 25
an 25
undertaking 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
for 25
if 25
the 25
smallest 25
empirical 25
element 25
of 25
thought 25
if 25
any 25
particular 25
perception 25
of 25
my 25
internal 25
state 25
were 25
to 25
be 25
introduced 25
among 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
cognition 25
of 25
this 25
science 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
a 25
rational 25
but 25
an 25
empirical 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
we 25
have 25
thus 25
before 25
us 25
a 25
pretended 25
science 25
raised 25
upon 25
the 25
single 25
proposition 25
i 25
think 25
whose 25
foundation 25
or 25
want 25
of 25
foundation 25
we 25
may 25
very 25
properly 25
and 25
agreeably 25
with 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
a 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
here 25
examine 25
it 25
ought 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
objected 25
that 25
in 25
this 25
proposition 25
which 25
expresses 25
the 25
perception 25
of 25
ones 25
self 25
an 25
internal 25
experience 25
is 25
asserted 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
the 25
rational 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
which 25
is 25
founded 25
upon 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
pure 25
but 25
partly 25
founded 25
upon 25
an 25
empirical 25
principle 25
for 25
this 25
internal 25
perception 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
mere 25
apperception 25
i 25
think 25
which 25
in 25
fact 25
renders 25
all 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
possible 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
say 25
i 25
think 25
substance 25
cause 25
etc 25
for 25
internal 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
its 25
possibility 25
or 25
perception 25
in 25
general 25
and 25
its 25
relation 25
to 25
other 25
perceptions 25
unless 25
some 25
particular 25
distinction 25
or 25
determination 25
thereof 25
is 25
empirically 25
given 25
cannot 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
but 25
as 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
and 25
belongs 25
to 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
every 25
experience 25
which 25
is 25
certainly 25
transcendental 25
the 25
smallest 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
example 25
only 25
pleasure 25
or 25
pain 25
that 25
should 25
be 25
included 25
in 25
the 25
general 25
representation 25
of 25
selfconsciousness 25
would 25
immediately 25
change 25
the 25
rational 25
into 25
an 25
empirical 25
psychology 25
i 25
think 25
is 25
therefore 25
the 25
only 25
text 25
of 25
rational 25
psychology 25
from 25
which 25
it 25
must 25
develop 25
its 25
whole 25
system 25
it 25
is 25
manifest 25
that 25
this 25
thought 25
when 25
applied 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
myself 25
can 25
contain 25
nothing 25
but 25
transcendental 25
predicates 25
thereof 25
because 25
the 25
least 25
empirical 25
predicate 25
would 25
destroy 25
the 25
purity 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
and 25
its 25
independence 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
but 25
we 25
shall 25
have 25
to 25
follow 25
here 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
only 25

judged 25

better 25
to 25
sacrifice 25
elegance 25
to 25
perspicuity 25
from 25
these 25

originate 25
all 25
the 25

alone 25
without 25

substance 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25

us 25
the 25
conception 25

thus 25
it 25

the 25
principle 25

touching 25
the 25

we 25
can 25
however 25
lay 25
at 25
the 25

nothing 25

the 25
simple 25

perfectly 25
contentless 25
representation 25

merely 25
a 25
consciousness 25
which 25
accompanies 25
all 25
conceptions 25
by 25
this 25
i 25

he 25
or 25
it 25
who 25
or 25
which 25
thinks 25
nothing 25
more 25
is 25
represented 25
than 25
a 25
transcendental 25
subject 25
of 25
thought 25
x 25
which 25
is 25
cognized 25
only 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
thoughts 25
that 25
are 25
its 25
predicates 25
and 25
of 25
which 25
apart 25
from 25
these 25
we 25
cannot 25
form 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
hence 25
in 25
a 25
perpetual 25
circle 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
we 25
must 25
always 25
employ 25
it 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
frame 25
any 25
judgement 25
respecting 25
it 25
and 25
this 25
inconvenience 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
impossible 25
to 25
rid 25
ourselves 25
of 25
because 25
consciousness 25
in 25
itself 25
is 25
not 25
so 25
much 25
a 25
representation 25
distinguishing 25
a 25
particular 25
object 25
as 25
a 25
form 25
of 25
representation 25
in 25
general 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
termed 25
cognition 25
for 25
in 25

by 25
cognition 25
alone 25
do 25
i 25
think 25
anything 25
it 25
must 25
however 25
appear 25
extraordinary 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
that 25
the 25
condition 25
under 25
which 25
i 25
think 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
consequently 25
a 25
property 25
of 25
my 25
subject 25
should 25
be 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
likewise 25
valid 25
for 25
every 25
existence 25
which 25
thinks 25
and 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
presume 25
to 25
base 25
upon 25
a 25
seemingly 25
empirical 25
proposition 25
a 25
judgement 25
which 25
is 25
apodeictic 25
and 25
universal 25
to 25
wit 25
that 25
everything 25
which 25
thinks 25
is 25
constituted 25
as 25
the 25
voice 25
of 25
my 25
consciousness 25
declares 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
a 25
selfconscious 25
being 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
this 25
belief 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
we 25
necessarily 25
attribute 25
to 25
things 25
a 25
priori 25
all 25
the 25
properties 25
which 25
constitute 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
we 25
can 25
cogitate 25
them 25
now 25
i 25
cannot 25
obtain 25
the 25
least 25
representation 25
of 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
external 25
experience 25
but 25
solely 25
through 25
selfconsciousness 25
such 25
objects 25
are 25
consequently 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
transference 25
of 25
this 25
consciousness 25
of 25
mine 25
to 25
other 25
things 25
which 25
can 25
only 25
thus 25
be 25
represented 25

in 25
a 25
problematical 25
sense 25
not 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
contains 25
a 25
perception 25
of 25
an 25
existence 25

the 25

what 25
properties 25
may 25
be 25
inferred 25
from 25
so 25
simple 25
a 25

predicated 25

at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
our 25
pure 25
rational 25
cognition 25

there 25
lay 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
mere 25
cogitoif 25
we 25
could 25
likewise 25
call 25
in 25
aid 25
observations 25
on 25
the 25
play 25
of 25
our 25
thoughts 25

the 25
thence 25
derived 25
natural 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
thinking 25
self 25
there 25
would 25
arise 25
an 25
empirical 25
psychology 25
which 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
kind 25
of 25
physiology 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
and 25
might 25
possibly 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
explaining 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
that 25
sense 25
but 25
it 25
could 25
never 25
be 25
available 25
for 25
discovering 25
those 25
properties 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
belong 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
such 25
as 25
the 25
quality 25
of 25
simplicity 25
nor 25
could 25
it 25
make 25
any 25
apodeictic 25
enunciation 25
on 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
thinking 25
beings 25
it 25
would 25
therefore 25
not 25
be 25
a 25
rational 25
psychology 25
now 25
as 25
the 25
proposition 25
i 25
think 25
in 25
the 25
problematical 25
sense 25

is 25
the 25
constant 25
accompaniment 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
categories 25
it 25
is 25
manifest 25
that 25
conclusions 25
are 25
drawn 25
from 25
it 25
only 25
by 25
a 25
transcendental 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
this 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
excludes 25
all 25
empirical 25
elements 25
and 25
we 25
cannot 25
as 25
has 25
been 25
shown 25
above 25
have 25
any 25
favourable 25
conception 25
beforehand 25
of 25
its 25
procedure 25
we 25
shall 25
therefore 25
follow 25
with 25
a 25
critical 25
eye 25
this 25
proposition 25
through 25
all 25
the 25
predicaments 25
of 25
pure 25
psychology 25
but 25
we 25
shall 25
for 25
brevitys 25
sake 25
allow 25
this 25
examination 25
to 25
proceed 25
in 25
an 25
uninterrupted 25
connection 25
before 25
entering 25
on 25
this 25
task 25
however 25
the 25
following 25
general 25
remark 25
may 25
help 25
to 25
quicken 25
our 25
attention 25
to 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
argument 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
merely 25
through 25
my 25
thinking 25
that 25
i 25
cognize 25
an 25
object 25
but 25
only 25
through 25
my 25
determining 25
a 25
given 25
intuition 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
consciousness 25
in 25
which 25
all 25
thinking 25
consists 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
i 25
cognize 25
myself 25
not 25
through 25
my 25
being 25
conscious 25
of 25
myself 25
as 25
thinking 25
but 25
only 25
when 25
i 25
am 25
conscious 25
of 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
myself 25
as 25
determined 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
function 25
of 25
thought 25
all 25
the 25
modi 25
of 25
selfconsciousness 25
in 25
thought 25
are 25
hence 25
not 25
conceptions 25
of 25
objects 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understandingcategories 25
they 25
are 25
mere 25
logical 25
functions 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
present 25
to 25
thought 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
be 25
cognized 25
and 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
present 25
my 25
self 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
not 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
the 25
determining 25
but 25
only 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
determinable 25
self 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
my 25
internal 25
intuition 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
manifold 25
contained 25
in 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
connected 25
conformably 25
with 25

all 25
judgements 25

am 25
the 25
determining 25
subject 25
of 25
that 25
relation 25

constitutes 25
a 25
judgement 25

that 25
the 25

be 25
considered 25
as 25
in 25
thought 25
always 25
a 25
subject 25

as 25
a 25
thing 25
which 25

to 25
thought 25

an 25
apodeictic 25

identical 25
proposition 25
but 25
this 25
proposition 25
does 25
not 25
signify 25
that 25
i 25
as 25

for 25
myself 25
a 25

this 25
latter 25
statement 25
an 25
ambitious 25
onerequires 25
to 25
be 25
supported 25
by 25
data 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
thought 25
and 25
are 25
perhaps 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
i 25
consider 25
the 25
thinking 25
self 25
merely 25
as 25
such 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
the 25
thinking 25
self 25
at 25
all 25
that 25
the 25
i 25

ego 25
of 25
apperception 25
and 25
consequently 25
in 25
all 25
thought 25
is 25
singular 25

simple 25
and 25
cannot 25
be 25
resolved 25
into 25
a 25
plurality 25
of 25
subjects 25
and 25
therefore 25
indicates 25
a 25
logically 25
simple 25
subjectthis 25
is 25
selfevident 25
from 25
the 25
very 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ego 25
and 25
is 25
consequently 25
an 25
analytical 25
proposition 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
not 25
tantamount 25
to 25
declaring 25
that 25
the 25
thinking 25
ego 25
is 25
a 25
simple 25
substance 25
for 25
this 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substance 25
always 25
relates 25
to 25
intuitions 25
which 25
with 25
me 25
cannot 25
be 25
other 25
than 25
sensuous 25
and 25
which 25
consequently 25
lie 25
completely 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
its 25
thought 25
but 25
to 25
this 25
sphere 25
belongs 25
the 25
affirmation 25
that 25
the 25
ego 25
is 25
simple 25
in 25
thought 25
it 25
would 25
indeed 25
be 25
surprising 25
if 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substance 25
which 25
in 25
other 25
cases 25
requires 25
so 25
much 25
labour 25
to 25
distinguish 25
from 25
the 25
other 25
elements 25
presented 25
by 25
intuitionso 25
much 25
trouble 25
too 25
to 25
discover 25
whether 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
simple 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
parts 25
of 25
mattershould 25
be 25
presented 25
immediately 25
to 25
me 25
as 25
if 25

poorest 25
mental 25
representation 25

proposition 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
my 25
self 25
amidst 25
all 25
the 25
manifold 25
representations 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
conscious 25

likewise 25
a 25
proposition 25
lying 25
in 25
the 25
conceptions 25
themselves 25
and 25
is 25
consequently 25
analytical 25
but 25
this 25

of 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
conscious 25
in 25
all 25
its 25
representations 25

not 25
relate 25
to 25
or 25
concern 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
by 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
given 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
this 25
proposition 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
enounce 25
the 25
identity 25
of 25
the 25
person 25
by 25
which 25
is 25
understood 25
the 25

of 25
the 25

variation 25
of 25

not 25
a 25
mere 25
analysis 25
of 25
the 25

synthetical 25

external 25
to 25
meamong 25
which 25
my 25
body 25
also 25
is 25
reckoned 25
this 25
is 25
also 25
an 25
analytical 25
proposition 25
for 25
other 25
things 25
are 25
exactly 25
those 25
which 25
i 25
think 25
as 25
different 25
or 25
distinguished 25
from 25
myself 25
but 25
whether 25
this 25
consciousness 25
of 25
myself 25
is 25
possible 25
without 25
things 25
external 25
to 25
me 25
and 25
whether 25
therefore 25
i 25
can 25
exist 25
merely 25
as 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
without 25
being 25
mancannot 25
be 25
known 25
or 25
inferred 25
from 25
this 25
proposition 25
thus 25
we 25
have 25
gained 25
nothing 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
myself 25
as 25
object 25
by 25
the 25
analysis 25
of 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
self 25
in 25
thought 25
the 25
logical 25
exposition 25
of 25
thought 25
in 25
general 25
is 25
mistaken 25
for 25
a 25
metaphysical 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
our 25
critique 25
would 25
be 25
an 25
investigation 25
utterly 25
superfluous 25
if 25
there 25
existed 25
a 25
possibility 25
of 25
proving 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
all 25
thinking 25
beings 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
simple 25
substances 25
as 25
such 25
therefore 25
possess 25
the 25
inseparable 25
attribute 25
of 25
personality 25
and 25
are 25
conscious 25
of 25
their 25
existence 25
apart 25
from 25
and 25
unconnected 25
with 25
matter 25
for 25
we 25
should 25
thus 25
have 25
taken 25
a 25
step 25
beyond 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
and 25
have 25
penetrated 25
into 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
noumena 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
right 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
denied 25
us 25
of 25
extending 25
our 25
knowledge 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
establishing 25
ourselves 25
and 25
under 25
a 25
favouring 25
star 25
appropriating 25
to 25
ourselves 25
possessions 25
in 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
proposition 25
every 25
thinking 25
being 25
as 25
such 25
is 25
simple 25
substance 25
is 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
because 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
it 25
goes 25
beyond 25
the 25
conception 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
it 25
and 25
adds 25
to 25
the 25
mere 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
place 25
annexes 25
a 25
predicate 25
that 25
of 25
simplicity 25
to 25
the 25
latter 25
conceptiona 25
predicate 25
which 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
have 25
discovered 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
it 25
would 25
follow 25
that 25
a 25
priori 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
are 25
possible 25
and 25
legitimate 25
not 25
only 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
maintained 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
as 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
this 25
experience 25
itself 25
but 25
are 25
applicable 25
to 25
things 25
in 25
themselvesan 25
inference 25
which 25
makes 25
an 25
end 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
of 25
this 25
critique 25
and 25
obliges 25
us 25
to 25
fall 25
back 25
on 25
the 25
old 25
mode 25
of 25
metaphysical 25
procedure 25
but 25
indeed 25
the 25
danger 25
is 25
not 25
so 25
great 25
if 25
we 25
look 25
a 25
little 25
closer 25
into 25
the 25
question 25
there 25
lurks 25
in 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
rational 25
psychology 25
a 25
paralogism 25
which 25
is 25
represented 25
in 25
the 25
following 25
syllogism 25
that 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
cogitated 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
subject 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
subject 25
and 25
is 25
therefore 25
substance 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
considered 25
merely 25
as 25
such 25
cannot 25
be 25
cogitated 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
subject 25
therefore 25
it 25
exists 25
also 25
as 25
such 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
substance 25
in 25
the 25
major 25
we 25
speak 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
cogitated 25
generally 25
and 25
in 25
every 25
relation 25
consequently 25
as 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
intuition 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
minor 25
we 25
speak 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
being 25
only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
regards 25
itself 25
as 25
subject 25
relatively 25
to 25
thought 25
and 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
consciousness 25
but 25
not 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
intuition 25
by 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
presented 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
thought 25
thus 25
the 25
conclusion 25
is 25
here 25
arrived 25
at 25
by 25
a 25
sophisma 25
figurae 25
dictionis 25
footnote 25
thought 25
is 25
taken 25
in 25
the 25
two 25
premisses 25
in 25
two 25
totally 25
different 25
senses 25
in 25
the 25
major 25
it 25
is 25
considered 25
as 25
relating 25
and 25
applying 25
to 25
objects 25
in 25
general 25
consequently 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
intuition 25
also 25
in 25
the 25
minor 25
we 25
understand 25
it 25
as 25
relating 25
merely 25
to 25
selfconsciousness 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
cogitate 25
an 25
object 25
but 25
merely 25
the 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
selfconsciousness 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
as 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
thought 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
premiss 25
we 25
speak 25
of 25
things 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
cogitated 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
subjects 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
speak 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
of 25
thought 25
all 25
objects 25
being 25
abstracted 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
ego 25
is 25
always 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
consciousness 25
hence 25
the 25
conclusion 25
cannot 25
be 25
i 25
cannot 25
exist 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
subject 25
but 25
only 25
i 25
can 25
in 25
cogitating 25
my 25
existence 25
employ 25
my 25
ego 25
only 25
as 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
an 25
identical 25
proposition 25
and 25
throws 25
no 25
light 25
on 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
that 25
this 25
famous 25
argument 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
paralogism 25
will 25
be 25
plain 25
to 25
any 25
one 25
who 25
will 25
consider 25
the 25
general 25
remark 25
which 25
precedes 25
our 25
exposition 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
and 25
the 25
section 25
on 25
noumena 25
for 25
it 25
was 25
there 25
proved 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
which 25
can 25
exist 25
per 25
seonly 25
as 25
a 25
subject 25
and 25
never 25
as 25
a 25
predicate 25
possesses 25
no 25
objective 25
reality 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
can 25
never 25
know 25
whether 25
there 25
exists 25
any 25
object 25
to 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
consequently 25
the 25
conception 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
conception 25
and 25
from 25
it 25
we 25
derive 25
no 25
proper 25
knowledge 25
if 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
to 25
indicate 25
by 25
the 25
term 25
substance 25
an 25
object 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
given 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
become 25
a 25
cognition 25
we 25
must 25
have 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
a 25
permanent 25
intuition 25
as 25
the 25
indispensable 25
condition 25
of 25
its 25
objective 25
reality 25
for 25
through 25
intuition 25
alone 25
can 25
an 25
object 25
be 25
given 25
but 25
in 25
internal 25
intuition 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
permanent 25
for 25
the 25
ego 25
is 25
but 25
the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
my 25
thought 25
if 25
then 25
we 25
appeal 25
merely 25
to 25
thought 25
we 25
cannot 25
discover 25
the 25
necessary 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substancethat 25
is 25
of 25
a 25
subject 25
existing 25
per 25
seto 25
the 25
subject 25
as 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
nature 25
of 25
substance 25
which 25
is 25
connected 25
with 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
is 25
shown 25
to 25
be 25
also 25
invalid 25
and 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
fact 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
logical 25
qualitative 25
unity 25
of 25
selfconsciousness 25
in 25
thought 25
whilst 25
we 25
remain 25
perfectly 25
ignorant 25
whether 25
the 25
subject 25
is 25
composite 25
or 25
not 25
refutation 25
of 25
the 25
argument 25
of 25
mendelssohn 25
for 25
the 25
substantiality 25
or 25
permanence 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
this 25
acute 25
philosopher 25
easily 25
perceived 25
the 25
insufficiency 25
of 25
the 25
common 25
argument 25
which 25
attempts 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
the 25
soulit 25
being 25
granted 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
simple 25
beingcannot 25
perish 25
by 25
dissolution 25
or 25
decomposition 25
he 25
saw 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
impossible 25
for 25
it 25
to 25
cease 25
to 25
be 25
by 25
extinction 25
or 25
disappearance 25
he 25
endeavoured 25
to 25
prove 25
in 25
his 25
phaedo 25
that 25
the 25
soul 25
cannot 25
be 25
annihilated 25
by 25
showing 25
that 25
a 25
simple 25
being 25
cannot 25
cease 25
to 25
exist 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
he 25
said 25
a 25
simple 25
existence 25
cannot 25
diminish 25
nor 25
gradually 25
lose 25
portions 25
of 25
its 25
being 25
and 25
thus 25
be 25
by 25
degrees 25
reduced 25
to 25
nothing 25
for 25
it 25
possesses 25
no 25
parts 25
and 25
therefore 25
no 25
multiplicity 25
between 25
the 25
moment 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
and 25
the 25
moment 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
no 25
time 25
can 25
be 25
discoveredwhich 25
is 25
impossible 25
but 25
this 25
philosopher 25
did 25
not 25
consider 25
that 25
granting 25
the 25
soul 25
to 25
possess 25
this 25
simple 25
nature 25
which 25
contains 25
no 25
parts 25
external 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
consequently 25
no 25
extensive 25
quantity 25
we 25
cannot 25
refuse 25
to 25
it 25
any 25
less 25
than 25
to 25
any 25
other 25
being 25
intensive 25
quantity 25
that 25
is 25
a 25
degree 25
of 25
reality 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
all 25
its 25
faculties 25
nay 25
to 25
all 25
that 25
constitutes 25
its 25
existence 25
but 25
this 25
degree 25
of 25
reality 25
can 25
become 25
less 25
and 25
less 25
through 25
an 25
infinite 25
series 25
of 25
smaller 25
degrees 25
it 25
follows 25
therefore 25
that 25
this 25
supposed 25
substancethis 25
thing 25
the 25
permanence 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
assured 25
in 25
any 25
other 25
way 25
may 25
if 25
not 25
by 25
decomposition 25
by 25

the 25
unity 25

cannot 25
allow 25
him 25

ascertain 25
its 25

how 25
this 25

the 25

of 25
its 25
nature 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
very 25
fact 25

its 25

nothing 25

at 25

from 25
this 25
follows 25
the 25
impossibility 25
of 25
a 25
definition 25
on 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
materialism 25
of 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
my 25
ego 25
as 25
a 25
merely 25
thinking 25
subject 25
but 25
because 25
my 25
existence 25
is 25
considered 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
proposition 25
as 25

not 25

this 25
would 25
be 25
predicating 25
of 25
them 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
but 25
only 25
i 25
exist 25
thinking 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
quite 25
empirical 25
and 25
contains 25
the 25
determinability 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
merely 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
my 25
representations 25
in 25
time 25
but 25
as 25
i 25
require 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
something 25
that 25
is 25
permanent 25
such 25
as 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
in 25
internal 25
intuition 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
my 25
existence 25
whether 25
as 25
substance 25
or 25
as 25
accident 25
cannot 25
be 25
determined 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
this 25
simple 25
selfconsciousness 25
thus 25
if 25
materialism 25
is 25
inadequate 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
i 25
exist 25
spiritualism 25
is 25
likewise 25
as 25
insufficient 25
and 25
the 25
conclusion 25
is 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
utterly 25
unable 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
any 25

relates 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
apart 25
from 25
external 25
objects 25

indeed 25
how 25
should 25
it 25
be 25
possible 25
merely 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
consciousnesswhich 25
we 25
cognize 25
only 25
for 25
the 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
indispensable 25

any 25
rational 25
psychology 25
as 25
a 25
doctrine 25
furnishing 25
any 25
addition 25
to 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
ourselves 25
it 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
discipline 25
which 25
sets 25
impassable 25
limits 25
to 25
speculative 25
reason 25
in 25
this 25
region 25
of 25
thought 25
to 25
prevent 25
it 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
from 25
throwing 25
itself 25
into 25
the 25
arms 25
of 25
a 25
soulless 25
materialism 25

other 25
from 25
losing 25
itself 25
in 25
the 25
mazes 25
of 25
a 25
baseless 25
spiritualism 25
it 25
teaches 25
us 25
to 25
consider 25
this 25
refusal 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25
to 25
give 25
any 25
satisfactory 25
answer 25

questions 25
which 25
reach 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
this 25
our 25
human 25
life 25
as 25
a 25
hint 25
to 25
abandon 25
fruitless 25
speculation 25
and 25
to 25
direct 25
to 25
a 25
practical 25
use 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
ourselveswhich 25
although 25
applicable 25
only 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
receives 25
its 25
principles 25
from 25
a 25
higher 25
source 25
and 25
regulates 25
its 25
procedure 25
as 25
if 25
our 25
destiny 25
reached 25
far 25
beyond 25
the 25
boundaries 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
life 25
from 25
all 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
rational 25
psychology 25
has 25
its 25
origin 25
in 25
a 25
mere 25
misunderstanding 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
consciousness 25
which 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
is 25
considered 25
to 25
be 25
an 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
and 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
substance 25
is 25
applied 25
to 25
the 25
intuition 25
but 25
this 25
unity 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
unity 25
in 25
thought 25
by 25
which 25
no 25
object 25
is 25
given 25
to 25
which 25
therefore 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
substancewhich 25
always 25
presupposes 25
a 25
given 25
intuition 25
cannot 25
be 25
applied 25
consequently 25
the 25
subject 25
cannot 25
be 25
cognized 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
the 25

which 25
the 25

already 25

an 25

proposition 25

contains 25
the 25
proposition 25

i 25
cannot 25

the 25

the 25

an 25
undetermined 25

that 25

sensibility 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
this 25
proposition 25

it 25
precedes 25

in 25
relation 25
to 25
time 25
and 25
existence 25
in 25
this 25
proposition 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
category 25
as 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
apply 25
to 25
an 25
undetermined 25
given 25
object 25
but 25
only 25
to 25
one 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
conception 25
and 25
about 25
which 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
know 25
whether 25
it 25
does 25
or 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
apart 25
from 25
this 25
conception 25
an 25
undetermined 25
perception 25
signifies 25
here 25
merely 25
something 25
real 25
that 25
has 25
been 25
given 25
only 25
however 25
to 25
thought 25
in 25
generalbut 25
not 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
nor 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
noumenon 25
but 25
only 25
as 25
something 25
that 25
really 25
exists 25
and 25
is 25
designated 25
as 25
such 25
in 25
the 25
proposition 25
i 25
think 25
for 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
remarked 25
that 25
when 25
i 25
call 25
the 25
proposition 25
i 25
think 25
an 25
empirical 25
proposition 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
thereby 25
mean 25
that 25
the 25
ego 25
in 25
the 25
proposition 25
is 25
an 25
empirical 25
representation 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
it 25
is 25
purely 25
intellectual 25
because 25
it 25
belongs 25
to 25
thought 25
in 25
general 25
but 25
without 25
some 25
empirical 25
representation 25
which 25
presents 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
material 25
for 25
thought 25
the 25
mental 25
act 25
i 25
think 25
would 25
not 25
take 25
place 25
and 25
the 25
empirical 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
application 25
or 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
intellectual 25
faculty 25
thus 25
then 25
appears 25
the 25
vanity 25
of 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
establishing 25
a 25
cognition 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
extend 25
its 25
rule 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experiencea 25
cognition 25
which 25
is 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
interests 25
of 25
humanity 25
and 25
thus 25
is 25
proved 25
the 25
futility 25
of 25
the 25
attempt 25
of 25
speculative 25
philosophy 25
in 25
this 25
region 25
of 25
thought 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
interest 25
of 25
thought 25
the 25
severity 25
of 25
criticism 25
has 25
rendered 25
to 25
reason 25
a 25
not 25
unimportant 25
service 25
by 25
the 25
demonstration 25
of 25
the 25
impossibility 25
of 25
making 25
any 25
dogmatical 25
affirmation 25
concerning 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
beyond 25
the 25
boundaries 25
of 25
experience 25
she 25
has 25
thus 25
fortified 25
reason 25
against 25
all 25
affirmations 25
of 25
the 25
contrary 25
now 25
this 25
can 25
be 25
accomplished 25
in 25
only 25
two 25
ways 25
either 25
our 25
proposition 25
must 25
be 25
proved 25
apodeictically 25
or 25
if 25
this 25
is 25
unsuccessful 25
the 25
sources 25
of 25
this 25
inability 25
must 25
be 25
sought 25
for 25
and 25
if 25
these 25
are 25
discovered 25
to 25
exist 25
in 25
the 25
natural 25
and 25
necessary 25
limitation 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25
our 25
opponents 25
must 25
submit 25
to 25
the 25
same 25
law 25
of 25
renunciation 25
and 25
refrain 25
from 25
advancing 25
claims 25
to 25
dogmatic 25
assertion 25
but 25
the 25
right 25
say 25
rather 25
the 25
necessity 25
to 25
admit 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
upon 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
practical 25
conjoined 25
with 25
the 25
speculative 25
use 25
of 25
reason 25
has 25
lost 25
nothing 25
by 25
this 25
renunciation 25
for 25
the 25
merely 25
speculative 25
proof 25
has 25
never 25
had 25
any 25
influence 25
upon 25
the 25
common 25
reason 25
of 25
men 25
it 25
stands 25
upon 25
the 25
point 25
of 25
a 25
hair 25
so 25
that 25
even 25
the 25
schools 25

not 25

which 25
we 25
are 25
here 25

it 25

be 25
an 25
object 25

a 25
sufficient 25
answer 25
may 25
be 25
found 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
in 25
our 25
system 25
the 25
difficulty 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
execution 25
of 25
this 25
task 25
consists 25
as 25
is 25
well 25
known 25
in 25
the 25
presupposed 25
heterogeneity 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
the 25
soul 25
and 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
senses 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
the 25
formal 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
is 25
time 25
and 25
of 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
space 25
also 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
consider 25
that 25
both 25
kinds 25
of 25
objects 25
do 25
not 25
differ 25
internally 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
one 25
appears 25
externally 25
to 25
the 25
otherconsequently 25
that 25
what 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
phenomena 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
heterogeneous 25
this 25
difficulty 25
disappears 25
there 25
then 25
remains 25
no 25
other 25
difficulty 25
than 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
questionhow 25
a 25
community 25
of 25
substances 25
is 25
possible 25
a 25
question 25
which 25
lies 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
psychology 25
and 25
which 25
the 25
reader 25
after 25
what 25
in 25
our 25
analytic 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
of 25
primitive 25
forces 25
and 25
faculties 25
will 25
easily 25
judge 25

cosmology 25
the 25
proposition 25
i 25
think 25
or 25
i 25
exist 25
thinking 25
is 25
an 25
empirical 25
proposition 25
but 25
such 25
a 25
proposition 25
must 25
be 25
based 25
on 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
and 25
the 25
object 25
cogitated 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
thus 25
our 25
theory 25
appears 25
to 25
maintain 25
that 25
the 25
soul 25
even 25
in 25
thought 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
phenomenon 25

in 25
this 25
way 25
our 25
consciousness 25
itself 25

abuts 25
upon 25
nothing 25

merely 25
the 25
purely 25
spontaneous 25
logical 25
function 25
which 25
operates 25
to 25
connect 25
the 25
manifold 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
intuition 25
and 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
represent 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
consciousness 25
as 25

this 25
reason 25
alone 25
that 25
it 25
pays 25
no 25
attention 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
whether 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25

is 25
sensuous 25

myself 25
only 25

what 25
mode 25
my 25
self 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
intuition 25
i 25
do 25

it 25

as 25
determining 25
this 25

we 25
should 25
on 25
this 25
supposition 25
find 25
ourselves 25
possessed 25
of 25
a 25
spontaneity 25

our 25

aware 25

an 25

this 25
would 25
not 25

to 25
the 25
attempts 25

the 25
consciousness 25
of 25
the 25

in 25
me 25
reveals 25
would 25
present 25
me 25
with 25

those 25

are 25
given 25

thus 25
i 25
should 25
find 25
myself 25
in 25
the 25

i 25
should 25
find 25
myself 25
still 25
in 25
need 25
of 25
sensuous 25
intuitions 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
give 25
significance 25
to 25
my 25
conceptions 25
of 25
substance 25

cause 25
by 25

which 25
alone 25
i 25
can 25
possess 25
a 25
knowledge 25
of 25
myself 25

these 25

can 25
never 25
raise 25
me 25
above 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
i 25
should 25
be 25
justified 25
however 25
in 25
applying 25
these 25
conceptions 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
their 25
practical 25

very 25
different 25

have 25
made 25
these 25

ii 25
the 25
antinomy 25
of 25
pure 25

we 25
showed 25
in 25
the 25
introduction 25
to 25
this 25
part 25
of 25
our 25
work 25
that 25
all 25
transcendental 25
illusion 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
arose 25
from 25
dialectical 25
arguments 25
the 25
schema 25
of 25
which 25
logic 25
gives 25
us 25
in 25
its 25
three 25
formal 25
species 25
of 25
syllogismsjust 25
as 25
the 25
categories 25
find 25
their 25
logical 25
schema 25
in 25
the 25
four 25
functions 25
of 25
all 25
judgements 25
the 25
first 25
kind 25
of 25
these 25
sophistical 25
arguments 25
related 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
of 25
all 25
representations 25
in 25
general 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
or 25
soul 25
in 25
correspondence 25
with 25
the 25
categorical 25
syllogisms 25
the 25
major 25
of 25
which 25
as 25
the 25
principle 25
enounces 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
a 25
predicate 25
to 25
a 25
subject 25
the 25
second 25
kind 25
of 25
dialectical 25
argument 25
will 25
therefore 25
be 25
concerned 25
following 25
the 25
analogy 25
with 25
hypothetical 25
syllogisms 25
with 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
objective 25
conditions 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
the 25
theme 25
of 25
the 25
third 25
kind 25
to 25
be 25
treated 25
of 25
in 25
the 25
following 25
chapter 25
will 25
be 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
objective 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
objects 25
in 25
general 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
worthy 25
of 25
remark 25
that 25
the 25
transcendental 25
paralogism 25
produced 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
only 25
a 25
onethird 25
illusion 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
our 25
thought 25
and 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
gave 25
no 25
ground 25
to 25
maintain 25
the 25
contrary 25
proposition 25
the 25
advantage 25
is 25
completely 25
on 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
pneumatism 25
although 25
this 25
theory 25
itself 25
passes 25
into 25
naught 25
in 25
the 25
crucible 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
very 25
different 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
when 25
we 25
apply 25
reason 25
to 25
the 25
objective 25
synthesis 25
of 25
phenomena 25
here 25
certainly 25
reason 25
establishes 25
with 25
much 25
plausibility 25
its 25
principle 25
of 25
unconditioned 25
unity 25
but 25
it 25
very 25
soon 25
falls 25
into 25
such 25
contradictions 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
compelled 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
cosmology 25
to 25
renounce 25
its 25
pretensions 25
for 25
here 25
a 25
new 25
phenomenon 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
meets 25
usa 25
perfectly 25
natural 25
antithetic 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
require 25
to 25
be 25
sought 25
for 25
by 25
subtle 25
sophistry 25
but 25
into 25
which 25
reason 25
of 25
itself 25
unavoidably 25
falls 25
it 25
is 25
thereby 25
preserved 25
to 25
be 25
sure 25
from 25
the 25
slumber 25
of 25
a 25
fancied 25
convictionwhich 25
a 25
merely 25
onesided 25
illusion 25
produces 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
compelled 25
either 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
to 25
abandon 25
itself 25
to 25
a 25
despairing 25
scepticism 25
or 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
to 25
assume 25
a 25
dogmatical 25
confidence 25
and 25
obstinate 25
persistence 25
in 25
certain 25
assertions 25
without 25
granting 25
a 25
fair 25
hearing 25
to 25
the 25
other 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
either 25
is 25
the 25
death 25
of 25
a 25
sound 25
philosophy 25
although 25
the 25
former 25
might 25
perhaps 25
deserve 25
the 25
title 25
of 25
the 25
euthanasia 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
before 25

this 25

raise 25
it 25
above 25
the 25
empirical 25
though 25
it 25
must 25
still 25
be 25
in 25
connection 25
with 25
it 25
this 25
happens 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
for 25
a 25
given 25
conditioned 25
reason 25
demands 25
absolute 25
totality 25
on 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
conditions 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
submits 25
all 25
phenomena 25
and 25
thus 25
makes 25
of 25
the 25
category 25
a 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
this 25
it 25
does 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
give 25
absolute 25
completeness 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
by 25
continuing 25
it 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
experience 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
idea 25
reason 25
requires 25
this 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
if 25
the 25
conditioned 25
is 25
given 25
the 25
whole 25
of 25
the 25
conditions 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
absolutely 25
unconditioned 25
is 25
also 25
given 25
whereby 25
alone 25
the 25
former 25
was 25
possible 25
first 25
then 25
the 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
are 25
properly 25
nothing 25
but 25
categories 25
elevated 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
they 25
may 25
be 25
arranged 25
in 25
a 25
table 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
titles 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
secondly 25
all 25
the 25
categories 25
are 25
not 25
available 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
but 25
only 25
those 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
synthesis 25
constitutes 25
a 25

required 25
of 25

only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
concerns 25
the 25
ascending 25

of 25
the 25

of 25
a 25

when 25
the 25

quite 25

not 25

their 25

hence 25
in 25

only 25
through 25

rather 25
through 25

the 25

it 25
takes 25
place 25
therefore 25
in 25

contains 25
a 25
series 25
and 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
series 25
of 25
aggregated 25
spaces 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
feet 25
in 25
a 25
rood 25
beginning 25
with 25
a 25
given 25
portion 25
of 25
space 25
those 25
which 25
continue 25
to 25
be 25
annexed 25
form 25
the 25

of 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
the 25
formerthe 25
measurement 25
of 25
a 25
space 25
must 25
also 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
a 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
a 25
given 25
conditioned 25
it 25
differs 25
however 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
time 25
that 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
conditioned 25
is 25
not 25
in 25
itself 25
distinguishable 25
from 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
condition 25
and 25
consequently 25
regressus 25
and 25
progressus 25
in 25
space 25
seem 25
to 25
be 25
identical 25
but 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
one 25
part 25
of 25
space 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
but 25
only 25
limited 25
by 25
and 25
through 25
another 25
we 25
must 25
also 25
consider 25
every 25
limited 25
space 25
as 25
conditioned 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
presupposes 25
some 25
other 25
space 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
its 25
limitation 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
as 25
regards 25
limitation 25
therefore 25
our 25
procedure 25
in 25
space 25
is 25
also 25
a 25
regressus 25
and 25
the 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25
synthesis 25
in 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
applies 25
to 25
space 25
also 25
and 25
i 25
am 25
entitled 25
to 25
demand 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
synthesis 25
in 25
space 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
time 25
whether 25
my 25
demand 25
can 25
be 25
satisfied 25
is 25
a 25
question 25
to 25
be 25
answered 25
in 25
the 25
sequel 25
secondly 25
the 25
real 25
in 25
spacethat 25
is 25
matteris 25
conditioned 25
its 25
internal 25
conditions 25
are 25
its 25
parts 25
and 25
the 25
parts 25
of 25
parts 25
its 25
remote 25
conditions 25
so 25
that 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
we 25
find 25
a 25
regressive 25
synthesis 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
a 25
demand 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
this 25
cannot 25
be 25
obtained 25
otherwise 25
than 25
by 25
a 25
complete 25
division 25
of 25
parts 25
whereby 25
the 25
real 25
in 25
matter 25
becomes 25
either 25
nothing 25
or 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
matter 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
simple 25
consequently 25
we 25
find 25
here 25
also 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
and 25
a 25
progress 25
to 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
thirdly 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
categories 25
of 25
a 25
real 25
relation 25
between 25
phenomena 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
substance 25
and 25
its 25
accidents 25
is 25
not 25
suitable 25
for 25
the 25
formation 25
of 25
a 25

are 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
substance 25
itself 25
the 25
conception 25

nevertheless 25
seem 25
to 25
be 25
an 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
transcendental 25
reason 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
signifies 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
general 25
which 25
subsists 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
cogitate 25
in 25
it 25
merely 25
a 25
transcendental 25
subject 25
without 25
any 25
predicates 25
and 25
as 25
the 25
question 25
here 25
is 25
of 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomenait 25
is 25
clear 25
that 25
the 25
substantial 25
can 25
form 25
no 25
member 25
thereof 25
the 25
same 25
holds 25
good 25
of 25
substances 25
in 25
community 25
which 25
are 25
mere 25
aggregates 25
and 25
do 25
not 25
form 25
a 25
series 25
for 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
subordinated 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
as 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
each 25
other 25
which 25
however 25
may 25
be 25
affirmed 25
of 25
spaces 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
which 25
are 25
never 25
determined 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
always 25
by 25
some 25
other 25
space 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
causality 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
find 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
causes 25
to 25
a 25
given 25
effect 25
and 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
ascend 25
from 25
the 25
latter 25
as 25
the 25
conditioned 25
to 25
the 25
former 25

the 25

thus 25
answer 25
the 25
question 25

such 25

furnish 25
us 25
with 25
a 25

in 25
the 25

in 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
we 25
must 25
here 25
remark 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
that 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
absolute 25
totality 25
relates 25
to 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
exposition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
and 25
therefore 25
not 25
to 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
totality 25
of 25
things 25
phenomena 25
are 25
here 25
therefore 25
regarded 25
as 25
given 25
and 25
reason 25
requires 25
the 25
absolute 25
completeness 25
of 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
their 25
possibility 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
these 25
conditions 25
constitute 25
a 25
series 25
consequently 25
an 25
absolutely 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
every 25
respect 25
complete 25
synthesis 25
whereby 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
can 25
be 25
explained 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
secondly 25
it 25
is 25
properly 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
alone 25
that 25
reason 25
seeks 25
in 25
this 25
serially 25
and 25
regressively 25
conducted 25
synthesis 25
of 25
conditions 25
it 25
wishes 25
to 25
speak 25
in 25
another 25
way 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
completeness 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
premisses 25
so 25
as 25
to 25
render 25
it 25
unnecessary 25
to 25
presuppose 25
others 25
this 25
unconditioned 25
is 25
always 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
when 25
we 25
endeavour 25
to 25
form 25
a 25
representation 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
thought 25
but 25
this 25
absolutely 25
complete 25
synthesis 25
is 25
itself 25
but 25
an 25
idea 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
at 25
least 25
before 25
hand 25
to 25
know 25
whether 25
any 25
such 25
synthesis 25
is 25
possible 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
phenomena 25
when 25
we 25
represent 25
all 25

by 25
means 25

the 25

without 25
any 25
conditions 25
of 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
we 25
may 25
say 25
with 25
justice 25
that 25

a 25
given 25
conditioned 25
the 25
whole 25

also 25
given 25
for 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
only 25
given 25
through 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
we 25
find 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
phenomena 25
a 25
particular 25
limitation 25
of 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
conditions 25
are 25
given 25
that 25
is 25
through 25
the 25
successive 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
intuition 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
complete 25
in 25
the 25
regress 25
now 25
whether 25
this 25
completeness 25
is 25
sensuously 25
possible 25
is 25
a 25
problem 25
but 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25

lies 25
in 25

adequate 25
to 25
the 25

it 25

for 25
the 25

mutual 25
opposition 25

what 25
we 25
will 25
these 25
sophistical 25
assertions 25
of 25

open 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
a 25
battlefield 25
where 25
that 25
side 25
obtains 25
the 25
victory 25
which 25
has 25
been 25
permitted 25

unfortunately 25
obliged 25

champions 25

whether 25
on 25

on 25

away 25
the 25
crown 25
of 25
victory 25
if 25
they 25
only 25
take 25

the 25
right 25
to 25

the 25

not 25
obliged 25
to 25
sustain 25
another 25
onset 25
from 25
their 25
opponent 25
we 25
can 25
easily 25
believe 25
that 25
this 25
arena 25
has 25
been 25
often 25
trampled 25
by 25
the 25
feet 25
of 25
combatants 25
that 25
many 25
victories 25
have 25
been 25
obtained 25
on 25
both 25
sides 25
but 25
that 25
the 25
last 25
victory 25
decisive 25
of 25
the 25
affair 25
between 25
the 25
contending 25
parties 25
was 25
won 25
by 25
him 25
who 25
fought 25
for 25
the 25
right 25
only 25
if 25
his 25
adversary 25
was 25
forbidden 25
to 25
continue 25
the 25
tourney 25
as 25
impartial 25
umpires 25
we 25
must 25
lay 25
aside 25
entirely 25
the 25
consideration 25
whether 25
the 25
combatants 25
are 25
fighting 25
for 25
the 25
right 25
or 25
for 25
the 25
wrong 25
side 25
for 25
the 25
true 25
or 25
for 25
the 25
false 25
and 25
allow 25
the 25
combat 25
to 25
be 25
first 25
decided 25
perhaps 25
after 25
they 25
have 25
wearied 25
more 25
than 25
injured 25
each 25
other 25

of 25
finally 25
deciding 25
in 25
favour 25
of 25
either 25
side 25

to 25
discover 25
whether 25
the 25

the 25
struggle 25
is 25
not 25
a 25

criterion 25

i 25
might 25
have 25
conducted 25
my 25

the 25
conception 25
given 25
in 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
agree 25
with 25
the 25
true 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
infinite 25
whole 25

no 25

not 25
said 25
how 25

its 25

not 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
maximum 25
we 25
cogitate 25
in 25
it 25
merely 25
its 25
relation 25
to 25
an 25
arbitrarily 25
assumed 25
unit 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
greater 25
than 25
any 25
number 25
now 25
just 25
as 25
the 25
unit 25
which 25
is 25
taken 25
is 25
greater 25
or 25
smaller 25
the 25
infinite 25

be 25
greater 25

smaller 25

the 25

consists 25
merely 25
in 25
the 25
relation 25
to 25
this 25

must 25
remain 25
always 25
the 25
same 25

the 25
absolute 25

never 25

hence 25
it 25
follows 25
without 25

that 25

alleged 25
that 25

the 25

as 25

both 25
space 25

is 25
quite 25
possible 25
without 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
holding 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
absolute 25
time 25
before 25
the 25
beginning 25
of 25
the 25

an 25
absolute 25

the 25
actual 25
worldwhich 25
is 25
impossible 25
i 25
am 25
quite 25
well 25
satisfied 25
with 25
the 25
latter 25
part 25
of 25
this 25
opinion 25
of 25
the 25
philosophers 25
of 25
the 25
leibnitzian 25
school 25
space 25
is 25
merely 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
external 25
intuition 25
but 25
not 25
a 25
real 25
object 25
which 25
can 25
itself 25
be 25
externally 25
intuited 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
correlate 25

phenomena 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
phenomena 25
itself 25
space 25
therefore 25
cannot 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
absolutely 25
and 25
in 25
itself 25
something 25
determinative 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
itself 25
an 25
object 25
but 25
only 25
the 25
form 25
of 25
possible 25
objects 25
consequently 25
things 25
as 25
phenomena 25
determine 25
space 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
they 25
render 25
it 25
possible 25
that 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
possible 25
predicates 25

relation 25
certain 25
may 25
belong 25
to 25
reality 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
affirm 25
the 25
converse 25
that 25
space 25
as 25
something 25
selfsubsistent 25
can 25
determine 25
real 25
things 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
size 25
or 25
shape 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
not 25
a 25
real 25
thing 25
space 25
filled 25
or 25
void 25
may 25
therefore 25
be 25
limited 25
by 25
phenomena 25
but 25
phenomena 25
cannot 25
be 25
limited 25
by 25
an 25
empty 25

without 25

this 25
is 25
true 25
of 25
time 25
also 25
all 25
this 25
being 25
granted 25
it 25
is 25
nevertheless 25
indisputable 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
assume 25
these 25
two 25
nonentities 25
void 25
space 25
without 25

void 25

the 25
existence 25

cosmical 25
limits 25
relatively 25
to 25

footnote 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
what 25

here 25

that 25
empty 25

therefore 25

it 25
entirely 25
out 25
of 25

hence 25
we 25

necessarily 25

simple 25

i 25
understand 25
thereby 25
only 25
a 25
substantial 25
whole 25
as 25
the 25
true 25

that 25

i 25
understand 25
that 25
contingent 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25

is 25
given 25

perfectly 25
isolated 25
at 25
least 25
in 25
thought 25
placed 25
in 25
reciprocal 25
connection 25

thus 25
constituted 25
a 25

space 25
ought 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
called 25
a 25
compositum 25

a 25
totum 25

its 25

are 25
possible 25
in 25
the 25

not 25
the 25
whole 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25

it 25
might 25
perhaps 25
be 25
called 25
a 25
compositum 25
ideale 25
but 25
not 25
a 25
compositum 25
reale 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
of 25
no 25
importance 25
as 25
space 25
is 25
not 25
a 25

not 25
even 25
of 25
real 25

i 25
abstract 25
all 25

even 25
a 25

of 25
a 25

and 25
time 25
therefore 25
do 25
not 25
consist 25
of 25
simple 25
parts 25
that 25
which 25
belongs 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
condition 25

state 25
of 25
a 25

it 25
possesses 25
a 25

to 25
say 25
a 25

degree 25
of 25

does 25
not 25
originate 25
from 25
the 25
addition 25
of 25
many 25
simple 25
changes 25
our 25
inference 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
from 25
the 25
composite 25
is 25
valid 25
only 25
of 25
selfsubsisting 25
things 25
but 25
the 25
accidents 25
of 25
a 25
state 25
are 25
not 25
selfsubsistent 25
the 25
proof 25
then 25
for 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
as 25
the 25
component 25
part 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
substantial 25
and 25
composite 25
may 25
prove 25
a 25
failure 25
and 25
the 25
whole 25
case 25
of 25
this 25
thesis 25
be 25
lost 25
if 25
we 25
carry 25
the 25
proposition 25
too 25
far 25

wish 25
to 25
make 25

lay 25
themselves 25
open 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
to 25
suspicion 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
recognize 25
the 25
clearest 25
mathematical 25
proofs 25
as 25
propositions 25
relating 25
to 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25

in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25

the 25
formal 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
all 25

but 25
regard 25
them 25
merely 25
as 25
inferences 25
from 25
abstract 25
but 25
arbitrary 25
conceptions 25
which 25
cannot 25
have 25
any 25
application 25
to 25
real 25
things 25
just 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
possible 25
to 25
imagine 25
another 25
mode 25
of 25
intuition 25
than 25
that 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
primitive 25
intuition 25
of 25

just 25
as 25
if 25
its 25
a 25
priori 25
determinations 25
did 25
not 25
apply 25
to 25
everything 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25

is 25
possible 25
from 25
the 25

alone 25
of 25
its 25
filling 25

we 25
listen 25
to 25
them 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
ourselves 25
required 25
to 25
cogitate 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
the 25
mathematical 25
point 25
which 25
is 25
simplenot 25
however 25
a 25
part 25
but 25
a 25
mere 25
limit 25
of 25
space 25
physical 25
points 25
which 25
are 25
indeed 25
likewise 25
simple 25
but 25
possess 25
the 25
peculiar 25
property 25
as 25
parts 25
of 25
space 25
of 25
filling 25
it 25
merely 25
by 25
their 25
aggregation 25
i 25
shall 25
not 25
repeat 25
here 25
the 25
common 25
and 25
clear 25
refutations 25
of 25
this 25
absurdity 25
which 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
everywhere 25
in 25
numbers 25
every 25
one 25
knows 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
undermine 25
the 25
evidence 25
of 25
mathematics 25
by 25
mere 25
discursive 25
conceptions 25
i 25
shall 25
only 25
remark 25
that 25
if 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
philosophy 25
endeavours 25
to 25
gain 25
an 25
advantage 25
over 25
mathematics 25
by 25
sophistical 25
artifices 25
it 25
is 25
because 25
it 25
forgets 25
that 25
the 25
discussion 25
relates 25
solely 25
to 25
phenomena 25
and 25
their 25
conditions 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
sufficient 25
to 25
find 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
for 25
the 25
pure 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
composite 25
but 25
we 25
must 25
discover 25
for 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
composite 25
matter 25
the 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
now 25
this 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
sensibility 25
and 25
consequently 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
objects 25
of 25
sense 25
is 25
utterly 25
impossible 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
a 25
whole 25
composed 25
of 25
substances 25
which 25
is 25
cogitated 25
solely 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
necessary 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
before 25
composition 25
is 25
possible 25
but 25
this 25
does 25
not 25
hold 25
good 25
of 25
the 25
totum 25
substantiale 25
phaenomenon 25
which 25
as 25
an 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
in 25
space 25
possesses 25
the 25
necessary 25
property 25
of 25
containing 25
no 25
simple 25
part 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
no 25
part 25
of 25
space 25
is 25
simple 25
meanwhile 25
the 25
monadists 25
have 25
been 25
subtle 25
enough 25
to 25
escape 25
from 25
this 25
difficulty 25
by 25
presupposing 25
intuition 25
and 25
the 25
dynamical 25
relation 25
of 25
substances 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
space 25
instead 25
of 25
regarding 25
space 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
external 25
intuition 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
bodies 25
now 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
bodies 25
only 25
as 25
phenomena 25
and 25
as 25
such 25
they 25
necessarily 25
presuppose 25
space 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
external 25
phenomena 25
the 25
evasion 25
is 25
therefore 25
in 25
vain 25
as 25
indeed 25
we 25
have 25
sufficiently 25
shown 25
in 25
our 25
aesthetic 25
if 25
bodies 25
were 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
the 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
monadists 25
would 25
be 25
unexceptionable 25
the 25
second 25
dialectical 25
assertion 25
possesses 25
the 25
peculiarity 25
of 25
having 25
opposed 25
to 25
it 25
a 25
dogmatical 25
proposition 25
which 25
among 25
all 25
such 25
sophistical 25
statements 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
one 25
that 25
undertakes 25
to 25
prove 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25

which 25

the 25
proposition 25

that 25
the 25

considered 25
at 25
length 25
in 25
a 25
former 25
chapter 25
i 25
shall 25
merely 25
remark 25
that 25
if 25
something 25
is 25
cogitated 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
without 25
the 25
addition 25
of 25
any 25
synthetical 25
determination 25
of 25
its 25
intuitionas 25
happens 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
bare 25
representation 25
iit 25
is 25
certain 25
that 25
no 25
manifold 25
and 25
no 25
composition 25
can 25
be 25
perceived 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
representation 25
as 25
moreover 25
the 25
predicates 25
whereby 25
i 25
cogitate 25
this 25
object 25
are 25
merely 25
intuitions 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
there 25
cannot 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
them 25
anything 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
manifold 25
whose 25
parts 25
are 25
external 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
consequently 25
nothing 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
real 25
composition 25
consciousness 25
therefore 25
is 25
so 25
constituted 25
that 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
the 25
thinking 25
subject 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
its 25
own 25

cannot 25
divide 25

it 25
can 25

for 25
every 25
object 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
itself 25
is 25
absolute 25
unity 25
nevertheless 25
if 25
the 25
subject 25
is 25
regarded 25
externally 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
intuition 25
it 25
must 25
in 25
its 25
character 25
of 25
phenomenon 25
possess 25
the 25
property 25
of 25
composition 25
and 25
it 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
regarded 25
in 25
this 25
manner 25
if 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
know 25
whether 25
there 25

of 25
the 25

a 25

is 25
also 25
necessary 25
to 25
account 25
fully 25
for 25
these 25
phenomena 25
proof 25
let 25
it 25
be 25
supposed 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
no 25

than 25
that 25

of 25

consequently 25
everything 25
that 25
happens 25
presupposes 25
a 25
previous 25
condition 25
which 25
it 25
follows 25
with 25
absolute 25
certainty 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25
but 25
this 25
previous 25
condition 25
must 25
itself 25
be 25
something 25
that 25
has 25
happened 25
that 25
has 25
arisen 25
in 25
time 25
as 25
it 25
did 25
not 25
exist 25
before 25
for 25
if 25
it 25
has 25
always 25
been 25
in 25
existence 25
its 25
consequence 25
or 25
effect 25
would 25
not 25
thus 25
originate 25
for 25
the 25
first 25
time 25
but 25
would 25
likewise 25
have 25
always 25
existed 25
the 25
causality 25
therefore 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
whereby 25
something 25
happens 25
is 25
itself 25
a 25
thing 25
that 25
has 25
happened 25
now 25
this 25
again 25
presupposes 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
a 25
previous 25

its 25
causality 25
and 25
this 25
another 25
anterior 25
to 25
the 25
former 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
if 25
then 25
everything 25
happens 25
solely 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25

there 25
cannot 25
be 25
any 25
real 25

beginning 25
of 25

but 25
only 25
a 25
subaltern 25
or 25
comparative 25
beginning 25
there 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
be 25
a 25
completeness 25
of 25

the 25

of 25
the 25

from 25
the 25
other 25
but 25
the 25
law 25
of 25

that 25
nothing 25
can 25
happen 25
without 25
a 25
sufficient 25

proposition 25
thereforeif 25
all 25

with 25
the 25

stated 25
in 25
this 25
unlimited 25

general 25
manner 25
selfcontradictory 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
this 25
cannot 25

the 25
only 25
kind 25
of 25
causality 25
from 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
a 25

must 25
be 25
admitted 25
by 25

of 25

every 25

such 25
a 25

consequently 25
a 25

it 25
is 25
also 25
a 25
relinquishing 25
of 25
the 25

if 25

the 25

imposes 25

we 25

the 25

comprehending 25
how 25
the 25

through 25
the 25

for 25
this 25
information 25
look 25
entirely 25
to 25
experience 25
now 25
we 25
have 25
demonstrated 25
this 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25

a 25

it 25

alone 25

as 25
there 25
has 25
thus 25
been 25
proved 25
the 25

at 25

all 25

a 25

allow 25
ourselves 25

into 25
a 25

antiquity 25
with 25
the 25
exception 25
of 25
the 25

felt 25
themselves 25

constructing 25
a 25

of 25
the 25

accept 25

spontaneously 25

prior 25
to 25
all 25
other 25
causes 25
evolved 25
this 25
series 25
of 25
states 25
they 25
always 25
felt 25
the 25
need 25
of 25
going 25
beyond 25
mere 25
nature 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25

the 25
sophistical 25

the 25

you 25

not 25
accept 25
a 25
mathematical 25

to 25

seek 25
a 25
dynamical 25

compelled 25

to 25
imagine 25
an 25
absolutely 25

of 25
the 25

yours 25

quite 25

no 25
difficulty 25
in 25
believing 25

that 25

in 25
the 25

of 25
these 25

consequently 25
that 25

by 25
no 25

all 25

certainly 25
quite 25
incomprehensible 25

if 25
you 25
are 25
rash 25
enough 25
to 25
deny 25
the 25
enigmatical 25
secrets 25
of 25
nature 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
you 25
will 25
find 25
yourselves 25
obliged 25
to 25
deny 25
also 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
many 25
fundamental 25
properties 25
of 25
natural 25
objects 25
such 25
as 25
fundamental 25
forces 25
which 25
you 25
can 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
comprehend 25
and 25
even 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
so 25
simple 25
a 25
conception 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
change 25
must 25
present 25
to 25
you 25
insuperable 25
difficulties 25
for 25
if 25
experience 25
did 25
not 25
teach 25
you 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
real 25
you 25
never 25
could 25
conceive 25
a 25

the 25
possibility 25
of 25
this 25
ceaseless 25
sequence 25
of 25

the 25

at 25

exist 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
apart 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
certainly 25
a 25
bold 25
assumption 25
that 25
over 25
and 25
above 25
the 25
complete 25
content 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
intuitions 25
there 25
still 25
exists 25
an 25
object 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
presented 25
in 25
any 25
possible 25
perception 25
but 25
to 25
attribute 25
to 25
substances 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
itself 25
such 25
a 25
faculty 25

quite 25
inadmissible 25

in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
phenomena 25
reciprocally 25
determining 25

determined 25
according 25

general 25
laws 25
which 25
is 25
termed 25
nature 25

along 25
with 25
it 25
the 25
criteria 25
of 25
empirical 25
truth 25
which 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
distinguish 25
experience 25
from 25
mere 25
visionary 25
dreaming 25
would 25
almost 25
entirely 25
disappear 25
in 25
proximity 25
with 25

a 25
lawless 25
faculty 25

a 25

hardly 25
cogitable 25

the 25

continually 25
subject 25
to 25
the 25
intrusive 25

the 25
former 25

the 25

their 25

they 25
thus 25
admitted 25
an 25

empirical 25
conditions 25

in 25
this 25
they 25
are 25
quite 25
right 25
but 25
as 25
they 25
could 25
not 25
find 25
in 25
this 25

any 25
primal 25
beginning 25

any 25
highest 25

they 25
passed 25
suddenly 25
from 25
the 25
empirical 25
conception 25
of 25
contingency 25
to 25
the 25

therefore 25
free 25
from 25
the 25

now 25
it 25

a 25

contingent 25
to 25
prove 25
this 25
we 25
should 25
require 25
to 25
know 25
that 25
the 25

rest 25
could 25
have 25

the 25
very 25
same 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
motion 25
took 25
place 25
now 25
we 25
know 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
that 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
rest 25
was 25
actual 25
in 25
the 25
time 25
that 25
followed 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
motion 25
consequently 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
also 25
possible 25
but 25
motion 25
at 25
one 25
time 25
and 25
rest 25
at 25
another 25
time 25
are 25
not 25
contradictorily 25
opposed 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
it 25
follows 25
from 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
that 25
the 25
succession 25
of 25
opposite 25
determinations 25
that 25
is 25

does 25
not 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
fact 25

contingency 25
as 25
represented 25
in 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25

that 25
it 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
conduct 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
fact 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25

proves 25
merely 25
empirical 25
contingency 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
new 25

could 25
not 25
have 25
existed 25
without 25
a 25

the 25

the 25

of 25

will 25
observe 25
in 25
this 25
antinomy 25
a 25
very 25
remarkable 25
contrast 25
the 25
very 25
same 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
which 25
established 25
in 25
the 25
thesis 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25

demonstrated 25
in 25

with 25
equal 25
strictnessthe 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
we 25
found 25
first 25
that 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
exists 25
because 25
the 25
whole 25
time 25
past 25
contains 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
all 25
conditions 25
and 25
with 25
it 25
therefore 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
the 25
necessary 25
secondly 25
that 25
there 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
any 25
necessary 25
being 25
for 25
the 25
same 25
reason 25
that 25
the 25

contains 25
the 25

therefore 25
in 25
the 25
aggregate 25
conditioned 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
this 25
seeming 25
incongruity 25
is 25
as 25
follows 25
we 25
attend 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
argument 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25

the 25
one 25
of 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
other 25
in 25
time 25
and 25
thus 25
arrive 25
at 25
a 25
necessary 25
unconditioned 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
we 25
consider 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25

in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
time 25
for 25
every 25
event 25
is 25
preceded 25
by 25
a 25
time 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
condition 25
itself 25
must 25
be 25
determined 25
as 25
conditionedand 25
thus 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25
unconditioned 25
or 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
disappears 25
in 25
both 25

often 25

the 25

we 25

out 25

altogether 25
the 25

both 25
sides 25

my 25

in 25
so 25
far 25
not 25
simple 25
i 25
shall 25
term 25
the 25
thesis 25
in 25
view 25
of 25
its 25
essential 25

the 25

therefore 25
in 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25

ideas 25
we 25
find 25
a 25
practical 25

must 25
be 25
very 25
dear 25
to 25
every 25
rightthinking 25
man 25
that 25
the 25

the 25

at 25

seems 25
so 25

itself 25
on 25
this 25
side 25

if 25
we 25
take 25
the 25

them 25
in 25
the 25
manner 25

the 25

exhibit 25
completely 25
a 25

for 25
this 25

pure 25

hence 25
the 25

in 25

in 25

it 25
seems 25
very 25
extraordinary 25
that 25
empiricism 25
should 25
be 25
utterly 25
unpopular 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
inclined 25
to 25

understanding 25
would 25

it 25
with 25
pleasurepromising 25
as 25
it 25
does 25
to 25
satisfy 25
it 25
without 25
passing 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
its 25
connected 25
order 25
while 25
transcendental 25
dogmatism 25
obliges 25
it 25
to 25
rise 25
to 25
conceptions 25
which 25
far 25
surpass 25
the 25
intelligence 25
and 25
ability 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
practised 25
thinkers 25
but 25
in 25
this 25
in 25
truth 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
its 25
real 25
motive 25
for 25
the 25
common 25
understanding 25
thus 25
finds 25
itself 25
in 25
a 25
situation 25
where 25
not 25
even 25
the 25
most 25
learned 25
can 25
have 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
it 25
if 25
it 25
understands 25
little 25
or 25
nothing 25
about 25
these 25
transcendental 25
conceptions 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
boast 25
of 25
understanding 25
any 25
more 25
and 25
although 25
it 25
may 25
not 25
express 25
itself 25
in 25
so 25
scholastically 25
correct 25
a 25
manner 25
as 25
others 25
it 25
can 25
busy 25
itself 25
with 25
reasoning 25
and 25
arguments 25
without 25
end 25
wandering 25
among 25
mere 25
ideas 25
about 25
which 25
one 25
can 25
always 25
be 25
very 25
eloquent 25
because 25
we 25
know 25
nothing 25
about 25
them 25
while 25
in 25
the 25
observation 25
and 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
forced 25
to 25
remain 25
dumb 25
and 25
to 25
confess 25
its 25
utter 25
ignorance 25
thus 25
indolence 25
and 25
vanity 25
form 25
of 25
themselves 25
strong 25
recommendations 25
of 25
these 25
principles 25
besides 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
hard 25
thing 25
for 25
a 25
philosopher 25
to 25
assume 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
which 25
he 25
can 25
give 25
to 25
himself 25
no 25
reasonable 25
account 25
and 25
still 25
more 25

nothing 25

last 25
all 25
speculative 25

disappear 25
before 25
the 25
practical 25

it 25

thus 25
the 25
empiricism 25
of 25
transcendentally 25
idealizing 25

only 25
such 25

at 25

do 25
not 25
incapacitate 25
a 25

we 25

the 25

of 25
a 25

questions 25
continue 25

what 25
we 25
know 25

question 25
relating 25

is 25
unanswerable 25
by 25
this 25
reason 25

whether 25
we 25
must 25
regard 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
as 25
quite 25
uncertain 25
so 25

the 25
peculiarity 25
of 25

what 25
is 25
the 25

unanswerablewe 25

we 25
can 25
perceive 25
that 25
the 25

it 25
at 25

the 25

the 25

in 25

in 25

consequently 25
a 25
satisfactory 25
explanation 25

expected 25
the 25
questions 25
of 25

relate 25

not 25

be 25
regarded 25
as 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
kind 25
as 25
those 25
mentioned 25
above 25
for 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
at 25
present 25
treating 25
of 25
the 25
certainty 25
of 25
judgements 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25

only 25
of 25
that 25
certainty 25
in 25

we 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
escape 25
the 25
responsibility 25
of 25
at 25
least 25
a 25
critical 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
questions 25
of 25
reason 25
by 25
complaints 25
of 25
the 25
limited 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
faculties 25

the 25
seemingly 25
humble 25
confession 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
beyond 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25

whether 25
the 25
world 25

anything 25

finally 25
whether 25
there 25

a 25
being 25
that 25
is 25
completely 25
unconditioned 25

whether 25

its 25

questions 25

totality 25

the 25
conceptions 25
in 25
our 25
minds 25

not 25
assist 25
us 25
to 25
some 25
certain 25
result 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
these 25
problems 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
defend 25
ourselves 25
on 25
the 25
plea 25
that 25
the 25
object 25
itself 25
remains 25
hidden 25
from 25
and 25
unknown 25
to 25
us 25
for 25
no 25
such 25
thing 25
or 25
object 25
can 25
be 25
givenit 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
idea 25
in 25
our 25
minds 25
we 25
must 25
seek 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
our 25
failure 25
in 25
our 25
idea 25
itself 25
which 25
is 25
an 25
insoluble 25
problem 25
and 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
obstinately 25
assume 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
a 25
real 25
object 25
corresponding 25
and 25
adequate 25
to 25
it 25
a 25
clear 25
explanation 25
of 25
the 25
dialectic 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
our 25
conception 25
will 25
very 25
soon 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
come 25
to 25
a 25
satisfactory 25
decision 25

arrive 25
at 25
certainty 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
these 25
problems 25
may 25
be 25
met 25
with 25
this 25
question 25
which 25
requires 25
at 25
least 25
a 25
plain 25
answer 25
from 25
what 25
source 25
do 25
the 25
ideas 25
originate 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
which 25
involves 25
you 25
in 25
such 25
difficulties 25
are 25
you 25
seeking 25
for 25
an 25
explanation 25
of 25
certain 25
phenomena 25
and 25
do 25
you 25
expect 25
these 25
ideas 25
to 25
give 25
you 25
the 25
principles 25
or 25
the 25
rules 25
of 25
this 25
explanation 25
let 25
it 25
be 25
granted 25
that 25
all 25
nature 25
was 25
laid 25
open 25
before 25
you 25
that 25
nothing 25
was 25
hid 25
from 25
your 25

your 25

possible 25
by 25

cannot 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25

we 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
take 25
care 25
that 25
our 25
thoughts 25
are 25
consistent 25
with 25

relates 25
to 25
an 25
idea 25
the 25
falsity 25

be 25
more 25

in 25
the 25
mere 25

easily 25
rid 25
ourselves 25
of 25
the 25
confusions 25

and 25
establish 25
in 25
its 25

a 25
temperate 25
criticism 25
which 25
as 25
a 25
genuine 25
cathartic 25
will 25
successfully 25
remove 25
the 25

a 25
possible 25
conception 25

be 25
completely 25
void 25
and 25
without 25
significance 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
its 25
object 25
is 25
inadequate 25
consider 25
it 25
as 25
we 25
may 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
actually 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
all 25
cosmological 25
conceptions 25
which 25
for 25
the 25
reason 25
above 25
mentioned 25
involve 25
reason 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
it 25
remains 25
attached 25
to 25
them 25
in 25
an 25
unavoidable 25
antinomy 25
for 25
suppose 25
first 25
that 25
the 25
world 25
has 25
no 25
beginningin 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
too 25
large 25
for 25
our 25
conception 25
for 25
this 25
conception 25
which 25
consists 25
in 25
a 25
successive 25
regress 25
cannot 25
overtake 25
the 25
whole 25
eternity 25
that 25
has 25
elapsed 25
grant 25
that 25
it 25
has 25
a 25
beginning 25
it 25
is 25
then 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
for 25
as 25
a 25
beginning 25
presupposes 25
a 25
time 25
preceding 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
imposes 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
looking 25
for 25
a 25
higher 25
condition 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
therefore 25
evidently 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
this 25
law 25
the 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
double 25
answer 25
to 25
the 25
question 25
regarding 25
the 25
extent 25
in 25
space 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
for 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
infinite 25
and 25
unlimited 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
too 25
large 25
for 25
every 25
possible 25
empirical 25
conception 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
finite 25
and 25
limited 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
right 25
to 25
ask 25
what 25
determines 25
these 25
limits 25
void 25
space 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
selfsubsistent 25
correlate 25
of 25
things 25
and 25
cannot 25
be 25
a 25
final 25
conditionand 25
still 25
less 25
an 25
empirical 25
condition 25
forming 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
experience 25
for 25
how 25
can 25
we 25
have 25
any 25
experience 25
or 25
perception 25
of 25
an 25
absolute 25
void 25
but 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
requires 25
that 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
be 25
an 25
empirical 25
conception 25
consequently 25
a 25
finite 25
world 25
is 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
our 25
conception 25
secondly 25
if 25
every 25
phenomenon 25
matter 25
in 25
space 25
consists 25
of 25
an 25
infinite 25
number 25
of 25
parts 25
the 25
regress 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
is 25
always 25
too 25
great 25
for 25
our 25
conception 25
and 25
if 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
space 25
must 25
cease 25
with 25
some 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
the 25
simple 25
it 25
is 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
for 25
the 25
member 25
at 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
discontinued 25
our 25
division 25
still 25
admits 25
a 25
regress 25
to 25
many 25
more 25
parts 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
thirdly 25
suppose 25
that 25
every 25
event 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
happens 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
must 25
itself 25
be 25
an 25
event 25
and 25
necessitates 25
a 25
regress 25
to 25
a 25
still 25
higher 25
cause 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
unceasing 25
prolongation 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
a 25
parte 25
priori 25
operative 25
nature 25
is 25
therefore 25
too 25
large 25
for 25
every 25
conception 25
we 25
can 25
form 25
in 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
cosmical 25
events 25
if 25
we 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
spontaneously 25
produced 25
events 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
free 25
agency 25
we 25
are 25
driven 25
in 25
our 25
search 25
for 25
sufficient 25
reasons 25
on 25
an 25
unavoidable 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
are 25
compelled 25
to 25
appeal 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
and 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
any 25
such 25
totality 25
of 25
connection 25
in 25
our 25
synthesis 25
is 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
our 25
necessary 25
empirical 25
conception 25
fourthly 25
if 25
we 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
beingwhether 25
it 25
be 25
the 25
world 25
or 25
something 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
or 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
worldwe 25
must 25
place 25
it 25
in 25
a 25
time 25
at 25
an 25
infinite 25
distance 25
from 25
any 25
given 25
moment 25
for 25
otherwise 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
dependent 25
on 25
some 25
other 25
and 25
higher 25
existence 25
such 25
an 25
existence 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
too 25
large 25
for 25
our 25
empirical 25
conception 25
and 25
unattainable 25
by 25
the 25
continued 25
regress 25
of 25
any 25
synthesis 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
believe 25
that 25
everything 25
in 25
the 25
worldbe 25
it 25
condition 25
or 25
conditionedis 25
contingent 25
every 25
given 25
existence 25
is 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
our 25
conception 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
we 25
are 25
compelled 25
to 25
seek 25
for 25
some 25
other 25
existence 25
upon 25
which 25
the 25
former 25
depends 25
we 25
have 25
said 25
that 25
in 25
all 25
these 25
cases 25
the 25
cosmological 25
idea 25
is 25
either 25
too 25
great 25
or 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
in 25
a 25
synthesis 25
and 25
consequently 25
for 25
every 25
possible 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
why 25
did 25
we 25
not 25
express 25
ourselves 25
in 25
a 25
manner 25
exactly 25
the 25
reverse 25
of 25
this 25
and 25
instead 25
of 25
accusing 25
the 25
cosmological 25
idea 25
of 25
over 25
stepping 25

short 25
of 25
its 25

possible 25
experience 25
say 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
case 25
the 25
empirical 25
conception 25
is 25
always 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
the 25
idea 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
too 25
great 25
and 25
thus 25
attach 25
the 25
blame 25
of 25
these 25
contradictions 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
the 25
reason 25
is 25
this 25
possible 25
experience 25
can 25
alone 25
give 25
reality 25
to 25
our 25
conceptions 25
without 25
it 25
a 25
conception 25

an 25
idea 25
without 25
truth 25
or 25
relation 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
hence 25
a 25
possible 25
empirical 25
conception 25
must 25
be 25
the 25
standard 25
by 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
judge 25
whether 25
an 25
idea 25
is 25
anything 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
idea 25
and 25
fiction 25
of 25
thought 25
or 25
whether 25
it 25
relates 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
if 25
we 25
say 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
that 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
some 25
other 25
thing 25
it 25
is 25
too 25
large 25
or 25
too 25
small 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
considered 25
as 25
existing 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
and 25
requiring 25
to 25
be 25
adapted 25
to 25
it 25
among 25
the 25
trivial 25
subjects 25
of 25
discussion 25
in 25
the 25
old 25
schools 25
of 25
dialectics 25
was 25
this 25
question 25
if 25
a 25
ball 25
cannot 25
pass 25
through 25
a 25
hole 25
shall 25
we 25
say 25
that 25
the 25
ball 25
is 25
too 25
large 25
or 25
the 25
hole 25
too 25
small 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
indifferent 25
what 25
expression 25
we 25
employ 25
for 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
which 25
exists 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
cannot 25
say 25
the 25
man 25
is 25
too 25
long 25
for 25
his 25
coat 25
but 25
the 25
coat 25
is 25
too 25
short 25
for 25
the 25
man 25
we 25
are 25
thus 25
led 25
to 25
the 25
wellfounded 25
suspicion 25
that 25
the 25
cosmological 25
ideas 25
and 25
all 25
the 25
conflicting 25
sophistical 25
assertions 25
connected 25
with 25
them 25
are 25
based 25
upon 25
a 25
false 25
and 25
fictitious 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
these 25
ideas 25
is 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
and 25
this 25
suspicion 25
will 25
probably 25
direct 25
us 25
how 25
to 25
expose 25
the 25
illusion 25
that 25

only 25
in 25

a 25

thus 25
when 25
i 25
say 25
that 25
certain 25
events 25
occurred 25
in 25
past 25
time 25
i 25
merely 25
assert 25
the 25
possibility 25

prolonging 25
the 25
chain 25
of 25

from 25
the 25

determine 25
it 25
according 25
to 25

if 25
i 25
represent 25
to 25
myself 25
all 25
objects 25
existing 25
in 25
all 25
space 25

i 25
do 25
not 25
thereby 25
place 25
these 25
in 25

time 25
prior 25
to 25
all 25
experience 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
such 25
a 25
representation 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
experience 25
in 25
its 25
absolute 25
completeness 25
in 25

alone 25
are 25
those 25
objects 25
which 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
representations 25
given 25
but 25
when 25
i 25
say 25
they 25
existed 25
prior 25
to 25
my 25
experience 25
this 25
means 25
only 25
that 25
i 25
must 25
begin 25
with 25
the 25
perception 25
present 25
to 25
me 25
and 25
follow 25
the 25
track 25
indicated 25
until 25
i 25
discover 25
them 25
in 25
some 25
part 25
or 25
region 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
condition 25
of 25
this 25
progressionand 25
consequently 25
at 25
what 25
member 25
therein 25
i 25
must 25
stop 25
and 25
at 25
what 25
point 25
in 25
the 25

i 25
am 25
to 25
find 25
this 25

transcendental 25

hence 25
necessarily 25
incognizable 25

with 25
this 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
to 25
do 25
our 25

only 25

the 25

a 25
matter 25

indifference 25
whether 25
i 25

i 25
may 25
in 25
the 25

no 25
one 25
has 25

ever 25
will 25
discover 25
them 25
for 25

they 25

any 25
relation 25

they 25

for 25
me 25
nonexistent 25
consequently 25
are 25
not 25

not 25
contained 25

expose 25
the 25

infer 25

it 25
now 25
in 25
speaking 25

it 25
does 25
not 25
follow 25
that 25

the 25

such 25
a 25

established 25
only 25
by 25
an 25
actual 25
regress 25
in 25
the 25

we 25
are 25
entitled 25
to 25
say 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
that 25
a 25
regress 25
to 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
a 25

in 25
other 25
words 25
that 25
a 25
continuous 25
empirical 25

enjoined 25
that 25
if 25
the 25
conditions 25

not 25
given 25
they 25
are 25
at 25

required 25

that 25
we 25
are 25
certain 25
to 25
discover 25
the 25
conditions 25
in 25
this 25
regress 25
we 25
can 25
now 25
see 25
that 25
the 25
major 25
in 25
the 25
above 25
cosmological 25
syllogism 25
takes 25
the 25
conditioned 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
signification 25
which 25
it 25
has 25
in 25
the 25
pure 25
category 25
while 25
the 25
minor 25
speaks 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
the 25
empirical 25
signification 25
which 25
it 25
has 25
in 25
the 25
category 25
as 25
applied 25
to 25
phenomena 25
there 25
is 25
therefore 25
a 25
dialectical 25
fallacy 25
in 25
the 25
syllogisma 25
sophisma 25
figurae 25

but 25
this 25
fallacy 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
consciously 25
devised 25
one 25
but 25
a 25
perfectly 25
natural 25
illusion 25
of 25
the 25
common 25
reason 25
of 25

for 25
when 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
given 25

we 25
presuppose 25
in 25
the 25
major 25
its 25

their 25

this 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
logical 25
requirement 25
of 25
complete 25
and 25
satisfactory 25

a 25

altogether 25
left 25
out 25
in 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
the 25
conditioned 25
with 25
the 25
condition 25
they 25
are 25
supposed 25
to 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
contemporaneously 25
it 25
is 25
moreover 25
just 25
as 25
natural 25
to 25
regard 25
phenomena 25

the 25

presented 25
to 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
major 25
in 25
which 25
complete 25
abstraction 25
was 25
made 25
of 25
all 25

of 25

it 25
is 25
under 25
these 25
conditions 25
alone 25
that 25
objects 25
are 25
given 25
now 25
we 25
overlooked 25
a 25
remarkable 25
distinction 25
between 25
the 25
conceptions 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25

not 25

do 25
not 25
contain 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25

that 25

presuppose 25

exist 25
except 25
it 25
be 25
actually 25
carried 25
into 25
execution 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
after 25
this 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
viciousness 25
of 25
the 25
argument 25
commonly 25
employed 25
in 25
maintaining 25
cosmological 25
assertions 25
both 25
parties 25
may 25
now 25
be 25
justly 25
dismissed 25
as 25
advancing 25
claims 25
without 25
grounds 25
or 25
title 25
but 25
the 25
process 25
has 25
not 25
been 25
ended 25
by 25
convincing 25
them 25
that 25
one 25
or 25
both 25
were 25
in 25
the 25
wrong 25
and 25
had 25
maintained 25
an 25
assertion 25
which 25
was 25
without 25
valid 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
nothing 25
seems 25
to 25
be 25
clearer 25
than 25
that 25
if 25
one 25
maintains 25
the 25
world 25
has 25
a 25
beginning 25
and 25
another 25
the 25
world 25
has 25
no 25
beginning 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
must 25
be 25
right 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
likewise 25
clear 25
that 25
if 25
the 25
evidence 25
on 25
both 25
sides 25
is 25
equal 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
discover 25
on 25
what 25
side 25
the 25
truth 25
lies 25
and 25
the 25
controversy 25
continues 25
although 25
the 25
parties 25
have 25
been 25
recommended 25
to 25
peace 25
before 25
the 25
tribunal 25

there 25
remains 25
then 25
no 25
other 25
means 25
of 25
settling 25
the 25
question 25
than 25
to 25
convince 25
the 25
parties 25
who 25
refute 25
each 25
other 25
with 25
such 25
conclusiveness 25
and 25
ability 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
disputing 25
about 25
nothing 25
and 25
that 25
a 25
transcendental 25
illusion 25
has 25
been 25
mocking 25
them 25
with 25
visions 25
of 25
reality 25
where 25
there 25
is 25
none 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25

a 25

which 25
cannot 25
be 25
decided 25
upon 25
its 25
own 25
merits 25
we 25
shall 25
now 25
proceed 25
to 25
lay 25
before 25
our 25
readers 25
zeno 25
of 25
elea 25
a 25
subtle 25
dialectician 25
was 25
severely 25
reprimanded 25
by 25
plato 25
as 25
a 25
sophist 25
who 25
merely 25
from 25
the 25
base 25
motive 25
of 25
exhibiting 25
his 25
skill 25
in 25
discussion 25
maintained 25
and 25
subverted 25
the 25
same 25
proposition 25
by 25
arguments 25
as 25
powerful 25
and 25
convincing 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
side 25
as 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
he 25
maintained 25
for 25
example 25
that 25
god 25
who 25
was 25
probably 25
nothing 25
more 25
in 25
his 25
view 25
than 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
neither 25
finite 25
nor 25
infinite 25
neither 25
in 25
motion 25
nor 25
in 25
rest 25
neither 25
similar 25
nor 25
dissimilar 25
to 25
any 25
other 25
thing 25
it 25
seemed 25
to 25
those 25
philosophers 25
who 25
criticized 25
his 25
mode 25
of 25
discussion 25
that 25
his 25
purpose 25
was 25
to 25
deny 25
completely 25
both 25
of 25
two 25
selfcontradictory 25
propositionswhich 25
is 25
absurd 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
believe 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
any 25
justice 25
in 25
this 25
accusation 25
the 25
first 25
of 25
these 25
propositions 25
i 25
shall 25
presently 25
consider 25
in 25
a 25
more 25
detailed 25
manner 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
others 25
if 25
by 25
the 25
word 25
of 25
god 25
he 25
understood 25
merely 25
the 25
universe 25
his 25
meaning 25
must 25
have 25
beenthat 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
permanently 25
present 25
in 25
one 25
placethat 25

at 25
restnor 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
changing 25
its 25
placethat 25
is 25
of 25
moving 25
because 25
all 25
places 25
are 25
in 25
the 25
universe 25
and 25
the 25
universe 25
itself 25
is 25
therefore 25
in 25
no 25
place 25
again 25

the 25
universe 25
contains 25
in 25
itself 25
everything 25
that 25
exists 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
similar 25
or 25
dissimilar 25
to 25
any 25
other 25
thing 25
because 25
there 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
no 25
other 25
thing 25
with 25
which 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
compared 25
if 25
two 25
opposite 25

their 25

is 25
however 25
not 25
properly 25
or 25
really 25
a 25
contradictionfall 25
away 25
because 25
the 25
condition 25
which 25
ensured 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
both 25

itself 25
disappeared 25
if 25
we 25
say 25
everybody 25
has 25
either 25
a 25
good 25

a 25

thus 25
both 25
conflicting 25
statements 25

be 25
false 25

we 25

is 25
consequently 25
not 25
the 25
contradictory 25
opposite 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
if 25
accordingly 25
we 25
say 25

thus 25
i 25
should 25
deny 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
infinite 25
without 25
however 25
affirming 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
finite 25
world 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
construct 25
our 25
proposition 25
thus 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
either 25
infinite 25
or 25
finite 25
noninfinite 25
both 25
statements 25
may 25
be 25
false 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
we 25
consider 25
the 25
world 25
as 25
per 25
se 25
determined 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
quantity 25
and 25
while 25
in 25
the 25
one 25
judgement 25
we 25
deny 25
its 25
infinite 25
and 25
consequently 25
perhaps 25
its 25
independent 25
existence 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
we 25
append 25
to 25
the 25
world 25

as 25

certain 25
determinationthat 25
of 25
finitude 25
and 25
the 25
latter 25
may 25
be 25
false 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
the 25
former 25
if 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
as 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
and 25
thus 25
neither 25
as 25
finite 25
nor 25
as 25
infinite 25
in 25
quantity 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
opposition 25
i 25
may 25
be 25
allowed 25
to 25
term 25
dialectical 25
that 25
of 25
contradictories 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
analytical 25
opposition 25
thus 25
then 25
of 25
two 25
dialectically 25
opposed 25
judgements 25
both 25
may 25
be 25
false 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
one 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
mere 25
contradictory 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
but 25
actually 25
enounces 25
more 25
than 25

requisite 25
for 25
a 25
full 25

complete 25
contradiction 25

we 25

not 25
a 25

this 25

of 25

importance 25
it 25
enables 25
us 25
to 25

that 25
the 25

the 25
opposition 25

it 25
evident 25
that 25
a 25
fallacy 25
lay 25
in 25
the 25
initial 25
supposition 25

thus 25

series 25

conditions 25

which 25
we 25

we 25

clearly 25
our 25
notion 25

a 25

are 25
two 25
terms 25
commonly 25
employed 25
for 25
this 25

these 25
terms 25
are 25
regarded 25
as 25
expressions 25
of 25
different 25

distinguishable 25
notions 25

the 25
term 25
employed 25
by 25
the 25
mathematicians 25
is 25
progressus 25
in 25
infinitum 25
the 25
philosophers 25
prefer 25
the 25
expression 25
progressus 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
without 25
detaining 25
the 25
reader 25
with 25
an 25
examination 25
of 25
the 25
reasons 25
for 25

remarks 25
on 25
the 25
right 25
or 25
wrong 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
terms 25
i 25
shall 25
endeavour 25
clearly 25
to 25
determine 25
these 25
conceptions 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
is 25
necessary 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
in 25
this 25
critique 25
we 25
may 25
with 25
propriety 25
say 25
of 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
produced 25
to 25
infinity 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
distinction 25
between 25
a 25
progressus 25
in 25
infinitum 25
and 25
a 25
progressus 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
piece 25
of 25
subtlety 25
for 25
although 25
when 25
we 25
say 25
produce 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
it 25
is 25
more 25
correct 25
to 25
say 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
than 25
in 25
infinitum 25
because 25
the 25
former 25
means 25
produce 25
it 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
you 25
please 25
the 25
second 25
you 25
must 25
not 25
cease 25
to 25
produce 25
it 25
the 25
expression 25
in 25
infinitum 25
is 25
when 25
we 25
are 25
speaking 25
of 25
the 25
power 25
to 25
do 25
it 25
perfectly 25
correct 25
for 25
we 25
can 25
always 25
make 25
it 25
longer 25
if 25
we 25
pleaseon 25
to 25
infinity 25
and 25
this 25
remark 25
holds 25
good 25
in 25
all 25
cases 25
when 25
we 25
speak 25
of 25
a 25
progressus 25
that 25
is 25
an 25
advancement 25
from 25
the 25
condition 25
to 25
the 25
conditioned 25
this 25
possible 25
advancement 25
always 25
proceeds 25
to 25
infinity 25
we 25
may 25
proceed 25
from 25
a 25
given 25
pair 25
in 25
the 25
descending 25
line 25
of 25
generation 25
from 25
father 25
to 25
son 25
and 25
cogitate 25
a 25
neverending 25
line 25
of 25
descendants 25
from 25
it 25
for 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
reason 25
does 25
not 25
demand 25
absolute 25
totality 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
because 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
presuppose 25
it 25
as 25
a 25
condition 25
and 25
as 25
given 25
datum 25
but 25
merely 25
as 25
conditioned 25
and 25
as 25
capable 25
of 25
being 25
given 25
dabile 25
very 25
different 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
problem 25
how 25
far 25
the 25
regress 25
which 25
ascends 25
from 25
the 25
given 25
conditioned 25
to 25
the 25
conditions 25
must 25
extend 25
whether 25
i 25
can 25
say 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
regress 25
in 25
infinitum 25
or 25
only 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
and 25
whether 25
for 25
example 25
setting 25
out 25
from 25
the 25
human 25
beings 25
at 25
present 25
alive 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
i 25
may 25
ascend 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
their 25
ancestors 25
in 25
infinitummr 25
whether 25
all 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
said 25
is 25
that 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
i 25
have 25
proceeded 25
i 25
have 25
discovered 25
no 25
empirical 25
ground 25
for 25
considering 25
the 25
series 25
limited 25
so 25
that 25
i 25
am 25
justified 25
and 25
indeed 25
compelled 25
to 25
search 25
for 25
ancestors 25
still 25
further 25
back 25
although 25
i 25
am 25
not 25
obliged 25
by 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
presuppose 25
them 25
my 25
answer 25
to 25
this 25
question 25
is 25
if 25
the 25
series 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
as 25
a 25
whole 25
the 25
regress 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
its 25
internal 25
conditions 25
proceeds 25
in 25
infinitum 25
but 25
if 25
only 25
one 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
is 25
given 25
from 25
which 25
the 25
regress 25
is 25
to 25
proceed 25
to 25
absolute 25
totality 25
the 25
regress 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
a 25
portion 25
of 25
matter 25
given 25
within 25
certain 25
limitsof 25
a 25
body 25
that 25
isproceeds 25
in 25
infinitum 25
for 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
this 25
whole 25
is 25
its 25
part 25
and 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
part 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
part 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
and 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
regress 25
of 25
decomposition 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
indivisible 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
there 25
are 25
no 25
reasons 25
or 25
grounds 25
in 25
experience 25
for 25
stopping 25
in 25
the 25
division 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
more 25
remote 25
members 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
are 25
actually 25
and 25
empirically 25
given 25
prior 25
to 25
this 25
division 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
division 25
proceeds 25
to 25
infinity 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
ancestors 25
of 25
any 25
given 25
human 25
being 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
in 25
its 25
absolute 25
totality 25
in 25
any 25
experience 25
and 25
yet 25
the 25
regress 25
proceeds 25
from 25
every 25
genealogical 25
member 25
of 25
this 25
series 25
to 25
one 25
still 25
higher 25
and 25
does 25
not 25
meet 25
with 25
any 25
empirical 25
limit 25
presenting 25
an 25
absolutely 25
unconditioned 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
but 25
as 25
the 25
members 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
series 25
are 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
prior 25
to 25
the 25
regress 25
this 25
regress 25
does 25
not 25
proceed 25
to 25
infinity 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
that 25
is 25
we 25
are 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
discover 25
other 25
and 25
higher 25
members 25
which 25
are 25
themselves 25
always 25
conditioned 25
in 25
neither 25
casethe 25
regressus 25
in 25
infinitum 25
nor 25
the 25
regressus 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
is 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
to 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
actually 25
infinite 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
itself 25
this 25
might 25
be 25
true 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
but 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
asserted 25
of 25
phenomena 25
which 25
as 25
conditions 25
of 25
each 25
other 25
are 25
only 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
itself 25
hence 25
the 25
question 25
no 25
longer 25
is 25
what 25
is 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
this 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
in 25
itselfis 25
it 25
finite 25
or 25
infinite 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
nothing 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
how 25
is 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
to 25
be 25
commenced 25
and 25
how 25
far 25
ought 25
we 25
to 25
proceed 25
with 25
it 25
and 25
here 25
a 25
signal 25
distinction 25
in 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
this 25
rule 25
becomes 25
apparent 25
if 25
the 25
whole 25
is 25
given 25
empirically 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
recede 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
its 25
internal 25
conditions 25
to 25
infinity 25
but 25
if 25
the 25
whole 25
is 25
not 25
given 25
and 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
given 25
by 25
and 25
through 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
i 25
can 25
only 25
say 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
infinity 25
to 25
proceed 25
to 25
still 25
higher 25
conditions 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
case 25
i 25
am 25
justified 25
in 25
asserting 25
that 25
more 25
members 25
are 25
empirically 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
object 25
than 25
i 25
attain 25
to 25
in 25
the 25
regress 25
of 25
decomposition 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
case 25
i 25
am 25
justified 25
only 25
in 25
saying 25
that 25
i 25
can 25
always 25
proceed 25
further 25
in 25
the 25
regress 25
because 25
no 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
is 25
given 25
as 25
absolutely 25
conditioned 25
and 25
thus 25
a 25
higher 25
member 25
is 25
possible 25
and 25
an 25
inquiry 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
in 25
the 25
one 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
find 25
other 25
members 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
inquire 25
for 25
others 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
experience 25
presents 25
no 25
absolute 25
limitation 25
of 25
the 25
regress 25
for 25
either 25
you 25
do 25
not 25
possess 25
a 25
perception 25
which 25
absolutely 25
limits 25
your 25
empirical 25
regress 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
regress 25
cannot 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
complete 25
or 25
you 25
do 25
possess 25
such 25
a 25
limitative 25
perception 25
in 25
which 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
your 25
series 25
for 25
that 25
which 25
limits 25
must 25
be 25
distinct 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
limited 25
by 25
it 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
incumbent 25
you 25
to 25
continue 25
your 25
regress 25
up 25
to 25
this 25
condition 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
these 25
remarks 25
will 25
be 25
placed 25
in 25
their 25
proper 25
light 25
by 25
their 25
application 25
in 25
the 25
following 25
section 25

ix 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
cosmological 25
ideas 25
we 25
have 25
shown 25
that 25
no 25
transcendental 25
use 25
can 25
be 25
made 25
either 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25

of 25

arises 25
from 25
a 25
transcendental 25
employment 25

reason 25
resting 25
on 25
the 25
opinion 25

follows 25
that 25
we 25

not 25
required 25

answer 25
the 25
question 25
respecting 25

the 25

we 25

the 25

in 25
the 25
opposite 25

itself 25
rests 25
upon 25
the 25
consideration 25
that 25
such 25

must 25
represent 25
to 25
us 25

as 25
limited 25

nothing 25

i 25

of 25
the 25

on 25
the 25

i 25

first 25

the 25

of 25
this 25

i 25
know 25
nothing 25
more 25

that 25

one 25
still 25
higher 25
but 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25

is 25
not 25
thereby 25
determined 25

we 25
cannot 25
affirm 25
that 25
this 25
regress 25
proceeds 25
in 25
infinitum 25
such 25
an 25
affirmation 25
would 25
anticipate 25
the 25

the 25

beyond 25
the 25
grasp 25
of 25
any 25
empirical 25
synthesis 25
it 25
would 25
consequently 25
determine 25
the 25
cosmical 25
quantity 25
prior 25

the 25
regress 25
although 25
only 25
in 25
a 25
negative 25
mannerwhich 25
is 25

be 25
given 25

the 25

it 25
follows 25
that 25

any 25
declaration 25
respecting 25

even 25
that 25
the 25

in 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
regress 25
in 25
infinitum 25
we 25
must 25
only 25
endeavour 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
the 25

in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
rule 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
in 25
it 25
but 25
this 25
rule 25
merely 25
requires 25
us 25
never 25
to 25
admit 25
an 25
absolute 25
limit 25
to 25
our 25

far 25
soever 25
we 25
may 25
have 25
proceeded 25
in 25
it 25

always 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
to 25
subordinate 25
every 25
phenomenon 25
to 25
some 25
other 25

consequently 25
to 25
proceed 25
to 25
this 25
higher 25
phenomenon 25
such 25
a 25
regress 25
is 25
therefore 25
the 25
regressus 25
in 25
indefinitum 25
which 25
as 25
not 25
determining 25
a 25
quantity 25
in 25
the 25

is 25
clearly 25
distinguishable 25

from 25
what 25
we 25

said 25
that 25
we 25

not 25
justified 25
in 25
declaring 25

itself 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
possible 25
for 25
us 25
to 25
have 25
a 25

such 25
a 25
perceptionsuch 25
an 25
experience 25
is 25
impossible 25
because 25
it 25
has 25
no 25

consequently 25
an 25

therefore 25
absolutely 25
impossible 25
footnote 25
the 25
reader 25
will 25
remark 25
that 25
the 25
proof 25
presented 25
above 25
is 25
very 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
demonstration 25
given 25
in 25
the 25
antithesis 25
of 25
the 25
first 25
antinomy 25
in 25
that 25
demonstration 25
it 25
was 25
taken 25
for 25
granted 25
that 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itselfgiven 25
in 25
its 25
totality 25
prior 25
to 25
all 25
regress 25
and 25
a 25
determined 25
position 25
in 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
was 25
denied 25
to 25
itif 25
it 25
was 25
not 25
considered 25
as 25
occupying 25
all 25
time 25
and 25
all 25
space 25
hence 25
our 25
conclusion 25
differed 25
from 25
that 25
given 25
above 25
for 25
we 25
inferred 25
in 25
the 25
antithesis 25
the 25
actual 25
infinity 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
from 25
this 25
follows 25
the 25
affirmative 25
answer 25
the 25
regress 25

in 25

this 25
is 25
equivalent 25
to 25
saying 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
has 25
no 25
absolute 25
quantity 25
but 25
the 25
empirical 25

through 25
which 25
alone 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
is 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
on 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
its 25
conditions 25
rests 25
upon 25
a 25
rule 25
which 25
requires 25
it 25
to 25
proceed 25
from 25
every 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
as 25
conditioned 25
to 25
one 25
still 25
more 25
remote 25
whether 25
through 25
personal 25
experience 25

by 25
means 25
of 25
history 25

the 25

the 25
proper 25

only 25
use 25
which 25
reason 25
can 25
make 25
of 25
its 25

the 25
above 25
rule 25

not 25
prescribe 25
an 25
unceasing 25
regress 25
in 25
one 25

of 25

not 25

forbid 25
us 25
in 25
our 25

from 25
an 25

human 25

the 25

discover 25
at 25
some 25

the 25

all 25
that 25

a 25

that 25
we 25

unable 25

all 25

space 25

either 25

us 25
again 25
apply 25
the 25
remark 25
to 25
an 25
external 25
phenomenon 25
enclosed 25
in 25

that 25
is 25
a 25
body 25
the 25
divisibility 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
rests 25
upon 25
the 25
divisibility 25
of 25
space 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
body 25
as 25
an 25
extended 25
whole 25
a 25
body 25
is 25
consequently 25
divisible 25
to 25

though 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
for 25
that 25
reason 25
consist 25
of 25
an 25
infinite 25
number 25
of 25
parts 25
it 25
certainly 25
seems 25
that 25
as 25
a 25
body 25
must 25
be 25
cogitated 25
as 25
substance 25
in 25
space 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
divisibility 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
applicable 25
to 25
it 25
as 25
substance 25
for 25
we 25
may 25
and 25
ought 25
to 25
grant 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
space 25
that 25
division 25
or 25
decomposition 25
to 25
any 25
extent 25
never 25
can 25
utterly 25
annihilate 25
composition 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
smallest 25
part 25
of 25
space 25
must 25
still 25
consist 25
of 25
spaces 25
otherwise 25
space 25
would 25
entirely 25
cease 25
to 25
exist 25
which 25
is 25
impossible 25
but 25
the 25
assertion 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
band 25
that 25
when 25
all 25
composition 25
in 25
matter 25
is 25
annihilated 25
in 25
thought 25
nothing 25
remains 25
does 25
not 25
seem 25
to 25
harmonize 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
substance 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
properly 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
all 25
composition 25
and 25
must 25
remain 25
even 25
after 25
the 25
conjunction 25
of 25
its 25
attributes 25
in 25
space 25
which 25
constituted 25
a 25
bodyis 25
annihilated 25
in 25
thought 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
substance 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
thing 25
in 25
itself 25
cogitated 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
category 25
phenomenal 25
substance 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
absolute 25
subject 25
it 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
permanent 25
sensuous 25
image 25
and 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
intuition 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
but 25
although 25
this 25
rule 25
of 25
progress 25
to 25
infinity 25
is 25
legitimate 25
and 25
applicable 25
to 25
the 25
subdivision 25
of 25
a 25

allow 25
that 25

the 25

which 25
we 25
decompose 25
in 25

may 25
be 25
organized 25
for 25
the 25
infinity 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
in 25

rests 25
altogether 25
on 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
divisibility 25
of 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
is 25

only 25
in 25

that 25
is 25
an 25
undetermined 25
number 25
of 25
parts 25
is 25
given 25
while 25
the 25
parts 25
themselves 25
are 25
given 25
and 25
determined 25
only 25
in 25

through 25
the 25

the 25

the 25

that 25
the 25
whole 25
is 25
not 25
already 25
divided 25
in 25
se 25
hence 25
our 25
division 25
determines 25
a 25
number 25
of 25
parts 25
in 25
the 25
wholea 25
number 25
which 25
extends 25
just 25
as 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
actual 25

in 25
the 25

on 25
the 25
other 25

the 25
very 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
organized 25
to 25
infinity 25
represents 25
the 25
whole 25
as 25
already 25
and 25
in 25
itself 25
divided 25
we 25
expect 25
therefore 25
to 25
find 25
in 25
it 25
a 25

we 25

thus 25
have 25
a 25
whole 25

a 25

on 25
the 25

introductory 25
to 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
dynamical 25
ideas 25
we 25
presented 25
the 25
antinomy 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
in 25
a 25
tabular 25
form 25
and 25
we 25
endeavoured 25
to 25
show 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
this 25
selfcontradiction 25
on 25
the 25
part 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
the 25
only 25
means 25
of 25
bringing 25
it 25
to 25
a 25
conclusion 25
namely 25
by 25
declaring 25
both 25
contradictory 25
statements 25
to 25
be 25
false 25
we 25
represented 25
in 25
these 25
antinomies 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
phenomena 25
as 25
belonging 25
to 25
the 25
conditioned 25
according 25
to 25
relations 25
of 25
space 25
and 25
time 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
usual 25
supposition 25
of 25
the 25
common 25
understanding 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
all 25
dialectical 25
representations 25
of 25
totality 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
to 25
a 25
given 25
conditioned 25
were 25
perfectly 25
homogeneous 25
the 25
condition 25
was 25
always 25
a 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
along 25
with 25
the 25
conditioned 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
homogeneity 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
series 25
was 25
assured 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
regress 25
could 25
never 25
be 25
cogitated 25
as 25
complete 25
or 25
if 25
this 25
was 25
the 25
case 25
a 25
member 25
really 25
conditioned 25
was 25
falsely 25
regarded 25
as 25
a 25
primal 25
member 25
consequently 25
as 25
unconditioned 25
in 25
such 25
an 25
antinomy 25
therefore 25
we 25
did 25
not 25
consider 25
the 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
conditioned 25
but 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
belonging 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
and 25
the 25
magnitude 25
of 25
that 25
series 25
and 25
thus 25
arose 25
the 25
difficultya 25
difficulty 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
settled 25
by 25
any 25
decision 25
regarding 25
the 25
claims 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
parties 25
but 25
simply 25
by 25
cutting 25
the 25
knotby 25
declaring 25
the 25
series 25
proposed 25
by 25
reason 25
to 25
be 25
either 25
too 25
long 25
or 25
too 25
short 25
for 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
could 25
in 25
neither 25
case 25
make 25
its 25
conceptions 25
adequate 25
with 25
the 25
ideas 25
but 25
we 25
have 25
overlooked 25
up 25
to 25
this 25
point 25
an 25
essential 25
difference 25
existing 25
between 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
reason 25
endeavours 25
to 25
raise 25
to 25
the 25
rank 25
of 25
ideastwo 25
of 25
these 25
indicating 25
a 25
mathematical 25
and 25
two 25
a 25
dynamical 25
synthesis 25
of 25
phenomena 25
hitherto 25
it 25
was 25
necessary 25
to 25
signalize 25
this 25
distinction 25
for 25
just 25
as 25
in 25
our 25
general 25
representation 25
of 25
all 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
we 25
considered 25
them 25
under 25
phenomenal 25
conditions 25
so 25
in 25
the 25
two 25
mathematical 25
ideas 25
our 25
discussion 25
is 25
concerned 25
solely 25
with 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
but 25
as 25
we 25
are 25
now 25
about 25
to 25
proceed 25
to 25
the 25
consideration 25
of 25
the 25
dynamical 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
their 25
adequateness 25
with 25
ideas 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
lose 25
sight 25
of 25
this 25
distinction 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
it 25
opens 25
up 25
to 25
us 25
an 25
entirely 25
new 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
conflict 25
in 25
which 25
reason 25
is 25
involved 25
for 25
while 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
two 25
antinomies 25
both 25
parties 25
were 25
dismissed 25
on 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
having 25
advanced 25
statements 25
based 25
upon 25
false 25
hypothesis 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
the 25
hope 25
appears 25
of 25
discovering 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
consistent 25
with 25
the 25
demands 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
the 25
judge 25
completing 25
the 25
statement 25
of 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
claim 25
which 25
both 25
parties 25
had 25
left 25
in 25
an 25
unsatisfactory 25
state 25
the 25
question 25
may 25
be 25
settled 25
on 25
its 25
own 25
merits 25
not 25
by 25
dismissing 25
the 25
claimants 25
but 25
by 25
a 25
comparison 25
of 25
the 25
arguments 25
on 25
both 25
sides 25
if 25
we 25
consider 25
merely 25
their 25
extension 25
and 25
whether 25
they 25
are 25
adequate 25
with 25
ideas 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
may 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
all 25
homogeneous 25
but 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
these 25
ideas 25
contains 25
either 25
a 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
homogeneous 25
presupposed 25
in 25
every 25
quantityin 25
its 25
composition 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
its 25
division 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
heterogeneous 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
in 25
the 25
dynamical 25
synthesis 25
of 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
of 25
the 25
necessary 25
and 25
the 25
contingent 25
thus 25
it 25
happens 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
mathematical 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
no 25
other 25
than 25
a 25
sensuous 25
condition 25
is 25
admissiblea 25
condition 25
which 25
is 25
itself 25
a 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
while 25
the 25
dynamical 25
series 25
of 25
sensuous 25
conditions 25
admits 25
a 25
heterogeneous 25
condition 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
but 25
as 25
purely 25
intelligible 25
lies 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
it 25
and 25
thus 25
reason 25
is 25
satisfied 25
and 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
placed 25
at 25
the 25
head 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
without 25
introducing 25
confusion 25
into 25
or 25
discontinuing 25
it 25
contrary 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
now 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
dynamical 25
ideas 25
admit 25
a 25
condition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
form 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
arises 25
a 25
result 25
which 25
we 25
should 25
not 25
have 25
expected 25
from 25
an 25
antinomy 25
in 25
former 25
cases 25
the 25
result 25
was 25
that 25
both 25
contradictory 25
dialectical 25
statements 25
were 25
declared 25
to 25
be 25
false 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
we 25
find 25
the 25
conditioned 25
in 25
the 25
dynamical 25
series 25
connected 25
with 25
an 25
empirically 25
unconditioned 25
but 25
nonsensuous 25
condition 25
and 25
thus 25
satisfaction 25
is 25
done 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
hand 25
and 25
to 25
the 25
reason 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
while 25
moreover 25
the 25
dialectical 25
arguments 25
for 25
unconditioned 25
totality 25
in 25
mere 25
phenomena 25
fall 25
to 25
the 25
ground 25
both 25
propositions 25
of 25
reason 25
may 25
be 25
shown 25
to 25
be 25
true 25
in 25
their 25
proper 25
signification 25
this 25
could 25
not 25
happen 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
cosmological 25
ideas 25
which 25
demanded 25
a 25
mathematically 25
unconditioned 25
unity 25
for 25
no 25
condition 25
could 25

the 25

creates 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
spontaneity 25
which 25
can 25
begin 25
to 25
act 25
of 25
itself 25

without 25
any 25
external 25
cause 25

according 25
to 25
the 25
natural 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
it 25
is 25
especially 25
remarkable 25
that 25
the 25
practical 25
conception 25
of 25
freedom 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
the 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
question 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
difficult 25
only 25
as 25
it 25
involves 25
the 25
consideration 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
freedom 25
in 25
the 25
practical 25
sense 25
is 25
the 25
independence 25
of 25
the 25
will 25
of 25
coercion 25
by 25
sensuous 25
impulses 25
a 25
will 25
is 25
sensuous 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
pathologically 25
affected 25
by 25
sensuous 25
impulses 25
it 25
is 25
termed 25
animal 25
arbitrium 25
brutum 25
when 25
it 25
is 25
pathologically 25
necessitated 25
the 25
human 25
will 25
is 25
certainly 25
an 25
arbitrium 25
sensitivum 25
not 25
brutum 25
but 25
liberum 25
because 25
sensuousness 25
does 25
not 25
necessitate 25
its 25
action 25
a 25
faculty 25
existing 25
in 25
man 25
of 25
selfdetermination 25
independently 25
of 25
all 25
sensuous 25
coercion 25
it 25
is 25
plain 25
that 25
if 25
all 25
causality 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
were 25
naturaland 25
natural 25
onlyevery 25
event 25
would 25
be 25
determined 25
by 25
another 25
according 25
to 25
necessary 25
laws 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
phenomena 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
determine 25
the 25
will 25
must 25
necessitate 25
every 25
action 25
as 25
a 25
natural 25
effect 25
from 25
themselves 25
and 25
thus 25
all 25
practical 25
freedom 25
would 25
fall 25
to 25
the 25
ground 25
with 25
the 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
for 25
the 25
latter 25
presupposes 25
that 25
although 25
a 25
certain 25
thing 25
has 25
not 25
happened 25
it 25
ought 25
to 25
have 25
happened 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
its 25
phenomenal 25
cause 25
was 25
not 25
so 25
powerful 25
and 25
determinative 25
as 25
to 25
exclude 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
our 25
willa 25
causality 25
capable 25
of 25
producing 25
effects 25
independently 25
of 25
and 25
even 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
natural 25
causes 25
and 25
capable 25
consequently 25
of 25
spontaneously 25
originating 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
events 25
here 25
too 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
case 25
as 25
we 25
generally 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
selfcontradictions 25
and 25
perplexities 25
of 25
a 25
reason 25
which 25
strives 25
to 25
pass 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
that 25
the 25
problem 25
is 25
properly 25
not 25
physiological 25
but 25
transcendental 25
the 25
question 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
freedom 25
does 25
indeed 25
concern 25
psychology 25
but 25
as 25
it 25
rests 25
upon 25
dialectical 25
arguments 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
its 25
solution 25
must 25
engage 25
the 25
attention 25
of 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
before 25
attempting 25
this 25
solution 25
a 25
task 25
which 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
cannot 25
decline 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
advisable 25
to 25
make 25
a 25
remark 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
its 25
procedure 25
in 25
the 25
settlement 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
if 25
phenomena 25
were 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
time 25
and 25
space 25
forms 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
condition 25
and 25
conditioned 25
would 25
always 25
be 25
members 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
series 25
and 25
thus 25
would 25
arise 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
the 25
antinomy 25
common 25
to 25
all 25
transcendental 25
ideasthat 25
their 25
series 25
is 25
either 25
too 25
great 25
or 25
too 25
small 25
for 25
the 25
understanding 25
the 25
dynamical 25
ideas 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
about 25
to 25
discuss 25
in 25
this 25
and 25
the 25
following 25
section 25
possess 25
the 25
peculiarity 25
of 25
relating 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
not 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
quantity 25
but 25
as 25
an 25
existence 25
and 25
thus 25
in 25
the 25
discussion 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
question 25
we 25
may 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
the 25
quantity 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditions 25
and 25
consider 25
merely 25
the 25
dynamical 25
relation 25
of 25
the 25
condition 25
to 25
the 25
conditioned 25
the 25
question 25
then 25
suggests 25
itself 25
whether 25
freedom 25
is 25
possible 25
and 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
whether 25
it 25
can 25
consist 25
with 25
the 25
universality 25
of 25
the 25
natural 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
and 25
consequently 25
whether 25
we 25
enounce 25
a 25
proper 25
disjunctive 25
proposition 25
when 25
we 25
say 25
every 25
effect 25
must 25
have 25
its 25
origin 25
either 25
in 25
nature 25
or 25
in 25
freedom 25
or 25
whether 25
both 25
cannot 25
exist 25
together 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
event 25
in 25
different 25
relations 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
an 25
unbroken 25
connection 25
between 25
all 25
events 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
unchangeable 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
is 25
a 25
wellestablished 25
principle 25
of 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
which 25
admits 25
of 25
no 25
exception 25
the 25
question 25
therefore 25
is 25
whether 25
an 25
effect 25
determined 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
can 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
be 25
produced 25
by 25
a 25
free 25
agent 25
or 25
whether 25
freedom 25
and 25
nature 25
mutually 25
exclude 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
here 25
the 25
common 25
but 25
fallacious 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
reality 25
of 25
phenomena 25
manifests 25
its 25
injurious 25
influence 25
in 25
embarrassing 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
reason 25
for 25
if 25
phenomena 25
are 25
things 25
in 25

is 25
impossible 25
in 25
this 25
case 25

is 25
the 25

of 25

are 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
same 25

necessitated 25
by 25
the 25
same 25
law 25

on 25
the 25
contrary 25

now 25
proceed 25
to 25
exhibit 25
the 25
several 25
momenta 25

this 25

to 25
consider 25
them 25

the 25

and 25
to 25
which 25
no 25
exception 25
can 25
be 25
admitted 25
for 25
to 25
except 25
even 25
a 25
single 25
phenomenon 25
from 25
its 25
operation 25
is 25
to 25
exclude 25
it 25
from 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
thus 25
to 25
admit 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
mere 25
fiction 25
of 25
thought 25
or 25
phantom 25
of 25
the 25
brain 25
thus 25
we 25
are 25
obliged 25
to 25
acknowledge 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
chain 25
of 25
causes 25
in 25
which 25
however 25
absolute 25
totality 25
cannot 25
be 25
found 25
but 25
we 25
need 25
not 25
detain 25
ourselves 25
with 25
this 25
question 25
for 25
it 25
has 25
already 25
been 25
sufficiently 25
answered 25
in 25
our 25
discussion 25
of 25
the 25
antinomies 25
into 25
which 25
reason 25
falls 25
when 25
it 25
attempts 25
to 25
reach 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
if 25
we 25
permit 25
ourselves 25
to 25
be 25
deceived 25
by 25
the 25
illusion 25
of 25
transcendental 25
idealism 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
neither 25
nature 25
nor 25
freedom 25
exists 25
now 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
whether 25
admitting 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
natural 25
necessity 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
consider 25
an 25
effect 25
as 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
an 25
effect 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
an 25
effect 25
of 25
freedomor 25
whether 25
these 25
two 25
modes 25
of 25
causality 25
are 25
contradictory 25
and 25
incompatible 25
no 25
phenomenal 25
cause 25
can 25
absolutely 25
and 25
of 25
itself 25
begin 25
a 25
series 25
every 25
action 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
productive 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
is 25
itself 25
an 25
event 25
or 25
occurrence 25
and 25
presupposes 25
another 25
preceding 25
state 25
in 25
which 25
its 25
cause 25
existed 25
thus 25
everything 25
that 25
happens 25
is 25
but 25
a 25
continuation 25
of 25
a 25
series 25
and 25
an 25
absolute 25
beginning 25
is 25
impossible 25
in 25
the 25
sensuous 25
world 25
the 25
actions 25
of 25
natural 25
causes 25
are 25
accordingly 25
themselves 25
effects 25
and 25
presuppose 25
causes 25
preceding 25
them 25
in 25
time 25
a 25
primal 25
action 25
which 25
forms 25
an 25
absolute 25
beginning 25
is 25
beyond 25
the 25
causal 25
power 25
of 25
phenomena 25
now 25
is 25
it 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
that 25
granting 25
that 25
all 25
effects 25
are 25
phenomena 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
these 25
effects 25
must 25
also 25
be 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
and 25
belong 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
world 25
is 25
it 25
not 25
rather 25
possible 25
that 25
although 25
every 25
effect 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
must 25
be 25
connected 25
with 25
an 25
empirical 25
cause 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
universal 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
this 25
empirical 25
causality 25
may 25
be 25
itself 25
the 25

of 25

nonempirical 25
and 25
intelligible 25
causalityits 25

with 25
natural 25
causes 25
remaining 25
nevertheless 25
intact 25
such 25
a 25
causality 25
would 25
be 25
considered 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
phenomena 25
as 25
the 25
primal 25
action 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
which 25
is 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
therefore 25
not 25
phenomenal 25
but 25
by 25
reason 25
of 25
this 25
faculty 25
or 25
power 25
intelligible 25
although 25
it 25
must 25
at 25
the 25

time 25
as 25
a 25
link 25
in 25
the 25

be 25
regarded 25

world 25
a 25
belief 25
in 25
the 25
reciprocal 25
causality 25
of 25
phenomena 25
is 25
necessary 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
required 25
to 25
look 25
for 25
and 25
to 25
present 25
the 25
natural 25

of 25

that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
their 25

this 25
being 25
admitted 25
as 25
unexceptionably 25
valid 25
the 25
requirements 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
recognizes 25
nothing 25
but 25
nature 25
in 25
the 25
region 25
of 25

are 25
satisfied 25
and 25
our 25
physical 25
explanations 25
of 25
physical 25

may 25
proceed 25
in 25
their 25
regular 25
course 25
without 25
hindrance 25
and 25
without 25
opposition 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
no 25
stumblingblock 25
in 25
the 25
way 25
even 25
assuming 25
the 25
idea 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
pure 25
fiction 25
to 25
admit 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
some 25
natural 25
causes 25
in 25
the 25
possession 25
of 25
a 25
faculty 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
empirical 25
but 25
intelligible 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
determined 25
to 25
action 25
by 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
but 25
purely 25
and 25
solely 25
upon 25
grounds 25
brought 25
forward 25
by 25
the 25
understandingthis 25
action 25
being 25
still 25
when 25
the 25
cause 25
is 25
phenomenized 25
in 25
perfect 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
empirical 25
causality 25
thus 25
the 25
acting 25
subject 25
as 25
a 25
causal 25
phenomenon 25
would 25
continue 25
to 25
preserve 25
a 25
complete 25
connection 25
with 25
nature 25
and 25
natural 25

only 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
with 25
all 25
its 25
phenomenal 25
causality 25
would 25
contain 25
certain 25
conditions 25
which 25
if 25
we 25
ascend 25
from 25
the 25
empirical 25
to 25
the 25
transcendental 25
object 25
must 25
necessarily 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
intelligible 25
for 25

we 25
attend 25
in 25
our 25
inquiries 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
causes 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
to 25
the 25
directions 25
of 25
nature 25
alone 25
we 25
need 25
not 25
trouble 25
ourselves 25
about 25
the 25
relation 25
in 25

the 25
transcendental 25
subject 25
which 25
is 25
completely 25
unknown 25
to 25
us 25
stands 25
to 25
these 25
phenomena 25

in 25
nature 25
the 25
intelligible 25
ground 25
of 25
phenomena 25
in 25
this 25
subject 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
empirical 25
questions 25
it 25
has 25
to 25
do 25
only 25
with 25
pure 25
thought 25
and 25
although 25
the 25
effects 25
of 25
this 25
thought 25
and 25
action 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
are 25
discoverable 25
in 25
phenomena 25
these 25
phenomena 25
must 25
nevertheless 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
a 25
full 25

complete 25
explanation 25
upon 25
purely 25
physical 25

in 25
accordance 25
with 25
natural 25
laws 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
we 25
attend 25
solely 25
to 25
their 25
empirical 25

omit 25
all 25
consideration 25
of 25
their 25
intelligible 25
character 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
transcendental 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
as 25
completely 25
unknown 25

now 25
let 25
us 25
apply 25
this 25

this 25
empirical 25

the 25

now 25
let 25
us 25
stop 25
here 25
and 25
admit 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
at 25
least 25
possible 25
that 25
reason 25
does 25
stand 25
in 25
a 25
really 25
causal 25
relation 25
to 25
phenomena 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
it 25
mustpure 25
reason 25
as 25
it 25
isexhibit 25
an 25
empirical 25
character 25
for 25
every 25
cause 25
supposes 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
certain 25
phenomena 25
follow 25
as 25
effects 25
from 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
every 25
rule 25
requires 25
uniformity 25
in 25
these 25
effects 25
and 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
proper 25
ground 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
causeas 25
a 25
faculty 25
or 25
power 25
now 25
this 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
may 25
be 25
termed 25
the 25
empirical 25
character 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
this 25
character 25
is 25
a 25
permanent 25
one 25
while 25
the 25
effects 25
produced 25
appear 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
various 25
conditions 25
which 25
accompany 25
and 25
partly 25
limit 25
them 25
in 25
various 25
forms 25
thus 25
the 25
volition 25
of 25
every 25
man 25
has 25
an 25
empirical 25
character 25
which 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
his 25
reason 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
its 25
effects 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
manifest 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
a 25
rule 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
enabled 25
to 25
examine 25
in 25
their 25
several 25
kinds 25
and 25
degrees 25
the 25
actions 25
of 25
this 25
causality 25
and 25
the 25
rational 25
grounds 25
for 25
these 25
actions 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
to 25
decide 25
upon 25
the 25
subjective 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
volition 25
now 25
we 25
learn 25
what 25
this 25
empirical 25
character 25
is 25
only 25
from 25
phenomenal 25
effects 25
and 25
from 25
the 25
rule 25
of 25
these 25
which 25
is 25
presented 25
by 25
experience 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
all 25
the 25
actions 25
of 25
man 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
are 25
determined 25
by 25
his 25
empirical 25
character 25
and 25
the 25
cooperative 25
causes 25
of 25
nature 25
if 25
then 25
we 25
could 25
investigate 25
all 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
human 25
volition 25
to 25
their 25
lowest 25
foundation 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
there 25
would 25
be 25
no 25
action 25
which 25
we 25
could 25
not 25
anticipate 25
with 25
certainty 25
and 25
recognize 25
to 25
be 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
from 25
its 25
preceding 25
conditions 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
relates 25
to 25
this 25
empirical 25
character 25
therefore 25
there 25
can 25
be 25
no 25
freedom 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
light 25
of 25
this 25
character 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
consider 25
the 25
human 25
will 25
when 25
we 25
confine 25
ourselves 25
to 25
simple 25
observation 25
and 25
as 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
in 25
anthropology 25
institute 25
a 25
physiological 25
investigation 25
of 25
the 25
motive 25

of 25
human 25
actions 25
but 25
when 25
we 25
consider 25
the 25
same 25
actions 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
reasonnot 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
explaining 25
their 25
origin 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
speculative 25
reason 25
but 25
to 25
practical 25
reason 25
as 25
the 25
producing 25
cause 25
of 25
these 25
actionswe 25
shall 25
discover 25
a 25
rule 25
and 25
an 25
order 25
very 25
different 25
from 25
those 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25

for 25
the 25
declaration 25
of 25
this 25
mental 25
faculty 25
may 25
be 25
that 25
what 25
has 25
and 25
could 25
not 25

take 25
place 25
in 25

not 25
to 25
have 25
taken 25

sometimes 25
too 25
we 25
discover 25
or 25
believe 25
that 25
we 25
discover 25
that 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
reason 25
did 25
actually 25
stand 25
in 25
a 25
causal 25
relation 25
to 25
certain 25
actions 25
of 25
man 25
and 25
that 25
these 25
actions 25
have 25
taken 25
place 25
because 25
they 25
were 25
determined 25
not 25
by 25
empirical 25
causes 25
but 25
by 25
the 25
act 25
of 25
the 25
will 25
upon 25
grounds 25
of 25
reason 25
now 25

that 25
reason 25
stands 25
in 25
a 25
causal 25
relation 25
to 25
phenomena 25
can 25
an 25
action 25
of 25
reason 25
be 25
called 25
free 25
when 25
we 25
know 25
that 25
sensuously 25
in 25
its 25
empirical 25
character 25
it 25
is 25
completely 25
determined 25
and 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
but 25
this 25
empirical 25
character 25
is 25
itself 25
determined 25
by 25
the 25
intelligible 25
character 25
the 25
latter 25
we 25
cannot 25
cognize 25
we 25
can 25
only 25
indicate 25
it 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
phenomena 25
which 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
have 25
an 25
immediate 25
cognition 25
only 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25

then 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25

to 25
be 25
ascribed 25
to 25
an 25

say 25
not 25
the 25

only 25

precede 25
the 25

pure 25
reason 25
as 25
a 25

not 25
begin 25

not 25
make 25
its 25
appearance 25
at 25
a 25
certain 25
time 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
producing 25
an 25
effect 25
if 25
this 25
were 25
not 25
the 25
case 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25

would 25
be 25
subservient 25
to 25
the 25
natural 25
law 25
of 25
phenomena 25
which 25
determines 25
them 25

as 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
causes 25

in 25
time 25
it 25
would 25
consequently 25
cease 25
to 25
be 25
freedom 25
and 25
become 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
nature 25
we 25
are 25
therefore 25
justified 25
in 25
saying 25
if 25
reason 25
stands 25
in 25
a 25
causal 25
relation 25
to 25
phenomena 25
it 25

which 25
originates 25

condition 25
of 25
an 25
empirical 25
series 25
of 25
effects 25
for 25
the 25
condition 25
which 25
resides 25
in 25
the 25

of 25
which 25
a 25

into 25
the 25

evil 25
consequences 25
arising 25
from 25
it 25
is 25
imputed 25
to 25
the 25
offender 25
we 25
at 25
first 25
proceed 25
to 25
examine 25
the 25
empirical 25
character 25
of 25
the 25
offence 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
purpose 25
we 25
endeavour 25
to 25
penetrate 25
to 25
the 25
sources 25
of 25
that 25
character 25
such 25
as 25
a 25
defective 25
education 25
bad 25
company 25
a 25
shameless 25
and 25
wicked 25
disposition 25
frivolity 25
and 25
want 25
of 25
reflectionnot 25
forgetting 25
also 25
the 25
occasioning 25
causes 25
which 25
prevailed 25
at 25
the 25
moment 25
of 25
the 25
transgression 25
in 25
this 25
the 25
procedure 25
is 25
exactly 25
the 25
same 25
as 25
that 25
pursued 25
in 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
causes 25
which 25
determine 25
a 25
given 25
physical 25
effect 25
now 25
although 25
we 25
believe 25
the 25
action 25
to 25
have 25
been 25
determined 25
by 25
all 25
these 25
circumstances 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
the 25
less 25
blame 25
the 25
offender 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
blame 25
him 25
for 25
his 25
unhappy 25
disposition 25
nor 25
for 25
the 25
circumstances 25
which 25
influenced 25
him 25
nay 25
not 25
even 25
for 25
his 25
former 25
course 25
of 25
life 25
for 25
we 25
presuppose 25
that 25
all 25
these 25
considerations 25
may 25
be 25
set 25
aside 25
that 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
preceding 25
conditions 25
may 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
having 25
never 25
existed 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
action 25
may 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
completely 25
unconditioned 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
any 25
state 25
preceding 25
just 25
as 25
if 25
the 25
agent 25
commenced 25
with 25
it 25
an 25
entirely 25
new 25
series 25
of 25
effects 25
our 25
blame 25
of 25
the 25
offender 25
is 25
grounded 25
upon 25
a 25
law 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
requires 25
us 25
to 25
regard 25
this 25
faculty 25
as 25
a 25
cause 25
which 25
could 25
have 25
and 25
ought 25
to 25
have 25
otherwise 25
determined 25
the 25
behaviour 25
of 25
the 25
culprit 25
independently 25
of 25
all 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
this 25
causality 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
regard 25
as 25
a 25
cooperating 25
agency 25
but 25
as 25
complete 25
in 25
itself 25
it 25
matters 25
not 25
whether 25
the 25
sensuous 25
impulses 25
favoured 25
or 25
opposed 25
the 25
action 25
of 25
this 25
causality 25
the 25
offence 25
is 25
estimated 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
intelligible 25
characterthe 25
offender 25
is 25
decidedly 25
worthy 25
of 25
blame 25
the 25
moment 25
he 25
utters 25
a 25
falsehood 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
we 25
regard 25
reason 25
in 25
spite 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
act 25
as 25
completely 25
free 25
and 25
therefore 25
therefore 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
culpable 25
the 25
above 25
judgement 25
is 25
complete 25
evidence 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
accustomed 25
to 25
think 25
that 25
reason 25
is 25
not 25
affected 25
by 25
sensuous 25
conditions 25
that 25
in 25
it 25
no 25
change 25
takes 25
placealthough 25
its 25
phenomena 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
appears 25
in 25
its 25
effects 25
are 25
subject 25
to 25
changethat 25
in 25
it 25
no 25
preceding 25
state 25
determines 25
the 25
following 25
and 25
consequently 25
that 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
form 25
a 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
sensuous 25
conditions 25
which 25
necessitate 25
phenomena 25
according 25
to 25
natural 25
laws 25
reason 25
is 25
present 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
in 25
all 25
human 25
actions 25
and 25
at 25
all 25
times 25
but 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
itself 25
exist 25
in 25
time 25
and 25
therefore 25
does 25
not 25
enter 25
upon 25
any 25
state 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
did 25
not 25
formerly 25
exist 25
it 25
is 25
relatively 25
to 25
new 25
states 25
or 25
conditions 25
determining 25
but 25
not 25
determinable 25
hence 25
we 25
cannot 25
ask 25
why 25
did 25
not 25
reason 25
determine 25
itself 25
in 25
a 25
different 25
manner 25
the 25
question 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
thus 25
stated 25
why 25
did 25
not 25
reason 25
employ 25
its 25
power 25
of 25
causality 25
to 25
determine 25
certain 25
phenomena 25
in 25
a 25
different 25
manner 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
a 25
question 25
which 25
admits 25
of 25
no 25
answer 25
for 25
a 25
different 25
intelligible 25
character 25
would 25
have 25
exhibited 25
a 25
different 25
empirical 25
character 25
and 25
when 25
we 25
say 25
that 25
in 25
spite 25
of 25
the 25
course 25
which 25
his 25
whole 25
former 25
life 25
has 25
taken 25
the 25
offender 25
could 25
have 25
refrained 25
from 25
uttering 25
the 25
falsehood 25
this 25
means 25
merely 25
that 25
the 25
act 25
was 25
subject 25
to 25
the 25
power 25
and 25
authority 25
permissive 25
or 25
prohibitiveof 25
reason 25
now 25
reason 25
is 25
not 25
subject 25
in 25
its 25
causality 25
to 25
any 25
conditions 25
of 25
phenomena 25
or 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
a 25
difference 25
in 25
time 25
may 25
produce 25
a 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
phenomena 25
to 25
each 25
otherfor 25
these 25
are 25
not 25
things 25
and 25
therefore 25
not 25
causes 25
in 25
themselvesbut 25
it 25
cannot 25
produce 25
any 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
relation 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
action 25
stands 25
to 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
reason 25
thus 25
then 25
in 25
our 25
investigation 25
into 25
free 25
actions 25
and 25
the 25
causal 25
power 25
which 25
produced 25
them 25
we 25
arrive 25
at 25
an 25
intelligible 25
cause 25
beyond 25
which 25
however 25
we 25
cannot 25
go 25
although 25
we 25
can 25
recognize 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
free 25
that 25
is 25
independent 25
of 25
all 25
sensuous 25
conditions 25
and 25
that 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
the 25
sensuously 25
unconditioned 25
condition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
but 25
for 25
what 25
reason 25
the 25
intelligible 25
character 25
generates 25
such 25
and 25
such 25
phenomena 25
and 25
exhibits 25
such 25
and 25
such 25
an 25
empirical 25
character 25
under 25
certain 25
circumstances 25
it 25
is 25
beyond 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25
to 25
decide 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
as 25
much 25
above 25
the 25
power 25
and 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
reason 25
as 25
the 25
following 25
would 25
be 25
why 25
does 25
the 25
transcendental 25
object 25
of 25
our 25
external 25
sensuous 25
intuition 25
allow 25
of 25
no 25
other 25
form 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
intuition 25
in 25
space 25
but 25
the 25
problem 25
which 25
we 25
were 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
solve 25
does 25
not 25
require 25
us 25
to 25
entertain 25
any 25
such 25
questions 25
the 25
problem 25
was 25
merely 25
thiswhether 25
freedom 25
and 25
natural 25
necessity 25
can 25
exist 25
without 25
opposition 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
action 25
to 25
this 25
question 25
we 25
have 25
given 25
a 25
sufficient 25
answer 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
shown 25
that 25
as 25
the 25
former 25
stands 25
in 25
a 25
relation 25
to 25
a 25
different 25
kind 25
of 25
condition 25
from 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
does 25
not 25
affect 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
both 25
can 25
exist 25
together 25
in 25
independence 25
of 25
and 25
without 25
interference 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
the 25
reader 25
must 25
be 25
careful 25
to 25
remark 25
that 25
my 25
intention 25
in 25
the 25
above 25
remarks 25
has 25
not 25
been 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
actual 25
existence 25
of 25
freedom 25
as 25
a 25
faculty 25
in 25
which 25
resides 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
certain 25
sensuous 25
phenomena 25
for 25
not 25
to 25
mention 25
that 25
such 25
an 25
argument 25
would 25
not 25
have 25
a 25
transcendental 25
character 25
nor 25
have 25
been 25
limited 25
to 25
the 25
discussion 25
of 25
pure 25
conceptionsall 25

at 25
inferring 25
from 25

be 25
cogitated 25
in 25

with 25
its 25
laws 25
must 25
ever 25
be 25
unsuccessful 25
nay 25
more 25
i 25

not 25
even 25

at 25
demonstrating 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
freedom 25
for 25
this 25
too 25
would 25
have 25
been 25
a 25
vain 25
endeavour 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
beyond 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
to 25
cognize 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25

of 25
a 25

been 25
considered 25
in 25
the 25
foregoing 25
remarks 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
transcendental 25
idea 25

of 25
which 25
reason 25
aims 25
at 25

a 25

of 25
conditions 25
in 25
the 25

with 25
the 25
help 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
sensuously 25
unconditioned 25
involving 25
itself 25
however 25
in 25
an 25
antinomy 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
which 25
itself 25
prescribes 25
for 25
the 25
conduct 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
that 25
this 25
antinomy 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
a 25
mere 25
illusion 25
and 25
that 25

are 25
at 25

not 25

was 25
the 25
only 25
thing 25
in 25
our 25
power 25
to 25
prove 25
and 25
the 25
question 25
which 25
it 25
was 25
our 25
task 25
to 25
solve 25
iv 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
cosmological 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
phenomenal 25
existences 25
in 25
the 25
preceding 25
remarks 25
we 25
considered 25
the 25
changes 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
as 25
constituting 25
a 25
dynamical 25
series 25
in 25
which 25
each 25
member 25
is 25
subordinated 25
to 25
anotheras 25
its 25
cause 25
our 25
present 25
purpose 25
is 25
to 25
avail 25
ourselves 25
of 25
this 25
series 25
of 25
states 25
or 25
conditions 25
as 25
a 25
guide 25
to 25
an 25
existence 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
the 25
highest 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
changeable 25
phenomena 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
our 25
endeavour 25
to 25
reach 25
not 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
causality 25
but 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
existence 25
of 25
substance 25
the 25
series 25
before 25
us 25
is 25
therefore 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
not 25
of 25
intuitions 25
in 25
which 25
the 25
one 25
intuition 25
is 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
as 25
all 25
phenomena 25
are 25
subject 25
to 25
change 25
and 25
conditioned 25
in 25
their 25
existence 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
dependent 25
existences 25
cannot 25
embrace 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
member 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
which 25
would 25
be 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
if 25
phenomena 25
were 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
andas 25
an 25
immediate 25
consequence 25
from 25
this 25
supposition 25
condition 25
and 25
conditioned 25
belonged 25
to 25
the 25
same 25
series 25
of 25

existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
sensuous 25
phenomena 25
would 25
be 25
perfectly 25
impossible 25
an 25
important 25
distinction 25
however 25
exists 25
between 25
the 25
dynamical 25
and 25
the 25
mathematical 25
regress 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
engaged 25
solely 25
with 25
the 25
combination 25
of 25
parts 25
into 25
a 25
whole 25
or 25
with 25
the 25
division 25
of 25
a 25
whole 25
into 25
its 25
parts 25
and 25
therefore 25
are 25
the 25

of 25
its 25

of 25
the 25

to 25
be 25
consequently 25
regarded 25
as 25
homogeneous 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
as 25
consisting 25
without 25
exception 25
of 25
phenomena 25
if 25

on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25

of 25
which 25
is 25
not 25

the 25
possibility 25
of 25

the 25

the 25

from 25
the 25
difficulty 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
impossible 25
that 25
both 25
of 25

may 25
be 25
true 25
in 25
different 25
relations 25
all 25
sensuous 25
phenomena 25
may 25
be 25
contingent 25
and 25
consequently 25
possess 25
only 25
an 25
empirically 25
conditioned 25
existence 25
and 25
yet 25
there 25
may 25
also 25
exist 25
a 25
nonempirical 25
condition 25
of 25

in 25
other 25

for 25
this 25

the 25

uninterfered 25

this 25

also 25
form 25

of 25
distinction 25
between 25

employed 25
for 25
the 25

and 25
only 25
its 25
causality 25
to 25
the 25
intelligible 25
worldwe 25
are 25
obliged 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
to 25
cogitate 25
this 25
necessary 25
being 25
as 25
purely 25
intelligible 25
and 25
as 25
existing 25
entirely 25
apart 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
as 25
an 25
ens 25
extramundanum 25

otherwise 25
it 25
would 25
be 25

the 25

and 25
dependence 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
present 25
problem 25
therefore 25
the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
that 25
everything 25
in 25
the 25
sensuous 25
world 25
possesses 25
an 25
empirically 25
conditioned 25
existencethat 25
no 25
property 25
of 25
the 25
sensuous 25
world 25
possesses 25
unconditioned 25
necessitythat 25
we 25
are 25
bound 25
to 25
expect 25
and 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
seek 25
for 25
the 25
empirical 25
condition 25
of 25
every 25
member 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
conditionsand 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
sufficient 25
reason 25
to 25
justify 25
us 25
in 25
deducing 25
any 25
existence 25
from 25
a 25
condition 25
which 25
lies 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
empirical 25
series 25
or 25
in 25
regarding 25
any 25
existence 25
as 25
independent 25
and 25
selfsubsistent 25
although 25
this 25
should 25
not 25
prevent 25
us 25
from 25
recognizing 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
series 25
being 25
based 25
upon 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
is 25
intelligible 25
and 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
free 25
from 25
all 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
but 25
it 25
has 25
been 25
far 25
from 25
my 25
intention 25
in 25
these 25
remarks 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
this 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
necessary 25
being 25
or 25
even 25
to 25
evidence 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
purely 25
intelligible 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
or 25
all 25
sensuous 25
phenomena 25
as 25
bounds 25
were 25
set 25
to 25
reason 25
to 25
prevent 25
it 25
from 25
leaving 25
the 25
guiding 25
thread 25
of 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
and 25
losing 25
itself 25
in 25
transcendent 25
theories 25
which 25
are 25
incapable 25
of 25
concrete 25
presentation 25
so 25
it 25
was 25
my 25
purpose 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
band 25
to 25
set 25
bounds 25
to 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
the 25
purely 25
empirical 25
understanding 25
and 25
to 25
protest 25
against 25
any 25
attempts 25
on 25
its 25
part 25
at 25
deciding 25
on 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
or 25
declaring 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
intelligible 25
to 25
be 25
impossible 25
merely 25
on 25
the 25
ground 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
available 25
for 25
the 25
explanation 25
and 25
exposition 25
of 25
phenomena 25
it 25
has 25
been 25
shown 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
that 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
their 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
is 25
quite 25
consistent 25
with 25
the 25
arbitrary 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
although 25
purely 25
intelligible 25
condition 25
that 25
no 25
real 25
contradiction 25
exists 25
between 25
them 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
both 25
may 25
be 25
true 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
such 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25

may 25
be 25

this 25

us 25

too 25
its 25

nothing 25

that 25

the 25

no 25

affirming 25

that 25
occasioning 25
the 25
fourth 25
antinomy 25
which 25
compels 25
us 25
to 25
venture 25
upon 25
this 25
step 25
for 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
phenomena 25
always 25
conditioned 25
and 25
never 25
selfsubsistent 25
requires 25
us 25
to 25
look 25
for 25
an 25
object 25
different 25
from 25
phenomenaan 25
intelligible 25
object 25
with 25
which 25
all 25
contingency 25
must 25
cease 25
but 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
allowed 25
ourselves 25
to 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
selfsubsistent 25
reality 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
are 25
therefore 25
obliged 25
to 25
regard 25
phenomena 25
as 25
merely 25
a 25
contingent 25
mode 25
of 25
representing 25
intelligible 25
objects 25
employed 25
by 25
beings 25
which 25
are 25
themselves 25
intelligencesno 25
other 25
course 25
remains 25
for 25
us 25
than 25
to 25
follow 25
analogy 25
and 25
employ 25
the 25
same 25
mode 25
in 25
forming 25
some 25
conception 25
of 25
intelligible 25
things 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
the 25
least 25
knowledge 25
which 25
nature 25
taught 25
us 25
to 25
use 25
in 25
the 25
formation 25
of 25
empirical 25
conceptions 25
experience 25
made 25
us 25
acquainted 25
with 25
the 25
contingent 25
but 25
we 25
are 25
at 25
present 25
engaged 25
in 25
the 25
discussion 25
of 25
things 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
must 25
therefore 25
deduce 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
them 25
from 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
necessary 25
absolutely 25
and 25
in 25
itself 25
that 25
is 25
from 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
hence 25
the 25
first 25
step 25
which 25
we 25
take 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
of 25

us 25
to 25
begin 25
our 25
system 25
of 25
new 25
cognition 25
with 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
and 25
to 25
deduce 25
from 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
it 25
all 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25

the 25

under 25

that 25

not 25
only 25

ideals 25

they 25
may 25
be 25
considered 25

wisdom 25

the 25
wise 25
man 25

is 25
an 25

is 25

say 25
a 25
human 25

only 25
in 25
thought 25

in 25
complete 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
wisdom 25
as 25
the 25
idea 25
provides 25
a 25
rule 25
so 25
the 25
ideal 25
serves 25
as 25
an 25
archetype 25
for 25
the 25
perfect 25

complete 25

thus 25
the 25
conduct 25

us 25

demands 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
attained 25
by 25
us 25

we 25
cannot 25
concede 25

to 25
these 25

are 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
chimeras 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
they 25
provide 25
reason 25
with 25
a 25
standard 25
which 25
enables 25
it 25
to 25

the 25

must 25
be 25
little 25
edifying 25
as 25
the 25
natural 25

consider 25
all 25
possible 25
predicates 25
not 25
merely 25
logically 25
but 25
transcendentally 25
that 25

say 25
with 25

to 25
the 25

be 25
cogitated 25
as 25
existing 25
in 25
them 25
a 25

we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
some 25
indicate 25
a 25
being 25
others 25
merely 25
a 25
nonbeing 25
the 25
logical 25
negation 25
expressed 25
in 25
the 25
word 25
not 25
does 25
not 25
properly 25
belong 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25

only 25
to 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
one 25
conception 25
to 25
another 25
in 25
a 25
judgement 25

is 25
consequently 25
quite 25
insufficient 25
to 25
present 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
a 25
conception 25
the 25

not 25

at 25
all 25
a 25
transcendental 25
negation 25

the 25
contrary 25

itself 25

is 25
opposed 25
to 25
transcendental 25

this 25

indicates 25
a 25

in 25

while 25
the 25
opposite 25
negation 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
band 25
indicates 25
a 25
mere 25
want 25
or 25
privation 25
or 25
absence 25
and 25
where 25
such 25
negations 25
alone 25
are 25
attached 25

a 25

the 25

have 25
taught 25
us 25
much 25
that 25
is 25
wonderful 25

the 25
most 25
important 25
lesson 25
we 25
have 25
received 25
from 25
them 25
is 25
the 25
discovery 25

without 25

thus 25
derived 25
could 25
never 25
have 25
conceived 25
this 25
discovery 25
of 25
our 25
deficiencies 25
must 25
produce 25
a 25
great 25
change 25
in 25
the 25

the 25

of 25
human 25
reason 25
if 25
therefore 25
a 25
transcendental 25

it 25

cannot 25
itself 25

thus 25
it 25
satisfies 25
in 25
one 25
respect 25
at 25
least 25
the 25
requirements 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
absolute 25

in 25
this 25
view 25
it 25
is 25
superior 25
to 25
all 25
other 25
conceptions 25
which 25
as 25
deficient 25
and 25
incomplete 25
do 25
not 25
possess 25
the 25
characteristic 25
of 25
independence 25
of 25
all 25
higher 25
conditions 25
it 25
is 25
true 25

we 25
cannot 25
infer 25
from 25
this 25
that 25
what 25

as 25
little 25
can 25
we 25
assert 25
the 25
contrary 25

this 25
supposed 25

does 25
not 25

only 25
characteristic 25

enable 25
reason 25
to 25
cognize 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
an 25
a 25

conception 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
necessary 25
nature 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
that 25
which 25
best 25
agrees 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
necessary 25
being 25
the 25
former 25
conception 25
does 25
not 25
satisfy 25
all 25
the 25
requirements 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
choice 25
we 25
are 25
obliged 25
to 25
adhere 25
to 25
it 25
for 25
we 25
find 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
do 25
without 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
and 25
even 25
although 25
we 25
admit 25
it 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
out 25
of 25
our 25
power 25
to 25
discover 25
in 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
possibility 25
any 25
being 25
that 25
can 25
advance 25
wellgrounded 25
claims 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
distinction 25
the 25
following 25
is 25
therefore 25
the 25
natural 25
course 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
it 25
begins 25
by 25
persuading 25
itself 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
some 25
necessary 25
being 25
in 25
this 25
being 25
it 25
recognizes 25
the 25
characteristics 25
of 25
unconditioned 25
existence 25
it 25
then 25
seeks 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
independent 25
of 25
all 25
conditions 25
and 25
finds 25
it 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
itself 25
the 25
sufficient 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
other 25
thingsin 25
other 25
words 25
in 25
that 25
which 25
contains 25
all 25
reality 25
but 25
the 25
unlimited 25
all 25
is 25
an 25
absolute 25
unity 25
and 25
is 25
conceived 25
by 25
the 25
mind 25
as 25
a 25
being 25
one 25
and 25
supreme 25
and 25
thus 25
reason 25
concludes 25
that 25
the 25
supreme 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
primal 25
basis 25
of 25
all 25
things 25
possesses 25
an 25
existence 25
which 25
is 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
this 25
conception 25
must 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
in 25
some 25
degree 25
satisfactory 25
if 25
we 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
and 25
consider 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
a 25
necessity 25
for 25
a 25
definite 25
and 25
final 25
answer 25
to 25
these 25
questions 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
we 25
cannot 25
make 25
a 25
better 25
choice 25
or 25
rather 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
choice 25
at 25
all 25
but 25
feel 25
ourselves 25
obliged 25
to 25
declare 25
in 25
favour 25
of 25
the 25
absolute 25
unity 25
of 25
complete 25
reality 25
as 25
the 25
highest 25
source 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
if 25
there 25
exists 25
no 25
motive 25
for 25
coming 25
to 25
a 25
definite 25
conclusion 25
and 25
we 25
may 25
leave 25
the 25
question 25
unanswered 25
till 25
we 25
have 25
fully 25
weighed 25
both 25
sidesin 25
other 25
words 25
when 25
we 25
are 25
merely 25
called 25
upon 25
to 25
decide 25
how 25
much 25
we 25
happen 25
to 25
know 25
about 25
the 25
question 25
and 25
how 25
much 25
we 25
merely 25
flatter 25
ourselves 25
that 25
we 25
know 25
the 25
above 25
conclusion 25
does 25
not 25
appear 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
great 25
advantage 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
seems 25
defective 25
in 25
the 25
grounds 25
upon 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
supported 25
for 25
admitting 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
that 25
namely 25
the 25
inference 25
from 25
a 25
given 25
existence 25
my 25
own 25
for 25
example 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
necessary 25
being 25
is 25
valid 25
and 25
unassailable 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
place 25
we 25
must 25
consider 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
contains 25
all 25
reality 25
and 25
consequently 25
all 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
other 25
things 25
to 25
be 25
absolutely 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
admitting 25
too 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
thus 25
discovered 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
to 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
attributed 25
without 25

does 25
not 25
follow 25
from 25
all 25
this 25
that 25

in 25
which 25
the 25

in 25
a 25

free 25
to 25
consider 25
all 25

beings 25
as 25
likewise 25
unconditionally 25
necessary 25

from 25

other 25

in 25
this 25
case 25
be 25
destroyed 25
by 25
a 25
practical 25
addition 25
indeed 25
reason 25

be 25
compelled 25
to 25
condemn 25
herself 25
if 25
she 25

with 25
the 25

the 25
judgement 25

the 25

of 25
the 25

is 25
so 25
simple 25
and 25
natural 25
that 25
the 25
commonest 25
understanding 25
can 25
appreciate 25
its 25
value 25
we 25

again 25

itselfas 25
a 25
datum 25
of 25
experience 25
now 25
it 25
is 25
natural 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
place 25
the 25
highest 25
causality 25
just 25
where 25
we 25
place 25
supreme 25
causality 25
in 25
that 25
being 25
which 25
contains 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
effects 25
and 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
so 25
simple 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
an 25
allembracing 25
reality 25
this 25
highest 25
cause 25
then 25
we 25
regard 25
as 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
because 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
to 25
rise 25
to 25
it 25
and 25
do 25
not 25
discover 25
any 25
reason 25
for 25
proceeding 25
beyond 25
it 25
thus 25
among 25
all 25

some 25
faint 25
sparks 25
of 25
monotheism 25
to 25
which 25
these 25
idolaters 25
have 25
been 25
led 25
not 25
from 25
reflection 25

be 25

to 25
the 25

the 25

with 25
an 25
examination 25

afterwards 25
inquire 25
what 25

of 25

of 25
the 25

of 25
god 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
from 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
said 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
established 25
by 25
the 25
mere 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
need 25
of 25
reason 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
this 25
idea 25
serves 25
merely 25
to 25
indicate 25
a 25
certain 25
unattainable 25
perfection 25
and 25
rather 25
limits 25
the 25
operations 25
than 25
by 25
the 25
presentation 25
of 25
new 25
objects 25
extends 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
but 25
a 25
strange 25
anomaly 25
meets 25
us 25
at 25
the 25
very 25
threshold 25
for 25
the 25
inference 25
from 25
a 25
given 25
existence 25
in 25
general 25
to 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
existence 25
seems 25
to 25
be 25
correct 25
and 25
unavoidable 25
while 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
refuse 25
to 25
aid 25
us 25
in 25
forming 25
any 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
philosophers 25
have 25
always 25
talked 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
and 25
have 25
nevertheless 25
declined 25
to 25
take 25
the 25
trouble 25
of 25
conceiving 25
whetherand 25
howa 25
being 25
of 25
this 25
nature 25
is 25
even 25
cogitable 25
not 25
to 25
mention 25
that 25
its 25
existence 25
is 25
actually 25
demonstrable 25
a 25
verbal 25
definition 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
is 25
certainly 25
easy 25
enough 25
it 25
is 25
something 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
impossible 25
but 25
does 25
this 25
definition 25
throw 25
any 25
light 25
upon 25
the 25
conditions 25
which 25
render 25
it 25
impossible 25
to 25
cogitate 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
a 25
thingconditions 25
which 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
ascertain 25
that 25
we 25
may 25
discover 25
whether 25
we 25
think 25
anything 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
or 25
not 25
for 25
the 25
mere 25
fact 25
that 25
i 25
throw 25
away 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
word 25
unconditioned 25
all 25
the 25
conditions 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
habitually 25
requires 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
regard 25
anything 25
as 25
necessary 25
is 25
very 25
far 25
from 25
making 25
clear 25
whether 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25

current 25
many 25
have 25
endeavoured 25
to 25
explain 25
by 25
examples 25
which 25
seemed 25
to 25
render 25
any 25
inquiries 25
regarding 25
its 25
intelligibility 25
quite 25
needless 25
every 25
geometrical 25
propositiona 25

was 25
said 25
is 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
and 25
thus 25
people 25
talked 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
which 25
lay 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
understanding 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
perfectly 25
plain 25
what 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
meant 25
all 25
the 25
examples 25
adduced 25
have 25
been 25
drawn 25
without 25
exception 25
from 25
judgements 25
and 25
not 25
from 25
things 25
but 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25
does 25
not 25
form 25
the 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
judgement 25
is 25
only 25
a 25
conditioned 25
necessity 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
predicate 25
in 25
a 25
judgement 25
the 25
proposition 25
abovementioned 25
does 25
not 25
enounce 25
that 25
three 25
angles 25
necessarily 25
exist 25
but 25
upon 25
condition 25
that 25
a 25
triangle 25
exists 25
three 25
angles 25
must 25
necessarily 25
existin 25
it 25
and 25
thus 25
this 25
logical 25
necessity 25
has 25
been 25
the 25
source 25
of 25
the 25
greatest 25
delusions 25
having 25
formed 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
which 25
was 25
made 25
to 25
embrace 25
existence 25
we 25
believed 25
ourselves 25
safe 25
in 25
concluding 25
that 25
because 25
existence 25
belongs 25
necessarily 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
that 25
is 25
under 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
my 25
positing 25
this 25
thing 25
as 25
given 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
is 25
also 25
posited 25
necessarily 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
therefore 25
absolutely 25
necessarymerely 25
because 25
its 25
existence 25
has 25
been 25
cogitated 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
if 25
in 25
an 25
identical 25
judgement 25
i 25
annihilate 25
the 25
predicate 25
in 25
thought 25
and 25
retain 25
the 25
subject 25
a 25
contradiction 25
is 25
the 25
result 25
and 25
hence 25
i 25
say 25
the 25
former 25
belongs 25
necessarily 25
to 25
the 25
latter 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
suppress 25
both 25
subject 25
and 25
predicate 25
in 25
thought 25
no 25
contradiction 25
arises 25
for 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
at 25
all 25
and 25
therefore 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
forming 25
a 25
contradiction 25
to 25
suppose 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
triangle 25
and 25
not 25
that 25
of 25
its 25
three 25
angles 25
is 25
selfcontradictory 25
but 25
to 25
suppose 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
both 25
triangle 25
and 25
angles 25
is 25
perfectly 25
admissible 25
and 25
so 25
is 25
it 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
annihilate 25
its 25
existence 25
in 25
thought 25
and 25
you 25
annihilate 25
the 25
thing 25
itself 25
with 25
all 25
its 25
predicates 25
how 25
then 25
can 25
there 25
be 25
any 25
room 25
for 25
contradiction 25
externally 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
to 25
give 25
rise 25
to 25
a 25
contradiction 25
for 25
a 25
thing 25
cannot 25
be 25
necessary 25
externally 25
nor 25
internally 25
for 25
by 25
the 25
annihilation 25
or 25
suppression 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
itself 25
its 25
internal 25

myself 25

when 25
annihilated 25

behind 25

is 25
the 25
only 25
criterion 25

impossibility 25
in 25
the 25

no 25

one 25

only 25
one 25

the 25
nonbeing 25

this 25
i 25
am 25
willing 25

the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25

which 25
is 25
not 25
selfcontradictory 25
is 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
sufficient 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25

it 25
that 25
of 25

the 25
notion 25
of 25

lies 25
therefore 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25

was 25
cogitated 25
in 25
my 25
conception 25
would 25
exist 25
and 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
affirm 25
that 25
the 25
exact 25
object 25
of 25
my 25
conception 25
had 25
real 25
existence 25
if 25
i 25
cogitate 25
a 25
thing 25
as 25
containing 25
all 25
modes 25
of 25
reality 25
except 25
one 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
reality 25
which 25
is 25
absent 25
is 25
not 25
added 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
thing 25
by 25
the 25
affirmation 25
that 25
the 25
thing 25
exists 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
the 25
thing 25
existsif 25
it 25
exist 25
at 25
allwith 25
the 25
same 25
defect 25
as 25
that 25
cogitated 25
in 25
its 25
conception 25
otherwise 25
not 25
that 25
which 25
was 25
cogitated 25
but 25
something 25
different 25
exists 25
now 25
if 25
i 25
cogitate 25
a 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
highest 25
reality 25
without 25
defect 25
or 25
imperfection 25
the 25
question 25
still 25
remainswhether 25
this 25
being 25
exists 25
or 25
not 25
for 25
although 25
no 25
element 25
is 25
wanting 25
in 25
the 25
possible 25
real 25
content 25
of 25
my 25
conception 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
defect 25
in 25
its 25
relation 25
to 25
my 25
mental 25
state 25
that 25
is 25
i 25
am 25
ignorant 25
whether 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
indicated 25
by 25
the 25
conception 25
is 25
possible 25
a 25
posteriori 25
and 25
here 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
present 25
difficulty 25
becomes 25
apparent 25
if 25
the 25
question 25
regarded 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
sense 25
merely 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
impossible 25
for 25
me 25
to 25
confound 25
the 25
conception 25
with 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
for 25
the 25
conception 25
merely 25
enables 25
me 25
to 25
cogitate 25
an 25
object 25
as 25
according 25
with 25
the 25
general 25
conditions 25
of 25
experience 25
while 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
permits 25
me 25
to 25
cogitate 25
it 25
as 25
contained 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
actual 25
experience 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
this 25
connection 25
with 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
does 25
not 25
in 25
the 25
least 25
augment 25
the 25
conception 25
although 25
a 25
possible 25
perception 25
has 25
been 25
added 25
to 25
the 25
experience 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
cogitate 25
existence 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
category 25
alone 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
wondered 25
at 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
find 25
ourselves 25
unable 25
to 25
present 25
any 25
criterion 25
sufficient 25
to 25
distinguish 25
it 25
from 25
mere 25
possibility 25
whatever 25
be 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
go 25
beyond 25
it 25
if 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
predicate 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
sensuous 25
objects 25
this 25
is 25
attained 25
by 25
their 25
connection 25
according 25
to 25
empirical 25
laws 25
with 25
some 25
one 25
of 25
my 25
perceptions 25
but 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
cognizing 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
objects 25
of 25
pure 25
thought 25
because 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
cognized 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
all 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
existence 25
be 25
it 25
immediately 25
by 25
perception 25
or 25
by 25
inferences 25
connecting 25
some 25
object 25
with 25
a 25
perception 25
belongs 25
entirely 25
to 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experiencewhich 25
is 25
in 25
perfect 25
unity 25
with 25
itself 25
and 25
although 25
an 25
existence 25
out 25
of 25
this 25
sphere 25
cannot 25
be 25
absolutely 25
declared 25
to 25
be 25
impossible 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
ascertaining 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
is 25
in 25
many 25
respects 25
a 25
highly 25
useful 25
idea 25
but 25
for 25
the 25
very 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
an 25
idea 25
it 25
is 25
incapable 25
of 25
enlarging 25
our 25
cognition 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
even 25
sufficient 25
to 25
instruct 25
us 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
to 25
exist 25
the 25
analytical 25
criterion 25
of 25
possibility 25
which 25
consists 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
contradiction 25
in 25
propositions 25
cannot 25
be 25
denied 25
it 25
but 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
real 25
properties 25
in 25
a 25
thing 25
is 25
a 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
which 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
judgement 25
cannot 25
be 25
formed 25
because 25
these 25
realities 25
are 25
not 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
specifically 25
and 25
even 25
if 25
this 25
were 25
to 25
happen 25
a 25
judgement 25
would 25
still 25
be 25
impossible 25
because 25
the 25
criterion 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
synthetical 25
cognitions 25
must 25
be 25
sought 25
for 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
an 25
idea 25
cannot 25
belong 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
celebrated 25
leibnitz 25
has 25
utterly 25
failed 25
in 25
his 25
attempt 25
to 25
establish 25
upon 25
a 25
priori 25
grounds 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
this 25
sublime 25
ideal 25
being 25
the 25
celebrated 25
ontological 25
or 25
cartesian 25
argument 25
for 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
is 25
therefore 25
insufficient 25
and 25
we 25
may 25
as 25
well 25
hope 25
to 25
increase 25
our 25
stock 25
of 25
knowledge 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
mere 25
ideas 25
as 25

of 25
the 25

was 25
by 25
no 25

a 25
natural 25
course 25
of 25
proceeding 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
an 25
invention 25
entirely 25
due 25
to 25
the 25
subtlety 25

corresponding 25
to 25

such 25
a 25
course 25
would 25
never 25
have 25
been 25
pursued 25
were 25
it 25
not 25
for 25
that 25
need 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
requires 25
it 25
to 25
suppose 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
as 25
a 25
basis 25
for 25
the 25
empirical 25
regress 25
and 25
that 25
as 25
this 25
necessity 25
must 25
be 25
unconditioned 25
and 25
a 25
priori 25
reason 25
is 25
bound 25
to 25
discover 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
shall 25
satisfy 25
if 25
possible 25
this 25
requirement 25
and 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
this 25
conception 25
was 25
thought 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
and 25
thus 25
this 25
idea 25
was 25
employed 25
for 25
the 25
attainment 25
of 25
a 25
better 25
defined 25
knowledge 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
were 25
convinced 25
or 25
persuaded 25
on 25
other 25
grounds 25
thus 25
reason 25
was 25
seduced 25
from 25
her 25
natural 25
courage 25
and 25
instead 25
of 25
concluding 25
with 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
an 25
attempt 25
was 25
made 25
to 25
begin 25
with 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
inferring 25
from 25
it 25
that 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
existence 25
which 25
it 25
was 25
in 25
fact 25
called 25
in 25
to 25
complete 25
thus 25
arose 25
that 25
unfortunate 25
ontological 25
argument 25
which 25
neither 25
satisfies 25
the 25
healthy 25
common 25
sense 25
of 25
humanity 25
nor 25
sustains 25
the 25
scientific 25
examination 25
of 25
the 25
philosopher 25
the 25
cosmological 25
proof 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
about 25
to 25
examine 25
retains 25
the 25
connection 25
between 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
and 25
the 25
highest 25
reality 25
but 25
instead 25
of 25
reasoning 25
from 25
this 25
highest 25
reality 25
to 25
a 25
necessary 25
existence 25
like 25
the 25
preceding 25
argument 25
it 25
concludes 25
from 25
the 25
given 25
unconditioned 25
necessity 25
of 25
some 25
being 25
its 25
unlimited 25
reality 25
the 25
track 25
it 25
pursues 25
whether 25
rational 25
or 25
sophistical 25
is 25
at 25
least 25
natural 25
and 25
not 25
only 25
goes 25
far 25
to 25
persuade 25
the 25
common 25
understanding 25
but 25
shows 25
itself 25
deserving 25
of 25
respect 25
from 25
the 25
speculative 25
intellect 25
while 25
it 25
contains 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
the 25
outlines 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
arguments 25
employed 25
in 25
natural 25
theologyarguments 25
which 25
always 25
have 25
been 25
and 25
still 25
will 25
be 25
in 25
use 25
and 25
authority 25
these 25
however 25
adorned 25
and 25
hid 25
under 25
whatever 25
embellishments 25
of 25
rhetoric 25
and 25
sentiment 25
are 25
at 25
bottom 25
identical 25
with 25
the 25
arguments 25
we 25
are 25
at 25
present 25
to 25
discuss 25
this 25
proof 25
termed 25
by 25
leibnitz 25
the 25
argumentum 25
a 25
contingentia 25
mundi 25
i 25
shall 25
now 25
lay 25
before 25
the 25
reader 25
and 25
subject 25
to 25
a 25
strict 25
examination 25
it 25
is 25
framed 25
in 25
the 25
following 25
manner 25
if 25
something 25
exists 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
must 25
likewise 25
exist 25
now 25
i 25
at 25
least 25
exist 25
consequently 25
there 25
exists 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
the 25
minor 25
contains 25
an 25
experience 25
the 25
major 25
reasons 25
from 25
a 25
general 25
experience 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
thus 25
this 25
argument 25
really 25
begins 25
at 25
experience 25
and 25
is 25
not 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
or 25
ontological 25
the 25

called 25

proof 25
it 25
contains 25
no 25
reference 25
to 25
any 25
peculiar 25
property 25
of 25
sensuous 25
objects 25
by 25
which 25
this 25

of 25
sense 25
might 25
be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
other 25
possible 25
worlds 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
it 25
differs 25
from 25
the 25
physicotheological 25
proof 25
which 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
the 25
consideration 25
of 25
the 25
peculiar 25
constitution 25
of 25
our 25
sensuous 25
world 25
footnote 25
this 25
inference 25
is 25
too 25
well 25
known 25
to 25
require 25
more 25
detailed 25
discussion 25
it 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
the 25
spurious 25
transcendental 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
that 25
everything 25
which 25
is 25
contingent 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
which 25
if 25
itself 25
contingent 25
must 25
also 25
have 25
a 25
cause 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
till 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
subordinated 25
causes 25
must 25
end 25
with 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
cause 25
without 25
which 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
possess 25
completeness 25
the 25
proof 25
proceeds 25
thus 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
can 25
be 25
determined 25
only 25
in 25
one 25
way 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
determined 25
by 25
only 25
one 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
opposed 25
predicates 25
consequently 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
completely 25
determined 25
in 25
and 25
by 25
its 25
conception 25
but 25
there 25
is 25
only 25
a 25
single 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
possible 25
which 25
completely 25
determines 25
the 25
thing 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
conception 25
by 25
and 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
cogitate 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
consequently 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
necessarily 25
exists 25
in 25
this 25
cosmological 25
argument 25
are 25
assembled 25
so 25
many 25
sophistical 25
propositions 25
that 25
speculative 25
reason 25
seems 25
to 25
have 25
exerted 25
in 25
it 25
all 25
her 25
dialectical 25
skill 25
to 25
produce 25
a 25
transcendental 25
illusion 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
extreme 25
character 25
we 25
shall 25
postpone 25
an 25
investigation 25
of 25
this 25
argument 25
for 25
the 25
present 25
and 25
confine 25
ourselves 25
to 25
exposing 25
the 25
stratagem 25
by 25
which 25
it 25
imposes 25
upon 25
us 25
an 25
old 25
argument 25
in 25
a 25
new 25
dress 25
and 25
appeals 25
to 25
the 25
agreement 25
of 25
two 25
witnesses 25
the 25
one 25
with 25
the 25
credentials 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
the 25
other 25
with 25
those 25
of 25
empiricism 25
while 25
in 25
fact 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
former 25
who 25
has 25
changed 25
his 25
dress 25
and 25
voice 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
passing 25
himself 25
off 25
for 25
an 25
additional 25
witness 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
possess 25
a 25
secure 25
foundation 25
it 25
bases 25
its 25
conclusions 25
upon 25
experience 25
and 25
thus 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
completely 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
ontological 25
argument 25
which 25
places 25
its 25
confidence 25
entirely 25
in 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
conceptions 25
but 25
this 25
experience 25
merely 25
aids 25
reason 25
in 25
making 25
one 25
stepto 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
what 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
this 25
being 25
are 25
cannot 25
be 25
learned 25
from 25
experience 25
and 25
therefore 25
reason 25
abandons 25
it 25
altogether 25
and 25
pursues 25
its 25
inquiries 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
pure 25
conception 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
discovering 25
what 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
that 25
is 25
what 25
among 25
all 25
possible 25
things 25
contain 25
the 25
conditions 25
requisita 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
reason 25
believes 25
that 25
it 25
has 25
discovered 25
these 25
requisites 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimumand 25
in 25
it 25
alone 25
and 25
hence 25
concludes 25
the 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
reason 25
has 25
here 25
presupposed 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
perfectly 25
adequate 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
that 25
is 25
that 25
we 25
may 25
infer 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
formera 25
proposition 25
which 25
formed 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
the 25
ontological 25
argument 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
now 25
employed 25
in 25
the 25
support 25
of 25
the 25
cosmological 25
argument 25
contrary 25
to 25
the 25
wish 25
and 25
professions 25
of 25
its 25
inventors 25
for 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
is 25
given 25
in 25
conceptions 25
alone 25
but 25
if 25
i 25
say 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
and 25
in 25
fact 25
the 25
only 25
conception 25
which 25
is 25
adequate 25
to 25
our 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
i 25
am 25
obliged 25
to 25
admit 25
that 25
the 25
latter 25
may 25
be 25
inferred 25
from 25
the 25
former 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
properly 25
the 25
ontological 25
argument 25
which 25
figures 25
in 25
the 25
cosmological 25
and 25
constitutes 25
the 25
whole 25
strength 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
while 25
the 25
spurious 25
basis 25
of 25
experience 25
has 25
been 25
of 25
no 25
further 25
use 25
than 25
to 25
conduct 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
being 25
utterly 25
insufficient 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
this 25
attribute 25
in 25
any 25
determinate 25
existence 25
or 25
thing 25
for 25
when 25
we 25
propose 25
to 25
ourselves 25
an 25
aim 25
of 25
this 25
character 25
we 25
must 25
abandon 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
rise 25
to 25
that 25
of 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
which 25
we 25
examine 25
with 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
discovering 25
whether 25
any 25
one 25
contains 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
but 25
if 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
is 25
thus 25
demonstrated 25
its 25
existence 25
is 25
also 25
proved 25
for 25
we 25
may 25
then 25
assert 25
that 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
beings 25
there 25
is 25
one 25
which 25
possesses 25
the 25
attribute 25
of 25
necessityin 25
other 25
words 25
this 25
being 25
possesses 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
existence 25
all 25
illusions 25
in 25
an 25
argument 25
are 25
more 25
easily 25
detected 25
when 25
they 25
are 25
presented 25
in 25
the 25
formal 25
manner 25
employed 25
by 25
the 25
schools 25
which 25
we 25
now 25
proceed 25
to 25
do 25
if 25
the 25
proposition 25
every 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
being 25
is 25
likewise 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
correct 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
this 25
which 25
constitutes 25
the 25
nervus 25
probandi 25
of 25
the 25
cosmological 25
argument 25
it 25
must 25
like 25
all 25
affirmative 25
judgements 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
conversionthe 25
conversio 25
per 25
accidens 25
at 25
least 25
it 25
follows 25
then 25
that 25
some 25
entia 25
realissima 25
are 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
beings 25
but 25
no 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
in 25
any 25
respect 25
different 25
from 25
another 25
and 25
what 25
is 25
valid 25
of 25
some 25
is 25
valid 25
of 25
all 25
in 25
this 25
present 25
case 25
therefore 25
i 25
may 25
employ 25
simple 25
conversion 25
and 25
say 25
every 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
is 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
but 25
as 25
this 25
proposition 25
is 25
determined 25
a 25
priori 25
by 25
the 25
conceptions 25
contained 25
in 25
it 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
must 25
possess 25
the 25
additional 25
attribute 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
exactly 25
what 25
was 25
maintained 25
in 25
the 25
ontological 25
argument 25
and 25
not 25
recognized 25
by 25
the 25
cosmological 25
although 25
it 25
formed 25
the 25
real 25
ground 25
of 25
its 25
disguised 25
and 25
illusory 25
reasoning 25
thus 25
the 25
second 25
mode 25
employed 25
by 25
speculative 25
reason 25
of 25
demonstrating 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
like 25
the 25
first 25
illusory 25
and 25
inadequate 25
but 25
possesses 25
the 25
additional 25
blemish 25
of 25
an 25
ignoratio 25
elenchiprofessing 25
to 25
conduct 25
us 25
by 25
a 25
new 25
road 25
to 25
the 25
desired 25
goal 25
but 25
bringing 25
us 25
back 25
after 25
a 25
short 25
circuit 25
to 25
the 25
old 25
path 25
which 25
we 25
had 25
deserted 25
at 25
its 25
call 25
i 25
mentioned 25
above 25
that 25
this 25
cosmological 25
argument 25
contains 25
a 25
perfect 25
nest 25
of 25
dialectical 25
assumptions 25
which 25
transcendental 25
criticism 25
does 25
not 25
find 25
it 25
difficult 25
to 25
expose 25
and 25
to 25
dissipate 25
i 25
shall 25
merely 25
enumerate 25
these 25
leaving 25
it 25
to 25
the 25
reader 25
who 25
must 25
by 25
this 25
time 25
be 25
well 25
practised 25
in 25
such 25
matters 25
to 25
investigate 25
the 25
fallacies 25
residing 25
therein 25
the 25
following 25
fallacies 25
for 25
example 25
are 25
discoverable 25
in 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
proof 25
the 25
transcendental 25
principle 25
everything 25
that 25
is 25
contingent 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
causea 25
principle 25
without 25
significance 25
except 25
in 25
the 25
sensuous 25
world 25
for 25
the 25
purely 25
intellectual 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
contingent 25
cannot 25
produce 25
any 25
synthetical 25
proposition 25
like 25
that 25
of 25
causality 25
which 25
is 25
itself 25
without 25
significance 25
or 25
distinguishing 25
characteristic 25
except 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
it 25
is 25
employed 25
to 25
help 25
us 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
its 25
sphere 25
from 25
the 25
impossibility 25
of 25
an 25
infinite 25
ascending 25
series 25
of 25
causes 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
a 25
first 25
cause 25
is 25
inferred 25
a 25
conclusion 25
which 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
do 25
not 25
justify 25
even 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
still 25
less 25
when 25
an 25
attempt 25
is 25
made 25
to 25
pass 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
this 25
sphere 25
reason 25
allows 25
itself 25
to 25
be 25
satisfied 25
upon 25
insufficient 25
grounds 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
completion 25
of 25
this 25
series 25
it 25
removes 25
all 25
conditions 25
without 25

a 25
completion 25

the 25

is 25
confounded 25
with 25
the 25
transcendental 25
which 25
requires 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
practicability 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
synthesisa 25
principle 25
which 25
again 25
refers 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
the 25
aim 25
of 25
the 25
cosmological 25
argument 25
is 25
to 25
avoid 25
the 25
necessity 25

proving 25

of 25
a 25

from 25
mere 25
conceptionsa 25
proof 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
ontological 25
and 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
feel 25
ourselves 25
quite 25
incapable 25
with 25
this 25
purpose 25
we 25
reason 25
from 25
an 25
actual 25
existencean 25
experience 25
in 25
general 25
to 25
an 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
condition 25
of 25
that 25
existence 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
unnecessary 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
its 25
possibility 25
for 25
after 25
having 25
proved 25
that 25
it 25
exists 25
the 25
question 25
regarding 25
its 25
possibility 25
is 25
superfluous 25
now 25
when 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
define 25
more 25
strictly 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
this 25
necessary 25
being 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
look 25
out 25
for 25
some 25
being 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
which 25
would 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
comprehend 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
its 25
beingfor 25
if 25
we 25
could 25
do 25
this 25
an 25
empirical 25
presupposition 25
would 25
be 25
unnecessary 25
no 25
we 25
try 25
to 25
discover 25
merely 25
the 25
negative 25
condition 25
conditio 25
sine 25
qua 25
non 25
without 25
which 25
a 25
being 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
now 25
this 25
would 25
be 25
perfectly 25
admissible 25
in 25
every 25
sort 25
of 25
reasoning 25
from 25
a 25
consequence 25
to 25
its 25
principle 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
it 25
unfortunately 25
happens 25
that 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
but 25
a 25
single 25
being 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
which 25
must 25
consequently 25
contain 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
requisite 25
for 25
demonstrating 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
and 25
thus 25
entitle 25
me 25
to 25
infer 25
this 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
possible 25
to 25
reason 25
conversely 25
and 25
say 25
the 25
thing 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25

absolutely 25

no 25

the 25

from 25
which 25
i 25

out 25
the 25

for 25
this 25

an 25

not 25
satisfy 25
the 25
question 25
regarding 25
its 25

was 25
the 25

although 25
the 25
existence 25

admitted 25
we 25

inference 25

form 25
any 25
conception 25

may 25
thus 25
be 25
obliged 25
to 25
admit 25
that 25
all 25
existing 25
things 25
have 25
a 25
necessary 25
basis 25
while 25
i 25
cannot 25
cogitate 25
any 25
single 25
or 25
individual 25
thing 25
as 25
necessary 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
i 25
can 25
never 25
complete 25
the 25
regress 25
through 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
existence 25
without 25
admitting 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25

cannot 25
make 25
a 25

i 25
must 25
cogitate 25
something 25

necessarily 25
as 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
existing 25
things 25

yet 25
am 25
not 25
permitted 25
to 25
cogitate 25
any 25
individual 25
thing 25
as 25
in 25
itself 25
necessary 25
the 25
inevitable 25
inference 25
is 25
that 25
necessity 25
and 25
contingency 25
are 25
not 25
properties 25
of 25
things 25
themselves 25
otherwise 25
an 25
internal 25
contradiction 25
would 25
result 25
that 25
consequently 25
neither 25
of 25
these 25
principles 25
are 25
objective 25
but 25
merely 25
subjective 25
principles 25
of 25
reasonthe 25

us 25

seek 25
for 25
a 25

ground 25
for 25
everything 25
that 25
exists 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
satisfied 25
with 25
no 25
other 25
explanation 25
than 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
complete 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
other 25
forbidding 25
us 25
ever 25
to 25
hope 25
for 25
the 25
attainment 25
of 25
this 25
completeness 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
regard 25
no 25
member 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
world 25
as 25
unconditioned 25

this 25
mode 25
of 25
viewing 25
them 25

principles 25
in 25
their 25
purely 25
heuristic 25
and 25
regulative 25
character 25
and 25
as 25
concerning 25
merely 25
the 25
formal 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
are 25
quite 25
consistent 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
the 25
one 25
says 25
you 25
must 25
philosophize 25
upon 25
nature 25
as 25
if 25
there 25
existed 25
a 25
necessary 25
primal 25
basis 25
of 25
all 25
existing 25
things 25
solely 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
introducing 25
systematic 25
unity 25
into 25
your 25
knowledge 25
by 25
pursuing 25
an 25
idea 25
of 25
this 25
charactera 25
foundation 25
which 25
is 25
arbitrarily 25
admitted 25
to 25
be 25
ultimate 25
while 25
the 25
other 25
warns 25
you 25
to 25
consider 25
no 25
individual 25
determination 25
concerning 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
such 25
an 25
ultimate 25
foundation 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
but 25
to 25
keep 25
the 25
way 25
always 25
open 25
for 25
further 25
progress 25
in 25
the 25
deduction 25
and 25
to 25
treat 25
every 25
determination 25
as 25
determined 25
by 25
some 25
other 25
but 25
if 25
all 25
that 25
we 25
perceive 25
must 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
conditionally 25
necessary 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
that 25
anything 25
which 25
is 25
empirically 25
given 25
should 25
be 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
it 25
follows 25
from 25
this 25
that 25
you 25
must 25
accept 25
the 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
as 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
world 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
useful 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
possible 25
unity 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
you 25
cannot 25
discover 25
any 25
such 25
necessary 25
existence 25
in 25
the 25
would 25
the 25
second 25
rule 25
requiring 25
you 25
to 25
regard 25
all 25
empirical 25
causes 25
of 25
unity 25
as 25
themselves 25
deduced 25
the 25
philosophers 25
of 25
antiquity 25
regarded 25
all 25
the 25
forms 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
contingent 25
while 25
matter 25
was 25
considered 25
by 25
them 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
judgement 25
of 25
the 25
common 25
reason 25
of 25
mankind 25
as 25
primal 25
and 25
necessary 25
but 25
if 25
they 25
had 25
regarded 25
matter 25
not 25
relativelyas 25
the 25
substratum 25
of 25
phenomena 25
but 25
absolutely 25
and 25
in 25
itselfas 25
an 25
independent 25
existence 25
this 25
idea 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
would 25
have 25
immediately 25
disappeared 25
for 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
absolutely 25
connecting 25
reason 25
with 25
such 25
an 25
existence 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
it 25
can 25
annihilate 25
it 25
in 25
thought 25
always 25
and 25
without 25
selfcontradiction 25
but 25
in 25
thought 25
alone 25
lay 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
must 25
therefore 25
have 25
been 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
this 25
opinion 25
in 25
fact 25
extension 25
and 25
impenetrabilitywhich 25
together 25
constitute 25
our 25
conception 25

the 25
supreme 25
empirical 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25

and 25
this 25
principle 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
empirically 25
unconditioned 25
possesses 25
the 25
property 25
of 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
but 25
as 25
every 25
determination 25

constitutes 25

real 25

consequently 25
impenetrabilityis 25
an 25
effect 25
which 25
must 25
have 25
a 25
cause 25

is 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
always 25
derived 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
matter 25
cannot 25
harmonize 25
with 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
in 25
its 25
character 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
all 25
derived 25
unity 25
for 25
every 25
one 25
of 25
its 25
real 25
properties 25
being 25
derived 25
must 25
be 25
only 25
conditionally 25
necessary 25
and 25
can 25
therefore 25
be 25
annihilated 25
in 25
thought 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
whole 25
existence 25
of 25
matter 25
can 25
be 25
so 25
annihilated 25
or 25
suppressed 25
if 25
this 25
were 25
not 25
the 25
case 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
the 25
highest 25
ground 25
or 25
condition 25
of 25
unitywhich 25
is 25
impossible 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
second 25
regulative 25
principle 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
matter 25
and 25
in 25
general 25
all 25
that 25
forms 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
cannot 25
be 25
a 25
necessary 25
primal 25
being 25
nor 25
even 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
empirical 25
unity 25
but 25
that 25
this 25
being 25

principle 25
must 25
have 25
its 25
place 25
assigned 25
without 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
we 25
can 25
proceed 25
in 25
perfect 25
confidence 25
to 25
deduce 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
world 25

their 25
existence 25
from 25
other 25
phenomena 25
just 25
as 25
if 25
there 25
existed 25
no 25
necessary 25
being 25

we 25
can 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
strive 25
without 25
ceasing 25
towards 25
the 25
attainment 25
of 25

for 25
our 25

if 25
such 25
a 25
beingthe 25
supreme 25
condition 25
of 25
all 25
existenceswere 25
presupposed 25
by 25
the 25

these 25
remarks 25
will 25
have 25
made 25
it 25
evident 25
to 25
the 25
reader 25
that 25
the 25
ideal 25
of 25

far 25
from 25
being 25
an 25

of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
in 25
itself 25
necessary 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
requiring 25
us 25
to 25
regard 25
all 25
connection 25
existing 25
between 25

its 25
origin 25
from 25
an 25
allsufficient 25
necessary 25

basing 25
upon 25
this 25
the 25
rule 25
of 25
a 25
systematic 25
and 25
necessary 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
explanation 25

we 25
cannot 25
at 25
the 25

time 25
avoid 25
regarding 25
by 25
a 25
transcendental 25
subreptio 25
this 25
formal 25
principle 25
as 25
constitutive 25
and 25
hypostatizing 25
this 25
unity 25
precisely 25
similar 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
our 25
notion 25
of 25
space 25
space 25
is 25
the 25
primal 25
condition 25

are 25
properly 25
just 25
so 25
many 25
different 25
limitations 25
of 25
it 25
and 25
thus 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
sensibility 25
we 25
cannot 25
help 25
regarding 25
it 25
as 25
an 25
absolutely 25

selfsubsistent 25

as 25

unity 25
of 25
nature 25
cannot 25
be 25
established 25
as 25

the 25
empirical 25

upon 25
the 25

an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
as 25
the 25

that 25

neither 25
a 25
pure 25
conception 25
nor 25
the 25
general 25
experience 25
of 25
an 25
existing 25
being 25
can 25
provide 25
a 25
sufficient 25
basis 25
for 25
the 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25

by 25
the 25
only 25
other 25

whether 25
we 25
can 25
thus 25
attain 25
to 25
a 25
sound 25
conviction 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25

this 25
argument 25
we 25
shall 25
term 25
the 25
physicotheological 25
argument 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
shown 25
to 25
be 25
insufficient 25
speculative 25
reason 25
cannot 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
any 25
satisfactory 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
corresponding 25
to 25
our 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
from 25
the 25
remarks 25
that 25
have 25
been 25
made 25
in 25
the 25
preceding 25
sections 25
that 25
an 25
answer 25
to 25
this 25

will 25
be 25
far 25
from 25
being 25
difficult 25
or 25
unconvincing 25
for 25
how 25
can 25
any 25
experience 25
be 25
adequate 25
with 25
an 25
idea 25
the 25
very 25
essence 25
of 25
an 25
idea 25
consists 25
in 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
no 25
experience 25
can 25
ever 25
be 25
discovered 25
congruent 25
or 25
adequate 25
with 25

in 25
the 25

nay 25
even 25

our 25
conception 25

an 25

that 25

us 25
we 25

itself 25

the 25
condition 25

which 25
we 25
find 25
it 25
we 25
are 25
constantly 25
referred 25
to 25
some 25
other 25
thing 25
which 25
itself 25
suggests 25
the 25

inquiry 25
regarding 25
its 25

the 25

sink 25
into 25
the 25
abyss 25
of 25
nothingness 25

that 25

contingencies 25
there 25

something 25

as 25
the 25

all 25
that 25
is 25
possible 25
this 25
we 25
can 25
easily 25
do 25
although 25
only 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
the 25
faint 25
outline 25
of 25
an 25
abstract 25
conception 25
by 25
representing 25
this 25

ourselves 25

an 25
individual 25
substance 25
all 25
possible 25

that 25
requirement 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
demands 25
parsimony 25
in 25
principles 25
which 25
is 25
free 25
from 25
selfcontradiction 25
which 25
even 25
contributes 25

the 25
extension 25
of 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25

afforded 25
by 25
this 25
idea 25
to 25
order 25
and 25
system 25
and 25
which 25
in 25
no 25
respect 25
conflicts 25
with 25
any 25
law 25
of 25
experience 25
this 25
argument 25
always 25
deserves 25
to 25
be 25
mentioned 25
with 25
respect 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
oldest 25
the 25
clearest 25
and 25
that 25
most 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
common 25
reason 25
of 25
humanity 25
it 25
animates 25
the 25
study 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
it 25
itself 25
derives 25
its 25
existence 25
and 25
draws 25
ever 25
new 25
strength 25
from 25
that 25
source 25
it 25
introduces 25
aims 25
and 25
ends 25
into 25
a 25
sphere 25
in 25
which 25
our 25
observation 25
could 25
not 25
of 25
itself 25
have 25
discovered 25
them 25
and 25
extends 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
nature 25
by 25
directing 25
our 25
attention 25
to 25
a 25
unity 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
which 25
lies 25
beyond 25
nature 25
this 25
knowledge 25
of 25
nature 25
again 25
reacts 25
upon 25
this 25
ideaits 25
cause 25
and 25
thus 25
our 25
belief 25
in 25
a 25
divine 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
rises 25
to 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
an 25
irresistible 25
conviction 25
for 25
these 25
reasons 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
utterly 25
hopeless 25
to 25
attempt 25
to 25
rob 25
this 25
argument 25
of 25
the 25
authority 25
it 25
has 25
always 25
enjoyed 25
the 25
mind 25
unceasingly 25
elevated 25
by 25
these 25
considerations 25
which 25
although 25
empirical 25
are 25
so 25
remarkably 25
powerful 25
and 25
continually 25
adding 25
to 25
their 25
force 25
will 25
not 25
suffer 25
itself 25
to 25
be 25
depressed 25
by 25
the 25
doubts 25
suggested 25
by 25
subtle 25
speculation 25
it 25
tears 25
itself 25
out 25
of 25
this 25
state 25
of 25
uncertainty 25
the 25
moment 25
it 25
casts 25
a 25
look 25
upon 25
the 25
wondrous 25
forms 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
the 25
majesty 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
and 25
rises 25
from 25
height 25
to 25
height 25
from 25
condition 25
to 25
condition 25
till 25
it 25
has 25
elevated 25
itself 25
to 25
the 25
supreme 25
and 25
unconditioned 25
author 25
of 25
all 25
but 25
although 25
we 25
have 25
nothing 25
to 25
object 25
to 25
the 25
reasonableness 25
and 25
utility 25
of 25
this 25
procedure 25
but 25
have 25
rather 25
to 25
commend 25
and 25
encourage 25
it 25
we 25
cannot 25
approve 25
of 25
the 25
claims 25
which 25
this 25
argument 25
advances 25
to 25
demonstrative 25
certainty 25
and 25
to 25
a 25
reception 25
upon 25
its 25
own 25
merits 25
apart 25
from 25
favour 25
or 25
support 25
by 25
other 25
arguments 25
nor 25
can 25
it 25
injure 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
morality 25
to 25
endeavour 25
to 25
lower 25
the 25
tone 25
of 25
the 25
arrogant 25
sophist 25
and 25
to 25
teach 25
him 25
that 25
modesty 25
and 25
moderation 25
which 25
are 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
a 25
belief 25
that 25
brings 25
calm 25
and 25
content 25
into 25
the 25
mind 25
without 25
prescribing 25
to 25
it 25
an 25
unworthy 25
subjection 25
i 25
maintain 25
then 25
that 25
the 25
physicotheological 25
argument 25
is 25
insufficient 25
of 25
itself 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
that 25
it 25
must 25
entrust 25
this 25
to 25
the 25
ontological 25
argumentto 25
which 25
it 25
serves 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25
introduction 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
this 25
argument 25
contains 25
the 25
only 25
possible 25
ground 25
of 25
proof 25
possessed 25
by 25
speculative 25
reason 25
for 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
this 25
being 25
the 25
chief 25
momenta 25
in 25
the 25
physicotheological 25
argument 25
are 25
as 25
follow 25
we 25
observe 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
manifest 25
signs 25
of 25
an 25
arrangement 25
full 25
of 25
purpose 25
executed 25
with 25
great 25
wisdom 25
and 25

in 25
whole 25
of 25
a 25
content 25
indescribably 25
various 25
and 25
of 25
an 25
extent 25
without 25
limits 25
this 25
arrangement 25
of 25
means 25
and 25

is 25
entirely 25
foreign 25
to 25

completely 25

reason 25

be 25
unable 25

the 25
physicotheological 25
argument 25
the 25
connection 25

harmony 25
existing 25
in 25
the 25

evidence 25
the 25

the 25

merely 25

not 25

that 25

of 25
the 25
substance 25
of 25
the 25

to 25
establish 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
opinion 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
necessary 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
all 25
things 25
would 25
be 25
in 25
themselves 25
incapable 25
of 25
this 25
harmony 25

the 25
product 25

a 25
supreme 25

this 25
would 25
require 25
very 25
different 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
from 25
those 25
presented 25
by 25
the 25
analogy 25
with 25
human 25
art 25
this 25
proof 25
can 25
at 25
most 25
therefore 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
architect 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
whose 25
efforts 25
are 25
limited 25
by 25
the 25
capabilities 25
of 25
the 25
material 25
with 25
which 25
he 25
works 25
but 25
not 25
of 25
a 25
creator 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
to 25
whom 25
all 25
things 25
are 25
subject 25
thus 25
this 25
argument 25
is 25
utterly 25
insufficient 25

the 25

we 25
must 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
a 25
transcendental 25
argument 25
which 25
the 25
physicotheological 25

constructed 25
expressly 25
to 25

the 25

in 25
its 25

this 25
is 25
merely 25
the 25
ontological 25
argument 25
in 25
disguise 25
it 25
executes 25
its 25

solely 25

the 25

pure 25

therefore 25
no 25

only 25
as 25
immanent 25
in 25

while 25
the 25

now 25
perfectly 25
evident 25
that 25
transcendental 25
questions 25
admit 25
only 25
of 25
transcendental 25

presented 25

by 25
pure 25
conceptions 25
without 25
the 25
least 25
empirical 25
admixture 25
but 25
the 25
question 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
is 25
evidently 25
syntheticalit 25
aims 25
at 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
beyond 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
experienceit 25
requires 25
an 25
assurance 25
respecting 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
corresponding 25
with 25
the 25
idea 25
in 25
our 25
minds 25
to 25
which 25
no 25
experience 25
can 25
ever 25
be 25
adequate 25
now 25
it 25
has 25
been 25
abundantly 25
proved 25
that 25
all 25
a 25
priori 25
synthetical 25
cognition 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
as 25
the 25
expression 25
of 25
the 25
formal 25
conditions 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
all 25
principles 25
depends 25
upon 25
their 25
immanence 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
that 25
is 25
their 25
relation 25
to 25

thus 25
all 25
transcendental 25
procedure 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
speculative 25
theology 25
is 25
without 25
result 25
if 25
any 25
one 25
prefers 25
doubting 25

conclusiveness 25
of 25

i 25
request 25
him 25
to 25
spare 25
me 25
there 25
is 25
certainly 25
no 25
great 25
choice 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
discussion 25
as 25
all 25
speculative 25
arguments 25
must 25
at 25
last 25
look 25
for 25
support 25
to 25
the 25
ontological 25
and 25
i 25
have 25
therefore 25
very 25
little 25
to 25
fear 25
from 25
the 25
argumentative 25
fecundity 25
of 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
defenders 25
of 25
a 25
nonsensuous 25
reason 25
without 25
looking 25
upon 25
myself 25
as 25
a 25
remarkably 25
combative 25
person 25
i 25
shall 25
not 25
decline 25
the 25
challenge 25
to 25
detect 25
the 25
fallacy 25
and 25
destroy 25
the 25
pretensions 25
of 25
every 25
attempt 25
of 25
speculative 25
theology 25
and 25
yet 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
better 25
fortune 25
never 25

those 25
who 25
are 25
accustomed 25
to 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
mode 25

i 25
shall 25
therefore 25
restrict 25
myself 25
to 25
the 25
simple 25
and 25
equitable 25
demand 25
that 25
such 25
reasoners 25
will 25
demonstrate 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
sources 25
of 25
knowledge 25
how 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
proceed 25
to 25
extend 25
our 25
cognition 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
to 25
carry 25
it 25
to 25
that 25
point 25
where 25

abandons 25
us 25
and 25
no 25
means 25

of 25
guaranteeing 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
our 25
conceptions 25
in 25
whatever 25
way 25
the 25
understanding 25
may 25
have 25
attained 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
cannot 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
it 25
by 25
analysis 25
because 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
depends 25
upon 25
the 25

posited 25
and 25
given 25
in 25
itself 25
apart 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
utterly 25
impossible 25
to 25
go 25
beyond 25
our 25
conception 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experiencewhich 25
presents 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
nothing 25
but 25
phenomena 25
or 25
to 25
attain 25
by 25
the 25
help 25
of 25
mere 25
conceptions 25
to 25
a 25
conviction 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
new 25
kinds 25
of 25
objects 25
or 25
supernatural 25
beings 25
but 25
although 25
pure 25
speculative 25
reason 25
is 25
far 25
from 25
sufficient 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
it 25
is 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
utility 25
in 25
correcting 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
this 25
beingon 25
the 25
supposition 25
that 25
we 25
can 25

anthropomorphic 25
this 25
is 25
of 25
course 25
very 25
easy 25
as 25
the 25
same 25
arguments 25
which 25
demonstrated 25
the 25
inability 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
to 25
affirm 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
must 25
be 25
alike 25
sufficient 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
invalidity 25
of 25
its 25
denial 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
gain 25
from 25
the 25
pure 25
speculation 25
of 25
reason 25
demonstration 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
no 25
supreme 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
exists 25
or 25
that 25
this 25
being 25
possesses 25
none 25
of 25
those 25
properties 25
which 25
we 25
regard 25
as 25
analogical 25
with 25
the 25
dynamical 25
qualities 25
of 25
a 25
thinking 25
being 25
or 25
that 25
as 25
the 25
anthropomorphists 25
would 25
have 25
us 25
believe 25
it 25
is 25
subject 25
to 25
all 25
the 25
limitations 25
which 25
sensibility 25
imposes 25
upon 25
those 25
intelligences 25
which 25
exist 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
is 25
therefore 25
for 25
the 25
speculative 25
reason 25
a 25
mere 25
ideal 25
though 25
a 25
faultless 25
onea 25
conception 25
which 25
perfects 25
and 25
crowns 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
human 25
cognition 25
but 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
which 25
can 25
neither 25
be 25
proved 25
nor 25
disproved 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
if 25
this 25
defect 25
is 25
ever 25
supplied 25
by 25
a 25
moral 25
theology 25
the 25
problematic 25
transcendental 25
theology 25
which 25
has 25
preceded 25
will 25
have 25
been 25
at 25
least 25
serviceable 25
as 25
demonstrating 25
the 25
mental 25
necessity 25
existing 25
for 25
the 25
conception 25
by 25
the 25
complete 25
determination 25
of 25
it 25
which 25
it 25
has 25
furnished 25
and 25
the 25
ceaseless 25
testing 25
of 25
the 25
conclusions 25
of 25
a 25

the 25
accurate 25

appendix 25
of 25
the 25
regulative 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
the 25
result 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
dialectical 25
attempts 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
not 25
only 25
confirms 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
what 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
proved 25
in 25
our 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
namely 25
that 25
all 25
inferences 25
which 25
would 25
lead 25
us 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
are 25
fallacious 25
and 25
groundless 25
but 25
it 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
teaches 25
us 25
this 25
important 25
lesson 25
that 25
human 25
reason 25
has 25
a 25
natural 25
inclination 25
to 25
overstep 25
these 25
limits 25
and 25
that 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
are 25
as 25
much 25
the 25
natural 25
property 25
of 25
the 25
reason 25
as 25
categories 25
are 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
there 25
exists 25
this 25
difference 25
however 25
that 25
while 25
the 25
categories 25
never 25
mislead 25
us 25
outward 25
objects 25
being 25
always 25
in 25
perfect 25
harmony 25
therewith 25
ideas 25
are 25
the 25
parents 25
of 25
irresistible 25
illusions 25
the 25
severest 25
and 25
most 25
subtle 25
criticism 25
being 25
required 25
to 25
save 25
us 25
from 25
the 25
fallacies 25
which 25
they 25
induce 25
whatever 25
is 25
grounded 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
powers 25
will 25
be 25
found 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25
the 25
final 25
purpose 25
and 25
proper 25
employment 25
of 25
these 25
powers 25
when 25
once 25
we 25
have 25
discovered 25
their 25
true 25
direction 25
and 25
aim 25
we 25
are 25
entitled 25
to 25
suppose 25
therefore 25
that 25
there 25
exists 25
a 25
mode 25
of 25
employing 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
which 25
is 25
proper 25
and 25
immanent 25
although 25
when 25
we 25
mistake 25
their 25
meaning 25
and 25
regard 25
them 25
as 25
conceptions 25
of 25
actual 25
things 25
their 25
mode 25
of 25
application 25
is 25
transcendent 25
and 25
delusive 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
idea 25
itself 25
but 25
only 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
idea 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
that 25
is 25
transcendent 25
or 25
immanent 25
an 25
idea 25
is 25
employed 25
transcendently 25
when 25
it 25
is 25
applied 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
falsely 25
believed 25
to 25
be 25
adequate 25
with 25
and 25
to 25
correspond 25
to 25
it 25
imminently 25
when 25
it 25
is 25
applied 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
thus 25
all 25
errors 25
of 25
subreptioof 25

are 25
to 25
be 25
ascribed 25
to 25
defects 25
of 25
judgement 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
understanding 25

reason 25
never 25
has 25
an 25

it 25
relates 25

the 25

only 25
through 25
the 25

that 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
employed 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
form 25
conceptions 25
of 25
objects 25
it 25
merely 25
arranges 25
them 25
and 25
gives 25
to 25
them 25
that 25
unity 25
which 25
they 25
are 25
capable 25
of 25
possessing 25
when 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
their 25
application 25
has 25
been 25
extended 25
as 25
widely 25
as 25
possible 25
reason 25
avails 25
itself 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
for 25
the 25
sole 25
purpose 25
of 25
producing 25
totality 25
in 25
the 25

this 25
totality 25
the 25
understanding 25

not 25
concern 25
itself 25
with 25
its 25
only 25
occupation 25
is 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25

by 25
which 25

with 25
conceptions 25
are 25
established 25
the 25
object 25
of 25

therefore 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
its 25
proper 25
destination 25
as 25
the 25
latter 25
brings 25
unity 25
into 25
the 25
diversity 25
of 25
objects 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
its 25
conceptions 25
so 25
the 25
former 25
brings 25
unity 25
into 25
the 25
diversity 25
of 25
conceptions 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
ideas 25
as 25
it 25
sets 25
the 25
final 25
aim 25
of 25
a 25
collective 25
unity 25
to 25
the 25
operations 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
without 25
this 25
occupies 25
itself 25
with 25
a 25
distributive 25
unity 25
alone 25
i 25
accordingly 25
maintain 25
that 25
transcendental 25
ideas 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
employed 25
as 25
constitutive 25
ideas 25
that 25
they 25
cannot 25

that 25
when 25

on 25
the 25

with 25

hence 25
arises 25
the 25
natural 25
illusion 25

induces 25
us 25
to 25
believe 25
that 25
these 25

proceed 25
from 25
an 25

necessary 25

unavoidable 25

we 25
desire 25
to 25
see 25
not 25
only 25
those 25
objects 25
which 25
lie 25
before 25
us 25
but 25
those 25
which 25
are 25
at 25
a 25
great 25
distance 25
behind 25
us 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
when 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
we 25
direct 25
the 25
aims 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
beyond 25
every 25
given 25
experience 25
towards 25
an 25
extension 25
as 25
great 25
as 25
can 25
possibly 25
be 25
attained 25
if 25
we 25
review 25
our 25
cognitions 25
in 25
their 25
entire 25
extent 25
we 25
shall 25
find 25
that 25
the 25
peculiar 25
business 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
to 25
arrange 25
them 25
into 25
a 25
system 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
to 25
give 25
them 25
connection 25
according 25
to 25
a 25
principle 25
this 25
unity 25
presupposes 25
an 25
ideathe 25
idea 25
of 25

the 25
parts 25

the 25
other 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
system 25
this 25
idea 25
accordingly 25
demands 25
complete 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
understandingnot 25
the 25
unity 25

that 25
of 25
a 25
system 25
connected 25

to 25
necessary 25
laws 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
affirmed 25
with 25
propriety 25
that 25
this 25
idea 25
is 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25

available 25
to 25
the 25

so 25
long 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
adequate 25
to 25
them 25
we 25
admit 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
thing 25
as 25
pure 25

pure 25
water 25

pure 25

is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
discovered 25
and 25
yet 25
we 25
require 25
these 25
conceptions 25
which 25
have 25
their 25
origin 25
in 25
the 25
reason 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
regards 25
their 25
absolute 25
purity 25
and 25
completeness 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
determining 25
the 25

which 25
each 25
of 25
these 25
natural 25
causes 25
has 25
in 25
every 25
phenomenon 25
thus 25
the 25
different 25
kinds 25
of 25

are 25
all 25
referred 25
to 25
earths 25
as 25
mere 25

to 25
salts 25

as 25
pure 25

finally 25

very 25
observable 25
in 25
the 25

its 25
sole 25

the 25

that 25
this 25

all 25

under 25
one 25

thus 25
to 25
ensure 25
the 25
most 25
complete 25
consistency 25

connection 25
that 25

the 25

which 25
they 25

cognized 25

so 25
constituted 25
as 25
to 25
be 25
determined 25
to 25
systematic 25
unity 25
that 25
this 25
may 25

without 25
any 25
reference 25
to 25
the 25

founded 25
only 25
upon 25
a 25
transcendental 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
would 25
render 25
this 25
systematic 25

not 25
subjectively 25

logicallyin 25
its 25
character 25

a 25
method 25

objectively 25
necessary 25

an 25
example 25
the 25

us 25
acquainted 25
among 25
many 25
other 25
kinds 25
of 25
unity 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
causality 25
of 25
a 25

different 25
phenomenal 25

at 25
first 25
view 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
very 25
dissimilar 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
inclined 25
to 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
just 25
as 25
many 25
different 25
powers 25
as 25
there 25
are 25
different 25

in 25
the 25
case 25

the 25
human 25

desire 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
now 25
we 25
are 25
required 25
by 25
a 25
logical 25
maxim 25
to 25
reduce 25
these 25
differences 25
to 25
as 25
small 25
a 25
number 25
as 25
possible 25
by 25
comparing 25
them 25
and 25
discovering 25
the 25
hidden 25
identity 25
which 25
exists 25
we 25
must 25
inquire 25
for 25
example 25
whether 25
or 25
not 25
imagination 25
connected 25
with 25
consciousness 25

not 25
merely 25
different 25
forms 25
of 25

the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
fundamental 25
power 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
which 25
no 25
effort 25
of 25
logic 25
can 25
assure 25
us 25
of 25
is 25
the 25
problem 25
to 25
be 25
solved 25
for 25
the 25
systematic 25
representation 25
of 25
the 25
existing 25
variety 25
of 25
powers 25
the 25
logical 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
requires 25
us 25
to 25
produce 25
as 25
great 25
a 25
unity 25
as 25
is 25
possible 25
in 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
and 25
the 25
more 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
this 25
and 25
the 25
other 25
power 25
are 25
found 25
to 25
be 25
identical 25
the 25
more 25
probable 25
does 25
it 25
become 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
different 25
manifestations 25
of 25
one 25
and 25
the 25
same 25
power 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
called 25
relatively 25
speaking 25
a 25
fundamental 25
power 25
and 25
so 25
with 25
other 25
cases 25
these 25
relatively 25
fundamental 25
powers 25
must 25
again 25
be 25
compared 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
to 25
discover 25
if 25
possible 25
the 25
one 25
radical 25
and 25
absolutely 25
fundamental 25
power 25
of 25
which 25
they 25
are 25
but 25
the 25
manifestations 25
but 25
this 25
unity 25
is 25
purely 25
hypothetical 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
maintained 25
that 25
this 25
unity 25
does 25
really 25
exist 25
but 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
in 25
the 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
that 25
is 25
for 25
the 25
establishment 25
of 25
principles 25
for 25
the 25
various 25
rules 25
presented 25
by 25
experience 25
try 25
to 25
discover 25
and 25
introduce 25
it 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
is 25
practicable 25
into 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
but 25
the 25
transcendental 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
would 25
lead 25
us 25
to 25
believe 25
that 25
this 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
fundamental 25
power 25
is 25
not 25
problematical 25
but 25
that 25
it 25
possesses 25
objective 25
reality 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
various 25
powers 25
or 25
forces 25
in 25
a 25
substance 25
is 25
demanded 25
by 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
erected 25
into 25
an 25
apodeictic 25
or 25
necessary 25
principle 25
for 25
without 25
having 25
attempted 25
to 25
discover 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
various 25
powers 25
existing 25
in 25
nature 25
nay 25
even 25
after 25
all 25
our 25
attempts 25
have 25
failed 25
we 25
notwithstanding 25
presuppose 25
that 25
it 25
does 25
exist 25
and 25
may 25
be 25
sooner 25
or 25
later 25
discovered 25
and 25
this 25
reason 25
does 25
not 25
only 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
above 25
adduced 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
substance 25
but 25
where 25
many 25
substances 25
although 25
all 25
to 25
a 25
certain 25
extent 25
homogeneous 25
are 25
discoverable 25
as 25

in 25
the 25
establishment 25
of 25
this 25

that 25

a 25

fundamental 25
properties 25

the 25
aforesaid 25
variety 25
is 25

a 25
more 25
or 25
less 25
determined 25
form 25
this 25
unity 25
although 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
thinkers 25
have 25
found 25
it 25
necessary 25
rather 25
to 25
moderate 25
the 25
desire 25
than 25
to 25
encourage 25
it 25
it 25
was 25
considered 25
a 25
great 25
step 25
when 25
chemists 25
were 25
able 25
to 25
reduce 25
all 25
salts 25
to 25
two 25
main 25
generaacids 25

alkalis 25

they 25
regard 25
this 25
difference 25
as 25
itself 25
a 25
mere 25
variety 25

different 25
manifestation 25

one 25

kinds 25
of 25
earths 25

metals 25
chemists 25
have 25
endeavoured 25
to 25
reduce 25
to 25
three 25
and 25
afterwards 25
to 25
two 25
but 25
still 25
not 25
content 25
with 25
this 25
advance 25
they 25
cannot 25
but 25
think 25
that 25
behind 25
these 25
diversities 25
there 25
lurks 25
but 25
one 25
genusnay 25
that 25
even 25
salts 25
and 25
earths 25
have 25
a 25
common 25
principle 25
it 25
might 25
be 25
conjectured 25
that 25
this 25
is 25
merely 25
an 25
economical 25
plan 25
of 25
reason 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
sparing 25
itself 25
trouble 25
and 25
an 25
attempt 25
of 25
a 25
purely 25
hypothetical 25
character 25
which 25
when 25
successful 25
gives 25
an 25
appearance 25
of 25
probability 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
explanation 25
employed 25
by 25
the 25
reason 25
but 25
a 25
selfish 25
purpose 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
is 25
easily 25
to 25
be 25
distinguished 25
from 25
the 25
idea 25
according 25
to 25
which 25
every 25
one 25
presupposes 25
that 25
this 25
unity 25
is 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
that 25

does 25
not 25

this 25
case 25
request 25
but 25
requires 25

we 25
are 25
quite 25
unable 25

in 25
the 25

hence 25

contain 25
a 25

always 25
a 25

upon 25
a 25

certainly 25

not 25
require 25
that 25
the 25

of 25
a 25
conception 25
in 25

does 25
not 25
authorize 25
this 25
statement 25
while 25
it 25
does 25
impose 25

we 25
may 25
illustrate 25
the 25

produced 25
by 25
the 25
three 25
logical 25
principles 25
in 25
the 25

manner 25
every 25

a 25
point 25
which 25
as 25
the 25
standpoint 25
of 25
a 25
spectator 25
has 25
a 25
certain 25
horizon 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
said 25
to 25
enclose 25
a 25
number 25
of 25
things 25
that 25
may 25
be 25

so 25
to 25
speak 25
from 25
that 25
centre 25
within 25
this 25
horizon 25
there 25
must 25
be 25
an 25
infinite 25
number 25
of 25
other 25
points 25

of 25
which 25
has 25
its 25
own 25

more 25
circumscribed 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
every 25
species 25
contains 25
subspecies 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
specification 25
and 25
the 25
logical 25
horizon 25
consists 25
of 25
smaller 25
horizons 25

but 25
not 25
of 25

individuals 25
which 25
possess 25
no 25

but 25
different 25
horizons 25
or 25
genera 25
which 25
include 25
under 25
them 25
so 25
many 25
conceptions 25
may 25
have 25
one 25
common 25
horizon 25
from 25
which 25
as 25
from 25
a 25
midpoint 25
they 25
may 25
be 25
surveyed 25
and 25
we 25
may 25
proceed 25
thus 25
till 25
we 25
arrive 25
at 25
the 25
highest 25
genus 25
or 25
universal 25
and 25
true 25
horizon 25
which 25
is 25
determined 25
by 25
the 25
highest 25
conception 25

which 25
contains 25
under 25
itself 25
all 25

this 25

the 25
law 25

now 25
as 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
there 25
exists 25
no 25

in 25
the 25
whole 25

these 25
the 25

nothing 25
there 25

the 25
presupposition 25
of 25
the 25
universal 25

above 25
mentioned 25
and 25
its 25
complete 25
division 25
the 25
principle 25
non 25
datur 25
vacuum 25
formarum 25
this 25
principle 25
asserts 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
not 25
different 25
primitive 25
and 25
highest 25
genera 25
which 25
stand 25
isolated 25
so 25
to 25
speak 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
but 25
all 25
the 25
various 25
genera 25
are 25
mere 25
divisions 25
and 25
limitations 25
of 25
one 25
highest 25
and 25
universal 25
genus 25
and 25
hence 25
follows 25
immediately 25
the 25
principle 25
datur 25
continuum 25
formarum 25
this 25
principle 25
indicates 25
that 25
all 25
differences 25
of 25
species 25
limit 25
each 25
other 25
and 25
do 25
not 25
admit 25
of 25
transition 25
from 25
one 25
to 25
another 25
by 25
a 25
saltus 25
but 25
only 25
through 25
smaller 25
degrees 25
of 25
the 25
difference 25
between 25
the 25
one 25
species 25
and 25
the 25
other 25
in 25
one 25
word 25
there 25
are 25
no 25
species 25
or 25
subspecies 25
which 25
in 25
the 25
view 25
of 25
reason 25
are 25
the 25
nearest 25
possible 25
to 25
each 25
other 25
intermediate 25
species 25
or 25
subspecies 25
being 25
always 25
possible 25
the 25
difference 25
of 25
which 25
from 25
each 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
always 25
smaller 25
than 25
the 25
difference 25
existing 25
between 25
these 25
the 25
first 25
law 25
therefore 25
directs 25
us 25
to 25
avoid 25
the 25
notion 25
that 25
there 25
exist 25
different 25
primal 25
genera 25
and 25
enounces 25
the 25
fact 25
of 25
perfect 25
homogeneity 25
the 25
second 25
imposes 25
a 25
check 25
upon 25
this 25
tendency 25
to 25
unity 25
and 25
prescribes 25
the 25
distinction 25
of 25
subspecies 25
before 25
proceeding 25
to 25
apply 25
our 25
general 25
conceptions 25
to 25
individuals 25
the 25
third 25
unites 25
both 25
the 25
former 25
by 25
enouncing 25
the 25
fact 25
of 25
homogeneity 25
as 25
existing 25
even 25
in 25
the 25
most 25
various 25
diversity 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
gradual 25
transition 25
from 25
one 25
species 25
to 25
another 25
thus 25
it 25
indicates 25
a 25
relationship 25
between 25
the 25
different 25
branches 25
or 25
species 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
they 25
all 25
spring 25
from 25
the 25
same 25
stem 25
but 25
this 25
logical 25
law 25
of 25
the 25
continuum 25
specierum 25
formarum 25
logicarum 25
presupposes 25
a 25
transcendental 25
principle 25
lex 25
continui 25
in 25
natura 25
without 25
which 25
the 25
understanding 25
might 25
be 25
led 25
into 25
error 25
by 25
following 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
and 25
thus 25
perhaps 25
pursuing 25
a 25
path 25
contrary 25
to 25
that 25
prescribed 25
by 25
nature 25
this 25
law 25
must 25
consequently 25
be 25
based 25
upon 25
pure 25
transcendental 25
and 25
not 25
upon 25
empirical 25
considerations 25
for 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
case 25
it 25
would 25
come 25
later 25
than 25
the 25
system 25
whereas 25
it 25
is 25
really 25
itself 25
the 25
parent 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
is 25
systematic 25
in 25
our 25
cognition 25
of 25
nature 25
these 25
principles 25
are 25
not 25
mere 25
hypotheses 25
employed 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
experimenting 25
upon 25
nature 25
although 25
when 25
any 25
such 25
connection 25
is 25
discovered 25
it 25
forms 25
a 25
solid 25
ground 25
for 25
regarding 25
the 25
hypothetical 25
unity 25
as 25
valid 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
natureand 25
thus 25
they 25
are 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
not 25
without 25
their 25
use 25
but 25
we 25
go 25
farther 25
and 25
maintain 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
manifest 25
that 25
these 25
principles 25
of 25
parsimony 25
in 25
fundamental 25
causes 25
variety 25
in 25
effects 25
and 25
affinity 25
in 25
phenomena 25
are 25
in 25
accordance 25
both 25
with 25
reason 25
and 25
nature 25
and 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
mere 25
methods 25
or 25
plans 25
devised 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
assisting 25
us 25
in 25
our 25
observation 25
of 25
the 25
external 25
world 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
plain 25
that 25
this 25
continuity 25
of 25
forms 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
to 25
which 25
no 25
adequate 25
object 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
this 25
for 25
two 25
reasons 25
first 25
because 25
the 25
species 25
in 25
nature 25
are 25
really 25
divided 25
and 25
hence 25
form 25
quanta 25
discreta 25
and 25
if 25
the 25
gradual 25
progression 25
through 25
their 25
affinity 25
were 25
continuous 25
the 25
intermediate 25
members 25
lying 25
between 25
two 25
given 25
species 25
must 25
be 25
infinite 25
in 25
number 25
which 25
is 25
impossible 25
secondly 25
because 25
we 25
cannot 25
make 25
any 25
determinate 25
empirical 25
use 25
of 25
this 25
law 25
inasmuch 25
as 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
present 25
us 25
with 25
any 25
criterion 25
of 25
affinity 25
which 25
could 25
aid 25
us 25
in 25
determining 25
how 25
far 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
pursue 25
the 25
graduation 25
of 25
differences 25
it 25
merely 25
contains 25
a 25
general 25
indication 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
our 25
duty 25
to 25
seek 25
for 25
and 25
if 25
possible 25
to 25
discover 25
them 25
when 25
we 25
arrange 25
these 25
principles 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
order 25
conformable 25
to 25
their 25
employment 25
in 25
experience 25
they 25
will 25
stand 25
thus 25
variety 25
affinity 25
unity 25
each 25
of 25
them 25
as 25
ideas 25
being 25
taken 25
in 25
the 25
highest 25
degree 25
of 25
their 25
completeness 25
reason 25
presupposes 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
cognitions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
have 25
a 25
direct 25
relation 25
to 25
experience 25
and 25
aims 25
at 25
the 25
ideal 25
unity 25
of 25
these 25
cognitionsa 25
unity 25
which 25
far 25
transcends 25
all 25
experience 25
or 25
empirical 25
notions 25
the 25
affinity 25
of 25
the 25
diverse 25
notwithstanding 25
the 25
differences 25
existing 25
between 25
its 25
parts 25
has 25
a 25
relation 25
to 25
things 25
but 25
a 25
still 25
closer 25
one 25
to 25
the 25
mere 25
properties 25
and 25
powers 25
of 25
things 25
for 25
example 25
imperfect 25
experience 25
may 25
represent 25
the 25
orbits 25
of 25
the 25
planets 25
as 25
circular 25
but 25
we 25
discover 25
variations 25
from 25
this 25
course 25
and 25
we 25
proceed 25
to 25
suppose 25
that 25
the 25
planets 25
revolve 25
in 25
a 25
path 25
which 25
if 25
not 25
a 25
circle 25
is 25
of 25
a 25
character 25
very 25
similar 25
to 25
it 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
movements 25
of 25
those 25
planets 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
form 25
a 25
circle 25
will 25
approximate 25
more 25
or 25
less 25
to 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
a 25
circle 25
and 25
probably 25
form 25
an 25
ellipse 25
the 25
paths 25
of 25
comets 25
exhibit 25
still 25
greater 25
variations 25
for 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
our 25
observation 25
extends 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
return 25
upon 25
their 25
own 25
course 25
in 25
a 25
circle 25
or 25
ellipse 25
but 25
we 25
proceed 25
to 25
the 25
conjecture 25
that 25
comets 25
describe 25
a 25
parabola 25
a 25
figure 25
which 25
is 25
closely 25
allied 25
to 25
the 25
ellipse 25
in 25
fact 25
a 25
parabola 25
is 25
merely 25
an 25
ellipse 25
with 25
its 25
longer 25
axis 25
produced 25
to 25
an 25
indefinite 25
extent 25
thus 25
these 25
principles 25
conduct 25
us 25
to 25
a 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
genera 25
of 25
the 25
forms 25
of 25
these 25
orbits 25
and 25
proceeding 25
farther 25
to 25
a 25
unity 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
motions 25
of 25
the 25
heavenly 25
bodiesthat 25
is 25
gravitation 25
but 25
we 25
go 25
on 25
extending 25
our 25
conquests 25
over 25
nature 25
and 25
endeavour 25
to 25
explain 25
all 25
seeming 25
deviations 25
from 25
these 25
rules 25
and 25
even 25
make 25
additions 25
to 25
our 25
system 25
which 25
no 25
experience 25
can 25
ever 25
substantiatefor 25

the 25
theory 25
in 25
affinity 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
ellipses 25
of 25
hyperbolic 25
paths 25
of 25
comets 25
pursuing 25
which 25
these 25
bodies 25
leave 25

solar 25
system 25
and 25
passing 25
from 25

to 25

the 25
most 25
distant 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25

is 25

together 25
by 25

the 25
most 25
remarkable 25
circumstance 25
connected 25
with 25
these 25
principles 25
is 25
that 25
they 25
seem 25
to 25
be 25
transcendental 25
and 25

all 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25

there 25
must 25
be 25
some 25
analogon 25
of 25
this 25
schema 25
this 25
analogon 25
is 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
maximum 25
of 25
the 25
division 25
and 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
in 25
one 25
principle 25
for 25
we 25
may 25
have 25
a 25
determinate 25
notion 25
of 25
a 25
maximum 25
and 25
an 25
absolutely 25
perfect 25

restrictive 25
conditions 25

are 25

with 25
an 25
indeterminate 25
and 25
various 25
content 25
having 25
been 25
abstracted 25
thus 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
analogous 25
with 25
a 25
sensuous 25
schema 25
with 25
this 25
difference 25
that 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
to 25
the 25
schema 25

not 25
present 25
a 25
cognition 25
of 25
any 25
object 25
as 25
is 25
the 25
case 25

the 25
application 25
of 25
the 25
categories 25
to 25
sensuous 25
schemata 25
but 25
merely 25
provides 25
us 25
with 25
a 25
rule 25

principle 25
for 25

systematic 25

principles 25

i 25
observe 25
intelligent 25

disputing 25
about 25

assuming 25
the 25
existence 25

welldefined 25

hereditary 25
distinctions 25
of 25

so 25
on 25
while 25
the 25
other 25
side 25
maintain 25
that 25
nature 25
has 25
endowed 25
all 25
races 25
of 25
men 25
with 25
the 25

the 25
result 25
of 25
external 25

accidental 25
circumstancesi 25
have 25
only 25
to 25
consider 25
for 25
a 25
moment 25
the 25
real 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
discussion 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
the 25
conclusion 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
subject 25
far 25
too 25
deep 25
for 25
us 25
to 25
judge 25
of 25
and 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
little 25
probability 25
of 25
either 25
party 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
speak 25
from 25
a 25
perfect 25
insight 25
into 25
and 25
understanding 25
of 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
subject 25
itself 25
both 25
have 25
in 25
reality 25
been 25
struggling 25
for 25
the 25
twofold 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
the 25
one 25
maintaining 25
the 25
one 25
interest 25
the 25
other 25
the 25
other 25
but 25
this 25
difference 25
between 25
the 25
maxims 25
of 25
diversity 25
and 25
unity 25
may 25
easily 25
be 25
reconciled 25
and 25
adjusted 25
although 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
regarded 25
as 25
objective 25
principles 25
they 25
must 25
occasion 25
not 25
only 25
contradictions 25
and 25
polemic 25
but 25
place 25
hinderances 25
in 25
the 25
way 25
of 25
the 25
advancement 25
of 25
truth 25
until 25
some 25
means 25
is 25
discovered 25
of 25
reconciling 25
these 25
conflicting 25
interests 25
and 25
bringing 25
reason 25
into 25
union 25
and 25
harmony 25
with 25
itself 25
the 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
socalled 25
law 25
discovered 25
by 25
leibnitz 25

of 25
the 25
continuous 25
gradation 25
of 25
created 25

which 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
inference 25
from 25
the 25
principle 25

for 25
observation 25

far 25

commonly 25
so 25
wide 25
separations 25
that 25
no 25
confidence 25
can 25
be 25
placed 25
in 25
such 25
views 25
particularly 25
when 25
we 25
reflect 25
on 25
the 25
great 25
variety 25
of 25
things 25
and 25
the 25
ease 25
with 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
discover 25

no 25
faith 25

excellent 25
principle 25

principle 25

any 25

of 25
the 25
natural 25
dialectic 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
cannot 25
be 25
of 25
themselves 25
and 25
in 25
their 25
own 25
nature 25
dialectical 25
it 25
is 25
from 25
their 25
misemployment 25
alone 25
that 25
fallacies 25
and 25
illusions 25
arise 25
for 25
they 25
originate 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
reason 25
itself 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
that 25
this 25
supreme 25
tribunal 25
for 25
all 25
the 25
rights 25
and 25
claims 25
of 25
speculation 25
should 25
be 25
itself 25
undeserving 25

promotive 25
of 25
error 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
expected 25
therefore 25
that 25
these 25

have 25
a 25
genuine 25

legitimate 25
aim 25

true 25
the 25
mob 25
of 25
sophists 25
raise 25
against 25

the 25
cry 25
of 25
inconsistency 25

contradiction 25
and 25
affect 25
to 25
despise 25
the 25
government 25
of 25
that 25
faculty 25
because 25
they 25
cannot 25
understand 25
its 25

while 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
its 25
beneficial 25
influences 25
alone 25
that 25
they 25
owe 25
the 25
position 25

the 25
intelligence 25
which 25
enable 25
them 25
to 25
criticize 25
and 25
to 25
blame 25
its 25
procedure 25
we 25
cannot 25
employ 25
an 25
a 25

conception 25
with 25
certainty 25
until 25
we 25
have 25
made 25
a 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
therefore 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
do 25
not 25
admit 25
of 25
the 25
same 25
kind 25
of 25
deduction 25
as 25
the 25
categories 25

if 25
they 25
are 25
to 25
possess 25
the 25
least 25
objective 25
validity 25

to 25
represent 25

mere 25

a 25
deduction 25
of 25
them 25

be 25
possible 25
this 25
deduction 25
will 25
complete 25
the 25
critical 25
task 25
imposed 25
upon 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
this 25
part 25
of 25
our 25
labours 25
that 25
we 25
now 25
proceed 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
great 25
difference 25
between 25
a 25
things 25
being 25
presented 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
as 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
an 25
absolute 25
sense 25
or 25
merely 25
as 25
an 25
ideal 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
case 25
i 25
employ 25
my 25
conceptions 25
to 25
determine 25
the 25
object 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
case 25
nothing 25
is 25
present 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
but 25
a 25
mere 25
schema 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
relate 25
directly 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
not 25
even 25
in 25
a 25
hypothetical 25
sense 25
but 25
which 25
is 25
useful 25
only 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
representing 25
other 25
objects 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
in 25
a 25
mediate 25
and 25
indirect 25
manner 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
their 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
in 25
the 25
intellect 25
thus 25
i 25
say 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
is 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
its 25
objective 25
reality 25
does 25
not 25
consist 25
in 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25
has 25
an 25
immediate 25
relation 25
to 25
an 25
object 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
means 25
of 25
establishing 25
its 25
objective 25
validity 25
it 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
schema 25
constructed 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
necessary 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
unity 25

the 25

systematic 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
empirical 25
exercise 25

which 25
we 25
deduce 25
this 25

of 25
experience 25
from 25
the 25
imaginary 25

properly 25
a 25
heuristic 25

not 25
an 25
ostensive 25
conception 25

not 25

us 25
any 25
information 25
respecting 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
an 25

it 25

indicates 25
how 25
under 25
the 25

of 25
the 25

to 25
regulate 25
its 25

to 25
these 25

this 25
forms 25
the 25
transcendental 25
deduction 25
of 25
all 25
speculative 25

not 25

plainer 25
guided 25
by 25
the 25
principles 25
involved 25
in 25
these 25
ideas 25
we 25
must 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
place 25
so 25
connect 25
all 25
the 25
phenomena 25
actions 25
and 25
feelings 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
were 25
a 25
simple 25
substance 25
which 25
endowed 25
with 25
personal 25
identity 25
possesses 25
a 25
permanent 25
existence 25
in 25
this 25
life 25
at 25
least 25
while 25
its 25
states 25
among 25
which 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
body 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
included 25
as 25
external 25
conditions 25
are 25
in 25
continual 25
change 25
secondly 25
in 25
cosmology 25
we 25
must 25
investigate 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
all 25
natural 25
phenomena 25
internal 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
external 25
as 25
if 25
they 25
belonged 25
to 25
a 25
chain 25
infinite 25
and 25
without 25
any 25
prime 25
or 25
supreme 25
member 25
while 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
on 25
this 25
account 25
deny 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
intelligible 25
grounds 25
of 25
these 25
phenomena 25
although 25
we 25
never 25
employ 25
them 25
to 25
explain 25
phenomena 25
for 25
the 25
simple 25
reason 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
objects 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
thirdly 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
theology 25
we 25
must 25
regard 25
the 25
whole 25
system 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
as 25
forming 25
an 25
absolute 25
but 25
dependent 25
and 25
sensuouslyconditioned 25
unity 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
as 25
based 25
upon 25
a 25
sole 25
supreme 25
and 25
allsufficient 25
ground 25
existing 25
apart 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
itselfa 25
ground 25
which 25
is 25
a 25
selfsubsistent 25
primeval 25
and 25
creative 25
reason 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
so 25
employ 25
our 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
as 25
if 25
all 25
objects 25
drew 25
their 25
origin 25
from 25
that 25
archetype 25
of 25
all 25
reason 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
we 25
ought 25
not 25
to 25
deduce 25
the 25
internal 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
from 25
a 25
simple 25
thinking 25
substance 25
but 25
deduce 25
them 25
from 25
each 25
other 25
under 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
the 25
regulative 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
simple 25
being 25
we 25
ought 25
not 25
to 25
deduce 25
the 25
phenomena 25
order 25
and 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
from 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
but 25
merely 25
draw 25
from 25
this 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
supremely 25
wise 25
cause 25
the 25
rules 25
which 25
must 25
guide 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
connection 25
of 25
causes 25
and 25
effects 25
now 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
to 25
hinder 25
us 25
from 25
admitting 25
these 25
ideas 25
to 25
possess 25
an 25
objective 25
and 25
hyperbolic 25
existence 25
except 25
the 25
cosmological 25
ideas 25
which 25
lead 25
reason 25
into 25
an 25
antinomy 25
the 25
psychological 25
and 25
theological 25
ideas 25
are 25
not 25
antinomial 25
they 25
contain 25
no 25
contradiction 25
and 25
how 25
then 25
can 25
any 25
one 25
dispute 25
their 25
objective 25
reality 25
since 25
he 25
who 25
denies 25
it 25
knows 25
as 25
little 25
about 25
their 25
possibility 25
as 25
we 25
who 25
affirm 25
and 25
yet 25
when 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
sufficient 25
to 25
convince 25
ourselves 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
positive 25
obstacle 25
in 25
the 25
way 25
for 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
allowable 25
to 25
regard 25
mere 25
creations 25
of 25
thought 25
which 25
transcend 25
though 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
contradict 25
all 25
our 25
conceptions 25
as 25
real 25
and 25
determinate 25
objects 25
solely 25
upon 25
the 25
authority 25
of 25
a 25
speculative 25
reason 25
striving 25
to 25
compass 25
its 25
own 25
aims 25
they 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
be 25
admitted 25
to 25
be 25
real 25
in 25
themselves 25
they 25
can 25
only 25

as 25
in 25
some 25
measure 25
analogous 25
to 25
them 25
we 25
abstract 25
from 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
idea 25
all 25
the 25
conditions 25
which 25
limit 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
our 25
understanding 25
but 25
which 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
are 25
the 25

our 25

conception 25

any 25
given 25
thing 25

thus 25
we 25
cogitate 25
a 25
something 25
of 25
the 25
real 25
nature 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
but 25
which 25
we 25
represent 25
to 25
ourselves 25
as 25
standing 25
in 25
a 25

the 25

admitting 25
these 25

our 25
cognitions 25
beyond 25
the 25

the 25

field 25

are 25
no 25

god 25
which 25
is 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
by 25
speculative 25
reason 25

in 25
the 25
strictest 25
sense 25
deistic 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
reason 25
does 25
not 25
assure 25
us 25
of 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
it 25
merely 25
gives 25
us 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
something 25
on 25
which 25
the 25
supreme 25
and 25
necessary 25
unity 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
is 25
based 25
this 25
something 25
we 25
cannot 25
following 25
the 25
analogy 25
of 25
a 25
real 25
substance 25
cogitate 25
otherwise 25
than 25
as 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
all 25
things 25
operating 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
rational 25
laws 25
if 25
we 25
regard 25
it 25
as 25
an 25
individual 25
object 25
although 25
we 25
should 25
rest 25
contented 25
with 25
the 25
idea 25
alone 25
as 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
make 25
no 25
attempt 25
at 25
completing 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
the 25
conditions 25
imposed 25
by 25
thought 25
this 25
attempt 25
is 25
indeed 25
inconsistent 25
with 25
the 25
grand 25
aim 25
of 25
complete 25
systematic 25
unity 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
cognitiona 25
unity 25
to 25
which 25
no 25
bounds 25
are 25
set 25
by 25
reason 25
hence 25
it 25
happens 25
that 25
admitting 25
a 25
divine 25
being 25
i 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
possibility 25
of 25
its 25
perfection 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
the 25
only 25
advantage 25
of 25
this 25
admission 25
is 25
that 25
it 25
enables 25
me 25
to 25
answer 25
all 25
other 25
questions 25
relating 25
to 25
the 25
contingent 25
and 25
to 25
give 25
reason 25
the 25
most 25
complete 25
satisfaction 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
unity 25
which 25
it 25
aims 25
at 25
attaining 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
satisfy 25
reason 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
this 25
hypothesis 25
itself 25
and 25
this 25
proves 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
its 25
intelligence 25
and 25
insight 25
into 25
the 25
subject 25
but 25
its 25
speculative 25
interest 25
alone 25
which 25
induces 25
it 25
to 25
proceed 25
from 25
a 25
point 25
lying 25
far 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
consider 25
all 25
objects 25
as 25
parts 25
of 25
a 25
systematic 25
whole 25
here 25
a 25
distinction 25
presents 25
itself 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
way 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
cogitate 25
a 25
presuppositiona 25
distinction 25
which 25
is 25
somewhat 25
subtle 25
but 25
of 25
great 25
importance 25
in 25
transcendental 25
philosophy 25
i 25
may 25
have 25
sufficient 25
grounds 25
to 25
admit 25
something 25
or 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
something 25
in 25
a 25
relative 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
suppositio 25
relativa 25
without 25
being 25
justified 25
in 25
admitting 25
it 25
in 25
an 25
absolute 25
sense 25
suppositio 25
absoluta 25
this 25
distinction 25
is 25
undoubtedly 25
requisite 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
recognize 25
though 25
we 25
are 25
ignorant 25
of 25
the 25
source 25
and 25
cause 25
of 25
that 25
necessity 25
and 25
which 25
we 25
assume 25
to 25
be 25
based 25
upon 25
some 25
ultimate 25
ground 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
cogitate 25
the 25
universality 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
in 25
a 25
more 25
determinate 25
way 25
for 25
example 25
i 25
cogitate 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
corresponding 25
to 25
a 25
pure 25
transcendental 25
idea 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
admit 25
that 25
this 25
being 25
exists 25
absolutely 25
and 25
in 25
itself 25
because 25
all 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
by 25
which 25
i 25
can 25
cogitate 25
an 25
object 25
in 25
a 25
determinate 25
manner 25
fall 25
short 25
of 25
assuring 25
me 25
of 25
its 25
existence 25
nay 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
my 25
conceptions 25
are 25
excluded 25
by 25
the 25
ideaby 25
the 25
very 25
fact 25
of 25
its 25
being 25
an 25
idea 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reality 25

nay 25
even 25
that 25
of 25
necessity 25
in 25
existence 25
have 25
no 25
significance 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
and 25
cannot 25
beyond 25
that 25
sphere 25
determine 25
any 25
object 25
they 25
may 25
accordingly 25
be 25
employed 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
but 25
they 25
are 25
utterly 25
inadequate 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
itself 25
considered 25
as 25
a 25
whole 25
because 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
explanation 25
must 25
lie 25
out 25
of 25
and 25
beyond 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
be 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
now 25
i 25
may 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
incomprehensible 25
being 25
of 25
this 25
naturethe 25
object 25
of 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
relatively 25
to 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
although 25
i 25
have 25
no 25
ground 25
to 25
admit 25
its 25
existence 25
absolutely 25

in 25
itself 25

which 25
i 25
shall 25
presently 25
speak 25
more 25
particularly 25
lies 25
at 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
extended 25
empirical 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
if 25
this 25
idea 25
cannot 25
be 25
adequately 25
represented 25
in 25
concreto 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
indispensably 25
necessary 25
for 25
the 25
approximation 25
of 25
empirical 25
unity 25
to 25
the 25
highest 25
possible 25
degreei 25
am 25
not 25
only 25
authorized 25
but 25
compelled 25
to 25
realize 25
this 25
idea 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
posit 25
a 25
real 25
object 25
corresponding 25
thereto 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
profess 25
to 25
know 25
this 25
object 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
me 25
merely 25
a 25
something 25
to 25
which 25
as 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
in 25
cognition 25
i 25
attribute 25
such 25
properties 25
as 25
are 25
analogous 25
to 25
the 25
conceptions 25
employed 25
by 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
following 25
the 25
analogy 25
of 25
the 25
notions 25
of 25
reality 25
substance 25
causality 25
and 25
necessity 25
i 25
cogitate 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
possesses 25
all 25
these 25
attributes 25
in 25
the 25
highest 25
degree 25
and 25
as 25
this 25
idea 25
is 25
the 25
offspring 25
of 25
my 25
reason 25
alone 25
i 25
cogitate 25
this 25
being 25
as 25
selfsubsistent 25
reason 25
and 25
as 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
operating 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
ideas 25
of 25
the 25
greatest 25
possible 25
harmony 25
and 25
unity 25
thus 25
i 25
abstract 25
all 25
conditions 25
that 25
would 25
limit 25
my 25
idea 25
solely 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
rendering 25
systematic 25
unity 25
possible 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
empirical 25
diversity 25
and 25
thus 25
securing 25
the 25
widest 25
possible 25
extension 25
for 25
the 25
exercise 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
that 25
sphere 25
this 25
i 25
am 25
enabled 25
to 25
do 25
by 25
regarding 25
all 25
connections 25
and 25
relations 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
as 25
if 25
they 25
were 25
the 25
dispositions 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
reason 25
of 25
which 25
our 25
reason 25
is 25
but 25
a 25
faint 25
image 25
i 25
then 25
proceed 25
to 25
cogitate 25
this 25
supreme 25
being 25
by 25
conceptions 25
which 25
have 25
properly 25
no 25
meaning 25
or 25
application 25
except 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
but 25
as 25
i 25
am 25
authorized 25
to 25
employ 25
the 25
transcendental 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
in 25
a 25
relative 25
respect 25
alone 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
the 25
substratum 25
of 25
the 25
greatest 25
possible 25
unity 25
in 25
experiencei 25
may 25
attribute 25
to 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
i 25
regard 25
as 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
such 25
properties 25
as 25
belong 25
solely 25
to 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
sense 25
and 25
experience 25
for 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
desire 25
and 25
am 25
not 25
justified 25
in 25
desiring 25
to 25
cognize 25
this 25
object 25
of 25
my 25
idea 25
as 25
it 25
exists 25
in 25
itself 25
for 25
i 25
possess 25
no 25
conceptions 25
sufficient 25
for 25
or 25
task 25
those 25
of 25
reality 25
substance 25
causality 25
nay 25
even 25
that 25
of 25
necessity 25
in 25
existence 25
losing 25
all 25
significance 25
and 25
becoming 25
merely 25
the 25
signs 25
of 25
conceptions 25
without 25
content 25
and 25
without 25
applicability 25
when 25
i 25
attempt 25
to 25
carry 25
them 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
i 25
cogitate 25
merely 25
the 25
relation 25
of 25
a 25
perfectly 25
unknown 25
being 25
to 25
the 25
greatest 25
possible 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
experience 25
solely 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
employing 25
it 25
as 25
the 25
schema 25
of 25
the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
which 25
directs 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
empirical 25
exercise 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
at 25
the 25
first 25
view 25
that 25
we 25
cannot 25
presuppose 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
this 25
transcendental 25
object 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reality 25
substance 25
causality 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
because 25
these 25
conceptions 25
cannot 25
be 25
applied 25
to 25
anything 25
that 25
is 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
thus 25
the 25
supposition 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
or 25
cause 25
is 25
purely 25
relative 25
it 25
is 25
cogitated 25
only 25
in 25
behalf 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
experience 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
is 25
but 25
a 25
something 25
of 25
whose 25
existence 25
in 25
itself 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
thus 25
too 25
it 25
becomes 25
sufficiently 25
manifest 25
why 25
we 25
required 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
objects 25
given 25
by 25
sense 25
although 25
we 25
can 25
never 25
have 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
of 25
this 25
being 25
or 25
of 25
its 25
absolute 25
necessity 25
and 25
now 25
we 25
can 25
clearly 25
perceive 25
the 25
result 25
of 25
our 25
transcendental 25
dialectic 25
and 25
the 25
proper 25
aim 25
of 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reasonwhich 25
become 25
dialectical 25
solely 25
from 25
misunderstanding 25
and 25
inconsiderateness 25
pure 25
reason 25
is 25
in 25
fact 25
occupied 25
with 25
itself 25
and 25
not 25
with 25
any 25
object 25
objects 25
are 25
not 25
presented 25
to 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
embraced 25
in 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
an 25
empirical 25
conception 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
cognitions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
that 25
are 25
presented 25
to 25
it 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
receiving 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
a 25
rational 25
conception 25
that 25
is 25
of 25
being 25
connected 25
according 25
to 25
a 25
principle 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
reason 25
is 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
system 25
and 25
this 25
systematic 25
unity 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
objective 25
principle 25
extending 25
its 25
dominion 25
over 25
objects 25
but 25
a 25
subjective 25
maxim 25
extending 25
its 25
authority 25
over 25
the 25
empirical 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
the 25
systematic 25
connection 25
which 25
reason 25
gives 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
employment 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
not 25
only 25
advances 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
that 25
employment 25
but 25
ensures 25
its 25
correctness 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
a 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
this 25
nature 25
is 25
also 25
objective 25
although 25
only 25
in 25
an 25
indefinite 25
respect 25
principium 25
vagum 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
however 25
a 25
constitutive 25
principle 25
determining 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
directly 25
relates 25
it 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
or 25
maxim 25
advancing 25
and 25

they 25

nothing 25

a 25

we 25
only 25
take 25
proper 25
care 25
not 25
to 25
consider 25
it 25
as 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
idea 25
that 25

if 25
we 25
regard 25
it 25
as 25
valid 25

no 25

the 25
consideration 25

this 25

elements 25

the 25

as 25
an 25
actual 25

evident 25

may 25
be 25
placed 25
quite 25
out 25
of 25

beyond 25
it 25
and 25
the 25
series 25

absolute 25
beginning 25

an 25
intelligible 25

all 25
this 25
proves 25
that 25
the 25
cosmological 25
ideas 25
are 25
nothing 25
but 25
regulative 25
principles 25
and 25
not 25
constitutive 25
and 25
that 25
their 25
aim 25

not 25
to 25
realize 25
an 25

in 25
such 25
series 25
the 25
full 25
discussion 25
of 25
this 25
subject 25
will 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
its 25
proper 25
place 25
in 25
the 25
chapter 25
on 25
the 25
antinomy 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
the 25
third 25
idea 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
containing 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
which 25
is 25
valid 25
merely 25
as 25
a 25
relative 25
hypothesis 25
is 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
and 25
allsufficient 25
cause 25
of 25
all 25
cosmological 25
series 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
god 25
we 25
have 25
not 25
the 25
slightest 25
ground 25
absolutely 25
to 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
corresponding 25
to 25
this 25
idea 25
for 25
what 25
can 25
empower 25
or 25
authorize 25
us 25
to 25
affirm 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
perfectiona 25
being 25
whose 25
existence 25
is 25
absolutely 25
necessarymerely 25
because 25
we 25
possess 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
the 25
answer 25
is 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
which 25
renders 25
this 25
hypothesis 25
necessary 25
but 25
this 25
answer 25
makes 25
it 25
perfectly 25
evident 25
that 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
this 25
being 25
like 25
all 25
other 25
speculative 25
ideas 25
is 25
essentially 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
demand 25
upon 25
reason 25
that 25
it 25
shall 25
regulate 25
the 25
connection 25
which 25
it 25
and 25
its 25
subordinate 25
faculties 25
introduce 25
into 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
by 25
principles 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
and 25
consequently 25
that 25
it 25
shall 25
regard 25
all 25
phenomena 25
as 25
originating 25
from 25
one 25
allembracing 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
supreme 25
and 25
allsufficient 25
cause 25
from 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
plain 25
that 25
the 25
only 25
aim 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
this 25
procedure 25
is 25
the 25
establishment 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
formal 25
rule 25
for 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
its 25
dominion 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
that 25
it 25
does 25
not 25
aim 25
at 25
an 25
extension 25
of 25
its 25
cognition 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
that 25
consequently 25
this 25
idea 25
does 25
not 25
contain 25
any 25
constitutive 25
principle 25
the 25
highest 25
formal 25
unity 25
which 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
ideas 25
alone 25
is 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
all 25
thingsa 25
unity 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
an 25
aim 25
or 25
purpose 25
and 25
the 25
speculative 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
renders 25
it 25
necessary 25
to 25
regard 25
all 25
order 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
as 25
if 25
it 25
originated 25
from 25
the 25
intention 25
and 25
design 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
reason 25
this 25
principle 25
unfolds 25
to 25
the 25
view 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
new 25
and 25
enlarged 25
prospects 25
and 25
invites 25
it 25
to 25
connect 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
according 25
to 25
teleological 25
laws 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
the 25
highest 25
possible 25
degree 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
of 25

accordingly 25
always 25
of 25
the 25
greatest 25
service 25
to 25
reason 25
thus 25
if 25
we 25
presuppose 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
figure 25
of 25
the 25
earth 25
which 25
is 25
round 25
but 25
somewhat 25
flattened 25

the 25

an 25
author 25

we 25
cannot 25
fail 25
to 25
make 25
by 25
the 25
light 25
of 25
this 25
supposition 25
a 25
great 25
number 25
of 25
interesting 25
discoveries 25
if 25
we 25
keep 25
to 25
this 25
hypothesis 25
as 25
a 25
principle 25
which 25
is 25
purely 25
regulative 25
even 25
error 25
cannot 25
be 25
very 25
detrimental 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
error 25
can 25
have 25
no 25
more 25
serious 25
consequences 25
than 25
that 25
where 25
we 25
expected 25
to 25
discover 25
a 25
teleological 25
connection 25

finalis 25
only 25
a 25
mechanical 25
or 25
physical 25
connection 25
appears 25
in 25
such 25
a 25
case 25
we 25
merely 25
fail 25
to 25
find 25
the 25
additional 25
form 25
of 25
unity 25
we 25
expected 25
but 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
lose 25
the 25
rational 25
unity 25
which 25
the 25
mind 25
requires 25
in 25
its 25
procedure 25
in 25

but 25
even 25

convict 25
an 25

of 25
an 25
error 25
when 25
he 25
connects 25
the 25
limb 25
of 25
some 25
animal 25
with 25
a 25
certain 25
purpose 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
impossible 25
to 25
prove 25
in 25
a 25
single 25
case 25
that 25
any 25
arrangement 25
of 25
nature 25
be 25
it 25
what 25
it 25
may 25
is 25
entirely 25
without 25
aim 25

and 25
thus 25
medical 25
physiology 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
a 25
principle 25
presented 25
to 25
it 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
extends 25
its 25
very 25
limited 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
of 25

that 25

may 25
be 25
asserted 25

the 25
utmost 25
confidence 25

with 25
the 25
approbation 25
of 25
all 25

that 25
every 25
organ 25

bodily 25
part 25
of 25
an 25

if 25
regarded 25

much 25
farther 25
than 25
any 25

hence 25
it 25

nothing 25

of 25
a 25
thinking 25
substance 25
the 25
interest 25
which 25
we 25
take 25
in 25
things 25
and 25
events 25
that 25
can 25
happen 25
only 25
after 25
our 25
death 25
from 25
a 25
consciousness 25
of 25
the 25
immaterial 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
thinking 25
subject 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
thus 25
he 25
dispenses 25
with 25
all 25
empirical 25
investigations 25
into 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
these 25
internal 25
phenomena 25
and 25
with 25
all 25
possible 25
explanations 25
of 25
them 25
upon 25
purely 25
natural 25
grounds 25
while 25
at 25
the 25
dictation 25
of 25
a 25
transcendent 25
reason 25
he 25
passes 25
by 25
the 25
immanent 25
sources 25
of 25
cognition 25
in 25
experience 25
greatly 25
to 25
his 25
own 25
ease 25
and 25
convenience 25
but 25
to 25
the 25
sacrifice 25
of 25
all 25
genuine 25
insight 25
and 25
intelligence 25
these 25
prejudicial 25
consequences 25
become 25
still 25
more 25
evident 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
treatment 25
of 25
our 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
and 25
the 25
theological 25
system 25
of 25
nature 25
physicotheology 25
which 25
is 25
falsely 25
based 25
upon 25
it 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
the 25
aims 25
which 25
we 25
observe 25
in 25
nature 25
and 25
often 25
those 25
which 25
we 25
merely 25
fancy 25
to 25
exist 25
make 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
causes 25
a 25
very 25
easy 25
task 25
by 25
directing 25
us 25
to 25
refer 25
such 25
and 25
such 25
phenomena 25
immediately 25
to 25
the 25
unsearchable 25
will 25
and 25
counsel 25
of 25
the 25
supreme 25
wisdom 25
while 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
investigate 25
their 25
causes 25
in 25
the 25
general 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
mechanism 25
of 25
matter 25
we 25
are 25
thus 25
recommended 25
to 25
consider 25
the 25
labour 25
of 25
reason 25
as 25
ended 25
when 25
we 25
have 25
merely 25
dispensed 25
with 25
its 25
employment 25
which 25
is 25
guided 25
surely 25
and 25
safely 25
only 25
by 25
the 25
order 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
changes 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
which 25
are 25
arranged 25
according 25
to 25
immanent 25
and 25
general 25
laws 25
this 25
error 25
may 25
be 25
avoided 25
if 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
merely 25
consider 25
from 25
the 25
viewpoint 25
of 25
final 25
aims 25
certain 25
parts 25
of 25
nature 25
such 25
as 25
the 25
division 25
and 25
structure 25
of 25
a 25
continent 25
the 25
constitution 25
and 25
direction 25
of 25
certain 25
mountainchains 25
or 25
even 25
the 25
organization 25
existing 25
in 25
the 25
vegetable 25
and 25
animal 25
kingdoms 25
but 25
look 25
upon 25
this 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
nature 25
in 25
a 25
perfectly 25
general 25
way 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
if 25
we 25
pursue 25
this 25
advice 25
we 25
lay 25
as 25
a 25
foundation 25
for 25
all 25
investigation 25
the 25
conformity 25
to 25
aims 25
of 25
all 25
phenomena 25
of 25
nature 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
universal 25
laws 25
for 25
which 25
no 25
particular 25
arrangement 25
of 25
nature 25
is 25
exempt 25
but 25
only 25
cognized 25
by 25
us 25
with 25
more 25
or 25
less 25
difficulty 25
and 25
we 25
possess 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
a 25
teleological 25
connection 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
attempt 25
to 25
anticipate 25
or 25
predetermine 25
all 25
that 25
we 25
do 25
and 25
ought 25
to 25
do 25
is 25
to 25
follow 25
out 25
the 25
physicomechanical 25
connection 25
in 25
nature 25
according 25
to 25
general 25
laws 25
with 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
discovering 25
sooner 25
or 25
later 25
the 25
teleological 25
connection 25
also 25
thus 25
and 25
thus 25
only 25
can 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
final 25
unity 25
aid 25
in 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
without 25
being 25
in 25
any 25
case 25
detrimental 25
to 25
its 25
interests 25
footnote 25
this 25
was 25
the 25
term 25
applied 25
by 25
the 25
old 25
dialecticians 25
to 25
a 25
sophistical 25
argument 25
which 25
ran 25

that 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
reasoning 25
has 25
received 25
this 25
appellation 25
because 25
if 25
followed 25
it 25
puts 25
an 25

the 25
sophistical 25
argument 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
the 25
second 25
error 25
which 25
arises 25
from 25
the 25
misconception 25
of 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
is 25

of 25
perverted 25

perversa 25

the 25
idea 25
of 25
systematic 25

is 25
available 25
as 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
in 25
the 25
connection 25
of 25
phenomena 25
according 25
to 25
general 25
natural 25
laws 25
and 25
how 25
far 25
soever 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
travel 25
upon 25
the 25
path 25
of 25
experience 25
to 25
discover 25
some 25
fact 25
or 25

this 25
idea 25
requires 25
us 25
to 25
believe 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
approached 25
all 25
the 25
more 25
nearly 25
to 25
the 25
completion 25
of 25

of 25

although 25
that 25
completion 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
attained 25
but 25
this 25
error 25
reverses 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
begin 25
by 25
hypostatizing 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
systematic 25
unity 25
and 25
by 25
giving 25
an 25
anthropomorphic 25
determination 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
and 25
then 25
proceed 25
forcibly 25
to 25
impose 25
aims 25
upon 25
nature 25
thus 25
not 25
only 25
does 25
teleology 25
which 25
ought 25
to 25
aid 25
in 25

operate 25
to 25
the 25
destruction 25
of 25
its 25
influence 25
but 25
it 25
hinders 25
reason 25
from 25
attaining 25
its 25
proper 25
aim 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
proof 25
upon 25
natural 25
grounds 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligent 25

we 25

presuppose 25
supreme 25
finality 25
in 25
nature 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
is 25
as 25
essentially 25
belonging 25
to 25
nature 25

can 25
we 25
be 25
directed 25
to 25
endeavour 25
to 25
discover 25
this 25
unity 25
and 25
rising 25
gradually 25
through 25
its 25
different 25
degrees 25
to 25
approach 25
the 25
supreme 25
perfection 25
of 25
an 25
author 25
of 25

absolutely 25
necessary 25
and 25
therefore 25
cognizable 25
a 25

the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
directs 25
us 25
to 25
presuppose 25
systematic 25
unity 25
absolutely 25
and 25
consequently 25
as 25
following 25
from 25
the 25
essential 25
nature 25
of 25

only 25
as 25
a 25
unity 25
of 25

merely 25
cognized 25
empirically 25
but 25
presupposed 25
a 25

although 25
only 25
in 25
an 25
indeterminate 25
manner 25

if 25
i 25
insist 25
on 25

in 25
effect 25
lost 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25

is 25
quite 25
foreign 25
and 25
unessential 25
to 25
the 25

thus 25
arises 25
a 25
vicious 25
circular 25
argument 25

to 25
have 25
been 25
proved 25

complete 25
unity 25
in 25
conformity 25

if 25
we 25

not 25
find 25
this 25
unity 25

in 25
the 25
universal 25

hence 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
natural 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
legislative 25
reason 25
corresponding 25
to 25
it 25
from 25
which 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
nature 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
operations 25
of 25
reasonmust 25
be 25
derived 25
in 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
our 25
discussion 25
of 25
the 25
antinomies 25
we 25
stated 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
always 25
possible 25
to 25
answer 25
all 25
the 25
questions 25
which 25
pure 25
reason 25
may 25
raise 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
plea 25
of 25
the 25
limited 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
which 25
is 25
unavoidable 25
and 25
proper 25
in 25
many 25
questions 25
regarding 25
natural 25
phenomena 25
cannot 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
be 25
admitted 25
because 25
the 25
questions 25
raised 25
do 25
not 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
things 25
but 25
are 25
necessarily 25
originated 25
by 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
reason 25
itself 25
and 25
relate 25
to 25
its 25
own 25
internal 25
constitution 25
we 25
can 25
now 25
establish 25
this 25
assertion 25
which 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
appeared 25
so 25
rash 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
two 25
questions 25
in 25
which 25
reason 25
takes 25
the 25
greatest 25
interest 25
and 25
thus 25
complete 25
our 25
discussion 25
of 25
the 25
dialectic 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
if 25
then 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
asked 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
transcendental 25
theology 25
first 25
whether 25
there 25
is 25
anything 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
which 25
contains 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
cosmical 25
order 25
and 25
connection 25
according 25
to 25
general 25
laws 25
the 25
answer 25
is 25
certainly 25
for 25
the 25
world 25
is 25
a 25
sum 25
of 25
phenomena 25
there 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
some 25
transcendental 25
basis 25
of 25
these 25
phenomena 25
that 25
is 25
a 25
basis 25
cogitable 25
by 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
alone 25
if 25
secondly 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
asked 25
whether 25
this 25
being 25
is 25
substance 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
of 25
the 25
greatest 25
reality 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
and 25
so 25
forth 25
i 25
answer 25
that 25
this 25
question 25
is 25
utterly 25
without 25
meaning 25
for 25
all 25
the 25
categories 25
which 25
aid 25
me 25
in 25
forming 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
cannot 25
be 25
employed 25
except 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
and 25
are 25
without 25
meaning 25
when 25
not 25
applied 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
actual 25
or 25
possible 25
experience 25
out 25
of 25
this 25
sphere 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
properly 25
conceptions 25
but 25
the 25
mere 25
marks 25
or 25
indices 25
of 25
conceptions 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
admit 25
although 25
they 25
cannot 25
without 25
the 25
help 25
of 25
experience 25
help 25
us 25
to 25
understand 25
any 25
subject 25
or 25
thing 25
if 25
thirdly 25
the 25
question 25
is 25
whether 25
we 25
may 25
not 25
cogitate 25
this 25
being 25
which 25
is 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
in 25
analogy 25
with 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
the 25
answer 25
is 25
undoubtedly 25
but 25
only 25
as 25
an 25
ideal 25
and 25
not 25
as 25
a 25
real 25
object 25
that 25
is 25
we 25
must 25
cogitate 25
it 25
only 25
as 25
an 25
unknown 25
substratum 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
order 25
and 25
finality 25
of 25
the 25
worlda 25
unity 25
which 25
reason 25
must 25
employ 25
as 25
the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25
its 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25
nay 25
more 25
we 25
may 25
admit 25
into 25
the 25
idea 25
certain 25
anthropomorphic 25
elements 25
which 25
are 25
promotive 25
of 25
the 25
interests 25
of 25
this 25
regulative 25
principle 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
no 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
idea 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
relate 25
directly 25
to 25
a 25
being 25
distinct 25
from 25
the 25
world 25
but 25
to 25
the 25
regulative 25
principle 25
of 25

systematic 25
unity 25
of 25

been 25
said 25
of 25
the 25
psychological 25
idea 25

not 25
enter 25

details 25
regarding 25

by 25
which 25
the 25

all 25
the 25
various 25
phenomena 25
of 25
the 25
internal 25
sense 25
is 25
hypostatized 25
the 25
procedure 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
very 25
similar 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
has 25
been 25
discussed 25
in 25
our 25
remarks 25
on 25
the 25
theological 25
ideal 25
but 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
asked 25
again 25
can 25
we 25
on 25
these 25
grounds 25
admit 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
wise 25
and 25
omnipotent 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
without 25
doubt 25
and 25
not 25
only 25
so 25
but 25
we 25
must 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
but 25
do 25
we 25
thus 25
extend 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
beyond 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
for 25
we 25
have 25
merely 25
presupposed 25
a 25
something 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
conception 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
itself 25
but 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
systematic 25
disposition 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
which 25
we 25
must 25
presuppose 25
in 25
all 25
our 25
observation 25
of 25
nature 25
we 25
have 25
cogitated 25
this 25
unknown 25
being 25
in 25
analogy 25
with 25
an 25
intelligent 25
existence 25
an 25
empirical 25
conception 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
we 25
have 25
endowed 25
it 25
with 25
those 25
attributes 25
which 25
judging 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
our 25
own 25
reason 25
may 25
contain 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
systematic 25
unity 25
this 25
idea 25
is 25
therefore 25
valid 25
only 25
relatively 25
to 25
the 25
employment 25
in 25
experience 25
of 25
our 25
reason 25
but 25
if 25
we 25
attribute 25
to 25
it 25
absolute 25
and 25
objective 25
validity 25
we 25
overlook 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
merely 25
an 25
ideal 25
being 25
that 25
we 25
cogitate 25
and 25
by 25
setting 25
out 25
from 25
a 25
basis 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
determinable 25
by 25
considerations 25
drawn 25
from 25
experience 25
we 25
place 25
ourselves 25
in 25
a 25
position 25
which 25
incapacitates 25
us 25
from 25
applying 25
this 25
principle 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
asked 25
further 25
can 25
i 25
make 25
any 25
use 25
of 25
this 25
conception 25
and 25
hypothesis 25
in 25
my 25
investigations 25
into 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
nature 25
yes 25
for 25
this 25
very 25
purpose 25
was 25
the 25
idea 25
established 25
by 25
reason 25
as 25
a 25
fundamental 25
basis 25
but 25
may 25
i 25
regard 25
certain 25
arrangements 25
which 25
seemed 25
to 25
have 25
been 25
made 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
some 25
fixed 25
aim 25
as 25
the 25
arrangements 25
of 25
design 25
and 25
look 25
upon 25
them 25
as 25
proceeding 25
from 25
the 25
divine 25
will 25
with 25
the 25
intervention 25
however 25
of 25
certain 25
other 25
particular 25
arrangements 25
disposed 25
to 25
that 25
end 25
yes 25
you 25
may 25
do 25
so 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
you 25
must 25
regard 25
it 25
as 25
indifferent 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
asserted 25
that 25
divine 25
wisdom 25
has 25
disposed 25
all 25
things 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
his 25
highest 25
aims 25
or 25
that 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
supreme 25
wisdom 25
is 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
in 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
a 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
nature 25
according 25
to 25
general 25
laws 25
even 25
in 25
those 25
cases 25
where 25
we 25
are 25
unable 25
to 25
discover 25
that 25
unity 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
perfectly 25
indifferent 25
to 25
you 25
whether 25
you 25
say 25
when 25
you 25
have 25
discovered 25
this 25
unity 25
god 25
has 25
wisely 25
willed 25
it 25
so 25
or 25
nature 25
has 25
wisely 25
arranged 25
this 25
for 25
it 25
was 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
which 25
reason 25
requires 25
as 25
a 25
basis 25
for 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25
that 25
justified 25
you 25
in 25
accepting 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
as 25
a 25
schema 25
for 25
a 25
regulative 25
principle 25
and 25
the 25
farther 25
you 25
advance 25
in 25
the 25
discovery 25
of 25
design 25
and 25
finality 25
the 25
more 25
certain 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
your 25
idea 25
but 25
as 25
the 25
whole 25
aim 25
of 25
this 25
regulative 25
principle 25
was 25
the 25
discovery 25
of 25
a 25
necessary 25
and 25
systematic 25
unity 25
in 25
nature 25
we 25
have 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
attain 25
this 25
to 25
attribute 25
our 25
success 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
while 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
we 25
cannot 25
without 25
involving 25
ourselves 25
in 25
contradictions 25
overlook 25
the 25
general 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
as 25
it 25
was 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
them 25
alone 25
that 25
this 25
idea 25
was 25
employed 25
we 25
cannot 25
i 25
say 25
overlook 25
the 25
general 25
laws 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
regard 25
this 25
conformity 25
to 25
aims 25
observable 25
in 25
nature 25
as 25
contingent 25
or 25
hyperphysical 25
in 25
its 25

the 25

at 25

so 25
great 25

thorough 25

the 25

on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25

employed 25
as 25
constitutive 25
principles 25

the 25

of 25
these 25

the 25

that 25
the 25

i 25
am 25
well 25
aware 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
language 25
of 25
the 25
schools 25
the 25
term 25
discipline 25
is 25
usually 25
employed 25
as 25
synonymous 25
with 25
instruction 25
but 25
there 25
are 25
so 25
many 25
cases 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
to 25
distinguish 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
as 25
a 25
course 25
of 25
corrective 25
training 25
from 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
latter 25
as 25
the 25
communication 25
of 25
knowledge 25
and 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
things 25
itself 25
demands 25
the 25
appropriation 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
suitable 25
expressions 25
for 25
this 25
distinction 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
my 25
desire 25
that 25
the 25
former 25
terms 25
should 25
never 25
be 25
employed 25
in 25
any 25
other 25
than 25
a 25
negative 25
signification 25
that 25
natural 25
dispositions 25
and 25
talents 25
such 25
as 25
imagination 25
and 25
wit 25
which 25
ask 25
a 25
free 25
and 25
unlimited 25
development 25
require 25

many 25
respects 25
the 25
corrective 25

of 25
discipline 25
every 25
one 25
will 25
readily 25
grant 25

it 25
may 25
well 25
appear 25
strange 25
that 25
reason 25

proper 25
duty 25
it 25

all 25
the 25
other 25

itself 25

fact 25
hitherto 25
escaped 25
this 25
humiliation 25
only 25
because 25
in 25

its 25
magnificent 25
pretensions 25

high 25
position 25
no 25
one 25
could 25
readily 25
suspect 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
capable 25
of 25
substituting 25
fancies 25
for 25
conceptions 25

words 25
for 25
things 25

when 25
employed 25

not 25
stand 25
in 25

the 25
continual 25

is 25
criticism 25
requisite 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
mathematics 25
where 25
the 25
conceptions 25

always 25
be 25
presented 25
in 25

the 25

the 25

us 25

requisite 25
which 25
as 25

construct 25
a 25

the 25

the 25

this 25

the 25

it 25

notwithstanding 25
to 25
indicate 25
the 25

even 25
in 25
its 25
universality 25
because 25
in 25
this 25

we 25
keep 25
our 25

the 25

entirely 25
a 25

so 25
that 25
as 25
this 25

determined 25
under 25
certain 25

therefore 25

formal 25
quality 25

does 25
not 25

by 25
asserting 25
that 25
the 25
former 25

found 25
in 25
its 25

alone 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
quantities 25
only 25
that 25
is 25
capable 25
of 25
being 25
constructed 25
that 25
is 25
presented 25
a 25

in 25
intuition 25
while 25
qualities 25
cannot 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
any 25
other 25
than 25
an 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
hence 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
qualities 25
by 25
reason 25
is 25
possible 25
only 25
through 25
conceptions 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
find 25
an 25
intuition 25
which 25
shall 25
correspond 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
reality 25
except 25
in 25
experience 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
presented 25
to 25
the 25
mind 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
antecedently 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
consciousness 25
of 25
a 25
reality 25
we 25
can 25
form 25
an 25
intuition 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
the 25
mere 25
conception 25
of 25
it 25
of 25
a 25
cone 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experience 25
but 25
the 25
colour 25
of 25
the 25
cone 25
we 25
cannot 25
know 25
except 25
from 25
experience 25
i 25
cannot 25
present 25
an 25
intuition 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
except 25
in 25
an 25
example 25
which 25
experience 25
offers 25
to 25
me 25
besides 25
philosophy 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
mathematics 25
treats 25
of 25
quantities 25
as 25
for 25
example 25
of 25
totality 25
infinity 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
mathematics 25
too 25
treats 25
of 25
the 25
difference 25
of 25
lines 25
and 25
surfacesas 25
spaces 25
of 25

continuity 25
of 25

a 25
quality 25
thereof 25
but 25
although 25
in 25
such 25
cases 25
they 25
have 25
a 25
common 25
object 25
the 25
mode 25
in 25
which 25
reason 25
considers 25
that 25
object 25
is 25
very 25
different 25
in 25
philosophy 25
from 25
what 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
mathematics 25
the 25
former 25
confines 25
itself 25
to 25
the 25
general 25
conceptions 25
the 25
latter 25
can 25
do 25
nothing 25
with 25
a 25
mere 25
conception 25
it 25
hastens 25
to 25
intuition 25
in 25
this 25
intuition 25
it 25
regards 25
the 25
conception 25
in 25
concreto 25
not 25
empirically 25
but 25
in 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
intuition 25
which 25
it 25
has 25
constructed 25
and 25
in 25
which 25
all 25
the 25
results 25
which 25
follow 25
from 25
the 25
general 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
are 25
in 25
all 25
cases 25
valid 25
for 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
constructed 25
conception 25
suppose 25
that 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
triangle 25
is 25
given 25
to 25
a 25
philosopher 25
and 25
that 25
he 25
is 25
required 25
to 25
discover 25
by 25
the 25
philosophical 25
method 25
what 25
relation 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
its 25
angles 25
bears 25
to 25
a 25
right 25
angle 25
he 25
has 25
nothing 25
before 25
him 25
but 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
figure 25
enclosed 25
within 25
three 25
right 25
lines 25
and 25
consequently 25
with 25
the 25
same 25
number 25
of 25
angles 25
he 25
may 25
analyse 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
right 25
line 25
of 25
an 25
angle 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
number 25
three 25
as 25
long 25
as 25
he 25
pleases 25
but 25
he 25
will 25
not 25
discover 25
any 25
properties 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
these 25
conceptions 25
but 25
if 25
this 25
question 25
is 25
proposed 25
to 25
a 25
geometrician 25
he 25
at 25
once 25
begins 25
by 25
constructing 25
a 25
triangle 25
he 25
knows 25
that 25
two 25
right 25
angles 25
are 25
equal 25
to 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
contiguous 25
angles 25
which 25
proceed 25
from 25
one 25
point 25
in 25
a 25
straight 25
line 25
and 25
he 25
goes 25
on 25
to 25
produce 25
one 25
side 25
of 25
his 25
triangle 25
thus 25
forming 25
two 25
adjacent 25
angles 25
which 25
are 25
together 25
equal 25
to 25
two 25
right 25
angles 25
he 25
then 25
divides 25
the 25
exterior 25
of 25
these 25
angles 25
by 25
drawing 25
a 25
line 25
parallel 25
with 25
the 25
opposite 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
triangle 25
and 25
immediately 25
perceives 25
that 25
he 25
has 25
thus 25
got 25
an 25
exterior 25
adjacent 25
angle 25
which 25
is 25
equal 25
to 25
the 25
interior 25
proceeding 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
through 25
a 25
chain 25
of 25
inferences 25
and 25
always 25
on 25
the 25
ground 25
of 25
intuition 25
he 25
arrives 25
at 25
a 25
clear 25
and 25
universally 25
valid 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
but 25
mathematics 25
does 25
not 25
confine 25
itself 25
to 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
quantities 25
quanta 25
as 25
in 25
the 25

made 25
of 25
the 25

conception 25

method 25
of 25
notation 25

adopted 25
and 25
these 25
indicate 25
the 25
different 25
possible 25
constructions 25
of 25
quantities 25
the 25
extraction 25
of 25
roots 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
after 25
having 25
thus 25
denoted 25
the 25
general 25
conception 25
of 25
quantities 25
according 25
to 25
their 25
different 25

to 25

it 25

be 25
vain 25
to 25
philosophize 25
upon 25

that 25

to 25
reflect 25

get 25
no 25
further 25

out 25
there 25

certainly 25
transcendental 25

are 25
framed 25

of 25
pure 25
conceptions 25

which 25
form 25
the 25
peculiar 25
distinction 25
of 25
philosophy 25
but 25
these 25
do 25
not 25
relate 25
to 25
any 25
particular 25
thing 25

to 25
a 25

the 25
conditions 25
under 25

it 25

the 25

nothing 25

they 25

themselves 25

they 25
think 25
it 25

to 25
employ 25
them 25

all 25
this 25
they 25
are 25
perfectly 25

overstep 25
the 25

the 25

they 25

unconsciously 25
from 25

the 25

pursued 25

upon 25
us 25
the 25

perhaps 25
that 25

its 25

the 25

we 25

constructed 25

it 25
can 25
never 25

less 25

the 25

only 25
an 25

teaches 25
us 25
what 25

that 25

hence 25
a 25

not 25

we 25

incapable 25

the 25

the 25

with 25
perfect 25

renounce 25
its 25
magnificent 25
dogmatical 25
pretensions 25

very 25
different 25

the 25

to 25
defend 25

against 25

the 25

the 25

whether 25
its 25
own 25
statements 25
may 25
not 25
also 25
be 25
false 25
it 25
merely 25
regards 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
reason 25
proves 25
that 25
the 25
opposite 25
cannot 25
be 25
established 25

asserted 25

reason 25

not 25
hold 25
her 25

she 25
cannot 25
show 25
a 25
perfectly 25
satisfactory 25
title 25
to 25
them 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
prove 25
that 25
she 25
is 25
not 25
the 25
rightful 25
possessor 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
melancholy 25
reflection 25
that 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
highest 25
exercise 25
falls 25
into 25
an 25
antithetic 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
supreme 25
tribunal 25
for 25
the 25
settlement 25
of 25
differences 25
should 25
not 25
be 25
at 25
union 25
with 25
itself 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
that 25
we 25
had 25
to 25
discuss 25
the 25
question 25
of 25
an 25
apparent 25
antithetic 25
but 25
we 25
found 25
that 25
it 25
was 25
based 25
upon 25
a 25
misconception 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
common 25
prejudice 25
phenomena 25
were 25
regarded 25
as 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
thus 25
an 25
absolute 25
completeness 25
in 25
their 25
synthesis 25
was 25
required 25
in 25
the 25
one 25
mode 25
or 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
it 25
was 25
shown 25
to 25
be 25
impossible 25
in 25
both 25
a 25
demand 25
entirely 25
out 25
of 25
place 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
phenomena 25
there 25
was 25
then 25
no 25
real 25
selfcontradiction 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
propositions 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
phenomena 25
given 25
in 25
themselves 25
has 25
an 25
absolutely 25
first 25
beginning 25
and 25
this 25
series 25
is 25
absolutely 25
and 25
in 25
itself 25
without 25
beginning 25
the 25
two 25
propositions 25
are 25
perfectly 25
consistent 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
because 25
phenomena 25
as 25
phenomena 25
are 25
in 25
themselves 25
nothing 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
must 25
lead 25
to 25
selfcontradictory 25
inferences 25
but 25
there 25
are 25
cases 25
in 25
which 25
a 25
similar 25
misunderstanding 25
cannot 25
be 25
provided 25
against 25
and 25
the 25
dispute 25
must 25
remain 25
unsettled 25
take 25
for 25
example 25
the 25
theistic 25
proposition 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
and 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
atheistic 25
counterstatement 25
there 25
exists 25
no 25
supreme 25
being 25
or 25
in 25
psychology 25
everything 25
that 25
thinks 25
possesses 25
the 25
attribute 25
of 25
absolute 25
and 25
permanent 25
unity 25
which 25
is 25
utterly 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
transitory 25
unity 25
of 25
material 25
phenomena 25
and 25
the 25
counterproposition 25
the 25
soul 25
is 25
not 25
an 25
immaterial 25
unity 25
and 25
its 25
nature 25
is 25
transitory 25
like 25
that 25
of 25
phenomena 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
these 25
questions 25
contain 25
no 25
heterogeneous 25
or 25
contradictory 25
elements 25
for 25
they 25
relate 25
to 25
things 25
in 25
themselves 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
phenomena 25
there 25
would 25
arise 25
indeed 25
a 25
real 25
contradiction 25
if 25
reason 25
came 25
forward 25
with 25
a 25
statement 25
on 25
the 25
negative 25
side 25
of 25
these 25
questions 25
alone 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
criticism 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
on 25
the 25
affirmative 25
side 25
must 25
be 25
subjected 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
freely 25
admitted 25
without 25
necessitating 25
the 25
surrender 25
of 25
the 25
affirmative 25
propositions 25
which 25
have 25
at 25

the 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
their 25
favouran 25
advantage 25
which 25
the 25
opposite 25
party 25
cannot 25
lay 25
claim 25
to 25
i 25
cannot 25
agree 25
with 25
the 25
opinion 25
of 25

in 25

we 25
may 25
hope 25
one 25
day 25
to 25
see 25
sufficient 25
demonstrations 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
cardinal 25
propositions 25
of 25
pure 25
reasonthe 25

a 25
supreme 25
being 25
and 25
the 25
immortality 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
i 25
am 25
certain 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
that 25
this 25
will 25
never 25
be 25
the 25
case 25
for 25
on 25
what 25
ground 25
can 25
reason 25
base 25
such 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
which 25
do 25
not 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
their 25
internal 25
possibility 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
also 25
demonstratively 25
certain 25
that 25
no 25
one 25
will 25
ever 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
maintain 25
the 25
contrary 25
with 25
the 25
least 25
show 25
of 25
probability 25
for 25
as 25
he 25
can 25
attempt 25
such 25
a 25
proof 25
solely 25
upon 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
he 25
is 25
bound 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
and 25
a 25
thinking 25
subject 25
in 25
the 25
character 25
of 25
a 25
pure 25
intelligence 25
are 25
impossible 25
but 25
where 25
will 25
he 25
find 25
the 25
knowledge 25
which 25
can 25
enable 25
him 25
to 25
enounce 25
synthetical 25
judgements 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
things 25
which 25
transcend 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
experience 25
we 25
may 25
therefore 25
rest 25
assured 25
that 25
the 25
opposite 25
never 25
will 25
be 25
demonstrated 25
we 25
need 25
not 25
then 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
scholastic 25
arguments 25
we 25
may 25
always 25
admit 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
those 25
propositions 25
which 25
are 25
consistent 25
with 25
the 25
speculative 25
interests 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
form 25
moreover 25
the 25
only 25
means 25
of 25
uniting 25
the 25
speculative 25
with 25
the 25
practical 25
interest 25
our 25
opponent 25
who 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
considered 25
here 25
as 25
a 25
critic 25
solely 25
we 25
can 25
be 25
ready 25
to 25
meet 25
with 25
a 25
non 25
liquet 25
which 25
cannot 25
fail 25
to 25
disconcert 25
him 25
while 25
we 25
cannot 25
deny 25
his 25
right 25
to 25
a 25
similar 25
retort 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
on 25
our 25
side 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
the 25
support 25
of 25
the 25
subjective 25
maxim 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
can 25
therefore 25
look 25
upon 25
all 25
his 25
sophistical 25
arguments 25
with 25
calm 25
indifference 25
from 25
this 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
there 25

no 25

this 25
consideration 25
restores 25
to 25
reason 25
her 25
courage 25
for 25
what 25
source 25
of 25
confidence 25
could 25
be 25
found 25
if 25

against 25
the 25
fallacies 25

sophistries 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
are 25
objections 25
given 25
by 25
the 25
nature 25

this 25

itself 25

must 25
therefore 25
have 25
a 25

raised 25
many 25

we 25

the 25
deepest 25

so 25
far 25
above 25
us 25
that 25
we 25
vainly 25
try 25
to 25
cognize 25
them 25
with 25
certainty 25
and 25
our 25
powers 25
of 25

rather 25

we 25
may 25
chance 25
to 25
seize 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
doubtful 25
whether 25
it 25
is 25
for 25
our 25
benefit 25
to 25
advance 25
bold 25
affirmations 25
regarding 25
subjects 25
involved 25
in 25
such 25
obscurity 25
perhaps 25
it 25
would 25
even 25
be 25
detrimental 25
to 25
our 25
best 25
interests 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
undoubtedly 25
always 25
beneficial 25
to 25
leave 25
the 25

well 25
as 25
the 25
critical 25
reason 25
in 25
perfect 25
freedom 25
and 25
permit 25
it 25
to 25
take 25
charge 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
interests 25
which 25
are 25
advanced 25
as 25
much 25
by 25
its 25
limitation 25
as 25
by 25
its 25
extension 25
of 25
its 25
views 25
and 25
which 25
always 25
suffer 25
by 25
the 25
interference 25
of 25
foreign 25
powers 25
forcing 25
it 25
against 25

such 25
a 25

serves 25
merely 25
to 25
disclose 25
the 25
antinomy 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
as 25
it 25

its 25
source 25
in 25

not 25
the 25

but 25
the 25
manner 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
perfectly 25
permissible 25
to 25
employ 25

all 25
pretensions 25

if 25
we 25

the 25
dispassionate 25
david 25
humea 25
philosopher 25
endowed 25
in 25
a 25
degree 25
that 25
few 25
are 25
with 25
a 25
wellbalanced 25
judgement 25
what 25
motive 25
induced 25
you 25
to 25
spend 25
so 25
much 25
labour 25
and 25
thought 25
in 25
undermining 25
the 25
consoling 25
and 25
beneficial 25
persuasion 25
that 25
reason 25
is 25
capable 25
of 25
assuring 25
us 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
and 25
presenting 25
us 25
with 25
a 25
determinate 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
beinghis 25
answer 25
would 25
be 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
desire 25
of 25
teaching 25
reason 25
to 25
know 25
its 25
own 25
powers 25
better 25
and 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
a 25
dislike 25
of 25
the 25
procedure 25
by 25
which 25
that 25
faculty 25
was 25
compelled 25
to 25
support 25
foregone 25
conclusions 25
and 25
prevented 25
from 25
confessing 25
the 25
internal 25
weaknesses 25
which 25
it 25
cannot 25
but 25
feel 25
when 25
it 25
enters 25
upon 25
a 25
rigid 25
selfexamination 25
if 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
were 25
to 25
ask 25
priestleya 25
philosopher 25
who 25
had 25
no 25
taste 25
for 25
transcendental 25
speculation 25
but 25
was 25
entirely 25
devoted 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
empiricismwhat 25
his 25
motives 25
were 25
for 25
overturning 25
those 25
two 25
main 25
pillars 25

the 25

his 25
view 25
the 25

but 25
the 25
expectation 25
of 25
the 25
miracle 25
of 25
resurrection 25
this 25
philosopher 25
himself 25
a 25
zealous 25
and 25
pious 25
teacher 25
of 25
religion 25
could 25
give 25
no 25
other 25
answer 25
than 25
this 25
i 25
acted 25
in 25
the 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
always 25
suffers 25
when 25
certain 25
objects 25
are 25
explained 25
and 25
judged 25
by 25
a 25
reference 25

only 25
laws 25
which 25
we 25
know 25
in 25
a 25
determinate 25
manner 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
unfair 25
to 25
decry 25
the 25
latter 25
philosopher 25
who 25

to 25
harmonize 25
his 25
paradoxical 25
opinions 25
with 25
the 25
interests 25
of 25

and 25
to 25
undervalue 25
an 25
honest 25
and 25
reflecting 25
man 25
because 25
he 25
finds 25
himself 25
at 25
a 25
loss 25
the 25

he 25
has 25
left 25
the 25

man 25
not 25
less 25
welldisposed 25

quite 25
as 25
blameless 25
in 25
his 25
moral 25
character 25
and 25
who 25
pushed 25
his 25
abstract 25
speculations 25
to 25
an 25
extreme 25
length 25
because 25
as 25
he 25
rightly 25

entirely 25
beyond 25

within 25

is 25
in 25
human 25
nature 25
an 25
unworthy 25
propensitya 25
propensity 25
which 25
like 25
everything 25
that 25
springs 25
from 25
nature 25
must 25
in 25
its 25
final 25
purpose 25
be 25
conducive 25
to 25
the 25
good 25
of 25
humanityto 25
conceal 25
our 25
real 25
sentiments 25
and 25
to 25
give 25
expression 25
only 25
to 25
certain 25
received 25
opinions 25
which 25
are 25
regarded 25
as 25
at 25
once 25
safe 25
and 25
promotive 25
of 25
the 25
common 25
good 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
this 25
tendency 25
not 25
only 25
to 25
conceal 25
our 25
real 25
sentiments 25
but 25
to 25
profess 25
those 25
which 25
may 25
gain 25
us 25
favour 25
in 25
the 25
eyes 25
of 25
society 25
has 25
not 25
only 25
civilized 25
but 25
in 25
a 25
certain 25
measure 25
moralized 25
us 25
as 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
break 25
through 25
the 25
outward 25
covering 25
of 25
respectability 25
honour 25
and 25
morality 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
seeminglygood 25
examples 25
which 25
we 25
which 25
we 25
see 25
around 25
us 25
form 25
an 25
excellent 25
school 25
for 25
moral 25
improvement 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
our 25
belief 25
in 25
their 25
genuineness 25
remains 25
unshaken 25
but 25
this 25
disposition 25
to 25
represent 25
ourselves 25
as 25
better 25
than 25
we 25
are 25
and 25
to 25
utter 25
opinions 25
which 25
are 25
not 25
our 25
own 25
can 25
be 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
kind 25
of 25
provisionary 25
arrangement 25
of 25
nature 25
to 25
lead 25
us 25
from 25
the 25
rudeness 25
of 25
an 25
uncivilized 25
state 25
and 25
to 25
teach 25
us 25
how 25
to 25
assume 25
at 25
least 25
the 25
appearance 25
and 25
manner 25
of 25
the 25
good 25
we 25
see 25
but 25
when 25
true 25
principles 25
have 25
been 25
developed 25
and 25
have 25
obtained 25
a 25
sure 25
foundation 25
in 25
our 25
habit 25
of 25
thought 25
this 25
conventionalism 25
must 25
be 25
attacked 25
with 25
earnest 25
vigour 25
otherwise 25
it 25
corrupts 25
the 25
heart 25
and 25
checks 25
the 25
growth 25
of 25
good 25
dispositions 25
with 25
the 25
mischievous 25
weed 25
of 25
air 25
appearances 25
i 25
am 25
sorry 25
to 25
remark 25
the 25
same 25
tendency 25
to 25
misrepresentation 25
and 25
hypocrisy 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
speculative 25
discussion 25
where 25
there 25
is 25
less 25
temptation 25
to 25
restrain 25
the 25
free 25
expression 25
of 25
thought 25
for 25
what 25
can 25
be 25
more 25
prejudicial 25
to 25
the 25
interests 25
of 25
intelligence 25
than 25
to 25
falsify 25
our 25
real 25
sentiments 25
to 25
conceal 25
the 25
doubts 25
which 25
we 25
feel 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
our 25
statements 25
or 25
to 25
maintain 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
which 25
we 25
well 25
know 25
to 25
be 25
insufficient 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
mere 25
personal 25
vanity 25
is 25
the 25
source 25
of 25
these 25
unworthy 25
artificesand 25
this 25
is 25
generally 25
the 25
case 25
in 25
speculative 25
discussions 25
which 25
are 25
mostly 25
destitute 25
of 25
practical 25
interest 25
and 25
are 25
incapable 25
of 25
complete 25
demonstrationthe 25
vanity 25
of 25
the 25
opposite 25
party 25
exaggerates 25
as 25
much 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
side 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
result 25
is 25
the 25
same 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
brought 25
about 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
if 25
the 25
dispute 25
had 25
been 25
conducted 25
in 25
a 25
sincere 25
and 25
upright 25
spirit 25
but 25
where 25
the 25
mass 25
entertains 25
the 25
notion 25
that 25
the 25
aim 25
of 25
certain 25
subtle 25
speculators 25
is 25
nothing 25
less 25
than 25
to 25
shake 25
the 25
very 25
foundations 25
of 25
public 25
welfare 25
and 25
moralityit 25
seems 25
not 25
only 25
prudent 25
but 25
even 25
praise 25
worthy 25
to 25
maintain 25
the 25
good 25
cause 25
by 25
illusory 25
arguments 25
rather 25
than 25
to 25
give 25
to 25
our 25
supposed 25
opponents 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
lowering 25
our 25
declarations 25
to 25
the 25
moderate 25
tone 25
of 25
a 25
merely 25
practical 25
conviction 25
and 25
of 25
compelling 25
us 25
to 25
confess 25
our 25
inability 25
to 25
attain 25
to 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
in 25
speculative 25
subjects 25
but 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
reflect 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
nothing 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
more 25
fatal 25
to 25
the 25
maintenance 25
of 25
a 25
good 25
cause 25
than 25
deceit 25
misrepresentation 25
and 25
falsehood 25
that 25
the 25
strictest 25
laws 25
of 25
honesty 25
should 25
be 25
observed 25
in 25
the 25
discussion 25
of 25
a 25
purely 25
speculative 25
subject 25
is 25
the 25
least 25
requirement 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
made 25
if 25
we 25
could 25
reckon 25
with 25
security 25
even 25
upon 25
so 25
little 25
the 25
conflict 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
regarding 25
the 25
important 25
questions 25
of 25
god 25
immortality 25
and 25
freedom 25
would 25
have 25
been 25
either 25
decided 25
long 25
ago 25
or 25
would 25
very 25
soon 25
be 25
brought 25
to 25
a 25
conclusion 25
but 25
in 25
general 25
the 25
uprightness 25
of 25
the 25
defence 25
stands 25
in 25
an 25
inverse 25
ratio 25
to 25
the 25
goodness 25
of 25
the 25
cause 25
and 25
perhaps 25
more 25
honesty 25
and 25
fairness 25
are 25
shown 25
by 25
those 25
who 25
deny 25
than 25
by 25
those 25
who 25
uphold 25
these 25
doctrines 25
i 25
shall 25
persuade 25
myself 25
then 25
that 25
i 25
have 25
readers 25
who 25
do 25
not 25
wish 25
to 25
see 25
a 25
righteous 25
cause 25
defended 25
by 25
unfair 25
arguments 25
such 25
will 25
now 25
recognize 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
this 25
critique 25
if 25
we 25
consider 25
not 25
what 25
is 25
but 25
what 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
case 25
there 25
can 25
be 25
really 25
no 25
polemic 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
for 25
how 25
can 25
two 25
persons 25
dispute 25
about 25
a 25
thing 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
which 25
neither 25
can 25
present 25
in 25
actual 25
or 25
even 25
in 25
possible 25
experience 25
each 25
adopts 25
the 25
plan 25
of 25
meditating 25
on 25
his 25
idea 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
drawing 25
from 25
the 25
idea 25
if 25
he 25
can 25
what 25
is 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
idea 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
which 25
it 25
indicates 25
how 25
shall 25
they 25
settle 25
the 25
dispute 25
since 25
neither 25
is 25
able 25
to 25
make 25
his 25
assertions 25
directly 25
comprehensible 25
and 25
certain 25
but 25
must 25
restrict 25
himself 25
to 25
attacking 25
and 25
confuting 25
those 25
of 25
his 25
opponent 25
all 25
statements 25
enounced 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
transcend 25
the 25
conditions 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
discover 25
no 25
criterion 25
of 25
truth 25
while 25
they 25
are 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
framed 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
which 25
are 25
applicable 25
only 25
to 25
experience 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
fate 25
of 25
all 25
such 25
speculative 25
discussions 25
that 25
while 25
the 25
one 25
party 25
attacks 25
the 25
weaker 25
side 25
of 25
his 25
opponent 25
he 25
infallibly 25
lays 25
open 25
his 25
own 25
weaknesses 25
the 25
critique 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
may 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
highest 25
tribunal 25
for 25
all 25
speculative 25
disputes 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
involved 25
in 25
these 25
disputes 25
which 25
have 25
an 25
immediate 25
relation 25
to 25
certain 25
objects 25
and 25
not 25
to 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
but 25
is 25
instituted 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
determining 25
the 25
rights 25
and 25
limits 25
of 25
reason 25
without 25
the 25
control 25
of 25
criticism 25
reason 25
is 25
as 25
it 25
were 25
in 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
can 25
only 25
establish 25
its 25
claims 25
and 25
assertions 25
by 25
war 25
criticism 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
deciding 25
all 25
questions 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
fundamental 25
laws 25
of 25
its 25
own 25
institution 25
secures 25
to 25
us 25
the 25
peace 25
of 25
law 25
and 25
order 25
and 25
enables 25
us 25
to 25
discuss 25
all 25
differences 25
in 25
the 25
more 25
tranquil 25
manner 25
of 25
a 25
legal 25
process 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
case 25
disputes 25
are 25
ended 25
by 25
victory 25
which 25
both 25
sides 25
may 25
claim 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
followed 25
by 25
a 25
hollow 25
armistice 25
in 25
the 25
latter 25
by 25
a 25
sentence 25
which 25
as 25
it 25
strikes 25
at 25
the 25
root 25
of 25
all 25
speculative 25
differences 25
ensures 25
to 25
all 25
concerned 25
a 25
lasting 25
peace 25
the 25
endless 25
disputes 25
of 25
a 25
dogmatizing 25
reason 25
compel 25
us 25
to 25
look 25
for 25
some 25
mode 25
of 25
arriving 25
at 25
a 25
settled 25
decision 25
by 25
a 25
critical 25
investigation 25
of 25
reason 25
itself 25
just 25
as 25
hobbes 25
maintains 25
that 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
nature 25
is 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
injustice 25
and 25
violence 25
and 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
leave 25
it 25
and 25
submit 25
ourselves 25
to 25
the 25
constraint 25
of 25
law 25
which 25
indeed 25
limits 25
individual 25
freedom 25
but 25
only 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
consist 25
with 25
the 25
freedom 25
of 25
others 25
and 25
with 25
the 25
common 25
good 25
of 25
all 25
this 25
freedom 25
will 25
among 25
other 25
things 25
permit 25
of 25
our 25
openly 25
stating 25
the 25
difficulties 25
and 25
doubts 25
which 25
we 25
are 25
ourselves 25
unable 25
to 25
solve 25
without 25
being 25
decried 25
on 25
that 25
account 25
as 25
turbulent 25
and 25
dangerous 25
citizens 25
this 25
privilege 25
forms 25
part 25
of 25
the 25
native 25
rights 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
which 25
recognizes 25
no 25
other 25
judge 25
than 25
the 25
universal 25
reason 25
of 25
humanity 25
and 25
as 25
this 25
reason 25
is 25
the 25
source 25
of 25
all 25
progress 25
and 25
improvement 25
such 25
a 25
privilege 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
held 25
sacred 25
and 25
inviolable 25
it 25
is 25
unwise 25
moreover 25
to 25
denounce 25
as 25
dangerous 25
any 25
bold 25
assertions 25
against 25
or 25
rash 25
attacks 25
upon 25
an 25
opinion 25
which 25
is 25
held 25
by 25
the 25
largest 25
and 25
most 25
moral 25
class 25
of 25
the 25
community 25
for 25
that 25
would 25
be 25
giving 25
them 25
an 25
importance 25
which 25
they 25
do 25
not 25
deserve 25
when 25
i 25
hear 25
that 25
the 25
freedom 25
of 25
the 25
will 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
and 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
have 25
been 25
overthrown 25
by 25
the 25
arguments 25
of 25
some 25
able 25
writer 25
i 25
feel 25
a 25
strong 25
desire 25
to 25
read 25
his 25
book 25
for 25
i 25
expect 25
that 25
he 25
will 25
add 25
to 25
my 25
knowledge 25
and 25
impart 25
greater 25
clearness 25
and 25
distinctness 25
to 25
my 25
views 25
by 25
the 25
argumentative 25
power 25
shown 25
in 25
his 25
writings 25
but 25
i 25
am 25
perfectly 25
certain 25
even 25
before 25
i 25
have 25
opened 25
the 25
book 25
that 25
he 25
has 25
not 25
succeeded 25
in 25
a 25
single 25
point 25
not 25
because 25
i 25
believe 25
i 25
am 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
irrefutable 25
demonstrations 25
of 25
these 25
important 25
propositions 25
but 25
because 25
this 25
transcendental 25
critique 25
which 25
has 25
disclosed 25
to 25
me 25
the 25
power 25
and 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
has 25
fully 25
convinced 25
me 25
that 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
insufficient 25
to 25
establish 25
the 25
affirmative 25
it 25
is 25
as 25
powerless 25
and 25
even 25
more 25
so 25
to 25
assure 25
us 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
negative 25
answer 25
to 25
these 25
questions 25
from 25
what 25
source 25
does 25
this 25
freethinker 25
derive 25
his 25
knowledge 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
for 25
example 25
no 25
supreme 25
being 25
this 25
proposition 25
lies 25
out 25
of 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
and 25
therefore 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
human 25
cognition 25
but 25
i 25
would 25
not 25
read 25
at 25
all 25
the 25
answer 25
which 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
maintainer 25
of 25
the 25
good 25
cause 25
makes 25
to 25
his 25
opponent 25
because 25
i 25
know 25
well 25
beforehand 25
that 25
he 25
will 25
merely 25
attack 25
the 25
fallacious 25
grounds 25
of 25
his 25
adversary 25
without 25
being 25
able 25
to 25
establish 25
his 25
own 25
assertions 25
besides 25
a 25
new 25
illusory 25
argument 25
in 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
which 25
talent 25
and 25
acuteness 25
are 25
shown 25
is 25
suggestive 25
of 25
new 25
ideas 25
and 25
new 25
trains 25
of 25
reasoning 25
and 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
the 25
old 25
and 25
everyday 25
sophistries 25
are 25
quite 25
useless 25
again 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
opponent 25
of 25
religion 25
gives 25
employment 25
to 25
criticism 25
and 25
enables 25
us 25
to 25
test 25
and 25
correct 25
its 25
principles 25
while 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
occasion 25
for 25
anxiety 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
influence 25
and 25
results 25
of 25
his 25
reasoning 25
but 25
it 25
will 25
be 25
said 25
must 25
we 25
not 25
warn 25
the 25
youth 25
entrusted 25
to 25
academical 25
care 25
against 25
such 25
writings 25
must 25
we 25
not 25
preserve 25
them 25
from 25
the 25
knowledge 25
of 25
these 25
dangerous 25
assertions 25
until 25
their 25
judgement 25
is 25
ripened 25
or 25
rather 25
until 25
the 25
doctrines 25
which 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
inculcate 25
are 25
so 25
firmly 25
rooted 25
in 25
their 25
minds 25
as 25
to 25
withstand 25
all 25
attempts 25
at 25
instilling 25
the 25
contrary 25
dogmas 25
from 25
whatever 25
quarter 25
they 25
may 25
come 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
confine 25
ourselves 25
to 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
procedure 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
find 25
ourselves 25
unable 25
to 25
settle 25
such 25
disputes 25
otherwise 25
than 25
by 25
becoming 25
a 25
party 25
in 25
them 25
and 25
setting 25
counterassertions 25
against 25
the 25
statements 25
advanced 25
by 25
our 25
opponents 25
there 25
is 25
certainly 25
no 25
plan 25
more 25
advisable 25
for 25
the 25
moment 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
none 25
more 25
absurd 25
and 25
inefficient 25
for 25
the 25
future 25
than 25
this 25
retaining 25
of 25
the 25
youthful 25
mind 25
under 25
guardianship 25
for 25
a 25
time 25
and 25
thus 25
preserving 25
itfor 25
so 25
long 25
at 25
leastfrom 25
seduction 25
into 25
error 25
but 25
when 25
at 25
a 25
later 25
period 25
either 25
curiosity 25
or 25
the 25
prevalent 25
fashion 25
of 25
thought 25
places 25
such 25
writings 25
in 25
their 25
hands 25
will 25
the 25
socalled 25
convictions 25
of 25
their 25
youth 25
stand 25
firm 25
the 25
young 25
thinker 25
who 25
has 25
in 25
his 25
armoury 25
none 25
but 25
dogmatical 25
weapons 25
with 25
which 25
to 25
resist 25
the 25
attacks 25
of 25
his 25
opponent 25
and 25
who 25
cannot 25
detect 25
the 25
latent 25
dialectic 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
his 25
own 25
opinions 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
opposite 25
party 25
sees 25
the 25
advance 25
of 25
illusory 25
arguments 25
and 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
which 25
have 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
novelty 25
against 25
as 25
illusory 25
grounds 25
of 25
proof 25
destitute 25
of 25
this 25
advantage 25
and 25
which 25
perhaps 25
excite 25
the 25
suspicion 25
that 25
the 25
natural 25
credulity 25
of 25
his 25
youth 25
has 25
been 25
abused 25
by 25
his 25
instructors 25
he 25
thinks 25
he 25
can 25
find 25
no 25
better 25
means 25
of 25
showing 25
that 25
he 25
has 25
out 25
grown 25
the 25
discipline 25
of 25
his 25
minority 25
than 25
by 25
despising 25
those 25
wellmeant 25
warnings 25
and 25
knowing 25
no 25
system 25
of 25
thought 25
but 25
that 25
of 25
dogmatism 25
he 25
drinks 25
deep 25
draughts 25
of 25
the 25
poison 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
sap 25
the 25
principles 25
in 25
which 25
his 25
early 25
years 25
were 25
trained 25
exactly 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
the 25
system 25
here 25
recommended 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
pursued 25
in 25
academical 25
instruction 25
this 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
effected 25
however 25
by 25
a 25
thorough 25
training 25
in 25
the 25
critical 25
investigation 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
for 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
bring 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
this 25
critique 25
into 25
exercise 25
as 25
soon 25
as 25
possible 25
and 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
their 25
perfect 25
even 25
in 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
degree 25
of 25
dialectical 25
illusion 25
the 25
student 25
ought 25
to 25
examine 25
the 25
assertions 25
made 25
on 25
both 25
sides 25
of 25
speculative 25
questions 25
step 25
by 25
step 25
and 25
to 25
test 25
them 25
by 25
these 25
principles 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
a 25
difficult 25
task 25
for 25
him 25
to 25
show 25
the 25
fallacies 25
inherent 25
in 25
these 25
propositions 25
and 25
thus 25
he 25
begins 25
early 25
to 25
feel 25
his 25
own 25
power 25
of 25
securing 25
himself 25
against 25
the 25
influence 25
of 25
such 25
sophistical 25
arguments 25
which 25
must 25
finally 25
lose 25
for 25
him 25
all 25
their 25
illusory 25
power 25
and 25
although 25
the 25
same 25
blows 25
which 25
overturn 25
the 25
edifice 25
of 25
his 25
opponent 25
are 25
as 25
fatal 25
to 25
his 25
own 25
speculative 25
structures 25
if 25
such 25
he 25
has 25
wished 25
to 25
rear 25
he 25
need 25
not 25
feel 25
any 25
sorrow 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
this 25
seeming 25
misfortune 25
as 25
he 25
has 25
now 25
before 25
him 25
a 25
fair 25
prospect 25
into 25
the 25
practical 25
region 25
in 25
which 25
he 25
may 25
reasonably 25
hope 25
to 25
find 25
a 25
more 25
secure 25
foundation 25
for 25
a 25
rational 25
system 25
there 25
is 25
accordingly 25
no 25
proper 25
polemic 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
both 25
parties 25
beat 25
the 25
air 25
and 25
fight 25
with 25
their 25
own 25
shadows 25
as 25
they 25
pass 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
can 25
find 25
no 25
tangible 25
point 25
of 25
attackno 25
firm 25
footing 25
for 25
their 25
dogmatical 25
conflict 25
fight 25
as 25
vigorously 25
as 25
they 25
may 25
the 25
shadows 25
which 25
they 25
hew 25
down 25
immediately 25
start 25
up 25
again 25
like 25
the 25
heroes 25
in 25
walhalla 25
and 25
renew 25
the 25
bloodless 25
and 25
unceasing 25
contest 25
but 25
neither 25
can 25
we 25
admit 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
any 25
proper 25
sceptical 25
employment 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
such 25
as 25
might 25
be 25
based 25
upon 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
neutrality 25
in 25
all 25
speculative 25
disputes 25
to 25
excite 25
reason 25
against 25
itself 25
to 25
place 25
weapons 25
in 25
the 25
hands 25
of 25
the 25
party 25
on 25
the 25
one 25
side 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
those 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
and 25
to 25
remain 25
an 25
undisturbed 25
and 25
sarcastic 25
spectator 25
of 25
the 25
fierce 25
struggle 25
that 25
ensues 25
seems 25
from 25
the 25
dogmatical 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
to 25
be 25
a 25
part 25
fitting 25
only 25
a 25
malevolent 25
disposition 25
but 25
when 25
the 25
sophist 25
evidences 25
an 25
invincible 25
obstinacy 25
and 25
blindness 25
and 25
a 25
pride 25
which 25
no 25
criticism 25
can 25
moderate 25
there 25
is 25
no 25
other 25
practicable 25
course 25
than 25
to 25
oppose 25
to 25
this 25
pride 25
and 25
obstinacy 25
similar 25
feelings 25
and 25
pretensions 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
side 25
equally 25
well 25
or 25
ill 25
founded 25
so 25
that 25
reason 25
staggered 25
by 25
the 25
reflections 25
thus 25
forced 25
upon 25
it 25
finds 25
it 25
necessary 25
to 25
moderate 25
its 25
confidence 25
in 25
such 25
pretensions 25
and 25
to 25
listen 25
to 25
the 25
advice 25
of 25
criticism 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
stop 25
at 25
these 25
doubts 25
much 25
less 25
regard 25
the 25
conviction 25
of 25
our 25
ignorance 25
not 25
only 25
as 25
a 25
cure 25
for 25
the 25
conceit 25
natural 25
to 25
dogmatism 25
but 25
as 25
the 25
settlement 25
of 25
the 25
disputes 25
in 25
which 25
reason 25
is 25
involved 25
with 25
itself 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
scepticism 25
is 25
merely 25
a 25
means 25
of 25
awakening 25
reason 25
from 25
its 25
dogmatic 25
dreams 25
and 25
exciting 25
it 25
to 25

more 25
careful 25
investigation 25
into 25
its 25
own 25
powers 25

but 25
as 25
scepticism 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
shortest 25

to 25
a 25

as 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
track 25
pursued 25
by 25
the 25
many 25
who 25
aim 25
at 25
giving 25

their 25
contemptuous 25
dislike 25
of 25
all 25

i 25
think 25
it 25
necessary 25
to 25
present 25
to 25
my 25
readers 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
thought 25
in 25
its 25

this 25
ignorance 25
is 25
recognized 25

absolutely 25
necessary 25

instead 25
of 25
forming 25
the 25
conclusion 25
of 25
my 25
inquiries 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
strongest 25
motive 25
to 25
the 25
pursuit 25
of 25
them 25
all 25
ignorance 25
is 25
either 25
ignorance 25
of 25
things 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
knowledge 25
if 25
my 25
ignorance 25
is 25
accidental 25
and 25
not 25
necessary 25
it 25
must 25
incite 25
me 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
case 25
to 25
a 25
dogmatical 25
inquiry 25
regarding 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
ignorant 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
to 25
a 25
critical 25
investigation 25
into 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
all 25
possible 25
knowledge 25
but 25
that 25
my 25
ignorance 25
is 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
and 25
unavoidable 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
consequently 25
absolves 25
from 25
the 25
duty 25
of 25
all 25
further 25
investigation 25
is 25
a 25
fact 25
which 25
cannot 25
be 25
made 25
out 25
upon 25
empirical 25
groundsfrom 25
observationbut 25
upon 25
critical 25
grounds 25
alone 25
that 25
is 25
by 25
a 25
thoroughgoing 25
investigation 25
into 25
the 25
primary 25
sources 25
of 25
cognition 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
reason 25
can 25
be 25
made 25

the 25
empirical 25
limitation 25
of 25

which 25
is 25
merely 25
an 25
indeterminate 25
cognition 25
of 25
an 25
ignorance 25
that 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
completely 25

can 25
take 25
place 25
only 25
a 25
posteriori 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
our 25
empirical 25
knowledge 25
is 25
limited 25
by 25
that 25
which 25
yet 25
remains 25
for 25
us 25
to 25
know 25
the 25
former 25

merely 25
a 25

we 25
cannot 25
say 25
how 25
far 25
the 25
inferences 25
drawn 25
from 25
it 25
may 25
extend 25

i 25
regard 25
the 25

i 25
am 25

this 25

are 25
alike 25
in 25
vain 25
but 25
all 25
the 25
questions 25
raised 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
relate 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
lies 25
beyond 25
this 25
horizon 25
or 25
at 25
least 25
in 25
its 25
boundary 25
line 25
the 25
celebrated 25
david 25
hume 25
was 25
one 25
of 25
those 25
geographers 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
who 25
believe 25
that 25
they 25
have 25
given 25
a 25
sufficient 25
answer 25
to 25
all 25
such 25
questions 25
by 25
declaring 25
them 25
to 25
lie 25
beyond 25
the 25
horizon 25
of 25
our 25
knowledgea 25
horizon 25
which 25
however 25
hume 25
was 25
unable 25
to 25
determine 25
his 25
attention 25
especially 25
was 25
directed 25
to 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
and 25
he 25
remarked 25
with 25
perfect 25
justice 25
that 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
this 25
principle 25
and 25
even 25
the 25
objective 25
validity 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
cause 25
was 25
not 25
commonly 25
based 25
upon 25
clear 25
insight 25
that 25
is 25
upon 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
hence 25
he 25
concluded 25
that 25
this 25
law 25
does 25
not 25
derive 25
its 25
authority 25
from 25
its 25
universality 25
and 25
necessity 25
but 25
merely 25
from 25
its 25
general 25
applicability 25
in 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
a 25
kind 25
of 25
subjective 25
necessity 25
thence 25
arising 25
which 25
he 25
termed 25
habit 25
from 25
the 25
inability 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
establish 25
this 25
principle 25
as 25
a 25
necessary 25
law 25
for 25
the 25
acquisition 25
of 25
all 25
experience 25
he 25
inferred 25
the 25
nullity 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
attempts 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
pass 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
the 25
empirical 25
this 25
procedure 25
of 25
subjecting 25
the 25
facta 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
examination 25
and 25
if 25
necessary 25
to 25
disapproval 25
may 25
be 25
termed 25
the 25
censura 25
of 25
reason 25
this 25
censura 25
must 25
inevitably 25
lead 25
us 25
to 25
doubts 25
regarding 25
all 25
transcendent 25
employment 25
of 25
principles 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
only 25
the 25
second 25
step 25
in 25
our 25
inquiry 25
the 25
first 25
step 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
subjects 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
which 25
marks 25
the 25
infancy 25
of 25
that 25
faculty 25
is 25
that 25
of 25
dogmatism 25
the 25
second 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
just 25
mentioned 25
is 25
that 25
of 25
scepticism 25
and 25
it 25
gives 25
evidence 25
that 25
our 25
judgement 25
has 25
been 25
improved 25
by 25
experience 25
but 25
a 25
third 25
step 25
is 25
necessaryindicative 25
of 25
the 25
maturity 25
and 25
manhood 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
which 25
now 25
lays 25
a 25
firm 25
foundation 25
upon 25
universal 25
and 25
necessary 25
principles 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
period 25
of 25
criticism 25
in 25
which 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
examine 25
the 25
facta 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
reason 25
itself 25
in 25
the 25
whole 25
extent 25
of 25
its 25
powers 25
and 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
its 25
capability 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
and 25
thus 25
we 25
determine 25
not 25
merely 25
the 25
empirical 25
and 25
evershifting 25
bounds 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
but 25
its 25
necessary 25
and 25
eternal 25
limits 25
we 25
demonstrate 25
from 25
indubitable 25
principles 25
not 25
merely 25
our 25
ignorance 25
in 25
respect 25
to 25
this 25
or 25
that 25
subject 25
but 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
all 25
possible 25
questions 25
of 25
a 25
certain 25
class 25
thus 25
scepticism 25
is 25
a 25
resting 25
place 25
for 25
reason 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
may 25
reflect 25
on 25
its 25
dogmatical 25
wanderings 25
and 25
gain 25
some 25
knowledge 25
of 25
the 25
region 25
in 25
which 25
it 25
happens 25
to 25
be 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
pursue 25
its 25
way 25
with 25
greater 25
certainty 25
but 25
it 25
cannot 25
be 25
its 25
permanent 25
dwellingplace 25
it 25
must 25
take 25
up 25
its 25
abode 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
complete 25
certitude 25
whether 25
this 25
relates 25
to 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
objects 25
themselves 25
or 25
to 25
the 25
limits 25
which 25
bound 25
all 25
our 25
cognition 25
reason 25
is 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
considered 25
as 25
an 25
indefinitely 25
extended 25
plane 25
of 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
only 25
a 25
general 25
knowledge 25
it 25
ought 25
rather 25
to 25
be 25
compared 25
to 25
a 25
sphere 25
the 25
radius 25
of 25
which 25
may 25
be 25
found 25
from 25
the 25
curvature 25
of 25
its 25
surfacethat 25
is 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25

synthetical 25

consequently 25
its 25
circumference 25
and 25
extent 25
beyond 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
there 25
are 25
no 25

it 25
can 25
cognize 25
nay 25
even 25
questions 25
regarding 25
such 25
supposititious 25
objects 25
relate 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
subjective 25
principles 25
of 25
a 25
complete 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
relations 25

exist 25
between 25
the 25
understandingconceptions 25
which 25
lie 25
within 25
this 25

we 25

actually 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
a 25

synthetical 25
cognitions 25
as 25
is 25
proved 25
by 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25

any 25
one 25
cannot 25
comprehend 25
the 25
possibility 25

these 25
principles 25
he 25
may 25

doubt 25
whether 25
they 25
are 25

on 25
this 25
account 25
declare 25
them 25
to 25

guidance 25
he 25
can 25
only 25
say 25
if 25
we 25
perceived 25
their 25
origin 25
and 25
their 25
authenticity 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
determine 25
the 25
extent 25
and 25
limits 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
till 25
we 25
can 25
do 25
this 25
all 25
propositions 25
regarding 25
the 25
latter 25
are 25
mere 25
random 25
assertions 25
in 25
this 25
view 25
the 25
doubt 25
respecting 25
all 25
dogmatical 25
philosophy 25
which 25
proceeds 25
without 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
criticism 25
is 25
well 25
grounded 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
deny 25
to 25
reason 25
the 25
ability 25
to 25
construct 25
a 25
sound 25
philosophy 25
when 25
the 25
way 25
has 25
been 25
prepared 25
by 25
a 25
thorough 25
critical 25
investigation 25
all 25
the 25
conceptions 25
produced 25
and 25
all 25
the 25
questions 25
raised 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
do 25
not 25
lie 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
but 25
in 25
that 25
of 25
reason 25
itself 25
and 25
hence 25
they 25
must 25
be 25
solved 25
and 25
shown 25
to 25
be 25
either 25
valid 25
or 25
inadmissible 25
by 25
that 25
faculty 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
right 25
to 25
decline 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
such 25
problems 25
on 25
the 25
ground 25
that 25
the 25
solution 25
can 25
be 25
discovered 25
only 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
things 25
and 25
under 25
pretence 25
of 25
the 25
limitation 25
of 25
human 25
faculties 25
for 25
reason 25
is 25
the 25
sole 25
creator 25
of 25
all 25
these 25
ideas 25
and 25
is 25
therefore 25
bound 25
either 25
to 25
establish 25
their 25
validity 25
or 25
to 25
expose 25
their 25
illusory 25
nature 25
the 25
polemic 25
of 25
scepticism 25
is 25
properly 25
directed 25
against 25
the 25
dogmatist 25
who 25
erects 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
philosophy 25
without 25
having 25
examined 25
the 25
fundamental 25
objective 25
principles 25
on 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
based 25
for 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
evidencing 25
the 25
futility 25
of 25
his 25
designs 25
and 25
thus 25
bringing 25
him 25
to 25
a 25
knowledge 25
of 25
his 25
own 25
powers 25
but 25
in 25
itself 25
scepticism 25
does 25
not 25
give 25
us 25
any 25
certain 25
information 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
our 25
knowledge 25
all 25
unsuccessful 25
dogmatical 25
attempts 25
of 25
reason 25
are 25
facia 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
always 25
useful 25
to 25
submit 25
to 25
the 25
censure 25
of 25
the 25
sceptic 25
but 25
this 25
cannot 25
help 25
us 25
to 25
any 25
decision 25
regarding 25
the 25
expectations 25
which 25
reason 25
cherishes 25
of 25
better 25
success 25
in 25
future 25
endeavours 25
the 25
investigations 25
of 25
scepticism 25
cannot 25
therefore 25
settle 25
the 25
dispute 25
regarding 25
the 25
rights 25
and 25
powers 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
hume 25
is 25
perhaps 25
the 25
ablest 25
and 25
most 25
ingenious 25
of 25
all 25
sceptical 25
philosophers 25
and 25
his 25
writings 25
have 25
undoubtedly 25
exerted 25
the 25
most 25
powerful 25
influence 25
in 25
awakening 25
reason 25
to 25
a 25
thorough 25
investigation 25
into 25
its 25
own 25
powers 25
it 25
will 25
therefore 25
well 25
repay 25
our 25
labours 25
to 25
consider 25
for 25
a 25
little 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
reasoning 25
which 25
he 25
followed 25
and 25
the 25
errors 25
into 25
which 25
he 25
strayed 25
although 25
setting 25
out 25
on 25
the 25
path 25
of 25
truth 25
and 25
certitude 25
hume 25
was 25
probably 25
aware 25
although 25
he 25
never 25
clearly 25
developed 25
the 25
notion 25
that 25
we 25
proceed 25
in 25
judgements 25
of 25
a 25
certain 25
class 25
beyond 25
our 25
conception 25
if 25
the 25
object 25
i 25
have 25
termed 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
judgement 25
synthetical 25
as 25
regard 25
the 25
manner 25
in 25
which 25
i 25
pass 25
beyond 25
my 25
conception 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experience 25
no 25
doubts 25
can 25
be 25
entertained 25
experience 25
is 25
itself 25
a 25
synthesis 25
of 25
perceptions 25
and 25
it 25
employs 25
perceptions 25
to 25
increment 25
the 25
conception 25
which 25
i 25
obtain 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
another 25
perception 25
but 25
we 25
feel 25
persuaded 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
able 25
to 25
proceed 25
beyond 25
a 25
conception 25
and 25
to 25
extend 25
our 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
we 25
attempt 25
this 25
in 25
two 25
wayseither 25
through 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
that 25
which 25
may 25
become 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
or 25
through 25
pure 25
reason 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
such 25
properties 25
of 25
things 25
or 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
things 25
as 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
presented 25
in 25
any 25
experience 25
this 25
sceptical 25
philosopher 25
did 25
not 25
distinguish 25
these 25
two 25
kinds 25
of 25
judgements 25
as 25
he 25
ought 25
to 25
have 25
done 25
but 25
regarded 25
this 25
augmentation 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
if 25
we 25
may 25
so 25
express 25
ourselves 25
the 25
spontaneous 25
generation 25
of 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
independently 25
of 25
the 25
impregnation 25
of 25
experience 25
as 25
altogether 25
impossible 25
the 25
socalled 25
a 25
priori 25
principles 25
of 25
these 25
faculties 25
he 25
consequently 25
held 25
to 25
be 25
invalid 25
and 25
imaginary 25
and 25
regarded 25
them 25
as 25
nothing 25
but 25
subjective 25
habits 25
of 25
thought 25
originating 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
therefore 25
purely 25
empirical 25
and 25
contingent 25
rules 25
to 25
which 25
we 25
attribute 25
a 25
spurious 25
necessity 25
and 25
universality 25
in 25
support 25
of 25
this 25
strange 25
assertion 25
he 25
referred 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
generally 25
acknowledged 25
principle 25
of 25
the 25
relation 25
between 25
cause 25
and 25
effect 25
no 25
faculty 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
can 25
conduct 25
us 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
to 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
something 25
else 25
and 25
hence 25
he 25
believed 25
he 25
could 25
infer 25
that 25
without 25
experience 25
we 25
possess 25
no 25
source 25
from 25
which 25
we 25
can 25
augment 25
a 25
conception 25
and 25
no 25
ground 25
sufficient 25
to 25
justify 25
us 25
in 25
framing 25
a 25
judgement 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
extend 25
our 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
the 25
light 25
of 25
the 25
sun 25
which 25
shines 25
upon 25
a 25
piece 25
of 25
wax 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
melts 25
it 25
while 25
it 25
hardens 25
clay 25
no 25
power 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
could 25
infer 25
from 25
the 25
conceptions 25
which 25
we 25
previously 25
possessed 25
of 25
these 25
substances 25
much 25
less 25
is 25
there 25
any 25
a 25
priori 25
law 25
that 25
could 25
conduct 25
us 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
conclusion 25
which 25
experience 25
alone 25
can 25
certify 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
we 25
have 25
seen 25
in 25
our 25
discussion 25
of 25
transcendental 25
logic 25
that 25
although 25
we 25
can 25
never 25
proceed 25
immediately 25
beyond 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
which 25
is 25
given 25
us 25
we 25
can 25
always 25
cognize 25
completely 25
a 25
prioriin 25
relation 25
however 25
to 25
a 25
third 25
term 25
namely 25
possible 25
experiencethe 25
law 25
of 25
its 25
connection 25
with 25
other 25
things 25
for 25
example 25
if 25
i 25
observe 25
that 25
a 25
piece 25
of 25
wax 25
melts 25
i 25
can 25
cognize 25
a 25
priori 25
that 25
there 25
must 25
have 25
been 25
something 25
the 25
suns 25
heat 25
preceding 25
which 25
this 25
law 25
although 25
without 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
experience 25
i 25
could 25
not 25
cognize 25
a 25
priori 25
and 25
in 25
a 25
determinate 25
manner 25
either 25
the 25
cause 25
from 25
the 25
effect 25
or 25
the 25
effect 25
from 25
the 25
cause 25
hume 25
was 25
therefore 25
wrong 25
in 25
inferring 25
from 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
the 25
determination 25
according 25
to 25
law 25
the 25
contingency 25
of 25
the 25
law 25
itself 25
and 25
the 25
passing 25
beyond 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
which 25
is 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
proceeding 25
constituting 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
conception 25
he 25
confounded 25
with 25
our 25
synthesis 25
of 25
objects 25
in 25
actual 25
experience 25
which 25
is 25
always 25
of 25
course 25
empirical 25
thus 25
too 25
he 25
regarded 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
affinity 25
which 25
has 25
its 25
seat 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
indicates 25
a 25
necessary 25
connection 25
as 25
a 25
mere 25
rule 25
of 25
association 25
lying 25
in 25
the 25
imitative 25
faculty 25
of 25
imagination 25
which 25
can 25
present 25
only 25
contingent 25
and 25
not 25
objective 25
connections 25
the 25
sceptical 25
errors 25
of 25
this 25
remarkably 25
acute 25
thinker 25
arose 25
principally 25
from 25
a 25
defect 25
which 25
was 25
common 25
to 25
him 25
with 25
the 25
dogmatists 25
namely 25
that 25
he 25
had 25
never 25
made 25
a 25
systematic 25
review 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
different 25
kinds 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
synthesis 25
performed 25
by 25
the 25
understanding 25
had 25
he 25
done 25
so 25
he 25
would 25
have 25
found 25
to 25
take 25
one 25
example 25
among 25
many 25
that 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
permanence 25
was 25
of 25
this 25
character 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
causality 25
anticipates 25
experience 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
he 25
might 25
have 25
been 25
able 25
to 25
describe 25
the 25
determinate 25
limits 25
of 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
operations 25
of 25
understanding 25
and 25
reason 25
but 25
he 25
merely 25
declared 25
the 25
understanding 25
to 25
be 25
limited 25
instead 25
of 25
showing 25
what 25
its 25
limits 25
were 25
he 25
created 25
a 25
general 25
mistrust 25
in 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
our 25
faculties 25
without 25
giving 25
us 25
any 25
determinate 25
knowledge 25
of 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
our 25
necessary 25
and 25
unavoidable 25
ignorance 25
he 25
examined 25
and 25
condemned 25
some 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
without 25
investigating 25
all 25
its 25
powers 25
with 25
the 25
completeness 25
necessary 25
to 25
criticism 25
he 25
denies 25
with 25
truth 25
certain 25
powers 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
but 25
he 25
goes 25
further 25
and 25
declares 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
utterly 25
inadequate 25
to 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25

it 25

oneself 25

resist 25
an 25

a 25
complete 25
review 25
of 25
the 25
powers 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
the 25
conviction 25
thence 25
arising 25
that 25
we 25
are 25
in 25
possession 25
of 25
a 25
limited 25
field 25
of 25
action 25
while 25
we 25
must 25
admit 25
the 25
vanity 25
of 25
higher 25
claims 25
puts 25
an 25
end 25
to 25
all 25
doubt 25
and 25
dispute 25
and 25
induces 25
reason 25

rest 25
satisfied 25
with 25
the 25
undisturbed 25
possession 25
of 25
its 25
limited 25
domain 25
to 25
the 25
uncritical 25
dogmatist 25
who 25
has 25
not 25
surveyed 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
his 25
understanding 25
nor 25
determined 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
principles 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
possible 25
cognition 25
who 25
consequently 25
is 25
ignorant 25
of 25
his 25
own 25
powers 25
and 25
believes 25
he 25
will 25
discover 25
them 25
by 25
the 25
attempts 25
he 25
makes 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
cognition 25
these 25
attacks 25
of 25
scepticism 25
are 25
not 25
only 25
dangerous 25
but 25
destructive 25
for 25
if 25
there 25
is 25
one 25
proposition 25
in 25
his 25
chain 25
of 25
reasoning 25
which 25
be 25
he 25
cannot 25
prove 25
or 25
the 25
fallacy 25
in 25
which 25
he 25
cannot 25
evolve 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
a 25
principle 25
suspicion 25
falls 25
on 25
all 25
his 25
statements 25
however 25
plausible 25
they 25
may 25
appear 25
and 25
thus 25
scepticism 25
the 25
bane 25
of 25
dogmatical 25
philosophy 25
conducts 25
us 25
to 25
a 25
sound 25
investigation 25
into 25
the 25
understanding 25
and 25
the 25
reason 25
when 25
we 25
are 25
thus 25
far 25
advanced 25
we 25
need 25
fear 25
no 25
further 25
attacks 25
for 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
our 25
domain 25
are 25
clearly 25
marked 25
out 25
and 25
we 25
can 25
make 25
no 25
claims 25
nor 25
become 25
involved 25
in 25
any 25
disputes 25
regarding 25
the 25
region 25
that 25
lies 25
beyond 25
these 25
limits 25
thus 25
the 25
sceptical 25
procedure 25
in 25
philosophy 25
does 25
not 25
present 25
any 25
solution 25
of 25
the 25
problems 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
it 25
forms 25
an 25
excellent 25
exercise 25
for 25
its 25
powers 25
awakening 25
its 25
circumspection 25
and 25
indicating 25
the 25
means 25
whereby 25
it 25
may 25
most 25
fully 25
establish 25
its 25
claims 25
to 25
its 25
legitimate 25
possessions 25

in 25
hypothesis 25
this 25
critique 25
of 25
reason 25
has 25
now 25
taught 25
us 25
that 25
all 25
its 25
efforts 25
to 25
extend 25
the 25
bounds 25
of 25
knowledge 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
pure 25
speculation 25
are 25
utterly 25
fruitless 25
so 25
much 25
the 25
wider 25
field 25
it 25
may 25
appear 25
lies 25
open 25
to 25
hypothesis 25
as 25
where 25
we 25
cannot 25
know 25
with 25
certainty 25
we 25
are 25
at 25
liberty 25
to 25
make 25
guesses 25
and 25
to 25
form 25
suppositions 25
imagination 25
may 25
be 25
allowed 25
under 25
the 25
strict 25
surveillance 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
invent 25
suppositions 25
but 25
these 25
must 25
be 25
based 25
on 25
something 25
that 25
is 25
perfectly 25
certainand 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
well 25
assured 25
upon 25
this 25
point 25
it 25
is 25
allowable 25
to 25
have 25
recourse 25
to 25
supposition 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
but 25
this 25
supposition 25
must 25
unless 25
it 25
is 25
utterly 25
groundless 25
be 25
connected 25
as 25
its 25
ground 25
of 25
explanation 25
with 25
that 25
which 25
is 25
really 25
given 25
and 25
absolutely 25
certain 25
such 25
a 25
supposition 25
is 25
termed 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
it 25
is 25
beyond 25
our 25
power 25
to 25
form 25
the 25
least 25
conception 25
a 25
priori 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
dynamical 25
connection 25
in 25
phenomena 25
and 25
the 25
category 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
will 25
not 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
excogitate 25
any 25
such 25
connection 25
but 25
merely 25
helps 25
us 25
to 25
understand 25
it 25
when 25
we 25
meet 25
with 25
it 25
in 25
experience 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
we 25
cannot 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
categories 25
imagine 25
or 25
invent 25
any 25
object 25
or 25
any 25
property 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
not 25
given 25
or 25
that 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
given 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
employ 25
it 25
in 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
otherwise 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
basing 25
our 25
chain 25
of 25
reasoning 25
upon 25
mere 25
chimerical 25
fancies 25
and 25
not 25
upon 25
conceptions 25
of 25
things 25
thus 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
right 25
to 25
assume 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
new 25
powers 25
not 25
existing 25

contact 25
or 25
some 25
new 25

substances 25

yet 25
without 25
the 25
property 25

impenetrabilityand 25
consequently 25
we 25
cannot 25

that 25
there 25
is 25
any 25
other 25
kind 25
of 25

among 25
substances 25
than 25
that 25
observable 25
in 25

the 25
only 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
reason 25
cannot 25
venture 25
to 25
form 25
independently 25
of 25
these 25
conditions 25
any 25
conceptions 25
of 25
things 25
because 25
such 25
conceptions 25
although 25
not 25
selfcontradictory 25
are 25
without 25
object 25
and 25
without 25
application 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
are 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
shown 25
mere 25
ideas 25
and 25
do 25
not 25
relate 25
to 25
any 25
object 25
in 25
any 25
kind 25
of 25

are 25
purely 25

if 25
we 25
leave 25

but 25
it 25
would 25
not 25
assist 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
its 25
application 25
to 25
objects 25
order 25
and 25
conformity 25
to 25
aims 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
nature 25
must 25
be 25
themselves 25
explained 25
upon 25
natural 25
grounds 25
and 25
according 25
to 25
natural 25
laws 25
and 25
the 25
wildest 25
hypotheses 25
if 25
they 25
are 25
only 25
physical 25
are 25
here 25
more 25
admissible 25
than 25
a 25
hyperphysical 25
hypothesis 25
such 25
as 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
divine 25
author 25
for 25
such 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
would 25
introduce 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
ignava 25
ratio 25
which 25
requires 25
us 25
to 25
give 25
up 25
the 25
search 25
for 25
causes 25
that 25
might 25
be 25
discovered 25
in 25
the 25
course 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
to 25
rest 25
satisfied 25
with 25
a 25
mere 25
idea 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
absolute 25
totality 25
of 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
explanation 25
in 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
these 25
causes 25
this 25
can 25
be 25
no 25
hindrance 25
to 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
phenomena 25
because 25
as 25
they 25
are 25
to 25
us 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
phenomena 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
right 25
to 25
look 25
for 25
anything 25
like 25
completeness 25
in 25
the 25
synthesis 25
of 25
the 25
series 25
of 25
their 25
conditions 25
transcendental 25
hypotheses 25
are 25
therefore 25
inadmissible 25
and 25
we 25
cannot 25
use 25
the 25
liberty 25
of 25
employing 25
in 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
physical 25
hyperphysical 25
grounds 25
of 25
explanation 25
and 25
this 25
for 25
two 25
reasons 25
first 25
because 25
such 25
hypothesis 25
do 25
not 25
advance 25
reason 25
but 25
rather 25
stop 25
it 25
in 25
its 25
progress 25
secondly 25
because 25
this 25
licence 25
would 25
render 25
fruitless 25
all 25
its 25
exertions 25
in 25
its 25
own 25
proper 25
sphere 25
which 25
is 25
that 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
when 25
the 25
explanation 25
of 25
natural 25
phenomena 25
happens 25
to 25
be 25
difficult 25
we 25
have 25
constantly 25
at 25
hand 25
a 25
transcendental 25
ground 25
of 25
explanation 25
which 25
lifts 25
us 25
above 25
the 25
necessity 25
of 25
investigating 25
nature 25
and 25
our 25
inquiries 25
are 25
brought 25
to 25
a 25
close 25
not 25
because 25
we 25
have 25
obtained 25
all 25
the 25
requisite 25
knowledge 25
but 25
because 25
we 25
abut 25
upon 25
a 25
principle 25
which 25
is 25
incomprehensible 25
and 25
which 25
indeed 25
is 25
so 25
far 25
back 25
in 25
the 25
track 25
of 25
thought 25
as 25
to 25
contain 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
absolutely 25
primal 25
being 25
the 25
next 25
requisite 25
for 25
the 25
admissibility 25
of 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
is 25
its 25
sufficiency 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
must 25
determine 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
consequences 25
which 25
are 25
given 25
in 25
experience 25
and 25
which 25
are 25
supposed 25
to 25
follow 25
from 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
itself 25
if 25
we 25
require 25
to 25
employ 25
auxiliary 25
hypotheses 25
the 25
suspicion 25
naturally 25
arises 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
mere 25
fictions 25
because 25
the 25
necessity 25
for 25
each 25
of 25
them 25
requires 25
the 25
same 25
justification 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
the 25
original 25
hypothesis 25
and 25
thus 25
their 25
testimony 25
is 25
invalid 25
if 25
we 25
suppose 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
an 25
infinitely 25
perfect 25
cause 25
we 25
possess 25
sufficient 25
grounds 25
for 25
the 25
explanation 25
of 25
the 25
conformity 25
to 25
aims 25
the 25
order 25
and 25
the 25
greatness 25
which 25
we 25
observe 25
in 25
the 25
universe 25
but 25
we 25
find 25
ourselves 25
obliged 25
when 25
we 25
observe 25
the 25
evil 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
the 25
exceptions 25
to 25
these 25
laws 25
to 25
employ 25
new 25
hypothesis 25
in 25
support 25
of 25
the 25
original 25
one 25
we 25
employ 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
soul 25
as 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
theories 25
we 25
may 25
form 25
of 25
its 25
phenomena 25
but 25
when 25
we 25
meet 25
with 25
difficulties 25
in 25
our 25
way 25
when 25
we 25
observe 25
in 25
the 25
soul 25
phenomena 25
similar 25
to 25
the 25
changes 25
which 25
take 25
place 25
in 25
matter 25
we 25
require 25
to 25
call 25
in 25
new 25
auxiliary 25
hypotheses 25
these 25
may 25
indeed 25
not 25
be 25
false 25
but 25
we 25
do 25
not 25
know 25
them 25
to 25
be 25
true 25
because 25
the 25
only 25
witness 25
to 25
their 25
certitude 25
is 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
which 25
they 25
themselves 25
have 25
been 25
called 25
in 25
to 25
explain 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
discussing 25
the 25
abovementioned 25
assertions 25
regarding 25
the 25
immaterial 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
and 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
as 25
dogmata 25
which 25
certain 25
philosophers 25
profess 25
to 25
demonstrate 25
a 25
priori 25
but 25
purely 25
as 25
hypotheses 25
in 25
the 25
former 25
case 25
the 25
dogmatist 25
must 25
take 25
care 25
that 25
his 25
arguments 25
possess 25
the 25
apodeictic 25
certainty 25
of 25
a 25
demonstration 25
for 25
the 25
assertion 25
that 25
the 25
reality 25
of 25
such 25
ideas 25
is 25
probable 25
is 25
as 25
absurd 25
as 25
a 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
probability 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
in 25
geometry 25
pure 25
abstract 25
reason 25
apart 25
from 25
all 25
experience 25
can 25
either 25
cognize 25
nothing 25
at 25
all 25
and 25
hence 25
the 25
judgements 25
it 25
enounces 25
are 25
never 25
mere 25
opinions 25
they 25
are 25
either 25
apodeictic 25
certainties 25
or 25
declarations 25
that 25
nothing 25
can 25
be 25
known 25
on 25
the 25
subject 25
opinions 25
and 25
probable 25
judgements 25
on 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
things 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
employed 25
to 25
explain 25
given 25
phenomena 25
or 25
they 25
may 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
effect 25

accordance 25
with 25
empirical 25
laws 25
of 25
an 25
actually 25
existing 25
cause 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
we 25
must 25
restrict 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
opinion 25
to 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
nature 25

this 25
region 25
opinion 25
is 25
mere 25
invention 25
unless 25
we 25
are 25
groping 25
about 25
for 25
the 25
truth 25
on 25
a 25
path 25
not 25
yet 25
fully 25
known 25

some 25
hopes 25
of 25
stumbling 25
upon 25

to 25
say 25

dogmatism 25

the 25
defence 25
of 25
statements 25
of 25

not 25

an 25
attempt 25
at 25
discovering 25
new 25
grounds 25
for 25
their 25

but 25
merely 25
the 25
refutation 25
of 25
the 25
arguments 25
of 25
opponents 25

a 25
priori 25
synthetical 25

the 25
peculiarity 25
that 25

the 25

of 25
the 25
opposite 25
this 25

the 25

to 25
the 25

in 25
the 25

this 25
sphere 25
accordingly 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
proper 25
arena 25
of 25
these 25
endless 25
speculative 25
conflicts 25
but 25
we 25
shall 25
afterwards 25
show 25
that 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
its 25
practical 25
exercise 25
reason 25
has 25
the 25
right 25
of 25
admitting 25
what 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
pure 25
speculation 25
she 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
justified 25
in 25
supposing 25
except 25
upon 25
perfectly 25
sufficient 25
grounds 25
because 25
all 25
such 25
suppositions 25
destroy 25
the 25
necessary 25
completeness 25
of 25
speculationa 25
condition 25
which 25
the 25
practical 25
reason 25
however 25
does 25
not 25
consider 25
to 25
be 25
requisite 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
therefore 25

is 25
mistress 25
of 25

fact 25
she 25
could 25
not 25
do 25
the 25
burden 25
of 25
proof 25
accordingly 25
rests 25
upon 25
the 25
opponent 25
but 25
as 25
he 25
has 25
just 25
as 25
little 25
knowledge 25
regarding 25

of 25

is 25
an 25
advantage 25
on 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
the 25

the 25

in 25
favour 25
of 25
his 25
own 25

to 25
show 25
that 25
his 25

no 25
more 25
than 25
himself 25

we 25
have 25
to 25
fear 25
lie 25
in 25
ourselves 25
they 25
are 25
like 25
old 25
but 25
never 25
superannuated 25
claims 25
and 25
we 25
must 25
seek 25
them 25
out 25
and 25
settle 25
them 25
once 25
and 25
for 25
ever 25
if 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
expect 25
a 25
permanent 25
peace 25
external 25
tranquility 25
is 25
hollow 25
and 25
unreal 25
the 25
root 25
of 25
these 25
contradictions 25
which 25
lies 25
in 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
must 25
be 25
destroyed 25
and 25
this 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
done 25
by 25
giving 25
it 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
instance 25
freedom 25
to 25
grow 25
nay 25
by 25
nourishing 25
it 25
that 25
it 25
may 25
send 25
out 25
shoots 25
and 25
thus 25
betray 25
its 25
own 25
existence 25
it 25
is 25
our 25
duty 25
therefore 25
to 25
try 25
to 25
discover 25
new 25
objections 25
to 25
put 25
weapons 25
in 25
the 25
bands 25
of 25
our 25
opponent 25
and 25
to 25
grant 25
him 25
the 25
most 25
favourable 25
position 25
in 25
the 25
arena 25
that 25
he 25
can 25
wish 25
we 25
have 25
nothing 25
to 25
fear 25
from 25
these 25
concessions 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
we 25
may 25
rather 25
hope 25
that 25
we 25
shall 25
thus 25
make 25
ourselves 25
master 25
of 25
a 25
possession 25
which 25
no 25
one 25
will 25
ever 25
venture 25
to 25
dispute 25
the 25
thinker 25
requires 25
to 25
be 25
fully 25
equipped 25
the 25
hypotheses 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
which 25
although 25
but 25
leaden 25
weapons 25
for 25
they 25
have 25
not 25
been 25
steeled 25
in 25
the 25
armoury 25
of 25
experience 25
are 25
as 25
useful 25
as 25
any 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
employed 25
by 25
his 25
opponents 25
if 25
accordingly 25
we 25
have 25
assumed 25
from 25
a 25
nonspeculative 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
the 25
immaterial 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
and 25
are 25
met 25
by 25
the 25
objection 25
that 25
experience 25
seems 25
to 25
prove 25
that 25
the 25
growth 25
and 25
decay 25
of 25
our 25
mental 25
faculties 25
are 25
mere 25
modifications 25
of 25
the 25
sensuous 25
organismwe 25
can 25
weaken 25
the 25
force 25
of 25
this 25
objection 25
by 25
the 25
assumption 25
that 25
the 25
body 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
fundamental 25
phenomenon 25
to 25
which 25
as 25
a 25
necessary 25
condition 25
all 25
sensibility 25
and 25
consequently 25
all 25
thought 25
relates 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
state 25
of 25
our 25
existence 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
separation 25
of 25
soul 25
and 25
body 25
forms 25
the 25
conclusion 25
of 25
the 25
sensuous 25
exercise 25
of 25
our 25
power 25
of 25
cognition 25
and 25
the 25
beginning 25
of 25
the 25
intellectual 25
the 25
body 25
would 25
in 25
this 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
be 25
regarded 25
not 25
as 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
thought 25
but 25
merely 25
as 25
its 25
restrictive 25
condition 25
as 25
promotive 25
of 25
the 25
sensuous 25
and 25
animal 25
but 25
as 25
a 25
hindrance 25
to 25
the 25
pure 25
and 25
spiritual 25
life 25
and 25
the 25
dependence 25
of 25
the 25
animal 25
life 25
on 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
the 25
body 25
would 25
not 25
prove 25
that 25
the 25
whole 25
life 25
of 25
man 25
was 25
also 25
dependent 25
on 25
the 25
state 25
of 25
the 25
organism 25
we 25
might 25
go 25
still 25
farther 25
and 25
discover 25
new 25
objections 25
or 25
carry 25
out 25
to 25
their 25
extreme 25
consequences 25
those 25
which 25
have 25
already 25
been 25
adduced 25
generation 25
in 25
the 25
human 25
race 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
among 25
the 25
irrational 25
animals 25
depends 25
on 25
so 25
many 25
accidentsof 25

of 25
proper 25
sustenance 25
of 25
the 25
laws 25
enacted 25
by 25
the 25
government 25
of 25
a 25
country 25
of 25
vice 25
even 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
difficult 25
to 25
believe 25
in 25
the 25
eternal 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
being 25
whose 25
life 25
has 25
begun 25
under 25
circumstances 25
so 25
mean 25
and 25
trivial 25
and 25
so 25
entirely 25
dependent 25
upon 25
our 25
own 25
control 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
continuance 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
race 25
we 25
need 25
have 25
no 25

accident 25
in 25
single 25
cases 25
is 25
subject 25
to 25
general 25
laws 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
each 25
individual 25
it 25
would 25
seem 25
as 25
if 25
we 25
could 25
hardly 25
expect 25
so 25
wonderful 25
an 25
effect 25
from 25
causes 25
so 25
insignificant 25
but 25
in 25
answer 25
to 25
these 25
objections 25
we 25
may 25
adduce 25
the 25
transcendental 25
hypothesis 25
that 25
all 25
life 25
is 25
properly 25
intelligible 25
and 25
not 25
subject 25
to 25
changes 25
of 25
time 25
and 25
that 25
it 25
neither 25
began 25
in 25
birth 25
nor 25
will 25
end 25
in 25
death 25
we 25
may 25
assume 25
that 25
this 25
life 25
is 25
nothing 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
sensuous 25
representation 25
of 25
pure 25
spiritual 25
life 25
that 25
the 25
whole 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
is 25
but 25
an 25
image 25
hovering 25
before 25
the 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
which 25
we 25
exercise 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
and 25
with 25
no 25
more 25
objective 25
reality 25
than 25
a 25
dream 25
and 25
that 25
if 25
we 25
could 25
intuite 25
ourselves 25
and 25
other 25
things 25
as 25
they 25
really 25
are 25
we 25
should 25
see 25
ourselves 25
in 25
a 25
world 25
of 25
spiritual 25
natures 25
our 25
connection 25
with 25
which 25
did 25
not 25
begin 25
at 25
our 25
birth 25
and 25
will 25
not 25
cease 25
with 25
the 25
destruction 25
of 25
the 25
body 25
and 25
so 25
on 25
we 25
cannot 25
be 25
said 25
to 25
know 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
above 25
asserted 25
nor 25
do 25
we 25
seriously 25
maintain 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
these 25
assertions 25
and 25
the 25
notions 25
therein 25
indicated 25
are 25
not 25
even 25
ideas 25
of 25
reason 25
they 25
are 25
purely 25
fictitious 25
conceptions 25
but 25
this 25
hypothetical 25
procedure 25
is 25
in 25
perfect 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
reason 25
our 25
opponent 25
mistakes 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
for 25
a 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
complete 25
impossibility 25
of 25
all 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
asserted 25
and 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
show 25
him 25
that 25
he 25
has 25
not 25
exhausted 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
possibility 25
and 25
that 25
he 25
can 25
as 25
little 25
compass 25
that 25
sphere 25
by 25
the 25
laws 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
nature 25
as 25
we 25
can 25
lay 25
a 25
secure 25
foundation 25
for 25
the 25
operations 25
of 25
reason 25
beyond 25
the 25
region 25
of 25
experience 25
such 25
hypothetical 25
defences 25
against 25
the 25
pretensions 25
of 25
an 25
opponent 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
declarations 25
of 25
opinion 25
the 25
philosopher 25
abandons 25
them 25
so 25
soon 25
as 25
the 25
opposite 25
party 25
renounces 25
its 25
dogmatical 25
conceit 25
to 25
maintain 25
a 25
simply 25
negative 25
position 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
propositions 25
which 25
rest 25
on 25
an 25
insecure 25
foundation 25
well 25
befits 25
the 25
moderation 25
of 25
a 25
true 25
philosopher 25
but 25
to 25
uphold 25
the 25
objections 25
urged 25
against 25
an 25
opponent 25
as 25
proofs 25
of 25
the 25
opposite 25
statement 25
is 25
a 25
proceeding 25
just 25
as 25
unwarrantable 25
and 25
arrogant 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
attack 25
the 25
position 25
of 25
a 25
philosopher 25
who 25
advances 25
affirmative 25
propositions 25
regarding 25
such 25
a 25
subject 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
therefore 25
that 25
hypotheses 25
in 25
the 25
speculative 25
sphere 25
are 25
valid 25
not 25
as 25
independent 25
propositions 25
but 25
only 25
relatively 25
to 25
opposite 25
transcendent 25
assumptions 25

to 25
make 25
the 25
principles 25

possible 25
experience 25
conditions 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
in 25
general 25
is 25
just 25
as 25
transcendent 25
a 25
procedure 25
as 25
to 25
maintain 25
the 25
objective 25
reality 25
of 25
ideas 25
which 25
can 25
be 25
applied 25
to 25

objects 25

possible 25

the 25
judgements 25
enounced 25
by 25

must 25
be 25
necessary 25
or 25
they 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
enounced 25
at 25
all 25
reason 25
cannot 25
trouble 25
herself 25
with 25
opinions 25
but 25
the 25
hypotheses 25
we 25
have 25
been 25
discussing 25
are 25
merely 25
problematical 25
judgements 25
which 25
can 25
neither 25
be 25
confuted 25

proved 25

therefore 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
personal 25
opinions 25
they 25
are 25
indispensable 25

answers 25
to 25
objections 25
which 25
are 25
liable 25
to 25
be 25
raised 25

we 25
must 25
take 25
care 25
to 25
confine 25
them 25
to 25
this 25
function 25
and 25
guard 25
against 25
any 25
assumption 25
on 25
their 25
part 25
of 25
absolute 25
validity 25
a 25

case 25
all 25
our 25
conclusions 25
may 25
be 25
drawn 25
immediately 25
from 25
pure 25
intuition 25
in 25
transcendental 25
cognition 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
we 25
are 25
dealing 25
only 25
with 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
we 25
are 25
guided 25
by 25
possible 25
experience 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
a 25
proof 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
transcendental 25
cognition 25
does 25
not 25
show 25
that 25
the 25
given 25
conception 25
that 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
for 25
example 25
leads 25
directly 25
to 25
another 25
conception 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
causefor 25
this 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
saltus 25
which 25
nothing 25
can 25
justify 25
but 25
it 25
shows 25
that 25
experience 25
itself 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
experience 25
is 25
impossible 25
without 25
the 25
connection 25
indicated 25
by 25
these 25
conceptions 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
proof 25
must 25
demonstrate 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
arriving 25
synthetically 25
and 25
a 25
priori 25
at 25
a 25
certain 25
knowledge 25
of 25
things 25
which 25
was 25
not 25
contained 25
in 25
our 25
conceptions 25
of 25
these 25
things 25
unless 25
we 25
pay 25
particular 25
attention 25
to 25
this 25
requirement 25
our 25
proofs 25
instead 25
of 25
pursuing 25
the 25
straight 25
path 25
indicated 25
by 25
reason 25
follow 25
the 25
tortuous 25
road 25
of 25
mere 25
subjective 25
association 25
the 25
illusory 25
conviction 25
which 25
rests 25
upon 25
subjective 25
causes 25
of 25
association 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
considered 25
as 25
resulting 25
from 25
the 25
perception 25
of 25
a 25
real 25
and 25
objective 25
natural 25
affinity 25
is 25
always 25
open 25
to 25
doubt 25
and 25
suspicion 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
all 25
the 25
attempts 25
which 25
have 25
been 25
made 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
principle 25
of 25
sufficient 25
reason 25
have 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
universal 25
admission 25
of 25
philosophers 25
been 25
quite 25
unsuccessful 25
and 25
before 25
the 25
appearance 25
of 25
transcendental 25
criticism 25
it 25
was 25
considered 25
better 25
as 25
this 25
principle 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
abandoned 25
to 25
appeal 25
boldly 25
to 25
the 25
common 25
sense 25
of 25
mankind 25
a 25
proceeding 25
which 25
always 25
proves 25
that 25
the 25
problem 25
which 25
reason 25
ought 25
to 25
solve 25
is 25
one 25
in 25
which 25
philosophers 25
find 25
great 25
difficulties 25
rather 25
than 25
attempt 25
to 25
discover 25
new 25
dogmatical 25
proofs 25
but 25
if 25
the 25
proposition 25
to 25
be 25
proved 25
is 25
a 25
proposition 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
if 25
i 25
aim 25
at 25
passing 25
beyond 25
my 25
empirical 25
conceptions 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
mere 25
ideas 25
it 25
is 25
necessary 25
that 25
the 25
proof 25
should 25
first 25
show 25
that 25
such 25
a 25
step 25
in 25
synthesis 25
is 25
possible 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
before 25
it 25
proceeds 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
proposition 25
itself 25
the 25
socalled 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
simple 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
from 25
the 25
unity 25
of 25
apperception 25
is 25
a 25
very 25
plausible 25
one 25
but 25
it 25
contains 25
no 25
answer 25
to 25
the 25
objection 25
that 25
as 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
absolute 25
simplicity 25
is 25
not 25
a 25
conception 25
which 25
is 25
directly 25
applicable 25
to 25
a 25
perception 25
but 25
is 25
an 25
idea 25
which 25
must 25
be 25
inferredif 25
at 25
allfrom 25
observation 25
it 25
is 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
evident 25
how 25
the 25
mere 25
fact 25
of 25
consciousness 25
which 25
is 25
contained 25
in 25
all 25
thought 25
although 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
a 25
simple 25
representation 25
can 25
conduct 25
me 25
to 25
the 25
consciousness 25
and 25
cognition 25
of 25
a 25
thing 25
which 25
is 25
purely 25
a 25
thinking 25
substance 25
when 25
i 25
represent 25
to 25
my 25
mind 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
my 25
body 25
as 25
in 25
motion 25
my 25
body 25
in 25
this 25
thought 25
is 25
so 25
far 25
absolute 25
unity 25
and 25
my 25
representation 25
of 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
simple 25
one 25
and 25
hence 25
i 25
can 25
indicate 25
this 25
representation 25
by 25
the 25
motion 25
of 25
a 25
point 25
because 25
i 25
have 25
made 25
abstraction 25
of 25
the 25
size 25
or 25
volume 25
of 25
the 25
body 25
but 25
i 25
cannot 25
hence 25
infer 25
that 25
given 25
merely 25
the 25
moving 25
power 25
of 25
a 25
body 25
the 25
body 25
may 25
be 25
cogitated 25
as 25
simple 25
substance 25
merely 25
because 25
the 25
representation 25
in 25
my 25
mind 25
takes 25
no 25
account 25
of 25
its 25
content 25
in 25
space 25
and 25
is 25
consequently 25
simple 25
the 25
simple 25
in 25
abstraction 25
is 25
very 25
different 25
from 25
the 25
objectively 25
simple 25
and 25
hence 25
the 25
ego 25
which 25
is 25
simple 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
sense 25
may 25
in 25
the 25
second 25
sense 25
as 25
indicating 25
the 25
soul 25
itself 25
be 25
a 25
very 25
complex 25
conception 25
with 25
a 25
very 25
various 25
content 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
in 25
all 25
such 25
arguments 25
there 25
lurks 25
a 25
paralogism 25
we 25
guess 25
for 25
without 25
some 25
such 25
surmise 25
our 25
suspicion 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
excited 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
a 25
proof 25
of 25
this 25
character 25
at 25
the 25
presence 25
of 25
the 25
paralogism 25
by 25
keeping 25
ever 25
before 25
us 25
a 25
criterion 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
those 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
which 25
aim 25
at 25
proving 25
more 25
than 25
experience 25
can 25
teach 25
us 25
this 25
criterion 25
is 25
obtained 25
from 25
the 25
observation 25
that 25
such 25
proofs 25
do 25
not 25
lead 25
us 25
directly 25
from 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
the 25
proposition 25
to 25
be 25
proved 25
to 25
the 25
required 25
predicate 25
but 25
find 25
it 25
necessary 25
to 25
presuppose 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
extending 25
our 25
cognition 25
a 25
priori 25
by 25
means 25
of 25
ideas 25
we 25
must 25
accordingly 25
always 25
use 25
the 25
greatest 25
caution 25
we 25
require 25
before 25
attempting 25
any 25
proof 25
to 25
consider 25
how 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
extend 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
cognition 25
by 25
the 25
operations 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
from 25
what 25
source 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
derive 25
knowledge 25
which 25
is 25
not 25
obtained 25
from 25
the 25
analysis 25
of 25
conceptions 25
nor 25
relates 25
by 25
anticipation 25
to 25
possible 25
experience 25
we 25
shall 25
thus 25
spare 25
ourselves 25
much 25
severe 25
and 25
fruitless 25
labour 25
by 25
not 25
expecting 25
from 25
reason 25
what 25
is 25
beyond 25
its 25
power 25
or 25
rather 25
by 25
subjecting 25
it 25
to 25
discipline 25
and 25
teaching 25
it 25
to 25
moderate 25
its 25
vehement 25
desires 25
for 25
the 25
extension 25
of 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
cognition 25
the 25
first 25
rule 25
for 25
our 25
guidance 25
is 25
therefore 25
not 25
to 25
attempt 25
a 25
transcendental 25
proof 25
before 25
we 25
have 25
considered 25
from 25
what 25
source 25
we 25
are 25
to 25
derive 25
the 25
principles 25
upon 25
which 25
the 25
proof 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
based 25
and 25
what 25
right 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
expect 25
that 25
our 25
conclusions 25
from 25
these 25
principles 25
will 25
be 25
veracious 25
if 25
they 25
are 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
it 25
is 25
vain 25
to 25
expect 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
attain 25
by 25
their 25
means 25
to 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
for 25
these 25
principles 25
are 25
valid 25
only 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
objects 25
of 25
possible 25
experience 25
if 25
they 25
are 25
principles 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
our 25
labour 25
is 25
alike 25
in 25
vain 25
for 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
if 25
employed 25
as 25
objective 25
are 25
without 25
exception 25
dialectical 25
and 25
possess 25
no 25
validity 25
or 25
truth 25
except 25
as 25
regulative 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
employment 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
experience 25
but 25
when 25
such 25
delusive 25
proof 25
are 25
presented 25
to 25
us 25
it 25
is 25
our 25
duty 25
to 25
meet 25
them 25
with 25
the 25
non 25
liquet 25
of 25
a 25
matured 25
judgement 25
and 25
although 25
we 25
are 25
unable 25
to 25
expose 25
the 25
particular 25
sophism 25
upon 25
which 25
the 25
proof 25
is 25
based 25
we 25
have 25
a 25
right 25
to 25
demand 25
a 25
deduction 25
of 25
the 25
principles 25
employed 25
in 25
it 25
and 25
if 25
these 25
principles 25
have 25
their 25
origin 25
in 25
pure 25
reason 25
alone 25
such 25
a 25
deduction 25
is 25
absolutely 25
impossible 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
unnecessary 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
trouble 25
ourselves 25
with 25
the 25
exposure 25
and 25
confutation 25
of 25
every 25
sophistical 25
illusion 25
we 25
may 25
at 25
once 25
bring 25
all 25
dialectic 25
which 25
is 25
inexhaustible 25
in 25
the 25
production 25
of 25
fallacies 25
before 25
the 25
bar 25
of 25
critical 25
reason 25
which 25
tests 25
the 25
principles 25
upon 25
which 25
all 25
dialectical 25
procedure 25
is 25
based 25
the 25
second 25
peculiarity 25
of 25
transcendental 25
proof 25
is 25
that 25
a 25
transcendental 25
proposition 25
cannot 25
rest 25
upon 25
more 25
than 25
a 25
single 25
proof 25
if 25
i 25
am 25
drawing 25
conclusions 25
not 25
from 25
conceptions 25
but 25
from 25
intuition 25
corresponding 25
to 25
a 25
conception 25
be 25
it 25
pure 25
intuition 25
as 25
in 25
mathematics 25
or 25
empirical 25
as 25
in 25
natural 25
science 25
the 25
intuition 25
which 25
forms 25
the 25
basis 25
of 25
my 25
inferences 25
presents 25
me 25
with 25
materials 25
for 25
many 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
which 25
i 25
can 25
connect 25
in 25
various 25
modes 25
while 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
allowable 25
to 25
proceed 25
from 25
different 25
points 25
in 25
the 25
intention 25
i 25
can 25
arrive 25
by 25
different 25
paths 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
proposition 25
but 25
every 25
transcendental 25
proposition 25
sets 25
out 25
from 25
a 25
conception 25
and 25
posits 25
the 25
synthetical 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
according 25
to 25
this 25
conception 25
there 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
but 25
one 25
ground 25
of 25
proof 25
because 25
it 25
is 25
the 25
conception 25
alone 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
object 25
and 25
thus 25
the 25
proof 25
cannot 25
contain 25
anything 25
more 25
than 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
object 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
in 25
our 25
transcendental 25
analytic 25
for 25
example 25
we 25
inferred 25
the 25
principle 25
every 25
event 25
has 25
a 25
cause 25
from 25
the 25
only 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
objective 25
possibility 25
of 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
this 25
is 25
that 25
an 25
event 25
cannot 25
be 25
determined 25
in 25
time 25
and 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
form 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
experience 25
unless 25
it 25
stands 25
under 25
this 25
dynamical 25
law 25
this 25
is 25
the 25
only 25
possible 25
ground 25
of 25
proof 25
for 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
event 25
possesses 25
objective 25
validity 25
that 25
is 25
is 25
a 25
true 25
conception 25
only 25
because 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
causality 25
determines 25
an 25
object 25
to 25
which 25
it 25
can 25
refer 25
other 25
arguments 25
in 25
support 25
of 25
this 25
principle 25
have 25
been 25
attemptedsuch 25
as 25
that 25
from 25
the 25
contingent 25
nature 25
of 25
a 25
phenomenon 25
but 25
when 25
this 25
argument 25
is 25
considered 25
we 25
can 25
discover 25
no 25
criterion 25
of 25
contingency 25
except 25
the 25
fact 25
of 25
an 25
eventof 25
something 25
happening 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
the 25
existence 25
which 25
is 25
preceded 25
by 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
an 25
object 25
and 25
thus 25
we 25
fall 25
back 25
on 25
the 25
very 25
thing 25
to 25
be 25
proved 25
if 25
the 25
proposition 25
every 25
thinking 25
being 25
is 25
simple 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
proved 25
we 25
keep 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
ego 25
which 25
is 25
simple 25
and 25
to 25
which 25
all 25
thought 25
has 25
a 25
relation 25
the 25
same 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
transcendental 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
deity 25
which 25
is 25
based 25
solely 25
upon 25
the 25
harmony 25
and 25
reciprocal 25
fitness 25
of 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
an 25
ens 25
realissimum 25
and 25
a 25
necessary 25
being 25
and 25
cannot 25
be 25
attempted 25
in 25
any 25
other 25
manner 25
this 25
caution 25
serves 25
to 25
simplify 25
very 25
much 25
the 25
criticism 25
of 25
all 25
propositions 25
of 25
reason 25
when 25
reason 25
employs 25
conceptions 25
alone 25
only 25
one 25
proof 25
of 25
its 25
thesis 25
is 25
possible 25
if 25
any 25
when 25
therefore 25
the 25
dogmatist 25
advances 25
with 25
ten 25
arguments 25
in 25
favour 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
we 25
may 25
be 25
sure 25
that 25
not 25
one 25
of 25
them 25
is 25
conclusive 25
for 25
if 25
he 25
possessed 25
one 25
which 25
proved 25
the 25
proposition 25
he 25
brings 25
forward 25
to 25
demonstration 25
as 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
propositions 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
what 25
need 25
is 25
there 25
for 25
any 25
more 25
his 25
intention 25
can 25
only 25
be 25
similar 25
to 25
that 25
of 25
the 25
advocate 25
who 25
had 25
different 25
arguments 25
for 25
different 25
judges 25
this 25
availing 25
himself 25
of 25
the 25
weakness 25
of 25
those 25
who 25
examine 25
his 25
arguments 25
who 25
without 25
going 25
into 25
any 25
profound 25
investigation 25
adopt 25
the 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
case 25
which 25
seems 25
most 25
probable 25
at 25
first 25
sight 25
and 25
decide 25
according 25
to 25
it 25
the 25
third 25
rule 25
for 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
conduct 25
of 25
a 25
proof 25
is 25
that 25
all 25
transcendental 25
proofs 25
must 25
never 25
be 25
apagogic 25
or 25
indirect 25
but 25
always 25
ostensive 25
or 25
direct 25
the 25
direct 25
or 25
ostensive 25
proof 25
not 25
only 25
establishes 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
proposition 25
to 25
be 25
proved 25
but 25
exposes 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
its 25
truth 25
the 25
apagogic 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
may 25
assure 25
us 25
of 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
proposition 25
but 25
it 25
cannot 25
enable 25
us 25
to 25
comprehend 25
the 25
grounds 25
of 25
its 25
possibility 25
the 25
latter 25
is 25
accordingly 25
rather 25
an 25
auxiliary 25
to 25
an 25
argument 25
than 25
a 25
strictly 25
philosophical 25
and 25
rational 25
mode 25
of 25
procedure 25
in 25
one 25
respect 25
however 25
they 25
have 25
an 25
advantage 25
over 25
direct 25
proofs 25
from 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
the 25
mode 25
of 25
arguing 25
by 25
contradiction 25
which 25
they 25
employ 25
renders 25
our 25
understanding 25
of 25
the 25
question 25
more 25
clear 25
and 25
approximates 25
the 25
proof 25
to 25
the 25
certainty 25
of 25
an 25
intuitional 25
demonstration 25
the 25
true 25
reason 25
why 25
indirect 25
proofs 25
are 25
employed 25
in 25
different 25
sciences 25
is 25
this 25
when 25
the 25
grounds 25
upon 25
which 25
we 25
seek 25
to 25
base 25
a 25
cognition 25
are 25
too 25
various 25
or 25
too 25
profound 25
we 25
try 25
whether 25
or 25
not 25
we 25
may 25
not 25
discover 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
our 25
cognition 25
from 25
its 25
consequences 25
the 25
modus 25
ponens 25
of 25
reasoning 25
from 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
its 25
inferences 25
to 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
would 25
be 25
admissible 25
if 25
all 25
the 25
inferences 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
drawn 25
from 25
it 25
are 25
known 25
to 25
be 25
true 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
there 25
can 25
be 25
only 25
one 25
possible 25
ground 25
for 25
these 25
inferences 25
and 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
true 25
one 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
a 25
quite 25
impracticable 25
procedure 25
as 25
it 25
surpasses 25
all 25
our 25
powers 25

discover 25
all 25
the 25
possible 25
inferences 25
that 25
can 25
be 25
drawn 25
from 25
a 25
proposition 25
but 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
reasoning 25
is 25
employed 25
under 25
favour 25
when 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
prove 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
an 25
hypothesis 25
in 25
which 25
case 25
we 25
admit 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
conclusion 25
which 25
is 25
supported 25
by 25
analogythat 25
if 25
all 25
the 25
inferences 25
we 25
have 25
drawn 25

examined 25
agree 25
with 25
the 25
proposition 25
assumed 25
all 25
other 25
possible 25
inferences 25
will 25
also 25
agree 25
with 25
it 25

in 25
this 25
way 25
an 25
hypothesis 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
established 25
as 25
a 25

the 25
modus 25

of 25
reasoning 25
from 25
known 25
inferences 25
to 25
the 25
unknown 25
proposition 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
a 25
rigorous 25
but 25
a 25
very 25
easy 25
mode 25
of 25
proof 25
for 25
if 25
it 25
can 25
be 25
shown 25
that 25
but 25
one 25
inference 25
from 25
a 25
proposition 25
is 25
false 25
then 25
the 25
proposition 25
must 25
itself 25
be 25
false 25
instead 25
then 25
of 25
examining 25
in 25
an 25
ostensive 25
argument 25
the 25
whole 25
series 25
of 25
the 25
grounds 25
on 25
which 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
a 25
proposition 25
rests 25
we 25
need 25
only 25
take 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
this 25
proposition 25
and 25
if 25
one 25
inference 25
from 25
it 25
be 25
false 25
then 25
must 25
the 25
opposite 25
be 25
itself 25
false 25
and 25
consequently 25
the 25
proposition 25
which 25
we 25
wished 25
to 25
prove 25
must 25
be 25
true 25
the 25
apagogic 25
method 25
of 25
proof 25
is 25
admissible 25
only 25
in 25
those 25
sciences 25
where 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
to 25
mistake 25
a 25
subjective 25
representation 25
for 25
an 25
objective 25
cognition 25
where 25
this 25
is 25
possible 25
it 25
is 25
plain 25
that 25
the 25
opposite 25
of 25
a 25
given 25
proposition 25
may 25
contradict 25
merely 25
the 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
of 25
thought 25
and 25
not 25
the 25
objective 25
cognition 25
or 25
it 25
may 25
happen 25
that 25
both 25
propositions 25
contradict 25
each 25
other 25
only 25
under 25
a 25
subjective 25
condition 25
which 25
is 25
incorrectly 25
considered 25
to 25
be 25
objective 25
and 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
is 25
itself 25
false 25
both 25
propositions 25
may 25
be 25
false 25
and 25
it 25
will 25
consequently 25
be 25
impossible 25
to 25
conclude 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
one 25
from 25
the 25
falseness 25
of 25
the 25
other 25
in 25
mathematics 25
such 25
subreptions 25
are 25
impossible 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
science 25
accordingly 25
that 25
the 25
indirect 25
mode 25
of 25
proof 25
has 25
its 25
true 25
place 25
in 25
the 25
science 25
of 25
nature 25
where 25
all 25
assertion 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
empirical 25
intuition 25
such 25
subreptions 25
may 25
be 25
guarded 25
against 25
by 25
the 25
repeated 25
comparison 25
of 25
observations 25
but 25
this 25
mode 25
of 25
proof 25
is 25
of 25
little 25
value 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
knowledge 25
but 25
the 25
transcendental 25
efforts 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
are 25
all 25
made 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
the 25
subjective 25
which 25
is 25
the 25
real 25
medium 25
of 25
all 25
dialectical 25
illusion 25
and 25
thus 25
reason 25
endeavours 25
in 25
its 25
premisses 25
to 25
impose 25
upon 25
us 25
subjective 25
representations 25
for 25
objective 25
cognitions 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
sphere 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
then 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
synthetical 25
propositions 25
it 25
is 25
inadmissible 25
to 25
support 25
a 25
statement 25
by 25
disproving 25
the 25
counterstatement 25
for 25
only 25
two 25
cases 25
are 25
possible 25
either 25
the 25
counterstatement 25
is 25
nothing 25
but 25
the 25
enouncement 25
of 25
the 25
inconsistency 25
of 25
the 25
opposite 25
opinion 25
with 25
the 25
subjective 25
conditions 25
of 25
reason 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
affect 25
the 25
real 25
case 25
for 25
example 25
we 25
cannot 25
comprehend 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
necessity 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25

hence 25
every 25
speculative 25
proof 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
such 25
a 25

be 25
opposed 25
on 25
subjective 25
grounds 25

the 25

with 25

both 25

that 25
it 25

that 25
it 25
is 25
finite 25

limited 25
in 25
space 25
both 25
are 25
false 25
because 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
is 25
false 25
for 25
the 25
notion 25
of 25
phenomena 25
as 25
mere 25
representations 25
which 25
are 25
given 25
in 25
themselves 25
as 25
objects 25
is 25
selfcontradictory 25
and 25
the 25
infinitude 25
of 25
this 25
imaginary 25
whole 25
would 25
indeed 25
be 25
unconditioned 25
but 25
would 25
be 25
inconsistent 25
as 25
everything 25
in 25
the 25
phenomenal 25
world 25
is 25
conditioned 25
with 25
the 25
unconditioned 25
determination 25

quantities 25
which 25
is 25

in 25
our 25
conception 25
the 25
apagogic 25
mode 25

the 25
true 25

those 25

always 25

so 25
strong 25
an 25
attraction 25

the 25
admirers 25
of 25
dogmatical 25
philosophy 25
it 25
may 25
be 25
compared 25
to 25
a 25
champion 25
who 25
maintains 25
the 25
honour 25
and 25
claims 25
of 25
the 25
party 25
he 25
has 25
adopted 25
by 25
offering 25
battle 25
to 25
all 25
who 25
doubt 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
these 25
claims 25

the 25
purity 25

that 25
honour 25

nothing 25
can 25
be 25
proved 25

this 25
way 25

the 25
respective 25
strength 25
of 25
the 25
combatants 25

the 25
advantage 25
in 25
this 25
respect 25
is 25
always 25
on 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
the 25
attacking 25
party 25
spectators 25

that 25
each 25
party 25

alternately 25
conqueror 25

conquered 25
are 25
led 25
to 25
regard 25
the 25
subject 25

as 25
beyond 25
the 25
power 25

to 25
decide 25
upon 25
but 25
such 25
an 25
opinion 25
cannot 25
be 25
justified 25
and 25
it 25
is 25
sufficient 25
to 25
apply 25
to 25
these 25
reasoners 25
the 25
remark 25

what 25

be 25
supported 25
if 25
an 25

his 25

upon 25
subjective 25

he 25
may 25
be 25
refuted 25
with 25
ease 25
not 25
however 25
to 25
the 25
advantage 25
of 25
the 25
dogmatist 25
who 25
likewise 25
depends 25
upon 25
subjective 25
sources 25
of 25
cognition 25

like 25
manner 25
driven 25
into 25
a 25
corner 25
by 25
his 25

the 25
direct 25

they 25
will 25
soon 25
discover 25
the 25

nay 25
the 25
impossibility 25
of 25
proving 25
their 25
assertions 25

be 25

by 25

should 25
be 25
loth 25
to 25
undertake 25
this 25
labour 25
because 25
the 25
discoveries 25
we 25
might 25
make 25
would 25
not 25
be 25
of 25
the 25
smallest 25
use 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
concrete 25
or 25
physical 25
investigation 25
we 25
may 25
find 25
out 25
that 25
the 25
will 25
is 25
free 25
but 25
this 25
knowledge 25
only 25
relates 25
to 25
the 25
intelligible 25
cause 25
of 25
our 25
volition 25
as 25
regards 25
the 25
phenomena 25
or 25
expressions 25
of 25
this 25
will 25
that 25
is 25
our 25
actions 25
we 25
are 25
bound 25
in 25
obedience 25
to 25
an 25
inviolable 25
maxim 25
without 25
which 25
reason 25
cannot 25
be 25
employed 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
to 25
explain 25
these 25
in 25
the 25
same 25
way 25
as 25
we 25
explain 25
all 25
the 25
other 25
phenomena 25
of 25
nature 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
say 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
unchangeable 25
laws 25
we 25
may 25
have 25
discovered 25
the 25
spirituality 25
and 25
immortality 25
of 25
the 25
soul 25
but 25
we 25
cannot 25
employ 25
this 25
knowledge 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
phenomena 25
of 25
this 25
life 25
nor 25
the 25
peculiar 25
nature 25
of 25
the 25
future 25
because 25
our 25
conception 25
of 25
an 25
incorporeal 25
nature 25
is 25
purely 25
negative 25
and 25
does 25
not 25
add 25
anything 25
to 25
our 25
knowledge 25
and 25
the 25
only 25
inferences 25
to 25
be 25
drawn 25
from 25
it 25
are 25
purely 25
fictitious 25
if 25
again 25
we 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
we 25
should 25
be 25
able 25
from 25
it 25
to 25
make 25
the 25
conformity 25
to 25
aims 25
existing 25
in 25
the 25
arrangement 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
comprehensible 25
but 25
we 25
should 25
not 25
be 25
justified 25
in 25
deducing 25
from 25
it 25
any 25
particular 25
arrangement 25
or 25
disposition 25
or 25
inferring 25
any 25
where 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
perceived 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
a 25
necessary 25
rule 25
of 25
the 25
speculative 25
use 25
of 25
reason 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
overlook 25
natural 25
causes 25
or 25
refuse 25
to 25
listen 25
to 25
the 25
teaching 25
of 25
experience 25
for 25
the 25
sake 25
of 25
deducing 25
what 25
we 25
know 25
and 25
perceive 25
from 25
something 25
that 25
transcends 25
all 25
our 25
knowledge 25
in 25
one 25
word 25
these 25
three 25
propositions 25
are 25
for 25
the 25
speculative 25
reason 25
always 25
transcendent 25
and 25
cannot 25
be 25
employed 25
as 25
immanent 25
principles 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
objects 25
of 25
experience 25
they 25
are 25
consequently 25
of 25
no 25
use 25
to 25
us 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
being 25
but 25
the 25
valueless 25
results 25
of 25
the 25
severe 25
but 25
unprofitable 25
efforts 25
of 25
reason 25
if 25
then 25
the 25
actual 25
cognition 25
of 25
these 25
three 25
cardinal 25
propositions 25
is 25
perfectly 25
useless 25
while 25
reason 25
uses 25
her 25
utmost 25
endeavours 25
to 25
induce 25
us 25
to 25
admit 25
them 25
it 25
is 25
plain 25
that 25
their 25
real 25
value 25
and 25
importance 25
relate 25
to 25
our 25
practical 25

one 25
of 25
the 25
causes 25
which 25
exist 25
in 25
nature 25
that 25
is 25
it 25
shows 25
the 25
causal 25
power 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
the 25
determination 25
of 25
the 25
will 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
transcendental 25
freedom 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
requires 25
that 25
reasonin 25
relation 25
to 25
its 25
causal 25
power 25
of 25
commencing 25
a 25
series 25
of 25
phenomenashould 25
be 25
independent 25
of 25
all 25
sensuous 25
determining 25
causes 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
seems 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
opposition 25
to 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
to 25
all 25
possible 25
experience 25
it 25
therefore 25
remains 25
a 25
problem 25
for 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
but 25
this 25
problem 25
does 25
not 25
concern 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
practical 25
use 25
and 25
we 25
have 25
therefore 25
in 25
a 25
canon 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
to 25
do 25
with 25
only 25
two 25
questions 25
which 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
practical 25
interest 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
is 25
there 25
a 25
god 25
and 25
is 25
there 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
the 25
question 25
of 25
transcendental 25
freedom 25
is 25
purely 25
speculative 25
and 25
we 25
may 25
therefore 25
set 25
it 25
entirely 25
aside 25
when 25
we 25
come 25
to 25
treat 25
of 25
practical 25
reason 25
besides 25
we 25
have 25
already 25
discussed 25
this 25
subject 25
in 25
the 25
antinomy 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25

ii 25
of 25
the 25
ideal 25
of 25
the 25
summum 25
bonum 25
as 25
a 25
determining 25
ground 25
of 25
the 25
ultimate 25
end 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
reason 25
conducted 25
us 25
in 25
its 25
speculative 25
use 25
through 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
experience 25
and 25
as 25
it 25
can 25
never 25
find 25
complete 25
satisfaction 25
in 25
that 25
sphere 25
from 25
thence 25
to 25
speculative 25
ideaswhich 25
however 25
in 25
the 25
end 25
brought 25
us 25
back 25
again 25
to 25
experience 25
and 25
thus 25
fulfilled 25
the 25
purpose 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
a 25
manner 25
which 25
though 25
useful 25
was 25
not 25
at 25
all 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
our 25
expectations 25
it 25
now 25
remains 25
for 25
us 25
to 25
consider 25
whether 25
pure 25
reason 25
can 25
be 25
employed 25
in 25
a 25
practical 25
sphere 25
and 25
whether 25
it 25
will 25
here 25
conduct 25
us 25
to 25
those 25
ideas 25
which 25
attain 25
the 25
highest 25
ends 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
just 25
stated 25
them 25
we 25
shall 25
thus 25
ascertain 25
whether 25
from 25
the 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
of 25
its 25
practical 25
interest 25
reason 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
supply 25
us 25
with 25
that 25
which 25
on 25
the 25
speculative 25
side 25
it 25
wholly 25
denies 25
us 25
the 25
whole 25
interest 25
of 25
reason 25
speculative 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
practical 25
is 25
centred 25
in 25
the 25
three 25
following 25
questions 25
what 25
can 25
i 25
know 25
what 25
ought 25
i 25
to 25
do 25
what 25
may 25
i 25
hope 25
the 25
first 25
question 25
is 25
purely 25
speculative 25
we 25
have 25
as 25
i 25
flatter 25
myself 25
exhausted 25
all 25
the 25
replies 25
of 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
susceptible 25
and 25
have 25
at 25
last 25
found 25
the 25
reply 25
with 25
which 25
reason 25
must 25
content 25
itself 25
and 25
with 25
which 25
it 25
ought 25
to 25
be 25
content 25
so 25
long 25
as 25
it 25
pays 25
no 25
regard 25
to 25
the 25
practical 25
but 25
from 25
the 25
two 25
great 25
ends 25
to 25
the 25
attainment 25
of 25
which 25
all 25
these 25
efforts 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
were 25
in 25
fact 25
directed 25
we 25
remain 25
just 25
as 25
far 25
removed 25
as 25
if 25
we 25
had 25
consulted 25
our 25
ease 25
and 25
declined 25
the 25
task 25
at 25
the 25
outset 25
so 25
far 25
then 25
as 25
knowledge 25
is 25
concerned 25
thus 25
much 25
at 25
least 25
is 25
established 25
that 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
those 25
two 25
problems 25
it 25
lies 25
beyond 25
our 25
reach 25
the 25
second 25
question 25
is 25
purely 25
practical 25
as 25
such 25
it 25
may 25
indeed 25
fall 25
within 25
the 25
province 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
but 25
still 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
transcendental 25
but 25
moral 25
and 25
consequently 25
cannot 25
in 25
itself 25
form 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25
our 25
criticism 25
the 25
third 25
question 25
if 25
i 25
act 25
as 25
i 25
ought 25
to 25
do 25
what 25
may 25
i 25
then 25
hopeis 25
at 25
once 25
practical 25
and 25
theoretical 25
the 25
practical 25
forms 25
a 25
clue 25
to 25
the 25
answer 25
of 25
the 25
theoretical 25
andin 25
its 25
highest 25
form 25
speculative 25
question 25
for 25
all 25
hoping 25
has 25
happiness 25
for 25
its 25
object 25
and 25
stands 25
in 25
precisely 25
the 25
same 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
practical 25
and 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
morality 25
as 25
knowing 25
to 25
the 25
theoretical 25
cognition 25
of 25
things 25
and 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
nature 25
the 25
former 25
arrives 25
finally 25
at 25
the 25
conclusion 25
that 25
something 25
is 25
which 25
determines 25
the 25
ultimate 25
end 25
because 25
something 25
ought 25
to 25
take 25
place 25
the 25
latter 25
that 25
something 25
is 25
which 25
operates 25
as 25
the 25
highest 25
cause 25
because 25
something 25
does 25
take 25
place 25
happiness 25
is 25
the 25
satisfaction 25
of 25
all 25
our 25
desires 25
extensive 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
their 25
multiplicity 25
intensive 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
their 25
degree 25
and 25
protensive 25
in 25
regard 25
to 25
their 25
duration 25
the 25
practical 25
law 25
based 25
on 25
the 25
motive 25
of 25
happiness 25
i 25
term 25
a 25
pragmatical 25
law 25
or 25
prudential 25
rule 25
but 25
that 25
law 25
assuming 25
such 25
to 25
exist 25
which 25
has 25
no 25
other 25
motive 25
than 25
the 25
worthiness 25
of 25
being 25
happy 25
i 25
term 25
a 25
moral 25
or 25
ethical 25
law 25
the 25
first 25
tells 25
us 25
what 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
do 25
if 25
we 25
wish 25
to 25
become 25
possessed 25
of 25
happiness 25
the 25
second 25
dictates 25
how 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
act 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
deserve 25
happiness 25
the 25
first 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
empirical 25
principles 25
for 25
it 25
is 25
only 25
by 25
experience 25
that 25
i 25
can 25
learn 25
either 25
what 25
inclinations 25
exist 25
which 25
desire 25
satisfaction 25
or 25
what 25
are 25
the 25
natural 25
means 25
of 25
satisfying 25
them 25
the 25
second 25
takes 25
no 25
account 25
of 25
our 25
desires 25
or 25
the 25
means 25
of 25
satisfying 25
them 25
and 25
regards 25
only 25
the 25
freedom 25
of 25
a 25
rational 25
being 25
and 25
the 25
necessary 25
conditions 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
this 25
freedom 25
can 25
harmonize 25
with 25
the 25
distribution 25
of 25
happiness 25
according 25
to 25
principles 25
this 25
second 25
law 25
may 25
therefore 25
rest 25
upon 25
mere 25
ideas 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
may 25
be 25
cognized 25
a 25
priori 25
i 25
assume 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
pure 25
moral 25
laws 25
which 25
determine 25
entirely 25
a 25
priori 25
without 25
regard 25
to 25
empirical 25
motives 25
that 25
is 25
to 25
happiness 25
the 25
conduct 25
of 25
a 25
rational 25
being 25
or 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
to 25
use 25
which 25
it 25
makes 25
of 25
its 25
freedom 25
and 25
that 25
these 25
laws 25
are 25
absolutely 25
imperative 25
not 25
merely 25
hypothetically 25
on 25
the 25
supposition 25
of 25
other 25
empirical 25
ends 25
and 25
therefore 25
in 25
all 25
respects 25
necessary 25
i 25
am 25
warranted 25
in 25
assuming 25
this 25
not 25
only 25
by 25
the 25
arguments 25
of 25
the 25
most 25
enlightened 25
moralists 25
but 25
by 25
the 25
moral 25
judgement 25
of 25
every 25
man 25
who 25
will 25
make 25
the 25
attempt 25
to 25
form 25
a 25
distinct 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
law 25
pure 25
reason 25
then 25
contains 25
not 25
indeed 25
in 25
its 25
speculative 25
but 25
in 25
its 25
practical 25
or 25
more 25
strictly 25
its 25
moral 25
use 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
experience 25
of 25
such 25
actions 25
namely 25
as 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
ethical 25
precepts 25
might 25
be 25
met 25
with 25
in 25
the 25
history 25
of 25
man 25
for 25
since 25
reason 25
commands 25
that 25
such 25
actions 25
should 25
take 25
place 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
possible 25
for 25
them 25
to 25
take 25
place 25
and 25
hence 25
a 25
particular 25
kind 25
of 25
systematic 25
unitythe 25
moralmust 25
be 25
possible 25
we 25
have 25
found 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
that 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
nature 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
established 25
according 25
to 25
speculative 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
because 25
while 25
reason 25
possesses 25
a 25
causal 25
power 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
freedom 25
it 25
has 25
none 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
whole 25
sphere 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
while 25
moral 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
can 25
produce 25
free 25
actions 25
they 25
cannot 25

then 25

its 25
practical 25

in 25
its 25
moral 25

as 25
possible 25
into 25

the 25

to 25
the 25
world 25

of 25

in 25
it 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
the 25
liberum 25
arbitrium 25
of 25
the 25
individual 25
is 25
placed 25
under 25

by 25
virtue 25
of 25
moral 25
laws 25
in 25
complete 25
systematic 25
unity 25
both 25
with 25
itself 25
and 25
with 25
the 25
freedom 25
of 25
all 25
others 25
that 25
is 25
the 25
answer 25
to 25
the 25
first 25
of 25
the 25
two 25
questions 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
which 25
relate 25
to 25
its 25
practical 25
interest 25
do 25
that 25
which 25
will 25
render 25
thee 25
worthy 25
of 25
happiness 25
the 25
second 25
question 25
is 25
this 25
if 25
i 25
conduct 25
myself 25
so 25
as 25
not 25
to 25
be 25
unworthy 25
of 25
happiness 25
may 25
i 25
hope 25
thereby 25
to 25
obtain 25
happiness 25
in 25
order 25
to 25
arrive 25
at 25
the 25
solution 25
of 25
this 25
question 25
we 25
must 25
inquire 25
whether 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
which 25
prescribe 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
law 25
necessarily 25
also 25
connect 25
this 25
hope 25
with 25
it 25
i 25
say 25
then 25
that 25
just 25
as 25
the 25
moral 25
principles 25
are 25
necessary 25
according 25
to 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
practical 25
use 25
so 25
it 25
is 25
equally 25
necessary 25
according 25
to 25
reason 25
in 25
its 25
theoretical 25
use 25
to 25
assume 25
that 25
every 25
one 25
has 25
ground 25
to 25
hope 25
for 25
happiness 25
in 25
the 25
measure 25
in 25
which 25
he 25
has 25
made 25
himself 25
worthy 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
his 25
conduct 25
and 25
that 25
therefore 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
morality 25
is 25
inseparably 25
though 25
only 25
in 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
connected 25
with 25
that 25
of 25
happiness 25
now 25
in 25
an 25
intelligible 25
that 25
is 25
in 25
the 25
moral 25
world 25
in 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
which 25
we 25
make 25
abstraction 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
impediments 25
to 25
morality 25
sensuous 25
desires 25
such 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
happiness 25
connected 25
with 25
and 25
proportioned 25
to 25
morality 25
may 25
be 25
conceived 25
as 25
necessary 25
because 25
freedom 25
of 25
volitionpartly 25
incited 25
and 25
partly 25

the 25
cause 25
of 25
general 25
happiness 25

thus 25
rational 25
beings 25
under 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
such 25
principles 25
would 25
be 25
themselves 25
the 25
authors 25
both 25
of 25
their 25
own 25
enduring 25
welfare 25
and 25
that 25
of 25
others 25
but 25
such 25
a 25
system 25
of 25
selfrewarding 25
morality 25
is 25
only 25
an 25
idea 25
the 25
carrying 25
out 25
of 25
which 25
depends 25
upon 25
the 25
condition 25
that 25
every 25
one 25
acts 25
as 25
he 25
ought 25
in 25
other 25
words 25
that 25
all 25
actions 25
of 25
reasonable 25
beings 25
be 25
such 25
as 25
they 25
would 25
be 25
if 25
they 25
sprung 25
from 25
a 25
supreme 25
will 25
comprehending 25
in 25
or 25
under 25
itself 25
all 25
particular 25
wills 25
but 25
since 25
the 25
moral 25
law 25
is 25
binding 25
on 25
each 25
individual 25
in 25
the 25
use 25
of 25
his 25
freedom 25

even 25
if 25

with 25
the 25

worthy 25
of 25

cannot 25
be 25
cognized 25
by 25
reason 25
if 25
we 25
take 25
nature 25
alone 25
for 25
our 25
guide 25
this 25
connection 25
can 25
be 25

only 25
on 25
the 25

that 25
the 25

of 25

in 25
the 25

so 25
far 25
as 25
happiness 25
stands 25
in 25

accordingly 25
of 25
an 25
intelligible 25
that 25
is 25
moral 25
world 25
now 25
since 25
we 25
are 25
necessitated 25
by 25
reason 25
to 25
conceive 25
ourselves 25
as 25
belonging 25
to 25
such 25
a 25
world 25
while 25
the 25
senses 25
present 25
to 25
us 25
nothing 25
but 25
a 25
world 25
of 25
phenomena 25
we 25
must 25
assume 25
the 25
former 25
as 25
a 25
consequence 25
of 25
our 25
conduct 25
in 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
since 25
the 25
world 25
of 25
sense 25
gives 25
us 25
no 25
hint 25
of 25
it 25

therefore 25
as 25
future 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
us 25
thus 25
god 25
and 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
are 25
two 25
hypotheses 25
which 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
principles 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
are 25
inseparable 25
from 25
the 25
obligation 25
which 25
this 25
reason 25
imposes 25
upon 25
us 25
morality 25
per 25
se 25
constitutes 25
a 25
system 25
but 25
we 25
can 25
form 25
no 25
system 25
of 25
happiness 25
except 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
it 25
is 25
dispensed 25
in 25
strict 25
proportion 25
to 25
morality 25
but 25
this 25
is 25
only 25
possible 25
in 25
the 25
intelligible 25
world 25
under 25
a 25

together 25
with 25

in 25
such 25

world 25
which 25
we 25
must 25
look 25
upon 25
as 25
future 25
reason 25
finds 25
itself 25
compelled 25
to 25
assume 25
or 25
it 25
must 25
regard 25
the 25
moral 25
laws 25
as 25
idle 25
dreams 25
since 25
the 25
necessary 25
consequence 25
which 25
this 25
same 25
reason 25
connects 25
with 25
them 25
must 25
without 25
this 25
hypothesis 25
fall 25
to 25
the 25
ground 25
hence 25
also 25
the 25
moral 25
laws 25
are 25
universally 25
regarded 25
as 25
commands 25
which 25
they 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
did 25
they 25
not 25
connect 25
a 25
priori 25
adequate 25
consequences 25
with 25
their 25
dictates 25
and 25
thus 25
carry 25
with 25
them 25
promises 25
and 25
threats 25
but 25
this 25
again 25
they 25
could 25
not 25
do 25
did 25
they 25
not 25
reside 25
in 25
a 25
necessary 25

the 25

connected 25
with 25
the 25
internal 25
possibility 25
of 25
things 25
this 25
gives 25
rise 25
to 25
a 25
transcendental 25

takes 25
the 25
ideal 25
of 25
the 25

all 25

universal 25

necessary 25
natural 25

in 25
respect 25
of 25
experience 25
if 25
we 25

not 25

to 25
ourselves 25
but 25
the 25
highest 25
ends 25
are 25
those 25
of 25
morality 25

it 25
is 25
only 25
pure 25
reason 25
that 25
can 25
give 25
us 25
the 25
knowledge 25
of 25
these 25
though 25
supplied 25
with 25
these 25
and 25
putting 25
ourselves 25
under 25
their 25
guidance 25
we 25
can 25
make 25
no 25
teleological 25
use 25
of 25
the 25

of 25
nature 25
as 25

nature 25
itself 25
has 25
established 25
teleological 25
unity 25
for 25
without 25
this 25
unity 25
we 25
should 25
not 25
even 25
possess 25
reason 25
because 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
no 25
school 25
for 25
reason 25
and 25
no 25
cultivation 25
through 25
objects 25
which 25
afford 25
the 25
materials 25
for 25

this 25

condition 25
of 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
this 25
unity 25
in 25
concreto 25
must 25
be 25
so 25
likewise 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
the 25
transcendental 25
enlargement 25
of 25
our 25
rational 25
cognition 25
would 25
be 25
not 25
the 25
cause 25
but 25
merely 25
the 25
effect 25
of 25
the 25
practical 25
teleology 25
which 25
pure 25
reason 25
imposes 25
upon 25
us 25
hence 25
also 25
we 25
find 25
in 25
the 25
history 25
of 25
human 25
reason 25
that 25
before 25
the 25
moral 25
conceptions 25
were 25
sufficiently 25
purified 25
and 25
determined 25
and 25
before 25
men 25
had 25
attained 25
to 25
a 25
perception 25
of 25
the 25
systematic 25
unity 25
of 25
ends 25
according 25
to 25
these 25
conceptions 25
and 25
from 25
necessary 25
principles 25
the 25
knowledge 25
of 25
nature 25
and 25
even 25
a 25
considerable 25
amount 25
of 25
intellectual 25
culture 25
in 25
many 25
other 25
sciences 25
could 25
produce 25
only 25
rude 25
and 25
vague 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
deity 25
sometimes 25
even 25
admitting 25
of 25
an 25
astonishing 25
indifference 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
this 25
question 25
altogether 25
but 25
the 25
more 25
enlarged 25
treatment 25
of 25
moral 25
ideas 25
which 25
was 25
rendered 25
necessary 25
by 25
the 25
extreme 25
pure 25
moral 25
law 25
of 25
our 25
religion 25
awakened 25
the 25
interest 25
and 25
thereby 25
quickened 25
the 25
perceptions 25
of 25
reason 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
this 25
object 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
and 25
without 25
the 25
help 25
either 25
of 25
an 25
extended 25
acquaintance 25
with 25
nature 25
or 25
of 25
a 25
reliable 25
transcendental 25
insight 25
for 25
these 25
have 25
been 25
wanting 25
in 25
all 25
ages 25
a 25
conception 25
of 25
the 25
divine 25
being 25
was 25
arrived 25
at 25
which 25
we 25
now 25
bold 25
to 25
be 25
the 25
correct 25
one 25
not 25
because 25
speculative 25
reason 25
convinces 25
us 25
of 25
its 25
correctness 25
but 25
because 25
it 25
accords 25
with 25
the 25
moral 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
to 25
pure 25
reason 25
but 25
only 25
in 25
its 25
practical 25
use 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
ascribe 25
the 25
merit 25
of 25
having 25
connected 25
with 25
our 25
highest 25
interest 25
a 25
cognition 25
of 25
which 25
mere 25
speculation 25
was 25
able 25
only 25
to 25
form 25
a 25
conjecture 25
but 25
the 25
validity 25
of 25
which 25
it 25

having 25
thereby 25
rendered 25
it 25
not 25
indeed 25
a 25
demonstrated 25
dogma 25
but 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25
to 25
the 25
essential 25
ends 25
of 25
reason 25
but 25
if 25
practical 25
reason 25
has 25
reached 25
this 25
elevation 25
and 25
has 25
attained 25
to 25
the 25
conception 25
of 25
a 25
sole 25
primal 25
being 25
as 25
the 25
supreme 25
good 25
it 25
must 25
not 25
therefore 25
imagine 25
that 25
it 25
has 25
transcended 25
the 25
empirical 25
conditions 25
of 25
its 25
application 25
and 25
risen 25
to 25
the 25
immediate 25
cognition 25
of 25
new 25
objects 25
it 25
must 25
not 25
presume 25
to 25
start 25
from 25
the 25
conception 25
which 25
it 25
has 25
gained 25
and 25
to 25
deduce 25
from 25
it 25
the 25
moral 25
laws 25
themselves 25
for 25
it 25
was 25
these 25
very 25
laws 25
the 25
internal 25
practical 25
necessity 25
of 25
which 25
led 25
us 25
to 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
an 25
independent 25
cause 25
or 25
of 25
a 25
wise 25
ruler 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
who 25
should 25
give 25
them 25
effect 25
hence 25
we 25
are 25
not 25
entitled 25
to 25
regard 25
them 25
as 25
accidental 25
and 25
derived 25
from 25
the 25
mere 25
will 25
of 25
the 25
ruler 25
especially 25
as 25
we 25
have 25
no 25
conception 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
will 25
except 25
as 25
formed 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
these 25
laws 25
so 25
far 25
then 25
as 25
practical 25
reason 25
has 25
the 25
right 25
to 25
conduct 25
us 25
we 25
shall 25
not 25
look 25
upon 25
actions 25
as 25
binding 25
on 25
us 25
because 25
they 25
are 25
the 25
commands 25
of 25
god 25
but 25
we 25
shall 25
regard 25
them 25
as 25
divine 25
commands 25
because 25
we 25
are 25
internally 25
bound 25
by 25
them 25
we 25
shall 25
study 25
freedom 25
under 25
the 25
teleological 25
unity 25
which 25
accords 25
with 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
shall 25
look 25
upon 25
ourselves 25
as 25
acting 25
in 25
conformity 25
with 25
the 25
divine 25
will 25
only 25
in 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
we 25
hold 25
sacred 25
the 25
moral 25
law 25
which 25
reason 25
teaches 25
us 25
from 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
actions 25
themselves 25
and 25
we 25
shall 25
believe 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
obey 25
that 25

promoting 25
the 25

ourselves 25
in 25
harmony 25
with 25
the 25
general 25

our 25

are 25
valid 25
for 25

reason 25

not 25
indeed 25

mere 25
persuasion 25

we 25
can 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
this 25
develop 25
the 25
subjective 25
causes 25
of 25
the 25
judgement 25
which 25
we 25
have 25
taken 25
for 25
its 25
objective 25
grounds 25

thus 25
explain 25
the 25
deceptive 25
judgement 25
as 25
a 25
phenomenon 25

altogether 25
from 25

need 25
be 25
no 25

if 25
its 25

knowing 25
something 25
at 25

by 25
which 25
my 25
judgement 25
in 25
itself 25
merely 25
problematical 25
is 25
brought 25
into 25
connection 25
with 25
the 25

connection 25
although 25
not 25
perfect 25
is 25
still 25
something 25
more 25
than 25
an 25
arbitrary 25
fiction 25
moreover 25
the 25
law 25
of 25
such 25

i 25
have 25
nothing 25
more 25

my 25

a 25

no 25

all 25
hence 25
it 25
is 25
absurd 25
to 25
have 25
an 25
opinion 25
in 25
pure 25
mathematics 25
we 25
must 25
know 25
or 25
abstain 25
from 25
forming 25
a 25
judgement 25
altogether 25
the 25
case 25
is 25
the 25
same 25
with 25
the 25
maxims 25
of 25

for 25
we 25
must 25
not 25
hazard 25
an 25
action 25
on 25
the 25
mere 25
opinion 25
that 25
it 25

allowed 25
but 25
we 25
must 25
know 25
it 25
to 25
be 25
so 25
in 25
the 25
transcendental 25
sphere 25
of 25
reason 25
on 25
the 25
other 25
hand 25
the 25
term 25
opinion 25
is 25
too 25
weak 25
while 25
the 25
word 25
knowledge 25

too 25
strong 25
from 25
the 25
merely 25
speculative 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
therefore 25
we 25
cannot 25
form 25
a 25

at 25
all 25

the 25
subjective 25

that 25

his 25
firm 25

is 25
a 25
bet 25

frequently 25
happens 25
that 25
a 25
man 25
delivers 25
his 25
opinions 25
with 25
so 25
much 25
boldness 25
and 25
assurance 25
that 25
he 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
under 25
no 25
apprehension 25
as 25
to 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25

being 25
in 25

the 25
offer 25
of 25
a 25

startles 25
him 25
and 25
makes 25
him 25
pause 25
sometimes 25
it 25
turns 25
out 25
that 25
his 25
persuasion 25
may 25
be 25
valued 25
at 25
a 25
ducat 25
but 25
not 25
at 25
ten 25
for 25
he 25
does 25
not 25
hesitate 25
perhaps 25
to 25
venture 25
a 25
ducat 25
but 25
if 25
it 25
is 25
proposed 25
to 25
stake 25
ten 25
he 25
immediately 25
becomes 25
aware 25
of 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
his 25
being 25
mistakena 25
possibility 25
which 25
has 25
hitherto 25
escaped 25
his 25
observation 25
if 25
we 25
imagine 25
to 25
ourselves 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
to 25
stake 25
the 25
happiness 25
of 25
our 25
whole 25
life 25
on 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
any 25
proposition 25
our 25
judgement 25
drops 25
its 25
air 25
of 25
triumph 25
we 25
take 25
the 25
alarm 25
and 25
discover 25
the 25
actual 25
strength 25
of 25
our 25
belief 25
thus 25
pragmatical 25
belief 25
has 25
degrees 25
varying 25
in 25
proportion 25
to 25
the 25
interests 25
at 25
stake 25
now 25
in 25
cases 25
where 25
we 25
cannot 25
enter 25
upon 25
any 25
course 25
of 25
action 25
in 25
reference 25
to 25
some 25
object 25
and 25
where 25
accordingly 25
our 25
judgement 25
is 25
purely 25
theoretical 25
we 25
can 25
still 25
represent 25
to 25
ourselves 25
in 25
thought 25
the 25
possibility 25
of 25
a 25
course 25
of 25
action 25
for 25
which 25
we 25
suppose 25
that 25
we 25
have 25
sufficient 25
grounds 25
if 25
any 25
means 25
existed 25
of 25
ascertaining 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
matter 25
thus 25
we 25
find 25
in 25
purely 25
theoretical 25
judgements 25
an 25
analogon 25
of 25
practical 25
judgements 25
to 25
which 25
the 25
word 25
belief 25
may 25
properly 25
be 25
applied 25
and 25
which 25
we 25
may 25
term 25
doctrinal 25
belief 25
i 25
should 25
not 25
hesitate 25
to 25
stake 25
my 25
all 25
on 25
the 25
truth 25
of 25
the 25
proposition 25
if 25
there 25
were 25
any 25
possibility 25
of 25
bringing 25
it 25
to 25
the 25
test 25
of 25
experiencethat 25
at 25
least 25
some 25
one 25
of 25
the 25
planets 25
which 25
we 25
see 25
is 25
inhabited 25
hence 25
i 25
say 25
that 25
i 25
have 25
not 25
merely 25
the 25
opinion 25
but 25
the 25
strong 25
belief 25
on 25
the 25
correctness 25
of 25
which 25
i 25
would 25
stake 25
even 25
many 25
of 25
the 25
advantages 25
of 25
life 25
that 25
there 25
are 25
inhabitants 25
in 25
other 25
worlds 25
now 25
we 25
must 25
admit 25
that 25
the 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
belongs 25
to 25
doctrinal 25
belief 25
for 25
although 25
in 25
respect 25
to 25
the 25
theoretical 25
cognition 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
i 25
do 25
not 25
require 25
to 25
form 25
any 25
theory 25
which 25
necessarily 25
involves 25
this 25
idea 25
as 25
the 25
condition 25
of 25
my 25
explanation 25
of 25
the 25
phenomena 25
which 25
the 25
universe 25
presents 25
but 25
on 25
the 25
contrary 25
am 25
rather 25
bound 25
so 25
to 25
use 25
my 25
reason 25
as 25
if 25
everything 25
were 25
mere 25
nature 25
still 25
teleological 25
unity 25
is 25
so 25
important 25
a 25
condition 25
of 25
the 25
application 25
of 25
my 25
reason 25
to 25
nature 25
that 25
it 25
is 25
impossible 25
for 25
me 25
to 25
ignore 25
itespecially 25
since 25
in 25
addition 25
to 25
these 25
considerations 25
abundant 25
examples 25
of 25
it 25
are 25
supplied 25
by 25
experience 25
but 25
the 25
sole 25
condition 25
so 25
far 25
as 25
my 25
knowledge 25
extends 25
under 25
which 25
this 25
unity 25
can 25
be 25
my 25
guide 25
in 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
nature 25
is 25
the 25
assumption 25
that 25
a 25
supreme 25
intelligence 25
has 25
ordered 25
all 25
things 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
wisest 25
ends 25
consequently 25
the 25
hypothesis 25
of 25
a 25
wise 25
author 25
of 25
the 25
universe 25
is 25
necessary 25
for 25
my 25
guidance 25
in 25
the 25
investigation 25
of 25
natureis 25
the 25
condition 25
under 25
which 25
alone 25
i 25
can 25
fulfil 25
an 25
end 25
which 25
is 25
contingent 25
indeed 25
but 25
by 25
no 25
means 25
unimportant 25
moreover 25
since 25
the 25
result 25
of 25
my 25
attempts 25
so 25
frequently 25
confirms 25
the 25
utility 25
of 25
this 25
assumption 25
and 25
since 25
nothing 25
decisive 25
can 25
be 25
adduced 25
against 25
it 25
it 25
follows 25
that 25
it 25
would 25
be 25
saying 25
far 25
too 25
little 25
to 25
term 25
my 25
judgement 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
a 25
mere 25
opinion 25
and 25
that 25
even 25
in 25
this 25
theoretical 25
connection 25
i 25
may 25
assert 25
that 25
i 25
firmly 25
believe 25
in 25
god 25
still 25
if 25
we 25
use 25
words 25
strictly 25
this 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
called 25
a 25
practical 25
but 25
a 25
doctrinal 25
belief 25
which 25
the 25
theology 25
of 25
nature 25
physicotheology 25
must 25
also 25
produce 25
in 25
my 25
mind 25
in 25
the 25
wisdom 25
of 25
a 25
supreme 25
being 25
and 25
in 25
the 25
shortness 25
of 25
life 25
so 25
inadequate 25
to 25
the 25
development 25
of 25
the 25
glorious 25
powers 25
of 25
human 25
nature 25
we 25
may 25
find 25
equally 25
sufficient 25
grounds 25
for 25
a 25
doctrinal 25
belief 25
in 25
the 25
future 25
life 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
soul 25
the 25
expression 25
of 25
belief 25
is 25
in 25
such 25
cases 25
an 25
expression 25
of 25
modesty 25
from 25
the 25
objective 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
but 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
of 25
firm 25
confidence 25
from 25
the 25
subjective 25
if 25
i 25
should 25
venture 25
to 25
term 25
this 25
merely 25
theoretical 25
judgement 25
even 25
so 25
much 25
as 25
a 25
hypothesis 25
which 25
i 25
am 25
entitled 25
to 25
assume 25
a 25
more 25
complete 25
conception 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
another 25
world 25
and 25
to 25
the 25
cause 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
might 25
then 25
be 25
justly 25
required 25
of 25
me 25
than 25
i 25
am 25
in 25
reality 25
able 25
to 25
give 25
for 25
if 25
i 25
assume 25
anything 25
even 25
as 25
a 25
mere 25
hypothesis 25
i 25
must 25
at 25
least 25
know 25
so 25
much 25
of 25
the 25
properties 25
of 25
such 25
a 25
being 25
as 25
will 25
enable 25
me 25
not 25
to 25
form 25
the 25
conception 25
but 25
to 25
imagine 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
it 25
but 25
the 25
word 25
belief 25
refers 25
only 25
to 25
the 25
guidance 25
which 25
an 25
idea 25
gives 25
me 25
and 25
to 25
its 25
subjective 25
influence 25
on 25
the 25
conduct 25
of 25
my 25
reason 25
which 25
forces 25
me 25
to 25
hold 25
it 25
fast 25
though 25
i 25
may 25
not 25
be 25
in 25
a 25
position 25
to 25
give 25
a 25
speculative 25
account 25
of 25
it 25
but 25
mere 25
doctrinal 25
belief 25
is 25
to 25
some 25
extent 25
wanting 25
in 25
stability 25
we 25
often 25
quit 25
our 25
hold 25
of 25
it 25
in 25
consequence 25
of 25
the 25
difficulties 25
which 25
occur 25
in 25
speculation 25
though 25
in 25
the 25
end 25
we 25
inevitably 25
return 25
to 25
it 25
again 25
it 25
is 25
quite 25
otherwise 25
with 25
moral 25
belief 25
for 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
action 25
is 25
absolutely 25
necessary 25

obedience 25
to 25
the 25
moral 25
law 25

all 25
points 25
the 25
end 25
is 25
here 25
incontrovertibly 25
established 25
and 25
there 25
is 25
only 25
one 25
condition 25
possible 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
best 25
of 25
my 25
perception 25
under 25
which 25
this 25
end 25
can 25
harmonize 25
with 25
all 25
other 25
ends 25
and 25
so 25
have 25
practical 25
validitynamely 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
a 25
god 25
and 25
of 25
a 25
future 25
world 25
i 25
know 25
also 25
to 25
a 25
certainty 25
that 25
no 25
one 25
can 25
be 25
acquainted 25
with 25
any 25
other 25
conditions 25
which 25
conduct 25
to 25
the 25
same 25
unity 25
of 25
ends 25
under 25
the 25
moral 25
law 25
but 25
since 25
the 25
moral 25
precept 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
my 25
maxim 25
as 25
reason 25
requires 25
that 25
it 25
should 25
be 25
i 25
am 25
irresistibly 25
constrained 25
to 25
believe 25
in 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
in 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
and 25
i 25
am 25
sure 25
that 25
nothing 25
can 25
make 25
me 25
waver 25
in 25
this 25
belief 25
since 25
i 25
should 25
thereby 25
overthrow 25
my 25
moral 25
maxims 25
the 25
renunciation 25
of 25
which 25
would 25
render 25
me 25
hateful 25
in 25
my 25
own 25
eyes 25
thus 25
while 25
all 25
the 25
ambitious 25
attempts 25
of 25
reason 25
to 25
penetrate 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
experience 25
end 25
in 25
disappointment 25
there 25
is 25
still 25
enough 25
left 25
to 25
satisfy 25
us 25
in 25
a 25
practical 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
no 25
one 25
it 25
is 25
true 25
will 25
be 25
able 25
to 25
boast 25
that 25
he 25
knows 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
god 25
and 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
for 25
if 25
he 25
knows 25
this 25
he 25
is 25
just 25
the 25
man 25
whom 25
i 25
have 25
long 25
wished 25
to 25
find 25
all 25
knowledge 25
regarding 25
an 25
object 25
of 25
mere 25
reason 25
can 25
be 25
communicated 25
and 25
i 25
should 25
thus 25
be 25
enabled 25
to 25
hope 25
that 25
my 25
own 25
knowledge 25
would 25
receive 25
this 25
wonderful 25
extension 25
through 25
the 25
instrumentality 25
of 25
his 25
instruction 25
no 25
my 25
conviction 25
is 25
not 25
logical 25
but 25
moral 25
certainty 25
and 25
since 25
it 25
rests 25
on 25
subjective 25
grounds 25
of 25
the 25
moral 25
sentiment 25
i 25
must 25
not 25
even 25
say 25
it 25
is 25
morally 25
certain 25
that 25
there 25
is 25
a 25
god 25
etc 25
but 25
i 25
am 25
morally 25
certain 25
that 25
is 25
my 25
belief 25
in 25
god 25
and 25
in 25
another 25
world 25
is 25
so 25
interwoven 25
with 25
my 25
moral 25
nature 25
that 25
i 25
am 25
under 25
as 25
little 25
apprehension 25
of 25
having 25
the 25
former 25
torn 25
from 25
me 25
as 25
of 25
losing 25
the 25
latter 25
the 25
only 25
point 25
in 25
this 25
argument 25
that 25
may 25
appear 25
open 25
to 25
suspicion 25
is 25
that 25
this 25
rational 25
belief 25
presupposes 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
moral 25
sentiments 25
if 25
we 25
give 25
up 25
this 25
assumption 25
and 25
take 25
a 25
man 25
who 25
is 25
entirely 25
indifferent 25
with 25
regard 25
to 25
moral 25
laws 25
the 25
question 25
which 25
reason 25
proposes 25
becomes 25
then 25
merely 25
a 25
problem 25
for 25
speculation 25
and 25
may 25
indeed 25
be 25
supported 25
by 25
strong 25
grounds 25
from 25
analogy 25
but 25
not 25
by 25
such 25
as 25
will 25
compel 25
the 25
most 25
obstinate 25
scepticism 25
to 25
give 25
way 25
but 25
in 25
these 25
questions 25
no 25
man 25
is 25
free 25
from 25
all 25
interest 25
for 25
though 25
the 25
want 25
of 25
good 25
sentiments 25
may 25
place 25
him 25
beyond 25
the 25
influence 25
of 25
moral 25
interests 25
still 25
even 25
in 25
this 25
case 25
enough 25
may 25
be 25
left 25
to 25
make 25
him 25
fear 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
a 25
future 25
life 25
for 25
he 25
cannot 25
pretend 25
to 25
any 25
certainty 25
of 25
the 25
nonexistence 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
of 25
a 25
future 25
life 25

since 25
it 25
could 25
only 25
be 25
proved 25

mere 25
reason 25

therefore 25
apodeicticallyhe 25
is 25
prepared 25

establish 25
the 25
impossibility 25
of 25
both 25

certainly 25
no 25
reasonable 25
man 25
would 25
undertake 25
to 25
do 25
this 25
would 25
be 25
a 25
negative 25
belief 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
indeed 25
produce 25
morality 25
and 25
good 25
sentiments 25
but 25
still 25
could 25
produce 25
an 25
analogon 25
of 25
these 25
by 25
operating 25
as 25
a 25
powerful 25

you 25

the 25
very 25
circumstance 25
which 25
has 25

constructing 25
a 25

our 25

it 25
will 25
be 25
an 25
aggregate 25
and 25
not 25
a 25
system 25
thus 25
architectonic 25
is 25
the 25
doctrine 25
of 25
the 25
scientific 25
in 25
cognition 25
and 25
therefore 25
necessarily 25
forms 25
part 25
of 25
our 25
methodology 25
reason 25
cannot 25
permit 25
our 25
knowledge 25
to 25
remain 25
in 25
an 25
unconnected 25
and 25
rhapsodistic 25
state 25
but 25
requires 25
that 25
the 25
sum 25
of 25
our 25
cognitions 25
should 25
constitute 25
a 25

the 25
form 25
of 25
a 25

as 25
the 25

so 25
that 25
the 25
absence 25
of 25
any 25
part 25
can 25
be 25
immediately 25
detected 25
from 25
our 25
knowledge 25
of 25
the 25
rest 25
and 25
it 25
determines 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
the 25
system 25
thus 25
excluding 25
all 25
contingent 25

the 25

any 25
limb 25

without 25
changing 25
their 25
proportions 25
makes 25
each 25
in 25
its 25
sphere 25
stronger 25
and 25
more 25
active 25
we 25
require 25
for 25
the 25
execution 25
of 25
the 25

no 25

will 25
attempt 25
to 25
construct 25
a 25

have 25
some 25
idea 25
to 25
rest 25
on 25
as 25

proper 25
basis 25

in 25
the 25
elaboration 25
of 25
the 25

he 25
finds 25
that 25
the 25
schema 25
nay 25
even 25
the 25
definition 25
which 25
he 25
at 25
first 25
gave 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
rarely 25
corresponds 25
with 25
his 25
idea 25
for 25
this 25
idea 25
lies 25
like 25
a 25
germ 25
in 25
our 25
reason 25
its 25
parts 25
undeveloped 25
and 25

even 25
from 25
microscopical 25
observation 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
we 25
ought 25
to 25
explain 25
and 25
define 25
sciences 25
not 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
description 25
which 25
the 25
originator 25
gives 25
of 25
them 25
but 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
idea 25
which 25
we 25
find 25
based 25
in 25
reason 25
itself 25
and 25
which 25
is 25
suggested 25
by 25
the 25
natural 25
unity 25
of 25
the 25
parts 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
already 25
accumulated 25
for 25
it 25
will 25
of 25
ten 25
be 25
found 25
that 25
the 25
originator 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
and 25
even 25
his 25
latest 25
successors 25
remain 25
attached 25
to 25
an 25
erroneous 25
idea 25
which 25
they 25
cannot 25
render 25
clear 25
to 25
themselves 25
and 25
that 25
they 25
thus 25
fail 25
in 25
determining 25
the 25
true 25
content 25
the 25
articulation 25
or 25
systematic 25
unity 25
and 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
their 25
science 25
it 25
is 25
unfortunate 25
that 25
only 25
after 25
having 25
occupied 25
ourselves 25
for 25
a 25
long 25
time 25
in 25
the 25
collection 25
of 25
materials 25
under 25
the 25
guidance 25
of 25
an 25
idea 25
which 25
lies 25
undeveloped 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
but 25
not 25
according 25
to 25
any 25
definite 25
plan 25
of 25
arrangementnay 25
only 25
after 25
we 25
have 25
spent 25
much 25
time 25
and 25
labour 25
in 25
the 25
technical 25
disposition 25
of 25
our 25
materials 25
does 25
it 25
become 25
possible 25
to 25
view 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
in 25
a 25
clear 25
light 25
and 25
to 25
project 25
according 25
to 25
architectonical 25
principles 25
a 25
plan 25
of 25
the 25
whole 25
in 25
accordance 25
with 25
the 25
aims 25
of 25
reason 25
systems 25
seem 25
like 25
certain 25
worms 25
to 25
be 25
formed 25
by 25
a 25
kind 25
of 25
generatio 25
aequivocaby 25
the 25
mere 25
confluence 25
of 25
conceptions 25
and 25
to 25
gain 25
completeness 25
only 25
with 25
the 25
progress 25
of 25
time 25
but 25
the 25
schema 25
or 25
germ 25
of 25
all 25
lies 25
in 25
reason 25
and 25
thus 25
is 25
not 25
only 25
every 25
system 25
organized 25
according 25
to 25
its 25
own 25
idea 25
but 25
all 25
are 25
united 25
into 25
one 25
grand 25
system 25
of 25
human 25
knowledge 25
of 25
which 25
they 25
form 25
members 25
for 25
this 25
reason 25
it 25
is 25
possible 25
to 25
frame 25
an 25
architectonic 25
of 25
all 25
human 25
cognition 25
the 25
formation 25
of 25
which 25
at 25
the 25
present 25
time 25
considering 25
the 25
immense 25
materials 25
collected 25
or 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
ruins 25
of 25
old 25
systems 25
would 25
not 25
indeed 25
be 25
very 25
difficult 25
our 25
purpose 25
at 25
present 25
is 25
merely 25
to 25
sketch 25
the 25
plan 25
of 25
the 25
architectonic 25
of 25
all 25
cognition 25
given 25
by 25
pure 25
reason 25
and 25
we 25
begin 25
from 25
the 25
point 25
where 25
the 25
main 25
root 25
of 25
human 25
knowledge 25
divides 25
into 25
two 25
one 25
of 25
which 25
is 25
reason 25
by 25
reason 25
i 25
understand 25
here 25
the 25
whole 25
higher 25
faculty 25
of 25
cognition 25
the 25
rational 25
being 25
placed 25
in 25
contradistinction 25
to 25
the 25
empirical 25
if 25
i 25
make 25
complete 25
abstraction 25
of 25
the 25
content 25
of 25
cognition 25
objectively 25
considered 25
all 25
cognition 25

from 25
a 25
subjective 25
point 25
of 25

whatever 25
may 25
be 25
the 25
original 25

of 25
a 25

it 25
is 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
person 25
who 25
possesses 25
it 25
merely 25
historical 25
if 25
he 25
knows 25
only 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
given 25
him 25
from 25
another 25
quarter 25
whether 25
that 25
knowledge 25
was 25
communicated 25
by 25
direct 25
experience 25
or 25
by 25
instruction 25
thus 25

his 25

are 25
only 25
those 25
which 25
he 25
has 25

from 25
his 25
teachers 25

the 25

his 25

is 25
merely 25
a 25
plaster 25
cast 25
of 25
a 25
living 25
man 25
rational 25
cognitions 25
which 25
are 25

that 25

which 25
have 25
their 25
source 25
in 25

can 25
be 25
so 25
termed 25
from 25
a 25
subjective 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
only 25
when 25
they 25
have 25
been 25
drawn 25
by 25
the 25
individual 25
himself 25
from 25
the 25
sources 25
of 25
reason 25
that 25
is 25
from 25
principles 25

it 25
is 25
in 25
this 25
way 25
alone 25
that 25
criticism 25

even 25
the 25
rejection 25
of 25
what 25
has 25
been 25
already 25
learned 25
can 25
spring 25
up 25
in 25
the 25
mind 25
all 25
rational 25
cognition 25
is 25
again 25
based 25
either 25
on 25
conceptions 25
or 25
on 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
conceptions 25
the 25
former 25
is 25
termed 25
philosophical 25
the 25
latter 25
mathematical 25
i 25
have 25
already 25
shown 25
the 25
essential 25
difference 25
of 25
these 25
two 25
methods 25
of 25
cognition 25
in 25
the 25
first 25
chapter 25
a 25
cognition 25
may 25
be 25
objectively 25
philosophical 25
and 25
subjectively 25
historicalas 25
is 25
the 25
case 25
with 25
the 25
majority 25
of 25
scholars 25
and 25
those 25
who 25
cannot 25
look 25
beyond 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
their 25
system 25
and 25
who 25
remain 25
in 25
a 25
state 25
of 25
pupilage 25
all 25
their 25
lives 25
but 25
it 25
is 25
remarkable 25
that 25
mathematical 25
knowledge 25
when 25
committed 25
to 25
memory 25
is 25
valid 25
from 25
the 25
subjective 25
point 25
of 25
view 25
as 25
rational 25
knowledge 25
also 25
and 25
that 25
the 25
same 25
distinction 25
cannot 25
be 25
drawn 25
here 25
as 25
in 25
the 25
case 25
of 25
philosophical 25
cognition 25
the 25
reason 25
is 25
that 25
the 25
only 25
way 25
of 25
arriving 25
at 25
this 25
knowledge 25
is 25
through 25
the 25
essential 25
principles 25
of 25
reason 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
is 25
always 25
certain 25
and 25
indisputable 25
because 25
reason 25
is 25
employed 25
in 25
concretobut 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
a 25
priorithat 25
is 25
in 25
pure 25
and 25
therefore 25
infallible 25
intuition 25
and 25
thus 25
all 25
causes 25
of 25
illusion 25
and 25
error 25
are 25
excluded 25
of 25
all 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
sciences 25
of 25
reason 25
therefore 25
mathematics 25
alone 25
can 25
be 25
learned 25
philosophyunless 25
it 25
be 25
in 25
an 25
historical 25
mannercannot 25
be 25
learned 25
we 25
can 25
at 25
most 25
learn 25
to 25
philosophize 25
philosophy 25
is 25
the 25
system 25
of 25
all 25
philosophical 25
cognition 25
we 25
must 25
use 25
this 25
term 25
in 25
an 25
objective 25
sense 25
if 25
we 25
understand 25
by 25
it 25
the 25
archetype 25
of 25
all 25
attempts 25
at 25
philosophizing 25
and 25
the 25
standard 25
by 25
which 25
all 25
subjective 25
philosophies 25
are 25
to 25
be 25
judged 25
in 25
this 25
sense 25
philosophy 25
is 25
merely 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
possible 25
science 25
which 25
does 25
not 25
exist 25
in 25

then 25
our 25
conception 25

only 25
a 25
scholastic 25

conception 25
that 25
is 25

a 25
system 25

which 25
we 25
are 25
trying 25
to 25
elaborate 25
into 25
a 25
science 25

that 25
we 25
at 25

know 25
being 25
the 25
systematic 25

consequently 25
the 25

the 25
cognition 25
for 25
the 25
desired 25

there 25
is 25
also 25
a 25
cosmical 25
conception 25

of 25
philosophy 25
which 25
has 25
always 25
formed 25
the 25
true 25
basis 25
of 25
this 25
term 25

the 25
ideal 25
of 25
a 25

in 25
this 25

the 25

the 25

the 25

commonly 25
called 25
metaphysic 25

the 25
more 25
limited 25
sense 25
but 25
as 25
pure 25
moral 25
philosophy 25
properly 25
forms 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
this 25
system 25
of 25
cognition 25
we 25
must 25
allow 25
it 25
to 25
retain 25
the 25
name 25
of 25
metaphysic 25
although 25
it 25
is 25
not 25
requisite 25
that 25
we 25
should 25
insist 25
on 25
so 25
terming 25
it 25
in 25
our 25
present 25
discussion 25
it 25
is 25
of 25
the 25
highest 25
importance 25
to 25
separate 25
those 25
cognitions 25
which 25
differ 25
from 25
others 25
both 25
in 25
kind 25
and 25
in 25
origin 25

to 25
take 25
great 25
care 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
not 25
confounded 25
with 25
those 25
with 25
which 25
they 25
are 25
generally 25
found 25
connected 25
what 25
the 25
chemist 25
does 25
in 25
the 25
analysis 25

what 25
the 25
mathematician 25
in 25
pure 25

is 25
in 25
a 25
still 25
higher 25
degree 25
the 25

the 25

of 25
the 25
mind 25
may 25
be 25
clearly 25
defined 25
human 25
reason 25
has 25
never 25
wanted 25
a 25
metaphysic 25
of 25
some 25
kind 25
since 25
it 25
attained 25
the 25
power 25
of 25
thought 25
or 25
rather 25
of 25
reflection 25
but 25
it 25
has 25
never 25
been 25
able 25
to 25
keep 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
thought 25
and 25
cognition 25
pure 25
from 25
all 25
admixture 25
of 25
foreign 25
elements 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
of 25
this 25
kind 25
is 25
as 25
old 25
as 25
speculation 25
itself 25
and 25
what 25
mind 25
does 25
not 25
speculateeither 25
in 25
the 25
scholastic 25
or 25
in 25
the 25
popular 25
fashion 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
admitted 25
that 25
even 25
thinkers 25
by 25
profession 25
have 25
been 25
unable 25
clearly 25
to 25
explain 25
the 25
distinction 25
between 25
the 25
two 25
elements 25
of 25
our 25
cognitionthe 25
one 25
completely 25
a 25
priori 25
the 25
other 25
a 25
posteriori 25
and 25
hence 25
the 25
proper 25
definition 25
of 25
a 25
peculiar 25
kind 25
of 25
cognition 25
and 25
with 25
it 25
the 25
just 25
idea 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
which 25
has 25
so 25
long 25
and 25
so 25
deeply 25
engaged 25
the 25
attention 25

this 25
definition 25
did 25
not 25
signalize 25
a 25
peculiarity 25
in 25
kind 25
but 25
only 25
a 25
difference 25
in 25
degree 25
these 25
first 25
principles 25
were 25
thus 25
declared 25
to 25

more 25

others 25
but 25
no 25
criterion 25
of 25

from 25
empirical 25

was 25
given 25

more 25

therefore 25
higher 25

we 25
cannot 25
distinguish 25
what 25

completely 25

that 25

shall 25
we 25
draw 25
the 25

to 25
separate 25
the 25

would 25
be 25
said 25
if 25
we 25
were 25
asked 25
to 25
be 25
satisfied 25
with 25
a 25
division 25

i 25
ask 25
does 25
the 25
conception 25

to 25

you 25
answer 25
yes 25
well 25
that 25
of 25

yes 25
and 25
that 25
of 25
a 25
fluid 25
body 25
you 25
stop 25
you 25
are 25
unprepared 25
to 25
admit 25
this 25
for 25
if 25
you 25
do 25
everything 25
will 25
belong 25
to 25
metaphysics 25
from 25
this 25
it 25
is 25
evident 25
that 25
the 25
mere 25
degree 25
of 25
subordinationof 25
the 25
particular 25

the 25

determine 25
the 25
limits 25
of 25
a 25
science 25
and 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
present 25
case 25
we 25
must 25
expect 25
to 25
find 25
a 25
difference 25
in 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
both 25
in 25
kind 25
and 25
in 25
origin 25
the 25
fundamental 25
idea 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
was 25
obscured 25
on 25
another 25
side 25
by 25
the 25
fact 25
that 25
this 25
kind 25
of 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
showed 25
a 25
certain 25
similarity 25
in 25
character 25
with 25
the 25
science 25
of 25
mathematics 25
both 25
have 25
the 25
property 25
in 25
common 25
of 25
possessing 25
an 25
a 25
priori 25
origin 25
but 25
in 25
the 25
one 25
our 25
knowledge 25
is 25
based 25
upon 25
conceptions 25
in 25
the 25
other 25
on 25
the 25
construction 25
of 25
conceptions 25
thus 25
a 25
decided 25
dissimilarity 25
between 25
philosophical 25
and 25
mathematical 25
cognition 25
comes 25
outa 25
dissimilarity 25
which 25
was 25
always 25
felt 25
but 25
which 25
could 25
not 25
be 25
made 25
distinct 25
for 25
want 25
of 25
an 25
insight 25
into 25
the 25
criteria 25
of 25
the 25
difference 25
and 25
thus 25
it 25
happened 25
that 25
as 25
philosophers 25
themselves 25
failed 25
in 25
the 25
proper 25
development 25
of 25
the 25
idea 25
of 25
their 25
science 25
the 25
elaboration 25
of 25
the 25
science 25
could 25
not 25
proceed 25
with 25
a 25
definite 25
aim 25
or 25
under 25
trustworthy 25
guidance 25
thus 25
too 25
philosophers 25
ignorant 25
of 25
the 25
path 25
they 25
ought 25
to 25
pursue 25
and 25
always 25
disputing 25
with 25
each 25
other 25
regarding 25
the 25
discoveries 25
which 25
each 25
asserted 25
he 25
had 25
made 25
brought 25
their 25
science 25
into 25
disrepute 25
with 25
the 25
rest 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
finally 25
even 25
among 25
themselves 25
all 25
pure 25
a 25
priori 25
cognition 25
forms 25
therefore 25
in 25
view 25
of 25
the 25
peculiar 25
faculty 25
which 25
originates 25

a 25
peculiar 25
and 25
distinct 25
unity 25
and 25
metaphysic 25
is 25
the 25
term 25
applied 25
to 25
the 25
philosophy 25
which 25

to 25

we 25
assign 25

empirical 25

which 25
has 25
always 25
been 25
considered 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
metaphysics 25

from 25
which 25
in 25
our 25
time 25
such 25
important 25
philosophical 25
results 25
have 25
been 25
expected 25
after 25
the 25
hope 25
of 25
constructing 25
an 25
a 25

system 25
of 25
knowledge 25
had 25
been 25
abandoned 25
i 25
answer 25
it 25
must 25
be 25
placed 25
by 25
the 25
side 25
of 25
empirical 25
physics 25
or 25
physics 25
proper 25
that 25
is 25
must 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
forming 25
a 25
part 25
of 25
applied 25
philosophy 25
the 25
a 25
priori 25
principles 25
of 25
which 25
are 25
contained 25
in 25
pure 25
philosophy 25
which 25
is 25
therefore 25
connected 25
although 25
it 25
must 25
not 25
be 25
confounded 25
with 25
psychology 25
empirical 25
psychology 25
must 25
therefore 25
be 25
banished 25
from 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
and 25
is 25
indeed 25
excluded 25
by 25
the 25
very 25
idea 25
of 25
that 25
science 25
in 25
conformity 25
however 25
with 25
scholastic 25
usage 25
we 25
must 25
permit 25
it 25
to 25
occupy 25
a 25
place 25
in 25
metaphysicsbut 25
only 25
as 25
an 25
appendix 25
to 25
it 25
we 25
adopt 25
this 25
course 25
from 25
motives 25
of 25
economy 25
as 25
psychology 25
is 25
not 25
as 25
yet 25
full 25
enough 25
to 25
occupy 25
our 25
attention 25
as 25
an 25
independent 25
study 25
while 25
it 25
is 25
at 25
the 25
same 25
time 25
of 25
too 25
great 25
importance 25
to 25
be 25
entirely 25
excluded 25
or 25
placed 25
where 25
it 25
has 25
still 25
less 25
affinity 25
than 25
it 25
has 25
with 25
the 25
subject 25
of 25

it 25
is 25
a 25
stranger 25
who 25
has 25
been 25
long 25
a 25
guest 25
and 25
we 25
make 25
it 25
welcome 25
to 25
stay 25
until 25
it 25
can 25

up 25

pendant 25
to 25

the 25
above 25
is 25
the 25
general 25
idea 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
which 25

more 25
was 25
expected 25
from 25

than 25
could 25
be 25

justice 25
and 25
as 25
these 25
pleasant 25
expectations 25
were 25
unfortunately 25
never 25
realized 25
fell 25
into 25
general 25
disrepute 25
our 25
critique 25
must 25
have 25
fully 25
convinced 25
the 25
reader 25
that 25
although 25
metaphysics 25
cannot 25
form 25
the 25
foundation 25
of 25
religion 25
it 25
must 25
always 25
be 25
one 25
of 25
its 25
most 25
important 25
bulwarks 25
and 25
that 25
human 25
reason 25
which 25
naturally 25
pursues 25
a 25
dialectical 25
course 25
cannot 25
do 25
without 25
this 25
science 25
which 25
checks 25
its 25
tendencies 25
towards 25
dialectic 25
and 25
by 25
elevating 25
reason 25
to 25
a 25
scientific 25
and 25
clear 25
selfknowledge 25
prevents 25
the 25
ravages 25
which 25
a 25
lawless 25
speculative 25
reason 25
would 25
infallibly 25
commit 25
in 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
morals 25
as 25
well 25
as 25
in 25
that 25
of 25

we 25
may 25
be 25
sure 25
therefore 25
whatever 25
contempt 25
may 25
be 25
thrown 25
upon 25
metaphysics 25
by 25
those 25
who 25
judge 25
a 25
science 25
not 25
by 25
its 25
own 25
nature 25
but 25
according 25
to 25
the 25
accidental 25
effects 25
it 25
may 25
have 25
produced 25
that 25
it 25
can 25
never 25
be 25
completely 25
abandoned 25
that 25
we 25
must 25
always 25
return 25
to 25
it 25
as 25
to 25
a 25
beloved 25
one 25
who 25
has 25
been 25
for 25
a 25
time 25
estranged 25
because 25
the 25
questions 25
with 25
which 25
it 25
is 25
engaged 25
relate 25
to 25
the 25
highest 25

here 25
merely 25
for 25
the 25

have 25
aimed 25
at 25
erecting 25
an 25
edifice 25

to 25
my 25
eye 25
this 25
edifice 25
appears 25
to 25
be 25
in 25
a 25
very 25
ruinous 25
condition 25
it 25
is 25
very 25
remarkable 25
although 25
naturally 25
it 25
could 25
not 25
have 25
been 25
otherwise 25
that 25
in 25
the 25
infancy 25
of 25
philosophy 25
the 25
study 25
of 25
the 25
nature 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
the 25
constitution 25
of 25
a 25
future 25
world 25
formed 25
the 25
commencement 25
rather 25
than 25
the 25
conclusion 25
as 25
we 25
should 25
have 25
it 25
of 25
the 25
speculative 25
efforts 25
of 25
the 25
human 25
mind 25
however 25
rude 25
the 25
religious 25
conceptions 25
generated 25
by 25
the 25
remains 25
of 25
the 25
old 25
manners 25
and 25
customs 25
of 25
a 25
less 25
cultivated 25
time 25
the 25
intelligent 25
classes 25
were 25
not 25
thereby 25
prevented 25
from 25
devoting 25
themselves 25
to 25
free 25
inquiry 25
into 25
the 25
existence 25
and 25
nature 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
they 25
easily 25
saw 25
that 25
there 25
could 25
be 25
no 25
surer 25
way 25
of 25
pleasing 25
the 25
invisible 25
ruler 25
of 25
the 25
world 25
and 25
of 25
attaining 25
to 25
happiness 25
in 25
another 25
world 25
at 25
least 25
than 25
a 25
good 25
and 25
honest 25
course 25
of 25
life 25
in 25
this 25
thus 25
theology 25
and 25
morals 25
formed 25
the 25
two 25
chief 25
motives 25
or 25
rather 25
the 25
points 25
of 25
attraction 25
in 25
all 25
abstract 25
inquiries 25
but 25
it 25
was 25
the 25
former 25
that 25
especially 25
occupied 25
the 25
attention 25
of 25
speculative 25
reason 25
and 25
which 25
afterwards 25
became 25
so 25
celebrated 25
under 25
the 25
name 25
of 25

not 25
at 25

indicate 25
the 25
periods 25
of 25

at 25
which 25
the 25
greatest 25
changes 25
in 25
metaphysics 25
took 25
place 25
but 25
shall 25
merely 25
give 25
a 25
hasty 25
sketch 25
of 25
the 25
different 25
ideas 25
which 25
occasioned 25
the 25
most 25
important 25
revolutions 25
in 25
this 25
sphere 25
of 25
thought 25
there 25
are 25
three 25
different 25
ends 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
which 25
these 25
revolutions 25
have 25
taken 25
place 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
object 25
of 25
the 25
cognition 25
of 25
reason 25
philosophers 25
may 25
be 25
divided 25
into 25
sensualists 25
and 25
intellectualists 25
epicurus 25
may 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
head 25
of 25
the 25
former 25
plato 25
of 25
the 25

the 25
distinction 25
here 25
signalized 25
subtle 25
as 25
it 25

dates 25
from 25
the 25
earliest 25
times 25

was 25

asserted 25
that 25
reality 25
resides 25
in 25
sensuous 25
objects 25
alone 25

that 25
everything 25

that 25
the 25
senses 25
are 25
the 25
parents 25
of 25
illusion 25
and 25
that 25
truth 25
is 25
to 25
be 25
found 25
in 25
the 25
understanding 25
alone 25
the 25
former 25
did 25
not 25
deny 25
to 25
the 25
conceptions 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
a 25
certain 25
kind 25
of 25
reality 25
but 25
with 25
them 25
it 25
was 25
merely 25
logical 25
with 25
the 25
others 25
it 25
was 25
mystical 25
the 25
former 25
admitted 25
intellectual 25
conceptions 25
but 25
declared 25
that 25
sensuous 25
objects 25
alone 25
possessed 25
real 25
existence 25
the 25
latter 25
maintained 25
that 25
all 25
real 25
objects 25
were 25
intelligible 25
and 25
believed 25
that 25
the 25
pure 25
understanding 25
possessed 25
a 25
faculty 25
of 25
intuition 25
apart 25
from 25
sense 25
which 25
in 25
their 25
opinion 25
served 25
only 25
to 25
confuse 25
the 25
ideas 25
of 25
the 25
understanding 25
in 25
relation 25
to 25
the 25
origin 25
of 25
the 25
pure 25
cognitions 25
of 25
reason 25
we 25
find 25
one 25
school 25
maintaining 25
that 25
they 25
are 25
derived 25
entirely 25
from 25
experience 25
and 25
another 25
that 25
they 25
have 25
their 25
origin 25
in 25
reason 25
alone 25
aristotle 25
may 25
be 25
regarded 25
as 25
the 25
bead 25
of 25
the 25
empiricists 25
and 25
plato 25
of 25
the 25
noologists 25

follower 25
of 25
aristotle 25
in 25
modern 25
times 25

in 25
his 25
mysticism 25
have 25
not 25
been 25
able 25
to 25
bring 25
this 25
question 25
to 25
a 25
settled 25
conclusion 25
the 25
procedure 25
of 25
epicurus 25
in 25
his 25
sensual 25
system 25
in 25
which 25
he 25
always 25
restricted 25
his 25
conclusions 25
to 25
the 25
sphere 25
of 25
experience 25
was 25
much 25
more 25
consequent 25
than 25
that 25
of 25
aristotle 25
and 25
locke 25
the 25
latter 25
especially 25
after 25
having 25
derived 25
all 25
the 25
conceptions 25
and 25
principles 25
of 25
the 25
mind 25
from 25
experience 25
goes 25
so 25
far 25
in 25
the 25
employment 25
of 25
these 25
conceptions 25
and 25
principles 25
as 25
to 25
maintain 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
prove 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
and 25
the 25
existence 25
of 25
god 25
and 25

immortality 25
of 25

may 25
divide 25
the 25

at 25
present 25
employed 25
in 25
the 25
field 25
of 25
inquiry 25
into 25
the 25
naturalistic 25
and 25
the 25
scientific 25
the 25
naturalist 25
of 25
pure 25
reason 25
lays 25
it 25
down 25
as 25
his 25
principle 25
that 25
common 25
reason 25
without 25

give 25
a 25
more 25
satisfactory 25
answer 25
to 25
the 25
most 25
important 25
questions 25
of 25
metaphysics 25
than 25
speculation 25
is 25
able 25
to 25
do 25
he 25
must 25
maintain 25
therefore 25
that 25
we 25
can 25
determine 25
the 25
content 25
and 25
circumference 25
of 25
the 25
moon 25
more 25
certainly 25
by 25

naked 25
eye 25
than 25
by 25
the 25
aid 25
of 25
mathematical 25
reasoning 25
but 25
this 25
system 25
is 25
mere 25
misology 25
reduced 25
to 25
principles 25
and 25
what 25
is 25
the 25
most 25
absurd 25
thing 25
in 25
this 25
doctrine 25
the 25
neglect 25
of 25
all 25

means 25
is 25
paraded 25
as 25
a 25
peculiar 25
method 25

extending 25
our 25
cognition 25
as 25
regards 25
those 25
who 25
are 25

they 25

no 25
better 25
they 25
are 25
certainly 25
not 25

be 25
blamed 25

follow 25
common 25
sense 25
without 25
parading 25
their 25
ignorance 25
as 25
a 25
method 25
which 25
is 25
to 25
teach 25
us 25
the 25
wonderful 25
secret 25
how 25

millions 3

being 3
dealt 3
off 3
the 3
bottom 3

the 3

should 3
have 3
offed 3
jimmy 3

in 3
every 3

and 3
we 3
should 3
have 3
cheered 3
ourselves 3
hoarse 3
until 3
we 3
understand 3
the 3
nature 3
of 3
institutional 3
violence 3
and 3
how 3
it 3
manipulates 3
values 3

mores 3
to 3
maintain 3
the 3
power 3
of 3
the 3
few 3
we 3
will 3
forever 3
be 3
imprisoned 3
in 3
the 3
caves 3
of 3
ignorance 3
when 3
we 3
conclude 3
that 3
bank 3
robbers 3
rather 3
than 3
bankers 3
should 3
be 3
the 3
trustees 3
of 3
the 3
universities 3
then 3
we 3
begin 3
to 3
think 3
clearly 3
when 3
we 3
see 3
the 3
army 3
mathematics 3
research 3
and 3
development 3
center 3
and 3
the 3
bank 3
of 3
amerika 3
as 3
cesspools 3
of 3
violence 3
filling 3
the 3
minds 3
of 3
our 3
young 3
with 3
hatred 3
turning 3
one 3
against 3
another 3
then 3
we 3
begin 3
to 3
think 3
revolutionary 3
be 3
clever 3
using 3
section 3

not 3
about 3

with 3
your 3

probe 3
the 3

of 3
your 3

that 3

your 3

the 3

the 3
robots 3
that 3
guard 3
them 3
the 3
duty 3
of 3
a 3
revolutionary 3
is 3
to 3
make 3
love 3
and 3
that 3
means 3
staying 3
alive 3
and 3
free 3
that 3
doesnt 3
allow 3
for 3
copouts 3
smoking 3
dope 3

hanging 3

no 3
more 3
a 3

than 3
drinking 3
milk 3
and 3
collecting 3
postage 3
stamps 3
a 3
revolution 3
in 3

in 3
the 3

the 3
potential 3
for 3
a 3

the 3

as 3
it 3
now 3

was 3
completed 3
in 3
the 3
late 3
summer 3
of 3
for 3
three 3
months 3
manuscripts 3
made 3
the 3
rounds 3
of 3
every 3
major 3
publisher 3
in 3
all 3
over 3
rejections 3
occurred 3
before 3
the 3
decision 3
to 3
publish 3
the 3
book 3
ourselves 3
was 3
made 3
or 3
rather 3
made 3
for 3
us 3
perhaps 3
no 3
other 3
book 3
in 3
modern 3
times 3
presented 3
such 3
a 3
dilemma 3
everyone 3
agreed 3
the 3
book 3
would 3
be 3
a 3
commercial 3
success 3
but 3
even 3
greed 3
had 3
its 3
limits 3
and 3
the 3
irs 3
and 3
fbi 3
following 3
the 3
manuscript 3
with 3
their 3
little 3

had 3
a 3
telling 3
effect 3
thirty 3
yeses 3
become 3
thirty 3
noes 3
after 3
thinking 3
it 3
over 3
liberals 3
who 3
supposedly 3
led 3
the 3
fight 3
against 3
censorship 3
talked 3
of 3
how 3
the 3
book 3
will 3
end 3
free 3
speech 3
finally 3
the 3
day 3
we 3
were 3
bringing 3
the 3
proofs 3
to 3
the 3
printer 3
grove 3
consented 3
to 3
act 3
as 3
distributor 3
to 3
pull 3
a 3
total 3
solo 3
trip 3
including 3
distribution 3
would 3
have 3
been 3
neat 3
but 3
such 3
an 3
effort 3
would 3
be 3
doomed 3
from 3
the 3
start 3
we 3
had 3
tried 3
it 3
before 3
and 3
blew 3
it 3
in 3
fact 3
if 3
anyone 3
is 3
interested 3
in 3
yippie 3
calendars 3
theyve 3
got 3
a 3
deal 3
even 3
with 3
a 3
distributor 3
joining 3
the 3
fight 3
the 3
battle 3
will 3
only 3
begin 3
when 3
the 3
books 3
come 3
off 3
the 3
press 3
there 3
is 3
a 3
saying 3
that 3
freedom 3
of 3
the 3
press 3
belongs 3
to 3
those 3
who 3
own 3
one 3
in 3
past 3
eras 3
this 3
was 3
probably 3
the 3
case 3
but 3
now 3
high 3
speed 3
methods 3
of 3
typesetting 3
offset 3
printing 3
and 3
a 3
host 3
of 3
other 3
developments 3
have 3
made 3
substantial 3
reductions 3
in 3
printing 3
costs 3
literally 3
anyone 3
is 3
free 3
to 3
print 3
their 3
own 3
works 3
in 3
even 3
the 3
most 3
repressive 3
society 3
imaginable 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
away 3
with 3
some 3
form 3
of 3
private 3
publishing 3
because 3
amerika 3
allows 3
this 3
does 3
not 3
make 3
it 3
the 3
democracy 3
jefferson 3
envisioned 3
repressive 3
tolerance 3
is 3
a 3
real 3
phenomenon 3
to 3
talk 3
of 3
true 3
freedom 3
of 3
the 3
press 3
we 3
must 3
talk 3
of 3
the 3
availability 3
of 3
the 3
channels 3
of 3
communication 3
that 3
are 3
designed 3
to 3
reach 3
the 3
entire 3
population 3
or 3
at 3
least 3
that 3
segment 3
of 3
the 3
population 3
that 3
might 3
participate 3
in 3
such 3
a 3
dialogue 3
freedom 3

the 3

belongs 3
to 3
those 3
that 3
own 3
the 3
distribution 3
system 3
perhaps 3
that 3
has 3
always 3
been 3
the 3
case 3
but 3
in 3
a 3
mass 3
society 3
where 3
nearly 3
everyone 3
is 3
instantaneously 3
plugged 3
into 3
a 3
variety 3
of 3
national 3
communications 3
systems 3
widespread 3
dissemination 3
of 3
the 3
information 3
is 3
the 3
crux 3
of 3
the 3
matter 3
to 3
make 3
the 3
claim 3
that 3
the 3
right 3
to 3
print 3
your 3
own 3
book 3
means 3
freedom 3
of 3
the 3
press 3
is 3
to 3
completely 3
misunderstand 3
the 3
nature 3
of 3
a 3
mass 3
society 3
it 3
is 3
like 3
making 3
the 3
claim 3
that 3
anyone 3
with 3
a 3
pushcart 3
can 3
challenge 3
safeway 3

that 3

the 3
biggest 3
challenge 3

face 3

the 3
fact 3
that 3
it 3
even 3
exists 3
it 3
is 3
a 3
much 3
better 3

few 3
cases 3
infiltrating 3
an 3

probably 3
the 3
best 3
way 3
to 3
steal 3

she 3
had 3

an 3
efficient 3
cashier 3
that 3
he 3

bon 3
appetit 3
food 3
conspiracies 3
forming 3
a 3
food 3
cooperative 3
is 3
one 3
of 3
the 3
best 3
ways 3
to 3
promote 3
solidarity 3
and 3
get 3
every 3
kind 3
of 3
food 3
you 3
need 3
to 3
survive 3
real 3
cheap 3
it 3
also 3
provides 3
a 3
readymade 3
bridge 3
for 3
developing 3
alliances 3
with 3
blacks 3
puerto 3
ricans 3
chicanos 3
and 3
other 3
groups 3
fighting 3
our 3
common 3
oppressor 3
on 3
a 3
community 3
level 3
call 3
a 3
meeting 3
of 3
about 3
communes 3
collectives 3
or 3
community 3
organizations 3
set 3
up 3
the 3
ground 3
rules 3
there 3
should 3
be 3
a 3
hardcore 3
of 3
really 3
good 3
hustlers 3
that 3
serve 3
as 3
the 3
shopping 3
or 3
hunting 3
party 3
and 3
another 3
group 3
of 3
people 3
who 3
have 3
their 3
heads 3
together 3
enough 3
to 3
keep 3
records 3
and 3
run 3
the 3
central 3
distribution 3
center 3
two 3
or 3
three 3
in 3
each 3
group 3
should 3
do 3
it 3
they 3
can 3
get 3
their 3
food 3
free 3
for 3
the 3
effort 3
another 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
rotate 3
the 3
activity 3
among 3
all 3
members 3
of 3
the 3
conspiracy 3
the 3
method 3
you 3
choose 3
depends 3
upon 3
your 3
politics 3
and 3
whether 3
you 3
favor 3
a 3
division 3
of 3
labor 3
or 3
using 3
the 3
food 3
conspiracy 3
as 3
a 3
training 3
for 3
collective 3
living 3
probably 3
a 3
blend 3
of 3
the 3
two 3
is 3
best 3
but 3
youll 3
have 3
to 3
hassle 3
that 3
out 3
for 3
yourself 3
the 3
next 3
thing 3
to 3
agree 3
upon 3
is 3
how 3
the 3
operation 3
and 3
all 3
the 3
shit 3
you 3
get 3
will 3
be 3
paid 3
for 3
this 3
is 3
dependent 3
on 3
a 3
number 3
of 3
variables 3
so 3
well 3
map 3
out 3
one 3
scheme 3
and 3
you 3
can 3
modify 3
it 3
to 3
suit 3
your 3
particular 3
situation 3
each 3
member 3
of 3
every 3
commune 3
could 3
be 3
assessed 3
a 3
fee 3
for 3
joining 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
get 3
together 3
about 3
so 3
at 3
members 3
this 3
is 3
ten 3
bucks 3
a 3
piece 3
after 3
the 3
joining 3
fee 3
each 3
person 3
or 3
group 3
has 3
to 3
pay 3
only 3
for 3
the 3
low 3
budget 3
food 3
they 3
order 3
but 3
some 3
loot 3
is 3
needed 3
to 3
get 3
things 3
rolling 3
the 3
money 3
goes 3
to 3
getting 3
a 3
store 3
front 3
or 3
garage 3
a 3
cheap 3
truck 3
some 3
scales 3
freezers 3
bags 3
shelving 3
chopping 3
blocks 3
slicer 3
and 3
whatever 3
else 3
you 3
need 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
great 3
deals 3
by 3
looking 3
in 3
the 3
classified 3
ads 3
of 3
the 3
local 3
overground 3
newspaper 3
and 3
checking 3
for 3
restaurants 3
or 3
markets 3
going 3
out 3
of 3
business 3
remember 3
the 3
idea 3
of 3
a 3
conspiracy 3
is 3
to 3
get 3
tons 3
of 3
stuff 3
at 3
real 3
low 3
prices 3
or 3
free 3
into 3
a 3
store 3
front 3
and 3
then 3
break 3
it 3
down 3
into 3
smaller 3
units 3
for 3
each 3
group 3
and 3
eventually 3
each 3
member 3
the 3
freezers 3
allow 3
you 3
to 3
store 3
perishables 3
for 3
a 3
longer 3
time 3
the 3
hunting 3
party 3
should 3
be 3
well 3
acquainted 3
with 3
how 3
to 3
rip 3
off 3
shit 3
totally 3
free 3
and 3
where 3
all 3
the 3
best 3
deals 3
are 3
to 3
be 3
found 3
they 3
should 3
know 3
what 3
food 3
is 3
seasonal 3
and 3
about 3
nutritional 3
diets 3
there 3
is 3
a 3
lot 3
to 3
learn 3
such 3
as 3
where 3
to 3
get 3
raw 3
grains 3
in 3

lots 3
and 3
how 3
to 3
cut 3
up 3
a 3
side 3
of 3
beef 3
a 3
good 3
idea 3
is 3
to 3
get 3
a 3
diet 3
freak 3
to 3
give 3
weekly 3
talks 3
in 3
the 3

also 3
be 3
cooking 3

makes 3
a 3
lot 3
of 3
nitty 3
gritty 3
sense 3
after 3
your 3
conspiracy 3
gets 3
off 3
the 3
ground 3

looks 3
permanent 3
you 3
should 3
seek 3
to 3
expand 3
it 3
to 3
include 3
more 3
members 3
and 3
an 3

set 3
up 3
in 3
case 3
something 3
happens 3
in 3
the 3

illegal 3
the 3

then 3
let 3
your 3
thumb 3

illegal 3
but 3
you 3
wont 3

hassled 3
if 3

fuckedup 3
exit 3
take 3
your 3
chances 3
hitching 3
right 3
on 3

but 3
keep 3
a 3
sharp 3
eye 3
out 3
for 3
porkers 3
when 3

at 3
a 3
good 3
spot 3
dont 3
take 3
a 3
ride 3
under 3
a 3
hundred 3
miles 3
that 3
wont 3
end 3
up 3
in 3
a 3
location 3
just 3
as 3
good 3
when 3
the 3
driver 3
is 3
headed 3
to 3
an 3
outoftheway 3

you 3
get 3
stuck 3
on 3
the 3
wrong 3

would 3
be 3
wise 3
to 3
even 3
hoof 3
it 3
through 3
the 3
place 3
getting 3
to 3
a 3
point 3
on 3

road 3
where 3
the 3
cars 3
are 3
intercity 3
rather 3
than 3
local 3
traffic 3
is 3
always 3
preferable 3
when 3
you 3
hit 3
the 3
road 3
you 3
should 3
have 3
a 3
good 3
idea 3

and 3
find 3
out 3
what 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
know 3
always 3
carry 3
a 3
sign 3
indicating 3
where 3
you 3
are 3
going 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
stranded 3

make 3
the 3

they 3
can 3
be 3
seen 3
by 3

a 3
distance 3
if 3
your 3

really 3
long 3
distances 3
east 3
or 3
west 3

youre 3

not 3

pulls 3
up 3
tell 3
them 3
you 3
are 3
kanadian 3
and 3
hitching 3
through 3
amerika 3
highway 3
patrols 3
are 3
very 3
uptight 3
about 3
promoting 3
incidents 3
with 3
foreigners 3
the 3
foreign 3
bit 3
goes 3
over 3
especially 3
well 3
with 3
smalltown 3
types 3
and 3
is 3
also 3
amazingly 3
good 3
for 3
avoiding 3
hassles 3
with 3
greasers 3
if 3
you 3
cant 3
hack 3
this 3
one 3
tell 3
them 3
you 3
are 3
a 3
reporter 3
for 3
a 3
newspaper 3
writing 3
a 3
feature 3
story 3
on 3
hitching 3
around 3
the 3
country 3
this 3
story 3
has 3
averted 3
many 3
a 3
bust 3
dont 3
be 3
shy 3
when 3
you 3
hitch 3
go 3
into 3
diners 3
and 3
gas 3
stations 3
and 3
ask 3
people 3
if 3
theyre 3
heading 3
east 3
or 3
to 3
texas 3
sometimes 3
gas 3
station 3
attendants 3
will 3
help 3
when 3
in 3
the 3
car 3
be 3
friendly 3
as 3
hell 3
offer 3
to 3
share 3
the 3
driving 3
if 3
youve 3
got 3
a 3
license 3
if 3
youre 3
broke 3
you 3
can 3
usually 3
bum 3
a 3
meal 3
or 3
a 3
few 3
bucks 3
maybe 3
even 3
a 3
free 3
nights 3
lodging 3
never 3
be 3
intimidated 3
into 3
giving 3
money 3
for 3
a 3
ride 3
as 3
for 3
what 3
to 3
carry 3
when 3
hitching 3
the 3
advice 3
is 3
to 3
travel 3
light 3
the 3
rule 3
is 3
to 3
make 3
up 3
a 3
pack 3
of 3
the 3
absolute 3
minimum 3
then 3
cut 3
that 3
in 3
half 3
hitching 3
is 3
an 3
art 3
form 3
as 3
is 3
all 3
survival 3
master 3
it 3
and 3
youll 3
travel 3
on 3
a 3
free 3
trip 3
forever 3
freighting 3
there 3
is 3
a 3
way 3
to 3
hitch 3
long 3
distances 3
that 3
has 3
certain 3
advantages 3
over 3
letting 3
your 3
thumb 3
hang 3
out 3
for 3
hours 3
on 3
some 3
twolaner 3
learn 3
about 3
riding 3
the 3
trains 3
and 3
youll 3
always 3
have 3
that 3
alternative 3
hitchhiking 3
at 3
night 3
can 3
be 3
impossible 3
but 3
hopping 3
a 3
is 3
easier 3
at 3
night 3
than 3
by 3
day 3
by 3
hitchhiking 3
days 3
and 3
hopping 3
freights 3
and 3
sleeping 3
on 3
them 3
at 3
night 3
you 3
can 3
cover 3
incredible 3
distances 3
rapidly 3
and 3
stay 3
well 3
rested 3
every 3
city 3
and 3
most 3
large 3
towns 3
have 3
a 3
freight 3
yard 3
you 3
can 3
find 3
it 3
by 3
following 3
the 3
tracks 3
or 3
asking 3
where 3
the 3
freight 3
yard 3
is 3
located 3
when 3
you 3
get 3
to 3
the 3
yard 3
ask 3
the 3
workmen 3
when 3
the 3
next 3
train 3
leaving 3
in 3
your 3
direction 3
will 3
be 3
pulling 3
out 3
unlike 3
the 3
phony 3
hollywood 3
image 3
railroad 3
men 3
are 3
nice 3
to 3
folks 3
who 3
drop 3
by 3
to 3
grab 3
a 3
ride 3
most 3
yards 3
dont 3
have 3
a 3
guard 3
or 3
a 3
bull 3
as 3
they 3
are 3
called 3
even 3
if 3
they 3
do 3
he 3
is 3
generally 3
not 3
around 3
if 3
there 3
is 3
a 3
bull 3
around 3
the 3
most 3
hes 3
going 3
to 3
do 3
is 3
tell 3
you 3
its 3
private 3
property 3
and 3
ask 3
you 3
to 3
leave 3
there 3
are 3
exceptions 3
to 3
this 3
rule 3
such 3
as 3
the 3
notorious 3
lincoln 3
nebraska 3
and 3
las 3
vegas 3
nevada 3
but 3
by 3
asking 3
you 3
can 3
find 3
out 3
even 3
if 3
he 3
asks 3
you 3
to 3
leave 3
or 3
throws 3
you 3
out 3
sneak 3
back 3
when 3
your 3
train 3
is 3
pulling 3
out 3
and 3
jump 3
aboard 3
after 3
youve 3
located 3
the 3
right 3
train 3
for 3
your 3
trip 3
hunt 3
for 3
an 3
empty 3
boxcar 3
to 3
ride 3
the 3
men 3
in 3
the 3
yards 3
will 3
generally 3
point 3
one 3
out 3
if 3
you 3
ask 3
pigsties 3
flat 3
cars 3
and 3
coal 3
cars 3
are 3
definitely 3
third 3
class 3
due 3
to 3
exposure 3
to 3
the 3
elements 3
boxcars 3
are 3
by 3
far 3
the 3
best 3
they 3
are 3
clean 3
and 3
the 3
roof 3
over 3
your 3
head 3
helps 3
in 3
bad 3
weather 3
and 3
cuts 3
down 3
the 3
wind 3
boxcars 3
with 3
a 3
hydrocushion 3
suspension 3
system 3
used 3
for 3
carrying 3
fragile 3
cargo 3
make 3
for 3
the 3
smoothest 3
ride 3
unless 3
you 3
get 3
one 3
you 3
should 3
be 3
prepared 3
for 3
a 3
pretty 3
bumpy 3
and 3
noisy 3
voyage 3
you 3
should 3
avoid 3
cars 3
with 3
only 3
one 3
door 3
open 3
because 3
the 3
pin 3
may 3
break 3
locking 3
you 3
in 3
a 3
car 3
with 3
both 3
doors 3
open 3
gives 3
you 3
one 3
free 3
chance 3
pigbacks 3
trailers 3
on 3
flatcars 3
are 3
generally 3
considered 3
unsafe 3
most 3
trains 3
make 3
a 3
number 3
of 3
short 3
hops 3
so 3
if 3
time 3
is 3
an 3
important 3
factor 3
try 3
to 3
get 3
on 3
a 3
hot 3
shot 3
express 3
a 3
hot 3
shot 3
travels 3
faster 3
and 3
has 3
priority 3
over 3
other 3
trains 3
in 3
crowded 3
yards 3
you 3
should 3
favor 3
a 3
hot 3
shot 3
even 3
if 3
you 3
have 3
to 3
wait 3
an 3
extra 3
hour 3
or 3
two 3
or 3
more 3
to 3
get 3
one 3
going 3
your 3
way 3
if 3
youre 3
traveling 3
at 3
night 3
be 3
sure 3
to 3
dress 3
warmly 3
you 3
can 3
freeze 3
your 3
ass 3
off 3
trains 3
might 3
not 3
offer 3
the 3
most 3
comfortable 3
ride 3
but 3
they 3
go 3
through 3
beautiful 3
countryside 3
that 3
youd 3
never 3
see 3
from 3
the 3
highway 3
or 3
airway 3
there 3
are 3
no 3
billboards 3
road 3
signs 3
cops 3
jackintheboxes 3
gas 3
stations 3
or 3
other 3
artifacts 3
of 3
honky 3
culture 3
youll 3
get 3
dirty 3
on 3
the 3
trains 3
so 3
wear 3
old 3
clothes 3
dont 3
pass 3
up 3
this 3
great 3
way 3
to 3
travel 3
cause 3
some 3
bullshit 3
western 3
scared 3
you 3
out 3
of 3

cars 3
if 3
you 3
know 3
how 3
to 3
drive 3
and 3
want 3
to 3
travel 3
long 3
distances 3
the 3
auto 3
transportation 3
agencies 3
are 3
a 3
good 3
deal 3
look 3
in 3
the 3
yellow 3
pages 3
under 3
automobile 3
transportation 3
and 3
trucking 3
or 3
driveway 3
rules 3
vary 3
but 3
normally 3
you 3
must 3
be 3
over 3
and 3
have 3
a 3
valid 3
license 3
call 3
up 3
and 3
tell 3
them 3
when 3
and 3
where 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
go 3
and 3
they 3
will 3
let 3
you 3
know 3
if 3
they 3
have 3
a 3
car 3
available 3
they 3
give 3
you 3
the 3
car 3
and 3
a 3
tank 3
of 3
gas 3
free 3
you 3
pay 3
the 3
rest 3
go 3
to 3
pick 3
up 3
the 3
car 3
alone 3
then 3
get 3
some 3
people 3
to 3
ride 3
along 3
and 3
help 3
with 3
the 3
driving 3
and 3
expenses 3
you 3
can 3
make 3
new 3
york 3
to 3
san 3
francisco 3
for 3
about 3
eighty 3
dollars 3
in 3
tolls 3
and 3
gas 3
in 3
four 3
days 3
without 3
pushing 3
usually 3
you 3
have 3
the 3
car 3
for 3
longer 3
and 3
can 3
make 3
a 3
whole 3
thing 3
out 3
of 3
it 3
you 3
must 3
look 3
straight 3
when 3
you 3
go 3
to 3
the 3
agency 3
this 3
can 3
be 3
simply 3
be 3
done 3
by 3
wetting 3
down 3

you 3

realized 3
until 3
now 3
that 3
the 3
law 3
of 3
gravity 3
affects 3
economics 3
another 3
way 3
is 3
to 3
park 3
in 3
a 3
service 3
station 3
over 3
their 3
filler 3
hole 3
lift 3

run 3
down 3
twenty 3
feet 3
of 3
rubber 3
tubing 3
thru 3
the 3
hole 3
youve 3
cut 3
in 3
your 3
floorboard 3
then 3
turn 3
on 3
the 3
electric 3
pump 3
which 3
you 3
have 3
installed 3
to 3
feed 3
into 3
your 3
gas 3
tank 3
all 3
they 3
ever 3
see 3
is 3
a 3
parked 3
car 3
this 3
technique 3
is 3
especially 3
rewarding 3
when 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
bus 3
buses 3
if 3
youd 3
rather 3
leave 3
the 3
driving 3
and 3
the 3

to 3
them 3
try 3
swiping 3
a 3
ride 3
on 3
the 3
bus 3
heres 3
a 3
method 3
that 3
has 3
worked 3
well 3
get 3
a 3
rough 3
idea 3
of 3
where 3
the 3
bus 3
has 3
stopped 3
before 3
it 3
arrived 3
at 3
your 3
station 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
not 3
at 3
the 3
beginning 3
or 3
final 3
stop 3
on 3
the 3
route 3
wait 3
until 3
the 3
bus 3
you 3
want 3
pulls 3
in 3
and 3
then 3
out 3
of 3
the 3
station 3
make 3
like 3
the 3
bus 3
just 3
pulled 3
off 3
without 3
you 3
while 3
you 3
went 3
to 3
the 3
bathroom 3
if 3
there 3
is 3
a 3
station 3
master 3
complain 3
like 3
crazy 3
to 3
him 3
tell 3
him 3
youre 3
going 3
to 3
sue 3
the 3
company 3
if 3
your 3
luggage 3
gets 3
stolen 3
hell 3
put 3
you 3
on 3
the 3
next 3
bus 3
for 3
free 3
if 3
there 3
is 3
no 3
station 3
master 3
lay 3
your 3
sad 3
tale 3
on 3
the 3
next 3
driver 3
that 3
comes 3
along 3
if 3
you 3
know 3
when 3
the 3
last 3
bus 3
left 3
just 3
tell 3
the 3
driver 3
youve 3
been 3
stranded 3
there 3
for 3
eight 3
hours 3
and 3
you 3
left 3
your 3
kid 3
sleeping 3
on 3
the 3
other 3
bus 3
tell 3
him 3
you 3
called 3
ahead 3
to 3
the 3
company 3
and 3
they 3
said 3
to 3
grab 3
the 3
next 3
bus 3
and 3
they 3
would 3
take 3
care 3
of 3
it 3
the 3
next 3
method 3
isnt 3
totally 3
free 3
but 3
close 3
enough 3
its 3
called 3
the 3
hopperbopper 3
find 3
a 3
bus 3
that 3
makes 3
a 3
few 3
stops 3
before 3
it 3
gets 3
to 3
where 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
go 3
the 3
more 3
stops 3
with 3
people 3
getting 3
in 3
our 3
out 3
the 3
better 3
buy 3
a 3
ticket 3
for 3
the 3
short 3
hop 3
and 3
stay 3
on 3
the 3
bus 3
until 3
you 3
end 3
up 3
at 3
your 3
destination 3
you 3
must 3
develop 3
a 3
whole 3
style 3
in 3
order 3
to 3
pull 3
this 3
off 3
because 3
the 3
driver 3
has 3
to 3
forget 3
you 3
are 3
connected 3
with 3
the 3
ticket 3
you 3
gave 3
him 3
dress 3
unobtrusively 3
or 3
make 3
sure 3
the 3
driver 3
hasnt 3
seen 3
your 3
face 3
pretend 3
to 3
be 3
asleep 3
when 3
the 3
short 3
hop 3
station 3
is 3
reached 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
questioned 3
just 3
act 3
upset 3
about 3
sleeping 3
through 3
the 3
stop 3
you 3
really 3
want 3
and 3
ask 3
if 3
its 3
possible 3
to 3
get 3
a 3
ride 3
back 3
airlines 3
up 3
and 3
away 3
junior 3
outlaws 3
if 3
you 3
really 3
want 3
to 3
get 3
where 3
youre 3
going 3
in 3
a 3
hurry 3
dont 3
forget 3
skyjackers 3
paradise 3
dont 3
forget 3
the 3
airlines 3
they 3
make 3
an 3
unbelievable 3
amount 3
of 3
bread 3
on 3
their 3
inflated 3
prices 3
ruin 3
the 3
land 3
with 3
incredible 3
amounts 3
of 3
polluting 3
wastes 3
and 3
noise 3
and 3
deliberately 3
hold 3
back 3
aviation 3
advances 3
that 3
would 3
reduce 3
prices 3
and 3
time 3
of 3
flight 3
we 3
know 3
two 3
foolproof 3
methods 3
to 3
fly 3
free 3
but 3
unfortunately 3
we 3
feel 3
publishing 3
them 3
would 3
cause 3
the 3
airlines 3
to 3
change 3
their 3
policy 3
the 3
following 3
methods 3
have 3
been 3
talked 3
about 3
enough 3
so 3
the 3
time 3
seems 3
right 3
to 3
make 3
them 3
known 3
to 3
a 3
larger 3
circle 3
of 3
friends 3
a 3
word 3
should 3
be 3
said 3
right 3
off 3
about 3
stolen 3
tickets 3
literally 3
millions 3
of 3
dollars 3
worth 3
of 3
airline 3
tickets 3
are 3
stolen 3
each 3
year 3
if 3
you 3
have 3
good 3
underworld 3
contacts 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
a 3
ticket 3
to 3
anywhere 3
you 3
want 3
at 3
onefourth 3
the 3
regular 3
price 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
charged 3
more 3
you 3
are 3
getting 3
a 3
slight 3
rooking 3
in 3
any 3
case 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
a 3
ticket 3
for 3
any 3
flight 3
or 3
date 3
and 3
just 3
trade 3
it 3
in 3
they 3
are 3
actually 3
as 3
good 3
as 3
cash 3
except 3
that 3
it 3
takes 3
days 3
to 3
get 3
a 3
refund 3
and 3
by 3
then 3
they 3
might 3
have 3
traced 3
the 3
stolen 3
tickets 3
if 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
a 3
stolen 3
ticket 3
exchange 3
or 3
use 3
it 3
as 3
soon 3
as 3
possible 3

always 3
fly 3
under 3
a 3
phony 3

uptight 3
in 3
the 3

up 3
to 3
another 3

have 3
the 3
tickets 3
exchanged 3
one 3
gutsy 3
way 3
to 3
hitch 3
a 3
free 3
ride 3
is 3
to 3
board 3
the 3
plane 3
without 3
a 3

this 3
is 3
how 3
it 3
works 3
locate 3
the 3
flight 3
you 3
want 3
and 3
rummage 3
through 3
a 3
wastebasket 3
until 3
you 3
find 3
an 3
envelope 3
for 3
that 3
particular 3
airline 3
shuffle 3
by 3
the 3
counter 3
men 3
which 3
is 3
fairly 3
easy 3
if 3
its 3
busy 3
when 3
the 3
boarding 3
call 3
is 3
made 3
stand 3
in 3
line 3
and 3
get 3
on 3
the 3
plane 3
flash 3
the 3
empty 3

at 3
the 3

the 3
plane 3
carry 3
a 3
number 3
of 3
packages 3
as 3
a 3
decoy 3
so 3
the 3
stewardess 3
won 3
t 3
ask 3
you 3
to 3
open 3
the 3
envelope 3

ask 3
the 3
first 3
group 3

hiplooking 3
folks 3
where 3
you 3
can 3
crash 3
you 3
might 3
try 3
the 3
office 3
of 3
the 3
local 3
underground 3
newspaper 3
in 3
any 3
hip 3
community 3
the 3
underground 3
newspaper 3
is 3
generally 3
the 3
source 3
of 3
the 3
best 3
uptothemoment 3
information 3
but 3
remember 3
that 3
they 3
are 3
very 3
busy 3
and 3
dont 3
impose 3
on 3
them 3
many 3
churches 3
now 3
have 3
runaway 3
houses 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
under 3
sixteen 3
and 3
can 3
hack 3
some 3
bullshit 3
jive 3
about 3
adjusting 3
opening 3
a 3
dialogue 3
and 3
things 3
arent 3
that 3
bad 3
then 3
these 3
are 3
the 3
best 3
deals 3
for 3
free 3
room 3
and 3
board 3
check 3
out 3
the 3
ground 3
rules 3
first 3
ie 3
length 3
of 3
stay 3
allowed 3
if 3
they 3
inform 3
your 3
parents 3
or 3
police 3
facilities 3
and 3
services 3
available 3
almost 3
always 3
they 3
can 3
be 3
accepted 3
at 3
their 3
word 3
which 3
is 3
something 3
very 3
sacred 3
to 3
missionaries 3
if 3
they 3
became 3
known 3
as 3
doublecrossers 3
the 3
programs 3
would 3
be 3
finished 3
some 3
hip 3
communities 3
have 3
crash 3
pads 3
set 3
up 3
but 3
these 3
rarely 3
last 3
more 3
than 3
a 3
few 3
months 3
to 3
give 3
out 3
the 3
addresses 3
we 3
have 3
would 3
be 3
quite 3
impractical 3
we 3
have 3
never 3
run 3
across 3
a 3
crash 3
pad 3
that 3
lasted 3
more 3
than 3
a 3
month 3
or 3
so 3
if 3
in 3
a 3
cit 3
try 3
hustling 3
a 3
room 3
at 3
a 3
college 3
dorm 3
this 3
is 3
especially 3
good 3
in 3
summer 3
or 3
on 3
weekends 3
if 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
sleeping 3
bag 3
the 3
parks 3
are 3
always 3
good 3
as 3
is 3
tar 3
jungle 3
or 3
sleeping 3
on 3
the 3
roofs 3
of 3
tall 3
buildings 3
local 3
folks 3
will 3
give 3
you 3
some 3
good 3
advice 3
on 3
what 3
to 3
watch 3
out 3
for 3
and 3
information 3
on 3
vagrancy 3
laws 3
which 3
might 3
help 3
you 3
avoid 3
getting 3
busted 3
for 3
more 3
permanent 3
needs 3
squatting 3
is 3
not 3
only 3
free 3
its 3
a 3
revolutionary 3
act 3
if 3
you 3
stay 3
quiet 3
you 3
can 3
stay 3
indefinitely 3
if 3
you 3
have 3
community 3
support 3
you 3
may 3
last 3
forever 3
communes 3
in 3
the 3
city 3
or 3
in 3
the 3
country 3
communes 3
can 3
be 3
a 3
cheap 3
and 3
enjoyable 3
way 3
of 3
living 3
although 3
urban 3
and 3
rural 3
communes 3
face 3
different 3
physical 3
environments 3
they 3
share 3
common 3
group 3
problems 3
the 3
most 3
important 3
element 3
in 3
communal 3
living 3
is 3
the 3
people 3
for 3
the 3
commune 3
will 3
only 3
make 3
it 3
if 3
everyone 3
is 3
fairly 3
compatible 3
a 3
nucleus 3
of 3
to 3
people 3
is 3
best 3
and 3
it 3
is 3
necessary 3
that 3
no 3
member 3
feels 3
extremely 3
hostile 3
to 3
any 3
other 3
member 3
when 3
the 3
commune 3
gets 3
started 3
the 3
idea 3
that 3
things 3
will 3
work 3
out 3
later 3
is 3
pig 3
swill 3
more 3
communes 3
have 3
busted 3
up 3
over 3
incompatibility 3
than 3
any 3
other 3
single 3
factor 3
people 3
of 3
similar 3
interests 3
and 3
political 3
philosophies 3
should 3
live 3
together 3
one 3
speed 3
freak 3
can 3
wreck 3
almost 3
any 3
group 3
there 3
are 3
just 3
too 3
many 3
daytoday 3
hassles 3
involved 3
living 3
in 3
a 3
commune 3
to 3
not 3
start 3
off 3
compatible 3
in 3
as 3
many 3
ways 3
as 3
possible 3
the 3
ideal 3
arrangement 3
is 3
for 3
the 3
people 3
to 3
have 3
known 3
each 3
other 3
before 3
they 3
move 3
in 3
together 3
once 3
you 3
have 3
made 3
the 3
opening 3
moves 3
evening 3
meetings 3
will 3
occasionally 3
be 3
necessary 3
to 3
divide 3
up 3
the 3
responsibilities 3
and 3
work 3
out 3
the 3
unique 3
problems 3
of 3
a 3
communal 3
family 3
basically 3
there 3
are 3
two 3
areas 3
that 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
pretty 3
well 3
agreed 3
upon 3
if 3
the 3
commune 3
is 3
to 3
survive 3
peoples 3
attitudes 3
toward 3
politics 3
sex 3
drugs 3
and 3
decisionmaking 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
in 3
fairly 3
close 3
agreement 3
then 3
the 3
even 3
most 3
important 3
decisions 3
about 3
raising 3
the 3
rent 3
cleaning 3
cooking 3
and 3
maintenance 3
will 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
made 3
ground 3
rules 3
for 3
inviting 3
nonmembers 3
should 3
be 3
worked 3
out 3
before 3
the 3
first 3
time 3
it 3
happens 3
as 3
this 3
is 3
a 3
common 3
cause 3
for 3
friction 3
another 3
increasingly 3
important 3
issue 3
involves 3
defense 3
communes 3
have 3
continually 3
been 3
targets 3
of 3
attack 3
by 3
the 3
more 3
neanderthal 3
elements 3
of 3
the 3
surrounding 3
community 3
in 3
minneapolis 3
for 3
example 3
headhunts 3
as 3
they 3
are 3
called 3
are 3
commonplace 3
you 3
should 3
have 3
full 3
knowledge 3
of 3
the 3
local 3
gun 3
laws 3
and 3
a 3
collective 3
defense 3
should 3
be 3
worked 3
out 3
physical 3
attacks 3
are 3
just 3
one 3
way 3
of 3
making 3
war 3
on 3
communes 3
and 3
hence 3
our 3
free 3
nation 3
laws 3
cops 3
and 3
courts 3
are 3
there 3
to 3
protect 3
the 3
power 3
and 3
the 3
property 3
of 3

the 3
next 3
set 3

youll 3

youll 3
want 3
to 3
engage 3
in 3
cattle 3

are 3
different 3
than 3
vegetable 3

farms 3
come 3
in 3
sizes 3
from 3
half 3
an 3

to 3

larger 3
than 3
the 3

connecticut 3
they 3
will 3
run 3
in 3
price 3
from 3
to 3
an 3
acre 3
with 3
the 3
most 3
expensive 3
being 3
prime 3
farmland 3
in 3
fertile 3
river 3
valleys 3
located 3
close 3
to 3
an 3
urban 3

the 3
further 3
away 3
from 3
the 3
city 3
and 3
the 3
further 3
up 3
a 3
hill 3
the 3
cheaper 3
the 3
land 3
gets 3
it 3
also 3
gets 3
woodier 3
rockier 3
and 3
steeper 3
which 3
means 3
less 3
tillable 3
land 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
talking 3
of 3
living 3
in 3
a 3
farm 3
house 3
and 3
maybe 3
having 3
a 3
small 3

and 3
some 3

your 3
own 3

you 3
are 3
looking 3
for 3
what 3
is 3
called 3
a 3
recreational 3
farm 3
when 3
you 3
buy 3
a 3

naturally 3

unless 3
these 3
are 3
in 3
unusually 3
good 3
condition 3
or 3
unique 3
they 3
do 3
not 3
enter 3
into 3
the 3
sale 3
price 3
as 3
major 3
factors 3
it 3
is 3
the 3

itself 3
that 3

feet 3
the 3
total 3

thus 3
if 3
a 3

you 3
can 3
forget 3
about 3
it 3
for 3

few 3
years 3
or 3
until 3
you 3
wish 3
to 3
get 3

doctors 3
are 3
reluctant 3
to 3
prescribe 3
them 3
for 3
women 3
who 3
have 3
not 3
borne 3
children 3
or 3
had 3
an 3
abortion 3
because 3
of 3
the 3
intense 3
pain 3
that 3
accompanies 3
insertion 3
but 3
if 3
you 3
can 3
stand 3
the 3
pain 3
associated 3
with 3
three 3
to 3
four 3
uterine 3
contractions 3
you 3
should 3
push 3
the 3
doctor 3
for 3
this 3
method 3
inserting 3
it 3
during 3
the 3
last 3
day 3
of 3
your 3
period 3
will 3
make 3
it 3
easier 3
the 3
diaphragm 3
is 3
a 3
round 3
piece 3
of 3
flexible 3
rubber 3
about 3
inches 3
in 3
diameter 3
with 3
a 3
hard 3
rubber 3
rim 3
on 3
the 3
outside 3
it 3
used 3
to 3
be 3
inserted 3
just 3
before 3
the 3
sex 3
act 3
but 3
hip 3
doctors 3
now 3
recommend 3
that 3
it 3
be 3
worn 3
continuously 3
and 3
taken 3
out 3
every 3
few 3
days 3
for 3
washing 3
and 3
also 3
during 3
the 3
menstrual 3
period 3
it 3
is 3
most 3
effective 3
when 3
used 3
with 3
a 3
spermkilling 3
jelly 3
or 3
cream 3
a 3
doctor 3
will 3
fit 3
you 3
for 3
a 3
proper 3
size 3
diaphragm 3
the 3
next 3
best 3
method 3
is 3
the 3
foams 3
that 3
you 3
insert 3
twenty 3
minutes 3
before 3
fucking 3
the 3
best 3
foams 3
available 3
are 3
delfen 3
and 3
emko 3
they 3
have 3
the 3
advantage 3
of 3
being 3
nonprescription 3
items 3
so 3
you 3
can 3
rush 3
into 3
any 3
drug 3
store 3
and 3
pick 3
up 3
a 3
dispenser 3
when 3
the 3
spirit 3
moves 3
you 3
follow 3
the 3
directions 3
carefully 3
unfortunately 3
these 3
foams 3
taste 3
terrible 3
and 3
are 3
not 3
available 3
in 3
flavors 3
it 3
just 3
shows 3
you 3
how 3
far 3
science 3
has 3
to 3
go 3
another 3
device 3
is 3
the 3
prophylactic 3
or 3
rubber 3
as 3
it 3
is 3
called 3
this 3
is 3
the 3
only 3
device 3
available 3
to 3
men 3
it 3
is 3
a 3
thin 3
rubber 3
sheath 3
that 3
fits 3
over 3
the 3
penis 3
because 3
they 3
are 3
subject 3
to 3
breaking 3
and 3
sliding 3
off 3
their 3
effectiveness 3
is 3
not 3
super 3
great 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
forced 3
to 3
use 3
them 3
the 3
best 3
available 3
are 3
lubricated 3
sheepskins 3
with 3
a 3
reservoir 3
tip 3
the 3
rhythm 3
method 3
or 3
vatican 3
roulette 3
as 3
it 3
is 3
called 3
by 3
hip 3
catholics 3
is 3
a 3
waste 3
unless 3
you 3
are 3
ready 3
to 3
surround 3
yourself 3
with 3
thermometers 3
graphs 3
and 3
charts 3
you 3
also 3
have 3
to 3
limit 3
your 3
fucking 3
to 3
prescribed 3
days 3
even 3
with 3
all 3
these 3
precautions 3
women 3
have 3
often 3
gotten 3
pregnant 3
using 3
the 3
rhythm 3
method 3
the 3
oldest 3
and 3
least 3
effective 3
method 3
is 3
simply 3
for 3
the 3
male 3
to 3
pull 3
out 3
just 3
before 3
he 3
comes 3
there 3
are 3
billions 3
of 3
sperm 3
cells 3
in 3
each 3
ejaculation 3
and 3
only 3
one 3
is 3
needed 3
to 3
fertilize 3
the 3
womans 3
egg 3
and 3
cause 3
a 3
pregnancy 3
most 3
of 3
the 3
sperm 3
is 3
in 3
the 3
first 3
squirt 3
so 3
you 3
had 3
better 3
be 3
quick 3
if 3
you 3
employ 3
this 3
technique 3
if 3
the 3
woman 3
misses 3
her 3
period 3
she 3
shouldnt 3
panic 3
it 3
might 3
be 3
delayed 3
because 3
of 3
emotional 3
reasons 3
just 3
wait 3
two 3
weeks 3
before 3
going 3
to 3
a 3
doctor 3
or 3
clinic 3
for 3
a 3
pregnancy 3
test 3
when 3
you 3
go 3
be 3
sure 3
to 3
bring 3
your 3
first 3
morning 3
urine 3
specimen 3
abortions 3
the 3
best 3
way 3
to 3
find 3
out 3
about 3
abortions 3
is 3
to 3
contact 3
your 3
local 3
womans 3
liberation 3
organization 3
through 3
your 3
underground 3
newspaper 3
or 3
radio 3
station 3
some 3
family 3
planning 3
clinics 3
and 3
even 3
some 3
liberal 3
churches 3
set 3
up 3
abortions 3
but 3
these 3
might 3
run 3
as 3
high 3
as 3
underground 3
newspapers 3
often 3
have 3
ads 3
that 3
read 3
any 3
girl 3
in 3
trouble 3
call 3
or 3
something 3
similar 3
the 3
usual 3
rate 3
for 3
an 3
abortion 3
is 3
about 3
and 3
its 3
awful 3
hard 3
to 3
bargain 3
when 3
you 3
need 3
one 3
badly 3
only 3
go 3
to 3
a 3
physician 3
who 3
is 3
practicing 3
or 3
might 3
have 3
just 3
lost 3
his 3
license 3
forget 3
the 3
stereotype 3
image 3
of 3
these 3
doctors 3
as 3
they 3
are 3
performing 3
a 3
vital 3
service 3
friends 3
who 3
have 3
had 3
an 3
abortion 3
can 3
usually 3
recommend 3
a 3
good 3
doctor 3
and 3
fill 3
you 3
in 3
on 3
whats 3
going 3
to 3
happen 3
abortions 3
are 3
very 3
minor 3
operations 3
if 3
done 3
correctly 3
they 3
can 3
be 3
done 3
almost 3
any 3
time 3
but 3
after 3
three 3
months 3
its 3
no 3
longer 3
so 3
casual 3
and 3
more 3
surgical 3
skill 3
is 3
required 3
start 3
making 3
plans 3
as 3
soon 3
as 3
you 3
find 3
out 3
the 3
sooner 3
the 3
better 3
in 3
terms 3
of 3
the 3
operation 3
get 3
a 3

test 3

clinic 3
if 3
it 3
is 3
positive 3
and 3
you 3
want 3
an 3
abortion 3
start 3
that 3
day 3

plans 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
negative 3
results 3
from 3
the 3
test 3
and 3
still 3
miss 3

a 3
gynecologist 3
perform 3
an 3
examination 3

safer 3

quicker 3

are 3
two 3
diseases 3
that 3
they 3
are 3
easy 3
to 3
pick 3
up 3
they 3
come 3
from 3
balling 3
anyone 3
who 3
claims 3
they 3
got 3
it 3
from 3
sitting 3

a 3

are 3
subject 3
to 3
the 3

prophylactic 3
usually 3
will 3
prevent 3
the 3
spreading 3
of 3
venereal 3
disease 3
but 3
you 3
should 3
really 3
seek 3
to 3
have 3
it 3
cured 3
syphilis 3
usually 3
begins 3
with 3
an 3
infection 3
which 3
may 3
look 3
like 3
a 3
cold 3
sore 3
or 3
pimple 3
around 3
the 3
sex 3
organ 3
there 3
is 3
no 3
pain 3
associated 3
with 3
the 3
lesions 3
soon 3
the 3
sore 3
disappears 3
even 3
without 3
treatment 3
this 3
is 3
often 3
followed 3
by 3
a 3
period 3
of 3
rashes 3
on 3
the 3
body 3
especially 3
the 3
palms 3
of 3
the 3
hands 3
and 3
inflammation 3
of 3
the 3
mouth 3
and 3
throat 3
these 3
symptoms 3
also 3
disappear 3
without 3
treatment 3
it 3
must 3
be 3
understood 3
however 3
that 3
even 3
if 3
these 3
symptoms 3
disappear 3
the 3
disease 3
still 3
remains 3
if 3
left 3
untreated 3
it 3
can 3
cause 3
serious 3
trouble 3
such 3
as 3
heart 3
disease 3
blindness 3
insanity 3
and 3

might 3
produce 3

is 3
easily 3

anyone 3
you 3
ball 3
gonorrhea 3
clap 3
is 3
more 3
common 3
than 3
syphilis 3
its 3
first 3
signs 3
are 3
a 3
discharge 3
from 3
your 3
sex 3
organ 3
that 3
is 3
painful 3
like 3
syphilis 3
it 3
affects 3
both 3
men 3
and 3
women 3
but 3
is 3
often 3
unnoticed 3
in 3
women 3
there 3
is 3
usually 3
itching 3
and 3
burning 3
associated 3
with 3
the 3

be 3
considerable 3
on 3
a 3
long 3

during 3

hours 3
if 3

the 3
next 3

a 3
five 3
or 3
ten 3
dollar 3

saying 3
youve 3
had 3
an 3
accident 3
and 3
are 3
pressed 3
for 3
funds 3
because 3
of 3
large 3
medical 3

but 3
youll 3
send 3

as 3
soon 3
as 3
you 3
are 3
up 3
and 3
around 3
again 3
that 3
will 3
hold 3
them 3
for 3
another 3
month 3
in 3
all 3
you 3
can 3
stretch 3
it 3
out 3
for 3
four 3
or 3
five 3
months 3
with 3
a 3
variety 3
of 3
excuses 3
and 3
small 3
payments 3
this 3
also 3
works 3
with 3
the 3
gas 3

even 3
more 3

hip 3
the 3
image 3
you 3

that 3
of 3
a 3
warm 3
sensitive 3
kid 3

will 3
probably 3
be 3
true 3
after 3

such 3
when 3

he 3
pulled 3
out 3

large 3
amount 3

if 3
you 3

can 3
perforate 3
your 3

super 3
moderate 3
too 3
much 3

you 3
a 3
little 3
bit 3
goes 3
a 3
long 3
way 3
selling 3
dealing 3
although 3
dangerous 3
is 3
a 3
taxfree 3
way 3
of 3
surviving 3
even 3
though 3
it 3
borders 3
on 3
work 3
the 3
best 3
way 3
to 3
start 3
is 3
to 3
save 3
up 3
a 3
little 3
bread 3
and 3
buy 3
a 3
larger 3
quantity 3
than 3
you 3
usually 3
get 3
then 3
deal 3
out 3
smaller 3
amounts 3
to 3
your 3
friends 3
the 3
fewer 3
strangers 3
you 3
deal 3
with 3
the 3
safer 3
you 3
are 3
the 3
price 3

in 3
your 3
area 3
the 3
heat 3
the 3

are 3
bringing 3
down 3

the 3
connections 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
rough 3
scale 3
say 3
for 3
pot 3
is 3
an 3
ounce 3
a 3
pound 3
and 3
a 3
kilo 3
pounds 3
the 3
price 3
per 3
ounce 3
decreases 3
depending 3
on 3
the 3
amount 3
you 3
get 3
its 3
true 3
you 3
make 3
more 3
profit 3
selling 3
by 3
the 3
ounces 3
but 3
the 3
hassle 3
is 3
greater 3
and 3
the 3
more 3
contacts 3
you 3
must 3
make 3
increases 3
the 3
risk 3
screwing 3
your 3
customers 3
will 3
prove 3
to 3
be 3
bad 3
karma 3
unless 3

stick 3

honest 3
dealing 3
never 3
deal 3
from 3
your 3

out 3
the 3

grass 3
too 3
you 3
can 3
ship 3

we 3
see 3
nuns 3

just 3
on 3
their 3
way 3
to 3
the 3
next 3

dont 3
keep 3
extensive 3

officer 3
and 3
the 3
other 3
can 3
be 3
a 3
court 3
witness 3
dealing 3
is 3
a 3
paradox 3
of 3
unloading 3
a 3
good 3

not 3
trying 3

try 3
your 3
potluck 3
the 3
first 3
thing 3
is 3
to 3
start 3
with 3
a 3
bunch 3
of 3
goodquality 3
seeds 3
from 3
grass 3
that 3
you 3
really 3
dig 3
select 3
the 3
largest 3
seeds 3
and 3
place 3
them 3
between 3
two 3
heavyduty 3
napkins 3
or 3
ink 3
blotters 3
in 3
a 3

water 3
until 3
completely 3
saturated 3
cover 3
the 3
top 3
of 3
the 3
pan 3
or 3
place 3
it 3
in 3
a 3
dark 3
closet 3
for 3
three 3
days 3
or 3
until 3
a 3
sprout 3
about 3
a 3
half 3
inch 3
long 3
appears 3
from 3
most 3
of 3
the 3
seeds 3
during 3
this 3
incubation 3
period 3
you 3
can 3
prepare 3
the 3
seedling 3
bed 3
use 3
a 3
low 3
wooden 3
box 3
such 3
as 3
a 3
tomato 3
flat 3
and 3
fill 3
it 3
with 3
an 3
inch 3
of 3
gravel 3
fill 3
the 3
rest 3
of 3
the 3
box 3
with 3
some 3
soil 3
mixed 3
with 3
a 3
small 3
amount 3
of 3
fertilizer 3
moisten 3
the 3
soil 3
until 3
water 3
seeps 3
out 3
the 3
bottom 3
of 3
the 3
box 3
then 3
level 3
the 3
soil 3
making 3
a 3
flat 3
surface 3
with 3
a 3
pencil 3
punch 3
holes 3
two 3
inches 3
apart 3
in 3
straight 3
rows 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
about 3
dozen 3
in 3
a 3
tomato 3
flat 3
when 3
the 3
incubation 3
period 3
is 3
over 3
take 3
those 3
seeds 3
that 3
have 3
an 3
adequate 3
sprout 3
and 3
plant 3
one 3
in 3
each 3
hole 3
the 3
sprout 3
goes 3
down 3
and 3
the 3
seed 3
part 3
should 3
be 3
a 3
little 3
above 3
ground 3
tamp 3
the 3
soil 3
firmly 3
do 3
not 3
pack 3
around 3
each 3
plant 3
as 3
you 3
insert 3
the 3
sprouts 3
the 3
seedlings 3
should 3
remain 3
in 3
their 3
boxes 3
in 3
a 3
sunny 3
window 3
until 3
about 3
midmay 3
they 3
should 3
receive 3
enough 3
water 3
during 3
this 3
period 3
to 3
keep 3
the 3
soil 3
moist 3
by 3
the 3
time 3
they 3
are 3
ready 3
to 3
go 3
into 3
the 3
ground 3
the 3
green 3
plants 3
should 3
be 3
about 3
six 3
to 3
eight 3
inches 3
tall 3
if 3
it 3
is 3
late 3
winter 3
or 3
early 3
spring 3
and 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
plot 3
of 3
land 3
that 3
gets 3
enough 3
sun 3
and 3
is 3
sheltered 3
from 3
nosy 3
neighbors 3
you 3
should 3
definitely 3
grow 3
grass 3
in 3
the 3
great 3
outdoors 3
one 3
idea 3
is 3
to 3
plant 3
sunflowers 3
in 3
your 3
garden 3
as 3
these 3
grow 3
taller 3
than 3
the 3
pot 3
plants 3
and 3
camouflage 3
them 3
from 3
view 3
the 3
best 3
idea 3
is 3
to 3
find 3
some 3
littleused 3
field 3
and 3
plant 3
a 3
section 3
of 3
it 3
prepare 3
the 3
land 3
the 3
way 3
you 3
would 3
for 3
any 3
garden 3
vegetable 3
dig 3
up 3
the 3
ground 3
with 3
a 3
pitchfork 3
or 3
heavy 3
duty 3
rake 3
removing 3
rocks 3
rake 3
the 3
plot 3
level 3
and 3
punch 3
holes 3
in 3
the 3
soil 3
about 3
three 3
inches 3
deep 3
and 3
about 3
two 3
feet 3
apart 3
in 3
the 3
same 3
way 3
you 3
did 3
in 3
the 3
seedling 3
boxes 3
remove 3
the 3
young 3
plants 3
from 3
the 3
box 3
being 3
careful 3
not 3
to 3
disturb 3
the 3
roots 3
and 3
keeping 3
as 3
much 3
soil 3
intact 3
as 3
possible 3
transplant 3
each 3
plant 3
into 3
one 3
of 3
the 3
punchedout 3
holes 3
and 3
firmly 3
press 3
the 3
soil 3
to 3
hold 3
it 3
in 3
place 3
when 3
all 3
the 3
plants 3
are 3
in 3
the 3
ground 3
water 3
the 3
entire 3
area 3
tend 3
them 3
the 3
way 3
you 3
would 3
any 3
other 3
garden 3
they 3
should 3
reach 3
a 3
height 3
of 3
about 3
six 3
feet 3
by 3
the 3
end 3
of 3
the 3
summer 3
and 3
be 3
ready 3
to 3
harvest 3
if 3
you 3
dont 3
have 3
access 3
to 3
a 3
field 3
you 3
can 3
grow 3
good 3
stuff 3
right 3
in 3
your 3
own 3
closet 3
or 3
garage 3
using 3
artificial 3
lighting 3
transplant 3
the 3
plants 3
into 3
larger 3
wooden 3
boxes 3
or 3
flower 3
boxes 3
be 3
sure 3
and 3
cover 3
the 3
bottom 3
of 3
each 3
box 3
with 3
a 3
few 3
inches 3
of 3
pebbles 3
or 3
broken 3
pottery 3
before 3
you 3
add 3
the 3
soil 3
this 3
will 3
insure 3
proper 3
drainage 3
fertilize 3
the 3
soil 3
according 3
to 3
the 3
instructions 3
on 3
the 3
box 3
and 3
punch 3
out 3
holes 3
in 3
much 3
the 3
same 3
way 3
you 3
would 3
do 3
if 3
you 3
were 3
growing 3
outside 3
after 3
the 3
young 3
plants 3
have 3
been 3
transplanted 3
and 3
watered 3
thoroughly 3
you 3
will 3
have 3
to 3
rig 3
up 3
a 3
lighting 3
system 3
use 3
blue 3
light 3
bulbs 3
which 3
are 3
available 3
at 3
hardware 3
stores 3
for 3
the 3
first 3
thirty 3
days 3
these 3
insure 3
a 3
shorter 3
sturdier 3
stalk 3
leave 3
the 3
lights 3
on 3
hours 3
a 3
day 3
and 3
place 3
them 3
about 3
a 3
foot 3
above 3
the 3
tops 3
of 3
the 3
plants 3
if 3
the 3
plants 3
begin 3
to 3
feel 3
brittle 3
or 3
turn 3
yellow 3
at 3
the 3
edges 3
then 3
the 3
temperature 3
is 3
too 3
hot 3
use 3
less 3
illumination 3
or 3
raise 3
the 3
height 3
of 3
the 3
lamp 3
if 3
this 3
occurs 3
after 3
the 3
first 3
thirty 3
days 3
change 3
to 3
red 3
bulbs 3
and 3
cut 3
down 3
the 3
lighting 3
time 3
to 3
hours 3
a 3
day 3
after 3
a 3
week 3
reduce 3
the 3
time 3
to 3
hours 3
and 3
then 3
on 3
the 3
third 3
week 3
to 3
hours 3
maintain 3
this 3
lighting 3
period 3
until 3
the 3
plants 3
flower 3
the 3
female 3
plants 3
have 3
a 3
larger 3
and 3
heavier 3
flower 3
structure 3
and 3
the 3
males 3
are 3
somewhat 3
skimpy 3
the 3
female 3
plant 3
produces 3
the 3
stronger 3
grass 3
and 3
the 3
choicest 3
parts 3
are 3
the 3
top 3
leaves 3
including 3
the 3
flowers 3
inside 3
or 3
outside 3
the 3
plants 3
will 3
be 3
best 3
if 3
allowed 3
to 3
reach 3
maturity 3
although 3
they 3
are 3
smokeable 3
at 3
any 3
point 3
along 3
the 3
way 3
when 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
harvest 3
the 3
crop 3
wet 3
the 3
soil 3
and 3
pull 3
out 3
the 3
entire 3
plant 3
if 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
separate 3
the 3
top 3
leaves 3
from 3
the 3
rest 3
you 3
can 3
do 3
so 3
and 3
make 3
two 3
qualities 3
of 3
grass 3
in 3
any 3
event 3
let 3
the 3
plants 3
dry 3
in 3
the 3
sun 3
for 3
two 3
weeks 3
until 3
they 3
are 3
thoroughly 3
dried 3
out 3
if 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
hurry 3
the 3
drying 3
process 3
you 3
can 3
do 3
it 3
in 3
an 3
oven 3
using 3
a 3
very 3
low 3
heat 3
for 3
about 3
twenty 3
minutes 3
after 3
youve 3
completed 3
the 3
drying 3
you 3
can 3
cure 3
the 3
grass 3
by 3
putting 3
the 3
plants 3
in 3
plastic 3
bags 3
and 3
sprinkling 3
drops 3
of 3
wine 3
rum 3
or 3
plain 3
booze 3
on 3
them 3
this 3
greatly 3
increases 3
the 3
potency 3
there 3
are 3
two 3
other 3
ways 3
that 3
we 3
know 3
work 3
to 3
increase 3
the 3
potency 3
of 3
grass 3
you 3
grow 3
or 3
buy 3
one 3
consists 3
of 3
digging 3
a 3
hole 3
and 3
burying 3
a 3
stash 3
of 3
grass 3
wrapped 3
in 3
a 3
plastic 3
bag 3
a 3
few 3
months 3
in 3
the 3
ground 3
will 3
produce 3
a 3
mouldy 3
grass 3
that 3
is 3
far 3
fuckin 3
out 3
a 3
quick 3
method 3
is 3
to 3

checks 3
and 3
keep 3
the 3
ones 3
you 3

as 3
security 3
this 3
security 3
is 3
great 3
for 3
international 3
travel 3
especially 3
at 3
border 3
crossings 3
if 3
you 3

you 3
can 3
spend 3
the 3
travelers 3
checks 3
by 3
giving 3
them 3
to 3
a 3
friend 3
to 3
forge 3
your 3

the 3

if 3
you 3
have 3
reported 3
the 3
lost 3
checks 3
to 3
the 3
police 3
so 3
you 3
can 3
safely 3
answer 3
yes 3
never 3
do 3
this 3
for 3
more 3
than 3
five 3
hundred 3

worth 3

that 3

what 3
you 3

house 3
chips 3
that 3
you 3
can 3
cash 3

for 3
real 3
dough 3
theoretically 3
your 3
two 3

you 3
do 3
the 3
betting 3

if 3
you 3
bet 3
even 3
chances 3
at 3
roulette 3
that 3
is 3
because 3
the 3
house 3
wins 3

comes 3
up 3
in 3

a 3

probably 3

three 3

if 3
your 3

you 3
probably 3
dont 3
have 3
a 3
scene 3
together 3
a 3
firmly 3
established 3
paper 3
can 3
be 3
started 3
on 3
about 3
plan 3
to 3
begin 3
with 3
eight 3
pages 3
in 3
black 3
and 3
white 3
with 3
a 3
copy 3
run 3
each 3
such 3
issue 3
will 3
cost 3
about 3
to 3
print 3
you 3
should 3
have 3
six 3
issues 3
covered 3
when 3
you 3
start 3
another 3
will 3
do 3
for 3
equipment 3
offset 3
printing 3
is 3
what 3
youll 3
want 3
to 3
get 3
from 3
a 3
commercial 3
printing 3
establishment 3
you 3
need 3
some 3
space 3
to 3
start 3
but 3
dont 3
rush 3
into 3
setting 3
up 3
a 3
storefront 3
office 3
until 3
you 3
feel 3
the 3
papers 3
going 3
to 3
be 3
successful 3
a 3
garage 3
barn 3
or 3
spare 3
apartment 3
room 3
will 3
do 3
just 3
fine 3
good 3
overhead 3
fluorescent 3
lighting 3
a 3
few 3
long 3
tables 3
a 3
bookcase 3
desk 3
chairs 3
possibly 3
a 3
phone 3
and 3
you 3
are 3
ready 3
to 3
start 3
any 3
typewriter 3
will 3
work 3
but 3
you 3
can 3
rent 3
an 3
ibm 3
selectric 3
typewriter 3
with 3
a 3
deposit 3
of 3
and 3
payments 3
of 3
per 3
month 3
leasing 3
costs 3
twice 3
as 3
much 3
but 3
youll 3
own 3
the 3
machine 3
when 3
the 3
payments 3
are 3
finished 3
the 3
selectric 3
has 3
interchangeable 3
type 3
that 3
works 3
on 3
a 3
ball 3
system 3
rather 3
than 3
the 3
oldfashion 3
keys 3
each 3
ball 3
costs 3
so 3
by 3
getting 3
a 3
few 3
you 3
can 3
vary 3
the 3
type 3
the 3
way 3
a 3
printer 3
does 3
a 3
lighttable 3
can 3
make 3
things 3
a 3
lot 3
easier 3
when 3
it 3
comes 3
to 3
layout 3
simply 3
build 3
a 3
box 3
x 3
is 3
a 3
good 3
size 3
but 3
the 3
larger 3
the 3
better 3
out 3
of 3
plywood 3
the 3
back 3
should 3
be 3
higher 3
than 3
the 3
front 3
to 3
provide 3
a 3
sloping 3
effect 3
the 3
top 3
should 3
consist 3
of 3
a 3
shelf 3
of 3
frosted 3
glass 3
get 3
one 3
strong 3
enough 3
to 3
lean 3
on 3
inside 3
the 3
box 3
attach 3
two 3
fluorescent 3
light 3
fixtures 3
to 3
the 3
walls 3
or 3
base 3
the 3
whole 3
light 3
table 3
should 3
cost 3
less 3
than 3
that 3
really 3
is 3
about 3
all 3
you 3
need 3
except 3
someone 3
with 3
a 3
camera 3
a 3
few 3
good 3
writers 3
who 3
will 3
serve 3
as 3
reporters 3
an 3
artistic 3
person 3
to 3
take 3
care 3
of 3
layout 3
and 3
someone 3
to 3
hassle 3
printing 3
deals 3

distribution 3
most 3

everything 3
layout 3
a 3
tabloid 3

an 3

columns 3
typically 3
are 3
allowing 3

three 3

experience 3
has 3
found 3
that 3
this 3
size 3
is 3
easy 3
to 3
lay 3
out 3
and 3
more 3
importantly 3
easy 3
to 3
read 3
there 3
is 3
an 3
indirect 3
ratio 3

academic 3
snobbishness 3
avoid 3
the 3

the 3

now 3
is 3
a 3

that 3
are 3
caught 3

it 3
gets 3
really 3
heavy 3

still 3

the 3

be 3
a 3

more 3
frustrating 3

the 3

on 3

there 3
are 3
three 3
steps 3
to 3
be 3
taken 3
in 3
order 3
to 3
establish 3
a 3
peoples 3
tv 3
network 3
first 3
you 3
must 3
convert 3
the 3
video 3
and 3
audio 3
signals 3
to 3
an 3
rf 3
frequency 3
modulated 3
fm 3
signal 3
corresponding 3
to 3
the 3
desired 3
broadcast 3
channel 3
we 3
suggest 3
for 3
political 3
and 3
technical 3
reasons 3
that 3
you 3
pick 3
one 3
of 3
the 3
unused 3
channels 3
in 3
your 3
area 3
to 3
begin 3
experimenting 3
the 3
commercial 3
stations 3
have 3
an 3
extremely 3
powerful 3
signal 3
and 3
can 3
usually 3
override 3
your 3
small 3
output 3
given 3
time 3
and 3
experience 3
you 3
might 3
want 3
to 3
go 3
into 3
direct 3
competition 3
with 3
the 3
big 3
boys 3
on 3
their 3
own 3
channel 3
it 3
is 3
entirely 3
possible 3
say 3
in 3
a 3
to 3
block 3
radius 3
to 3
interrupt 3
a 3
presidential 3
pressconference 3
with 3
more 3
important 3
news 3
electronic 3
companies 3
such 3
as 3
jerrold 3
electronics 3
corp 3
th 3
and 3
walnut 3
sts 3
philadelphia 3
pa 3
make 3
equipment 3
that 3
can 3
rf 3
both 3
video 3
and 3
audio 3
information 3
onto 3
specific 3
channels 3
the 3
device 3
youd 3
be 3
interested 3
in 3
is 3
called 3
a 3
cable 3
driver 3
or 3
rf 3
modulator 3
when 3
the 3
signal 3
is 3
in 3
the 3
rf 3
state 3
it 3
is 3
already 3
possible 3
to 3
broadcast 3
very 3
short 3
distances 3
the 3
second 3
step 3
is 3
to 3
amplify 3
the 3
signal 3
so 3
it 3
will 3
reach 3
as 3
far 3
as 3
possible 3
a 3
linear 3
amplifier 3
of 3
the 3
proper 3
frequency 3
is 3
required 3
for 3
this 3
job 3
the 3
stronger 3
the 3
amplifier 3
the 3
farther 3
and 3
more 3
powerful 3
the 3
signal 3
a 3
watt 3
job 3
will 3
cover 3
approximately 3
miles 3
line 3
of 3
sight 3
in 3
area 3
linear 3
amplifiers 3
are 3
not 3
that 3
easily 3
available 3
but 3
they 3
can 3
be 3
constructed 3
with 3
some 3
electrical 3
engineering 3
knowledge 3
the 3
third 3
step 3
is 3
the 3
antenna 3
which 3
if 3
the 3
whole 3
system 3
is 3
to 3
be 3
mobile 3
to 3
avoid 3
detection 3
is 3
going 3
to 3
involve 3
some 3
experimentation 3
and 3
possible 3
camouflage 3
two 3
things 3
to 3
keep 3
in 3
mind 3
about 3
an 3
antenna 3
are 3
that 3
it 3
should 3
be 3
what 3
is 3
technically 3
referred 3
to 3
as 3
a 3
dipole 3
antenna 3
see 3
diagram 3
and 3
since 3
tv 3
signals 3
travel 3
on 3
line 3
of 3
sight 3
it 3
is 3
important 3
to 3
place 3
the 3
antenna 3
as 3
high 3
as 3
possible 3
although 3
it 3
hasnt 3
been 3
done 3
in 3
practice 3
it 3
certainly 3
is 3
possible 3
to 3
reflect 3

video 3
and 3
audio 3
existing 3
antenna 3
of 3
a 3
commercial 3

this 3
requires 3
a 3
full 3
knowledge 3
of 3
broadcasting 3
however 3
any 3
amateur 3
can 3
rig 3
up 3
an 3
antenna 3
attach 3
it 3
to 3
a 3
helium 3
balloon 3
and 3
get 3
it 3
plenty 3
high 3
for 3
most 3
the 3
roof 3
of 3
a 3
tall 3
building 3
will 3
suffice 3
if 3
youre 3
really 3
uptight 3
about 3
your 3
operation 3
the 3
antenna 3
can 3

is 3
the 3
theater 3
those 3
who 3
say 3
a 3
demonstration 3
should 3
be 3
concerned 3
with 3
education 3
rather 3
than 3
theater 3
dont 3
understand 3
either 3
and 3
will 3
never 3
organize 3
a 3
successful 3
demonstration 3
or 3
for 3
that 3
matter 3
a 3
successful 3
revolution 3
publicity 3
includes 3
everything 3
from 3
buttons 3
and 3
leaflets 3
to 3
press 3
conferences 3
you 3
should 3
be 3
in 3
touch 3
with 3
the 3
best 3
artists 3
you 3
can 3
locate 3
to 3
design 3
the 3
visual 3
props 3
posters 3
can 3
be 3
silk 3
screened 3
very 3
cheaply 3
and 3
people 3
can 3
be 3
taught 3
to 3
do 3
it 3
in 3
a 3
very 3
short 3
time 3
buttons 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
purchased 3
the 3
cheapest 3
are 3
those 3
printed 3
directly 3
on 3
the 3
metal 3
the 3
paint 3
rubs 3
off 3
after 3
a 3
while 3
but 3
they 3
are 3
ideal 3
for 3
mass 3
demonstrations 3
you 3
can 3
print 3
for 3
about 3
leaflets 3
like 3
posters 3
should 3
be 3
well 3
designed 3
one 3
way 3
of 3
getting 3
publicity 3
is 3
to 3
negotiate 3
with 3
the 3
city 3
for 3
permits 3
again 3
this 3
raises 3
political 3
questions 3
but 3
there 3
is 3
not 3
doubt 3
one 3
reason 3
for 3
engaging 3
in 3
permit 3
discussions 3
is 3
for 3
added 3
publicity 3
the 3
date 3
time 3
and 3
place 3
of 3
the 3
demonstration 3
all 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
chosen 3
with 3
skill 3
know 3
the 3
projected 3
weather 3
reports 3
pick 3
a 3
time 3
and 3
day 3
of 3
the 3
week 3
that 3
are 3
convenient 3
to 3
most 3
people 3
make 3
sure 3
the 3
place 3
itself 3
adds 3
some 3
meaning 3
to 3
the 3
message 3
dont 3
have 3
a 3
demonstration 3
just 3
because 3
thats 3
the 3
way 3
its 3
always 3
been 3
done 3
it 3
is 3
only 3
one 3
type 3
of 3
weapon 3
and 3
should 3
be 3
used 3
as 3
such 3
on 3
the 3
other 3
hand 3
dont 3
dismiss 3
demonstrations 3
because 3
they 3
have 3
always 3
turned 3
out 3
boring 3
you 3
and 3
your 3
group 3
can 3
plan 3
a 3
demonstration 3
within 3
the 3
demonstration 3
more 3
accurately 3
also 3
dont 3
tend 3
to 3
dismiss 3
demonstrations 3
outright 3
because 3
the 3
repression 3
is 3
too 3
great 3
during 3
world 3
war 3
ii 3
the 3
danes 3
held 3
street 3
demonstrations 3
against 3
the 3
nazis 3
who 3
occupied 3
their 3
country 3
even 3
today 3
there 3
are 3
public 3
demonstrations 3
against 3
the 3
vietnam 3
war 3
in 3
downtown 3
saigon 3
repression 3
is 3
there 3
but 3
overestimating 3
it 3
is 3
more 3
a 3
tactical 3
blunder 3
than 3
the 3
reverse 3
none 3
the 3
less 3
its 3
wise 3
to 3
go 3
to 3
all 3
demonstrations 3
prepared 3
for 3
a 3
vamping 3
by 3
the 3

vamping 3
is 3
accompanied 3
by 3
clubbing 3
rough 3

occasional 3

the 3
most 3

pepper 3
gas 3

a 3

you 3
are 3

along 3
the 3
ground 3
gloves 3

to 3
pick 3
up 3

throw 3
them 3

wearing 3
this 3
clumsy 3

youll 3
be 3
better 3
off 3
without 3
it 3
helmets 3
everyone 3
should 3
have 3
a 3
helmet 3
your 3
head 3
sticks 3
out 3
above 3
the 3
swarming 3
crowd 3
and 3
dents 3
like 3
a 3
tin 3
can 3
protect 3
it 3
the 3
type 3
of 3
helmet 3
you 3
get 3
depends 3
on 3
what 3
you 3
can 3
afford 3
and 3
how 3
often 3
youll 3
be 3
using 3
it 3
the 3
cheapest 3
helmet 3
available 3
is 3
a 3
heavy 3
steel 3
tank 3
model 3
this 3
one 3
is 3
good 3
because 3
it 3
offers 3
ear 3
protection 3
and 3
has 3
a 3
builtin 3
suspension 3
system 3
to 3
absorb 3
the 3
blow 3
it 3
is 3
also 3
bullet 3
proof 3
its 3
disadvantages 3
are 3
that 3
it 3
only 3
comes 3
in 3
large 3
sizes 3
and 3
is 3
the 3
heaviest 3
thing 3
youll 3
ever 3
have 3
on 3
your 3
head 3
it 3
costs 3
about 3
for 3
you 3
can 3
get 3
a 3
civil 3
defense 3
helmet 3
made 3
for 3
officers 3
its 3
much 3
lighter 3
but 3
doesnt 3
offer 3
protection 3
for 3
the 3
ears 3
it 3
has 3
a 3
good 3
suspension 3
system 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
this 3
model 3
paint 3
it 3
a 3
dark 3
color 3
before 3
using 3
it 3
and 3
youll 3
be 3
less 3
conspicuous 3
our 3
fashion 3
consultants 3
suggest 3
anarchy 3
black 3
construction 3
helmets 3
or 3
hard 3
hats 3
run 3
between 3
and 3
depending 3
on 3
the 3
type 3
of 3
suspension 3
system 3
and 3
material 3
used 3
they 3
are 3
good 3
for 3
women 3
because 3
they 3
are 3
extremely 3
lightweight 3
the 3
aluminum 3
ones 3
dent 3
if 3
struck 3
repeatedly 3
and 3
the 3
fiberglass 3
type 3
can 3
crack 3
also 3
they 3
offer 3
no 3
ear 3
protection 3
if 3
you 3
prefer 3
one 3
of 3
these 3
you 3
should 3
find 3
a 3
way 3
to 3
attach 3
a 3
chin 3
or 3
neck 3
strap 3
so 3
you 3
wont 3
lose 3
it 3
while 3
you 3
run 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
a 3
hard 3
hat 3
make 3
sure 3
you 3
remove 3
the 3
hard 3
head 3
before 3
you 3
take 3
it 3
home 3
probably 3

vary 3
in 3
quality 3

on 3
age 3
and 3
condition 3
they 3
run 3
from 3

sure 3
the 3

a 3

with 3

that 3
fits 3
well 3
or 3
is 3
adjustable 3
and 3
has 3
a 3
chin 3

their 3
main 3
disadvantage 3
is 3
that 3
they 3
are 3
bulky 3

heavy 3
the 3
snappiest 3
demonstrators 3
use 3
the 3
familiar 3

are 3
the 3
highest 3
in 3

they 3
can 3
be 3
gotten 3
to 3

quite 3
snugly 3
around 3
the 3
head 3
they 3
offer 3
excellent 3
ear 3
protection 3
the 3
foam 3

is 3
better 3
than 3
a 3

certainly 3
cushion 3
most 3
blows 3

a 3
few 3
have 3
been 3
known 3
to 3

that 3
is 3
extremely 3

a 3
little 3
added 3
protection 3
get 3
only 3
those 3

one 3
way 3

keep 3
in 3

is 3
to 3

communicate 3
with 3
these 3

the 3
only 3
disadvantage 3
is 3
cost 3
a 3
half 3
decent 3
unit 3
costs 3

it 3
should 3
have 3
a 3
minimum 3
of 3
transistors 3

although 3
walkietalkies 3
can 3

not 3

about 3

you 3
ever 3
deck 3

pig 3
steal 3
his 3
walkietalkie 3
even 3
before 3
you 3
take 3
his 3
gun 3
a 3
good 3
rule 3
is 3
to 3
avoid 3
the 3
bargain 3
gypjoints 3
and 3
go 3
to 3
a 3
place 3
that 3
deals 3
in 3
electronic 3
equipment 3
the 3
important 3
thing 3
to 3
realize 3
about 3
all 3
walkietalkie 3
networks 3
is 3
that 3
if 3
anyone 3
can 3
talk 3
anyone 3
else 3
can 3
listen 3
and 3
vice 3
versa 3
this 3
applies 3
to 3
pigs 3
as 3
well 3
as 3
us 3
all 3
walkietalkies 3
work 3
on 3
the 3
civilian 3
band 3
which 3
has 3
channels 3
the 3
cheaper 3
units 3
are 3
preset 3
to 3
channel 3
or 3
the 3
pigs 3
broadcast 3
on 3
higher 3
channels 3
usually 3

more 3
expensive 3

one 3
of 3
the 3
most 3

bacon 3
its 3
good 3
to 3
know 3
a 3
few 3
handy 3
slicing 3
tips 3
the 3
first 3
thing 3
to 3
learn 3
is 3
the 3
local 3
laws 3
regarding 3
the 3
possession 3
of 3
knives 3
the 3
laws 3
on 3
possession 3
are 3
of 3
the 3
catch 3
vagueness 3
cops 3
can 3
arrest 3
you 3
for 3
having 3
a 3
small 3
pocket 3
knife 3
and 3
claim 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
concealed 3
and 3
deadly 3
weapon 3
in 3
your 3
possession 3
here 3
as 3
in 3
most 3
cases 3
of 3
law 3
its 3
not 3
what 3
you 3
are 3
doing 3
its 3
whos 3
doing 3
the 3
what 3
that 3
counts 3
all 3
areas 3
however 3
usually 3
have 3
a 3
limit 3
on 3
length 3
such 3
as 3
blades 3
under 3
or 3
are 3
legal 3
and 3
anything 3
over 3
that 3
length 3
concealed 3
on 3
a 3
person 3
can 3
be 3
considered 3
illegal 3
asking 3
some 3
hip 3
lawyers 3
can 3
help 3
here 3
unfortunately 3
the 3
best 3
fighting 3
knives 3
are 3
illegal 3
switchblades 3
and 3
stilettos 3
because 3
they 3
can 3
so 3
quickly 3
spring 3
into 3
operation 3
are 3
great 3
weapons 3
that 3
are 3
outlawed 3
in 3
all 3
states 3
if 3
you 3
want 3
to 3
risk 3
the 3
consequences 3
however 3
you 3
can 3
readily 3
purchase 3
these 3
weapons 3
once 3
you 3
learn 3
how 3
to 3
contact 3
the 3
criminal 3
underworld 3
or 3
in 3
most 3
foreign 3
countries 3
if 3
both 3
of 3
these 3
fail 3
go 3
to 3
any 3
pawnshop 3
look 3
in 3
the 3
window 3
and 3
take 3
our 3
choice 3
of 3
lethal 3
illegal 3
knives 3
a 3
flat 3
gravity 3
knife 3
available 3
in 3
most 3
army 3
surplus 3
and 3
pawn 3
shops 3
would 3
be 3
the 3
best 3
type 3
available 3
in 3
regular 3
overthecounter 3
buying 3
its 3
flat 3
style 3
makes 3
for 3
easy 3
concealment 3
and 3
comfort 3
when 3
kept 3
in 3
a 3
pocket 3

it 3
can 3
be 3
greased 3

the 3

it 3
fly 3
open 3
with 3
a 3
flick 3
of 3
the 3
wrist 3
a 3
little 3
practice 3
here 3
will 3
be 3
very 3
useful 3
most 3
inexperienced 3
knife 3
fighters 3
use 3
a 3
blade 3
incorrectly 3
having 3
seen 3
too 3

jim 3

slash 3
their 3
way 3
through 3
walls 3
of 3
human 3

persist 3
in 3
carrying 3
on 3
this 3
inane 3
tradition 3
overhead 3
and 3
uppercut 3
slashes 3
are 3
a 3
waste 3
of 3
energy 3
and 3
blade 3
power 3
the 3
correct 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
hold 3
the 3
knife 3
in 3
a 3
natural 3
firm 3
grip 3
and 3
jab 3
straight 3
ahead 3
at 3
waist 3
level 3
with 3
the 3
arm 3
extending 3
full 3
length 3
each 3
time 3
this 3
fencing 3
style 3
allows 3
for 3
the 3
maximum 3
reach 3
of 3
arm 3
and 3
blade 3
by 3
concentrating 3
the 3
point 3
of 3
the 3
knife 3
directly 3
at 3
the 3
target 3

method 3
in 3
front 3
of 3
a 3
mirror 3
and 3
in 3
a 3
few 3
days 3
youll 3
get 3

clumsy 3
slobbish 3

be 3
lost 3

are 3
a 3
variety 3
of 3

that 3
are 3
easy 3
to 3

this 3
on 3
yourself 3
by 3
grabbing 3
one 3
wrist 3
with 3
your 3

see 3
how 3
difficult 3
it 3
is 3
to 3
hold 3
someone 3
who 3
works 3
against 3
the 3
thumb 3
if 3
he 3
grabs 3
you 3
around 3
the 3

you 3
can 3
grab 3
his 3

another 3
finger 3
and 3
sharply 3
bend 3
it 3
backwards 3
by 3
concentrating 3
all 3
your 3
energy 3
on 3
one 3
little 3
finger 3
you 3
can 3
inflict 3
pain 3
and 3
cause 3
the 3

to 3
be 3
broken 3
there 3
are 3
a 3
variety 3
of 3
points 3
on 3
the 3
body 3
where 3
a 3
firm 3
amount 3

skillfully 3
directed 3
will 3
induce 3
severe 3
pain 3
a 3
grip 3
for 3
example 3
can 3
be 3
broken 3
by 3
jabbing 3
your 3

directly 3
under 3
your 3

in 3
back 3

also 3
a 3
very 3

spot 3
right 3
behind 3
the 3
ear 3

stick 3
your 3

there 3
and 3
see 3
get 3
the 3
point 3
in 3
addition 3
to 3
pressure 3
points 3
there 3
are 3
places 3
in 3
the 3
body 3
where 3
a 3
sharp 3
welldirected 3
whack 3
with 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
a 3
rigidly 3
held 3
palm 3
can 3
easily 3
disable 3
a 3
person 3
performed 3
by 3
an 3
expert 3
such 3
a 3
blow 3
can 3
even 3
be 3
lethal 3
try 3
making 3
such 3
a 3
rigid 3
palm 3
and 3
practice 3
these 3
judo 3
chops 3
the 3
fist 3
is 3
a 3
ridiculous 3
weapon 3
to 3
use 3
its 3
fleshy 3
the 3
blow 3
is 3
distributed 3
over 3
too 3
wide 3
an 3
area 3
to 3
have 3
any 3
real 3
effect 3
and 3
the 3
knuckles 3
break 3
easily 3
you 3
will 3
have 3
to 3
train 3
yourself 3
to 3
use 3
judo 3
chops 3
instinctively 3
but 3
it 3
will 3
prove 3
quite 3
worthwhile 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
ever 3
in 3
trouble 3
a 3
good 3
place 3
to 3
aim 3
for 3
is 3
directly 3
in 3
the 3
center 3
of 3
the 3
chest 3
cavity 3
at 3
its 3
lowest 3
point 3

a 3
straight 3
line 3
up 3
about 3
six 3
inches 3
starting 3
from 3
your 3
belly 3
button 3
and 3
you 3
can 3
feel 3
the 3
point 3
the 3
adams 3
apple 3
in 3
the 3
center 3
of 3
the 3

of 3
the 3
neck 3
at 3
the 3
top 3
of 3
the 3
spinal 3
column 3
are 3
also 3
extremely 3
vulnerable 3
spots 3
with 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
your 3
palm 3
press 3
firmly 3
the 3
spot 3
directly 3
below 3
your 3
nose 3
and 3
above 3
your 3
upper 3
lip 3
you 3
can 3
easily 3
get 3
an 3
idea 3
of 3
what 3
a 3
short 3
forceful 3
chop 3
in 3
this 3
area 3
would 3
do 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
the 3
head 3
in 3
front 3
of 3
the 3
ear 3
is 3
also 3
a 3
good 3
place 3
to 3
aim 3
your 3
blow 3
in 3
addition 3
to 3
jabs 3
chops 3
twists 3
squeezes 3
and 3
bites 3
you 3
ought 3
to 3
gain 3
some 3
mastery 3
of 3
kneeing 3
and 3
kicking 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
being 3
held 3
in 3
close 3
and 3
facing 3
the 3
porker 3
the 3
old 3
familiar 3
kneeinthenuts 3
will 3
produce 3
remarkable 3
results 3
a 3
feinting 3
motion 3
with 3
the 3
head 3
before 3
the 3
knee 3
is 3
delivered 3
will 3
produce 3
a 3
reflexive 3
reaction 3
from 3
your 3
opponent 3
that 3
will 3
leave 3
his 3
groin 3
totally 3
unprotected 3
ouch 3
whether 3
he 3
has 3
you 3
from 3
the 3
front 3
or 3
the 3
back 3
he 3
is 3
little 3
prepared 3
to 3
defend 3
against 3
a 3
skillfully 3
aimed 3
kick 3
the 3
best 3
way 3
is 3
to 3
forcefully 3
scrape 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
your 3
shoe 3
downward 3
along 3
the 3
shinbone 3
beginning 3
just 3
below 3
the 3
knee 3
and 3
ending 3
with 3
a 3
hard 3
stomp 3
on 3
the 3
instep 3
of 3
the 3
foot 3
just 3
try 3
this 3
with 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
your 3
hand 3
and 3
you 3
will 3
get 3
an 3
idea 3
of 3
the 3
damage 3
you 3
can 3
inflict 3
with 3
this 3
scrape 3
and 3
stomp 3
method 3
another 3
good 3
place 3
to 3
kick 3
and 3
often 3
the 3
only 3
spot 3
accessible 3
is 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
the 3
knee 3
even 3
a 3
half 3
successful 3
blow 3
here 3
will 3
topple 3
the 3
biggest 3
of 3
honkers 3
any 3
of 3
these 3
easy 3
to 3
learn 3
techniques 3
of 3
unarmed 3

will 3
fulfill 3
the 3

strategically 3

to 3

saltpeter 3
available 3

must 3
then 3
be 3
heated 3
over 3
a 3
very 3
low 3
flame 3
it 3
will 3
blend 3
into 3
a 3
plastic 3
substance 3
when 3
this 3
starts 3
to 3
gel 3
remove 3
from 3
the 3
heat 3
and 3
allow 3
the 3
plastic 3
to 3
cool 3
embed 3
a 3
few 3
wooden 3
match 3

into 3
the 3

its 3
still 3

attach 3
a 3

the 3

itself 3

no 3

safety 3
requirements 3
are 3
needed 3
about 3
a 3
pound 3

thick 3
enough 3
smoke 3
to 3
fill 3
a 3

just 3

work 3
fine 3

let 3
it 3
sit 3
in 3
the 3
gasoline 3
for 3
a 3
few 3
days 3
the 3
mixture 3
should 3
be 3
slushy 3
and 3
almost 3
fill 3
the 3

the 3

spreads 3
the 3
flames 3
around 3

regulates 3
the 3
burning 3
the 3

has 3
nearly 3
the 3
same 3
properties 3
as 3
napalm 3

not 3

sterno 3
also 3
work 3
in 3
a 3
pinch 3
plain 3
gasoline 3
will 3
do 3
nicely 3
but 3
it 3
burns 3
very 3
fast 3
a 3
gasolinekerosene 3
mixture 3
is 3
preferred 3
by 3
some 3
folks 3
throwing 3
although 3
by 3
far 3
not 3
the 3
safest 3
method 3
is 3
sometimes 3
necessary 3
the 3
classic 3
technique 3
of 3
stuffing 3
a 3
rag 3
in 3
the 3
neck 3
of 3
a 3
bottle 3
lighting 3
and 3
tossing 3
is 3
foolish 3
often 3
gas 3
fumes 3
escape 3
from 3
the 3
bottle 3
and 3
the 3
mixture 3
ignites 3
too 3
soon 3
endangering 3
the 3
thrower 3
if 3
youre 3
into 3
throwing 3
the 3
following 3
is 3
a 3
much 3
safer 3
method 3
once 3
the 3
mixture 3
is 3
prepared 3
and 3
inside 3
the 3
bottle 3
cap 3
it 3
tightly 3
using 3
the 3
original 3
cap 3
or 3
a 3
suitable 3
cork 3
then 3
wash 3
the 3
bottle 3
off 3
with 3
rubbing 3
alcohol 3
and 3
wipe 3
it 3
clean 3
just 3
before 3
you 3
leave 3
to 3
strike 3
a 3
target 3
take 3
a 3
strip 3
of 3
rag 3
or 3
a 3
tampax 3
and 3
dip 3
it 3
in 3
gasoline 3
wrap 3
this 3
fuse 3
in 3
a 3
small 3
plastic 3
baggie 3
and 3
attach 3
the 3
whole 3
thing 3
to 3
the 3
neck 3
of 3
the 3
capped 3
bottle 3
with 3
the 3
aid 3
of 3
several 3
rubber 3
bands 3
when 3
you 3
are 3
ready 3
to 3
toss 3
use 3
a 3
lighter 3
to 3
ignite 3
the 3
baggie 3
pall 3
back 3
your 3
arm 3
and 3
fling 3
it 3
as 3
soon 3
as 3
the 3
tampax 3
catches 3
fire 3
this 3
is 3
a 3
very 3
safe 3
method 3
if 3
followed 3
to 3
the 3
letter 3
the 3
bottle 3
must 3
break 3
to 3
ignite 3
be 3
sure 3
to 3
throw 3
it 3
with 3
some 3
force 3
against 3
a 3
hard 3
surface 3
naturally 3
an 3
even 3
safer 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
place 3
the 3
firebomb 3
in 3
a 3
stationary 3
position 3
and 3
rig 3
up 3
a 3
timing 3
fuse 3
cap 3
tightly 3
and 3
wipe 3
with 3
alcohol 3
as 3
before 3
the 3
alcohol 3
wipe 3
not 3
only 3
is 3
a 3
safety 3
factor 3
but 3
it 3
eliminates 3
telltale 3
fingerprints 3
in 3
case 3
the 3
molotov 3
doesnt 3
ignite 3
next 3
attach 3
an 3
ashcan 3
fire 3
cracker 3
m 3
or 3
a 3
cherry 3
bomb 3
to 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
the 3
bottle 3
using 3
epoxy 3
glue 3
a 3
fancier 3
way 3
is 3
to 3
punch 3
a 3
hole 3
in 3
the 3
cap 3
and 3
pull 3
the 3
fuse 3
of 3
the 3
cherry 3
bomb 3
up 3
through 3
the 3
hole 3
before 3
you 3
seal 3
the 3
bottle 3
a 3
dab 3
of 3
epoxy 3
will 3
hold 3
the 3
fuse 3
in 3
place 3
and 3
insure 3
the 3
seal 3
a 3
firecracker 3
fuse 3
ignites 3
quickly 3
so 3
something 3
will 3
have 3
to 3
be 3
rigged 3
that 3
will 3
deal 3
the 3
action 3
enough 3
to 3
make 3
a 3
clean 3
getaway 3
when 3
the 3
firebomb 3
is 3
placed 3
where 3
you 3
want 3
it 3
light 3

a 3
nonfilter 3

take 3
a 3
few 3
puffs 3
being 3
sure 3
not 3
to 3
inhale 3
the 3
vile 3

the 3
unlighted 3
end 3
over 3
the 3
fuse 3
of 3
the 3

this 3
will 3
provide 3
a 3
delay 3
of 3
from 3
to 3
minutes 3
to 3
use 3
this 3
type 3
of 3

successfully 3
there 3

the 3
flame 3
wont 3
go 3
out 3

would 3
not 3
be 3
good 3
either 3
when 3
the 3
cancerette 3
burns 3
down 3
it 3
sets 3
off 3
the 3

which 3
in 3
turn 3
explodes 3

pipe 3
bombs 3
perhaps 3
the 3
most 3
widely 3
used 3
homemade 3
concussion 3
bombs 3
are 3
those 3
made 3

george 3
metesky 3
the 3
renown 3

bomber 3
they 3
are 3
deadly 3
safe 3
easy 3
to 3
assemble 3
and 3
small 3
enough 3
to 3
transport 3
in 3
your 3
pocket 3
you 3
want 3
a 3
standard 3
steel 3
pipe 3
two 3
inches 3
in 3
diameter 3
is 3
a 3
good 3
size 3
that 3
is 3
threaded 3
on 3
both 3
ends 3
so 3
you 3
can 3
cap 3
it 3
the 3
length 3
you 3
use 3
depends 3
on 3
how 3
big 3

is 3

sizes 3
between 3

successfully 3
employed 3
make 3
sure 3
both 3
caps 3
screw 3
on 3
tightly 3
before 3
you 3
insert 3
the 3
powder 3
the 3
basic 3
idea 3
to 3
remember 3
is 3
that 3
a 3
bomb 3
is 3
simply 3
a 3
hot 3
fire 3
burning 3
very 3
rapidly 3
in 3
a 3
tightly 3
confined 3
space 3
the 3
rapidly 3
expanding 3
gases 3
burst 3
against 3
the 3
walls 3
of 3
the 3
bomb 3
if 3
they 3
are 3
trapped 3
in 3
a 3
tightly 3
sealed 3
iron 3
pipe 3
when 3
they 3
finally 3
break 3
out 3
they 3
do 3
so 3
with 3
incredible 3
force 3
if 3
the 3
bomb 3
itself 3
is 3
placed 3
in 3
a 3
somewhat 3
enclosed 3
area 3
like 3
a 3
ventilation 3
shaft 3
doorway 3
or 3
alleyway 3
it 3
will 3
in 3
turn 3
convert 3
this 3
larger 3
area 3
into 3
a 3
bomb 3
and 3
increase 3
the 3
overall 3
explosion 3
immensely 3
when 3
you 3
have 3
the 3
right 3
pipe 3
and 3
both 3
caps 3
selected 3
drill 3
a 3

in 3
the 3
side 3
of 3
the 3

is 3

not 3
confuse 3
the 3

been 3
finished 3
off 3
by 3
the 3
porkers 3
and 3
thats 3
no 3
joke 3
it 3
is 3
usually 3
better 3
to 3
treat 3
a 3
person 3
yourself 3
rather 3
than 3
let 3
the 3
pigs 3
get 3
them 3
unless 3
they 3
have 3
ambulance 3
equipment 3
right 3
there 3
and 3
dont 3
seem 3
vicious 3
even 3
then 3
they 3
will 3
often 3
wait 3
until 3
they 3
get 3
two 3
or 3
three 3
victims 3
before 3
making 3
a 3

as 3
being 3
a 3
diabetic 3

having 3
a 3

that 3

we 3
advise 3
that 3

give 3
only 3
your 3

there 3
is 3

you 3
are 3
obligated 3

the 3

to 3
do 3
even 3
that 3
but 3
most 3
lawyers 3
feel 3
you 3
should 3
the 3
address 3
can 3
be 3
that 3
of 3
a 3
friend 3
if 3
youre 3
uptight 3
about 3
the 3
pigs 3
knowing 3
where 3
you 3
live 3
when 3
the 3
pigs 3
grab 3
you 3
chances 3
are 3
they 3
are 3
going 3
to 3
insult 3
you 3
rough 3
you 3
up 3
a 3
little 3
and 3
maybe 3
even 3
try 3
to 3
plant 3
some 3
evidence 3
on 3
you 3
try 3
to 3
keep 3
your 3
cool 3
any 3
struggle 3
on 3
your 3
part 3
even 3
lying 3
on 3
the 3
street 3
limp 3
can 3
be 3
considered 3
resisting 3
arrest 3
even 3
if 3
you 3
beat 3
the 3
original 3
charge 3
you 3
can 3
be 3
found 3
guilty 3
of 3
resisting 3
and 3
receive 3
a 3
prison 3
sentence 3
often 3
if 3
the 3
pigs 3
beat 3
you 3
they 3
will 3
say 3
that 3
you 3
attacked 3
them 3
and 3
generally 3
charge 3
you 3
with 3
assault 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
stopped 3
in 3
the 3
street 3
on 3
suspicion 3
which 3
means 3
youre 3
black 3
or 3
have 3
long 3
hair 3
the 3
police 3
have 3
the 3
right 3
to 3
pat 3
you 3
down 3
to 3
see 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
carrying 3
a 3
weapon 3
they 3
cannot 3
search 3
you 3
unless 3
they 3
place 3
you 3
under 3
arrest 3
technically 3
this 3
can 3
only 3
be 3
done 3
in 3
the 3
police 3
station 3
where 3
they 3
have 3
the 3
right 3
to 3
examine 3
your 3
possessions 3
thus 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
in 3
a 3
potential 3
arrest 3
situation 3
you 3
should 3
refrain 3
from 3
carrying 3
dope 3
sharp 3
objects 3
that 3
can 3
be 3
classified 3
as 3
a 3
weapon 3
and 3
the 3
names 3
and 3
phone 3
numbers 3
of 3
people 3
close 3
to 3
you 3
like 3
your 3
dealer 3
your 3
local 3
bomb 3
factory 3
and 3
your 3
friends 3
underground 3
forget 3
about 3
talking 3
your 3
way 3
out 3
of 3
it 3
or 3
escaping 3
once 3
youre 3
in 3
the 3
car 3
or 3
paddy 3
wagon 3
in 3
the 3
police 3
station 3
insist 3
on 3
being 3
allowed 3
to 3
call 3
your 3
lawyer 3
getting 3
change 3
might 3
be 3
a 3
problem 3
so 3
you 3
should 3
always 3
have 3
a 3
few 3
dimes 3
hidden 3
since 3
many 3
cases 3
are 3
dismissed 3
because 3
of 3
this 3
youll 3
generally 3
be 3
allowed 3
to 3
make 3
some 3
calls 3
but 3
it 3
might 3
take 3
a 3
few 3
hours 3
call 3
a 3
close 3
friend 3
and 3
tell 3
him 3
to 3
get 3
all 3
the 3
cash 3
that 3
can 3
be 3
quickly 3
raised 3
and 3
head 3
down 3
to 3
the 3
court 3
house 3
usually 3
the 3
police 3
will 3
let 3
you 3
know 3
where 3
youll 3
be 3
taken 3
if 3
they 3
dont 3
just 3
tell 3
your 3
friend 3
what 3
precinct 3
youre 3
being 3
held 3
at 3
and 3
he 3
can 3
call 3
the 3
central 3
police 3
headquarters 3
and 3
find 3
out 3
what 3
court 3
youll 3
be 3
appearing 3
in 3
ask 3
your 3
friend 3
to 3
also 3
call 3
a 3
lawyer 3
which 3
you 3
also 3
should 3
do 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
another 3
phone 3
call 3
hang 3
up 3
and 3
dial 3
a 3
lawyer 3
or 3
defense 3
committee 3
that 3
has 3
been 3
set 3
up 3
for 3
demonstrations 3
the 3
lawyer 3
will 3
either 3
come 3
to 3
the 3
station 3
or 3
meet 3
you 3
in 3
court 3
depending 3
on 3
the 3
severity 3
of 3
the 3
charge 3
and 3
the 3
likelihood 3
youll 3
be 3
beaten 3
in 3
the 3
station 3
when 3
massive 3
demonstrations 3
are 3
occurring 3
where 3
a 3
number 3
of 3
busts 3
are 3
anticipated 3
its 3
best 3
to 3
have 3
lawyers 3
placed 3
in 3
police 3
stations 3
in 3
the 3
immediate 3
vicinity 3
the 3
lawyer 3
will 3
want 3
to 3
know 3
as 3
many 3
details 3
as 3
possible 3
of 3
the 3
case 3
so 3
try 3
and 3
concentrate 3
on 3
remembering 3
a 3
number 3
of 3
things 3
since 3
the 3
pigs 3
arent 3
going 3
to 3
let 3
you 3
take 3
notes 3
if 3
you 3
can 3
remember 3

three 3

often 3
offer 3

life 3

this 3
section 3
presents 3
some 3
general 3
guidelines 3
on 3
thievery 3
to 3
put 3
you 3
ahead 3
of 3
the 3
impulse 3
swiping 3
with 3
some 3
planning 3
ahead 3
practice 3
and 3
a 3
little 3
nerve 3
you 3
can 3
pick 3
up 3
on 3
some 3
terrific 3
bargains 3
being 3
a 3
successful 3
shoplifter 3
requires 3
the 3
development 3
of 3
an 3
outlaw 3
mentality 3
when 3
you 3
enter 3
a 3
store 3
you 3
should 3
already 3
have 3
cased 3
the 3
joint 3
so 3
dont 3
browse 3
around 3
examining 3
all 3
sorts 3
of 3
items 3
staring 3
over 3
your 3
shoulder 3
and 3
generally 3
appearing 3
like 3
youre 3
about 3
to 3
snatch 3
something 3
and 3
are 3
afraid 3
of 3
getting 3
caught 3
enter 3
having 3
a 3
good 3
idea 3
of 3
what 3
you 3
want 3
and 3
where 3
its 3
located 3
camouflage 3
is 3
important 3
be 3
sure 3
you 3
dress 3
the 3
part 3
by 3
looking 3
like 3
an 3
average 3
customer 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
going 3
to 3
ripoff 3
expensive 3
stores 3
why 3
settle 3
for 3
less 3
act 3
like 3
you 3
have 3
a 3
chauffeur 3
driven 3
car 3
double 3
parked 3
around 3
the 3
corner 3
a 3
good 3
rule 3
is 3
dress 3
in 3
the 3
style 3
and 3
price 3
range 3
of 3
the 3
clothes 3
etc 3
you 3
are 3
about 3
to 3
shoplift 3
the 3
reason 3
we 3
recommend 3
the 3
more 3
expensive 3
stores 3
is 3
that 3
they 3
tend 3
to 3
have 3
less 3
security 3
guards 3
relying 3
instead 3
on 3
mechanical 3
methods 3
or 3
more 3
usually 3
on 3
just 3
the 3
sales 3
people 3
many 3
salespeople 3
are 3
uptight 3
about 3
carrying 3
out 3
a 3
bust 3
if 3
they 3
catch 3
you 3
a 3
large 3
number 3
are 3
thieves 3
themselves 3
in 3
fact 3
one 3
good 3
way 3
to 3
steal 3
is 3
simply 3
explain 3
to 3
the 3
salesclerk 3
that 3
youre 3
broke 3
and 3
ask 3
if 3
you 3
can 3
take 3
something 3
without 3
paying 3
its 3
a 3
great 3
way 3
to 3
radicalize 3
shop 3
personnel 3
by 3
rapping 3
to 3
them 3
about 3
why 3
they 3
shouldnt 3
give 3
a 3
shit 3
if 3
the 3
boss 3
gets 3
ripped 3
off 3
the 3
best 3
time 3
to 3
work 3
out 3
is 3
on 3
a 3
rainy 3
cold 3
day 3
during 3
a 3
busy 3
shopping 3
season 3

is 3
rigged 3
with 3
electronic 3
eyes 3
they 3
are 3
often 3
at 3
the 3
waist 3
level 3
which 3
means 3
if 3
the 3

the 3
electronic 3
eyes 3

often 3
disguised 3
as 3
part 3
of 3
the 3
decor 3
by 3
checking 3
to 3
see 3
what 3
the 3
cashier 3

you 3
can 3
be 3
sure 3
if 3
the 3
store 3
is 3
rigged 3
other 3
methods 3
are 3
undercover 3
pigs 3
that 3
look 3

shoppers 3
oneway 3
mirrors 3
and 3
remote 3
control 3
television 3
cameras 3
undercover 3
pigs 3
are 3
expensive 3
so 3
stores 3
are 3
usually 3
understaffed 3
just 3
watch 3
out 3
without 3
appearing 3
to 3
watch 3
out 3
that 3
no 3
one 3
observes 3
you 3
in 3

and 3
cameras 3
there 3
are 3
always 3
blind 3
spots 3
in 3
a 3
store 3
created 3
when 3
displays 3
are 3
moved 3
around 3
counters 3
shifted 3
and 3
boxes 3
piled 3
in 3
the 3
aisles 3
mirrors 3
and 3
cameras 3
are 3
rarely 3
adjusted 3
to 3
fit 3
these 3
changes 3
dont 3
get 3
turned 3
off 3
by 3
this 3
security 3
jazz 3
the 3
percentage 3
of 3
stores 3
that 3
have 3
sophisticated 3
security 3
systems 3
such 3
as 3
those 3
described 3
is 3
very 3
small 3
if 3
you 3
work 3
out 3
at 3
lunch 3
time 3
the 3
security 3
guards 3
and 3
many 3
of 3
the 3
sales 3
personnel 3
will 3
be 3
out 3
of 3
the 3
store 3
just 3
before 3
closing 3
is 3
also 3
good 3
because 3
the 3
clerks 3
are 3
concentrating 3
on 3
going 3
home 3
by 3
taking 3
only 3
one 3
or 3
two 3
items 3
you 3
can 3
prevent 3
a 3
bust 3
if 3
caught 3
by 3
just 3
acting 3
like 3
a 3
dizzy 3
klepto 3
socialite 3
getting 3
kicks 3
or 3
use 3
the 3
ohgeeiforgottopay 3
routine 3
stores 3
dont 3
want 3
to 3
hassle 3
going 3
into 3
court 3
to 3
press 3
charges 3
so 3
they 3
usually 3
let 3
you 3
go 3
after 3
you 3
return 3
the 3
stuff 3
if 3
you 3
thought 3
ahead 3
youll 3
have 3
some 3
cash 3
ready 3
to 3
pay 3
for 3
the 3
items 3
youve 3
pocketed 3
if 3
caught 3
leave 3
your 3
id 3
and 3
phone 3
book 3
at 3
home 3
before 3
going 3
shopping 3
people 3
rarely 3
go 3
to 3
jail 3
for 3
shoplifting 3
most 3
if 3
caught 3
never 3
even 3
see 3
a 3
real 3
cop 3
just 3
lie 3
like 3
a 3
fucker 3
and 3
the 3
most 3
youll 3
get 3
is 3
a 3
lecture 3
on 3
law 3
and 3
order 3
and 3
a 3
warning 3
not 3
to 3
come 3
back 3
to 3
that 3
store 3
or 3
else 3
techniques 3
the 3
lining 3
of 3
a 3
bulky 3
overcoat 3
or 3
loose 3
raincoat 3
can 3
be 3
elaborately 3
outfitted 3
with 3
a 3
variety 3
of 3
custommade 3
large 3
pockets 3
the 3
openings 3
to 3
these 3
pockets 3
are 3
not 3
visible 3
since 3
they 3
are 3
inside 3
the 3
coat 3
the 3
outside 3
pockets 3
can 3
be 3
torn 3
out 3
leaving 3
only 3
the 3
opening 3
or 3
slit 3
thus 3
you 3
can 3
reach 3
your 3
hand 3
at 3
counter 3
level 3
through 3
the 3
slit 3
in 3
your 3
coat 3
and 3
drop 3
objects 3
into 3
the 3
secret 3
pockets 3
sewn 3
into 3
the 3
lining 3
pants 3
can 3
also 3
be 3
rigged 3
with 3
secret 3
pockets 3
the 3
idea 3
is 3
to 3
let 3
your 3
fingers 3
do 3
the 3
walking 3
through 3
the 3
slit 3
in 3
your 3
coat 3
while 3
the 3
rest 3
of 3
the 3
body 3
remains 3

casual 3
browser 3
youll 3
be 3
amazed 3
at 3
how 3
much 3
you 3
can 3
tuck 3
away 3
without 3
any 3
noticeable 3
bulge 3
another 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
use 3
a 3
hidden 3
belt 3
attached 3
to 3
the 3
inside 3
of 3
your 3
coat 3
or 3
pants 3
the 3
belt 3
is 3
specially 3
designed 3
with 3
hooks 3
or 3
clothespins 3
to 3
which 3
items 3
can 3
be 3
discretely 3
attached 3
ditching 3
items 3
into 3
hidden 3
pockets 3
requires 3
a 3
little 3
cunning 3
you 3
should 3
practice 3
before 3
a 3
mirror 3
until 3
you 3
get 3
good 3
at 3
it 3
a 3
good 3
idea 3
is 3
to 3
work 3
with 3
a 3
partner 3
dig 3
this 3
neat 3
duet 3
a 3
man 3
and 3
woman 3
walk 3
into 3
a 3
store 3
together 3
looking 3
like 3
a 3
respectable 3
husband 3
and 3
wife 3
the 3
man 3
purchases 3
a 3
good 3
belt 3
or 3
shirt 3
and 3
engages 3
the 3
salesman 3
in 3
some 3
distracting 3
conversation 3
as 3
he 3
rings 3
up 3
the 3
sale 3
meanwhile 3
back 3
in 3
the 3

roll 3
them 3
up 3

bundle 3
is 3
then 3
tucked 3
between 3
your 3
thighs 3
the 3
whole 3
operation 3
takes 3
about 3
a 3
minute 3
and 3
with 3
some 3
practice 3
you 3
can 3
walk 3

see 3
one 3
of 3
the 3
best 3
gimmicks 3
around 3

on 3
the 3

letters 3
with 3
any 3
polyester 3

next 3
the 3
plastic 3

should 3
be 3
held 3
against 3
a 3

iron 3
until 3

can 3
use 3
a 3
razor 3

this 3
combination 3
of 3
razor 3
blade 3
and 3
hot 3
iron 3
when 3
worked 3
skillfully 3
will 3
produce 3
a 3
perfect 3
blank 3

the 3
original 3
at 3
any 3
stationary 3

if 3
this 3
is 3
too 3
hard 3
you 3
can 3
buy 3
machines 3
to 3
make 3
your 3
own 3
credit 3
cards 3
which 3
are 3
made 3
for 3
small 3
department 3
stores 3
granted 3
this 3
method 3
is 3
going 3
require 3
some 3
expertise 3
but 3
once 3
youve 3
learned 3
to 3
successfully 3
forge 3
a 3
credit 3
card 3
buy 3

meals 3
and 3
even 3
get 3
real 3
money 3
from 3
a 3
bank 3
the 3
absolute 3
best 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
have 3
an 3
accomplice 3
working 3
in 3
the 3
post 3
office 3
rip 3
off 3
the 3
new 3
cards 3
that 3
are 3
mailed 3
out 3
they 3
get 3
to 3
know 3
quickly 3
which 3
envelopes 3
contain 3
new 3
credit 3
cards 3
since 3
the 3
person 3
never 3
receives 3
the 3
card 3
it 3
never 3
dawns 3
on 3
them 3
to 3
report 3
it 3
stolen 3
this 3
gives 3
you 3
at 3
least 3
a 3
solid 3
month 3
of 3
carefree 3
spending 3
and 3
your 3
signature 3
will 3
be 3
perfect 3
whether 3
your 3
credit 3
card 3
is 3
stolen 3
borrowed 3
or 3
forged 3
you 3
still 3
have 3
to 3
follow 3
some 3
guidelines 3
to 3
get 3
away 3
without 3
any 3
hassle 3
know 3
the 3
stores 3
checking 3
method 3
before 3
you 3
pass 3
the 3
hot 3
card 3
most 3
stores 3
have 3
a 3
fiftydollar 3
limit 3
where 3
they 3
only 3
call 3
upstairs 3
on 3
items 3
costing 3
fifty 3
dollars 3
or 3
more 3
in 3
some 3
stores 3
its 3
less 3
some 3
places 3
have 3
a 3
regiscope 3
system 3
that 3
takes 3
your 3
picture 3
with 3
each 3
purchase 3
you 3
should 3
always 3
carry 3
at 3
least 3
one 3
piece 3
of 3
backup 3
identification 3
to 3
use 3
with 3
the 3
phony 3
card 3
as 3
the 3
clerk 3
might 3
get 3
suspicious 3
if 3
you 3
dont 3
have 3
any 3
other 3
id 3
they 3
can 3
check 3
out 3
a 3
hot 3
list 3
that 3
the 3
credit 3
card 3
companies 3
send 3
out 3
monthly 3
so 3
if 3
youre 3

about 3
anything 3
watch 3
the 3
clerks 3
movements 3
at 3

times 3
if 3
things 3

tight 3
just 3
split 3
real 3
quick 3
often 3
even 3
if 3
a 3

boss 3
thinks 3
its 3
a 3
phony 3
theyll 3
ok 3

this 3
nasty 3
cut 3
the 3

off 3
an 3
ordinary 3

the 3

unscrew 3
the 3
mouthpiece 3
on 3
the 3

and 3
remove 3
the 3

you 3
will 3
see 3
a 3
red 3

a 3
black 3
wire 3
attached 3
to 3

what 3
you 3
are 3
doing 3
is 3
sending 3
volts 3
of 3
electricity 3
back 3
through 3
equipment 3
which 3
is 3
built 3
for 3
only 3
volts 3
you 3
can 3
knock 3
off 3
thousands 3
of 3
phones 3
switchboards 3
and 3
devices 3
if 3
all 3
goes 3
right 3
its 3
best 3
to 3
do 3
this 3
on 3
the 3
phone 3
in 3
a 3
large 3
office 3
building 3
or 3
university 3
you 3
certainly 3
will 3
knock 3
out 3
their 3
fuses 3
unfortunately 3
at 3
home 3
your 3
own 3
phone 3
will 3
probably 3
be 3
knocked 3
out 3
of 3
commission 3
if 3
that 3
happens 3
simply 3
call 3
up 3
the 3
business 3
office 3
and 3
complain 3
theyll 3
give 3
you 3
a 3
new 3
phone 3
just 3
the 3
way 3
they 3
give 3
the 3
other 3
seven 3
million 3
people 3
that 3
requested 3
them 3
that 3
day 3
remember 3
january 3
is 3
alien 3
registration 3
month 3
so 3
dont 3
forget 3
to 3
fill 3
out 3
an 3
application 3
at 3
the 3
post 3
office 3
listing 3
yourself 3
as 3
a 3
citizen 3
of 3
free 3
nation 3
then 3
when 3
they 3
ask 3
you 3
to 3
love 3
it 3
or 3
leave 3
it 3
tell 3
them 3
you 3
already 3
left 3
piece 3
now 3
its 3
ridiculous 3
to 3
talk 3
about 3
a 3
revolution 3
without 3
a 3
few 3
words 3
on 3
guns 3
if 3
you 3
havent 3
been 3
in 3
the 3
army 3
or 3
done 3
some 3
hunting 3
you 3
probably 3
have 3
a 3
builtin 3
fear 3
against 3
guns 3
that 3
can 3
only 3
be 3
overcome 3
by 3
familiarizing 3
yourself 3
with 3
them 3
handguns 3
there 3
are 3
two 3
basic 3
types 3
of 3
handguns 3
or 3
pistols 3
the 3
revolver 3
carries 3
a 3
load 3
of 3
or 3
bullets 3
in 3
a 3
revolving 3
chamber 3
the 3
automatic 3
usually 3
holds 3
the 3
same 3
number 3
but 3
some 3
can 3
hold 3
up 3
to 3
bullets 3
also 3
in 3
the 3
automatic 3
the 3
bullets 3
can 3
be 3
already 3
packed 3
in 3
a 3
magazine 3
which 3
quickly 3
snaps 3
into 3
position 3
in 3
the 3
handle 3
the 3
revolver 3
must 3
be 3
reloaded 3
one 3
bullet 3
at 3
a 3
time 3
an 3
automatic 3
can 3
jam 3
on 3
rare 3
occasions 3
or 3
misfire 3
but 3
with 3
a 3
revolver 3
you 3
just 3
pull 3
the 3
trigger 3
and 3
theres 3
a 3
new 3
bullet 3
ready 3
to 3
fire 3
despite 3

is 3
a 3

the 3
advantage 3
of 3

meaning 3
that 3

possible 3
a 3

do 3
not 3
bother 3
with 3
any 3
handgun 3
smaller 3

usually 3
pretty 3

in 3
nearly 3

about 3
its 3
light 3
short 3

that 3

leave 3
the 3
barrel 3
there 3
are 3
two 3
common 3
types 3
the 3
pump 3
action 3
and 3
the 3
semiautomatic 3
single 3
shot 3
types 3
and 3
doublebarrel 3
types 3
do 3
not 3
have 3
a 3
high 3
enough 3
rate 3
of 3
fire 3
for 3
selfdefense 3
the 3
pump 3
action 3
is 3
easy 3
to 3
use 3
and 3
reliable 3
it 3
usually 3
holds 3
about 3
five 3
shells 3
in 3
a 3
tube 3
underneath 3
the 3
barrel 3
for 3
selfdefense 3
you 3
should 3
use 3
buckshot 3
shells 3
shotguns 3
come 3
in 3
various 3
gauges 3
but 3
you 3
will 3
want 3
the 3
largest 3
commonly 3
available 3
the 3
gauge 3
the 3
mossberg 3
model 3
a 3
is 3
a 3
super 3
weapon 3
in 3
this 3
category 3
which 3
sells 3
for 3
about 3
when 3
buying 3
one 3
try 3
to 3
get 3
a 3
shotgun 3
with 3
a 3
barrel 3
as 3
short 3
as 3
possible 3
up 3
to 3
the 3
legal 3
limit 3
of 3
inches 3
it 3
is 3
easy 3
to 3
cut 3
down 3
a 3
longer 3
barrel 3
too 3
this 3
increases 3
the 3
area 3
sprayed 3
the 3
semiautomatic 3
gun 3
is 3
not 3
used 3
too 3
much 3
for 3
selfdefense 3
as 3
they 3
usually 3
hold 3
only 3
three 3
shells 3
with 3
some 3
practice 3
you 3
can 3
shoot 3
a 3
pump 3
nearly 3
as 3
fast 3
as 3
a 3
semiautomatic 3
and 3
they 3
are 3
much 3
cheaper 3
see 3
the 3
gun 3
books 3
catalogued 3
in 3
the 3
appendix 3
for 3
more 3
information 3
there 3
are 3
many 3
other 3
good 3
guns 3
available 3
and 3
a 3
great 3
deal 3
to 3
know 3
about 3
choosing 3
the 3
right 3
gun 3
for 3
the 3
right 3
situation 3
reading 3
a 3
little 3
right 3
wing 3
gun 3
literature 3
will 3
help 3
other 3
weapons 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
around 3
a 3
military 3
base 3
you 3
will 3
find 3
it 3
relatively 3
easy 3
to 3
get 3
your 3
hands 3
on 3
an 3
m 3
grenade 3
launcher 3
which 3
is 3
like 3
a 3
giant 3
shotgun 3
and 3
is 3
probably 3
the 3
best 3
selfdefense 3
weapon 3
of 3
all 3
time 3
just 3
inquire 3
discreetly 3
among 3
some 3
longhaired 3
soldiers 3
training 3
owning 3
a 3
gun 3
aint 3
shit 3
unless 3
you 3
know 3
how 3
to 3
use 3
it 3
they 3
make 3
a 3
hell 3
of 3
a 3
racket 3
when 3
fired 3
so 3
you 3
just 3
cant 3
work 3
out 3
in 3
your 3
den 3
or 3
cellar 3
except 3
with 3
a 3
bb 3
gun 3
which 3
is 3
good 3
in 3
between 3
real 3
practice 3
sessions 3
find 3
a 3
buddy 3
who 3
served 3
in 3
the 3
military 3
or 3
is 3
into 3
hunting 3
or 3
targetshooting 3
and 3
ask 3
him 3
to 3
teach 3
you 3
the 3
fundamentals 3
of 3
gun 3
handling 3
and 3
safety 3
if 3
youre 3
over 3
you 3
can 3
practice 3
on 3
one 3
of 3
your 3
local 3
firing 3
ranges 3
look 3
them 3
up 3
in 3
the 3
yellow 3
pages 3
call 3
and 3
see 3
if 3
they 3
offer 3
instructions 3
they 3
are 3
usually 3
pretty 3
cheap 3
to 3
use 3
in 3
an 3
hour 3
you 3
can 3
learn 3
the 3
basics 3
you 3
need 3
to 3
know 3
about 3
guns 3
and 3
the 3
rest 3
is 3
mostly 3
practice 3

for 3

upstream 3

release 3
the 3

into 3
the 3
water 3
as 3
they 3
rush 3
downstream 3

check 3
out 3
the 3
local 3
laws 3
there 3
are 3

just 3
for 3
the 3
bread 3
from 3

individual 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
over 3
years 3
old 3

can 3
get 3

just 3
another 3
latin 3

youll 3
get 3
a 3
taste 3
of 3
the 3

take 3
it 3

watch 3
out 3
because 3
this 3
is 3
illegal 3
soon 3
the 3

will 3

undercover 3
agents 3
be 3
absolutely 3
sure 3
and 3
put 3
them 3
up 3
instead 3
since 3
the 3
folks 3
underground 3
move 3
freely 3
among 3
us 3
we 3
must 3
be 3
totally 3
cool 3
if 3
by 3
chance 3
we 3
recognize 3
a 3
fugitive 3

deem 3
it 3
necessary 3

you 3
are 3
very 3
active 3
in 3
the 3

chances 3
are 3
you 3
are 3
being 3
watched 3

tapped 3
and 3
it 3
would 3
be 3
foolhardy 3
to 3
make 3
contact 3
the 3
underground 3
would 3
be 3
meaningless 3
without 3
the 3

a 3
massive 3
community 3
with 3
corresponding 3
political 3

people 3
above 3

continuing 3

intensifying 3

the 3

only 3
in 3
rare 3
cases 3
is 3
it 3
necessary 3

abandon 3
the 3
outward 3

belonging 3
to 3
the 3

changing 3
the 3
way 3
they 3
live 3
the 3
typical 3

would 3
stand 3
out 3
like 3
jimmy 3

in 3
a 3
tribe 3
of 3
apaches 3
in 3
the 3
usual 3
case 3
the 3
authorities 3
do 3
not 3
look 3
for 3
a 3
fugitive 3
in 3
the 3
sense 3
of 3
carrying 3
on 3
a 3
massive 3
manhunt 3
generally 3
people 3
are 3
caught 3
for 3
breaking 3
some 3
minor 3
offense 3
and 3
during 3
the 3
routine 3
arrest 3
procedure 3
their 3
fingerprints 3
give 3
them 3
away 3
thus 3
for 3
a 3
fugitive 3
having 3
good 3
identification 3
papers 3
being 3
careful 3
about 3
violations 3
such 3

speeding 3

loitering 3
and 3
not 3
carrying 3

manuals 3
become 3
an 3
important 3
part 3
of 3
the 3

it 3
is 3
also 3
a 3
good 3
idea 3
to 3
have 3
at 3
least 3
a 3
hundred 3
dollars 3
cash 3
on 3
you 3
at 3
all 3
times 3
often 3
even 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
arrested 3
you 3
can 3
bail 3
yourself 3
out 3
and 3
split 3
long 3
before 3
the 3
fingerprints 3
or 3
other 3
identification 3
checks 3
are 3
completed 3
if 3
by 3
some 3
chance 3
you 3
are 3
placed 3
on 3
the 3
most 3

a 3
signal 3
that 3
the 3
fbi 3
are 3
indeed 3
conducting 3
a 3
manhunt 3
it 3
is 3
also 3
the 3
hint 3
that 3
they 3
have 3
uncovered 3
some 3
clues 3
and 3
feel 3
confident 3
they 3
can 3
nab 3
you 3
soon 3
the 3
list 3
is 3
a 3
public 3
relations 3
gimmick 3
that 3
hooper 3
or 3
whatever 3
his 3
name 3
is 3
dreamed 3
up 3
to 3
show 3
the 3
fbi 3
as 3
super 3
sleuths 3
and 3
compliment 3
the 3
bullshit 3
image 3
of 3
them 3
that 3
hollywood 3
lays 3
down 3
most 3

agents 3
are 3
southerners 3
who 3
majored 3
in 3
accounting 3
or 3
some 3
other 3
creative 3
field 3
when 3
you 3
are 3
placed 3
on 3
the 3
list 3
go 3
deeper 3
underground 3
it 3
may 3
become 3
necessary 3
to 3
curtail 3
your 3
activities 3
for 3
a 3
while 3
the 3
manhunt 3
lasts 3
only 3
as 3
long 3
as 3
you 3
are 3
newsworthy 3
since 3
the 3
fbi 3
is 3
very 3
media 3
conscious 3
change 3
your 3
disguise 3
identification 3
and 3
narrow 3
your 3
circle 3
of 3
contacts 3
in 3
a 3
few 3
months 3
when 3
the 3
heat 3
is 3
off 3
youll 3
be 3
able 3
to 3
be 3
more 3

for 3
the 3
time 3

tight 3

an 3
amateur 3
photographer 3

close 3
to 3
the 3

you 3
can 3
get 3
if 3
you 3
use 3
phony 3
state 3

city 3
papers 3
such 3
as 3

from 3
the 3

in 3

are 3
often 3
part 3
of 3
a 3
coding 3
system 3
most 3
are 3
easy 3
to 3
figure 3
out 3
simply 3
by 3
studying 3
a 3
few 3
similar 3
authentic 3
cards 3
almost 3
all 3
id 3
cards 3
use 3
one 3
or 3
another 3
ibm 3
selectric 3
type 3
to 3
fill 3
in 3
the 3
individuals 3
papers 3
you 3
can 3
buy 3
the 3
exact 3
model 3
used 3
by 3
federal 3
and 3
state 3
agencies 3
for 3
less 3
than 3
and 3
install 3
the 3
ball 3
in 3
seconds 3
on 3
any 3
selectric 3
machine 3
when 3
you 3
finish 3
the 3
typing 3
operation 3
sign 3
your 3
new 3
name 3
and 3
trim 3
the 3
card 3
to 3
the 3
size 3
you 3
want 3
rub 3
some 3
dirt 3
on 3
the 3
card 3
and 3
bend 3
it 3
a 3
little 3
to 3
eliminate 3
its 3
newness 3
another 3
method 3
is 3
to 3
obtain 3
a 3
set 3
of 3
papers 3
from 3
a 3
close 3
friend 3
of 3
similar 3
characteristics 3
your 3
friend 3
can 3
replace 3
the 3
originals 3
without 3
too 3
much 3
trouble 3
in 3
both 3
cases 3
it 3
might 3
be 3
advisable 3
to 3
get 3
authentic 3
papers 3
using 3
the 3
phonies 3
you 3
have 3
in 3
your 3
possession 3
in 3
some 3
states 3
getting 3
a 3
license 3
or 3
voting 3
registration 3
card 3
is 3
very 3
easy 3
library 3
cards 3
and 3
other 3
supplementary 3
ids 3
are 3
simple 3
to 3
get 3
a 3
passport 3
should 3
not 3
be 3
attempted 3
until 3
you 3
definitely 3
have 3
made 3
up 3
your 3
mind 3
to 3
split 3
the 3
country 3
that 3
way 3
agencies 3
have 3
less 3
time 3
to 3
check 3
the 3
information 3
and 3
you 3
can 3
decide 3
on 3
the 3
disguise 3
to 3
be 3
used 3
for 3
the 3
picture 3
unless 3
you 3
expect 3
to 3
get 3
hotter 3
than 3
you 3
are 3
right 3
now 3
in 3
which 3
case 3
get 3
it 3
now 3
it 3
is 3
wise 3
to 3
have 3
two 3
sets 3
of 3
identification 3
to 3
be 3
on 3
the 3
safe 3
side 3
but 3
never 3
have 3
both 3
in 3
your 3
possession 3
at 3
the 3
same 3
time 3
if 3
you 3
sense 3
the 3
authorities 3
are 3
close 3
to 3
mailing 3
you 3
and 3
choose 3
to 3
go 3
underground 3
prepare 3
all 3
the 3
identification 3
papers 3
well 3
in 3
advance 3
and 3
store 3
them 3
in 3
a 3
secure 3
place 3
inform 3
no 3
one 3
of 3
your 3
possible 3
new 3
identity 3
before 3
you 3
start 3
passing 3
phony 3
ids 3
to 3
cops 3
banks 3
and 3
passport 3
offices 3
you 3
should 3
have 3
experience 3
with 3
lesser 3
targets 3
so 3
you 3
feel 3
comfortable 3
using 3
them 3
there 3
are 3
stiff 3
penalties 3
for 3
this 3
if 3
you 3
get 3
caught 3
a 3
few 3
better 3
methods 3
than 3
the 3
ones 3
listed 3
above 3
exist 3
but 3
we 3
feel 3
they 3
should 3
not 3
be 3
made 3
this 3
public 3
with 3
a 3
little 3
imagination 3
youll 3
have 3
no 3
trouble 3
dig 3
communication 3
living 3
underground 3
like 3
exile 3
can 3
be 3
extremely 3
lonely 3
especially 3
during 3
the 3
initial 3
adjustment 3
period 3
when 3
you 3
have 3
to 3
reshuffle 3
your 3
living 3
habits 3
psychologically 3
it 3
becomes 3
necessary 3
to 3
maintain 3
a 3
few 3
close 3
contacts 3
with 3
other 3
fugitives 3
or 3
folks 3
aboveground 3
this 3
is 3
also 3
necessary 3
if 3
you 3
plan 3
to 3
continue 3
waging 3
revolutionary 3
struggle 3
this 3
means 3
communication 3
if 3
you 3
contact 3
persons 3
or 3
arrange 3
for 3
them 3
to 3
contact 3
you 3
be 3
super 3
cool 3
dont 3
rush 3
into 3
meetings 3
stay 3
off 3
the 3
phone 3
if 3
you 3
must 3
use 3
pay 3
phones 3
have 3
the 3
contact 3
person 3
go 3
to 3
a 3
prescribed 3
booth 3
at 3
prescribed 3
time 3
knowing 3
the 3
phone 3
number 3
beforehand 3
you 3
can 3
call 3
from 3
another 3
pay 3
phone 3
the 3
pay 3
phone 3
system 3
is 3
superior 3
to 3
debugging 3
devices 3
and 3
voice 3
scramblers 3
even 3
so 3
some 3
pay 3
phones 3
that 3
local 3
police 3
suspect 3
bookies 3
use 3
are 3
monitored 3
keep 3
your 3
calls 3
short 3
and 3
disguise 3
your 3
voice 3
a 3
bit 3
if 3
you 3
are 3
a 3
contact 3
and 3
the 3
call 3
does 3
not 3
come 3
as 3
scheduled 3
dont 3
panic 3
perhaps 3
the 3
booth 3
at 3
the 3
other 3
end 3
is 3
occupied 3
or 3
the 3

you 3
are 3
on 3

of 3

in 3
new 3

the 3

is 3
usually 3
true 3
wait 3
a 3
reasonable 3
length 3
of 3
time 3
and 3
then 3
go 3
about 3
your 3
business 3
another 3
contact 3
will 3
be 3
made 3
personal 3
rendezvous 3
should 3
take 3
place 3
at 3
places 3
that 3
are 3
not 3
movement 3
hangouts 3
or 3
heavy 3
pig 3
scenes 3
intermediaries 3
should 3
be 3
used 3
to 3
see 3
if 3
anyone 3
was 3
followed 3
just 3
groove 3
on 3
a 3
few 3
good 3
spy 3
flicks 3
and 3
youll 3
figure 3
it 3
all 3
out 3
communicating 3
to 3
masses 3
of 3
people 3
above 3
ground 3
is 3
very 3
important 3
it 3
drives 3
the 3
man 3
berserk 3
and 3
gives 3
hope 3
to 3
comrades 3
in 3
the 3
struggle 3
the 3
most 3
important 3
message 3
is 3
that 3
you 3
are 3
alive 3
in 3
good 3
spirits 3
and 3
carrying 3
on 3
the 3
struggle 3
the 3
communications 3
of 3
the 3
weathermen 3
are 3
brilliantly 3
conceived 3
develop 3
a 3
mailing 3
list 3
that 3
you 3
keep 3
well 3
hidden 3
in 3
case 3
of 3
a 3
bust 3
you 3
can 3
devise 3
a 3
system 3
of 3
mailing 3
stuff 3
in 3
envelopes 3
careful 3
of 3
fingerprints 3
inside 3
larger 3
envelopes 3
to 3
a 3
trusted 3
contact 3
who 3
will 3
mail 3
the 3
items 3
from 3
another 3
location 3
to 3
further 3
camouflage 3
your 3
area 3
of 3
operation 3
a 3
host 3
of 3
communication 3
devices 3
are 3
available 3
besides 3
handwritten 3
notes 3
and 3
typed 3
communications 3
tape 3
recorders 3
are 3
excellent 3
but 3
better 3
still 3
are 3
videotape 3
cassette 3
machines 3
you 3
can 3
wear 3
masks 3
do 3
all 3
kinds 3
of 3
weird 3
theatrical 3
stuff 3
and 3
send 3
the 3
tapes 3
to 3
television 3
stations 3
at 3
times 3
you 3
might 3
want 3
to 3
risk 3
being 3
interviewed 3
by 3
a 3
newsman 3
but 3
this 3
can 3
be 3
very 3
dangerous 3
unless 3
you 3
conceive 3
a 3
super 3
plan 3
and 3
have 3
some 3
degree 3
of 3
trust 3
in 3
the 3
word 3
of 3
the 3
journalist 3
dont 3
forget 3
a 3
grand 3

could 3
be 3
waiting 3
for 3

was 4
carrying 4
it 4
home 4
in 4
his 4
mouth 4
to 4
eat 4
it 4
in 4
peace 4
now 4
on 4
his 4
way 4
home 4
he 4
had 4
to 4
cross 4
a 4
plank 4
lying 4
across 4
a 4
running 4
brook 4
as 4
he 4
crossed 4
he 4
looked 4
down 4
and 4
saw 4
his 4
own 4
shadow 4
reflected 4
in 4
the 4
water 4
beneath 4
thinking 4
it 4
was 4
another 4
dog 4
with 4
another 4
piece 4
of 4
meat 4
he 4
made 4
up 4
his 4
mind 4
to 4
have 4
that 4
also 4
so 4
he 4
made 4
a 4
snap 4
at 4
the 4
shadow 4
in 4
the 4
water 4
but 4
as 4
he 4
opened 4
his 4
mouth 4
the 4
piece 4
of 4
meat 4
fell 4
out 4
dropped 4
into 4
the 4
water 4
and 4
was 4
never 4
seen 4
more 4
beware 4
lest 4
you 4
lose 4
the 4
substance 4
by 4
grasping 4
at 4
the 4
shadow 4
the 4
lions 4
share 4
the 4
lion 4
went 4
once 4
ahunting 4
along 4
with 4
the 4
fox 4
the 4
jackal 4
and 4
the 4
wolf 4
they 4
hunted 4
and 4
they 4
hunted 4
till 4
at 4
last 4
they 4
surprised 4
a 4
stag 4
and 4
soon 4
took 4
its 4
life 4
then 4
came 4
the 4
question 4
how 4
the 4
spoil 4
should 4
be 4
divided 4
quarter 4
me 4
this 4
stag 4
roared 4
the 4
lion 4
so 4
the 4
other 4
animals 4
skinned 4
it 4
and 4
cut 4
it 4
into 4
four 4
parts 4
then 4
the 4
lion 4
took 4
his 4
stand 4
in 4
front 4
of 4
the 4
carcass 4
and 4
pronounced 4
judgment 4
the 4
first 4
quarter 4
is 4
for 4
me 4
in 4
my 4
capacity 4
as 4
king 4
of 4
beasts 4
the 4
second 4
is 4
mine 4
as 4
arbiter 4
another 4
share 4
comes 4
to 4
me 4
for 4
my 4
part 4
in 4
the 4
chase 4
and 4
as 4
for 4
the 4
fourth 4
quarter 4
well 4
as 4
for 4
that 4
i 4
should 4
like 4
to 4
see 4
which 4
of 4
you 4
will 4
dare 4
to 4
lay 4
a 4
paw 4
upon 4
it 4
humph 4
grumbled 4
the 4
fox 4
as 4
he 4
walked 4
away 4
with 4
his 4
tail 4
between 4
his 4
legs 4
but 4
he 4
spoke 4
in 4
a 4
low 4
growl 4
you 4
may 4
share 4
the 4
labours 4
of 4
the 4
great 4
but 4
you 4
will 4
not 4
share 4
the 4
spoil 4
the 4
wolf 4
and 4
the 4
crane 4
a 4
wolf 4
had 4
been 4
gorging 4
on 4
an 4
animal 4
he 4
had 4
killed 4
when 4
suddenly 4
a 4
small 4
bone 4
in 4
the 4
meat 4
stuck 4
in 4
his 4
throat 4
and 4
he 4
could 4
not 4
swallow 4
it 4
he 4
soon 4
felt 4
terrible 4
pain 4
in 4
his 4
throat 4
and 4
ran 4
up 4
and 4
down 4
groaning 4
and 4
groaning 4
and 4
seeking 4
for 4
something 4
to 4
relieve 4
the 4
pain 4
he 4
tried 4
to 4
induce 4
every 4
one 4
he 4
met 4
to 4
remove 4
the 4
bone 4
i 4
would 4
give 4
anything 4
said 4
he 4
if 4
you 4
would 4
take 4
it 4
out 4
at 4
last 4
the 4
crane 4
agreed 4
to 4
try 4
and 4
told 4
the 4
wolf 4
to 4
lie 4
on 4
his 4
side 4
and 4
open 4
his 4
jaws 4
as 4
wide 4
as 4
he 4
could 4
then 4
the 4
crane 4
put 4
its 4
long 4
neck 4
down 4
the 4
wolfs 4
throat 4
and 4
with 4
its 4
beak 4
loosened 4
the 4
bone 4
till 4
at 4
last 4
it 4
got 4
it 4
out 4
will 4
you 4
kindly 4
give 4
me 4
the 4
reward 4
you 4
promised 4
said 4
the 4
crane 4
the 4
wolf 4
grinned 4
and 4
showed 4
his 4
teeth 4
and 4
said 4
be 4
content 4
you 4
have 4
put 4
your 4
head 4
inside 4
a 4
wolfs 4
mouth 4
and 4
taken 4
it 4
out 4
again 4
in 4
safety 4
that 4
ought 4
to 4
be 4
reward 4
enough 4
for 4
you 4
gratitude 4
and 4
greed 4
go 4
not 4
together 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
the 4
serpent 4
a 4
countrymans 4
son 4
by 4
accident 4
trod 4
upon 4
a 4
serpents 4
tail 4
which 4
turned 4
and 4
bit 4
him 4
so 4
that 4
he 4
died 4
the 4
father 4
in 4
a 4
rage 4
got 4
his 4
axe 4
and 4
pursuing 4
the 4
serpent 4
cut 4
off 4
part 4
of 4
its 4
tail 4
so 4
the 4
serpent 4
in 4
revenge 4
began 4
stinging 4
several 4
of 4
the 4
farmers 4
cattle 4
and 4
caused 4
him 4
severe 4
loss 4
well 4
the 4
farmer 4
thought 4
it 4
best 4
to 4
make 4
it 4
up 4
with 4
the 4
serpent 4
and 4
brought 4
food 4
and 4
honey 4
to 4
the 4
mouth 4
of 4
its 4
lair 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
it 4
lets 4
forget 4
and 4
forgive 4
perhaps 4
you 4
were 4
right 4
to 4
punish 4
my 4
son 4
and 4
take 4
vengeance 4
on 4
my 4
cattle 4
but 4
surely 4
i 4
was 4
right 4
in 4
trying 4
to 4
revenge 4
him 4
now 4
that 4
we 4
are 4
both 4
satisfied 4
why 4
should 4
not 4
we 4
be 4
friends 4
again 4
no 4
no 4
said 4
the 4
serpent 4
take 4
away 4
your 4
gifts 4
you 4
can 4
never 4
forget 4
the 4
death 4
of 4
your 4
son 4
nor 4
i 4
the 4
loss 4
of 4
my 4
tail 4
injuries 4
may 4
be 4
forgiven 4
but 4
not 4
forgotten 4
the 4
town 4
mouse 4
and 4
the 4
country 4
mouse 4
now 4
you 4
must 4
know 4
that 4
a 4
town 4
mouse 4
once 4
upon 4
a 4
time 4
went 4
on 4
a 4
visit 4
to 4
his 4
cousin 4
in 4
the 4
country 4
he 4
was 4
rough 4
and 4
ready 4
this 4
cousin 4
but 4
he 4
loved 4
his 4
town 4

and 4
made 4
him 4
heartily 4
welcome 4
beans 4
and 4
bacon 4
cheese 4
and 4
bread 4
were 4
all 4

to 4
offer 4
but 4
he 4
offered 4
them 4
freely 4
the 4
town 4
mouse 4
rather 4
turned 4
up 4
his 4
long 4
nose 4
at 4
this 4
country 4
fare 4
and 4
said 4

poor 4
food 4
as 4
this 4
but 4

the 4

the 4
moment 4
she 4
opened 4
her 4

the 4
piece 4
of 4

up 4
by 4

not 4
trust 4
flatterers 4
the 4
sick 4
lion 4
a 4
lion 4
had 4
come 4
to 4
the 4
end 4
of 4
his 4
days 4
and 4
lay 4
sick 4
unto 4
death 4
at 4
the 4
mouth 4
of 4
his 4
cave 4
gasping 4
for 4
breath 4
the 4
animals 4
his 4
subjects 4
came 4
round 4
him 4
and 4
drew 4
nearer 4
as 4
he 4
grew 4
more 4
and 4
more 4
helpless 4
when 4
they 4
saw 4
him 4
on 4
the 4
point 4
of 4
death 4
they 4
thought 4
to 4
themselves 4
now 4
is 4
the 4
time 4
to 4
pay 4
off 4
old 4
grudges 4
so 4
the 4
boar 4
came 4
up 4
and 4
drove 4
at 4
him 4
with 4
his 4
tusks 4
then 4
a 4
bull 4
gored 4
him 4
with 4
his 4
horns 4
still 4
the 4
lion 4
lay 4
helpless 4
before 4
them 4
so 4
the 4
ass 4
feeling 4
quite 4
safe 4
from 4
danger 4
came 4
up 4
and 4
turning 4
his 4
tail 4
to 4
the 4
lion 4
kicked 4
up 4
his 4
heels 4
into 4
his 4
face 4
this 4
is 4
a 4
double 4
death 4
growled 4
the 4
lion 4
only 4
cowards 4
insult 4
dying 4
majesty 4
the 4
ass 4
and 4
the 4
lapdog 4
a 4
farmer 4
one 4
day 4
came 4
to 4
the 4
stables 4
to 4
see 4
to 4
his 4
beasts 4
of 4
burden 4
among 4
them 4
was 4
his 4
favourite 4
ass 4
that 4
was 4
always 4
well 4
fed 4
and 4
often 4
carried 4
his 4
master 4
with 4
the 4
farmer 4
came 4
his 4
lapdog 4
who 4
danced 4
about 4
and 4
licked 4
his 4
hand 4
and 4
frisked 4
about 4
as 4
happy 4
as 4
could 4
be 4
the 4
farmer 4
felt 4
in 4
his 4
pocket 4
gave 4
the 4
lapdog 4
some 4
dainty 4
food 4
and 4
sat 4
down 4
while 4
he 4
gave 4
his 4
orders 4
to 4
his 4
servants 4
the 4
lapdog 4
jumped 4
into 4
his 4
masters 4
lap 4
and 4
lay 4
there 4
blinking 4
while 4
the 4
farmer 4
stroked 4
his 4
ears 4
the 4
ass 4
seeing 4
this 4
broke 4
loose 4
from 4
his 4
halter 4
and 4
commenced 4
prancing 4
about 4
in 4
imitation 4
of 4
the 4
lapdog 4
the 4
farmer 4
could 4
not 4
hold 4
his 4
sides 4
with 4
laughter 4
so 4
the 4
ass 4
went 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
and 4
putting 4
his 4
feet 4
upon 4
the 4
farmers 4
shoulder 4
attempted 4
to 4
climb 4
into 4
his 4
lap 4
the 4
farmers 4
servants 4
rushed 4
up 4
with 4
sticks 4
and 4
pitchforks 4
and 4
soon 4
taught 4
the 4
ass 4
that 4
clumsy 4
jesting 4
is 4
no 4
joke 4
the 4
lion 4
and 4
the 4
mouse 4
once 4
when 4
a 4
lion 4
was 4
asleep 4
a 4
little 4
mouse 4
began 4
running 4
up 4
and 4
down 4
upon 4
him 4
this 4
soon 4
wakened 4
the 4
lion 4
who 4
placed 4
his 4
huge 4
paw 4
upon 4
him 4
and 4
opened 4
his 4
big 4
jaws 4
to 4
swallow 4
him 4
pardon 4
o 4
king 4
cried 4
the 4
little 4
mouse 4
forgive 4
me 4
this 4
time 4
i 4
shall 4
never 4
forget 4
it 4
who 4
knows 4
but 4
what 4
i 4
may 4
be 4
able 4
to 4
do 4
you 4
a 4
turn 4
some 4
of 4
these 4
days 4
the 4
lion 4
was 4
so 4
tickled 4
at 4
the 4
idea 4
of 4
the 4
mouse 4
being 4
able 4
to 4
help 4
him 4
that 4
he 4
lifted 4
up 4
his 4
paw 4
and 4
let 4
him 4
go 4
some 4
time 4
after 4
the 4
lion 4
was 4
caught 4
in 4
a 4
trap 4
and 4
the 4
hunters 4
who 4
desired 4
to 4
carry 4
him 4
alive 4
to 4
the 4
king 4
tied 4
him 4
to 4
a 4
tree 4
while 4
they 4
went 4
in 4
search 4
of 4
a 4
waggon 4
to 4
carry 4
him 4
on 4
just 4
then 4
the 4
little 4
mouse 4
happened 4
to 4
pass 4
by 4
and 4
seeing 4
the 4
sad 4
plight 4
in 4
which 4
the 4
lion 4
was 4
went 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
and 4
soon 4
gnawed 4
away 4
the 4
ropes 4
that 4
bound 4
the 4
king 4
of 4
the 4
beasts 4
was 4
i 4
not 4
right 4
said 4
the 4
little 4
mouse 4
little 4
friends 4
may 4
prove 4
great 4
friends 4
the 4
swallow 4
and 4
the 4
other 4
birds 4
it 4
happened 4
that 4
a 4
countryman 4
was 4
sowing 4
some 4
hemp 4
seeds 4
in 4
a 4
field 4
where 4
a 4
swallow 4
and 4
some 4
other 4
birds 4
were 4
hopping 4
about 4
picking 4
up 4
their 4
food 4
beware 4
of 4
that 4
man 4
quoth 4
the 4
swallow 4
why 4
what 4
is 4
he 4
doing 4
said 4
the 4
others 4
that 4
is 4
hemp 4

is 4
sowing 4
be 4
careful 4
to 4
pick 4
up 4
every 4
one 4
of 4
the 4
seeds 4
or 4
else 4
you 4
will 4
repent 4
it 4
the 4
birds 4
paid 4
no 4
heed 4
to 4
the 4
swallows 4
words 4
and 4
by 4
and 4
by 4
the 4
hemp 4
grew 4
up 4
and 4
was 4
made 4
into 4
cord 4
and 4
of 4
the 4
cords 4
nets 4
were 4
made 4
and 4
many 4
a 4
bird 4
that 4
had 4
despised 4
the 4
swallows 4
advice 4
was 4
caught 4
in 4
nets 4
made 4
out 4
of 4
that 4
very 4
hemp 4
what 4
did 4
i 4
tell 4
you 4
said 4
the 4
swallow 4
destroy 4
the 4
seed 4
of 4
evil 4
or 4
it 4
will 4
grow 4
up 4
to 4
your 4
ruin 4
the 4
frogs 4
desiring 4
a 4
king 4
the 4
frogs 4
were 4
living 4
as 4
happy 4
as 4
could 4
be 4
in 4
a 4
marshy 4
swamp 4
that 4
just 4
suited 4
them 4
they 4
went 4
splashing 4
about 4
caring 4
for 4
nobody 4
and 4
nobody 4
troubling 4
with 4
them 4
but 4
some 4
of 4
them 4
thought 4
that 4
this 4
was 4
not 4
right 4
that 4
they 4
should 4
have 4
a 4
king 4
and 4
a 4
proper 4
constitution 4
so 4
they 4
determined 4
to 4
send 4
up 4
a 4
petition 4
to 4
jove 4
to 4
give 4
them 4
what 4
they 4
wanted 4
mighty 4
jove 4
they 4
cried 4
send 4
unto 4
us 4
a 4
king 4
that 4
will 4
rule 4
over 4
us 4
and 4
keep 4
us 4
in 4
order 4
jove 4
laughed 4
at 4
their 4
croaking 4
and 4
threw 4
down 4
into 4
the 4
swamp 4
a 4
huge 4
log 4
which 4
came 4
downrplashto 4
the 4
swamp 4
the 4
frogs 4
were 4
frightened 4
out 4
of 4
their 4
lives 4
by 4
the 4
commotion 4
made 4
in 4
their 4
midst 4
and 4
all 4
rushed 4
to 4
the 4
bank 4
to 4
look 4
at 4
the 4
horrible 4
monster 4
but 4
after 4
a 4
time 4
seeing 4
that 4
it 4
did 4
not 4
move 4
one 4
or 4
two 4
of 4
the 4
boldest 4
of 4
them 4
ventured 4
out 4
towards 4
the 4
log 4
and 4
even 4
dared 4
to 4
touch 4
it 4
still 4
it 4
did 4
not 4
move 4
then 4
the 4
greatest 4
hero 4
of 4
the 4
frogs 4
jumped 4
upon 4
the 4
log 4
and 4
commenced 4
dancing 4
up 4
and 4
down 4
upon 4
it 4
thereupon 4
all 4
the 4
frogs 4
came 4
and 4
did 4
the 4
same 4
and 4
for 4
some 4
time 4
the 4
frogs 4
went 4
about 4
their 4
business 4
every 4
day 4
without 4
taking 4
the 4
slightest 4
notice 4
of 4
their 4
new 4
king 4
log 4
lying 4
in 4
their 4
midst 4
but 4
this 4
did 4
not 4
suit 4
them 4
so 4
they 4
sent 4
another 4
petition 4
to 4
jove 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
him 4
we 4
want 4
a 4
real 4
king 4
one 4
that 4
will 4
really 4
rule 4
over 4
us 4
now 4
this 4
made 4
jove 4
angry 4
so 4
he 4
sent 4
among 4
them 4
a 4
big 4
stork 4
that 4
soon 4
set 4
to 4
work 4
gobbling 4
them 4
all 4
up 4
then 4
the 4
frogs 4
repented 4
when 4
too 4
late 4
better 4
no 4
rule 4
than 4
cruel 4
rule 4
the 4
mountains 4
in 4
labour 4
one 4
day 4
the 4
countrymen 4
noticed 4
that 4
the 4
mountains 4
were 4
in 4
labour 4
smoke 4
came 4
out 4
of 4
their 4
summits 4
the 4
earth 4
was 4
quaking 4
at 4
their 4
feet 4
trees 4
were 4
crashing 4
and 4
huge 4
rocks 4
were 4
tumbling 4
they 4
felt 4
sure 4
that 4
something 4
horrible 4
was 4
going 4
to 4
happen 4
they 4
all 4
gathered 4
together 4
in 4
one 4
place 4
to 4
see 4
what 4
terrible 4
thing 4
this 4
could 4
be 4
they 4
waited 4
and 4
they 4
waited 4
but 4
nothing 4
came 4
at 4
last 4
there 4
was 4
a 4
still 4
more 4
violent 4
earthquake 4
and 4
a 4
huge 4
gap 4
appeared 4
in 4
the 4
side 4
of 4
the 4
mountains 4
they 4
all 4
fell 4
down 4
upon 4
their 4
knees 4
and 4
waited 4
at 4
last 4
and 4
at 4
last 4
a 4
teeny 4
tiny 4
mouse 4
poked 4
its 4
little 4
head 4
and 4
bristles 4
out 4
of 4
the 4
gap 4
and 4
came 4
running 4
down 4
towards 4
them 4
and 4
ever 4
after 4
they 4
used 4
to 4
say 4
much 4
outcry 4
little 4
outcome 4
the 4
hares 4
and 4
the 4
frogs 4
the 4
hares 4
were 4
so 4
persecuted 4
by 4
the 4
other 4
beasts 4
they 4
did 4
not 4
know 4
where 4
to 4
go 4
as 4
soon 4
as 4
they 4
saw 4
a 4
single 4
animal 4
approach 4
them 4
off 4
they 4
used 4
to 4
run 4
one 4
day 4
they 4
saw 4
a 4
troop 4
of 4
wild 4
horses 4
stampeding 4
about 4
and 4
in 4
quite 4
a 4
panic 4
all 4
the 4
hares 4
scuttled 4
off 4
to 4
a 4
lake 4
hard 4
by 4
determined 4
to 4
drown 4
themselves 4
rather 4
than 4
live 4
in 4
such 4
a 4
continual 4
state 4
of 4
fear 4
but 4
just 4
as 4
they 4
got 4
near 4
the 4
bank 4
of 4
the 4
lake 4
a 4
troop 4
of 4
frogs 4
frightened 4
in 4
their 4
turn 4
by 4
the 4
approach 4
of 4
the 4
hares 4
scuttled 4
off 4
and 4
jumped 4
into 4
the 4
water 4
truly 4
said 4
one 4
of 4
the 4
hares 4
things 4
are 4
not 4
so 4
bad 4
as 4
they 4
seem 4
there 4
is 4
always 4
someone 4
worse 4
off 4
than 4
yourself 4
the 4
wolf 4
and 4
the 4
kid 4
a 4
kid 4
was 4
perched 4
up 4
on 4
the 4
top 4
of 4
a 4
house 4
and 4
looking 4
down 4
saw 4
a 4
wolf 4
passing 4
under 4
him 4
immediately 4
he 4
began 4
to 4
revile 4
and 4
attack 4
his 4
enemy 4
murderer 4
and 4
thief 4
he 4
cried 4
what 4
do 4
you 4
here 4
near 4
honest 4
folks 4
houses 4
how 4
dare 4
you 4
make 4
an 4
appearance 4
where 4
your 4
vile 4
deeds 4
are 4
known 4
curse 4
away 4
my 4
young 4
friend 4
said 4
the 4
wolf 4
it 4
is 4
easy 4
to 4
be 4
brave 4
from 4
a 4
safe 4
distance 4
the 4
woodman 4
and 4
the 4
serpent 4
one 4
wintry 4
day 4
a 4
woodman 4
was 4
tramping 4
home 4
from 4
his 4
work 4
when 4
he 4
saw 4
something 4
black 4
lying 4
on 4
the 4
snow 4
when 4
he 4
came 4
closer 4
he 4
saw 4
it 4
was 4
a 4
serpent 4
to 4
all 4
appearance 4
dead 4
but 4
he 4
took 4
it 4
up 4
and 4
put 4
it 4
in 4
his 4
bosom 4
to 4
warm 4
while 4
he 4
hurried 4
home 4
as 4
soon 4
as 4
he 4
got 4
indoors 4
he 4
put 4
the 4
serpent 4
down 4
on 4
the 4
hearth 4
before 4
the 4
fire 4
the 4
children 4
watched 4
it 4
and 4
saw 4
it 4
slowly 4
come 4
to 4
life 4
again 4
then 4
one 4
of 4
them 4
stooped 4
down 4
to 4
stroke 4
it 4
but 4
the 4
serpent 4
raised 4
its 4
head 4
and 4
put 4
out 4
its 4
fangs 4
and 4
was 4
about 4
to 4
sting 4
the 4
child 4
to 4
death 4
so 4
the 4
woodman 4
seized 4
his 4
axe 4
and 4
with 4
one 4
stroke 4
cut 4
the 4
serpent 4
in 4
two 4
ah 4
said 4
he 4
no 4
gratitude 4
from 4
the 4
wicked 4
the 4
bald 4
man 4
and 4
the 4
fly 4
there 4
was 4
once 4
a 4
bald 4
man 4
who 4
sat 4
down 4
after 4
work 4
on 4
a 4
hot 4
summers 4
day 4
a 4
fly 4
came 4
up 4
and 4
kept 4
buzzing 4
about 4
his 4
bald 4
pate 4
and 4
stinging 4
him 4
from 4
time 4
to 4
time 4
the 4
man 4
aimed 4
a 4
blow 4
at 4
his 4
little 4
enemy 4
but 4
acks 4
palm 4
came 4
on 4
his 4
head 4
instead 4
again 4
the 4
fly 4
tormented 4
him 4
but 4
this 4
time 4
the 4
man 4
was 4
wiser 4
and 4
said 4
you 4
will 4
only 4
injure 4
yourself 4
if 4
you 4
take 4
notice 4
of 4
despicable 4
enemies 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
stork 4
at 4
one 4
time 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
stork 4
were 4
on 4
visiting 4
terms 4
and 4
seemed 4
very 4
good 4
friends 4
so 4
the 4
fox 4
invited 4
the 4
stork 4
to 4
dinner 4
and 4
for 4
a 4
joke 4
put 4
nothing 4
before 4
her 4
but 4
some 4
soup 4
in 4
a 4
very 4
shallow 4
dish 4
this 4
the 4
fox 4
could 4
easily 4
lap 4
up 4
but 4
the 4
stork 4
could 4
only 4
wet 4
the 4
end 4
of 4
her 4
long 4
bill 4
in 4
it 4
and 4
left 4
the 4
meal 4
as 4
hungry 4
as 4
when 4
she 4
began 4
i 4
am 4
sorry 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
the 4
soup 4
is 4
not 4
to 4
your 4
liking 4
pray 4
do 4
not 4
apologise 4
said 4
the 4
stork 4
i 4
hope 4
you 4
will 4
return 4
this 4
visit 4
and 4
come 4
and 4
dine 4
with 4
me 4
soon 4
so 4
a 4
day 4
was 4
appointed 4
when 4
the 4
fox 4
should 4
visit 4
the 4
stork 4
but 4
when 4
they 4
were 4
seated 4
at 4
table 4
all 4
that 4
was 4
for 4
their 4
dinner 4
was 4
contained 4
in 4
a 4
very 4
longnecked 4
jar 4
with 4
a 4
narrow 4
mouth 4
in 4
which 4
the 4
fox 4
could 4
not 4
insert 4
his 4
snout 4
so 4
all 4
he 4
could 4
manage 4
to 4
do 4
was 4
to 4
lick 4
the 4
outside 4
of 4
the 4
jar 4
i 4
will 4
not 4
apologise 4
for 4
the 4
dinner 4
said 4
the 4
stork 4
one 4
bad 4
turn 4
deserves 4
another 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
mask 4
a 4
fox 4
had 4
by 4
some 4
means 4
got 4
into 4
the 4
storeroom 4
of 4
a 4
theatre 4
suddenly 4
he 4
observed 4
a 4
face 4
glaring 4
down 4
on 4
him 4
and 4
began 4
to 4
be 4
very 4
frightened 4
but 4
looking 4
more 4
closely 4
he 4
found 4
it 4
was 4
only 4
a 4
mask 4
such 4
as 4
actors 4
use 4
to 4
put 4
over 4
their 4
face 4
ah 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
you 4
look 4
very 4
fine 4
it 4
is 4
a 4
pity 4
you 4
have 4
not 4
got 4
any 4
brains 4
outside 4
show 4
is 4
a 4
poor 4
substitute 4
for 4
inner 4
worth 4
the 4
jay 4
and 4
the 4
peacock 4
a 4
jay 4
venturing 4
into 4
a 4
yard 4
where 4
peacocks 4
used 4
to 4
walk 4
found 4
there 4
a 4
number 4
of 4
feathers 4
which 4
had 4
fallen 4
from 4
the 4
peacocks 4
when 4
they 4
were 4
moulting 4
he 4
tied 4
them 4
all 4
to 4
his 4
tail 4
and 4
strutted 4
down 4
towards 4
the 4
peacocks 4
when 4
he 4
came 4
near 4
them 4
they 4
soon 4
discovered 4
the 4
cheat 4
and 4
striding 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
pecked 4
at 4
him 4
and 4
plucked 4
away 4
his 4
borrowed 4
plumes 4
so 4
the 4
jay 4
could 4
do 4
no 4
better 4
than 4
go 4
back 4
to 4
the 4
other 4
jays 4
who 4
had 4
watched 4
his 4
behaviour 4
from 4
a 4
distance 4
but 4
they 4
were 4
equally 4
annoyed 4
with 4
him 4
and 4
told 4
him 4
it 4
is 4
not 4
only 4
fine 4
feathers 4
that 4
make 4
fine 4
birds 4
the 4
frog 4
and 4
the 4
ox 4
oh 4
father 4
said 4
a 4
little 4
frog 4
to 4
the 4
big 4
one 4
sitting 4
by 4
the 4
side 4
of 4
a 4
pool 4
i 4
have 4
seen 4
such 4
a 4
terrible 4
monster 4
it 4
was 4
as 4
big 4
as 4
a 4
mountain 4
with 4
horns 4
on 4
its 4
head 4
and 4
a 4
long 4
tail 4
and 4
it 4
had 4
hoofs 4
divided 4
in 4
two 4
tush 4
child 4
tush 4
said 4
the 4
old 4
frog 4
that 4
was 4
only 4
farmer 4
whites 4
ox 4
it 4
isnt 4
so 4
big 4
either 4
he 4
may 4
be 4
a 4
little 4
bit 4
taller 4
than 4
i 4
but 4
i 4
could 4
easily 4
make 4
myself 4
quite 4
as 4
broad 4
just 4
you 4
see 4
so 4
he 4
blew 4
himself 4
out 4
and 4
blew 4
himself 4
out 4
and 4
blew 4
himself 4
out 4
was 4
he 4
as 4
big 4
as 4
that 4
asked 4
he 4
oh 4
much 4
bigger 4
than 4
that 4
said 4
the 4
young 4
frog 4
again 4
the 4
old 4
one 4
blew 4
himself 4
out 4
and 4
asked 4
the 4
young 4
one 4
if 4
the 4
ox 4
was 4
as 4
big 4
as 4
that 4
bigger 4
father 4
bigger 4
was 4
the 4
reply 4
so 4
the 4
frog 4
took 4
a 4
deep 4
breath 4
and 4
blew 4
and 4
blew 4
and 4
blew 4
and 4
swelled 4
and 4
swelled 4
and 4
swelled 4
and 4
then 4
he 4
said 4
im 4
sure 4
the 4
ox 4
is 4
not 4
as 4
big 4
asbut 4
at 4
this 4
moment 4
he 4
burst 4
selfconceit 4
may 4
lead 4
to 4
selfdestruction 4
androcles 4
a 4
slave 4
named 4
androcles 4
once 4
escaped 4
from 4
his 4
master 4
and 4
fled 4
to 4
the 4
forest 4
as 4
he 4
was 4
wandering 4
about 4
there 4
he 4
came 4
upon 4
a 4
lion 4
lying 4
down 4
moaning 4
and 4
groaning 4
at 4
first 4
he 4
turned 4
to 4
flee 4
but 4
finding 4
that 4
the 4
lion 4
did 4
not 4
pursue 4
him 4
he 4
turned 4
back 4
and 4
went 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
as 4
he 4
came 4
near 4
the 4
lion 4
put 4
out 4
his 4
paw 4
which 4
was 4
all 4
swollen 4
and 4
bleeding 4
and 4
androcles 4
found 4
that 4
a 4
huge 4
thorn 4
had 4
got 4
into 4
it 4
and 4
was 4
causing 4
all 4
the 4
pain 4
he 4
pulled 4
out 4
the 4
thorn 4
and 4
bound 4
up 4
the 4
paw 4
of 4
the 4
lion 4
who 4
was 4
soon 4
able 4
to 4
rise 4
and 4
lick 4
the 4
hand 4
of 4
androcles 4
like 4
a 4
dog 4
then 4
the 4
lion 4
took 4
androcles 4
to 4
his 4
cave 4
and 4
every 4
day 4
used 4
to 4
bring 4
him 4
meat 4
from 4
which 4
to 4
live 4
but 4
shortly 4
afterwards 4
both 4
androcles 4
and 4
the 4
lion 4
were 4
captured 4
and 4
the 4
slave 4
was 4
sentenced 4
to 4
be 4
thrown 4
to 4
the 4
lion 4
after 4
the 4
latter 4
had 4
been 4
kept 4
without 4
food 4
for 4
several 4
days 4
the 4
emperor 4
and 4
all 4
his 4
court 4
came 4
to 4
see 4
the 4
spectacle 4
and 4
androcles 4
was 4
led 4
out 4
into 4
the 4
middle 4
of 4
the 4
arena 4
soon 4
the 4
lion 4
was 4
let 4
loose 4
from 4
his 4
den 4
and 4
rushed 4
bounding 4
and 4
roaring 4
towards 4
his 4
victim 4
but 4
as 4
soon 4
as 4
he 4
came 4
near 4
to 4
androcles 4
he 4
recognised 4
his 4
friend 4
and 4
fawned 4
upon 4
him 4
and 4
licked 4
his 4
hands 4
like 4
a 4
friendly 4
dog 4
the 4
emperor 4
surprised 4
at 4
this 4
summoned 4
androcles 4
to 4
him 4
who 4
told 4
him 4
the 4
whole 4
story 4
whereupon 4
the 4
slave 4
was 4
pardoned 4
and 4
freed 4
and 4
the 4
lion 4
let 4
loose 4
to 4
his 4
native 4
forest 4
gratitude 4
is 4
the 4
sign 4
of 4
noble 4
souls 4
the 4
bat 4
the 4
birds 4
and 4
the 4
beasts 4
a 4
great 4
conflict 4
was 4
about 4
to 4
come 4
off 4
between 4
the 4
birds 4
and 4
the 4
beasts 4
when 4
the 4
two 4
armies 4
were 4
collected 4
together 4
the 4
bat 4
hesitated 4
which 4
to 4
join 4
the 4
birds 4
that 4
passed 4
his 4
perch 4
said 4
come 4
with 4
us 4
but 4
he 4
said 4
i 4
am 4
a 4
beast 4
later 4
on 4
some 4
beasts 4
who 4
were 4
passing 4
underneath 4
him 4
looked 4
up 4
and 4
said 4
come 4
with 4
us 4
but 4
he 4
said 4
i 4
am 4
a 4
bird 4
luckily 4
at 4
the 4
last 4
moment 4
peace 4
was 4
made 4
and 4
no 4
battle 4
took 4
place 4
so 4
the 4
bat 4
came 4
to 4
the 4
birds 4
and 4
wished 4
to 4
join 4
in 4
the 4
rejoicings 4
but 4
they 4
all 4
turned 4
against 4
him 4
and 4
he 4
had 4
to 4
fly 4
away 4
he 4
then 4
went 4
to 4
the 4
beasts 4
but 4
soon 4
had 4
to 4
beat 4
a 4
retreat 4
or 4
else 4
they 4
would 4
have 4
torn 4
him 4
to 4
pieces 4
ah 4
said 4
the 4
bat 4
i 4
see 4
now 4
he 4
that 4
is 4
neither 4
one 4
thing 4
nor 4
the 4
other 4
has 4
no 4
friends 4
the 4
hart 4
and 4
the 4
hunter 4
the 4
hart 4
was 4
once 4
drinking 4
from 4
a 4
pool 4
and 4
admiring 4
the 4
noble 4
figure 4
he 4
made 4
there 4
ah 4
said 4
he 4
where 4
can 4
you 4
see 4
such 4
noble 4
horns 4
as 4
these 4
with 4
such 4
antlers 4
i 4
wish 4
i 4
had 4
legs 4
more 4
worthy 4
to 4
bear 4
such 4
a 4
noble 4
crown 4
it 4
is 4
a 4
pity 4
they 4
are 4
so 4
slim 4
and 4
slight 4
at 4
that 4
moment 4
a 4
hunter 4
approached 4
and 4
sent 4
an 4
arrow 4
whistling 4
after 4
him 4
away 4
bounded 4
the 4
hart 4
and 4
soon 4
by 4
the 4
aid 4
of 4
his 4
nimble 4
legs 4
was 4
nearly 4
out 4
of 4
sight 4
of 4
the 4
hunter 4
but 4
not 4
noticing 4
where 4
he 4
was 4
going 4
he 4
passed 4
under 4
some 4
trees 4
with 4
branches 4
growing 4
low 4
down 4
in 4
which 4
his 4
antlers 4
were 4
caught 4
so 4
that 4
the 4
hunter 4
had 4
time 4
to 4
come 4
up 4
alas 4
alas 4
cried 4
the 4
hart 4
we 4
often 4
despise 4
what 4
is 4
most 4
useful 4
to 4
us 4
the 4
serpent 4
and 4
the 4
file 4
a 4
serpent 4
in 4
the 4
course 4
of 4
its 4
wanderings 4
came 4
into 4
an 4
armourers 4
shop 4
as 4
he 4
glided 4
over 4
the 4
floor 4
he 4
felt 4
his 4
skin 4
pricked 4
by 4
a 4
file 4
lying 4
there 4
in 4
a 4
rage 4
he 4
turned 4
round 4
upon 4
it 4
and 4
tried 4
to 4
dart 4
his 4
fangs 4
into 4
it 4
but 4
he 4
could 4
do 4
no 4
harm 4
to 4
heavy 4
iron 4
and 4
had 4
soon 4
to 4
give 4
over 4
his 4
wrath 4
it 4
is 4
useless 4
attacking 4
the 4
insensible 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
the 4
wood 4
a 4
man 4
came 4
into 4
a 4
wood 4
one 4
day 4
with 4
an 4
axe 4
in 4
his 4
hand 4
and 4
begged 4
all 4
the 4
trees 4
to 4
give 4
him 4
a 4
small 4
branch 4
which 4
he 4
wanted 4
for 4
a 4
particular 4
purpose 4
the 4
trees 4
were 4
goodnatured 4
and 4
gave 4
him 4
one 4
of 4
their 4
branches 4
what 4
did 4
the 4
man 4
do 4
but 4
fix 4
it 4
into 4
the 4
axe 4
head 4
and 4
soon 4
set 4
to 4
work 4
cutting 4
down 4
tree 4
after 4
tree 4
then 4
the 4
trees 4
saw 4
how 4
foolish 4
they 4
had 4
been 4
in 4
giving 4
their 4
enemy 4
the 4
means 4
of 4
destroying 4
themselves 4
the 4
dog 4
and 4
the 4
wolf 4
a 4
gaunt 4
wolf 4
was 4
almost 4
dead 4
with 4
hunger 4
when 4
he 4
happened 4
to 4
meet 4
a 4
housedog 4
who 4
was 4
passing 4
by 4
ah 4
cousin 4
said 4
the 4
dog 4
i 4
knew 4
how 4
it 4
would 4
be 4
your 4
irregular 4
life 4
will 4
soon 4
be 4
the 4
ruin 4
of 4
you 4
why 4
do 4
you 4
not 4
work 4
steadily 4
as 4
i 4
do 4
and 4
get 4
your 4
food 4
regularly 4
given 4
to 4
you 4
i 4
would 4
have 4
no 4
objection 4
said 4
the 4
wolf 4
if 4
i 4
could 4
only 4
get 4
a 4
place 4
i 4
will 4
easily 4
arrange 4
that 4
for 4
you 4
said 4
the 4
dog 4
come 4
with 4
me 4
to 4
my 4
master 4
and 4
you 4
shall 4
share 4
my 4
work 4
so 4
the 4
wolf 4
and 4
the 4
dog 4
went 4
towards 4
the 4
town 4
together 4
on 4
the 4
way 4
there 4
the 4
wolf 4
noticed 4
that 4
the 4
hair 4
on 4
a 4
certain 4
part 4
of 4
the 4
dogs 4
neck 4
was 4
very 4
much 4
worn 4
away 4
so 4
he 4
asked 4
him 4
how 4
that 4
had 4
come 4
about 4
oh 4
it 4
is 4
nothing 4
said 4
the 4
dog 4
that 4
is 4
only 4
the 4
place 4
where 4
the 4
collar 4
is 4
put 4
on 4
at 4
night 4
to 4
keep 4
me 4
chained 4
up 4
it 4
chafes 4
a 4
bit 4
but 4
one 4
soon 4
gets 4
used 4
to 4
it 4
is 4
that 4
all 4
said 4
the 4
wolf 4
then 4
goodbye 4
to 4
you 4
master 4
dog 4
better 4
starve 4
free 4
than 4
be 4
a 4
fat 4
slave 4
the 4
belly 4
and 4
the 4
members 4
one 4
fine 4
day 4
it 4
occurred 4
to 4
the 4
members 4
of 4
the 4
body 4
that 4
they 4
were 4
doing 4
all 4
the 4
work 4
and 4
the 4
belly 4
was 4
having 4
all 4
the 4
food 4
so 4
they 4
held 4
a 4
meeting 4
and 4
after 4
a 4
long 4
discussion 4
decided 4
to 4
strike 4
work 4
till 4
the 4
belly 4
consented 4
to 4
take 4
its 4
proper 4
share 4
of 4
the 4
work 4
so 4
for 4
a 4
day 4
or 4
two 4
the 4
hands 4
refused 4
to 4
take 4
the 4
food 4
the 4
mouth 4
refused 4
to 4
receive 4
it 4
and 4
the 4
teeth 4
had 4
no 4
work 4
to 4
do 4
but 4
after 4
a 4
day 4
or 4
two 4
the 4
members 4
began 4
to 4
find 4
that 4
they 4
themselves 4
were 4
not 4
in 4
a 4
very 4
active 4
condition 4
the 4
hands 4
could 4
hardly 4
move 4
and 4
the 4
mouth 4
was 4
all 4
parched 4
and 4
dry 4
while 4
the 4
legs 4
were 4
unable 4
to 4
support 4
the 4
rest 4
so 4
thus 4
they 4
found 4
that 4
even 4
the 4
belly 4
in 4
its 4
dull 4
quiet 4
way 4
was 4
doing 4
necessary 4
work 4
for 4
the 4
body 4
and 4
that 4
all 4
must 4
work 4
together 4
or 4
the 4
body 4
will 4
go 4
to 4
pieces 4
the 4
hart 4
in 4
the 4
oxstall 4
a 4
hart 4
hotly 4
pursued 4
by 4
the 4
hounds 4
fled 4
for 4
refuge 4
into 4
an 4
oxstall 4
and 4
buried 4
itself 4
in 4
a 4
truss 4
of 4
hay 4
leaving 4
nothing 4
to 4
be 4
seen 4
but 4
the 4
tips 4
of 4
his 4
horns 4
soon 4
after 4
the 4
hunters 4
came 4
up 4
and 4
asked 4
if 4
any 4
one 4
had 4
seen 4
the 4
hart 4
the 4
stable 4
boys 4
who 4
had 4
been 4
resting 4
after 4
their 4
dinner 4
looked 4
round 4
but 4
could 4
see 4
nothing 4
and 4
the 4
hunters 4
went 4
away 4
shortly 4
afterwards 4
the 4
master 4
came 4
in 4
and 4
looking 4
round 4
saw 4
that 4
something 4
unusual 4
had 4
taken 4
place 4
he 4
pointed 4
to 4
the 4
truss 4
of 4
hay 4
and 4
said 4
what 4
are 4
those 4
two 4
curious 4
things 4
sticking 4
out 4
of 4
the 4
hay 4
and 4
when 4
the 4
stable 4
boys 4
came 4
to 4
look 4
they 4
discovered 4
the 4
hart 4
and 4
soon 4
made 4
an 4
end 4
of 4
him 4
he 4
thus 4
learnt 4
that 4
nothing 4
escapes 4
the 4
masters 4
eye 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
grapes 4
one 4
hot 4
summers 4
day 4
a 4
fox 4
was 4
strolling 4
through 4
an 4
orchard 4
till 4
he 4
came 4
to 4
a 4
bunch 4
of 4
grapes 4
just 4
ripening 4
on 4
a 4
vine 4
which 4
had 4
been 4
trained 4
over 4
a 4
lofty 4
branch 4
just 4
the 4
thing 4
to 4
quench 4
my 4
thirst 4
quoth 4
he 4
drawing 4
back 4
a 4
few 4
paces 4
he 4
took 4
a 4
run 4
and 4
a 4
jump 4
and 4
just 4
missed 4
the 4
bunch 4
turning 4
round 4
again 4
with 4
a 4
one 4
two 4
three 4
he 4
jumped 4
up 4
but 4
with 4
no 4
greater 4
success 4
again 4
and 4
again 4
he 4
tried 4
after 4
the 4
tempting 4
morsel 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
had 4
to 4
give 4
it 4
up 4
and 4
walked 4
away 4
with 4
his 4
nose 4
in 4
the 4
air 4
saying 4
i 4
am 4
sure 4
they 4
are 4
sour 4
it 4
is 4
easy 4
to 4
despise 4
what 4
you 4
cannot 4
get 4
the 4
horse 4
hunter 4
and 4
stag 4
a 4
quarrel 4
had 4
arisen 4
between 4
the 4
horse 4
and 4
the 4
stag 4
so 4
the 4
horse 4
came 4
to 4
a 4
hunter 4
to 4
ask 4
his 4
help 4
to 4
take 4
revenge 4
on 4
the 4
stag 4
the 4
hunter 4
agreed 4
but 4
said 4
if 4
you 4
desire 4
to 4
conquer 4
the 4
stag 4
you 4
must 4
permit 4
me 4
to 4
place 4
this 4
piece 4
of 4
iron 4
between 4
your 4
jaws 4
so 4
that 4
i 4
may 4
guide 4
you 4
with 4
these 4
reins 4
and 4
allow 4
this 4
saddle 4
to 4
be 4
placed 4
upon 4
your 4
back 4
so 4
that 4
i 4
may 4
keep 4
steady 4
upon 4
you 4
as 4
we 4
follow 4
after 4
the 4
enemy 4
the 4
horse 4
agreed 4
to 4
the 4
conditions 4
and 4
the 4
hunter 4
soon 4
saddled 4
and 4
bridled 4
him 4
then 4
with 4
the 4
aid 4
of 4
the 4
hunter 4
the 4
horse 4
soon 4
overcame 4
the 4
stag 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
the 4
hunter 4
now 4
get 4
off 4
and 4
remove 4
those 4
things 4
from 4
my 4
mouth 4
and 4
back 4
not 4
so 4
fast 4
friend 4
said 4
the 4
hunter 4
i 4
have 4
now 4
got 4
you 4
under 4
bit 4
and 4
spur 4
and 4
prefer 4
to 4
keep 4
you 4
as 4
you 4
are 4
at 4
present 4
if 4
you 4
allow 4
men 4
to 4
use 4
you 4
for 4
your 4
own 4
purposes 4
they 4
will 4
use 4
you 4
for 4
theirs 4
the 4
peacock 4
and 4
juno 4
a 4
peacock 4
once 4
placed 4
a 4
petition 4
before 4
juno 4
desiring 4
to 4
have 4
the 4
voice 4
of 4
a 4
nightingale 4
in 4
addition 4
to 4
his 4
other 4
attractions 4
but 4
juno 4
refused 4
his 4
request 4
when 4
he 4
persisted 4
and 4
pointed 4
out 4
that 4
he 4
was 4
her 4
favourite 4
bird 4
she 4
said 4
be 4
content 4
with 4
your 4
lot 4
one 4
cannot 4
be 4
first 4
in 4
everything 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
lion 4
when 4
first 4
the 4
fox 4
saw 4
the 4
lion 4
he 4
was 4
terribly 4
frightened 4
and 4
ran 4
away 4
and 4
hid 4
himself 4
in 4
the 4
wood 4
next 4
time 4
however 4
he 4
came 4
near 4
the 4
king 4
of 4
beasts 4
he 4
stopped 4
at 4
a 4
safe 4
distance 4
and 4
watched 4
him 4
pass 4
by 4
the 4
third 4
time 4
they 4
came 4
near 4
one 4
another 4
the 4
fox 4
went 4
straight 4
up 4
to 4
the 4
lion 4
and 4
passed 4
the 4
time 4
of 4
day 4
with 4
him 4
asking 4
him 4
how 4
his 4
family 4
were 4
and 4
when 4
he 4
should 4
have 4
the 4
pleasure 4
of 4
seeing 4
him 4
again 4
then 4
turning 4
his 4
tail 4
he 4
parted 4
from 4
the 4
lion 4
without 4
much 4
ceremony 4
familiarity 4
breeds 4
contempt 4
the 4
lion 4
and 4
the 4
statue 4
a 4
man 4
and 4
a 4
lion 4
were 4
discussing 4
the 4
relative 4
strength 4
of 4
men 4
and 4
lions 4
in 4
general 4
the 4
man 4
contended 4
that 4
he 4
and 4
his 4
fellows 4
were 4
stronger 4
than 4
lions 4
by 4
reason 4
of 4
their 4
greater 4
intelligence 4
come 4
now 4
with 4
me 4
he 4
cried 4
and 4
i 4
will 4
soon 4
prove 4
that 4
i 4
am 4
right 4
so 4
he 4
took 4
him 4
into 4
the 4
public 4
gardens 4
and 4
showed 4
him 4
a 4
statue 4
of 4
hercules 4
overcoming 4
the 4
lion 4
and 4
tearing 4
his 4
mouth 4
in 4
two 4
that 4
is 4
all 4
very 4
well 4
said 4
the 4
lion 4
but 4
proves 4
nothing 4
for 4
it 4
was 4
a 4
man 4
who 4
made 4
the 4
statue 4
we 4
can 4
easily 4
represent 4
things 4
as 4
we 4
wish 4
them 4
to 4
be 4
the 4
ant 4
and 4
the 4
grasshopper 4
in 4
a 4
field 4
one 4
summers 4
day 4
a 4
grasshopper 4
was 4
hopping 4
about 4
chirping 4
and 4
singing 4
to 4
its 4
hearts 4
content 4
an 4
ant 4
passed 4
by 4
bearing 4
along 4
with 4
great 4
toil 4
an 4
ear 4
of 4
corn 4
he 4
was 4
taking 4
to 4
the 4
nest 4
why 4
not 4
come 4
and 4
chat 4
with 4
me 4
said 4
the 4
grasshopper 4
instead 4
of 4
toiling 4
and 4
moiling 4
in 4
that 4
way 4
i 4
am 4
helping 4
to 4
lay 4
up 4
food 4
for 4
the 4
winter 4
said 4
the 4
ant 4
and 4
recommend 4
you 4
to 4
do 4
the 4
same 4
why 4
bother 4
about 4
winter 4
said 4
the 4
grasshopper 4
we 4
have 4
got 4
plenty 4
of 4
food 4
at 4
present 4
but 4
the 4
ant 4
went 4
on 4
its 4
way 4
and 4
continued 4
its 4
toil 4
when 4
the 4
winter 4
came 4
the 4
grasshopper 4
had 4
no 4
food 4
and 4
found 4
itself 4
dying 4
of 4
hunger 4
while 4
it 4
saw 4
the 4
ants 4
distributing 4
every 4
day 4
corn 4
and 4
grain 4
from 4
the 4
stores 4
they 4
had 4
collected 4
in 4
the 4
summer 4
then 4
the 4
grasshopper 4
knew 4
it 4
is 4
best 4
to 4
prepare 4
for 4
the 4
days 4
of 4
necessity 4
the 4
tree 4
and 4
the 4
reed 4
well 4
little 4
one 4
said 4
a 4
tree 4
to 4
a 4
reed 4
that 4
was 4
growing 4
at 4
its 4
foot 4
why 4
do 4
you 4
not 4
plant 4
your 4
feet 4
deeply 4
in 4
the 4
ground 4
and 4
raise 4
your 4
head 4
boldly 4
in 4
the 4
air 4
as 4
i 4
do 4
i 4
am 4
contented 4
with 4
my 4
lot 4
said 4
the 4
reed 4
i 4
may 4
not 4
be 4
so 4
grand 4
but 4
i 4
think 4
i 4
am 4
safer 4
safe 4
sneered 4
the 4
tree 4
who 4
shall 4
pluck 4
me 4
up 4
by 4
the 4
roots 4
or 4
bow 4
my 4
head 4
to 4
the 4
ground 4
but 4
it 4
soon 4
had 4
to 4
repent 4
of 4
its 4
boasting 4
for 4
a 4
hurricane 4
arose 4
which 4
tore 4
it 4
up 4
from 4
its 4
roots 4
and 4
cast 4
it 4
a 4
useless 4
log 4
on 4
the 4
ground 4
while 4
the 4
little 4
reed 4
bending 4
to 4
the 4
force 4
of 4
the 4
wind 4
soon 4
stood 4
upright 4
again 4
when 4
the 4
storm 4
had 4
passed 4
over 4
obscurity 4
often 4
brings 4
safety 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
cat 4
a 4
fox 4
was 4
boasting 4
to 4
a 4
cat 4
of 4
its 4
clever 4
devices 4
for 4
escaping 4
its 4
enemies 4
i 4
have 4
a 4
whole 4
bag 4
of 4
tricks 4
he 4
said 4
which 4
contains 4
a 4
hundred 4
ways 4
of 4
escaping 4
my 4
enemies 4
i 4
have 4
only 4
one 4
said 4
the 4
cat 4
but 4
i 4
can 4
generally 4
manage 4
with 4
that 4
just 4
at 4
that 4
moment 4
they 4
heard 4
the 4
cry 4
of 4
a 4
pack 4
of 4
hounds 4
coming 4
towards 4
them 4
and 4
the 4
cat 4
immediately 4
scampered 4
up 4
a 4
tree 4
and 4
hid 4
herself 4
in 4
the 4
boughs 4
this 4
is 4
my 4
plan 4
said 4
the 4
cat 4
what 4
are 4
you 4
going 4
to 4
do 4
the 4
fox 4
thought 4
first 4
of 4
one 4
way 4
then 4
of 4
another 4
and 4
while 4
he 4
was 4
debating 4
the 4
hounds 4
came 4
nearer 4
and 4
nearer 4
and 4
at 4
last 4
the 4
fox 4
in 4
his 4
confusion 4
was 4
caught 4
up 4
by 4
the 4
hounds 4
and 4
soon 4
killed 4
by 4
the 4
huntsmen 4
miss 4
puss 4
who 4
had 4
been 4
looking 4
on 4
said 4
better 4
one 4
safe 4
way 4
than 4
a 4
hundred 4
on 4
which 4
you 4
cannot 4
reckon 4
the 4
wolf 4
in 4
sheeps 4
clothing 4
a 4
wolf 4
found 4
great 4
difficulty 4
in 4
getting 4
at 4
the 4
sheep 4
owing 4
to 4
the 4
vigilance 4
of 4
the 4
shepherd 4
and 4
his 4
dogs 4
but 4
one 4
day 4
it 4
found 4
the 4
skin 4
of 4
a 4
sheep 4
that 4
had 4
been 4
flayed 4
and 4
thrown 4
aside 4
so 4
it 4
put 4
it 4
on 4
over 4
its 4
own 4
pelt 4
and 4
strolled 4
down 4
among 4
the 4
sheep 4
the 4
lamb 4
that 4
belonged 4
to 4
the 4
sheep 4
whose 4
skin 4
the 4
wolf 4
was 4
wearing 4
began 4
to 4
follow 4
the 4

soon 4
made 4
a 4
meal 4
off 4

and 4
for 4
some 4
time 4
he 4
succeeded 4
in 4

the 4

in 4
the 4
manger 4
a 4
dog 4
looking 4
out 4
for 4
its 4
afternoon 4
nap 4
jumped 4
into 4
the 4
manger 4
of 4
an 4
ox 4
and 4
lay 4
there 4
cosily 4
upon 4
the 4
straw 4
but 4
soon 4
the 4
ox 4
returning 4
from 4
its 4
afternoon 4
work 4
came 4
up 4
to 4

some 4
of 4

the 4
dog 4
in 4
a 4
rage 4
being 4
awakened 4
from 4
its 4
slumber 4
stood 4
up 4
and 4
barked 4
at 4
the 4
ox 4
and 4
whenever 4
it 4
came 4
near 4
attempted 4

to 4
give 4
up 4
the 4
hope 4
of 4
getting 4
at 4
the 4
straw 4
and 4
went 4
away 4
muttering 4
ah 4
people 4
often 4
grudge 4
others 4
what 4
they 4
cannot 4
enjoy 4
themselves 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
the 4
wooden 4
god 4
in 4
the 4
old 4
days 4
men 4
used 4
to 4
worship 4
stocks 4
and 4
stones 4
and 4
idols 4
and 4
prayed 4
to 4
them 4
to 4
give 4
them 4
luck 4
it 4
happened 4
that 4
a 4
man 4
had 4
often 4
prayed 4
to 4
a 4
wooden 4
idol 4
he 4
had 4
received 4
from 4
his 4
father 4
but 4
his 4
luck 4
never 4
seemed 4
to 4
change 4
he 4
prayed 4
and 4
he 4
prayed 4
but 4
still 4
he 4
remained 4
as 4
unlucky 4
as 4
ever 4
one 4
day 4
in 4
the 4
greatest 4
rage 4
he 4
went 4
to 4
the 4
wooden 4
god 4
and 4
with 4
one 4
blow 4
swept 4
it 4
down 4
from 4
its 4
pedestal 4
the 4
idol 4
broke 4
in 4
two 4
and 4
what 4
did 4
he 4
see 4
an 4
immense 4
number 4
of 4
coins 4
flying 4
all 4
over 4
the 4
place 4
the 4
fisher 4
a 4
fisher 4
once 4
took 4
his 4
bagpipes 4
to 4
the 4
bank 4
of 4
a 4
river 4
and 4
played 4
upon 4
them 4
with 4
the 4
hope 4
of 4
making 4
the 4
fish 4
rise 4
but 4
never 4
a 4
one 4
put 4
his 4
nose 4
out 4
of 4
the 4
water 4
so 4
he 4
cast 4
his 4
net 4
into 4
the 4
river 4
and 4
soon 4
drew 4
it 4
forth 4
filled 4
with 4
fish 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
his 4
bagpipes 4
again 4
and 4
as 4
he 4
played 4
the 4
fish 4
leapt 4
up 4
in 4
the 4
net 4
ah 4
you 4
dance 4
now 4
when 4
i 4
play 4
said 4
he 4
yes 4
said 4
an 4
old 4
fish 4
when 4
you 4
are 4
in 4
a 4
mans 4
power 4
you 4
must 4
do 4
as 4
he 4
bids 4
you 4
the 4
shepherds 4
boy 4
there 4
was 4
once 4
a 4
young 4
shepherd 4
boy 4
who 4
tended 4
his 4
sheep 4
at 4
the 4
foot 4
of 4
a 4
mountain 4
near 4
a 4
dark 4
forest 4
it 4
was 4
rather 4
lonely 4
for 4
him 4
all 4
day 4
so 4
he 4
thought 4
upon 4
a 4
plan 4
by 4
which 4
he 4
could 4
get 4
a 4
little 4
company 4
and 4
some 4
excitement 4
he 4
rushed 4
down 4
towards 4
the 4
village 4
calling 4
out 4
wolf 4
wolf 4
and 4
the 4
villagers 4
came 4
out 4
to 4
meet 4
him 4
and 4
some 4
of 4
them 4
stopped 4
with 4
him 4
for 4
a 4
considerable 4
time 4
this 4
pleased 4
the 4
boy 4
so 4
much 4
that 4
a 4
few 4
days 4
afterwards 4
he 4
tried 4
the 4
same 4
trick 4
and 4
again 4
the 4
villagers 4
came 4
to 4
his 4
help 4
but 4
shortly 4
after 4
this 4
a 4
wolf 4
actually 4
did 4
come 4
out 4
from 4
the 4
forest 4
and 4
began 4
to 4
worry 4
the 4
sheep 4
and 4
the 4
boy 4
of 4
course 4
cried 4
out 4
wolf 4
wolf 4
still 4
louder 4
than 4
before 4
but 4
this 4
time 4
the 4
villagers 4
who 4
had 4
been 4
fooled 4
twice 4
before 4
thought 4
the 4
boy 4
was 4
again 4
deceiving 4
them 4
and 4
nobody 4
stirred 4
to 4
come 4
to 4
his 4
help 4
so 4
the 4
wolf 4
made 4
a 4
good 4
meal 4
off 4
the 4
boys 4
flock 4
and 4
when 4
the 4
boy 4
complained 4
the 4
wise 4
man 4
of 4
the 4
village 4
said 4
a 4
liar 4
will 4
not 4
be 4
believed 4
even 4
when 4
he 4
speaks 4
the 4
truth 4
the 4
young 4
thief 4
and 4
his 4
mother 4
a 4
young 4
man 4
had 4
been 4
caught 4
in 4
a 4
daring 4
act 4
of 4
theft 4
and 4
had 4
been 4
condemned 4
to 4
be 4
executed 4
for 4
it 4
he 4
expressed 4
his 4
desire 4
to 4
see 4
his 4
mother 4
and 4
to 4
speak 4
with 4
her 4
before 4
he 4
was 4
led 4
to 4
execution 4
and 4
of 4
course 4
this 4
was 4
granted 4
when 4
his 4
mother 4
came 4
to 4
him 4
he 4
said 4
i 4
want 4
to 4
whisper 4
to 4
you 4
and 4
when 4
she 4
brought 4
her 4
ear 4
near 4
him 4
he 4
nearly 4
bit 4
it 4
off 4
all 4
the 4
bystanders 4
were 4
horrified 4
and 4
asked 4
him 4
what 4
he 4
could 4
mean 4
by 4
such 4
brutal 4
and 4
inhuman 4
conduct 4
it 4
is 4
to 4
punish 4
her 4
he 4
said 4
when 4
i 4
was 4
young 4
i 4
began 4
with 4
stealing 4
little 4
things 4
and 4
brought 4
them 4
home 4
to 4
mother 4
instead 4
of 4
rebuking 4
and 4
punishing 4
me 4
she 4
laughed 4
and 4
said 4
it 4
will 4
not 4
be 4
noticed 4
it 4
is 4
because 4
of 4
her 4
that 4
i 4
am 4
here 4
today 4
he 4
is 4
right 4
woman 4
said 4
the 4
priest 4
the 4
lord 4
hath 4
said 4
train 4
up 4
a 4
child 4
in 4
the 4
way 4
he 4
should 4
go 4
and 4
when 4
he 4
is 4
old 4
he 4
will 4
not 4
depart 4
therefrom 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
his 4
two 4
wives 4
in 4
the 4
old 4
days 4
when 4
men 4
were 4
allowed 4
to 4
have 4
many 4
wives 4
a 4
middleaged 4
man 4
had 4
one 4
wife 4
that 4
was 4
old 4
and 4
one 4
that 4
was 4
young 4
each 4
loved 4
him 4
very 4
much 4
and 4
desired 4
to 4
see 4
him 4
like 4
herself 4
now 4
the 4
mans 4
hair 4
was 4
turning 4
grey 4
which 4
the 4
young 4
wife 4
did 4
not 4
like 4
as 4
it 4
made 4
him 4
look 4
too 4
old 4
for 4
her 4
husband 4
so 4
every 4
night 4
she 4
used 4
to 4
comb 4
his 4
hair 4
and 4
pick 4
out 4
the 4
white 4
ones 4
but 4
the 4
elder 4
wife 4
saw 4
her 4
husband 4
growing 4
grey 4
with 4
great 4
pleasure 4
for 4
she 4
did 4
not 4
like 4
to 4
be 4
mistaken 4
for 4
his 4
mother 4
so 4
every 4
morning 4
she 4
used 4
to 4
arrange 4
his 4
hair 4
and 4
pick 4
out 4
as 4
many 4
of 4
the 4
black 4
ones 4
as 4
she 4
could 4
the 4
consequence 4
was 4
the 4
man 4
soon 4
found 4
himself 4
entirely 4
bald 4
yield 4
to 4
all 4
and 4
you 4
will 4
soon 4
have 4
nothing 4
to 4
yield 4
the 4
nurse 4
and 4
the 4
wolf 4
be 4
quiet 4
now 4
said 4
an 4
old 4
nurse 4
to 4
a 4
child 4
sitting 4
on 4
her 4
lap 4
if 4
you 4
make 4
that 4
noise 4
again 4
i 4
will 4
throw 4
you 4
to 4
the 4
wolf 4
now 4
it 4
chanced 4
that 4
a 4
wolf 4
was 4
passing 4
close 4
under 4
the 4
window 4
as 4
this 4
was 4
said 4
so 4
he 4
crouched 4
down 4
by 4
the 4
side 4
of 4
the 4
house 4
and 4
waited 4
i 4

thought 4
he 4
it 4
is 4

and 4
a 4
daintier 4
morsel 4
i 4
havent 4
had 4
for 4
many 4
a 4
long 4
day 4
so 4
he 4
waited 4
and 4
he 4
waited 4
and 4
he 4
waited 4
till 4
at 4
last 4
the 4
child 4
began 4
to 4
cry 4
and 4
the 4
wolf 4
came 4
forward 4
before 4
the 4
window 4
and 4
looked 4
up 4
to 4
the 4
nurse 4
wagging 4
his 4
tail 4
but 4
all 4
the 4
nurse 4
did 4
was 4
to 4
shut 4
down 4
the 4
window 4
and 4
call 4
for 4
help 4
and 4
the 4
dogs 4
of 4
the 4
house 4
came 4
rushing 4
out 4
ah 4
said 4
the 4
wolf 4
as 4
he 4
galloped 4
away 4
enemies 4
promises 4
were 4
made 4
to 4
be 4

the 4
birds 4
a 4
tortoise 4
desired 4
to 4
change 4
its 4
place 4
of 4
residence 4
so 4
he 4
asked 4
an 4
eagle 4
to 4
carry 4
him 4
to 4
his 4
new 4
home 4
promising 4
her 4
a 4
rich 4
reward 4
for 4
her 4
trouble 4
the 4
eagle 4
agreed 4
and 4
seizing 4
the 4
tortoise 4
by 4
the 4
shell 4
with 4
her 4
talons 4
soared 4
aloft 4
on 4
their 4
way 4
they 4
met 4
a 4
crow 4
who 4
said 4

the 4
eagle 4

good 4
eating 4
the 4

child 4
said 4
the 4
mother 4

he 4
was 4
a 4

in 4
his 4
delight 4
he 4
lifted 4
up 4

then 4
every 4

his 4

himself 4
among 4
the 4
leaves 4
the 4
other 4
seeing 4
no 4
help 4
for 4
it 4
threw 4
himself 4
flat 4
down 4
upon 4
the 4
ground 4
with 4
his 4
face 4
in 4
the 4
dust 4
the 4
bear 4
coming 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
put 4
his 4
muzzle 4
close 4
to 4
his 4
ear 4
and 4
sniffed 4
and 4
sniffed 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
with 4
a 4
growl 4
he 4
shook 4
his 4
head 4
and 4
slouched 4
off 4
for 4
bears 4
will 4
not 4
touch 4
dead 4
meat 4
then 4
the 4
fellow 4
in 4
the 4
tree 4
came 4
down 4
to 4
his 4
comrade 4
and 4
laughing 4
said 4
what 4
was 4
it 4
that 4
master 4
bruin 4
whispered 4
to 4
you 4
he 4
told 4
me 4
said 4
the 4
other 4

trust 4
a 4
friend 4
who 4
deserts 4
you 4
at 4
a 4
pinch 4
the 4
two 4
pots 4
two 4
pots 4

been 4
left 4
on 4
the 4
bank 4
of 4
a 4
river 4
one 4
of 4
brass 4
and 4
one 4
of 4
earthenware 4
when 4
the 4
tide 4
rose 4
they 4
both 4
floated 4
off 4
down 4
the 4
stream 4
now 4
the 4
earthenware 4
pot 4
tried 4
its 4
best 4
to 4
keep 4
aloof 4
from 4
the 4
brass 4
one 4
which 4
cried 4

the 4
other 4

company 4
the 4
four 4
oxen 4
and 4
the 4
lion 4
a 4
lion 4
used 4
to 4
prowl 4
about 4
a 4
field 4
in 4
which 4
four 4
oxen 4
used 4
to 4
dwell 4
many 4
a 4
time 4
he 4
tried 4
to 4
attack 4
them 4
but 4
whenever 4
he 4
came 4
near 4
they 4
turned 4
their 4
tails 4
to 4
one 4
another 4
so 4
that 4
whichever 4
way 4
he 4
approached 4
them 4
he 4
was 4
met 4
by 4
the 4
horns 4
of 4
one 4
of 4
them 4
at 4
last 4
however 4
they 4
fell 4
aquarrelling 4
among 4
themselves 4
and 4
each 4
went 4
off 4
to 4
pasture 4
alone 4
in 4
a 4
separate 4
corner 4
of 4
the 4
field 4
then 4
the 4
lion 4
attacked 4
them 4
one 4
by 4
one 4
and 4
soon 4
made 4
an 4
end 4
of 4
all 4
four 4
united 4
we 4
stand 4
divided 4

you 4
hereafter 4
a 4
little 4
thing 4
in 4
hand 4
is 4
worth 4
more 4
than 4
a 4
great 4
thing 4
in 4
prospect 4
avaricious 4
and 4
envious 4
two 4
neighbours 4
came 4
before 4
jupiter 4
and 4
prayed 4
him 4
to 4
grant 4
their 4
hearts 4
desire 4
now 4
the 4
one 4
was 4
full 4
of 4
avarice 4
and 4
the 4
other 4
eaten 4
up 4
with 4
envy 4
so 4
to 4
punish 4
them 4
both 4
jupiter 4
granted 4
that 4
each 4
might 4
have 4
whatever 4
he 4
wished 4
for 4
himself 4
but 4
only 4
on 4
condition 4
that 4
his 4
neighbour 4
had 4
twice 4
as 4
much 4
the 4
avaricious 4
man 4
prayed 4
to 4
have 4
a 4
room 4
full 4
of 4
gold 4
no 4
sooner 4
said 4
than 4
done 4
but 4
all 4
his 4
joy 4
was 4
turned 4
to 4
grief 4
when 4
he 4
found 4
that 4
his 4
neighbour 4
had 4
two 4
rooms 4
full 4
of 4
the 4
precious 4
metal 4
then 4
came 4
the 4
turn 4
of 4
the 4
envious 4
man 4
who 4
could 4
not 4
bear 4
to 4
think 4
that 4
his 4
neighbour 4
had 4
any 4
joy 4
at 4
all 4
so 4
he 4
prayed 4
that 4
he 4
might 4
have 4
one 4
of 4
his 4
own 4
eyes 4
put 4
out 4
by 4
which 4
means 4
his 4
companion 4
would 4
become 4
totally 4
blind 4
vices 4
are 4
their 4
own 4
punishment 4
the 4
crow 4
and 4
the 4
pitcher 4
a 4
crow 4
halfdead 4
with 4
thirst 4
came 4
upon 4
a 4
pitcher 4
which 4
had 4
once 4
been 4
full 4
of 4
water 4
but 4
when 4
the 4
crow 4
put 4
its 4
beak 4
into 4
the 4
mouth 4
of 4
the 4
pitcher 4
he 4
found 4
that 4
only 4
very 4
little 4
water 4
was 4
left 4
in 4
it 4
and 4
that 4
he 4
could 4
not 4
reach 4
far 4
enough 4
down 4
to 4
get 4
at 4
it 4
he 4
tried 4
and 4
he 4
tried 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
had 4
to 4
give 4
up 4
in 4
despair 4
then 4
a 4
thought 4
came 4
to 4
him 4
and 4
he 4
took 4
a 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
it 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
another 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
it 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
another 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
that 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
another 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
that 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
another 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
that 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
then 4
he 4
took 4
another 4
pebble 4
and 4
dropped 4
that 4
into 4
the 4
pitcher 4
at 4
last 4
at 4
last 4
he 4
saw 4
the 4
water 4
mount 4
up 4
near 4
him 4
and 4
after 4
casting 4
in 4
a 4
few 4
more 4
pebbles 4
he 4
was 4
able 4
to 4
quench 4
his 4
thirst 4
and 4
save 4
his 4
life 4
little 4
by 4
little 4
does 4
the 4
trick 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
the 4
satyr 4
a 4
man 4
had 4
lost 4
his 4
way 4
in 4
a 4
wood 4
one 4
bitter 4
winters 4
night 4
as 4
he 4
was 4
roaming 4
about 4
a 4
satyr 4
came 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
and 4
finding 4
that 4
he 4
had 4
lost 4
his 4
way 4
promised 4
to 4
give 4
him 4
a 4
lodging 4
for 4
the 4
night 4
and 4
guide 4
him 4
out 4
of 4
the 4
forest 4
in 4
the 4
morning 4
as 4
he 4
went 4
along 4
to 4
the 4
satyrs 4
cell 4
the 4
man 4
raised 4
both 4
his 4
hands 4
to 4
his 4
mouth 4
and 4
kept 4
on 4
blowing 4
at 4
them 4
what 4
do 4
you 4
do 4
that 4
for 4
said 4
the 4
satyr 4
my 4
hands 4
are 4
numb 4
with 4
the 4
cold 4
said 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
my 4
breath 4
warms 4
them 4
after 4
this 4
they 4
arrived 4
at 4
the 4
satyrs 4
home 4
and 4
soon 4
the 4
satyr 4
put 4
a 4
smoking 4
dish 4
of 4
porridge 4
before 4
him 4
but 4
when 4
the 4
man 4
raised 4
his 4
spoon 4
to 4
his 4
mouth 4
he 4
began 4
blowing 4
upon 4
it 4
and 4
what 4
do 4
you 4
do 4
that 4
for 4
said 4
the 4
satyr 4
the 4
porridge 4
is 4
too 4
hot 4
and 4
my 4
breath 4
will 4
cool 4
it 4
out 4
you 4
go 4
said 4
the 4
satyr 4
i 4
will 4
have 4
nought 4
to 4
do 4
with 4
a 4
man 4
who 4
can 4
blow 4
hot 4
and 4
cold 4
with 4
the 4
same 4
breath 4
the 4
goose 4
with 4
the 4
golden 4
eggs 4
one 4
day 4
a 4
countryman 4
going 4
to 4
the 4
nest 4
of 4
his 4
goose 4
found 4
there 4
an 4
egg 4
all 4
yellow 4
and 4
glittering 4
when 4
he 4
took 4
it 4
up 4
it 4
was 4
as 4
heavy 4
as 4
lead 4
and 4
he 4
was 4
going 4
to 4
throw 4
it 4
away 4
because 4
he 4
thought 4
a 4
trick 4
had 4
been 4
played 4
upon 4
him 4
but 4
he 4
took 4
it 4
home 4
on 4
second 4
thoughts 4
and 4
soon 4
found 4
to 4
his 4
delight 4
that 4
it 4
was 4
an 4
egg 4
of 4
pure 4
gold 4
every 4
morning 4
the 4
same 4
thing 4
occurred 4
and 4
he 4
soon 4
became 4
rich 4
by 4
selling 4
his 4
eggs 4
as 4
he 4
grew 4
rich 4
he 4
grew 4
greedy 4
and 4
thinking 4
to 4
get 4
at 4
once 4
all 4
the 4
gold 4
the 4
goose 4
could 4
give 4
he 4
killed 4
it 4
and 4
opened 4
it 4
only 4
to 4
find 4
nothing 4
greed 4
oft 4
oer 4
reaches 4
itself 4
the 4
labourer 4
and 4
the 4
nightingale 4
a 4
labourer 4
lay 4
listening 4
to 4
a 4
nightingales 4
song 4
throughout 4
the 4
summer 4
night 4
so 4
pleased 4
was 4
he 4
with 4
it 4
that 4
the 4
next 4
night 4
he 4
set 4
a 4
trap 4
for 4
it 4
and 4
captured 4
it 4
now 4
that 4
i 4
have 4
caught 4
thee 4
he 4
cried 4
thou 4
shalt 4
always 4
sing 4
to 4
me 4
we 4
nightingales 4
never 4
sing 4
in 4
a 4
cage 4
said 4
the 4
bird 4
then 4
ill 4
eat 4
thee 4
said 4
the 4
labourer 4
i 4
have 4
always 4
heard 4
say 4
that 4
a 4
nightingale 4
on 4
toast 4
is 4
dainty 4
morsel 4
nay 4
kill 4
me 4
not 4
said 4
the 4
nightingale 4
but 4
let 4
me 4
free 4
and 4
ill 4
tell 4
thee 4
three 4
things 4
far 4
better 4
worth 4
than 4
my 4
poor 4
body 4
the 4
labourer 4
let 4
him 4
loose 4
and 4
he 4
flew 4
up 4
to 4
a 4
branch 4
of 4
a 4
tree 4
and 4
said 4
never 4
believe 4
a 4
captives 4
promise 4
thats 4
one 4
thing 4
then 4
again 4
keep 4
what 4
you 4
have 4
and 4
third 4
piece 4
of 4
advice 4
is 4
sorrow 4
not 4
over 4
what 4
is 4
lost 4
forever 4
then 4
the 4
songbird 4
flew 4
away 4
the 4
fox 4
the 4
cock 4
and 4
the 4
dog 4
one 4
moonlight 4
night 4
a 4
fox 4
was 4
prowling 4
about 4
a 4
farmers 4
hencoop 4
and 4
saw 4
a 4
cock 4
roosting 4
high 4
up 4
beyond 4
his 4
reach 4
good 4
news 4
good 4
news 4
he 4
cried 4
why 4
what 4
is 4
that 4
said 4
the 4
cock 4
king 4
lion 4
has 4
declared 4
a 4
universal 4
truce 4
no 4
beast 4
may 4
hurt 4
a 4
bird 4
henceforth 4
but 4
all 4
shall 4
dwell 4
together 4
in 4
brotherly 4
friendship 4
why 4
that 4
is 4
good 4
news 4
said 4
the 4
cock 4
and 4
there 4
i 4
see 4
some 4
one 4
coming 4
with 4
whom 4
we 4
can 4
share 4
the 4
good 4
tidings 4
and 4
so 4
saying 4
he 4
craned 4
his 4
neck 4
forward 4
and 4
looked 4
afar 4
off 4
what 4
is 4
it 4
you 4
see 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
it 4
is 4
only 4
my 4
masters 4
dog 4
that 4
is 4
coming 4
towards 4
us 4
what 4
going 4
so 4
soon 4
he 4
continued 4
as 4
the 4
fox 4
began 4
to 4
turn 4
away 4
as 4
soon 4
as 4
he 4
had 4
heard 4
the 4
news 4
will 4
you 4
not 4
stop 4
and 4
congratulate 4
the 4
dog 4
on 4
the 4
reign 4
of 4
universal 4
peace 4
i 4
would 4
gladly 4
do 4
so 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
but 4
i 4
fear 4
he 4
may 4
not 4
have 4
heard 4
of 4
king 4
lions 4
decree 4
cunning 4
often 4
outwits 4
itself 4
the 4
wind 4
and 4
the 4
sun 4
the 4
wind 4
and 4
the 4
sun 4
were 4
disputing 4
which 4
was 4
the 4
stronger 4
suddenly 4
they 4
saw 4
a 4
traveller 4
coming 4
down 4
the 4
road 4
and 4
the 4
sun 4
said 4
i 4
see 4
a 4
way 4
to 4
decide 4
our 4
dispute 4
whichever 4
of 4
us 4
can 4
cause 4
that 4
traveller 4
to 4
take 4
off 4
his 4
cloak 4
shall 4
be 4
regarded 4
as 4
the 4
stronger 4
you 4
begin 4
so 4
the 4
sun 4
retired 4
behind 4
a 4
cloud 4
and 4
the 4
wind 4
began 4
to 4
blow 4
as 4
hard 4
as 4
it 4
could 4
upon 4
the 4
traveller 4
but 4
the 4
harder 4
he 4
blew 4
the 4
more 4
closely 4
did 4
the 4
traveller 4
wrap 4
his 4
cloak 4
round 4
him 4
till 4
at 4
last 4
the 4
wind 4
had 4
to 4
give 4
up 4
in 4
despair 4
then 4
the 4
sun 4
came 4
out 4
and 4
shone 4
in 4
all 4
his 4
glory 4
upon 4
the 4
traveller 4
who 4
soon 4
found 4
it 4
too 4
hot 4
to 4
walk 4
with 4
his 4
cloak 4
on 4
kindness 4
effects 4
more 4
than 4
severity 4
hercules 4
and 4
the 4
waggoner 4
a 4
waggoner 4
was 4
once 4
driving 4
a 4
heavy 4
load 4
along 4
a 4
very 4
muddy 4
way 4
at 4
last 4
he 4
came 4
to 4
a 4
part 4
of 4
the 4
road 4
where 4
the 4
wheels 4
sank 4
halfway 4
into 4
the 4
mire 4
and 4
the 4
more 4
the 4
horses 4
pulled 4
the 4
deeper 4
sank 4
the 4
wheels 4
so 4
the 4
waggoner 4
threw 4
down 4
his 4
whip 4
and 4
knelt 4
down 4
and 4
prayed 4
to 4
hercules 4
the 4
strong 4
o 4
hercules 4
help 4
me 4
in 4
this 4
my 4
hour 4
of 4
distress 4
quoth 4
he 4
but 4
hercules 4
appeared 4
to 4
him 4
and 4
said 4
tut 4
man 4
dont 4
sprawl 4
there 4
get 4
up 4
and 4
put 4
your 4
shoulder 4
to 4
the 4
wheel 4
the 4
gods 4
help 4
them 4
that 4
help 4
themselves 4
the 4
man 4
the 4
boy 4
and 4
the 4
donkey 4
a 4
man 4
and 4
his 4
son 4
were 4
once 4
going 4
with 4
their 4
donkey 4
to 4
market 4
as 4
they 4
were 4
walking 4
along 4
by 4
its 4
side 4
a 4
countryman 4
passed 4
them 4
and 4
said 4
you 4
fools 4
what 4
is 4
a 4
donkey 4
for 4
but 4
to 4
ride 4
upon 4
so 4
the 4
man 4
put 4
the 4
boy 4
on 4
the 4
donkey 4
and 4
they 4
went 4
on 4
their 4
way 4
but 4
soon 4
they 4
passed 4
a 4
group 4
of 4
men 4
one 4
of 4
whom 4
said 4
see 4
that 4
lazy 4
youngster 4
he 4
lets 4
his 4
father 4
walk 4
while 4
he 4
rides 4
so 4
the 4
man 4
ordered 4
his 4
boy 4
to 4
get 4
off 4
and 4
got 4
on 4
himself 4
but 4
they 4
hadnt 4
gone 4
far 4
when 4
they 4
passed 4
two 4
women 4
one 4
of 4
whom 4
said 4
to 4
the 4
other 4
shame 4
on 4
that 4
lazy 4
lout 4
to 4
let 4
his 4
poor 4
little 4
son 4
trudge 4
along 4
well 4
the 4
man 4
didnt 4
know 4
what 4
to 4
do 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
he 4
took 4
his 4
boy 4
up 4
before 4
him 4
on 4
the 4
donkey 4
by 4
this 4
time 4
they 4
had 4
come 4
to 4
the 4
town 4
and 4
the 4
passersby 4
began 4
to 4
jeer 4
and 4
point 4
at 4
them 4
the 4
man 4
stopped 4
and 4
asked 4
what 4
they 4
were 4
scoffing 4
at 4
the 4
men 4
said 4
arent 4
you 4
ashamed 4
of 4
yourself 4
for 4
overloading 4
that 4
poor 4
donkey 4
of 4
yoursu 4
and 4
your 4
hulking 4
son 4
the 4
man 4
and 4
boy 4
got 4
off 4
and 4
tried 4
to 4
think 4
what 4
to 4
do 4
they 4
thought 4
and 4
they 4
thought 4
till 4
at 4
last 4
they 4
cut 4
down 4
a 4
pole 4
tied 4
the 4
donkeys 4
feet 4
to 4
it 4
and 4
raised 4
the 4
pole 4
and 4
the 4
donkey 4
to 4
their 4
shoulders 4
they 4
went 4
along 4
amid 4
the 4
laughter 4
of 4
all 4
who 4
met 4
them 4
till 4
they 4
came 4
to 4
market 4
bridge 4
when 4
the 4
donkey 4
getting 4
one 4
of 4
his 4
feet 4
loose 4
kicked 4
out 4
and 4
caused 4
the 4
boy 4
to 4
drop 4
his 4
end 4
of 4
the 4
pole 4
in 4
the 4
struggle 4
the 4
donkey 4
fell 4
over 4
the 4
bridge 4
and 4
his 4
forefeet 4
being 4
tied 4
together 4
he 4
was 4
drowned 4
that 4
will 4
teach 4
you 4
said 4
an 4
old 4
man 4
who 4
had 4
followed 4
them 4
please 4
all 4
and 4
you 4
will 4
please 4
none 4
the 4
miser 4
and 4
his 4
gold 4
once 4
upon 4
a 4
time 4
there 4
was 4
a 4
miser 4
who 4
used 4
to 4
hide 4
his 4
gold 4
at 4
the 4
foot 4
of 4
a 4
tree 4
in 4
his 4
garden 4
but 4
every 4
week 4
he 4
used 4
to 4
go 4
and 4
dig 4
it 4
up 4
and 4
gloat 4
over 4
his 4
gains 4
a 4
robber 4
who 4
had 4
noticed 4
this 4
went 4
and 4
dug 4
up 4
the 4
gold 4
and 4
decamped 4
with 4
it 4
when 4
the 4
miser 4
next 4
came 4
to 4
gloat 4
over 4
his 4
treasures 4
he 4
found 4
nothing 4
but 4
the 4
empty 4
hole 4
he 4
tore 4
his 4
hair 4
and 4
raised 4
such 4
an 4
outcry 4
that 4
all 4
the 4
neighbours 4
came 4
around 4
him 4
and 4
he 4
told 4
them 4
how 4
he 4
used 4
to 4
come 4
and 4
visit 4
his 4
gold 4
did 4
you 4
ever 4
take 4
any 4
of 4
it 4
out 4
asked 4
one 4
of 4
them 4
nay 4
said 4
he 4
i 4
only 4
came 4
to 4
look 4
at 4
it 4
then 4
come 4
again 4
and 4
look 4
at 4
the 4
hole 4
said 4
a 4
neighbour 4
it 4
will 4
do 4
you 4
just 4
as 4
much 4
good 4
wealth 4
unused 4
might 4
as 4
well 4
not 4
exist 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
mosquitoes 4
a 4
fox 4
after 4
crossing 4
a 4
river 4
got 4
its 4
tail 4
entangled 4
in 4
a 4
bush 4
and 4
could 4
not 4
move 4
a 4
number 4
of 4
mosquitoes 4
seeing 4
its 4
plight 4
settled 4
upon 4
it 4
and 4
enjoyed 4
a 4
good 4
meal 4
undisturbed 4
by 4
its 4
tail 4
a 4
hedgehog 4
strolling 4
by 4
took 4
pity 4
upon 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
went 4
up 4
to 4
him 4
you 4
are 4
in 4
a 4
bad 4
way 4
neighbour 4
said 4
the 4
hedgehog 4
shall 4
i 4
relieve 4
you 4
by 4
driving 4
off 4
those 4
mosquitoes 4
who 4
are 4
sucking 4
your 4
blood 4
thank 4
you 4
master 4
hedgehog 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
but 4
i 4
would 4
rather 4
not 4
why 4
how 4
is 4
that 4
asked 4
the 4
hedgehog 4
well 4
you 4
see 4
was 4
the 4
answer 4
these 4
mosquitoes 4
have 4
had 4
their 4
fill 4
if 4
you 4
drive 4
these 4
away 4
others 4
will 4
come 4
with 4
fresh 4
appetite 4
and 4
bleed 4
me 4
to 4
death 4
the 4
fox 4
without 4
a 4
tail 4
it 4
happened 4
that 4
a 4
fox 4
caught 4
its 4
tail 4
in 4
a 4
trap 4
and 4
in 4
struggling 4
to 4
release 4
himself 4
lost 4
all 4
of 4
it 4
but 4
the 4
stump 4
at 4
first 4
he 4
was 4
ashamed 4
to 4
show 4
himself 4
among 4
his 4
fellow 4
foxes 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
he 4
determined 4
to 4
put 4
a 4
bolder 4
face 4
upon 4
his 4
misfortune 4
and 4
summoned 4
all 4
the 4
foxes 4
to 4
a 4
general 4
meeting 4
to 4
consider 4
a 4
proposal 4
which 4
he 4
had 4
to 4
place 4
before 4
them 4
when 4
they 4
had 4
assembled 4
together 4
the 4
fox 4
proposed 4
that 4
they 4
should 4
all 4
do 4
away 4
with 4
their 4
tails 4
he 4
pointed 4
out 4
how 4
inconvenient 4
a 4
tail 4
was 4
when 4
they 4
were 4
pursued 4
by 4
their 4
enemies 4
the 4
dogs 4
how 4
much 4
it 4
was 4
in 4
the 4
way 4
when 4
they 4
desired 4
to 4
sit 4
down 4
and 4
hold 4
a 4
friendly 4
conversation 4
with 4
one 4
another 4
he 4
failed 4
to 4
see 4
any 4
advantage 4
in 4
carrying 4
about 4
such 4
a 4
useless 4
encumbrance 4
that 4
is 4
all 4
very 4
well 4
said 4
one 4
of 4
the 4
older 4
foxes 4
but 4
i 4
do 4
not 4
think 4
you 4
would 4
have 4
recommended 4
us 4
to 4
dispense 4
with 4
our 4
chief 4
ornament 4
if 4
you 4
had 4
not 4
happened 4
to 4
lose 4
it 4
yourself 4
distrust 4
interested 4
advice 4
the 4
oneeyed 4
doe 4
a 4
doe 4
had 4
had 4
the 4
misfortune 4
to 4
lose 4
one 4
of 4
her 4
eyes 4
and 4
could 4
not 4
see 4
any 4
one 4
approaching 4
her 4
on 4
that 4
side 4
so 4
to 4
avoid 4
any 4
danger 4
she 4
always 4
used 4
to 4
feed 4
on 4
a 4
high 4
cliff 4
near 4
the 4
sea 4
with 4
her 4
sound 4
eye 4
looking 4
towards 4
the 4
land 4
by 4
this 4
means 4
she 4
could 4
see 4
whenever 4
the 4
hunters 4
approached 4
her 4
on 4
land 4
and 4
often 4
escaped 4
by 4
this 4
means 4
but 4
the 4
hunters 4
found 4
out 4
that 4
she 4
was 4
blind 4
of 4
one 4
eye 4
and 4
hiring 4
a 4
boat 4
rowed 4
under 4
the 4
cliff 4
where 4
she 4
used 4
to 4
feed 4
and 4
shot 4
her 4
from 4
the 4
sea 4
ah 4
cried 4
she 4
with 4
her 4
dying 4
voice 4
you 4
cannot 4
escape 4
your 4
fate 4
belling 4
the 4
cat 4
long 4
ago 4
the 4
mice 4
had 4
a 4
general 4
council 4
to 4
consider 4
what 4
measures 4
they 4
could 4
take 4
to 4
outwit 4
their 4
common 4
enemy 4
the 4
cat 4
some 4
said 4
this 4
and 4
some 4
said 4
that 4
but 4
at 4
last 4
a 4
young 4
mouse 4
got 4
up 4
and 4
said 4
he 4
had 4
a 4
proposal 4
to 4
make 4
which 4
he 4
thought 4
would 4
meet 4
the 4
case 4
you 4
will 4
all 4
agree 4
said 4
he 4
that 4
our 4
chief 4
danger 4
consists 4
in 4
the 4
sly 4
and 4
treacherous 4
manner 4
in 4
which 4
the 4
enemy 4
approaches 4
us 4
now 4
if 4
we 4
could 4
receive 4
some 4
signal 4
of 4
her 4
approach 4
we 4
could 4
easily 4
escape 4
from 4
her 4
i 4
venture 4
therefore 4
to 4
propose 4
that 4
a 4
small 4
bell 4
be 4
procured 4
and 4
attached 4
by 4
a 4
ribbon 4
round 4
the 4
neck 4
of 4
the 4
cat 4
by 4
this 4
means 4
we 4
should 4
always 4
know 4
when 4
she 4
was 4
about 4
and 4
could 4
easily 4
retire 4
while 4
she 4
was 4
in 4
the 4
neighbourhood 4
this 4
proposal 4
met 4
with 4
general 4
applause 4
until 4
an 4
old 4
mouse 4
got 4
up 4
and 4
said 4
that 4
is 4
all 4
very 4
well 4
but 4
who 4
is 4
to 4
bell 4
the 4
cat 4
the 4
mice 4
looked 4
at 4
one 4
another 4
and 4
nobody 4
spoke 4
then 4
the 4
old 4
mouse 4
said 4
it 4
is 4
easy 4
to 4
propose 4
impossible 4
remedies 4
the 4
hare 4
and 4
the 4
tortoise 4
the 4
hare 4
was 4
once 4
boasting 4
of 4
his 4
speed 4
before 4
the 4
other 4
animals 4
i 4
have 4
never 4
yet 4
been 4
beaten 4
said 4
he 4
when 4
i 4
put 4
forth 4
my 4
full 4
speed 4
i 4
challenge 4
any 4
one 4
here 4
to 4
race 4
with 4
me 4
the 4
tortoise 4
said 4
quietly 4
i 4
accept 4
your 4
challenge 4
that 4
is 4
a 4
good 4
joke 4
said 4
the 4
hare 4
i 4
could 4
dance 4
round 4
you 4
all 4
the 4
way 4
keep 4
your 4
boasting 4
till 4
youve 4
beaten 4
answered 4
the 4
tortoise 4
shall 4
we 4
race 4
so 4
a 4
course 4
was 4
fixed 4
and 4
a 4
start 4
was 4
made 4
the 4
hare 4
darted 4
almost 4
out 4
of 4
sight 4
at 4
once 4
but 4
soon 4
stopped 4
and 4
to 4
show 4
his 4
contempt 4
for 4
the 4
tortoise 4
lay 4
down 4
to 4
have 4
a 4
nap 4
the 4
tortoise 4
plodded 4
on 4
and 4
plodded 4
on 4
and 4
when 4
the 4
hare 4
awoke 4
from 4
his 4
nap 4
he 4
saw 4
the 4
tortoise 4
just 4
near 4
the 4
winningpost 4
and 4
could 4
not 4
run 4
up 4
in 4
time 4
to 4
save 4
the 4
race 4
then 4
said 4
the 4
tortoise 4
plodding 4
wins 4
the 4
race 4
the 4
old 4
man 4
and 4
death 4
an 4
old 4
labourer 4
bent 4
double 4
with 4
age 4
and 4
toil 4
was 4
gathering 4
sticks 4
in 4
a 4
forest 4
at 4
last 4
he 4
grew 4
so 4
tired 4
and 4
hopeless 4
that 4
he 4
threw 4
down 4
the 4
bundle 4
of 4
sticks 4
and 4
cried 4
out 4
i 4
cannot 4
bear 4
this 4
life 4
any 4
longer 4
ah 4
i 4
wish 4
death 4
would 4
only 4
come 4
and 4
take 4
me 4
as 4
he 4
spoke 4
death 4
a 4
grisly 4
skeleton 4
appeared 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
him 4
what 4
wouldst 4
thou 4
mortal 4
i 4
heard 4
thee 4
call 4
me 4
please 4
sir 4
replied 4
the 4
woodcutter 4
would 4
you 4
kindly 4
help 4
me 4
to 4
lift 4
this 4
faggot 4
of 4
sticks 4
on 4
to 4
my 4
shoulder 4
we 4
would 4
often 4
be 4
sorry 4
if 4
our 4
wishes 4
were 4
gratified 4
the 4
hare 4
with 4
many 4
friends 4
a 4
hare 4
was 4
very 4
popular 4
with 4
the 4
other 4
beasts 4
who 4
all 4
claimed 4
to 4
be 4
her 4
friends 4
but 4
one 4
day 4
she 4
heard 4
the 4
hounds 4
approaching 4
and 4
hoped 4
to 4
escape 4
them 4
by 4
the 4
aid 4
of 4
her 4
many 4
friends 4
so 4
she 4
went 4
to 4
the 4
horse 4
and 4
asked 4
him 4
to 4
carry 4
her 4
away 4
from 4
the 4
hounds 4
on 4
his 4
back 4
but 4
he 4
declined 4
stating 4
that 4
he 4
had 4
important 4
work 4
to 4
do 4
for 4
his 4
master 4
he 4
felt 4
sure 4
he 4
said 4
that 4
all 4
her 4
other 4
friends 4
would 4
come 4
to 4
her 4
assistance 4
she 4
then 4
applied 4
to 4
the 4
bull 4
and 4
hoped 4
that 4
he 4
would 4
repel 4
the 4
hounds 4
with 4
his 4
horns 4
the 4
bull 4
replied 4
i 4
am 4
very 4
sorry 4
but 4
i 4
have 4
an 4
appointment 4
with 4
a 4
lady 4
but 4
i 4
feel 4
sure 4
that 4
our 4
friend 4
the 4
goat 4
will 4
do 4
what 4
you 4
want 4
the 4
goat 4
however 4
feared 4
that 4
his 4
back 4
might 4
do 4
her 4
some 4
harm 4
if 4
he 4
took 4
her 4
upon 4
it 4
the 4
ram 4
he 4
felt 4
sure 4
was 4
the 4
proper 4
friend 4
to 4
apply 4
to 4
so 4
she 4
went 4
to 4
the 4
ram 4
and 4
told 4
him 4
the 4
case 4
the 4
ram 4
replied 4
another 4
time 4
my 4
dear 4
friend 4
i 4
do 4
not 4
like 4
to 4
interfere 4
on 4
the 4
present 4
occasion 4
as 4
hounds 4
have 4
been 4
known 4
to 4
eat 4
sheep 4
as 4
well 4
as 4
hares 4
the 4
hare 4
then 4
applied 4
as 4
a 4
last 4
hope 4
to 4
the 4
calf 4
who 4
regretted 4
that 4
he 4
was 4
unable 4
to 4
help 4
her 4
as 4
he 4
did 4
not 4
like 4
to 4
take 4
the 4
responsibility 4
upon 4
himself 4
as 4
so 4
many 4
older 4
persons 4
than 4
himself 4
had 4
declined 4
the 4
task 4
by 4
this 4
time 4
the 4
hounds 4
were 4
quite 4
near 4
and 4
the 4
hare 4
took 4
to 4
her 4
heels 4
and 4
luckily 4
escaped 4
he 4
that 4
has 4
many 4
friends 4
has 4
no 4
friends 4
the 4
lion 4
in 4
love 4
a 4
lion 4
once 4
fell 4
in 4
love 4
with 4
a 4
beautiful 4
maiden 4
and 4
proposed 4
marriage 4
to 4
her 4
parents 4
the 4
old 4
people 4
did 4
not 4
know 4
what 4
to 4
say 4
they 4
did 4
not 4
like 4
to 4
give 4
their 4
daughter 4
to 4
the 4
lion 4
yet 4
they 4
did 4
not 4
wish 4
to 4
enrage 4
the 4
king 4
of 4
beasts 4
at 4
last 4
the 4
father 4
said 4
we 4
feel 4
highly 4
honoured 4
by 4
your 4
majestys 4
proposal 4
but 4
you 4
see 4
our 4
daughter 4
is 4
a 4
tender 4
young 4
thing 4
and 4
we 4
fear 4
that 4
in 4
the 4
vehemence 4
of 4
your 4
affection 4
you 4
might 4
possibly 4
do 4
her 4
some 4
injury 4
might 4
i 4
venture 4
to 4
suggest 4
that 4
your 4
majesty 4
should 4
have 4
your 4
claws 4
removed 4
and 4
your 4
teeth 4
extracted 4
then 4
we 4
would 4
gladly 4
consider 4
your 4
proposal 4
again 4
the 4
lion 4
was 4
so 4
much 4
in 4
love 4
that 4
he 4
had 4
his 4
claws 4
trimmed 4
and 4
his 4
big 4
teeth 4
taken 4
out 4
but 4
when 4
he 4
came 4
again 4
to 4
the 4
parents 4
of 4
the 4
young 4
girl 4
they 4
simply 4
laughed 4
in 4
his 4
face 4
and 4
bade 4
him 4
do 4
his 4
worst 4
love 4
can 4
tame 4
the 4
wildest 4
the 4
bundle 4
of 4
sticks 4
an 4
old 4
man 4
on 4
the 4
point 4
of 4
death 4
summoned 4
his 4
sons 4
around 4
him 4
to 4
give 4
them 4
some 4
parting 4
advice 4
he 4
ordered 4
his 4
servants 4
to 4
bring 4
in 4
a 4
faggot 4
of 4
sticks 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
his 4
eldest 4
son 4
break 4
it 4
the 4
son 4
strained 4
and 4
strained 4
but 4
with 4
all 4
his 4
efforts 4
was 4
unable 4
to 4
break 4
the 4
bundle 4
the 4
other 4
sons 4
also 4
tried 4
but 4
none 4
of 4
them 4
was 4
successful 4
untie 4
the 4
faggots 4
said 4
the 4
father 4
and 4
each 4
of 4
you 4
take 4
a 4
stick 4
when 4
they 4
had 4
done 4
so 4
he 4
called 4
out 4
to 4
them 4
now 4
break 4
and 4
each 4
stick 4
was 4
easily 4
broken 4
you 4
see 4
my 4
meaning 4
said 4
their 4
father 4
union 4
gives 4
strength 4
the 4
lion 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
beasts 4
the 4
lion 4
once 4
gave 4
out 4
that 4
he 4
was 4
sick 4
unto 4
death 4
and 4
summoned 4
the 4
animals 4
to 4
come 4
and 4
hear 4
his 4
last 4
will 4
and 4
testament 4
so 4
the 4
goat 4
came 4
to 4
the 4
lions 4
cave 4
and 4
stopped 4
there 4
listening 4
for 4
a 4
long 4
time 4
then 4
a 4
sheep 4
went 4
in 4
and 4
before 4
she 4
came 4
out 4
a 4
calf 4
came 4
up 4
to 4
receive 4
the 4
last 4
wishes 4
of 4
the 4
lord 4
of 4
the 4
beasts 4
but 4
soon 4
the 4
lion 4
seemed 4
to 4
recover 4
and 4
came 4
to 4
the 4
mouth 4
of 4
his 4
cave 4
and 4
saw 4
the 4
fox 4
who 4
had 4
been 4
waiting 4
outside 4
for 4
some 4
time 4
why 4
do 4
you 4
not 4
come 4
to 4
pay 4
your 4
respects 4
to 4
me 4
said 4
the 4
lion 4
to 4
the 4
fox 4
i 4
beg 4
your 4
majestys 4
pardon 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
but 4
i 4
noticed 4
the 4
track 4
of 4
the 4
animals 4
that 4
have 4
already 4
come 4
to 4
you 4
and 4
while 4
i 4
see 4
many 4
hoofmarks 4
going 4
in 4
i 4
see 4
none 4
coming 4
out 4
till 4
the 4
animals 4
that 4
have 4
entered 4
your 4
cave 4
come 4
out 4
again 4
i 4
prefer 4
to 4
remain 4
in 4
the 4
open 4
air 4
it 4
is 4
easier 4
to 4
get 4
into 4
the 4
enemys 4
toils 4
than 4
out 4
again 4
the 4
asss 4
brains 4
the 4
lion 4
and 4
the 4
fox 4
went 4
hunting 4
together 4
the 4
lion 4
on 4
the 4
advice 4
of 4
the 4
fox 4
sent 4
a 4
message 4
to 4
the 4
ass 4
proposing 4
to 4
make 4
an 4
alliance 4
between 4
their 4
two 4
families 4
the 4
ass 4
came 4
to 4
the 4
place 4
of 4
meeting 4
overjoyed 4
at 4
the 4
prospect 4
of 4
a 4
royal 4
alliance 4
but 4
when 4
he 4
came 4
there 4
the 4
lion 4
simply 4
pounced 4
on 4
the 4
ass 4
and 4
said 4
to 4
the 4
fox 4
here 4

while 4

and 4

a 4

woe 4
betide 4
you 4
if 4
you 4
touch 4
my 4
prey 4
the 4
lion 4
went 4
away 4
and 4
the 4
fox 4
waited 4
but 4
finding 4
that 4
his 4
master 4
did 4
not 4
return 4
ventured 4
to 4
take 4
out 4
the 4
brains 4
of 4
the 4
ass 4
and 4
ate 4
them 4
up 4
when 4
the 4
lion 4
came 4
back 4
he 4
soon 4
noticed 4
the 4
absence 4
of 4
the 4
brains 4
and 4
asked 4
the 4
fox 4
in 4
a 4
terrible 4
voice 4
what 4
have 4
you 4
done 4

was 4
soaring 4
through 4
the 4
air 4
when 4
suddenly 4
it 4
heard 4
the 4
whizz 4
of 4
an 4
arrow 4
and 4
felt 4
itself 4
wounded 4
to 4
death 4
slowly 4
it 4
fluttered 4
down 4
to 4
the 4
earth 4
with 4
its 4
lifeblood 4
pouring 4
out 4
of 4
it 4
looking 4
down 4
upon 4
the 4
arrow 4
with 4
which 4
it 4
had 4
been 4
pierced 4
it 4
found 4
that 4
the 4
shaft 4
of 4
the 4
arrow 4
had 4
been 4
feathered 4
with 4

prancing 4
along 4
in 4
its 4
fine 4
trappings 4
the 4

well 4
fed 4
and 4
all 4
that 4
fine 4
harness 4
upon 4
you 4
next 4
day 4
however 4
there 4

a 4
great 4
battle 4
and 4
the 4
horse 4
was 4
wounded 4
to 4
death 4
in 4
the 4
final 4
charge 4
of 4
the 4
day 4

on 4
the 4

captured 4
by 4
them 4
they 4
were 4
about 4
to 4

him 4
to 4
death 4
when 4
he 4
begged 4

his 4
plea 4
for 4

only 4
blow 4
this 4
trumpet 4
and 4
surely 4
that 4

you 4
kill 4
me 4

the 4
buffoon 4
and 4
the 4
countryman 4
at 4
a 4
country 4
fair 4
there 4
was 4
a 4
buffoon 4
who 4
made 4
all 4
the 4
people 4
laugh 4
by 4
imitating 4
the 4
cries 4
of 4
various 4
animals 4
he 4
finished 4
off 4
by 4
squeaking 4
so 4
like 4
a 4
pig 4
that 4
the 4
spectators 4
thought 4
that 4
he 4
had 4
a 4
porker 4
concealed 4
about 4
him 4
but 4
a 4
countryman 4
who 4
stood 4
by 4
said 4
call 4
that 4
a 4
pig 4
s 4
squeak 4
nothing 4
like 4
it 4
you 4
give 4
me 4
till 4
tomorrow 4
and 4
i 4
will 4
show 4
you 4
what 4
its 4
like 4
the 4
audience 4
laughed 4
but 4
next 4
day 4
sure 4
enough 4
the 4
countryman 4
appeared 4
on 4
the 4
stage 4
and 4
putting 4
his 4
head 4
down 4
squealed 4
so 4
hideously 4
that 4
the 4
spectators 4
hissed 4
and 4
threw 4
stones 4
at 4
him 4
to 4
make 4
him 4
stop 4
you 4
fools 4
he 4
cried 4
see 4
what 4
you 4
have 4
been 4
hissing 4
and 4
held 4
up 4
a 4
little 4
pig 4
whose 4
ear 4
he 4
had 4
been 4
pinching 4
to 4
make 4
him 4
utter 4
the 4
squeals 4
men 4
often 4
applaud 4
an 4
imitation 4
and 4
hiss 4
the 4
real 4
thing 4
the 4
old 4
woman 4
and 4
the 4
winejar 4
you 4
must 4
know 4
that 4
sometimes 4
old 4
women 4
like 4
a 4
glass 4
of 4
wine 4
one 4
of 4
this 4
sort 4
once 4
found 4
a 4
winejar 4
lying 4
in 4
the 4
road 4
and 4
eagerly 4
went 4
up 4
to 4
it 4
hoping 4
to 4
find 4
it 4
full 4
but 4
when 4
she 4
took 4
it 4
up 4
she 4
found 4
that 4
all 4
the 4
wine 4
had 4
been 4
drunk 4
out 4
of 4
it 4
still 4
she 4
took 4
a 4
long 4
sniff 4
at 4
the 4
mouth 4
of 4
the 4
jar 4
ah 4
she 4
cried 4
what 4
memories 4
cling 4
round 4
the 4
instruments 4
of 4
our 4
pleasure 4
the 4
fox 4
and 4
the 4
goat 4
by 4
an 4
unlucky 4
chance 4
a 4
fox 4
fell 4
into 4
a 4
deep 4
well 4
from 4
which 4
he 4
could 4
not 4
get 4
out 4
a 4
goat 4
passed 4
by 4
shortly 4
afterwards 4
and 4
asked 4
the 4
fox 4
what 4
he 4
was 4
doing 4
down 4
there 4
oh 4
have 4
you 4
not 4
heard 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
there 4
is 4
going 4
to 4
be 4
a 4
great 4
drought 4
so 4
i 4
jumped 4
down 4
here 4
in 4
order 4
to 4
be 4
sure 4
to 4
have 4
water 4
by 4
me 4
why 4
dont 4
you 4
come 4
down 4
too 4
the 4
goat 4
thought 4
well 4
of 4
this 4
advice 4
and 4
jumped 4
down 4
into 4
the 4
well 4
but 4
the 4
fox 4
immediately 4
jumped 4
on 4
her 4
back 4
and 4
by 4
putting 4
his 4
foot 4
on 4
her 4
long 4
horns 4
managed 4
to 4
jump 4
up 4
to 4
the 4
edge 4
of 4
the 4
well 4
goodbye 4
friend 4
said 4
the 4
fox 4
remember 4
next 4
time 4
never 4
trust 4
the 4
advice 4
of 4
a 4
man 4
in 4
difficulties 4
