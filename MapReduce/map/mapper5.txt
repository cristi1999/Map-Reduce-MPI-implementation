his 5
biography 5
of 5
einstein 5
mr 5
h 5
gordou 5
garbedian 5
relates 5
that 5
an 5
american 5
newspaper 5
man 5
asked 5
the 5
great 5
physicist 5
for 5
a 5
definition 5
of 5
his 5
theory 5
of 5
relativity 5
in 5
one 5
sentence 5
einstein 5
replied 5
that 5
it 5
would 5
take 5
him 5
three 5
days 5
to 5
give 5
a 5
short 5
definition 5
of 5
relativity 5
he 5
might 5
well 5
have 5
added 5
that 5
unless 5
his 5
questioner 5
had 5
an 5
intimate 5
acquaintance 5
with 5
mathematics 5
and 5
physics 5
the 5
definition 5
would 5
be 5
incomprehensible 5
to 5
the 5
majority 5
of 5
people 5
einsteins 5
theory 5
is 5
a 5
complete 5
mystery 5
their 5
attitude 5
towards 5
einstein 5
is 5
like 5
that 5
of 5
mark 5
twain 5
towards 5
the 5
writer 5
of 5
a 5
work 5
on 5
mathematics 5
here 5
was 5
a 5
man 5
who 5
had 5
written 5
an 5
entire 5
book 5
of 5
which 5
mark 5
could 5
not 5
understand 5
a 5
single 5
sentence 5
einstein 5
therefore 5
is 5
great 5
in 5
the 5
public 5
eye 5
partly 5
because 5
he 5
has 5
made 5
revolutionary 5
discoveries 5
which 5
cannot 5
be 5
translated 5
into 5
the 5
common 5
tongue 5
we 5
stand 5
in 5
proper 5
awe 5
of 5
a 5
man 5
whose 5
thoughts 5
move 5
on 5
heights 5
far 5
beyond 5
our 5
range 5
whose 5
achievements 5
can 5
be 5
measured 5
only 5
by 5
the 5
few 5
who 5
are 5
able 5
to 5
follow 5
his 5
reasoning 5
and 5
challenge 5
his 5
conclusions 5
there 5
is 5
however 5
another 5
side 5
to 5
his 5
personality 5
it 5
is 5
revealed 5
in 5
the 5
addresses 5
letters 5
and 5
occasional 5
writings 5
brought 5
together 5
in 5
this 5
book 5
these 5
fragments 5
form 5
a 5
mosaic 5
portrait 5
of 5
einstein 5
the 5
man 5
each 5
one 5
is 5
in 5
a 5
sense 5
complete 5
in 5
itself 5
it 5
presents 5
his 5
views 5
on 5
some 5
aspect 5
of 5
progress 5
education 5
peace 5
war 5
liberty 5
or 5
other 5
problems 5
of 5
universal 5
interest 5
their 5
combined 5
effect 5
is 5
to 5
demonstrate 5
that 5
the 5
einstein 5
we 5
can 5
all 5
understand 5
is 5
no 5
less 5
great 5
than 5
the 5
einstein 5
we 5
take 5
on 5
trust 5
einstein 5
has 5
asked 5
nothing 5
more 5
from 5
life 5
than 5
the 5
freedom 5
to 5
pursue 5
his 5
researches 5
into 5
the 5
mechanism 5
of 5
the 5
universe 5
his 5
nature 5
is 5
of 5
rare 5
simplicity 5
and 5
sincerity 5
he 5
always 5
has 5
been 5
and 5
he 5
remains 5
genuinely 5
indifferent 5
to 5
wealth 5
and 5
fame 5
and 5
the 5
other 5
prizes 5
so 5
dear 5
to 5
ambition 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
he 5
is 5
no 5
recluse 5
shutting 5
himself 5
off 5
from 5
the 5
sorrows 5
and 5
agitations 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
around 5
him 5
himself 5
familiar 5
from 5
early 5
years 5
with 5
the 5
handicap 5
of 5
poverty 5
and 5
with 5
some 5
of 5
the 5
worst 5
forms 5
of 5
mans 5
inhumanity 5
to 5
man 5
he 5
has 5
never 5
spared 5
himself 5
in 5
defence 5
of 5
the 5
weak 5
and 5
the 5
oppressed 5
nothing 5
could 5
be 5
more 5
unwelcome 5
to 5
his 5
sensitive 5
and 5
retiring 5
character 5
than 5
the 5
glare 5
of 5
the 5
platform 5
and 5
the 5
heat 5
of 5
public 5
controversy 5
yet 5
he 5
has 5
never 5
hesitated 5
when 5
he 5
felt 5
that 5
his 5
voice 5
or 5
influence 5
would 5
help 5
to 5
redress 5
a 5
wrong 5
history 5
surely 5
has 5
few 5
parallels 5
with 5
this 5
introspective 5
mathematical 5
genius 5
who 5
laboured 5
unceasingly 5
as 5
an 5
eager 5
champion 5
of 5
the 5
rights 5
of 5
man 5
albert 5
einstein 5
was 5
born 5
in 5
at 5
ulm 5
when 5
he 5
was 5
four 5
years 5
old 5
his 5
father 5
who 5
owned 5
an 5
electrochemical 5
works 5
moved 5
to 5
munich 5
and 5
two 5
years 5
later 5
the 5
boy 5
went 5
to 5
school 5
experiencing 5
a 5
rigid 5
almost 5
military 5
type 5
of 5
discipline 5
and 5
also 5
the 5
isolation 5
of 5
a 5
shy 5
and 5
contemplative 5
jewish 5
child 5
among 5
roman 5
catholics 5
factors 5
which 5
made 5
a 5
deep 5
and 5
enduring 5
impression 5
from 5
the 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
of 5
his 5
teachers 5
he 5
was 5
an 5
unsatisfactory 5
pupil 5
apparently 5
incapable 5
of 5
progress 5
in 5
languages 5
history 5
geography 5
and 5
other 5
primary 5
subjects 5
his 5
interest 5
in 5
mathematics 5
was 5
roused 5
not 5
by 5
his 5
instructors 5
but 5
by 5
a 5
jewish 5
medical 5
student 5
max 5
talmey 5
who 5
gave 5
him 5
a 5
book 5
on 5
geometry 5
and 5
so 5
set 5
him 5
upon 5
a 5
course 5
of 5
enthusiastic 5
study 5
which 5
made 5
him 5
at 5
the 5
age 5
of 5
fourteen 5
a 5
better 5
mathematician 5
than 5
his 5
masters 5
at 5
this 5
stage 5
also 5
he 5
began 5
the 5
study 5
of 5
philosophy 5
reading 5
and 5
rereading 5
the 5
words 5
of 5
kant 5
and 5
other 5
metaphysicians 5
business 5
reverses 5
led 5
the 5
elder 5
einstein 5
to 5
make 5
a 5
fresh 5
start 5
in 5
milan 5
thus 5
introducing 5
albert 5
to 5
the 5
joys 5
of 5
a 5
freer 5
sunnier 5
life 5
than 5
had 5
been 5
possible 5
in 5
germany 5
necessity 5
however 5
made 5
this 5
holiday 5
a 5
brief 5
one 5
and 5
after 5
a 5
few 5
months 5
of 5
freedom 5
the 5
preparation 5
for 5
a 5
career 5
began 5
it 5
opened 5
with 5
an 5
effort 5
backed 5
by 5
a 5
certificate 5
of 5
mathematical 5
proficiency 5
given 5
by 5
a 5
teacher 5
in 5
the 5
gymnasium 5
at 5
munich 5
to 5
obtain 5
admission 5
to 5
the 5
polytechnic 5
academy 5
at 5
zurich 5
a 5
year 5
passed 5
in 5
the 5
study 5
of 5
necessary 5
subjects 5
which 5
he 5
had 5
neglected 5
for 5
mathematics 5
but 5
once 5
admitted 5
the 5
young 5
einstein 5
became 5
absorbed 5
in 5
the 5
pursuit 5
of 5
science 5
and 5
philosophy 5
and 5
made 5
astonishing 5
progress 5
after 5
five 5
distinguished 5
years 5
at 5
the 5
polytechnic 5
he 5
hoped 5
to 5
step 5
into 5
the 5
post 5
of 5
assistant 5
professor 5
but 5
found 5
that 5
the 5
kindly 5
words 5
of 5
the 5
professors 5
who 5
had 5
stimulated 5
the 5
hope 5
did 5
not 5
materialize 5
then 5
followed 5
a 5
weary 5
search 5
for 5
work 5
two 5
brief 5
interludes 5
of 5
teaching 5
and 5
a 5
stable 5
appointment 5
as 5
examiner 5
at 5
the 5
confederate 5
patent 5
office 5
at 5
berrie 5
humdrum 5
as 5
the 5
work 5
was 5
it 5
had 5
the 5
double 5
advantage 5
of 5
providing 5
a 5
competence 5
and 5
of 5
leaving 5
his 5
mind 5
free 5
for 5
the 5
mathematical 5
speculations 5
which 5
were 5
then 5
taking 5
shape 5
in 5
the 5
theory 5
of 5
relativity 5
in 5
his 5
first 5
monograph 5
on 5
the 5
theory 5
was 5
published 5
in 5
a 5
swiss 5
scientific 5
journal 5
the 5
annalen 5
der 5
physik 5
zurich 5
awoke 5
to 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
it 5
possessed 5
a 5
genius 5
in 5
the 5
form 5
of 5
a 5

clerk 5
promoted 5
him 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
lecturer 5
at 5
the 5
university 5

four 5
years 5
laterin 5
installed 5
him 5
as 5
professor 5
his 5
next 5
appointment 5
was 5
in 5
at 5

he 5
remained 5
for 5
eighteen 5
months 5

of 5

was 5
a 5
trying 5
time 5
for 5
einstein 5
who 5
could 5
not 5
conceal 5
his 5
ardent 5
pacifism 5
but 5
he 5
found 5
what 5
solace 5
he 5
could 5
in 5
his 5
studies 5
later 5
events 5
brought 5
him 5
into 5

into 5

parts 5
of 5
the 5

you 5

the 5

that 5

not 5
merely 5
unfortunate 5
but 5
almost 5
disqualified 5

as 5
i 5
see 5
it 5
what 5
an 5

that 5

are 5

up 5
by 5
the 5
tie 5
of 5
sympathy 5
a 5
hundred 5
times 5
every 5
day 5
i 5
remind 5
myself 5
that 5
my 5
inner 5
and 5
outer 5
life 5
depend 5
on 5
the 5
labours 5
of 5
other 5
men 5
living 5
and 5
dead 5
and 5
that 5
i 5
must 5
exert 5
myself 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
give 5
in 5
the 5
same 5
measure 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
received 5
and 5
am 5
still 5
receiving 5
i 5
am 5
strongly 5
drawn 5
to 5
the 5
simple 5
life 5
and 5
am 5
often 5
oppressed 5
by 5
the 5
feeling 5
that 5
i 5
am 5
engrossing 5
an 5
unnecessary 5
amount 5
of 5
the 5
labour 5
of 5
my 5
fellowmen 5
i 5
regard 5
class 5
differences 5
as 5
contrary 5
to 5
justice 5
and 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
resort 5
based 5
on 5
force 5
i 5
also 5
consider 5
that 5
plain 5
living 5
is 5
good 5
for 5
everybody 5
physically 5
and 5
mentally 5
in 5
human 5
freedom 5
in 5
the 5
philosophical 5
sense 5
i 5
am 5
definitely 5
a 5
disbeliever 5
everybody 5
acts 5
not 5
only 5
under 5
external 5
compulsion 5
but 5
also 5
in 5

with 5
inner 5
necessity 5
schopenhauers 5
saying 5
that 5
a 5
man 5
can 5
do 5
as 5
he 5
will 5
but 5
not 5
will 5
as 5
he 5
will 5
has 5
been 5
an 5
inspiration 5
to 5
me 5
since 5
my 5
youth 5
up 5
and 5
a 5
continual 5
consolation 5
and 5
unfailing 5
wellspring 5
of 5
patience 5
in 5
the 5
face 5
of 5
the 5
hardships 5
of 5
life 5
my 5
own 5
and 5
others 5
this 5
feeling 5
mercifully 5
mitigates 5
the 5
sense 5
of 5
responsibility 5
which 5
so 5
easily 5
becomes 5
paralysing 5
and 5
it 5
prevents 5
us 5
from 5
taking 5
ourselves 5
and 5
other 5
people 5
too 5
seriously 5
it 5
conduces 5
to 5
a 5
view 5
of 5
life 5
in 5
which 5
humour 5
above 5
all 5
has 5
its 5
due 5
place 5
to 5
inquire 5
after 5
the 5
meaning 5
or 5
object 5
of 5
ones 5
own 5
existence 5
or 5
of 5
creation 5
generally 5
has 5
always 5
seemed 5
to 5
me 5
absurd 5
from 5
an 5
objective 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
and 5
yet 5
everybody 5
has 5
certain 5
ideals 5
which 5
determine 5
the 5
direction 5
of 5
his 5
endeavours 5
and 5
his 5
judgments 5
in 5
this 5
sense 5
i 5

never 5
looked 5

the 5

which 5
have 5
lighted 5
me 5
on 5
my 5

have 5
never 5

an 5
obstinate 5
sense 5
of 5
detachment 5
of 5

need 5

feeling 5
which 5
increases 5

the 5
way 5
of 5
geniality 5
and 5
lightheartedness 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5

is 5
largely 5
independent 5
of 5
the 5
opinions 5

the 5
temptation 5
to 5
take 5
his 5
stand 5
on 5
such 5
insecure 5
foundations 5
my 5
political 5
ideal 5
is 5
that 5
of 5
democracy 5
let 5
every 5
man 5
be 5
respected 5
as 5
an 5
individual 5
and 5
no 5
man 5
idolized 5
it 5
is 5
an 5
irony 5
of 5
fate 5
that 5
i 5
myself 5
have 5
been 5
the 5
recipient 5
of 5
excessive 5
admiration 5
and 5
respect 5
from 5
my 5
fellows 5
through 5
no 5
fault 5
and 5
no 5
merit 5
of 5
my 5
own 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
this 5
may 5
well 5
be 5
the 5
desire 5
unattainable 5
for 5
many 5
to 5
understand 5
the 5
one 5
or 5
two 5
ideas 5
to 5
which 5
i 5
have 5
with 5
my 5
feeble 5
powers 5
attained 5
through 5
ceaseless 5
struggle 5
i 5
am 5
quite 5
aware 5
that 5
it 5
is 5
necessary 5
for 5
the 5
success 5
of 5
any 5
complex 5
undertaking 5
that 5
one 5
man 5
should 5
do 5
the 5
thinking 5
and 5
directing 5
and 5
in 5
general 5
bear 5
the 5
responsibility 5
but 5
the 5
led 5
must 5
not 5
be 5
compelled 5
they 5
must 5
be 5
able 5
to 5
choose 5
their 5
leader 5
an 5
autocratic 5
system 5
of 5
coercion 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
soon 5
degenerates 5
for 5
force 5
always 5
attracts 5
men 5
of 5
low 5
morality 5
and 5
i 5
believe 5
it 5
to 5
be 5
an 5
invariable 5
rule 5
that 5
tyrants 5
of 5
genius 5
are 5
succeeded 5
by 5
scoundrels 5
for 5
this 5
reason 5
i 5
have 5
always 5
been 5
passionately 5
opposed 5
to 5
systems 5
such 5
as 5
we 5
see 5
in 5
italy 5
and 5
russia 5
today 5
the 5
thing 5
that 5
has 5
brought 5
discredit 5
upon 5
the 5
prevailing 5
form 5
of 5
democracy 5
in 5
europe 5
today 5
is 5
not 5
to 5
be 5
laid 5
to 5
the 5
door 5
of 5
the 5
democratic 5
idea 5
as 5
such 5
but 5
to 5
lack 5
of 5
stability 5
on 5
the 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
heads 5
of 5
governments 5
and 5
to 5
the 5
impersonal 5
character 5
of 5
the 5
electoral 5
system 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
in 5
this 5
respect 5
the 5
united 5
states 5
of 5
america 5
have 5
found 5
the 5
right 5
way 5
they 5
have 5
a 5
responsible 5
president 5
who 5
is 5
elected 5
for 5
a 5
sufficiently 5
long 5
period 5
and 5
has 5
sufficient 5
powers 5
to 5
be 5
really 5
responsible 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5
what 5
i 5
value 5
in 5
our 5
political 5
system 5
is 5
the 5
more 5
extensive 5
provision 5
that 5
it 5
makes 5
for 5
the 5
individual 5
in 5
case 5
of 5
illness 5
or 5
need 5
the 5
really 5
valuable 5
thing 5
in 5
the 5
pageant 5
of 5
human 5
life 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
not 5
the 5
state 5
but 5
the 5
creative 5
sentient 5
individual 5
the 5
personality 5
it 5
alone 5
creates 5
the 5
noble 5
and 5
the 5
sublime 5
while 5
the 5
herd 5
as 5
such 5
remains 5
dull 5
in 5
thought 5
and 5
dull 5
in 5
feeling 5
this 5
topic 5
brings 5
me 5
to 5
that 5
worst 5
outcrop 5
of 5
the 5
herd 5
nature 5
the 5
military 5
system 5
which 5
i 5
abhor 5
that 5
a 5
man 5
can 5
take 5
pleasure 5
in 5
marching 5
in 5
formation 5
to 5
the 5
strains 5
of 5
a 5
band 5
is 5
enough 5
to 5
make 5
me 5
despise 5
him 5
he 5
has 5
only 5
been 5
given 5
his 5
big 5
brain 5
by 5
mistake 5
a 5
backbone 5
was 5
all 5
he 5
needed 5
this 5
plaguespot 5
of 5
civilization 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
abolished 5
with 5
all 5
possible 5
speed 5
heroism 5
by 5
order 5
senseless 5
violence 5
and 5
all 5
the 5
pestilent 5
nonsense 5
that 5
does 5
by 5
the 5
name 5
of 5

i 5
hate 5
them 5

seems 5
to 5
me 5
a 5
mean 5
contemptible 5
thing 5
i 5
would 5
rather 5
be 5
hacked 5
in 5
pieces 5
than 5
take 5
part 5
in 5
such 5
an 5
abominable 5
business 5
and 5
yet 5
so 5
high 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
everything 5
is 5
my 5
opinion 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
that 5
i 5
believe 5
this 5
bogey 5
would 5
have 5
disappeared 5
long 5

had 5
the 5
sound 5

political 5
interests 5
acting 5
through 5
the 5
schools 5

the 5
fairest 5
thing 5
we 5
can 5
experience 5

the 5
fundamental 5
emotion 5
which 5
stands 5
at 5
the 5
cradle 5
of 5
true 5

there 5

also 5
such 5

a 5
spirit 5
of 5

times 5
an 5
attitude 5

characteristic 5
of 5

particular 5
generation 5

is 5
passed 5
on 5
from 5
individual 5

individual 5
and 5
gives 5
a 5
society 5
its 5
particular 5
tone 5
each 5
of 5
us 5
has 5
to 5
do 5
his 5
little 5
bit 5
towards 5
transforming 5
this 5
spirit 5
of 5
the 5
times 5
compare 5
the 5
spirit 5
which 5
animated 5
the 5
youth 5
in 5
our 5
universities 5
a 5
hundred 5
years 5
ago 5
with 5
that 5
prevailing 5
today 5
they 5
had 5
faith 5
in 5
the 5
amelioration 5
of 5
human 5
society 5
respect 5
for 5
every 5
honest 5
opinion 5
the 5
tolerance 5
for 5
which 5
our 5
classics 5
had 5
lived 5
and 5
fought 5
in 5
those 5
days 5
men 5
strove 5
for 5
a 5
larger 5
political 5
unity 5
which 5
at 5
that 5
time 5
was 5
called 5
germany 5
it 5
was 5
the 5
students 5
and 5
the 5
teachers 5
at 5
the 5
universities 5
who 5
kept 5
these 5
ideals 5
alive 5
today 5
also 5
there 5
is 5
an 5
urge 5
towards 5
social 5
progress 5
towards 5
tolerance 5
and 5
freedom 5
of 5
thought 5
towards 5
a 5
larger 5
political 5
unity 5
which 5
we 5
today 5
call 5
europe 5
but 5
the 5
students 5
at 5
our 5
universities 5
have 5
ceased 5
as 5
completely 5
as 5
their 5
teachers 5
to 5
enshrine 5
the 5
hopes 5
and 5
ideals 5
of 5
the 5
nation 5
anyone 5
who 5
looks 5
at 5
our 5
times 5
coolly 5
and 5
dispassionately 5
must 5
admit 5
this 5
we 5
are 5
assembled 5
today 5
to 5
take 5
stock 5
of 5
ourselves 5
the 5
external 5
reason 5
for 5
this 5
meeting 5
is 5
the 5
gumbel 5
case 5
this 5
apostle 5
of 5
justice 5
has 5
written 5
about 5
unexpiated 5
political 5
crimes 5
with 5
devoted 5
industry 5
high 5
courage 5
and 5
exemplary 5
fairness 5
and 5
has 5
done 5
the 5
community 5
a 5
signal 5
service 5
by 5
his 5
books 5
and 5
this 5
is 5
the 5
man 5
whom 5
the 5
students 5
and 5
a 5
good 5
many 5
of 5
the 5
staff 5
of 5
his 5
university 5
are 5
today 5
doing 5
their 5
best 5
to 5
expel 5
political 5
passion 5
cannot 5
be 5
allowed 5
to 5
go 5
to 5
such 5
lengths 5
i 5
am 5
convinced 5
that 5
every 5
man 5
who 5
reads 5
herr 5
gumbels 5
books 5
with 5
an 5
open 5
mind 5
will 5
get 5
the 5
same 5
impression 5
from 5
them 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
men 5
like 5
him 5
are 5
needed 5
if 5
we 5
are 5
ever 5
to 5
build 5
up 5
a 5
healthy 5
political 5
society 5
let 5
every 5
man 5
judge 5
according 5
to 5
his 5
own 5
standards 5
by 5
what 5
he 5
has 5
himself 5
read 5
not 5
by 5
what 5
others 5
tell 5
him 5
if 5
that 5
happens 5
this 5
gumbel 5
case 5
after 5
an 5
unedifying 5
beginning 5
may 5
still 5
do 5
good 5
good 5
and 5
evil 5
it 5
is 5
right 5
in 5
principle 5
that 5
those 5
should 5
be 5
the 5
best 5
loved 5
who 5
have 5
contributed 5
most 5
to 5
the 5
elevation 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
and 5
human 5
life 5
but 5
if 5
one 5
goes 5
on 5
to 5
ask 5
who 5
they 5
are 5
one 5
finds 5
oneself 5
in 5
no 5
inconsiderable 5
difficulties 5
in 5
the 5
case 5
of 5
political 5
and 5
even 5
of 5
religious 5
leaders 5
it 5
is 5
often 5
very 5
doubtful 5
whether 5
they 5
have 5
done 5
more 5
good 5
or 5
harm 5
hence 5
i 5
most 5
seriously 5
believe 5
that 5
one 5
does 5
people 5
the 5
best 5
service 5
by 5
giving 5
them 5
some 5
elevating 5
work 5
to 5
do 5
and 5
thus 5
indirectly 5
elevating 5
them 5
this 5
applies 5
most 5
of 5
all 5
to 5
the 5
great 5
artist 5
but 5
also 5
in 5
a 5
lesser 5
degree 5
to 5
the 5
scientist 5
to 5
be 5
sure 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
the 5
fruits 5
of 5
scientific 5
research 5
that 5
elevate 5
a 5
man 5
and 5
enrich 5
his 5
nature 5
but 5
the 5
urge 5
to 5
understand 5
the 5
intellectual 5
work 5
creative 5
or 5
receptive 5
it 5
would 5
surely 5
be 5
absurd 5
to 5
judge 5
the 5
value 5
of 5
the 5
talmud 5
for 5
instance 5
by 5
its 5
intellectual 5
fruits 5
the 5
true 5
value 5
of 5
a 5
human 5
being 5
is 5
determined 5
primarily 5
by 5
the 5
measure 5
and 5
the 5
sense 5
in 5
which 5
he 5
has 5
attained 5
to 5
liberation 5
from 5
the 5
self 5
society 5
and 5
personality 5
when 5
we 5
survey 5
our 5
lives 5
and 5
endeavours 5
we 5
soon 5
observe 5
that 5
almost 5
the 5
whole 5
of 5
our 5
actions 5
and 5
desires 5
are 5
bound 5
up 5
with 5
the 5
existence 5
of 5
other 5
human 5
beings 5
we 5
see 5
that 5
our 5
whole 5
nature 5
resembles 5
that 5
of 5
the 5
social 5
animals 5
we 5
eat 5
food 5
that 5
others 5
have 5
grow 5
wear 5
clothes 5
that 5
others 5
have 5
made 5
live 5
in 5
houses 5
that 5
others 5
have 5
built 5
the 5
greater 5
part 5
of 5
our 5
knowledge 5
and 5
beliefs 5
has 5
been 5
communicated 5
to 5
us 5
by 5
other 5
people 5
through 5
the 5
medium 5
of 5
a 5
language 5
which 5
others 5
have 5
created 5
without 5
language 5
our 5
mental 5
capacities 5
wuuld 5
be 5
poor 5
indeed 5
comparable 5
to 5
those 5
of 5
the 5
higher 5
animals 5
we 5
have 5
therefore 5
to 5
admit 5
that 5
we 5
owe 5
our 5
principal 5
advantage 5
over 5
the 5
beasts 5
to 5
the 5
fact 5
of 5
living 5
in 5
human 5
society 5
the 5
individual 5
if 5
left 5
alone 5
from 5
birth 5
would 5
remain 5
primitive 5
and 5
beastlike 5
in 5
his 5
thoughts 5
and 5
feelings 5
to 5
a 5
degree 5
that 5
we 5
can 5
hardly 5
conceive 5
the 5
individual 5
is 5
what 5
he 5
is 5
and 5
has 5
the 5
significance 5
that 5
he 5
has 5
not 5
so 5
much 5
in 5
virtue 5
of 5
his 5
individuality 5
but 5
rather 5
as 5
a 5
member 5
of 5
a 5
great 5
human 5
society 5
which 5
directs 5
his 5
material 5
and 5
spiritual 5
existence 5
from 5
the 5
cradle 5
to 5
the 5
grave 5
a 5
mans 5
value 5
to 5
the 5
community 5
depends 5
primarily 5
on 5
how 5
far 5
his 5
feelings 5
thoughts 5
and 5
actions 5
are 5
directed 5
towards 5
promoting 5
the 5
good 5
of 5
his 5
fellows 5
we 5
call 5
him 5
good 5
or 5
bad 5
according 5
to 5
how 5
he 5
stands 5
in 5
this 5
matter 5
it 5
looks 5
at 5
first 5
sight 5
as 5
if 5
our 5
estimate 5
of 5
a 5
man 5
depended 5
entirely 5
on 5
his 5
social 5
qualities 5
and 5
yet 5
such 5
an 5
attitude 5
would 5
be 5
wrong 5
it 5
is 5
clear 5
that 5
all 5
the 5
valuable 5
things 5
material 5
spiritual 5
and 5
moral 5
which 5
we 5
receive 5
from 5
society 5
can 5
be 5
traced 5
back 5
through 5
countless 5
generations 5
to 5
certain 5
creative 5
individuals 5
the 5
use 5
of 5
fire 5
the 5
cultivation 5
of 5
edible 5
plants 5
the 5
steam 5
engineeach 5
was 5
discovered 5
by 5
one 5
man 5
only 5
the 5
individual 5
can 5
think 5
and 5
thereby 5
create 5
new 5
values 5
for 5
societynay 5
even 5
set 5
up 5
new 5
moral 5
standards 5
to 5
which 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
conforms 5
without 5
creative 5
independently 5
thinking 5
and 5
judging 5
personalities 5
the 5
upward 5
development 5
of 5
society 5
is 5
as 5
unthinkable 5
as 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
personality 5
without 5
the 5
nourishing 5
soil 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
the 5
health 5
of 5
society 5
thus 5
depends 5
quite 5
as 5
much 5
on 5
the 5
independence 5
of 5
the 5
individuals 5
composing 5
it 5
as 5
on 5
their 5
close 5
political 5

in 5

its 5
brilliant 5

in 5

put 5
an 5
end 5

on 5
the 5

and 5
comparative 5
isolation 5
of 5

let 5
us 5
now 5
consider 5
the 5
times 5
in 5
which 5
we 5
live 5
how 5
does 5
society 5
fare 5
how 5
the 5
individual 5
the 5
population 5
of 5
the 5
civilized 5
countries 5
is 5
extremely 5
dense 5
as 5
compared 5
with 5
former 5
times 5
europe 5
today 5
contains 5
about 5
three 5
times 5
as 5
many 5
people 5
as 5
it 5
did 5
a 5
hundred 5
years 5
ago 5
but 5
the 5
number 5
of 5
great 5
men 5
has 5
decreased 5
out 5
of 5
all 5
proportion 5
only 5
a 5
few 5
individuals 5
are 5
known 5
to 5
the 5
masses 5
as 5
personalities 5
through 5
their 5
creative 5
achievements 5
organization 5
has 5
to 5
some 5
extent 5
taken 5
the 5
place 5
of 5
the 5
great 5
man 5
particularly 5
in 5
the 5
technical 5
sphere 5
but 5
also 5
to 5
a 5
very 5
perceptible 5
extent 5
in 5
the 5
scientific 5
the 5
lack 5
of 5
outstanding 5
figures 5
is 5
particularly 5
striking 5
in 5
the 5
domain 5
of 5
art 5
painting 5
and 5
music 5
have 5
definitely 5
degenerated 5
and 5
largely 5
lost 5
their 5
popular 5
appeal 5
in 5
politics 5
not 5
only 5
are 5
leaders 5
lacking 5
but 5
the 5
independence 5
of 5
spent 5
and 5
the 5
sense 5
of 5
justice 5
of 5
the 5
citizen 5
have 5
to 5
a 5
great 5
extent 5
declined 5
the 5
democratic 5
parliamentarian 5
regime 5
which 5
is 5
based 5
on 5
such 5
independence 5
has 5
in 5
many 5
places 5
been 5
shaken 5
dictatorships 5
have 5
sprung 5
up 5
and 5
are 5
tolerated 5
because 5
mens 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
dignity 5
and 5
the 5
rights 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
is 5
no 5
longer 5
strong 5
enough 5
in 5
two 5
weeks 5
the 5
sheeplike 5
masses 5
can 5
be 5
worked 5
up 5
by 5
the 5
newspapers 5
into 5
such 5
a 5
state 5
of 5
excited 5
fury 5
that 5
the 5

are 5
prepared 5
to 5
put 5
on 5
uniform 5

to 5
me 5
the 5
most 5
disgraceful 5
symptom 5
of 5
that 5
deficiency 5

one 5
of 5
these 5
pessimists 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
better 5
times 5
are 5
coming 5
let 5
me 5
shortly 5
state 5
my 5
reasons 5
for 5
such 5
confidence 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
the 5
present 5
symptoms 5
of 5
decadence 5
are 5
explained 5
by 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
industry 5
and 5
machinery 5
has 5
made 5
the 5
struggle 5
for 5
existence 5
very 5
much 5
more 5
severe 5
greatly 5
to 5
the 5
detriment 5
of 5
the 5
free 5
development 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
but 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
machinery 5
means 5
that 5
less 5
and 5
less 5
work 5
is 5
needed 5
from 5
the 5
individual 5
for 5
the 5
satisfaction 5
of 5
the 5
communitys 5
needs 5
a 5
planned 5
division 5
of 5
labour 5
is 5
becoming 5
more 5
and 5
more 5
of 5
a 5
crying 5
necessity 5
and 5
this 5
division 5
will 5
lead 5
to 5
the 5
material 5
security 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
this 5
security 5
and 5
the 5
spare 5
time 5
and 5
energy 5
which 5
the 5
individual 5
will 5
have 5
at 5
his 5
command 5
can 5
be 5
made 5
to 5
further 5
his 5
development 5
in 5
this 5
way 5
the 5
community 5
may 5
regain 5
its 5
health 5
and 5
we 5
will 5
hope 5
that 5
future 5
historians 5
will 5
explain 5
the 5
morbid 5
symptoms 5
of 5
presentday 5
society 5
as 5
the 5
childhood 5
ailments 5
of 5
an 5
aspiring 5
humanity 5
due 5
entirely 5
to 5
the 5
excessive 5
speed 5

the 5
greatest 5
and 5
noblest 5
man 5
of 5

was 5
the 5

which 5
lighted 5
the 5
way 5
from 5
the 5

of 5

the 5

of 5
contemporary 5

the 5
fabric 5
of 5
which 5
he 5
contributed 5
valuable 5
materials 5
and 5
methods 5
his 5
life 5
was 5
ordered 5
like 5
a 5
work 5
of 5
art 5
down 5
to 5
the 5
smallest 5
detail 5
his 5
neverfailing 5
kindness 5
and 5
magnanimity 5
and 5

sense 5

justice 5
coupled 5
with 5
an 5
intuitive 5
understanding 5
of 5
people 5

him 5

he 5
entered 5
everyone 5
followed 5

gladly 5
for 5
they 5
felt 5
that 5
he 5
never 5
set 5
out 5
to 5
dominate 5

always 5
simply 5
to 5
be 5
of 5

in 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
international 5
cooperation 5
with 5
the 5
extensive 5
specialization 5
of 5
scientific 5
research 5
which 5
the 5
nineteenth 5
century 5
brought 5
about 5
it 5
has 5
become 5
rare 5
for 5
a 5
man 5
occupying 5
a 5
leading 5
position 5
in 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
sciences 5
to 5
manage 5
at 5
the 5

do 5
valuable 5
service 5
to 5

the 5
sphere 5
of 5
international 5

such 5
service 5
demands 5
not 5
only 5
energy 5
insight 5
and 5
a 5
reputation 5
based 5
on 5
solid 5
achievements 5
but 5
also 5
a 5
freedom 5
from 5
national 5
prejudice 5
and 5
a 5
devotion 5
to 5
the 5
common 5
ends 5
of 5
all 5
which 5
have 5
become 5
rare 5
in 5
our 5
times 5
i 5
have 5
met 5
no 5
one 5
who 5
combined 5
all 5
these 5
qualities 5
in 5
himself 5
so 5
perfectly 5
as 5
h 5
a 5
lorentz 5
the 5
marvellous 5
thing 5
about 5
the 5
effect 5
of 5
his 5
personality 5
was 5
this 5
independent 5
and 5
headstrong 5
natures 5
such 5
as 5
are 5
particularly 5
common 5
among 5
men 5
of 5
learning 5
do 5
not 5
readily 5
bow 5
to 5
anothers 5
will 5
and 5
for 5
the 5
most 5
part 5
only 5
accept 5
his 5
leadership 5
grudgingly 5
but 5
when 5
lorentz 5
is 5
in 5
the 5
presidential 5
chair 5
an 5
atmosphere 5
of 5
happy 5
cooperation 5
is 5
invariably 5
created 5
however 5
much 5
those 5
present 5
may 5
differ 5
in 5
their 5
aims 5
and 5
habits 5
of 5
thought 5
the 5
secret 5
of 5
this 5
success 5
lies 5
not 5
only 5
in 5
his 5
swift 5
comprehension 5
of 5
people 5
and 5
things 5
and 5
his 5
marvellous 5
command 5
of 5
language 5
but 5
above 5
all 5
in 5
this 5
that 5
one 5
feels 5
that 5
his 5
whole 5
heart 5
is 5
in 5
the 5
business 5
in 5
hand 5
and 5
that 5
when 5
he 5
is 5
at 5
work 5
he 5
has 5
room 5
for 5
nothing 5
else 5
in 5
his 5
mind 5
nothing 5
disarms 5
the 5
recalcitrant 5
so 5
much 5
as 5
this 5
before 5
the 5
war 5
lorentzs 5
activities 5
in 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
international 5
relations 5
were 5
confined 5
to 5
presiding 5
at 5
congresses 5
of 5
physicists 5
particularly 5
noteworthy 5
among 5
these 5
were 5
the 5
solvay 5
congresses 5
the 5
first 5
two 5
of 5
which 5
were 5
held 5
at 5
brussels 5
in 5
and 5
then 5
came 5
the 5
european 5
war 5
which 5
was 5
a 5
crushing 5
blow 5
to 5
all 5
who 5
had 5
the 5
improvement 5
of 5
human 5
relations 5
in 5
general 5
at 5
heart 5
even 5
before 5
the 5
war 5
was 5
over 5
and 5
still 5
more 5
after 5
its 5
end 5
lorentz 5
devoted 5
himself 5
to 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
reconciliation 5
his 5
efforts 5
were 5
especially 5
directed 5
towards 5
the 5
reestablishment 5
of 5
fruitful 5
and 5
friendly 5
cooperation 5
between 5
men 5
of 5
learning 5
and 5
scientific 5
societies 5
an 5
outsider 5
can 5
hardly 5
conceive 5
what 5
uphill 5
work 5
this 5
is 5
the 5
accumulated 5
resentment 5
of 5
the 5
war 5
period 5
has 5
not 5
yet 5
died 5
down 5
and 5
many 5
influential 5
men 5
persist 5
in 5
the 5
irreconcilable 5
attitude 5
into 5
which 5
they 5
allowed 5
themselves 5
to 5
be 5
driven 5
by 5
the 5
pressure 5
of 5
circumstances 5
hence 5
lorentzs 5
efforts 5
resemble 5
those 5
of 5
a 5
doctor 5
with 5
a 5
recalcitrant 5
patient 5
who 5
refuses 5
to 5
take 5
the 5
medicines 5
carefully 5
prepared 5
for 5
his 5
benefit 5
but 5
lorentz 5
is 5
not 5
to 5
be 5
deterred 5
once 5
he 5
has 5
recognized 5
a 5
course 5
of 5
action 5
as 5
the 5
right 5
one 5
the 5
moment 5
the 5
war 5
was 5
over 5
he 5
joined 5
the 5
governing 5
body 5
of 5
the 5
conseil 5
de 5
recherche 5
which 5
was 5
founded 5
by 5
the 5
savants 5
of 5
the 5
victorious 5
countries 5
and 5
from 5
which 5
the 5
savants 5
and 5
learned 5
societies 5
of 5
the 5
central 5
powers 5
were 5
excluded 5
his 5
object 5
in 5
taking 5
this 5
step 5
which 5
caused 5
great 5
offence 5
to 5
the 5
academic 5
world 5
of 5
the 5
central 5
powers 5
was 5
to 5
influence 5
this 5
institution 5
in 5
such 5
a 5
way 5
that 5
it 5
could 5
be 5
expanded 5
into 5
something 5
truly 5
international 5
he 5
and 5
other 5
rightminded 5
men 5
succeeded 5
after 5
repeated 5
efforts 5
in 5
securing 5
the 5
removal 5
of 5
the 5
offensive 5
exclusionclause 5
from 5
the 5
statutes 5
of 5
the 5
conseil 5
the 5
goal 5
which 5
is 5
the 5
restoration 5
of 5
normal 5
and 5
fruitful 5
cooperation 5
between 5
learned 5
societies 5
is 5
however 5
not 5
yet 5
attained 5
because 5
the 5
academic 5
world 5
of 5
the 5
central 5
powers 5
exasperated 5
by 5
nearly 5
ten 5
years 5
of 5
exclusion 5
from 5
practically 5
all 5
international 5
gatherings 5
has 5
got 5
into 5
a 5
habit 5
of 5
keeping 5
itself 5
to 5
itself 5
now 5
however 5
there 5
are 5
good 5
grounds 5
for 5
hoping 5
that 5
the 5
ice 5
will 5
soon 5
be 5
broken 5
thanks 5
to 5
the 5
tactful 5
efforts 5
of 5
lorentz 5
prompted 5
by 5
pure 5
enthusiasm 5
for 5
the 5
good 5
cause 5
lorentz 5
has 5
also 5
devoted 5
his 5
energies 5
to 5
the 5
service 5
of 5
international 5
cultural 5
ends 5
in 5
another 5
way 5
by 5
consenting 5
to 5
serve 5
on 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
commission 5
for 5
international 5
intellectual 5
cooperation 5
which 5
was 5
called 5
into 5
existence 5
some 5
five 5
years 5
ago 5
with 5
bergson 5
as 5
chairman 5
for 5
the 5
last 5
year 5
lorentz 5
has 5
presided 5
over 5
the 5
commission 5
which 5
with 5
the 5
active 5
support 5
of 5
its 5
subordinate 5
the 5
paris 5
institute 5
is 5
to 5
act 5
as 5
a 5
gobetween 5
in 5
the 5
domain 5
of 5
intellectual 5
and 5
artistic 5
work 5
among 5
the 5
various 5
spheres 5
of 5

there 5
too 5
the 5
beneficent 5
influence 5
of 5
this 5
intelligent 5
humane 5
and 5
modest 5
personality 5
whose 5
unspoken 5
but 5
faithfully 5
followed 5
advice 5
is 5
not 5
mastery 5
but 5
service 5
will 5
lead 5
people 5
in 5
the 5
right 5
way 5
may 5
his 5
example 5
contribute 5
to 5
the 5
triumph 5
of 5

honour 5

seventieth 5

arnold 5
berliner 5
is 5
the 5
editor 5
of 5
the 5
periodical 5
die 5
naturrvissenschaften 5
i 5
should 5
like 5
to 5
take 5
this 5
opportunity 5
of 5
telling 5
my 5
friend 5
berliner 5
and 5
the 5
readers 5
of 5
this 5
paper 5
why 5
i 5
rate 5
him 5
and 5
his 5
work 5
so 5
highly 5
it 5
has 5
to 5
be 5
done 5
here 5
because 5
it 5
is 5
ones 5
only 5
chance 5
of 5
getting 5
such 5
things 5
said 5
since 5
our 5
training 5
in 5
objectivity 5
has 5
led 5
to 5
a 5
taboo 5
on 5
everything 5
personal 5
which 5
we 5
mortals 5
may 5
transgress 5
only 5
on 5
quite 5
exceptional 5
occasions 5
such 5
as 5
the 5
present 5
one 5
and 5
now 5
after 5
this 5
dash 5
for 5
liberty 5
back 5
to 5
the 5
objective 5
the 5
province 5
of 5
scientifically 5
determined 5
fact 5
has 5
been 5
enormously 5
extended 5
theoretical 5
knowledge 5
has 5
become 5
vastly 5
more 5
profound 5
in 5
every 5
department 5
of 5
science 5
but 5
the 5
assimilative 5
power 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
intellect 5
is 5
and 5
remains 5
strictly 5
limited 5
hence 5
it 5
was 5
inevitable 5
that 5
the 5
activity 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
investigator 5
should 5
be 5
confined 5
to 5
a 5
smaller 5
and 5
smaller 5
section 5
of 5
human 5
knowledge 5
worse 5
still 5
as 5
a 5
result 5
of 5
this 5
specialization 5
it 5
is 5
becoming 5
increasingly 5
difficult 5
for 5
even 5
a 5
rough 5
general 5
grasp 5
of 5
science 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
without 5
which 5
the 5
true 5
spirit 5
of 5
research 5
is 5
inevitably 5
handicapped 5
to 5
keep 5
pace 5
with 5
progress 5
a 5
situation 5
is 5
developing 5
similar 5
to 5
the 5
one 5
symbolically 5
represented 5
in 5
the 5
bible 5
by 5
the 5
story 5
of 5
the 5
tower 5
of 5
babel 5
every 5
serious 5
scientific 5
worker 5
is 5
painfully 5
conscious 5
of 5
this 5
involuntary 5
relegation 5
to 5
an 5
evernarrowing 5
sphere 5
of 5
knowledge 5
which 5
is 5
threatening 5
to 5
deprive 5
the 5
investigator 5
of 5
his 5
broad 5
horizon 5
and 5
degrade 5
him 5
to 5
the 5
level 5
of 5
a 5
mechanic 5
we 5
have 5
all 5
suffered 5
under 5
this 5
evil 5
without 5
making 5
any 5
effort 5
to 5
mitigate 5
it 5
but 5
berliner 5
has 5
come 5
to 5
the 5
rescue 5
as 5
far 5
as 5
the 5
germanspeaking 5
world 5
is 5
concerned 5
in 5
the 5
most 5
admirable 5
way 5
he 5
saw 5
that 5
the 5
existing 5
popular 5
periodicals 5
were 5
sufficient 5
to 5
instruct 5
and 5
stimulate 5
the 5
layman 5
but 5
he 5
also 5
saw 5
that 5
a 5
firstclass 5
welledited 5
organ 5
was 5
needed 5
for 5
the 5
guidance 5
of 5
the 5
scientific 5
worker 5
who 5
desired 5
to 5
be 5
put 5
sufficiently 5
au 5
courant 5
of 5
developments 5
in 5
scientific 5
problems 5
methods 5
and 5
results 5
to 5
be 5
able 5
to 5
form 5
a 5
judgment 5
of 5
his 5
own 5
through 5
many 5
years 5
of 5
hard 5
work 5
he 5
has 5
devoted 5
himself 5
to 5
this 5
object 5
with 5
great 5
intelligence 5
and 5
no 5
less 5
great 5
determination 5
and 5
done 5
us 5
all 5
and 5
science 5
a 5
service 5
for 5
which 5
we 5
cannot 5
be 5
too 5
grateful 5
it 5
was 5
necessary 5
for 5
him 5
to 5
secure 5
the 5
cooperation 5
of 5
successful 5
scientific 5
writers 5
and 5
induce 5
them 5
to 5
say 5
what 5
they 5
had 5
to 5
say 5
in 5
a 5
form 5
as 5
far 5
as 5
possible 5
intelligible 5
to 5
nonspecialists 5
he 5
has 5
often 5
told 5
me 5
of 5
the 5
fights 5
he 5
had 5
in 5
pursuing 5
this 5
object 5
the 5
difficulties 5
of 5
which 5
he 5
once 5
described 5
to 5
me 5
in 5
the 5
following 5
riddle 5
question 5
what 5
is 5
a 5
scientific 5
author 5
answer 5
a 5
cross 5
between 5
a 5
mimosa 5
and 5
a 5
porcupine 5
berliners 5
achievement 5
would 5
have 5
been 5
impossible 5
but 5
for 5
the 5
peculiar 5
intensity 5
of 5
his 5
longing 5
for 5
a 5
clear 5
comprehensive 5
view 5
of 5
the 5
largest 5
possible 5
area 5
of 5
scientific 5
country 5
this 5
feeling 5
also 5
drove 5
him 5
to 5
produce 5
a 5
textbook 5
of 5
physics 5
the 5
fruit 5
of 5
many 5
years 5
of 5
strenuous 5
work 5
of 5
which 5
a 5
medical 5
student 5
said 5
to 5
me 5
the 5
other 5

i 5
dont 5
know 5
how 5
i 5
should 5
ever 5
have 5
got 5
a 5
clear 5
idea 5
of 5
the 5
principles 5
of 5
modern 5
physics 5
in 5
the 5
time 5
at 5
my 5
disposal 5

this 5
book 5
berliners 5
fight 5
for 5
clarity 5
and 5
comprehensiveness 5
of 5
outlook 5
has 5
done 5
a 5
great 5
deal 5
to 5
bring 5
the 5
problems 5
methods 5
and 5
results 5
of 5
science 5

to 5
many 5

the 5
scientific 5

of 5
our 5
time 5
is 5
simply 5
inconceivable 5
vzthout 5
his 5
paper 5
it 5
is 5
just 5
as 5
important 5
to 5
make 5
knowledge 5
live 5
and 5
to 5
keep 5
it 5
alive 5
as 5
to 5
solve 5
specific 5

who 5
embody 5
the 5

that 5

is 5

for 5
the 5
fate 5

obituary 5
of 5
the 5
surgeon 5
m 5
katzenstein 5
during 5
the 5
eighteen 5
years 5
i 5
spent 5
in 5
berlin 5
i 5
had 5
few 5
close 5
friends 5
and 5
the 5
closest 5
was 5
professor 5
katzenstein 5
for 5
more 5
than 5
ten 5
years 5
i 5
spent 5
my 5
leisure 5
hours 5
during 5
the 5
summer 5
months 5
with 5
him 5
mostly 5
on 5
his 5
delightful 5
yacht 5
there 5
we 5
confided 5
our 5
experiences 5
ambitions 5
emotions 5
to 5
each 5
other 5
we 5
both 5
felt 5
that 5
this 5
friendship 5
was 5
not 5
only 5
a 5
blessing 5
because 5
each 5
understood 5
the 5
other 5
was 5
enriched 5
by 5
him 5
and 5
found 5
ins 5
him 5
that 5
responsive 5
echo 5
so 5
essential 5
to 5
anybody 5
who 5
is 5
truly 5
alive 5
it 5
also 5
helped 5
to 5
make 5
both 5
of 5
us 5
more 5
independent 5
of 5
external 5
experience 5
to 5
objectivize 5
it 5
more 5
easily 5
i 5
was 5
a 5
free 5
man 5
bound 5
neither 5
by 5
many 5
duties 5
nor 5
by 5
harassing 5
responsibilities 5
my 5
friend 5
on 5
the 5
contrary 5
was 5
never 5
free 5
from 5
the 5
grip 5
of 5
urgent 5
duties 5
and 5
anxious 5
fears 5
for 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
those 5
in 5
peril 5
if 5
as 5
was 5
invariably 5
the 5
case 5
he 5
had 5
performed 5
some 5
dangerous 5
operations 5
in 5
the 5
morning 5
he 5
would 5
ring 5
up 5
on 5
the 5
telephone 5
immediately 5
before 5
we 5
got 5
into 5
the 5
boat 5
to 5
enquire 5
after 5
the 5
condition 5
of 5
the 5
patients 5
about 5
whom 5
he 5
was 5
worried 5
i 5
could 5
see 5
how 5
deeply 5
concerned 5
he 5
was 5
for 5
the 5
lives 5
entrusted 5
to 5
his 5
care 5
it 5
was 5
marvellous 5
that 5
this 5
shackled 5
outward 5
existence 5
did 5
not 5
clip 5
the 5
wings 5
of 5
his 5
soul 5
his 5
imagination 5
and 5
his 5
sense 5
of 5
humour 5
were 5
irrepressible 5
he 5
never 5
became 5
the 5
typical 5
conscientious 5
north 5
german 5
whom 5
the 5
italians 5
in 5
the 5
days 5
of 5
their 5
freedom 5
used 5
to 5
call 5
bestia 5
seriosa 5
he 5
was 5
sensitive 5
as 5
a 5
youth 5
to 5
the 5
tonic 5
beauty 5
of 5
the 5
lakes 5
and 5
woods 5
of 5
brandenburg 5
and 5
as 5
he 5
sailed 5
the 5
boat 5
with 5
an 5
expert 5
hand 5
through 5
these 5
beloved 5
and 5
familiar 5
surroundings 5
he 5
opened 5
the 5
secret 5
treasurechamber 5
of 5
his 5
heart 5
to 5
mehe 5
spoke 5
of 5
his 5
experiments 5
scientific 5
ideas 5
and 5
ambitions 5
how 5
he 5
found 5
time 5
and 5
energy 5
for 5
them 5
was 5
always 5
a 5
mystery 5
to 5
me 5
but 5
the 5
passion 5
for 5
scientific 5
enquiry 5
is 5
not 5
to 5
be 5
crushed 5
by 5
any 5
burdens 5
the 5
man 5
who 5
is 5
possessed 5
with 5
it 5
perishes 5
sooner 5
than 5
it 5
does 5
there 5
were 5
two 5
types 5
of 5
problems 5
that 5
engaged 5
his 5
attention 5
the 5
first 5
forced 5
itself 5
on 5
him 5
out 5
of 5
the 5
necessities 5
of 5
his 5
practice 5
thus 5
he 5
was 5
always 5
thinking 5
out 5
new 5
ways 5
of 5
inducing 5
healthy 5
muscles 5
to 5
take 5
the 5
place 5
of 5
lost 5
ones 5
by 5
ingenious 5
transplantation 5
of 5
tendons 5
he 5
found 5
this 5
remarkably 5
easy 5
as 5
he 5
possessed 5
an 5
uncommonly 5
strong 5
spatial 5
imagination 5
and 5
a 5
remarkably 5
sure 5
feeling 5
for 5
mechanism 5
how 5
happy 5
he 5
was 5
when 5
he 5
had 5
succeeded 5
in 5
making 5
somebody 5
fit 5
for 5
normal 5
life 5
by 5
putting 5
right 5
the 5
muscular 5
system 5
of 5
his 5
face 5
foot 5
or 5
arm 5
and 5
the 5
same 5
when 5
he 5
avoided 5
an 5
operation 5
even 5
in 5
cases 5
which 5
had 5
been 5
sent 5
to 5
him 5
by 5
physicians 5
for 5
surgical 5
treatment 5
in 5
cases 5
of 5
gastric 5
ulcer 5
by 5
neutralizing 5
the 5
pepsin 5
he 5
also 5
set 5
great 5
store 5
by 5
the 5
treatment 5
of 5
peritonitis 5
by 5
an 5
antitoxic 5
coliserum 5
which 5
he 5
discovered 5
and 5
rejoiced 5
in 5
the 5
successes 5
he 5
achieved 5
with 5
it 5
in 5
talking 5
of 5
it 5
he 5
often 5
lamented 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
this 5
method 5
of 5
treatment 5
was 5
not 5
endorsed 5
by 5
his 5
colleagues 5
the 5
second 5
group 5
of 5
problems 5
had 5
to 5
do 5
with 5
the 5
common 5
conception 5
of 5
an 5
antagonism 5
between 5
different 5
sorts 5
of 5
tissue 5
he 5
believed 5
that 5
he 5
was 5
here 5
on 5
the 5
track 5
of 5
a 5
general 5
biological 5
principle 5
of 5
widest 5
application 5
whose 5
implications 5
he 5
followed 5
out 5
with 5
admirable 5
boldness 5
and 5
persistence 5
starting 5
out 5
from 5
this 5
basic 5
notion 5
he 5
discovered 5
that 5
osteomyelon 5
and 5
periosteum 5
prevent 5
each 5
others 5
growth 5
if 5
they 5
are 5
not 5
separated 5
from 5
each 5
other 5
by 5
bone 5
in 5
this 5
way 5
he 5
succeeded 5
in 5
explaining 5
hitherto 5
inexplicable 5
cases 5
of 5
wounds 5
ailing 5
to 5
heal 5
and 5
in 5
bringing 5
about 5
a 5
cure 5
this 5
general 5
notion 5
of 5
the 5
antagonism 5
of 5
the 5
tissues 5
especially 5
of 5
epithelium 5
and 5
connective 5
tissue 5
was 5
the 5
subject 5
to 5
which 5
he 5
devoted 5
his 5
scientific 5
energies 5
especially 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
ten 5
years 5
of 5
his 5
life 5
experiments 5
on 5
animals 5
and 5
a 5
systematic 5
investigation 5
of 5
the 5
growth 5
of 5
tissues 5
in 5
a 5
nutrient 5
fluid 5
were 5
carried 5
out 5
side 5
by 5
side 5
how 5
thankful 5
he 5
was 5
with 5
his 5
hands 5
tied 5
as 5
they 5
were 5
by 5
his 5
duties 5
to 5
have 5
found 5
such 5
an 5
admirable 5
and 5
infinitely 5
enthusiastic 5
fellowworker 5
in 5
frlein 5
knake 5
he 5
succeeded 5
in 5
securing 5
wonderful 5
results 5
bearing 5
on 5
the 5
factors 5
which 5
favour 5
the 5
growth 5
of 5
epithelium 5
at 5
the 5
expense 5
of 5
that 5
of 5
connective 5
tissue 5
results 5
which 5
may 5
well 5
be 5
of 5
decisive 5
importance 5
for 5
the 5
study 5
of 5
cancer 5
he 5
also 5
had 5
the 5
pleasure 5
of 5
inspiring 5
his 5
own 5
son 5
to 5
become 5
his 5
intelligent 5
and 5
independent 5
fellowworker 5
and 5
of 5
exciting 5
the 5
warm 5
interest 5
and 5
cooperation 5
of 5
sauerbruch 5
just 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
years 5
of 5
his 5
life 5
so 5
that 5
he 5
was 5
able 5
to 5
die 5
with 5
the 5
consoling 5
thought 5
that 5
his 5
lifes 5
work 5
would 5
not 5
perish 5
but 5
would 5
be 5
vigorously 5
continued 5
on 5
the 5
lines 5
he 5
had 5
laid 5
down 5
i 5
for 5
my 5
part 5
am 5
grateful 5
to 5

intellectual 5

spiritual 5
life 5
which 5
is 5
in 5
peculiar 5
danger 5
today 5
owing 5
to 5
a 5
variety 5
of 5
circumstances 5
exaggerated 5
respect 5
for 5

an 5
excess 5

with 5
it 5
the 5
increased 5
severity 5
of 5
the 5
struggle 5
for 5
existence 5
due 5
to 5
the 5
economic 5
crisis 5
the 5
brutalization 5
of 5
political 5
lifeall 5
these 5
factors 5
are 5
hostile 5
to 5
the 5
ripening 5
of 5

and 5
the 5
desire 5
for 5
real 5
culture 5
and 5
stamp 5
our 5
age 5
as 5
barbarous 5
materialistic 5
and 5
superficial 5
specialization 5
in 5
every 5
sphere 5
of 5
intellectual 5
work 5
is 5
producing 5
an 5
everwidening 5
gulf 5
between 5
the 5
intellectual 5
worker 5
and 5
the 5
nonspecialist 5
which 5
makes 5
it 5
more 5
difficult 5
for 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
the 5
nation 5
to 5
be 5
fertilized 5
and 5
enriched 5
by 5
the 5
achievements 5
of 5

and 5
science 5
but 5
contact 5
between 5
the 5
intellectual 5
and 5
the 5
masses 5
must 5
not 5
be 5
lost 5
it 5
is 5
necessary 5
for 5
the 5
elevation 5
of 5
society 5
and 5
no 5
less 5
so 5
for 5
renewing 5
the 5
strength 5
of 5
the 5
intellectual 5
worker 5
for 5
the 5
flower 5
of 5
science 5
does 5
not 5
grow 5
in 5
the 5
desert 5
for 5
this 5
reason 5
you 5
herr 5
solf 5
have 5
devoted 5
a 5
portion 5
of 5
your 5
energies 5
to 5
lessing 5
college 5
and 5
we 5
are 5
grateful 5
to 5
you 5
for 5
doing 5
so 5
and 5
we 5
wish 5
you 5
further 5
success 5
and 5
happiness 5
in 5
your 5
work 5
for 5
this 5
noble 5
cause 5
of 5
wealth 5
i 5
am 5
absolutely 5
convinced 5
that 5
no 5
wealth 5
in 5
the 5
world 5
can 5
help 5
humanity 5
forward 5
even 5
in 5

hands 5
of 5
the 5
most 5
devoted 5
worker 5
in 5
this 5
cause 5
the 5
example 5
of 5
great 5
and 5
pure 5
characters 5
is 5
the 5
only 5
thing 5
that 5
can 5
produce 5
fine 5
ideas 5
and 5
noble 5
deeds 5
money 5
only 5
appeals 5
to 5
selfishness 5
and 5
always 5
tempts 5
its 5
owners 5
irresistibly 5
to 5
abuse 5
it 5
can 5
anyone 5
imagine 5
moses 5
jesus 5
or 5

a 5
letter 5
dear 5
miss 5
i 5
have 5
read 5
about 5
sixteen 5
pages 5
of 5
your 5
manuscript 5
and 5
it 5
made 5
mesmile 5
it 5
is 5
clever 5
well 5
observed 5
honest 5
it 5
stands 5
on 5
its 5
own 5
feet 5
up 5
to 5
a 5
point 5
and 5
yet 5
it 5
is 5
so 5
typically 5
feminine 5
by 5
which 5
i 5
mean 5
derivative 5
and 5
vitiated 5
by 5
personal 5
rancour 5
i 5
suffered 5
exactly 5
the 5
same 5
treatment 5
at 5
the 5
hands 5
of 5
my 5
teachers 5
who 5
disliked 5
me 5
for 5
my 5
independence 5
and 5
passed 5
me 5
over 5
when 5
they 5
wanted 5
assistants 5
i 5
must 5
admit 5
that 5
i 5
was 5
somewhat 5
less 5
of 5
a 5
model 5
student 5
than 5
you 5
but 5
it 5
would 5
not 5
have 5
been 5
worth 5
my 5
while 5
to 5
write 5
anything 5
about 5
my 5
school 5
life 5
still 5
less 5
would 5
i 5
have 5
liked 5
to 5
be 5
responsible 5
for 5
anyones 5
printing 5
or 5
actually 5
reading 5
it 5
besides 5
one 5
always 5
cuts 5
a 5
poor 5
figure 5
if 5
one 5
complains 5
about 5
others 5
who 5
are 5
struggling 5
for 5
their 5
place 5
in 5
the 5
sun 5
too 5
after 5
their 5
own 5
fashion 5
therefore 5
pocket 5
your 5
temperament 5
and 5
keep 5
your 5
manuscript 5
for 5
your 5
sons 5
and 5
daughters 5
m 5
order 5
that 5
they 5
may 5
derive 5
consolation 5
from 5
it 5
andnot 5
give 5
a 5
damn 5
for 5
what 5
their 5
teachers 5
tell 5
them 5
or 5
think 5
of 5
them 5
incidentally 5
i 5
am 5
only 5
coming 5
to 5
princeton 5
to 5
research 5
not 5
to 5
teach 5
there 5
is 5
too 5
much 5
education 5
altogether 5
especially 5
in 5
american 5
schools 5
the 5
only 5
rational 5
way 5
of 5
educating 5
is 5
to 5
be 5
an 5
exampleof 5
what 5
to 5
avoid 5
if 5
one 5
cant 5
be 5
the 5
other 5

my 5
message 5
of 5
greeting 5
from 5
all 5
this 5
distance 5
bethink 5
you 5
that 5
ours 5
is 5
the 5
first 5
age 5
in 5
history 5
to 5
bring 5
about 5
friendly 5
and 5
understanding 5
intercourse 5
between 5
people 5
of 5
different 5
countries 5
in 5
former 5
times 5
nations 5
passed 5
their 5
lives 5
in 5
mutual 5
ignorance 5
and 5
in 5
fact 5
hated 5
or 5
feared 5
one 5
another 5
may 5
the 5
spirit 5
of 5
brotherly 5
understanding 5
gain 5
ground 5
more 5
and 5
more 5
among 5
them 5
with 5
this 5
in 5
mind 5
i 5
an 5
old 5
man 5
greet 5
you 5
japanese 5
schoolchildren 5
from 5
afar 5
and 5
hope 5
that 5
your 5
generation 5
may 5
some 5
day 5
put 5
mine 5
to 5
shame 5
teachers 5
and 5
pupils 5
an 5
address 5
to 5
children 5
the 5
principal 5
art 5
of 5
the 5
teacher 5
is 5
to 5
awaken 5
the 5
joy 5
in 5
creation 5
and 5
knowledge 5
my 5
dear 5
children 5
i 5
rejoice 5
to 5
see 5
you 5
before 5
me 5
today 5
happy 5
youth 5
of 5
a 5
sunny 5
and 5
fortunate 5
land 5
bear 5
in 5
mind 5
that 5
the 5
wonderful 5
things 5
you 5
learn 5
in 5
your 5
schools 5
are 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
many 5
generations 5
produced 5
by 5
enthusiastic 5
effort 5
and 5
infinite 5
labour 5
in 5
every 5
country 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
all 5
this 5
is 5
put 5
into 5
your 5
hands 5
as 5
your 5
inheritance 5
in 5
order 5
that 5
you 5
may 5
receive 5
it 5
honour 5
it 5
add 5
to 5
it 5
and 5
one 5
day 5
faithfully 5
hand 5
it 5
on 5
to 5
your 5
children 5
thus 5
do 5
we 5
mortals 5
achieve 5
immortality 5
in 5
the 5
permanent 5
things 5
which 5
we 5
create 5
in 5
common 5
if 5
you 5
always 5
keep 5
that 5
in 5
mind 5
you 5
will 5
find 5
a 5
meaning 5
in 5
life 5
and 5
work 5
and 5
acquire 5
the 5
right 5
attitude 5
towards 5
other 5
nations 5
and 5
ages 5
paradise 5
lost 5
as 5
late 5
as 5
the 5
seventeenth 5
century 5
the 5
savants 5
and 5
artists 5
of 5
all 5
europe 5
were 5
so 5
closely 5
united 5
by 5
the 5
bond 5
of 5
a 5
common 5
ideal 5
that 5
cooperation 5
between 5
them 5
was 5
scarcely 5
affected 5
by 5
political 5
events 5
this 5
unity 5
was 5
further 5
strengthened 5
by 5
the 5
general 5
use 5
of 5
the 5
latin 5
language 5
today 5
we 5
look 5
back 5
at 5
this 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
as 5
at 5
a 5
lost 5
paradise 5
the 5
passions 5
of 5
nationalism 5
have 5
destroyed 5
this 5
community 5
of 5
the 5
intellect 5
and 5
the 5
latin 5
language 5
which 5
once 5
united 5
the 5
whole 5
world 5
is 5
dead 5
the 5
men 5
of 5
learning 5
have 5
become 5
the 5
chief 5
mouthpieces 5
of 5
national 5
tradition 5
and 5
lost 5
their 5
sense 5
of 5
an 5
intellectual 5
commonwealth 5
nowadays 5
we 5
are 5
faced 5
with 5
the 5
curious 5
fact 5
that 5
the 5
politicians 5
the 5
practical 5
men 5
of 5
affairs 5
have 5
become 5
the 5
exponents 5
of 5
international 5
ideas 5
it 5
is 5
they 5
who 5
have 5
created 5

everything 5
that 5
the 5

constantly 5
in 5

one 5

to 5
understand 5
spiritual 5
movements 5

their 5

itself 5
to 5
us 5
now 5
what 5
are 5
the 5
feelings 5

that 5
have 5
led 5

the 5

sense 5
of 5
the 5

little 5

will 5
suffice 5
to 5
show 5
us 5
that 5
the 5
most 5

over 5
the 5

in 5
an 5

by 5
the 5
formation 5

moral 5
conception 5

the 5
jewish 5
scriptures 5
admirably 5
illustrate 5
the 5
development 5
from 5
the 5
religion 5

fear 5
to 5
moral 5
religion 5

the 5
development 5
from 5
a 5
religion 5

moral 5
religion 5
is 5
a 5
great 5
step 5
in 5
a 5
nations 5
life 5
that 5
primitive 5
religions 5
are 5
based 5
entirely 5
on 5
fear 5
and 5
the 5
religions 5
of 5
civilized 5
peoples 5
purely 5
on 5
morality 5
is 5
a 5
prejudice 5
against 5
which 5
we 5
must 5
be 5
on 5
our 5
guard 5
the 5
truth 5
is 5
that 5
they 5
are 5
all 5
intermediate 5
types 5
with 5
this 5
reservation 5
that 5
on 5
the 5
higher 5
levels 5
of 5
social 5
life 5
the 5
religion 5
of 5
morality 5
predominates 5
common 5
to 5
all 5
these 5
types 5
is 5
the 5
anthropomorphic 5
character 5
of 5
their 5
conception 5
of 5
god 5
only 5
individuals 5
of 5
exceptional 5
endowments 5
and 5
exceptionally 5
highminded 5
communities 5
as 5
a 5
general 5
rule 5
get 5
in 5
any 5
real 5
sense 5
beyond 5
this 5
level 5
but 5
there 5
is 5
a 5
third 5
state 5
of 5
religious 5
experience 5
which 5
belongs 5
to 5
all 5
of 5
them 5
even 5
though 5
it 5
is 5
rarely 5
found 5
in 5
a 5
pure 5
form 5
and 5
which 5
i 5
will 5
call 5
cosmic 5
religious 5
feeling 5
it 5
is 5
very 5
difficult 5
to 5
explain 5
this 5
feeling 5
to 5
anyone 5
who 5
is 5
entirely 5
without 5
it 5
especially 5
as 5
there 5
is 5
no 5
anthropomorphic 5
conception 5
of 5
god 5
corresponding 5
to 5
it 5
the 5
individual 5
feels 5
the 5
nothingness 5
of 5
human 5
desires 5
and 5
aims 5
and 5
the 5
sublimity 5
and 5
marvellous 5
order 5
which 5
reveal 5
themselves 5
both 5
in 5
nature 5
and 5
in 5
the 5
world 5
of 5
thought 5
he 5
looks 5
upon 5
individual 5
existence 5
as 5
a 5
sort 5
of 5
prison 5
and 5
wants 5
to 5
experience 5
the 5
universe 5
as 5
a 5
single 5
significant 5
whole 5
the 5
beginnings 5
of 5
cosmic 5
religious 5
feeling 5
already 5
appear 5
in 5
earlier 5
stages 5
of 5
developmenteg 5
in 5
many 5
of 5
the 5
psalms 5
of 5
david 5
and 5
in 5
some 5
of 5
the 5
prophets 5
buddhism 5
as 5
we 5
have 5
learnt 5
from 5
the 5
wonderful 5
writings 5
of 5
schopenhauer 5
especially 5
contains 5
a 5
much 5
stronger 5
element 5
of 5
it 5
the 5
religious 5
geniuses 5
of 5
all 5
ages 5
have 5
been 5
distinguished 5
by 5
this 5
kind 5
of 5
religious 5
feeling 5
which 5
knows 5
no 5
dogma 5
and 5
no 5
god 5
conceived 5
in 5
mans 5
image 5
so 5
that 5
there 5
can 5
be 5
no 5
church 5
whose 5
central 5
teachings 5
are 5
based 5
on 5
it 5
hence 5
it 5
is 5
precisely 5
among 5
the 5
heretics 5
of 5
every 5
age 5
that 5
we 5
find 5
men 5
who 5
were 5
filled 5
with 5
the 5
highest 5
kind 5
of 5
religious 5
feeling 5
and 5
were 5
in 5
many 5
cases 5
regarded 5
by 5
their 5
contemporaries 5
as 5
atheists 5
sometimes 5
also 5
as 5
saints 5
looked 5
at 5
in 5
this 5
light 5
men 5
like 5
democritus 5
francis 5
of 5
assisi 5
and 5
spinoza 5
are 5
closely 5
akin 5
to 5
one 5
another 5
how 5
can 5
cosmic 5
religious 5
feeling 5
be 5
communicated 5
from 5
one 5
person 5
to 5
another 5
if 5
it 5
can 5
give 5
rise 5
to 5
no 5
definite 5
notion 5
of 5
a 5
god 5
and 5
no 5
theology 5
in 5
my 5
view 5
it 5
is 5
the 5
most 5
important 5
function 5
of 5
art 5
and 5
science 5
to 5
awaken 5
this 5
feeling 5
and 5
keep 5
it 5
alive 5
in 5
those 5
who 5
are 5
capable 5
of 5
it 5
we 5
thus 5
arrive 5
at 5
a 5
conception 5
of 5
the 5
relation 5
of 5
science 5
to 5
religion 5
very 5
different 5
from 5
the 5
usual 5
one 5
when 5
one 5
views 5
the 5
matter 5
historically 5
one 5
is 5
inclined 5
to 5
look 5
upon 5
science 5
and 5
religion 5
as 5
irreconcilable 5
antagonists 5
and 5
for 5
a 5
very 5
obvious 5
reason 5
the 5
man 5
who 5
is 5
thoroughly 5
convinced 5
of 5
the 5
universal 5
operation 5
of 5
the 5
law 5
of 5
causation 5
cannot 5
for 5
a 5
moment 5
entertain 5
the 5
idea 5
of 5
a 5
being 5
who 5
interferes 5
in 5
the 5
course 5
of 5
eventsthat 5
is 5
if 5
he 5
takes 5
the 5
hypothesis 5
of 5
causality 5
really 5
seriously 5
he 5
has 5
no 5
use 5
for 5
the 5
religion 5
of 5
fear 5
and 5
equally 5
little 5
for 5
social 5
or 5
moral 5
religion 5
a 5
god 5
who 5
rewards 5
and 5
punishes 5
is 5
inconceivable 5
to 5
him 5
for 5
the 5
simple 5
reason 5
that 5
a 5
mans 5
actions 5
are 5
determined 5
by 5
necessity 5
external 5
and 5
internal 5
so 5
that 5
in 5
gods 5
eyes 5
he 5
cannot 5
be 5
responsible 5
any 5
more 5
than 5
an 5
inanimate 5
object 5
is 5
responsible 5
for 5
the 5
motions 5
it 5
goes 5
through 5
hence 5
science 5
has 5
been 5
charged 5
with 5
undermining 5
morality 5
but 5
the 5
charge 5
is 5
unjust 5
a 5
mans 5
ethical 5
behaviour 5
should 5
be 5
based 5
effectually 5
on 5
sympathy 5
education 5
and 5
social 5
ties 5
no 5
religious 5
basis 5
is 5
necessary 5
man 5
would 5
indeed 5
be 5
in 5
a 5
poor 5
way 5
if 5
he 5
had 5
to 5
be 5
restrained 5
by 5
fear 5
and 5
punishment 5
and 5
hope 5
of 5
reward 5
after 5
death 5
it 5
is 5
therefore 5
easy 5
to 5
see 5
why 5
the 5
churches 5
have 5
always 5
fought 5
science 5
and 5
persecuted 5
its 5
devotees 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5
i 5
maintain 5
that 5
cosmic 5
religious 5
feeling 5
is 5
the 5
strongest 5
and 5
noblest 5
incitement 5
to 5
scientific 5
research 5
only 5
those 5
who 5
realize 5
the 5
immense 5
efforts 5
and 5
above 5
all 5
the 5
devotion 5
which 5
pioneer 5
work 5
in 5
theoretical 5
science 5
demands 5
can 5
grasp 5
the 5
strength 5
of 5
the 5
emotion 5
out 5
of 5
which 5
alone 5
such 5
work 5
remote 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
from 5
the 5
immediate 5
realities 5
of 5
life 5
can 5
issue 5
what 5
a 5
deep 5
conviction 5
of 5
the 5
rationality 5
of 5
the 5
universe 5
and 5
what 5
a 5
yearning 5
to 5
understand 5
were 5
it 5
but 5
a 5
feeble 5
reflection 5
of 5
the 5
mind 5
revealed 5
in 5
this 5
world 5
kepler 5
and 5
newton 5
must 5
have 5
had 5
to 5
enable 5
them 5
to 5
spend 5
years 5
of 5
solitary 5
labour 5
in 5
disentangling 5
the 5
principles 5
of 5
celestial 5
mechanics 5
those 5
whose 5
acquaintance 5
with 5
scientific 5
research 5
is 5
derived 5
chiefly 5
from 5
its 5
practical 5
results 5
easily 5
develop 5
a 5
completely 5
false 5
notion 5
of 5
the 5
mentality 5
of 5
the 5
men 5
who 5
surrounded 5
by 5
a 5
sceptical 5
world 5
have 5
shown 5
the 5
way 5
to 5
those 5
likeminded 5
with 5
themselves 5
scattered 5
through 5
the 5
earth 5
and 5
the 5
centuries 5
only 5
one 5
who 5
has 5
devoted 5
his 5
life 5
to 5
similar 5
ends 5
can 5
have 5
a 5
vivid 5
realization 5
of 5
what 5
has 5
inspired 5
these 5
men 5
and 5
given 5
them 5
the 5
strength 5
to 5
remain 5
true 5
to 5
their 5
purpose 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
countless 5
failures 5
it 5
is 5
cosmic 5
religious 5
feeling 5
that 5
gives 5
a 5
man 5
strength 5
of 5
this 5
sort 5
a 5
contemporary 5
has 5
said 5
not 5
unjustly 5
that 5
in 5
this 5
materialistic 5
age 5
of 5
ours 5
the 5
serious 5
scientific 5
workers 5
are 5
the 5
only 5
profoundly 5
religious 5
people 5
the 5
religiousness 5
of 5
science 5
you 5
will 5
hardly 5
find 5
one 5
among 5
the 5
profounder 5
sort 5
of 5
scientific 5
minds 5
without 5
a 5
peculiar 5
religious 5
feeling 5
of 5
his 5
own 5
but 5
it 5
is 5
different 5
from 5
the 5
religion 5
of 5
the 5
naive 5
man 5
for 5
the 5
latter 5
god 5
is 5
a 5
being 5
from 5
whose 5
care 5
one 5
hopes 5
to 5
benefit 5
and 5
whose 5
punishment 5
one 5
fears 5
a 5
sublimation 5
of 5
a 5
feeling 5
similar 5
to 5
that 5
of 5
a 5
child 5
for 5
its 5
father 5
a 5
being 5
to 5
whom 5
one 5
stands 5
to 5
some 5
extent 5
in 5
a 5
personal 5
relation 5
however 5
deeply 5
it 5
may 5
be 5
tinged 5
with 5
awe 5
but 5
the 5
scientist 5
is 5
possessed 5
by 5
the 5
sense 5
of 5
universal 5
causation 5
the 5
future 5
to 5
him 5
is 5
every 5
whit 5
as 5
necessary 5
and 5
determined 5
as 5
the 5
past 5
there 5
is 5
nothing 5
divine 5
about 5
morality 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
purely 5
human 5
affair 5
his 5
religious 5
feeling 5
takes 5
the 5
form 5
of 5
a 5
rapturous 5
amazement 5
at 5
the 5
harmony 5
of 5
natural 5
law 5
which 5
reveals 5
an 5
intelligence 5
of 5
such 5
superiority 5
that 5
compared 5
with 5
it 5
all 5
the 5
systematic 5
thinking 5
and 5
acting 5
of 5
human 5
beings 5
is 5
an 5
utterly 5
insignificant 5
reflection 5
this 5
feeling 5
is 5
the 5
guiding 5
principle 5
of 5
his 5
life 5
and 5
work 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
he 5
succeeds 5
in 5
keeping 5
himself 5
from 5
the 5
shackles 5
of 5
selfish 5
desire 5
it 5
is 5
beyond 5
question 5
closely 5
akin 5
to 5

which 5

not 5
hit 5
everybody 5
equally 5
hard 5

the 5
hardest 5
hit 5
are 5
the 5

of 5
the 5
nation 5
dries 5
up 5
which 5
means 5
the 5
withering 5
of 5
many 5
possibilities 5
of 5
future 5
development 5
this 5
is 5
what 5
we 5
have 5
to 5
prevent 5
now 5
that 5
the 5
state 5
has 5
been 5
weakened 5
as 5
a 5
result 5
of 5
nonpolitical 5
causes 5
it 5
is 5
up 5
to 5
the 5
economically 5
stronger 5
members 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
to 5
come 5
to 5
the 5
rescue 5
directly 5
and 5
prevent 5
the 5
decay 5
of 5
scientific 5
life 5
farsighted 5
men 5
with 5
a 5
clear 5
understanding 5
of 5
the 5
situation 5
have 5
set 5
up 5
institutions 5
by 5
which 5
scientific 5
work 5
of 5
every 5
sort 5
is 5
to 5
be 5
kept 5
going 5
in 5
germany 5
and 5
austria 5
help 5
to 5
make 5
these 5
efforts 5
a 5
real 5
success 5
in 5
my 5
teaching 5
work 5
i 5
see 5
with 5
admiration 5
that 5
economic 5
troubles 5
have 5
not 5
yet 5
succeeded 5
in 5
stifling 5
the 5
will 5
and 5
the 5
enthusiasm 5
for 5
scientific 5
research 5
far 5
from 5
it 5
indeed 5
it 5
looks 5
as 5
if 5
our 5
disasters 5
had 5
actually 5
quickened 5
the 5
devotion 5
to 5
nonmaterial 5
goods 5
everywhere 5
people 5
are 5
working 5
with 5
burning 5
enthusiasm 5
in 5
the 5
most 5
difficult 5
circumstances 5
see 5
to 5
it 5
that 5
the 5
willpower 5
and 5
the 5
talents 5
of 5
the 5
youth 5
of 5
today 5
do 5
not 5
perish 5
to 5
the 5
grievous 5
hurt 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
fascism 5
and 5
science 5
a 5
letter 5
to 5
signor 5
rocco 5
minister 5
of 5
state 5
rome 5
my 5
dear 5
sir 5
two 5
of 5
the 5
most 5
eminent 5
and 5
respected 5
men 5
of 5
science 5
in 5
italy 5
have 5
applied 5
to 5
me 5
in 5
their 5
difficulties 5
of 5
conscience 5
and 5
requested 5
me 5
to 5
write 5
to 5
you 5
with 5
the 5
object 5
of 5
preventing 5
if 5
possible 5
a 5
piece 5
of 5
cruel 5
persecution 5
with 5
which 5
men 5
of 5
learning 5
are 5
threatened 5
in 5
italy 5
i 5
refer 5
to 5
a 5
form 5
of 5
oath 5
in 5
which 5
fidelity 5
to 5
the 5
fascist 5
system 5
is 5
to 5
be 5
promised 5
the 5
burden 5
of 5
my 5
request 5
is 5
that 5
you 5
should 5
please 5
advise 5
signor 5
mussolini 5
to 5
spare 5
the 5
flower 5
of 5
italys 5
intellect 5
this 5
humiliation 5
however 5
much 5
our 5
political 5
convictions 5
may 5
differ 5
i 5
know 5
that 5
we 5
agree 5
on 5
one 5
point 5
in 5
the 5
progressive 5
achievements 5
of 5
the 5
european 5
mind 5
both 5
of 5
us 5
see 5
and 5
love 5
our 5
highest 5
good 5
those 5
achievements 5
are 5
based 5
on 5
the 5
freedom 5
of 5
thought 5
and 5
of 5
teaching 5
on 5
the 5
principle 5
that 5
the 5
desire 5
for 5
truth 5
must 5
take 5
precedence 5
of 5
all 5
other 5
desires 5
it 5
was 5
this 5
basis 5
alone 5
that 5
enabled 5
our 5
civilization 5
to 5
take 5
its 5
rise 5
in 5
greece 5
and 5
to 5
celebrate 5
its 5
rebirth 5
in 5
italy 5
at 5
the 5
renaissance 5
this 5
supreme 5
good 5
has 5
been 5
paid 5
for 5
by 5
the 5
martyrs 5
blood 5
of 5
pure 5
and 5
great 5
men 5
for 5
whose 5
sake 5
italy 5
is 5
still 5
loved 5
and 5
reverenced 5
today 5
far 5
be 5
it 5
from 5
me 5
to 5
argue 5
with 5
you 5
about 5
what 5
inroads 5
on 5
human 5
liberty 5
may 5
be 5
justified 5
by 5
reasons 5
of 5
state 5
but 5
the 5
pursuit 5
of 5
scientific 5
truth 5
detached 5
from 5
the 5
practical 5
interests 5
of 5
everyday 5
life 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
treated 5
as 5
sacred 5
by 5
every 5
government 5
and 5
it 5
is 5
in 5
the 5
highest 5
interests 5
of 5
all 5
that 5
honest 5
servants 5
of 5
truth 5
should 5
be 5
left 5
in 5
peace 5
this 5
is 5
also 5
undoubtedly 5
in 5
the 5
interests 5
of 5
the 5
italian 5
state 5
and 5
its 5
prestige 5
in 5
the 5
eyes 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
hoping 5
that 5
my 5
request 5
will 5
not 5
fall 5
on 5
deaf 5
ears 5
i 5
am 5
etc 5
a 5
e 5
interviewers 5
to 5
be 5
called 5
to 5
account 5
publicly 5
for 5
everything 5
one 5
has 5
said 5
even 5
in 5
jest 5
an 5
excess 5
of 5
high 5
spirits 5
or 5
momentary 5
anger 5
fatal 5
as 5
it 5
must 5
be 5
in 5
the 5
end 5
is 5
yet 5
up 5
to 5
a 5
point 5
reasonable 5
and 5
natural 5
but 5
to 5
be 5
called 5
to 5
account 5
publicly 5
for 5
what 5
others 5
have 5
said 5
in 5
ones 5
name 5
when 5
one 5
cannot 5
defend 5
oneself 5
is 5
indeed 5
a 5
sad 5
predicament 5
but 5
who 5
suffers 5
such 5
a 5
dreadful 5
fate 5
you 5
will 5
ask 5
well 5
everyone 5
who 5
is 5
of 5
sufficient 5
interest 5
to 5
the 5
public 5
to 5
be 5
pursued 5
by 5
interviewers 5
you 5
smile 5
incredulously 5
but 5
i 5
have 5
had 5
plenty 5
of 5
direct 5
experience 5
and 5
will 5
tell 5
you 5
about 5
it 5
imagine 5
the 5
following 5
situation 5
one 5
morning 5
a 5
reporter 5
comes 5
to 5
you 5
and 5
asks 5
you 5
in 5
a 5
friendly 5
way 5
to 5
tell 5
him 5
something 5
about 5
your 5
friend 5
n 5
at 5
first 5
you 5
no 5
doubt 5
feel 5
something 5
approaching 5
indignation 5
at 5
such 5
a 5
proposal 5
but 5
you 5
soon 5
discover 5
that 5
there 5
is 5
no 5
escape 5
if 5
you 5
refuse 5
to 5
say 5
anything 5
the 5
man 5
writes 5
i 5
asked 5
one 5
of 5
ns 5
supposedly 5
best 5
friends 5
about 5
him 5
but 5
he 5
prudently 5
avoided 5
my 5
questions 5
this 5
in 5
itself 5
enables 5
the 5
reader 5
to 5
draw 5
the 5
inevitable 5
conclusions 5
there 5
is 5
therefore 5
no 5
escape 5
and 5
you 5
give 5
the 5
following 5
information 5
mr 5
n 5
is 5
a 5
cheerful 5
straightforward 5
man 5
much 5
liked 5
by 5
all 5
his 5
friends 5
he 5
can 5
find 5
a 5
bright 5
side 5
to 5
any 5
situation 5
his 5
enterprise 5
and 5
industry 5
know 5
no 5
bounds 5
his 5
job 5
takes 5
up 5
his 5
entire 5
energies 5
he 5
is 5
devoted 5
to 5
his 5
family 5
and 5
lays 5
everything 5
he 5
possesses 5
at 5
his 5
wifes 5
feet 5
now 5
for 5
the 5
reporters 5
version 5
mr 5
n 5
takes 5
nothing 5
very 5
seriously 5
and 5
has 5
a 5
gift 5
for 5
making 5
himself 5
liked 5
particularly 5
as 5
he 5
carefully 5
cultivates 5
a 5
hearty 5
and 5
ingratiating 5
manner 5
he 5
is 5
so 5
completely 5
a 5
slave 5
to 5
his 5
job 5
that 5
he 5
has 5
no 5
time 5
for 5
the 5
considerations 5
of 5
any 5
nonpersonal 5
subject 5
or 5
for 5
any 5
mental 5
activity 5
outside 5
it 5
he 5
spoils 5
his 5
wife 5
unbelievably 5
and 5
is 5
utterly 5
under 5
her 5
thumb 5
a 5
real 5
reporter 5
would 5
make 5
it 5
much 5
more 5
spicy 5
but 5
i 5
expect 5
this 5
will 5
be 5
enough 5
for 5
you 5
and 5
your 5
friend 5
n 5
he 5
reads 5
this 5
and 5
some 5
more 5
like 5
it 5
in 5
the 5
paper 5
next 5
morning 5
and 5
his 5
rage 5
against 5
you 5
knows 5
no 5
bounds 5
however 5
cheerful 5
and 5
benevolent 5
his 5
natural 5
disposition 5
may 5
be 5
the 5
injury 5
done 5
to 5
him 5
gives 5
you 5
untold 5
pain 5
especially 5
as 5
you 5
are 5
really 5
fond 5
of 5
him 5
whats 5
your 5
next 5
step 5
my 5
friend 5
if 5
you 5
know 5
tell 5
me 5
quickly 5
so 5
that 5
i 5
may 5
adopt 5
your 5
method 5
with 5
all 5
speed 5
thanks 5
to 5
america 5
mr 5
mayor 5
ladies 5
and 5
gentlemen 5
the 5
splendid 5
reception 5
which 5
you 5
have 5
accorded 5
to 5
me 5
today 5
puts 5
me 5
to 5
the 5
blush 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
meant 5
for 5
me 5
personally 5
but 5
it 5
gives 5
me 5
all 5
the 5
more 5
pleasure 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
meant 5
for 5
me 5
as 5
a 5
representative 5
of 5
pure 5
science 5
for 5
this 5
gathering 5
is 5
an 5
outward 5
and 5
visible 5
sign 5
that 5
the 5
world 5
is 5
no 5
longer 5
prone 5
to 5
regard 5
material 5
power 5
and 5
wealth 5
as 5
the 5
highest 5
goods 5
it 5
is 5
gratifying 5
that 5
men 5
should 5
feel 5
an 5
urge 5
to 5
proclaim 5
this 5
in 5
an 5
official 5
way 5
in 5
the 5
wonderful 5
two 5
months 5
which 5
i 5
have 5
been 5
privileged 5
to 5
spend 5
in 5
your 5
midst 5
in 5
this 5
fortunate 5
land 5
i 5
have 5
had 5
many 5
opportunities 5
of 5
observing 5
what 5
a 5
high 5
value 5
men 5
of 5
action 5
and 5
of 5
practical 5
life 5
attach 5
to 5
the 5
efforts 5
of 5
science 5
a 5
good 5
few 5
of 5
them 5
have 5
placed 5
a 5
considerable 5
proportion 5
of 5
their 5
fortunes 5
and 5
their 5
energies 5
at 5
the 5
service 5
of 5
scientific 5
enterprises 5
and 5
thereby 5
contributed 5
to 5
the 5
prosperity 5
and 5
prestige 5
of 5
this 5
country 5
i 5
cannot 5
let 5
this 5
occasion 5
pass 5
without 5
referring 5
in 5
a 5
spirit 5
of 5
thankfulness 5
to 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
american 5
patronage 5
of 5
science 5
is 5
not 5
limited 5
by 5
national 5
frontiers 5
scientific 5
enterprises 5
all 5
over 5
the 5
civilized 5
world 5
rejoice 5
in 5
the 5
liberal 5
support 5
of 5
american 5
institutions 5
and 5
individualsa 5
fact 5
which 5
is 5
i 5
am 5
sure 5
a 5
source 5
of 5
pride 5
and 5
gratification 5
to 5
all 5
of 5
you 5
these 5
tokens 5
of 5
an 5
international 5
way 5
of 5
thinking 5
and 5
feeling 5
are 5
particularly 5
welcome 5
for 5
the 5
world 5
is 5
today 5
more 5
than 5
ever 5
in 5
need 5
of 5
international 5
thinking 5
and 5
feeling 5
by 5
its 5
leading 5
nations 5
and 5
personalities 5
if 5
it 5
is 5
to 5
progress 5
towards 5
a 5
better 5
and 5
more 5
worthy 5
future 5
i 5
may 5
be 5
permitted 5
to 5
express 5
the 5
hope 5
that 5
this 5
internationalism 5
of 5
the 5
american 5
nation 5
which 5
proceeds 5
from 5
a 5
high 5
sense 5
of 5
responsibility 5
will 5
very 5
soon 5
extend 5
itself 5
to 5
the 5
sphere 5
of 5
politics 5
for 5
without 5
the 5
active 5
cooperation 5

this 5
important 5
end 5

bound 5
to 5
remain 5
more 5

heartily 5
for 5

wars 5
and 5
every 5
kind 5
of 5
oppression 5
which 5
fill 5
the 5
earth 5
with 5
pain 5
sighs 5
and 5
bitterness 5
and 5
yet 5
nothing 5
truly 5
valuable 5
can 5
be 5
achieved 5
except 5
by 5
the 5
unselfish 5
cooperation 5
of 5
many 5
individuals 5
hence 5
the 5
man 5
of 5
good 5
will 5
is 5
never 5
happier 5
than 5
when 5
some 5
communal 5
enterprise 5
is 5
afoot 5
and 5
is 5
launched 5
at 5
the 5
cost 5
of 5
heavy 5
sacrifices 5
with 5
the 5
single 5
object 5
of 5
promoting 5
life 5
and 5
culture 5
such 5
pure 5
joy 5
was 5
mine 5
when 5
i 5
heard 5
about 5
the 5
university 5
courses 5
at 5
davos 5
a 5
work 5
of 5
rescue 5
is 5
being 5
carried 5
out 5
there 5
with 5
intelligence 5
and 5
a 5
wise 5
moderation 5
which 5
is 5
based 5
on 5
a 5
grave 5
need 5
though 5
it 5
may 5
not 5
be 5
a 5
need 5
that 5
is 5
immediately 5
obvious 5
to 5
everyone 5
many 5
a 5
young 5
man 5
goes 5
to 5
this 5
valley 5
with 5
his 5
hopes 5
fixed 5
on 5
the 5
healing 5
power 5
of 5
its 5
sunny 5
mountains 5
and 5
regains 5
his 5
bodily 5
health 5
but 5
thus 5
withdrawn 5
for 5
long 5
periods 5
from 5
the 5
willhardening 5
discipline 5
of 5
normal 5
work 5
and 5
a 5
prey 5
to 5
morbid 5
reflection 5
on 5
his 5
physical 5
condition 5
he 5
easily 5
loses 5
the 5
power 5
of 5
mental 5
effort 5
and 5
the 5
sense 5
of 5
being 5
able 5
to 5
hold 5
his 5
own 5
in 5
the 5
struggle 5
for 5
existence 5
he 5
becomes 5
a 5
sort 5
of 5
hothouse 5
plant 5
and 5
when 5
his 5
body 5
is 5
cured 5
often 5
finds 5
it 5
difficult 5
to 5
get 5
back 5
to 5
normal 5
life 5
interruption 5
of 5
intellectual 5
training 5
in 5
the 5
formative 5
period 5
of 5
youth 5
is 5
very 5
apt 5
to 5
leave 5
a 5
gap 5
which 5
can 5
hardly 5
be 5
filled 5
later 5
yet 5
as 5
a 5
general 5
rule 5
intellectual 5
work 5
in 5
moderation 5
so 5
far 5
from 5
retarding 5
cure 5
indirectly 5
helps 5
it 5
forward 5
just 5
as 5
moderate 5
physical 5
work 5
does 5
it 5
is 5
in 5
this 5
knowledge 5
that 5
the 5
university 5
courses 5
are 5
being 5
instituted 5
with 5
the 5
object 5
not 5
merely 5
of 5
preparing 5
these 5
young 5
people 5
for 5
a 5
profession 5
but 5
of 5
stimulating 5
them 5
to 5
intellectual 5
activity 5
as 5
such 5
they 5
are 5
to 5
provide 5
work 5
training 5
and 5
hygiene 5
in 5
the 5
sphere 5
of 5
the 5
mind 5
let 5
us 5
not 5
forget 5
that 5
this 5
enterprise 5
is 5
admirably 5
calculated 5
to 5
establish 5
such 5
relations 5
between 5
members 5
of 5
different 5
nations 5
as 5
are 5
favourable 5
to 5
the 5
growth 5
of 5
a 5
common 5
european 5
feeling 5
the 5
effects 5
of 5
the 5
new 5
institution 5
in 5
this 5
direction 5
are 5
likely 5
to 5
be 5
all 5
the 5
more 5
advantageous 5
from 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
the 5
circumstances 5
of 5
its 5
birth 5
rule 5
out 5
every 5
sort 5
of 5
political 5
purpose 5
the 5
best 5
way 5
to 5
serve 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
internationalism 5
is 5
by 5
cooperating 5
in 5
some 5
lifegiving 5
work 5
from 5
all 5
these 5
points 5
of 5
view 5
i 5
rejoice 5
that 5
the 5
energy 5
and 5
intelligence 5
of 5
the 5
founders 5
of 5
the 5
university 5
courses 5
at 5
davos 5
have 5
already 5
attained 5
such 5
a 5
measure 5
of 5
success 5
that 5
the 5
enterprise 5
has 5
outgrown 5
the 5
troubles 5
of 5
infancy 5
may 5
it 5
prosper 5
enriching 5
the 5
inner 5

remain 5
themselves 5
untouched 5

these 5

the 5

who 5
has 5
delightedand 5
educatedus 5
all 5
some 5
notes 5
on 5
my 5
american 5
impressions 5
i 5
must 5
redeem 5
my 5
promise 5
to 5
say 5
something 5
about 5
my 5
impressions 5
of 5
this 5
country 5
that 5
is 5
not 5
altogether 5
easy 5
for 5
me 5
for 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
easy 5
to 5
take 5
up 5
the 5
attitude 5
of 5
an 5
impartial 5
observer 5
when 5
one 5
is 5
received 5
with 5
such 5
kindness 5
and 5
undeserved 5
respect 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
been 5
in 5
america 5
first 5
of 5
all 5
let 5
me 5
say 5
something 5
on 5
this 5
head 5
the 5
cult 5
of 5
individual 5
personalities 5
is 5
always 5
in 5
my 5
view 5
unjustified 5
to 5
be 5
sure 5
nature 5
distributes 5
her 5
gifts 5
variously 5
among 5
her 5
children 5
but 5
there 5
are 5
plenty 5
of 5
the 5
wellendowed 5
ones 5
too 5
thank 5
god 5
and 5
i 5
am 5
firmly 5
convinced 5
that 5
most 5
of 5
them 5
live 5
quiet 5
unregarded 5
lives 5
it 5
strikes 5
me 5
as 5
unfair 5
and 5
even 5
in 5
bad 5
taste 5
to 5
select 5
a 5
few 5
of 5
them 5
fur 5
boundless 5
admiration 5
attributing 5
superhuman 5
powers 5
of 5
mind 5
and 5
character 5
to 5
them 5
this 5
has 5
been 5
my 5
fate 5
and 5
the 5
contrast 5
between 5
the 5
popular 5
estimate 5
of 5
my 5
powers 5
and 5
achievements 5
and 5
the 5
reality 5
is 5
simply 5
grotesque 5
the 5
consciousness 5
of 5
this 5
extraordinary 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
would 5
be 5
unbearable 5
but 5
for 5
one 5
great 5
consoling 5
thought 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
welcome 5
symptom 5
in 5
an 5
age 5
which 5
is 5
commonly 5
denounced 5
as 5
materialistic 5
that 5
it 5
makes 5
heroes 5
of 5
men 5
whose 5
ambitions 5
lie 5
wholly 5
in 5
the 5
intellectual 5
and 5
moral 5
sphere 5
this 5
proves 5
that 5
knowledge 5
and 5
justice 5
are 5
ranked 5
above 5
wealth 5
and 5
power 5
by 5
a 5
large 5
section 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
my 5
experience 5
teaches 5
me 5
that 5
this 5
idealistic 5
outlook 5
is 5
particularly 5
prevalent 5
in 5
america 5
which 5
is 5
usually 5
decried 5
as 5
a 5
particularly 5
materialistic 5
country 5
after 5
this 5
digression 5
i 5
come 5
to 5
my 5
proper 5
theme 5
in 5
the 5
hope 5
that 5
no 5
more 5
weight 5
will 5
be 5
attached 5
to 5
my 5
modest 5
remarks 5
than 5
they 5
deserve 5
what 5
first 5
strikes 5
the 5
visitor 5
with 5
amazement 5
is 5
the 5
superiority 5
of 5
this 5
country 5
in 5
matters 5
of 5
technics 5
and 5
organization 5
objects 5
of 5
everyday 5
use 5
are 5
more 5
solid 5
than 5
in 5
europe 5
houses 5
infinitely 5
more 5
convenient 5
in 5
arrangement 5
everything 5
is 5
designed 5
to 5
save 5
human 5
labour 5
labour 5
is 5
expensive 5
because 5
the 5
country 5
is 5
sparsely 5
inhabited 5
in 5
comparison 5
with 5
its 5
natural 5
resources 5
the 5
high 5
price 5
of 5
labour 5
was 5
the 5
stimulus 5
which 5
evoked 5
the 5
marvellous 5
development 5
of 5
technical 5
devices 5
and 5
methods 5
of 5
work 5
the 5
opposite 5
extreme 5
is 5
illustrated 5
by 5
overpopulated 5
china 5
or 5
india 5
where 5
the 5
low 5
price 5
of 5
labour 5
has 5
stood 5
in 5
the 5
way 5
of 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
machinery 5
europe 5
is 5
halfway 5
between 5
the 5
two 5
once 5
the 5
machine 5
is 5
sufficiently 5
highly 5
developed 5
it 5
becomes 5
cheaper 5
in 5
the 5
end 5
than 5
the 5
cheapest 5
labour 5
let 5
the 5
fascists 5
in 5
europe 5
who 5
desire 5
on 5
narrowminded 5
political 5
grounds 5
to 5
see 5
their 5
own 5
particular 5
countries 5
more 5
densely 5
populated 5
take 5
heed 5
of 5
this 5
the 5
anxious 5
care 5
with 5
which 5
the 5
united 5
states 5
keep 5
out 5
foreign 5
goods 5
by 5
means 5
of 5
prohibitive 5
tariffs 5
certainly 5
contrasts 5
oddly 5
with 5
this 5
notionhellipbut 5
an 5
innocent 5
visitor 5
must 5
not 5
be 5
expected 5
to 5
rack 5
his 5
brains 5
too 5
much 5
and 5
when 5
all 5
is 5
said 5
and 5
done 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
absolutely 5
certain 5
that 5
every 5
question 5
admits 5
of 5
a 5
rational 5
answer 5
the 5
second 5
thing 5
that 5
strikes 5
a 5
visitor 5
is 5
the 5
joyous 5
positive 5
attitude 5
to 5
life 5
the 5
smile 5
on 5
the 5
faces 5
of 5
the 5
people 5
in 5
photographs 5
is 5
symbolical 5
of 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
americans 5
greatest 5
assets 5
he 5
is 5
friendly 5
confident 5
optimistic 5
andwithout 5
envy 5
the 5
european 5
finds 5
intercourse 5
with 5
americans 5
easy 5
and 5
agreeable 5
compared 5
with 5
the 5
american 5
the 5
european 5
is 5
more 5
critical 5
more 5
selfconscious 5
less 5
goodhearted 5
and 5
helpful 5
more 5
isolated 5
more 5
fastidious 5
in 5
his 5
amusements 5
and 5
his 5
reading 5
generally 5
more 5
or 5
less 5
of 5
a 5
pessimist 5
great 5
importance 5
attaches 5
to 5
the 5
material 5
comforts 5
of 5
life 5
and 5
peace 5
freedom 5
from 5
care 5
security 5
are 5
all 5
sacrificed 5
to 5
them 5
the 5
american 5
lives 5
for 5
ambition 5
the 5
future 5
more 5
than 5
the 5
european 5
life 5
for 5
him 5
is 5
always 5
becoming 5
never 5
being 5
in 5
this 5
respect 5

is 5
even 5
further 5
removed 5
from 5
the 5
russian 5
and 5
the 5
asiatic 5
than 5
the 5
european 5
is 5
but 5
there 5
is 5
another 5
respect 5
in 5
which 5
he 5
resembles 5
the 5
asiatic 5
more 5
than 5
the 5

does 5
he 5
is 5
lest 5
of 5
an 5
individualist 5
than 5
the 5

is 5
from 5
the 5
psychological 5
not 5
the 5
economic 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
more 5
emphasis 5
is 5
laid 5
on 5
the 5
we 5
than 5
the 5
i 5
as 5
a 5
natural 5
corollary 5
of 5
this 5
custom 5
and 5
convention 5
are 5
very 5
powerful 5
and 5
there 5
is 5
much 5
more 5
uniformity 5
both 5
in 5
outlook 5
on 5
life 5
and 5
in 5
moral 5
and 5
sthetic 5
ideas 5
among 5
americans 5
than 5
among 5
europeans 5
this 5
fact 5
is 5
chiefly 5
responsible 5
for 5
americas 5
economic 5
superiority 5
over 5
europe 5
cooperation 5
and 5
the 5
division 5
of 5
labour 5
are 5
carried 5
through 5
more 5
easily 5
and 5
with 5
less 5
friction 5
than 5
in 5
europe 5
whether 5
in 5
the 5
factory 5
or 5
the 5
university 5
or 5
in 5
private 5
good 5
works 5
this 5
social 5
sense 5
may 5
be 5
partly 5
due 5
to 5
the 5
english 5
tradition 5
in 5
apparent 5
contradiction 5
to 5
this 5
stands 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
the 5
activities 5
of 5
the 5
state 5
are 5
comparatively 5
restricted 5
as 5
compared 5
with 5
europe 5
the 5
european 5
is 5
surprised 5
to 5
find 5
the 5
telegraph 5
the 5
telephone 5
the 5
railways 5
and 5
the 5
schools 5
predominantly 5
in 5
private 5
hands 5
the 5
more 5
social 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
which 5
i 5
mentioned 5
just 5
now 5
makes 5
this 5
possible 5
here 5
another 5
consequence 5
of 5
this 5
attitude 5
is 5
that 5
the 5
extremely 5
unequal 5
distribution 5
of 5
property 5
leads 5
to 5
no 5
intolerable 5
hardships 5
the 5
social 5
conscience 5
of 5
the 5
rich 5
man 5
is 5
much 5
more 5
highly 5
developed 5
than 5
in 5
europe 5
he 5
considers 5
himself 5
obliged 5
as 5
a 5
matter 5
of 5
course 5
to 5
place 5
a 5
large 5
portion 5
of 5
his 5
wealth 5
and 5
often 5
of 5
his 5
own 5
energies 5
too 5
at 5
the 5
disposal 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
and 5
public 5
opinion 5
that 5
allpowerful 5
force 5
imperiously 5
demands 5
it 5
of 5
him 5
hence 5
the 5
most 5
important 5
cultural 5
functions 5
can 5
be 5
left 5
to 5
private 5
enterprise 5
and 5
the 5
part 5
played 5
by 5
the 5
state 5
in 5
this 5
country 5
is 5
comparatively 5
a 5
very 5
restricted 5
one 5
the 5
prestige 5
of 5
government 5
has 5
undoubtedly 5
been 5
lowered 5
considerably 5
by 5
the 5
prohibition 5
laws 5
for 5
nothing 5
is 5
more 5
destructive 5
of 5
respect 5
for 5
the 5
government 5
and 5
the 5
law 5
of 5
the 5
land 5
than 5
passing 5
laws 5
which 5
cannot 5
be 5
enforced 5
it 5
is 5
an 5
open 5
secret 5
that 5
the 5
dangerous 5
increase 5
of 5
crime 5
in 5
this 5
country 5
is 5
closely 5
connected 5
with 5
this 5
there 5
is 5
also 5
another 5
way 5
in 5
which 5
prohibition 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
has 5
led 5
to 5
the 5
enfeeblement 5
of 5
the 5
state 5
the 5
publichouse 5
is 5
a 5
place 5
which 5
gives 5
people 5
a 5
chance 5
to 5
exchange 5
views 5
and 5
ideas 5
on 5
public 5
affairs 5
as 5
far 5
as 5
i 5
can 5
see 5
people 5
here 5
have 5
no 5
chance 5
of 5
doing 5
this 5
the 5
result 5
being 5
that 5
the 5
press 5
which 5
is 5
mostly 5
controlled 5
by 5
definite 5
interests 5
has 5
an 5
excessive 5
influence 5
over 5
public 5
opinion 5
the 5
overestimation 5
of 5
money 5
is 5
still 5
greater 5
in 5
this 5
country 5
than 5
in 5
europe 5
but 5
appears 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
be 5
on 5
the 5
decrease 5
it 5
is 5
at 5
last 5
beginning 5
to 5
be 5
realized 5
that 5
great 5
wealth 5
is 5
not 5
necessary 5
for 5
a 5
happy 5
and 5
satisfactory 5
life 5
as 5
regards 5
artistic 5
matters 5
i 5
have 5
been 5
genuinely 5
impressed 5
by 5
the 5
good 5
taste 5
displayed 5
in 5
the 5
modern 5
buildings 5
and 5
in 5
articles 5
of 5
common 5
use 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5
the 5
visual 5
arts 5
and 5
music 5
have 5
little 5
place 5
in 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
the 5
nation 5
as 5
compared 5
with 5
europe 5
i 5
have 5
a 5
warm 5
admiration 5
for 5
the 5
achievements 5
of 5
american 5
institutes 5
of 5
scientific 5
research 5
we 5
are 5
unjust 5
in 5
attempting 5
to 5
ascribe 5
the 5
increasing 5
superiority 5
of 5
american 5
researchwork 5
exclusively 5
to 5
superior 5
wealth 5
zeal 5

spirit 5
of 5
comradeship 5
and 5
a 5
talent 5
for 5

the 5

its 5
influence 5
on 5
the 5

of 5

is 5
absolutely 5
incalculable 5
but 5
america 5
is 5
a 5
large 5
country 5
and 5
its 5
people 5
have 5
so 5
far 5
not 5
shown 5
much 5
interest 5
in 5
great 5

among 5
which 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5

occupies 5
first 5
place 5
today 5
this 5
must 5
be 5
changed 5

only 5

shown 5
that 5
there 5
are 5
no 5
longer 5
any 5
barriers 5
between 5
the 5

the 5

all 5
countries 5
are 5
closely 5
interwoven 5
the 5
people 5
of 5
this 5

must 5
realize 5
that 5
they 5
have 5
a 5
great 5
responsibility 5
in 5
the 5
sphere 5
of 5
international 5
politics 5
the 5
part 5
of 5

unworthy 5

never 5
yet 5

i 5
experienced 5

energetic 5
rejection 5

if 5
i 5

never 5
from 5
so 5
many 5
at 5
once 5
but 5
are 5
they 5
not 5
quite 5
right 5
these 5
watchful 5
citizenesses 5
why 5
should 5
one 5
open 5
ones 5
doors 5
to 5
a 5
person 5
who 5
devours 5
hardboiled 5
capitalists 5
with 5
as 5
much 5
appetite 5
and 5
gusto 5
as 5
the 5

gone 5
by 5
devoured 5
luscious 5
greek 5
maidens 5
and 5
on 5
top 5
of 5
that 5
is 5
lowdown 5
enough 5
to 5
reject 5
every 5
sort 5
of 5
war 5
except 5
the 5
unavoidable 5
war 5
with 5
ones 5

therefore 5
give 5
heed 5
to 5
your 5
clever 5
and 5
patriotic 5
womenfolk 5
and 5
remember 5
that 5
the 5
capitol 5
of 5
mighty 5
rome 5
was 5
once 5
saved 5
by 5
the 5
cackling 5
of 5
its 5
faithful 5
geese 5
ii 5
politics 5
and 5
pacifism 5
peace 5
the 5
importance 5
of 5
securing 5
international 5
peace 5
was 5
recognized 5
by 5
the 5
really 5
great 5
men 5
of 5
former 5
generations 5
but 5
the 5
technical 5
advances 5
of 5
our 5
times 5
have 5
turned 5
this 5
ethical 5
postulate 5
into 5
a 5
matter 5
of 5
life 5
and 5
death 5
for 5
civilized 5
mankind 5
today 5
and 5
made 5
the 5
taking 5
of 5
an 5
active 5
part 5
in 5
the 5
solution 5
of 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5
peace 5
a 5
moral 5
duty 5
which 5
no 5
conscientious 5
man 5
can 5
shirk 5
one 5
has 5
to 5
realize 5
that 5
the 5
powerful 5
industrial 5
groups 5
concerned 5
in 5
the 5
manufacture 5
of 5
arms 5
are 5
doing 5
their 5
best 5
in 5
all 5
countries 5
to 5
prevent 5
the 5
peaceful 5
settlement 5
of 5
international 5
disputes 5
and 5
that 5
rulers 5
can 5
achieve 5
this 5
great 5
end 5
only 5
if 5
they 5
are 5
sure 5
of 5
the 5
vigorous 5
support 5
of 5
the 5
majority 5
of 5
their 5
peoples 5
in 5
these 5
days 5
of 5
democratic 5
government 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
the 5
nations 5
hangs 5
on 5
themselves 5
each 5
individual 5
must 5
always 5
bear 5
that 5
in 5
mind 5
the 5
pacifist 5
problem 5
ladies 5
and 5
gentlemen 5
i 5
am 5
very 5
glad 5
of 5
this 5
opportunity 5
of 5
saying 5
a 5
few 5
words 5
to 5
you 5
about 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5
pacificism 5
the 5
course 5
of 5
events 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
years 5
has 5
once 5
more 5
shown 5
us 5
how 5
little 5
we 5
are 5
justified 5
in 5
leaving 5
the 5
struggle 5
against 5
armaments 5
and 5
against 5
the 5
war 5
spirit 5
to 5
the 5
governments 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5
the 5
formation 5
of 5
large 5
organizations 5
with 5
a 5
large 5
membership 5
can 5
of 5
itself 5
bring 5
us 5
very 5
little 5
nearer 5
to 5
our 5
goal 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
the 5
best 5
method 5
in 5
this 5
case 5
is 5
the 5
violent 5
one 5
of 5
conscientious 5
objection 5
with 5
the 5
aid 5
of 5
organizations 5
for 5
giving 5
moral 5
and 5
material 5
support 5
to 5
the 5
courageous 5
conscientious 5
objectors 5
in 5
each 5
country 5
in 5
this 5
way 5
we 5
may 5
succeed 5
in 5
making 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5
pacificism 5
an 5
acute 5
one 5
a 5
real 5
struggle 5
which 5
attracts 5
forceful 5
natures 5
it 5
is 5
an 5
illegal 5
struggle 5
but 5
a 5
struggle 5
for 5
peoples 5
real 5
rights 5
against 5
their 5
governments 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
the 5
latter 5
demand 5
criminal 5
acts 5
of 5
the 5
citizen 5
many 5
who 5
think 5
themselves 5
good 5
pacifists 5
will 5
jib 5
at 5
this 5
outandout 5
pacifism 5
on 5
patriotic 5
grounds 5
such 5
people 5
are 5
not 5
to 5
be 5
relied 5
on 5
in 5
the 5
hour 5
of 5
crisis 5
as 5
the 5
world 5
war 5
amply 5
proved 5
i 5
am 5
most 5
grateful 5
to 5
you 5
for 5
according 5
me 5
an 5
opportunity 5
to 5
give 5
you 5
my 5
views 5
in 5
person 5
address 5
to 5
the 5
students 5
disarmament 5
meeting 5
preceding 5
generations 5
have 5
presented 5
us 5
in 5
a 5
highly 5
developed 5
science 5
and 5
mechanical 5
knowledge 5
with 5
a 5
most 5
valuable 5
gift 5
which 5
carries 5
with 5
it 5
possibilities 5
of 5
making 5
our 5
life 5
free 5
and 5
beautiful 5
such 5
as 5
no 5
previous 5
generation 5
has 5
enjoyed 5
but 5
this 5
gift 5
also 5
brings 5
with 5
it 5
dangers 5
to 5
our 5
existence 5
as 5
great 5
as 5
any 5
that 5
have 5
ever 5
threatened 5
it 5
the 5
destiny 5
of 5
civilized 5
humanity 5
depends 5
more 5
than 5
ever 5
on 5
the 5
moral 5
forces 5
it 5
is 5
capable 5
of 5
generating 5
hence 5
the 5
task 5
that 5
confronts 5
our 5
age 5
is 5
certainly 5
no 5
easier 5
than 5
the 5
tasks 5
our 5
immediate 5
predecessors 5
successfully 5
performed 5
the 5
foodstuffs 5
and 5
other 5
goods 5
which 5
the 5
world 5
needs 5
can 5
be 5
produced 5
in 5
far 5
fewer 5
hours 5
of 5
work 5
than 5
formerly 5
but 5
this 5
has 5
made 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5
the 5
division 5
of 5
labour 5
and 5
the 5
distribution 5
of 5
the 5
goods 5
produced 5
far 5
more 5
difficult 5
we 5
all 5
feel 5
that 5
the 5
free 5
play 5
of 5
economic 5
forces 5
the 5
unregulated 5
and 5
unrestrained 5
pursuit 5
of 5
wealth 5
and 5
power 5
by 5
the 5
individual 5
no 5
longer 5
leads 5
automatically 5
to 5
a 5
tolerable 5
solution 5
of 5
these 5
problems 5
production 5
labour 5
and 5
distribution 5
need 5
to 5
be 5
organized 5
on 5
a 5
definite 5
plan 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
prevent 5
valuable 5
productive 5
energies 5
from 5
being 5
thrown 5
away 5
and 5
sections 5
of 5
the 5
population 5
from 5
becoming 5
impoverished 5
and 5
relapsing 5
into 5
savagery 5
if 5
unrestricted 5
sacro 5
egoismo 5
leads 5
to 5
disastrous 5
consequences 5
in 5
economic 5
life 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
still 5
worse 5
guide 5
in 5
international 5
relations 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
mechanical 5
methods 5
of 5
warfare 5
is 5
such 5
that 5
human 5
life 5
will 5
become 5
intolerable 5
if 5
people 5
do 5
not 5
before 5
long 5
discover 5
a 5
way 5
of 5
preventing 5
war 5
the 5
importance 5
of 5
this 5
object 5
is 5
only 5
equalled 5
by 5
the 5
inadequacy 5
of 5
the 5
attempts 5
hitherto 5
made 5
to 5
attain 5
it 5
people 5
seek 5
to 5
minimize 5
the 5
danger 5
by 5
limitation 5
of 5
armaments 5

restrictive 5

war 5
is 5
not 5

a 5
parlourgame 5
in 5
which 5
the 5
players 5
loyally 5
stick 5

the 5
absolute 5
repudiation 5

war 5

here 5
the 5
creation 5
of 5
an 5
international 5
court 5

is 5
not 5
enough 5
there 5

such 5

the 5

will 5
never 5
have 5
the 5
courage 5
to 5
disarm 5
seriously 5
suppose 5
for 5
example 5
that 5
the 5
american 5
english 5
german 5
and 5
french 5
governments 5
insisted 5
on 5
the 5
japanese 5
governments 5
putting 5
an 5
immediate 5
stop 5
to 5
their 5
warlike 5
operations 5
in 5
china 5
under 5
pain 5
of 5
a 5
complete 5
economic 5
boycott 5
do 5
you 5
suppose 5
that 5
any 5
japanese 5
government 5
would 5
be 5
found 5
ready 5
to 5
take 5
the 5
responsibility 5
of 5
plunging 5
its 5
country 5
into 5
such 5
a 5
perilous 5
adventure 5
then 5
why 5
is 5
it 5
not 5
done 5
why 5
must 5
every 5
individual 5
and 5
every 5
nation 5
tremble 5
for 5
their 5
existence 5
because 5
each 5
seeks 5
his 5
own 5
wretched 5
momentary 5
advantage 5
and 5
refuses 5
to 5
subordinate 5
it 5
to 5
the 5
welfare 5
and 5
prosperity 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
that 5
is 5
why 5
i 5
began 5
by 5
telling 5
you 5
that 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
was 5
more 5
than 5
ever 5
dependent 5
on 5
its 5
moral 5
strength 5
today 5
the 5
way 5
to 5
a 5
joyful 5
and 5
happy 5
state 5
is 5
through 5
renunciation 5
and 5
selflimitation 5
everywhere 5
where 5
can 5
the 5
strength 5
for 5
such 5
a 5
process 5
come 5
from 5
only 5
from 5
those 5
who 5
have 5
had 5
the 5
chance 5
in 5
their 5
early 5
years 5
to 5
fortify 5
their 5
minds 5
and 5
broaden 5
their 5
outlook 5
through 5
study 5
thus 5
we 5
of 5
the 5
older 5
generation 5
look 5
to 5
you 5
and 5
hope 5
that 5
you 5
will 5
strive 5
with 5
all 5
your 5
might 5
to 5
achieve 5
what 5
was 5
denied 5
to 5
us 5
to 5
sigmund 5
freud 5
dear 5
professor 5
freud 5
it 5
is 5
admirable 5
the 5
way 5
the 5
longing 5
to 5
perceive 5
the 5
truth 5
has 5
overcome 5
every 5
other 5
desire 5
in 5
you 5
you 5
have 5
shown 5
with 5
irresistible 5
clearness 5
how 5
inseparably 5
the 5
combative 5
and 5
destructive 5
instincts 5
are 5
bound 5
up 5
with 5
the 5
amative 5
and 5
vital 5
ones 5
in 5
the 5
human 5
psyche 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
a 5
deep 5
yearning 5
for 5
that 5
great 5
consummation 5
the 5
internal 5
and 5
external 5
liberation 5
of 5
mankind 5
from 5
war 5
shines 5
out 5
from 5
the 5
ruthless 5
logic 5
of 5
your 5
expositions 5
this 5
has 5
been 5
the 5
declared 5
aim 5
of 5
all 5
those 5
who 5
have 5
been 5
honoured 5
as 5
moral 5
and 5
spiritual 5
leaders 5
beyond 5
the 5
limits 5
of 5
their 5
own 5
time 5
and 5
country 5
without 5
exception 5
from 5
jesus 5
christ 5
to 5
goethe 5
and 5
kant 5
is 5
it 5
not 5
significant 5
that 5
such 5
men 5
have 5
been 5
universally 5
accepted 5
as 5
leaders 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
their 5
efforts 5
to 5
mould 5
the 5
course 5
of 5
human 5
affairs 5
were 5
attended 5
with 5
but 5
small 5
success 5
i 5
am 5
convinced 5
that 5
the 5
great 5
menthose 5
whose 5
achievements 5
even 5
though 5
in 5
a 5
restricted 5
sphere 5
set 5
them 5
above 5
their 5
fellowsare 5
animated 5
to 5
an 5
overwhelming 5
extent 5
by 5
the 5
same 5
ideals 5
but 5
they 5
have 5
little 5
influence 5
on 5
the 5
course 5
of 5
political 5
events 5
it 5
almost 5
looks 5
as 5
if 5
this 5
domain 5
on 5
which 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
nations 5
depends 5
had 5
inevitably 5
to 5
be 5
given 5
over 5
to 5
violence 5
and 5
irresponsibility 5
political 5
leaders 5
or 5
governments 5
owe 5
their 5
position 5
partly 5
to 5
force 5
and 5
partly 5
to 5
popular 5
election 5
they 5
cannot 5
be 5
regarded 5
as 5
representative 5
of 5
the 5
best 5
elements 5
morally 5
and 5
intellectually 5
in 5
their 5
respective 5
nations 5
the 5
intellectual 5
lite 5
have 5
no 5
direct 5
influence 5
on 5
the 5
history 5
of 5
nations 5
in 5
these 5
days 5
their 5
lack 5
of 5
cohesion 5
prevents 5
them 5
from 5
taking 5
a 5
direct 5
part 5
in 5
the 5
solution 5
of 5
contemporary 5
problems 5
dont 5
you 5
think 5
that 5
a 5
change 5
might 5
be 5
brought 5
about 5
in 5
this 5
respect 5
by 5
a 5
free 5
association 5
of 5
people 5
whose 5
work 5
and 5
achievements 5
up 5
to 5
date 5
constitute 5
a 5
guarantee 5
of 5
their 5
ability 5
and 5
purity 5
of 5
aim 5
this 5
international 5
association 5
whose 5
members 5
would 5
need 5
to 5
keep 5
in 5
touch 5
with 5
each 5
other 5
by 5
a 5
constant 5
interchange 5
of 5
opinions 5
might 5
by 5
defining 5
its 5
attitude 5
in 5
the 5
pressresponsibility 5
always 5
resting 5
with 5
the 5
signatories 5
on 5
any 5
given 5
occasionacquire 5
a 5
considerable 5
and 5
salutary 5
moral 5
influence 5
over 5
the 5
settlement 5
of 5
political 5
questions 5
such 5
an 5
association 5
would 5
of 5
course 5
be 5
a 5
prey 5
to 5
all 5
the 5
ills 5
which 5
so 5
often 5
lead 5
to 5
degeneration 5
in 5
learned 5
societies 5
dangers 5
which 5
are 5
inseparably 5
bound 5
up 5
with 5
the 5
imperfection 5
of 5
human 5
nature 5
but 5
should 5
not 5
an 5
effort 5
in 5
this 5
direction 5
be 5
risked 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
this 5
i 5
look 5
upon 5
the 5
attempt 5
as 5
nothing 5
less 5
than 5
an 5
imperative 5
duty 5
if 5
an 5
intellectual 5
association 5
of 5
standing 5
such 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
described 5
could 5
be 5
formed 5
it 5
would 5
no 5
doubt 5
have 5
to 5
try 5
to 5
mobilize 5
the 5
religious 5
organizations 5
for 5
the 5
fight 5
against 5
war 5
it 5
would 5
give 5
countenance 5
to 5
many 5
whose 5
good 5
intentions 5
are 5
paralysed 5
today 5
by 5
a 5
melancholy 5
resignation 5
finally 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
an 5
association 5
formed 5
of 5
persons 5
such 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
described 5
each 5
highly 5
esteemed 5
in 5
his 5
own 5
line 5
would 5
be 5
just 5
the 5
thing 5
to 5
give 5
valuable 5
moral 5
support 5
to 5
those 5
elements 5
in 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
which 5
are 5
really 5
working 5
for 5
the 5
great 5
object 5
for 5
which 5
that 5
institution 5
exists 5
i 5
had 5
rather 5
put 5
these 5
proposals 5
to 5
you 5
than 5
to 5
anyone 5
else 5
in 5
the 5
world 5
because 5
you 5
are 5
least 5
of 5
all 5
men 5
the 5
dupe 5
of 5
your 5
desires 5
and 5
because 5
your 5
critical 5
judgment 5
is 5
supported 5
by 5
a 5
most 5
earnest 5
sense 5
of 5
responsibility 5
compulsory 5
service 5
from 5
a 5
letter 5
instead 5
of 5
permission 5
being 5
given 5
to 5
germany 5
to 5
introduce 5
compulsory 5
service 5
it 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
taken 5
away 5
from 5
everybody 5
else 5
in 5
future 5
none 5
but 5
mercenary 5
armies 5
should 5
be 5
permitted 5
the 5
size 5
and 5
equipment 5
of 5
which 5
should 5
be 5
discussed 5
at 5
geneva 5
this 5
would 5
be 5
better 5
for 5
france 5
than 5
to 5
have 5
to 5
permit 5
compulsory 5
service 5
in 5
germany 5
the 5
fatal 5
psychological 5
effect 5
of 5
the 5
military 5
education 5
of 5
the 5
people 5
and 5
the 5
violation 5
of 5
the 5
individuals 5
rights 5
which 5
it 5
involves 5
would 5
thus 5
be 5
avoided 5
moreover 5
it 5
would 5
be 5
much 5
easier 5
for 5
two 5
countries 5
which 5
had 5
agreed 5
to 5
compulsory 5
arbitration 5
for 5
the 5
settlement 5
of 5
all 5
disputes 5
arising 5
out 5
of 5
their 5
mutual 5
relations 5
to 5
combine 5
their 5
military 5
establishments 5
of 5
mercenaries 5
into 5
a 5
single 5
organization 5
with 5
a 5
mixed 5
staff 5
this 5
would 5
mean 5
a 5
financial 5
relief 5
and 5
increased 5
security 5
for 5
both 5
of 5
them 5
such 5
a 5
process 5
of 5
amalgamation 5
might 5
extend 5
to 5
larger 5
and 5
larger 5
combinations 5
and 5
finally 5
lead 5
to 5
an 5
international 5
police 5
which 5
would 5
be 5
bound 5
gradually 5
to 5
degenerate 5
as 5
international 5
security 5
increased 5
will 5
you 5
discuss 5
this 5
proposal 5
with 5
our 5
friends 5
by 5
way 5
of 5
setting 5
the 5
ball 5
rolling 5
of 5
course 5
i 5
do 5
not 5
in 5
the 5
least 5
insist 5
on 5
this 5
particular 5
proposal 5
but 5
i 5
do 5
think 5
it 5
essential 5
that 5
we 5
should 5
come 5
forward 5
with 5
a 5
positive 5
programme 5
a 5
merely 5
negative 5
policy 5
is 5
unlikely 5
to 5
produce 5
any 5
practical 5
results 5
germany 5
and 5
france 5
mutual 5
trust 5
and 5
cooperation 5
between 5
france 5
and 5
germany 5
can 5
come 5
about 5
only 5
if 5
the 5
french 5
demand 5
for 5
security 5
against 5
military 5
attack 5
is 5
satisfied 5
but 5
should 5
france 5
frame 5
demands 5
in 5
accordance 5
with 5
this 5
such 5
a 5
step 5
would 5
certainly 5
be 5
taken 5
very 5
ill 5
in 5
germany 5
a 5
procedure 5
something 5
like 5
the 5
following 5
seems 5
however 5
to 5
be 5
possible 5
let 5
the 5
german 5
government 5
of 5
its 5
own 5
free 5
will 5
propose 5
to 5
the 5
french 5
that 5
they 5
should 5
jointly 5
make 5
representations 5
to 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
that 5
it 5
should 5
suggest 5
to 5
all 5
member 5
states 5
to 5
bind 5
themselves 5
to 5
the 5
following 5
to 5
submit 5
to 5
every 5
decision 5
of 5
the 5
international 5
court 5
of 5
arbitration 5
to 5
proceed 5
with 5
all 5
its 5
economic 5
and 5
military 5
force 5
in 5
concert 5
with 5
the 5
other 5
members 5
of 5
the 5
league 5
against 5
any 5
state 5
which 5
breaks 5
the 5
peace 5
or 5
resists 5
an 5
international 5
decision 5
made 5
in 5
the 5
interests 5
of 5
world 5
peace 5
arbitration 5
systematic 5
disarmament 5
within 5
a 5
short 5
period 5
this 5
is 5
possible 5
only 5
in 5
combination 5
with 5
the 5
guarantee 5
of 5
all 5
for 5
the 5
security 5
of 5
each 5
separate 5
nation 5

on 5
a 5
permanent 5

merely 5
to 5
accept 5
the 5
decisions 5
of 5
the 5

also 5

in 5

the 5

everywhere 5
better 5

the 5

have 5
for 5
the 5
first 5

drawn 5
the 5
logical 5
conclusion 5

can 5
only 5

alone 5
peoples 5
minds 5
must 5
above 5
all 5
be 5
prepared 5
for 5
it 5
we 5
must 5
try 5
gradually 5
to 5
awaken 5
in 5
them 5
a 5
sense 5
of 5
solidarity 5
which 5
does 5
not 5
as 5
hitherto 5
stop 5
at 5
frontiers 5
it 5
is 5
with 5
this 5
in 5
mind 5
that 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
has 5
created 5
the 5
commission 5
de 5
coopration 5
intellectuelle 5
this 5
commission 5
is 5
to 5
be 5
an 5
absolutely 5
international 5
and 5
entirely 5
nonpolitical 5
authority 5
whose 5
business 5
it 5
is 5
to 5
put 5
the 5
intellectuals 5
of 5
all 5
the 5
nations 5
who 5
were 5
isolated 5
by 5
the 5
war 5
into 5
touch 5
with 5
each 5
other 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
difficult 5
task 5
for 5
it 5
has 5
alas 5
to 5
be 5
admitted 5
thatat 5
least 5
in 5
the 5
countries 5
with 5
which 5
i 5
am 5
most 5
closely 5
acquaintedthe 5
artists 5
and 5
men 5
of 5
learning 5
are 5
governed 5
by 5
narrowly 5
nationalist 5
feelings 5
to 5
a 5
far 5
greater 5
extent 5
than 5
the 5
men 5
of 5
affairs 5
hitherto 5
this 5
commission 5
has 5
met 5
twice 5
a 5
year 5
to 5
make 5
its 5
efforts 5
more 5
effective 5
the 5
french 5
government 5
has 5
decided 5
to 5
create 5
and 5
maintain 5
a 5
permanent 5
institute 5
for 5
intellectual 5
cooperation 5
which 5
is 5
just 5
now 5
to 5
be 5
opened 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
generous 5
act 5
on 5
the 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
french 5
nation 5
and 5
deserves 5
the 5
thanks 5
of 5
all 5
it 5
is 5
an 5
easy 5
and 5
grateful 5
task 5
to 5
rejoice 5
and 5
praise 5
and 5
say 5
nothing 5
about 5
the 5
things 5
one 5
regrets 5
or 5
disapproves 5
of 5
but 5
honesty 5
alone 5
can 5
help 5
our 5
work 5
forward 5
so 5
i 5
will 5
not 5
shrink 5
from 5
combining 5
criticism 5
with 5
this 5
greeting 5
to 5
the 5
newborn 5
child 5
i 5
have 5
daily 5
occasion 5
for 5
observing 5
that 5
the 5
greatest 5
obstacle 5
which 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
our 5
commission 5
has 5
to 5
encounter 5
is 5
the 5
lack 5
of 5
confidence 5
in 5
its 5
political 5
impartiality 5
everything 5
must 5
be 5
done 5
to 5
strengthen 5
that 5
confidence 5
and 5
everything 5
avoided 5
that 5
might 5
harm 5
it 5
when 5
therefore 5
the 5
french 5
government 5
sets 5
up 5
and 5
maintains 5
an 5
institute 5
out 5
of 5
public 5
funds 5
in 5
paris 5
as 5
a 5
permanent 5
organ 5
of 5
the 5
commission 5
with 5
a 5
frenchman 5
as 5
its 5
director 5
the 5
outside 5
observer 5
can 5
hardly 5
avoid 5
the 5
impression 5
that 5
french 5
influence 5
predominates 5
in 5
the 5
commission 5
this 5
impression 5
is 5
further 5
strengthened 5
by 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
so 5
far 5
a 5
frenchman 5
has 5
also 5
been 5
chairman 5
of 5
the 5
commission 5
itself 5
although 5
the 5
individuals 5
in 5
question 5
are 5
men 5
of 5
the 5
highest 5
reputation 5
liked 5
and 5
respected 5
everywhere 5
nevertheless 5
the 5
impression 5
remains 5
dixi 5
et 5
salvavi 5
animam 5
naeam 5
i 5
hope 5
with 5
all 5
my 5
heart 5
that 5
the 5
new 5
institute 5
by 5
constant 5
interaction 5
with 5
the 5
commission 5
will 5
succeed 5
in 5
promoting 5
their 5
common 5
ends 5
and 5
winning 5
the 5
confidence 5
and 5
recognition 5
of 5
intellectual 5
workers 5
all 5
over 5
the 5
world 5
a 5
farewell 5
a 5
letter 5
to 5
the 5
german 5
secretary 5
of 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
dear 5
herr 5
dufourferonce 5
your 5
kind 5
letter 5
must 5
not 5
go 5
unanswered 5
otherwise 5
you 5
may 5
get 5
a 5
mistaken 5
notion 5
of 5
my 5
attitude 5
the 5
grounds 5
for 5
my 5
resolve 5
to 5
go 5
to 5
geneva 5
no 5
more 5
are 5
as 5
follows 5
experience 5
has 5
unhappily 5
taught 5
me 5
that 5
the 5
commission 5
taken 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
stands 5
for 5
no 5
serious 5
determination 5
to 5
make 5
real 5
progress 5
with 5
the 5
task 5
of 5
improving 5
international 5
relations 5
it 5
looks 5
to 5
me 5
far 5
more 5
like 5
an 5
embodiment 5
of 5
the 5
principle 5
ut 5
aliquid 5
fieri 5
videatur 5
the 5
commission 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
even 5
worse 5
in 5
this 5
respect 5
than 5
the 5
league 5
taken 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
it 5
is 5
precisely 5
because 5
i 5
desire 5
to 5
work 5
with 5
all 5
my 5
might 5
for 5
the 5
establishment 5
of 5
an 5
international 5
arbitrating 5
and 5
regulative 5
authority 5
superior 5
to 5
the 5
state 5
and 5
because 5
i 5
have 5
this 5
object 5
so 5
very 5
much 5
at 5
heart 5
that 5
i 5
feel 5
compelled 5
to 5
leave 5
the 5
commission 5
the 5
commission 5
has 5
given 5
its 5
blessing 5
to 5
the 5
oppression 5
of 5
the 5
cultural 5
minorities 5
in 5
all 5
countries 5
by 5
causing 5
a 5
national 5
commission 5
to 5
be 5
set 5
up 5
in 5
each 5
of 5
them 5
which 5
is 5
to 5
form 5
the 5
only 5
channel 5
of 5
communication 5
between 5
the 5
intellectuals 5
of 5
a 5
country 5
and 5
the 5
commission 5
it 5
has 5
thereby 5
deliberately 5
abandoned 5
its 5
function 5
of 5
giving 5
moral 5
support 5
to 5
the 5
national 5
minorities 5
in 5
their 5
struggle 5
against 5
cultural 5
oppression 5
further 5
the 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
commission 5
in 5
the 5
matter 5
of 5
combating 5
the 5
chauvinistic 5
and 5
militaristic 5
tendencies 5
of 5
education 5
in 5
the 5
various 5
countries 5
has 5
been 5
so 5
lukewarm 5
that 5
no 5
serious 5
efforts 5
in 5
this 5
fundamentally 5
important 5
sphere 5
can 5
be 5
hoped 5
for 5
from 5
it 5
the 5
commission 5
has 5
invariably 5
failed 5
to 5
give 5
moral 5
support 5
to 5
those 5
individuals 5
and 5
associations 5
who 5
have 5
thrown 5
themselves 5
without 5
reserve 5
into 5
the 5
business 5
of 5
working 5
for 5
an 5
international 5
order 5
and 5
against 5
the 5
military 5
system 5
the 5
commission 5
has 5
never 5
made 5
any 5
attempt 5
to 5
resist 5
the 5
appointment 5
of 5
members 5
whom 5
it 5
knew 5
to 5
stand 5
for 5
tendencies 5
the 5
very 5
reverse 5
of 5
those 5
it 5
is 5
bound 5
in 5
duty 5
to 5
foster 5
i 5
will 5
not 5
worry 5
you 5
with 5
any 5
further 5
arguments 5
since 5
you 5
will 5
understand 5
my 5
resolve 5
yell 5
enough 5
from 5
these 5
few 5
hints 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
my 5
business 5
to 5
draw 5
up 5
an 5
indictment 5
but 5
merely 5
to 5
explain 5
my 5
position 5
if 5
i 5
nourished 5
any 5
hope 5
whatever 5
i 5
should 5
act 5
differentlyof 5
that 5
you 5
may 5
be 5
sure 5
the 5
question 5
of 5
disarmament 5
the 5
greatest 5
obstacle 5
to 5
the 5
success 5
of 5
the 5
disarmament 5
plan 5
was 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
people 5
in 5
general 5
left 5
out 5
of 5
account 5
the 5
chief 5
difficulties 5
of 5
the 5
problem 5
most 5
objects 5
are 5
gained 5
by 5
gradual 5
steps 5
for 5
example 5
the 5
supersession 5
of 5
absolute 5
monarchy 5
by 5
democracy 5
here 5
however 5
we 5
are 5
concerned 5
with 5
an 5
objective 5
which 5
cannot 5
be 5
reached 5
step 5
by 5
step 5
as 5
long 5
as 5
the 5
possibility 5
of 5
war 5
remains 5
nations 5
will 5
insist 5
on 5
being 5
as 5
perfectly 5
prepared 5
militarily 5
as 5
they 5
can 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
emerge 5
triumphant 5
from 5
the 5
next 5
war 5
it 5
will 5
also 5
be 5
impossible 5
to 5
avoid 5

the 5
youth 5
in 5
warlike 5
traditions 5

cultivating 5
narrow 5
national 5
vanity 5
joined 5
to 5
the 5
glorification 5
of 5
the 5
warlike 5
spirit 5
as 5
long 5
as 5
people 5
have 5
to 5
be 5
prepared 5
for 5
occasions 5
when 5
such 5

preparations 5
not 5
for 5
peace 5
but 5
for 5
war 5
therefore 5
people 5
will 5
not 5
disarm 5
step 5
by 5
step 5
they 5
will 5
disarm 5
at 5
one 5
blow 5
or 5
not 5
at 5
all 5
the 5
accomplishment 5
of 5
such 5
a 5
farreaching 5
change 5
in 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
nations 5
presupposes 5
a 5
mighty 5
moral 5
effort 5
a 5
deliberate 5
departure 5
from 5
deeply 5
ingrained 5
tradition 5
anyone 5
who 5
is 5
not 5
prepared 5

the 5

his 5

entirely 5
on 5
the 5

of 5
an 5

to 5
enter 5
into 5
a 5
treaty 5
to 5
this 5
effect 5
without 5
reserve 5
is 5
not 5
really 5
resolved 5
to 5
avoid 5
war 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
case 5
of 5
all 5

nothing 5
it 5
is 5
undeniable 5
that 5
previous 5
attempts 5
to 5
ensure 5
peace 5
have 5
failed 5
through 5
aiming 5
at 5
inadequate 5
compromises 5
disarmament 5
and 5
security 5
are 5
only 5
to 5
be 5
had 5
in 5
combination 5
the 5
one 5
guarantee 5
of 5
security 5
is 5
an 5
undertaking 5
by 5
all 5
nations 5
to 5
give 5
effect 5
to 5
the 5
decisions 5
of 5
the 5
international 5
authority 5
we 5
stand 5
therefore 5
at 5
the 5
parting 5
of 5
the 5
ways 5
whether 5
we 5
find 5
the 5
way 5
of 5
peace 5
or 5
continue 5
along 5
the 5
old 5
road 5
of 5
brute 5
force 5
so 5
unworthy 5
of 5
our 5
civilization 5
depends 5
on 5
ourselves 5
on 5
the 5
one 5
side 5
the 5
freedom 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
and 5
the 5
security 5
of 5
society 5
beckon 5
to 5
us 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
slavery 5
for 5
the 5
individual 5
and 5
the 5
annihilation 5
of 5
our 5
civilization 5
threaten 5
us 5
our 5
fate 5
will 5
be 5
according 5
to 5
our 5
deserts 5
the 5
disarmament 5
conference 5
of 5
i 5
may 5
i 5
begin 5
with 5
an 5
article 5
of 5
political 5
faith 5
it 5
runs 5
as 5
follows 5
the 5
state 5
is 5
made 5
for 5
man 5
not 5
man 5
for 5
the 5
state 5
and 5
in 5
this 5
respect 5
science 5
resembles 5
the 5
state 5
these 5
are 5
old 5
sayings 5
coined 5
by 5
men 5
for 5
whom 5
human 5
personality 5
was 5
the 5
highest 5
human 5
good 5
i 5
should 5
shrink 5
from 5
repeating 5
them 5
were 5
it 5
not 5
that 5
they 5
are 5
for 5
ever 5
threatening 5
to 5
fall 5
into 5
oblivion 5
particularly 5
in 5
these 5
days 5
of 5
organization 5
and 5
mechanization 5
i 5
regard 5
it 5
as 5
the 5
chief 5
duty 5
of 5
the 5
state 5
to 5
protect 5
the 5
individual 5
and 5
give 5
him 5
the 5
opportunity 5
to 5
develop 5
into 5
a 5
creative 5
personality 5
that 5
is 5
to 5
say 5
the 5
state 5
should 5
be 5
our 5
servant 5
and 5
not 5
we 5
its 5
slaves 5
the 5
state 5
transgresses 5
this 5
commandment 5
when 5
it 5
compels 5
us 5
by 5
force 5
to 5
engage 5
in 5
military 5
and 5
war 5
service 5
the 5
more 5
so 5
since 5
the 5
object 5
and 5
the 5
effect 5
of 5
this 5
slavish 5
service 5
is 5
to 5
kill 5
people 5
belonging 5
to 5
other 5
countries 5
or 5
interfere 5
with 5
their 5
freedom 5
of 5
development 5
we 5
are 5
only 5
to 5
make 5
such 5
sacrifices 5
to 5
the 5
state 5
as 5
will 5
promote 5
the 5
free 5
development 5
of 5
individual 5
human 5
beings 5
to 5
any 5
american 5
all 5
this 5
may 5
be 5
a 5
platitude 5
but 5
not 5
to 5
any 5
european 5
hence 5
we 5
may 5
hope 5
that 5
the 5
fight 5
against 5
war 5
will 5
find 5
strong 5
support 5
among 5
americans 5
and 5
now 5
for 5
the 5
disarmament 5
conference 5
ought 5
one 5
to 5
laugh 5
weep 5
or 5
hope 5
when 5
one 5
thinks 5
of 5
it 5
imagine 5
a 5
city 5
inhabited 5
by 5
fierytempered 5
dishonest 5
and 5
quarrelsome 5
citizens 5
the 5
constant 5
danger 5
to 5
life 5
there 5
is 5
felt 5
as 5
a 5
serious 5
handicap 5
which 5
makes 5
all 5
healthy 5
development 5
impossible 5
the 5
magistrate 5
desires 5
to 5
remedy 5
this 5
abominable 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
although 5
all 5
his 5
counsellors 5
and 5
the 5
rest 5
of 5
the 5
citizens 5
insist 5
on 5
continuing 5
to 5
carry 5
a 5
dagger 5
in 5
their 5
girdles 5
after 5
years 5
of 5
preparation 5
the 5
magistrate 5
determines 5
to 5
compromise 5
and 5
raises 5
the 5
question 5
how 5
long 5
and 5
how 5
sharp 5
the 5
dagger 5
is 5
allowed 5
to 5
be 5
which 5
anyone 5
may 5
carry 5
in 5
his 5
belt 5
when 5
he 5
goes 5
out 5
as 5
long 5
as 5
the 5
cunning 5
citizens 5
do 5
not 5
suppress 5
knifing 5
by 5
legislation 5
the 5
courts 5
and 5
the 5
police 5
things 5
go 5
on 5
in 5
the 5
old 5
way 5
of 5
course 5
a 5
definition 5
of 5
the 5
length 5
and 5
sharpness 5
of 5
the 5
permitted 5
dagger 5
will 5
help 5
only 5
the 5
strongest 5
and 5
most 5
turbulent 5
and 5
leave 5
the 5
weaker 5
at 5
their 5
mercy 5
you 5
will 5
all 5
understand 5
the 5
meaning 5
of 5
this 5
parable 5
it 5
is 5
true 5
that 5
we 5
have 5
a 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
and 5
a 5
court 5
of 5
arbitration 5
but 5
the 5
league 5
is 5
not 5
much 5
more 5
than 5
a 5
meetinghall 5
and 5
the 5
court 5
has 5
no 5
means 5
of 5
enforcing 5
its 5
decisions 5
these 5
institutions 5
provide 5
no 5
security 5
for 5
any 5
country 5
in 5
case 5
of 5
an 5
attack 5
on 5
it 5
if 5
you 5
bear 5
this 5
in 5
mind 5
you 5
will 5
judge 5
the 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
french 5
their 5
refusal 5
to 5
disarm 5
without 5
security 5
less 5
harshly 5
than 5
it 5
is 5
usually 5
judged 5
at 5
present 5
unless 5
we 5
can 5
agree 5
to 5
limit 5
the 5
sovereignty 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
state 5
by 5
all 5
binding 5
ourselves 5
to 5
take 5
joint 5
action 5
against 5
any 5
country 5
which 5
openly 5
or 5
secretly 5
resists 5
a 5
judgment 5
of 5
the 5
court 5
of 5
arbitration 5
we 5
shall 5
never 5
get 5
out 5
of 5
a 5
state 5
of 5
universal 5
anarchy 5
and 5
terror 5
no 5
sleight 5
of 5
hand 5
can 5
reconcile 5
the 5
unlimited 5
sovereignty 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
country 5
with 5
security 5
against 5
attack 5
will 5
it 5
need 5
new 5
disasters 5
to 5
induce 5
the 5
countries 5
to 5
undertake 5
to 5
enforce 5
every 5
decision 5
of 5
the 5
recognized 5
international 5
court 5
the 5
progress 5
of 5
events 5
so 5
far 5
scarcely 5
justifies 5
us 5
in 5
hoping 5
for 5
anything 5
better 5
in 5
the 5
near 5
future 5
but 5
everyone 5
who 5
cares 5
for 5
civilization 5
and 5
justice 5
must 5
exert 5
all 5
his 5
strength 5
to 5
convince 5
his 5
fellows 5
of 5
the 5
necessity 5
for 5
laying 5
all 5
countries 5
under 5
an 5
international 5
obligation 5
of 5
this 5
kind 5
it 5
will 5
be 5
urged 5
against 5
this 5
notion 5
not 5
without 5
a 5
certain 5
justification 5
that 5
it 5
overestimates 5
the 5
efficacy 5
of 5
machinery 5
and 5
neglects 5
the 5
psychological 5
or 5
rather 5
the 5
moral 5
factor 5
spiritual 5
disarmament 5
people 5
insist 5
must 5
precede 5
material 5
disarmament 5
they 5
say 5
further 5
and 5
truly 5
that 5
the 5
greatest 5
obstacle 5
to 5
international 5
order 5
is 5
that 5
monstrously 5
exaggerated 5
spirit 5
of 5
nationalism 5
which 5
also 5
goes 5
by 5
the 5
fairsounding 5
but 5
misused 5
name 5
of 5
patriotism 5
during 5
the 5
last 5
century 5
and 5
a 5
half 5
this 5
idol 5
has 5
acquired 5
an 5
uncanny 5
and 5
exceedingly 5
pernicious 5
power 5
everywhere 5
to 5
estimate 5
this 5
objection 5
at 5
its 5
proper 5
worth 5
one 5
must 5
realize 5
that 5
a 5
reciprocal 5
relation 5
exists 5
between 5
external 5
machinery 5
and 5
internal 5
states 5
of 5
mind 5
not 5
only 5
does 5
the 5
machinery 5
depend 5
on 5
traditional 5
modes 5
of 5
feeling 5
and 5
owe 5
its 5
origin 5
and 5
its 5
survival 5
to 5
them 5
but 5
the 5
existing 5
machinery 5
in 5
its 5
turn 5
exercises 5
a 5
powerful 5
influence 5
on 5
national 5
modes 5
of 5
feeling 5
the 5
present 5
deplorably 5
high 5
development 5
of 5
nationalism 5
everywhere 5
is 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
intimately 5
connected 5
with 5
the 5
institution 5
of 5
compulsory 5
military 5
service 5
or 5
to 5
call 5
it 5
by 5
its 5
less 5
offensive 5
name 5
national 5
armies 5
a 5
country 5
which 5
demands 5
military 5
service 5
of 5
its 5
inhabitants 5
is 5
compelled 5
to 5
cultivate 5
a 5
nationalistic 5
spirit 5
in 5
them 5
which 5
provides 5
the 5
psychological 5
foundation 5
of 5
military 5
efficiency 5
along 5
with 5
this 5
religion 5
it 5
has 5
to 5
hold 5
up 5
its 5
instrument 5
brute 5
force 5
to 5
the 5
admiration 5
of 5
the 5
youth 5
in 5
its 5
schools 5
the 5
introduction 5
of 5
compulsory 5
service 5
is 5
therefore 5
to 5
my 5
mind 5
the 5
prime 5
cause 5
of 5
the 5
moral 5
collapse 5
of 5
the 5
white 5
race 5
which 5
seriously 5
threatens 5
not 5
merely 5
the 5
survival 5
of 5
our 5
civilization 5
but 5
our 5
very 5
existence 5
this 5
curse 5
along 5
with 5
great 5
social 5
blessings 5
started 5
with 5
the 5
french 5
revolution 5
and 5
before 5
long 5
dragged 5
all 5
the 5
other 5
nations 5
in 5
its 5
train 5
therefore 5
those 5
who 5
desire 5
to 5
encourage 5
the 5
growth 5
of 5
an 5
international 5
spirit 5
and 5
to 5
combat 5
chauvinism 5
must 5
take 5
their 5
stand 5
against 5
compulsory 5
service 5
is 5
the 5
severe 5
persecution 5
to 5
which 5
conscientious 5
objectors 5
to 5
military 5
service 5
are 5
subjected 5
today 5
a 5
whit 5
less 5
disgraceful 5
to 5
the 5
community 5
than 5
those 5
to 5
which 5
the 5
martyrs 5
of 5
religion 5
were 5
exposed 5
in 5
former 5
centuries 5
can 5
you 5
as 5
the 5
kellogg 5
pact 5
does 5
condemn 5
war 5
and 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
leave 5
the 5
individual 5
to 5
the 5
tender 5
mercies 5
of 5
the 5
war 5
machine 5
in 5
each 5
country 5
if 5
in 5
view 5
of 5
the 5
disarmament 5
conference 5
we 5
are 5
not 5
to 5
restrict 5
ourselves 5
to 5
the 5
technical 5
problems 5
of 5
organization 5
involved 5
but 5
also 5
to 5
tackle 5
the 5
psychological 5
question 5
more 5
directly 5
from 5
educational 5
motives 5
we 5
must 5
try 5
on 5
international 5
lines 5
to 5
invent 5
some 5
legal 5
way 5
by 5
which 5
the 5
individual 5
can 5
refuse 5
to 5
serve 5
in 5
the 5
army 5
such 5
a 5
regulation 5
would 5
undoubtedly 5
produce 5
a 5
great 5
moral 5
effect 5
this 5
is 5
my 5
position 5
in 5
a 5
nutshell 5
mere 5
agreements 5
to 5
limit 5
armaments 5
furnish 5
no 5
sort 5
of 5
security 5
compulsory 5
arbitration 5
must 5
be 5
supported 5
by 5
an 5
executive 5
force 5
guaranteed 5
by 5
all 5
the 5
participating 5
countries 5
which 5
is 5
ready 5
to 5
proceed 5
against 5
the 5
disturber 5
of 5
the 5
peace 5
with 5
economic 5
and 5
military 5
sanctions 5
compulsory 5
service 5
as 5
the 5
bulwark 5
of 5
unhealthy 5
nationalism 5
must 5
be 5
combated 5
most 5
important 5
of 5
all 5
conscientious 5
objectors 5
must 5
be 5
protected 5
on 5
an 5
international 5
basis 5
finally 5
i 5
would 5
draw 5
your 5
attention 5
to 5
a 5
book 5
war 5
again 5
tomorrow 5
by 5
ludwig 5
bauer 5
which 5
discusses 5
the 5
issues 5
here 5
involved 5
in 5
an 5
acute 5
and 5
unprejudiced 5
manner 5
and 5
with 5

the 5
benefits 5
that 5
the 5
inventive 5
genius 5
of 5
man 5
has 5
conferred 5
on 5
us 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
hundred 5
years 5
could 5
make 5
life 5
happy 5
and 5
carefree 5
if 5
organization 5
had 5
been 5
able 5
to 5
keep 5
pace 5
with 5
technical 5
progress 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
these 5
hardwon 5
achievements 5
in 5
the 5
hands 5
of 5
our 5
generation 5
are 5
like 5
a 5

of 5
a 5
child 5
of 5
three 5
the 5

hunger 5
instead 5
of 5
freedom 5
the 5
results 5
of 5
technical 5
progress 5
are 5
most 5
baleful 5
where 5
they 5
furnish 5
means 5
for 5
the 5
destruction 5
of 5
human 5
life 5
and 5
the 5
hardwon 5
fruits 5
of 5
toil 5
as 5
we 5
of 5
the 5
older 5
generation 5
experienced 5
to 5
our 5
horror 5
in 5
the 5
great 5
war 5
more 5
dreadful 5
even 5
than 5
the 5
destruction 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
is 5
the 5
humiliating 5
slavery 5
into 5
which 5
war 5
plunges 5
the 5
individual 5
is 5
it 5
not 5
a 5
terrible 5
thing 5
to 5
be 5
forced 5
by 5
the 5
community 5
to 5
do 5
things 5
which 5
every 5
individual 5
regards 5
as 5
abominable 5
crimes 5
only 5
a 5
few 5
had 5
the 5
moral 5
greatness 5
to 5
resist 5
them 5
i 5
regard 5
as 5
the 5
real 5
heroes 5
of 5
the 5
great 5
war 5
there 5
is 5
one 5
ray 5
of 5
hope 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
the 5
responsible 5
leaders 5
of 5
the 5
nations 5
do 5
in 5
the 5
main 5
honestly 5
desire 5
to 5
abolish 5
war 5
the 5
resistance 5
to 5
this 5
essential 5
step 5
forward 5
comes 5
from 5
those 5
unfortunate 5
national 5
traditions 5
which 5
are 5
handed 5
on 5
like 5
a 5
hereditary 5
disease 5
from 5
generation 5
to 5
generation 5
through 5
the 5
workings 5
of 5
the 5
educational 5
system 5
the 5
principal 5
vehicle 5
of 5
this 5
tradition 5
is 5
military 5
training 5
and 5
its 5
glorification 5
and 5
equally 5
that 5
portion 5
of 5
the 5
press 5
which 5
is 5
controlled 5
by 5
heavy 5
industry 5
and 5
the 5
soldiers 5
without 5
disarmament 5
there 5
can 5
be 5
no 5
lasting 5
peace 5
conversely 5
the 5
continuation 5
of 5
military 5
preparations 5
on 5
the 5
present 5
scale 5
will 5
inevitably 5
lead 5
to 5
new 5
catastrophes 5
that 5
is 5
why 5
the 5
disarmament 5
conference 5
of 5
will 5
decide 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
this 5
generation 5
and 5
the 5
next 5
when 5
one 5
thinks 5
how 5
pitiable 5
taken 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
have 5
been 5
the 5
results 5
of 5
former 5
conferences 5
it 5
becomes 5
clear 5
that 5
it 5
is 5
the 5
duty 5
of 5
all 5
intelligent 5
and 5
responsible 5
people 5
to 5
exert 5
their 5
full 5
powers 5
to 5
remind 5
public 5
opinion 5
again 5
and 5
again 5
of 5
the 5
importance 5
of 5
the 5
conference 5
only 5
if 5
the 5
statesmen 5
have 5
behind 5
them 5
the 5
will 5
to 5
peace 5
of 5
a 5
decisive 5
majority 5
in 5
their 5
own 5
countries 5
can 5
they 5
attain 5
their 5
great 5
end 5
and 5
for 5
the 5
formation 5
of 5
this 5
public 5
opinion 5
each 5
one 5
of 5
us 5
is 5
responsible 5
in 5
every 5
word 5
and 5
deed 5
the 5
doom 5
of 5
the 5
conference 5
would 5
be 5
sealed 5
if 5
the 5
delegates 5
came 5
to 5
it 5
with 5
readymade 5
instructions 5
the 5
carrying 5
out 5
of 5
which 5
would 5
soon 5
become 5
a 5
matter 5
of 5
prestige 5
this 5
seems 5
to 5
be 5
generally 5
realized 5
for 5
meetings 5
between 5
the 5
statesmen 5
of 5
two 5
nations 5
at 5
a 5
time 5
which 5
have 5
become 5
very 5
frequent 5
of 5
late 5
have 5
been 5
used 5
to 5
prepare 5
the 5
ground 5
for 5
the 5
conference 5
by 5
conversations 5
about 5
the 5
disarmament 5
problem 5
this 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
a 5
very 5
happy 5
device 5
for 5
two 5
men 5
or 5
groups 5
of 5
men 5
can 5
usually 5
discuss 5
things 5
together 5
most 5
reasonably 5
honestly 5
and 5
dispassionately 5
when 5
there 5
is 5
no 5
third 5
person 5
present 5
in 5
front 5
of 5
whom 5
they 5
think 5
they 5
must 5
be 5
careful 5
what 5
they 5
say 5
only 5
if 5
exhaustive 5
preparations 5
of 5
this 5
kind 5
are 5
made 5
for 5
the 5
conference 5
if 5
surprises 5
are 5
thereby 5
ruled 5
out 5
and 5
an 5
atmosphere 5
of 5
confidence 5
is 5
created 5
by 5
genuine 5
good 5
will 5
can 5
we 5
hope 5
for 5
a 5
happy 5
issue 5
in 5
these 5
great 5
matters 5
success 5
is 5
not 5
a 5
matter 5
of 5
cleverness 5
still 5
less 5
of 5
cunning 5
but 5
of 5
honesty 5
and 5
confidence 5
the 5
moral 5
element 5
cannot 5
be 5
displaced 5
by 5
reason 5
thank 5
heaven 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
the 5
individual 5
spectators 5
duty 5
merely 5
to 5
wait 5
and 5
criticize 5
he 5
must 5
serve 5
the 5
cause 5
by 5
all 5
means 5
in 5
his 5
power 5
the 5
fate 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
will 5
be 5
such 5
as 5
the 5
world 5
deserves 5
america 5
and 5
the 5
disarmasnent 5
conference 5
the 5
americans 5
of 5
today 5
are 5
filled 5
with 5
the 5
cares 5
arising 5
out 5
of 5
economic 5
conditions 5
in 5
their 5
own 5
country 5
the 5
efforts 5
of 5
their 5
responsible 5
leaders 5
are 5
directed 5
primarily 5
to 5
remedying 5
the 5
serious 5
unemployment 5
at 5
home 5
the 5
sense 5
of 5
being 5
involved 5
in 5
the 5
destiny 5
of 5
the 5
rest 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
and 5
in 5
particular 5
of 5
the 5
mother 5
country 5
of 5
europe 5
is 5
even 5
less 5
strong 5
than 5
in 5
normal 5
times 5
but 5
the 5
free 5
play 5
of 5
economic 5
forces 5
will 5
not 5
by 5
itself 5
automatically 5
overcome 5
these 5
difficulties 5
regulative 5
measures 5
by 5
the 5
community 5
are 5
needed 5
to 5
bring 5
about 5
a 5
sound 5
distribution 5
of 5
labour 5
and 5
consumptiongoods 5
among 5
mankind 5
without 5
them 5
even 5
the 5
people 5

the 5
richest 5
country 5
suffocate 5
the 5
fact 5
is 5
that 5
since 5
the 5
amount 5
of 5
work 5
needed 5
to 5
supply 5
everybodys 5
needs 5
has 5
been 5
reduced 5
through 5
the 5
improvement 5
of 5
technical 5
methods 5
the 5
free 5
play 5
of 5
economic 5
forces 5
no 5
longer 5
produces 5
a 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
in 5
which 5
all 5
the 5
available 5
labour 5
can 5
find 5
employment 5
deliberate 5
regulation 5
and 5
organization 5
are 5
becoming 5
necessary 5
to 5
make 5
the 5
results 5
of 5
technical 5
progress 5
beneficial 5
to 5
all 5
if 5
the 5
economic 5
situation 5
cannot 5
be 5
cleared 5
up 5
without 5
systematic 5
regulation 5
how 5
much 5
more 5
necessary 5
is 5
such 5
regulation 5
for 5
dealing 5
with 5
the 5
problems 5
of 5
international 5
politics 5
few 5
people 5
still 5
cling 5
to 5
the 5
notion 5
that 5
acts 5
of 5
violence 5
in 5
the 5
shape 5
of 5
wars 5
are 5
either 5
advantageous 5
or 5
worthy 5
of 5
humanity 5
as 5
a 5
method 5
of 5
solving 5
international 5
problems 5
but 5
they 5
are 5
not 5
logical 5
enough 5
to 5
make 5
vigorous 5
efforts 5
on 5
behalf 5
of 5
the 5
measures 5
which 5
might 5
prevent 5
war 5
that 5
savage 5
and 5
unworthy 5
relic 5
of 5
the 5
age 5
of 5
barbarism 5
it 5
requires 5
some 5
power 5
of 5
reflection 5
to 5
see 5
the 5
issue 5
clearly 5
and 5
a 5
certain 5
courage 5
to 5
serve 5
this 5
great 5
cause 5
resolutely 5
and 5
effectively 5
anybody 5
who 5
really 5
wants 5
to 5
abolish 5
war 5
must 5
resolutely 5
declare 5
himself 5
in 5
favour 5
of 5
his 5
own 5
countrys 5
resigning 5
a 5
portion 5
of 5
its 5
sovereignty 5
in 5
favour 5
of 5
international 5
institutions 5
he 5
must 5
be 5
ready 5
to 5
make 5
his 5
own 5
country 5
amenable 5
in 5
case 5
of 5
a 5
dispute 5
to 5
the 5
award 5
of 5
an 5
international 5
court 5
he 5
must 5
in 5
the 5
most 5
uncompromising 5
fashion 5
support 5
disarmament 5
all 5
round 5
which 5
is 5
actually 5
envisaged 5
in 5
the 5
unfortunate 5
treaty 5
of 5
versailles 5
unless 5
military 5
and 5
aggressively 5
patriotic 5
education 5
is 5
abolished 5
we 5
can 5
hope 5
for 5
no 5
progress 5
no 5
event 5
of 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
years 5
reflects 5
such 5
disgrace 5
on 5
the 5
leading 5
civilized 5
countries 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
as 5
the 5
failure 5
of 5
all 5
disarmament 5
conferences 5
so 5
far 5
for 5
this 5
failure 5
is 5
due 5
not 5
only 5
to 5
the 5
intrigues 5
of 5
ambitious 5
and 5
unscrupulous 5
politicians 5
but 5
also 5
to 5
the 5
indifference 5
and 5
slackness 5
of 5
the 5
public 5
in 5
all 5
countries 5
unless 5
this 5
is 5
changed 5
we 5
shall 5
destroy 5
all 5
the 5
really 5
valuable 5
achievements 5
of 5
our 5
predecessors 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
the 5
american 5
nation 5
is 5
only 5
imperfectly 5
aware 5
of 5
the 5
responsibility 5
which 5
rests 5
with 5
it 5
in 5
this 5
matter 5
people 5
in 5
america 5
no 5
doubt 5
think 5
as 5
follows 5
let 5
europe 5
go 5
to 5
the 5
dogs 5
if 5
it 5
is 5
destroyed 5
by 5
the 5
quarrelsomeness 5
and 5
wickedness 5
of 5
its 5
inhabitants 5
the 5
good 5
seed 5
of 5
our 5
wilson 5
has 5
produced 5
a 5
mighty 5
poor 5
crop 5
in 5
the 5
stony 5
ground 5
of 5
europe 5
we 5
are 5
strong 5
and 5
safe 5
and 5
in 5
no 5
hurry 5
to 5
mix 5
ourselves 5
up 5
in 5
other 5
peoples 5
affairs 5
such 5
an 5
attitude 5
is 5
at 5
once 5
base 5
and 5
shortsighted 5
america 5
is 5
partly 5
to 5
blame 5
for 5
the 5
difficulties 5
of 5
europe 5
by 5
ruthlessly 5
pressing 5
her 5
claims 5
she 5
is 5
hastening 5
the 5
economic 5
and 5
therewith 5
the 5
moral 5
collapse 5
of 5
europe 5
she 5
has 5
helped 5
to 5
balkanize 5
europe 5
and 5
therefore 5
shares 5
the 5
responsibility 5
for 5
the 5
breakdown 5
of 5
political 5
morality 5
and 5
the 5
growth 5
of 5
that 5
spirit 5
of 5
revenge 5
which 5
feeds 5
on 5
despair 5
this 5
spirit 5
will 5
not 5
stop 5
short 5
of 5
the 5
gates 5
of 5
americai 5

almost 5
said 5

not 5
stopped 5
short 5
look 5
around 5
and 5
look 5
forward 5
the 5
truth 5
can 5
be 5
briefly 5
stated 5
the 5
disarmament 5
conference 5
comes 5
as 5
a 5
final 5
chance 5
to 5
you 5
no 5
less 5
than 5
to 5
us 5
of 5
preserving 5
the 5
best 5
that 5
civilized 5
humanity 5
has 5
produced 5
and 5
it 5
is 5
on 5
you 5
as 5
the 5
strongest 5
and 5
comparatively 5
soundest 5
among 5
us 5

all 5
are 5

myself 5
lucky 5
in 5
witnessing 5
the 5
great 5
peace 5
demonstration 5
organized 5
by 5
the 5
flemish 5
people 5
to 5
all 5
concerned 5
in 5
it 5
i 5
feel 5
impelled 5
to 5
call 5
out 5
in 5
the 5
name 5
of 5
men 5

feel 5
ourselves 5
united 5
with 5
you 5
by 5
the 5
deepest 5
ties 5
we 5
must 5
not 5
conceal 5
from 5
ourselves 5
that 5
an 5
improvement 5
in 5
the 5
present 5

situation 5
is 5
impossible 5
without 5
a 5
severe 5
struggle 5

the 5
handful 5
of 5
those 5
who 5
are 5
really 5

minute 5
in 5
comparison 5
with 5
the 5
mass 5
of 5
the 5
lukewarm 5
and 5
the 5

those 5
who 5
have 5

keeping 5
the 5

are 5
a 5
very 5
powerful 5
body 5
they 5
will 5
stop 5
at 5
nothing 5
to 5
make 5
public 5
opinion 5
subservient 5
to 5
their 5
murderous 5
ends 5
it 5
looks 5
as 5
if 5
the 5
ruling 5
statesmen 5
of 5
today 5
were 5
really 5
trying 5
to 5
secure 5
permanent 5
peace 5
but 5
the 5
ceaseless 5
pilingup 5
of 5
armaments 5
shows 5
only 5
too 5
clearly 5
that 5
they 5
are 5
unequal 5
to 5
coping 5
with 5
the 5
hostile 5
forces 5
which 5
are 5
preparing 5
for 5
war 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
deliverance 5
can 5
only 5
come 5
from 5
the 5
peoples 5
themselves 5
if 5
they 5
wish 5
to 5
avoid 5
the 5
degrading 5
slavery 5
of 5
warservice 5
they 5
must 5
declare 5
with 5
no 5
uncertain 5
voice 5
for 5
complete 5
disarmament 5
as 5
long 5
as 5
armies 5
exist 5
any 5
serious 5
quarrel 5
will 5
lead 5
to 5
war 5
a 5
pacifism 5
which 5
does 5
not 5
actually 5
try 5
to 5
prevent 5
the 5
nations 5
from 5
arming 5
is 5
and 5
must 5
remain 5
impotent 5
may 5
the 5
conscience 5
and 5
the 5
common 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
peoples 5
be 5
awakened 5
so 5
that 5
we 5
may 5
reach 5
a 5
new 5
stage 5
in 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
nations 5
where 5
people 5
will 5
look 5
back 5
on 5
war 5
as 5
an 5
incomprehensible 5
aberration 5
of 5
their 5

letter 5
to 5
a 5
friend 5
of 5
peace 5
it 5
has 5
come 5
to 5
my 5
ears 5
that 5
in 5
your 5
greatheartedness 5
you 5
are 5
quietly 5
accomplishing 5
a 5
splendid 5
work 5
impelled 5
by 5
solicitude 5
for 5
humanity 5
and 5
its 5
fate 5
small 5
is 5
the 5
number 5
of 5
them 5
that 5
see 5
with 5
their 5
own 5
eyes 5
and 5
feel 5
with 5
their 5
own 5
hearts 5
but 5
it 5
is 5
their 5
strength 5
that 5
will 5
decide 5
whether 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
must 5
relapse 5
into 5
that 5
hopeless 5
condition 5
which 5
a 5
blind 5
multitude 5
appears 5
today 5
to 5
regard 5
as 5
the 5
ideal 5
o 5
that 5
the 5
nations 5
might 5
see 5
before 5
it 5
is 5
too 5
late 5
how 5
much 5
of 5
their 5
selfdetermination 5
they 5
have 5
got 5
to 5
sacrifice 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
avoid 5
the 5
struggle 5
of 5
all 5
against 5
all 5
the 5
power 5
of 5
conscience 5
and 5
the 5
international 5
spirit 5
has 5
proved 5
itself 5
inadequate 5
at 5
present 5
it 5
is 5
being 5
so 5
weak 5
as 5
to 5
tolerate 5
parleying 5
with 5
the 5
worst 5
enemies 5
of 5
civilization 5
there 5
is 5
a 5
kind 5
of 5
conciliation 5
which 5
is 5
a 5
crime 5
against 5
humanity 5
and 5
it 5
passes 5
for 5
political 5
wisdom 5
we 5
cannot 5
despair 5
of 5
humanity 5
since 5
we 5
are 5
ourselves 5
human 5
beings 5
and 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
comfort 5
that 5
there 5
still 5
exist 5
individuals 5
like 5
yourself 5
whom 5
one 5
knows 5
to 5
be 5
alive 5
and 5
undismayed 5
another 5
ditto 5
dear 5
friend 5
and 5
spiritual 5
brother 5
to 5
be 5
quite 5
frank 5
a 5
declaration 5
like 5
the 5
one 5
before 5
me 5
in 5
a 5
country 5
which 5
submits 5
to 5
conscription 5
in 5
peacetime 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
valueless 5
what 5
you 5
must 5
fight 5
for 5
is 5
liberation 5
from 5
universal 5
military 5
service 5
verily 5
the 5
french 5
nation 5
has 5
had 5
to 5
pay 5
heavily 5
for 5
the 5
victory 5
of 5
for 5
that 5
victory 5
has 5
been 5
largely 5
responsible 5
for 5
holding 5
it 5
down 5
in 5
the 5
most 5
degrading 5
of 5
all 5
forms 5
of 5
slavery 5
let 5
your 5
efforts 5
in 5
this 5
struggle 5
be 5
unceasing 5
you 5
have 5
a 5
mighty 5
ally 5
in 5
the 5
german 5
reactionaries 5
and 5
militarists 5
if 5
france 5
clings 5
to 5
universal 5
military 5
service 5
it 5
will 5
be 5
impossible 5
in 5
the 5
long 5
run 5
to 5
prevent 5
its 5
introduction 5
into 5
germany 5
for 5
the 5
demand 5
of 5
the 5
germans 5
for 5
equal 5
rights 5
will 5
succeed 5
in 5
the 5
end 5
and 5
then 5
there 5
will 5
be 5
two 5
german 5
military 5
slaves 5
to 5
every 5
french 5
one 5
which 5
would 5
certainly 5
not 5
be 5
in 5
the 5
interests 5
of 5
france 5
only 5
if 5
we 5
succeed 5
in 5
abolishing 5
compulsory 5
service 5
altogether 5
will 5
it 5
be 5
possible 5
to 5
educate 5
the 5
youth 5
in 5
the 5
spirit 5
of 5
reconciliation 5
joy 5
in 5
life 5
and 5
love 5
towards 5
all 5
living 5
creatures 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
a 5
refusal 5
on 5
conscientious 5
grounds 5
to 5
serve 5
in 5
the 5
army 5
when 5
called 5
up 5
if 5
carried 5
out 5
by 5
men 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
moment 5
would 5
be 5
irresistible 5
the 5
individual 5
can 5
accomplish 5
little 5
here 5
nor 5
can 5
one 5
wish 5
to 5
see 5
the 5
best 5
among 5
us 5
devoted 5
to 5
destruction 5
through 5
the 5
machinery 5
behind 5
which 5
stand 5
the 5
three 5
great 5
powers 5
of 5
stupidity 5
fear 5
and 5
greed 5
a 5
third 5
ditto 5
dear 5
sir 5
the 5
point 5
with 5
which 5
you 5
deal 5
in 5
your 5
letter 5
is 5
one 5
of 5
prime 5
importance 5
the 5
armament 5
industry 5
is 5
as 5
you 5
say 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
greatest 5
dangers 5
that 5
beset 5
mankind 5
it 5
is 5
the 5
hidden 5
evil 5
power 5
behind 5
the 5
nationalism 5
which 5
is 5
rampant 5
everywherehellip 5
possibly 5
something 5
might 5
be 5
gained 5
by 5
nationalization 5
but 5
it 5
is 5
extremely 5
hard 5
to 5
determine 5
exactly 5
what 5
industries 5
should 5
be 5
included 5
should 5
the 5
aircraft 5
industry 5
and 5
how 5
much 5
of 5
the 5
metal 5
industry 5
and 5
the 5
chemical 5
industry 5
as 5
regards 5
the 5
munitions 5
industry 5
and 5
the 5
export 5
of 5
war 5
material 5
the 5
league 5
of 5
nations 5
has 5
busied 5
itself 5
for 5
years 5
with 5
efforts 5
to 5
get 5
this 5
horrible 5
traffic 5
controlledwith 5
what 5
little 5
success 5
we 5
all 5
know 5
last 5
year 5
i 5
asked 5
a 5
wellknown 5
american 5
diplomat 5
why 5
japan 5
was 5
not 5
forced 5
by 5
a 5
commercial 5
boycott 5
to 5
desist 5
from 5
her 5
policy 5
of 5
force 5
our 5
commercial 5
interests 5
are 5
too 5
strong 5
was 5
the 5
answer 5
how 5
can 5
one 5
help 5
people 5
who 5
rest 5
satisfied 5
with 5
a 5
statement 5
like 5
that 5
you 5
believe 5
that 5
a 5
word 5
from 5
me 5
would 5
suffice 5
to 5
get 5
something 5
done 5
in 5
this 5
sphere 5
what 5
an 5
illusion 5
people 5
flatter 5
me 5
as 5
long 5
as 5
i 5
do 5
not 5
get 5
in 5
their 5
way 5
but 5
if 5
i 5
direct 5
my 5
efforts 5
towards 5
objects 5
which 5
do 5
not 5
suit 5
them 5
they 5
immediately 5
turn 5
to 5
abuse 5
and 5
calumny 5
in 5
defence 5
of 5
their 5
interests 5
and 5
the 5
onlookers 5
mostly 5
keep 5
out 5
of 5
the 5
light 5
the 5
cowards 5
have 5
you 5
ever 5
tested 5
the 5
civil 5
courage 5
of 5
your 5
countrymen 5
the 5
silently 5
accepted 5
motto 5
is 5
leave 5
it 5
alone 5
and 5
dont 5
speak 5
of 5
it 5
you 5
may 5
be 5
sure 5
that 5
i 5
shall 5
do 5
everything 5
in 5
my 5
power 5
along 5
the 5
lines 5
you 5
indicate 5
but 5
nothing 5
can 5
be 5
achieved 5
as 5
directly 5
as 5
you 5
think 5
women 5
and 5
war 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
the 5
patriotic 5
women 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
sent 5
to 5
the 5
front 5
in 5
the 5
next 5
war 5
instead 5
of 5
the 5
men 5
it 5
would 5
at 5
least 5
be 5
a 5
novelty 5
in 5
this 5
dreary 5
sphere 5
of 5
infinite 5
confusion 5
and 5
besideswhy 5
should 5
not 5
such 5
heroic 5
feelings 5
on 5
the 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
fair 5
sex 5
find 5
a 5
more 5
picturesque 5
outlet 5
than 5
in 5
attacks 5
on 5
a 5

on 5

there 5
is 5
one 5

that 5
can 5
give 5
a 5
layman 5
in 5
the 5
sphere 5
of 5
economics 5
the 5
courage 5

the 5
alarming 5
economic 5
difficulties 5
of 5

is 5
the 5
hopeless 5
confusion 5

opinions 5
among 5
the 5
experts 5
what 5
i 5
have 5
to 5

nothing 5

does 5
not 5
pretend 5
to 5
be 5
anything 5
more 5
than 5
the 5
opinion 5

an 5

man 5

unburdened 5
by 5
class 5

nothing 5
but 5
the 5

the 5
most 5
harmonious 5
possible 5
scheme 5
of 5
human 5
existence 5
if 5
in 5
what 5
follows 5
i 5
write 5
as 5
if 5
i 5
were 5
clear 5
about 5
certain 5
things 5
and 5
sure 5
of 5
the 5
truth 5
of 5
what 5
i 5
am 5
saying 5
this 5
is 5
done 5
merely 5
for 5
the 5
sake 5
of 5
an 5
easier 5
mode 5
of 5
expression 5
it 5
does 5
not 5
proceed 5
from 5
unwarranted 5
selfconfidence 5
or 5
a 5
belief 5
in 5
the 5
infallibility 5
of 5
my 5
somewhat 5
simple 5
intellectual 5
conception 5
of 5
problems 5
which 5
are 5
in 5
reality 5
uncommonly 5
complex 5
as 5
i 5
see 5
it 5
this 5
crisis 5
differs 5
in 5
character 5
from 5
past 5
crises 5
in 5
that 5
it 5
is 5
based 5
on 5
an 5
entirely 5
new 5
set 5
of 5
conditions 5
due 5
to 5
rapid 5
progress 5
in 5
methods 5
of 5

only 5
a 5
fraction 5
of 5
the 5

necessary 5
to 5
life 5
under 5
a 5
completely 5
free 5
economic 5
system 5
this 5
fact 5
is 5
bound 5
to 5
lead 5
to 5
unemployment 5
for 5
reasons 5
which 5
i 5
do 5
not 5
propose 5
to 5
analyse 5
here 5
the 5
majority 5
of 5
people 5
are 5
compelled 5
to 5
work 5
for 5
the 5
minimum 5
wage 5
on 5
which 5
life 5
can 5
be 5

two 5

produce 5
the 5

sort 5
of 5
goods 5
other 5
things 5
being 5

one 5
will 5

today 5
only 5
a 5
portion 5

unreasonable 5
demands 5
are 5
made 5
on 5
this 5
portion 5
the 5
remainder 5
is 5
automatically 5
excluded 5
from 5
the 5
process 5
of 5
production 5
this 5
leads 5
to 5
a 5
fall 5
in 5
sales 5

profits 5

go 5
smash 5

complete 5
standstill 5
the 5
crisis 5
has 5
also 5
been 5
attributed 5
to 5
other 5
causes 5
which 5
we 5
will 5
now 5
consider 5
overproduction 5
we 5
have 5
to 5
distinguish 5
between 5
two 5
things 5
herereal 5
overproduction 5
and 5
apparent 5
overproduction 5
by 5
real 5
overproduction 5
i 5
mean 5
a 5
production 5
so 5
great 5
that 5
it 5
exceeds 5
the 5
demand 5
this 5
my 5
perhaps 5
apply 5
to 5
motorcars 5
and 5
wheat 5
in 5
the 5
united 5
states 5
at 5
the 5
present 5
moment 5
although 5
even 5
that 5
is 5
doubtful 5
by 5
overproduction 5
people 5
usually 5
mean 5
a 5
condition 5
of 5
things 5
in 5
which 5
more 5
of 5
one 5
particular 5
article 5
is 5
produced 5
than 5
can 5
in 5
existing 5
circumstances 5
be 5
sold 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
a 5
shortage 5
of 5
consumptiongoods 5
among 5
consumers 5
this 5
condition 5
of 5
things 5
i 5
call 5
apparent 5
overproduction 5
in 5
this 5
case 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
the 5
demand 5
that 5
is 5
lacking 5
but 5
the 5
consumers 5
purchasingpower 5
such 5
apparent 5
overproduction 5
is 5
only 5
another 5
word 5
for 5
a 5
crisis 5
and 5
therefore 5
cannot 5
serve 5
as 5
an 5
explanation 5
of 5
the 5
latter 5
hence 5
people 5
who 5
try 5
to 5
make 5
overproduction 5
responsible 5
for 5
the 5
crisis 5
are 5
merely 5
juggling 5
with 5
words 5
reparations 5
the 5
obligation 5
to 5
pay 5
reparations 5
lies 5
heavy 5
on 5
the 5
debtor 5
nations 5
and 5
their 5
industries 5
compels 5
them 5
to 5
go 5
in 5
for 5
dumping 5
and 5
so 5
harms 5
the 5
creditor 5
nations 5
too 5
this 5
is 5
beyond 5
dispute 5
but 5
the 5
appearance 5
of 5
the 5
crisis 5
in 5
the 5
united 5
states 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
the 5
high 5
tariffwall 5
protecting 5
them 5
proves 5
that 5
this 5
cannot 5
be 5
the 5
principal 5
cause 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
crisis 5
the 5
shortage 5
of 5
gold 5
in 5
the 5
debtor 5
countries 5
due 5
to 5
reparations 5
can 5
at 5
most 5
serve 5
as 5
an 5
argument 5
for 5
putting 5
an 5
end 5
to 5
these 5
payments 5
it 5
cannot 5
be 5
dragged 5
in 5
as 5
an 5
explanation 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
crisis 5
erection 5
of 5
near 5
tariffwalls 5
increase 5
in 5
the 5
unproductive 5
burden 5
of 5
armaments 5
political 5
in 5
security 5
owing 5
to 5
latent 5
danger 5
of 5
war 5
all 5
these 5
things 5
add 5
considerably 5
to 5
the 5
troubles 5
of 5
europe 5
but 5
do 5
not 5
materially 5
affect 5
america 5
the 5
appearance 5
of 5
the 5
crisis 5
in 5
america 5
shows 5
that 5
they 5
cannot 5
be 5
its 5
principal 5
causes 5
the 5
droppingout 5
of 5
the 5
two 5
powers 5
china 5
and 5
russia 5
this 5
blow 5
to 5
world 5
trade 5
also 5
does 5
not 5
touch 5
america 5
very 5
nearly 5
and 5
therefore 5
cannot 5
be 5
a 5
principal 5
cause 5
of 5
the 5
crisis 5
the 5
economic 5
rise 5
of 5
the 5
lower 5
classes 5
since 5
the 5
war 5
this 5
supposing 5
it 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
reality 5
could 5
only 5
produce 5
a 5
scarcity 5
of 5
goods 5
not 5
an 5
excessive 5
supply 5
i 5
will 5
not 5
weary 5
the 5
reader 5
by 5
enumerating 5
further 5
contentions 5
which 5
do 5
not 5
seem 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
get 5
to 5
the 5
heart 5
of 5
the 5
matter 5
of 5
one 5
thing 5
i 5
feel 5
certain 5
this 5
same 5
technical 5
progress 5
which 5
in 5
itself 5
might 5
relieve 5
mankind 5
of 5
a 5
great 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
labour 5
necessary 5
to 5
its 5
subsistence 5
is 5
the 5
main 5
cause 5
of 5
our 5
present 5
troubles 5
hence 5
there 5
are 5
those 5
who 5
would 5
in 5
all 5
seriousness 5
forbid 5
the 5
introduction 5
of 5
technical 5
improvements 5
this 5
is 5
obviously 5
absurd 5
but 5
how 5
can 5
we 5
find 5
a 5
more 5
rational 5
way 5
out 5
of 5
our 5
dilemma 5
if 5
we 5
could 5
somehow 5
manage 5
to 5
prevent 5
the 5
purchasingpower 5
of 5
the 5
masses 5
measured 5
in 5
terms 5
of 5
goods 5
from 5
sinking 5
below 5
a 5
certain 5
minimum 5
stoppages 5
in 5
the 5
industrial 5
cycle 5
such 5
as 5
we 5
are 5
experiencing 5
today 5
would 5
be 5
rendered 5
impossible 5
the 5
logically 5
simplest 5
but 5
also 5
most 5
daring 5
method 5
of 5
achieving 5
this 5
is 5
a 5
completely 5
planned 5
economy 5
in 5
which 5
consumptiongoods 5
are 5
produced 5
and 5
distributed 5
by 5
the 5
community 5
that 5
in 5
essentials 5
is 5
what 5
is 5
being 5
attempted 5
in 5
russia 5
today 5
much 5
will 5
depend 5
on 5
what 5
results 5
this 5
mighty 5
experiment 5
produces 5
to 5
hazard 5
a 5
prophecy 5
here 5
would 5
be 5
presumption 5
can 5
goods 5
be 5
produced 5
as 5
economically 5
under 5
such 5
a 5
system 5
as 5
under 5
one 5
which 5
leaves 5
more 5
freedom 5
to 5
individual 5
enterprise 5
can 5
this 5
system 5
maintain 5
itself 5
at 5
all 5
without 5
the 5
terror 5
that 5
has 5
so 5
far 5
accompanied 5
it 5
which 5
none 5
of 5
us 5
westerners 5
would 5
care 5
to 5
let 5
himself 5
in 5
for 5
does 5
not 5
such 5
a 5
rigid 5
centralized 5
system 5
tend 5
towards 5
protection 5
and 5
hostility 5
to 5
advantageous 5
innovations 5
we 5
must 5
take 5
care 5
however 5
not 5
to 5
allow 5
these 5
suspicions 5
to 5
become 5
prejudices 5
which 5
prevent 5
us 5
from 5
forming 5
an 5
objective 5
judgment 5
my 5
personal 5
opinion 5
is 5
that 5
those 5
methods 5
are 5
preferable 5
which 5
respect 5
existing 5
traditions 5
and 5
habits 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
that 5
is 5
in 5
any 5
way 5
compatible 5
with 5
the 5
end 5
in 5
view 5
nor 5
do 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
a 5
sudden 5
transference 5
of 5
the 5
control 5
of 5
industry 5
to 5
the 5
hands 5
of 5
the 5
public 5
would 5
be 5
beneficial 5
from 5
the 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
of 5
production 5
private 5
enterprise 5
should 5
be 5
left 5
its 5
sphere 5
of 5
activity 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
it 5
has 5
not 5
already 5
been 5
eliminated 5
by 5
industry 5
itself 5
in 5
the 5
form 5
of 5
cartelization 5
there 5
are 5
however 5
two 5
respects 5
in 5
which 5
this 5
economic 5
freedom 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
limited 5
in 5
each 5
branch 5
of 5
industry 5
the 5
number 5
of 5
working 5
hours 5
per 5
week 5
ought 5
so 5
to 5
be 5
reduced 5
by 5
law 5
that 5
unemployment 5
is 5
systematically 5
abolished 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
minimum 5
wages 5
must 5
be 5
fixed 5
in 5
such 5
a 5
way 5
that 5
the 5
purchasing 5
power 5
of 5
the 5
workers 5
keeps 5
pace 5
with 5
production 5
further 5
in 5
those 5
industries 5
which 5
have 5
become 5
monopolistic 5
in 5
character 5
through 5
organization 5
on 5
the 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
producers 5
prices 5
must 5
be 5
controlled 5
by 5
the 5
state 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
keep 5
the 5
creation 5
of 5
new 5
capital 5
within 5
reasonable 5
bounds 5
and 5
prevent 5
the 5
artificial 5
strangling 5
of 5
production 5
and 5
consumption 5
in 5
this 5
way 5
it 5
might 5
perhaps 5
be 5
possible 5
to 5
establish 5
a 5
proper 5
balance 5
between 5
production 5
and 5
consumption 5
without 5
too 5
great 5
a 5
limitation 5
of 5
free 5
enterprise 5
and 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
to 5
stop 5
the 5
intolerable 5
tyranny 5
of 5
the 5
owners 5
of 5
the 5
means 5
of 5
production 5
land 5
machinery 5
over 5
the 5
wageearners 5
in 5
the 5
widest 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
term 5
culture 5
and 5
prosperity 5
if 5
one 5
would 5
estimate 5
the 5
damage 5
done 5
by 5
the 5
great 5
political 5
catastrophe 5
to 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
human 5
civilization 5
one 5
must 5
remember 5
that 5
culture 5
in 5
its 5
higher 5
forms 5
is 5
a 5
delicate 5
plant 5
which 5
depends 5
on 5
a 5
complicated 5
set 5
of 5
conditions 5
and 5
is 5
wont 5
to 5
flourish 5
only 5
in 5
a 5
few 5
places 5
at 5
any 5
given 5
time 5
for 5
it 5
to 5
blossom 5
there 5
is 5
needed 5
first 5
of 5
all 5
a 5
certain 5
degree 5
of 5
prosperity 5
which 5
enables 5
a 5
fraction 5
of 5
the 5
population 5
to 5
work 5
at 5
things 5
not 5
directly 5
necessary 5

the 5

of 5

of 5
respect 5

one 5

both 5

this 5
basis 5
the 5
german 5
nation 5
has 5
brought 5
forth 5
fruits 5
of 5

form 5

gone 5
the 5

off 5
almost 5
completely 5
from 5
the 5

the 5

with 5
it 5
the 5

depends 5
on 5
it 5
will 5
inevitably 5
collapse 5
also 5
and 5
a 5
fruitful 5
nursery 5
of 5
culture 5
turn 5
to 5
wilderness 5
the 5
human 5
race 5

so 5
far 5
as 5
it 5
sets 5

has 5
an 5
interest 5
in 5
preventing 5
such 5
impoverishment 5

will 5
give 5
what 5
help 5
it 5
can 5
in 5
the 5
immediate 5
crisis 5
and 5
reawaken 5
that 5
higher 5
community 5
of 5
feeling 5
now 5
thrust 5
into 5
the 5
background 5
by 5
national 5
egotism 5
for 5
which 5
human 5
values 5
have 5
a 5
validity 5
independent 5
of 5
politics 5
and 5
frontiers 5
it 5

then 5
procure 5
for 5
every 5
nation 5
conditions 5
of 5
work 5
under 5
which 5
it 5
can 5
exist 5
and 5
under 5
which 5
it 5
can 5
bring 5
forth 5
fruits 5
of 5
culture 5
production 5
and 5
purchasing 5
power 5
i 5
do 5
not 5
believe 5
that 5
the 5
remedy 5
for 5
our 5
present 5
difficulties 5
lies 5
in 5
a 5
knowledge 5
of 5
productive 5
capacity 5
and 5
consumption 5
because 5
this 5
knowledge 5
is 5
likely 5
in 5
the 5
main 5
to 5
come 5
too 5
late 5
moreover 5
the 5
trouble 5
in 5
germany 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
be 5
not 5
hypertrophy 5
of 5
the 5
machinery 5
of 5
production 5
but 5
deficient 5
purchasing 5
power 5
in 5
a 5
large 5
section 5
of 5
the 5
population 5
which 5
has 5
been 5
cast 5
out 5
of 5
the 5
productive 5
process 5
through 5
rationalization 5
the 5
gold 5
standard 5
has 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
the 5
serious 5
disadvantage 5
that 5
a 5
shortage 5
in 5
the 5
supply 5
of 5
gold 5
automatically 5
leads 5
to 5
a 5
contraction 5
of 5
credit 5
and 5
also 5
of 5
the 5
amount 5
of 5
currency 5
in 5
circulation 5
to 5
which 5
contraction 5
prices 5
and 5
wages 5
cannot 5
adjust 5
themselves 5
sufficiently 5
quickly 5
the 5
natural 5
remedies 5
for 5
our 5
troubles 5
are 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
as 5

dear 5
herr 5
cederstrm 5
thank 5
you 5
for 5
sending 5
me 5
your 5
proposals 5
which 5
interest 5
me 5
very 5
much 5
having 5
myself 5
given 5
so 5
much 5
thought 5
to 5
this 5
subject 5
i 5
feel 5
that 5
it 5
is 5
right 5
that 5
i 5
should 5
give 5
you 5
my 5
perfectly 5
frank 5
opinion 5
on 5
them 5
the 5
fundamental 5
trouble 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
be 5
the 5
almost 5
unlimited 5
freedom 5
of 5
the 5
labour 5
market 5
combined 5
with 5
extraordinary 5
progress 5
in 5
the 5
methods 5
of 5
production 5
to 5
satisfy 5
the 5
needs 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
today 5
nothing 5
like 5
all 5
the 5
available 5
labour 5
is 5
wanted 5
the 5
result 5
is 5
unemployment 5
and 5
excessive 5
competition 5
among 5
the 5
workers 5
both 5
of 5
which 5
reduce 5
purchasing 5
power 5
and 5
put 5
the 5
whole 5
economic 5
system 5
intolerably 5
out 5
of 5
gear 5
i 5
know 5
liberal 5
economists 5
maintain 5
that 5
every 5
economy 5
in 5
labour 5
is 5
counterbalanced 5
by 5
an 5
increase 5
in 5
demand 5
but 5
to 5
begin 5
with 5
i 5
dont 5
believe 5
it 5
and 5
even 5
if 5
it 5
were 5
true 5
the 5
abovementioned 5
factors 5
would 5
always 5
operate 5
to 5
force 5
the 5
standard 5
of 5
living 5
of 5
a 5
large 5
portion 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
doom 5
to 5
an 5
unnaturally 5
low 5
level 5
i 5
also 5
share 5
your 5
conviction 5
that 5
steps 5
absolutely 5
must 5
be 5
taken 5
to 5
make 5
it 5
possible 5
and 5
necessary 5
for 5
the 5
younger 5
people 5
to 5
take 5
part 5
in 5
the 5
productive 5
process 5
further 5
that 5
the 5
older 5
people 5
ought 5
to 5
be 5
excluded 5
from 5
certain 5
sorts 5
of 5
work 5
which 5
i 5
call 5
unqualified 5
work 5
receiving 5
instead 5
a 5
certain 5
income 5
as 5
having 5
by 5

done 5
enough 5
work 5
of 5
a 5
kind 5
accepted 5
by 5
society 5
as 5
productive 5
i 5
too 5
am 5
in 5
favour 5
of 5
abolishing 5

the 5
idea 5
strikes 5
me 5
as 5
horrible 5
i 5
am 5
also 5
of 5
opinion 5
that 5
fluctuations 5
in 5
the 5
value 5
of 5
money 5
must 5
be 5
avoided 5
by 5
substituting 5
for 5

standard 5
a 5
standard 5
based 5
on 5

keynes 5
if 5
i 5
am 5
not 5
mistaken 5
long 5
ago 5
proposed 5
with 5
the 5
introduction 5
of 5
this 5
system 5
one 5
might 5
consent 5
to 5
a 5
certain 5
amount 5
of 5
inflation 5
as 5
compared 5
with 5
the 5
present 5
monetary 5
situation 5
if 5
one 5
could 5
believe 5
that 5
the 5
state 5
would 5
really 5
make 5
a 5
rational 5
use 5
of 5
the 5
windfall 5

accruing 5
to 5

the 5
weaknesses 5
of 5
your 5
plan 5

so 5
it 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
in 5
the 5
sphere 5
of 5
psychology 5
or 5
rather 5
in 5
your 5
neglect 5
of 5
it 5
it 5
is 5
no 5
accident 5
that 5
capitalism 5
has 5
brought 5
with 5
it 5
progress 5
not 5
merely 5
in 5
production 5
but 5
also 5
in 5
knowledge 5
egoism 5
and 5
competition 5
are 5
alas 5
stronger 5
forces 5
than 5
public 5
spirit 5
and 5
sense 5
of 5
duty 5
in 5
russia 5
they 5
say 5
it 5
is 5
impossible 5
to 5
get 5
a 5
decent 5
piece 5
of 5

i 5
am 5
overpessimistic 5
concerning 5
state 5
and 5
other 5
forms 5
of 5
communal 5
enterprise 5
but 5
i 5
expect 5
little 5
good 5
from 5
them 5
bureaucracy 5
is 5
the 5
death 5
of 5
all 5
sound 5
work 5
i 5
have 5
seen 5
and 5
experienced 5
too 5
many 5
dreadful 5
warnings 5
even 5
in 5
comparatively 5
model 5
switzerland 5
i 5
am 5
inclined 5
to 5
the 5
view 5
that 5
the 5
state 5
can 5
only 5
be 5
of 5
real 5
use 5
to 5
industry 5
as 5
a 5
limiting 5
and 5
regulative 5
force 5
it 5
must 5
see 5
to 5
it 5
that 5
competition 5
among 5
the 5
workers 5
is 5
kept 5
within 5
healthy 5
limits 5
that 5
all 5
children 5
are 5
given 5
a 5
chance 5
to 5
develop 5
soundly 5
and 5
that 5
wages 5
are 5
high 5
enough 5
for 5
the 5
goods 5
produced 5
to 5
be 5
consumed 5
but 5
it 5
can 5
exert 5
a 5
decisive 5
influence 5

like 5

cannot 5
find 5
the 5
time 5

it 5
seems 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
universal 5
fact 5
that 5
minoritiesespecially 5
when 5
the 5
individuals 5
composing 5

distinguished 5

among 5

they 5
live 5
as 5

inferior 5
order 5
of 5

the 5
tragedy 5
of 5
such 5
a 5
fate 5
lies 5
not 5
merely 5
in 5
the 5
unfair 5
treatment 5
to 5

these 5
minorities 5
are 5
automatically 5
subjected 5
in 5
social 5

economic 5
matters 5

also 5
in 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
under 5
the 5
suggestive 5

of 5
the 5

most 5
of 5

prejudice 5
and 5
regard 5
their 5
brethren 5
as 5
inferior 5

this 5
second 5
and 5
greater 5
part 5
of 5
the 5
evil 5
can 5
be 5
overcome 5
by 5
closer 5
combination 5
and 5
by 5
deliberate 5
education 5
of 5
the 5
minority 5
whose 5
spiritual 5
liberation 5
can 5
thus 5
be 5
accomplished 5
the 5
efforts 5
of 5
the 5
american 5
negroes 5
in 5
this 5
direction 5
are 5
deserving 5
of 5
all 5
commendation 5
and 5
assistance 5
observations 5
on 5
the 5
present 5
situation 5
in 5
europe 5
the 5
distinguishing 5
feature 5
of 5
the 5
present 5
political 5
situation 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
and 5
in 5
particular 5
of 5
europe 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
be 5
this 5
that 5
political 5
development 5
has 5
failed 5
both 5
materially 5
and 5
intellectually 5
to 5
keep 5
pace 5
with 5
economic 5
necessity 5
which 5
has 5
changed 5
its 5
character 5
in 5
a 5
comparatively 5
short 5
time 5
the 5
interests 5
of 5
each 5
country 5
must 5
be 5
subordinated 5
to 5
the 5
interests 5
of 5
the 5
wider 5
community 5
the 5
struggle 5
for 5
this 5
new 5
orientation 5
of 5
political 5
thought 5
and 5
feeling 5
is 5
a 5
severe 5
one 5
because 5
it 5
has 5
the 5
tradition 5
of 5
centuries 5
against 5
it 5
but 5
the 5
survival 5
of 5
europe 5
depends 5
on 5
its 5
successful 5
issue 5
it 5
is 5
my 5
firm 5
conviction 5
that 5
once 5
the 5
psychological 5
impediments 5
are 5
overcome 5
the 5
solution 5
of 5
the 5
real 5
problems 5
will 5
not 5
be 5
such 5
a 5
terribly 5
difficult 5
matter 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
create 5
the 5
right 5
atmosphere 5
the 5
most 5
essential 5
thing 5
is 5
personal 5
cooperation 5
between 5
men 5
of 5
like 5
mind 5
may 5
our 5
united 5
efforts 5
succeed 5
in 5
building 5
a 5
bridge 5
of 5
mutual 5
trust 5
between 5
the 5
nations 5
the 5
heirs 5
of 5
the 5
ages 5
previous 5
generations 5
were 5
able 5
to 5
look 5
upon 5
intellectual 5
and 5
cultural 5
progress 5
as 5
simply 5
the 5
inherited 5
fruits 5
of 5
their 5
forebears 5
labours 5
which 5
made 5
life 5
easier 5
and 5
more 5
beautiful 5
for 5
them 5
but 5
the 5
calamities 5
of 5
our 5
times 5
show 5
us 5
that 5
this 5
was 5
a 5
fatal 5
illusion 5
we 5
see 5
now 5
that 5
the 5
greatest 5
efforts 5
are 5
needed 5
if 5
this 5
legacy 5
of 5
humanitys 5
is 5
to 5
prove 5
a 5
blessing 5
and 5
not 5
a 5
curse 5
for 5
whereas 5
formerly 5
it 5
was 5
enough 5
for 5
a 5
man 5
to 5
have 5
freed 5
himself 5
to 5
some 5
extent 5
from 5
personal 5
egotism 5
to 5
make 5
him 5
a 5
valuable 5
member 5
of 5
society 5
today 5
he 5
must 5
also 5
be 5
required 5
to 5
overcome 5
national 5
and 5
class 5
egotism 5
only 5
if 5
he 5
reaches 5
those 5
heights 5
can 5
he 5
contribute 5
towards 5
improving 5
the 5
lot 5
of 5
humanity 5

this 5
most 5
important 5
need 5
of 5
the 5
age 5
the 5
inhabitants 5
of 5

better 5
placed 5
than 5
those 5

not 5
wish 5

as 5
a 5
state 5
of 5
psychic 5
distemper 5
in 5
the 5
masses 5
and 5
also 5
made 5
some 5
remarks 5
about 5
its 5
causes 5
in 5
a 5
written 5
document 5
which 5
i 5
allowed 5
the 5
international 5
league 5
for 5
combating 5
antisemitism 5
to 5
make 5
use 5
of 5
for 5
the 5
purpose 5
of 5
enlisting 5
support 5
and 5
which 5
was 5
not 5
intended 5
for 5

at 5
all 5

also 5
called 5
upon 5
all 5
sensible 5
people 5
who 5
are 5
still 5
faithful 5
to 5
the 5
ideals 5
of 5
a 5
civilization 5
in 5
peril 5
to 5
do 5
their 5
utmost 5
to 5
prevent 5
this 5
masspsychosis 5
which 5
is 5
exhibiting 5
itself 5
in 5
such 5
terrible 5
symptoms 5
in 5
germany 5
today 5
from 5
spreading 5
further 5
it 5
would 5
have 5
been 5
an 5
easy 5
matter 5
for 5
the 5
academy 5
to 5
get 5
hold 5
of 5
a 5
correct 5
version 5
of 5
my 5
words 5
before 5
issuing 5
the 5
sort 5
of 5
statement 5
about 5
me 5
that 5
it 5
has 5
the 5
german 5
press 5
has 5
reproduced 5
a 5
deliberately 5
distorted 5
version 5
of 5
my 5
words 5
as 5
indeed 5
was 5
only 5
to 5
be 5
expected 5
with 5
the 5
press 5
muzzled 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
today 5
i 5
am 5
ready 5
to 5
stand 5
by 5
every 5
word 5
i 5
have 5
published 5
in 5
return 5
i 5
expect 5
the 5
academy 5
to 5
communicate 5
this 5
statement 5
of 5
mine 5
to 5
its 5
members 5
and 5
also 5
to 5
the 5
german 5
public 5
before 5
which 5
i 5
have 5
been 5
slandered 5
especially 5
as 5
it 5
has 5
itself 5
had 5
a 5
hand 5
in 5
slandering 5
me 5
before 5
that 5
public 5
the 5
academys 5
answer 5
of 5
april 5
the 5
academy 5
would 5
like 5
to 5
point 5
out 5
that 5
its 5
statement 5
of 5
april 5
was 5
based 5
not 5
merely 5
on 5
german 5
but 5
principally 5
on 5
foreign 5
particularly 5
french 5
and 5
belgian 5
newspaper 5
reports 5
which 5
herr 5
einstein 5
has 5
not 5
contradicted 5
in 5
addition 5
it 5
had 5
before 5
it 5
his 5
muchcanvassed 5
statement 5
to 5
the 5
league 5
for 5
combating 5
antisemitism 5
in 5
which 5
he 5
deplores 5
germanys 5
relapse 5
into 5
the 5
barbarism 5
of 5
longpassed 5
ages 5
moreover 5
the 5
academy 5
has 5
reason 5
to 5
know 5
that 5
herr 5
einstein 5
who 5
according 5
to 5
his 5
own 5
statement 5
has 5
taken 5
no 5
part 5
in 5
atrocitymongering 5
has 5
at 5
least 5
done 5
nothing 5
to 5
counteract 5
unjust 5
suspicions 5
and 5
slanders 5
which 5
in 5
the 5
opinion 5
of 5
the 5
academy 5
it 5
was 5
his 5
duty 5
as 5
one 5
of 5
its 5
senior 5
members 5
to 5
do 5
instead 5
of 5
that 5
herr 5
einstein 5
has 5
made 5
statements 5
and 5
in 5
foreign 5
countries 5

that 5
such 5
as 5
coming 5

regrets 5
the 5
turn 5
events 5
have 5
taken 5
this 5
regret 5

inspired 5
by 5
the 5
thought 5
that 5
a 5
man 5
of 5
the 5
highest 5
scientific 5
authority 5
whom 5
many 5

among 5

many 5
years 5
of 5

thought 5
should 5

chosen 5
this 5
moment 5
to 5

himself 5

no 5

through 5
ignorance 5

done 5
much 5
damage 5

our 5

by 5
disseminating 5
erroneous 5
views 5

unfounded 5

we 5

one 5
who 5
had 5
belonged 5

our 5
academy 5

long 5

have 5
ranged 5
himself 5
irrespective 5
of 5
his 5

political 5
sympathies 5
on 5
the 5
side 5
of 5
the 5
defenders 5

loose 5

a 5
bitter 5

grievous 5
disappointment 5
to 5
us 5
which 5
would 5
no 5
doubt 5

have 5
received 5

regards 5
the 5
fact 5
i 5
can 5
only 5
reply 5
as 5
follows 5
what 5
you 5
say 5
about 5
my 5
behaviour 5
is 5
at 5
bottom 5
merely 5
another 5
form 5
of 5
the 5
statement 5
you 5
have 5
already 5
published 5
in 5
which 5
you 5
accuse 5
me 5
of 5
having 5
taken 5
part 5
in 5
atrocitymongering 5
against 5
the 5
german 5
nation 5
i 5
have 5
already 5
in 5
my 5
last 5
letter 5
characterized 5
this 5
accusation 5
as 5
slanderous 5
you 5
have 5
also 5
remarked 5
that 5
a 5
good 5
word 5
on 5
my 5
part 5
for 5
the 5
german 5
people 5
would 5
have 5
produced 5
a 5
great 5
effect 5
abroad 5
to 5
this 5
i 5
must 5
reply 5
that 5
such 5
a 5
testimony 5
as 5
you 5
suggest 5
would 5
have 5
been 5
equivalent 5
to 5
a 5
repudiation 5
of 5
all 5
those 5
notions 5
of 5
justice 5
and 5
liberty 5
for 5
which 5
i 5
have 5
all 5
my 5
life 5
stood 5
such 5
a 5
testimony 5
would 5
not 5
be 5
as 5
you 5
put 5
it 5
a 5
good 5
word 5
for 5
the 5
german 5
nation 5
on 5
the 5
contrary 5
it 5
would 5
only 5
have 5
helped 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
those 5
who 5
are 5
seeking 5
to 5
undermine 5
the 5
ideas 5
and 5
principles 5
which 5
have 5
won 5
for 5
the 5
german 5
nation 5
a 5
place 5
of 5
honour 5
in 5
the 5
civilized 5
world 5
by 5
giving 5
such 5
a 5
testimony 5
in 5
the 5
present 5
circumstances 5
i 5
should 5
have 5
been 5
contributing 5
even 5
if 5
only 5
indirectly 5
to 5
the 5
barbarization 5
of 5
manners 5
and 5
the 5
destruction 5
of 5
all 5
existing 5
cultural 5
values 5
it 5
was 5
for 5
this 5
reason 5
that 5
i 5
felt 5
compelled 5
to 5
resign 5
from 5
the 5
academy 5
and 5
your 5
letter 5
only 5
shows 5
me 5
how 5
right 5
i 5
was 5
to 5
do 5
so 5

given 5
the 5
present 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5

withdrawal 5
from 5
the 5
prussian 5
acadeiny 5
of 5
sciences 5
is 5
bound 5
to 5
affect 5
your 5
relations 5
with 5
our 5
academy 5
we 5
must 5
therefore 5
ask 5
you 5
how 5
you 5
envisage 5
your 5
relations 5
with 5
our 5
academy 5
after 5
what 5
has 5
passed 5
between 5
yourself 5
and 5
the 5
prussian 5

to 5
the 5
bavarian 5
academy 5
of 5
sciences 5
munich 5
i 5
have 5
given 5
it 5
as 5
the 5
reason 5
for 5
my 5
resignation 5
from 5
the 5
prussian 5
academy 5
that 5
in 5
the 5
present 5
circumstances 5
i 5
have 5
no 5
wish 5
either 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
german 5
citizen 5
or 5
to 5
remain 5
in 5
a 5
position 5
of 5
quasidependence 5
on 5
the 5
prussian 5
ministry 5
of 5
education 5
these 5
reasons 5
would 5
not 5
in 5
themselves 5
involve 5
the 5
severing 5
of 5
my 5
relations 5
with 5
the 5
bavarian 5
academy 5
if 5
i 5
nevertheless 5
desire 5
my 5
name 5
to 5
be 5
removed 5
from 5
the 5
list 5
of 5
members 5
it 5
is 5
for 5
a 5
different 5
reason 5
the 5
primary 5
duty 5
of 5
an 5
academy 5
is 5
to 5
encourage 5
and 5
protect 5
the 5
scientific 5
life 5
of 5
a 5
country 5

howeverto 5

nothing 5
while 5
a 5
not 5
inconsiderable 5
proportion 5
of 5
german 5
savants 5
and 5
students 5
and 5
also 5
of 5
professional 5
men 5
of 5

have 5

chance 5
of 5
getting 5

earning 5

in 5
germany 5
i 5
would 5
rather 5
not 5
belong 5
to 5
any 5
society 5
which 5
behaves 5
in 5
such 5
a 5
manner 5
even 5
if 5
it 5
does 5
so 5
under 5
external 5
pressure 5
a 5
reply 5
the 5
following 5
lines 5
are 5
einsteins 5
answer 5
to 5
an 5
invitation 5
to 5
associate 5
himself 5
with 5
a 5
french 5
manifesto 5
against 5
antisemitism 5
in 5
germany 5
i 5
have 5
considered 5
this 5
most 5
important 5
proposal 5
which 5
has 5
a 5
bearing 5
on 5
several 5
things 5
that 5
i 5
have 5
nearly 5
at 5
heart 5
carefully 5
from 5
every 5
angle 5
as 5
a 5
result 5
i 5
have 5
come 5
to 5
the 5
conclusion 5
that 5
i 5
cannot 5
take 5
a 5
personal 5
part 5
in 5
this 5
extremely 5
important 5
affair 5
for 5
two 5
reasons 5
in 5
the 5
first 5
place 5
i 5
am 5
after 5
all 5
still 5
a 5
german 5
citizen 5
and 5
in 5
the 5
second 5
i 5
am 5
a 5
jew 5
as 5
regards 5
the 5
first 5
point 5
i 5
must 5
add 5
that 5
i 5
have 5
worked 5
in 5
german 5
institutions 5
and 5
have 5
always 5
been 5
treated 5
with 5
full 5
confidence 5
in 5
germany 5
however 5
deeply 5
i 5
may 5
regret 5
the 5
things 5
that 5
are 5
being 5
done 5
there 5
however 5
strongly 5
i 5
am 5
bound 5
to 5
condemn 5
the 5
terrible 5
mistakes 5
that 5
are 5
being 5
made 5
with 5
the 5
approval 5
of 5
the 5
government 5
it 5
is 5
impossible 5
for 5
me 5
to 5
take 5
part 5
personally 5
in 5
an 5
enterprise 5
set 5
on 5
foot 5
by 5
responsible 5
members 5
of 5
a 5
foreign 5
government 5
in 5
order 5
that 5
you 5
may 5
appreciate 5
this 5
fully 5
suppose 5
that 5
a 5
french 5
citizen 5
in 5
a 5
more 5
or 5
less 5
analogous 5
situation 5
had 5
got 5
up 5
a 5
protest 5
against 5
the 5
french 5
governments 5
action 5
in 5
conjunction 5
with 5
prominent 5
german 5
statesmen 5
even 5
if 5
you 5
fully 5
admitted 5
that 5
the 5
protest 5
was 5
amply 5
warranted 5
by 5
the 5
facts 5
you 5
would 5
still 5
i 5
expect 5
regard 5
the 5
behaviour 5
of 5
your 5
fellowcitizen 5
as 5
an 5
act 5
of 5
treachery 5
if 5
zola 5
had 5
felt 5
it 5
necessary 5
to 5
leave 5
france 5
at 5
the 5
time 5
of 5
the 5
dreyfus 5
case 5
he 5
would 5
still 5
certainly 5
not 5
have 5
associated 5
himself 5
with 5
a 5
protest 5
by 5
german 5
official 5
personages 5
however 5
much 5
he 5
might 5
have 5
approved 5
of 5
their 5
action 5
he 5
would 5
have 5
confined 5
himself 5
toblushing 5
for 5
his 5
countrymen 5
in 5
the 5
second 5
place 5
a 5
protest 5
against 5
injustice 5
and 5
violence 5
is 5
incomparably 5
more 5
valuable 5
if 5
it 5
comes 5
entirely 5
from 5
people 5
who 5
have 5
been 5
prompted 5
to 5
it 5
purely 5
by 5
sentiments 5
of 5
humanity 5
and 5
a 5
love 5
of 5
pew 5
this 5
cannot 5
be 5
said 5
of 5
a 5
man 5
like 5
me 5
a 5
few 5
who 5
regards 5
other 5
jews 5
as 5
his 5
brothers 5
for 5
him 5
an 5
injustice 5
done 5
to 5
the 5
jews 5
is 5
the 5
same 5
as 5
an 5
injustice 5
done 5
to 5
himself 5
he 5
must 5
not 5
be 5
the 5
judge 5
in 5
his 5
own 5
case 5
but 5
wait 5
for 5
the 5
judgment 5
of 5
impartial 5
outsiders 5
these 5
are 5
my 5
reasons 5
but 5
i 5
should 5
like 5
to 5
add 5
that 5
i 5
have 5
always 5
honoured 5
and 5
admired 5
that 5
highly 5
developed 5
sense 5
of 5
justice 5
which 5
is 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
noblest 5
features 5
of 5
the 5
french 5
tradition 5
iv 5
the 5
jews 5
jewish 5
ideals 5
the 5
pursuit 5
of 5
knowledge 5
for 5
its 5
own 5
sake 5
an 5
almost 5
fanatical 5
love 5
of 5
justice 5
and 5
the 5
desire 5
for 5
personal 5
independencethese 5
are 5
the 5
features 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
tradition 5
which 5
make 5
me 5
thank 5
my 5
stars 5
that 5
i 5
belong 5
to 5
it 5
those 5
who 5
are 5
raging 5
today 5
against 5
the 5
ideals 5
of 5
reason 5
and 5
individual 5
liberty 5
and 5
are 5
trying 5
to 5
establish 5
a 5
spiritless 5
stateslavery 5
by 5
brute 5
force 5
rightly 5
see 5
in 5
us 5
their 5
irreconcilable 5
foes 5
history 5
has 5
given 5
us 5
a 5
difficult 5
row 5
to 5
hoe 5
but 5
so 5
long 5
as 5
we 5
remain 5
devoted 5
servants 5
of 5
truth 5
justice 5
and 5
liberty 5
we 5
shall 5
continue 5
not 5
merely 5
to 5
survive 5
as 5
the 5
oldest 5
of 5
living 5
peoples 5
but 5
by 5
creative 5
work 5
to 5
bring 5
forth 5
fruits 5
which 5
contribute 5
to 5
the 5
ennoblement 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
as 5
heretofore 5
is 5
there 5
a 5
jewish 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
in 5
the 5
philosophical 5
sense 5
there 5
is 5
in 5
my 5
opinion 5
no 5
specifically 5
jewish 5
outlook 5
judaism 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
be 5
concerned 5
almost 5
exclusively 5
with 5
the 5
moral 5
attitude 5
in 5
life 5
and 5
to 5
life 5
i 5
look 5
upon 5
it 5
as 5
the 5
essence 5
of 5
an 5
attitude 5
to 5
life 5
which 5
is 5
incarnate 5
in 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
rather 5
than 5
the 5
essence 5
of 5
the 5
laws 5
laid 5
down 5
in 5
the 5
thora 5
and 5
interpreted 5
in 5
the 5
talmud 5
to 5
me 5
the 5
thora 5
and 5
the 5
talmud 5
are 5
merely 5
the 5
most 5
important 5
evidence 5
for 5
the 5
manner 5
in 5
which 5
the 5
jewish 5
conception 5
of 5
life 5
held 5
sway 5
in 5
earlier 5
times 5
the 5
essence 5
of 5
that 5
conception 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
to 5
lie 5
in 5
an 5
affirmative 5
attitude 5
to 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
all 5
creation 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
the 5
individual 5
has 5
meaning 5
only 5
in 5
so 5
far 5
as 5
it 5
aids 5
in 5
making 5
the 5
life 5
of 5
every 5
living 5
thing 5
nobler 5
and 5
more 5
beautiful 5
life 5
is 5
sacredthat 5
is 5
to 5
say 5
it 5
is 5
the 5
supreme 5
value 5
to 5
which 5
all 5
other 5
values 5
are 5
subordinate 5
the 5
hallowing 5
of 5
the 5
supraindividual 5
life 5
brings 5
in 5
its 5
train 5
a 5
reverence 5
for 5
everything 5
spirituala 5
particularly 5
characteristic 5
feature 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
tradition 5
judaism 5
is 5
not 5
a 5
creed 5
the 5
jewish 5
god 5
is 5
simply 5
a 5
negation 5
of 5
superstition 5
an 5
imaginary 5
result 5
of 5
its 5
elimination 5
it 5
is 5
also 5
an 5
attempt 5
to 5
base 5
the 5
moral 5
law 5
on 5
fear 5
a 5
regrettable 5
and 5
discreditable 5
attempt 5
yet 5
it 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
that 5
the 5
strong 5
moral 5
tradition 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
nation 5
has 5
to 5
a 5
large 5
extent 5
shaken 5
itself 5
free 5
from 5
this 5
fear 5
it 5
is 5
clear 5
also 5
that 5
serving 5
god 5
was 5
equated 5
with 5
serving 5
the 5
living 5
the 5
best 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
especially 5
the 5
prophets 5
and 5
jesus 5
contended 5
tirelessly 5
for 5
this 5
judaism 5
is 5
thus 5
no 5
transcendental 5
religion 5
it 5
is 5
concerned 5
with 5
life 5
as 5
we 5
live 5
it 5
and 5
can 5
up 5
to 5
a 5
point 5
grasp 5
it 5
and 5
nothing 5
else 5
it 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
therefore 5
doubtful 5
whether 5
it 5
can 5
be 5
called 5
a 5
religion 5
in 5
the 5
accepted 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
word 5
particularly 5
as 5
no 5
faith 5
but 5
the 5
sanctification 5
of 5
life 5
in 5
a 5
suprapersonal 5
sense 5
is 5
demanded 5
of 5
the 5
jew 5
but 5
the 5
jewish 5
tradition 5
also 5
contains 5
something 5
else 5
something 5
which 5
finds 5
splendid 5
expression 5
in 5
many 5
of 5
the 5
psalmsnamely 5
a 5
sort 5
of 5
intoxicated 5
joy 5
and 5
amazement 5
at 5
the 5
beauty 5
and 5
grandeur 5
of 5
this 5
world 5
of 5
which 5
man 5
can 5
just 5
form 5
a 5
faint 5
notion 5
it 5
is 5
the 5
feeling 5
from 5
which 5
true 5
scientific 5
research 5
draws 5
its 5
spiritual 5
sustenance 5
but 5
which 5
also 5
seems 5
to 5
find 5
expression 5
in 5
the 5
song 5
of 5
birds 5
to 5
tack 5
this 5
on 5
to 5
the 5
idea 5
of 5
god 5
seems 5
mere 5
childish 5
absurdity 5
is 5
what 5
i 5
have 5
described 5
a 5
distinguishing 5
mark 5
of 5
judaism 5
is 5
it 5
to 5
be 5
found 5
anywhere 5
else 5
under 5
another 5
name 5
in 5
its 5
pure 5
form 5
nowhere 5
not 5
even 5
in 5
judaism 5
where 5
the 5
pure 5
doctrine 5
is 5
obscured 5
by 5
much 5
worship 5
of 5
the 5
letter 5
yet 5
judaism 5
seems 5
to 5
me 5
one 5
of 5
its 5
purest 5
and 5
most 5
vigorous 5
manifestations 5
this 5
applies 5
particularly 5
to 5
the 5
fundamental 5
principle 5
of 5
the 5
sanctification 5
of 5
life 5
it 5
is 5
characteristic 5
that 5
the 5
animals 5
were 5
expressly 5
included 5
in 5
the 5
command 5
to 5
keep 5
holy 5
the 5
sabbath 5
day 5
so 5
strong 5
was 5
the 5
feeling 5
that 5
the 5
ideal 5
demands 5
the 5
solidarity 5
of 5
all 5
living 5
things 5
the 5
insistence 5
on 5
the 5
solidarity 5
of 5
all 5
human 5
beings 5
finds 5
still 5
stronger 5
expression 5
apd 5
it 5
is 5
no 5
mere 5
chance 5
that 5
the 5
demands 5
of 5
socialism 5
were 5
for 5
the 5
most 5
part 5
first 5
raised 5
by 5
jews 5
how 5
strongly 5
developed 5
this 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
sanctity 5
of 5
life 5
is 5
in 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
is 5
admirably 5
illustrated 5
by 5
a 5
little 5
remark 5
which 5
walter 5
rathenau 5
once 5
made 5
to 5
me 5
in 5
conversation 5
when 5
a 5
jew 5
says 5
that 5
hes 5

the 5

more 5
simply 5
expressed 5

an 5
answer 5

questionnaire 5
it 5
is 5
important 5
that 5

induced 5

take 5
an 5
interest 5
in 5

in 5
your 5
paper 5
this 5
is 5
of 5
moment 5
not 5
merely 5
for 5
the 5

of 5
the 5

welfare 5
depends 5
on 5
their 5
sticking 5
together 5
and 5
helping 5
each 5
other 5
but 5
over 5
and 5
above 5
that 5
for 5
the 5
cultivation 5
of 5
the 5
international 5
spirit 5
which 5
is 5
in 5
danger 5
everywhere 5
today 5
from 5
a 5
narrowminded 5
nationalism 5
here 5
since 5
the 5
days 5
of 5
the 5
prophets 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
fairest 5
fields 5
of 5
activity 5
has 5
lain 5
open 5
to 5
our 5
nation 5
scattered 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
over 5
the 5
earth 5
and 5
united 5
only 5
by 5
a 5
common 5
tradition 5
addresses 5
on 5
reconstruction 5
in 5
palestine 5
i 5
ten 5
years 5
ago 5
when 5
i 5
first 5
had 5
the 5
pleasure 5
of 5
addressing 5
you 5
on 5
behalf 5
of 5
the 5
zionist 5
cause 5
almost 5
all 5
our 5
hopes 5
were 5
still 5
fixed 5
on 5
the 5
future 5
today 5
we 5
can 5
look 5
back 5
on 5
these 5
ten 5
years 5
with 5
joy 5
for 5
in 5
that 5
time 5
the 5
united 5
energies 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
have 5
accomplished 5
a 5
splendid 5
piece 5
of 5
successful 5
constructive 5
work 5
in 5
palestine 5
which 5
certainly 5
exceeds 5
anything 5
that 5
we 5
dared 5
to 5
hope 5
then 5
we 5
have 5
also 5
successfully 5
stood 5
the 5
severe 5
test 5
to 5
which 5
the 5
events 5
of 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
years 5
have 5
subjected 5
us 5
ceaseless 5
work 5
supported 5
by 5
a 5
noble 5
purpose 5
is 5
leading 5
slowly 5
but 5
surely 5
to 5
success 5
the 5
latest 5
pronouncements 5
of 5
the 5
british 5
government 5
indicate 5
a 5
return 5
to 5
a 5
juster 5
judgment 5
of 5
our 5
case 5
this 5
we 5
recognize 5
with 5
gratitude 5
but 5
we 5
must 5
never 5
forget 5
what 5
this 5
crisis 5
has 5
taught 5
usnamely 5
that 5
the 5
establishment 5
of 5
satisfactory 5
relations 5
between 5
the 5
jews 5
and 5
the 5
arabs 5
is 5
not 5
englands 5
affair 5
but 5
ours 5
wethat 5
is 5
to 5
say 5
the 5
arabs 5
and 5
ourselveshave 5
got 5
to 5
agree 5
on 5
the 5
main 5
outlines 5
of 5
an 5
advantageous 5
partnership 5
which 5
shall 5
satisfy 5
the 5
needs 5
of 5
both 5
nations 5
a 5
just 5
solution 5
of 5
this 5
problem 5
and 5
one 5
worthy 5
of 5
both 5
nations 5
is 5
an 5
end 5
no 5
less 5
important 5
and 5
no 5
less 5
worthy 5
of 5
our 5
efforts 5
than 5
the 5
promotion 5
of 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
construction 5
itself 5
remember 5
that 5
switzerland 5
represents 5
a 5
higher 5
stage 5
of 5
political 5
development 5
than 5
any 5
national 5
state 5
precisely 5
because 5
of 5
the 5
greater 5
political 5
problems 5
which 5
had 5
to 5
be 5
solved 5
before 5
a 5
stable 5
community 5
could 5
be 5
built 5
up 5
out 5
of 5
groups 5
of 5
different 5
nationality 5
much 5
remains 5
to 5
be 5
done 5
but 5
one 5
at 5
least 5
of 5
herzls 5
aims 5
has 5
already 5
been 5
realized 5
its 5
task 5
in 5
palestine 5
has 5
given 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
an 5
astonishing 5
degree 5
of 5
solidarity 5
and 5
the 5
optimism 5
without 5
which 5
no 5
organism 5
can 5
lead 5
a 5
healthy 5
life 5
anything 5
we 5
may 5
do 5
for 5
the 5
common 5
purpose 5
is 5
done 5
not 5
merely 5
for 5
our 5
brothers 5
in 5
palestine 5
but 5
for 5
the 5
wellbeing 5
and 5
honour 5
of 5
the 5
whole 5
jewish 5
people 5
ii 5
we 5
are 5
assembled 5
today 5
for 5
the 5
purpose 5
of 5
calling 5
to 5
mind 5
our 5
ageold 5
community 5
its 5
destiny 5
and 5
its 5
problems 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
community 5
of 5
moral 5
tradition 5
which 5
has 5
always 5
shown 5
its 5
strength 5
and 5
vitality 5
in 5
times 5
of 5
stress 5
in 5
all 5
ages 5
it 5
has 5
produced 5
men 5
who 5
embodied 5
the 5
conscience 5
of 5
the 5
western 5
world 5
defenders 5
of 5
human 5
dignity 5
and 5
justice 5
so 5
long 5
as 5
we 5
ourselves 5
care 5
about 5
this 5
community 5
it 5
will 5
continue 5
to 5
exist 5
to 5
the 5
benefit 5
of 5
mankind 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
it 5
possesses 5
no 5
selfcontained 5
organization 5
a 5
decade 5
or 5
two 5
ago 5
a 5
group 5
of 5
farsighted 5
men 5
among 5
whom 5
herzl 5
of 5
immortal 5
memory 5
stood 5
out 5
above 5
the 5
rest 5
came 5
to 5
the 5
conclusion 5
that 5
we 5
needed 5
a 5
spiritual 5
centre 5
in 5
crder 5
to 5
preserve 5
our 5
sense 5
of 5
solidarity 5
in 5
difficult 5
times 5
thus 5
arose 5
the 5
idea 5
of 5
zionism 5
and 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
settlement 5
in 5
palestine 5
the 5
successful 5
realization 5
of 5
which 5
we 5
have 5
been 5
permitted 5
to 5
witness 5
at 5
least 5
in 5
its 5
highly 5
promising 5
beginnings 5
i 5
have 5
had 5
the 5
privilege 5
of 5
seeing 5
to 5
my 5
great 5
joy 5
and 5
satisfaction 5
how 5
much 5
this 5
achievement 5
has 5
contributed 5
to 5
the 5
recovery 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
which 5
is 5
exposed 5
as 5
a 5
minority 5
among 5
the 5
nations 5
not 5
merely 5
to 5
external 5
dangers 5
but 5
also 5
to 5
internal 5
ones 5
of 5
a 5
psychological 5
nature 5
the 5
crisis 5
which 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
construction 5
has 5
had 5
to 5
face 5
in 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
years 5
has 5
lain 5
heavy 5
upon 5
us 5
and 5
is 5
not 5
yet 5
completely 5
surmounted 5
but 5
the 5
most 5
recent 5
reports 5
show 5
that 5
the 5
world 5
and 5
especially 5
the 5
british 5
government 5
is 5
disposed 5
to 5
recognize 5
the 5
great 5
things 5
which 5
lie 5
behind 5
our 5
struggle 5
for 5
the 5
zionist 5
ideal 5
let 5
us 5
at 5
this 5
moment 5
remember 5
with 5
gratitude 5
our 5
leader 5
weizmann 5
whose 5
zeal 5
and 5
circumspection 5
have 5
helped 5
the 5
good 5
cause 5
to 5
success 5
the 5
difficulties 5
we 5
have 5
been 5
through 5
have 5
also 5
brought 5
some 5
good 5
in 5
their 5
train 5
they 5
have 5
shown 5
us 5
once 5
more 5
how 5
strong 5
the 5
bond 5
is 5
which 5
unites 5
the 5
jews 5
of 5
all 5
countries 5
in 5
a 5
common 5
destiny 5
the 5
crisis 5
has 5
also 5
purified 5
our 5
attitude 5
to 5
the 5
question 5
of 5
palestine 5
purged 5
it 5
of 5
the 5
dross 5
of 5
nationalism 5
it 5
has 5
been 5
clearly 5
proclaimed 5
that 5
we 5
are 5
not 5
seeking 5
to 5
create 5
a 5
political 5
society 5
but 5
that 5
our 5
aim 5
is 5
in 5
accordance 5
with 5
the 5
old 5
tradition 5
of 5
jewry 5
a 5
cultural 5
one 5
in 5
the 5
widest 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
word 5
that 5
being 5
so 5
it 5
is 5
for 5
us 5
to 5
solve 5
the 5
problem 5
of 5
living 5
side 5
by 5
side 5
with 5
our 5
brother 5
the 5
arab 5
in 5
an 5
open 5
generous 5
and 5
worthy 5
manner 5
we 5
have 5
here 5
an 5
opportunity 5
of 5
showing 5
what 5
we 5
have 5
learnt 5
in 5
the 5
thousands 5
of 5
years 5
of 5
our 5
martyrdom 5
if 5
we 5
choose 5
the 5
right 5
path 5
we 5
shall 5
succeed 5
and 5
give 5
the 5
rest 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
a 5
fine 5
example 5
whatever 5
we 5
do 5
for 5
palestine 5
we 5
do 5
it 5
for 5
the 5
honour 5
and 5
wellbeing 5
of 5
the 5
whole 5
jewish 5
people 5
iii 5
i 5
am 5
delighted 5
to 5
have 5
the 5
opportunity 5
of 5
addressing 5
a 5
few 5
words 5
to 5
the 5
youth 5
of 5
this 5
country 5
which 5
is 5
faithful 5
to 5
the 5
common 5
aims 5
of 5
jewry 5
do 5
not 5
be 5
discouraged 5
by 5
the 5
difficulties 5
which 5
confront 5
us 5
in 5
palestine 5
such 5
things 5
serve 5
to 5
test 5
the 5
will 5
to 5
live 5
of 5
our 5
community 5
certain 5
proceedings 5
and 5
pronouncements 5
of 5
the 5
english 5
administration 5
have 5
been 5
justly 5
criticized 5
we 5
must 5
not 5
however 5
leave 5
it 5
at 5
that 5
but 5
learn 5
by 5
experience 5
we 5
need 5
to 5
pay 5
great 5
attention 5
to 5
our 5
relations 5
with 5
the 5
arabs 5
by 5
cultivating 5
these 5
carefully 5
we 5
shall 5
be 5
able 5
in 5
future 5
to 5
prevent 5
things 5
from 5
becoming 5
so 5
dangerously 5
strained 5
that 5
people 5
can 5
take 5
advantage 5
of 5
them 5
to 5
provoke 5
acts 5
of 5
hostility 5
this 5
goal 5
is 5
perfectly 5
within 5
our 5
reach 5
because 5
our 5
work 5
of 5
construction 5
has 5
been 5
and 5
must 5
continue 5
to 5
be 5
carried 5
out 5
in 5
such 5
a 5
manner 5
as 5
to 5
serve 5
the 5
real 5
interests 5
of 5
the 5
arab 5
population 5
also 5
in 5
this 5
way 5
we 5
shall 5
be 5
able 5
to 5
avoid 5
getting 5
ourselves 5
quite 5
so 5
often 5
into 5
the 5
position 5
disagreeable 5
for 5
jews 5
and 5
arabs 5
alike 5
of 5
having 5
to 5
call 5
in 5
the 5
mandatory 5
power 5
as 5
arbitrator 5
we 5
shall 5
thereby 5
be 5
following 5
not 5
merely 5
the 5
dictates 5
of 5
providence 5
but 5
also 5
our 5
traditions 5
which 5
alone 5
give 5
the 5
jewish 5
community 5
meaning 5
and 5
stability 5
for 5
that 5
community 5
is 5
not 5
and 5
must 5
never 5
become 5
a 5
political 5
one 5
this 5
is 5
the 5
only 5
permanent 5
source 5
whence 5
it 5
can 5
draw 5
new 5
strength 5
and 5
the 5
only 5
ground 5
on 5
which 5
its 5
existence 5
can 5
be 5
justified 5
iv 5
for 5
the 5
last 5
two 5
thousand 5
years 5
the 5
common 5
property 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
has 5
consisted 5
entirely 5
of 5
its 5
past 5
scattered 5
over 5
the 5
wide 5
world 5
our 5
nation 5
possessed 5
nothing 5
in 5
common 5
except 5
its 5
carefully 5
guarded 5
tradition 5
individual 5
jews 5
no 5
doubt 5
produced 5
great 5
work 5
but 5
it 5
seemed 5
as 5
if 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
had 5
not 5
the 5
strength 5
left 5
for 5
great 5
collective 5
achievements 5
now 5
all 5
that 5
is 5
changed 5
history 5
has 5
set 5
us 5
a 5
great 5
and 5
noble 5
task 5
in 5
the 5
shape 5
of 5
active 5
cooperation 5
in 5
the 5
building 5
up 5
of 5
palestine 5
eminent 5
members 5
of 5
our 5
race 5
are 5
already 5
at 5
work 5
with 5
all 5
their 5
might 5
on 5
the 5
realization 5
of 5
this 5
aim 5
the 5
opportunity 5
is 5
presented 5
to 5
us 5
of 5
setting 5
up 5
centres 5
of 5
civilization 5
which 5
the 5
whole 5
jewish 5
people 5
can 5
regard 5
as 5
its 5
work 5
we 5
nurse 5
the 5
hope 5
of 5
erecting 5
in 5
palestine 5
a 5
home 5
of 5
our 5
own 5
national 5
culture 5
which 5
shall 5
help 5
to 5
awaken 5
the 5
near 5
east 5
to 5
new 5
economic 5
and 5
spiritual 5
life 5
the 5
object 5
which 5
the 5
leaders 5
of 5
zionism 5
have 5
in 5
view 5
is 5
not 5
a 5
political 5
but 5
a 5
social 5
and 5
cultural 5
one 5
the 5
community 5
in 5
palestine 5
must 5
approach 5
the 5
social 5
ideal 5
of 5
our 5
forefathers 5
as 5
it 5
is 5
laid 5
down 5
in 5
the 5
bible 5
and 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
become 5
a 5
seat 5
of 5
modern 5
intellectual 5
life 5
a 5
spiritual 5
centre 5
for 5
the 5
jews 5
of 5
the 5
whole 5
world 5
in 5
accordance 5
with 5
this 5
notion 5
the 5
establishment 5
of 5
a 5
jewish 5
university 5
in 5
jerusalem 5
constitutes 5
one 5
of 5
the 5
most 5
important 5
aims 5
of 5
the 5
zionist 5
organization 5
during 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
months 5
i 5
have 5
been 5
to 5
america 5
in 5
order 5
to 5
help 5
to 5
raise 5
the 5
material 5
basis 5
for 5
this 5
university 5
there 5
the 5
success 5
of 5
this 5
enterprise 5
was 5
quite 5
natural 5
thanks 5
to 5
the 5
untiring 5
energy 5
and 5
splendid 5
selfsacrificing 5
spirit 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
doctors 5
in 5
america 5
we 5
have 5
succeeded 5
in 5
collecting 5
enough 5
money 5
for 5
the 5
creation 5
of 5
a 5
medical 5
faculty 5
and 5
the 5
preliminary 5
work 5
isbeing 5
started 5
at 5
once 5
after 5
this 5
success 5
i 5
have 5
no 5
doubt 5
that 5
the 5
material 5
basis 5
for 5
the 5
other 5
faculties 5
will 5
soon 5
be 5
forthcoming 5
the 5
medical 5
faculty 5
is 5
first 5
of 5
all 5
to 5
be 5
developed 5
as 5
a 5
research 5
institute 5
and 5
to 5
concentrate 5
on 5
making 5
the 5
country 5
healthy 5
a 5
most 5
important 5
item 5
in 5
the 5
work 5
of 5
development 5
teaching 5
on 5
a 5
large 5
scale 5
will 5
only 5
become 5
important 5
later 5
on 5
as 5
a 5
number 5
of 5
highly 5
competent 5
scientific 5
workers 5
have 5
already 5
signified 5
their 5
readiness 5
to 5
take 5
up 5
appointments 5
at 5
the 5
university 5
the 5
establishment 5
of 5
a 5
medical 5
faculty 5
seems 5
to 5
be 5
placed 5
beyond 5
all 5
doubt 5
i 5
may 5
add 5
that 5
a 5
special 5
fund 5
for 5
the 5
university 5
entirely 5
distinct 5
from 5
the 5
general 5
fund 5
for 5
the 5
development 5
of 5
the 5
country 5
has 5
been 5
opened 5
for 5
the 5
latter 5
considerable 5
sums 5
have 5
been 5
collected 5
during 5
these 5
months 5
in 5
america 5
thanks 5
to 5
the 5
indefatigable 5
labours 5
of 5
professor 5
weizmann 5
and 5
other 5
zionist 5
leaders 5
chiefly 5
through 5
the 5
selfsacrificing 5
spirit 5
of 5
the 5
middle 5
classes 5
i 5
conclude 5
with 5
a 5
warm 5
appeal 5
to 5
the 5
jews 5
in 5
germany 5
to 5
contribute 5
all 5
they 5
can 5
in 5
spite 5
of 5
the 5
present 5
economic 5
difficulties 5
for 5
the 5
building 5
up 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
home 5
in 5
palestine 5
this 5
is 5
not 5
a 5
matter 5
of 5
charity 5
but 5
an 5
enterprise 5
which 5
concerns 5
all 5
jews 5
and 5
the 5
success 5
of 5
which 5
promises 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
source 5
of 5
the 5
highest 5
satisfaction 5
to 5
all 5
v 5
for 5
us 5
jews 5
palestine 5
is 5
not 5
just 5
a 5
charitable 5
or 5
colonial 5
enterprise 5
but 5
a 5
problem 5
of 5
central 5
importance 5
for 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
palestine 5
is 5
not 5
primarily 5
a 5
place 5
of 5
refuge 5
for 5
the 5
jews 5
of 5
eastern 5
europe 5
but 5
the 5
embodiment 5
of 5
the 5
reawakening 5
corporate 5
spirit 5
of 5
the 5
whole 5
jewish 5
nation 5
is 5
it 5
the 5
right 5
moment 5
for 5
this 5
corporate 5
sense 5
to 5
be 5
awakened 5
and 5
strengthened 5
this 5
is 5
a 5
question 5
to 5
which 5
i 5
feel 5
compelled 5
not 5
merely 5
by 5
my 5
spontaneous 5
feelings 5
but 5
on 5
rational 5
grounds 5
to 5
return 5
an 5
unqualified 5
yes 5
let 5
us 5
just 5
cast 5
our 5
eyes 5
over 5
the 5
history 5
of 5
the 5
jews 5
in 5
germany 5
during 5
the 5
past 5
hundred 5
years 5
a 5
century 5
ago 5
our 5
forefathers 5
with 5
few 5
exceptions 5
lived 5
in 5
the 5
ghetto 5
they 5
were 5
poor 5
without 5
political 5
rights 5
separated 5
from 5
the 5
gentiles 5
by 5
a 5
barrier 5
of 5
religious 5
traditions 5
habits 5
of 5
life 5
and 5
legal 5
restrictions 5
their 5
intellectual 5
development 5
was 5
restricted 5
to 5
their 5
own 5
literature 5
and 5
they 5
had 5
remained 5
almost 5
unaffected 5
by 5
the 5
mighty 5
advance 5
of 5
the 5
european 5
intellect 5
which 5
dates 5
from 5
the 5
renaissance 5
and 5
yet 5
these 5
obscure 5
humble 5
people 5
had 5
one 5
great 5
advantage 5
over 5
us 5
each 5
of 5
them 5
belonged 5
in 5
every 5
fibre 5
of 5
his 5
being 5
to 5
a 5
community 5
m 5
which 5
he 5
was 5
completely 5
absorbed 5
in 5
which 5
he 5
felt 5
himself 5
a 5
fully 5
pnvileged 5
member 5
and 5
which 5
demanded 5
nothing 5
of 5
him 5
that 5
was 5
contrary 5
to 5
his 5
natural 5
habits 5
of 5
thought 5
our 5
forefathers 5
in 5
those 5
days 5
were 5
pretty 5
poor 5
specimens 5
intellectually 5
and 5
physically 5
but 5
socially 5
speaking 5
they 5
enjoyed 5
an 5
enviable 5
spiritual 5
equilibrium 5
then 5
came 5
emancipation 5
which 5
suddenly 5
opened 5
up 5
undreamedof 5
possibilities 5
to 5
the 5
individual 5
some 5
few 5
rapidly 5
made 5
a 5
position 5
for 5
themselves 5
in 5
the 5
higher 5
walks 5
of 5
business 5
and 5
social 5
life 5
they 5
greedily 5
lapped 5
up 5
the 5
splendid 5
triumphs 5
which 5
the 5
art 5
and 5
science 5
of 5
the 5
western 5
world 5
had 5
achieved 5
they 5
joined 5
in 5
the 5
process 5
with 5
burning 5
enthusiasm 5
themselves 5
making 5
contributions 5
of 5
lasting 5
value 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
they 5
imitated 5
the 5
external 5
forms 5
of 5
gentile 5
life 5
departed 5
more 5
and 5
more 5
from 5
their 5
religious 5
and 5
social 5
traditions 5
and 5
adopted 5
gentile 5
customs 5
manners 5
and 5
habits 5
of 5
thought 5
it 5
seemed 5
as 5
though 5
they 5
were 5
completely 5
losing 5
their 5
identity 5
in 5
the 5
superior 5
numbers 5
and 5
more 5
highly 5
organized 5
culture 5
of 5
the 5
nations 5
among 5
whom 5
they 5
lived 5
so 5
that 5
in 5
a 5
few 5
generations 5
there 5
would 5
be 5
no 5
trace 5
of 5
them 5
left 5
a 5
complete 5
disappearance 5
of 5
jewish 5
nationality 5
in 5
central 5
and 5
western 5
europe 5
seemed 5
inevitable 5
but 5
events 5
turned 5
out 5
otherwise 5
nationalities 5
of 5
different 5
race 5
seem 5
to 5
have 5
an 5
instinct 5
which 5
prevents 5
them 5
from 5
fusing 5
however 5
much 5
the 5
jews 5
adapted 5
themselves 5
in 5
language 5
manners 5
and 5
to 5
a 5
great 5
extent 5
even 5
in 5
the 5
forms 5
of 5
religion 5
to 5
the 5
european 5
peoples 5
among 5
whom 5
they 5
lived 5
the 5
feeling 5
of 5
strangeness 5
between 5
the 5
jews 5
and 5
their 5
hosts 5
never 5
disappeared 5
this 5
spontaneous 5
feeling 5
is 5
the 5
ultimate 5
cause 5
of 5
antisemitism 5
which 5
is 5
therefore 5
not 5
to 5
be 5
got 5
rid 5
of 5
by 5
wellmeaning 5
propaganda 5
nationalities 5
want 5
to 5
pursue 5
their 5
own 5
path 5
not 5
to 5
blend 5
a 5
satisfactory 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
can 5
be 5
brought 5
about 5
only 5
by 5
mutual 5
toleration 5
and 5
respect 5
the 5
first 5
step 5
in 5
that 5
direction 5
is 5
that 5
we 5
jews 5
should 5
once 5
more 5
become 5
conscious 5
of 5
our 5
existence 5
as 5
a 5
nationality 5
and 5
regain 5
the 5
selfrespect 5
that 5
is 5
necessary 5
to 5
a 5
healthy 5
existence 5
we 5
must 5
learn 5
once 5
more 5
to 5
glory 5
in 5
our 5
ancestors 5
and 5
our 5
history 5
and 5
once 5
again 5
take 5
upon 5
ourselves 5
as 5
a 5
nation 5
cultural 5
tasks 5
of 5
a 5
sort 5
calculated 5
to 5
strengthen 5
our 5
sense 5
of 5
the 5
community 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
enough 5
for 5
us 5
to 5
play 5
a 5
part 5
as 5
individuals 5
in 5
the 5
cultural 5
development 5
of 5
the 5
human 5
race 5
we 5
must 5
also 5
tackle 5
tasks 5
which 5
only 5
nations 5
as 5
a 5
whole 5
can 5
perform 5
only 5
so 5
can 5
the 5
jews 5
regain 5
social 5
health 5
it 5
is 5
from 5
this 5
point 5
of 5
view 5
that 5
i 5
would 5
have 5
you 5
look 5
at 5
the 5
zionist 5
movement 5
today 5
history 5
has 5
assigned 5
to 5
us 5
the 5
task 5
of 5
taking 5
an 5
active 5
part 5
in 5
the 5
economic 5
and 5
cultural 5
reconstruction 5
of 5
our 5
native 5
land 5
enthusiasts 5
men 5
of 5
brilliant 5
gifts 5
have 5
cleared 5
the 5
way 5
and 5
many 5
excellent 5
members 5
of 5
our 5
race 5
are 5
prepared 5
to 5
devote 5
themselves 5
heart 5
and 5
soul 5
to 5
the 5
cause 5
may 5
every 5
one 5
of 5
them 5
fully 5
realize 5
the 5
importance 5
of 5
this 5
work 5
and 5
contribute 5
according 5
to 5
his 5
powers 5
to 5
its 5
success 5
the 5
jewish 5
community 5
a 5
speech 5
in 5
london 5
ladies 5
and 5
gentlemen 5
it 5
is 5
no 5
easy 5
matter 5
for 5
me 5
to 5
overcome 5
my 5
natural 5
inclination 5
to 5
a 5
life 5
of 5
quiet 5
contemplation 5
but 5
i 5
could 5
not 5
remain 5
deaf 5
to 5
the 5
appeal 5
of 5
the 5
ort 5
and 5
oze 5
societies 5
for 5
in 5
responding 5
to 5
it 5
i 5
am 5
responding 5
as 5
it 5
were 5
to 5
the 5
appeal 5
of 5
our 5
sorely 5
oppressed 5
jewish 5
nation 5
the 5
position 5
of 5
our 5
scattered 5
jewish 5
community 5
is 5
a 5
moral 5
barometer 5
for 5
the 5
political 5
world 5
for 5
what 5
surer 5
index 5
of 5
political 5
morality 5
and 5
respect 5
for 5
justice 5
can 5
there 5
be 5
than 5
the 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
nations 5
towards 5
a 5
defenceless 5
minority 5
whose 5
peculiarity 5
lies 5
in 5
their 5
preservation 5
of 5
an 5
ancient 5
cultural 5
tradition 5
jewish 5
charitable 5
associations 5
this 5
barometer 5
is 5
low 5
at 5
the 5
present 5
moment 5
as 5
we 5
are 5
painfully 5
aware 5
from 5
the 5
way 5
we 5
are 5
treated 5
but 5
it 5
is 5
this 5
very 5
lowness 5
that 5
confirms 5
me 5
in 5
the 5
conviction 5
that 5
it 5
is 5
our 5
duty 5
to 5
preserve 5
and 5
consolidate 5
our 5
community 5
embedded 5
in 5
the 5
tradition 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
there 5
is 5
a 5
love 5
of 5
justice 5
and 5
reason 5
which 5
must 5
continue 5
to 5
work 5
for 5
the 5
good 5
of 5
all 5
nations 5
now 5
and 5
in 5
the 5
future 5
in 5
modern 5
times 5
this 5
tradition 5
has 5
produced 5
spinoza 5
and 5
karl 5
marx 5
those 5
who 5
would 5
preserve 5
the 5
spirit 5
must 5
also 5
look 5
after 5
the 5
body 5
to 5
which 5
it 5
is 5
attached 5
the 5
oze 5
society 5
literally 5
looks 5
after 5
the 5
bodies 5
of 5
our 5
people 5
in 5
eastern 5
europe 5
it 5
is 5
working 5
day 5

night 5
to 5
help 5
our 5
people 5
there 5
on 5
whom 5
the 5
economic 5
depression 5
has 5
fallen 5
particularly 5
heavily 5
to 5
keep 5
body 5
and 5
soul 5
together 5
while 5
the 5

is 5
trying 5
to 5
get 5
rid 5
of 5
a 5
severe 5
social 5
and 5
economic 5
handicap 5
under 5
which 5
the 5
jews 5
have 5
laboured 5
since 5
the 5
middle 5
ages 5
because 5
we 5
were 5
then 5
excluded 5
from 5
all 5
directly 5
productive 5
occupations 5
we 5
were 5
forced 5
into 5
the 5
purely 5
commercial 5
ones 5
the 5
only 5
way 5
of 5
really 5
helping 5
the 5
jew 5
in 5
eastern 5
countries 5
is 5
to 5
give 5
him 5
access 5
to 5
new 5
fields 5
of 5
activity 5
for 5
which 5
he 5
is 5
struggling 5
all 5
over 5
the 5
world 5
this 5
is 5
the 5
grave 5
problem 5
which 5
the 5
ort 5
society 5
is 5
successfully 5
tackling 5
it 5
is 5
to 5
you 5
english 5
fellowjews 5
that 5
we 5
now 5
appeal 5
to 5
help 5
us 5
in 5
this 5
great 5
enterprise 5
which 5
splendid 5
men 5
have 5
set 5
on 5
foot 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
years 5
nay 5
the 5
last 5
few 5
days 5
have 5
brought 5
us 5
a 5
disappointment 5
which 5
must 5
have 5
touched 5
you 5
in 5
particular 5
nearly 5
do 5
not 5
gird 5
at 5
fate 5
but 5
rather 5
look 5
on 5
these 5
events 5
as 5
a 5
reason 5
for 5
remaining 5
true 5
to 5
the 5
cause 5
of 5
the 5
jewish 5
commonwealth 5
i 5
am 5
convinced 5
that 5
in 5
doing 5
that 5
we 5
shall 5
also 5
indirectly 5
be 5
promoting 5
those 5
general 5
human 5
ends 5
which 5
we 5
must 5
always 5
recognize 5
as 5
the 5
highest 5
remember 5
that 5
difficulties 5
and 5
obstacles 5
are 5
a 5
valuable 5
source 5
of 5
health 5
and 5
strength 5
to 5
any 5
society 5
we 5
should 5
not 5
have 5
survived 5
for 5
thousands 5
of 5
years 5
as 5
a 5
community 5
if 5
our 5
bed 5
had 5
been 5
of 5
roses 5
of 5
that 5
i 5
am 5
quite 5
sure 5
but 5
we 5
have 5
a 5
still 5
fairer 5
consolation 5
our 5
friends 5
are 5
not 5
exactly 5
numerous 5
but 5
among 5
them 5
are 5
men 5
of 5
noble 5
spirit 5
and 5
strong 5
sense 5
of 5
justice 5
who 5
have 5
devoted 5
their 5
lives 5
to 5
uplifting 5
human 5
society 5
and 5
liberating 5
the 5
individual 5
from 5
degrading 5
oppression 5
we 5
are 5
happy 5
and 5
fortunate 5
to 5
have 5
such 5
men 5
from 5
the 5
gentile 5
world 5
among 5
us 5
tonight 5
their 5
presence 5
lends 5
an 5
added 5
solemnity 5
to 5
this 5
memorable 5
evening 5
it 5
gives 5
me 5
great 5
pleasure 5
to 5
see 5
before 5
me 5
bernard 5
shaw 5
and 5
h 5
g 5

to 5
whose 5
view 5
of 5
life 5
i 5
am 5
particularly 5
attracted 5
you 5
mr 5
shaw 5
have 5
succeeded 5
in 5
winning 5
the 5
affection 5
and 5
joyous 5
admiration 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
while 5
pursuing 5
a 5
path 5
that 5
has 5
led 5
many 5
others 5
to 5
a 5
martyrs 5
crown 5
you 5
have 5
not 5
merely 5
preached 5
moral 5
sermons 5
to 5
your 5
fellows 5
you 5
have 5
actually 5
mocked 5
at 5
things 5
which 5
many 5
of 5
them 5
held 5
sacred 5
you 5
have 5
done 5
what 5
only 5
the 5
born 5
artist 5
can 5
do 5
from 5
your 5
magic 5
box 5
you 5
have 5
produced 5
innumerable 5
little 5
figures 5
which 5
while 5
resembling 5
human 5
beings 5
are 5
compact 5
not 5
of 5
flesh 5
and 5
blood 5
but 5
of 5
brains 5
wit 5
and 5
charm 5
and 5
yet 5
in 5
a 5
way 5
they 5
are 5
more 5
human 5
than 5
we 5
are 5
ourselves 5
and 5
one 5
almost 5
forgets 5
that 5
they 5
are 5
creations 5
not 5
of 5
nature 5
but 5
of 5
bernard 5
shaw 5
you 5
make 5
these 5
charming 5
little 5
figures 5
dance 5
in 5
a 5
miniature 5
world 5
in 5
front 5
of 5
which 5
the 5
graces 5
stand 5
sentinel 5
and 5
permit 5
no 5
bitterness 5
to 5
enter 5
he 5
who 5
has 5
looked 5
into 5
this 5
little 5
world 5
sees 5
our 5
actual 5
world 5
in 5
a 5
new 5
light 5
its 5
puppets 5
insinuate 5
themselves 5
into 5
real 5
people 5
making 5
them 5
suddenly 5
look 5
quite 5
different 5
by 5
thus 5
holding 5
the 5
mirror 5
up 5
to 5
us 5
all 5
you 5
have 5
had 5
a 5
liberating 5
effect 5
on 5
us 5
such 5
as 5
hardly 5
any 5
other 5
of 5
our 5
contemporaries 5
has 5
done 5
and 5
have 5
relieved 5
life 5
of 5
something 5
of 5
its 5
earthbound 5
heaviness 5
for 5
this 5
we 5
are 5
all 5
devoutly 5
grateful 5
to 5
you 5
and 5
also 5
to 5
fate 5
which 5
along 5
with 5
grievous 5
plagues 5
has 5
also 5
given 5
us 5
the 5
physician 5
and 5
liberator 5
of 5
our 5
souls 5
i 5
personally 5
am 5
also 5
grateful 5
to 5
you 5
for 5
the 5
unforgettable 5
words 5
which 5
you 5
have 5
addressed 5
to 5
my 5
mythical 5
namesake 5
who 5
makes 5
life 5
so 5
difficult 5
for 5
me 5
although 5
he 5
is 5
really 5
for 5
all 5
his 5
clumsy 5
formidable 5
size 5
quite 5
a 5
harmless 5
fellow 5
to 5
you 5
all 5
i 5
say 5
that 5
the 5
existence 5
and 5
destiny 5
of 5
our 5
people 5
depend 5
less 5
on 5
external 5
factors 5
than 5
on 5
ourselves 5
remaining 5
faithful 5
to 5
the 5
moral 5
traditions 5
which 5
have 5
enabled 5
us 5
to 5
survive 5
for 5
thousands 5
of 5
years 5
despite 5
the 5
heavy 5
storms 5
that 5
have 5
broken 5
over 5
our 5
heads 5
in 5
the 5
service 5
of 5
life 5
sacrifice 5
becomes 5
grace 5
working 5
palestine 5
among 5
zionist 5
organizations 5
working 5
palestine 5
is 5
the 5
one 5
whose 5
work 5
is 5
of 5
most 5
direct 5
benefit 5
to 5
the 5
most 5
valuable 5
class 5
of 5
people 5

therenamely 5
those 5
who 5
are 5
transforming 5

into 5
flourishing 5
settlements 5
by 5
the 5
labour 5
of 5
their 5

the 5

not 5

a 5
difficult 5

dangerous 5
business 5
involving 5
a 5
heavy 5
personal 5
sacrifice 5
how 5
true 5
this 5
is 5
only 5
they 5
can 5
judge 5
who 5

seen 5
it 5
with 5

anyone 5
who 5
helps 5
to 5
improve 5
the 5

of 5
these 5
men 5
is 5
helping 5
on 5
the 5
good 5
work 5
at 5
a 5
crucial 5
point 5
it 5
is 5
moreover 5
this 5
working 5
class 5
alone 5
that 5
has 5
it 5
in 5
its 5
power 5
to 5
establish 5
healthy 5
relations 5
with 5
the 5
arabs 5
which 5
is 5
the 5
most 5
important 5
political 5
task 5
of 5
zionism 5
administrations 5
come 5
and 5
go 5
but 5
it 5
is 5
human 5
relations 5
that 5
finally 5
turn 5
the 5
scale 5
in 5
the 5
lives 5
of 5
nations 5
therefore 5
to 5
support 5
working 5
palestine 5
is 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
to 5
promote 5
a 5
humane 5
and 5
worthy 5
policy 5
in 5
palestine 5
and 5
to 5
oppose 5
an 5
effective 5
resistance 5
to 5
those 5
undercurrents 5
of 5
narrow 5
nationalism 5
from 5

the 5
whole 5

a 5

is 5
suffering 5
jewish 5
recovery 5
i 5
gladly 5
accede 5
to 5
your 5
papers 5
request 5
that 5
i 5
should 5
address 5
an 5
appeal 5

the 5

enemies 5

honour 5
of 5
the 5

are 5
fatty 5
degenerationby 5
which 5
i 5
mean 5
the 5
unconscionableness 5
which 5
comes 5
from 5
wealth 5
and 5
easeand 5
a 5
kind 5
of 5
inner 5
dependence 5
on 5
the 5
surrounding 5
gentile 5
world 5
which 5
comes 5
from 5
the 5
loosening 5
of 5
the 5
fabric 5
of 5
jewish 5
society 5
the 5
best 5
in 5
man 5
can 5
flourish 5
only 5
when 5
he 5
loses 5
himself 5
in 5
a 5
community 5
hence 5
the 5
moral 5
danger 5
of 5
the 5
jew 5
who 5
has 5
lost 5
touch 5
with 5
his 5
own 5
people 5
and 5
is 5
regarded 5
as 5
a 5
foreigner 5
by 5
the 5
people 5
of 5
his 5
adoption 5
only 5
too 5
often 5
a 5
contemptible 5
and 5
joyless 5
egoism 5
has 5
resulted 5
from 5
such 5
circumstances 5
the 5
weight 5
of 5
outward 5
oppression 5
on 5
the 5
jewish 5
people 5
is 5
particularly 5
heavy 5
at 5
the 5
moment 5
but 5
this 5
very 5
bitterness 5
has 5
done 5
us 5
good 5
a 5
revival 5
of 5
jewish 5
national 5
life 5
such 5
as 5
the 5
last 5
generation 5
could 5
never 5
have 5
dreamed 5
of 5
has 5
begun 5
through 5
the 5
operation 5
of 5
a 5
newly 5
awakened 5
sense 5
of 5
solidarity 5
among 5
the 5
jews 5
the 5
scheme 5
of 5
colonizing 5
palestine 5
launched 5
by 5
a 5
handful 5
of 5
devoted 5
and 5
judicious 5
leaders 5
in 5
the 5
face 5
of 5
apparently 5
insuperable 5
difficulties 5

already 5
prospered 5
so 5
far 5
that 5
i 5
feel 5
no 5
doubt 5
about 5
its 5
permanent 5
success 5
the 5
value 5
of 5
this 5
achievement 5
for 5
the 5
jews 5
everywhere 5
is 5
very 5
great 5
palestine 5
will 5
be 5
a 5
centre 5
of 5
culture 5
for 5
all 5
jews 5
a 5
refuge 5
for 5
the 5

oppressed 5
a 5
field 5
of 5
action 5

attaining 5
inward 5
health 5

the 5

of 5
the 5
whole 5
world 5
antisemitism 5
and 5
academic 5
youth 5
so 5
long 5
as 5
we 5
lived 5
in 5
the 5
ghetto 5
our 5
jewish 5
nationality 5
involved 5
for 5
us 5
material 5
difficulties 5
and 5
sometimes 5
physical 5
danger 5
but 5
no 5
social 5
or 5
psychological 5
problems 5
with 5
emancipation 5
the 5
position 5
changed 5
particularly 5
for 5
those 5
jews 5
who 5
turned 5
to 5
the 5
intellectual 5
professions 5
in 5
school 5
and 5
at 5
the 5
university 5
the 5
young 5
jew 5
is 5
exposed 5
to 5
the 5
influence 5
of 5
a 5
society 5
with 5
a 5
definite 5
national 5
tinge 5
which 5
he 5
respects 5
and 5
admires 5
from 5
which 5
he 5
receives 5
his 5
mental 5
sustenance 5
to 5
which 5
he 5
feels 5
himself 5
to 5
belong 5
while 5
it 5
on 5
the 5
other 5
hand 5
treats 5
him 5
as 5
one 5
of 5
an 5
alien 5
race 5
with 5
a 5
certain 5
contempt 5
and 5
hostility 5
driven 5
by 5
the 5
suggestive 5
influence 5
of 5
this 5
psychological 5
superiority 5
rather 5
than 5
by 5
utilitarian 5
considerations 5
he 5
turns 5
his 5
back 5
on 5
his 5
people 5
and 5
his 5
traditions 5
and 5
considers 5
himself 5
as 5
belonging 5
entirely 5
to 5
the 5
others 5
while 5
he 5
tries 5
in 5
vain 5
to 5
conceal 5
from 5
himself 5
and 5
them 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
the 5
relation 5
is 5
not 5
reciprocal 5
hence 5
that 5
pathetic 5
creature 5
the 5
baptized 5
jewish 5
geheimrat 5
of 5
yesterday 5
and 5
today 5
in 5
most 5
cases 5
it 5
is 5
not 5
pushfulness 5
and 5
lack 5
of 5
character 5
that 5
have 5
made 5
him 5
what 5
he 5
is 5
but 5
as 5
i 5
have 5
said 5
the 5
suggestive 5
power 5
of 5
an 5
environment 5
superior 5
in 5
numbers 5
and 5

an 5

let 5
us 5
live 5

not 5

a 5
letter 5
to 5
professor 5
dr 5
hellpach 5
minister 5
of 5
state 5
dear 5
herr 5
hellpach 5
i 5
have 5
read 5
your 5
article 5
on 5
zionism 5
and 5
the 5
zurich 5
congress 5
and 5
feel 5
as 5
a 5
strong 5
devotee 5
of 5
the 5
zionist 5
idea 5
that 5
i 5
must 5
answer 5
you 5
even 5
if 5
it 5
is 5
only 5
shortly 5
the 5
jews 5
are 5
a 5
community 5
bound 5
together 5
by 5
ties 5
of 5
blood 5
and 5
tradition 5
and 5
not 5
of 5
religion 5
only 5
the 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
rest 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
towards 5
them 5
is 5
sufficient 5
proof 5
of 5
this 5
when 5
i 5
came 5
to 5
germany 5
fifteen 5
years 5
ago 5
i 5
discovered 5
for 5
the 5
first 5
time 5
that 5
i 5
was 5
a 5
jew 5
and 5
i 5
owe 5
this 5
discovery 5
more 5
to 5
gentiles 5
than 5
jews 5
the 5
tragedy 5
of 5
the 5
jews 5
is 5
that 5
they 5
are 5
people 5
of 5
a 5
definite 5
historical 5
type 5
who 5
lack 5
the 5
support 5
of 5
a 5
community 5
to 5
keep 5
them 5
together 5
the 5
result 5
is 5
a 5
want 5
of 5
solid 5
foundations 5
in 5
the 5
individual 5
which 5
amounts 5
in 5
its 5
extremer 5
forms 5
to 5
moral 5
instability 5
i 5
realized 5
that 5
the 5
only 5
possible 5
salvation 5
for 5
the 5
race 5
was 5
that 5
every 5
jew 5
in 5
the 5
world 5
should 5
become 5
attached 5
to 5
a 5
living 5
society 5
to 5
which 5
the 5
individual 5
rejoiced 5
to 5
belong 5
and 5
which 5
enabled 5
him 5
to 5
bear 5
the 5
hatred 5
and 5
the 5
humiliations 5
that 5
he 5
has 5
to 5
put 5
up 5
with 5
from 5
the 5
rest 5
of 5
the 5
world 5
i 5
saw 5
worthy 5
jews 5
basely 5
caricatured 5
and 5
the 5
sight 5
made 5
my 5
heart 5
bleed 5
i 5
saw 5
how 5
schools 5
comic 5
papers 5
and 5
innumerable 5
other 5
forces 5
of 5
the 5
gentile 5
majority 5
undermined 5
the 5
confidence 5
even 5
of 5
the 5
best 5
of 5
my 5
fellowjews 5
and 5
felt 5
that 5
this 5
could 5
not 5
be 5
allowed 5
to 5
continue 5
then 5
i 5
realized 5
that 5
only 5
a 5
common 5
enterprise 5
dear 5
to 5
the 5
hearts 5
of 5
jews 5
all 5
over 5
the 5
world 5
could 5
restore 5
this 5
people 5
to 5
health 5
it 5
was 5
a 5
great 5
achievement 5
of 5
herzls 5
to 5
have 5
realized 5
and 5
proclaimed 5
at 5
the 5
top 5
of 5
his 5
voice 5
that 5
the 5
traditional 5
attitude 5
of 5
the 5
jews 5
being 5
what 5
it 5
was 5
the 5
establishment 5
of 5
a 5
national 5
home 5
or 5
more 5
accurately 5
a 5
centre 5
in 5
palestine 5
was 5
a 5
suitable 5
object 5
on 5
which 5
to 5
concentrate 5
our 5
efforts 5
all 5
this 5
you 5
call 5
nationalism 5
and 5
there 5
is 5
something 5
in 5
the 5
accusation 5
but 5
a 5
communal 5
purpose 5
without 5
which 5
we 5
can 5
neither 5
live 5
nor 5
die 5
in 5
this 5
hostile 5
world 5
can 5
always 5
be 5
called 5
by 5
that 5
ugly 5
name 5
in 5
any 5
case 5
it 5
is 5
a 5
nationalism 5
whose 5
aim 5
is 5
not 5
power 5
but 5
dignity 5
and 5
health 5
if 5
we 5
did 5
not 5
have 5
to 5
live 5
among 5
intolerant 5
narrowminded 5
and 5
violent 5
people 5
i 5
should 5
be 5
the 5
first 5
to 5
throw 5
over 5
all 5
nationalism 5
in 5
favour 5
of 5
universal 5
humanity 5
the 5
objection 5
that 5
we 5
jews 5
cannot 5
be 5
proper 5
citizens 5
of 5
the 5
german 5
state 5
for 5
example 5
if 5
we 5
want 5
to 5
be 5
a 5
nation 5
is 5
based 5
on 5
a 5
misunderstanding 5
of 5
the 5
nature 5
of 5
the 5
state 5
which 5
springs 5
from 5
the 5
intolerance 5
of 5
national 5
majorities 5
against 5
that 5
intolerance 5
we 5
shall 5
never 5
be 5
safe 5
whether 5
we 5
call 5
ourselves 5
a 5
people 5
or 5
nation 5
or 5
not 5
i 5
have 5
put 5
all 5
this 5
with 5
brutal 5
frankness 5
for 5
the 5
sake 5
of 5
brevity 5
but 5
i 5
know 5
from 5
your 5
writings 5
that 5
you 5
are 5
a 5
man 5
who 5
attends 5
to 5
the 5
sense 5
not 5
the 5
form 5
letter 5
to 5
an 5
arab 5
march 5
sir 5
your 5
letter 5
has 5
given 5
me 5
great 5
pleasure 5
it 5
shows 5
me 5
that 5
there 5
is 5
good 5
will 5
available 5
on 5
your 5
side 5
too 5
for 5
solving 5
the 5
present 5
difficulties 5
in 5
a 5
manner 5
worthy 5
of 5
both 5
our 5
nations 5
i 5
believe 5
that 5
these 5
difficulties 5
are 5
more 5
psychological 5
than 5
real 5
and 5
that 5
they 5
can 5
be 5
got 5
over 5
if 5
both 5
sides 5
bring 5
honesty 5
and 5
good 5
will 5
to 5
the 5
task 5
what 5
makes 5
the 5
present 5
position 5
so 5
bad 5
is 5
the 5
fact 5
that 5
jews 5
and 5
arabs 5
confront 5
each 5
other 5
as 5
opponents 5
before 5
the 5
mandatory 5
power 5
this 5
state 5
of 5
affairs 5
is 5
unworthy 5
of 5
both 5
nations 5
and 5
can 5
only 5
be 5
altered 5
by 5
our 5
finding 5
a 5
via 5
media 5
on 5
which 5
both 5
sides 5
agree 5
i 5
will 5
now 5
tell 5
you 5
how 5
i 5
think 5
that 5
the 5
present 5
difficulties 5
might 5
be 5
remedied 5
at 5
the 5
same 5
time 5
i 5
must 5
add 5
that 5
this 5
is 5
only 5
my 5
personal 5
opinion 5
which 5
i 5
have 5
discussed 5
with 5
nobody 5
i 5
am 5
writing 5
this 5
letter 5
in 5
german 5
because 5
i 5
am 5
not 5
capable 5
of 5
writing 5
it 5
in 5
english 5
myself 5
and 5
because 5
i 5
want 5
myself 5
to 5
bear 5
the 5
entire 5
responsibility 5
for 5
it 5
you 5
will 5
i 5
am 5
sure 5
be 5
able 5
to 5
get 5

indeed 6
it 6
was 6
much 6
more 6
than 6
a 6
friend 6
in 6
the 6
words 6
of 6
one 6
of 6
the 6
early 6
spanish 6
visitors 6
to 6
the 6
new 6
world 6
they 6
eat 6
a 6
root 6
which 6
they 6
call 6
peyote 6
and 6
which 6
they 6
venerate 6
as 6
though 6
it 6
were 6
a 6
deity 6
why 6
they 6
should 6
have 6
venerated 6
it 6
as 6
a 6
deity 6
became 6
apparent 6
when 6
such 6
eminent 6
psychologists 6
as 6
jaensch 6
havelock 6
ellis 6
and 6
weir 6
mitchell 6
began 6
their 6
experiments 6
with 6
mescalin 6
the 6
active 6
principle 6
of 6
peyote 6
true 6
they 6
stopped 6
short 6
at 6
a 6
point 6
well 6
this 6
side 6
of 6
idolatry 6
but 6
all 6
concurred 6
in 6
assigning 6
to 6
mescalin 6
a 6
position 6
among 6
drugs 6
of 6
unique 6
distinction 6
administered 6
in 6
suitable 6
doses 6
it 6
changes 6
the 6
quality 6
of 6
consciousness 6
more 6
profoundly 6
and 6
yet 6
is 6
less 6
toxic 6
than 6
any 6
other 6
substance 6
in 6
the 6
pharmacologists 6
repertory 6
mescalin 6
research 6
has 6
been 6
going 6
on 6
sporadically 6
ever 6
since 6
the 6
days 6
of 6
lewin 6
and 6
havelock 6
ellis 6
chemists 6
have 6
not 6
merely 6
isolated 6
the 6
alkaloid 6
they 6
have 6
learned 6
how 6
to 6
synthesize 6
it 6
so 6
that 6
the 6
supply 6
no 6
longer 6
depends 6
on 6
the 6
sparse 6
and 6
intermittent 6
crop 6
of 6
a 6
desert 6
cactus 6
alienists 6
have 6
dosed 6
themselves 6
with 6
mescalin 6
in 6
the 6
hope 6
thereby 6
of 6
coming 6
to 6
a 6
better 6
a 6
firsthand 6
understanding 6
of 6
their 6
patients 6
mental 6
processes 6
working 6
unfortunately 6
upon 6
too 6
few 6
subjects 6
within 6
too 6
narrow 6
a 6
range 6
of 6
circumstances 6
psychologists 6
have 6
observed 6
and 6
catalogued 6
some 6
of 6
the 6
drugs 6
more 6
striking 6
effects 6
neurologists 6
and 6
physiologists 6
have 6
found 6
out 6
something 6
about 6
the 6
mechanism 6
of 6
its 6
action 6
upon 6
the 6
central 6
nervous 6
system 6
and 6
at 6
least 6
one 6
professional 6
philosopher 6
has 6
taken 6
mescalin 6
for 6
the 6
light 6
it 6
may 6
throw 6
on 6
such 6
ancient 6
unsolved 6
riddles 6
as 6
the 6
place 6
of 6
mind 6
in 6
nature 6
and 6
the 6
relationship 6
between 6
brain 6
and 6
consciousness 6
there 6
matters 6
rested 6
until 6
two 6
or 6
three 6
years 6
ago 6
a 6
new 6
and 6
perhaps 6
highly 6
significant 6
fact 6
was 6
observed 6
actually 6
the 6
fact 6
had 6
been 6
staring 6
everyone 6
in 6
the 6
face 6
for 6
several 6
decades 6
but 6
nobody 6
as 6
it 6
happened 6
had 6
noticed 6
it 6
until 6
a 6
young 6
english 6
psychiatrist 6
at 6
present 6
working 6
in 6
canada 6
was 6
struck 6
by 6
the 6
close 6
similarity 6
in 6
chemical 6
composition 6
between 6
mescalin 6
and 6
adrenalin 6
further 6
research 6
revealed 6
that 6
lysergic 6
acid 6
an 6
extremely 6
potent 6
hallucinogen 6
derived 6
from 6
ergot 6
has 6
a 6
structural 6
biochemical 6
relationship 6
to 6
the 6
others 6
then 6
came 6
the 6
discovery 6
that 6
adrenochrome 6
which 6
is 6
a 6
product 6
of 6
the 6
decomposition 6
of 6
adrenalin 6
can 6
produce 6
many 6
of 6
the 6
symptoms 6
observed 6
in 6
mescalin 6
intoxication 6
but 6
adrenochrome 6
probably 6
occurs 6
spontaneously 6
in 6
the 6
human 6
body 6
in 6
other 6
words 6
each 6
one 6
of 6
us 6
may 6
be 6
capable 6
of 6
manufacturing 6
a 6
chemical 6
minute 6
doses 6
of 6
which 6
are 6
known 6
to 6
cause 6
profound 6
changes 6
in 6
consciousness 6
certain 6
of 6
these 6
changes 6
are 6
similar 6
to 6
those 6
which 6
occur 6
in 6
that 6
most 6
characteristic 6
plague 6
of 6
the 6
twentieth 6
century 6
schizophrenia 6
is 6
the 6
mental 6
disorder 6
due 6
to 6
a 6
chemical 6
disorder 6
and 6
is 6
the 6
chemical 6
disorder 6
due 6
in 6
its 6
turn 6
to 6
psychological 6
distresses 6
affecting 6
the 6
adrenals 6
it 6
would 6
be 6
rash 6
and 6
premature 6
to 6
affirm 6
it 6
the 6
most 6
we 6
can 6
say 6
is 6
that 6
some 6
kind 6
of 6
a 6
prima 6
facie 6
case 6
has 6
been 6
made 6
out 6
meanwhile 6
the 6

systematically 6

of 6
mescalin 6
research 6
the 6
psychological 6
material 6
at 6
his 6
disposal 6
was 6
still 6
absurdly 6
inadequate 6
and 6
he 6
was 6
anxious 6
to 6
add 6
to 6
it 6
i 6
was 6
on 6

spot 6
and 6
willing 6
indeed 6
eager 6
to 6

it 6

about 6

sat 6
down 6

wait 6
for 6
the 6

live 6
together 6
we 6
act 6
on 6

react 6
to 6

always 6
and 6
in 6
all 6

these 6

through 6

at 6
second 6
hand 6
incommunicable 6
we 6
can 6
pool 6

are 6
sufficiently 6
like 6

in 6
a 6
slightly 6
pickwickian 6
sense 6
in 6
their 6

in 6
certain 6
cases 6
communication 6
between 6

is 6
incomplete 6
or 6
even 6
nonexistent 6
the 6
mind 6
is 6
its 6

the 6
places 6
inhabited 6
by 6
the 6
insane 6
and 6
the 6
exceptionally 6
gifted 6
are 6
so 6
different 6
from 6
the 6
places 6
where 6
ordinary 6
men 6
and 6
women 6
live 6
that 6
there 6
is 6
little 6

no 6

is 6
the 6
capacity 6
to 6
see 6

what 6

a 6
different 6

a 6
radically 6
alien 6
universe 6
for 6
example 6
how 6
can 6
the 6
sane 6
get 6
to 6
know 6
what 6
it 6
actually 6
feels 6

to 6
blake 6

johann 6

were 6

how 6
can 6
a 6
man 6
at 6
the 6
extreme 6
limits 6
of 6
ectomorphy 6
and 6
cerebrotonia 6
ever 6
put 6
himself 6
in 6
the 6

of 6
one 6
at 6
the 6
limits 6

endomorphy 6

viscerotonia 6

except 6
within 6
certain 6

the 6
unmitigated 6

such 6
questions 6
i 6
suppose 6
are 6
meaningless 6

for 6
those 6
who 6
theoretically 6
believe 6
what 6

they 6
know 6

truenamely 6
that 6
there 6
is 6

it 6
seems 6
virtually 6
certain 6

never 6

else 6

change 6
my 6
ordinary 6

of 6
consciousness 6
as 6
to 6
be 6
able 6
to 6

the 6

what 6
the 6

even 6
the 6

were 6
talking 6
about 6

what 6
i 6
had 6
read 6
of 6
the 6
mescalin 6

i 6
was 6
convinced 6
in 6
advance 6
that 6
the 6

admit 6
me 6
at 6

what 6
i 6

expected 6
did 6
not 6

i 6

expected 6

and 6
a 6
half 6
miles 6
an 6
hour 6
but 6
such 6
images 6
have 6
little 6
substance 6
and 6
absolutely 6
no 6
autonomous 6
life 6
of 6
their 6
own 6
they 6
stand 6
to 6
real 6
perceived 6
objects 6
in 6
the 6
same 6
relation 6
as 6
homers 6
ghosts 6
stood 6
to 6
the 6
men 6
of 6
flesh 6

blood 6
who 6
came 6
to 6
visit 6
them 6
in 6
the 6
shades 6
only 6
when 6
i 6
have 6

my 6
mental 6
images 6
come 6

independent 6
life 6

those 6
in 6
whom 6
the 6
faculty 6
of 6
visualization 6
is 6
strong 6
my 6
inner 6
world 6
must 6
seem 6
curiously 6
drab 6
limited 6
and 6
uninteresting 6
this 6
was 6
the 6
worlda 6
poor 6
thing 6
but 6
my 6
ownwhich 6
i 6
expected 6
to 6
see 6
transformed 6
into 6
something 6
completely 6
unlike 6
itself 6
the 6
change 6
which 6
actually 6
took 6
place 6
in 6
that 6
world 6
was 6
in 6
no 6
sense 6
revolutionary 6
half 6
an 6
hour 6
after 6
swallowing 6
the 6
drug 6
i 6
became 6
aware 6
of 6
a 6
slow 6
dance 6
of 6
golden 6
lights 6
a 6
little 6
later 6
there 6
were 6
sumptuous 6
red 6
surfaces 6
swelling 6
and 6
expanding 6
from 6
bright 6
nodes 6
of 6
energy 6
that 6
vibrated 6
with 6
a 6
continuously 6
changing 6
patterned 6
life 6
at 6
another 6
time 6
the 6
closing 6
of 6
my 6
eyes 6
revealed 6
a 6
complex 6
of 6
gray 6
structures 6
within 6
which 6
pale 6
bluish 6
spheres 6
kept 6
emerging 6
into 6
intense 6
solidity 6
and 6
having 6
emerged 6
would 6
slide 6
noiselessly 6
upwards 6
out 6
of 6
sight 6
but 6
at 6
no 6
time 6
were 6
there 6
faces 6
or 6
forms 6
of 6
men 6
or 6
animals 6
i 6
saw 6
no 6

no 6
enormous 6
spaces 6
no 6
magical 6
growth 6
and 6
metamorphosis 6
of 6

nothing 6
remotely 6
like 6

a 6
parable 6
the 6
other 6
world 6

which 6

admitted 6
me 6

not 6

could 6

with 6
my 6

open 6
the 6
great 6

in 6
the 6

of 6
objective 6
fact 6
what 6
had 6
happened 6
to 6
my 6
subjective 6
universe 6
was 6
relatively 6
unimportant 6
i 6
took 6
my 6
pill 6
at 6
eleven 6
an 6
hour 6
and 6
a 6
half 6
later 6
i 6
was 6
sitting 6
in 6
my 6
study 6
looking 6
intently 6
at 6
a 6
small 6
glass 6

all 6
the 6
rules 6
of 6
traditional 6
good 6
taste 6
at 6
breakfast 6
that 6
morning 6
i 6
had 6
been 6
struck 6
by 6
the 6
lively 6
dissonance 6
of 6
its 6
colors 6
but 6
that 6
was 6
no 6
longer 6
the 6

was 6
not 6
looking 6
now 6
at 6
an 6
unusual 6
flower 6
arrangement 6
i 6
was 6
seeing 6
what 6

this 6

the 6

recorded 6
on 6

my 6
memory 6
of 6

shining 6
with 6
their 6

all 6
but 6
quivering 6
under 6
the 6

of 6
the 6

with 6
which 6
they 6
were 6
charged 6

that 6
what 6
rose 6

so 6
intensely 6
signified 6
was 6
nothing 6

was 6
at 6
the 6

being 6
a 6
bundle 6
of 6
minute 6
unique 6
particulars 6
in 6
which 6
by 6
some 6
unspeakable 6
and 6
yet 6
selfevident 6
paradox 6
was 6
to 6
be 6
seen 6
the 6
divine 6
source 6
of 6
all 6
existence 6
i 6
continued 6
to 6
look 6
at 6
the 6
flowers 6
and 6
in 6
their 6
living 6
light 6
i 6
seemed 6
to 6
detect 6
the 6
qualitative 6
equivalent 6

of 6
a 6

without 6

with 6
no 6

only 6
a 6

from 6

to 6
heightened 6
beauty 6
from 6
deeper 6
to 6
ever 6
deeper 6
meaning 6
words 6
like 6
grace 6

transfiguration 6
came 6
to 6
my 6
mind 6
and 6
this 6
of 6
course 6
was 6
what 6
among 6
other 6
things 6
they 6
stood 6
for 6
my 6
eyes 6
traveled 6
from 6
the 6
rose 6
to 6
the 6
carnation 6
and 6
from 6
that 6
feathery 6
incandescence 6
to 6

precisely 6

completely 6
what 6
those 6

then 6
i 6

i 6
read 6
it 6
only 6
a 6
vaguely 6
pregnant 6
piece 6
of 6

now 6

all 6

rather 6
odd 6

the 6

no 6

not 6
the 6

the 6
really 6
important 6
facts 6
were 6
that 6
spatial 6
relationships 6
had 6
ceased 6

matter 6
very 6
much 6
and 6
that 6
my 6

was 6
perceiving 6
the 6

i 6
saw 6

was 6
not 6
at 6
all 6
concerned 6
with 6
their 6
positions 6
in 6
space 6
what 6
i 6
noticed 6
what 6
impressed 6
itself 6
upon 6
my 6
mind 6
was 6
the 6
fact 6
that 6
all 6
of 6
them 6
glowed 6
with 6
living 6
light 6
and 6
that 6
in 6
some 6
the 6
glory 6
was 6
more 6
manifest 6
than 6
in 6
others 6
in 6
this 6
context 6
position 6
and 6
the 6
three 6
dimensions 6
were 6
beside 6
the 6
point 6
not 6
of 6
course 6
that 6
the 6
category 6
of 6
space 6
had 6
been 6
abolished 6
when 6
i 6
got 6
up 6
and 6
walked 6
about 6
i 6
could 6
do 6
so 6
quite 6
normally 6
without 6
misjudging 6
the 6
whereabouts 6
of 6
objects 6
space 6
was 6
still 6
there 6
but 6
it 6
had 6
lost 6
its 6
predominance 6
the 6
mind 6
was 6
primarily 6
concerned 6
not 6
with 6
measures 6
and 6
locations 6
but 6
with 6
being 6
and 6
meaning 6
and 6
along 6
with 6
indifference 6
to 6
space 6
there 6
went 6
an 6
even 6
more 6
complete 6
indifference 6
to 6
time 6
there 6
seems 6
to 6
be 6
plenty 6
of 6
it 6
was 6
all 6
i 6
would 6
answer 6
when 6
the 6
investigator 6
asked 6
me 6
to 6
say 6
what 6
i 6
felt 6
about 6
time 6
plenty 6
of 6
it 6
but 6
exactly 6
how 6
much 6
was 6
entirely 6
irrelevant 6
i 6
could 6
of 6
course 6
have 6
looked 6
at 6
my 6
watch 6
but 6
my 6
watch 6
i 6
knew 6
was 6
in 6
another 6

my 6
actual 6
experience 6

been 6
was 6
still 6

an 6
indefinite 6
duration 6

alternatively 6
of 6
a 6
perpetual 6

up 6
of 6
one 6
continually 6
changing 6
apocalypse 6

eminent 6
cambridge 6
philosopher 6
dr 6
c 6
d 6
broad 6
that 6
we 6

to 6
consider 6
much 6
more 6
seriously 6
than 6
we 6
have 6
hitherto 6
been 6
inclined 6
to 6
do 6
the 6
type 6
of 6
theory 6
which 6
bergson 6
put 6
forward 6
in 6
connection 6
with 6
memory 6
and 6
sense 6
perception 6
the 6
suggestion 6
is 6
that 6
the 6
function 6
of 6
the 6
brain 6
and 6
nervous 6
system 6
and 6
sense 6

is 6
in 6
the 6
main 6
eliminative 6

not 6
productive 6
each 6
person 6
is 6
at 6

capable 6
of 6
remembering 6
all 6
that 6
has 6
ever 6
happened 6
to 6
him 6

perceiving 6
everything 6
that 6

the 6
universe 6
the 6
function 6
of 6
the 6
brain 6
and 6
nervous 6
system 6
is 6
to 6
protect 6
us 6
from 6
being 6
overwhelmed 6
and 6
confused 6
by 6
this 6
mass 6
of 6
largely 6
useless 6
and 6
irrelevant 6
knowledge 6
by 6
shutting 6
out 6
most 6
of 6
what 6
we 6
should 6
otherwise 6
perceive 6
or 6
remember 6
at 6
any 6
moment 6
and 6
leaving 6
only 6
that 6
very 6
small 6
and 6
special 6
selection 6
which 6
is 6
likely 6
to 6
be 6
practically 6
useful 6
according 6
to 6
such 6
a 6
theory 6
each 6
one 6
of 6
us 6
is 6
potentially 6

what 6

a 6
measly 6
trickle 6
of 6
the 6

still 6
excludes 6
the 6

something 6
more 6

above 6
all 6
something 6
different 6
from 6
the 6
carefully 6

material 6
which 6
our 6
narrowed 6
individual 6

regard 6

at 6

the 6

thus 6
lowers 6

therefore 6
a 6

what 6

the 6

who 6
have 6
taken 6

be 6
summarized 6
as 6

the 6
ability 6

visual 6
impressions 6
are 6
greatly 6
intensified 6
and 6
the 6
eye 6
recovers 6
some 6
of 6
the 6
perceptual 6
innocence 6
of 6
childhood 6
when 6
the 6

no 6

anything 6

tried 6

was 6
a 6

the 6

proved 6

the 6

obviously 6
the 6

the 6

in 6
his 6

this 6

such 6

are 6
sources 6
of 6
true 6
knowledge 6
about 6
the 6
nature 6

and 6
this 6
true 6

may 6
serve 6
to 6
prepare 6
the 6

which 6
accepts 6
it 6

that 6

never 6

the 6

this 6
is 6
not 6
the 6
whole 6
story 6
draperies 6
as 6
i 6
had 6
now 6
discovered 6
are 6
much 6
more 6
than 6
devices 6

only 6
under 6
the 6
influence 6
of 6
mescalin 6
the 6
artist 6
is 6
congenitally 6
equipped 6
to 6
see 6
all 6
the 6
time 6
his 6
perception 6
is 6
not 6
limited 6
to 6
what 6
is 6
biologically 6
or 6
socially 6
useful 6
a 6
little 6
of 6
the 6
knowledge 6

to 6
mind 6

large 6
oozes 6
past 6
the 6
reducing 6
valve 6
of 6
brain 6
and 6
ego 6
into 6
his 6
consciousness 6
it 6
is 6
a 6
knowledge 6
of 6
the 6
intrinsic 6
significance 6
of 6
every 6
existent 6
for 6
the 6
artist 6
as 6
for 6
the 6
mescalin 6
taker 6
draperies 6
are 6
living 6
hieroglyphs 6
that 6
stand 6
in 6
some 6
peculiarly 6
expressive 6
way 6
for 6
the 6
unfathomable 6
mystery 6
of 6
pure 6
being 6
more 6
even 6
than 6
the 6
chair 6
though 6
less 6
perhaps 6
than 6
those 6
wholly 6
supernatural 6
flowers 6
the 6
folds 6
of 6
my 6
gray 6
flannel 6
trousers 6
were 6
charged 6
with 6
isness 6
to 6
what 6
they 6
owed 6
this 6
privileged 6
status 6
i 6
cannot 6
say 6
is 6
it 6
perhaps 6
because 6
the 6
forms 6
of 6
folded 6
drapery 6
are 6
so 6
strange 6
and 6
dramatic 6
that 6
they 6
catch 6
the 6
eye 6
and 6
in 6
this 6
way 6
force 6
the 6
miraculous 6
fact 6
of 6
sheer 6
existence 6
upon 6
the 6
attention 6
who 6
knows 6
what 6
is 6
important 6
is 6
less 6
the 6
reason 6
for 6
the 6
experience 6
than 6
the 6
experience 6
itself 6

in 6
the 6

that 6

not 6
botticelli 6
alone 6
but 6
many 6
others 6
toohad 6
looked 6
at 6
draperies 6
with 6
the 6
same 6
transfigured 6
and 6
transfiguring 6
eyes 6
as 6
had 6
been 6
mine 6
that 6
morning 6
they 6
had 6
seen 6
the 6

the 6
allness 6

infinity 6
of 6

done 6
their 6
best 6
to 6

to 6
another 6

beyond 6
the 6

to 6

but 6
in 6
judiths 6

i 6
could 6
clearly 6
see 6
what 6
if 6
i 6
had 6
been 6
a 6
painter 6
of 6
genius 6
i 6
might 6
have 6
made 6
of 6
my 6
old 6
gray 6
flannels 6
not 6
much 6
heaven 6
knows 6
in 6
comparison 6
with 6
the 6
reality 6
but 6
enough 6
to 6
delight 6
generation 6
after 6
generation 6
of 6
beholders 6
enough 6
to 6
make 6
them 6
understand 6
at 6
least 6
a 6
little 6
of 6
the 6
true 6
significance 6
of 6
what 6
in 6
our 6
pathetic 6
imbecility 6
we 6
call 6
mere 6
things 6
and 6
disregard 6
in 6
favor 6
of 6
television 6
this 6
is 6
how 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
see 6
i 6
kept 6
saying 6
as 6
i 6
looked 6
down 6
at 6
my 6
trousers 6
or 6
glanced 6
at 6
the 6
jeweled 6
books 6
in 6
the 6
shelves 6
at 6
the 6
legs 6
of 6
my 6
infinitely 6
more 6
than 6
vangoghian 6
chair 6
this 6
is 6
how 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
see 6
how 6
things 6
really 6
are 6
and 6
yet 6
there 6
were 6
reservations 6
for 6
if 6
one 6
always 6
saw 6
like 6
this 6
one 6
would 6
never 6
want 6
to 6
do 6
anything 6
else 6
just 6
looking 6
just 6
being 6
the 6
divine 6
notself 6
of 6
flower 6
of 6
book 6
of 6
chair 6
of 6
flannel 6
that 6
would 6
be 6
enough 6
but 6
in 6
that 6
case 6
what 6
about 6
other 6
people 6
what 6
about 6
human 6
relations 6
in 6
the 6
recording 6
of 6
that 6
mornings 6
conversations 6
i 6
find 6
the 6
question 6
constantly 6
repeated 6
what 6
about 6
human 6
relations 6
how 6
could 6
one 6
reconcile 6
this 6
timeless 6
bliss 6
of 6
seeing 6
as 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
see 6
with 6
the 6
temporal 6
duties 6
of 6
doing 6
what 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
do 6
and 6
feeling 6
as 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
feel 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
be 6
able 6
i 6
said 6
to 6
see 6
these 6
trousers 6
as 6
infinitely 6
important 6
and 6
human 6
beings 6
as 6
still 6
more 6
infinitely 6
important 6
one 6
oughtbut 6
in 6
practice 6
it 6
seemed 6
to 6
be 6
impossible 6
this 6
participation 6
in 6
the 6
manifest 6
glory 6
of 6
things 6
left 6
no 6
room 6
so 6
to 6
speak 6
for 6
the 6
ordinary 6
the 6
necessary 6
concerns 6
of 6
human 6
existence 6
above 6
all 6
for 6
concerns 6
involving 6
persons 6
for 6
persons 6
are 6
selves 6
and 6
in 6
one 6
respect 6
at 6
least 6
i 6
was 6
now 6
a 6
notself 6
simultaneously 6
perceiving 6
and 6
being 6
the 6
notself 6
of 6
the 6
things 6
around 6
me 6
to 6
this 6
newborn 6
notself 6
the 6
behavior 6
the 6
appearance 6
the 6
very 6
thought 6
of 6
the 6
self 6
it 6
had 6
momentarily 6
ceased 6
to 6
be 6
and 6
of 6
other 6
selves 6
its 6
onetime 6
fellows 6
seemed 6
not 6
indeed 6
distasteful 6
for 6
distastefulness 6
was 6
not 6
one 6
of 6
the 6
categories 6
in 6
terms 6
of 6
which 6
i 6
was 6
thinking 6
but 6
enormously 6
irrelevant 6
compelled 6
by 6
the 6
investigator 6
to 6
analyze 6
and 6
report 6
on 6
what 6
i 6
was 6
doing 6
and 6
how 6
i 6
longed 6
to 6
be 6
left 6
alone 6
with 6
eternity 6
in 6
a 6
flower 6
infinity 6
in 6
four 6
chair 6
legs 6
and 6
the 6
absolute 6
in 6
the 6
folds 6
of 6
a 6
pair 6
of 6
flannel 6
trousers 6
i 6
realized 6
that 6
i 6
was 6
deliberately 6
avoiding 6
the 6
eyes 6
of 6
those 6
who 6
were 6
with 6
me 6
in 6
the 6
room 6
deliberately 6
refraining 6
from 6
being 6
too 6
much 6
aware 6
of 6
them 6
one 6
was 6
my 6
wife 6
the 6
other 6
a 6
man 6
i 6
respected 6
and 6
greatly 6
liked 6
but 6
both 6
belonged 6
to 6
the 6
world 6
from 6
which 6
for 6
the 6
moment 6
mescalin 6
had 6
delivered 6
me 6
e 6
world 6
of 6
selves 6
of 6
time 6
of 6
moral 6
judgments 6
and 6
utilitarian 6
considerations 6
the 6
world 6
and 6
it 6
was 6
this 6
aspect 6
of 6
human 6
life 6
which 6
i 6
wished 6
above 6
all 6
else 6
to 6
forget 6
of 6
selfassertion 6
of 6
cocksureness 6
of 6
overvalued 6
words 6
and 6
idolatrously 6
worshipped 6
notions 6
at 6
this 6
stage 6
of 6
the 6
proceedings 6
i 6
was 6
handed 6
a 6
large 6
colored 6
reproduction 6
of 6
the 6
wellknown 6
selfportrait 6
by 6
czannethe 6
head 6
and 6
shoulders 6
of 6
a 6
man 6
in 6
a 6
large 6
straw 6
hat 6
redcheeked 6
redlipped 6
with 6
rich 6
black 6
whiskers 6
and 6
a 6
dark 6
unfriendly 6
eye 6
it 6
is 6
a 6
magnificent 6
painting 6
but 6
it 6
was 6
not 6
as 6
a 6
painting 6
that 6
i 6
now 6
saw 6
it 6
for 6
the 6
head 6
promptly 6
took 6
on 6
a 6
third 6
dimension 6
and 6
came 6
to 6
life 6
as 6
a 6
small 6
goblinlike 6
man 6
looking 6
out 6
through 6
a 6
window 6
in 6
the 6
page 6
before 6
me 6
i 6
started 6
to 6
laugh 6
and 6
when 6
they 6
asked 6
me 6
why 6
what 6
pretensions 6
i 6
kept 6
repeating 6
who 6
on 6
earth 6
does 6
he 6
think 6
he 6
is 6
the 6
question 6
was 6
not 6
addressed 6
to 6
czanne 6
in 6
particular 6
but 6
to 6
the 6
human 6
species 6
at 6
large 6
who 6
did 6
they 6
all 6
think 6
they 6
were 6
its 6
like 6
arnold 6
bennett 6
in 6
the 6
dolomites 6
i 6
said 6
suddenly 6
remembering 6
a 6
scene 6
happily 6
immortalized 6
in 6
a 6
snapshot 6
of 6
ab 6
some 6
four 6
or 6
five 6
years 6
before 6
his 6
death 6
toddling 6
along 6
a 6
wintry 6
road 6
at 6
cortina 6
dampezzo 6
around 6
him 6
lay 6
the 6
virgin 6
snow 6
in 6
the 6
background 6
was 6
a 6
more 6
than 6
gothic 6
aspiration 6
of 6
red 6
crags 6
and 6
there 6
was 6
dear 6
kind 6
unhappy 6
ab 6
consciously 6
overacting 6
the 6
role 6
of 6
his 6
favorite 6
character 6
in 6
fiction 6
himself 6
the 6
card 6
in 6
person 6
there 6
he 6
went 6
toddling 6
slowly 6
in 6
the 6
bright 6
alpine 6
sunshine 6
his 6
thumbs 6
in 6
the 6
armholes 6
of 6
a 6
yellow 6
waistcoat 6
which 6
bulged 6
a 6
little 6
lower 6
down 6
with 6
the 6
graceful 6
curve 6
of 6
a 6
regency 6
bow 6
window 6
at 6
brightenhis 6
head 6
thrown 6
back 6
as 6
though 6
to 6
aim 6
some 6
stammered 6
utterance 6
howitzerlike 6
at 6
the 6
blue 6
dome 6
of 6
heaven 6
what 6
he 6
actually 6
said 6
i 6
have 6
forgotten 6
but 6
what 6
his 6
whole 6
manner 6
air 6
and 6
posture 6
fairly 6
shouted 6
was 6
im 6
as 6
good 6
as 6
those 6
damned 6
mountains 6
and 6
in 6
some 6
ways 6
of 6
course 6
he 6
was 6
infinitely 6
better 6
but 6
not 6
as 6
he 6
knew 6
very 6
well 6
in 6
the 6
way 6
his 6
favorite 6
character 6
in 6
fiction 6
liked 6
to 6
imagine 6
successfully 6
whatever 6
that 6
may 6
mean 6
or 6
unsuccessfully 6
we 6
all 6
overact 6
the 6
part 6
of 6
our 6
favorite 6
character 6
in 6
fiction 6
and 6
the 6
fact 6
the 6
almost 6
infinitely 6
unlikely 6
fact 6
of 6
actually 6
being 6
czanne 6
makes 6
no 6
difference 6
for 6
the 6
consummate 6
painter 6
with 6
his 6
little 6
pipeline 6
to 6
mind 6
at 6
large 6
bypassing 6
the 6
brain 6
valve 6
and 6
egofilter 6
was 6
also 6
and 6
just 6
as 6
genuinely 6
this 6
whiskered 6
goblin 6
with 6
the 6
unfriendly 6
eye 6
for 6
relief 6
i 6
turned 6
back 6
to 6
the 6
folds 6
in 6
my 6
trousers 6
this 6
is 6
how 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
see 6
i 6
repeated 6
yet 6
again 6
and 6
i 6
might 6
have 6
added 6
these 6
are 6
the 6
sort 6
of 6
things 6
one 6
ought 6
to 6
look 6
at 6
things 6
without 6
pretensions 6
satisfied 6
to 6
be 6
merely 6
themselves 6
sufficient 6
in 6
their 6
suchness 6
not 6
acting 6
a 6
part 6
not 6
trying 6
insanely 6
to 6
go 6
it 6
alone 6
in 6
isolation 6
from 6
the 6
dharmabody 6
in 6
luciferian 6
defiance 6
of 6
the 6
grace 6
of 6
god 6
the 6
nearest 6
approach 6
to 6
this 6
i 6
said 6
would 6
be 6
a 6
vermeer 6
yes 6
a 6
vermeer 6
for 6
that 6
mysterious 6
artist 6
was 6
truly 6
giftedwith 6
the 6
vision 6
that 6
perceives 6
the 6
dharmabody 6
as 6
the 6
hedge 6
at 6
the 6
bottom 6
of 6
the 6
garden 6
with 6
the 6
talent 6
to 6
render 6
as 6
much 6
of 6
that 6
vision 6
as 6
the 6
limitations 6
of 6
human 6
capacity 6
permit 6
and 6
with 6
the 6
prudence 6

side 6

sumptuous 6

undoubtedly 6
the 6
greatest 6
painter 6
of 6

there 6
have 6
been 6
others 6

set 6
out 6
i 6
suppose 6
to 6
be 6
genre 6
painters 6
but 6
what 6
they 6
actually 6
produced 6
was 6
a 6
series 6
of 6
human 6
still 6
lives 6
in 6
which 6
their 6
cleansed 6
perception 6
of 6
the 6
infinite 6
significance 6
of 6
all 6
things 6
is 6
rendered 6
not 6
as 6
with 6
vermeer 6
by 6
subtle 6
enrichment 6
of 6
color 6
and 6
texture 6
but 6
by 6
a 6
heightened 6
clarity 6
an 6
obsessive 6
distinctness 6
of 6
form 6
within 6
an 6
austere 6
almost 6
monochromatic 6

so 6
far 6
as 6
i 6
was 6
concerned 6
with 6
an 6
unprecedented 6
poignancy 6
for 6
until 6
this 6
morning 6
i 6

only 6
in 6
its 6
humbler 6
its 6
more 6
ordinary 6

a 6
rapt 6
absorption 6

which 6
even 6
the 6

anything 6

occasional 6
glimpses 6
in 6

now 6
i 6
knew 6

at 6

me 6
add 6
before 6

there 6
is 6
no 6
form 6

less 6
than 6
fifty 6

six 6
of 6
those 6
words 6
are 6
devoted 6
to 6
asking 6
god 6
not 6
to 6
lead 6
us 6
into 6
temptation 6
the 6
onesided 6

undone 6

to 6
make 6
up 6

a 6

the 6

from 6
the 6
portrait 6
of 6

to 6
what 6
was 6
going 6
on 6
inside 6
my 6
head 6
when 6
i 6
shut 6
my 6
eyes 6
this 6
time 6
the 6
inscape 6
was 6
curiously 6
unrewarding 6
the 6
field 6
of 6
vision 6
was 6
filled 6
with 6
brightly 6
colored 6
constantly 6
changing 6
structures 6
that 6
seemed 6
to 6
be 6
made 6
of 6
plastic 6
or 6
enameled 6
tin 6
cheap 6
i 6
commented 6
trivial 6
like 6
things 6
in 6
a 6
fiveandten 6
and 6
all 6
this 6
shoddiness 6
existed 6
in 6
a 6
closed 6
cramped 6
universe 6

i 6
said 6
a 6

and 6
as 6
i 6
looked 6
it 6
became 6
very 6
clear 6
that 6
this 6
fiveandtencent 6
ship 6
was 6
in 6
some 6
way 6
connected 6
with 6
human 6
pretensions 6
with 6
the 6

overacting 6

this 6

interior 6
of 6
a 6

was 6
my 6
own 6
personal 6
self 6
these 6
gimcrack 6

were 6
my 6
personal 6
contributions 6
to 6
the 6
universe 6
i 6
felt 6
the 6
lesson 6
to 6
be 6
salutary 6
but 6
was 6
sorry 6
none 6
the 6
less 6
that 6
it 6
had 6
had 6
to 6
be 6
administered 6
at 6
this 6
moment 6
and 6
in 6
this 6
form 6
as 6
a 6
rule 6
the 6
mescalin 6
taker 6
discovers 6
an 6
inner 6
world 6
as 6
manifestly 6
a 6

as 6
selfevidently 6
infinite 6
and 6
holy 6
as 6
that 6
transfigured 6
outer 6
world 6
which 6
i 6
had 6
seen 6
with 6
my 6
eyes 6
open 6
from 6
the 6
first 6
my 6
own 6
case 6

with 6
the 6
power 6
to 6
see 6
things 6
with 6

it 6
could 6
not 6
or 6
at 6

on 6
this 6
occasion 6
did 6
not 6
reveal 6

quote 6
from 6

the 6
fact 6
that 6
these 6

were 6
some 6

all 6
containing 6

solely 6
in 6
his 6
ability 6

somewhat 6
less 6
successfully 6
in 6

beautiful 6
and 6
significant 6
than 6
the 6
world 6
beheld 6
by 6
blake 6
but 6
he 6
lacks 6
altogether 6
the 6
ability 6
to 6
express 6
in 6
literary 6
or 6
plastic 6
symbols 6
what 6
he 6
has 6
seen 6
from 6
the 6
records 6
of 6

and 6
the 6
surviving 6
monuments 6
of 6

the 6

it 6
is 6
very 6
plain 6
that 6
at 6
most 6
times 6
and 6
in 6
most 6
places 6
men 6
have 6
attached 6
more 6
importance 6
to 6
the 6
inscape 6
than 6
to 6
objective 6
existents 6
have 6
felt 6
that 6
what 6
they 6
saw 6
with 6
their 6
eyes 6
shut 6
possessed 6
a 6
spiritually 6
higher 6
significance 6
than 6
what 6
they 6
saw 6
with 6
their 6
eyes 6
open 6
the 6
reason 6
familiarity 6
breeds 6
contempt 6
and 6
how 6
to 6
survive 6
is 6
a 6
problem 6
ranging 6
in 6
urgency 6
from 6
the 6
chronically 6
tedious 6
to 6
the 6
excruciating 6
the 6
outer 6
world 6
is 6
what 6
we 6
wake 6
up 6
to 6
every 6
morning 6
of 6
our 6
lives 6
is 6
the 6
place 6
where 6
willynilly 6
we 6
must 6
try 6
to 6
make 6
our 6
living 6
in 6
the 6
inner 6
world 6
there 6
is 6
neither 6
work 6
nor 6
monotony 6
we 6
visit 6
it 6
only 6
in 6
dreams 6
and 6
musings 6
and 6
its 6
strangeness 6
is 6
such 6
that 6
we 6
never 6
find 6
the 6
same 6
world 6
on 6
two 6
successive 6
occasions 6
what 6
wonder 6
then 6
if 6
human 6
beings 6
in 6
their 6
search 6
for 6
the 6
divine 6
have 6
generally 6
preferred 6
to 6
look 6
within 6
generally 6
but 6
not 6
always 6
in 6
their 6
art 6
no 6
less 6
than 6
in 6
their 6
religion 6
the 6
taoists 6
and 6
the 6
zen 6
buddhists 6
looked 6
beyond 6
visions 6
to 6
the 6
void 6
and 6
through 6
the 6
void 6
at 6
the 6
ten 6
thousand 6
things 6
of 6
objective 6
reality 6
because 6
of 6
their 6
doctrine 6
of 6
the 6
word 6
made 6
flesh 6
christians 6
should 6
have 6
been 6
able 6
from 6
the 6
first 6
to 6
adopt 6
a 6
similar 6
attitude 6
towards 6
the 6
universe 6
around 6
them 6
but 6
because 6
of 6
the 6
doctrine 6
of 6
the 6
fall 6
they 6
found 6
it 6
very 6
hard 6
to 6
do 6
so 6
as 6
recently 6
as 6
three 6
hundred 6
years 6
ago 6
an 6
expression 6
of 6
thoroughgoing 6
world 6
denial 6
and 6
even 6
world 6
condemnation 6
was 6
both 6
orthodox 6
and 6
comprehensible 6
we 6
should 6
feel 6
wonder 6
at 6
nothing 6
at 6
all 6
in 6
nature 6
except 6
only 6
the 6
incarnation 6
of 6
christ 6
in 6
the 6
seventeenth 6
century 6
lallemants 6
phrase 6
seemed 6
to 6
make 6
sense 6
today 6
it 6
has 6
the 6
ring 6
of 6
madness 6
in 6
china 6
the 6
rise 6
of 6
landscape 6
painting 6
to 6
the 6
rank 6
of 6
a 6
major 6
art 6
form 6
took 6
place 6
about 6
a 6
thousand 6
in 6
japan 6
about 6
six 6
hundred 6
and 6
in 6
europe 6
about 6
three 6
hundred 6
years 6
ago 6
the 6
equation 6
of 6
dharmabody 6
with 6
hedge 6
was 6
made 6
by 6
those 6
zen 6
masters 6
who 6
wedded 6
taoist 6
naturalism 6
with 6
buddhist 6
transcendentalism 6
it 6
was 6
therefore 6
only 6
in 6
the 6
far 6
east 6
that 6
landscape 6
painters 6
consciously 6
regarded 6
their 6
art 6
as 6
religious 6
in 6
the 6
west 6
religious 6
painting 6
was 6
a 6
matter 6
of 6
portraying 6
sacred 6
personages 6
of 6
illustrating 6
hallowed 6
texts 6
landscape 6
painters 6
regarded 6
themselves 6
as 6
secularists 6
today 6
we 6
recognize 6
in 6
seurat 6
one 6
of 6
the 6
supreme 6
masters 6
of 6
what 6
may 6
be 6
called 6
mystical 6
landscape 6
painting 6
and 6
yet 6
this 6
man 6
who 6
was 6
able 6
more 6
effectively 6
than 6
any 6
other 6
to 6
render 6
the 6
one 6
in 6
the 6
many 6
became 6
quite 6
indignant 6
when 6
somebody 6
praised 6
him 6
for 6
the 6
poetry 6
of 6
his 6
work 6
i 6
merely 6
apply 6
the 6
system 6
he 6
protested 6
in 6
other 6
words 6
he 6
was 6
merely 6
a 6
pointilliste 6
and 6
in 6
his 6
own 6
eyes 6
nothing 6
else 6
a 6
similar 6
anecdote 6
is 6
told 6
of 6
john 6
constable 6
one 6
day 6
towards 6
the 6
end 6
of 6
his 6
life 6
blake 6
met 6
constable 6
at 6
hampstead 6
and 6
was 6
shown 6
one 6
of 6
the 6
younger 6
artists 6
sketches 6
in 6
spite 6
of 6
his 6
contempt 6
for 6
naturalistic 6
art 6
the 6
old 6
visionary 6
knew 6
a 6
good 6
thing 6
when 6
be 6
saw 6
itexcept 6
of 6
course 6
when 6
it 6
was 6
by 6
rubens 6

this 6

i 6
had 6
meant 6
it 6
to 6
be 6
drawing 6
was 6
constables 6
characteristic 6
answer 6
both 6
men 6
were 6
right 6
it 6
was 6
drawing 6
precise 6
and 6
veracious 6
and 6
at 6
the 6
same 6
time 6
it 6
was 6
inspirationinspiration 6
of 6
an 6
order 6
at 6
least 6
as 6
high 6
as 6
blakes 6
the 6
pine 6
trees 6
on 6
the 6
heath 6
had 6
actually 6
been 6
seen 6
as 6
identical 6
with 6
the 6
dharmabody 6
the 6
sketch 6
was 6
a 6
rendering 6
necessarily 6
imperfect 6
but 6
still 6
profoundly 6
impressive 6
of 6
what 6
a 6
cleansed 6
perception 6
had 6
revealed 6
to 6
the 6
open 6
eyes 6
of 6
a 6
great 6
painter 6
from 6
a 6
contemplation 6
in 6
the 6
tradition 6
of 6
wordsworth 6
and 6
whitman 6
of 6
the 6
dharmabody 6
as 6
hedge 6
and 6
from 6
visions 6
such 6
as 6
blakes 6
of 6
the 6
wonderful 6
originals 6
within 6
the 6
mind 6
contemporary 6
poets 6
have 6
retreated 6
into 6
an 6
investigation 6
of 6
the 6
personal 6
as 6
opposed 6
to 6
the 6
more 6
than 6
personal 6
subconscious 6
and 6
to 6
a 6
rendering 6
in 6
highly 6
abstract 6
terms 6
not 6
of 6
the 6
given 6
objective 6
fact 6
but 6
of 6
mere 6
scientific 6
and 6
theological 6
notions 6
and 6
something 6
similar 6
has 6
happened 6
in 6
the 6
held 6
of 6
painting 6
where 6
we 6
have 6
witnessed 6
a 6
general 6
retreat 6
from 6
landscape 6
the 6
predominant 6
art 6
form 6
of 6
the 6
nineteenth 6
century 6
this 6
retreat 6
from 6
landscape 6
has 6
not 6
been 6
into 6
that 6
other 6
inner 6
divine 6
datum 6
with 6
which 6
most 6
of 6
the 6
traditional 6
schools 6
of 6
the 6
past 6
were 6
concerned 6
that 6
archetypal 6
world 6
where 6
men 6
have 6
always 6
found 6
the 6
raw 6
materials 6
of 6
myth 6
and 6
religion 6
no 6
it 6
has 6
been 6
a 6
retreat 6
from 6
the 6
outward 6
datum 6
into 6
the 6
personal 6
subconscious 6
into 6
a 6
mental 6
world 6
more 6
squalid 6
and 6
more 6
tightly 6
closed 6
than 6
even 6
the 6
world 6
of 6
conscious 6
personality 6
these 6
contraptions 6
of 6
tin 6
and 6
highly 6
colored 6
plasticwhere 6
had 6
i 6
seen 6
them 6
before 6
in 6
every 6
picture 6
gallery 6
that 6
exhibits 6
the 6
latest 6
in 6
nonrepresentational 6
art 6
and 6
now 6
someone 6
produced 6
a 6
phonograph 6
and 6
put 6
a 6
record 6
on 6
the 6
turntable 6
i 6
listened 6
with 6
pleasure 6
but 6
experienced 6
nothing 6
comparable 6
to 6
my 6
seen 6
apocalypses 6
of 6
flowers 6
or 6
flannel 6
would 6
a 6
naturally 6
gifted 6
musician 6
hear 6
the 6
revelations 6
which 6
for 6
me 6
had 6
been 6
exclusively 6
visual 6
it 6
would 6
be 6
interesting 6
to 6
make 6
the 6
experiment 6

though 6
not 6
transfigured 6
though 6
retaining 6
its 6
normal 6
quality 6
and 6
intensity 6
the 6
music 6
contributed 6
not 6
a 6
little 6
to 6
my 6
understanding 6
of 6
what 6
had 6
happened 6
to 6
me 6
and 6
of 6
the 6
wider 6
problems 6
which 6
those 6
happenings 6

was 6
interrupted 6
after 6
the 6
first 6
movement 6
and 6
a 6
recording 6
of 6
some 6
madrigals 6
by 6
gesualdo 6
took 6
its 6
place 6
these 6
voices 6
i 6
said 6
appreciatively 6
these 6
voicestheyre 6
a 6
kind 6
of 6
bridge 6
back 6
to 6
the 6
human 6
world 6
and 6
a 6
bridge 6
they 6
remained 6
even 6
while 6
singing 6
the 6
most 6
startlingly 6
chromatic 6
of 6
the 6

uneven 6

of 6

pursued 6
its 6
course 6
never 6
sticking 6
to 6
the 6
same 6
key 6
for 6
two 6
bars 6
together 6
in 6
gesualdo 6
that 6
fantastic 6
character 6
out 6
of 6
a 6
webster 6
melodrama 6
psychological 6
disintegration 6
had 6
exaggerated 6
had 6
pushed 6
to 6
the 6
extreme 6
limit 6
a 6
tendency 6
inherent 6
in 6
modal 6
as 6
opposed 6
to 6
fully 6
tonal 6
music 6
the 6
resulting 6
works 6
sounded 6
as 6
though 6
they 6
might 6
have 6
been 6
written 6
by 6
the 6
later 6
schoenberg 6
and 6
yet 6
i 6
felt 6
myself 6
constrained 6
to 6
say 6
as 6
i 6
listened 6
to 6
these 6
strange 6
products 6
of 6
a 6
counterreformation 6
psychosis 6
working 6
upon 6
a 6
late 6
medieval 6
art 6
form 6
and 6
yet 6
it 6
does 6
not 6
matter 6
that 6
hes 6
all 6
in 6
bits 6
the 6
whole 6
is 6
disorganized 6
but 6
each 6
individual 6
fragment 6
is 6
in 6
order 6
is 6
a 6
representative 6
of 6
a 6
higher 6
order 6
the 6
highest 6
order 6
prevails 6
even 6
in 6
the 6
disintegration 6
the 6
totality 6
is 6
present 6
even 6
in 6
the 6
broken 6
pieces 6
more 6
clearly 6
present 6
perhaps 6
than 6
in 6
a 6
completely 6
coherent 6
work 6
at 6
least 6
you 6
arent 6
lulled 6
into 6
a 6
sense 6
of 6
false 6
security 6
by 6
some 6
merely 6
human 6
merely 6
fabricated 6
order 6
you 6
have 6
to 6
rely 6
on 6
your 6
immediate 6
perception 6
of 6
the 6
ultimate 6
order 6
so 6
in 6
a 6
certain 6
sense 6
disintegration 6
may 6
have 6
its 6
advantages 6
but 6
of 6
course 6
its 6
dangerous 6
horribly 6
dangerous 6
suppose 6
you 6
couldnt 6
get 6
back 6
out 6
of 6
the 6
chaos 6
from 6
gesualdos 6
madrigals 6
we 6
jumped 6
across 6
a 6
gulf 6
of 6
three 6
centuries 6
to 6
alban 6
berg 6
and 6
the 6
lyric 6
suite 6
this 6
i 6
announced 6
in 6
advance 6
is 6
going 6
to 6
be 6
hell 6
but 6
as 6
it 6
turned 6
out 6
i 6
was 6
wrong 6
actually 6
the 6
music 6
sounded 6
rather 6
funny 6
dredged 6
up 6
from 6
the 6
personal 6
subconscious 6
agony 6
succeeded 6
twelvetone 6
agony 6
but 6
what 6
struck 6
me 6
was 6
only 6
the 6
essential 6
incongruity 6
between 6
a 6
psychological 6
disintegration 6
even 6
completer 6
than 6
gesualdos 6
and 6
the 6
prodigious 6
resources 6
in 6
talent 6
and 6
technique 6
employed 6
in 6
its 6
expression 6
isnt 6

for 6
himself 6
i 6
commented 6
with 6
a 6
derisive 6
lack 6
of 6
sympathy 6
and 6
then 6

and 6
finally 6
after 6
a 6
few 6
more 6
minutes 6
of 6
the 6
anguish 6
who 6
cares 6
what 6
his 6
feelings 6
are 6
why 6
cant 6
he 6
pay 6
attention 6
to 6
something 6
else 6
as 6
a 6
criticism 6
of 6
what 6
is 6
undoubtedly 6
a 6
very 6
remarkable 6
work 6
it 6
was 6
unfair 6
and 6
inadequatebut 6
not 6
i 6
think 6
irrelevant 6
i 6
cite 6
it 6
for 6
what 6
it 6
is 6
worth 6
and 6
because 6
that 6
is 6
how 6
in 6
a 6
state 6
of 6
pure 6
contemplation 6
i 6
reacted 6
to 6
the 6
lyric 6
suite 6
when 6
it 6
was 6
over 6
the 6
investigator 6
suggested 6
a 6
walk 6
in 6
the 6
garden 6
i 6
was 6
willing 6
and 6
though 6
my 6
body 6
seemed 6
to 6
have 6
dissociated 6
itself 6
almost 6
completely 6
from 6
my 6
mindor 6
to 6
be 6
more 6
accurate 6
though 6
my 6
awareness 6
of 6
the 6
transfigured 6
outer 6
world 6
was 6
no 6
longer 6
accompanied 6
by 6
an 6
awareness 6
of 6
my 6
physical 6
organismi 6
found 6
myself 6
able 6
to 6
get 6
up 6
open 6
the 6
french 6
window 6
and 6
walk 6
out 6
with 6
only 6
a 6
minimum 6
of 6
hesitation 6
it 6
was 6
odd 6
of 6
course 6
to 6
feel 6
that 6
i 6
was 6
not 6
the 6
same 6
as 6
these 6
arms 6
and 6
legs 6
out 6
there 6
as 6
this 6
wholly 6
objective 6
trunk 6
and 6
neck 6
and 6
even 6
head 6
it 6
was 6
odd 6
but 6
one 6
soon 6
got 6
used 6
to 6
it 6
and 6
anyhow 6
the 6
body 6
seemed 6
perfectly 6
well 6
able 6
to 6
look 6
after 6
itself 6
in 6
reality 6
of 6
course 6
it 6
always 6
does 6
look 6
after 6
itself 6
all 6
that 6
the 6
conscious 6
ego 6
can 6
do 6
is 6
to 6
formulate 6
wishes 6
which 6
are 6
then 6
carried 6
out 6
by 6
forces 6
which 6
it 6
controls 6
very 6
little 6
and 6
understands 6
not 6
at 6
all 6
when 6
it 6
does 6
anything 6
morewhen 6
it 6
tries 6
too 6
hard 6
for 6
example 6
when 6
it 6
worries 6
when 6
it 6
becomes 6
apprehensive 6
about 6
the 6
futureit 6
lowers 6
the 6
effectiveness 6
of 6
those 6
forces 6
and 6
may 6
even 6
cause 6
the 6
devitalized 6
body 6
to 6
fall 6
ill 6
in 6
my 6
present 6
state 6
awareness 6
was 6
not 6
referred 6
to 6
as 6
ego 6
it 6
was 6
so 6
to 6
speak 6
on 6
its 6
own 6
this 6
meant 6
that 6
the 6
physiological 6
intelligence 6
controlling 6
the 6
body 6
was 6
also 6
on 6
its 6
own 6
for 6
the 6
moment 6
that 6
interfering 6
neurotic 6
who 6
in 6
waking 6
hours 6
tries 6
to 6
run 6
the 6
show 6
was 6
blessedly 6
out 6
of 6
the 6
way 6
from 6
the 6
french 6
window 6
i 6
walked 6
out 6
under 6
a 6
kind 6
of 6
pergola 6
covered 6
in 6
part 6
by 6
a 6
climbing 6
rose 6
tree 6
in 6
part 6
by 6
laths 6
one 6
inch 6
wide 6
with 6
half 6
an 6
inch 6
of 6
space 6
between 6
them 6
the 6
sun 6
was 6
shining 6
and 6
the 6
shadows 6
of 6
the 6
laths 6
made 6
a 6
zebralike 6
pattern 6
on 6
the 6
ground 6
and 6
across 6
the 6
seat 6
and 6
back 6
of 6
a 6
garden 6
chair 6
which 6
was 6
standing 6
at 6
this 6
end 6
of 6
the 6
pergola 6
that 6
chairshall 6
i 6
ever 6
forget 6
it 6
where 6
the 6
shadows 6
fell 6
on 6
the 6
canvas 6
upholstery 6
stripes 6
of 6
a 6
deep 6
but 6
glowing 6
indigo 6
alternated 6
with 6
stripes 6
of 6
an 6
incandescence 6
so 6
intensely 6
bright 6
that 6
it 6
was 6
hard 6
to 6
believe 6
that 6
they 6
could 6
be 6
made 6
of 6
anything 6
but 6
blue 6
fire 6
for 6
what 6
seemed 6
an 6
immensely 6
long 6
time 6
i 6
gazed 6
without 6
knowing 6
even 6
without 6
wishing 6
to 6
know 6
what 6
it 6
was 6
that 6
confronted 6
me 6
at 6
any 6
other 6
time 6
i 6
would 6
have 6
seen 6
a 6
chair 6
barred 6
with 6
alternate 6
light 6
and 6
shade 6
today 6
the 6
percept 6
had 6
swallowed 6
up 6
the 6
concept 6
i 6
was 6
so 6
completely 6
absorbed 6
in 6
looking 6
so 6
thunderstruck 6
by 6
what 6
i 6
actually 6
saw 6
that 6
i 6
could 6
not 6
be 6
aware 6
of 6
anything 6
else 6
garden 6
furniture 6
laths 6
sunlight 6
shadowthese 6
were 6
no 6
more 6
than 6
names 6
and 6
notions 6
mere 6
verbalizations 6
for 6
utilitarian 6
or 6
scientific 6
purposes 6
after 6
the 6
event 6
the 6
event 6
was 6
this 6
succession 6
of 6
azure 6
furnace 6
doors 6
separated 6
by 6
gulfs 6
of 6
unfathomable 6
gentian 6
it 6
was 6
inexpressibly 6
wonderful 6
wonderful 6
to 6
the 6
point 6
almost 6
of 6
being 6
terrifying 6
and 6
suddenly 6
i 6
had 6
an 6
inkling 6
of 6
what 6
it 6
must 6
feel 6
like 6
to 6
be 6
mad 6
schizophrenia 6
has 6
its 6
heavens 6
as 6
well 6
as 6
its 6
hells 6
and 6
purgatories 6
i 6
remember 6
what 6
an 6
old 6
friend 6
dead 6
these 6
many 6
years 6
told 6
me 6
about 6
his 6
mad 6
wife 6
one 6
day 6
in 6
the 6
early 6
stages 6
of 6
the 6
disease 6
when 6
she 6
still 6
had 6
her 6
lucid 6
intervals 6
he 6
had 6
gone 6
to 6
talk 6
to 6
her 6
about 6
their 6
children 6
she 6
listened 6
for 6
a 6
time 6
then 6
cut 6
him 6
short 6
how 6
could 6
he 6
bear 6
to 6
waste 6
his 6
time 6
on 6
a 6
couple 6
of 6
absent 6
children 6
when 6
all 6
that 6
really 6
mattered 6
here 6
and 6
now 6
was 6
the 6
unspeakable 6
beauty 6
of 6
the 6
patterns 6
he 6
made 6
in 6
this 6
brown 6
tweed 6
jacket 6
every 6
time 6
he 6
moved 6
his 6
arms 6
alas 6
this 6
paradise 6
of 6
cleansed 6
perception 6
of 6
pure 6
onesided 6
contemplation 6
was 6
not 6
to 6
endure 6
the 6
blissful 6
intermissions 6
became 6
rarer 6
became 6
briefer 6
until 6
finally 6
there 6
were 6
no 6
more 6
of 6
them 6
there 6
was 6
only 6
horror 6
most 6
takers 6
of 6
mescalin 6
experience 6
only 6
the 6
heavenly 6
part 6
of 6
schizophrenia 6
the 6
drug 6
brings 6
hell 6
and 6
purgatory 6
only 6
to 6
those 6
who 6
have 6
had 6
a 6
recent 6
case 6
of 6
jaundice 6
or 6
who 6
suffer 6
from 6
periodical 6
depressions 6
or 6
a 6
chronic 6
anxiety 6
if 6
like 6
the 6
other 6
drugs 6
of 6
remotely 6
comparable 6
power 6
mescalin 6
were 6
notoriously 6
toxic 6
the 6
taking 6
of 6
it 6
would 6
be 6
enough 6
of 6
itself 6
to 6
cause 6
anxiety 6
but 6
the 6
reasonably 6
healthy 6
person 6
knows 6
in 6
advance 6
that 6
so 6
far 6
as 6
he 6
is 6
concerned 6
mescalin 6
is 6
completely 6
innocuous 6
that 6
its 6
effects 6
will 6
pass 6
off 6
after 6
eight 6
or 6
ten 6
hours 6
leaving 6
no 6
hangover 6
and 6
consequently 6
no 6
craving 6
for 6
a 6
renewal 6
of 6
the 6
dose 6
fortified 6
by 6
this 6
knowledge 6
he 6
embarks 6
upon 6
the 6
experiment 6
without 6
fearin 6
other 6
words 6
without 6
any 6
disposition 6
to 6
convert 6
an 6
unprecedentedly 6
strange 6
and 6
other 6
than 6
human 6
experience 6
into 6
something 6
appalling 6
something 6
actually 6
diabolical 6
confronted 6
by 6
a 6
chair 6
which 6
looked 6
like 6
the 6
last 6
judgmentor 6
to 6
be 6
more 6
accurate 6
by 6
a 6
last 6
judgment 6
which 6
after 6
a 6
long 6
time 6
and 6
with 6
considerable 6
difficulty 6
i 6
recognized 6
as 6
a 6
chairi 6
found 6
myself 6
all 6
at 6
once 6
on 6
the 6
brink 6
of 6
panic 6
this 6
i 6
suddenly 6
felt 6
was 6
going 6
too 6
far 6
too 6
far 6
even 6
though 6
the 6
going 6
was 6
into 6
intenser 6
beauty 6
deeper 6
significance 6
the 6
fear 6
as 6
i 6
analyze 6
it 6
in 6
retrospect 6
was 6
of 6
being 6
overwhelmed 6
of 6
disintegrating 6
under 6
a 6
pressure 6
of 6
reality 6
greater 6
than 6
a 6
mind 6
accustomed 6
to 6
living 6
most 6
of 6
the 6
time 6
in 6
a 6
cosy 6
world 6
of 6
symbols 6
could 6
possibly 6
bear 6
the 6
literature 6
of 6
religious 6
experience 6
abounds 6
in 6
references 6
to 6
the 6
pains 6
and 6
terrors 6
overwhelming 6
those 6
who 6
have 6
come 6
too 6
suddenly 6
face 6
to 6
face 6
with 6
some 6
manifestation 6
of 6
the 6
mysterium 6
tremendum 6
in 6
theological 6

by 6

souls 6
the 6

light 6
at 6

fire 6
an 6
almost 6
identical 6
doctrine 6
is 6
to 6
be 6
found 6
in 6
the 6
tibetan 6
book 6
of 6
the 6
dead 6
where 6
the 6
departed 6
soul 6
is 6
described 6
as 6
shrinking 6
in 6
agony 6
from 6
the 6
pure 6
light 6
of 6
the 6
void 6
and 6
even 6
from 6
the 6
lesser 6

rush 6
headlong 6
into 6
the 6
comforting 6
darkness 6
of 6
selfhood 6
as 6
a 6
reborn 6

even 6
as 6

anything 6

than 6
the 6
burning 6
brightness 6
of 6
unmitigated 6
realityanything 6
the 6
schizophrenic 6
is 6
a 6
soul 6
not 6
merely 6
unregenerate 6
but 6
desperately 6
sick 6
into 6
the 6
bargain 6
his 6
sickness 6
consists 6
in 6
the 6
inability 6
to 6
take 6
refuge 6
from 6
inner 6
and 6
outer 6
reality 6
as 6
the 6
sane 6
person 6
habitually 6
does 6
in 6
the 6
homemade 6
universe 6
of 6
common 6

human 6
world 6
of 6
useful 6
notions 6
shared 6
symbols 6
and 6
socially 6
acceptable 6
conventions 6
the 6
schizophrenic 6
is 6
like 6
a 6
man 6
permanently 6
under 6
the 6
influence 6
of 6
mescalin 6
and 6
therefore 6
unable 6
to 6
shut 6
off 6
the 6
experience 6
of 6
a 6
reality 6
which 6
he 6
is 6
not 6
holy 6
enough 6
to 6
live 6
with 6
which 6
he 6
cannot 6
explain 6
away 6
because 6
it 6
is 6
the 6
most 6
stubborn 6
of 6
primary 6
facts 6
and 6
which 6
because 6
it 6
never 6
permits 6
him 6
to 6
look 6
at 6
the 6
world 6
with 6
merely 6
human 6
eyes 6
scares 6
him 6
into 6
interpreting 6
its 6
unremitting 6
strangeness 6
its 6
burning 6
intensity 6
of 6
significance 6
as 6
the 6
manifestations 6

infernal 6
road 6
one 6
would 6
never 6
be 6
able 6
to 6
stop 6
that 6
now 6
was 6
only 6
too 6
obvious 6
if 6
you 6
started 6
in 6
the 6
wrong 6
way 6
i 6
said 6
in 6
answer 6
to 6
the 6
investigators 6
questions 6
everything 6
that 6
happened 6
would 6
be 6
a 6
proof 6
of 6
the 6
conspiracy 6
against 6
you 6
it 6
would 6
all 6
be 6
selfvalidating 6
you 6
couldnt 6
draw 6
a 6
breath 6
without 6
knowing 6
it 6
was 6
part 6
of 6
the 6
plot 6
so 6
you 6
think 6
you 6
know 6
where 6
madness 6
lies 6
my 6
answer 6
was 6
a 6
convinced 6
and 6
heartfelt 6
yes 6
and 6
you 6
couldnt 6
control 6
it 6
no 6
i 6
couldnt 6
control 6
it 6
if 6
one 6
began 6
with 6
fear 6
and 6
hate 6
as 6
the 6
major 6
premise 6
one 6
would 6
have 6
to 6
go 6
on 6
to 6
the 6
conclusion 6
would 6
you 6
be 6
able 6
my 6
wife 6
asked 6
to 6
fix 6
your 6
attention 6
on 6
what 6
the 6
tibetan 6
book 6
of 6
the 6
dead 6
calls 6
the 6
clear 6
light 6
i 6
was 6
doubtful 6
would 6
it 6
keep 6
the 6
evil 6
away 6
if 6
you 6
could 6
hold 6
it 6
or 6
would 6
you 6
not 6
be 6
able 6
to 6
hold 6
it 6
i 6
considered 6
the 6
question 6
for 6
some 6
time 6
perhaps 6
i 6
answered 6
at 6
last 6
perhaps 6
i 6
couldbut 6
only 6
if 6
there 6
were 6
somebody 6
there 6
to 6
tell 6
me 6
about 6
the 6
clear 6
light 6
one 6
couldnt 6
do 6
it 6
by 6
oneself 6
thats 6
the 6
point 6
i 6
suppose 6
of 6
the 6

sitting 6
there 6
all 6
the 6

to 6

this 6

all 6

all 6
the 6
bewilderment 6

confusion 6
the 6
ultimate 6
reality 6
remains 6
unshakably 6
itself 6

is 6
of 6
the 6
same 6
substance 6
as 6

the 6
inmates 6

even 6
an 6
understaffed 6

reminded 6

away 6
from 6
the 6

my 6

drooping 6
in 6
green 6
parabolas 6
from 6
the 6
hedge 6
the 6
ivy 6
fronds 6
shone 6
with 6
a 6
kind 6
of 6
glassy 6
jadelike 6
radiance 6
a 6
moment 6
later 6
a 6
clump 6
of 6
red 6
hot 6
pokers 6
in 6
full 6
bloom 6
had 6
exploded 6
into 6
my 6
field 6
of 6
vision 6
so 6
passionately 6
alive 6
that 6
they 6
seemed 6
to 6
be 6
standing 6
on 6
the 6
very 6
brink 6
of 6
utterance 6
the 6
flowers 6
strained 6
upwards 6
into 6
the 6
blue 6
like 6
the 6
chair 6
under 6
the 6
laths 6
they 6
protected 6
too 6
much 6
i 6
looked 6
down 6
at 6
the 6
leaves 6
and 6
discovered 6
a 6
cavernous 6
intricacy 6
of 6
the 6
most 6
delicate 6
green 6
lights 6
and 6
shadows 6
pulsing 6
with 6
undecipherable 6
mystery 6
roses 6
the 6
flowers 6
are 6
easy 6

exactly 6
what 6
i 6
then 6
feltthe 6
excessive 6
the 6
too 6
obvious 6
glory 6
of 6
the 6
flowers 6
as 6
contrasted 6
with 6
the 6
subtler 6
miracle 6
of 6
their 6
foliage 6
we 6
walked 6
out 6
into 6
the 6
street 6
a 6
large 6
pale 6
blue 6
automobile 6
was 6
standing 6
at 6
the 6
curb 6
at 6
the 6
sight 6
of 6
it 6
i 6
was 6
suddenly 6
overcome 6
by 6
enormous 6
merriment 6
what 6
complacency 6
what 6
an 6
absurd 6
selfsatisfaction 6
beamed 6
from 6
those 6
bulging 6
surfaces 6
of 6
glossiest 6
enamel 6
man 6
had 6
created 6
the 6
thing 6
in 6
his 6
own 6
imageor 6
rather 6
in 6
the 6
image 6
of 6
his 6
favorite 6
character 6
in 6
fiction 6
i 6
laughed 6
till 6
the 6
tears 6
ran 6
down 6
my 6
cheeks 6
we 6
reentered 6
the 6
house 6
a 6
meal 6
had 6
been 6
prepared 6
somebody 6
who 6
was 6
not 6
yet 6
identical 6
with 6
myself 6
fell 6
to 6
with 6
ravenous 6
appetite 6
from 6
a 6
considerable 6
distance 6
and 6
without 6
much 6
interest 6
i 6
looked 6
on 6
when 6
the 6
meal 6
had 6
been 6
eaten 6
we 6
got 6
into 6
the 6
car 6
and 6
went 6
for 6
a 6
drive 6
the 6
effects 6
of 6
the 6
mescalin 6
were 6
already 6
on 6
the 6
decline 6
but 6
the 6
flowers 6
in 6
the 6
gardens 6
still 6
trembled 6
on 6
the 6
brink 6
of 6
being 6
supernatural 6
the 6
pepper 6
trees 6
and 6
carobs 6
along 6
the 6
side 6
streets 6
still 6
manifestly 6
belonged 6
to 6
some 6
sacred 6
grove 6
eden 6
alternated 6
with 6
dodona 6
yggdrasil 6
with 6
the 6
mystic 6
rose 6
and 6
then 6
abruptly 6
we 6
were 6
at 6
an 6
intersection 6
waiting 6
to 6
cross 6
sunset 6
boulevard 6
before 6
us 6
the 6
cars 6
were 6
rolling 6
by 6
in 6
a 6
steady 6
streamthousands 6
of 6
them 6
all 6
bright 6
and 6
shiny 6
like 6
an 6
advertisers 6
dream 6
and 6
each 6
more 6
ludicrous 6
than 6
the 6
last 6
once 6
again 6
i 6
was 6
convulsed 6
with 6
laughter 6
the 6
red 6
sea 6
of 6
traffic 6
parted 6
at 6
last 6
and 6
we 6
crossed 6
into 6
another 6
oasis 6
of 6
trees 6
and 6
lawns 6
and 6
roses 6
in 6
a 6
few 6
minutes 6
we 6
had 6
climbed 6
to 6
a 6
vantage 6
point 6
in 6
the 6
hills 6
and 6
there 6
was 6
the 6
city 6
spread 6
out 6
beneath 6
us 6
rather 6
disappointingly 6
it 6
looked 6
very 6
like 6
the 6
city 6
i 6
had 6
seen 6
on 6
other 6
occasions 6
so 6
far 6
as 6
i 6
was 6
concerned 6
transfiguration 6
was 6
proportional 6
to 6
distance 6
the 6
nearer 6
the 6
more 6
divinely 6
other 6
this 6
vast 6
dim 6
panorama 6
was 6
hardly 6
different 6
from 6
itself 6
we 6
drove 6
on 6
and 6
so 6
long 6
as 6
we 6
remained 6
in 6
the 6
hills 6
with 6
view 6
succeeding 6
distant 6
view 6
significance 6
was 6
at 6
its 6
everyday 6
level 6
well 6
below 6
transfiguration 6
point 6
the 6
magic 6
began 6
to 6
work 6
again 6
only 6
when 6
we 6
turned 6
down 6
into 6
a 6
new 6
suburb 6
and 6
were 6
gliding 6
between 6
two 6
rows 6
of 6
houses 6
here 6
in 6
spite 6
of 6
the 6
peculiar 6
hideousness 6
of 6
the 6
architecture 6
there 6
were 6
renewals 6
of 6
transcendental 6
otherness 6
hints 6
of 6
the 6
mornings 6
heaven 6
brick 6
chimneys 6
and 6
green 6
composition 6
roofs 6
glowed 6
in 6
the 6
sunshine 6
like 6
fragments 6
of 6
the 6
new 6
jerusalem 6
and 6
all 6
at 6
once 6
i 6
saw 6
what 6
guardi 6
had 6
seen 6
and 6
with 6
what 6
incomparable 6
skill 6
had 6
so 6
often 6
rendered 6
in 6
his 6
paintingsa 6
stucco 6
wall 6
with 6
a 6
shadow 6
slanting 6
across 6
it 6
blank 6
but 6
unforgettably 6
beautiful 6
empty 6
but 6
charged 6
with 6
all 6
the 6
meaning 6
and 6
the 6
mystery 6
of 6
existence 6
the 6
revelation 6
dawned 6
and 6
was 6
gone 6
again 6
within 6
a 6
fraction 6
of 6
a 6
second 6
the 6
car 6
had 6
moved 6
on 6
time 6
was 6
uncovering 6
another 6
manifestation 6
of 6
the 6
eternal 6
suchness 6
within 6
sameness 6
there 6
is 6
difference 6
but 6
that 6
difference 6
should 6
be 6

not 6

the 6

strong 6
only 6

during 6
which 6
their 6

equally 6
unsurprising 6
is 6
the 6
current 6
attitude 6
towards 6

of 6
the 6
evidence 6
linking 6

practically 6
everybody 6
regards 6
tobacco 6

as 6
being 6
hardly 6
less 6
normal 6

this 6
may 6
seem 6
odd 6
for 6
the 6

it 6
is 6
exactly 6
what 6
you 6
would 6
expect 6
a 6
firm 6
conviction 6
of 6
the 6
material 6
reality 6
of 6

never 6
prevented 6
medieval 6

their 6

covetousness 6
suggested 6

and 6
the 6
millions 6
of 6

are 6
facts 6
even 6
more 6
certain 6
than 6
was 6
in 6
dantes 6
day 6
the 6
fact 6
of 6
the 6
inferno 6
but 6
all 6
such 6
facts 6
are 6
remote 6
and 6
unsubstantial 6
compared 6
with 6
the 6
near 6
felt 6
fact 6
of 6
a 6
craving 6
here 6

now 6
for 6

of 6
the 6

of 6

population 6
alcohol 6
is 6
incompatible 6
with 6
safety 6
on 6
the 6
roads 6
and 6
its 6
production 6
like 6
that 6
of 6

condemns 6
to 6
virtual 6
sterility 6
many 6
millions 6
of 6
acres 6
of 6
the 6
most 6

the 6

cannot 6
it 6
goes 6
without 6

by 6
prohibition 6
the 6
universal 6
and 6
everpresent 6
urge 6
to 6
selftranscendence 6
is 6
not 6
to 6
be 6
abolished 6
by 6
slamming 6
the 6
currently 6
popular 6
doors 6
in 6
the 6
wall 6
the 6
only 6
reasonable 6
policy 6
is 6
to 6
open 6
other 6
better 6
doors 6
in 6
the 6
hope 6
of 6
inducing 6
men 6
and 6
women 6
to 6
exchange 6
their 6
old 6
bad 6
habits 6
for 6
new 6
and 6
less 6
harmful 6
ones 6
some 6
of 6
these 6
other 6
better 6

will 6
be 6
social 6

technological 6
in 6
nature 6
others 6
religious 6
or 6
psychological 6
others 6
dietetic 6
educational 6
athletic 6
but 6
the 6
need 6
for 6
frequent 6
chemical 6
vacations 6
from 6
intolerable 6
selfhood 6
and 6
repulsive 6
surroundings 6
will 6
undoubtedly 6
remain 6
what 6
is 6
needed 6
is 6
a 6
new 6
drug 6
which 6
will 6
relieve 6
and 6
console 6
our 6
suffering 6
species 6
without 6
doing 6
more 6
harm 6
in 6
the 6
long 6
run 6
than 6
it 6
does 6
good 6
in 6
the 6
short 6
such 6
a 6
drug 6
must 6
be 6
potent 6
in 6
minute 6
doses 6
and 6
synthesizable 6
if 6
it 6
does 6
not 6
possess 6
these 6
qualities 6
its 6
production 6
like 6
that 6
of 6
wine 6
beer 6
spirits 6
and 6
tobacco 6
will 6
interfere 6
with 6
the 6
raising 6
of 6
indispensable 6
food 6
and 6
fibers 6
it 6
must 6
be 6
less 6
toxic 6
than 6
opium 6
or 6
cocaine 6
less 6
likely 6
to 6
produce 6
undesirable 6
social 6
consequences 6
than 6
alcohol 6
or 6
the 6
barbiturates 6
less 6
inimical 6
to 6
heart 6
and 6
lungs 6
than 6
the 6
tars 6
and 6
nicotine 6
of 6
cigarettes 6
and 6
on 6
the 6
positive 6
side 6
it 6
should 6
produce 6
changes 6
in 6
consciousness 6
more 6
interesting 6
more 6
intrinsically 6
valuable 6
than 6
mere 6
sedation 6
or 6
dreaminess 6
delusions 6
of 6
omnipotence 6
or 6
release 6
from 6
inhibition 6
to 6
most 6
people 6
mescalin 6
is 6
almost 6
completely 6
innocuous 6
unlike 6
alcohol 6
it 6
does 6
not 6
drive 6
the 6
taker 6
into 6
the 6
kind 6
of 6
uninhibited 6
action 6
which 6
results 6
in 6
brawls 6
crimes 6
of 6
violence 6
and 6
traffic 6
accidents 6
a 6
man 6
under 6
the 6
influence 6
of 6
mescalin 6
quietly 6
minds 6
his 6
own 6
business 6
moreover 6
the 6
business 6
he 6
minds 6
is 6
an 6
experience 6
of 6
the 6
most 6
enlightening 6
kind 6
which 6
does 6
not 6
have 6
to 6
be 6
paid 6
for 6
and 6
this 6
is 6
surely 6
important 6
by 6
a 6
compensatory 6
hangover 6
of 6
the 6
longrange 6
consequences 6
of 6
regular 6
mescalin 6
taking 6
we 6
know 6
very 6
little 6
the 6
indians 6
who 6
consume 6
peyote 6
buttons 6
do 6
not 6
seem 6
to 6
be 6
physically 6
or 6
morally 6
degraded 6
by 6
the 6
habit 6
however 6
the 6
available 6
evidence 6
is 6
still 6
scarce 6
and 6
sketchy 6
although 6
obviously 6
superior 6
to 6
cocaine 6
opium 6
alcohol 6
and 6
tobacco 6
mescalin 6
is 6
not 6
yet 6
the 6
ideal 6
drug 6
along 6
with 6
the 6
happily 6
transfigured 6
majority 6
of 6
mescalin 6
takers 6
there 6
is 6
a 6
minority 6
that 6
finds 6
in 6
the 6
drug 6
only 6
hell 6
or 6
purgatory 6
moreover 6
for 6
a 6
drug 6
that 6
is 6
to 6
be 6
used 6
like 6
alcohol 6
for 6
general 6
consumption 6
its 6
effects 6
last 6
for 6
an 6
inconveniently 6
long 6
time 6
but 6
chemistry 6
and 6
physiology 6
are 6
capable 6
nowadays 6
of 6
practically 6
anything 6
if 6
the 6
psychologists 6
and 6
sociologists 6
will 6
define 6
the 6
ideal 6
the 6
neurologists 6
and 6
pharmacologists 6
can 6
be 6
relied 6
upon 6
to 6
discover 6
the 6
means 6
whereby 6
that 6
ideal 6
can 6
be 6
realized 6
or 6
at 6
least 6
for 6
perhaps 6
this 6
kind 6
of 6
ideal 6
can 6
never 6
in 6
the 6

be 6
observed 6
in 6
every 6

primitives 6
no 6

who 6
have 6
reached 6
a 6
high 6
pitch 6
of 6
civilization 6
we 6
are 6
therefore 6
dealing 6
not 6
with 6
exceptional 6
facts 6
which 6
might 6
justifiably 6
be 6
overlooked 6

with 6

general 6

in 6

widest 6
sense 6
of 6
the 6
word 6
a 6
human 6
phenomenon 6
the 6
kind 6
of 6
phenomenon 6
which 6
cannot 6
be 6
disregarded 6
by 6
anyone 6
who 6
is 6
trying 6
to 6
discover 6
what 6
religion 6
is 6
and 6
what 6
are 6
the 6
deep 6
needs 6
which 6
it 6
must 6
satisfy 6
ideally 6
everyone 6
should 6
be 6
able 6

find 6
selftranscendence 6
in 6
some 6
form 6
of 6
pure 6
or 6
applied 6
religion 6
in 6
practice 6
it 6
seems 6
very 6
unlikely 6
that 6
this 6
hoped 6
for 6
consummation 6
will 6
ever 6
be 6
realized 6
there 6
are 6

doubtless 6
there 6
always 6
will 6
be 6
good 6

good 6

unfortunately 6

even 6
the 6
most 6
tolerant 6
have 6
made 6
no 6
attempt 6
to 6
convert 6

to 6
christianity 6
or 6
to 6
sacramentalize 6
its 6

pious 6
drinker 6

take 6
his 6
religion 6
in 6

religionsurrogate 6
in 6
another 6
and 6
perhaps 6
this 6
is 6
inevitable 6
drinking 6
cannot 6
be 6
sacramentalized 6
except 6
in 6
religions 6

set 6
no 6

on 6

the 6
worship 6

dionysos 6

was 6
a 6
loud 6

disorderly 6
affair 6
the 6
rites 6
of 6
christianity 6
are 6
incompatible 6

even 6
religious 6
drunkenness 6
this 6
does 6
no 6
harm 6
to 6
the 6
distillers 6
but 6
is 6
very 6
bad 6
for 6
christianity 6
countless 6
persons 6
desire 6
selftranscendence 6
and 6
would 6
be 6
glad 6
to 6
find 6
it 6
in 6

but 6
alas 6
the 6
hungry 6
sheep 6
look 6
up 6
and 6
are 6
not 6
fed 6
they 6
take 6
part 6
in 6
rites 6
they 6
listen 6
to 6
sermons 6
they 6
repeat 6
prayers 6
but 6
their 6
thirst 6
remains 6
unassuaged 6
disappointed 6
they 6
turn 6
to 6
the 6
bottle 6
for 6
a 6
time 6
at 6
least 6
and 6
in 6
a 6
kind 6
of 6
way 6
it 6
works 6
church 6
may 6
still 6
be 6
attended 6

it 6

more 6

only 6
on 6
the 6
verbal 6
level 6
only 6
in 6
a 6
strictly 6
pickwickian 6
sense 6
the 6
effective 6
object 6
of 6
worship 6
is 6
the 6
bottle 6
and 6
the 6
sole 6
religious 6
experience 6
is 6
that 6
state 6
of 6
uninhibited 6
and 6
belligerent 6
euphoria 6
which 6
follows 6
the 6
ingestion 6
of 6
the 6
third 6
cocktail 6
we 6
see 6
then 6
that 6
christianity 6
and 6
alcohol 6
do 6
not 6
and 6
cannot 6
mix 6
christianity 6
and 6
mescalin 6
seem 6
to 6
be 6
much 6
more 6
compatible 6
this 6
has 6
been 6
demonstrated 6
by 6
many 6
tribes 6
of 6
indians 6
from 6
texas 6
to 6
as 6
far 6
north 6
as 6
wisconsin 6
among 6
these 6
tribes 6
are 6
to 6
be 6
found 6
groups 6
affiliated 6
with 6
the 6
native 6
american 6
church 6
a 6
sect 6
whose 6
principal 6
rite 6
is 6
a 6
kind 6
of 6
early 6
christian 6
agape 6
or 6

where 6
slices 6

peyote 6
take 6
the 6
place 6
of 6
the 6
sacramental 6
bread 6
and 6

these 6
native 6
americans 6
regard 6
the 6
cactus 6
as 6
gods 6
special 6
gift 6
to 6

rites 6

a 6
peyotist 6
congregation 6
says 6
of 6
his 6
fellow 6
worshipers 6
that 6
they 6
are 6
certainly 6
not 6
stupefied 6

never 6

much 6
religious 6
feeling 6

decorum 6

what 6
we 6
may 6
ask 6
are 6
these 6
devout 6
and 6
wellbehaved 6
peyotists 6
experiencing 6
not 6

mild 6
sense 6

religious 6

is 6
something 6
more 6
direct 6
and 6
illuminating 6
more 6
spontaneous 6
less 6
the 6
homemade 6

they 6
see 6
visions 6
which 6
may 6
be 6
of 6

himself 6
sometimes 6
they 6
hear 6
the 6
voice 6
of 6
the 6
great 6
spirit 6
sometimes 6
they 6
become 6
aware 6
of 6
the 6
presence 6
of 6
god 6
and 6
of 6
those 6
personal 6
shortcomings 6
which 6

be 6
corrected 6

cannot 6
be 6
condemned 6
out 6
of 6

as 6
evil 6
in 6
sacramentalizing 6
the 6
use 6
of 6
peyote 6
the 6
indians 6
of 6
the 6
native 6
american 6
church 6
have 6
done 6
something 6
which 6
is 6
at 6
once 6
psychologically 6
sound 6
and 6
historically 6
respectable 6
in 6
the 6
early 6
centuries 6
of 6
christianity 6
many 6
pagan 6
rites 6
and 6
festivals 6
were 6
baptized 6
so 6
to 6
say 6
and 6
made 6
to 6
serve 6
the 6
purposes 6
of 6
the 6
church 6
these 6
jollifications 6
were 6
not 6
particularly 6
edifying 6
but 6
they 6
assuaged 6
a 6
certain 6
psychological 6
hunger 6
and 6
instead 6
of 6
trying 6
to 6
suppress 6
them 6
the 6
earlier 6
missionaries 6
had 6
the 6
sense 6
to 6
accept 6
them 6
for 6
what 6
they 6
were 6
soulsatisfying 6
expressions 6
of 6
fundamental 6
urges 6
and 6
to 6
incorporate 6
them 6
into 6
the 6
fabric 6
of 6
the 6
new 6
religion 6
what 6
the 6
native 6
americans 6
have 6
done 6
is 6
essentially 6
similar 6
they 6
have 6
taken 6
a 6
pagan 6
custom 6
a 6
custom 6
incidentally 6
far 6
more 6
elevating 6
and 6
enlightening 6
than 6
most 6
of 6
the 6
rather 6
brutish 6
carousals 6
and 6
mummeries 6
adopted 6
from 6
european 6
paganism 6
and 6
given 6
it 6
a 6
christian 6
significance 6
though 6
but 6
recently 6
introduced 6
into 6
the 6
northern 6
united 6
states 6
peyoteeating 6
and 6
the 6
religion 6
based 6
upon 6
it 6
have 6
become 6
important 6
symbols 6
of 6
the 6
red 6
mans 6
right 6
to 6
spiritual 6
independence 6
some 6
indians 6
have 6
reacted 6
to 6
white 6
supremacy 6
by 6
becoming 6
americanized 6
others 6
by 6
retreating 6
into 6
traditional 6
indianism 6
but 6
some 6
have 6
tried 6
to 6
make 6
the 6
best 6
of 6
both 6
worlds 6
indeed 6
of 6
all 6
the 6
worldsthe 6
best 6
of 6
indianism 6
the 6
best 6
of 6
christianity 6
and 6
the 6
best 6
of 6
those 6
other 6
worlds 6
of 6
transcendental 6
experience 6
where 6
the 6
soul 6
knows 6
itself 6
as 6
unconditioned 6
and 6
of 6
like 6
nature 6
with 6
the 6
divine 6
hence 6
the 6
native 6
american 6
church 6
in 6
it 6
two 6
great 6
appetites 6
of 6
the 6
soul 6
the 6
urge 6
to 6
independence 6
and 6
selfdetermination 6
and 6
the 6
urge 6
to 6
selftranscendencewere 6
fused 6
with 6
and 6
interpreted 6
in 6
the 6
light 6
of 6
a 6
thirdthe 6
urge 6
to 6

justify 6
the 6
ways 6

all 6

that 6

is 6
what 6
catholic 6
theologians 6
call 6
a 6
gratuitous 6

not 6
necessary 6

potentially 6
helpful 6

be 6

we 6
can 6
never 6
dispense 6

the 6
other 6

for 6
it 6
is 6
by 6
means 6
of 6
them 6
and 6
only 6
by 6
their 6
means 6
that 6
we 6
have 6
raised 6
ourselves 6
above 6
the 6
brutes 6
to 6
the 6
level 6
of 6
human 6
beings 6
but 6
we 6
can 6
easily 6
become 6
the 6
victims 6
as 6
well 6
as 6
the 6
beneficiaries 6
of 6
these 6
systems 6
we 6
must 6
learn 6
how 6
to 6
handle 6

effectively 6

at 6
the 6
same 6
time 6
we 6
must 6
preserve 6

if 6
necessary 6
intensify 6
our 6
ability 6
to 6
look 6
at 6
the 6

directly 6
and 6
not 6
through 6
that 6
half 6
opaque 6
medium 6
of 6
concepts 6
which 6
distorts 6
every 6
given 6

into 6
the 6
all 6
too 6
familiar 6
likeness 6

all 6
our 6
education 6
is 6
predominantly 6
verbal 6
and 6
therefore 6
fails 6
to 6
accomplish 6
what 6
it 6
is 6
supposed 6
to 6
do 6
instead 6
of 6
transforming 6

it 6
turns 6
out 6

who 6
are 6
completely 6
unaware 6
of 6

it 6
inflicts 6
upon 6

students 6
of 6

who 6

nothing 6

gestalt 6
psychologists 6
such 6
as 6
samuel 6

the 6

and 6
increasing 6
the 6
acuity 6
of 6

perceptions 6
but 6
do 6
our 6
educators 6
apply 6
them 6
the 6
answer 6
is 6
no 6
teachers 6
in 6
every 6
field 6
of 6
psychephysical 6
skill 6
from 6

the 6
conditions 6
of 6
optimum 6
functioning 6
within 6
their 6
special 6
fields 6
but 6
have 6
any 6
of 6
the 6
great 6
foundations 6
financed 6
a 6

for 6
coordinating 6

practice 6
of 6
heightened 6
creativeness 6
again 6
so 6
far 6
as 6
i 6
am 6
aware 6
the 6
answer 6
is 6
no 6
all 6
sorts 6
of 6

teach 6

and 6
for 6
many 6
of 6
their 6
hearers 6
many 6
of 6
these 6
techniques 6
are 6
demonstrably 6
effective 6
but 6
do 6
we 6
see 6
respectable 6
psychologists 6
philosophers 6
and 6
clergymen 6
boldly 6
descending 6
into 6
those 6
odd 6
and 6
sometimes 6
malodorous 6
wells 6
at 6
the 6
bottom 6
of 6
which 6
poor 6
truth 6
is 6
so 6
often 6
condemned 6
to 6
sit 6
yet 6
once 6
more 6
the 6
answer 6
is 6
no 6
and 6
now 6
look 6
at 6

of 6

that 6

would 6
be 6

a 6
sabbatical 6

be 6
urged 6

even 6
if 6

take 6
an 6
occasional 6
trip 6
through 6
some 6

door 6
in 6
the 6

the 6

if 6
it 6
terrified 6
him 6
it 6
would 6
be 6
unfortunate 6
but 6
probably 6
salutary 6
if 6
it 6
brought 6
him 6
a 6
brief 6
but 6
timeless 6
illumination 6
so 6
much 6
the 6
better 6
in 6
either 6
case 6
the 6

a 6
little 6
of 6
the 6
confident 6

sprouting 6
from 6

such 6
a 6

would 6
be 6
inadvisable 6
even 6
morally 6
wrong 6

the 6

had 6
done 6
more 6

any 6

s 6
slotkin 6
has 6
written 6
that 6
the 6
habitual 6
use 6
of 6
peyote 6
does 6
not 6
seem 6
to 6
produce 6
any 6
increased 6
tolerance 6
or 6
dependence 6
i 6
know 6
many 6
people 6
who 6
have 6
been 6
peyotists 6
for 6
forty 6
to 6
fifty 6
years 6
the 6
amount 6
of 6
peyote 6
they 6
use 6
depends 6
upon 6
the 6
solemnity 6
of 6
the 6
occasion 6
in 6
general 6
they 6
do 6
not 6
take 6
any 6
more 6
peyote 6
now 6
than 6
they 6
did 6
years 6
ago 6
also 6
there 6
is 6
sometimes 6
an 6
interval 6
of 6
a 6
month 6
or 6
more 6
between 6
rites 6
and 6
they 6
go 6
without 6
peyote 6
during 6
this 6
period 6
without 6
feeling 6
any 6
craving 6
for 6
it 6
personally 6
even 6
after 6
a 6
series 6
of 6
rites 6
occurring 6
on 6
four 6
successive 6
weekends 6
i 6
neither 6
increased 6
the 6
amount 6
of 6
peyote 6
consumed 6
nor 6
felt 6
any 6
continued 6
need 6
for 6
it 6
it 6
is 6
evidently 6
with 6
good 6
reason 6
that 6
peyote 6
has 6
never 6
been 6
legally 6
declared 6
a 6
narcotic 6
or 6
its 6
use 6
prohibited 6
by 6
the 6
federal 6
government 6
however 6
during 6
the 6
long 6
history 6
of 6
indianwhite 6
contact 6
white 6
offcials 6
have 6
usually 6
tried 6
to 6
suppress 6
the 6
use 6
of 6
peyote 6
because 6
it 6
has 6
been 6
conceived 6
to 6
violate 6
their 6
own 6
mores 6
but 6
these 6
attempts 6
have 6
always 6
failed 6
in 6
a 6
footnote 6
dr 6
slotkin 6
adds 6
that 6
it 6
is 6
amazing 6
to 6
hear 6
the 6
fantastic 6
stories 6
about 6
the 6
effects 6
of 6
peyote 6
and 6
the 6
nature 6
of 6

preface 7
the 7
stories 7
in 7
the 7
fairy 7
books 7
have 7
generally 7
been 7
such 7
as 7
old 7
women 7
in 7
country 7
places 7
tell 7
to 7
their 7
grandchildren 7
nobody 7
knows 7
how 7
old 7
they 7
are 7
or 7
who 7
told 7
them 7
first 7
the 7
children 7
of 7
ham 7
shem 7
and 7
japhet 7
may 7
have 7
listened 7
to 7

in 7
the 7
ark 7
on 7

hectors 7
little 7

may 7
have 7
heard 7
them 7
in 7
troy 7
town 7
for 7
it 7
is 7
certain 7
that 7
homer 7
knew 7
them 7
and 7
that 7
some 7
of 7
them 7
were 7
written 7
down 7
in 7
egypt 7
about 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
moses 7
people 7
in 7
different 7
countries 7
tell 7
them 7
differently 7
but 7
they 7
are 7
always 7
the 7
same 7
stories 7
really 7
whether 7
among 7
little 7
zulus 7
at 7
the 7
cape 7
or 7
little 7
eskimo 7
near 7
the 7
north 7
pole 7
the 7
changes 7
are 7
only 7
in 7
matters 7
of 7
manners 7
and 7
customs 7
such 7
as 7
wearing 7
clothes 7
or 7
not 7
meeting 7
lions 7
who 7
talk 7
in 7
the 7
warm 7
countries 7
or 7
talking 7
bears 7
in 7
the 7
cold 7
countries 7
there 7
are 7
plenty 7
of 7
kings 7
and 7
queens 7
in 7
the 7
fairy 7
tales 7
just 7
because 7
long 7
ago 7
there 7
were 7
plenty 7
of 7
kings 7
in 7
the 7
country 7
a 7
gentleman 7
who 7
would 7
be 7
a 7
squire 7
now 7
was 7
a 7
kind 7
of 7
king 7
in 7
scotland 7
in 7
very 7
old 7
times 7
and 7
the 7
same 7
in 7
other 7
places 7
these 7
old 7
stories 7
never 7
forgotten 7
were 7
taken 7
down 7
in 7
writing 7
in 7
different 7
ages 7
but 7
mostly 7
in 7
this 7
century 7
in 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7

these 7
ancient 7

of 7

not 7
nearly 7
all 7
are 7

persia 7
told 7
them 7
in 7
their 7
own 7
way 7
not 7
for 7
children 7
but 7
for 7
grownup 7
people 7
there 7
were 7
no 7
novels 7
then 7
nor 7
any 7
printed 7
books 7
of 7
course 7
but 7
there 7
were 7
people 7
whose 7
profession 7
it 7
was 7
to 7
amuse 7
men 7
and 7
women 7
by 7
telling 7
tales 7
they 7
dressed 7
the 7
fairy 7
stories 7
up 7
and 7
made 7
the 7
characters 7
good 7
mahommedans 7
living 7
in 7
bagdad 7
or 7
india 7
the 7
events 7
were 7
often 7
supposed 7
to 7
happen 7
in 7
the 7
reign 7
of 7
the 7
great 7
caliph 7
or 7
ruler 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
haroun 7

who 7
lived 7
in 7
bagdad 7
in 7
ad 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
accompanies 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
also 7
a 7
real 7
person 7
of 7
the 7
great 7
family 7
of 7
the 7
barmecides 7
he 7
was 7
put 7
to 7
death 7
by 7
the 7
caliph 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
cruel 7
way 7
nobody 7
ever 7
knew 7
why 7
the 7
stories 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
told 7
in 7
their 7
present 7
shape 7
a 7
good 7
long 7
while 7
after 7
the 7
caliph 7
died 7
when 7
nobody 7
knew 7
very 7
exactly 7
what 7
had 7
really 7
happened 7
at 7
last 7
some 7
storyteller 7
thought 7
of 7
writing 7
down 7
the 7
tales 7
and 7
fixing 7
them 7
into 7
a 7
kind 7
of 7
framework 7
as 7
if 7
they 7
had 7
all 7
been 7
narrated 7
to 7
a 7
cruel 7
sultan 7
by 7
his 7
wife 7
probably 7
the 7
tales 7
were 7
written 7
down 7
about 7
the 7
time 7
when 7
edward 7
i 7
was 7
fighting 7
robert 7
bruce 7
but 7
changes 7
were 7
made 7
in 7
them 7
at 7
different 7
times 7
and 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
that 7
is 7
very 7
dull 7
and 7
stupid 7
was 7
put 7
in 7
and 7
plenty 7
of 7
verses 7
neither 7
the 7
verses 7
nor 7
the 7
dull 7
pieces 7
are 7
given 7
in 7
this 7
book 7
people 7
in 7
france 7
and 7
england 7
knew 7
almost 7
nothing 7
about 7
the 7
arabian 7
nights 7
till 7
the 7
reigns 7
of 7
queen 7
anne 7
and 7
george 7
i 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
translated 7
into 7
french 7
by 7
monsieur 7
galland 7
grownup 7
people 7
were 7
then 7
very 7
fond 7
of 7
fairy 7
tales 7
and 7
they 7
thought 7
these 7
arab 7
stories 7
the 7
best 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
ever 7
read 7
they 7
were 7
delighted 7
with 7
ghouls 7
who 7
lived 7
among 7
the 7
tombs 7
and 7
geni 7
who 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
kind 7
of 7
ogres 7
and 7
with 7
princesses 7
who 7
work 7
magic 7
spells 7
and 7
with 7
peris 7
who 7
are 7
arab 7
fairies 7
sindbad 7
had 7
adventures 7
which 7
perhaps 7
came 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
odyssey 7
of 7
homer 7
in 7
fact 7
all 7
the 7
east 7
had 7
contributed 7
its 7
wonders 7
and 7
sent 7
them 7
to 7
europe 7
in 7
one 7
parcel 7
young 7
men 7
once 7
made 7
a 7
noise 7
at 7
monsieur 7
gallands 7
windows 7
in 7
the 7
dead 7
of 7
night 7
and 7
asked 7
him 7
to 7
tell 7
them 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
marvellous 7
tales 7
nobody 7
talked 7
of 7
anything 7
but 7
dervishes 7
and 7
vizirs 7
rocs 7
and 7
peris 7
the 7
stories 7
were 7
translated 7
from 7
french 7
into 7
all 7
languages 7
and 7
only 7
bishop 7
atterbury 7
complained 7
that 7
the 7
tales 7
were 7
not 7
likely 7
to 7
be 7
true 7
and 7
had 7
no 7
moral 7
the 7
bishops 7
was 7
presently 7
banished 7
for 7
being 7
on 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
prince 7
charlies 7
father 7
and 7
had 7
leisure 7
to 7
repent 7
of 7
being 7
so 7
solemn 7
in 7
this 7
book 7
the 7
arabian 7
nights 7
are 7
translated 7
from 7
the 7
french 7
version 7
of 7
monsieur 7
galland 7
who 7
dropped 7
out 7
the 7
poetry 7
and 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
what 7
the 7
arabian 7
authors 7
thought 7
funny 7
though 7
it 7
seems 7
wearisome 7
to 7
us 7
in 7
this 7
book 7
the 7
stories 7
are 7
shortened 7
here 7
and 7
there 7
and 7
omissions 7
are 7
made 7
of 7
pieces 7
only 7
suitable 7
for 7
arabs 7
and 7
old 7
gentlemen 7
the 7
translations 7
are 7
by 7
the 7
writers 7
of 7
the 7
tales 7
in 7

books 7

the 7
pictures 7

mr 7
ford 7
i 7
can 7
remember 7
reading 7
the 7
arabian 7
nights 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
six 7
years 7
old 7
in 7
dirty 7
yellow 7
old 7
volumes 7
of 7
small 7
type 7
with 7
no 7
pictures 7
and 7
i 7
hope 7
children 7
who 7
read 7
them 7
with 7
mr 7
fords 7
pictures 7
will 7
be 7
as 7
happy 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
then 7
in 7
the 7
company 7
of 7
aladdin 7
and 7
sindbad 7
the 7
sailor 7
the 7
arabian 7
nights 7
in 7
the 7
chronicles 7
of 7
the 7
ancient 7
dynasty 7
of 7
the 7
sassanidae 7
who 7
reigned 7
for 7
about 7
four 7
hundred 7
years 7
from 7
persia 7
to 7
the 7
borders 7
of 7
china 7
beyond 7
the 7
great 7
river 7
ganges 7
itself 7
we 7
read 7
the 7
praises 7
of 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
of 7
this 7
race 7
who 7
was 7
said 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
best 7
monarch 7
of 7
his 7
time 7
his 7
subjects 7
loved 7
him 7
and 7
his 7
neighbors 7
feared 7
him 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
died 7
he 7
left 7
his 7
kingdom 7
in 7
a 7
more 7
prosperous 7
and 7
powerful 7
condition 7
than 7
any 7
king 7
had 7
done 7
before 7
him 7
the 7
two 7
sons 7
who 7
survived 7
him 7
loved 7
each 7
other 7
tenderly 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
real 7
grief 7
to 7
the 7
elder 7
schahriar 7
that 7
the 7
laws 7
of 7
the 7
empire 7
forbade 7
him 7
to 7
share 7
his 7
dominions 7
with 7
his 7
brother 7
schahzeman 7
indeed 7
after 7
ten 7
years 7
during 7
which 7
this 7
state 7
of 7
things 7
had 7
not 7
ceased 7
to 7
trouble 7
him 7
schahriar 7
cut 7
off 7
the 7
country 7
of 7
great 7
tartary 7
from 7
the 7
persian 7
empire 7
and 7
made 7
his 7
brother 7
king 7
now 7
the 7
sultan 7
schahriar 7
had 7
a 7
wife 7
whom 7
he 7
loved 7
more 7
than 7
all 7
the 7
world 7
and 7
his 7
greatest 7
happiness 7
was 7
to 7
surround 7
her 7
with 7
splendour 7
and 7
to 7
give 7
her 7
the 7
finest 7
dresses 7
and 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
jewels 7
it 7
was 7
therefore 7
with 7
the 7
deepest 7
shame 7
and 7
sorrow 7
that 7
he 7
accidentally 7
discovered 7
after 7
several 7
years 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
deceived 7
him 7
completely 7
and 7
her 7
whole 7
conduct 7
turned 7
out 7
to 7
have 7
been 7
so 7
bad 7
that 7
he 7
felt 7
himself 7
obliged 7
to 7
carry 7
out 7
the 7
law 7
of 7
the 7
land 7
and 7
order 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
to 7
put 7
her 7
to 7
death 7
the 7
blow 7
was 7
so 7
heavy 7
that 7
his 7
mind 7
almost 7
gave 7
way 7
and 7
he 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
quite 7
sure 7
that 7
at 7
bottom 7
all 7
women 7
were 7
as 7
wicked 7
as 7
the 7
sultana 7
if 7
you 7
could 7
only 7
find 7
them 7
out 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
fewer 7
the 7
world 7
contained 7
the 7
better 7
so 7
every 7
evening 7
he 7
married 7
a 7
fresh 7
wife 7
and 7
had 7
her 7
strangled 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
before 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
whose 7
duty 7
it 7
was 7
to 7
provide 7
these 7
unhappy 7
brides 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
poor 7
man 7
fulfilled 7
his 7
task 7
with 7
reluctance 7
but 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
escape 7
and 7
every 7
day 7
saw 7
a 7
girl 7
married 7
and 7
a 7
wife 7
dead 7
this 7
behaviour 7
caused 7
the 7
greatest 7
horror 7
in 7
the 7
town 7
where 7
nothing 7
was 7
heard 7
but 7
cries 7
and 7
lamentations 7
in 7
one 7
house 7
was 7
a 7
father 7
weeping 7
for 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
his 7
daughter 7
in 7
another 7
perhaps 7
a 7
mother 7
trembling 7
for 7
the 7
fate 7
of 7
her 7
child 7
and 7
instead 7
of 7
the 7
blessings 7
that 7
had 7
formerly 7
been 7
heaped 7
on 7
the 7
sultans 7
head 7
the 7
air 7
was 7
now 7
full 7
of 7
curses 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
himself 7
was 7
the 7
father 7
of 7
two 7
daughters 7
of 7
whom 7
the 7
elder 7
was 7
called 7
scheherazade 7
and 7
the 7
younger 7
dinarzade 7
dinarzade 7
had 7
no 7
particular 7
gifts 7
to 7
distinguish 7
her 7
from 7
other 7
girls 7
but 7
her 7
sister 7
was 7
clever 7
and 7
courageous 7
in 7
the 7
highest 7
degree 7
her 7
father 7
had 7
given 7
her 7
the 7
best 7
masters 7
in 7
philosophy 7
medicine 7
history 7
and 7
the 7
fine 7
arts 7
and 7
besides 7
all 7
this 7
her 7
beauty 7
excelled 7
that 7
of 7
any 7
girl 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
persia 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
was 7
talking 7
to 7
his 7
eldest 7
daughter 7
who 7
was 7
his 7
delight 7
and 7
pride 7
scheherazade 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
father 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
favour 7
to 7
ask 7
of 7
you 7
will 7
you 7
grant 7
it 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
can 7
refuse 7
you 7
nothing 7
replied 7
he 7
that 7
is 7
just 7
and 7
reasonable 7
then 7
listen 7
said 7
scheherazade 7
i 7
am 7
determined 7
to 7
stop 7
this 7
barbarous 7
practice 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
and 7
to 7
deliver 7
the 7
girls 7
and 7
mothers 7
from 7
the 7
awful 7
fate 7
that 7
hangs 7
over 7
them 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
an 7
excellent 7
thing 7
to 7
do 7
returned 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
but 7
how 7
do 7
you 7
propose 7
to 7
accomplish 7
it 7
my 7
father 7
answered 7
scheherazade 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
who 7
have 7
to 7
provide 7
the 7
sultan 7
daily 7
with 7
a 7
fresh 7
wife 7
and 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
by 7
all 7
the 7
affection 7
you 7
bear 7
me 7
to 7
allow 7
the 7
honour 7
to 7
fall 7
upon 7
me 7
have 7
you 7
lost 7
your 7
senses 7
cried 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
starting 7
back 7
in 7
horror 7
what 7
has 7
put 7
such 7
a 7
thing 7
into 7
your 7
head 7
you 7
ought 7
to 7
know 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
what 7
it 7
means 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
sultans 7
bride 7
yes 7
my 7
father 7
i 7
know 7
it 7
well 7
replied 7
she 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
afraid 7
to 7
think 7
of 7
it 7
if 7
i 7
fail 7
my 7
death 7
will 7
be 7
a 7
glorious 7
one 7
and 7
if 7
i 7
succeed 7
i 7
shall 7
have 7
done 7
a 7
great 7
service 7
to 7
my 7
country 7
it 7
is 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
said 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
i 7
shall 7
never 7
consent 7
if 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
to 7
order 7
me 7
to 7
plunge 7
a 7
dagger 7
in 7
your 7
heart 7
i 7
should 7
have 7
to 7
obey 7
what 7
a 7
task 7
for 7
a 7
father 7
ah 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
fear 7
death 7
fear 7
at 7
any 7
rate 7
the 7
anguish 7
you 7
would 7
cause 7
me 7
once 7
again 7
my 7
father 7
said 7
scheherazade 7
will 7
you 7
grant 7
me 7
what 7
i 7
ask 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
still 7
so 7
obstinate 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
why 7
are 7
you 7
so 7
resolved 7
upon 7
your 7
own 7
ruin 7
but 7
the 7
maiden 7
absolutely 7
refused 7
to 7
attend 7
to 7
her 7
fathers 7
words 7
and 7
at 7
length 7
in 7
despair 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
give 7
way 7
and 7
went 7
sadly 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
to 7
tell 7
the 7
sultan 7
that 7
the 7
following 7
evening 7
he 7
would 7
bring 7
him 7
scheherazade 7
the 7
sultan 7
received 7
this 7
news 7
with 7
the 7
greatest 7
astonishment 7
how 7
have 7
you 7
made 7
up 7
your 7
mind 7
he 7
asked 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
your 7
own 7
daughter 7
to 7
me 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
it 7
is 7
her 7
own 7
wish 7
even 7
the 7
sad 7
fate 7
that 7
awaits 7
her 7
could 7
not 7
hold 7
her 7
back 7
let 7
there 7
be 7
no 7
mistake 7
vizir 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
remember 7
you 7
will 7
have 7
to 7
take 7
her 7
life 7
yourself 7
if 7
you 7
refuse 7
i 7
swear 7
that 7
your 7
head 7
shall 7
pay 7
forfeit 7
sire 7
returned 7
the 7
vizir 7
whatever 7
the 7
cost 7
i 7
will 7
obey 7
you 7
though 7
a 7
father 7
i 7
am 7
also 7
your 7
subject 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
told 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
he 7
might 7
bring 7
his 7
daughter 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
liked 7
the 7
vizir 7
took 7
back 7
this 7
news 7
to 7
scheherazade 7
who 7
received 7
it 7
as 7
if 7
it 7
had 7
been 7
the 7
most 7
pleasant 7
thing 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
she 7
thanked 7
her 7
father 7
warmly 7
for 7
yielding 7
to 7
her 7
wishes 7
and 7
seeing 7
him 7
still 7
bowed 7
down 7
with 7
grief 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
she 7
hoped 7
he 7
would 7
never 7
repent 7
having 7
allowed 7
her 7
to 7
marry 7
the 7
sultan 7
then 7
she 7
went 7
to 7
prepare 7
herself 7
for 7
the 7
marriage 7
and 7
begged 7
that 7
her 7
sister 7
dinarzade 7
should 7
be 7
sent 7
for 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
her 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
alone 7
scheherazade 7
addressed 7
her 7
thus 7
my 7
dear 7
sister 7
i 7
want 7
your 7
help 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
important 7
affair 7

father 7
is 7
going 7
to 7
take 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
to 7
celebrate 7
my 7
marriage 7
with 7
the 7
sultan 7
when 7
his 7
highness 7
receives 7
me 7
i 7
shall 7
beg 7
him 7
as 7
a 7
last 7
favour 7
to 7
let 7
you 7
sleep 7
in 7
our 7
chamber 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
have 7
your 7
company 7
during 7
the 7
last 7
night 7
i 7
am 7
alive 7
if 7
as 7
i 7

grants 7
me 7
my 7
wish 7
be 7
sure 7
that 7
you 7
wake 7
me 7
an 7
hour 7
before 7
the 7
dawn 7
and 7
speak 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
these 7
words 7
my 7
sister 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
not 7
asleep 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
before 7
the 7
sun 7
rises 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
one 7
of 7
your 7
charming 7
stories 7
then 7
i 7
shall 7
begin 7
and 7
i 7
hope 7
by 7
this 7
means 7
to 7
deliver 7
the 7
people 7
from 7
the 7
terror 7
that 7
reigns 7
over 7
them 7
dinarzade 7
replied 7
that 7
she 7
would 7
do 7
with 7
pleasure 7
what 7
her 7
sister 7
wished 7
when 7
the 7
usual 7
hour 7
arrived 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
conducted 7
scheherazade 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
left 7
her 7
alone 7
with 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
bade 7
her 7
raise 7
her 7
veil 7
and 7
was 7
amazed 7
at 7
her 7
beauty 7
but 7
seeing 7
her 7
eyes 7
full 7
of 7
tears 7
he 7
asked 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
sire 7
replied 7
scheherazade 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
sister 7
who 7
loves 7
me 7
as 7
tenderly 7
as 7
i 7
love 7
her 7
grant 7
me 7
the 7
favour 7
of 7
allowing 7
her 7
to 7
sleep 7
this 7
night 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
room 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
last 7
we 7
shall 7
be 7
together 7
schahriar 7
consented 7
to 7
scheherazades 7
petition 7
and 7
dinarzade 7
was 7
sent 7
for 7
an 7
hour 7
before 7
daybreak 7
dinarzade 7
awoke 7
and 7
exclaimed 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
promised 7
my 7
dear 7
sister 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
not 7
asleep 7
tell 7
me 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
before 7
the 7
sun 7
rises 7
one 7
of 7
your 7
charming 7
stories 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
last 7
time 7
that 7
i 7
shall 7
have 7
the 7
pleasure 7
of 7
hearing 7
you 7
scheherazade 7
did 7
not 7
answer 7
her 7
sister 7
but 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
will 7
your 7
highness 7
permit 7
me 7
to 7
do 7
as 7
my 7
sister 7
asks 7
said 7
she 7
willingly 7
he 7
answered 7
so 7
scheherazade 7
began 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
sire 7
there 7
was 7
once 7
upon 7
a 7
time 7
a 7
merchant 7
who 7
possessed 7
great 7
wealth 7
in 7
land 7
and 7
merchandise 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
in 7
ready 7
money 7
he 7
was 7
obliged 7
from 7
time 7
to 7
time 7
to 7
take 7
journeys 7
to 7
arrange 7
his 7
affairs 7
one 7
day 7
having 7
to 7
go 7
a 7
long 7
way 7
from 7
home 7
he 7
mounted 7
his 7
horse 7
taking 7
with 7
him 7
a 7
small 7
wallet 7
in 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
put 7
a 7
few 7
biscuits 7
and 7
dates 7
because 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
pass 7
through 7
the 7
desert 7
where 7
no 7
food 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
got 7
he 7
arrived 7
without 7
any 7
mishap 7
and 7
having 7
finished 7
his 7
business 7
set 7
out 7
on 7
his 7
return 7
on 7
the 7
fourth 7
day 7
of 7
his 7
journey 7
the 7
heat 7
of 7
the 7
sun 7
being 7
very 7
great 7
he 7
turned 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
road 7
to 7
rest 7
under 7
some 7
trees 7
he 7
found 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
a 7
large 7
walnuttree 7
a 7
fountain 7
of 7
clear 7
and 7
running 7
water 7
he 7
dismounted 7
fastened 7
his 7
horse 7
to 7
a 7
branch 7
of 7
the 7
tree 7
and 7
sat 7
by 7
the 7
fountain 7
after 7
having 7
taken 7
from 7
his 7
wallet 7
some 7
of 7
his 7
dates 7
and 7
biscuits 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
this 7
frugal 7
meal 7
he 7
washed 7
his 7
face 7
and 7
hands 7
in 7
the 7
fountain 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
thus 7
employed 7
he 7
saw 7
an 7
enormous 7
genius 7
white 7
with 7
rage 7
coming 7
towards 7
him 7
with 7
a 7
scimitar 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
arise 7
he 7
cried 7
in 7
a 7
terrible 7
voice 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
kill 7
you 7
as 7
you 7
have 7
killed 7
my 7
son 7
as 7
he 7
uttered 7
these 7
words 7
he 7
gave 7
a 7
frightful 7
yell 7
the 7
merchant 7
quite 7
as 7
much 7
terrified 7
at 7
the 7
hideous 7
face 7
of 7
the 7
monster 7
as 7
at 7
his 7
words 7
answered 7
him 7
tremblingly 7
alas 7
good 7
sir 7
what 7
can 7
i 7
have 7
done 7
to 7
you 7
to 7
deserve 7
death 7
i 7
shall 7
kill 7
you 7
repeated 7
the 7
genius 7
as 7
you 7
have 7
killed 7
my 7
son 7
but 7
said 7
the 7
merchant 7
how 7
can 7
i 7
have 7
killed 7
your 7
son 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
him 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
even 7
seen 7
him 7
when 7
you 7
arrived 7
here 7
did 7
you 7
not 7
sit 7
down 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
asked 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
did 7
you 7
not 7
take 7
some 7
dates 7
from 7
your 7
wallet 7
and 7
whilst 7
eating 7
them 7
did 7
not 7
you 7
throw 7
the 7
stones 7
about 7
yes 7
said 7
the 7
merchant 7
i 7
certainly 7
did 7
so 7
then 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
i 7
tell 7
you 7
you 7
have 7
killed 7
my 7
son 7
for 7
whilst 7
you 7
were 7
throwing 7
about 7
the 7
stones 7
my 7
son 7
passed 7
by 7
and 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
struck 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
eye 7
and 7
killed 7
him 7
so 7
i 7
shall 7
kill 7
you 7
ah 7
sir 7
forgive 7
me 7
cried 7
the 7
merchant 7
i 7
will 7
have 7
no 7
mercy 7
on 7
you 7
answered 7
the 7
genius 7
but 7
i 7
killed 7
your 7
son 7
quite 7
unintentionally 7
so 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
to 7
spare 7
my 7
life 7
no 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
i 7
shall 7
kill 7
you 7
as 7
you 7
killed 7
my 7
son 7
and 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
seized 7
the 7
merchant 7
by 7
the 7
arm 7
threw 7
him 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
lifted 7
his 7
sabre 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
his 7
head 7
the 7
merchant 7
protesting 7
his 7
innocence 7
bewailed 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
and 7
tried 7
pitifully 7
to 7
avert 7
his 7
fate 7
the 7
genius 7
with 7
his 7
raised 7
scimitar 7
waited 7
till 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
but 7
was 7
not 7
in 7
the 7
least 7
touched 7
scheherazade 7
at 7
this 7
point 7
seeing 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
day 7
and 7
knowing 7
that 7
the 7
sultan 7
always 7
rose 7
very 7
early 7
to 7
attend 7
the 7
council 7
stopped 7
speaking 7
indeed 7
sister 7
said 7
dinarzade 7
this 7
is 7
a 7
wonderful 7
story 7
the 7
rest 7
is 7
still 7
more 7
wonderful 7
replied 7
scheherazade 7
and 7
you 7
would 7
say 7
so 7
if 7
the 7
sultan 7
would 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
live 7
another 7
day 7
and 7
would 7
give 7
me 7
leave 7
to 7
tell 7
it 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
next 7
night 7
schahriar 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
listening 7
to 7
scheherazade 7
with 7
pleasure 7
said 7
to 7
himself 7
i 7
will 7
wait 7
till 7
tomorrow 7
i 7
can 7
always 7
have 7
her 7
killed 7
when 7
i 7
have 7
heard 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
her 7
story 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
was 7
in 7
a 7
terrible 7
state 7
of 7
anxiety 7
but 7
he 7
was 7
much 7
delighted 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
sultan 7
enter 7
the 7
councilchamber 7
without 7
giving 7
the 7
terrible 7
command 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
expecting 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
before 7
the 7
day 7
broke 7
dinarzade 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
sister 7
dear 7
sister 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
awake 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
go 7
on 7
with 7
your 7
story 7
the 7
sultan 7
did 7
not 7
wait 7
for 7
scheherazade 7
to 7
ask 7
his 7
leave 7
finish 7
said 7
he 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
i 7
am 7
curious 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
end 7
so 7
scheherazade 7
went 7
on 7
with 7
the 7
story 7
this 7
happened 7
every 7
morning 7
the 7
sultana 7
told 7
a 7
story 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
let 7
her 7
live 7
to 7
finish 7
it 7
when 7
the 7
merchant 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
genius 7
was 7
determined 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
his 7
head 7
he 7
said 7
one 7
word 7
more 7
i 7
entreat 7
you 7
grant 7
me 7
a 7
little 7
delay 7
just 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
to 7
go 7
home 7
and 7
bid 7
my 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
farewell 7
and 7
to 7
make 7
my 7
will 7
when 7
i 7
have 7
done 7
this 7
i 7
will 7
come 7
back 7
here 7
and 7
you 7
shall 7
kill 7
me 7
but 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
if 7
i 7
grant 7
you 7
the 7
delay 7
you 7
ask 7
i 7
am 7
afraid 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
come 7
back 7
i 7
give 7
you 7
my 7
word 7
of 7
honour 7
answered 7
the 7
merchant 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
come 7
back 7
without 7
fail 7
how 7
long 7
do 7
you 7
require 7
asked 7
the 7
genius 7
i 7
ask 7
you 7
for 7
a 7
years 7
grace 7
replied 7
the 7
merchant 7
i 7
promise 7
you 7
that 7
tomorrow 7
twelvemonth 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
waiting 7
under 7
these 7
trees 7
to 7
give 7
myself 7
up 7
to 7
you 7
on 7
this 7
the 7
genius 7
left 7
him 7
near 7
the 7
fountain 7
and 7
disappeared 7
the 7
merchant 7
having 7
recovered 7
from 7
his 7
fright 7
mounted 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
went 7
on 7
his 7
road 7
when 7
he 7
arrived 7
home 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
received 7
him 7
with 7
the 7
greatest 7
joy 7
but 7
instead 7
of 7
embracing 7
them 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
weep 7
so 7
bitterly 7
that 7
they 7
soon 7
guessed 7
that 7
something 7
terrible 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
tell 7
us 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
said 7
his 7
wife 7
what 7
has 7
happened 7
alas 7
answered 7
her 7
husband 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
a 7
year 7
to 7
live 7
then 7
he 7
told 7
them 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
between 7
him 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
how 7
he 7
had 7
given 7
his 7
word 7
to 7
return 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
a 7
year 7
to 7
be 7
killed 7
when 7
they 7
heard 7
this 7
sad 7
news 7
they 7
were 7
in 7
despair 7
and 7
wept 7
much 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
merchant 7
began 7
to 7
settle 7
his 7
affairs 7
and 7
first 7
of 7
all 7
to 7
pay 7
his 7
debts 7
he 7
gave 7
presents 7
to 7
his 7
friends 7
and 7
large 7
alms 7
to 7
the 7
poor 7
he 7
set 7
his 7
slaves 7
at 7
liberty 7
and 7
provided 7
for 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
the 7
year 7
soon 7
passed 7
away 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
depart 7
when 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
say 7
goodbye 7
he 7
was 7
quite 7
overcome 7
with 7
grief 7
and 7
with 7
difficulty 7
tore 7
himself 7
away 7
at 7
length 7
he 7
reached 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
he 7
had 7
first 7
seen 7
the 7
genius 7
on 7
the 7
very 7
day 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
appointed 7
he 7
dismounted 7
and 7
sat 7
down 7
at 7
the 7
edge 7
of 7
the 7
fountain 7
where 7
he 7
awaited 7
the 7
genius 7
in 7
terrible 7
suspense 7
whilst 7
he 7
was 7
thus 7
waiting 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
leading 7
a 7
hind 7
came 7
towards 7
him 7
they 7
greeted 7
one 7
another 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
may 7
i 7
ask 7
brother 7
what 7
brought 7
you 7
to 7
this 7
desert 7
place 7
where 7
there 7
are 7
so 7
many 7
evil 7
genii 7
about 7
to 7
see 7
these 7
beautiful 7
trees 7
one 7
would 7
imagine 7
it 7
was 7
inhabited 7
but 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
dangerous 7
place 7
to 7
stop 7
long 7
in 7
the 7
merchant 7
told 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
why 7
he 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
come 7
there 7
he 7
listened 7
in 7
astonishment 7
this 7
is 7
a 7
most 7
marvellous 7
affair 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
witness 7
of 7
your 7
interview 7
with 7
the 7
genius 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
sat 7
down 7
by 7
the 7
merchant 7
while 7
they 7
were 7
talking 7
another 7
old 7
man 7
came 7
up 7
followed 7
by 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7
he 7
greeted 7
them 7
and 7
asked 7
what 7
they 7
were 7
doing 7
in 7
this 7
place 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
who 7
was 7
leading 7
the 7
hind 7
told 7
him 7
the 7
adventure 7
of 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
the 7
second 7
old 7
man 7
had 7
not 7
sooner 7
heard 7
the 7
story 7
than 7
he 7
too 7
decided 7
to 7
stay 7
there 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
would 7
happen 7
he 7
sat 7
down 7
by 7
the 7
others 7
and 7
was 7
talking 7
when 7
a 7
third 7
old 7
man 7
arrived 7
he 7
asked 7
why 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
was 7
with 7
them 7
looked 7
so 7
sad 7
they 7
told 7
him 7
the 7
story 7
and 7
he 7
also 7
resolved 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
would 7
pass 7
between 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
so 7
waited 7
with 7
the 7
rest 7
they 7
soon 7
saw 7
in 7
the 7
distance 7
a 7
thick 7
smoke 7
like 7
a 7
cloud 7
of 7
dust 7
this 7
smoke 7
came 7
nearer 7
and 7
nearer 7
and 7
then 7
all 7
at 7
once 7
it 7
vanished 7
and 7
they 7
saw 7
the 7
genius 7
who 7
without 7
speaking 7
to 7
them 7
approached 7
the 7
merchant 7
sword 7
in 7
hand 7
and 7
taking 7
him 7
by 7
the 7
arm 7
said 7
get 7
up 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
kill 7
you 7
as 7
you 7
killed 7
my 7
son 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
the 7
three 7
old 7
men 7
began 7
to 7
weep 7
and 7
groan 7
then 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
leading 7
the 7
hind 7
threw 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
monsters 7
feet 7
and 7
said 7
o 7
prince 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7
i 7
beg 7
of 7
you 7
to 7
stay 7
your 7
fury 7
and 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
my 7
story 7
and 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
hind 7
i 7
have 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
find 7
it 7
more 7
marvellous 7
than 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
merchant 7
whom 7
you 7
are 7
about 7
to 7
kill 7
i 7
hope 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
do 7
away 7
with 7
a 7
third 7
part 7
of 7
his 7
punishment 7
the 7
genius 7
considered 7
some 7
time 7
and 7
then 7
he 7
said 7
very 7
well 7
i 7
agree 7
to 7
this 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
old 7
man 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
hind 7
i 7
am 7
now 7
going 7
to 7
begin 7
my 7
story 7
said 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
so 7
please 7
attend 7
this 7
hind 7
that 7
you 7
see 7
with 7
me 7
is 7
my 7
wife 7
we 7
have 7
no 7
children 7
of 7
our 7
own 7
therefore 7
i 7
adopted 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
favorite 7
slave 7
and 7
determined 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
my 7
heir 7
my 7
wife 7
however 7
took 7
a 7
great 7
dislike 7
to 7
both 7
mother 7
and 7
child 7
which 7
she 7
concealed 7
from 7
me 7
till 7
too 7
late 7
when 7
my 7
adopted 7
son 7
was 7
about 7
ten 7
years 7
old 7
i 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
go 7
on 7
a 7
journey 7
before 7
i 7
went 7
i 7
entrusted 7
to 7
my 7
wifes 7
keeping 7
both 7
the 7
mother 7
and 7
child 7
and 7
begged 7
her 7
to 7
take 7
care 7
of 7
them 7
during 7
my 7
absence 7
which 7
lasted 7
a 7
whole 7
year 7
during 7
this 7
time 7
she 7
studied 7
magic 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
carry 7
out 7
her 7
wicked 7
scheme 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
learnt 7
enough 7
she 7
took 7
my 7
son 7
into 7
a 7
distant 7
place 7
and 7
changed 7
him 7
into 7
a 7
calf 7
then 7
she 7
gave 7
him 7
to 7
my 7
steward 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
to 7
look 7
after 7
a 7
calf 7
she 7
had 7
bought 7
she 7
also 7
changed 7
the 7
slave 7
into 7
a 7
cow 7
which 7
she 7
sent 7
to 7
my 7
steward 7
when 7
i 7
returned 7
i 7
inquired 7
after 7
my 7
slave 7
and 7
the 7
child 7
your 7
slave 7
is 7
dead 7
she 7
said 7
and 7
as 7
for 7
your 7
son 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
seen 7
him 7
for 7
two 7
months 7
and 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
where 7
he 7
is 7
i 7
was 7
grieved 7
to 7
hear 7
of 7
my 7
slaves 7
death 7
but 7
as 7
my 7
son 7
had 7
only 7
disappeared 7
i 7
thought 7
i 7
should 7
soon 7
find 7
him 7
eight 7
months 7
however 7
passed 7
and 7
still 7
no 7
tidings 7
of 7
him 7
then 7
the 7
feast 7
of 7
bairam 7
came 7
to 7
celebrate 7
it 7
i 7
ordered 7
my 7
steward 7
to 7
bring 7
me 7
a 7
very 7
fat 7
cow 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
the 7
cow 7
that 7
he 7
brought 7
was 7
my 7
unfortunate 7
slave 7
i 7
bound 7
her 7
but 7
just 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
kill 7
her 7
she 7
began 7
to 7
low 7
most 7
piteously 7
and 7
i 7
saw 7
that 7
her 7
eyes 7
were 7
streaming 7
with 7
tears 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
most 7
extraordinary 7
and 7
feeling 7
a 7
movement 7
of 7
pity 7
i 7
ordered 7
the 7
steward 7
to 7
lead 7
her 7
away 7
and 7
bring 7
another 7
my 7
wife 7
who 7
was 7
present 7
scoffed 7
at 7
my 7
compassion 7
which 7
made 7
her 7
malice 7
of 7
no 7
avail 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
she 7
cried 7
kill 7
this 7
cow 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
best 7
we 7
have 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
to 7
please 7
her 7
i 7
tried 7
again 7
but 7
again 7
the 7
animals 7
lows 7
and 7
tears 7
disarmed 7
me 7
take 7
her 7
away 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
steward 7
and 7
kill 7
her 7
i 7
cannot 7
the 7
steward 7
killed 7
her 7
but 7
on 7
skinning 7
her 7
found 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
nothing 7
but 7
bones 7
although 7
she 7
appeared 7
so 7
fat 7
i 7
was 7
vexed 7
keep 7
her 7
for 7
yourself 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
steward 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
have 7
a 7
fat 7
calf 7
bring 7
that 7
in 7
her 7
stead 7
in 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
he 7
brought 7
a 7
very 7
fat 7
calf 7
which 7
although 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
it 7
was 7
my 7
son 7
it 7
tried 7
hard 7
to 7
break 7
its 7
cord 7
and 7
come 7
to 7
me 7
it 7
threw 7
itself 7
at 7
my 7
feet 7
with 7
its 7
head 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
as 7
if 7
it 7
wished 7
to 7
excite 7
my 7
pity 7
and 7
to 7
beg 7
me 7
not 7
to 7
take 7
away 7
its 7
life 7
i 7
was 7
even 7
more 7
surprised 7
and 7
touched 7
at 7
this 7
action 7
than 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
at 7
the 7
tears 7
of 7
the 7
cow 7
go 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
steward 7
take 7
back 7
this 7
calf 7
take 7
great 7
care 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
another 7
in 7
its 7
place 7
instantly 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
my 7
wife 7
heard 7
me 7
speak 7
this 7
she 7
at 7
once 7
cried 7
out 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
husband 7
do 7
not 7
sacrifice 7
any 7
calf 7
but 7
this 7
wife 7
i 7
answered 7
i 7
will 7
not 7
sacrifice 7
this 7
calf 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
her 7
remonstrances 7
i 7
remained 7
firm 7
i 7
had 7
another 7
calf 7
killed 7
this 7
one 7
was 7
led 7
away 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
steward 7
asked 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
private 7
i 7
have 7
come 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
some 7
news 7
which 7
i 7
think 7
you 7
will 7
like 7
to 7
hear 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
daughter 7
who 7
knows 7
magic 7
yesterday 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
leading 7
back 7
the 7
calf 7
which 7
you 7
refused 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
i 7
noticed 7
that 7
she 7
smiled 7
and 7
then 7
directly 7
afterwards 7
began 7
to 7
cry 7
i 7
asked 7
her 7
why 7
she 7
did 7
so 7
father 7
she 7
answered 7
this 7
calf 7
is 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
our 7
master 7
i 7
smile 7
with 7
joy 7
at 7
seeing 7
him 7
still 7
alive 7
and 7
i 7
weep 7
to 7
think 7
of 7
his 7
mother 7
who 7
was 7
sacrificed 7
yesterday 7
as 7
a 7
cow 7
these 7
changes 7
have 7
been 7
wrought 7
by 7
our 7
masters 7
wife 7
who 7
hated 7
the 7
mother 7
and 7
son 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
of 7
genius 7
continued 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
i 7
leave 7
you 7
to 7
imagine 7
my 7
astonishment 7
i 7
went 7
immediately 7
with 7
the 7
steward 7
to 7
speak 7
with 7
his 7
daughter 7
myself 7
first 7
of 7
all 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
stable 7
to 7
see 7
my 7
son 7
and 7
he 7
replied 7
in 7
his 7
dumb 7
way 7
to 7
all 7
my 7
caresses 7
when 7
the 7
stewards 7
daughter 7
came 7
i 7
asked 7
her 7
if 7
she 7
could 7
change 7
my 7
son 7
back 7
to 7
his 7
proper 7
shape 7
yes 7
i 7
can 7
she 7
replied 7
on 7
two 7
conditions 7
one 7
is 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
him 7
to 7
me 7
for 7
a 7
husband 7
and 7
the 7
other 7
is 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
let 7
me 7
punish 7
the 7
woman 7
who 7
changed 7
him 7
into 7
a 7
calf 7
to 7
the 7
first 7
condition 7
i 7
answered 7
i 7
agree 7
with 7
all 7
my 7
heart 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
an 7
ample 7
dowry 7
to 7
the 7
second 7
i 7
also 7
agree 7
i 7
only 7
beg 7
you 7
to 7
spare 7
her 7
life 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
she 7
replied 7
i 7
will 7
treat 7
her 7
as 7
she 7
treated 7
your 7
son 7
then 7
she 7
took 7
a 7
vessel 7
of 7
water 7
and 7
pronounced 7
over 7
it 7
some 7
words 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
understand 7
then 7
on 7
throwing 7
the 7
water 7
over 7
him 7
he 7
became 7
immediately 7
a 7
young 7
man 7
once 7
more 7
my 7
son 7
my 7
dear 7
son 7
i 7
exclaimed 7
kissing 7
him 7
in 7
a 7
transport 7
of 7
joy 7
this 7
kind 7
maiden 7
has 7
rescued 7
you 7
from 7
a 7
terrible 7
enchantment 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
that 7
out 7
of 7
gratitude 7
you 7
will 7
marry 7
her 7
he 7
consented 7
joyfully 7
but 7
before 7
they 7
were 7
married 7
the 7
young 7
girl 7
changed 7
my 7
wife 7
into 7
a 7
hind 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
she 7
whom 7
you 7
see 7
before 7
you 7
i 7
wished 7
her 7
to 7
have 7
this 7
form 7
rather 7
than 7
a 7
stranger 7
one 7
so 7
that 7
we 7
could 7
see 7
her 7
in 7
the 7
family 7
without 7
repugnance 7
since 7
then 7
my 7
son 7
has 7
become 7
a 7
widower 7
and 7
has 7
gone 7
travelling 7
i 7
am 7
now 7
going 7
in 7
search 7
of 7
him 7
and 7
not 7
wishing 7
to 7
confide 7
my 7
wife 7
to 7
the 7
care 7
of 7
other 7
people 7
i 7
am 7
taking 7
her 7
with 7
me 7
is 7
this 7
not 7
a 7
most 7
marvellous 7
tale 7
it 7
is 7
indeed 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
because 7
of 7
it 7
i 7
grant 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
third 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
punishment 7
of 7
this 7
merchant 7
when 7
the 7
first 7
old 7
man 7
had 7
finished 7
his 7
story 7
the 7
second 7
who 7
was 7
leading 7
the 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
genius 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
what 7
happened 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
my 7
story 7
even 7
more 7
astonishing 7
than 7
the 7
one 7
to 7
which 7
you 7
have 7
just 7
been 7
listening 7
but 7
when 7
i 7
have 7
related 7
it 7
will 7
you 7
grant 7
me 7
also 7
the 7
third 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
punishment 7
yes 7
replied 7
the 7
genius 7
provided 7
that 7
your 7
story 7
surpasses 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
hind 7
with 7
this 7
agreement 7
the 7
second 7
old 7
man 7
began 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
second 7
old 7
man 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7

prince 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7

must 7
know 7
that 7
we 7
are 7
three 7
brothers 7
these 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7
and 7
myself 7
our 7
father 7
died 7
leaving 7
us 7
each 7
a 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
with 7
this 7
sum 7
we 7
all 7
three 7
took 7
up 7
the 7
same 7
profession 7
and 7
became 7
merchants 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
after 7
we 7
had 7
opened 7
our 7
shops 7
my 7
eldest 7
brother 7
one 7
of 7
these 7
two 7
dogs 7
resolved 7
to 7
travel 7
in 7
foreign 7
countries 7
for 7
the 7
sake 7
of 7
merchandise 7
with 7
this 7
intention 7
he 7
sold 7
all 7
he 7
had 7
and 7
bought 7
merchandise 7
suitable 7
to 7
the 7
voyages 7
he 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
make 7
he 7
set 7
out 7
and 7
was 7
away 7
a 7
whole 7
year 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
this 7
time 7
a 7
beggar 7
came 7
to 7
my 7
shop 7
goodday 7
i 7
said 7
goodday 7
he 7
answered 7
is 7
it 7
possible 7
that 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
recognise 7
me 7
then 7
i 7
looked 7
at 7
him 7
closely 7
and 7
saw 7
he 7
was 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
made 7
him 7
come 7
into 7
my 7
house 7
and 7
asked 7
him 7
how 7
he 7
had 7
fared 7
in 7
his 7
enterprise 7
do 7
not 7
question 7
me 7
he 7
replied 7
see 7
me 7
you 7
see 7
all 7
i 7
have 7
it 7
would 7
but 7
renew 7
my 7
trouble 7
to 7
tell 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
misfortunes 7
that 7
have 7
befallen 7
me 7
in 7
a 7
year 7
and 7
have 7
brought 7
me 7
to 7
this 7
state 7
i 7
shut 7
up 7
my 7
shop 7
paid 7
him 7
every 7
attention 7
taking 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
giving 7
him 7
my 7
most 7
beautiful 7
robes 7
i 7
examined 7
my 7
accounts 7
and 7
found 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
doubled 7
my 7
capitalthat 7
is 7
that 7
i 7
now 7
possessed 7
two 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
i 7
gave 7
my 7
brother 7
half 7
saying 7
now 7
brother 7
you 7
can 7
forget 7
your 7
losses 7
he 7
accepted 7
them 7
with 7
joy 7
and 7
we 7
lived 7
together 7
as 7
we 7
had 7
before 7
some 7
time 7
afterwards 7
my 7
second 7
brother 7
wished 7
also 7
to 7
sell 7
his 7
business 7
and 7
travel 7
my 7
eldest 7
brother 7
and 7
i 7
did 7
all 7
we 7
could 7
to 7
dissuade 7
him 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
he 7
joined 7
a 7
caravan 7
and 7
set 7
out 7
he 7
came 7
back 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
a 7
year 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
state 7
as 7
his 7
elder 7
brother 7
i 7
took 7
care 7
of 7
him 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
had 7
a 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
to 7
spare 7
i 7
gave 7
them 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
he 7
reopened 7
his 7
shop 7
one 7
day 7
my 7
two 7
brothers 7
came 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
propose 7
that 7
we 7
should 7
make 7
a 7
journey 7
and 7
trade 7
at 7
first 7
i 7
refused 7
to 7
go 7
you 7
travelled 7
i 7
said 7
and 7
what 7
did 7
you 7
gain 7
but 7
they 7
came 7
to 7
me 7
repeatedly 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
held 7
out 7
for 7
five 7
years 7
i 7
at 7
last 7
gave 7
way 7
but 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
made 7
their 7
preparation 7
and 7
they 7
began 7
to 7
buy 7
the 7
merchandise 7
we 7
needed 7
they 7
found 7
they 7
had 7
spent 7
every 7
piece 7
of 7
the 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
i 7
had 7
given 7
them 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
reproach 7
them 7
i 7
divided 7
my 7
six 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
with 7
them 7
giving 7
a 7
thousand 7
to 7
each 7
and 7
keeping 7
one 7
for 7
myself 7
and 7
the 7
other 7
three 7
i 7
buried 7
in 7
a 7
corner 7
of 7
my 7
house 7
we 7
bought 7
merchandise 7
loaded 7
a 7
vessel 7
with 7
it 7
and 7
set 7
forth 7
with 7
a 7
favorable 7
wind 7
after 7
two 7
months 7
sailing 7
we 7
arrived 7
at 7
a 7
seaport 7
where 7
we 7
disembarked 7
and 7
did 7
a 7
great 7
trade 7
then 7
we 7
bought 7
the 7
merchandise 7
of 7
the 7
country 7
and 7
were 7
just 7
going 7
to 7
sail 7
once 7
more 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
stopped 7
on 7
the 7
shore 7
by 7
a 7
beautiful 7
though 7
poorly 7
dressed 7
woman 7
she 7
came 7
up 7
to 7
me 7
kissed 7
my 7
hand 7
and 7
implored 7
me 7
to 7
marry 7
her 7
and 7
take 7
her 7
on 7
board 7
at 7
first 7
i 7
refused 7
but 7
she 7
begged 7
so 7
hard 7
and 7
promised 7
to 7
be 7
such 7
a 7
good 7
wife 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
at 7
last 7
i 7
consented 7
i 7
got 7
her 7
some 7
beautiful 7
dresses 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
married 7
her 7
we 7
embarked 7
and 7
set 7
sail 7
during 7
the 7
voyage 7
i 7
discovered 7
so 7
many 7
good 7
qualities 7
in 7
my 7
wife 7
that 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
lover 7
her 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
but 7
my 7
brothers 7
began 7
to 7
be 7
jealous 7
of 7
my 7
prosperity 7
and 7
set 7
to 7
work 7
to 7
plot 7
against 7
my 7
life 7
one 7
night 7
when 7
we 7
were 7
sleeping 7
they 7
threw 7
my 7
wife 7
and 7
myself 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
my 7
wife 7
however 7
was 7
a 7
fairy 7
and 7
so 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
let 7
me 7
drown 7
but 7
transported 7
me 7
to 7
an 7
island 7
when 7
the 7
day 7
dawned 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
when 7
i 7
saw 7
you 7
on 7
the 7
seashore 7
i 7
took 7
a 7
great 7
fancy 7
to 7
you 7
and 7
wished 7
to 7
try 7
your 7
good 7
nature 7
so 7
i 7
presented 7
myself 7
in 7
the 7
disguise 7
you 7
saw 7
now 7
i 7
have 7
rewarded 7
you 7
by 7
saving 7
your 7
life 7
but 7
i 7
am 7
very 7
angry 7
with 7
your 7
brothers 7
and 7
i 7
shall 7
not 7
rest 7
till 7
i 7
have 7
taken 7
their 7
lives 7
i 7
thanked 7
the 7
fairy 7
for 7
all 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
done 7
for 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
begged 7
her 7
not 7
to 7
kill 7
my 7
brothers 7
i 7
appeased 7
her 7
wrath 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
she 7
transported 7
me 7
from 7
the 7
island 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
to 7
the 7
roof 7
of 7
my 7
house 7
and 7
she 7
disappeared 7
a 7
moment 7
afterwards 7
i 7
went 7
down 7
and 7
opened 7
the 7
doors 7
and 7
dug 7
up 7
the 7
three 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
buried 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
my 7
shop 7
was 7
opened 7
it 7
and 7
received 7
from 7
my 7
fellowmerchants 7
congratulations 7
on 7
my 7
return 7
when 7
i 7
went 7
home 7
i 7
saw 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7
who 7
came 7
to 7
meet 7
me 7
with 7
sorrowful 7
faces 7
i 7
was 7
much 7
astonished 7
but 7
the 7
fairy 7
who 7
reappeared 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
do 7
not 7
be 7
surprised 7
to 7
see 7
these 7
dogs 7
they 7
are 7
your 7
two 7
brothers 7
i 7
have 7
condemned 7
them 7
to 7
remain 7
for 7
ten 7
years 7
in 7
these 7
shapes 7
then 7
having 7
told 7
me 7
where 7
i 7
could 7
hear 7
news 7
of 7
her 7
she 7
vanished 7
the 7
ten 7
years 7
are 7
nearly 7
passed 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
to 7
find 7
her 7
as 7
in 7
passing 7
i 7
met 7
this 7
merchant 7
and 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
with 7
the 7
hind 7
i 7
stayed 7
with 7
them 7
this 7
is 7
my 7
history 7
o 7
prince 7
of 7
genii 7
do 7
you 7
not 7
think 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
most 7
marvellous 7
one 7
yes 7
indeed 7
replied 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
up 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
third 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
punishment 7
then 7
the 7
third 7
old 7
man 7
made 7
the 7
genius 7
the 7
same 7
request 7
as 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
promised 7
him 7
the 7
last 7
third 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
punishment 7
if 7
his 7
story 7
surpassed 7
both 7
the 7
others 7
so 7
he 7
told 7
his 7
story 7
to 7
the 7
genius 7
but 7
i 7
cannot 7
tell 7
you 7
what 7
it 7
was 7
as 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
but 7
i 7
do 7
know 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
even 7
more 7
marvellous 7
than 7
either 7
of 7
the 7
others 7
so 7
that 7
the 7
genius 7
was 7
astonished 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
third 7
old 7
man 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
up 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
third 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
punishment 7
he 7
ought 7
to 7
thank 7
all 7
three 7
of 7
you 7
for 7
having 7
interested 7
yourselves 7
in 7
his 7
favour 7
but 7
for 7
you 7
he 7
would 7
be 7
here 7
no 7
longer 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
disappeared 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
joy 7
of 7
the 7
company 7
the 7
merchant 7
did 7
not 7
fail 7
to 7
thank 7
his 7
friends 7
and 7
then 7
each 7
went 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
the 7
merchant 7
returned 7
to 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
and 7
passed 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
his 7
days 7
happily 7
with 7
them 7
but 7
sire 7
added 7
scheherazade 7
however 7
beautiful 7
are 7
the 7
stories 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
told 7
you 7
they 7
cannot 7
compare 7
with 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
fisherman 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
fisherman 7
sire 7
there 7
was 7
once 7
upon 7
a 7
time 7
a 7
fisherman 7
so 7
old 7
and 7
so 7
poor 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
scarcely 7
manage 7
to 7
support 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
three 7
children 7
he 7
went 7
every 7
day 7
to 7
fish 7
very 7
early 7
and 7
each 7
day 7
he 7
made 7
a 7
rule 7
not 7
to 7
throw 7
his 7
nets 7
more 7
than 7
four 7
times 7
he 7
started 7
out 7
one 7
morning 7
by 7
moonlight 7
and 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
seashore 7
he 7
undressed 7
and 7
threw 7
his 7
nets 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
drawing 7
them 7
towards 7
the 7
bank 7
he 7
felt 7
a 7
great 7
weight 7
he 7
though 7
he 7
had 7
caught 7
a 7
large 7
fish 7
and 7
he 7
felt 7
very 7
pleased 7
but 7
a 7
moment 7
afterwards 7
seeing 7
that 7
instead 7
of 7
a 7
fish 7
he 7
only 7
had 7
in 7
his 7
nets 7
the 7
carcase 7
of 7
an 7
ass 7
he 7
was 7
much 7
disappointed 7
vexed 7
with 7
having 7
such 7
a 7
bad 7
haul 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
mended 7
his 7
nets 7
which 7
the 7
carcase 7
of 7
the 7
ass 7
had 7
broken 7
in 7
several 7
places 7
he 7
threw 7
them 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
in 7
drawing 7
them 7
in 7
he 7
again 7
felt 7
a 7
great 7
weight 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
thought 7
they 7
were 7
full 7
of 7
fish 7
but 7
he 7
only 7
found 7
a 7
large 7
basket 7
full 7
of 7
rubbish 7
he 7
was 7
much 7
annoyed 7
o 7
fortune 7
he 7
cried 7
do 7
not 7
trifle 7
thus 7
with 7
me 7
a 7
poor 7
fisherman 7
who 7
can 7
hardly 7
support 7
his 7
family 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
threw 7
away 7
the 7
rubbish 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
washed 7
his 7
nets 7
clean 7
of 7
the 7
dirt 7
he 7
threw 7
them 7
for 7
the 7
third 7
time 7
but 7
he 7
only 7
drew 7
in 7
stones 7
shells 7
and 7
mud 7
he 7
was 7
almost 7
in 7
despair 7
then 7
he 7
threw 7
his 7
nets 7
for 7
the 7
fourth 7
time 7
when 7
he 7
thought 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
fish 7
he 7
drew 7
them 7
in 7
with 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
trouble 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
fish 7
however 7
but 7
he 7
found 7
a 7
yellow 7
pot 7
which 7
by 7
its 7
weight 7
seemed 7
full 7
of 7
something 7
and 7
he 7
noticed 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
fastened 7
and 7
sealed 7
with 7
lead 7
with 7
the 7
impression 7
of 7
a 7
seal 7
he 7
was 7
delighted 7
i 7
will 7
sell 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
founder 7
he 7
said 7
with 7
the 7
money 7
i 7
shall 7
get 7
for 7
it 7
i 7
shall 7
buy 7
a 7
measure 7
of 7
wheat 7
he 7
examined 7
the 7
jar 7
on 7
all 7
sides 7
he 7
shook 7
it 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
it 7
would 7
rattle 7
but 7
he 7
heard 7
nothing 7
and 7
so 7
judging 7
from 7
the 7
impression 7
of 7
the 7
seal 7
and 7
the 7
lid 7
he 7
thought 7
there 7
must 7
be 7
something 7
precious 7
inside 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
he 7
took 7
his 7
knife 7
and 7
with 7
a 7
little 7
trouble 7
he 7
opened 7
it 7
he 7
turned 7
it 7
upside 7
down 7
but 7
nothing 7
came 7
out 7
which 7
surprised 7
him 7
very 7
much 7
he 7
set 7
it 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
him 7
and 7
whilst 7
he 7
was 7
looking 7
at 7
it 7
attentively 7
such 7
a 7
thick 7
smoke 7
came 7
out 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
step 7
back 7
a 7
pace 7
or 7
two 7
this 7
smoke 7
rose 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
clouds 7
and 7
stretching 7
over 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
the 7
shore 7
formed 7
a 7
thick 7
mist 7
which 7
caused 7
the 7
fisherman 7
much 7
astonishment 7
when 7
all 7
the 7
smoke 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
jar 7
it 7
gathered 7
itself 7
together 7
and 7
became 7
a 7
thick 7
mass 7
in 7
which 7
appeared 7
a 7
genius 7
twice 7
as 7
large 7
as 7
the 7
largest 7
giant 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
such 7
a 7
terriblelooking 7
monster 7
the 7
fisherman 7
would 7
like 7
to 7
have 7
run 7
away 7
but 7
he 7
trembled 7
so 7
with 7
fright 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
move 7
a 7
step 7
great 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7
cried 7
the 7
monster 7
i 7
will 7
never 7
again 7
disobey 7
you 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
the 7
fisherman 7
took 7
courage 7
what 7
is 7
this 7
you 7
are 7
saying 7
great 7
genius 7
tell 7
me 7
your 7
history 7
and 7
how 7
you 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
shut 7
up 7
in 7
that 7
vase 7
at 7
this 7
the 7
genius 7
looked 7
at 7
the 7
fisherman 7
haughtily 7
speak 7
to 7
me 7
more 7
civilly 7
he 7
said 7
before 7
i 7
kill 7
you 7
alas 7
why 7
should 7
you 7
kill 7
me 7
cried 7
the 7
fisherman 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
freed 7
you 7
have 7
you 7
already 7
forgotten 7
that 7
no 7
answered 7
the 7
genius 7
but 7
that 7
will 7
not 7
prevent 7
me 7
from 7
killing 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
only 7
going 7
to 7
grant 7
you 7
one 7
favour 7
and 7
that 7
is 7
to 7
choose 7
the 7
manner 7
of 7
your 7
death 7
but 7
what 7
have 7
i 7
done 7
to 7
you 7
asked 7
the 7
fisherman 7
i 7
cannot 7
treat 7
you 7
in 7
any 7
other 7
way 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
would 7
know 7
why 7
listen 7
to 7
my 7
story 7
i 7
rebelled 7
against 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7
to 7
punish 7
me 7
he 7
shut 7
me 7
up 7
in 7
this 7
vase 7
of 7
copper 7
and 7
he 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
leaden 7
cover 7
his 7
seal 7
which 7
is 7
enchantment 7
enough 7
to 7
prevent 7
my 7
coming 7
out 7
then 7
he 7
had 7
the 7
vase 7
thrown 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
during 7
the 7
first 7
period 7
of 7
my 7
captivity 7
i 7
vowed 7
that 7
if 7
anyone 7
should 7
free 7
me 7
before 7
a 7
hundred 7
years 7
were 7
passed 7
i 7
would 7
make 7
him 7
rich 7
even 7
after 7
his 7
death 7
but 7
that 7
century 7
passed 7
and 7
no 7
one 7
freed 7
me 7
in 7
the 7
second 7
century 7
i 7
vowed 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
give 7
all 7
the 7
treasures 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
to 7
my 7
deliverer 7
but 7
he 7
never 7
came 7
in 7
the 7
third 7
i 7
promised 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
a 7
king 7
to 7
be 7
always 7
near 7
him 7
and 7
to 7
grant 7
him 7
three 7
wishes 7
every 7
day 7
but 7
that 7
century 7
passed 7
away 7
as 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
i 7
remained 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
plight 7
at 7
last 7
i 7
grew 7
angry 7
at 7
being 7
captive 7
for 7
so 7
long 7
and 7
i 7
vowed 7
that 7
if 7
anyone 7
would 7
release 7
me 7
i 7
would 7
kill 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
would 7
only 7
allow 7
him 7
to 7
choose 7
in 7
what 7
manner 7
he 7
should 7
die 7
so 7
you 7
see 7
as 7
you 7
have 7
freed 7
me 7
today 7
choose 7
in 7
what 7
way 7
you 7
will 7
die 7
the 7
fisherman 7
was 7
very 7
unhappy 7
what 7
an 7
unlucky 7
man 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
have 7
freed 7
you 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
to 7
spare 7
my 7
life 7
i 7
have 7
told 7
you 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
impossible 7
choose 7
quickly 7
you 7
are 7
wasting 7
time 7
the 7
fisherman 7
began 7
to 7
devise 7
a 7
plot 7
since 7
i 7
must 7
die 7
he 7
said 7
before 7
i 7
choose 7
the 7
manner 7
of 7
my 7
death 7
i 7
conjure 7
you 7
on 7
your 7
honour 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
if 7
you 7
really 7
were 7
in 7
that 7
vase 7
yes 7
i 7
was 7
answered 7
the 7
genius 7
i 7
really 7
cannot 7
believe 7
it 7
said 7
the 7
fisherman 7
that 7
vase 7
could 7
not 7
contain 7
one 7
of 7
your 7
feet 7
even 7
and 7
how 7
could 7
your 7
whole 7
body 7
go 7
in 7
i 7
cannot 7
believe 7
it 7
unless 7
i 7
see 7
you 7
do 7
the 7
thing 7
then 7
the 7
genius 7
began 7
to 7
change 7
himself 7
into 7
smoke 7
which 7
as 7
before 7
spread 7
over 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
the 7
shore 7
and 7
which 7
then 7
collecting 7
itself 7
together 7
began 7
to 7
go 7
back 7
into 7
the 7
vase 7
slowly 7
and 7
evenly 7
till 7
there 7
was 7
nothing 7
left 7
outside 7
then 7
a 7
voice 7
came 7
from 7
the 7
vase 7
which 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
fisherman 7
well 7
unbelieving 7
fisherman 7
here 7
i 7
am 7
in 7
the 7
vase 7
do 7
you 7
believe 7
me 7
now 7
the 7
fisherman 7
instead 7
of 7
answering 7
took 7
the 7
lid 7
of 7
lead 7
and 7
shut 7
it 7
down 7
quickly 7
on 7
the 7
vase 7
now 7
o 7
genius 7
he 7
cried 7
ask 7
pardon 7
of 7
me 7
and 7
choose 7
by 7
what 7
death 7
you 7
will 7
die 7
but 7
no 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
better 7
if 7
i 7
throw 7
you 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
whence 7
i 7
drew 7
you 7
out 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
build 7
a 7
house 7
on 7
the 7
shore 7
to 7
warn 7
fishermen 7
who 7
come 7
to 7
cast 7
their 7
nets 7
here 7
against 7
fishing 7
up 7
such 7
a 7
wicked 7
genius 7
as 7
you 7
are 7
who 7
vows 7
to 7
kill 7
the 7
man 7
who 7
frees 7
you 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
the 7
genius 7
did 7
all 7
he 7
could 7
to 7
get 7
out 7
but 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
because 7
of 7
the 7
enchantment 7
of 7
the 7
lid 7
then 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
get 7
out 7
by 7
cunning 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
take 7
off 7
the 7
cover 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
will 7
repay 7
you 7
no 7
answered 7
the 7
fisherman 7
if 7
i 7
trust 7
myself 7
to 7
you 7
i 7
am 7
afraid 7
you 7
will 7
treat 7
me 7
as 7
a 7
certain 7
greek 7
king 7
treated 7
the 7
physician 7
douban 7
listen 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
and 7
the 7
physician 7
douban 7
in 7
the 7
country 7
of 7
zouman 7
in 7
persia 7
there 7
lived 7
a 7
greek 7
king 7
this 7
king 7
was 7
a 7
leper 7
and 7
all 7
his 7
doctors 7
had 7
been 7
unable 7
to 7
cure 7
him 7
when 7
a 7
very 7
clever 7
physician 7
came 7
to 7
his 7
court 7
he 7
was 7
very 7
learned 7
in 7
all 7
languages 7
and 7
knew 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
about 7
herbs 7
and 7
medicines 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
told 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
illness 7
he 7
put 7
on 7
his 7
best 7
robe 7
and 7
presented 7
himself 7
before 7
the 7
king 7
sire 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
no 7
physician 7
has 7
been 7
able 7
to 7
cure 7
your 7
majesty 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
follow 7
my 7
instructions 7
i 7
will 7
promise 7
to 7
cure 7
you 7
without 7
any 7
medicines 7
or 7
outward 7
application 7
the 7
king 7
listened 7
to 7
this 7
proposal 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
clever 7
enough 7
to 7
do 7
this 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
promise 7
to 7
make 7
you 7
and 7
your 7
descendants 7
rich 7
for 7
ever 7
the 7
physician 7
went 7
to 7
his 7
house 7
and 7
made 7
a 7
polo 7
club 7
the 7
handle 7
of 7
which 7
he 7
hollowed 7
out 7
and 7
put 7
in 7
it 7
the 7
drug 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
use 7
then 7
he 7
made 7
a 7
ball 7
and 7
with 7
these 7
things 7
he 7
went 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
he 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
him 7
to 7
play 7
at 7
polo 7
accordingly 7
the 7
king 7
mounted 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
went 7
into 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
he 7
played 7
there 7
the 7
physician 7
approached 7
him 7
with 7
the 7
bat 7
he 7
had 7
made 7
saying 7
take 7
this 7
sire 7
and 7
strike 7
the 7
ball 7
till 7
you 7
feel 7
your 7
hand 7
and 7
whole 7
body 7
in 7
a 7
glow 7
when 7
the 7
remedy 7
that 7
is 7
in 7
the 7
handle 7
of 7
the 7
club 7
is 7
warmed 7
by 7
your 7
hand 7
it 7
will 7
penetrate 7
throughout 7
your 7
body 7
the 7
you 7
must 7
return 7
to 7
your 7
palace 7
bathe 7
and 7
go 7
to 7
sleep 7
and 7
when 7
you 7
awake 7
tomorrow 7
morning 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
cured 7
the 7
king 7
took 7
the 7
club 7
and 7
urged 7
his 7
horse 7
after 7
the 7
ball 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
thrown 7
he 7
struck 7
it 7
and 7
then 7
it 7
was 7
hit 7
back 7
by 7
the 7
courtiers 7
who 7
were 7
playing 7
with 7
him 7
when 7
he 7
felt 7
very 7
hot 7
he 7
stopped 7
playing 7
and 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
went 7
into 7
the 7
bath 7
and 7
did 7
all 7
that 7
the 7
physician 7
had 7
said 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
when 7
he 7
arose 7
he 7
found 7
to 7
his 7
great 7
joy 7
and 7
astonishment 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
completely 7
cured 7
when 7
he 7
entered 7
his 7
audiencechamber 7
all 7
his 7
courtiers 7
who 7
were 7
eager 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
the 7
wonderful 7
cure 7
had 7
been 7
effected 7
were 7
overwhelmed 7
with 7
joy 7
the 7
physician 7
douban 7
entered 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
bowed 7
low 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
the 7
king 7
seeing 7
him 7
called 7
him 7
made 7
him 7
sit 7
by 7
his 7
side 7
and 7
showed 7
him 7
every 7
mark 7
of 7
honour 7
that 7
evening 7
he 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
long 7
and 7
rich 7
robe 7
of 7
state 7
and 7
presented 7
him 7
with 7
two 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
he 7
continued 7
to 7
load 7
him 7
with 7
favours 7
now 7
the 7
king 7
had 7
a 7
grandvizir 7
who 7
was 7
avaricious 7
and 7
envious 7
and 7
a 7
very 7
bad 7
man 7
he 7
grew 7
extremely 7
jealous 7
of 7
the 7
physician 7
and 7
determined 7
to 7
bring 7
about 7
his 7
ruin 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
do 7
this 7
he 7
asked 7
to 7
speak 7
in 7
private 7
with 7
the 7
king 7
saying 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
most 7
important 7
communication 7
to 7
make 7
what 7
is 7
it 7
asked 7
the 7
king 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
it 7
is 7
most 7
dangerous 7
for 7
a 7
monarch 7
to 7
confide 7
in 7
a 7
man 7
whose 7
faithfulness 7
is 7
not 7
proved 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
that 7
this 7
physician 7
is 7
not 7
a 7
traitor 7
come 7
here 7
to 7
assassinate 7
you 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
said 7
the 7
king 7
that 7
this 7
man 7
is 7
the 7
most 7
faithful 7
and 7
virtuous 7
of 7
men 7
if 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
take 7
my 7
life 7
why 7
did 7
he 7
cure 7
me 7
cease 7
to 7
speak 7
against 7
him 7
i 7
see 7
what 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
are 7
jealous 7
of 7
him 7
but 7
do 7
not 7
think 7
that 7
i 7
can 7
be 7
turned 7
against 7
him 7
i 7
remember 7
well 7
what 7
a 7
vizir 7
said 7
to 7
king 7
sindbad 7
his 7
master 7
to 7
prevent 7
him 7
from 7
putting 7
the 7
prince 7
his 7
son 7
to 7
death 7
what 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
said 7
excited 7
the 7
vizirs 7
curiousity 7
and 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
sire 7
i 7
beg 7
your 7
majesty 7
to 7
have 7
the 7
condescension 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
the 7
vizir 7
said 7
to 7
king 7
sindbad 7
this 7
vizir 7
he 7
replied 7
told 7
king 7
sindbad 7
that 7
one 7
ought 7
not 7
believe 7
everything 7
that 7
a 7
motherinlaw 7
says 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
this 7
story 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
husband 7
and 7
the 7
parrot 7
a 7
good 7
man 7
had 7
a 7
beautiful 7
wife 7
whom 7
he 7
loved 7
passionately 7
and 7
never 7
left 7
if 7
possible 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
obliged 7
by 7
important 7
business 7
to 7
go 7
away 7
from 7
her 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
a 7
place 7
where 7
all 7
kinds 7
of 7
birds 7
are 7
sold 7
and 7
bought 7
a 7
parrot 7
this 7
parrot 7
not 7
only 7
spoke 7
well 7
but 7
it 7
had 7
the 7
gift 7
of 7
telling 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
been 7
done 7
before 7
it 7
he 7
brought 7
it 7
home 7
in 7
a 7
cage 7
and 7
asked 7
his 7
wife 7
to 7
put 7
it 7
in 7
her 7
room 7
and 7
take 7
great 7
care 7
of 7
it 7
while 7
he 7
was 7
away 7
then 7
he 7
departed 7
on 7
his 7
return 7
he 7
asked 7
the 7
parrot 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
during 7
his 7
absence 7
and 7
the 7
parrot 7
told 7
him 7
some 7
things 7
which 7
made 7
him 7
scold 7
his 7
wife 7
she 7
thought 7
that 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
slaves 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
telling 7
tales 7
of 7
her 7
but 7
they 7
told 7
her 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
parrot 7
and 7
she 7
resolved 7
to 7
revenge 7
herself 7
on 7
him 7
when 7
her 7
husband 7
next 7
went 7
away 7
for 7
one 7
day 7
she 7
told 7
on 7
slave 7
to 7
turn 7
under 7
the 7
birds 7
cage 7
a 7
handmill 7
another 7
to 7
throw 7
water 7
down 7
from 7
above 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
a 7
third 7
to 7
take 7
a 7
mirror 7
and 7
turn 7
it 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
its 7
eyes 7
from 7
left 7
to 7
right 7
by 7
the 7
light 7
of 7
a 7
candle 7
the 7
slaves 7
did 7
this 7
for 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
night 7
and 7
did 7
it 7
very 7
well 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
when 7
the 7
husband 7
came 7
back 7
he 7
asked 7
the 7
parrot 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
seen 7
the 7
bird 7
replied 7
my 7
good 7
master 7
the 7
lightning 7
thunder 7
and 7
rain 7
disturbed 7
me 7
so 7
much 7
all 7
night 7
long 7
that 7
i 7
cannot 7
tell 7
you 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
suffered 7
the 7
husband 7
who 7
knew 7
that 7
it 7
had 7
neither 7
rained 7
nor 7
thundered 7
in 7
the 7
night 7
was 7
convinced 7
that 7
the 7
parrot 7
was 7
not 7
speaking 7
the 7
truth 7
so 7
he 7
took 7
him 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
threw 7
him 7
so 7
roughly 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
that 7
he 7
killed 7
him 7
nevertheless 7
he 7
was 7
sorry 7
afterwards 7
for 7
he 7
found 7
that 7
the 7
parrot 7
had 7
spoken 7
the 7
truth 7
when 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
said 7
the 7
fisherman 7
to 7
the 7
genius 7
had 7
finished 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
parrot 7
he 7
added 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
and 7
so 7
vizir 7
i 7
shall 7
not 7
listen 7
to 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
shall 7
take 7
care 7
of 7
the 7
physician 7
in 7
case 7
i 7
repent 7
as 7
the 7
husband 7
did 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
killed 7
the 7
parrot 7
but 7
the 7
vizir 7
was 7
determined 7
sire 7
he 7
replied 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
the 7
parrot 7
was 7
nothing 7
but 7
when 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
question 7
of 7
the 7
life 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
it 7
is 7
better 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
the 7
innocent 7
than 7
save 7
the 7
guilty 7
it 7
is 7
no 7
uncertain 7
thing 7
however 7
the 7
physician 7
douban 7
wishes 7
to 7
assassinate 7
you 7
my 7
zeal 7
prompts 7
me 7
to 7
disclose 7
this 7
to 7
your 7
majesty 7
if 7
i 7
am 7
wrong 7
i 7
deserve 7
to 7
be 7
punished 7
as 7
a 7
vizir 7
was 7
once 7
punished 7
what 7
had 7
the 7
vizir 7
done 7
said 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
to 7
merit 7
the 7
punishment 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
your 7
majesty 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
do 7
me 7
the 7
honour 7
to 7
listen 7
answered 7
the 7
vizir 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
was 7
punished 7
there 7
was 7
once 7
upon 7
a 7
time 7
a 7
king 7
who 7
had 7
a 7
son 7
who 7
was 7
very 7
fond 7
of 7
hunting 7
he 7
often 7
allowed 7
him 7
to 7
indulge 7
in 7
this 7
pastime 7
but 7
he 7
had 7
ordered 7
his 7
grandvizir 7
always 7
to 7
go 7
with 7
him 7
and 7
never 7
to 7
lose 7
sight 7
of 7
him 7
one 7
day 7
the 7
huntsman 7
roused 7
a 7
stag 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
thinking 7
that 7
the 7
vizir 7
was 7
behind 7
gave 7
chase 7
and 7
rode 7
so 7
hard 7
that 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
alone 7
he 7
stopped 7
and 7
having 7
lost 7
sight 7
of 7
it 7
he 7
turned 7
to 7
rejoin 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
careful 7
enough 7
to 7
follow 7
him 7
but 7
he 7
lost 7
his 7
way 7
whilst 7
he 7
was 7
trying 7
to 7
find 7
it 7
he 7
saw 7
on 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
road 7
a 7
beautiful 7
lady 7
who 7
was 7
crying 7
bitterly 7
he 7
drew 7
his 7
horses 7
rein 7
and 7
asked 7
her 7
who 7
she 7
was 7
and 7
what 7
she 7
was 7
doing 7
in 7
this 7
place 7
and 7
if 7
she 7
needed 7
help 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
an 7
indian 7
king 7
she 7
answered 7
and 7
whilst 7
riding 7
in 7
the 7
country 7
i 7
fell 7
asleep 7
and 7
tumbled 7
off 7
my 7
horse 7
has 7
run 7
away 7
and 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
what 7
has 7
become 7
of 7
him 7
the 7
young 7
prince 7
had 7
pity 7
on 7
her 7
and 7
offered 7
to 7
take 7
her 7
behind 7
him 7
which 7
he 7
did 7
as 7
they 7
passed 7
by 7
a 7
ruined 7
building 7
the 7
lady 7
dismounted 7
and 7
went 7
in 7
the 7
prince 7
also 7
dismounted 7
and 7
followed 7
her 7
to 7
his 7
great 7
surprise 7
he 7
heard 7
her 7
saying 7
to 7
some 7
one 7
inside 7
rejoice 7
my 7
children 7
i 7
am 7
bringing 7
you 7
a 7
nice 7
fat 7
youth 7
and 7
other 7
voices 7
replied 7
where 7
is 7
he 7
mamma 7
that 7
we 7
may 7
eat 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
as 7
we 7
are 7
very 7
hungry 7
the 7
prince 7
at 7
once 7
saw 7
the 7
danger 7
he 7
was 7
in 7
he 7
now 7
knew 7
that 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
said 7
she 7
was 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
an 7
indian 7
king 7
was 7
an 7
ogress 7
who 7
lived 7
in 7
desolate 7
places 7
and 7
who 7
by 7
a 7
thousand 7
wiles 7
surprised 7
and 7
devoured 7
passersby 7
he 7
was 7
terrified 7
and 7
threw 7
himself 7
on 7
his 7
horse 7
the 7
pretended 7
princess 7
appeared 7
at 7
this 7
moment 7
and 7
seeing 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
lost 7
her 7
prey 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
do 7
not 7
be 7
afraid 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
want 7
i 7
am 7
lost 7
he 7
answered 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
looking 7
for 7
the 7
road 7
keep 7
straight 7
on 7
said 7
the 7
ogress 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
it 7
the 7
prince 7
could 7
hardly 7
believe 7
his 7
ears 7
and 7
rode 7
off 7
as 7
hard 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
he 7
found 7
his 7
way 7
and 7
arrived 7
safe 7
and 7
sound 7
at 7
his 7
fathers 7
house 7
where 7
he 7
told 7
him 7
of 7
the 7
danger 7
he 7
had 7
run 7
because 7
of 7
the 7
grandvizirs 7
carelessness 7
the 7
king 7
was 7
very 7
angry 7
and 7
had 7
him 7
strangled 7
immediately 7
sire 7
went 7
on 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
physician 7
douban 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
take 7
care 7
you 7
will 7
repent 7
of 7
having 7
trusted 7
him 7
who 7
knows 7
what 7
this 7
remedy 7
with 7
which 7
he 7
has 7
cured 7
you 7
may 7
not 7
in 7
time 7
have 7
a 7
bad 7
effect 7
on 7
you 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
was 7
naturally 7
very 7
weak 7
and 7
did 7
not 7
perceive 7
the 7
wicked 7
intention 7
of 7
his 7
vizir 7
nor 7
was 7
he 7
firm 7
enough 7
to 7
keep 7
to 7
his 7
first 7
resolution 7
well 7
vizir 7
he 7
said 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
perhaps 7
he 7
did 7
come 7
to 7
take 7
my 7
life 7
he 7
might 7
do 7
it 7
by 7
the 7
mere 7
smell 7
of 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
drugs 7
i 7
must 7
see 7
what 7
can 7
be 7
done 7
the 7
best 7
means 7
sire 7
to 7
put 7
your 7
life 7
in 7
security 7
is 7
to 7
send 7
for 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
his 7
head 7
directly 7
he 7
comes 7
said 7
the 7
vizir 7
i 7
really 7
think 7
replied 7
the 7
king 7
that 7
will 7
be 7
the 7
best 7
way 7
he 7
then 7
ordered 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
ministers 7
to 7
fetch 7
the 7
physician 7
who 7
came 7

myself 7
from 7
you 7
by 7
taking 7
your 7
life 7
the 7
physician 7
was 7
beyond 7
measure 7
astonished 7
when 7
he 7
heard 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
die 7
what 7
crimes 7

i 7
committed 7

majesty 7

have 7
learnt 7

the 7
king 7
that 7
you 7

a 7
spy 7
and 7

to 7

strong 7
guard 7
to 7
his 7
house 7
there 7
the 7
physician 7
put 7
his 7
affairs 7
in 7
order 7
and 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
great 7
crowd 7
assembled 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
to 7
see 7
his 7
death 7
and 7
the 7
doings 7
after 7
it 7
the 7
physician 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
throne 7
with 7
a 7
large 7
book 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
he 7
carried 7
a 7
basin 7
on 7
which 7
he 7
spread 7
the 7
covering 7
of 7
the 7
book 7
and 7
presenting 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
said 7
sire 7
take 7
this 7
book 7
and 7
when 7
my 7
head 7
is 7
cut 7
off 7
let 7
it 7
be 7
placed 7
in 7
the 7
basin 7
on 7
the 7
covering 7
of 7
this 7
book 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
there 7
the 7
blood 7
will 7
cease 7
to 7
flow 7
then 7
open 7
the 7
book 7
and 7
my 7
head 7
will 7
answer 7
your 7
questions 7
but 7
sire 7
i 7
implore 7
your 7
mercy 7
for 7
i 7
am 7
innocent 7
your 7
prayers 7
are 7
useless 7
and 7
if 7
it 7
were 7
only 7
to 7
hear 7
your 7
head 7
speak 7
when 7
you 7
are 7
dead 7
you 7
should 7
die 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
took 7
the 7
book 7
from 7
the 7
physicians 7
hands 7
and 7
ordered 7
the 7
executioner 7
to 7
do 7
his 7
duty 7
the 7
head 7
was 7
so 7
cleverly 7
cut 7
off 7
that 7
it 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
basin 7
and 7
directly 7
the 7
blood 7
ceased 7
to 7
flow 7
then 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
astonishment 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
the 7
eyes 7
opened 7
and 7
the 7
head 7
said 7
your 7
majesty 7
open 7
the 7
book 7
the 7
king 7
did 7
so 7
and 7
finding 7
that 7
the 7
first 7
leaf 7
stuck 7
against 7
the 7
second 7
he 7
put 7
his 7
finger 7
in 7
his 7
mouth 7
to 7
turn 7
it 7
more 7
easily 7
he 7
did 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
till 7
he 7
reached 7
the 7
sixth 7
page 7
and 7
not 7
seeing 7
any 7
writing 7
on 7
it 7
physician 7
he 7
said 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
writing 7
turn 7
over 7
a 7
few 7
more 7
pages 7
answered 7
the 7
head 7
the 7
king 7
went 7
on 7
turning 7
still 7
putting 7
his 7
finger 7
in 7
his 7
mouth 7
till 7
the 7
poison 7
in 7
which 7
each 7
page 7
was 7
dipped 7
took 7
effect 7
his 7
sight 7
failed 7
him 7
and 7
he 7
fell 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
his 7
throne 7
when 7
the 7
physicians 7
head 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
poison 7
had 7
taken 7
effect 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
king 7
had 7
only 7
a 7
few 7
more 7
minutes 7
to 7
live 7
tyrant 7
it 7
cried 7
see 7
how 7
cruelty 7
and 7
injustice 7
are 7
punished 7
scarcely 7
had 7
it 7
uttered 7
these 7
words 7
than 7
the 7
king 7
died 7
and 7
the 7
head 7
lost 7
also 7
the 7
little 7
life 7
that 7
had 7
remained 7
in 7
it 7
that 7
is 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
and 7
now 7
let 7
us 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
fisherman 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
if 7
the 7
greek 7
king 7
said 7
the 7
fisherman 7
had 7
spared 7
the 7
physician 7
he 7
would 7
not 7
have 7
thus 7
died 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
applies 7
to 7
you 7
now 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
to 7
throw 7
you 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
my 7
friend 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
do 7
not 7
do 7
such 7
a 7
cruel 7
thing 7
do 7
not 7
treat 7
me 7
as 7
imma 7
treated 7
ateca 7
what 7
did 7
imma 7
do 7
to 7
ateca 7
asked 7
the 7
fisherman 7
do 7
you 7
think 7
i 7
can 7
tell 7
you 7
while 7
i 7
am 7
shut 7
up 7
in 7
here 7
replied 7
the 7
genius 7
let 7
me 7
out 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
make 7
you 7
rich 7
the 7
hope 7
of 7
being 7
no 7
longer 7
poor 7
made 7
the 7
fisherman 7
give 7
way 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
me 7
your 7
promise 7
to 7
do 7
this 7
i 7
will 7
open 7
the 7
lid 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
think 7
you 7
will 7
dare 7
to 7
break 7
your 7
word 7
the 7
genius 7
promised 7
and 7
the 7
fisherman 7
lifted 7
the 7
lid 7
he 7
came 7
out 7
at 7
once 7
in 7
smoke 7
and 7
then 7
having 7
resumed 7
his 7
proper 7
form 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
he 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
kick 7
the 7
vase 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
this 7
frightened 7
the 7
fisherman 7
but 7
the 7
genius 7
laughed 7
and 7
said 7
do 7
not 7
be 7
afraid 7
i 7
only 7
did 7
it 7
to 7
frighten 7
you 7
and 7
to 7
show 7
you 7
that 7
i 7
intend 7
to 7
keep 7
my 7
word 7
take 7
your 7
nets 7
and 7
follow 7
me 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
walk 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
the 7
fisherman 7
who 7
followed 7
him 7
with 7
some 7
misgivings 7
they 7
passed 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
went 7
up 7
a 7
mountain 7
and 7
then 7
down 7
into 7
a 7
great 7
plain 7
where 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
large 7
lake 7
lying 7
between 7
four 7
hills 7
when 7
they 7
reached 7
the 7
lake 7
the 7
genius 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
fisherman 7
throw 7
your 7
nets 7
and 7
catch 7
fish 7
the 7
fisherman 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
told 7
hoping 7
for 7
a 7
good 7
catch 7
as 7
he 7
saw 7
plenty 7
of 7
fish 7
what 7
was 7
his 7
astonishment 7
at 7
seeing 7
that 7
there 7
were 7
four 7
quite 7
different 7
kinds 7
some 7
white 7
some 7
red 7
some 7
blue 7
and 7
some 7
yellow 7
he 7
caught 7
four 7
one 7
of 7
each 7
colour 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
never 7
seen 7
any 7
like 7
them 7
he 7
admired 7
them 7
very 7
much 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
very 7
pleased 7
to 7
think 7
how 7
much 7
money 7
he 7
would 7
get 7
for 7
them 7
take 7
these 7
fish 7
and 7
carry 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
more 7
money 7
for 7
them 7
than 7
you 7
have 7
ever 7
had 7
in 7
your 7
life 7
you 7
can 7
come 7
every 7
day 7
to 7
fish 7
in 7
this 7
lake 7
but 7
be 7
careful 7
not 7
to 7
throw 7
your 7
nets 7
more 7
than 7
once 7
every 7
day 7
otherwise 7
some 7
harm 7
will 7
happen 7
to 7
you 7
if 7
you 7
follow 7
my 7
advice 7
carefully 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
it 7
good 7
saying 7
these 7
words 7
he 7
struck 7
his 7
foot 7
against 7
the 7
ground 7
which 7
opened 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
disappeared 7
it 7
closed 7
immediately 7
the 7
fisherman 7
resolved 7
to 7
obey 7
the 7
genius 7
exactly 7
so 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
cast 7
his 7
nets 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
but 7
walked 7
into 7
the 7
town 7
to 7
sell 7
his 7
fish 7
at 7
the 7
palace 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
saw 7
the 7
fish 7
he 7
was 7
much 7
astonished 7
he 7
looked 7
at 7
them 7
one 7
after 7
the 7
other 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
admired 7
them 7
long 7
enough 7
take 7
these 7
fish 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
his 7
first 7
vizir 7
and 7
given 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
clever 7
cook 7
the 7
emperor 7
of 7
the 7
greeks 7
sent 7
me 7
i 7
think 7
they 7
must 7
be 7
as 7
good 7
as 7
they 7
are 7
beautiful 7
the 7
vizir 7
took 7
them 7
himself 7
to 7
the 7
cook 7
saying 7
here 7
are 7
four 7
fish 7
that 7
have 7
been 7
brought 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
he 7
wants 7
you 7
to 7
cook 7
them 7
then 7
he 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
told 7
him 7
to 7
give 7
the 7
fisherman 7
four 7
hundred 7
gold 7
pieces 7
the 7
fisherman 7
who 7
had 7
never 7
before 7
possessed 7
such 7
a 7
large 7
sum 7
of 7
money 7
at 7
once 7
could 7
hardly 7
believe 7
his 7
good 7
fortune 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
relieved 7
the 7
needs 7
of 7
his 7
family 7
and 7
made 7
good 7
use 7
of 7
it 7
but 7
now 7
we 7
must 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
kitchen 7
which 7
we 7
shall 7
find 7
in 7
great 7
confusion 7
the 7
cook 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
cleaned 7
the 7
fish 7
put 7
them 7
in 7
a 7
pan 7
with 7
some 7
oil 7
to 7
fry 7
them 7
when 7
she 7
thought 7
them 7
cooked 7
enough 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
she 7
turned 7
them 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
but 7
scarcely 7
had 7
she 7
done 7
so 7
when 7
the 7
walls 7
of 7
the 7
kitchen 7
opened 7
and 7
there 7
came 7
out 7
a 7
young 7
and 7
beautiful 7
damsel 7
she 7
was 7
dressed 7
in 7
an 7
egyptian 7
dress 7
of 7
flowered 7
satin 7
and 7
she 7
wore 7
earrings 7
and 7
a 7
necklace 7
of 7
white 7
pearls 7
and 7
bracelets 7
of 7
gold 7
set 7
with 7
rubies 7
and 7
she 7
held 7
a 7
wand 7
of 7
myrtle 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
she 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
pan 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
astonishment 7
of 7
the 7
cook 7
who 7
stood 7
motionless 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
her 7
she 7
struck 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
fish 7
with 7
her 7
rod 7
fish 7
fish 7
said 7
she 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
your 7
duty 7
the 7
fish 7
answered 7
nothing 7
and 7
then 7
she 7
repeated 7
her 7
question 7
whereupon 7
they 7
all 7
raised 7
their 7
heads 7
together 7
and 7
answered 7
very 7
distinctly 7
yes 7
yes 7
if 7
you 7
reckon 7
we 7
reckon 7
if 7
you 7
pay 7
your 7
debts 7
we 7
pay 7
ours 7
if 7
you 7
fly 7
we 7
conquer 7
and 7
we 7
are 7
content 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
spoken 7
the 7
girl 7
upset 7
the 7
pan 7
and 7
entered 7
the 7
opening 7
in 7
the 7
wall 7
which 7
at 7
once 7
closed 7
and 7
appeared 7
the 7
same 7
as 7
before 7
when 7
the 7
cook 7
had 7
recovered 7
from 7
her 7
fright 7
she 7
lifted 7
up 7
the 7
fish 7
which 7
had 7
fallen 7
into 7
the 7
ashes 7
but 7
she 7
found 7
them 7
as 7
black 7
as 7
cinders 7
and 7
not 7
fit 7
to 7
serve 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
she 7
began 7
to 7
cry 7
alas 7
what 7
shall 7
i 7
say 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
he 7
will 7
be 7
so 7
angry 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
know 7
he 7
will 7
not 7
believe 7
me 7
whilst 7
she 7
was 7
crying 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
came 7
in 7
and 7
asked 7
if 7
the 7
fish 7
were 7
ready 7
she 7
told 7
him 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
happened 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
much 7
surprised 7
he 7
sent 7
at 7
once 7
for 7
the 7
fisherman 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
came 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
fisherman 7
bring 7
me 7
four 7
more 7
fish 7
like 7
you 7
have 7
brought 7
already 7
for 7
an 7
accident 7
has 7
happened 7
to 7
them 7
so 7
that 7
they 7
cannot 7
be 7
served 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
fisherman 7
did 7
not 7
say 7
what 7
the 7
genius 7
had 7
told 7
him 7
but 7
he 7
excused 7
himself 7
from 7
bringing 7
them 7
that 7
day 7
on 7
account 7
of 7
the 7
length 7
of 7
the 7
way 7
and 7
he 7
promised 7
to 7
bring 7
them 7
next 7
day 7
in 7
the 7
night 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
lake 7
cast 7
his 7
nets 7
and 7
on 7
drawing 7
them 7
in 7
found 7
four 7
fish 7
which 7
were 7
like 7
the 7
others 7
each 7
of 7
a 7
different 7
colour 7
he 7
went 7
back 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
carried 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
promised 7
he 7
then 7
took 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
kitchen 7
and 7
shut 7
himself 7
up 7
with 7
the 7
cook 7
who 7
began 7
to 7
cook 7
them 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
done 7
the 7
four 7
others 7
on 7
the 7
previous 7
day 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
turn 7
them 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
side 7
the 7
wall 7
opened 7
the 7
damsel 7
appeared 7
addressed 7
the 7
same 7
words 7
to 7
the 7
fish 7
received 7
the 7
same 7
answer 7
and 7
then 7
overturned 7
the 7
pan 7
and 7
disappeared 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
astonishment 7
i 7
shall 7
tell 7
the 7
sultan 7
all 7
that 7
has 7
happened 7
said 7
he 7
and 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
very 7
much 7
astounded 7
and 7
wished 7
to 7
see 7
this 7
marvel 7
for 7
himself 7
so 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
fisherman 7
and 7
asked 7
him 7
to 7
procure 7
four 7
more 7
fish 7
the 7
fisherman 7
asked 7
for 7
three 7
days 7
which 7
were 7
granted 7
and 7
he 7
then 7
cast 7
his 7
nets 7
in 7
the 7
lake 7
and 7
again 7
caught 7
four 7
different 7
coloured 7
fish 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
he 7
had 7
got 7
them 7
and 7
gave 7
him 7
again 7
four 7
hundred 7
gold 7
pieces 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
the 7
fish 7
he 7
had 7
them 7
carried 7
to 7
his 7
room 7
with 7
all 7
that 7
was 7
needed 7
to 7
cook 7
them 7
then 7
he 7
shut 7
himself 7
up 7
with 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
who 7
began 7
to 7
prepare 7
them 7
and 7
cook 7
them 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
done 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
he 7
turned 7
them 7
over 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
then 7
the 7
wall 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
opened 7
but 7
instead 7
of 7
the 7
maiden 7
a 7
black 7
slave 7
came 7
out 7
he 7
was 7
enormously 7
tall 7
and 7
carried 7
a 7
large 7
green 7
stick 7
with 7
which 7
he 7
touched 7
the 7
fish 7
saying 7
in 7
a 7
terrible 7
voice 7
fish 7
fish 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
your 7
duty 7
to 7
these 7
words 7
the 7
fish 7
lifting 7
up 7
their 7
heads 7
replied 7
yes 7
yes 7
if 7
you 7
reckon 7
we 7
reckon 7
if 7
you 7
pay 7
your 7
debts 7
we 7
pay 7
ours 7
if 7
you 7
fly 7
we 7
conquer 7
and 7
are 7
content 7
the 7
black 7
slave 7
overturned 7
the 7
pan 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
the 7
fish 7
were 7
turned 7
to 7
cinders 7
then 7
he 7
stepped 7
proudly 7
back 7
into 7
the 7
wall 7
which 7
closed 7
round 7
him 7
after 7
having 7
seen 7
this 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
cannot 7
rest 7
these 7
fish 7
signify 7
some 7
mystery 7
i 7
must 7
clear 7
up 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
fisherman 7
fisherman 7
he 7
said 7
the 7
fish 7
you 7
have 7
brought 7
us 7
have 7
caused 7
me 7
some 7
anxiety 7
where 7
did 7
you 7
get 7
them 7
from 7
sire 7
he 7
answered 7
i 7
got 7
them 7
from 7
a 7
lake 7
which 7
lies 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
four 7
hills 7
beyond 7
yonder 7
mountains 7
do 7
you 7
know 7
this 7
lake 7
asked 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
no 7
though 7
i 7
have 7
hunted 7
many 7
times 7
round 7
that 7
mountain 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
heard 7
of 7
it 7
said 7
the 7
vizir 7
as 7
the 7
fisherman 7
said 7
it 7
was 7
only 7
three 7
hours 7
journey 7
away 7
the 7
sultan 7
ordered 7
his 7
whole 7
court 7
to 7
mount 7
and 7
ride 7
thither 7
and 7
the 7
fisherman 7
led 7
them 7
they 7
climbed 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
then 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
side 7
saw 7
the 7
lake 7
as 7
the 7
fisherman 7
had 7
described 7
the 7
water 7
was 7
so 7
clear 7
that 7
they 7
could 7
see 7
the 7
four 7
kinds 7
of 7
fish 7
swimming 7
about 7
in 7
it 7
they 7
looked 7
at 7
them 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
sultan 7
ordered 7
them 7
to 7
make 7
a 7
camp 7
by 7
the 7
edge 7
of 7
the 7
water 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
the 7
sultan 7
called 7
his 7
vizir 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
i 7
have 7
resolved 7
to 7
clear 7
up 7
this 7
mystery 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
out 7
alone 7
and 7
do 7
you 7
stay 7
here 7
in 7
my 7
tent 7
and 7
when 7
my 7
ministers 7
come 7
tomorrow 7
say 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
well 7
and 7
cannot 7
see 7
them 7
do 7
this 7
each 7
day 7
till 7
i 7
return 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
tried 7
to 7
persuade 7
the 7
sultan 7
not 7
to 7
go 7
but 7
in 7
vain 7
the 7
sultan 7
took 7
off 7
his 7
state 7
robe 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
his 7
sword 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
all 7
was 7
quiet 7
in 7
the 7
camp 7
he 7
set 7
forth 7
alone 7
he 7
climbed 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
hills 7
and 7
then 7
crossed 7
the 7
great 7
plain 7
till 7
just 7
as 7
the 7
sun 7
rose 7
he 7
beheld 7
far 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
him 7
a 7
large 7
building 7
when 7
he 7
came 7
near 7
to 7
it 7
he 7
saw 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
splendid 7
palace 7
of 7
beautiful 7
black 7
polished 7
marble 7
covered 7
with 7
steel 7
as 7
smooth 7
as 7
a 7
mirror 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
gate 7
which 7
stood 7
half 7
open 7
and 7
went 7
in 7
as 7
nobody 7
came 7
when 7
he 7
knocked 7
he 7
passed 7
through 7
a 7
magnificent 7
courtyard 7
and 7
still 7
saw 7
no 7
one 7
though 7
he 7
called 7
aloud 7
several 7
times 7
he 7
entered 7
large 7
halls 7
where 7
the 7
carpets 7
were 7
of 7
silk 7
the 7
lounges 7
and 7
sofas 7
covered 7
with 7
tapestry 7
from 7
mecca 7
and 7
the 7
hangings 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
indian 7
stuffs 7
of 7
gold 7
and 7
silver 7
then 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
in 7
a 7
splendid 7
room 7
with 7
a 7
fountain 7
supported 7
by 7
golden 7
lions 7
the 7
water 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
lions 7
mouths 7
turned 7
into 7
diamonds 7
and 7
pearls 7
and 7
the 7
leaping 7
water 7
almost 7
touched 7
a 7
most 7
beautifullypainted 7
dome 7
the 7
palace 7
was 7
surrounded 7
on 7
three 7
sides 7
by 7
magnificent 7
gardens 7
little 7
lakes 7
and 7
woods 7
birds 7
sang 7
in 7
the 7
trees 7
which 7
were 7
netted 7
over 7
to 7
keep 7
them 7
always 7
there 7
still 7
the 7
sultan 7
saw 7
no 7
one 7
till 7
he 7
heard 7
a 7
plaintive 7
cry 7
and 7
a 7
voice 7
which 7
said 7
oh 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
die 7
for 7
i 7
am 7
too 7
unhappy 7
to 7
wish 7
to 7
live 7
any 7
longer 7
the 7
sultan 7
looked 7
round 7
to 7
discover 7
who 7
it 7
was 7
who 7
thus 7
bemoaned 7
his 7
fate 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
saw 7
a 7
handsome 7
young 7
man 7
richly 7
clothed 7
who 7
was 7
sitting 7
on 7
a 7
throne 7
raised 7
slightly 7
from 7
the 7
ground 7
his 7
face 7
was 7
very 7
sad 7
the 7
sultan 7
approached 7
him 7
and 7
bowed 7
to 7
him 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
bent 7
his 7
head 7
very 7
low 7
but 7
did 7
not 7
rise 7
sire 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
cannot 7
rise 7
and 7
do 7
you 7
the 7
reverence 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
should 7
be 7
paid 7
to 7
your 7
rank 7
sir 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
you 7
have 7
a 7
good 7
reason 7
for 7
not 7
doing 7
so 7
and 7
having 7
heard 7
your 7
cry 7
of 7
distress 7
i 7
am 7
come 7
to 7
offer 7
you 7
my 7
help 7
whose 7
is 7
this 7
palace 7
and 7
why 7
is 7
it 7
thus 7
empty 7
instead 7
of 7
answering 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
lifted 7
up 7
his 7
robe 7
and 7
showed 7
the 7
sultan 7
that 7
from 7
the 7
waist 7
downwards 7
he 7
was 7
a 7
block 7
of 7
black 7
marble 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
horrified 7
and 7
begged 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
to 7
tell 7
him 7
his 7
story 7
willingly 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
my 7
sad 7
history 7
said 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
black 7
isles 7
you 7
must 7
know 7
sire 7
that 7
my 7
father 7
was 7
mahmoud 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
this 7
country 7
the 7
black 7
isles 7
so 7
called 7
from 7
the 7
four 7
little 7
mountains 7
which 7
were 7
once 7
islands 7
while 7
the 7
capital 7
was 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
now 7
the 7
great 7
lake 7
lies 7
my 7
story 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
how 7
these 7
changes 7
came 7
about 7
my 7
father 7
died 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
sixtysix 7
and 7
i 7
succeeded 7
him 7
i 7
married 7
my 7
cousin 7
whom 7
i 7
loved 7
tenderly 7
and 7
i 7
thought 7
she 7
loved 7
me 7
too 7
but 7
one 7
afternoon 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
half 7
asleep 7
and 7
was 7
being 7
fanned 7
by 7
two 7
of 7
her 7
maids 7
i 7
heard 7
one 7
say 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
what 7
a 7
pity 7
it 7
is 7
that 7
our 7
mistress 7
no 7
longer 7
loves 7
our 7
master 7
i 7
believe 7
she 7
would 7
like 7
to 7
kill 7
him 7
if 7
she 7
could 7
for 7
she 7
is 7
an 7
enchantress 7
i 7
soon 7
found 7
by 7
watching 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
right 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
mortally 7
wounded 7
a 7
favourite 7
slave 7
of 7
hers 7
for 7
a 7
great 7
crime 7
she 7
begged 7
that 7
she 7
might 7
build 7
a 7
palace 7
in 7
the 7
garden 7
where 7
she 7
wept 7
and 7
bewailed 7
him 7
for 7
two 7
years 7
at 7
last 7
i 7
begged 7
her 7
to 7
cease 7
grieving 7
for 7
him 7
for 7
although 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
speak 7
or 7
move 7
by 7
her 7
enchantments 7
she 7
just 7
kept 7
him 7
alive 7
she 7
turned 7
upon 7
me 7
in 7
a 7
rage 7
and 7
said 7
over 7
me 7
some 7
magic 7
words 7
and 7
i 7
instantly 7
became 7
as 7
you 7
see 7
me 7
now 7
half 7
man 7
and 7
half 7
marble 7
then 7
this 7
wicked 7
enchantress 7
changed 7
the 7
capital 7
which 7
was 7
a 7
very 7
populous 7
and 7
flourishing 7
city 7
into 7
the 7
lake 7
and 7
desert 7
plain 7
you 7
saw 7
the 7
fish 7
of 7
four 7
colours 7
which 7
are 7
in 7
it 7
are 7
the 7
different 7
races 7
who 7
lived 7
in 7
the 7
town 7
the 7
four 7
hills 7
are 7
the 7
four 7
islands 7
which 7
give 7
the 7
name 7
to 7
my 7
kingdom 7
all 7
this 7
the 7
enchantress 7
told 7
me 7
to 7
add 7
to 7
my 7
troubles 7
and 7
this 7
is 7
not 7
all 7
every 7
day 7
she 7
comes 7
and 7
beats 7
me 7
with 7
a 7
whip 7
of 7
buffalo 7
hide 7
when 7
the 7
young 7
king 7
had 7
finished 7
his 7
sad 7
story 7
he 7
burst 7
once 7
more 7
into 7
tears 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
much 7
moved 7
tell 7
me 7
he 7
cried 7
where 7
is 7
this 7
wicked 7
woman 7
and 7
where 7
is 7
the 7
miserable 7
object 7
of 7
her 7
affection 7
whom 7
she 7
just 7
manages 7
to 7
keep 7
alive 7
where 7
she 7
lives 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
answered 7
the 7
unhappy 7
prince 7
but 7
she 7
goes 7
every 7
day 7
at 7
sunrise 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
the 7
slave 7
can 7
yet 7
speak 7
to 7
her 7
after 7
she 7
has 7
beaten 7
me 7
unfortunate 7
king 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
what 7
i 7
can 7
to 7
avenge 7
you 7
so 7
he 7
consulted 7
with 7
the 7
young 7
king 7
over 7
the 7
best 7
way 7
to 7
bring 7
this 7
about 7
and 7
they 7
agreed 7
their 7
plan 7
should 7
be 7
put 7
in 7
effect 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
sultan 7
then 7
rested 7
and 7
the 7
young 7
king 7
gave 7
himself 7
up 7
to 7
happy 7
hopes 7
of 7
release 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
sultan 7
arose 7
and 7
then 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
in 7
the 7
garden 7
where 7
the 7
black 7
slave 7
was 7
he 7
drew 7
his 7
sword 7
and 7
destroyed 7
the 7
little 7
life 7
that 7
remained 7
in 7
him 7
and 7
then 7
threw 7
the 7
body 7
down 7
a 7
well 7
he 7
then 7
lay 7
down 7
on 7
the 7
couch 7
where 7
the 7
slave 7
had 7
been 7
and 7
waited 7
for 7
the 7
enchantress 7
she 7
went 7
first 7
to 7
the 7
young 7
king 7
whom 7
she 7
beat 7
with 7
a 7
hundred 7
blows 7
then 7
she 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
room 7
where 7
she 7
thought 7
her 7
wounded 7
slave 7
was 7
but 7
where 7
the 7
sultan 7
really 7
lay 7
she 7
came 7
near 7
his 7
couch 7
and 7
said 7
are 7
you 7
better 7
today 7
my 7
dear 7
slave 7
speak 7
but 7
one 7
word 7
to 7
me 7
how 7
can 7
i 7
be 7
better 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
imitating 7
the 7
language 7
of 7
the 7
ethiopians 7
when 7
i 7
can 7
never 7
sleep 7
for 7
the 7
cries 7
and 7
groans 7
of 7
your 7
husband 7
what 7
joy 7
to 7
hear 7
you 7
speak 7
answered 7
the 7
queen 7
do 7
you 7
wish 7
him 7
to 7
regain 7
his 7
proper 7
shape 7
yes 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
hasten 7
to 7
set 7
him 7
at 7
liberty 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
no 7
longer 7
hear 7
his 7
cries 7
the 7
queen 7
at 7
once 7
went 7
out 7
and 7
took 7
a 7
cup 7
of 7
water 7
and 7
said 7
over 7
it 7
some 7
words 7
that 7
made 7
it 7
boil 7
as 7
if 7
it 7
were 7
on 7
the 7
fire 7
then 7
she 7
threw 7
it 7
over 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
at 7
once 7
regained 7
his 7
own 7
form 7
he 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
joy 7
but 7
the 7
enchantress 7
said 7
hasten 7
away 7
from 7
this 7
place 7
and 7
never 7
come 7
back 7
lest 7
i 7
kill 7
you 7
so 7
he 7
hid 7
himself 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
plan 7
the 7
enchantress 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
tears 7
and 7
said 7
now 7
i 7
have 7
done 7
what 7
you 7
wished 7
what 7
you 7
have 7
done 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
is 7
not 7
enough 7
to 7
cure 7
me 7
every 7
day 7
at 7
midnight 7
all 7
the 7
people 7
whom 7
you 7
have 7
changed 7
into 7
fish 7
lift 7
their 7
heads 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
lake 7
and 7
cry 7
for 7
vengeance 7
go 7
quickly 7
and 7
give 7
them 7
their 7
proper 7
shape 7
the 7
enchantress 7

away 7
and 7
said 7
some 7
words 7
over 7
the 7
lake 7
the 7
fish 7
then 7
became 7
men 7
women 7

he 7
sprang 7
up 7
and 7
with 7
one 7
blow 7
of 7
his 7
sword 7
he 7
cut 7
her 7

an 7
intelligent 7
and 7
sensible 7
man 7
one 7
morning 7
he 7
was 7
sitting 7

place 7
with 7

basket 7
before 7

the 7
porter 7
who 7
was 7
greatly 7
pleased 7
by 7
her 7
appearance 7
and 7
voice 7
jumped 7
up 7
at 7
once 7
poised 7
his 7
basket 7
on 7
his 7
head 7
and 7

to 7
whom 7
the 7
lady 7
held 7
out 7
money 7
without 7
speaking 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
who 7
seemed 7
to 7
understand 7
what 7
she 7
wanted 7
vanished 7
into 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
returned 7
bringing 7
a 7
large 7
jar 7
of 7
wine 7
which 7
the 7
porter 7
placed 7
in 7
his 7
basket 7
then 7
the 7

a 7
grocers 7
and 7
a 7
poulterers 7
till 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
porter 7
exclaimed 7
in 7
despair 7
my 7
good 7
lady 7
if 7
you 7
had 7
only 7
told 7
me 7
you 7
were 7
going 7
to 7
buy 7
enough 7
provisions 7
to 7
stock 7
a 7
town 7
i 7
would 7
have 7
brought 7
a 7
horse 7
or 7
rather 7
a 7
camel 7
the 7
lady 7
laughed 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
she 7
had 7
not 7
finished 7
yet 7
but 7
after 7
choosing 7
various 7
kinds 7
of 7
scents 7
and 7
spices 7
from 7
a 7
druggists 7
store 7
she 7
halted 7
before 7
a 7
magnificent 7
palace 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
which 7
she 7
knocked 7
gently 7
the 7
porteress 7
who 7
opened 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
such 7
beauty 7
that 7
the 7
eyes 7
of 7
the 7
man 7
were 7
quite 7
dazzled 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
the 7
more 7
astonished 7
as 7
he 7
saw 7
clearly 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
no 7
slave 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
had 7
led 7
him 7
hither 7
stood 7
watching 7
him 7
with 7
amusement 7
till 7
the 7
porteress 7
exclaimed 7
why 7
dont 7
you 7
come 7
in 7
my 7
sister 7
this 7
poor 7
man 7
is 7
so 7
heavily 7
weighed 7
down 7
that 7
he 7
is 7
ready 7
to 7
drop 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
both 7
inside 7
the 7
door 7
was 7
fastened 7
and 7
they 7
all 7
three 7
entered 7
a 7
large 7
court 7
surrounded 7
by 7
an 7
openwork 7
gallery 7
at 7
one 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
court 7
was 7
a 7
platform 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
platform 7
stood 7
an 7
amber 7
throne 7
supported 7
by 7
four 7
ebony 7
columns 7
garnished 7
with 7
pearls 7
and 7
diamonds 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
court 7
stood 7
a 7
marble 7
basin 7
filled 7
with 7
water 7
from 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
a 7
golden 7
lion 7
the 7
porter 7
looked 7
about 7
him 7
noticing 7
and 7
admiring 7
everything 7
but 7
his 7
attention 7
was 7
specially 7
attracted 7
by 7
a 7
third 7
lady 7
sitting 7
on 7
the 7
throne 7
who 7
was 7
even 7
more 7
beautiful 7
than 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
by 7
the 7
respect 7
shown 7
to 7
her 7
by 7
the 7
others 7
he 7
judged 7
that 7
she 7
must 7
be 7
the 7
eldest 7
and 7
in 7
this 7
he 7
was 7
right 7
this 7
ladys 7
name 7
was 7
zobeida 7
the 7
porteress 7
was 7
sadie 7
and 7
the 7
housekeeper 7
was 7
amina 7
at 7
a 7
word 7
from 7
zobeida 7
sadie 7
and 7
amina 7
took 7
the 7
basket 7
from 7
the 7
porter 7
who 7
was 7
glad 7
enough 7
to 7
be 7
relieved 7
from 7
its 7
weight 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
emptied 7
paid 7
him 7
handsomely 7
for 7
its 7
use 7
but 7
instead 7
of 7
taking 7
up 7
his 7
basket 7
and 7
going 7
away 7
the 7
man 7
still 7
lingered 7
till 7
zobeida 7
inquired 7
what 7
he 7
was 7
waiting 7
for 7
and 7
if 7
he 7
expected 7
more 7
money 7
oh 7
madam 7
returned 7
he 7
you 7
have 7
already 7
given 7
me 7
too 7
much 7
and 7
i 7
fear 7
i 7
may 7
have 7
been 7
guilty 7
of 7
rudeness 7
in 7
not 7
taking 7
my 7
departure 7
at 7
once 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
pardon 7
my 7
saying 7
so 7
i 7
was 7
lost 7
in 7
astonishment 7
at 7
seeing 7
such 7
beautiful 7
ladies 7
by 7
themselves 7
a 7
company 7
of 7
women 7
without 7
men 7
is 7
however 7
as 7
dull 7
as 7
a 7
company 7
of 7
men 7
without 7
women 7
and 7
after 7
telling 7
some 7
stories 7
to 7
prove 7
his 7
point 7
he 7
ended 7
by 7
entreating 7
them 7
to 7
let 7
him 7
stay 7
and 7
make 7
a 7
fourth 7
at 7
their 7
dinner 7
the 7
ladies 7
were 7
rather 7
amused 7
at 7
the 7
mans 7
assurances 7
and 7
after 7
some 7
discussion 7
it 7
was 7
agreed 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
be 7
allowed 7
to 7
stay 7
as 7
his 7
society 7
might 7
prove 7
entertaining 7
but 7
listen 7
friend 7
said 7
zobeida 7
if 7
we 7
grant 7
your 7
request 7
it 7
is 7
only 7
on 7
condition 7
that 7
you 7
behave 7
with 7
the 7
utmost 7
politeness 7
and 7
that 7
you 7
keep 7
the 7
secret 7
of 7
our 7
way 7
of 7
living 7
which 7
chance 7
has 7
revealed 7
to 7
you 7
then 7
they 7
all 7
sat 7
down 7
to 7
table 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
covered 7
by 7
amina 7
with 7
the 7
dishes 7
she 7
had 7
bought 7
after 7
the 7
first 7
few 7
mouthfuls 7
amina 7
poured 7
some 7
wine 7
into 7
a 7
golden 7
cup 7
she 7
first 7
drank 7
herself 7
according 7
to 7
the 7
arab 7
custom 7
and 7
then 7
filled 7
it 7
for 7
her 7
sisters 7
when 7
it 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
porters 7
turn 7
he 7
kissed 7
aminas 7
hand 7
and 7
sang 7
a 7
song 7
which 7
he 7
composed 7
at 7
the 7
moment 7
in 7
praise 7
of 7
the 7
wine 7
the 7
three 7
ladies 7
were 7
pleased 7
with 7
the 7
song 7
and 7
then 7
sang 7
themselves 7
so 7
that 7
the 7
repast 7
was 7
a 7
merry 7
one 7
and 7
lasted 7
much 7
longer 7
than 7
usual 7
at 7
length 7
seeing 7
that 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
set 7
sadia 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
porter 7
rise 7
and 7
go 7
it 7
is 7
now 7
time 7
for 7
us 7
to 7
separate 7
oh 7
madam 7
replied 7
he 7
how 7
can 7
you 7
desire 7
me 7
to 7
quit 7
you 7
in 7
the 7
state 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
am 7
between 7
the 7
wine 7
i 7
have 7
drunk 7
and 7
the 7
pleasure 7
of 7
seeing 7
you 7
i 7
should 7
never 7
find 7
the 7
way 7
to 7
my 7
house 7
let 7
me 7
remain 7
here 7
till 7
morning 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
have 7
recovered 7
my 7
senses 7
i 7
will 7
go 7
when 7
you 7
like 7
let 7
him 7
stay 7
said 7
amina 7
who 7
had 7
before 7
proved 7
herself 7
his 7
friend 7
it 7
is 7
only 7
just 7
as 7
he 7
has 7
given 7
us 7
so 7
much 7
amusement 7
if 7
you 7
wish 7
it 7
my 7
sister 7
replied 7
zobeida 7
but 7
if 7
he 7
does 7
i 7
must 7
make 7
a 7
new 7
condition 7
porter 7
she 7
continued 7
turning 7
to 7
him 7
if 7
you 7
remain 7
you 7
must 7
promise 7
to 7
ask 7
no 7
questions 7
about 7
anything 7
you 7
may 7
see 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
you 7
may 7
perhaps 7
hear 7
what 7
you 7
dont 7
like 7
this 7
being 7
settled 7
amina 7
brought 7
in 7
supper 7
and 7
lit 7
up 7
the 7
hall 7
with 7
a 7
number 7
of 7
sweet 7
smelling 7
tapers 7
they 7
then 7
sat 7
down 7
again 7
at 7
the 7
table 7
and 7
began 7
with 7
fresh 7
appetites 7
to 7
eat 7
drink 7
sing 7
and 7
recite 7
verses 7
in 7
fact 7
they 7
were 7
all 7
enjoying 7
themselves 7
mightily 7
when 7
they 7
heard 7
a 7
knock 7
at 7
the 7
outer 7
door 7
which 7
sadie 7
rose 7
to 7
open 7
she 7
soon 7
returned 7
saying 7
that 7
three 7
calenders 7
all 7
blind 7
in 7
the 7
right 7
eye 7
and 7
all 7
with 7
their 7
heads 7
faces 7
and 7
eyebrows 7
clean 7
shaved 7
begged 7
for 7
admittance 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
newly 7
arrived 7
in 7
bagdad 7
and 7
night 7
had 7
already 7
fallen 7
they 7
seem 7
to 7
have 7
pleasant 7
manners 7
she 7
added 7
but 7
you 7
have 7
no 7
idea 7
how 7
funny 7
they 7
look 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
we 7
should 7
find 7
their 7
company 7
diverting 7
zobeida 7
and 7
amina 7
made 7
some 7
difficulty 7
about 7
admitting 7
the 7
new 7
comers 7
and 7
sadie 7
knew 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
their 7
hesitation 7
but 7
she 7
urged 7
the 7
matter 7
so 7
strongly 7
that 7
zobeida 7
was 7
at 7
last 7
forced 7
to 7
consent 7
bring 7
them 7
in 7
then 7
said 7
she 7
but 7
make 7
them 7
understand 7
that 7
they 7
are 7
not 7
to 7
make 7
remarks 7
about 7
what 7
does 7
not 7
concern 7
them 7
and 7
be 7
sure 7
to 7
make 7
them 7
read 7
the 7
inscription 7
over 7
the 7
door 7
for 7
on 7
the 7
door 7
was 7
written 7
in 7
letters 7
of 7
gold 7
whoso 7
meddles 7
in 7
affairs 7
that 7
are 7
no 7
business 7
of 7
his 7
will 7
hear 7
truths 7
that 7
will 7
not 7
please 7
him 7
the 7
three 7
calenders 7
bowed 7
low 7
on 7
entering 7
and 7
thanked 7
the 7
ladies 7
for 7
their 7
kindness 7
and 7
hospitality 7
the 7
ladies 7
replied 7
with 7
words 7
of 7
welcome 7
and 7
they 7
were 7
all 7
about 7
to 7
seat 7
themselves 7
when 7
the 7
eyes 7
of 7
the 7
calenders 7
fell 7
on 7
the 7
porter 7
whose 7
dress 7
was 7
not 7
so 7
very 7
unlike 7
their 7
own 7
though 7
he 7
still 7
wore 7
all 7
the 7
hair 7
that 7
nature 7
had 7
given 7
him 7
this 7
said 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
is 7
apparently 7
one 7
of 7
our 7
arab 7
brothers 7
who 7
has 7
rebelled 7
against 7
our 7
ruler 7
the 7
porter 7
although 7
half 7
asleep 7
from 7
the 7
wine 7
he 7
had 7
drunk 7
heard 7
the 7
words 7
and 7
without 7
moving 7
cried 7
angrily 7
to 7
the 7
calender 7
sit 7
down 7
and 7
mind 7
your 7
own 7
business 7
did 7
you 7
not 7
read 7
the 7
inscription 7
over 7
the 7
door 7
everybody 7
is 7
not 7
obliged 7
to 7
live 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
way 7
do 7
not 7
be 7
so 7
angry 7
my 7
good 7
man 7
replied 7
the 7
calender 7
we 7
should 7
be 7
very 7
sorry 7
to 7
displease 7
you 7
so 7
the 7
quarrel 7
was 7
smoothed 7
over 7
and 7
supper 7
began 7
in 7
good 7
earnest 7
when 7
the 7
calenders 7
had 7
satisfied 7
their 7
hunger 7
they 7
offered 7
to 7
play 7
to 7
their 7
hostesses 7
if 7
there 7
were 7
any 7
instruments 7
in 7
the 7
house 7
the 7
ladies 7
were 7
delighted 7
at 7
the 7
idea 7
and 7
sadie 7
went 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
she 7
could 7
find 7
returning 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
laden 7
with 7
two 7
different 7
kinds 7
of 7
flutes 7
and 7
a 7
tambourine 7
each 7
calender 7
took 7
the 7
one 7
he 7
preferred 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
play 7
a 7
wellknown 7
air 7
while 7
the 7
ladies 7
sang 7
the 7
words 7
of 7
the 7
song 7
these 7
words 7
were 7
the 7
gayest 7
and 7
liveliest 7
possible 7
and 7
every 7
now 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
singers 7
had 7
to 7
stop 7
to 7
indulge 7
the 7
laughter 7
which 7
almost 7
choked 7
them 7
in 7
the 7
midst 7
of 7
all 7
their 7
noise 7
a 7
knock 7
was 7
heard 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
now 7
early 7
that 7
evening 7
the 7
caliph 7
secretly 7
left 7
the 7
palace 7
accompanied 7
by 7
his 7
grandvizir 7
giafar 7
and 7
mesrour 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
all 7
three 7
wearing 7
the 7
dresses 7
of 7
merchants 7
passing 7
down 7
the 7
street 7
the 7
caliph 7
had 7
been 7
attracted 7
by 7
the 7
music 7
of 7
instruments 7
and 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
laughter 7
and 7
had 7
ordered 7
his 7
vizir 7
to 7
go 7
and 7
knock 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
house 7
as 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
vizir 7
replied 7
that 7
the 7
ladies 7
who 7
lived 7
there 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
entertaining 7
their 7
friends 7
and 7
he 7
thought 7
his 7
master 7
would 7
do 7
well 7
not 7
to 7
intrude 7
on 7
them 7
but 7
the 7
caliph 7
had 7
taken 7
it 7
into 7
his 7
head 7
to 7
see 7
for 7
himself 7
and 7
insisted 7
on 7
being 7
obeyed 7
the 7
knock 7
was 7
answered 7
by 7
sadie 7
with 7
a 7
taper 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
and 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
was 7
surprised 7
at 7
her 7
beauty 7
bowed 7
low 7
before 7
her 7
and 7
said 7
respectfully 7
madam 7
we 7
are 7
three 7
merchants 7
who 7
have 7
lately 7
arrived 7
from 7
moussoul 7
and 7
owing 7
to 7
a 7
misadventure 7
which 7
befel 7
us 7
this 7
very 7
night 7
only 7
reached 7
our 7
inn 7
to 7
find 7
that 7
the 7
doors 7
were 7
closed 7
to 7
us 7
till 7
tomorrow 7
morning 7
not 7
knowing 7
what 7
to 7
do 7
we 7
wandered 7
in 7
the 7
streets 7
till 7
we 7
happened 7
to 7
pass 7
your 7
house 7
when 7
seeing 7
lights 7
and 7
hearing 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
voices 7
we 7
resolved 7
to 7
ask 7
you 7
to 7
give 7
us 7
shelter 7
till 7
the 7
dawn 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
grant 7
us 7
this 7
favour 7
we 7
will 7
with 7
your 7
permission 7
do 7
all 7
in 7
our 7
power 7
to 7
help 7
you 7
spend 7
the 7
time 7
pleasantly 7
sadie 7
answered 7
the 7
merchant 7
that 7
she 7
must 7
first 7
consult 7
her 7
sisters 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
talked 7
over 7
the 7
matter 7
with 7
them 7
she 7
returned 7
to 7
tell 7
him 7
that 7
he 7
and 7
his 7
two 7
friends 7
would 7
be 7
welcome 7
to 7
join 7
their 7
company 7
they 7
entered 7
and 7
bowed 7
politely 7
to 7
the 7
ladies 7
and 7
their 7
guests 7
then 7
zobeida 7
as 7
the 7
mistress 7
came 7
forward 7
and 7
said 7
gravely 7
you 7
are 7
welcome 7
here 7
but 7
i 7
hope 7
you 7
will 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
beg 7
one 7
thing 7
of 7
youhave 7
as 7
many 7
eyes 7
as 7
you 7
like 7
but 7
no 7
tongues 7
and 7
ask 7
no 7
questions 7
about 7
anything 7
you 7
see 7
however 7
strange 7
it 7
may 7
appear 7
to 7
you 7
madam 7
returned 7
the 7
vizir 7
you 7
shall 7
be 7
obeyed 7
we 7
have 7
quite 7
enough 7
to 7
please 7
and 7
interest 7
us 7
without 7
troubling 7
ourselves 7
about 7
that 7
with 7
which 7
we 7
have 7
no 7
concern 7
then 7
they 7
all 7
sat 7
down 7
and 7
drank 7
to 7
the 7
health 7
of 7
the 7
new 7
comers 7
while 7
the 7
vizir 7
giafar 7
was 7
talking 7
to 7
the 7
ladies 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
occupied 7
in 7
wondering 7
who 7
they 7
could 7
be 7
and 7
why 7
the 7
three 7
calenders 7
had 7
each 7
lost 7
his 7
right 7
eye 7
he 7
was 7
burning 7
to 7
inquire 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
it 7
all 7
but 7
was 7
silenced 7
by 7
zobeidas 7
request 7
so 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
rouse 7
himself 7
and 7
to 7
take 7
his 7
part 7
in 7
the 7
conversation 7
which 7
was 7
very 7
lively 7
the 7
subject 7
of 7
discussion 7
being 7
the 7
many 7
different 7
sorts 7
of 7
pleasures 7
that 7
there 7
were 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
after 7
some 7
time 7
the 7
calenders 7
got 7
up 7
and 7
performed 7
some 7
curious 7
dances 7
which 7
delighted 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
company 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
finished 7
zobeida 7
rose 7
from 7
her 7
seat 7
and 7
taking 7
amina 7
by 7
the 7
hand 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
my 7
sister 7
our 7
friends 7
will 7
excuse 7
us 7
if 7
we 7
seem 7
to 7
forget 7
their 7
presence 7
and 7
fulfil 7
our 7
nightly 7
task 7
amina 7
understood 7
her 7
sisters 7
meaning 7
and 7
collecting 7
the 7
dishes 7
glasses 7
and 7
musical 7
instruments 7
she 7
carried 7
them 7
away 7
while 7
sadie 7
swept 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
put 7
everything 7
in 7
order 7
having 7
done 7
this 7
she 7
begged 7
the 7
calenders 7
to 7
sit 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
his 7
friends 7
to 7
place 7
themselves 7
opposite 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
porter 7
she 7
requested 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
and 7
help 7
her 7
and 7
her 7
sister 7
shortly 7
after 7
amina 7
entered 7
carrying 7
a 7
seat 7
which 7
she 7
put 7
down 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
empty 7
space 7
she 7
next 7
went 7
over 7
to 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
a 7
closet 7
and 7
signed 7
to 7
the 7
porter 7
to 7
follow 7
her 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
and 7
soon 7
reappeared 7
leading 7
two 7
black 7
dogs 7
by 7
a 7
chain 7
which 7
he 7
brought 7
into 7
the 7
centre 7
of 7
the 7
hall 7
zobeida 7
then 7
got 7
up 7
from 7
her 7
seat 7
between 7
the 7
calenders 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
walked 7
slowly 7
across 7
to 7
where 7
the 7
porter 7
stood 7
with 7
the 7
dogs 7
we 7
must 7
do 7
our 7
duty 7
she 7
said 7
with 7
a 7
deep 7
sigh 7
pushing 7
back 7
her 7
sleeves 7
and 7
taking 7
a 7
whip 7
from 7
sadie 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
man 7
take 7
one 7
of 7
those 7
dogs 7
to 7
my 7
sister 7
amina 7
and 7
give 7
me 7
the 7
other 7
the 7
porter 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
bid 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
led 7
the 7
dog 7
to 7
zobeida 7
it 7
uttered 7
piercing 7
howls 7
and 7
gazed 7
up 7
at 7
her 7
with 7
looks 7
of 7
entreaty 7
but 7
zobeida 7
took 7
no 7
notice 7
and 7
whipped 7
the 7
dog 7
till 7
she 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
breath 7
she 7
then 7
took 7
the 7
chain 7
from 7
the 7
porter 7
and 7
raising 7
the 7
dog 7
on 7
its 7
hind 7
legs 7
they 7
looked 7
into 7
each 7
others 7
eyes 7
sorrowfully 7
till 7
tears 7
began 7
to 7
fall 7
from 7
both 7
then 7
zobeida 7
took 7
her 7
handkerchief 7
and 7
wiped 7
the 7
dogs 7
eyes 7
tenderly 7
after 7
which 7
she 7
kissed 7
it 7
then 7
putting 7
the 7
chain 7
into 7
the 7
porters 7
hand 7
she 7
said 7
take 7
it 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
closet 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
the 7
other 7
the 7
same 7
ceremony 7
was 7
gone 7
through 7
with 7
the 7
second 7
dog 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
while 7
the 7
whole 7
company 7
looked 7
on 7
with 7
astonishment 7
the 7
caliph 7
in 7
particular 7
could 7
hardly 7
contain 7
himself 7
and 7
made 7
signs 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
ask 7
what 7
it 7
all 7
meant 7
but 7
the 7
vizir 7
pretended 7
not 7
to 7
see 7
and 7
turned 7
his 7
head 7
away 7
zobeida 7
remained 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
till 7
at 7
last 7
sadie 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
begged 7
her 7
to 7
sit 7
down 7
as 7
she 7
also 7
had 7
her 7
part 7
to 7
play 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
amina 7
fetched 7
a 7
lute 7
from 7
a 7
case 7
of 7
yellow 7
satin 7
and 7
gave 7
it 7
to 7
sadie 7
who 7
sang 7
several 7
songs 7
to 7
its 7
accompaniment 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
tired 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
amina 7
my 7
sister 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
no 7
more 7
come 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
and 7
take 7
my 7
place 7
amina 7
struck 7
a 7
few 7
chords 7
and 7
then 7
broke 7
into 7
a 7
song 7
which 7
she 7
sang 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
ardour 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
quite 7
overcome 7
and 7
sank 7
gasping 7
on 7
a 7
pile 7
of 7
cushions 7
tearing 7
open 7
her 7
dress 7
as 7
she 7
did 7
so 7
to 7
give 7
herself 7
some 7
air 7
to 7
the 7
amazement 7
of 7
all 7
present 7
her 7
neck 7
instead 7
of 7
being 7
as 7
smooth 7
and 7
white 7
as 7
her 7
face 7
was 7
a 7
mass 7
of 7
scars 7
the 7
calenders 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
looked 7
at 7
each 7
other 7
and 7
whispered 7
together 7
unheard 7
by 7
zobeida 7
and 7
sadie 7
who 7
were 7
tending 7
their 7
fainting 7
sister 7
what 7
does 7
it 7
all 7
mean 7
asked 7
the 7
caliph 7
we 7
know 7
no 7
more 7
than 7
you 7
said 7
the 7
calender 7
to 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
spoken 7
what 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
belong 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
my 7
lord 7
answered 7
all 7
the 7
calenders 7
together 7
we 7
came 7
here 7
for 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
an 7
hour 7
before 7
you 7
they 7
then 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
porter 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
he 7
could 7
explain 7
the 7
mystery 7
but 7
the 7
porter 7
was 7
no 7
wiser 7
than 7
they 7
were 7
themselves 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
caliph 7
could 7
contain 7
his 7
curiosity 7
no 7
longer 7
and 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
compel 7
the 7
ladies 7
to 7
tell 7
them 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
their 7
strange 7
conduct 7
the 7
vizir 7
foreseeing 7
what 7
would 7
happen 7
implored 7
him 7
to 7
remember 7
the 7
condition 7
their 7
hostesses 7
had 7
imposed 7
and 7
added 7
in 7
a 7
whisper 7
that 7
if 7
his 7
highness 7
would 7
only 7
wait 7
till 7
morning 7
he 7
could 7
as 7
caliph 7
summon 7
the 7
ladies 7
to 7
appear 7
before 7
him 7
but 7
the 7
caliph 7
who 7
was 7
not 7
accustomed 7
to 7
be 7
contradicted 7
rejected 7
this 7
advice 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
resolved 7
after 7
a 7
little 7
more 7
talking 7
that 7
the 7
question 7
should 7
be 7
put 7
by 7
the 7
porter 7
suddenly 7
zobeida 7
turned 7
round 7
and 7
seeing 7
their 7
excitement 7
she 7
said 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
matter 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
all 7
discussing 7
so 7
earnestly 7
madam 7
answered 7
the 7
porter 7
these 7
gentlemen 7
entreat 7
you 7
to 7
explain 7
to 7
them 7
why 7
you 7
should 7
first 7
whip 7
the 7
dogs 7
and 7
then 7
cry 7
over 7
them 7
and 7
also 7
how 7
it 7
happens 7
that 7
the 7
fainting 7
lady 7
is 7
covered 7
with 7
scars 7
they 7
have 7
requested 7
me 7
madam 7
to 7
be 7
their 7
mouthpiece 7
is 7
it 7
true 7
gentlemen 7
asked 7
zobeida 7
drawing 7
herself 7
up 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
charged 7
this 7
man 7
to 7
put 7
me 7
that 7
question 7
it 7
is 7
they 7
all 7
replied 7
except 7
giafar 7
who 7
was 7
silent 7
is 7
this 7
continued 7
zobeida 7
growing 7
more 7
angry 7
every 7
moment 7
is 7
this 7
the 7
return 7
you 7
make 7
for 7
the 7
hospitality 7
i 7
have 7
shown 7
you 7
have 7
you 7
forgotten 7
the 7
one 7
condition 7
on 7
which 7
you 7
were 7
allowed 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
house 7
come 7
quickly 7
she 7
added 7
clapping 7
her 7
hands 7
three 7
times 7
and 7
the 7
words 7
were 7
hardly 7
uttered 7
when 7
seven 7
black 7
slaves 7
each 7
armed 7
with 7
a 7
sabre 7
burst 7
in 7
and 7
stood 7
over 7
the 7
seven 7
men 7
throwing 7
them 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
preparing 7
themselves 7
on 7
a 7
sign 7
from 7
their 7
mistress 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
their 7
heads 7
the 7
seven 7
culprits 7
all 7
thought 7
their 7
last 7
hour 7
had 7
come 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
repented 7
bitterly 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
taken 7
the 7
vizirs 7
advice 7
but 7
they 7
made 7
up 7
their 7
minds 7
to 7
die 7
bravely 7
all 7
except 7
the 7
porter 7
who 7
loudly 7
inquired 7
of 7
zobeida 7
why 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
suffer 7
for 7
other 7
peoples 7
faults 7
and 7
declared 7
that 7
these 7
misfortunes 7
would 7
never 7
have 7
happened 7
if 7
it 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
for 7
the 7
calenders 7
who 7
always 7
brought 7
illluck 7
he 7
ended 7
by 7
imploring 7
zobeida 7
not 7
to 7
confound 7
the 7
innocent 7
with 7
the 7
guilty 7
and 7
to 7
spare 7
his 7
life 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
her 7
anger 7
there 7
was 7
something 7
so 7
comic 7
in 7
the 7
groans 7
of 7
the 7
porter 7
that 7
zobeida 7
could 7
not 7
refrain 7
from 7
laughing 7
but 7
putting 7
him 7
aside 7
she 7
addressed 7
the 7
others 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
saying 7
answer 7
me 7
who 7
are 7
you 7
unless 7
you 7
tell 7
me 7
truly 7
you 7
have 7
not 7
another 7
moment 7
to 7
live 7
i 7
can 7
hardly 7
think 7
you 7
are 7
men 7
of 7
any 7
position 7
whatever 7
country 7
you 7
belong 7
to 7
if 7
you 7
were 7
you 7
would 7
have 7
had 7
more 7
consideration 7
for 7
us 7
the 7
caliph 7
who 7
was 7
naturally 7
very 7
impatient 7
suffered 7
far 7
more 7
than 7
either 7
of 7
the 7
others 7
at 7
feeling 7
that 7
his 7
life 7
was 7
at 7
the 7
mercy 7
of 7
a 7
justly 7
offended 7
lady 7
but 7
when 7
he 7
heard 7
her 7
question 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
breathe 7
more 7
freely 7
for 7
he 7
was 7
convinced 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
only 7
to 7
learn 7
his 7
name 7
and 7
rank 7
for 7
all 7
danger 7
to 7
be 7
over 7
so 7
he 7
whispered 7
hastily 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
was 7
next 7
to 7
him 7
to 7
reveal 7
their 7
secret 7
but 7
the 7
vizir 7
wiser 7
than 7
his 7
master 7
wished 7
to 7
conceal 7
from 7
the 7
public 7
the 7
affront 7
they 7
had 7
received 7
and 7
merely 7
answered 7
after 7
all 7
we 7
have 7
only 7
got 7
what 7
we 7
deserved 7
meanwhile 7
zobeida 7
had 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
three 7
calenders 7
and 7
inquired 7
if 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
all 7
blind 7
they 7
were 7
brothers 7
no 7
madam 7
replied 7
one 7
we 7
are 7
no 7
blood 7
relations 7
at 7
all 7
only 7
brothers 7
by 7
our 7
mode 7
of 7
life 7
and 7
you 7
she 7
asked 7
addressing 7
another 7
were 7
you 7
born 7
blind 7
of 7
one 7
eye 7
no 7
madam 7
returned 7
he 7
i 7
became 7
blind 7
through 7
a 7
most 7
surprising 7
adventure 7
such 7
as 7
probably 7
has 7
never 7
happened 7
to 7
anybody 7
after 7
that 7
i 7
shaved 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
eyebrows 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
dress 7
in 7
which 7
you 7
see 7
me 7
now 7
zobeida 7
put 7
the 7
same 7
question 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
calenders 7
and 7
received 7
the 7
same 7
answer 7
but 7
added 7
the 7
third 7
it 7
may 7
interest 7
you 7
madam 7
to 7
know 7
that 7
we 7
are 7
not 7
men 7
of 7
low 7
birth 7
but 7
are 7
all 7
three 7
sons 7
of 7
kings 7
and 7
of 7
kings 7
too 7
whom 7
the 7
world 7
holds 7
in 7
high 7
esteem 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
zobeidas 7
anger 7
cooled 7
down 7
and 7
she 7
turned 7
to 7
her 7
slaves 7
and 7
said 7
you 7
can 7
give 7
them 7
a 7
little 7
more 7
liberty 7
but 7
do 7
not 7
leave 7
the 7
hall 7
those 7
that 7
will 7
tell 7
us 7
their 7
histories 7
and 7
their 7
reasons 7
for 7
coming 7
here 7
shall 7
be 7
allowed 7
to 7
leave 7
unhurt 7
those 7
who 7
refuse 7
and 7
she 7
paused 7
but 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
the 7
porter 7
who 7
understood 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
only 7
to 7
relate 7
his 7
story 7
to 7
set 7
himself 7
free 7
from 7
this 7
terrible 7
danger 7
immediately 7
broke 7
in 7
madam 7
you 7
know 7
already 7
how 7
i 7
came 7
here 7
and 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
to 7
say 7
will 7
soon 7
be 7
told 7
your 7
sister 7
found 7
me 7
this 7
morning 7
in 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
i 7
always 7
stand 7
waiting 7
to 7
be 7
hired 7
she 7
bade 7
me 7
follow 7
her 7
to 7
various 7
shops 7
and 7
when 7
my 7
basket 7
was 7
quite 7
full 7
we 7
returned 7
to 7
this 7
house 7
when 7
you 7
had 7
the 7
goodness 7
to 7
permit 7
me 7
to 7
remain 7
for 7
which 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
eternally 7
grateful 7
that 7
is 7
my 7
story 7
he 7
looked 7
anxiously 7
to 7
zobeida 7
who 7
nodded 7
her 7
head 7
and 7
said 7
you 7
can 7
go 7
and 7
take 7
care 7
we 7
never 7
meet 7
again 7
oh 7
madam 7
cried 7
the 7
porter 7
let 7
me 7
stay 7
yet 7
a 7
little 7
while 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
just 7
that 7
the 7
others 7
should 7
have 7
heard 7
my 7
story 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
not 7
hear 7
theirs 7
and 7
without 7
waiting 7
for 7
permission 7
he 7
seated 7
himself 7
on 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
sofa 7
occupied 7
by 7
the 7
ladies 7
whilst 7
the 7
rest 7
crouched 7
on 7
the 7
carpet 7
and 7
the 7
slaves 7
stood 7
against 7
the 7
wall 7
then 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
calenders 7
addressing 7
himself 7
to 7
zobeida 7
as 7
the 7
principal 7
lady 7
began 7
his 7
story 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
calender 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
in 7
order 7
madam 7
to 7
explain 7
how 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
lose 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
and 7
to 7
wear 7
the 7
dress 7
of 7
a 7
calender 7
you 7
must 7
first 7
know 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
my 7
fathers 7
only 7
brother 7
reigned 7
over 7
the 7
neighbouring 7
country 7
and 7
had 7
two 7
children 7
a 7
daughter 7
and 7
a 7
son 7
who 7
were 7
of 7
the 7
same 7
age 7
as 7
myself 7
as 7
i 7
grew 7
up 7
and 7
was 7
allowed 7
more 7
liberty 7
i 7
went 7
every 7
year 7
to 7
pay 7
a 7
visit 7
to 7
my 7
uncles 7
court 7
and 7
usually 7
stayed 7
there 7
about 7
two 7
months 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
my 7
cousin 7
and 7
i 7
became 7
very 7
intimate 7
and 7
were 7
much 7
attached 7
to 7
each 7
other 7
the 7
very 7
last 7
time 7
i 7
saw 7
him 7
he 7
seemed 7
more 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
me 7
than 7
ever 7
and 7
gave 7
a 7
great 7
feast 7
in 7
my 7
honour 7
when 7
we 7
had 7
finished 7
eating 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
my 7
cousin 7
you 7
would 7
never 7
guess 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
been 7
doing 7
since 7
your 7
last 7
visit 7
to 7
us 7
directly 7
after 7
your 7
departure 7
i 7
set 7
a 7
number 7
of 7
men 7
to 7
work 7
on 7
a 7
building 7
after 7
my 7
own 7
design 7
it 7
is 7
now 7
completed 7
and 7
ready 7
to 7
be 7
lived 7
in 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
show 7
it 7
to 7
you 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
first 7
swear 7
two 7
things 7
to 7
be 7
faithful 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
to 7
keep 7
my 7
secret 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
dream 7
of 7
refusing 7
him 7
anything 7
he 7
asked 7
and 7
gave 7
the 7
promise 7
without 7
the 7
least 7
hesitation 7
he 7
then 7
bade 7
me 7
wait 7
an 7
instant 7
and 7
vanished 7
returning 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
with 7
a 7
richly 7
dressed 7
lady 7
of 7
great 7
beauty 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
tell 7
me 7
her 7
name 7
i 7
thought 7
it 7
was 7
better 7
not 7
to 7
inquire 7
we 7
all 7
three 7
sat 7
down 7
to 7
table 7
and 7
amused 7
ourselves 7
with 7
talking 7
of 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
indifferent 7
things 7
and 7
with 7
drinking 7
each 7
others 7
health 7
suddenly 7
the 7
prince 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
cousin 7
we 7
have 7
no 7
time 7
to 7
lose 7
be 7
so 7
kind 7
as 7
to 7
conduct 7
this 7
lady 7
to 7
a 7
certain 7
spot 7
where 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
a 7
domelike 7
tomb 7
newly 7
built 7
you 7
cannot 7
mistake 7
it 7
go 7
in 7
both 7
of 7
you 7
and 7
wait 7
till 7
i 7
come 7
i 7
shall 7
not 7
be 7
long 7
as 7
i 7
had 7
promised 7
i 7
prepared 7
to 7
do 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
told 7
and 7
giving 7
my 7
hand 7
to 7
the 7
lady 7
i 7
escorted 7
her 7
by 7
the 7
light 7
of 7
the 7
moon 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
of 7
which 7
the 7
prince 7
had 7
spoken 7
we 7
had 7
barely 7
reached 7
it 7
when 7
he 7
joined 7
us 7
himself 7
carrying 7
a 7
small 7
vessel 7
of 7
water 7
a 7
pickaxe 7
and 7
a 7
little 7
bag 7
containing 7
plaster 7
with 7
the 7
pickaxe 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
began 7
to 7
destroy 7
the 7
empty 7
sepulchre 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
tomb 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
he 7
took 7
the 7
stones 7
and 7
piled 7
them 7
up 7
in 7
a 7
corner 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
knocked 7
down 7
the 7
whole 7
sepulchre 7
he 7
proceeded 7
to 7
dig 7
at 7
the 7
earth 7
and 7
beneath 7
where 7
the 7
sepulchre 7
had 7
been 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
trapdoor 7
he 7
raised 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
i 7
caught 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
a 7
spiral 7
staircase 7
then 7
he 7
said 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
lady 7
madam 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
way 7
that 7
will 7
lead 7
you 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
spot 7
which 7
i 7
told 7
you 7
of 7
the 7
lady 7
did 7
not 7
answer 7
but 7
silently 7
descended 7
the 7
staircase 7
the 7
prince 7
following 7
her 7
at 7
the 7
top 7
however 7
he 7
looked 7
at 7
me 7
my 7
cousin 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
how 7
to 7
thank 7
you 7
for 7
your 7
kindness 7
farewell 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
mean 7
i 7
cried 7
i 7
dont 7
understand 7
no 7
matter 7
he 7
replied 7
go 7
back 7
by 7
the 7
path 7
that 7
you 7
came 7
he 7
would 7
say 7
no 7
more 7
and 7
greatly 7
puzzled 7
i 7
returned 7
to 7
my 7
room 7
in 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
bed 7
when 7
i 7
woke 7
and 7
considered 7
my 7
adventure 7
i 7
thought 7
that 7
i 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
dreaming 7
and 7
sent 7
a 7
servant 7
to 7
ask 7
if 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
dressed 7
and 7
could 7
see 7
me 7
but 7
on 7
hearing 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
slept 7
at 7
home 7
i 7
was 7
much 7
alarmed 7
and 7
hastened 7
to 7
the 7
cemetery 7
where 7
unluckily 7
the 7
tombs 7
were 7
all 7
so 7
alike 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
discover 7
which 7
was 7
the 7
one 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
search 7
of 7
though 7
i 7
spent 7
four 7
days 7
in 7
looking 7
for 7
it 7
you 7
must 7
know 7
that 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
uncle 7
was 7
absent 7
on 7
a 7
hunting 7
expedition 7
and 7
as 7
no 7
one 7
knew 7
when 7
he 7
would 7
be 7
back 7
i 7
at 7
last 7
decided 7
to 7
return 7
home 7
leaving 7
the 7
ministers 7
to 7
make 7
my 7
excuses 7
i 7
longed 7
to 7
tell 7
them 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
about 7
whose 7
fate 7
they 7
felt 7
the 7
most 7
dreadful 7
anxiety 7
but 7
the 7
oath 7
i 7
had 7
sworn 7
kept 7
me 7
silent 7
on 7
my 7
arrival 7
at 7
my 7
fathers 7
capital 7
i 7
was 7
astonished 7
to 7
find 7
a 7
large 7
detachment 7
of 7
guards 7
drawn 7
up 7
before 7
the 7
gate 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
they 7
surrounded 7
me 7
directly 7
i 7
entered 7
i 7
asked 7
the 7
officers 7
in 7
command 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
this 7
strange 7
behaviour 7
and 7
was 7
horrified 7
to 7
learn 7
that 7
the 7
army 7
had 7
mutinied 7
and 7
put 7
to 7
death 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
and 7
had 7
placed 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
on 7
the 7
throne 7
further 7
that 7
by 7
his 7
orders 7
i 7
was 7
placed 7
under 7
arrest 7
now 7
this 7
rebel 7
vizir 7
had 7
hated 7
me 7
from 7
my 7
boyhood 7
because 7
once 7
when 7
shooting 7
at 7
a 7
bird 7
with 7
a 7
bow 7
i 7
had 7
shot 7
out 7
his 7
eye 7
by 7
accident 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
not 7
only 7
sent 7
a 7
servant 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
offer 7
him 7
my 7
regrets 7
and 7
apologies 7
but 7
i 7
made 7
them 7
in 7
person 7
it 7
was 7
all 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
he 7
cherished 7
an 7
undying 7
hatred 7
towards 7
me 7
and 7
lost 7
no 7
occasion 7
of 7
showing 7
it 7
having 7
once 7
got 7
me 7
in 7
his 7
power 7
i 7
felt 7
he 7
could 7
show 7
no 7
mercy 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
right 7
mad 7
with 7
triumph 7
and 7
fury 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
my 7
prison 7
and 7
tore 7
out 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
that 7
is 7
how 7
i 7
lost 7
it 7
my 7
persecutor 7
however 7
did 7
not 7
stop 7
here 7
he 7
shut 7
me 7
up 7
in 7
a 7
large 7
case 7
and 7
ordered 7
his 7
executioner 7
to 7
carry 7
me 7
into 7
a 7
desert 7
place 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
abandon 7
my 7
body 7
to 7
the 7
birds 7
of 7
prey 7
the 7
case 7
with 7
me 7
inside 7
it 7
was 7
accordingly 7
placed 7
on 7
a 7
horse 7
and 7
the 7
executioner 7
accompanied 7
by 7
another 7
man 7
rode 7
into 7
the 7
country 7
until 7
they 7
found 7
a 7
spot 7
suitable 7
for 7
the 7
purpose 7
but 7
their 7
hearts 7
were 7
not 7
so 7
hard 7
as 7
they 7
seemed 7
and 7
my 7
tears 7
and 7
prayers 7
made 7
them 7
waver 7
forsake 7
the 7
kingdom 7
instantly 7
said 7
the 7
executioner 7
at 7
last 7
and 7
take 7
care 7
never 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
for 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
only 7
lose 7
your 7
head 7
but 7
make 7
us 7
lose 7
ours 7
i 7
thanked 7
him 7
gratefully 7
and 7
tried 7
to 7
console 7
myself 7
for 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
my 7
eye 7
by 7
thinking 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
misfortunes 7
i 7
had 7
escaped 7
after 7
all 7
i 7
had 7
gone 7
through 7
and 7
my 7
fear 7
of 7
being 7
recognised 7
by 7
some 7
enemy 7
i 7
could 7
only 7
travel 7
very 7
slowly 7
and 7
cautiously 7
generally 7
resting 7
in 7
some 7
outoftheway 7
place 7
by 7
day 7
and 7
walking 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
able 7
by 7
night 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
i 7
arrived 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
my 7
uncle 7
of 7
whose 7
protection 7
i 7
was 7
sure 7
i 7
found 7
him 7
in 7
great 7
trouble 7
about 7
the 7
disappearance 7
of 7
his 7
son 7
who 7
had 7
he 7
said 7
vanished 7
without 7
leaving 7
a 7
trace 7
but 7
his 7
own 7
grief 7
did 7
not 7
prevent 7
him 7
sharing 7
mine 7
we 7
mingled 7
our 7
tears 7
for 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
one 7
was 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
made 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
my 7
duty 7
to 7
break 7
the 7
solemn 7
oath 7
i 7
had 7
sworn 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
therefore 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
telling 7
my 7
uncle 7
everything 7
i 7
knew 7
and 7
i 7
observed 7
that 7
even 7
before 7
i 7
had 7
ended 7
his 7
sorrow 7
appeared 7
to 7
be 7
lightened 7
a 7
little 7
my 7
dear 7
nephew 7
he 7
said 7
your 7
story 7
gives 7
me 7
some 7
hope 7
i 7
was 7
aware 7
that 7
my 7
son 7
was 7
building 7
a 7
tomb 7
and 7
i 7
think 7
i 7
can 7
find 7
the 7
spot 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
keep 7
the 7
matter 7
secret 7
let 7
us 7
go 7
alone 7
and 7
seek 7
the 7
place 7
ourselves 7
he 7
then 7
bade 7
me 7
disguise 7
myself 7
and 7
we 7
both 7
slipped 7
out 7
of 7
a 7
garden 7
door 7
which 7
opened 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
cemetery 7
it 7
did 7
not 7
take 7
long 7
for 7
us 7
to 7
arrive 7
at 7
the 7
scene 7
of 7
the 7
princes 7
disappearance 7
or 7
to 7
discover 7
the 7
tomb 7
i 7
had 7
sought 7
so 7
vainly 7
before 7
we 7
entered 7
it 7
and 7
found 7
the 7
trapdoor 7
which 7
led 7
to 7
the 7
staircase 7
but 7
we 7
had 7
great 7
difficulty 7
in 7
raising 7
it 7
because 7
the 7
prince 7
had 7
fastened 7
it 7
down 7
underneath 7
with 7
the 7
plaster 7
he 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
him 7
my 7
uncle 7
went 7
first 7
and 7
i 7
followed 7
him 7
when 7
we 7
reached 7
the 7
bottom 7
of 7
the 7
stairs 7
we 7
stepped 7
into 7
a 7
sort 7
of 7
anteroom 7
filled 7
with 7
such 7
a 7
dense 7
smoke 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
hardly 7
possible 7
to 7
see 7
anything 7
however 7
we 7
passed 7
through 7
the 7
smoke 7
into 7
a 7
large 7
chamber 7
which 7
at 7
first 7
seemed 7
quite 7
empty 7
the 7
room 7
was 7
brilliantly 7
lighted 7
and 7
in 7
another 7
moment 7
we 7
perceived 7
a 7
sort 7
of 7
platform 7
at 7
one 7
end 7
on 7
which 7
were 7
the 7
bodies 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
a 7
lady 7
both 7
halfburned 7
as 7
if 7
they 7
had 7
been 7
dragged 7
out 7
of 7
a 7
fire 7
before 7
it 7
had 7
quite 7
consumed 7
them 7
this 7
horrible 7
sight 7
turned 7
me 7
faint 7
but 7
to 7
my 7
surprise 7
my 7
uncle 7
did 7
not 7
show 7
so 7
much 7
surprise 7
as 7
anger 7
i 7
knew 7
he 7
said 7
that 7
my 7
son 7
was 7
tenderly 7
attached 7
to 7
this 7
lady 7
whom 7
it 7
was 7
impossible 7
he 7
should 7
ever 7
marry 7
i 7
tried 7
to 7
turn 7
his 7
thoughts 7
and 7
presented 7
to 7
him 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
princesses 7
but 7
he 7
cared 7
for 7
none 7
of 7
them 7
and 7
as 7
you 7
see 7
they 7
have 7
now 7
been 7
united 7
by 7
a 7
horrible 7
death 7
in 7
an 7
underground 7
tomb 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
his 7
anger 7
melted 7
into 7
tears 7
and 7
again 7
i 7
wept 7
with 7
him 7
when 7
he 7
recovered 7
himself 7
he 7
drew 7
me 7
to 7
him 7
my 7
dear 7
nephew 7
he 7
said 7
embracing 7
me 7
you 7
have 7
come 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
take 7
his 7
place 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
my 7
best 7
to 7
forget 7
that 7
i 7
ever 7
had 7
a 7
son 7
who 7
could 7
act 7
in 7
so 7
wicked 7
a 7
manner 7
then 7
he 7
turned 7
and 7
went 7
up 7
the 7
stairs 7
we 7
reached 7
the 7
palace 7
without 7
anyone 7
having 7
noticed 7
our 7
absence 7
when 7
shortly 7
after 7
a 7
clashing 7
of 7
drums 7
and 7
cymbals 7
and 7
the 7
blare 7
of 7
trumpets 7
burst 7
upon 7
our 7
astonished 7
ears 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
a 7
thick 7
cloud 7
of 7
dust 7
on 7
the 7
horizon 7
told 7
of 7
the 7
approach 7
of 7
a 7
great 7
army 7
my 7
heart 7
sank 7
when 7
i 7
perceived 7
that 7
the 7
commander 7
was 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
had 7
dethroned 7
my 7
father 7
and 7
was 7
come 7
to 7
seize 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
my 7
uncle 7
the 7
capital 7
was 7
utterly 7
unprepared 7
to 7
stand 7
a 7
siege 7
and 7
seeing 7
that 7
resistance 7
was 7
useless 7
at 7
once 7
opened 7
its 7
gates 7
my 7
uncle 7
fought 7
hard 7
for 7
his 7
life 7
but 7
was 7
soon 7
overpowered 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
fell 7
i 7
managed 7
to 7
escape 7
through 7
a 7
secret 7
passage 7
and 7
took 7
refuge 7
with 7
an 7
officer 7
whom 7
i 7
knew 7
i 7
could 7
trust 7
persecuted 7
by 7
illfortune 7
and 7
stricken 7
with 7
grief 7
there 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
only 7
one 7
means 7
of 7
safety 7
left 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
shaved 7
my 7
beard 7
and 7
my 7
eyebrows 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
dress 7
of 7
a 7
calender 7
in 7
which 7
it 7
was 7
easy 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
travel 7
without 7
being 7
known 7
i 7
avoided 7
the 7
towns 7
till 7
i 7
reached 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
the 7
famous 7
and 7
powerful 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
no 7
further 7
reason 7
to 7
fear 7
my 7
enemies 7
it 7
was 7
my 7
intention 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
bagdad 7
and 7
to 7
throw 7
myself 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
his 7
highness 7
who 7
would 7
i 7
felt 7
certain 7
be 7
touched 7
by 7
my 7
sad 7
story 7
and 7
would 7
grant 7
me 7
besides 7
his 7
help 7
and 7
protection 7
after 7
a 7
journey 7
which 7
lasted 7
some 7
months 7
i 7
arrived 7
at 7
length 7
at 7
the 7
gates 7
of 7
this 7
city 7
it 7
was 7
sunset 7
and 7
i 7
paused 7
for 7
a 7
little 7
to 7
look 7
about 7
me 7
and 7
to 7
decide 7
which 7
way 7
to 7
turn 7
my 7
steps 7
i 7
was 7
still 7
debating 7
on 7
this 7
subject 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
joined 7
by 7
this 7
other 7
calender 7
who 7
stopped 7
to 7
greet 7
me 7
you 7
like 7
me 7
appear 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
stranger 7
i 7
said 7
he 7
replied 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
right 7
and 7
before 7
he 7
could 7
say 7
more 7
the 7
third 7
calender 7
came 7
up 7
he 7
also 7
was 7
newly 7
arrived 7
in 7
bagdad 7
and 7
being 7
brothers 7
in 7
misfortune 7
we 7
resolved 7
to 7
cast 7
in 7
our 7
lots 7
together 7
and 7
to 7
share 7
whatever 7
fate 7
might 7
have 7
in 7
store 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
it 7
had 7
grown 7
late 7
and 7
we 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
where 7
to 7
spend 7
the 7
night 7
but 7
our 7
lucky 7
star 7
having 7
guided 7
us 7
to 7
this 7
door 7
we 7
took 7
the 7
liberty 7
of 7
knocking 7
and 7
of 7
asking 7
for 7
shelter 7
which 7
was 7
given 7
to 7
us 7
at 7
once 7
with 7
the 7
best 7
grace 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
this 7
madam 7
is 7
my 7
story 7
i 7
am 7
satisfied 7
replied 7
zobeida 7
you 7
can 7
go 7
when 7
you 7
like 7
the 7
calender 7
however 7
begged 7
leave 7
to 7
stay 7
and 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
histories 7
of 7
his 7
two 7
friends 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
three 7
other 7
persons 7
of 7
the 7
company 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
allowed 7
to 7
do 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
second 7
calendar 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
madam 7
said 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
addressing 7
zobeida 7
if 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
know 7
how 7
i 7
lost 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
i 7
shall 7
have 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
my 7
whole 7
life 7
i 7
was 7
scarcely 7
more 7
than 7
a 7
baby 7
when 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
finding 7
me 7
unusually 7
quick 7
and 7
clever 7
for 7
my 7
age 7
turned 7
his 7
thoughts 7
to 7
my 7
education 7
i 7
was 7
taught 7
first 7
to 7
read 7
and 7
write 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
learn 7
the 7
koran 7
which 7
is 7
the 7
basis 7
of 7
our 7
holy 7
religion 7
and 7
the 7
better 7
to 7
understand 7
it 7
i 7
read 7
with 7
my 7
tutors 7
the 7
ablest 7
commentators 7
on 7
its 7
teaching 7
and 7
committed 7
to 7
memory 7
all 7
the 7
traditions 7
respecting 7
the 7
prophet 7
which 7
have 7
been 7
gathered 7
from 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
those 7
who 7
were 7
his 7
friends 7
i 7
also 7
learnt 7
history 7
and 7
was 7
instructed 7
in 7
poetry 7
versification 7
geography 7
chronology 7
and 7
in 7
all 7
the 7
outdoor 7
exercises 7
in 7
which 7
every 7
prince 7
should 7
excel 7
but 7
what 7
i 7
liked 7
best 7
of 7
all 7
was 7
writing 7
arabic 7
characters 7
and 7
in 7
this 7
i 7
soon 7
surpassed 7
my 7
masters 7
and 7
gained 7
a 7
reputation 7
in 7
this 7
branch 7
of 7
knowledge 7
that 7
reached 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
india 7
itself 7
now 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
the 7
indies 7
curious 7
to 7
see 7
a 7
young 7
prince 7
with 7
such 7
strange 7
tastes 7
sent 7
an 7
ambassador 7
to 7
my 7
father 7
laden 7
with 7
rich 7
presents 7
and 7
a 7
warm 7
invitation 7
to 7
visit 7
his 7
court 7
my 7
father 7
who 7
was 7
deeply 7
anxious 7
to 7
secure 7
the 7
friendship 7
of 7
so 7
powerful 7
a 7
monarch 7
and 7
held 7
besides 7
that 7
a 7
little 7
travel 7
would 7
greatly 7
improve 7
my 7
manners 7
and 7
open 7
my 7
mind 7
accepted 7
gladly 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
i 7
had 7
set 7
out 7
for 7
india 7
with 7
the 7
ambassador 7
attended 7
only 7
by 7
a 7
small 7
suite 7
on 7
account 7
of 7
the 7
length 7
of 7
the 7
journey 7
and 7
the 7
badness 7
of 7
the 7
roads 7
however 7
as 7
was 7
my 7
duty 7
i 7
took 7
with 7
me 7
ten 7
camels 7
laden 7
with 7
rich 7
presents 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
we 7
had 7
been 7
travelling 7
for 7
about 7
a 7
month 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
we 7
saw 7
a 7
cloud 7
of 7
dust 7
moving 7
swiftly 7
towards 7
us 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
it 7
came 7
near 7
we 7
found 7
that 7
the 7
dust 7
concealed 7
a 7
band 7
of 7
fifty 7
robbers 7
our 7
men 7
barely 7
numbered 7
half 7
and 7
as 7
we 7
were 7
also 7
hampered 7
by 7
the 7
camels 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
use 7
in 7
fighting 7
so 7
we 7
tried 7
to 7
overawe 7
them 7
by 7
informing 7
them 7
who 7
we 7
were 7
and 7
whither 7
we 7
were 7
going 7
the 7
robbers 7
however 7
only 7
laughed 7
and 7
declared 7
that 7
was 7
none 7
of 7
their 7
business 7
and 7
without 7
more 7
words 7
attacked 7
us 7
brutally 7
i 7
defended 7
myself 7
to 7
the 7
last 7
wounded 7
though 7
i 7
was 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
seeing 7
that 7
resistance 7
was 7
hopeless 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
ambassador 7
and 7
all 7
our 7
followers 7
were 7
made 7
prisoners 7
i 7
put 7
spurs 7
to 7
my 7
horse 7
and 7
rode 7
away 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
till 7
the 7
poor 7
beast 7
fell 7
dead 7
from 7
a 7
wound 7
in 7
his 7
side 7
i 7
managed 7
to 7
jump 7
off 7
without 7
any 7
injury 7
and 7
looked 7
about 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
i 7
was 7
pursued 7
but 7
for 7
the 7
moment 7
i 7
was 7
safe 7
for 7
as 7
i 7
imagined 7
the 7
robbers 7
were 7
all 7
engaged 7
in 7
quarrelling 7
over 7
their 7
booty 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
a 7
country 7
that 7
was 7
quite 7
new 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
dared 7
not 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
main 7
road 7
lest 7
i 7
should 7
again 7
fall 7
into 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
the 7
robbers 7
luckily 7
my 7
wound 7
was 7
only 7
a 7
slight 7
one 7
and 7
after 7
binding 7
it 7
up 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
i 7
walked 7
on 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
day 7
till 7
i 7
reached 7
a 7
cave 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
a 7
mountain 7
where 7
i 7
passed 7
the 7
night 7
in 7
peace 7
making 7
my 7
supper 7
off 7
some 7
fruits 7
i 7
had 7
gathered 7
on 7
the 7
way 7
i 7
wandered 7
about 7
for 7
a 7
whole 7
month 7
without 7
knowing 7
where 7
i 7
was 7
going 7
till 7
at 7
length 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
outskirts 7
of 7
a 7
beautiful 7
city 7
watered 7
by 7
winding 7
streams 7
which 7
enjoyed 7
an 7
eternal 7
spring 7
my 7
delight 7
at 7
the 7
prospect 7
of 7
mixing 7
once 7
more 7
with 7
human 7
beings 7
was 7
somewhat 7
damped 7
at 7
the 7
thought 7
of 7
the 7
miserable 7
object 7
i 7
must 7
seem 7
my 7
face 7
and 7
hands 7
had 7
been 7
burned 7
nearly 7
black 7
my 7
clothes 7
were 7
all 7
in 7
rags 7
and 7
my 7
shoes 7
were 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
state 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
forced 7
to 7
abandon 7
them 7
altogether 7
i 7
entered 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
stopped 7
at 7
a 7
tailor 7
s 7
shop 7
to 7
inquire 7
where 7
i 7
was 7
the 7
man 7
saw 7
i 7
was 7
better 7
than 7
my 7
condition 7
and 7
begged 7
me 7
to 7
sit 7
down 7
and 7
in 7
return 7
i 7
told 7
him 7
my 7
whole 7
story 7
the 7
tailor 7
listened 7
with 7
attention 7
but 7
his 7
reply 7
instead 7
of 7
giving 7
me 7
consolation 7
only 7
increased 7
my 7
trouble 7
beware 7
he 7
said 7
of 7
telling 7
any 7
one 7
what 7
you 7
have 7
told 7
me 7
for 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
governs 7
the 7
kingdom 7
is 7
your 7
fathers 7
greatest 7
enemy 7
and 7
he 7
will 7
be 7
rejoiced 7
to 7
find 7
you 7
in 7
his 7
power 7
i 7
thanked 7
the 7
tailor 7
for 7
his 7
counsel 7
and 7
said 7
i 7
would 7
do 7
whatever 7
he 7
advised 7
then 7
being 7
very 7
hungry 7
i 7
gladly 7
ate 7
of 7
the 7
food 7
he 7
put 7
before 7
me 7
and 7
accepted 7
his 7
offer 7
of 7
a 7
lodging 7
in 7
his 7
house 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
i 7
had 7
quite 7
recovered 7
from 7
the 7
hardships 7
i 7
had 7
undergone 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
tailor 7
knowing 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
custom 7
for 7
the 7
princes 7
of 7
our 7
religion 7
to 7
learn 7
a 7
trade 7
or 7
profession 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
provide 7
for 7
themselves 7
in 7
times 7
of 7
illfortune 7
inquired 7
if 7
there 7
was 7
anything 7
i 7
could 7
do 7
for 7
my 7
living 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
educated 7
as 7
a 7
grammarian 7
and 7
a 7
poet 7
but 7
that 7
my 7
great 7
gift 7
was 7
writing 7
all 7
that 7
is 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
here 7
said 7
the 7
tailor 7
take 7
my 7
advice 7
put 7
on 7
a 7
short 7
coat 7
and 7
as 7
you 7
seem 7
hardy 7
and 7
strong 7
go 7
into 7
the 7
woods 7
and 7
cut 7
firewood 7
which 7
you 7
will 7
sell 7
in 7
the 7
streets 7
by 7
this 7
means 7
you 7
will 7
earn 7
your 7
living 7
and 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
wait 7
till 7
better 7
times 7
come 7
the 7
hatchet 7
and 7
the 7
cord 7
shall 7
be 7
my 7
present 7
this 7
counsel 7
was 7
very 7
distasteful 7
to 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
thought 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
do 7
otherwise 7
than 7
adopt 7
it 7
so 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
i 7
set 7
out 7
with 7
a 7
company 7
of 7
poor 7
woodcutters 7
to 7
whom 7
the 7
tailor 7
had 7
introduced 7
me 7
even 7
on 7
the 7
first 7
day 7
i 7
cut 7
enough 7
wood 7
to 7
sell 7
for 7
a 7
tolerable 7
sum 7
and 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
became 7
more 7
expert 7
and 7
had 7
made 7
enough 7
money 7
to 7
repay 7
the 7
tailor 7
all 7
he 7
had 7
lent 7
me 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
a 7
woodcutter 7
for 7
more 7
than 7
a 7
year 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
i 7
wandered 7
further 7
into 7
the 7
forest 7
than 7
i 7
had 7
ever 7
done 7
before 7
and 7
reached 7
a 7
delicious 7
green 7
glade 7
where 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
cut 7
wood 7
i 7
was 7
hacking 7
at 7
the 7
root 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
when 7
i 7
beheld 7
an 7
iron 7
ring 7
fastened 7
to 7
a 7
trapdoor 7
of 7
the 7
same 7
metal 7
i 7
soon 7
cleared 7
away 7
the 7
earth 7
and 7
pulling 7
up 7
the 7
door 7
found 7
a 7
staircase 7
which 7
i 7
hastily 7
made 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
to 7
go 7
down 7
carrying 7
my 7
hatchet 7
with 7
me 7
by 7
way 7
of 7
protection 7
when 7
i 7
reached 7
the 7
bottom 7
i 7
discovered 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
a 7
huge 7
palace 7
as 7
brilliantly 7
lighted 7
as 7
any 7
palace 7
above 7
ground 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
ever 7
seen 7
with 7
a 7
long 7
gallery 7
supported 7
by 7
pillars 7
of 7
jasper 7
ornamented 7
with 7
capitals 7
of 7
gold 7
down 7
this 7
gallery 7
a 7
lady 7
came 7
to 7
meet 7
me 7
of 7
such 7
beauty 7
that 7
i 7
forgot 7
everything 7
else 7
and 7
thought 7
only 7
of 7
her 7
to 7
save 7
her 7
all 7
the 7
trouble 7
possible 7
i 7
hastened 7
towards 7
her 7
and 7
bowed 7
low 7
who 7
are 7
you 7
who 7
are 7
you 7
she 7
said 7
a 7
man 7
or 7
a 7
genius 7
a 7
man 7
madam 7
i 7
replied 7
i 7
have 7
nothing 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
genii 7
by 7
what 7
accident 7
do 7
you 7
come 7
here 7
she 7
asked 7
again 7
with 7
a 7
sigh 7
i 7
have 7
been 7
in 7
this 7
place 7
now 7
for 7
five 7
and 7
twenty 7
years 7
and 7
you 7
are 7
the 7
first 7
man 7
who 7
has 7
visited 7
me 7
emboldened 7
by 7
her 7
beauty 7
and 7
gentleness 7
i 7
ventured 7
to 7
reply 7
before 7
madam 7
i 7
answer 7
your 7
question 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
say 7
how 7
grateful 7
i 7
am 7
for 7
this 7
meeting 7
which 7
is 7
not 7
only 7
a 7
consolation 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
my 7
own 7
heavy 7
sorrow 7
but 7
may 7
perhaps 7
enable 7
me 7
to 7
render 7
your 7
lot 7
happier 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
told 7
her 7
who 7
i 7
was 7
and 7
how 7
i 7
had 7
come 7
there 7
alas 7
prince 7
she 7
said 7
with 7
a 7
deeper 7
sigh 7
than 7
before 7
you 7
have 7
guessed 7
rightly 7
in 7
supposing 7
me 7
an 7
unwilling 7
prisoner 7
in 7
this 7
gorgeous 7
place 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
ebony 7
isle 7
of 7
whose 7
fame 7
you 7
surely 7
must 7
have 7
heard 7
at 7
my 7
fathers 7
desire 7
i 7
was 7
married 7
to 7
a 7
prince 7
who 7
was 7
my 7
own 7
cousin 7
but 7
on 7
my 7
very 7
wedding 7
day 7
i 7
was 7
snatched 7
up 7
by 7
a 7
genius 7
and 7
brought 7
here 7
in 7
a 7
faint 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
while 7
i 7
did 7
nothing 7
but 7
weep 7
and 7
would 7
not 7
suffer 7
the 7
genius 7
to 7
come 7
near 7
me 7
but 7
time 7
teaches 7
us 7
submission 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
now 7
got 7
accustomed 7
to 7
his 7
presence 7
and 7
if 7
clothes 7
and 7
jewels 7
could 7
content 7
me 7
i 7
have 7
them 7
in 7
plenty 7
every 7
tenth 7
day 7
for 7
five 7
and 7
twenty 7
years 7
i 7
have 7
received 7
a 7
visit 7
from 7
him 7
but 7
in 7
case 7
i 7
should 7
need 7
his 7
help 7
at 7
any 7
other 7
time 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
touch 7
a 7
talisman 7
that 7
stands 7
at 7
the 7
entrance 7
of 7
my 7
chamber 7
it 7
wants 7
still 7
five 7
days 7
to 7
his 7
next 7
visit 7
and 7
i 7
hope 7
that 7
during 7
that 7
time 7
you 7
will 7
do 7
me 7
the 7
honour 7
to 7
be 7
my 7
guest 7
i 7
was 7
too 7
much 7
dazzled 7
by 7
her 7
beauty 7
to 7
dream 7
of 7
refusing 7
her 7
offer 7
and 7
accordingly 7
the 7
princess 7
had 7
me 7
conducted 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
and 7
a 7
rich 7
dress 7
befitting 7
my 7
rank 7
was 7
provided 7
for 7
me 7
then 7
a 7
feast 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
delicate 7
dishes 7
was 7
served 7
in 7
a 7
room 7
hung 7
with 7
embroidered 7
indian 7
fabrics 7
next 7
day 7
when 7
we 7
were 7
at 7
dinner 7
i 7
could 7
maintain 7
my 7
patience 7
no 7
longer 7
and 7
implored 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
break 7
her 7
bonds 7
and 7
return 7
with 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
world 7
which 7
was 7
lighted 7
by 7
the 7
sun 7
what 7
you 7
ask 7
is 7
impossible 7
she 7
answered 7
but 7
stay 7
here 7
with 7
me 7
instead 7
and 7
we 7
can 7
be 7
happy 7
and 7
all 7
you 7
will 7
have 7
to 7
do 7
is 7
to 7
betake 7
yourself 7
to 7
the 7
forest 7
every 7
tenth 7
day 7
when 7
i 7
am 7
expecting 7
my 7
master 7
the 7
genius 7
he 7
is 7
very 7
jealous 7
as 7
you 7
know 7
and 7
will 7
not 7
suffer 7
a 7
man 7
to 7
come 7
near 7
me 7
princess 7
i 7
replied 7
i 7
see 7
it 7
is 7
only 7
fear 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
that 7
makes 7
you 7
act 7
like 7
this 7
for 7
myself 7
i 7
dread 7
him 7
so 7
little 7
that 7
i 7
mean 7
to 7
break 7
his 7
talisman 7
in 7
pieces 7
awful 7
though 7
you 7
think 7
him 7
he 7
shall 7
feel 7
the 7
weight 7
of 7
my 7
arm 7
and 7
i 7
herewith 7
take 7
a 7
solemn 7
vow 7
to 7
stamp 7
out 7
the 7
whole 7
race 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
realized 7
the 7
consequences 7
of 7
such 7
audacity 7
entreated 7
me 7
not 7
to 7
touch 7
the 7
talisman 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
the 7
ruin 7
of 7
both 7
of 7
us 7
said 7
she 7
i 7
know 7
genii 7
much 7
better 7
than 7
you 7
but 7
the 7
wine 7
i 7
had 7
drunk 7
had 7
confused 7
my 7
brain 7
i 7
gave 7
one 7
kick 7
to 7
the 7
talisman 7
and 7
it 7
fell 7
into 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
hardly 7
had 7
my 7
foot 7
touched 7
the 7
talisman 7
when 7
the 7
air 7
became 7
as 7
dark 7
as 7
night 7
a 7
fearful 7
noise 7
was 7
heard 7
and 7
the 7
palace 7
shook 7
to 7
its 7
very 7
foundations 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
i 7
was 7
sobered 7
and 7
understood 7
what 7
i 7
had 7
done 7
princess 7
i 7
cried 7
what 7
is 7
happening 7
alas 7
she 7
exclaimed 7
forgetting 7
all 7
her 7
own 7
terrors 7
in 7
anxiety 7
for 7
me 7
fly 7
or 7
you 7
are 7
lost 7
i 7
followed 7
her 7
advice 7
and 7
dashed 7
up 7
the 7
staircase 7
leaving 7
my 7
hatchet 7
behind 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
was 7
too 7
late 7
the 7
palace 7
opened 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
appeared 7
who 7
turning 7
angrily 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
asked 7
indignantly 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
matter 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
sent 7
for 7
me 7
like 7
this 7
a 7
pain 7
in 7
my 7
heart 7
she 7
replied 7
hastily 7
obliged 7
me 7
to 7
seek 7
the 7
aid 7
of 7
this 7
little 7
bottle 7
feeling 7
faint 7
i 7
slipped 7
and 7
fell 7
against 7
the 7
talisman 7
which 7
broke 7
that 7
is 7
really 7
all 7
you 7
are 7
an 7
impudent 7
liar 7
cried 7
the 7
genius 7
how 7
did 7
this 7
hatchet 7
and 7
those 7
shoes 7
get 7
here 7
i 7
never 7
saw 7
them 7
before 7
she 7
answered 7
and 7
you 7
came 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
hurry 7
that 7
you 7
may 7
have 7
picked 7
them 7
up 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
without 7
knowing 7
it 7
to 7
this 7
the 7
genius 7
only 7
replied 7
by 7
insults 7
and 7
blows 7
i 7
could 7
hear 7
the 7
shrieks 7
and 7
groans 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
having 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
taken 7
off 7
my 7
rich 7
garments 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
those 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
arrived 7
the 7
previous 7
day 7
i 7
lifted 7
the 7
trap 7
found 7
myself 7
once 7
more 7
in 7
the 7
forest 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
my 7
friend 7
the 7
tailor 7
with 7
a 7
light 7
load 7
of 7
wood 7
and 7
a 7
heart 7
full 7
of 7
shame 7
and 7
sorrow 7
the 7
tailor 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
uneasy 7
at 7
my 7
long 7
absence 7
was 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
kept 7
silence 7
about 7
my 7
adventure 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
possible 7
retired 7
to 7
my 7
room 7
to 7
lament 7
in 7
secret 7
over 7
my 7
folly 7
while 7
i 7
was 7
thus 7
indulging 7
my 7
grief 7
my 7
host 7
entered 7
and 7
said 7
there 7
is 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
downstairs 7
who 7
has 7
brought 7
your 7
hatchet 7
and 7
slippers 7
which 7
he 7
picked 7
up 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
and 7
now 7
restores 7
to 7
you 7
as 7
he 7
found 7
out 7
from 7
one 7
of 7
your 7
comrades 7
where 7
you 7
lived 7
you 7
had 7
better 7
come 7
down 7
and 7
speak 7
to 7
him 7
yourself 7
at 7
this 7
speech 7
i 7
changed 7
colour 7
and 7
my 7
legs 7
trembled 7
under 7
me 7
the 7
tailor 7
noticed 7
my 7
confusion 7
and 7
was 7
just 7
going 7
to 7
inquire 7
the 7
reason 7
when 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
opened 7
and 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
appeared 7
carrying 7
with 7
him 7
my 7
hatchet 7
and 7
shoes 7
i 7
am 7
a 7
genius 7
he 7
said 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
eblis 7
prince 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7
is 7
not 7
this 7
hatchet 7
yours 7
and 7
these 7
shoes 7
without 7
waiting 7
for 7
an 7
answerwhich 7
indeed 7
i 7
could 7
hardly 7
have 7
given 7
him 7
so 7
great 7
was 7
my 7
frighthe 7
seized 7
hold 7
of 7
me 7
and 7
darted 7
up 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
with 7
the 7
quickness 7
of 7
lightning 7
and 7
then 7
with 7
equal 7
swiftness 7
dropped 7
down 7
towards 7
the 7
earth 7
when 7
he 7
touched 7
the 7
ground 7
he 7
rapped 7
it 7
with 7
his 7
foot 7
it 7
opened 7
and 7
we 7
found 7
ourselves 7
in 7
the 7
enchanted 7
palace 7
in 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
beautiful 7
princess 7
of 7
the 7
ebony 7
isle 7
but 7
how 7
different 7
she 7
looked 7
from 7
what 7
she 7
was 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
last 7
seen 7
her 7
for 7
she 7
was 7
lying 7
stretched 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
covered 7
with 7
blood 7
and 7
weeping 7
bitterly 7
traitress 7
cried 7
the 7
genius 7
is 7
not 7
this 7
man 7
your 7
lover 7
she 7
lifted 7
up 7
her 7
eyes 7
slowly 7
and 7
looked 7
sadly 7
at 7
me 7
i 7
never 7
saw 7
him 7
before 7
she 7
answered 7
slowly 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
who 7
he 7
is 7
what 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
genius 7
you 7
owe 7
all 7
your 7
sufferings 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
yet 7
you 7
dare 7
to 7
say 7
he 7
is 7
a 7
stranger 7
to 7
you 7
but 7
if 7
he 7
really 7
is 7
a 7
stranger 7
to 7
me 7
she 7
replied 7
why 7
should 7
i 7
tell 7
a 7
lie 7
and 7
cause 7
his 7
death 7
very 7
well 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
drawing 7
his 7
sword 7
take 7
this 7
and 7
cut 7
off 7
his 7
head 7
alas 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
am 7
too 7
weak 7
even 7
to 7
hold 7
the 7
sabre 7
and 7
supposing 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
the 7
strength 7
why 7
should 7
i 7
put 7
an 7
innocent 7
man 7
to 7
death 7
you 7
condemn 7
yourself 7
by 7
your 7
refusal 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
me 7
he 7
added 7
and 7
you 7
do 7
you 7
not 7
know 7
her 7
how 7
should 7
i 7
i 7
replied 7
resolved 7
to 7
imitate 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
her 7
fidelity 7
how 7
should 7
i 7
when 7
i 7
never 7
saw 7
her 7
before 7
cut 7
her 7
head 7
off 7
then 7
if 7
she 7
is 7
a 7
stranger 7
to 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
shall 7
believe 7
you 7
are 7
speaking 7
the 7
truth 7
and 7
will 7
set 7
you 7
at 7
liberty 7
certainly 7
i 7
answered 7
taking 7
the 7
sabre 7
in 7
my 7
hands 7
and 7
making 7
a 7
sign 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
fear 7
nothing 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
my 7
own 7
life 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
sacrifice 7
and 7
not 7
hers 7
but 7
the 7
look 7
of 7
gratitude 7
she 7
gave 7
me 7
shook 7
my 7
courage 7
and 7
i 7
flung 7
the 7
sabre 7
to 7
the 7
earth 7
i 7
should 7
not 7
deserve 7
to 7
live 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
genius 7
if 7
i 7
were 7
such 7
a 7
coward 7
as 7
to 7
slay 7
a 7
lady 7
who 7
is 7
not 7
only 7
unknown 7
to 7
me 7
but 7
who 7
is 7
at 7
this 7
moment 7
half 7
dead 7
herself 7
do 7
with 7
me 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
i 7
am 7
in 7
your 7
powerbut 7
i 7
refuse 7
to 7
obey 7
your 7
cruel 7
command 7
i 7
see 7
said 7
the 7
genius 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
both 7
made 7
up 7
your 7
minds 7
to 7
brave 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
a 7
sample 7
of 7
what 7
you 7
may 7
expect 7
so 7
saying 7
with 7
one 7
sweep 7
of 7
his 7
sabre 7
he 7
cut 7
off 7
a 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
was 7
just 7
able 7
to 7
lift 7
the 7
other 7
to 7
wave 7
me 7
an 7
eternal 7
farewell 7
then 7
i 7
lost 7
consciousness 7
for 7
several 7
minutes 7
when 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
myself 7
i 7
implored 7
the 7
genius 7
to 7
keep 7
me 7
no 7
longer 7
in 7
this 7
state 7
of 7
suspense 7
but 7
to 7
lose 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
putting 7
an 7
end 7
to 7
my 7
sufferings 7
the 7
genius 7
however 7
paid 7
no 7
attention 7
to 7
my 7
prayers 7
but 7
said 7
sternly 7
that 7
is 7
the 7
way 7
in 7
which 7
a 7
genius 7
treats 7
the 7
woman 7
who 7
has 7
betrayed 7
him 7
if 7
i 7
chose 7
i 7
could 7
kill 7
you 7
also 7
but 7
i 7
will 7
be 7
merciful 7
and 7
content 7
myself 7
with 7
changing 7
you 7
into 7
a 7
dog 7
an 7
ass 7
a 7
lion 7
or 7
a 7
birdwhichever 7
you 7
prefer 7
i 7
caught 7
eagerly 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
as 7
giving 7
me 7
a 7
faint 7
hope 7
of 7
softening 7
his 7
wrath 7
o 7
genius 7
i 7
cried 7
as 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
spare 7
my 7
life 7
be 7
generous 7
and 7
spare 7
it 7
altogether 7
grant 7
my 7
prayer 7
and 7
pardon 7
my 7
crime 7
as 7
the 7
best 7
man 7
in 7
the 7
whole 7
world 7
forgave 7
his 7
neighbour 7
who 7
was 7
eaten 7
up 7
with 7
envy 7
of 7
him 7
contrary 7
to 7
my 7
hopes 7
the 7
genius 7
seemed 7
interested 7
in 7
my 7
words 7
and 7
said 7
he 7
would 7
like 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
two 7
neighbours 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
think 7
madam 7
it 7
may 7
please 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
it 7
to 7
you 7
also 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
and 7
of 7
him 7
who 7
was 7
envied 7
in 7
a 7
town 7
of 7
moderate 7
size 7
two 7
men 7
lived 7
in 7
neighbouring 7
houses 7
but 7
they 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
there 7
very 7
long 7
before 7
one 7
man 7
took 7
such 7
a 7
hatred 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
and 7
envied 7
him 7
so 7
bitterly 7
that 7
the 7
poor 7
man 7
determined 7
to 7
find 7
another 7
home 7
hoping 7
that 7
when 7
they 7
no 7
longer 7
met 7
every 7
day 7
his 7
enemy 7
would 7
forget 7
all 7
about 7
him 7
so 7
he 7
sold 7
his 7
house 7
and 7
the 7
little 7
furniture 7
it 7
contained 7
and 7
moved 7
into 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
the 7
country 7
which 7
was 7
luckily 7
at 7
no 7
great 7
distance 7
about 7
half 7
a 7
mile 7
from 7
this 7
city 7
he 7
bought 7
a 7
nice 7
little 7
place 7
with 7
a 7
large 7
garden 7
and 7
a 7
fairsized 7
court 7
in 7
the 7
centre 7
of 7
which 7
stood 7
an 7
old 7
well 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
live 7
a 7
quieter 7
life 7
the 7
good 7
man 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
robe 7
of 7
a 7
dervish 7
and 7
divided 7
his 7
house 7
into 7
a 7
quantity 7
of 7
small 7
cells 7
where 7
he 7
soon 7
established 7
a 7
number 7
of 7
other 7
dervishes 7
the 7
fame 7
of 7
his 7
virtue 7
gradually 7
spread 7
abroad 7
and 7
many 7
people 7
including 7
several 7
of 7
the 7
highest 7
quality 7
came 7
to 7
visit 7
him 7
and 7
ask 7
his 7
prayers 7
of 7
course 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
long 7
before 7
his 7
reputation 7
reached 7
the 7
ears 7
of 7
the 7
man 7
who 7
envied 7
him 7
and 7
this 7
wicked 7
wretch 7
resolved 7
never 7
to 7
rest 7
till 7
he 7
had 7
in 7
some 7
way 7
worked 7
ill 7
to 7
the 7
dervish 7
whom 7
he 7
hated 7
so 7
he 7
left 7
his 7
house 7
and 7
his 7
business 7
to 7
look 7
after 7
themselves 7
and 7
betook 7
himself 7
to 7
the 7
new 7
dervish 7
monastery 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
welcomed 7
by 7
the 7
founder 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
warmth 7
imaginable 7
the 7
excuse 7
he 7
gave 7
for 7
his 7
appearance 7
was 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
come 7
to 7
consult 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
dervishes 7
on 7
a 7
private 7
matter 7
of 7
great 7
importance 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
to 7
say 7
must 7
not 7
be 7
overheard 7
he 7
whispered 7
command 7
i 7
beg 7
of 7
you 7
that 7
your 7
dervishes 7
retire 7
into 7
their 7
cells 7
as 7
night 7
is 7
approaching 7
and 7
meet 7
me 7
in 7
the 7
court 7
the 7
dervish 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
asked 7
without 7
delay 7
and 7
directly 7
they 7
were 7
alone 7
together 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
began 7
to 7
tell 7
a 7
long 7
story 7
edging 7
as 7
they 7
walked 7
to 7
and 7
fro 7
always 7
nearer 7
to 7
the 7
well 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
quite 7
close 7
he 7
seized 7
the 7
dervish 7
and 7
dropped 7
him 7
in 7
he 7
then 7
ran 7
off 7
triumphantly 7
without 7
having 7
been 7
seen 7
by 7
anyone 7
and 7
congratulating 7
himself 7
that 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
his 7
hatred 7
was 7
dead 7
and 7
would 7
trouble 7
him 7
no 7
more 7
but 7
in 7
this 7
he 7
was 7
mistaken 7
the 7
old 7
well 7
had 7
long 7
been 7
inhabited 7
unknown 7
to 7
mere 7
human 7
beings 7
by 7
a 7
set 7
of 7
fairies 7
and 7
genii 7
who 7
caught 7
the 7
dervish 7
as 7
he 7
fell 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
received 7
no 7
hurt 7
the 7
dervish 7
himself 7
could 7
see 7
nothing 7
but 7
he 7
took 7
for 7
granted 7
that 7
something 7
strange 7
had 7
happened 7
or 7
he 7
must 7
certainly 7
have 7
been 7
dashed 7
against 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
well 7
and 7
been 7
killed 7
he 7
lay 7
quite 7
still 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
he 7
heard 7
a 7
voice 7
saying 7
can 7
you 7
guess 7
whom 7
this 7
man 7
is 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
saved 7
from 7
death 7
no 7
replied 7
several 7
other 7
voices 7
and 7
the 7
first 7
speaker 7
answered 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
this 7
man 7
from 7
pure 7
goodness 7
of 7
heart 7
forsook 7
the 7
town 7
where 7
he 7
lived 7
and 7
came 7
to 7
dwell 7
here 7
in 7
the 7
hope 7
of 7
curing 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
neighbours 7
of 7
the 7
envy 7
he 7
felt 7
towards 7
him 7
but 7
his 7
character 7
soon 7
won 7
him 7
the 7
esteem 7
of 7
all 7
and 7
the 7
envious 7
mans 7
hatred 7
grew 7
till 7
he 7
came 7
here 7
with 7
the 7
deliberate 7
intention 7
of 7
causing 7
his 7
death 7
and 7
this 7
he 7
would 7
have 7
done 7
without 7
our 7
help 7
the 7
very 7
day 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
has 7
arranged 7
to 7
visit 7
this 7
holy 7
dervish 7
and 7
to 7
entreat 7
his 7
prayers 7
for 7
the 7
princess 7
his 7
daughter 7
but 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
matter 7
with 7
the 7
princess 7
that 7
she 7
needs 7
the 7
dervishs 7
prayers 7
asked 7
another 7
voice 7
she 7
has 7
fallen 7
into 7
the 7
power 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
maimoum 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
dimdim 7
replied 7
the 7
first 7
voice 7
but 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
quite 7
simple 7
for 7
this 7
holy 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
dervishes 7
to 7
cure 7
her 7
if 7
he 7
only 7
knew 7
in 7
his 7
convent 7
there 7
is 7
a 7
black 7
cat 7
which 7
has 7
a 7
tiny 7
white 7
tip 7
to 7
its 7
tail 7
now 7
to 7
cure 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
dervish 7
must 7
pull 7
out 7
seven 7
of 7
these 7
white 7
hairs 7
burn 7
three 7
and 7
with 7
their 7
smoke 7
perfume 7
the 7
head 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
this 7
will 7
deliver 7
her 7
so 7
completely 7
that 7
maimoum 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
dimdim 7
will 7
never 7
dare 7
to 7
approach 7
her 7
again 7
the 7
fairies 7
and 7
genii 7
ceased 7
talking 7
but 7
the 7
dervish 7
did 7
not 7
forget 7
a 7
word 7
of 7
all 7
they 7
had 7
said 7
and 7
when 7
morning 7
came 7
he 7
perceived 7
a 7
place 7
in 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
well 7
which 7
was 7
broken 7
and 7
where 7
he 7
could 7
easily 7
climb 7
out 7
the 7
dervishes 7
who 7
could 7
not 7
imagine 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
him 7
were 7
enchanted 7
at 7
his 7
reappearance 7
he 7
told 7
them 7
of 7
the 7
attempt 7
on 7
his 7
life 7
made 7
by 7
his 7
guest 7
of 7
the 7
previous 7
day 7
and 7
then 7
retired 7
into 7
his 7
cell 7
he 7
was 7
soon 7
joined 7
here 7
by 7
the 7
black 7
cat 7
of 7
which 7
the 7
voice 7
had 7
spoken 7
who 7
came 7
as 7
usual 7
to 7
say 7
goodmorning 7
to 7
his 7
master 7
he 7
took 7
him 7
on 7
his 7
knee 7
and 7
seized 7
the 7
opportunity 7
to 7
pull 7
seven 7
white 7
hairs 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
tail 7
and 7
put 7
them 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
till 7
they 7
were 7
needed 7
the 7
sun 7
had 7
not 7
long 7
risen 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
was 7
anxious 7
to 7
leave 7
nothing 7
undone 7
that 7
might 7
deliver 7
the 7
princess 7
arrived 7
with 7
a 7
large 7
suite 7
at 7
the 7
gate 7
of 7
the 7
monastery 7
and 7
was 7
received 7
by 7
the 7
dervishes 7
with 7
profound 7
respect 7
the 7
sultan 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
declaring 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
his 7
visit 7
and 7
leading 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
dervishes 7
aside 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
noble 7
scheik 7
you 7
have 7
guessed 7
perhaps 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
come 7
to 7
ask 7
you 7
yes 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
if 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
mistaken 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
illness 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
which 7
has 7
procured 7
me 7
this 7
honour 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
returned 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
me 7
fresh 7
life 7
if 7
you 7
can 7
by 7
your 7
prayers 7
deliver 7
my 7
daughter 7
from 7
the 7
strange 7
malady 7
that 7
has 7
taken 7
possession 7
of 7
her 7
let 7
your 7
highness 7
command 7
her 7
to 7
come 7
here 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
see 7
what 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
the 7
sultan 7
full 7
of 7
hope 7
sent 7
orders 7
at 7
once 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
to 7
set 7
out 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
possible 7
accompanied 7
by 7
her 7
usual 7
staff 7
of 7
attendants 7
when 7
she 7
arrived 7
she 7
was 7
so 7
thickly 7
veiled 7
that 7
the 7
dervish 7
could 7
not 7
see 7
her 7
face 7
but 7
he 7
desired 7
a 7
brazier 7
to 7
be 7
held 7
over 7
her 7
head 7
and 7
laid 7
the 7
seven 7
hairs 7
on 7
the 7
burning 7
coals 7
the 7
instant 7
they 7
were 7
consumed 7
terrific 7
cries 7
were 7
heard 7
but 7
no 7
one 7
could 7
tell 7
from 7
whom 7
they 7
proceeded 7
only 7
the 7
dervish 7
guessed 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
uttered 7
by 7
maimoum 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
dimdim 7
who 7
felt 7
the 7
princess 7
escaping 7
him 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
she 7
had 7
seemed 7
unconscious 7
of 7
what 7
she 7
was 7
doing 7
but 7
now 7
she 7
raised 7
her 7
hand 7
to 7
her 7
veil 7
and 7
uncovered 7
her 7
face 7
where 7
am 7
i 7
she 7
said 7
in 7
a 7
bewildered 7
manner 7
and 7
how 7
did 7
i 7
get 7
here 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
so 7
delighted 7
to 7
hear 7
these 7
words 7
that 7
he 7
not 7
only 7
embraced 7
his 7
daughter 7
but 7
kissed 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
dervish 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
his 7
attendants 7
who 7
stood 7
round 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
them 7
what 7
reward 7
shall 7
i 7
give 7
to 7
the 7
man 7
who 7
has 7
restored 7
me 7
my 7
daughter 7
they 7
all 7
replied 7
with 7
one 7
accord 7
that 7
he 7
deserved 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
that 7
is 7
my 7
own 7
opinion 7
said 7
he 7
and 7
from 7
this 7
moment 7
i 7
declare 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
my 7
soninlaw 7
shortly 7
after 7
these 7
events 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
died 7
and 7
his 7
post 7
was 7
given 7
to 7
the 7
dervish 7
but 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
hold 7
it 7
for 7
long 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
fell 7
a 7
victim 7
to 7
an 7
attack 7
of 7
illness 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
no 7
sons 7
the 7
soldiers 7
and 7
priests 7
declared 7
the 7
dervish 7
heir 7
to 7
the 7
throne 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
joy 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
people 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
the 7
dervish 7
who 7
had 7
now 7
become 7
sultan 7
was 7
making 7
a 7
royal 7
progress 7
with 7
his 7
court 7
he 7
perceived 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
standing 7
in 7
the 7
crowd 7
he 7
made 7
a 7
sign 7
to 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
vizirs 7
and 7
whispered 7
in 7
his 7
ear 7
fetch 7
me 7
that 7
man 7
who 7
is 7
standing 7
out 7
there 7
but 7
take 7
great 7
care 7
not 7
to 7
frighten 7
him 7
the 7
vizir 7
obeyed 7
and 7
when 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
was 7
brought 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
monarch 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
my 7
friend 7
i 7
am 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
you 7
again 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
an 7
officer 7
he 7
added 7
give 7
him 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
treasury 7
and 7
twenty 7
waggonloads 7
of 7
merchandise 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
private 7
stores 7
and 7
let 7
an 7
escort 7
of 7
soldiers 7
accompany 7
him 7
home 7
he 7
then 7
took 7
leave 7
of 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
and 7
went 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
now 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
ended 7
my 7
story 7
i 7
proceeded 7
to 7
show 7
the 7
genius 7
how 7
to 7
apply 7
it 7
to 7
himself 7
o 7
genius 7
i 7
said 7
you 7
see 7
that 7
this 7
sultan 7
was 7
not 7
content 7
with 7
merely 7
forgiving 7
the 7
envious 7
man 7
for 7
the 7
attempt 7
on 7
his 7
life 7
he 7
heaped 7
rewards 7
and 7
riches 7
upon 7
him 7
but 7
the 7
genius 7
had 7
made 7
up 7
his 7
mind 7
and 7
could 7
not 7
be 7
softened 7
do 7
not 7
imagine 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
going 7
to 7
escape 7
so 7
easily 7
he 7
said 7
all 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
is 7
to 7
give 7
you 7
bare 7
life 7
you 7
will 7
have 7
to 7
learn 7
what 7
happens 7
to 7
people 7
who 7
interfere 7
with 7
me 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
he 7
seized 7
me 7
violently 7
by 7
the 7
arm 7
the 7
roof 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
opened 7
to 7
make 7
way 7
for 7
us 7
and 7
we 7
mounted 7
up 7
so 7
high 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
that 7
the 7
earth 7
looked 7
like 7
a 7
little 7
cloud 7
then 7
as 7
before 7
he 7
came 7
down 7
with 7
the 7
swiftness 7
of 7
lightning 7
and 7
we 7
touched 7
the 7
ground 7
on 7
a 7
mountain 7
top 7
then 7
he 7
stooped 7
and 7
gathered 7
a 7
handful 7
of 7
earth 7
and 7
murmured 7
some 7
words 7
over 7
it 7
after 7
which 7
he 7
threw 7
the 7
earth 7
in 7
my 7
face 7
saying 7
as 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
quit 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
a 7
man 7
and 7
assume 7
that 7
of 7
a 7
monkey 7
this 7
done 7
he 7
vanished 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
the 7
likeness 7
of 7
an 7
ape 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
country 7
i 7
had 7
never 7
seen 7
before 7
however 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
use 7
in 7
stopping 7
where 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
i 7
came 7
down 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
a 7
flat 7
plain 7
which 7
was 7
bounded 7
by 7
the 7
sea 7
i 7
travelled 7
towards 7
it 7
and 7
was 7
pleased 7
to 7
see 7
a 7
vessel 7
moored 7
about 7
half 7
a 7
mile 7
from 7
shore 7
there 7
were 7
no 7
waves 7
so 7
i 7
broke 7
off 7
the 7
branch 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
and 7
dragging 7
it 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
waters 7
edge 7
sat 7
across 7
it 7
while 7
using 7
two 7
sticks 7
for 7
oars 7
i 7
rowed 7
myself 7
towards 7
the 7
ship 7
the 7
deck 7
was 7
full 7
of 7
people 7
who 7
watched 7
my 7
progress 7
with 7
interest 7
but 7
when 7
i 7
seized 7
a 7
rope 7
and 7
swung 7
myself 7
on 7
board 7
i 7
found 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
only 7
escaped 7
death 7
at 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
to 7
perish 7
by 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
sailors 7
lest 7
i 7
should 7
bring 7
illluck 7
to 7
the 7
vessel 7
and 7
the 7
merchants 7
throw 7
him 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
cried 7
one 7
knock 7
him 7
on 7
the 7
head 7
with 7
a 7
hammer 7
exclaimed 7
another 7
let 7
me 7
shoot 7
him 7
with 7
an 7
arrow 7
said 7
a 7
third 7
and 7
certainly 7
somebody 7
would 7
have 7
had 7
his 7
way 7
if 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
flung 7
myself 7
at 7
the 7
captains 7
feet 7
and 7
grasped 7
tight 7
hold 7
of 7
his 7
dress 7
he 7
appeared 7
touched 7
by 7
my 7
action 7
and 7
patted 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
take 7
me 7
under 7
his 7
protection 7
and 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
should 7
do 7
me 7
any 7
harm 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
about 7
fifty 7
days 7
we 7
cast 7
anchor 7
before 7
a 7
large 7
town 7
and 7
the 7
ship 7
was 7
immediately 7
surrounded 7
by 7
a 7
multitude 7
of 7
small 7
boats 7
filled 7
with 7
people 7
who 7
had 7
come 7
either 7
to 7
meet 7
their 7
friends 7
or 7
from 7
simple 7
curiosity 7
among 7
others 7
one 7
boat 7
contained 7
several 7
officials 7
who 7
asked 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
merchants 7
on 7
board 7
and 7
informed 7
them 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
been 7
sent 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
in 7
token 7
of 7
welcome 7
and 7
to 7
beg 7
them 7
each 7
to 7
write 7
a 7
few 7
lines 7
on 7
a 7
roll 7
of 7
paper 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
explain 7
this 7
strange 7
request 7
continued 7
the 7
officers 7
it 7
is 7
necessary 7
that 7
you 7
should 7
know 7
that 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
lately 7
dead 7
was 7
celebrated 7
for 7
his 7
beautiful 7
handwriting 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
is 7
anxious 7
to 7
find 7
a 7
similar 7
talent 7
in 7
his 7
successor 7
hitherto 7
the 7
search 7
has 7
been 7
a 7
failure 7
but 7
his 7
highness 7
has 7
not 7
yet 7
given 7
up 7
hope 7
one 7
after 7
another 7
the 7
merchants 7
set 7
down 7
a 7
few 7
lines 7
upon 7
the 7
roll 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
all 7
finished 7
i 7
came 7
forward 7
and 7
snatched 7
the 7
paper 7
from 7
the 7
man 7
who 7
held 7
it 7
at 7
first 7
they 7
all 7
thought 7
i 7
was 7
going 7
to 7
throw 7
it 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
but 7
they 7
were 7
quieted 7
when 7
they 7
saw 7
i 7
held 7
it 7
with 7
great 7
care 7
and 7
great 7
was 7
their 7
surprise 7
when 7
i 7
made 7
signs 7
that 7
i 7
too 7
wished 7
to 7
write 7
something 7
let 7
him 7
do 7
it 7
if 7
he 7
wants 7
to 7
said 7
the 7
captain 7
if 7
he 7
only 7
makes 7
a 7
mess 7
of 7
the 7
paper 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
sure 7
i 7
will 7
punish 7
him 7
for 7
it 7
but 7
if 7
as 7
i 7
hope 7
he 7
really 7
can 7
write 7
for 7
he 7
is 7
the 7
cleverest 7
monkey 7
i 7
ever 7
saw 7
i 7
will 7
adopt 7
him 7
as 7
my 7
son 7
the 7
one 7
i 7
lost 7
had 7
not 7
nearly 7
so 7
much 7
sense 7
no 7
more 7
was 7
said 7
and 7
i 7
took 7
the 7
pen 7
and 7
wrote 7
the 7
six 7
sorts 7
of 7
writing 7
in 7
use 7
among 7
the 7
arabs 7
and 7
each 7
sort 7
contained 7
an 7
original 7
verse 7
or 7
couplet 7
in 7
praise 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
not 7
only 7
did 7
my 7
handwriting 7
completely 7
eclipse 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
but 7
it 7
is 7
hardly 7
too 7
much 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
none 7
so 7
beautiful 7
had 7
ever 7
before 7
been 7
seen 7
in 7
that 7
country 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
ended 7
the 7
officials 7
took 7
the 7
roll 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
monarch 7
saw 7
my 7
writing 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
so 7
much 7
as 7
look 7
at 7
the 7
samples 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
but 7
desired 7
his 7
officials 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
finest 7
and 7
most 7
richly 7
caparisoned 7
horse 7
in 7
his 7
stables 7
together 7
with 7
the 7
most 7
magnificent 7
dress 7
they 7
could 7
procure 7
and 7
to 7
put 7
it 7
on 7
the 7
person 7
who 7
had 7
written 7
those 7
lines 7
and 7
bring 7
him 7
to 7
court 7
the 7
officials 7
began 7
to 7
laugh 7
when 7
they 7
heard 7
the 7
sultans 7
command 7
but 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
could 7
speak 7
they 7
said 7
deign 7
your 7
highness 7
to 7
excuse 7
our 7
mirth 7
but 7
those 7
lines 7
were 7
not 7
written 7
by 7
a 7
man 7
but 7
by 7
a 7
monkey 7
a 7
monkey 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
sultan 7
yes 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
officials 7
they 7
were 7
written 7
by 7
a 7
monkey 7
in 7
our 7
presence 7
then 7
bring 7
me 7
the 7
monkey 7
he 7
replied 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
you 7
can 7
the 7
sultans 7
officials 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
ship 7
and 7
showed 7
the 7
royal 7
order 7
to 7
the 7
captain 7
he 7
is 7
the 7
master 7
said 7
the 7
good 7
man 7
and 7
desired 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
sent 7
for 7
then 7
they 7
put 7
on 7
me 7
the 7
gorgeous 7
robe 7
and 7
rowed 7
me 7
to 7
land 7
where 7
i 7
was 7
placed 7
on 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
led 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
here 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
awaiting 7
me 7
in 7
great 7
state 7
surrounded 7
by 7
his 7
court 7
all 7
the 7
way 7
along 7
the 7
streets 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
curiosity 7
to 7
a 7
vast 7
crowd 7
which 7
had 7
filled 7
every 7
doorway 7
and 7
every 7
window 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
amidst 7
their 7
shouts 7
and 7
cheers 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
ushered 7
into 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
approached 7
the 7
throne 7
on 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
seated 7
and 7
made 7
him 7
three 7
low 7
bows 7
then 7
prostrated 7
myself 7
at 7
his 7
feet 7
to 7
the 7
surprise 7
of 7
everyone 7
who 7
could 7
not 7
understand 7
how 7
it 7
was 7
possible 7
that 7
a 7
monkey 7
should 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
distinguish 7
a 7
sultan 7
from 7
other 7
people 7
and 7
to 7
pay 7
him 7
the 7
respect 7
due 7
to 7
his 7
rank 7
however 7
excepting 7
the 7
usual 7
speech 7
i 7
omitted 7
none 7
of 7
the 7
common 7
forms 7
attending 7
a 7
royal 7
audience 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
over 7
the 7
sultan 7
dismissed 7
all 7
the 7
court 7
keeping 7
with 7
him 7
only 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
and 7
a 7
little 7
slave 7
he 7
then 7
passed 7
into 7
another 7
room 7
and 7
ordered 7
food 7
to 7
be 7
brought 7
making 7
signs 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
sit 7
at 7
table 7
with 7
him 7
and 7
eat 7
i 7
rose 7
from 7
my 7
seat 7
kissed 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
took 7
my 7
place 7
at 7
the 7
table 7
eating 7
as 7
you 7
may 7
suppose 7
with 7
care 7
and 7
in 7
moderation 7
before 7
the 7
dishes 7
were 7
removed 7
i 7
made 7
signs 7
that 7
writing 7
materials 7
which 7
stood 7
in 7
one 7
corner 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
should 7
be 7
laid 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
me 7
i 7
then 7
took 7
a 7
peach 7
and 7
wrote 7
on 7
it 7
some 7
verses 7
in 7
praise 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
was 7
speechless 7
with 7
astonishment 7
but 7
when 7
i 7
did 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
on 7
a 7
glass 7
from 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
drunk 7
he 7
murmured 7
to 7
himself 7
why 7
a 7
man 7
who 7
could 7
do 7
as 7
much 7
would 7
be 7
cleverer 7
than 7
any 7
other 7
man 7
and 7
this 7
is 7
only 7
a 7
monkey 7
supper 7
being 7
over 7
chessmen 7
were 7
brought 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
signed 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
know 7
if 7
i 7
would 7
play 7
with 7
him 7
i 7
kissed 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
laid 7
my 7
hand 7
on 7
my 7
head 7
to 7
show 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
ready 7
to 7
show 7
myself 7
worthy 7
of 7
the 7
honour 7
he 7
beat 7
me 7
the 7
first 7
game 7
but 7
i 7
won 7
the 7
second 7
and 7
third 7
and 7
seeing 7
that 7
this 7
did 7
not 7
quite 7
please 7
i 7
dashed 7
off 7
a 7
verse 7
by 7
way 7
of 7
consolation 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
so 7
enchanted 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
talents 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
given 7
proof 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
me 7
to 7
exhibit 7
some 7
of 7
them 7
to 7
other 7
people 7
so 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
he 7
said 7
go 7
and 7
beg 7
my 7
daughter 7
queen 7
of 7
beauty 7
to 7
come 7
here 7
i 7
will 7
show 7
her 7
something 7
she 7
has 7
never 7
seen 7
before 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
bowed 7
and 7
left 7
the 7
room 7
ushering 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
later 7
the 7
princess 7
queen 7
of 7
beauty 7
her 7
face 7
was 7
uncovered 7
but 7
the 7
moment 7
she 7
set 7
foot 7
in 7
the 7
room 7
she 7
threw 7
her 7
veil 7
over 7
her 7
head 7
sire 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
father 7
what 7
can 7
you 7
be 7
thinking 7
of 7
to 7
summon 7
me 7
like 7
this 7
into 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
a 7
man 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
understand 7
you 7
replied 7
the 7
sultan 7
there 7
is 7
nobody 7
here 7
but 7
the 7
eunuch 7
who 7
is 7
your 7
own 7
servant 7
the 7
little 7
slave 7
and 7
myself 7
yet 7
you 7
cover 7
yourself 7
with 7
your 7
veil 7
and 7
reproach 7
me 7
for 7
having 7
sent 7
for 7
you 7
as 7
if 7
i 7
had 7
committed 7
a 7
crime 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
am 7
right 7
and 7
you 7
are 7
wrong 7
this 7
monkey 7
is 7
really 7
no 7
monkey 7
at 7
all 7
but 7
a 7
young 7
prince 7
who 7
has 7
been 7
turned 7
into 7
a 7
monkey 7
by 7
the 7
wicked 7
spells 7
of 7
a 7
genius 7
son 7
of 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
eblis 7
as 7
will 7
be 7
imagined 7
these 7
words 7
took 7
the 7
sultan 7
by 7
surprise 7
and 7
he 7
looked 7
at 7
me 7
to 7
see 7
how 7
i 7
should 7
take 7
the 7
statement 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
unable 7
to 7
speak 7
i 7
placed 7
my 7
hand 7
on 7
my 7
head 7
to 7
show 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
true 7
but 7
how 7
do 7
you 7
know 7
this 7
my 7
daughter 7
asked 7
he 7
sire 7
replied 7
queen 7
of 7
beauty 7
the 7
old 7
lady 7
who 7
took 7
care 7
of 7
me 7
in 7
my 7
childhood 7
was 7
an 7
accomplished 7
magician 7
and 7
she 7
taught 7
me 7
seventy 7
rules 7
of 7
her 7
art 7
by 7
means 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
could 7
in 7
the 7
twinkling 7
of 7
an 7
eye 7
transplant 7
your 7
capital 7
into 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
ocean 7
her 7
art 7
likewise 7
teaches 7
me 7
to 7
recognise 7
at 7
first 7
sight 7
all 7
persons 7
who 7
are 7
enchanted 7
and 7
tells 7
me 7
by 7
whom 7
the 7
spell 7
was 7
wrought 7
my 7
daughter 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
really 7
had 7
no 7
idea 7
you 7
were 7
so 7
clever 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
there 7
are 7
many 7
outoftheway 7
things 7
it 7
is 7
as 7
well 7
to 7
know 7
but 7
one 7
should 7
never 7
boast 7
of 7
them 7
well 7
asked 7
the 7
sultan 7
can 7
you 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
must 7
be 7
done 7
to 7
disenchant 7
the 7
young 7
prince 7
certainly 7
and 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
it 7
then 7
restore 7
him 7
to 7
his 7
former 7
shape 7
cried 7
the 7
sultan 7
you 7
could 7
give 7
me 7
no 7
greater 7
pleasure 7
for 7
i 7
wish 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
my 7
grandvizir 7
and 7
to 7
give 7
him 7
to 7
you 7
for 7
your 7
husband 7
as 7
your 7
highness 7
pleases 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
queen 7
of 7
beauty 7
rose 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
her 7
chamber 7
from 7
which 7
she 7
fetched 7
a 7
knife 7
with 7
some 7
hebrew 7
words 7
engraven 7
on 7
the 7
blade 7
she 7
then 7
desired 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
the 7
little 7
slave 7
and 7
myself 7
to 7
descend 7
into 7
a 7
secret 7
court 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
placed 7
us 7
beneath 7
a 7
gallery 7
which 7
ran 7
all 7
round 7
she 7
herself 7
standing 7
in 7
the 7
centre 7
of 7
the 7
court 7
here 7
she 7
traced 7
a 7
large 7
circle 7
and 7
in 7
it 7
wrote 7
several 7
words 7
in 7
arab 7
characters 7
when 7
the 7
circle 7
and 7
the 7
writing 7
were 7
finished 7
she 7
stood 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
repeated 7
some 7
verses 7
from 7
the 7
koran 7
slowly 7
the 7
air 7
grew 7
dark 7
and 7
we 7
felt 7
as 7
if 7
the 7
earth 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
crumble 7
away 7
and 7
our 7
fright 7
was 7
by 7
no 7
means 7
diminished 7
at 7
seeing 7
the 7
genius 7
son 7
of 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
eblis 7
suddenly 7
appear 7
under 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
a 7
colossal 7
lion 7
dog 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
when 7
she 7
first 7
caught 7
sight 7
of 7
him 7
you 7
think 7
to 7
strike 7
terror 7
into 7
me 7
by 7
daring 7
to 7
present 7
yourself 7
before 7
me 7
in 7
this 7
hideous 7
shape 7
and 7
you 7
retorted 7
the 7
lion 7
have 7
not 7
feared 7
to 7
break 7
our 7
treaty 7
that 7
engaged 7
solemnly 7
we 7
should 7
never 7
interfere 7
with 7
each 7
other 7
accursed 7
genius 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
princess 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
by 7
whom 7
that 7
treaty 7
was 7
first 7
broken 7
i 7
will 7
teach 7
you 7
how 7
to 7
give 7
me 7
so 7
much 7
trouble 7
said 7
the 7
lion 7
and 7
opening 7
his 7
huge 7
mouth 7
he 7
advanced 7
to 7
swallow 7
her 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
expected 7
something 7
of 7
the 7
sort 7
and 7
was 7
on 7
her 7
guard 7
she 7
bounded 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
and 7
seizing 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
hairs 7
of 7
his 7
mane 7
repeated 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
words 7
over 7
it 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
it 7
became 7
a 7
sword 7
and 7
with 7
a 7
sharp 7
blow 7
she 7
cut 7
the 7
lions 7
body 7
into 7
two 7
pieces 7
these 7
pieces 7
vanished 7
no 7
one 7
knew 7
where 7
and 7
only 7
the 7
lions 7
head 7
remained 7
which 7
was 7
at 7
once 7
changed 7
into 7
a 7
scorpion 7
quick 7
as 7
thought 7
the 7
princess 7
assumed 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
a 7
serpent 7
and 7
gave 7
battle 7
to 7
the 7
scorpion 7
who 7
finding 7
he 7
was 7
getting 7
the 7
worst 7
of 7
it 7
turned 7
himself 7
into 7
an 7
eagle 7
and 7
took 7
flight 7
but 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
the 7
serpent 7
had 7
become 7
an 7
eagle 7
more 7
powerful 7
still 7
who 7
soared 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
air 7
and 7
after 7
him 7
and 7
then 7
we 7
lost 7
sight 7
of 7
them 7
both 7
we 7
all 7
remained 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
quaking 7
with 7
anxiety 7
when 7
the 7
ground 7
opened 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
us 7
and 7
a 7
black 7
and 7
white 7
cat 7
leapt 7
out 7
its 7
hair 7
standing 7
on 7
end 7
and 7
miauing 7
frightfully 7
at 7
its 7
heels 7
was 7
a 7
wolf 7
who 7
had 7
almost 7
seized 7
it 7
when 7
the 7
cat 7
changed 7
itself 7
into 7
a 7
worm 7
and 7
piercing 7
the 7
skin 7
of 7
a 7
pomegranate 7
which 7
had 7
tumbled 7
from 7
a 7
tree 7
hid 7
itself 7
in 7
the 7
fruit 7
the 7
pomegranate 7
swelled 7
till 7
it 7
grew 7
as 7
large 7
as 7
a 7
pumpkin 7
and 7
raised 7
itself 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
roof 7
of 7
the 7
gallery 7
from 7
which 7
it 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
court 7
and 7
was 7
broken 7
into 7
bits 7
while 7
this 7
was 7
taking 7
place 7
the 7
wolf 7
who 7
had 7
transformed 7
himself 7
into 7
a 7
cock 7
began 7
to 7
swallow 7
the 7
seed 7
of 7
the 7
pomegranate 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
when 7
all 7
were 7
gone 7
he 7
flew 7
towards 7
us 7
flapping 7
his 7
wings 7
as 7
if 7
to 7
ask 7
if 7
we 7
saw 7
any 7
more 7
when 7
suddenly 7
his 7
eye 7
fell 7
on 7
one 7
which 7
lay 7
on 7
the 7
bank 7
of 7
the 7
little 7
canal 7
that 7
flowed 7
through 7
the 7
court 7
he 7
hastened 7
towards 7
it 7
but 7
before 7
he 7
could 7
touch 7
it 7
the 7
seed 7
rolled 7
into 7
the 7
canal 7
and 7
became 7
a 7
fish 7
the 7
cock 7
flung 7
himself 7
in 7
after 7
the 7
fish 7
and 7
took 7
the 7
shape 7
of 7
a 7
pike 7
and 7
for 7
two 7
hours 7
they 7
chased 7
each 7
other 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
under 7
the 7
water 7
uttering 7
horrible 7
cries 7
but 7
we 7
could 7
see 7
nothing 7
at 7
length 7
they 7
rose 7
from 7
the 7
water 7
in 7
their 7
proper 7
forms 7
but 7
darting 7
such 7
flames 7
of 7
fire 7
from 7
their 7
mouths 7
that 7
we 7
dreaded 7
lest 7
the 7
palace 7
should 7
catch 7
fire 7
soon 7
however 7
we 7
had 7
much 7
greater 7
cause 7
for 7
alarm 7
as 7
the 7
genius 7
having 7
shaken 7
off 7
the 7
princess 7
flew 7
towards 7
us 7
our 7
fate 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
sealed 7
if 7
the 7
princess 7
seeing 7
our 7
danger 7
had 7
not 7
attracted 7
the 7
attention 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
to 7
herself 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
sultans 7
beard 7
was 7
singed 7
and 7
his 7
face 7
scorched 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
was 7
burned 7
to 7
a 7
cinder 7
while 7
a 7
spark 7
deprived 7
me 7
of 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
one 7
eye 7
both 7
i 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
given 7
up 7
all 7
hope 7
of 7
a 7
rescue 7
when 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
shout 7
of 7
victory 7
victory 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
lay 7
at 7
her 7
feet 7
a 7
great 7
heap 7
of 7
ashes 7
exhausted 7
though 7
she 7
was 7
the 7
princess 7
at 7
once 7
ordered 7
the 7
little 7
slave 7
who 7
alone 7
was 7
uninjured 7
to 7
bring 7
her 7
a 7
cup 7
of 7
water 7
which 7
she 7
took 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
first 7
repeating 7
some 7
magic 7
words 7
over 7
it 7
she 7
dashed 7
it 7
into 7
my 7
face 7
saying 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
only 7
a 7
monkey 7
by 7
enchantment 7
resume 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
the 7
man 7
you 7
were 7
before 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
i 7
stood 7
before 7
her 7
the 7
same 7
man 7
i 7
had 7
formerly 7
been 7
though 7
having 7
lost 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
one 7
eye 7
i 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
fall 7
on 7
my 7
knees 7
and 7
thank 7
the 7
princess 7
but 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
give 7
me 7
time 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
her 7
father 7
she 7
said 7
sire 7
i 7
have 7
gained 7
the 7
battle 7
but 7
it 7
has 7
cost 7
me 7
dear 7
the 7
fire 7
has 7
penetrated 7
to 7
my 7
heart 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
to 7
live 7
this 7
would 7
not 7
have 7
happened 7
if 7
i 7
had 7
only 7
noticed 7
the 7
last 7
pomegranate 7
seed 7
and 7
eaten 7
it 7
like 7
the 7
rest 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
last 7
struggle 7
of 7
the 7
genius 7
and 7
up 7
to 7
that 7
time 7
i 7
was 7
quite 7
safe 7
but 7
having 7
let 7
this 7
chance 7
slip 7
i 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
resort 7
to 7
fire 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
his 7
experience 7
i 7
showed 7
the 7
genius 7
that 7
i 7
knew 7
more 7
than 7
he 7
did 7
he 7
is 7
dead 7
and 7
in 7
ashes 7
but 7
my 7
own 7
death 7
is 7
approaching 7
fast 7
my 7
daughter 7
cried 7
the 7
sultan 7
how 7
sad 7
is 7
my 7
condition 7
i 7
am 7
only 7
surprised 7
i 7
am 7
alive 7
at 7
all 7
the 7
eunuch 7
is 7
consumed 7
by 7
the 7
flames 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
whom 7
you 7
have 7
delivered 7
has 7
lost 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
one 7
eye 7
he 7
could 7
say 7
no 7
more 7
for 7
sobs 7
choked 7
his 7
voice 7
and 7
we 7
all 7
wept 7
together 7
suddenly 7
the 7
princess 7
shrieked 7
i 7
burn 7
i 7
burn 7
and 7
death 7
came 7
to 7
free 7
her 7
from 7
her 7
torments 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
words 7
madam 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
of 7
my 7
feelings 7
at 7
this 7
terrible 7
sight 7
i 7
would 7
rather 7
have 7
remained 7
a 7
monkey 7
all 7
my 7
life 7
than 7
let 7
my 7
benefactress 7
perish 7
in 7
this 7
shocking 7
manner 7
as 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
he 7
was 7
quite 7
inconsolable 7
and 7
his 7
subjects 7
who 7
had 7
dearly 7
loved 7
the 7
princess 7
shared 7
his 7
grief 7
for 7
seven 7
days 7
the 7
whole 7
nation 7
mourned 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
ashes 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
were 7
buried 7
with 7
great 7
pomp 7
and 7
a 7
superb 7
tomb 7
was 7
raised 7
over 7
her 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
sultan 7
recovered 7
from 7
the 7
severe 7
illness 7
which 7
had 7
seized 7
him 7
after 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
me 7
and 7
plainly 7
though 7
politely 7
informed 7
me 7
that 7
my 7
presence 7
would 7
always 7
remind 7
him 7
of 7
his 7
loss 7
and 7
he 7
begged 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
instantly 7
quit 7
his 7
kingdom 7
and 7
on 7
pain 7
of 7
death 7
never 7
return 7
to 7
it 7
i 7
was 7
of 7
course 7
bound 7
to 7
obey 7
and 7
not 7
knowing 7
what 7
was 7
to 7
become 7
of 7
me 7
i 7
shaved 7
my 7
beard 7
and 7
eyebrows 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
dress 7
of 7
a 7
calender 7
after 7
wandering 7
aimlessly 7
through 7
several 7
countries 7
i 7
resolved 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
bagdad 7
and 7
request 7
an 7
audience 7
of 7
the 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
and 7
that 7
madam 7
is 7
my 7
story 7
the 7
other 7
calender 7
then 7
told 7
his 7
story 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
third 7
calendar 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
my 7
story 7
said 7
the 7
third 7
calender 7
is 7
quite 7
different 7
from 7
those 7
of 7
my 7
two 7
friends 7
it 7
was 7
fate 7
that 7
deprived 7
them 7
of 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
their 7
right 7
eyes 7
but 7
mine 7
was 7
lost 7
by 7
my 7
own 7
folly 7
my 7
name 7
is 7
agib 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
called 7
cassib 7
who 7
reigned 7
over 7
a 7
large 7
kingdom 7
which 7
had 7
for 7
its 7
capital 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
finest 7
seaport 7
towns 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
when 7
i 7
succeeded 7
to 7
my 7
fathers 7
throne 7
my 7
first 7
care 7
was 7
to 7
visit 7
the 7
provinces 7
on 7
the 7
mainland 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
sail 7
to 7
the 7
numerous 7
islands 7
which 7
lay 7
off 7
the 7
shore 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
gain 7
the 7
hearts 7
of 7
my 7
subjects 7
these 7
voyages 7
gave 7
me 7
such 7
a 7
taste 7
for 7
sailing 7
that 7
i 7
soon 7
determined 7
to 7
explore 7
more 7
distant 7
seas 7
and 7
commanded 7
a 7
fleet 7
of 7
large 7
ships 7
to 7
be 7
got 7
ready 7
without 7
delay 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
properly 7
fitted 7
out 7
i 7
embarked 7
on 7
my 7
expedition 7
for 7
forty 7
days 7
wind 7
and 7
weather 7
were 7
all 7
in 7
our 7
favour 7
but 7
the 7
next 7
night 7
a 7
terrific 7
storm 7
arose 7
which 7
blew 7
us 7
hither 7
and 7
thither 7
for 7
ten 7
days 7
till 7
the 7
pilot 7
confessed 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
quite 7
lost 7
his 7
bearings 7
accordingly 7
a 7
sailor 7
was 7
sent 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
masthead 7
to 7
try 7
to 7
catch 7
a 7
sight 7
of 7
land 7
and 7
reported 7
that 7
nothing 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
seen 7
but 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
sky 7
except 7
a 7
huge 7
mass 7
of 7
blackness 7
that 7
lay 7
astern 7
on 7
hearing 7
this 7
the 7
pilot 7
grew 7
white 7
and 7
beating 7
his 7
breast 7
he 7
cried 7
oh 7
sir 7
we 7
are 7
lost 7
lost 7
till 7
the 7
ships 7
crew 7
trembled 7
at 7
they 7
knew 7
not 7
what 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
recovered 7
himself 7
a 7
little 7
and 7
was 7
able 7
to 7
explain 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
his 7
terror 7
he 7
replied 7
in 7
answer 7
to 7
my 7
question 7
that 7
we 7
had 7
drifted 7
far 7
out 7
of 7
our 7
course 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
about 7
noon 7
we 7
should 7
come 7
near 7
that 7
mass 7
of 7
darkness 7
which 7
said 7
he 7
is 7
nothing 7
but 7
the 7
famous 7
black 7
mountain 7
this 7
mountain 7
is 7
composed 7
of 7
adamant 7
which 7
attracts 7
to 7
itself 7
all 7
the 7
iron 7
and 7
nails 7
in 7
your 7
ship 7
and 7
as 7
we 7
are 7
helplessly 7
drawn 7
nearer 7
the 7
force 7
of 7
attraction 7
will 7
become 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
the 7
iron 7
and 7
nails 7
will 7
fall 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
ships 7
and 7
cling 7
to 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
the 7
ships 7
will 7
sink 7
to 7
the 7
bottom 7
with 7
all 7
that 7
are 7
in 7
them 7
this 7
it 7
is 7
that 7
causes 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
towards 7
the 7
sea 7
to 7
appear 7
of 7
such 7
a 7
dense 7
blackness 7
as 7
may 7
be 7
supposedcontinued 7
the 7
pilotthe 7
mountain 7
sides 7
are 7
very 7
rugged 7
but 7
on 7
the 7
summit 7
stands 7
a 7
brass 7
dome 7
supported 7
on 7
pillars 7
and 7
bearing 7
on 7
top 7
the 7
figure 7
of 7
a 7
brass 7
horse 7
with 7
a 7
rider 7
on 7
his 7
back 7
this 7
rider 7
wears 7
a 7
breastplate 7
of 7
lead 7
on 7
which 7
strange 7
signs 7
and 7
figures 7
are 7
engraved 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
said 7
that 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
this 7
statue 7
remains 7
on 7
the 7
dome 7
vessels 7
will 7
never 7
cease 7
to 7
perish 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
pilot 7
began 7
to 7
weep 7
afresh 7
and 7
the 7
crew 7
fearing 7
their 7
last 7
hour 7
had 7
come 7
made 7
their 7
wills 7
each 7
one 7
in 7
favour 7
of 7
his 7
fellow 7
at 7
noon 7
next 7
day 7
as 7
the 7
pilot 7
had 7
foretold 7
we 7
were 7
so 7
near 7
to 7
the 7
black 7
mountain 7
that 7
we 7
saw 7
all 7
the 7
nails 7
and 7
iron 7
fly 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
ships 7
and 7
dash 7
themselves 7
against 7
the 7
mountain 7
with 7
a 7
horrible 7
noise 7
a 7
moment 7
after 7
the 7
vessels 7
fell 7
asunder 7
and 7
sank 7
the 7
crews 7
with 7
them 7
i 7
alone 7
managed 7
to 7
grasp 7
a 7
floating 7
plank 7
and 7
was 7
driven 7
ashore 7
by 7
the 7
wind 7
without 7
even 7
a 7
scratch 7
what 7
was 7
my 7
joy 7
on 7
finding 7
myself 7
at 7
the 7
bottom 7
of 7
some 7
steps 7
which 7
led 7
straight 7
up 7
the 7
mountain 7
for 7
there 7
was 7
not 7
another 7
inch 7
to 7
the 7
right 7
or 7
the 7
left 7
where 7
a 7
man 7
could 7
set 7
his 7
foot 7
and 7
indeed 7
even 7
the 7
steps 7
themselves 7
were 7
so 7
narrow 7
and 7
so 7
steep 7
that 7
if 7
the 7
lightest 7
breeze 7
had 7
arisen 7
i 7
should 7
certainly 7
have 7
been 7
blown 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
when 7
i 7
reached 7
the 7
top 7
i 7
found 7
the 7
brass 7
dome 7
and 7
the 7
statue 7
exactly 7
as 7
the 7
pilot 7
had 7
described 7
but 7
was 7
too 7
wearied 7
with 7
all 7
i 7
had 7
gone 7
through 7
to 7
do 7
more 7
than 7
glance 7
at 7
them 7
and 7
flinging 7
myself 7
under 7
the 7
dome 7
was 7
asleep 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
in 7
my 7
dreams 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
appeared 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
said 7
hearken 7
agib 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
thou 7
art 7
awake 7
dig 7
up 7
the 7
ground 7
underfoot 7
and 7
thou 7
shalt 7
find 7
a 7
bow 7
of 7
brass 7
and 7
three 7
arrows 7
of 7
lead 7
shoot 7
the 7
arrows 7
at 7
the 7
statue 7
and 7
the 7
rider 7
shall 7
tumble 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
but 7
the 7
horse 7
will 7
fall 7
down 7
by 7
thy 7
side 7
and 7
thou 7
shalt 7
bury 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
place 7
from 7
which 7
thou 7
tookest 7
the 7
bow 7
and 7
arrows 7
this 7
being 7
done 7
the 7
sea 7
will 7
rise 7
and 7
cover 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
on 7
it 7
thou 7
wilt 7
perceive 7
the 7
figure 7
of 7
a 7
metal 7
man 7
seated 7
in 7
a 7
boat 7
having 7
an 7
oar 7
in 7
each 7
hand 7
step 7
on 7
board 7
and 7
let 7
him 7
conduct 7
thee 7
but 7
if 7
thou 7
wouldest 7
behold 7
thy 7
kingdom 7
again 7
see 7
that 7
thou 7
takest 7
not 7
the 7
name 7
of 7
allah 7
into 7
thy 7
mouth 7
having 7
uttered 7
these 7
words 7
the 7
vision 7
left 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
woke 7
much 7
comforted 7
i 7
sprang 7
up 7
and 7
drew 7
the 7
bow 7
and 7
arrows 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
third 7
shot 7
the 7
horseman 7
fell 7
with 7
a 7
great 7
crash 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
which 7
instantly 7
began 7
to 7
rise 7
so 7
rapidly 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
hardly 7
time 7
to 7
bury 7
the 7
horse 7
before 7
the 7
boat 7
approached 7
me 7
i 7
stepped 7
silently 7
in 7
and 7
sat 7
down 7
and 7
the 7
metal 7
man 7
pushed 7
off 7
and 7
rowed 7
without 7
stopping 7
for 7
nine 7
days 7
after 7
which 7
land 7
appeared 7
on 7
the 7
horizon 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
overcome 7
with 7
joy 7
at 7
this 7
sight 7
that 7
i 7
forgot 7
all 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
had 7
told 7
me 7
and 7
cried 7
out 7
allah 7
be 7
praised 7
allah 7
be 7
praised 7
the 7
words 7
were 7
scarcely 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
mouth 7
when 7
the 7
boat 7
and 7
man 7
sank 7
from 7
beneath 7
me 7
and 7
left 7
me 7
floating 7
on 7
the 7
surface 7
all 7
that 7
day 7
and 7
the 7
next 7
night 7
i 7
swam 7
and 7
floated 7
alternately 7
making 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
for 7
the 7
land 7
which 7
was 7
nearest 7
to 7
me 7
at 7
last 7
my 7
strength 7
began 7
to 7
fail 7
and 7
i 7
gave 7
myself 7
up 7
for 7
lost 7
when 7
the 7
wind 7
suddenly 7
rose 7
and 7
a 7
huge 7
wave 7
cast 7
me 7
on 7
a 7
flat 7
shore 7
then 7
placing 7
myself 7
in 7
safety 7
i 7
hastily 7
spread 7
my 7
clothes 7
out 7
to 7
dry 7
in 7
the 7
sun 7
and 7
flung 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
warm 7
ground 7
to 7
rest 7
next 7
morning 7
i 7
dressed 7
myself 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
look 7
about 7
me 7
there 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
no 7
one 7
but 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
island 7
which 7
was 7
covered 7
with 7
fruit 7
trees 7
and 7
watered 7
with 7
streams 7
but 7
seemed 7
a 7
long 7
distance 7
from 7
the 7
mainland 7
which 7
i 7
hoped 7
to 7
reach 7
before 7
however 7
i 7
had 7
time 7
to 7
feel 7
cast 7
down 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
ship 7
making 7
directly 7
for 7
the 7
island 7
and 7
not 7
knowing 7
whether 7
it 7
would 7
contain 7
friends 7
or 7
foes 7
i 7
hid 7
myself 7
in 7
the 7
thick 7
branches 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
the 7
sailors 7
ran 7
the 7
ship 7
into 7
a 7
creek 7
where 7
ten 7
slaves 7
landed 7
carrying 7
spades 7
and 7
pickaxes 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
island 7
they 7
stopped 7
and 7
after 7
digging 7
some 7
time 7
lifted 7
up 7
what 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
trapdoor 7
they 7
then 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
vessel 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
times 7
for 7
furniture 7
and 7
provisions 7
and 7
finally 7
were 7
accompanied 7
by 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
leading 7
a 7
handsome 7
boy 7
of 7
fourteen 7
or 7
fifteen 7
years 7
of 7
age 7
they 7
all 7
disappeared 7
down 7
the 7
trapdoor 7
and 7
after 7
remaining 7
below 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
came 7
up 7
again 7
but 7
without 7
the 7
boy 7
and 7
let 7
down 7
the 7
trapdoor 7
covering 7
it 7
with 7
earth 7
as 7
before 7
this 7
done 7
they 7
entered 7
the 7
ship 7
and 7
set 7
sail 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
i 7
came 7
down 7
from 7
my 7
tree 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
the 7
boy 7
had 7
been 7
buried 7
i 7
dug 7
up 7
the 7
earth 7
till 7
i 7
reached 7
a 7
large 7
stone 7
with 7
a 7
ring 7
in 7
the 7
centre 7
this 7
when 7
removed 7
disclosed 7
a 7
flight 7
of 7
stone 7
steps 7
which 7
led 7
to 7
a 7
large 7
room 7
richly 7
furnished 7
and 7
lighted 7
by 7
tapers 7
on 7
a 7
pile 7
of 7
cushions 7
covered 7
with 7
tapestry 7
sat 7
the 7
boy 7
he 7
looked 7
up 7
startled 7
and 7
frightened 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
a 7
stranger 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
place 7
and 7
to 7
soothe 7
his 7
fears 7
i 7
at 7
once 7
spoke 7
be 7
not 7
alarmed 7
sir 7
whoever 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
i 7
am 7
a 7
king 7
and 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
and 7
will 7
do 7
you 7
no 7
hurt 7
on 7
the 7
contrary 7
perhaps 7
i 7
have 7
been 7
sent 7
here 7
to 7
deliver 7
you 7
out 7
of 7
this 7
tomb 7
where 7
you 7
have 7
been 7
buried 7
alive 7
hearing 7
my 7
words 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
recovered 7
himself 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
ended 7
he 7
said 7
the 7
reasons 7
prince 7
that 7
have 7
caused 7
me 7
to 7
be 7
buried 7
in 7
this 7
place 7
are 7
so 7
strange 7
that 7
they 7
cannot 7
but 7
surprise 7
you 7
my 7
father 7
is 7
a 7
rich 7
merchant 7
owning 7
much 7
land 7
and 7
many 7
ships 7
and 7
has 7
great 7
dealings 7
in 7
precious 7
stones 7
but 7
he 7
never 7
ceased 7
mourning 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
no 7
child 7
to 7
inherit 7
his 7
wealth 7
at 7
length 7
one 7
day 7
he 7
dreamed 7
that 7
the 7
following 7
year 7
a 7
son 7
would 7
be 7
born 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
when 7
this 7
actually 7
happened 7
he 7
consulted 7
all 7
the 7
wise 7
men 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
future 7
of 7
the 7
infant 7
one 7
and 7
all 7
they 7
said 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
i 7
was 7
to 7
live 7
happily 7
till 7
i 7
was 7
fifteen 7
when 7
a 7
terrible 7
danger 7
awaited 7
me 7
which 7
i 7
should 7
hardly 7
escape 7
if 7
however 7
i 7
should 7
succeed 7
in 7
doing 7
so 7
i 7
should 7
live 7
to 7
a 7
great 7
old 7
age 7
and 7
they 7
added 7
when 7
the 7
statue 7
of 7
the 7
brass 7
horse 7
on 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
of 7
adamant 7
is 7
thrown 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
by 7
agib 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
cassib 7
then 7
beware 7
for 7
fifty 7
days 7
later 7
your 7
son 7
shall 7
fall 7
by 7
his 7
hand 7
this 7
prophecy 7
struck 7
the 7
heart 7
of 7
my 7
father 7
with 7
such 7
woe 7
that 7
he 7
never 7
got 7
over 7
it 7
but 7
that 7
did 7
not 7
prevent 7
him 7
from 7
attending 7
carefully 7
to 7
my 7
education 7
till 7
i 7
attained 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
ago 7
my 7
fifteenth 7
birthday 7
it 7
was 7
only 7
yesterday 7
that 7
the 7
news 7
reached 7
him 7
that 7
ten 7
days 7
previously 7
the 7
statue 7
of 7
brass 7
had 7
been 7
thrown 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
set 7
about 7
hiding 7
me 7
in 7
this 7
underground 7
chamber 7
which 7
was 7
built 7
for 7
the 7
purpose 7
promising 7
to 7
fetch 7
me 7
out 7
when 7
the 7
forty 7
days 7
have 7
passed 7
for 7
myself 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
fears 7
as 7
prince 7
agib 7
is 7
not 7
likely 7
to 7
come 7
here 7
to 7
look 7
for 7
me 7
i 7
listened 7
to 7
his 7
story 7
with 7
an 7
inward 7
laugh 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
absurdity 7
of 7
my 7
ever 7
wishing 7
to 7
cause 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
this 7
harmless 7
boy 7
whom 7
i 7
hastened 7
to 7
assure 7
of 7
my 7
friendship 7
and 7
even 7
of 7
my 7
protection 7
begging 7
him 7
in 7
return 7
to 7
convey 7
me 7
in 7
his 7
fathers 7
ship 7
to 7
my 7
own 7
country 7
i 7
need 7
hardly 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
took 7
special 7
care 7
not 7
to 7
inform 7
him 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
the 7
agib 7
whom 7
he 7
dreaded 7
the 7
day 7
passed 7
in 7
conversation 7
on 7
various 7
subjects 7
and 7
i 7
found 7
him 7
a 7
youth 7
of 7
ready 7
wit 7
and 7
of 7
some 7
learning 7
i 7
took 7
on 7
myself 7
the 7
duties 7
of 7
a 7
servant 7
held 7
the 7
basin 7
and 7
water 7
for 7
him 7
when 7
he 7
washed 7
prepared 7
the 7
dinner 7
and 7
set 7
it 7
on 7
the 7
table 7
he 7
soon 7
grew 7
to 7
love 7
me 7
and 7
for 7
thirtynine 7
days 7
we 7
spent 7
as 7
pleasant 7
an 7
existence 7
as 7
could 7
be 7
expected 7
underground 7
the 7
morning 7
of 7
the 7
fortieth 7
dawned 7
and 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
when 7
he 7
woke 7
gave 7
thanks 7
in 7
an 7
outburst 7
of 7
joy 7
that 7
the 7
danger 7
was 7
passed 7
my 7
father 7
may 7
be 7
here 7
at 7
any 7
moment 7
said 7
he 7
so 7
make 7
me 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
a 7
bath 7
of 7
hot 7
water 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
bathe 7
and 7
change 7
my 7
clothes 7
and 7
be 7
ready 7
to 7
receive 7
him 7
so 7
i 7
fetched 7
the 7
water 7
as 7
he 7
asked 7
and 7
washed 7
and 7
rubbed 7
him 7
after 7
which 7
he 7
lay 7
down 7
again 7
and 7
slept 7
a 7
little 7
when 7
he 7
opened 7
his 7
eyes 7
for 7
the 7
second 7
time 7
he 7
begged 7
me 7
to 7
bring 7
him 7
a 7
melon 7
and 7
some 7
sugar 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
eat 7
and 7
refresh 7
himself 7
i 7
soon 7
chose 7
a 7
fine 7
melon 7
out 7
of 7
those 7
which 7
remained 7
but 7
could 7
find 7
no 7
knife 7
to 7
cut 7
it 7
with 7
look 7
in 7
the 7
cornice 7
over 7
my 7
head 7
said 7
he 7
and 7
i 7
think 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
one 7
it 7
was 7
so 7
high 7
above 7
me 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
some 7
difficulty 7
in 7
reaching 7
it 7
and 7
catching 7
my 7
foot 7
in 7
the 7
covering 7
of 7
the 7
bed 7
i 7
slipped 7
and 7
fell 7
right 7
upon 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
the 7
knife 7
going 7
straight 7
into 7
his 7
heart 7
at 7
this 7
awful 7
sight 7
i 7
shrieked 7
aloud 7
in 7
my 7
grief 7
and 7
pain 7
i 7
threw 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
rent 7
my 7
clothes 7
and 7
tore 7
my 7
hair 7
with 7
sorrow 7
then 7
fearing 7
to 7
be 7
punished 7
as 7
his 7
murderer 7
by 7
the 7
unhappy 7
father 7
i 7
raised 7
the 7
great 7
stone 7
which 7
blocked 7
the 7
staircase 7
and 7
quitting 7
the 7
underground 7
chamber 7
made 7
everything 7
fast 7
as 7
before 7
scarcely 7
had 7
i 7
finished 7
when 7
looking 7
out 7
to 7
sea 7
i 7
saw 7
the 7
vessel 7
heading 7
for 7
the 7
island 7
and 7
feeling 7
that 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
useless 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
protest 7
my 7
innocence 7
i 7
again 7
concealed 7
myself 7
among 7
the 7
branches 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
that 7
grew 7
near 7
by 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
and 7
his 7
slaves 7
pushed 7
off 7
in 7
a 7
boat 7
directly 7
the 7
ship 7
touched 7
land 7
and 7
walked 7
quickly 7
towards 7
the 7
entrance 7
to 7
the 7
underground 7
chamber 7
but 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
near 7
enough 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
the 7
earth 7
had 7
been 7
disturbed 7
they 7
paused 7
and 7
changed 7
colour 7
in 7
silence 7
they 7
all 7
went 7
down 7
and 7
called 7
to 7
the 7
youth 7
by 7
name 7
then 7
for 7
a 7
moment 7
i 7
heard 7
no 7
more 7
suddenly 7
a 7
fearful 7
scream 7
rent 7
the 7
air 7
and 7
the 7
next 7
instant 7
the 7
slaves 7
came 7
up 7
the 7
steps 7
carrying 7
with 7
them 7
the 7
body 7
of 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
who 7
had 7
fainted 7
from 7
sorrow 7
laying 7
him 7
down 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
tree 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
taken 7
shelter 7
they 7
did 7
their 7
best 7
to 7
recover 7
him 7
but 7
it 7
took 7
a 7
long 7
while 7
when 7
at 7
last 7
he 7
revived 7
they 7
left 7
him 7
to 7
dig 7
a 7
grave 7
and 7
then 7
laying 7
the 7
young 7
mans 7
body 7
in 7
it 7
they 7
threw 7
in 7
the 7
earth 7
this 7
ended 7
the 7
slaves 7
brought 7
up 7
all 7
the 7
furniture 7
that 7
remained 7
below 7
and 7
put 7
it 7
on 7
the 7
vessel 7
and 7
breaking 7
some 7
boughs 7
to 7
weave 7
a 7
litter 7
they 7
laid 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
on 7
it 7
and 7
carried 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
ship 7
which 7
spread 7
its 7
sails 7
and 7
stood 7
out 7
to 7
sea 7
so 7
once 7
more 7
i 7
was 7
quite 7
alone 7
and 7
for 7
a 7
whole 7
month 7
i 7
walked 7
daily 7
over 7
the 7
island 7
seeking 7
for 7
some 7
chance 7
of 7
escape 7
at 7
length 7
one 7
day 7
it 7
struck 7
me 7
that 7
my 7
prison 7
had 7
grown 7
much 7
larger 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
mainland 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
nearer 7
my 7
heart 7
beat 7
at 7
this 7
thought 7
which 7
was 7
almost 7
too 7
good 7
to 7
be 7
true 7
i 7
watched 7
a 7
little 7
longer 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
doubt 7
about 7
it 7
and 7
soon 7
there 7
was 7
only 7
a 7
tiny 7
stream 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
cross 7
even 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
safe 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
side 7
i 7
had 7
a 7
long 7
distance 7
to 7
go 7
on 7
the 7
mud 7
and 7
sand 7
before 7
i 7
reached 7
dry 7
ground 7
and 7
very 7
tired 7
i 7
was 7
when 7
far 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
me 7
i 7
caught 7
sight 7
of 7
a 7
castle 7
of 7
red 7
copper 7
which 7
at 7
first 7
sight 7
i 7
took 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
fire 7
i 7
made 7
all 7
the 7
haste 7
i 7
could 7
and 7
after 7
some 7
miles 7
of 7
hard 7
walking 7
stood 7
before 7
it 7
and 7
gazed 7
at 7
it 7
in 7
astonishment 7
for 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
the 7
most 7
wonderful 7
building 7
i 7
had 7
ever 7
beheld 7
while 7
i 7
was 7
still 7
staring 7
at 7
it 7
there 7
came 7
towards 7
me 7
a 7
tall 7
old 7
man 7
accompanied 7
by 7
ten 7
young 7
men 7
all 7
handsome 7
and 7
all 7
blind 7
of 7
the 7
right 7
eye 7
now 7
in 7
its 7
way 7
the 7
spectacle 7
of 7
ten 7
men 7
walking 7
together 7
all 7
blind 7
of 7
the 7
right 7
eye 7
is 7
as 7
uncommon 7
as 7
that 7
of 7
a 7
copper 7
castle 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
turning 7
over 7
in 7
my 7
mind 7
what 7
could 7
be 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
this 7
strange 7
fact 7
when 7
they 7
greeted 7
me 7
warmly 7
and 7
inquired 7
what 7
had 7
brought 7
me 7
there 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
my 7
story 7
was 7
somewhat 7
long 7
but 7
that 7
if 7
they 7
would 7
take 7
the 7
trouble 7
to 7
sit 7
down 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
happy 7
to 7
tell 7
it 7
them 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
begged 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
go 7
with 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
castle 7
and 7
i 7
joyfully 7
accepted 7
their 7
offer 7
we 7
passed 7
through 7
what 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
an 7
endless 7
number 7
of 7
rooms 7
and 7
came 7
at 7
length 7
into 7
a 7
large 7
hall 7
furnished 7
with 7
ten 7
small 7
blue 7
sofas 7
for 7
the 7
ten 7
young 7
men 7
which 7
served 7
as 7
beds 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
chairs 7
and 7
with 7
another 7
sofa 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
for 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
as 7
none 7
of 7
the 7
sofas 7
could 7
hold 7
more 7
than 7
one 7
person 7
they 7
bade 7
me 7
place 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
carpet 7
and 7
to 7
ask 7
no 7
questions 7
about 7
anything 7
i 7
should 7
see 7
after 7
a 7
little 7
while 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
rose 7
and 7
brought 7
in 7
supper 7
which 7
i 7
ate 7
heartily 7
for 7
i 7
was 7
very 7
hungry 7
then 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
begged 7
me 7
to 7
repeat 7
my 7
story 7
which 7
had 7
struck 7
them 7
all 7
with 7
astonishment 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
ended 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
was 7
bidden 7
to 7
do 7
his 7
duty 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
late 7
and 7
they 7
wished 7
to 7
go 7
to 7
bed 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
he 7
rose 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
a 7
closet 7
from 7
which 7
he 7
brought 7
out 7
ten 7
basins 7
all 7
covered 7
with 7
blue 7
stuff 7
he 7
set 7
one 7
before 7
each 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
together 7
with 7
a 7
lighted 7
taper 7
when 7
the 7
covers 7
were 7
taken 7
off 7
the 7
basins 7
i 7
saw 7
they 7
were 7
filled 7
with 7
ashes 7
coaldust 7
and 7
lampblack 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
mixed 7
these 7
all 7
together 7
and 7
smeared 7
the 7
whole 7
over 7
their 7
heads 7
and 7
faces 7
they 7
then 7
wept 7
and 7
beat 7
their 7
breasts 7
crying 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
fruit 7
of 7
idleness 7
and 7
of 7
our 7
wicked 7
lives 7
this 7
ceremony 7
lasted 7
nearly 7
the 7
whole 7
night 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
stopped 7
they 7
washed 7
themselves 7
carefully 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
fresh 7
clothes 7
and 7
lay 7
down 7
to 7
sleep 7
all 7
this 7
while 7
i 7
had 7
refrained 7
from 7
questions 7
though 7
my 7
curiosity 7
almost 7
seemed 7
to 7
burn 7
a 7
hole 7
in 7
me 7
but 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
when 7
we 7
went 7
out 7
to 7
walk 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
them 7
gentlemen 7
i 7
must 7
disobey 7
your 7
wishes 7
for 7
i 7
can 7
keep 7
silence 7
no 7
more 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
appear 7
to 7
lack 7
wit 7
yet 7
you 7
do 7
such 7
actions 7
as 7
none 7
but 7
madmen 7
could 7
be 7
capable 7
of 7
whatever 7
befalls 7
me 7
i 7
cannot 7
forbear 7
asking 7
why 7
you 7
daub 7
your 7
faces 7
with 7
black 7
and 7
how 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
are 7
all 7
blind 7
of 7
one 7
eye 7
but 7
they 7
only 7
answered 7
that 7
such 7
questions 7
were 7
none 7
of 7
my 7
business 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
do 7
well 7
to 7
hold 7
my 7
peace 7
during 7
that 7
day 7
we 7
spoke 7
of 7
other 7
things 7
but 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
and 7
the 7
same 7
ceremony 7
was 7
repeated 7
i 7
implored 7
them 7
most 7
earnestly 7
to 7
let 7
me 7
know 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
it 7
all 7
it 7
is 7
for 7
your 7
own 7
sake 7
replied 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
not 7
granted 7
your 7
request 7
and 7
to 7
preserve 7
you 7
from 7
our 7
unfortunate 7
fate 7
if 7
however 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
share 7
our 7
destiny 7
we 7
will 7
delay 7
no 7
longer 7
i 7
answered 7
that 7
whatever 7
might 7
be 7
the 7
consequence 7
i 7
wished 7
to 7
have 7
my 7
curiosity 7
satisfied 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
take 7
the 7
result 7
on 7
my 7
own 7
head 7
he 7
then 7
assured 7
me 7
that 7
even 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
lost 7
my 7
eye 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
unable 7
to 7
remain 7
with 7
them 7
as 7
their 7
number 7
was 7
complete 7
and 7
could 7
not 7
be 7
added 7
to 7
but 7
to 7
this 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
though 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
grieved 7
to 7
part 7
company 7
with 7
such 7
honest 7
gentlemen 7
i 7
would 7
not 7
be 7
turned 7
from 7
my 7
resolution 7
on 7
that 7
account 7
on 7
hearing 7
my 7
determination 7
my 7
ten 7
hosts 7
then 7
took 7
a 7
sheep 7
and 7
killed 7
it 7
and 7
handed 7
me 7
a 7
knife 7
which 7
they 7
said 7
i 7
should 7
byandby 7
find 7
useful 7
we 7
must 7
sew 7
you 7
into 7
this 7
sheepskin 7
said 7
they 7
and 7
then 7
leave 7
you 7
a 7
fowl 7
of 7
monstrous 7
size 7
called 7
a 7
roc 7
will 7
appear 7
in 7
the 7
air 7
taking 7
you 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
sheep 7
he 7
will 7
snatch 7
you 7
up 7
and 7
carry 7
you 7
into 7
the 7
sky 7
but 7
be 7
not 7
alarmed 7
for 7
he 7
will 7
bring 7
you 7
safely 7
down 7
and 7
lay 7
you 7
on 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
a 7
mountain 7
when 7
you 7
are 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
cut 7
the 7
skin 7
with 7
the 7
knife 7
and 7
throw 7
it 7
off 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
roc 7
sees 7
you 7
he 7
will 7
fly 7
away 7
from 7
fear 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
walk 7
on 7
till 7
you 7
come 7
to 7
a 7
castle 7
covered 7
with 7
plates 7
of 7
gold 7
studded 7
with 7
jewels 7
enter 7
boldly 7
at 7
the 7
gate 7
which 7
always 7
stands 7
open 7
but 7
do 7
not 7
ask 7
us 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
what 7
we 7
saw 7
or 7
what 7
befel 7
us 7
there 7
for 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
learn 7
for 7
yourself 7
this 7
only 7
we 7
may 7
say 7
that 7
it 7
cost 7
us 7
each 7
our 7
right 7
eye 7
and 7
has 7
imposed 7
upon 7
us 7
our 7
nightly 7
penance 7
after 7
the 7
young 7
gentlemen 7
had 7
been 7
at 7
the 7
trouble 7
of 7
sewing 7
the 7
sheepskin 7
on 7
me 7
they 7
left 7
me 7
and 7
retired 7
to 7
the 7
hall 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
the 7
roc 7
appeared 7
and 7
bore 7
me 7
off 7
to 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
in 7
his 7
huge 7
claws 7
as 7
lightly 7
as 7
if 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
a 7
feather 7
for 7
this 7
great 7
white 7
bird 7
is 7
so 7
strong 7
that 7
he 7
has 7
been 7
known 7
to 7
carry 7
even 7
an 7
elephant 7
to 7
his 7
nest 7
in 7
the 7
hills 7
the 7
moment 7
my 7
feet 7
touched 7
the 7
ground 7
i 7
took 7
out 7
my 7
knife 7
and 7
cut 7
the 7
threads 7
that 7
bound 7
me 7
and 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
me 7
in 7
my 7
proper 7
clothes 7
so 7
alarmed 7
the 7
roc 7
that 7
he 7
spread 7
his 7
wings 7
and 7
flew 7
away 7
then 7
i 7
set 7
out 7
to 7
seek 7
the 7
castle 7
i 7
found 7
it 7
after 7
wandering 7
about 7
for 7
half 7
a 7
day 7
and 7
never 7
could 7
i 7
have 7
imagined 7
anything 7
so 7
glorious 7
the 7
gate 7
led 7
into 7
a 7
square 7
court 7
into 7
which 7
opened 7
a 7
hundred 7
doors 7
ninetynine 7
of 7
them 7
being 7
of 7
rare 7
woods 7
and 7
one 7
of 7
gold 7
through 7
each 7
of 7
these 7
doors 7
i 7
caught 7
glimpses 7
of 7
splendid 7
gardens 7
or 7
of 7
rich 7
storehouses 7
entering 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
doors 7
which 7
was 7
standing 7
open 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
a 7
vast 7
hall 7
where 7
forty 7
young 7
ladies 7
magnificently 7
dressed 7
and 7
of 7
perfect 7
beauty 7
were 7
reclining 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
saw 7
me 7
they 7
rose 7
and 7
uttered 7
words 7
of 7
welcome 7
and 7
even 7
forced 7
me 7
to 7
take 7
possession 7
of 7
a 7
seat 7
that 7
was 7
higher 7
than 7
their 7
own 7
though 7
my 7
proper 7
place 7
was 7
at 7
their 7
feet 7
not 7
content 7
with 7
this 7
one 7
brought 7
me 7
splendid 7
garments 7
while 7
another 7
filled 7
a 7
basin 7
with 7
scented 7
water 7
and 7
poured 7
it 7
over 7
my 7
hands 7
and 7
the 7
rest 7
busied 7
themselves 7
with 7
preparing 7
refreshments 7
after 7
i 7
had 7
eaten 7
and 7
drunk 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
delicate 7
food 7
and 7
rarest 7
wines 7
the 7
ladies 7
crowded 7
round 7
me 7
and 7
begged 7
me 7
to 7
tell 7
them 7
all 7
my 7
adventures 7
by 7
the 7
time 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
night 7
had 7
fallen 7
and 7
the 7
ladies 7
lighted 7
up 7
the 7
castle 7
with 7
such 7
a 7
prodigious 7
quantity 7
of 7
tapers 7
that 7
even 7
day 7
could 7
hardly 7
have 7
been 7
brighter 7
we 7
then 7
sat 7
down 7
to 7
a 7
supper 7
of 7
dried 7
fruits 7
and 7
sweetmeats 7
after 7
which 7
some 7
sang 7
and 7
others 7
danced 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
well 7
amused 7
that 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
notice 7
how 7
the 7
time 7
was 7
passing 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
ladies 7
approached 7
and 7
informed 7
me 7
it 7
was 7
midnight 7
and 7
that 7
as 7
i 7
must 7
be 7
tired 7
she 7
would 7
conduct 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
room 7
that 7
had 7
been 7
prepared 7
for 7
me 7
then 7
bidding 7
me 7
goodnight 7
i 7
was 7
left 7
to 7
sleep 7
i 7
spent 7
the 7
next 7
thirtynine 7
days 7
in 7
much 7
the 7
same 7
way 7
as 7
the 7
first 7
but 7
at 7
the 7
close 7
of 7
that 7
time 7
the 7
ladies 7
appeared 7
as 7
was 7
their 7
custom 7
in 7
my 7
room 7
one 7
morning 7
to 7
inquire 7
how 7
i 7
had 7
slept 7
and 7
instead 7
of 7
looking 7
cheerful 7
and 7
smiling 7
they 7
were 7
in 7
floods 7
of 7
tears 7
prince 7
said 7
they 7
we 7
must 7
leave 7
you 7
and 7
never 7
was 7
it 7
so 7
hard 7
to 7
part 7
from 7
any 7
of 7
our 7
friends 7
most 7
likely 7
we 7
shall 7
never 7
see 7
you 7
again 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
have 7
sufficient 7
selfcommand 7
perhaps 7
we 7
may 7
yet 7
look 7
forward 7
to 7
a 7
meeting 7
ladies 7
i 7
replied 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
these 7
strange 7
words 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
know 7
then 7
answered 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
that 7
we 7
are 7
all 7
princesses 7
each 7
a 7
kings 7
daughter 7
we 7
live 7
in 7
this 7
castle 7
together 7
in 7
the 7
way 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
seen 7
but 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
every 7
year 7
secret 7
duties 7
call 7
us 7
away 7
for 7
the 7
space 7
of 7
forty 7
days 7
the 7
time 7
has 7
now 7
come 7
but 7
before 7
we 7
depart 7
we 7
will 7
leave 7
you 7
our 7
keys 7
so 7
that 7
you 7
may 7
not 7
lack 7
entertainment 7
during 7
our 7
absence 7
but 7
one 7
thing 7
we 7
would 7
ask 7
of 7
you 7
the 7
golden 7
door 7
alone 7
forbear 7
to 7
open 7
as 7
you 7
value 7
your 7
own 7
peace 7
and 7
the 7
happiness 7
of 7
your 7
life 7
that 7
door 7
once 7
unlocked 7
we 7
must 7
bid 7
you 7
farewell 7
for 7
ever 7
weeping 7
i 7
assured 7
them 7
of 7
my 7
prudence 7
and 7
after 7
embracing 7
me 7
tenderly 7
they 7
went 7
their 7
ways 7
every 7
day 7
i 7
opened 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
fresh 7
doors 7
each 7
of 7
which 7
contained 7
behind 7
it 7
so 7
many 7
curious 7
things 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
no 7
chance 7
of 7
feeling 7
dull 7
much 7
as 7
i 7
regretted 7
the 7
absence 7
of 7
the 7
ladies 7
sometimes 7
it 7
was 7
an 7
orchard 7
whose 7
fruit 7
far 7
exceeded 7
in 7
bigness 7
any 7
that 7
grew 7
in 7
my 7
fathers 7
garden 7
sometimes 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
court 7
planted 7
with 7
roses 7
jessamine 7
dafeodils 7
hyacinths 7
and 7
anemones 7
and 7
a 7
thousand 7
other 7
flowers 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
the 7
names 7
or 7
again 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
an 7
aviary 7
fitted 7
with 7
all 7
kinds 7
of 7
singing 7
birds 7
or 7
a 7
treasury 7
heaped 7
up 7
with 7
precious 7
stones 7
but 7
whatever 7
i 7
might 7
see 7
all 7
was 7
perfect 7
of 7
its 7
own 7
sort 7
thirtynine 7
days 7
passed 7
away 7
more 7
rapidly 7
than 7
i 7
could 7
have 7
conceived 7
possible 7
and 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
the 7
princesses 7
were 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
castle 7
but 7
alas 7
i 7
had 7
explored 7
every 7
corner 7
save 7
only 7
the 7
room 7
that 7
was 7
shut 7
in 7
by 7
the 7
golden 7
door 7
and 7
i 7
had 7
no 7
longer 7
anything 7
to 7
amuse 7
myself 7
with 7
i 7
stood 7
before 7
the 7
forbidden 7
place 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
gazing 7
at 7
its 7
beauty 7
then 7
a 7
happy 7
inspiration 7
struck 7
me 7
that 7
because 7
i 7
unlocked 7
the 7
door 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
necessary 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
enter 7
the 7
chamber 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
enough 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
stand 7
outside 7
and 7
view 7
whatever 7
hidden 7
wonders 7
might 7
be 7
therein 7
thus 7
arguing 7
against 7
my 7
own 7
conscience 7
i 7
turned 7
the 7
key 7
when 7
a 7
smell 7
rushed 7
out 7
that 7
pleasant 7
though 7
it 7
was 7
overcame 7
me 7
completely 7
and 7
i 7
fell 7
fainting 7
across 7
the 7
threshold 7
instead 7
of 7
being 7
warned 7
by 7
this 7
accident 7
directly 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
myself 7
i 7
went 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
to 7
shake 7
of 7
the 7
effects 7
of 7
the 7
perfume 7
and 7
then 7
entered 7
boldly 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
a 7
large 7
vaulted 7
room 7
lighted 7
by 7
tapers 7
scented 7
with 7
aloes 7
and 7
ambergris 7
standing 7
in 7
golden 7
candlesticks 7
whilst 7
gold 7
and 7
silver 7
lamps 7
hung 7
from 7
the 7
ceiling 7
though 7
objects 7
of 7
rare 7
workmanship 7
lay 7
heaped 7
around 7
me 7
i 7
paid 7
them 7
scant 7
attention 7
so 7
much 7
was 7
i 7
struck 7
by 7
a 7
great 7
black 7
horse 7
which 7
stood 7
in 7
one 7
corner 7
the 7
handsomest 7
and 7
bestshaped 7
animal 7
i 7
had 7
ever 7
seen 7
his 7
saddle 7
and 7
bridle 7
were 7
of 7
massive 7
gold 7
curiously 7
wrought 7
one 7
side 7
of 7
his 7
trough 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
clean 7
barley 7
and 7
sesame 7
and 7
the 7
other 7
with 7
rose 7
water 7
i 7
led 7
the 7
animal 7
into 7
the 7
open 7
air 7
and 7
then 7
jumped 7
on 7
his 7
back 7
shaking 7
the 7
reins 7
as 7
i 7
did 7
so 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
never 7
stirred 7
i 7
touched 7
him 7
lightly 7
with 7
a 7
switch 7
i 7
had 7
picked 7
up 7
in 7
his 7
stable 7
no 7
sooner 7
did 7
he 7
feel 7
the 7
stroke 7
than 7
he 7
spread 7
his 7
wings 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
perceived 7
before 7
and 7
flew 7
up 7
with 7
me 7
straight 7
into 7
the 7
sky 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
reached 7
a 7
prodigious 7
height 7
he 7
next 7
darted 7
back 7
to 7
earth 7
and 7
alighted 7
on 7
the 7
terrace 7
belonging 7
to 7
a 7
castle 7
shaking 7
me 7
violently 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
saddle 7
as 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
and 7
giving 7
me 7
such 7
a 7
blow 7
with 7
his 7
tail 7
that 7
he 7
knocked 7
out 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
halfstunned 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
with 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
happened 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
rose 7
to 7
my 7
feet 7
thinking 7
as 7
i 7
did 7
so 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
befallen 7
the 7
ten 7
young 7
men 7
and 7
watching 7
the 7
horse 7
which 7
was 7
soaring 7
into 7
the 7
clouds 7
i 7
left 7
the 7
terrace 7
and 7
wandered 7
on 7
till 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
a 7
hall 7
which 7
i 7
knew 7
to 7
have 7
been 7
the 7
one 7
from 7
which 7
the 7
roc 7
had 7
taken 7
me 7
by 7
the 7
ten 7
blue 7
sofas 7
against 7
the 7
wall 7
the 7
ten 7
young 7
men 7
were 7
not 7
present 7
when 7
i 7
first 7
entered 7
but 7
came 7
in 7
soon 7
after 7
accompanied 7
by 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
they 7
greeted 7
me 7
kindly 7
and 7
bewailed 7
my 7
misfortune 7
though 7
indeed 7
they 7
had 7
expected 7
nothing 7
less 7
all 7
that 7
has 7
happened 7
to 7
you 7
they 7
said 7
we 7
also 7
have 7
undergone 7
and 7
we 7
should 7
be 7
enjoying 7
the 7
same 7
happiness 7
still 7
had 7
we 7
not 7
opened 7
the 7
golden 7
door 7
while 7
the 7
princesses 7
were 7
absent 7
you 7
have 7
been 7
no 7
wiser 7
than 7
we 7
and 7
have 7
suffered 7
the 7
same 7
punishment 7
we 7
would 7
gladly 7
receive 7
you 7
among 7
us 7
to 7
perform 7
such 7
penance 7
as 7
we 7
do 7
but 7
we 7
have 7
already 7
told 7
you 7
that 7
this 7
is 7
impossible 7
depart 7
therefore 7
from 7
hence 7
and 7
go 7
to 7
the 7
court 7
of 7
bagdad 7
where 7
you 7
shall 7
meet 7
with 7
him 7
that 7
can 7
decide 7
your 7
destiny 7
they 7
told 7
me 7
the 7
way 7
i 7
was 7
to 7
travel 7
and 7
i 7
left 7
them 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
i 7
caused 7
my 7
beard 7
and 7
eyebrows 7
to 7
be 7
shaved 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
a 7
calenders 7
habit 7
i 7
have 7
had 7
a 7
long 7
journey 7
but 7
arrived 7
this 7
evening 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
where 7
i 7
met 7
my 7
brother 7
calenders 7
at 7
the 7
gate 7
being 7
strangers 7
like 7
myself 7
we 7
wondered 7
much 7
at 7
one 7
another 7
to 7
see 7
we 7
were 7
all 7
blind 7
of 7
the 7
same 7
eye 7
but 7
we 7
had 7
no 7
leisure 7
to 7
discourse 7
at 7
length 7
of 7
our 7
common 7
calamities 7
we 7
had 7
only 7
so 7
much 7
time 7
as 7
to 7
come 7
hither 7
to 7
implore 7
those 7
favours 7
which 7
you 7
have 7
been 7
generously 7
pleased 7
to 7
grant 7
us 7
he 7
finished 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
zobeidas 7
turn 7
to 7
speak 7
go 7
wherever 7
you 7
please 7
she 7
said 7
addressing 7
all 7
three 7
i 7
pardon 7
you 7
all 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
depart 7
immediately 7
out 7
of 7
this 7
house 7
the 7
seven 7
voyages 7
of 7
sindbad 7
the 7
sailor 7
in 7
the 7
times 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
there 7
lived 7
in 7
bagdad 7
a 7
poor 7
porter 7
named 7
hindbad 7
who 7
on 7
a 7
very 7
hot 7
day 7
was 7
sent 7
to 7
carry 7
a 7
heavy 7
load 7
from 7
one 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
city 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
accomplished 7
half 7
the 7
distance 7
he 7
was 7
so 7
tired 7
that 7
finding 7
himself 7
in 7
a 7
quiet 7
street 7
where 7
the 7
pavement 7
was 7
sprinkled 7
with 7
rose 7
water 7
and 7
a 7
cool 7
breeze 7
was 7
blowing 7
he 7
set 7
his 7
burden 7
upon 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
sat 7
down 7
to 7
rest 7
in 7
the 7
shade 7
of 7
a 7
grand 7
house 7
very 7
soon 7
he 7
decided 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
chosen 7
a 7
pleasanter 7
place 7
a 7
delicious 7
perfume 7
of 7
aloes 7
wood 7
and 7
pastilles 7
came 7
from 7
the 7
open 7
windows 7
and 7
mingled 7
with 7
the 7
scent 7
of 7
the 7
rose 7
water 7
which 7
steamed 7
up 7
from 7
the 7
hot 7
pavement 7
within 7
the 7
palace 7
he 7
heard 7
some 7
music 7
as 7
of 7
many 7
instruments 7
cunningly 7
played 7
and 7
the 7
melodious 7
warble 7
of 7
nightingales 7
and 7
other 7
birds 7
and 7
by 7
this 7
and 7
the 7
appetising 7
smell 7
of 7
many 7
dainty 7
dishes 7
of 7
which 7
he 7
presently 7
became 7
aware 7
he 7
judged 7
that 7
feasting 7
and 7
merry 7
making 7
were 7
going 7
on 7
he 7
wondered 7
who 7
lived 7
in 7
this 7
magnificent 7
house 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
never 7
seen 7
before 7
the 7
street 7
in 7
which 7
it 7
stood 7
being 7
one 7
which 7
he 7
seldom 7
had 7
occasion 7
to 7
pass 7
to 7
satisfy 7
his 7
curiosity 7
he 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
some 7
splendidly 7
dressed 7
servants 7
who 7
stood 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
asked 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
the 7
name 7
of 7
the 7
master 7
of 7
the 7
mansion 7
what 7
replied 7
he 7
do 7
you 7
live 7
in 7
bagdad 7
and 7
not 7
know 7
that 7
here 7
lives 7
the 7
noble 7
sindbad 7
the 7
sailor 7
that 7
famous 7
traveller 7
who 7
sailed 7
over 7
every 7
sea 7
upon 7
which 7
the 7
sun 7
shines 7
the 7
porter 7
who 7
had 7
often 7
heard 7
people 7
speak 7
of 7
the 7
immense 7
wealth 7
of 7
sindbad 7
could 7
not 7
help 7
feeling 7
envious 7
of 7
one 7
whose 7
lot 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
as 7
happy 7
as 7
his 7
own 7
was 7
miserable 7
casting 7
his 7
eyes 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
sky 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
aloud 7
consider 7
mighty 7
creator 7
of 7
all 7
things 7
the 7
differences 7
between 7
sindbads 7
life 7
and 7
mine 7
every 7
day 7
i 7
suffer 7
a 7
thousand 7
hardships 7
and 7
misfortunes 7
and 7
have 7
hard 7
work 7
to 7
get 7
even 7
enough 7
bad 7
barley 7
bread 7
to 7
keep 7
myself 7
and 7
my 7
family 7
alive 7
while 7
the 7
lucky 7
sindbad 7
spends 7
money 7
right 7
and 7
left 7
and 7
lives 7
upon 7
the 7
fat 7
of 7
the 7
land 7
what 7
has 7
he 7
done 7
that 7
you 7
should 7
give 7
him 7
this 7
pleasant 7
life 7
what 7
have 7
i 7
done 7
to 7
deserve 7
so 7
hard 7
a 7
fate 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
stamped 7
upon 7
the 7
ground 7
like 7
one 7
beside 7
himself 7
with 7
misery 7
and 7
despair 7
just 7
at 7
this 7
moment 7
a 7
servant 7
came 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
taking 7
him 7
by 7
the 7
arm 7
said 7
come 7
with 7
me 7
the 7
noble 7
sindbad 7
my 7
master 7
wishes 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
you 7
hindbad 7
was 7
not 7
a 7
little 7
surprised 7
at 7
this 7
summons 7
and 7
feared 7
that 7
his 7
unguarded 7
words 7
might 7
have 7
drawn 7
upon 7
him 7
the 7
displeasure 7
of 7
sindbad 7
so 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
excuse 7
himself 7
upon 7
the 7
pretext 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
leave 7
the 7
burden 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
entrusted 7
to 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
street 7
however 7
the 7
lackey 7
promised 7
him 7
that 7
it 7
should 7
be 7
taken 7
care 7
of 7
and 7
urged 7
him 7
to 7
obey 7
the 7
call 7
so 7
pressingly 7
that 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
porter 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
yield 7
he 7
followed 7
the 7
servant 7
into 7
a 7
vast 7
room 7
where 7
a 7
great 7
company 7
was 7
seated 7
round 7
a 7
table 7
covered 7
with 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
delicacies 7
in 7
the 7
place 7
of 7
honour 7
sat 7
a 7
tall 7
grave 7
man 7
whose 7
long 7
white 7
beard 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
venerable 7
air 7
behind 7
his 7
chair 7
stood 7
a 7
crowd 7
of 7
attendants 7
eager 7
to 7
minister 7
to 7
his 7
wants 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
famous 7
sindbad 7
himself 7
the 7
porter 7
more 7
than 7
ever 7
alarmed 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
so 7
much 7
magnificence 7
tremblingly 7
saluted 7
the 7
noble 7
company 7
sindbad 7
making 7
a 7
sign 7
to 7
him 7
to 7
approach 7
caused 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
seated 7
at 7
his 7
right 7
hand 7
and 7
himself 7
heaped 7
choice 7
morsels 7
upon 7
his 7
plate 7
and 7
poured 7
out 7
for 7
him 7
a 7
draught 7
of 7
excellent 7
wine 7
and 7
presently 7
when 7
the 7
banquet 7
drew 7
to 7
a 7
close 7
spoke 7
to 7
him 7
familiarly 7
asking 7
his 7
name 7
and 7
occupation 7
my 7
lord 7
replied 7
the 7
porter 7
i 7
am 7
called 7
hindbad 7
i 7
am 7
glad 7
to 7
see 7
you 7
here 7
continued 7
sindbad 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
answer 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
company 7
that 7
they 7
are 7
equally 7
pleased 7
but 7
i 7
wish 7
you 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
it 7
was 7
that 7
you 7
said 7
just 7
now 7
in 7
the 7
street 7
for 7
sindbad 7
passing 7
by 7
the 7
open 7
window 7
before 7
the 7
feast 7
began 7
had 7
heard 7
his 7
complaint 7
and 7
therefore 7
had 7
sent 7
for 7
him 7
at 7
this 7
question 7
hindbad 7
was 7
covered 7
with 7
confusion 7
and 7
hanging 7
down 7
his 7
head 7
replied 7
my 7
lord 7
i 7
confess 7
that 7
overcome 7
by 7
weariness 7
and 7
illhumour 7
i 7
uttered 7
indiscreet 7
words 7
which 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
pardon 7
me 7
oh 7
replied 7
sindbad 7
do 7
not 7
imagine 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
so 7
unjust 7
as 7
to 7
blame 7
you 7
on 7
the 7
contrary 7
i 7
understand 7
your 7
situation 7
and 7
can 7
pity 7
you 7
only 7
you 7
appear 7
to 7
be 7
mistaken 7
about 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
wish 7
to 7
set 7
you 7
right 7
you 7
doubtless 7
imagine 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
acquired 7
all 7
the 7
wealth 7
and 7
luxury 7
that 7
you 7
see 7
me 7
enjoy 7
without 7
difficulty 7
or 7
danger 7
but 7
this 7
is 7
far 7
indeed 7
from 7
being 7
the 7
case 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
reached 7
this 7
happy 7
state 7
after 7
having 7
for 7
years 7
suffered 7
every 7
possible 7
kind 7
of 7
toil 7
and 7
danger 7
yes 7
my 7
noble 7
friends 7
he 7
continued 7
addressing 7
the 7
company 7
l 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
my 7
adventures 7
have 7
been 7
strange 7
enough 7
to 7
deter 7
even 7
the 7
most 7
avaricious 7
men 7
from 7
seeking 7
wealth 7
by 7
traversing 7
the 7
seas 7
since 7
you 7
have 7
perhaps 7
heard 7
but 7
confused 7
accounts 7
of 7
my 7
seven 7
voyages 7
and 7
the 7
dangers 7
and 7
wonders 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
met 7
with 7
by 7
sea 7
and 7
land 7
i 7
will 7
now 7
give 7
you 7
a 7
full 7
and 7
true 7
account 7
of 7
them 7
which 7
i 7
think 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
well 7
pleased 7
to 7
hear 7
as 7
sindbad 7
was 7
relating 7
his 7
adventures 7
chiefly 7
on 7
account 7
of 7
the 7
porter 7
he 7
ordered 7
before 7
beginning 7
his 7
tale 7
that 7
the 7
burden 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
left 7
in 7
the 7
street 7
should 7
be 7
carried 7
by 7
some 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
servants 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
for 7
which 7
hindbad 7
had 7
set 7
out 7
at 7
first 7
while 7
he 7
remained 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
the 7
story 7
first 7
voyage 7
i 7
had 7
inherited 7
considerable 7
wealth 7
from 7
my 7
parents 7
and 7
being 7
young 7
and 7
foolish 7
i 7
at 7
first 7
squandered 7
it 7
recklessly 7
upon 7
every 7
kind 7
of 7
pleasure 7
but 7
presently 7
finding 7
that 7
riches 7
speedily 7
take 7
to 7
themselves 7
wings 7
if 7
managed 7
as 7
badly 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
managing 7
mine 7
and 7
remembering 7
also 7
that 7
to 7
be 7
old 7
and 7
poor 7
is 7
misery 7
indeed 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
bethink 7
me 7
of 7
how 7
i 7
could 7
make 7
the 7
best 7
of 7
what 7
still 7
remained 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
sold 7
all 7
my 7
household 7
goods 7
by 7
public 7
auction 7
and 7
joined 7
a 7
company 7
of 7
merchants 7
who 7
traded 7
by 7
sea 7
embarking 7
with 7
them 7
at 7
balsora 7
in 7
a 7
ship 7
which 7
we 7
had 7
fitted 7
out 7
between 7
us 7
we 7
set 7
sail 7
and 7
took 7
our 7
course 7
towards 7
the 7
east 7
indies 7
by 7
the 7
persian 7
gulf 7
having 7
the 7
coast 7
of 7
persia 7
upon 7
our 7
left 7
hand 7
and 7
upon 7
our 7
right 7
the 7
shores 7
of 7
arabia 7
felix 7
i 7
was 7
at 7
first 7
much 7
troubled 7
by 7
the 7
uneasy 7
motion 7
of 7
the 7
vessel 7
but 7
speedily 7
recovered 7
my 7
health 7
and 7
since 7
that 7
hour 7
have 7
been 7
no 7
more 7
plagued 7
by 7
seasickness 7
from 7
time 7
to 7
time 7
we 7
landed 7
at 7
various 7
islands 7
where 7
we 7
sold 7
or 7
exchanged 7
our 7
merchandise 7
and 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
the 7
wind 7
dropped 7
suddenly 7
we 7
found 7
ourselves 7
becalmed 7
close 7
to 7
a 7
small 7
island 7
like 7
a 7
green 7
meadow 7
which 7
only 7
rose 7
slightly 7
above 7
the 7
surface 7
of 7
the 7
water 7
our 7
sails 7
were 7
furled 7
and 7
the 7
captain 7
gave 7
permission 7
to 7
all 7
who 7
wished 7
to 7
land 7
for 7
a 7
while 7
and 7
amuse 7
themselves 7
i 7
was 7
among 7
the 7
number 7
but 7
when 7
after 7
strolling 7
about 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
we 7
lighted 7
a 7
fire 7
and 7
sat 7
down 7
to 7
enjoy 7
the 7
repast 7
which 7
we 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
us 7
we 7
were 7
startled 7
by 7
a 7
sudden 7
and 7
violent 7
trembling 7
of 7
the 7
island 7
while 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
moment 7
those 7
left 7
upon 7
the 7
ship 7
set 7
up 7
an 7
outcry 7
bidding 7
us 7
come 7
on 7
board 7
for 7
our 7
lives 7
since 7
what 7
we 7
had 7
taken 7
for 7
an 7
island 7
was 7
nothing 7
but 7
the 7
back 7
of 7
a 7
sleeping 7
whale 7
those 7
who 7
were 7
nearest 7
to 7
the 7
boat 7
threw 7
themselves 7
into 7
it 7
others 7
sprang 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
but 7
before 7
i 7
could 7
save 7
myself 7
the 7
whale 7
plunged 7
suddenly 7
into 7
the 7
depths 7
of 7
the 7
ocean 7
leaving 7
me 7
clinging 7
to 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
the 7
wood 7
which 7
we 7
had 7
brought 7
to 7
make 7
our 7
fire 7
meanwhile 7
a 7
breeze 7
had 7
sprung 7
up 7
and 7
in 7
the 7
confusion 7
that 7
ensued 7
on 7
board 7
our 7
vessel 7
in 7
hoisting 7
the 7
sails 7
and 7
taking 7
up 7
those 7
who 7
were 7
in 7
the 7
boat 7
and 7
clinging 7
to 7
its 7
sides 7
no 7
one 7
missed 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
left 7
at 7
the 7
mercy 7
of 7
the 7
waves 7
all 7
that 7
day 7
i 7
floated 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
now 7
beaten 7
this 7
way 7
now 7
that 7
and 7
when 7
night 7
fell 7
i 7
despaired 7
for 7
my 7
life 7
but 7
weary 7
and 7
spent 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
i 7
clung 7
to 7
my 7
frail 7
support 7
and 7
great 7
was 7
my 7
joy 7
when 7
the 7
morning 7
light 7
showed 7
me 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
drifted 7
against 7
an 7
island 7
the 7
cliffs 7
were 7
high 7
and 7
steep 7
but 7
luckily 7
for 7
me 7
some 7
treeroots 7
protruded 7
in 7
places 7
and 7
by 7
their 7
aid 7
i 7
climbed 7
up 7
at 7
last 7
and 7
stretched 7
myself 7
upon 7
the 7
turf 7
at 7
the 7
top 7
where 7
i 7
lay 7
more 7
dead 7
than 7
alive 7
till 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
high 7
in 7
the 7
heavens 7
by 7
that 7
time 7
i 7
was 7
very 7
hungry 7
but 7
after 7
some 7
searching 7
i 7
came 7
upon 7
some 7
eatable 7
herbs 7
and 7
a 7
spring 7
of 7
clear 7
water 7
and 7
much 7
refreshed 7
i 7
set 7
out 7
to 7
explore 7
the 7
island 7
presently 7
i 7
reached 7
a 7
great 7
plain 7
where 7
a 7
grazing 7
horse 7
was 7
tethered 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
stood 7
looking 7
at 7
it 7
i 7
heard 7
voices 7
talking 7
apparently 7
underground 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
a 7
man 7
appeared 7
who 7
asked 7
me 7
how 7
i 7
came 7
upon 7
the 7
island 7
i 7
told 7
him 7
my 7
adventures 7
and 7
heard 7
in 7
return 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
grooms 7
of 7
mihrage 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
island 7
and 7
that 7
each 7
year 7
they 7
came 7
to 7
feed 7
their 7
masters 7
horses 7
in 7
this 7
plain 7
he 7
took 7
me 7
to 7
a 7
cave 7
where 7
his 7
companions 7
were 7
assembled 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
eaten 7
of 7
the 7
food 7
they 7
set 7
before 7
me 7
they 7
bade 7
me 7
think 7
myself 7
fortunate 7
to 7
have 7
come 7
upon 7
them 7
when 7
i 7
did 7
since 7
they 7
were 7
going 7
back 7
to 7
their 7
master 7
on 7
the 7
morrow 7
and 7
without 7
their 7
aid 7
i 7
could 7
certainly 7
never 7
have 7
found 7
my 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
inhabited 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
island 7
early 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
we 7
accordingly 7
set 7
out 7
and 7
when 7
we 7
reached 7
the 7
capital 7
i 7
was 7
graciously 7
received 7
by 7
the 7
king 7
to 7
whom 7
i 7
related 7
my 7
adventures 7
upon 7
which 7
he 7
ordered 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
well 7
cared 7
for 7
and 7
provided 7
with 7
such 7
things 7
as 7
i 7
needed 7
being 7
a 7
merchant 7
i 7
sought 7
out 7
men 7
of 7
my 7
own 7
profession 7
and 7
particularly 7
those 7
who 7
came 7
from 7
foreign 7
countries 7
as 7
i 7
hoped 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
to 7
hear 7
news 7
from 7
bagdad 7
and 7
find 7
out 7
some 7
means 7
of 7
returning 7
thither 7
for 7
the 7
capital 7
was 7
situated 7
upon 7
the 7
seashore 7
and 7
visited 7
by 7
vessels 7
from 7
all 7
parts 7
of 7
the 7
world 7
in 7
the 7
meantime 7
i 7
heard 7
many 7
curious 7
things 7
and 7
answered 7
many 7
questions 7
concerning 7
my 7
own 7
country 7
for 7
i 7
talked 7
willingly 7
with 7
all 7
who 7
came 7
to 7
me 7
also 7
to 7
while 7
away 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
waiting 7
i 7
explored 7
a 7
little 7
island 7
named 7
cassel 7
which 7
belonged 7
to 7
king 7
mihrage 7
and 7
which 7
was 7
supposed 7
to 7
be 7
inhabited 7
by 7
a 7
spirit 7
named 7
deggial 7
indeed 7
the 7
sailors 7
assured 7
me 7
that 7
often 7
at 7
night 7
the 7
playing 7
of 7
timbals 7
could 7
be 7
heard 7
upon 7
it 7
however 7
i 7
saw 7
nothing 7
strange 7
upon 7
my 7
voyage 7
saving 7
some 7
fish 7
that 7
were 7
full 7
two 7
hundred 7
cubits 7
long 7
but 7
were 7
fortunately 7
more 7
in 7
dread 7
of 7
us 7
than 7
even 7
we 7
were 7
of 7
them 7
and 7
fled 7
from 7
us 7
if 7
we 7
did 7
but 7
strike 7
upon 7
a 7
board 7
to 7
frighten 7
them 7
other 7
fishes 7
there 7
were 7
only 7
a 7
cubit 7
long 7
which 7
had 7
heads 7
like 7
owls 7
one 7
day 7
after 7
my 7
return 7
as 7
i 7
went 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
quay 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
ship 7
which 7
had 7
just 7
cast 7
anchor 7
and 7
was 7
discharging 7
her 7
cargo 7
while 7
the 7
merchants 7
to 7
whom 7
it 7
belonged 7
were 7
busily 7
directing 7
the 7
removal 7
of 7
it 7
to 7
their 7
warehouses 7
drawing 7
nearer 7
i 7
presently 7
noticed 7
that 7
my 7
own 7
name 7
was 7
marked 7
upon 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
packages 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
carefully 7
examined 7
them 7
i 7
felt 7
sure 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
indeed 7
those 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
put 7
on 7
board 7
our 7
ship 7
at 7
balsora 7
i 7
then 7
recognised 7
the 7
captain 7
of 7
the 7
vessel 7
but 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
certain 7
that 7
he 7
believed 7
me 7
to 7
be 7
dead 7
i 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
asked 7
who 7
owned 7
the 7
packages 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
looking 7
at 7
there 7
was 7
on 7
board 7
my 7
ship 7
he 7
replied 7
a 7
merchant 7
of 7
bagdad 7
named 7
sindbad 7
one 7
day 7
he 7
and 7
several 7
of 7
my 7
other 7
passengers 7
landed 7
upon 7
what 7
we 7
supposed 7
to 7
be 7
an 7
island 7
but 7
which 7
was 7
really 7
an 7
enormous 7
whale 7
floating 7
asleep 7
upon 7
the 7
waves 7
no 7
sooner 7
did 7
it 7
feel 7
upon 7
its 7
back 7
the 7
heat 7
of 7
the 7
fire 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
kindled 7
than 7
it 7
plunged 7
into 7
the 7
depths 7
of 7
the 7
sea 7
several 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
who 7
were 7
upon 7
it 7
perished 7
in 7
the 7
waters 7
and 7
among 7
others 7
this 7
unlucky 7
sindbad 7
this 7
merchandise 7
is 7
his 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
resolved 7
to 7
dispose 7
of 7
it 7
for 7
the 7
benefit 7
of 7
his 7
family 7
if 7
i 7
should 7
ever 7
chance 7
to 7
meet 7
with 7
them 7
captain 7
said 7
i 7
i 7
am 7
that 7
sindbad 7
whom 7
you 7
believe 7
to 7
be 7
dead 7
and 7
these 7
are 7
my 7
possessions 7
when 7
the 7
captain 7
heard 7
these 7
words 7
he 7
cried 7
out 7
in 7
amazement 7
lackaday 7
and 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
world 7
coming 7
to 7
in 7
these 7
days 7
there 7
is 7
not 7
an 7
honest 7
man 7
to 7
be 7
met 7
with 7
did 7
i 7
not 7
with 7
my 7
own 7
eyes 7
see 7
sindbad 7
drown 7
and 7
now 7
you 7
have 7
the 7
audacity 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
he 7
i 7
should 7
have 7
taken 7
you 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
just 7
man 7
and 7
yet 7
for 7
the 7
sake 7
of 7
obtaining 7
that 7
which 7
does 7
not 7
belong 7
to 7
you 7
you 7
are 7
ready 7
to 7
invent 7
this 7
horrible 7
falsehood 7
have 7
patience 7
and 7
do 7
me 7
the 7
favour 7
to 7
hear 7
my 7
story 7
said 7
i 7
speak 7
then 7
replied 7
the 7
captain 7
im 7
all 7
attention 7
so 7
i 7
told 7
him 7
of 7
my 7
escape 7
and 7
of 7
my 7
fortunate 7
meeting 7
with 7
the 7
kings 7
grooms 7
and 7
how 7
kindly 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
received 7
at 7
the 7
palace 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
made 7
some 7
impression 7
upon 7
him 7
and 7
after 7
the 7
arrival 7
of 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
merchants 7
who 7
showed 7
great 7
joy 7
at 7
once 7
more 7
seeing 7
me 7
alive 7
he 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
also 7
recognised 7
me 7
throwing 7
himself 7
upon 7
my 7
neck 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
heaven 7
be 7
praised 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
escaped 7
from 7
so 7
great 7
a 7
danger 7
as 7
to 7
your 7
goods 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
take 7
them 7
and 7
dispose 7
of 7
them 7
as 7
you 7
please 7
i 7
thanked 7
him 7
and 7
praised 7
his 7
honesty 7
begging 7
him 7
to 7
accept 7
several 7
bales 7
of 7
merchandise 7
in 7
token 7
of 7
my 7
gratitude 7
but 7
he 7
would 7
take 7
nothing 7
of 7
the 7
choicest 7
of 7
my 7
goods 7
i 7
prepared 7
a 7
present 7
for 7
king 7
mihrage 7
who 7
was 7
at 7
first 7
amazed 7
having 7
known 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
lost 7
my 7
all 7
however 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
explained 7
to 7
him 7
how 7
my 7
bales 7
had 7
been 7
miraculously 7
restored 7
to 7
me 7
he 7
graciously 7
accepted 7
my 7
gifts 7
and 7
in 7
return 7
gave 7
me 7
many 7
valuable 7
things 7
i 7
then 7
took 7
leave 7
of 7
him 7
and 7
exchanging 7
my 7
merchandise 7
for 7
sandal 7
and 7
aloes 7
wood 7
camphor 7
nutmegs 7
cloves 7
pepper 7
and 7
ginger 7
i 7
embarked 7
upon 7
the 7
same 7
vessel 7
and 7
traded 7
so 7
successfully 7
upon 7
our 7
homeward 7
voyage 7
that 7
i 7
arrived 7
in 7
balsora 7
with 7
about 7
one 7
hundred 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
my 7
family 7
received 7
me 7
with 7
as 7
much 7
joy 7
as 7
i 7
felt 7
upon 7
seeing 7
them 7
once 7
more 7
i 7
bought 7
land 7
and 7
slaves 7
and 7
built 7
a 7
great 7
house 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
resolved 7
to 7
live 7
happily 7
and 7
in 7
the 7
enjoyment 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
pleasures 7
of 7
life 7
to 7
forget 7
my 7
past 7
sufferings 7
here 7
sindbad 7
paused 7
and 7
commanded 7
the 7
musicians 7
to 7
play 7
again 7
while 7
the 7
feasting 7
continued 7
until 7
evening 7
when 7
the 7
time 7
came 7
for 7
the 7
porter 7
to 7
depart 7
sindbad 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
purse 7
containing 7
one 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
saying 7
take 7
this 7
hindbad 7
and 7
go 7
home 7
but 7
tomorrow 7
come 7
again 7
and 7
you 7
shall 7
hear 7
more 7
of 7
my 7
adventures 7
the 7
porter 7
retired 7
quite 7
overcome 7
by 7
so 7
much 7
generosity 7
and 7
you 7
may 7
imagine 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
well 7
received 7
at 7
home 7
where 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
children 7
thanked 7
their 7
lucky 7
stars 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
found 7
such 7
a 7
benefactor 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
hindbad 7
dressed 7
in 7
his 7
best 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
voyagers 7
house 7
and 7
was 7
received 7
with 7
open 7
arms 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
all 7
the 7
guests 7
had 7
arrived 7
the 7
banquet 7
began 7
as 7
before 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
feasted 7
long 7
and 7
merrily 7
sindbad 7
addressed 7
them 7
thus 7
my 7
friends 7
i 7
beg 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
me 7
your 7
attention 7
while 7
i 7
relate 7
the 7
adventures 7
of 7
my 7
second 7
voyage 7
which 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
even 7
more 7
astonishing 7
than 7
the 7
first 7
second 7
voyage 7
i 7
had 7
resolved 7
as 7
you 7
know 7
on 7
my 7
return 7
from 7
my 7
first 7
voyage 7
to 7
spend 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
my 7
days 7
quietly 7
in 7
bagdad 7
but 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
grew 7
tired 7
of 7
such 7
an 7
idle 7
life 7
and 7
longed 7
once 7
more 7
to 7
find 7
myself 7
upon 7
the 7
sea 7
i 7
procured 7
therefore 7
such 7
goods 7
as 7
were 7
suitable 7
for 7
the 7
places 7
i 7
intended 7
to 7
visit 7
and 7
embarked 7
for 7
the 7
second 7
time 7
in 7
a 7
good 7
ship 7
with 7
other 7
merchants 7
whom 7
i 7
knew 7
to 7
be 7
honourable 7
men 7
we 7
went 7
from 7
island 7
to 7
island 7
often 7
making 7
excellent 7
bargains 7
until 7
one 7
day 7
we 7
landed 7
at 7
a 7
spot 7
which 7
though 7
covered 7
with 7
fruit 7
trees 7
and 7
abounding 7
in 7
springs 7
of 7
excellent 7
water 7
appeared 7
to 7
possess 7
neither 7
houses 7
nor 7
people 7
while 7
my 7
companions 7
wandered 7
here 7
and 7
there 7
gathering 7
flowers 7
and 7
fruit 7
i 7
sat 7
down 7
in 7
a 7
shady 7
place 7
and 7
having 7
heartily 7
enjoyed 7
the 7
provisions 7
and 7
the 7
wine 7
i 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
me 7
i 7
fell 7
asleep 7
lulled 7
by 7
the 7
murmur 7
of 7
a 7
clear 7
brook 7
which 7
flowed 7
close 7
by 7
how 7
long 7
i 7
slept 7
i 7
know 7
not 7
but 7
when 7
i 7
opened 7
my 7
eyes 7
and 7
started 7
to 7
my 7
feet 7
i 7
perceived 7
with 7
horror 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
alone 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
ship 7
was 7
gone 7
i 7
rushed 7
to 7
and 7
fro 7
like 7
one 7
distracted 7
uttering 7
cries 7
of 7
despair 7
and 7
when 7
from 7
the 7
shore 7
i 7
saw 7
the 7
vessel 7
under 7
full 7
sail 7
just 7
disappearing 7
upon 7
the 7
horizon 7
i 7
wished 7
bitterly 7
enough 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
content 7
to 7
stay 7
at 7
home 7
in 7
safety 7
but 7
since 7
wishes 7
could 7
do 7
me 7
no 7
good 7
i 7
presently 7
took 7
courage 7
and 7
looked 7
about 7
me 7
for 7
a 7
means 7
of 7
escape 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
climbed 7
a 7
tall 7
tree 7
i 7
first 7
of 7
all 7
directed 7
my 7
anxious 7
glances 7
towards 7
the 7
sea 7
but 7
finding 7
nothing 7
hopeful 7
there 7
i 7
turned 7
landward 7
and 7
my 7
curiosity 7
was 7
excited 7
by 7
a 7
huge 7
dazzling 7
white 7
object 7
so 7
far 7
off 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
make 7
out 7
what 7
it 7
might 7
be 7
descending 7
from 7
the 7
tree 7
i 7
hastily 7
collected 7
what 7
remained 7
of 7
my 7
provisions 7
and 7
set 7
off 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
go 7
towards 7
it 7
as 7
i 7
drew 7
near 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
white 7
ball 7
of 7
immense 7
size 7
and 7
height 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
could 7
touch 7
it 7
i 7
found 7
it 7
marvellously 7
smooth 7
and 7
soft 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
impossible 7
to 7
climb 7
itfor 7
it 7
presented 7
no 7
foothold 7
i 7
walked 7
round 7
about 7
it 7
seeking 7
some 7
opening 7
but 7
there 7
was 7
none 7
i 7
counted 7
however 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
at 7
least 7
fifty 7
paces 7
round 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
near 7
setting 7
but 7
quite 7
suddenly 7
it 7
fell 7
dark 7
something 7
like 7
a 7
huge 7
black 7
cloud 7
came 7
swiftly 7
over 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
saw 7
with 7
amazement 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
bird 7
of 7
extraordinary 7
size 7
which 7
was 7
hovering 7
near 7
then 7
i 7
remembered 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
often 7
heard 7
the 7
sailors 7
speak 7
of 7
a 7
wonderful 7
bird 7
called 7
a 7
roc 7
and 7
it 7
occurred 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
the 7
white 7
object 7
which 7
had 7
so 7
puzzled 7
me 7
must 7
be 7
its 7
egg 7
sure 7
enough 7
the 7
bird 7
settled 7
slowly 7
down 7
upon 7
it 7
covering 7
it 7
with 7
its 7
wings 7
to 7
keep 7
it 7
warm 7
and 7
i 7
cowered 7
close 7
beside 7
the 7
egg 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
position 7
that 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
birds 7
feet 7
which 7
was 7
as 7
large 7
as 7
the 7
trunk 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
was 7
just 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
me 7
taking 7
off 7
my 7
turban 7
i 7
bound 7
myself 7
securely 7
to 7
it 7
with 7
the 7
linen 7
in 7
the 7
hope 7
that 7
the 7
roc 7
when 7
it 7
took 7
flight 7
next 7
morning 7
would 7
bear 7
me 7
away 7
with 7
it 7
from 7
the 7
desolate 7
island 7
and 7
this 7
was 7
precisely 7
what 7
did 7
happen 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
dawn 7
appeared 7
the 7
bird 7
rose 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
carrying 7
me 7
up 7
and 7
up 7
till 7
i 7
could 7
no 7
longer 7
see 7
the 7
earth 7
and 7
then 7
suddenly 7
it 7
descended 7
so 7
swiftly 7
that 7
i 7
almost 7
lost 7
consciousness 7
when 7
i 7
became 7
aware 7
that 7
the 7
roc 7
had 7
settled 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
once 7
again 7
upon 7
solid 7
ground 7
i 7
hastily 7
unbound 7
my 7
turban 7
from 7
its 7
foot 7
and 7
freed 7
myself 7
and 7
that 7
not 7
a 7
moment 7
too 7
soon 7
for 7
the 7
bird 7
pouncing 7
upon 7
a 7
huge 7
snake 7
killed 7
it 7
with 7
a 7
few 7
blows 7
from 7
its 7
powerful 7
beak 7
and 7
seizing 7
it 7
up 7
rose 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
once 7
more 7
and 7
soon 7
disappeared 7
from 7
my 7
view 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
looked 7
about 7
me 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
doubt 7
if 7
i 7
had 7
gained 7
anything 7
by 7
quitting 7
the 7
desolate 7
island 7
the 7
valley 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
was 7
deep 7
and 7
narrow 7
and 7
surrounded 7
by 7
mountains 7
which 7
towered 7
into 7
the 7
clouds 7
and 7
were 7
so 7
steep 7
and 7
rocky 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
way 7
of 7
climbing 7
up 7
their 7
sides 7
as 7
i 7
wandered 7
about 7
seeking 7
anxiously 7
for 7
some 7
means 7
of 7
escaping 7
from 7
this 7
trap 7
i 7
observed 7
that 7
the 7
ground 7
was 7
strewed 7
with 7
diamonds 7
some 7
of 7
them 7
of 7
an 7
astonishing 7
size 7
this 7
sight 7
gave 7
me 7
great 7
pleasure 7
but 7
my 7
delight 7
was 7
speedily 7
damped 7
when 7
i 7
saw 7
also 7
numbers 7
of 7
horrible 7
snakes 7
so 7
long 7
and 7
so 7
large 7
that 7
the 7
smallest 7
of 7
them 7
could 7
have 7
swallowed 7
an 7
elephant 7
with 7
ease 7
fortunately 7
for 7
me 7
they 7
seemed 7
to 7
hide 7
in 7
caverns 7
of 7
the 7
rocks 7
by 7
day 7
and 7
only 7
came 7
out 7
by 7
night 7
probably 7
because 7
of 7
their 7
enemy 7
the 7
roc 7
all 7
day 7
long 7
i 7
wandered 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
the 7
valley 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
grew 7
dusk 7
i 7
crept 7
into 7
a 7
little 7
cave 7
and 7
having 7
blocked 7
up 7
the 7
entrance 7
to 7
it 7
with 7
a 7
stone 7
i 7
ate 7
part 7
of 7
my 7
little 7
store 7
of 7
food 7
and 7
lay 7
down 7
to 7
sleep 7
but 7
all 7
through 7
the 7
night 7
the 7
serpents 7
crawled 7
to 7
and 7
fro 7
hissing 7
horribly 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
scarcely 7
close 7
my 7
eyes 7
for 7
terror 7
i 7
was 7
thankful 7
when 7
the 7
morning 7
light 7
appeared 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
judged 7
by 7
the 7
silence 7
that 7
the 7
serpents 7
had 7
retreated 7
to 7
their 7
dens 7
i 7
came 7
tremblingly 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
cave 7
and 7
wandered 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
the 7
valley 7
once 7
more 7
kicking 7
the 7
diamonds 7
contemptuously 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
path 7
for 7
i 7
felt 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
indeed 7
vain 7
things 7
to 7
a 7
man 7
in 7
my 7
situation 7
at 7
last 7
overcome 7
with 7
weariness 7
i 7
sat 7
down 7
upon 7
a 7
rock 7
but 7
i 7
had 7
hardly 7
closed 7
my 7
eyes 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
startled 7
by 7
something 7
which 7
fell 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
with 7
a 7
thud 7
close 7
beside 7
me 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
huge 7
piece 7
of 7
fresh 7
meat 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
stared 7
at 7
it 7
several 7
more 7
pieces 7
rolled 7
over 7
the 7
cliffs 7
in 7
different 7
places 7
i 7
had 7
always 7
thought 7
that 7
the 7
stories 7
the 7
sailors 7
told 7
of 7
the 7
famous 7
valley 7
of 7
diamonds 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
cunning 7
way 7
which 7
some 7
merchants 7
had 7
devised 7
for 7
getting 7
at 7
the 7
precious 7
stones 7
were 7
mere 7
travellers 7
tales 7
invented 7
to 7
give 7
pleasure 7
to 7
the 7
hearers 7
but 7
now 7
i 7
perceived 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
surely 7
true 7
these 7
merchants 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
valley 7
at 7
the 7
time 7
when 7
the 7
eagles 7
which 7
keep 7
their 7
eyries 7
in 7
the 7
rocks 7
had 7
hatched 7
their 7
young 7
the 7
merchants 7
then 7
threw 7
great 7
lumps 7
of 7
meat 7
into 7
the 7
valley 7
these 7
falling 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
force 7
upon 7
the 7
diamonds 7
were 7
sure 7
to 7
take 7
up 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
precious 7
stones 7
with 7
them 7
when 7
the 7
eagles 7
pounced 7
upon 7
the 7
meat 7
and 7
carried 7
it 7
off 7
to 7
their 7
nests 7
to 7
feed 7
their 7
hungry 7
broods 7
then 7
the 7
merchants 7
scaring 7
away 7
the 7
parent 7
birds 7
with 7
shouts 7
and 7
outcries 7
would 7
secure 7
their 7
treasures 7
until 7
this 7
moment 7
i 7
had 7
looked 7
upon 7
the 7
valley 7
as 7
my 7
grave 7
for 7
i 7
had 7
seen 7
no 7
possibility 7
of 7
getting 7
out 7
of 7
it 7
alive 7
but 7
now 7
i 7
took 7
courage 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
devise 7
a 7
means 7
of 7
escape 7
i 7
began 7
by 7
picking 7
up 7
all 7
the 7
largest 7
diamonds 7
i 7
could 7
find 7
and 7
storing 7
them 7
carefully 7
in 7
the 7
leathern 7
wallet 7
which 7
had 7
held 7
my 7
provisions 7
this 7
i 7
tied 7
securely 7
to 7
my 7
belt 7
i 7
then 7
chose 7
the 7
piece 7
of 7
meat 7
which 7
seemed 7
most 7
suited 7
to 7
my 7
purpose 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
aid 7
of 7
my 7
turban 7
bound 7
it 7
firmly 7
to 7
my 7
back 7
this 7
done 7
i 7
laid 7
down 7
upon 7
my 7
face 7
and 7
awaited 7
the 7
coming 7
of 7
the 7
eagles 7
i 7
soon 7
heard 7
the 7
flapping 7
of 7
their 7
mighty 7
wings 7
above 7
me 7
and 7
had 7
the 7
satisfaction 7
of 7
feeling 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
seize 7
upon 7
my 7
piece 7
of 7
meat 7
and 7
me 7
with 7
it 7
and 7
rise 7
slowly 7
towards 7
his 7
nest 7
into 7
which 7
he 7
presently 7
dropped 7
me 7
luckily 7
for 7
me 7
the 7
merchants 7
were 7
on 7
the 7
watch 7
and 7
setting 7
up 7
their 7
usual 7
outcries 7
they 7
rushed 7
to 7
the 7
nest 7
scaring 7
away 7
the 7
eagle 7
their 7
amazement 7
was 7
great 7
when 7
they 7
discovered 7
me 7
and 7
also 7
their 7
disappointment 7
and 7
with 7
one 7
accord 7
they 7
fell 7
to 7
abusing 7
me 7
for 7
having 7
robbed 7
them 7
of 7
their 7
usual 7
profit 7
addressing 7
myself 7
to 7
the 7
one 7
who 7
seemed 7
most 7
aggrieved 7
i 7
said 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
if 7
you 7
knew 7
all 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
suffered 7
you 7
would 7
show 7
more 7
kindness 7
towards 7
me 7
and 7
as 7
for 7
diamonds 7
i 7
have 7
enough 7
here 7
of 7
the 7
very 7
best 7
for 7
you 7
and 7
me 7
and 7
all 7
your 7
company 7
so 7
saying 7
i 7
showed 7
them 7
to 7
him 7
the 7
others 7
all 7
crowded 7
round 7
me 7
wondering 7
at 7
my 7
adventures 7
and 7
admiring 7
the 7
device 7
by 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
escaped 7
from 7
the 7
valley 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
led 7
me 7
to 7
their 7
camp 7
and 7
examined 7
my 7
diamonds 7
they 7
assured 7
me 7
that 7
in 7
all 7
the 7
years 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
carried 7
on 7
their 7
trade 7
they 7
had 7
seen 7
no 7
stones 7
to 7
be 7
compared 7
with 7
them 7
for 7
size 7
and 7
beauty 7
i 7
found 7
that 7
each 7
merchant 7
chose 7
a 7
particular 7
nest 7
and 7
took 7
his 7
chance 7
of 7
what 7
he 7
might 7
find 7
in 7
it 7
so 7
i 7
begged 7
the 7
one 7
who 7
owned 7
the 7
nest 7
to 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
carried 7
to 7
take 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
he 7
would 7
of 7
my 7
treasure 7
but 7
he 7
contented 7
himself 7
with 7
one 7
stone 7
and 7
that 7
by 7
no 7
means 7
the 7
largest 7
assuring 7
me 7
that 7
with 7
such 7
a 7
gem 7
his 7
fortune 7
was 7
made 7
and 7
he 7
need 7
toil 7
no 7
more 7
i 7
stayed 7
with 7
the 7
merchants 7
several 7
days 7
and 7
then 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
journeying 7
homewards 7
i 7
gladly 7
accompanied 7
them 7
our 7
way 7
lay 7
across 7
high 7
mountains 7
infested 7
with 7
frightful 7
serpents 7
but 7
we 7
had 7
the 7
good 7
luck 7
to 7
escape 7
them 7
and 7
came 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
the 7
seashore 7
thence 7
we 7
sailed 7
to 7
the 7
isle 7
of 7
rohat 7
where 7
the 7
camphor 7
trees 7
grow 7
to 7
such 7
a 7
size 7
that 7
a 7
hundred 7
men 7
could 7
shelter 7
under 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
with 7
ease 7
the 7
sap 7
flows 7
from 7
an 7
incision 7
made 7
high 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
tree 7
into 7
a 7
vessel 7
hung 7
there 7
to 7
receive 7
it 7
and 7
soon 7
hardens 7
into 7
the 7
substance 7
called 7
camphor 7
but 7
the 7
tree 7
itself 7
withers 7
up 7
and 7
dies 7
when 7
it 7
has 7
been 7
so 7
treated 7
in 7
this 7
same 7
island 7
we 7
saw 7
the 7
rhinoceros 7
an 7
animal 7
which 7
is 7
smaller 7
than 7
the 7
elephant 7
and 7
larger 7
than 7
the 7
buffalo 7
it 7
has 7
one 7
horn 7
about 7
a 7
cubit 7
long 7
which 7
is 7
solid 7
but 7
has 7
a 7
furrow 7
from 7
the 7
base 7
to 7
the 7
tip 7
upon 7
it 7
is 7
traced 7
in 7
white 7
lines 7
the 7
figure 7
of 7
a 7
man 7
the 7
rhinoceros 7
fights 7
with 7
the 7
elephant 7
and 7
transfixing 7
him 7
with 7
his 7
horn 7
carries 7
him 7
off 7
upon 7
his 7
head 7
but 7
becoming 7
blinded 7
with 7
the 7
blood 7
of 7
his 7
enemy 7
he 7
falls 7
helpless 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
then 7
comes 7
the 7
roc 7
and 7
clutches 7
them 7
both 7
up 7
in 7
his 7
talons 7
and 7
takes 7
them 7
to 7
feed 7
his 7
young 7
this 7
doubtless 7
astonishes 7
you 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
believe 7
my 7
tale 7
go 7
to 7
rohat 7
and 7
see 7
for 7
yourself 7
for 7
fear 7
of 7
wearying 7
you 7
i 7
pass 7
over 7
in 7
silence 7
many 7
other 7
wonderful 7
things 7
which 7
we 7
saw 7
in 7
this 7
island 7
before 7
we 7
left 7
i 7
exchanged 7
one 7
of 7
my 7
diamonds 7
for 7
much 7
goodly 7
merchandise 7
by 7
which 7
i 7
profited 7
greatly 7
on 7
our 7
homeward 7
way 7
at 7
last 7
we 7
reached 7
balsora 7
whence 7
i 7
hastened 7
to 7
bagdad 7
where 7
my 7
first 7
action 7
was 7
to 7
bestow 7
large 7
sums 7
of 7
money 7
upon 7
the 7
poor 7
after 7
which 7
i 7
settled 7
down 7
to 7
enjoy 7
tranquilly 7
the 7
riches 7
i 7
had 7
gained 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
toil 7
and 7
pain 7
having 7
thus 7
related 7
the 7
adventures 7
of 7
his 7
second 7
voyage 7
sindbad 7
again 7
bestowed 7
a 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
upon 7
hindbad 7
inviting 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
again 7
on 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
and 7
hear 7
how 7
he 7
fared 7
upon 7
his 7
third 7
voyage 7
the 7
other 7
guests 7
also 7
departed 7
to 7
their 7
homes 7
but 7
all 7
returned 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
hour 7
next 7
day 7
including 7
the 7
porter 7
whose 7
former 7
life 7
of 7
hard 7
work 7
and 7
poverty 7
had 7
already 7
begun 7
to 7
seem 7
to 7
him 7
like 7
a 7
bad 7
dream 7
again 7
after 7
the 7
feast 7
was 7
over 7
did 7
sindbad 7
claim 7
the 7
attention 7
of 7
his 7
guests 7
and 7
began 7
the 7
account 7
of 7
his 7
third 7
voyage 7
third 7
voyage 7
after 7
a 7
very 7
short 7
time 7
the 7
pleasant 7
easy 7
life 7
i 7
led 7
made 7
me 7
quite 7
forget 7
the 7
perils 7
of 7
my 7
two 7
voyages 7
moreover 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
still 7
in 7
the 7
prime 7
of 7
life 7
it 7
pleased 7
me 7
better 7
to 7
be 7
up 7
and 7
doing 7
so 7
once 7
more 7
providing 7
myself 7
with 7
the 7
rarest 7
and 7
choicest 7
merchandise 7
of 7
bagdad 7
i 7
conveyed 7
it 7
to 7
balsora 7
and 7
set 7
sail 7
with 7
other 7
merchants 7
of 7
my 7
acquaintance 7
for 7
distant 7
lands 7
we 7
had 7
touched 7
at 7
many 7
ports 7
and 7
made 7
much 7
profit 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
upon 7
the 7
open 7
sea 7
we 7
were 7
caught 7
by 7
a 7
terrible 7
wind 7
which 7
blew 7
us 7
completely 7
out 7
of 7
our 7
reckoning 7
and 7
lasting 7
for 7
several 7
days 7
finally 7
drove 7
us 7
into 7
harbour 7
on 7
a 7
strange 7
island 7
i 7
would 7
rather 7
have 7
come 7
to 7
anchor 7
anywhere 7
than 7
here 7
quoth 7
our 7
captain 7
this 7
island 7
and 7
all 7
adjoining 7
it 7
are 7
inhabited 7
by 7
hairy 7
savages 7
who 7
are 7
certain 7
to 7
attack 7
us 7
and 7
whatever 7
these 7
dwarfs 7
may 7
do 7
we 7
dare 7
not 7
resist 7
since 7
they 7
swarm 7
like 7
locusts 7
and 7
if 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
is 7
killed 7
the 7
rest 7
will 7
fall 7
upon 7
us 7
and 7
speedily 7
make 7
an 7
end 7
of 7
us 7
these 7
words 7
caused 7
great 7
consternation 7
among 7
all 7
the 7
ships 7
company 7
and 7
only 7
too 7
soon 7
we 7
were 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
that 7
the 7
captain 7
spoke 7
truly 7
there 7
appeared 7
a 7
vast 7
multitude 7
of 7
hideous 7
savages 7
not 7
more 7
than 7
two 7
feet 7
high 7
and 7
covered 7
with 7
reddish 7
fur 7
throwing 7
themselves 7
into 7
the 7
waves 7
they 7
surrounded 7
our 7
vessel 7
chattering 7
meanwhile 7
in 7
a 7
language 7
we 7
could 7
not 7
understand 7
and 7
clutching 7
at 7
ropes 7
and 7
gangways 7
they 7
swarmed 7
up 7
the 7
ships 7
side 7
with 7
such 7
speed 7
and 7
agility 7
that 7
they 7
almost 7
seemed 7
to 7
fly 7
you 7
may 7
imagine 7
the 7
rage 7
and 7
terror 7
that 7
seized 7
us 7
as 7
we 7
watched 7
them 7
neither 7
daring 7
to 7
hinder 7
them 7
nor 7
able 7
to 7
speak 7
a 7
word 7
to 7
deter 7
them 7
from 7
their 7
purpose 7
whatever 7
it 7
might 7
be 7
of 7
this 7
we 7
were 7
not 7
left 7
long 7
in 7
doubt 7
hoisting 7
the 7
sails 7
and 7
cutting 7
the 7
cable 7
of 7
the 7
anchor 7
they 7
sailed 7
our 7
vessel 7
to 7
an 7
island 7
which 7
lay 7
a 7
little 7
further 7
off 7
where 7
they 7
drove 7
us 7
ashore 7
then 7
taking 7
possession 7
of 7
her 7
they 7
made 7
off 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
from 7
which 7
they 7
had 7
come 7
leaving 7
us 7
helpless 7
upon 7
a 7
shore 7
avoided 7
with 7
horror 7
by 7
all 7
mariners 7
for 7
a 7
reason 7
which 7
you 7
will 7
soon 7
learn 7
turning 7
away 7
from 7
the 7
sea 7
we 7
wandered 7
miserably 7
inland 7
finding 7
as 7
we 7
went 7
various 7
herbs 7
and 7
fruits 7
which 7
we 7
ate 7
feeling 7
that 7
we 7
might 7
as 7
well 7
live 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
possible 7
though 7
we 7
had 7
no 7
hope 7
of 7
escape 7
presently 7
we 7
saw 7
in 7
the 7
far 7
distance 7
what 7
seemed 7
to 7
us 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
splendid 7
palace 7
towards 7
which 7
we 7
turned 7
our 7
weary 7
steps 7
but 7
when 7
we 7
reached 7
it 7
we 7
saw 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
castle 7
lofty 7
and 7
strongly 7
built 7
pushing 7
back 7
the 7
heavy 7
ebony 7
doors 7
we 7
entered 7
the 7
courtyard 7
but 7
upon 7
the 7
threshold 7
of 7
the 7
great 7
hall 7
beyond 7
it 7
we 7
paused 7
frozen 7
with 7
horror 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
which 7
greeted 7
us 7
on 7
one 7
side 7
lay 7
a 7
huge 7
pile 7
of 7
boneshuman 7
bones 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
other 7
numberless 7
spits 7
for 7
roasting 7
overcome 7
with 7
despair 7
we 7
sank 7
trembling 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
lay 7
there 7
without 7
speech 7
or 7
motion 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
setting 7
when 7
a 7
loud 7
noise 7
aroused 7
us 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
hall 7
was 7
violently 7
burst 7
open 7
and 7
a 7
horrible 7
giant 7
entered 7
he 7
was 7
as 7
tall 7
as 7
a 7
palm 7
tree 7
and 7
perfectly 7
black 7
and 7
had 7
one 7
eye 7
which 7
flamed 7
like 7
a 7
burning 7
coal 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
his 7
forehead 7
his 7
teeth 7
were 7
long 7
and 7
sharp 7
and 7
grinned 7
horribly 7
while 7
his 7
lower 7
lip 7
hung 7
down 7
upon 7
his 7
chest 7
and 7
he 7
had 7
ears 7
like 7
elephants 7
ears 7
which 7
covered 7
his 7
shoulders 7
and 7
nails 7
like 7
the 7
claws 7
of 7
some 7
fierce 7
bird 7
at 7
this 7
terrible 7
sight 7
our 7
senses 7
left 7
us 7
and 7
we 7
lay 7
like 7
dead 7
men 7
when 7
at 7
last 7
we 7
came 7
to 7
ourselves 7
the 7
giant 7
sat 7
examining 7
us 7
attentively 7
with 7
his 7
fearful 7
eye 7
presently 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
looked 7
at 7
us 7
enough 7
he 7
came 7
towards 7
us 7
and 7
stretching 7
out 7
his 7
hand 7
took 7
me 7
by 7
the 7
back 7
of 7
the 7
neck 7
turning 7
me 7
this 7
way 7
and 7
that 7
but 7
feeling 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
mere 7
skin 7
and 7
bone 7
he 7
set 7
me 7
down 7
again 7
and 7
went 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
next 7
whom 7
he 7
treated 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
fashion 7
at 7
last 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
captain 7
and 7
finding 7
him 7
the 7
fattest 7
of 7
us 7
all 7
he 7
took 7
him 7
up 7
in 7
one 7
hand 7
and 7
stuck 7
him 7
upon 7
a 7
spit 7
and 7
proceeded 7
to 7
kindle 7
a 7
huge 7
fire 7
at 7
which 7
he 7
presently 7
roasted 7
him 7
after 7
the 7
giant 7
had 7
supped 7
he 7
lay 7
down 7
to 7
sleep 7
snoring 7
like 7
the 7
loudest 7
thunder 7
while 7
we 7
lay 7
shivering 7
with 7
horror 7
the 7
whole 7
night 7
through 7
and 7
when 7
day 7
broke 7
he 7
awoke 7
and 7
went 7
out 7
leaving 7
us 7
in 7
the 7
castle 7
when 7
we 7
believed 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
really 7
gone 7
we 7
started 7
up 7
bemoaning 7
our 7
horrible 7
fate 7
until 7
the 7
hall 7
echoed 7
with 7
our 7
despairing 7
cries 7
though 7
we 7
were 7
many 7
and 7
our 7
enemy 7
was 7
alone 7
it 7
did 7
not 7
occur 7
to 7
us 7
to 7
kill 7
him 7
and 7
indeed 7
we 7
should 7
have 7
found 7
that 7
a 7
hard 7
task 7
even 7
if 7
we 7
had 7
thought 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
no 7
plan 7
could 7
we 7
devise 7
to 7
deliver 7
ourselves 7
so 7
at 7
last 7
submitting 7
to 7
our 7
sad 7
fate 7
we 7
spent 7
the 7
day 7
in 7
wandering 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
the 7
island 7
eating 7
such 7
fruits 7
as 7
we 7
could 7
find 7
and 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
we 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
castle 7
having 7
sought 7
in 7
vain 7
for 7
any 7
other 7
place 7
of 7
shelter 7
at 7
sunset 7
the 7
giant 7
returned 7
supped 7
upon 7
one 7
of 7
our 7
unhappy 7
comrades 7
slept 7
and 7
snored 7
till 7
dawn 7
and 7
then 7
left 7
us 7
as 7
before 7
our 7
condition 7
seemed 7
to 7
us 7
so 7
frightful 7
that 7
several 7
of 7
my 7
companions 7
thought 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
better 7
to 7
leap 7
from 7
the 7
cliffs 7
and 7
perish 7
in 7
the 7
waves 7
at 7
once 7
rather 7
than 7
await 7
so 7
miserable 7
an 7
end 7
but 7
i 7
had 7
a 7
plan 7
of 7
escape 7
which 7
i 7
now 7
unfolded 7
to 7
them 7
and 7
which 7
they 7
at 7
once 7
agreed 7
to 7
attempt 7
listen 7
my 7
brothers 7
i 7
added 7
you 7
know 7
that 7
plenty 7
of 7
driftwood 7
lies 7
along 7
the 7
shore 7
let 7
us 7
make 7
several 7
rafts 7
and 7
carry 7
them 7
to 7
a 7
suitable 7
place 7
if 7
our 7
plot 7
succeeds 7
we 7
can 7
wait 7
patiently 7
for 7
the 7
chance 7
of 7
some 7
passing 7
ship 7
which 7
would 7
rescue 7
us 7
from 7
this 7
fatal 7
island 7
if 7
it 7
fails 7
we 7
must 7
quickly 7
take 7
to 7
our 7
rafts 7
frail 7
as 7
they 7
are 7
we 7
have 7
more 7
chance 7
of 7
saving 7
our 7
lives 7
with 7
them 7
than 7
we 7
have 7
if 7
we 7
remain 7
here 7
all 7
agreed 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
we 7
spent 7
the 7
day 7
in 7
building 7
rafts 7
each 7
capable 7
of 7
carrying 7
three 7
persons 7
at 7
nightfall 7
we 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
castle 7
and 7
very 7
soon 7
in 7
came 7
the 7
giant 7
and 7
one 7
more 7
of 7
our 7
number 7
was 7
sacrificed 7
but 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
our 7
vengeance 7
was 7
at 7
hand 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
his 7
horrible 7
repast 7
he 7
lay 7
down 7
to 7
sleep 7
as 7
before 7
and 7
when 7
we 7
heard 7
him 7
begin 7
to 7
snore 7
i 7
and 7
nine 7
of 7
the 7
boldest 7
of 7
my 7
comrades 7
rose 7
softly 7
and 7
took 7
each 7
a 7
spit 7
which 7
we 7
made 7
redhot 7
in 7
the 7
fire 7
and 7
then 7
at 7
a 7
given 7
signal 7
we 7
plunged 7
it 7
with 7
one 7
accord 7
into 7
the 7
giants 7
eye 7
completely 7
blinding 7
him 7
uttering 7
a 7
terrible 7
cry 7
he 7
sprang 7
to 7
his 7
feet 7
clutching 7
in 7
all 7
directions 7
to 7
try 7
to 7
seize 7
one 7
of 7
us 7
but 7
we 7
had 7
all 7
fled 7
different 7
ways 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
deed 7
was 7
done 7
and 7
thrown 7
ourselves 7
flat 7
upon 7
the 7
ground 7
in 7
corners 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
not 7
likely 7
to 7
touch 7
us 7
with 7
his 7
feet 7
after 7
a 7
vain 7
search 7
he 7
fumbled 7
about 7
till 7
he 7
found 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
fled 7
out 7
of 7
it 7
howling 7
frightfully 7
as 7
for 7
us 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
gone 7
we 7
made 7
haste 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
fatal 7
castle 7
and 7
stationing 7
ourselves 7
beside 7
our 7
rafts 7
we 7
waited 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
would 7
happen 7
our 7
idea 7
was 7
that 7
if 7
when 7
the 7
sun 7
rose 7
we 7
saw 7
nothing 7
of 7
the 7
giant 7
and 7
no 7
longer 7
heard 7
his 7
howls 7
which 7
still 7
came 7
faintly 7
through 7
the 7
darkness 7
growing 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
distant 7
we 7
should 7
conclude 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
dead 7
and 7
that 7
we 7
might 7
safely 7
stay 7
upon 7
the 7
island 7
and 7
need 7
not 7
risk 7
our 7
lives 7
upon 7
the 7
frail 7
rafts 7
but 7
alas 7
morning 7
light 7
showed 7
us 7
our 7
enemy 7
approaching 7
us 7
supported 7
on 7
either 7
hand 7
by 7
two 7
giants 7
nearly 7
as 7
large 7
and 7
fearful 7
as 7
himself 7
while 7
a 7
crowd 7
of 7
others 7
followed 7
close 7
upon 7
their 7
heels 7
hesitating 7
no 7
longer 7
we 7
clambered 7
upon 7
our 7
rafts 7
and 7
rowed 7
with 7
all 7
our 7
might 7
out 7
to 7
sea 7
the 7
giants 7
seeing 7
their 7
prey 7
escaping 7
them 7
seized 7
up 7
huge 7
pieces 7
of 7
rock 7
and 7
wading 7
into 7
the 7
water 7
hurled 7
them 7
after 7
us 7
with 7
such 7
good 7
aim 7
that 7
all 7
the 7
rafts 7
except 7
the 7
one 7
i 7
was 7
upon 7
were 7
swamped 7
and 7
their 7
luckless 7
crews 7
drowned 7
without 7
our 7
being 7
able 7
to 7
do 7
anything 7
to 7
help 7
them 7
indeed 7
i 7
and 7
my 7
two 7
companions 7
had 7
all 7
we 7
could 7
do 7
to 7
keep 7
our 7
own 7
raft 7
beyond 7
the 7
reach 7
of 7
the 7
giants 7
but 7
by 7
dint 7
of 7
hard 7
rowing 7
we 7
at 7
last 7
gained 7
the 7
open 7
sea 7
here 7
we 7
were 7
at 7
the 7
mercy 7
of 7
the 7
winds 7
and 7
waves 7
which 7
tossed 7
us 7
to 7
and 7
fro 7
all 7
that 7
day 7
and 7
night 7
but 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
we 7
found 7
ourselves 7
near 7
an 7
island 7
upon 7
which 7
we 7
gladly 7
landed 7
there 7
we 7
found 7
delicious 7
fruits 7
and 7
having 7
satisfied 7
our 7
hunger 7
we 7
presently 7
lay 7
down 7
to 7
rest 7
upon 7
the 7
shore 7
suddenly 7
we 7
were 7
aroused 7
by 7
a 7
loud 7
rustling 7
noise 7
and 7
starting 7
up 7
saw 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
caused 7
by 7
an 7
immense 7
snake 7
which 7
was 7
gliding 7
towards 7
us 7
over 7
the 7
sand 7
so 7
swiftly 7
it 7
came 7
that 7
it 7
had 7
seized 7
one 7
of 7
my 7
comrades 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
time 7
to 7
fly 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
cries 7
and 7
struggles 7
speedily 7
crushed 7
the 7
life 7
out 7
of 7
him 7
in 7
its 7
mighty 7
coils 7
and 7
proceeded 7
to 7
swallow 7
him 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
my 7
other 7
companion 7
and 7
i 7
were 7
running 7
for 7
our 7
lives 7
to 7
some 7
place 7
where 7
we 7
might 7
hope 7
to 7
be 7
safe 7
from 7
this 7
new 7
horror 7
and 7
seeing 7
a 7
tall 7
tree 7
we 7
climbed 7
up 7
into 7
it 7
having 7
first 7
provided 7
ourselves 7
with 7
a 7
store 7
of 7
fruit 7
off 7
the 7
surrounding 7
bushes 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
i 7
fell 7
asleep 7
but 7
only 7
to 7
be 7
awakened 7
once 7
more 7
by 7
the 7
terrible 7
snake 7
which 7
after 7
hissing 7
horribly 7
round 7
the 7
tree 7
at 7
last 7
reared 7
itself 7
up 7
against 7
it 7
and 7
finding 7
my 7
sleeping 7
comrade 7
who 7
was 7
perched 7
just 7
below 7
me 7
it 7
swallowed 7
him 7
also 7
and 7
crawled 7
away 7
leaving 7
me 7
half 7
dead 7
with 7
terror 7
when 7
the 7
sun 7
rose 7
i 7
crept 7
down 7
from 7
the 7
tree 7
with 7
hardly 7
a 7
hope 7
of 7
escaping 7
the 7
dreadful 7
fate 7
which 7
had 7
overtaken 7
my 7
comrades 7
but 7
life 7
is 7
sweet 7
and 7
i 7
determined 7
to 7
do 7
all 7
i 7
could 7
to 7
save 7
myself 7
all 7
day 7
long 7
i 7
toiled 7
with 7
frantic 7
haste 7
and 7
collected 7
quantities 7
of 7
dry 7
brushwood 7
reeds 7
and 7
thorns 7
which 7
i 7
bound 7
with 7
faggots 7
and 7
making 7
a 7
circle 7
of 7
them 7
under 7
my 7
tree 7
i 7
piled 7
them 7
firmly 7
one 7
upon 7
another 7
until 7
i 7
had 7
a 7
kind 7
of 7
tent 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
crouched 7
like 7
a 7
mouse 7
in 7
a 7
hole 7
when 7
she 7
sees 7
the 7
cat 7
coming 7
you 7
may 7
imagine 7
what 7
a 7
fearful 7
night 7
i 7
passed 7
for 7
the 7
snake 7
returned 7
eager 7
to 7
devour 7
me 7
and 7
glided 7
round 7
and 7
round 7
my 7
frail 7
shelter 7
seeking 7
an 7
entrance 7
every 7
moment 7
i 7
feared 7
that 7
it 7
would 7
succeed 7
in 7
pushing 7
aside 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
faggots 7
but 7
happily 7
for 7
me 7
they 7
held 7
together 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
grew 7
light 7
my 7
enemy 7
retired 7
baffled 7
and 7
hungry 7
to 7
his 7
den 7
as 7
for 7
me 7
i 7
was 7
more 7
dead 7
than 7
alive 7
shaking 7
with 7
fright 7
and 7
half 7
suffocated 7
by 7
the 7
poisonous 7
breath 7
of 7
the 7
monster 7
i 7
came 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
tent 7
and 7
crawled 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
sea 7
feeling 7
that 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
better 7
to 7
plunge 7
from 7
the 7
cliffs 7
and 7
end 7
my 7
life 7
at 7
once 7
than 7
pass 7
such 7
another 7
night 7
of 7
horror 7
but 7
to 7
my 7
joy 7
and 7
relief 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
ship 7
sailing 7
by 7
and 7
by 7
shouting 7
wildly 7
and 7
waving 7
my 7
turban 7
i 7
managed 7
to 7
attract 7
the 7
attention 7
of 7
her 7
crew 7
a 7
boat 7
was 7
sent 7
to 7
rescue 7
me 7
and 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
on 7
board 7
surrounded 7
by 7
a 7
wondering 7
crowd 7
of 7
sailors 7
and 7
merchants 7
eager 7
to 7
know 7
by 7
what 7
chance 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
that 7
desolate 7
island 7
after 7
i 7
had 7
told 7
my 7
story 7
they 7
regaled 7
me 7
with 7
the 7
choicest 7
food 7
the 7
ship 7
afforded 7
and 7
the 7
captain 7
seeing 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
rags 7
generously 7
bestowed 7
upon 7
me 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
coats 7
after 7
sailing 7
about 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
and 7
touching 7
at 7
many 7
ports 7
we 7
came 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
the 7
island 7
of 7
salahat 7
where 7
sandal 7
wood 7
grows 7
in 7
great 7
abundance 7
here 7
we 7
anchored 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
stood 7
watching 7
the 7
merchants 7
disembarking 7
their 7
goods 7
and 7
preparing 7
to 7
sell 7
or 7
exchange 7
them 7
the 7
captain 7
came 7
up 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
said 7
i 7
have 7
here 7
brother 7
some 7
merchandise 7
belonging 7
to 7
a 7
passenger 7
of 7
mine 7
who 7
is 7
dead 7
will 7
you 7
do 7
me 7
the 7
favour 7
to 7
trade 7
with 7
it 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
meet 7
with 7
his 7
heirs 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
give 7
them 7
the 7
money 7
though 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
only 7
just 7
that 7
you 7
shall 7
have 7
a 7
portion 7
for 7
your 7
trouble 7
i 7
consented 7
gladly 7
for 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
like 7
standing 7
by 7
idle 7
whereupon 7
he 7
pointed 7
the 7
bales 7
out 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
person 7
whose 7
duty 7
it 7
was 7
to 7
keep 7
a 7
list 7
of 7
the 7
goods 7
that 7
were 7
upon 7
the 7
ship 7
when 7
this 7
man 7
came 7
he 7
asked 7
in 7
what 7
name 7
the 7
merchandise 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
registered 7
in 7
the 7
name 7
of 7
sindbad 7
the 7
sailor 7
replied 7
the 7
captain 7
at 7
this 7
i 7
was 7
greatly 7
surprised 7
but 7
looking 7
carefully 7
at 7
him 7
i 7
recognised 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
captain 7
of 7
the 7
ship 7
upon 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
made 7
my 7
second 7
voyage 7
though 7
he 7
had 7
altered 7
much 7
since 7
that 7
time 7
as 7
for 7
him 7
believing 7
me 7
to 7
be 7
dead 7
it 7
was 7
no 7
wonder 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
recognised 7
me 7
so 7
captain 7
said 7
i 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
owned 7
those 7
bales 7
was 7
called 7
sindbad 7
yes 7
he 7
replied 7
he 7
was 7
so 7
named 7
he 7
belonged 7
to 7
bagdad 7
and 7
joined 7
my 7
ship 7
at 7
balsora 7
but 7
by 7
mischance 7
he 7
was 7
left 7
behind 7
upon 7
a 7
desert 7
island 7
where 7
we 7
had 7
landed 7
to 7
fill 7
up 7
our 7
watercasks 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
until 7
four 7
hours 7
later 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
missed 7
by 7
that 7
time 7
the 7
wind 7
had 7
freshened 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
impossible 7
to 7
put 7
back 7
for 7
him 7
you 7
suppose 7
him 7
to 7
have 7
perished 7
then 7
said 7
i 7
alas 7
yes 7
he 7
answered 7
why 7
captain 7
i 7
cried 7
look 7
well 7
at 7
me 7
i 7
am 7
that 7
sindbad 7
who 7
fell 7
asleep 7
upon 7
the 7
island 7
and 7
awoke 7
to 7
find 7
himself 7
abandoned 7
the 7
captain 7
stared 7
at 7
me 7
in 7
amazement 7
but 7
was 7
presently 7
convinced 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
indeed 7
speaking 7
the 7
truth 7
and 7
rejoiced 7
greatly 7
at 7
my 7
escape 7
i 7
am 7
glad 7
to 7
have 7
that 7
piece 7
of 7
carelessness 7
off 7
my 7
conscience 7
at 7
any 7
rate 7
said 7
he 7
now 7
take 7
your 7
goods 7
and 7
the 7
profit 7
i 7
have 7
made 7
for 7
you 7
upon 7
them 7
and 7
may 7
you 7
prosper 7
in 7
future 7
i 7
took 7
them 7
gratefully 7
and 7
as 7
we 7
went 7
from 7
one 7
island 7
to 7
another 7
i 7
laid 7
in 7
stores 7
of 7
cloves 7
cinnamon 7
and 7
other 7
spices 7
in 7
one 7
place 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
tortoise 7
which 7
was 7
twenty 7
cubits 7
long 7
and 7
as 7
many 7
broad 7
also 7
a 7
fish 7
that 7
was 7
like 7
a 7
cow 7
and 7
had 7
skin 7
so 7
thick 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
used 7
to 7
make 7
shields 7
another 7
i 7
saw 7
that 7
was 7
like 7
a 7
camel 7
in 7
shape 7
and 7
colour 7
so 7
by 7
degrees 7
we 7
came 7
back 7
to 7
balsora 7
and 7
i 7
returned 7
to 7
bagdad 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
money 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
myself 7
count 7
it 7
besides 7
treasures 7
without 7
end 7
i 7
gave 7
largely 7
to 7
the 7
poor 7
and 7
bought 7
much 7
land 7
to 7
add 7
to 7
what 7
i 7
already 7
possessed 7
and 7
thus 7
ended 7
my 7
third 7
voyage 7
when 7
sindbad 7
had 7
finished 7
his 7
story 7
he 7
gave 7
another 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
to 7
hindbad 7
who 7
then 7
departed 7
with 7
the 7
other 7
guests 7
but 7
next 7
day 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
all 7
reassembled 7
and 7
the 7
banquet 7
was 7
ended 7
their 7
host 7
continued 7
his 7
adventures 7
fourth 7
voyage 7
rich 7
and 7
happy 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
after 7
my 7
third 7
voyage 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
make 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
to 7
stay 7
at 7
home 7
altogether 7
my 7
love 7
of 7
trading 7
and 7
the 7
pleasure 7
i 7
took 7
in 7
anything 7
that 7
was 7
new 7
and 7
strange 7
made 7
me 7
set 7
my 7
affairs 7
in 7
order 7
and 7
begin 7
my 7
journey 7
through 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
persian 7
provinces 7
having 7
first 7
sent 7
off 7
stores 7
of 7
goods 7
to 7
await 7
my 7
coming 7
in 7
the 7
different 7
places 7
i 7
intended 7
to 7
visit 7
i 7
took 7
ship 7
at 7
a 7
distant 7
seaport 7
and 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
all 7
went 7
well 7
but 7
at 7
last 7
being 7
caught 7
in 7
a 7
violent 7
hurricane 7
our 7
vessel 7
became 7
a 7
total 7
wreck 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
our 7
worthy 7
captain 7
could 7
do 7
to 7
save 7
her 7
and 7
many 7
of 7
our 7
company 7
perished 7
in 7
the 7
waves 7
i 7
with 7
a 7
few 7
others 7
had 7
the 7
good 7
fortune 7
to 7
be 7
washed 7
ashore 7
clinging 7
to 7
pieces 7
of 7
the 7
wreck 7
for 7
the 7
storm 7
had 7
driven 7
us 7
near 7
an 7
island 7
and 7
scrambling 7
up 7
beyond 7
the 7
reach 7
of 7
the 7
waves 7
we 7
threw 7
ourselves 7
down 7
quite 7
exhausted 7
to 7
wait 7
for 7
morning 7
at 7
daylight 7
we 7
wandered 7
inland 7
and 7
soon 7
saw 7
some 7
huts 7
to 7
which 7
we 7
directed 7
our 7
steps 7
as 7
we 7
drew 7
near 7
their 7
black 7
inhabitants 7
swarmed 7
out 7
in 7
great 7
numbers 7
and 7
surrounded 7
us 7
and 7
we 7
were 7
led 7
to 7
their 7
houses 7
and 7
as 7
it 7
were 7
divided 7
among 7
our 7
captors 7
i 7
with 7
five 7
others 7
was 7
taken 7
into 7
a 7
hut 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
made 7
to 7
sit 7
upon 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
certain 7
herbs 7
were 7
given 7
to 7
us 7
which 7
the 7
blacks 7
made 7
signs 7
to 7
us 7
to 7
eat 7
observing 7
that 7
they 7
themselves 7
did 7
not 7
touch 7
them 7
i 7
was 7
careful 7
only 7
to 7
pretend 7
to 7
taste 7
my 7
portion 7
but 7
my 7
companions 7
being 7
very 7
hungry 7
rashly 7
ate 7
up 7
all 7
that 7
was 7
set 7
before 7
them 7
and 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
had 7
the 7
horror 7
of 7
seeing 7
them 7
become 7
perfectly 7
mad 7
though 7
they 7
chattered 7
incessantly 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
understand 7
a 7
word 7
they 7
said 7
nor 7
did 7
they 7
heed 7
when 7
i 7
spoke 7
to 7
them 7
the 7
savages 7
now 7
produced 7
large 7
bowls 7
full 7
of 7
rice 7
prepared 7
with 7
cocoanut 7
oil 7
of 7
which 7
my 7
crazy 7
comrades 7
ate 7
eagerly 7
but 7
i 7
only 7
tasted 7
a 7
few 7
grains 7
understanding 7
clearly 7
that 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
our 7
captors 7
was 7
to 7
fatten 7
us 7
speedily 7
for 7
their 7
own 7
eating 7
and 7
this 7
was 7
exactly 7
what 7
happened 7
my 7
unlucky 7
companions 7
having 7
lost 7
their 7
reason 7
felt 7
neither 7
anxiety 7
nor 7
fear 7
and 7
ate 7
greedily 7
all 7
that 7
was 7
offered 7
them 7
so 7
they 7
were 7
soon 7
fat 7
and 7
there 7
was 7
an 7
end 7
of 7
them 7
but 7
i 7
grew 7
leaner 7
day 7
by 7
day 7
for 7
i 7
ate 7
but 7
little 7
and 7
even 7
that 7
little 7
did 7
me 7
no 7
good 7
by 7
reason 7
of 7
my 7
fear 7
of 7
what 7
lay 7
before 7
me 7
however 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
far 7
from 7
being 7
a 7
tempting 7
morsel 7
i 7
was 7
allowed 7
to 7
wander 7
about 7
freely 7
and 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
all 7
the 7
blacks 7
had 7
gone 7
off 7
upon 7
some 7
expedition 7
leaving 7
only 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
to 7
guard 7
me 7
i 7
managed 7
to 7
escape 7
from 7
him 7
and 7
plunged 7
into 7
the 7
forest 7
running 7
faster 7
the 7
more 7
he 7
cried 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
until 7
i 7
had 7
completely 7
distanced 7
him 7
for 7
seven 7
days 7
i 7
hurried 7
on 7
resting 7
only 7
when 7
the 7
darkness 7
stopped 7
me 7
and 7
living 7
chiefly 7
upon 7
cocoanuts 7
which 7
afforded 7
me 7
both 7
meat 7
and 7
drink 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
eighth 7
day 7
i 7
reached 7
the 7
seashore 7
and 7
saw 7
a 7
party 7
of 7
white 7
men 7
gathering 7
pepper 7
which 7
grew 7
abundantly 7
all 7
about 7
reassured 7
by 7
the 7
nature 7
of 7
their 7
occupation 7
i 7
advanced 7
towards 7
them 7
and 7
they 7
greeted 7
me 7
in 7
arabic 7
asking 7
who 7
i 7
was 7
and 7
whence 7
i 7
came 7
my 7
delight 7
was 7
great 7
on 7
hearing 7
this 7
familiar 7
speech 7
and 7
i 7
willingly 7
satisfied 7
their 7
curiosity 7
telling 7
them 7
how 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
shipwrecked 7
and 7
captured 7
by 7
the 7
blacks 7
but 7
these 7
savages 7
devour 7
men 7
said 7
they 7
how 7
did 7
you 7
escape 7
i 7
repeated 7
to 7
them 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
told 7
you 7
at 7
which 7
they 7
were 7
mightily 7
astonished 7
i 7
stayed 7
with 7
them 7
until 7
they 7
had 7
collected 7
as 7
much 7
pepper 7
as 7
they 7
wished 7
and 7
then 7
they 7
took 7
me 7
back 7
to 7
their 7
own 7
country 7
and 7
presented 7
me 7
to 7
their 7
king 7
by 7
whom 7
i 7
was 7
hospitably 7
received 7
to 7
him 7
also 7
i 7
had 7
to 7
relate 7
my 7
adventures 7
which 7
surprised 7
him 7
much 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
he 7
ordered 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
supplied 7
with 7
food 7
and 7
raiment 7
and 7
treated 7
with 7
consideration 7
the 7
island 7
on 7
which 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
was 7
full 7
of 7
people 7
and 7
abounded 7
in 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
desirable 7
things 7
and 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
traffic 7
went 7
on 7
in 7
the 7
capital 7
where 7
i 7
soon 7
began 7
to 7
feel 7
at 7
home 7
and 7
contented 7
moreover 7
the 7
king 7
treated 7
me 7
with 7
special 7
favour 7
and 7
in 7
consequence 7
of 7
this 7
everyone 7
whether 7
at 7
the 7
court 7
or 7
in 7
the 7
town 7
sought 7
to 7
make 7
life 7
pleasant 7
to 7
me 7
one 7
thing 7
i 7
remarked 7
which 7
i 7
thought 7
very 7
strange 7
this 7
was 7
that 7
from 7
the 7
greatest 7
to 7
the 7
least 7
all 7
men 7
rode 7
their 7
horses 7
without 7
bridle 7
or 7
stirrups 7
i 7
one 7
day 7
presumed 7
to 7
ask 7
his 7
majesty 7
why 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
use 7
them 7
to 7
which 7
he 7
replied 7
you 7
speak 7
to 7
me 7
of 7
things 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
before 7
heard 7
this 7
gave 7
me 7
an 7
idea 7
i 7
found 7
a 7
clever 7
workman 7
and 7
made 7
him 7
cut 7
out 7
under 7
my 7
direction 7
the 7
foundation 7
of 7
a 7
saddle 7
which 7
i 7
wadded 7
and 7
covered 7
with 7
choice 7
leather 7
adorning 7
it 7
with 7
rich 7
gold 7
embroidery 7
i 7
then 7
got 7
a 7
locksmith 7
to 7
make 7
me 7
a 7
bit 7
and 7
a 7
pair 7
of 7
spurs 7
after 7
a 7
pattern 7
that 7
i 7
drew 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
when 7
all 7
these 7
things 7
were 7
completed 7
i 7
presented 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
showed 7
him 7
how 7
to 7
use 7
them 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
saddled 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
horses 7
he 7
mounted 7
it 7
and 7
rode 7
about 7
quite 7
delighted 7
with 7
the 7
novelty 7
and 7
to 7
show 7
his 7
gratitude 7
he 7
rewarded 7
me 7
with 7
large 7
gifts 7
after 7
this 7
i 7
had 7
to 7
make 7
saddles 7
for 7
all 7
the 7
principal 7
officers 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
household 7
and 7
as 7
they 7
all 7
gave 7
me 7
rich 7
presents 7
i 7
soon 7
became 7
very 7
wealthy 7
and 7
quite 7
an 7
important 7
person 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
one 7
day 7
the 7
king 7
sent 7
for 7
me 7
and 7
said 7
sindbad 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
to 7
ask 7
a 7
favour 7
of 7
you 7
both 7
i 7
and 7
my 7
subjects 7
esteem 7
you 7
and 7
wish 7
you 7
to 7
end 7
your 7
days 7
amongst 7
us 7
therefore 7
i 7
desire 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
marry 7
a 7
rich 7
and 7
beautiful 7
lady 7
whom 7
i 7
will 7
find 7
for 7
you 7
and 7
think 7
no 7
more 7
of 7
your 7
own 7
country 7
as 7
the 7
kings 7
will 7
was 7
law 7
i 7
accepted 7
the 7
charming 7
bride 7
he 7
presented 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
lived 7
happily 7
with 7
her 7
nevertheless 7
i 7
had 7
every 7
intention 7
of 7
escaping 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
opportunity 7
and 7
going 7
back 7
to 7
bagdad 7
things 7
were 7
thus 7
going 7
prosperously 7
with 7
me 7
when 7
it 7
happened 7
that 7
the 7
wife 7
of 7
one 7
of 7
my 7
neighbours 7
with 7
whom 7
i 7
had 7
struck 7
up 7
quite 7
a 7
friendship 7
fell 7
ill 7
and 7
presently 7
died 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
his 7
house 7
to 7
offer 7
my 7
consolations 7
and 7
found 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
depths 7
of 7
woe 7
heaven 7
preserve 7
you 7
said 7
i 7
and 7
send 7
you 7
a 7
long 7
life 7
alas 7
he 7
replied 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
good 7
of 7
saying 7
that 7
when 7
i 7
have 7
but 7
an 7
hour 7
left 7
to 7
live 7
come 7
come 7
said 7
i 7
surely 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
so 7
bad 7
as 7
all 7
that 7
i 7
trust 7
that 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
spared 7
to 7
me 7
for 7
many 7
years 7
i 7
hope 7
answered 7
he 7
that 7
your 7
life 7
may 7
be 7
long 7
but 7
as 7
for 7
me 7
all 7
is 7
finished 7
i 7
have 7
set 7
my 7
house 7
in 7
order 7
and 7
today 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
buried 7
with 7
my 7
wife 7
this 7

been 7

upon 7
our 7
island 7

it 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
the 7
friends 7
and 7
relations 7
of 7
the 7
unhappy 7
pair 7
began 7
to 7
assemble 7
the 7
body 7
decked 7
in 7
rich 7
robes 7
and 7
sparkling 7
with 7
jewels 7
was 7
laid 7
upon 7
an 7
open 7
bier 7
and 7
the 7
procession 7
started 7
taking 7
its 7
way 7
to 7
a 7
high 7
mountain 7
at 7
some 7
distance 7
from 7
the 7
city 7
the 7
wretched 7
husband 7
clothed 7
from 7
head 7
to 7
foot 7
in 7
a 7
black 7
mantle 7
following 7
mournfully 7
when 7
the 7
place 7
of 7
interment 7
was 7
reached 7
the 7
corpse 7
was 7
lowered 7
just 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
into 7
a 7
deep 7
pit 7
then 7
the 7
husband 7
bidding 7
farewell 7
to 7
all 7
his 7
friends 7
stretched 7
himself 7
upon 7
another 7
bier 7
upon 7
which 7
were 7
laid 7
seven 7
little 7
loaves 7
of 7
bread 7
and 7
a 7
pitcher 7
of 7
water 7
and 7
he 7
also 7
was 7
let 7
downdowndown 7
to 7
the 7
depths 7
of 7
the 7
horrible 7
cavern 7
and 7
then 7
a 7
stone 7
was 7
laid 7
over 7
the 7
opening 7
and 7
the 7
melancholy 7
company 7
wended 7
its 7
way 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
city 7
you 7
may 7
imagine 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
no 7
unmoved 7
spectator 7
of 7
these 7
proceedings 7
to 7
all 7
the 7
others 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
thing 7
to 7
which 7
they 7
had 7
been 7
accustomed 7
from 7
their 7
youth 7
up 7
but 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
horrified 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
help 7
telling 7
the 7
king 7
how 7
it 7
struck 7
me 7
sire 7
i 7
said 7
i 7
am 7
more 7
astonished 7
than 7
i 7
can 7
express 7
to 7
you 7
at 7
the 7
strange 7
custom 7
which 7
exists 7
in 7
your 7
dominions 7
of 7
burying 7
the 7
living 7
with 7
the 7
dead 7
in 7
all 7
my 7
travels 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
before 7
met 7
with 7
so 7
cruel 7
and 7
horrible 7
a 7
law 7
what 7
would 7
you 7
have 7
sindbad 7
he 7
replied 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
law 7
for 7
everybody 7
i 7
myself 7
should 7
be 7
buried 7
with 7
the 7
queen 7
if 7
she 7
were 7
the 7
first 7
to 7
die 7
but 7
your 7
majesty 7
said 7
i 7
dare 7
i 7
ask 7
if 7
this 7
law 7
applies 7
to 7
foreigners 7
also 7
why 7
yes 7
replied 7
the 7
king 7
smiling 7
in 7
what 7
i 7
could 7
but 7
consider 7
a 7
very 7
heartless 7
manner 7
they 7
are 7
no 7
exception 7
to 7
the 7
rule 7
if 7
they 7
have 7
married 7
in 7
the 7
country 7
when 7
i 7
heard 7
this 7
i 7
went 7
home 7
much 7
cast 7
down 7
and 7
from 7
that 7
time 7
forward 7
my 7
mind 7
was 7
never 7
easy 7
if 7
only 7
my 7
wifes 7
little 7
finger 7
ached 7
i 7
fancied 7
she 7
was 7
going 7
to 7
die 7
and 7
sure 7
enough 7
before 7
very 7
long 7
she 7
fell 7
really 7
ill 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
breathed 7
her 7
last 7
my 7
dismay 7
was 7
great 7
for 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
to 7
be 7
buried 7
alive 7
was 7
even 7
a 7
worse 7
fate 7
than 7
to 7
be 7
devoured 7
by 7
cannibals 7
nevertheless 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
escape 7
the 7
body 7
of 7
my 7
wife 7
arrayed 7
in 7
her 7
richest 7
robes 7
and 7
decked 7
with 7
all 7
her 7
jewels 7
was 7
laid 7
upon 7
the 7
bier 7
i 7
followed 7
it 7
and 7
after 7
me 7
came 7
a 7
great 7
procession 7
headed 7
by 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
all 7
his 7
nobles 7
and 7
in 7
this 7
order 7
we 7
reached 7
the 7
fatal 7
mountain 7
which 7
was 7
one 7
of 7
a 7
lofty 7
chain 7
bordering 7
the 7
sea 7
here 7
i 7
made 7
one 7
more 7
frantic 7
effort 7
to 7
excite 7
the 7
pity 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
those 7
who 7
stood 7
by 7
hoping 7
to 7
save 7
myself 7
even 7
at 7
this 7
last 7
moment 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
no 7
avail 7
no 7
one 7
spoke 7
to 7
me 7
they 7
even 7
appeared 7
to 7
hasten 7
over 7
their 7
dreadful 7
task 7
and 7
i 7
speedily 7
found 7
myself 7
descending 7
into 7
the 7
gloomy 7
pit 7
with 7
my 7
seven 7
loaves 7
and 7
pitcher 7
of 7
water 7
beside 7
me 7
almost 7
before 7
i 7
reached 7
the 7
bottom 7
the 7
stone 7
was 7
rolled 7
into 7
its 7
place 7
above 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
left 7
to 7
my 7
fate 7
a 7
feeble 7
ray 7
of 7
light 7
shone 7
into 7
the 7
cavern 7
through 7
some 7
chink 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
the 7
courage 7
to 7
look 7
about 7
me 7
i 7
could 7
see 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
a 7
vast 7
vault 7
bestrewn 7
with 7
bones 7
and 7
bodies 7
of 7
the 7
dead 7
i 7
even 7
fancied 7
that 7
i 7
heard 7
the 7
expiring 7
sighs 7
of 7
those 7
who 7
like 7
myself 7
had 7
come 7
into 7
this 7
dismal 7
place 7
alive 7
all 7
in 7
vain 7
did 7
i 7
shriek 7
aloud 7
with 7
rage 7
and 7
despair 7
reproaching 7
myself 7
for 7
the 7
love 7
of 7
gain 7
and 7
adventure 7
which 7
had 7
brought 7
me 7
to 7
such 7
a 7
pass 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
growing 7
calmer 7
i 7
took 7
up 7
my 7
bread 7
and 7
water 7
and 7
wrapping 7
my 7
face 7
in 7
my 7
mantle 7
i 7
groped 7
my 7
way 7
towards 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
cavern 7
where 7
the 7
air 7
was 7
fresher 7
here 7
i 7
lived 7
in 7
darkness 7
and 7
misery 7
until 7
my 7
provisions 7
were 7
exhausted 7
but 7
just 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
nearly 7
dead 7
from 7
starvation 7
the 7
rock 7
was 7
rolled 7
away 7
overhead 7
and 7
i 7
saw 7
that 7
a 7
bier 7
was 7
being 7
lowered 7
into 7
the 7
cavern 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
corpse 7
upon 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
man 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
my 7
mind 7
was 7
made 7
up 7
the 7
woman 7
who 7
followed 7
had 7
nothing 7
to 7
expect 7
but 7
a 7
lingering 7
death 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
doing 7
her 7
a 7
service 7
if 7
i 7
shortened 7
her 7
misery 7
therefore 7
when 7
she 7
descended 7
already 7
insensible 7
from 7
terror 7
i 7
was 7
ready 7
armed 7
with 7
a 7
huge 7
bone 7
one 7
blow 7
from 7
which 7
left 7
her 7
dead 7
and 7
i 7
secured 7
the 7
bread 7
and 7
water 7
which 7
gave 7
me 7
a 7
hope 7
of 7
life 7
several 7
times 7
did 7
i 7
have 7
recourse 7
to 7
this 7
desperate 7
expedient 7
and 7
i 7
know 7
not 7
how 7
long 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
a 7
prisoner 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
i 7
fancied 7
that 7
i 7
heard 7
something 7
near 7
me 7
which 7
breathed 7
loudly 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
from 7
which 7
the 7
sound 7
came 7
i 7
dimly 7
saw 7
a 7
shadowy 7
form 7
which 7
fled 7
at 7
my 7
movement 7
squeezing 7
itself 7
through 7
a 7
cranny 7
in 7
the 7
wall 7
i 7
pursued 7
it 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
and 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
a 7
narrow 7
crack 7
among 7
the 7
rocks 7
along 7
which 7
i 7
was 7
just 7
able 7
to 7
force 7
my 7
way 7
i 7
followed 7
it 7
for 7
what 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
many 7
miles 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
saw 7
before 7
me 7
a 7
glimmer 7
of 7
light 7
which 7
grew 7
clearer 7
every 7
moment 7
until 7
i 7
emerged 7
upon 7
the 7
sea 7
shore 7
with 7
a 7
joy 7
which 7
i 7
cannot 7
describe 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
sure 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
not 7
dreaming 7
i 7
realised 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
doubtless 7
some 7
little 7
animal 7
which 7
had 7
found 7
its 7
way 7
into 7
the 7
cavern 7
from 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
when 7
disturbed 7
had 7
fled 7
showing 7
me 7
a 7
means 7
of 7
escape 7
which 7
i 7
could 7
never 7
have 7
discovered 7
for 7
myself 7
i 7
hastily 7
surveyed 7
my 7
surroundings 7
and 7
saw 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
safe 7
from 7
all 7
pursuit 7
from 7
the 7
town 7
the 7
mountains 7
sloped 7
sheer 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
road 7
across 7
them 7
being 7
assured 7
of 7
this 7
i 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
cavern 7
and 7
amassed 7
a 7
rich 7
treasure 7
of 7
diamonds 7
rubies 7
emeralds 7
and 7
jewels 7
of 7
all 7
kinds 7
which 7
strewed 7
the 7
ground 7
these 7
i 7
made 7
up 7
into 7
bales 7
and 7
stored 7
them 7
into 7
a 7
safe 7
place 7
upon 7
the 7
beach 7
and 7
then 7
waited 7
hopefully 7
for 7
the 7
passing 7
of 7
a 7
ship 7
i 7
had 7
looked 7
out 7
for 7
two 7
days 7
however 7
before 7
a 7
single 7
sail 7
appeared 7
so 7
it 7
was 7
with 7
much 7
delight 7
that 7
i 7
at 7
last 7
saw 7
a 7
vessel 7
not 7
very 7
far 7
from 7
the 7
shore 7
and 7
by 7
waving 7
my 7
arms 7
and 7
uttering 7
loud 7
cries 7
succeeded 7
in 7
attracting 7
the 7
attention 7
of 7
her 7
crew 7
a 7
boat 7
was 7
sent 7
off 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
in 7
answer 7
to 7
the 7
questions 7
of 7
the 7
sailors 7
as 7
to 7
how 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
plight 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
shipwrecked 7
two 7
days 7
before 7
but 7
had 7
managed 7
to 7
scramble 7
ashore 7
with 7
the 7
bales 7
which 7
i 7
pointed 7
out 7
to 7
them 7
luckily 7
for 7
me 7
they 7
believed 7
my 7
story 7
and 7
without 7
even 7
looking 7
at 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
they 7
found 7
me 7
took 7
up 7
my 7
bundles 7
and 7
rowed 7
me 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
ship 7
once 7
on 7
board 7
i 7
soon 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
captain 7
was 7
too 7
much 7
occupied 7
with 7
the 7
difficulties 7
of 7
navigation 7
to 7
pay 7
much 7
heed 7
to 7
me 7
though 7
he 7
generously 7
made 7
me 7
welcome 7
and 7
would 7
not 7
even 7
accept 7
the 7
jewels 7
with 7
which 7
i 7
offered 7
to 7
pay 7
my 7
passage 7
our 7
voyage 7
was 7
prosperous 7
and 7
after 7
visiting 7
many 7
lands 7
and 7
collecting 7
in 7
each 7
place 7
great 7
store 7
of 7
goodly 7
merchandise 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
at 7
last 7
in 7
bagdad 7
once 7
more 7
with 7
unheard 7
of 7
riches 7
of 7
every 7
description 7
again 7
i 7
gave 7
large 7
sums 7
of 7
money 7
to 7
the 7
poor 7
and 7
enriched 7
all 7
the 7
mosques 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
after 7
which 7
i 7
gave 7
myself 7
up 7
to 7
my 7
friends 7
and 7
relations 7
with 7
whom 7
i 7
passed 7
my 7
time 7
in 7
feasting 7
and 7
merriment 7
here 7
sindbad 7
paused 7
and 7
all 7
his 7
hearers 7
declared 7
that 7
the 7
adventures 7
of 7
his 7
fourth 7
voyage 7
had 7
pleased 7
them 7
better 7
than 7
anything 7
they 7
had 7
heard 7
before 7
they 7
then 7
took 7
their 7
leave 7
followed 7
by 7
hindbad 7
who 7
had 7
once 7
more 7
received 7
a 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
rest 7
had 7
been 7
bidden 7
to 7
return 7
next 7
day 7
for 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
fifth 7
voyage 7
when 7
the 7
time 7
came 7
all 7
were 7
in 7
their 7
places 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
eaten 7
and 7
drunk 7
of 7
all 7
that 7
was 7
set 7
before 7
them 7
sindbad 7
began 7
his 7
tale 7
fifth 7
voyage 7
not 7
even 7
all 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
gone 7
through 7
could 7
make 7
me 7
contented 7
with 7
a 7
quiet 7
life 7
i 7
soon 7
wearied 7
of 7
its 7
pleasures 7
and 7
longed 7
for 7
change 7
and 7
adventure 7
therefore 7
i 7
set 7
out 7
once 7
more 7
but 7
this 7
time 7
in 7
a 7
ship 7
of 7
my 7
own 7
which 7
i 7
built 7
and 7
fitted 7
out 7
at 7
the 7
nearest 7
seaport 7
i 7
wished 7
to 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
call 7
at 7
whatever 7
port 7
i 7
chose 7
taking 7
my 7
own 7
time 7
but 7
as 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
intend 7
carrying 7
enough 7
goods 7
for 7
a 7
full 7
cargo 7
i 7
invited 7
several 7
merchants 7
of 7
different 7
nations 7
to 7
join 7
me 7
we 7
set 7
sail 7
with 7
the 7
first 7
favourable 7
wind 7
and 7
after 7
a 7
long 7
voyage 7
upon 7
the 7
open 7
seas 7
we 7
landed 7
upon 7
an 7
unknown 7
island 7
which 7
proved 7
to 7
be 7
uninhabited 7
we 7
determined 7
however 7
to 7
explore 7
it 7
but 7
had 7
not 7
gone 7
far 7
when 7
we 7
found 7
a 7
rocs 7
egg 7
as 7
large 7
as 7
the 7
one 7
i 7
had 7
seen 7
before 7
and 7
evidently 7
very 7
nearly 7
hatched 7
for 7
the 7
beak 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
bird 7
had 7
already 7
pierced 7
the 7
shell 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
i 7
could 7
say 7
to 7
deter 7
them 7
the 7
merchants 7
who 7
were 7
with 7
me 7
fell 7
upon 7
it 7
with 7
their 7
hatchets 7
breaking 7
the 7
shell 7
and 7
killing 7
the 7
young 7
roc 7
then 7
lighting 7
a 7
fire 7
upon 7
the 7
ground 7
they 7
hacked 7
morsels 7
from 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
proceeded 7
to 7
roast 7
them 7
while 7
i 7
stood 7
by 7
aghast 7
scarcely 7
had 7
they 7
finished 7
their 7
illomened 7
repast 7
when 7
the 7
air 7
above 7
us 7
was 7
darkened 7
by 7
two 7
mighty 7
shadows 7
the 7
captain 7
of 7
my 7
ship 7
knowing 7
by 7
experience 7
what 7
this 7
meant 7
cried 7
out 7
to 7
us 7
that 7
the 7
parent 7
birds 7
were 7
coming 7
and 7
urged 7
us 7
to 7
get 7
on 7
board 7
with 7
all 7
speed 7
this 7
we 7
did 7
and 7
the 7
sails 7
were 7
hoisted 7
but 7
before 7
we 7
had 7
made 7
any 7
way 7
the 7
rocs 7
reached 7
their 7
despoiled 7
nest 7
and 7
hovered 7
about 7
it 7
uttering 7
frightful 7
cries 7
when 7
they 7
discovered 7
the 7
mangled 7
remains 7
of 7
their 7
young 7
one 7
for 7
a 7
moment 7
we 7
lost 7
sight 7
of 7
them 7
and 7
were 7
flattering 7
ourselves 7
that 7
we 7
had 7
escaped 7
when 7
they 7
reappeared 7
and 7
soared 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
directly 7
over 7
our 7
vessel 7
and 7
we 7
saw 7
that 7
each 7
held 7
in 7
its 7
claws 7
an 7
immense 7
rock 7
ready 7
to 7
crush 7
us 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
moment 7
of 7
breathless 7
suspense 7
then 7
one 7
bird 7
loosed 7
its 7
hold 7
and 7
the 7
huge 7
block 7
of 7
stone 7
hurtled 7
through 7
the 7
air 7
but 7
thanks 7
to 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
mind 7
of 7
the 7
helmsman 7
who 7
turned 7
our 7
ship 7
violently 7
in 7
another 7
direction 7
it 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
close 7
beside 7
us 7
cleaving 7
it 7
asunder 7
till 7
we 7
could 7
nearly 7
see 7
the 7
bottom 7
we 7
had 7
hardly 7
time 7
to 7
draw 7
a 7
breath 7
of 7
relief 7
before 7
the 7
other 7
rock 7
fell 7
with 7
a 7
mighty 7
crash 7
right 7
in 7
the 7
midst 7
of 7
our 7
luckless 7
vessel 7
smashing 7
it 7
into 7
a 7
thousand 7
fragments 7
and 7
crushing 7
or 7
hurling 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
passengers 7
and 7
crew 7
i 7
myself 7
went 7
down 7
with 7
the 7
rest 7
but 7
had 7
the 7
good 7
fortune 7
to 7
rise 7
unhurt 7
and 7
by 7
holding 7
on 7
to 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
driftwood 7
with 7
one 7
hand 7
and 7
swimming 7
with 7
the 7
other 7
i 7
kept 7
myself 7
afloat 7
and 7
was 7
presently 7
washed 7
up 7
by 7
the 7
tide 7
on 7
to 7
an 7
island 7
its 7
shores 7
were 7
steep 7
and 7
rocky 7
but 7
i 7
scrambled 7
up 7
safely 7
and 7
threw 7
myself 7
down 7
to 7
rest 7
upon 7
the 7
green 7
turf 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
somewhat 7
recovered 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
spot 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
and 7
truly 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
reached 7
a 7
garden 7
of 7
delights 7
there 7
were 7
trees 7
everywhere 7
and 7
they 7
were 7
laden 7
with 7
flowers 7
and 7
fruit 7
while 7
a 7
crystal 7
stream 7
wandered 7
in 7
and 7
out 7
under 7
their 7
shadow 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
i 7
slept 7
sweetly 7
in 7
a 7
cosy 7
nook 7
though 7
the 7
remembrance 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
alone 7
in 7
a 7
strange 7
land 7
made 7
me 7
sometimes 7
start 7
up 7
and 7
look 7
around 7
me 7
in 7
alarm 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
wished 7
heartily 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
stayed 7
at 7
home 7
at 7
ease 7
however 7
the 7
morning 7
sunlight 7
restored 7
my 7
courage 7
and 7
i 7
once 7
more 7
wandered 7
among 7
the 7
trees 7
but 7
always 7
with 7
some 7
anxiety 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
i 7
might 7
see 7
next 7
i 7
had 7
penetrated 7
some 7
distance 7
into 7
the 7
island 7
when 7
i 7
saw 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
bent 7
and 7
feeble 7
sitting 7
upon 7
the 7
river 7
bank 7
and 7
at 7
first 7
i 7
took 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
some 7
shipwrecked 7
mariner 7
like 7
myself 7
going 7
up 7
to 7
him 7
i 7
greeted 7
him 7
in 7
a 7
friendly 7
way 7
but 7
he 7
only 7
nodded 7
his 7
head 7
at 7
me 7
in 7
reply 7
i 7
then 7
asked 7
what 7
he 7
did 7
there 7
and 7
he 7
made 7
signs 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
get 7
across 7
the 7
river 7
to 7
gather 7
some 7
fruit 7
and 7
seemed 7
to 7
beg 7
me 7
to 7
carry 7
him 7
on 7
my 7
back 7
pitying 7
his 7
age 7
and 7
feebleness 7
i 7
took 7
him 7
up 7
and 7
wading 7
across 7
the 7
stream 7
i 7
bent 7
down 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
more 7
easily 7
reach 7
the 7
bank 7
and 7
bade 7
him 7
get 7
down 7
but 7
instead 7
of 7
allowing 7
himself 7
to 7
be 7
set 7
upon 7
his 7
feet 7
even 7
now 7
it 7
makes 7
me 7
laugh 7
to 7
think 7
of 7
it 7
this 7
creature 7
who 7
had 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
so 7
decrepit 7
leaped 7
nimbly 7
upon 7
my 7
shoulders 7
and 7
hooking 7
his 7
legs 7
round 7
my 7
neck 7
gripped 7
me 7
so 7
tightly 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
wellnigh 7
choked 7
and 7
so 7
overcome 7
with 7
terror 7
that 7
i 7
fell 7
insensible 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
when 7
i 7
recovered 7
my 7
enemy 7
was 7
still 7
in 7
his 7
place 7
though 7
he 7
had 7
released 7
his 7
hold 7
enough 7
to 7
allow 7
me 7
breathing 7
space 7
and 7
seeing 7
me 7
revive 7
he 7
prodded 7
me 7
adroitly 7
first 7
with 7
one 7
foot 7
and 7
then 7
with 7
the 7
other 7
until 7
i 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
get 7
up 7
and 7
stagger 7
about 7
with 7
him 7
under 7
the 7
trees 7
while 7
he 7
gathered 7
and 7
ate 7
the 7
choicest 7
fruits 7
this 7
went 7
on 7
all 7
day 7
and 7
even 7
at 7
night 7
when 7
i 7
threw 7
myself 7
down 7
half 7
dead 7
with 7
weariness 7
the 7
terrible 7
old 7
man 7
held 7
on 7
tight 7
to 7
my 7
neck 7
nor 7
did 7
he 7
fail 7
to 7
greet 7
the 7
first 7
glimmer 7
of 7
morning 7
light 7
by 7
drumming 7
upon 7
me 7
with 7
his 7
heels 7
until 7
i 7
perforce 7
awoke 7
and 7
resumed 7
my 7
dreary 7
march 7
with 7
rage 7
and 7
bitterness 7
in 7
my 7
heart 7
it 7
happened 7
one 7
day 7
that 7
i 7
passed 7
a 7
tree 7
under 7
which 7
lay 7
several 7
dry 7
gourds 7
and 7
catching 7
one 7
up 7
i 7
amused 7
myself 7
with 7
scooping 7
out 7
its 7
contents 7
and 7
pressing 7
into 7
it 7
the 7
juice 7
of 7
several 7
bunches 7
of 7
grapes 7
which 7
hung 7
from 7
every 7
bush 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
full 7
i 7
left 7
it 7
propped 7
in 7
the 7
fork 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
and 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
later 7
carrying 7
the 7
hateful 7
old 7
man 7
that 7
way 7
i 7
snatched 7
at 7
my 7
gourd 7
as 7
i 7
passed 7
it 7
and 7
had 7
the 7
satisfaction 7
of 7
a 7
draught 7
of 7
excellent 7
wine 7
so 7
good 7
and 7
refreshing 7
that 7
i 7
even 7
forgot 7
my 7
detestable 7
burden 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
sing 7
and 7
caper 7
the 7
old 7
monster 7
was 7
not 7
slow 7
to 7
perceive 7
the 7
effect 7
which 7
my 7
draught 7
had 7
produced 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
carried 7
him 7
more 7
lightly 7
than 7
usual 7
so 7
he 7
stretched 7
out 7
his 7
skinny 7
hand 7
and 7
seizing 7
the 7
gourd 7
first 7
tasted 7
its 7
contents 7
cautiously 7
then 7
drained 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
very 7
last 7
drop 7
the 7
wine 7
was 7
strong 7
and 7
the 7
gourd 7
capacious 7
so 7
he 7
also 7
began 7
to 7
sing 7
after 7
a 7
fashion 7
and 7
soon 7
i 7
had 7
the 7
delight 7
of 7
feeling 7
the 7
iron 7
grip 7
of 7
his 7
goblin 7
legs 7
unclasp 7
and 7
with 7
one 7
vigorous 7
effort 7
i 7
threw 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
from 7
which 7
he 7
never 7
moved 7
again 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
rejoiced 7
to 7
have 7
at 7
last 7
got 7
rid 7
of 7
this 7
uncanny 7
old 7
man 7
that 7
i 7
ran 7
leaping 7
and 7
bounding 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
sea 7
shore 7
where 7
by 7
the 7
greatest 7
good 7
luck 7
i 7
met 7
with 7
some 7
mariners 7
who 7
had 7
anchored 7
off 7
the 7
island 7
to 7
enjoy 7
the 7
delicious 7
fruits 7
and 7
to 7
renew 7
their 7
supply 7
of 7
water 7
they 7
heard 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
my 7
escape 7
with 7
amazement 7
saying 7
you 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
of 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
mercy 7
that 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
strangle 7
you 7
as 7
he 7
has 7
everyone 7
else 7
upon 7
whose 7
shoulders 7
he 7
has 7
managed 7
to 7
perch 7
himself 7
this 7
island 7
is 7
well 7
known 7
as 7
the 7
scene 7
of 7
his 7
evil 7
deeds 7
and 7
no 7
merchant 7
or 7
sailor 7
who 7
lands 7
upon 7
it 7
cares 7
to 7
stray 7
far 7
away 7
from 7
his 7
comrades 7
after 7
we 7
had 7
talked 7
for 7
a 7
while 7
they 7
took 7
me 7
back 7
with 7
them 7
on 7
board 7
their 7
ship 7
where 7
the 7
captain 7
received 7
me 7
kindly 7
and 7
we 7
soon 7
set 7
sail 7
and 7
after 7
several 7
days 7
reached 7
a 7
large 7
and 7
prosperouslooking 7
town 7
where 7
all 7
the 7
houses 7
were 7
built 7
of 7
stone 7
here 7
we 7
anchored 7
and 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
very 7
friendly 7
to 7
me 7
on 7
the 7
way 7
took 7
me 7
ashore 7
with 7
him 7
and 7
showed 7
me 7
a 7
lodging 7
set 7
apart 7
for 7
strange 7
merchants 7
he 7
then 7
provided 7
me 7
with 7
a 7
large 7
sack 7
and 7
pointed 7
out 7
to 7
me 7
a 7
party 7
of 7
others 7
equipped 7
in 7
like 7
manner 7
go 7
with 7
them 7
said 7
he 7
and 7
do 7
as 7
they 7
do 7
but 7
beware 7
of 7
losing 7
sight 7
of 7
them 7
for 7
if 7
you 7
strayed 7
your 7
life 7
would 7
be 7
in 7
danger 7
with 7
that 7
he 7
supplied 7
me 7
with 7
provisions 7
and 7
bade 7
me 7
farewell 7
and 7
i 7
set 7
out 7
with 7
my 7
new 7
companions 7
i 7
soon 7
learnt 7
that 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
our 7
expedition 7
was 7
to 7
fill 7
our 7
sacks 7
with 7
cocoanuts 7
but 7
when 7
at 7
length 7
i 7
saw 7
the 7
trees 7
and 7
noted 7
their 7
immense 7
height 7
and 7
the 7
slippery 7
smoothness 7
of 7
their 7
slender 7
trunks 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
at 7
all 7
understand 7
how 7
we 7
were 7
to 7
do 7
it 7
the 7
crowns 7
of 7
the 7
cocoapalms 7
were 7
all 7
alive 7
with 7
monkeys 7
big 7
and 7
little 7
which 7
skipped 7
from 7
one 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
with 7
surprising 7
agility 7
seeming 7
to 7
be 7
curious 7
about 7
us 7
and 7
disturbed 7
at 7
our 7
appearance 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
at 7
first 7
surprised 7
when 7
my 7
companions 7
after 7
collecting 7
stones 7
began 7
to 7
throw 7
them 7
at 7
the 7
lively 7
creatures 7
which 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
quite 7
harmless 7
but 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
saw 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
joined 7
them 7
heartily 7
for 7
the 7
monkeys 7
annoyed 7
and 7
wishing 7
to 7
pay 7
us 7
back 7
in 7
our 7
own 7
coin 7
began 7
to 7
tear 7
the 7
nuts 7
from 7
the 7
trees 7
and 7
cast 7
them 7
at 7
us 7
with 7
angry 7
and 7
spiteful 7
gestures 7
so 7
that 7
after 7
very 7
little 7
labour 7
our 7
sacks 7
were 7
filled 7
with 7
the 7
fruit 7
which 7
we 7
could 7
not 7
otherwise 7
have 7
obtained 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
we 7
had 7
as 7
many 7
as 7
we 7
could 7
carry 7
we 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
town 7
where 7
my 7
friend 7
bought 7
my 7
share 7
and 7
advised 7
me 7
to 7
continue 7
the 7
same 7
occupation 7
until 7
i 7
had 7
earned 7
money 7
enough 7
to 7
carry 7
me 7
to 7
my 7
own 7
country 7
this 7
i 7
did 7
and 7
before 7
long 7
had 7
amassed 7
a 7
considerable 7
sum 7
just 7
then 7
i 7
heard 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
trading 7
ship 7
ready 7
to 7
sail 7
and 7
taking 7
leave 7
of 7
my 7
friend 7
i 7
went 7
on 7
board 7
carrying 7
with 7
me 7
a 7
goodly 7
store 7
of 7
cocoanuts 7
and 7
we 7
sailed 7
first 7
to 7
the 7
islands 7
where 7
pepper 7
grows 7
then 7
to 7
comari 7
where 7
the 7
best 7
aloes 7
wood 7
is 7
found 7
and 7
where 7
men 7
drink 7
no 7
wine 7
by 7
an 7
unalterable 7
law 7
here 7
i 7
exchanged 7
my 7
nuts 7
for 7
pepper 7
and 7
good 7
aloes 7
wood 7
and 7
went 7
afishing 7
for 7
pearls 7
with 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
merchants 7
and 7
my 7
divers 7
were 7
so 7
lucky 7
that 7
very 7
soon 7
i 7
had 7
an 7
immense 7
number 7
and 7
those 7
very 7
large 7
and 7
perfect 7
with 7
all 7
these 7
treasures 7
i 7
came 7
joyfully 7
back 7
to 7
bagdad 7
where 7
i 7
disposed 7
of 7
them 7
for 7
large 7
sums 7
of 7
money 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
fail 7
as 7
before 7
to 7
give 7
the 7
tenth 7
part 7
to 7
the 7
poor 7
and 7
after 7
that 7
i 7
rested 7
from 7
my 7
labours 7
and 7
comforted 7
myself 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
pleasures 7
that 7
my 7
riches 7
could 7
give 7
me 7
having 7
thus 7
ended 7
his 7
story 7
sindbad 7
ordered 7
that 7
one 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
should 7
be 7
given 7
to 7
hindbad 7
and 7
the 7
guests 7
then 7
withdrew 7
but 7
after 7
the 7
next 7
days 7
feast 7
he 7
began 7
the 7
account 7
of 7
his 7
sixth 7
voyage 7
as 7
follows 7
sixth 7
voyage 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
a 7
marvel 7
to 7
you 7
how 7
after 7
having 7
five 7
times 7
met 7
with 7
shipwreck 7
and 7
unheard 7
of 7
perils 7
i 7
could 7
again 7
tempt 7
fortune 7
and 7
risk 7
fresh 7
trouble 7
i 7
am 7
even 7
surprised 7
myself 7
when 7
i 7
look 7
back 7
but 7
evidently 7
it 7
was 7
my 7
fate 7
to 7
rove 7
and 7
after 7
a 7
year 7
of 7
repose 7
i 7
prepared 7
to 7
make 7
a 7
sixth 7
voyage 7
regardless 7
of 7
the 7
entreaties 7
of 7
my 7
friends 7
and 7
relations 7
who 7
did 7
all 7
they 7
could 7
to 7
keep 7
me 7
at 7
home 7
instead 7
of 7
going 7
by 7
the 7
persian 7
gulf 7
i 7
travelled 7
a 7
considerable 7
way 7
overland 7
and 7
finally 7
embarked 7
from 7
a 7
distant 7
indian 7
port 7
with 7
a 7
captain 7
who 7
meant 7
to 7
make 7
a 7
long 7
voyage 7
and 7
truly 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
for 7
we 7
fell 7
in 7
with 7
stormy 7
weather 7
which 7
drove 7
us 7
completely 7
out 7
of 7
our 7
course 7
so 7
that 7
for 7
many 7
days 7
neither 7
captain 7
nor 7
pilot 7
knew 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
nor 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
going 7
when 7
they 7
did 7
at 7
last 7
discover 7
our 7
position 7
we 7
had 7
small 7
ground 7
for 7
rejoicing 7
for 7
the 7
captain 7
casting 7
his 7
turban 7
upon 7
the 7
deck 7
and 7
tearing 7
his 7
beard 7
declared 7
that 7
we 7
were 7
in 7
the 7
most 7
dangerous 7
spot 7
upon 7
the 7
whole 7
wide 7
sea 7
and 7
had 7
been 7
caught 7
by 7
a 7
current 7
which 7
was 7
at 7
that 7
minute 7
sweeping 7
us 7
to 7
destruction 7
it 7
was 7
too 7
true 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
sailors 7
could 7
do 7
we 7
were 7
driven 7
with 7
frightful 7
rapidity 7
towards 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
a 7
mountain 7
which 7
rose 7
sheer 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
our 7
vessel 7
was 7
dashed 7
to 7
pieces 7
upon 7
the 7
rocks 7
at 7
its 7
base 7
not 7
however 7
until 7
we 7
had 7
managed 7
to 7
scramble 7
on 7
shore 7
carrying 7
with 7
us 7
the 7
most 7
precious 7
of 7
our 7
possessions 7
when 7
we 7
had 7
done 7
this 7
the 7
captain 7
said 7
to 7
us 7
now 7
we 7
are 7
here 7
we 7
may 7
as 7
well 7
begin 7
to 7
dig 7
our 7
graves 7
at 7
once 7
since 7
from 7
this 7
fatal 7
spot 7
no 7
shipwrecked 7
mariner 7
has 7
ever 7
returned 7
this 7
speech 7
discouraged 7
us 7
much 7
and 7
we 7
began 7
to 7
lament 7
over 7
our 7
sad 7
fate 7
the 7
mountain 7
formed 7
the 7
seaward 7
boundary 7
of 7
a 7
large 7
island 7
and 7
the 7
narrow 7
strip 7
of 7
rocky 7
shore 7
upon 7
which 7
we 7
stood 7
was 7
strewn 7
with 7
the 7
wreckage 7
of 7
a 7
thousand 7
gallant 7
ships 7
while 7
the 7
bones 7
of 7
the 7
luckless 7
mariners 7
shone 7
white 7
in 7
the 7
sunshine 7
and 7
we 7
shuddered 7
to 7
think 7
how 7
soon 7
our 7
own 7
would 7
be 7
added 7
to 7
the 7
heap 7
all 7
around 7
too 7
lay 7
vast 7
quantities 7
of 7
the 7
costliest 7
merchandise 7
and 7
treasures 7
were 7
heaped 7
in 7
every 7
cranny 7
of 7
the 7
rocks 7
but 7
all 7
these 7
things 7
only 7
added 7
to 7
the 7
desolation 7
of 7
the 7
scene 7
it 7
struck 7
me 7
as 7
a 7
very 7
strange 7
thing 7
that 7
a 7
river 7
of 7
clear 7
fresh 7
water 7
which 7
gushed 7
out 7
from 7
the 7
mountain 7
not 7
far 7
from 7
where 7
we 7
stood 7
instead 7
of 7
flowing 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
as 7
rivers 7
generally 7
do 7
turned 7
off 7
sharply 7
and 7
flowed 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
under 7
a 7
natural 7
archway 7
of 7
rock 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
examine 7
it 7
more 7
closely 7
i 7
found 7
that 7
inside 7
the 7
cave 7
the 7
walls 7
were 7
thick 7
with 7
diamonds 7
and 7
rubies 7
and 7
masses 7
of 7
crystal 7
and 7
the 7
floor 7
was 7
strewn 7
with 7
ambergris 7
here 7
then 7
upon 7
this 7
desolate 7
shore 7
we 7
abandoned 7
ourselves 7
to 7
our 7
fate 7
for 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
possibility 7
of 7
scaling 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
if 7
a 7
ship 7
had 7
appeared 7
it 7
could 7
only 7
have 7
shared 7
our 7
doom 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
our 7
captain 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
divide 7
equally 7
amongst 7
us 7
all 7
the 7
food 7
we 7
possessed 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
length 7
of 7
each 7
mans 7
life 7
depended 7
on 7
the 7
time 7
he 7
could 7
make 7
his 7
portion 7
last 7
i 7
myself 7
could 7
live 7
upon 7
very 7
little 7
nevertheless 7
by 7
the 7
time 7
i 7
had 7
buried 7
the 7
last 7
of 7
my 7
companions 7
my 7
stock 7
of 7
provisions 7
was 7
so 7
small 7
that 7
i 7
hardly 7
thought 7
i 7
should 7
live 7
long 7
enough 7
to 7
dig 7
my 7
own 7
grave 7
which 7
i 7
set 7
about 7
doing 7
while 7
i 7
regretted 7
bitterly 7
the 7
roving 7
disposition 7
which 7
was 7
always 7
bringing 7
me 7
into 7
such 7
straits 7
and 7
thought 7
longingly 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
comfort 7
and 7
luxury 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
left 7
but 7
luckily 7
for 7
me 7
the 7
fancy 7
took 7
me 7
to 7
stand 7
once 7
more 7
beside 7
the 7
river 7
where 7
it 7
plunged 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
in 7
the 7
depths 7
of 7
the 7
cavern 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
did 7
so 7
an 7
idea 7
struck 7
me 7
this 7
river 7
which 7
hid 7
itself 7
underground 7
doubtless 7
emerged 7
again 7
at 7
some 7
distant 7
spot 7
why 7
should 7
i 7
not 7
build 7
a 7
raft 7
and 7
trust 7
myself 7
to 7
its 7
swiftly 7
flowing 7
waters 7
if 7
i 7
perished 7
before 7
i 7
could 7
reach 7
the 7
light 7
of 7
day 7
once 7
more 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
no 7
worse 7
off 7
than 7
i 7
was 7
now 7
for 7
death 7
stared 7
me 7
in 7
the 7
face 7
while 7
there 7
was 7
always 7
the 7
possibility 7
that 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
born 7
under 7
a 7
lucky 7
star 7
i 7
might 7
find 7
myself 7
safe 7
and 7
sound 7
in 7
some 7
desirable 7
land 7
i 7
decided 7
at 7
any 7
rate 7
to 7
risk 7
it 7
and 7
speedily 7
built 7
myself 7
a 7
stout 7
raft 7
of 7
driftwood 7
with 7
strong 7
cords 7
of 7
which 7
enough 7
and 7
to 7
spare 7
lay 7
strewn 7
upon 7
the 7
beach 7
i 7
then 7
made 7
up 7
many 7
packages 7
of 7
rubies 7
emeralds 7
rock 7
crystal 7
ambergris 7
and 7
precious 7
stuffs 7
and 7
bound 7
them 7
upon 7
my 7
raft 7
being 7
careful 7
to 7
preserve 7
the 7
balance 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
seated 7
myself 7
upon 7
it 7
having 7
two 7
small 7
oars 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
fashioned 7
laid 7
ready 7
to 7
my 7
hand 7
and 7
loosed 7
the 7
cord 7
which 7
held 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
bank 7
once 7
out 7
in 7
the 7
current 7
my 7
raft 7
flew 7
swiftly 7
under 7
the 7
gloomy 7
archway 7
and 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
in 7
total 7
darkness 7
carried 7
smoothly 7
forward 7
by 7
the 7
rapid 7
river 7
on 7
i 7
went 7
as 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
for 7
many 7
nights 7
and 7
days 7
once 7
the 7
channel 7
became 7
so 7
small 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
a 7
narrow 7
escape 7
of 7
being 7
crushed 7
against 7
the 7
rocky 7
roof 7
and 7
after 7
that 7
i 7
took 7
the 7
precaution 7
of 7
lying 7
flat 7
upon 7
my 7
precious 7
bales 7
though 7
i 7
only 7
ate 7
what 7
was 7
absolutely 7
necessary 7
to 7
keep 7
myself 7
alive 7
the 7
inevitable 7
moment 7
came 7
when 7
after 7
swallowing 7
my 7
last 7
morsel 7
of 7
food 7
i 7
began 7
to 7
wonder 7
if 7
i 7
must 7
after 7
all 7
die 7
of 7
hunger 7
then 7
worn 7
out 7
with 7
anxiety 7
and 7
fatigue 7
i 7
fell 7
into 7
a 7
deep 7
sleep 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
again 7
opened 7
my 7
eyes 7
i 7
was 7
once 7
more 7
in 7
the 7
light 7
of 7
day 7
a 7
beautiful 7
country 7
lay 7
before 7
me 7
and 7
my 7
raft 7
which 7
was 7
tied 7
to 7
the 7
river 7
bank 7
was 7
surrounded 7
by 7
friendly 7
looking 7
black 7
men 7
i 7
rose 7
and 7
saluted 7
them 7
and 7
they 7
spoke 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
return 7
but 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
understand 7
a 7
word 7
of 7
their 7
language 7
feeling 7
perfectly 7
bewildered 7
by 7
my 7
sudden 7
return 7
to 7
life 7
and 7
light 7
i 7
murmured 7
to 7
myself 7
in 7
arabic 7
close 7
thine 7
eyes 7
and 7
while 7
thou 7
sleepest 7
heaven 7
will 7
change 7
thy 7
fortune 7
from 7
evil 7
to 7
good 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
natives 7
who 7
understood 7
this 7
tongue 7
then 7
came 7
forward 7
saying 7
my 7
brother 7
be 7
not 7
surprised 7
to 7
see 7
us 7
this 7
is 7
our 7
land 7
and 7
as 7
we 7
came 7
to 7
get 7
water 7
from 7
the 7
river 7
we 7
noticed 7
your 7
raft 7
floating 7
down 7
it 7
and 7
one 7
of 7
us 7
swam 7
out 7
and 7
brought 7
you 7
to 7
the 7
shore 7
we 7
have 7
waited 7
for 7
your 7
awakening 7
tell 7
us 7
now 7
whence 7
you 7
come 7
and 7
where 7
you 7
were 7
going 7
by 7
that 7
dangerous 7
way 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
nothing 7
would 7
please 7
me 7
better 7
than 7
to 7
tell 7
them 7
but 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
starving 7
and 7
would 7
fain 7
eat 7
something 7
first 7
i 7
was 7
soon 7
supplied 7
with 7
all 7
i 7
needed 7
and 7
having 7
satisfied 7
my 7
hunger 7
i 7
told 7
them 7
faithfully 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
befallen 7
me 7
they 7
were 7
lost 7
in 7
wonder 7
at 7
my 7
tale 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
interpreted 7
to 7
them 7
and 7
said 7
that 7
adventures 7
so 7
surprising 7
must 7
be 7
related 7
to 7
their 7
king 7
only 7
by 7
the 7
man 7
to 7
whom 7
they 7
had 7
happened 7
so 7
procuring 7
a 7
horse 7
they 7
mounted 7
me 7
upon 7
it 7
and 7
we 7
set 7
out 7
followed 7
by 7
several 7
strong 7
men 7
carrying 7
my 7
raft 7
just 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
upon 7
their 7
shoulders 7
in 7
this 7
order 7
we 7
marched 7
into 7
the 7
city 7
of 7
serendib 7
where 7
the 7
natives 7
presented 7
me 7
to 7
their 7
king 7
whom 7
i 7
saluted 7
in 7
the 7
indian 7
fashion 7
prostrating 7
myself 7
at 7
his 7
feet 7
and 7
kissing 7
the 7
ground 7
but 7
the 7
monarch 7
bade 7
me 7
rise 7
and 7
sit 7
beside 7
him 7
asking 7
first 7
what 7
was 7
my 7
name 7
i 7
am 7
sindbad 7
i 7
replied 7
whom 7
men 7
call 7
the 7
sailor 7
for 7
i 7
have 7
voyaged 7
much 7
upon 7
many 7
seas 7
and 7
how 7
come 7
you 7
here 7
asked 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
told 7
my 7
story 7
concealing 7
nothing 7
and 7
his 7
surprise 7
and 7
delight 7
were 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
he 7
ordered 7
my 7
adventures 7
to 7
be 7
written 7
in 7
letters 7
of 7
gold 7
and 7
laid 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
archives 7
of 7
his 7
kingdom 7
presently 7
my 7
raft 7
was 7
brought 7
in 7
and 7
the 7
bales 7
opened 7
in 7
his 7
presence 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
declared 7
that 7
in 7
all 7
his 7
treasury 7
there 7
were 7
no 7
such 7
rubies 7
and 7
emeralds 7
as 7
those 7
which 7
lay 7
in 7
great 7
heaps 7
before 7
him 7
seeing 7
that 7
he 7
looked 7
at 7
them 7
with 7
interest 7
i 7
ventured 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
myself 7
and 7
all 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
were 7
at 7
his 7
disposal 7
but 7
he 7
answered 7
me 7
smiling 7
nay 7
sindbad 7
heaven 7
forbid 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
covet 7
your 7
riches 7
i 7
will 7
rather 7
add 7
to 7
them 7
for 7
i 7
desire 7
that 7
you 7
shall 7
not 7
leave 7
my 7
kingdom 7
without 7
some 7
tokens 7
of 7
my 7
good 7
will 7
he 7
then 7
commanded 7
his 7
officers 7
to 7
provide 7
me 7
with 7
a 7
suitable 7
lodging 7
at 7
his 7
expense 7
and 7
sent 7
slaves 7
to 7
wait 7
upon 7
me 7
and 7
carry 7
my 7
raft 7
and 7
my 7
bales 7
to 7
my 7
new 7
dwelling 7
place 7
you 7
may 7
imagine 7
that 7
i 7
praised 7
his 7
generosity 7
and 7
gave 7
him 7
grateful 7
thanks 7
nor 7
did 7
i 7
fail 7
to 7
present 7
myself 7
daily 7
in 7
his 7
audience 7
chamber 7
and 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
my 7
time 7
i 7
amused 7
myself 7
in 7
seeing 7
all 7
that 7

worthy 7
of 7

in 7
the 7
middle 7

the 7
curiosity 7
to 7

summit 7

after 7
many 7
days 7
i 7
petitioned 7
the 7
king 7
that 7
i 7
might 7
return 7
to 7
my 7
own 7
country 7

graciously 7
consented 7

and 7
when 7

and 7

glory 7
then 7
the 7
one 7
who 7

behind 7

the 7
king 7
himself 7
his 7
people 7
come 7
for 7
justice 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
well 7
satisfied 7
with 7
my 7
report 7
from 7
the 7
kings 7
letter 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
judged 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
a 7
wise 7
man 7
it 7
seems 7
that 7
he 7
is 7
worthy 7
of 7
his 7
people 7
and 7
his 7
people 7
of 7
him 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
dismissed 7
me 7
with 7
rich 7
presents 7
and 7
i 7
returned 7
in 7
peace 7
to 7
my 7
own 7
house 7
when 7
sindbad 7
had 7
done 7
speaking 7
his 7
guests 7
withdrew 7
hindbad 7
having 7
first 7
received 7
a 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
but 7
all 7
returned 7
next 7
day 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
seventh 7
voyage 7
sindbad 7
thus 7
began 7
seventh 7
and 7
last 7
voyage 7
after 7
my 7
sixth 7
voyage 7
i 7
was 7
quite 7
determined 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
go 7
to 7
sea 7
no 7
more 7
i 7
was 7
now 7
of 7
an 7
age 7
to 7
appreciate 7
a 7
quiet 7
life 7
and 7
i 7
had 7
run 7
risks 7
enough 7
i 7
only 7
wished 7
to 7
end 7
my 7
days 7
in 7
peace 7
one 7
day 7
however 7
when 7
i 7
was 7
entertaining 7
a 7
number 7
of 7
my 7
friends 7
i 7
was 7
told 7
that 7
an 7
officer 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
wished 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
admitted 7
he 7
bade 7
me 7
follow 7
him 7
into 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
haroun 7
al 7
raschid 7
which 7
i 7
accordingly 7
did 7
after 7
i 7
had 7
saluted 7
him 7
the 7
caliph 7
said 7
i 7
have 7
sent 7
for 7
you 7
sindbad 7
because 7
i 7
need 7
your 7
services 7
i 7
have 7
chosen 7
you 7
to 7
bear 7
a 7
letter 7
and 7
a 7
gift 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
serendib 7
in 7
return 7
for 7
his 7
message 7
of 7
friendship 7
the 7
caliphs 7
commandment 7
fell 7
upon 7
me 7
like 7
a 7
thunderbolt 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
i 7
answered 7
i 7
am 7
ready 7
to 7
do 7
all 7
that 7
your 7
majesty 7
commands 7
but 7
i 7
humbly 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
remember 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
utterly 7
disheartened 7
by 7
the 7
unheard 7
of 7
sufferings 7
i 7
have 7
undergone 7
indeed 7
i 7
have 7
made 7
a 7
vow 7
never 7
again 7
to 7
leave 7
bagdad 7
with 7
this 7
i 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
long 7
account 7
of 7
some 7
of 7
my 7
strangest 7
adventures 7
to 7
which 7
he 7
listened 7
patiently 7
i 7
admit 7
said 7
he 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
indeed 7
had 7
some 7
extraordinary 7
experiences 7
but 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
see 7
why 7
they 7
should 7
hinder 7
you 7
from 7
doing 7
as 7
i 7
wish 7
you 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
go 7
straight 7
to 7
serendib 7
and 7
give 7
my 7
message 7
then 7
you 7
are 7
free 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
and 7
do 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
but 7
go 7
you 7
must 7
my 7
honour 7
and 7
dignity 7
demand 7
it 7
seeing 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
help 7
for 7
it 7
i 7
declared 7
myself 7
willing 7
to 7
obey 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
delighted 7
at 7
having 7
got 7
his 7
own 7
way 7
gave 7
me 7
a 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
for 7
the 7
expenses 7
of 7
the 7
voyage 7
i 7
was 7
soon 7
ready 7
to 7
start 7
and 7
taking 7
the 7
letter 7
and 7
the 7
present 7
i 7
embarked 7
at 7
balsora 7
and 7
sailed 7
quickly 7
and 7
safely 7
to 7
serendib 7
here 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
disclosed 7
my 7
errand 7
i 7
was 7
well 7
received 7
and 7
brought 7
into 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
who 7
greeted 7
me 7
with 7
joy 7
welcome 7
sindbad 7
he 7
cried 7
i 7
have 7
thought 7
of 7
you 7
often 7
and 7
rejoice 7
to 7
see 7
you 7
once 7
more 7
after 7
thanking 7
him 7
for 7
the 7
honour 7
that 7
he 7
did 7
me 7
i 7
displayed 7
the 7
caliphs 7
gifts 7
first 7
a 7
bed 7
with 7
complete 7
hangings 7
all 7
cloth 7
of 7
gold 7
which 7
cost 7
a 7
thousand 7
sequins 7
and 7
another 7
like 7
to 7
it 7
of 7
crimson 7
stuff 7
fifty 7
robes 7
of 7
rich 7
embroidery 7
a 7
hundred 7
of 7
the 7
finest 7
white 7
linen 7
from 7
cairo 7
suez 7
cufa 7
and 7
alexandria 7
then 7
more 7
beds 7
of 7
different 7
fashion 7
and 7
an 7
agate 7
vase 7
carved 7
with 7
the 7
figure 7
of 7
a 7
man 7
aiming 7
an 7
arrow 7
at 7
a 7
lion 7
and 7
finally 7
a 7
costly 7
table 7
which 7
had 7
once 7
belonged 7
to 7
king 7
solomon 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
serendib 7
received 7
with 7
satisfaction 7
the 7
assurance 7
of 7
the 7
caliphs 7
friendliness 7
toward 7
him 7
and 7
now 7
my 7
task 7
being 7
accomplished 7
i 7
was 7
anxious 7
to 7
depart 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
some 7
time 7
before 7
the 7
king 7
would 7
think 7
of 7
letting 7
me 7
go 7
at 7
last 7
however 7
he 7
dismissed 7
me 7
with 7
many 7
presents 7
and 7
i 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
going 7
on 7
board 7
a 7
ship 7
which 7
sailed 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
for 7
four 7
days 7
all 7
went 7
well 7
on 7
the 7
fifth 7
day 7
we 7
had 7
the 7
misfortune 7
to 7
fall 7
in 7
with 7
pirates 7
who 7
seized 7
our 7
vessel 7
killing 7
all 7
who 7
resisted 7
and 7
making 7
prisoners 7
of 7
those 7
who 7
were 7
prudent 7
enough 7
to 7
submit 7
at 7
once 7
of 7
whom 7
i 7
was 7
one 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
despoiled 7
us 7
of 7
all 7
we 7
possessed 7
they 7
forced 7
us 7
to 7
put 7
on 7
vile 7
raiment 7
and 7
sailing 7
to 7
a 7
distant 7
island 7
there 7
sold 7
us 7
for 7
slaves 7
i 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
a 7
rich 7
merchant 7
who 7
took 7
me 7
home 7
with 7
him 7
and 7
clothed 7
and 7
fed 7
me 7
well 7
and 7
after 7
some 7
days 7
sent 7
for 7
me 7
and 7
questioned 7
me 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
i 7
could 7
do 7
i 7
answered 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
a 7
rich 7
merchant 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
captured 7
by 7
pirates 7
and 7
therefore 7
i 7
knew 7
no 7
trade 7
tell 7
me 7
said 7
he 7
can 7
you 7
shoot 7
with 7
a 7
bow 7
i 7
replied 7
that 7
this 7
had 7
been 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
pastimes 7
of 7
my 7
youth 7
and 7
that 7
doubtless 7
with 7
practice 7
my 7
skill 7
would 7
come 7
back 7
to 7
me 7
upon 7
this 7
he 7
provided 7
me 7
with 7
a 7
bow 7
and 7
arrows 7
and 7
mounting 7
me 7
with 7
him 7
upon 7
his 7
own 7
elephant 7
took 7
the 7
way 7
to 7
a 7
vast 7
forest 7
which 7
lay 7
far 7
from 7
the 7
town 7
when 7
we 7
had 7
reached 7
the 7
wildest 7
part 7
of 7
it 7
we 7
stopped 7
and 7
my 7
master 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
this 7
forest 7
swarms 7
with 7
elephants 7
hide 7
yourself 7
in 7
this 7
great 7
tree 7
and 7
shoot 7
at 7
all 7
that 7
pass 7
you 7
when 7
you 7
have 7
succeeded 7
in 7
killing 7
one 7
come 7
and 7
tell 7
me 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
gave 7
me 7
a 7
supply 7
of 7
food 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
i 7
perched 7
myself 7
high 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
tree 7
and 7
kept 7
watch 7
that 7
night 7
i 7
saw 7
nothing 7
but 7
just 7
after 7
sunrise 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
a 7
large 7
herd 7
of 7
elephants 7
came 7
crashing 7
and 7
trampling 7
by 7
i 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
letting 7
fly 7
several 7
arrows 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
great 7
animals 7
fell 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
dead 7
and 7
the 7
others 7
retreated 7
leaving 7
me 7
free 7
to 7
come 7
down 7
from 7
my 7
hiding 7
place 7
and 7
run 7
back 7
to 7
tell 7
my 7
master 7
of 7
my 7
success 7
for 7
which 7
i 7
was 7
praised 7
and 7
regaled 7
with 7
good 7
things 7
then 7
we 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
forest 7
together 7
and 7
dug 7
a 7
mighty 7
trench 7
in 7
which 7
we 7
buried 7
the 7
elephant 7
i 7
had 7
killed 7
in 7
order 7
that 7
when 7
it 7
became 7
a 7
skeleton 7
my 7
master 7
might 7
return 7
and 7
secure 7
its 7
tusks 7
for 7
two 7
months 7
i 7
hunted 7
thus 7
and 7
no 7
day 7
passed 7
without 7
my 7
securing 7
an 7
elephant 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
always 7
station 7
myself 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
tree 7
but 7
sometimes 7
in 7
one 7
place 7
sometimes 7
in 7
another 7
one 7
morning 7
as 7
i 7
watched 7
the 7
coming 7
of 7
the 7
elephants 7
i 7
was 7
surprised 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
instead 7
of 7
passing 7
the 7
tree 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
as 7
they 7
usually 7
did 7
they 7
paused 7
and 7
completely 7
surrounded 7
it 7
trumpeting 7
horribly 7
and 7
shaking 7
the 7
very 7
ground 7
with 7
their 7
heavy 7
tread 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
saw 7
that 7
their 7
eyes 7
were 7
fixed 7
upon 7
me 7
i 7
was 7
terrified 7
and 7
my 7
arrows 7
dropped 7
from 7
my 7
trembling 7
hand 7
i 7
had 7
indeed 7
good 7
reason 7
for 7
my 7
terror 7
when 7
an 7
instant 7
later 7
the 7
largest 7
of 7
the 7
animals 7
wound 7
his 7
trunk 7
round 7
the 7
stem 7
of 7
my 7
tree 7
and 7
with 7
one 7
mighty 7
effort 7
tore 7
it 7
up 7
by 7
the 7
roots 7
bringing 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
entangled 7
in 7
its 7
branches 7
i 7
thought 7
now 7
that 7
my 7
last 7
hour 7
was 7
surely 7
come 7
but 7
the 7
huge 7
creature 7
picking 7
me 7
up 7
gently 7
enough 7
set 7
me 7
upon 7
its 7
back 7
where 7
i 7
clung 7
more 7
dead 7
than 7
alive 7
and 7
followed 7
by 7
the 7
whole 7
herd 7
turned 7
and 7
crashed 7
off 7
into 7
the 7
dense 7
forest 7
it 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
a 7
long 7
time 7
before 7
i 7
was 7
once 7
more 7
set 7
upon 7
my 7
feet 7
by 7
the 7
elephant 7
and 7
i 7
stood 7
as 7
if 7
in 7
a 7
dream 7
watching 7
the 7
herd 7
which 7
turned 7
and 7
trampled 7
off 7
in 7
another 7
direction 7
and 7
were 7
soon 7
hidden 7
in 7
the 7
dense 7
underwood 7
then 7
recovering 7
myself 7
i 7
looked 7
about 7
me 7
and 7
found 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
standing 7
upon 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
a 7
great 7
hill 7
strewn 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
see 7
on 7
either 7
hand 7
with 7
bones 7
and 7
tusks 7
of 7
elephants 7
this 7
then 7
must 7
be 7
the 7
elephants 7
burying 7
place 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
myself 7
and 7
they 7
must 7
have 7
brought 7
me 7
here 7
that 7
i 7
might 7
cease 7
to 7
persecute 7
them 7
seeing 7
that 7
i 7
want 7
nothing 7
but 7
their 7
tusks 7
and 7
here 7
lie 7
more 7
than 7
i 7
could 7
carry 7
away 7
in 7
a 7
lifetime 7
whereupon 7
i 7
turned 7
and 7
made 7
for 7
the 7
city 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
go 7
not 7
seeing 7
a 7
single 7
elephant 7
by 7
the 7
way 7
which 7
convinced 7
me 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
retired 7
deeper 7
into 7
the 7
forest 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
way 7
open 7
to 7
the 7
ivory 7
hill 7
and 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
how 7
sufficiently 7
to 7
admire 7
their 7
sagacity 7
after 7
a 7
day 7
and 7
a 7
night 7
i 7
reached 7
my 7
masters 7
house 7
and 7
was 7
received 7
by 7
him 7
with 7
joyful 7
surprise 7
ah 7
poor 7
sindbad 7
he 7
cried 7
i 7
was 7
wondering 7
what 7
could 7
have 7
become 7
of 7
you 7
when 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
forest 7
i 7
found 7
the 7
tree 7
newly 7
uprooted 7
and 7
the 7
arrows 7
lying 7
beside 7
it 7
and 7
i 7
feared 7
i 7
should 7
never 7
see 7
you 7
again 7
pray 7
tell 7
me 7
how 7
you 7
escaped 7
death 7
i 7
soon 7
satisfied 7
his 7
curiosity 7
and 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
we 7
went 7
together 7
to 7
the 7
ivory 7
hill 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
overjoyed 7
to 7
find 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
told 7
him 7
nothing 7
but 7
the 7
truth 7
when 7
we 7
had 7
loaded 7
our 7
elephant 7
with 7
as 7
many 7
tusks 7
as 7
it 7
could 7
carry 7
and 7
were 7
on 7
our 7
way 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
city 7
he 7
said 7
my 7
brothersince 7
i 7
can 7
no 7
longer 7
treat 7
as 7
a 7
slave 7
one 7
who 7
has 7
enriched 7
me 7
thustake 7
your 7
liberty 7
and 7
may 7
heaven 7
prosper 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
no 7
longer 7
conceal 7
from 7
you 7
that 7
these 7
wild 7
elephants 7
have 7
killed 7
numbers 7
of 7
our 7
slaves 7
every 7
year 7
no 7
matter 7
what 7
good 7
advice 7
we 7
gave 7
them 7
they 7
were 7
caught 7
sooner 7
or 7
later 7
you 7
alone 7
have 7
escaped 7
the 7
wiles 7
of 7
these 7
animals 7
therefore 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
under 7
the 7
special 7
protection 7
of 7
heaven 7
now 7
through 7
you 7
the 7
whole 7
town 7
will 7
be 7
enriched 7
without 7
further 7
loss 7
of 7
life 7
therefore 7
you 7
shall 7
not 7
only 7
receive 7
your 7
liberty 7
but 7
i 7
will 7
also 7
bestow 7
a 7
fortune 7
upon 7
you 7
to 7
which 7
i 7
replied 7
master 7
i 7
thank 7
you 7
and 7
wish 7
you 7
all 7
prosperity 7
for 7
myself 7
i 7
only 7
ask 7
liberty 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
my 7
own 7
country 7
it 7
is 7
well 7
he 7
answered 7
the 7
monsoon 7
will 7
soon 7
bring 7
the 7
ivory 7
ships 7
hither 7
then 7
i 7
will 7
send 7
you 7
on 7
your 7
way 7
with 7
somewhat 7
to 7
pay 7
your 7
passage 7
so 7
i 7
stayed 7
with 7
him 7
till 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
the 7
monsoon 7
and 7
every 7
day 7
we 7
added 7
to 7
our 7
store 7
of 7
ivory 7
till 7
all 7
his 7
warehouses 7
were 7
overflowing 7
with 7
it 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
other 7
merchants 7
knew 7
the 7
secret 7
but 7
there 7
was 7
enough 7
and 7
to 7
spare 7
for 7
all 7
when 7
the 7
ships 7
at 7
last 7
arrived 7
my 7
master 7
himself 7
chose 7
the 7
one 7
in 7
which 7
i 7
was 7
to 7
sail 7
and 7
put 7
on 7
board 7
for 7
me 7
a 7
great 7
store 7
of 7
choice 7
provisions 7
also 7
ivory 7
in 7
abundance 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
costliest 7
curiosities 7
of 7
the 7
country 7
for 7
which 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
thank 7
him 7
enough 7
and 7
so 7
we 7
parted 7
i 7
left 7
the 7
ship 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
port 7
we 7
came 7
to 7
not 7
feeling 7
at 7
ease 7
upon 7
the 7
sea 7
after 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
happened 7
to 7
me 7
by 7
reason 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
having 7
disposed 7
of 7
my 7
ivory 7
for 7
much 7
gold 7
and 7
bought 7
many 7
rare 7
and 7
costly 7
presents 7
i 7
loaded 7
my 7
pack 7
animals 7
and 7
joined 7
a 7
caravan 7
of 7
merchants 7
our 7
journey 7
was 7
long 7
and 7
tedious 7
but 7
i 7
bore 7
it 7
patiently 7
reflecting 7
that 7
at 7
least 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
to 7
fear 7
tempests 7
nor 7
pirates 7
nor 7
serpents 7
nor 7
any 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
perils 7
from 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
suffered 7
before 7
and 7
at 7
length 7
we 7
reached 7
bagdad 7
my 7
first 7
care 7
was 7
to 7
present 7
myself 7
before 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
give 7
him 7
an 7
account 7
of 7
my 7
embassy 7
he 7
assured 7
me 7
that 7
my 7
long 7
absence 7
had 7
disquieted 7
him 7
much 7
but 7
he 7
had 7
nevertheless 7
hoped 7
for 7
the 7
best 7
as 7
to 7
my 7
adventure 7
among 7
the 7
elephants 7
he 7
heard 7
it 7
with 7
amazement 7
declaring 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
believed 7
it 7
had 7
not 7
my 7
truthfulness 7
been 7
well 7
known 7
to 7
him 7
by 7
his 7
orders 7
this 7
story 7
and 7
the 7
others 7
i 7
had 7
told 7
him 7
were 7
written 7
by 7
his 7
scribes 7
in 7
letters 7
of 7
gold 7
and 7
laid 7
up 7
among 7
his 7
treasures 7
i 7
took 7
my 7
leave 7
of 7
him 7
well 7
satisfied 7
with 7
the 7
honours 7
and 7
rewards 7
he 7
bestowed 7
upon 7
me 7
and 7
since 7
that 7
time 7
i 7
have 7
rested 7
from 7
my 7
labours 7
and 7
given 7
myself 7
up 7
wholly 7
to 7
my 7
family 7
and 7
my 7
friends 7
thus 7
sindbad 7
ended 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
his 7
seventh 7
and 7
last 7
voyage 7
and 7
turning 7
to 7
hindbad 7
he 7
added 7
well 7
my 7
friend 7
and 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
think 7
now 7
have 7
you 7
ever 7
heard 7
of 7
anyone 7
who 7
has 7
suffered 7
more 7
or 7
had 7
more 7
narrow 7
escapes 7
than 7
i 7
have 7
is 7
it 7
not 7
just 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
now 7
enjoy 7
a 7
life 7
of 7
ease 7
and 7
tranquillity 7
hindbad 7
drew 7
near 7
and 7
kissing 7
his 7
hand 7
respectfully 7
replied 7
sir 7
you 7
have 7
indeed 7
known 7
fearful 7
perils 7
my 7
troubles 7
have 7
been 7
nothing 7
compared 7
to 7
yours 7
moreover 7
the 7
generous 7
use 7
you 7
make 7
of 7
your 7
wealth 7
proves 7
that 7
you 7
deserve 7
it 7
may 7
you 7
live 7
long 7
and 7
happily 7
in 7
the 7
enjoyment 7
in 7
it 7
sindbad 7
then 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
hundred 7
sequins 7
and 7
henceforward 7
counted 7
him 7
among 7
his 7
friends 7
also 7
he 7
caused 7
him 7
to 7
give 7
up 7
his 7
profession 7
as 7
a 7
porter 7
and 7
to 7
eat 7
daily 7
at 7
his 7
table 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
all 7
his 7
life 7
remember 7
sindbad 7
the 7
sailor 7
the 7
little 7
hunchback 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
kashgar 7
which 7
is 7
as 7
everybody 7
knows 7
situated 7
on 7
the 7
frontiers 7
of 7
great 7
tartary 7
there 7
lived 7
long 7
ago 7
a 7
tailor 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
who 7
loved 7
each 7
other 7
very 7
much 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
the 7
tailor 7
was 7
hard 7
at 7
work 7
a 7
little 7
hunchback 7
came 7
and 7
sat 7
at 7
the 7
entrance 7
of 7
the 7
shop 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
sing 7
and 7
play 7
his 7
tambourine 7
the 7
tailor 7
was 7
amused 7
with 7
the 7
antics 7
of 7
the 7
fellow 7
and 7
thought 7
he 7
would 7
take 7
him 7
home 7
to 7
divert 7
his 7
wife 7
the 7
hunchback 7
having 7
agreed 7
to 7
his 7
proposal 7
the 7
tailor 7
closed 7
his 7
shop 7
and 7
they 7
set 7
off 7
together 7
when 7
they 7
reached 7
the 7
house 7
they 7
found 7
the 7
table 7
ready 7
laid 7
for 7
supper 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
few 7
minutes 7
all 7
three 7
were 7
sitting 7
before 7
a 7
beautiful 7
fish 7
which 7
the 7
tailors 7
wife 7
had 7
cooked 7
with 7
her 7
own 7
hands 7
but 7
unluckily 7
the 7
hunchback 7
happened 7
to 7
swallow 7
a 7
large 7
bone 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
tailor 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
could 7
do 7
to 7
help 7
him 7
died 7
of 7
suffocation 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
besides 7
being 7
very 7
sorry 7
for 7
the 7
poor 7
man 7
the 7
tailor 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
were 7
very 7
much 7
frightened 7
on 7
their 7
own 7
account 7
for 7
if 7
the 7
police 7
came 7
to 7
hear 7
of 7
it 7
the 7
worthy 7
couple 7
ran 7
the 7
risk 7
of 7
being 7
thrown 7
into 7
prison 7
for 7
wilful 7
murder 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
prevent 7
this 7
dreadful 7
calamity 7
they 7
both 7
set 7
about 7
inventing 7
some 7
plan 7
which 7
would 7
throw 7
suspicion 7
on 7
some 7
one 7
else 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
they 7
made 7
up 7
their 7
minds 7
that 7
they 7
could 7
do 7
no 7
better 7
than 7
select 7
a 7
jewish 7
doctor 7
who 7
lived 7
close 7
by 7
as 7
the 7
author 7
of 7
the 7
crime 7
so 7
the 7
tailor 7
picked 7
up 7
the 7
hunchback 7
by 7
his 7
head 7
while 7
his 7
wife 7
took 7
his 7
feet 7
and 7
carried 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
doctors 7
house 7
then 7
they 7
knocked 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
which 7
opened 7
straight 7
on 7
to 7
a 7
steep 7
staircase 7
a 7
servant 7
soon 7
appeared 7
feeling 7
her 7
way 7
down 7
the 7
dark 7
staircase 7
and 7
inquired 7
what 7
they 7
wanted 7
tell 7
your 7
master 7
said 7
the 7
tailor 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
brought 7
a 7
very 7
sick 7
man 7
for 7
him 7
to 7
cure 7
and 7
he 7
added 7
holding 7
out 7
some 7
money 7
give 7
him 7
this 7
in 7
advance 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
may 7
not 7
feel 7
he 7
is 7
wasting 7
his 7
time 7
the 7
servant 7
remounted 7
the 7
stairs 7
to 7
give 7
the 7
message 7
to 7
the 7
doctor 7
and 7
the 7
moment 7
she 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
the 7
tailor 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
carried 7
the 7
body 7
swiftly 7
after 7
her 7
propped 7
it 7
up 7
at 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
staircase 7
and 7
ran 7
home 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
their 7
legs 7
could 7
carry 7
them 7
now 7
the 7
doctor 7
was 7
so 7
delighted 7
at 7
the 7
news 7
of 7
a 7
patient 7
for 7
he 7
was 7
young 7
and 7
had 7
not 7
many 7
of 7
them 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
transported 7
with 7
joy 7
get 7
a 7
light 7
he 7
called 7
to 7
the 7
servant 7
and 7
follow 7
me 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
you 7
can 7
and 7
rushing 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
room 7
he 7
ran 7
towards 7
the 7
staircase 7
there 7
he 7
nearly 7
fell 7
over 7
the 7
body 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
and 7
without 7
knowing 7
what 7
it 7
was 7
gave 7
it 7
such 7
a 7
kick 7
that 7
it 7
rolled 7
right 7
to 7
the 7
bottom 7
and 7
very 7
nearly 7
dragged 7
the 7
doctor 7
after 7
it 7
a 7
light 7
a 7
light 7
he 7
cried 7
again 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
brought 7
and 7
he 7
saw 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
he 7
was 7
almost 7
beside 7
himself 7
with 7
terror 7
holy 7
moses 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
why 7
did 7
i 7
not 7
wait 7
for 7
the 7
light 7
i 7
have 7
killed 7
the 7
sick 7
man 7
whom 7
they 7
brought 7
me 7
and 7
if 7
the 7
sacred 7
ass 7
of 7
esdras 7
does 7
not 7
come 7
to 7
my 7
aid 7
i 7
am 7
lost 7
it 7
will 7
not 7
be 7
long 7
before 7
i 7
am 7
led 7
to 7
jail 7
as 7
a 7
murderer 7
agitated 7
though 7
he 7
was 7
and 7
with 7
reason 7
the 7
doctor 7
did 7
not 7
forget 7
to 7
shut 7
the 7
house 7
door 7
lest 7
some 7
passersby 7
might 7
chance 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
he 7
then 7
took 7
up 7
the 7
corpse 7
and 7
carried 7
it 7
into 7
his 7
wifes 7
room 7
nearly 7
driving 7
her 7
crazy 7
with 7
fright 7
it 7
is 7
all 7
over 7
with 7
us 7
she 7
wailed 7
if 7
we 7
cannot 7
find 7
some 7
means 7
of 7
getting 7
the 7
body 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
house 7
once 7
let 7
the 7
sun 7
rise 7
and 7
we 7
can 7
hide 7
it 7
no 7
longer 7
how 7
were 7
you 7
driven 7
to 7
commit 7
such 7
a 7
terrible 7
crime 7
never 7
mind 7
that 7
returned 7
the 7
doctor 7
the 7
thing 7
is 7
to 7
find 7
a 7
way 7
out 7
of 7
it 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
while 7
the 7
doctor 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
continued 7
to 7
turn 7
over 7
in 7
their 7
minds 7
a 7
way 7
of 7
escape 7
but 7
could 7
not 7
find 7
any 7
that 7
seemed 7
good 7
enough 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
doctor 7
gave 7
it 7
up 7
altogether 7
and 7
resigned 7
himself 7
to 7
bear 7
the 7
penalty 7
of 7
his 7
misfortune 7
but 7
his 7
wife 7
who 7
had 7
twice 7
his 7
brains 7
suddenly 7
exclaimed 7
i 7
have 7
thought 7
of 7
something 7
let 7
us 7
carry 7
the 7
body 7
on 7
the 7
roof 7
of 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
lower 7
it 7
down 7
the 7
chimney 7
of 7
our 7
neighbour 7
the 7
mussulman 7
now 7
this 7
mussulman 7
was 7
employed 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
furnished 7
his 7
table 7
with 7
oil 7
and 7
butter 7
part 7
of 7
his 7
house 7
was 7
occupied 7
by 7
a 7
great 7
storeroom 7
where 7
rats 7
and 7
mice 7
held 7
high 7
revel 7
the 7
doctor 7
jumped 7
at 7
his 7
wifes 7
plan 7
and 7
they 7
took 7
up 7
the 7
hunchback 7
and 7
passing 7
cords 7
under 7
his 7
armpits 7
they 7
let 7
him 7
down 7
into 7
the 7
purveyors 7
bedroom 7
so 7
gently 7
that 7
he 7
really 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
leaning 7
against 7
the 7
wall 7
when 7
they 7
felt 7
he 7
was 7
touching 7
the 7
ground 7
they 7
drew 7
up 7
the 7
cords 7
and 7
left 7
him 7
scarcely 7
had 7
they 7
got 7
back 7
to 7
their 7
own 7
house 7
when 7
the 7
purveyor 7
entered 7
his 7
room 7
he 7
had 7
spent 7
the 7
evening 7
at 7
a 7
wedding 7
feast 7
and 7
had 7
a 7
lantern 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
in 7
the 7
dim 7
light 7
it 7
cast 7
he 7
was 7
astonished 7
to 7
see 7
a 7
man 7
standing 7
in 7
his 7
chimney 7
but 7
being 7
naturally 7
courageous 7
he 7
seized 7
a 7
stick 7
and 7
made 7
straight 7
for 7
the 7
supposed 7
thief 7
ah 7
he 7
cried 7
so 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
and 7
not 7
the 7
rats 7
and 7
mice 7
who 7
steal 7
my 7
butter 7
ill 7
take 7
care 7
that 7
you 7
dont 7
want 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
struck 7
him 7
several 7
hard 7
blows 7
the 7
corpse 7
fell 7
on 7
the 7
floor 7
but 7
the 7
man 7
only 7
redoubled 7
his 7
blows 7
till 7
at 7
length 7
it 7
occurred 7
to 7
him 7
it 7
was 7
odd 7
that 7
the 7
thief 7
should 7
lie 7
so 7
still 7
and 7
make 7
no 7
resistance 7
then 7
finding 7
he 7
was 7
quite 7
dead 7
a 7
cold 7
fear 7
took 7
possession 7
of 7
him 7
wretch 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
have 7
murdered 7
a 7
man 7
ah 7
my 7
revenge 7
has 7
gone 7
too 7
far 7
without 7
tho 7
help 7
of 7
allah 7
i 7
am 7
undone 7
cursed 7
be 7
the 7
goods 7
which 7
have 7
led 7
me 7
to 7
my 7
ruin 7
and 7
already 7
he 7
felt 7
the 7
rope 7
round 7
his 7
neck 7
but 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
got 7
over 7
the 7
first 7
shock 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
think 7
of 7
some 7
way 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
difficulty 7
and 7
seizing 7
the 7
hunchback 7
in 7
his 7
arms 7
he 7
carried 7
him 7
out 7
into 7
the 7
street 7
and 7
leaning 7
him 7
against 7
the 7
wall 7
of 7
a 7
shop 7
he 7
stole 7
back 7
to 7
his 7
own 7
house 7
without 7
once 7
looking 7
behind 7
him 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
before 7
the 7
sun 7
rose 7
a 7
rich 7
christian 7
merchant 7
who 7
supplied 7
the 7
palace 7
with 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
necessaries 7
left 7
his 7
house 7
after 7
a 7
night 7
of 7
feasting 7
to 7
go 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
though 7
he 7
was 7
very 7
drunk 7
he 7
was 7
yet 7
sober 7
enough 7
to 7
know 7
that 7
the 7
dawn 7
was 7
at 7
hand 7
and 7
that 7
all 7
good 7
mussulmen 7
would 7
shortly 7
be 7
going 7
to 7
prayer 7
so 7
he 7
hastened 7
his 7
steps 7
lest 7
he 7
should 7
meet 7
some 7
one 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
mosque 7
who 7
seeing 7
his 7
condition 7
would 7
send 7
him 7
to 7
prison 7
as 7
a 7
drunkard 7
in 7
his 7
haste 7
he 7
jostled 7
against 7
the 7
hunchback 7
who 7
fell 7
heavily 7
upon 7
him 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
thinking 7
he 7
was 7
being 7
attacked 7
by 7
a 7
thief 7
knocked 7
him 7
down 7
with 7
one 7
blow 7
of 7
his 7
fist 7
he 7
then 7
called 7
loudly 7
for 7
help 7
beating 7
the 7
fallen 7
man 7
all 7
the 7
while 7
the 7
chief 7
policeman 7
of 7
the 7
quarter 7
came 7
running 7
up 7
and 7
found 7
a 7
christian 7
illtreating 7
a 7
mussulman 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
he 7
asked 7
indignantly 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
rob 7
me 7
replied 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
very 7
nearly 7
choked 7
me 7
well 7
you 7
have 7
had 7
your 7
revenge 7
said 7
the 7
man 7
catching 7
hold 7
of 7
his 7
arm 7
come 7
be 7
off 7
with 7
you 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
he 7
held 7
out 7
his 7
hand 7
to 7
the 7
hunchback 7
to 7
help 7
him 7
up 7
but 7
the 7
hunchback 7
never 7
moved 7
oho 7
he 7
went 7
on 7
looking 7
closer 7
so 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
way 7
a 7
christian 7
has 7
the 7
impudence 7
to 7
treat 7
a 7
mussulman 7
and 7
seizing 7
the 7
merchant 7
in 7
a 7
firm 7
grasp 7
he 7
took 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
inspector 7
of 7
police 7
who 7
threw 7
him 7
into 7
prison 7
till 7
the 7
judge 7
should 7
be 7
out 7
of 7
bed 7
and 7
ready 7
to 7
attend 7
to 7
his 7
case 7
all 7
this 7
brought 7
the 7
merchant 7
to 7
his 7
senses 7
but 7
the 7
more 7
he 7
thought 7
of 7
it 7
the 7
less 7
he 7
could 7
understand 7
how 7
the 7
hunchback 7
could 7
have 7
died 7
merely 7
from 7
the 7
blows 7
he 7
had 7
received 7
the 7
merchant 7
was 7
still 7
pondering 7
on 7
this 7
subject 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
summoned 7
before 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
and 7
questioned 7
about 7
his 7
crime 7
which 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
deny 7
as 7
the 7
hunchback 7
was 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
private 7
jesters 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
resolved 7
to 7
defer 7
sentence 7
of 7
death 7
until 7
he 7
had 7
consulted 7
his 7
master 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
to 7
demand 7
an 7
audience 7
and 7
told 7
his 7
story 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
only 7
answered 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
pardon 7
for 7
a 7
christian 7
who 7
kills 7
a 7
mussulman 7
do 7
your 7
duty 7
so 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
ordered 7
a 7
gallows 7
to 7
be 7
erected 7
and 7
sent 7
criers 7
to 7
proclaim 7
in 7
every 7
street 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
that 7
a 7
christian 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
hanged 7
that 7
day 7
for 7
having 7
killed 7
a 7
mussulman 7
when 7
all 7
was 7
ready 7
the 7
merchant 7
was 7
brought 7
from 7
prison 7
and 7
led 7
to 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
gallows 7
the 7
executioner 7
knotted 7
the 7
cord 7
firmly 7
round 7
the 7
unfortunate 7
mans 7
neck 7
and 7
was 7
just 7
about 7
to 7
swing 7
him 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
when 7
the 7
sultans 7
purveyor 7
dashed 7
through 7
the 7
crowd 7
and 7
cried 7
panting 7
to 7
the 7
hangman 7
stop 7
stop 7
dont 7
be 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
hurry 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
he 7
who 7
did 7
the 7
murder 7
it 7
was 7
i 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
who 7
was 7
present 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
everything 7
was 7
in 7
order 7
put 7
several 7
questions 7
to 7
the 7
purveyor 7
who 7
told 7
him 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
and 7
how 7
he 7
had 7
carried 7
the 7
body 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
it 7
had 7
been 7
found 7
by 7
the 7
christian 7
merchant 7
you 7
are 7
going 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
to 7
kill 7
an 7
innocent 7
man 7
for 7
it 7
is 7
impossible 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
have 7
murdered 7
a 7
creature 7
who 7
was 7
dead 7
already 7
it 7
is 7
bad 7
enough 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
have 7
slain 7
a 7
mussulman 7
without 7
having 7
it 7
on 7
my 7
conscience 7
that 7
a 7
christian 7
who 7
is 7
guiltless 7
should 7
suffer 7
through 7
my 7
fault 7
now 7
the 7
purveyors 7
speech 7
had 7
been 7
made 7
in 7
a 7
loud 7
voice 7
and 7
was 7
heard 7
by 7
all 7
the 7
crowd 7
and 7
even 7
if 7
he 7
had 7
wished 7
it 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
escaped 7
setting 7
the 7
merchant 7
free 7
loose 7
the 7
cords 7
from 7
the 7
christians 7
neck 7
he 7
commanded 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
executioner 7
and 7
hang 7
this 7
man 7
in 7
his 7
place 7
seeing 7
that 7
by 7
his 7
own 7
confession 7
he 7
is 7
the 7
murderer 7
the 7
hangman 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
bid 7
and 7
was 7
tying 7
the 7
cord 7
firmly 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
stopped 7
by 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
the 7
jewish 7
doctor 7
beseeching 7
him 7
to 7
pause 7
for 7
he 7
had 7
something 7
very 7
important 7
to 7
say 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
fought 7
his 7
way 7
through 7
the 7
crowd 7
and 7
reached 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
worshipful 7
sir 7
he 7
began 7
this 7
mussulman 7
whom 7
you 7
desire 7
to 7
hang 7
is 7
unworthy 7
of 7
death 7
i 7
alone 7
am 7
guilty 7
last 7
night 7
a 7
man 7
and 7
a 7
woman 7
who 7
were 7
strangers 7
to 7
me 7
knocked 7
at 7
my 7
door 7
bringing 7
with 7
them 7
a 7
patient 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
cure 7
the 7
servant 7
opened 7
it 7
but 7
having 7
no 7
light 7
was 7
hardly 7
able 7
to 7
make 7
out 7
their 7
faces 7
though 7
she 7
readily 7
agreed 7
to 7
wake 7
me 7
and 7
to 7
hand 7
me 7
the 7
fee 7
for 7
my 7
services 7
while 7
she 7
was 7
telling 7
me 7
her 7
story 7
they 7
seem 7
to 7
have 7
carried 7
the 7
sick 7
man 7
to 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
staircase 7
and 7
then 7
left 7
him 7
there 7
i 7
jumped 7
up 7
in 7
a 7
hurry 7
without 7
waiting 7
for 7
a 7
lantern 7
and 7
in 7
the 7
darkness 7
i 7
fell 7
against 7
something 7
which 7
tumbled 7
headlong 7
down 7
the 7
stairs 7
and 7
never 7
stopped 7
till 7
it 7
reached 7
the 7
bottom 7
when 7
i 7
examined 7
the 7
body 7
i 7
found 7
it 7
was 7
quite 7
dead 7
and 7
the 7
corpse 7
was 7
that 7
of 7
a 7
hunchback 7
mussulman 7
terrified 7
at 7
what 7
we 7
had 7
done 7
my 7
wife 7
and 7
i 7
took 7
the 7
body 7
on 7
the 7
roof 7
and 7
let 7
it 7
down 7
the 7
chimney 7
of 7
our 7
neighbour 7
the 7
purveyor 7
whom 7
you 7
were 7
just 7
about 7
to 7
hang 7
the 7
purveyor 7
finding 7
him 7
in 7
his 7
room 7
naturally 7
thought 7
he 7
was 7
a 7
thief 7
and 7
struck 7
him 7
such 7
a 7
blow 7
that 7
the 7
man 7
fell 7
down 7
and 7
lay 7
motionless 7
on 7
the 7
floor 7
stooping 7
to 7
examine 7
him 7
and 7
finding 7
him 7
stone 7
dead 7
the 7
purveyor 7
supposed 7
that 7
the 7
man 7
had 7
died 7
from 7
the 7
blow 7
he 7
had 7
received 7
but 7
of 7
course 7
this 7
was 7
a 7
mistake 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
from 7
my 7
account 7
and 7
i 7
only 7
am 7
the 7
murderer 7
and 7
although 7
i 7
am 7
innocent 7
of 7
any 7
wish 7
to 7
commit 7
a 7
crime 7
i 7
must 7
suffer 7
for 7
it 7
all 7
the 7
same 7
or 7
else 7
have 7
the 7
blood 7
of 7
two 7
musselmans 7
on 7
my 7
conscience 7
therefore 7
send 7
away 7
this 7
man 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
take 7
his 7
place 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
i 7
who 7
am 7
guilty 7
on 7
hearing 7
the 7
declaration 7
of 7
the 7
jewish 7
doctor 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
commanded 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
be 7
led 7
to 7
the 7
gallows 7
and 7
the 7
sultans 7
purveyor 7
go 7
free 7
the 7
cord 7
was 7
placed 7
round 7
the 7
jews 7
neck 7
and 7
his 7
feet 7
had 7
already 7
ceased 7
to 7
touch 7
the 7
ground 7
when 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
the 7
tailor 7
was 7
heard 7
beseeching 7
the 7
executioner 7
to 7
pause 7
one 7
moment 7
and 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
say 7
oh 7
my 7
lord 7
he 7
cried 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
how 7
nearly 7
have 7
you 7
caused 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
three 7
innocent 7
people 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
only 7
have 7
the 7
patience 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
my 7
tale 7
you 7
shall 7
know 7
who 7
is 7
the 7
real 7
culprit 7
if 7
some 7
one 7
has 7
to 7
suffer 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
me 7
yesterday 7
at 7
dusk 7
i 7
was 7
working 7
in 7
my 7
shop 7
with 7
a 7
light 7
heart 7
when 7
the 7
little 7
hunchback 7
who 7
was 7
more 7
than 7
half 7
drunk 7
came 7
and 7
sat 7
in 7
the 7
doorway 7
he 7
sang 7
me 7
several 7
songs 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
invited 7
him 7
to 7
finish 7
the 7
evening 7
at 7
my 7
house 7
he 7
accepted 7
my 7
invitation 7
and 7
we 7
went 7
away 7
together 7
at 7
supper 7
i 7
helped 7
him 7
to 7
a 7
slice 7
of 7
fish 7
but 7
in 7
eating 7
it 7
a 7
bone 7
stuck 7
in 7
his 7
throat 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
we 7
could 7
do 7
he 7
died 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
we 7
felt 7
deeply 7
sorry 7
for 7
his 7
death 7
but 7
fearing 7
lest 7
we 7
should 7
be 7
held 7
responsible 7
we 7
carried 7
the 7
corpse 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
of 7
the 7
jewish 7
doctor 7
i 7
knocked 7
and 7
desired 7
the 7
servant 7
to 7
beg 7
her 7
master 7
to 7
come 7
down 7
as 7
fast 7
as 7
possible 7
and 7
see 7
a 7
sick 7
man 7
whom 7
we 7
had 7
brought 7
for 7
him 7
to 7
cure 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
hasten 7
his 7
movements 7
i 7
placed 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
money 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
as 7
the 7
doctors 7
fee 7
directly 7
she 7
had 7
disappeared 7
i 7
dragged 7
the 7
body 7
to 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
stairs 7
and 7
then 7
hurried 7
away 7
with 7
my 7
wife 7
back 7
to 7
our 7
house 7
in 7
descending 7
the 7
stairs 7
the 7
doctor 7
accidentally 7
knocked 7
over 7
the 7
corpse 7
and 7
finding 7
him 7
dead 7
believed 7
that 7
he 7
himself 7
was 7
the 7
murderer 7
but 7
now 7
you 7
know 7
the 7
truth 7
set 7
him 7
free 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
die 7
in 7
his 7
stead 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
and 7
the 7
crowd 7
of 7
spectators 7
were 7
lost 7
in 7
astonishment 7
at 7
the 7
strange 7
events 7
to 7
which 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
had 7
given 7
rise 7
loosen 7
the 7
jewish 7
doctor 7
said 7
he 7
to 7
the 7
hangman 7
and 7
string 7
up 7
the 7
tailor 7
instead 7
since 7
he 7
has 7
made 7
confession 7
of 7
his 7
crime 7
really 7
one 7
cannot 7
deny 7
that 7
this 7
is 7
a 7
very 7
singular 7
story 7
and 7
it 7
deserves 7
to 7
be 7
written 7
in 7
letters 7
of 7
gold 7
the 7
executioner 7
speedily 7
untied 7
the 7
knots 7
which 7
confined 7
the 7
doctor 7
and 7
was 7
passing 7
the 7
cord 7
round 7
the 7
neck 7
of 7
the 7
tailor 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
kashgar 7
who 7
had 7
missed 7
his 7
jester 7
happened 7
to 7
make 7
inquiry 7
of 7
his 7
officers 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
him 7
sire 7
replied 7
they 7
the 7
hunchback 7
having 7
drunk 7
more 7
than 7
was 7
good 7
for 7
him 7
escaped 7
from 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
was 7
seen 7
wandering 7
about 7
the 7
town 7
where 7
this 7
morning 7
he 7
was 7
found 7
dead 7
a 7
man 7
was 7
arrested 7
for 7
having 7
caused 7
his 7
death 7
and 7
held 7
in 7
custody 7
till 7
a 7
gallows 7
was 7
erected 7
at 7
the 7
moment 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
suffer 7
punishment 7
first 7
one 7
man 7
arrived 7
and 7
then 7
another 7
each 7
accusing 7
themselves 7
of 7
the 7
murder 7
and 7
this 7
went 7
on 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
time 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
present 7
instant 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
is 7
engaged 7
in 7
questioning 7
a 7
man 7
who 7
declares 7
that 7
he 7
alone 7
is 7
the 7
true 7
assassin 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
kashgar 7
no 7
sooner 7
heard 7
these 7
words 7
than 7
he 7
ordered 7
an 7
usher 7
to 7
go 7
to 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
and 7
to 7
bring 7
all 7
the 7
persons 7
concerned 7
in 7
the 7
hunchbacks 7
death 7
together 7
with 7
the 7
corpse 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
see 7
once 7
again 7
the 7
usher 7
hastened 7
on 7
his 7
errand 7
but 7
was 7
only 7
just 7
in 7
time 7
for 7
the 7
tailor 7
was 7
positively 7
swinging 7
in 7
the 7
air 7
when 7
his 7
voice 7
fell 7
upon 7
the 7
silence 7
of 7
the 7
crowd 7
commanding 7
the 7
hangman 7
to 7
cut 7
down 7
the 7
body 7
the 7
hangman 7
recognising 7
the 7
usher 7
as 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
servants 7
cut 7
down 7
the 7
tailor 7
and 7
the 7
usher 7
seeing 7
the 7
man 7
was 7
safe 7
sought 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
and 7
gave 7
him 7
the 7
sultans 7
message 7
accordingly 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
at 7
once 7
set 7
out 7
for 7
the 7
palace 7
taking 7
with 7
him 7
the 7
tailor 7
the 7
doctor 7
the 7
purveyor 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
bore 7
the 7
dead 7
hunchback 7
on 7
their 7
shoulders 7
when 7
the 7
procession 7
reached 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
police 7
prostrated 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
related 7
all 7
that 7
he 7
knew 7
of 7
the 7
matter 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
struck 7
by 7
the 7
circumstances 7
that 7
he 7
ordered 7
his 7
private 7
historian 7
to 7
write 7
down 7
an 7
exact 7
account 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
so 7
that 7
in 7
the 7
years 7
to 7
come 7
the 7
miraculous 7
escape 7
of 7
the 7
four 7
men 7
who 7
had 7
thought 7
themselves 7
murderers 7
might 7
never 7
be 7
forgotten 7
the 7
sultan 7
asked 7
everybody 7
concerned 7
in 7
the 7
hunchbacks 7
affair 7
to 7
tell 7
him 7
their 7
stories 7
among 7
others 7
was 7
a 7
prating 7
barber 7
whose 7
tale 7
of 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
brothers 7
follows 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
barbers 7
fifth 7
brother 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
our 7
father 7
lived 7
alnaschar 7
was 7
very 7
idle 7
instead 7
of 7
working 7
for 7
his 7
bread 7
he 7
was 7
not 7
ashamed 7
to 7
ask 7
for 7
it 7
every 7
evening 7
and 7
to 7
support 7
himself 7
next 7
day 7
on 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
received 7
the 7
night 7
before 7
when 7
our 7
father 7
died 7
worn 7
out 7
by 7
age 7
he 7
only 7
left 7
seven 7
hundred 7
silver 7
drachmas 7
to 7
be 7
divided 7
amongst 7
us 7
which 7
made 7
one 7
hundred 7
for 7
each 7
son 7
alnaschar 7
who 7
had 7
never 7
possessed 7
so 7
much 7
money 7
in 7
his 7
life 7
was 7
quite 7
puzzled 7
to 7
know 7
what 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
it 7
after 7
reflecting 7
upon 7
the 7
matter 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
he 7
decided 7
to 7
lay 7
it 7
out 7
on 7
glasses 7
bottles 7
and 7
things 7
of 7
that 7
sort 7
which 7
he 7
would 7
buy 7
from 7
a 7
wholesale 7
merchant 7
having 7
bought 7
his 7
stock 7
he 7
next 7
proceeded 7
to 7
look 7
out 7
for 7
a 7
small 7
shop 7
in 7
a 7
good 7
position 7
where 7
he 7
sat 7
down 7
at 7
the 7
open 7
door 7
his 7
wares 7
being 7
piled 7
up 7
in 7
an 7
uncovered 7
basket 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
him 7
waiting 7
for 7
a 7
customer 7
among 7
the 7
passersby 7
in 7
this 7
attitude 7
he 7
remained 7
seated 7
his 7
eyes 7
fixed 7
on 7
the 7
basket 7
but 7
his 7
thoughts 7
far 7
away 7
unknown 7
to 7
himself 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
talk 7
out 7
loud 7
and 7
a 7
tailor 7
whose 7
shop 7
was 7
next 7
door 7
to 7
his 7
heard 7
quite 7
plainly 7
what 7
he 7
was 7
saying 7
this 7
basket 7
said 7
alnaschar 7
to 7
himself 7
has 7
cost 7
me 7
a 7
hundred 7
drachmas 7
all 7
that 7
i 7
possess 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
now 7
in 7
selling 7
the 7
contents 7
piece 7
by 7
piece 7
i 7
shall 7
turn 7
two 7
hundred 7
and 7
these 7
hundreds 7
i 7
shall 7
again 7
lay 7

grand 7
demeanour 7
and 7

little 7
gazing 7
straight 7
before 7

and 7
when 7
my 7

lovely 7
as 7
the 7
full 7
moon 7
stands 7
humbly 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
my 7
chair 7
i 7
shall 7
pretend 7
not 7
to 7
see 7
her 7

her 7
women 7

say 7
to 7
me 7
respected 7
lord 7

master 7
your 7
wife 7

before 7

to 7
look 7
her 7
way 7
she 7
is 7
tired 7

her 7
we 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
be 7
seated 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
shall 7
give 7
no 7
signs 7
of 7
even 7
hearing 7
this 7
speech 7
which 7
will 7
vex 7
them 7
mightily 7
they 7
will 7
throw 7
themselves 7
at 7
my 7
feet 7
with 7
lamentations 7
and 7
at 7
length 7
i 7
will 7
raise 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
throw 7
a 7
careless 7
glance 7
at 7
her 7
then 7
i 7
shall 7
go 7
back 7
to 7
my 7
former 7
attitude 7
the 7
women 7
will 7
think 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
displeased 7
at 7
my 7
wifes 7
dress 7
and 7
will 7
lead 7
her 7
away 7
to 7

on 7
a 7
finer 7
one 7
and 7
i 7
on 7
my 7
side 7
shall 7
replace 7
the 7
one 7

am 7
wearing 7
with 7
another 7
yet 7
more 7
splendid 7
they 7
will 7
then 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
charge 7
but 7
this 7
time 7
it 7
will 7
take 7
much 7
longer 7
before 7
they 7
persuade 7
me 7
even 7
to 7
look 7
at 7
my 7
wife 7
it 7
is 7
as 7
well 7
to 7

on 7
my 7
weddingday 7

on 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
our 7
lives 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
she 7
will 7
complain 7
to 7
her 7
mother 7
of 7
the 7
way 7
she 7
has 7
been 7
treated 7
which 7
will 7
fill 7
my 7
heart 7
with 7
joy 7
her 7
mother 7
will 7
come 7
to 7
seek 7
me 7
and 7
kissing 7
my 7
hands 7
with 7
respect 7
will 7
say 7
my 7
lord 7
for 7
she 7
could 7
not 7
dare 7
to 7
risk 7
my 7
anger 7
by 7
using 7
the 7
familiar 7
title 7
of 7
soninlaw 7
my 7
lord 7
do 7
not 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
refuse 7
to 7
look 7
upon 7
my 7
daughter 7
or 7
to 7
approach 7
her 7
she 7

lives 7
to 7
please 7
you 7
and 7
loves 7
you 7
with 7
all 7
her 7
soul 7
but 7
i 7
shall 7
pay 7
no 7
more 7
heed 7
to 7
my 7
motherinlaws 7
words 7
than 7
i 7
did 7
to 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
women 7
again 7
she 7
will 7
beseech 7
me 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
her 7
entreaties 7
throwing 7
herself 7
this 7
time 7
at 7
my 7
feet 7
but 7
all 7
to 7
no 7
purpose 7
then 7
putting 7
a 7
glass 7
of 7
wine 7
into 7
my 7
wifes 7
hand 7
she 7
will 7
say 7
to 7
her 7
there 7
present 7
that 7
to 7
him 7
yourself 7
he 7
cannot 7
have 7
the 7
cruelty 7
to 7
reject 7
anything 7
offered 7
by 7
so 7
beautiful 7
a 7
hand 7
and 7
my 7
wife 7
will 7
take 7
it 7
and 7
offer 7
it 7
to 7
me 7
tremblingly 7
with 7
tears 7
in 7
her 7
eyes 7
but 7
i 7
shall 7
look 7
in 7
the 7
other 7
direction 7
this 7
will 7
cause 7
her 7
to 7
weep 7
still 7
more 7
and 7
she 7
will 7
hold 7
out 7
the 7
glass 7
crying 7
adorable 7
husband 7
never 7
shall 7
i 7
cease 7
my 7
prayers 7
till 7
you 7
have 7
done 7
me 7
the 7
favour 7
to 7
drink 7
sick 7
of 7
her 7
importunities 7
these 7
words 7
will 7
goad 7
me 7
to 7
fury 7
i 7
shall 7
dart 7
an 7
angry 7
look 7
at 7
her 7
and 7
give 7
her 7
a 7
sharp 7
blow 7
on 7
the 7
cheek 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
giving 7
her 7
a 7
kick 7
so 7
violent 7
that 7
she 7
will 7
stagger 7
across 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
fall 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
sofa 7
my 7
brother 7
pursued 7
the 7
barber 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
absorbed 7
in 7
his 7
dreams 7
that 7
he 7
actually 7
did 7
give 7
a 7
kick 7
with 7
his 7
foot 7
which 7
unluckily 7
hit 7
the 7
basket 7
of 7
glass 7
it 7
fell 7
into 7
the 7
street 7
and 7
was 7
instantly 7
broken 7
into 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
his 7
neighbour 7
the 7
tailor 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
listening 7
to 7
his 7
visions 7
broke 7
into 7
a 7
loud 7
fit 7
of 7
laughter 7
as 7
he 7
saw 7
this 7
sight 7
wretched 7
man 7
he 7
cried 7
you 7
ought 7
to 7
die 7
of 7
shame 7
at 7
behaving 7
so 7
to 7
a 7
young 7
wife 7
who 7
has 7
done 7
nothing 7
to 7
you 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
a 7
brute 7
for 7
her 7
tears 7
and 7
prayers 7
not 7
to 7
touch 7
your 7
heart 7
if 7
i 7
were 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
i 7
would 7
order 7
you 7
a 7
hundred 7
blows 7
from 7
a 7
bullock 7
whip 7
and 7
would 7
have 7
you 7
led 7
round 7
the 7
town 7
accompanied 7
by 7
a 7
herald 7
who 7
should 7
proclaim 7
your 7
crimes 7
the 7
accident 7
so 7
fatal 7
to 7
all 7
his 7
profits 7
had 7
restored 7
my 7
brother 7
to 7
his 7
senses 7
and 7
seeing 7
that 7
the 7
mischief 7
had 7
been 7
caused 7
by 7
his 7
own 7
insufferable 7
pride 7
he 7
rent 7
his 7
clothes 7
and 7
tore 7
his 7
hair 7
and 7
lamented 7
himself 7
so 7
loudly 7
that 7
the 7
passersby 7
stopped 7
to 7
listen 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
friday 7
so 7
these 7
were 7
more 7
numerous 7
than 7
usual 7
some 7
pitied 7
alnaschar 7
others 7
only 7
laughed 7
at 7
him 7
but 7
the 7
vanity 7
which 7
had 7
gone 7
to 7
his 7
head 7
had 7
disappeared 7
with 7
his 7
basket 7
of 7
glass 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
loudly 7
bewailing 7
his 7
folly 7
when 7
a 7
lady 7
evidently 7
a 7
person 7
of 7
consideration 7
rode 7
by 7
on 7
a 7
mule 7
she 7
stopped 7
and 7
inquired 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
why 7
the 7
man 7
wept 7
they 7
told 7
her 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
a 7
poor 7
man 7
who 7
had 7
laid 7
out 7
all 7
his 7
money 7
on 7
this 7
basket 7
of 7
glass 7
which 7
was 7
now 7
broken 7
on 7
hearing 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
these 7
loud 7
wails 7
the 7
lady 7
turned 7
to 7
her 7
attendant 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
give 7
him 7
whatever 7
you 7
have 7
got 7
with 7
you 7
the 7
man 7
obeyed 7
and 7
placed 7
in 7
my 7
brothers 7
hands 7
a 7
purse 7
containing 7
five 7
hundred 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
alnaschar 7
almost 7
died 7
of 7
joy 7
on 7
receiving 7
it 7
he 7
blessed 7
the 7
lady 7
a 7
thousand 7
times 7
and 7
shutting 7
up 7
his 7
shop 7
where 7
he 7
had 7
no 7
longer 7
anything 7
to 7
do 7
he 7
returned 7
home 7
he 7
was 7
still 7
absorbed 7
in 7
contemplating 7
his 7
good 7
fortune 7
when 7
a 7
knock 7
came 7
to 7
his 7
door 7
and 7
on 7
opening 7
it 7
he 7
found 7
an 7
old 7
woman 7
standing 7
outside 7
my 7
son 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
favour 7
to 7
ask 7
of 7
you 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
hour 7
of 7
prayer 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
yet 7
washed 7
myself 7
let 7
me 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
enter 7
your 7
house 7
and 7
give 7
me 7
water 7
my 7
brother 7
although 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
a 7
stranger 7
to 7
him 7
did 7
not 7
hesitate 7
to 7
do 7
as 7
she 7
wished 7
he 7
gave 7
her 7
a 7
vessel 7
of 7
water 7
and 7
then 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
his 7
place 7
and 7
his 7
thoughts 7
and 7
with 7
his 7
mind 7
busy 7
over 7
his 7
last 7
adventure 7
he 7
put 7
his 7
gold 7
into 7
a 7
long 7
and 7
narrow 7
purse 7
which 7
he 7
could 7
easily 7
carry 7
in 7
his 7
belt 7
during 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
busy 7
over 7
her 7
prayers 7
and 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
finished 7
she 7
came 7
and 7
prostrated 7
herself 7
twice 7
before 7
my 7
brother 7
and 7
then 7
rising 7
called 7
down 7
endless 7
blessings 7
on 7
his 7
head 7
observing 7
her 7
shabby 7
clothes 7
my 7
brother 7
thought 7
that 7
her 7
gratitude 7
was 7
in 7
reality 7
a 7
hint 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
give 7
her 7
some 7
money 7
to 7
buy 7
some 7
new 7
ones 7
so 7
he 7
held 7
out 7
two 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
started 7
back 7
in 7
surprise 7
as 7
if 7
she 7
had 7
received 7
an 7
insult 7
good 7
heavens 7
she 7
exclaimed 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
this 7
is 7
it 7
possible 7
that 7
you 7
take 7
me 7
my 7
lord 7
for 7
one 7
of 7
those 7
miserable 7
creatures 7
who 7
force 7
their 7
way 7
into 7
houses 7
to 7
beg 7
for 7
alms 7
take 7
back 7
your 7
money 7
i 7
am 7
thankful 7
to 7
say 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
need 7
it 7
for 7
i 7
belong 7
to 7
a 7
beautiful 7
lady 7
who 7
is 7
very 7
rich 7
and 7
gives 7
me 7
everything 7
i 7
want 7
my 7
brother 7
was 7
not 7
clever 7
enough 7
to 7
detect 7
that 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
had 7
merely 7
refused 7
the 7
two 7
pieces 7
of 7
money 7
he 7
had 7
offered 7
her 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
get 7
more 7
but 7
he 7
inquired 7
if 7
she 7
could 7
procure 7
him 7
the 7
pleasure 7
of 7
seeing 7
this 7
lady 7
willingly 7
she 7
replied 7
and 7
she 7
will 7
be 7
charmed 7
to 7
marry 7
you 7
and 7
to 7
make 7
you 7
the 7
master 7
of 7
all 7
her 7
wealth 7
so 7
pick 7
up 7
your 7
money 7
and 7
follow 7
me 7
delighted 7
at 7
the 7
thought 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
found 7
so 7
easily 7
both 7
a 7
fortune 7
and 7
a 7
beautiful 7
wife 7
my 7
brother 7
asked 7
no 7
more 7
questions 7
but 7
concealing 7
his 7
purse 7
with 7
the 7
money 7
the 7
lady 7
had 7
given 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
folds 7
of 7
his 7
dress 7
he 7
set 7
out 7
joyfully 7
with 7
his 7
guide 7
they 7
walked 7
for 7
some 7
distance 7
till 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
stopped 7
at 7
a 7
large 7
house 7
where 7
she 7
knocked 7
the 7
door 7
was 7
opened 7
by 7
a 7
young 7
greek 7
slave 7
and 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
led 7
my 7
brother 7
across 7
a 7
wellpaved 7
court 7
into 7
a 7
wellfurnished 7
hall 7
here 7
she 7
left 7
him 7
to 7
inform 7
her 7
mistress 7
of 7
his 7
presence 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
day 7
was 7
hot 7
he 7
flung 7
himself 7
on 7
a 7
pile 7
of 7
cushions 7
and 7
took 7
off 7
his 7
heavy 7
turban 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
there 7
entered 7
a 7
lady 7
and 7
my 7
brother 7
perceived 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
glance 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
even 7
more 7
beautiful 7
and 7
more 7
richly 7
dressed 7
than 7
he 7
had 7
expected 7
he 7
rose 7
from 7
his 7
seat 7
but 7
the 7
lady 7
signed 7
to 7
him 7
to 7
sit 7
down 7
again 7
and 7
placed 7
herself 7
beside 7
him 7
after 7
the 7
usual 7
compliments 7
had 7
passed 7
between 7
them 7
she 7
said 7
we 7
are 7
not 7
comfortable 7
here 7
let 7
us 7
go 7
into 7
another 7
room 7
and 7
passing 7
into 7
a 7
smaller 7
chamber 7
apparently 7
communicating 7
with 7
no 7
other 7
she 7
continued 7
to 7
talk 7
to 7
him 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
then 7
rising 7
hastily 7
she 7
left 7
him 7
saying 7
stay 7
where 7
you 7
are 7
i 7
will 7
come 7
back 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
he 7
waited 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
told 7
but 7
instead 7
of 7
the 7
lady 7
there 7
entered 7
a 7
huge 7
black 7
slave 7
with 7
a 7
sword 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
approaching 7
my 7
brother 7
with 7
an 7
angry 7
countenance 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
what 7
business 7
have 7
you 7
here 7
his 7
voice 7
and 7
manner 7
were 7
so 7
terrific 7
that 7
alnaschar 7
had 7
not 7
strength 7
to 7
reply 7
and 7
allowed 7
his 7
gold 7
to 7
be 7
taken 7
from 7
him 7
and 7
even 7
sabre 7
cuts 7
to 7
be 7
inflicted 7
on 7
him 7
without 7
making 7
any 7
resistance 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
let 7
go 7
he 7
sank 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
powerless 7
to 7
move 7
though 7
he 7
still 7
had 7
possession 7
of 7
his 7
senses 7
thinking 7
he 7
was 7
dead 7
the 7
black 7
ordered 7
the 7
greek 7
slave 7
to 7
bring 7
him 7
some 7
salt 7
and 7
between 7
them 7
they 7
rubbed 7
it 7
into 7
his 7
wounds 7
thus 7
giving 7
him 7
acute 7
agony 7
though 7
he 7
had 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
mind 7
to 7
give 7
no 7
sign 7
of 7
life 7
they 7
then 7
left 7
him 7
and 7
their 7
place 7
was 7
taken 7
by 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
who 7
dragged 7
him 7
to 7
a 7
trapdoor 7
and 7
threw 7
him 7
down 7
into 7
a 7
vault 7
filled 7
with 7
the 7
bodies 7
of 7
murdered 7
men 7
at 7
first 7
the 7
violence 7
of 7
his 7
fall 7
caused 7
him 7
to 7
lose 7
consciousness 7
but 7
luckily 7
the 7
salt 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
rubbed 7
into 7
his 7
wounds 7
had 7
by 7
its 7
smarting 7
preserved 7
his 7
life 7
and 7
little 7
by 7
little 7
he 7
regained 7
his 7
strength 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
two 7
days 7
he 7
lifted 7
the 7
trapdoor 7
during 7
the 7
night 7
and 7
hid 7
himself 7
in 7
the 7
courtyard 7
till 7
daybreak 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
leave 7
the 7
house 7
in 7
search 7
of 7
more 7
prey 7
luckily 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
observe 7
him 7
and 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
he 7
stole 7
from 7
this 7
nest 7
of 7
assassins 7
and 7
took 7
refuge 7
in 7
my 7
house 7
i 7
dressed 7
his 7
wounds 7
and 7
tended 7
him 7
carefully 7
and 7
when 7
a 7
month 7
had 7
passed 7
he 7
was 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
ever 7
his 7
one 7
thought 7
was 7
how 7
to 7
be 7
revenged 7
on 7
that 7
wicked 7
old 7
hag 7
and 7
for 7
this 7
purpose 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
purse 7
made 7
large 7
enough 7
to 7
contain 7
five 7
hundred 7
gold 7
pieces 7
but 7
filled 7
it 7
instead 7
with 7
bits 7
of 7
glass 7
this 7
he 7
tied 7
round 7
him 7
with 7
his 7
sash 7
and 7
disguising 7
himself 7
as 7
an 7
old 7
woman 7
he 7
took 7
a 7
sabre 7
which 7
he 7
hid 7
under 7
his 7
dress 7
one 7
morning 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
hobbling 7
through 7
the 7
streets 7
he 7
met 7
his 7
old 7
enemy 7
prowling 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
she 7
could 7
find 7
anyone 7
to 7
decoy 7
he 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
imitating 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
a 7
woman 7
he 7
said 7
do 7
you 7
happen 7
to 7
have 7
a 7
pair 7
of 7
scales 7
you 7
could 7
lend 7
me 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
come 7
from 7
persia 7
and 7
have 7
brought 7
with 7
me 7
five 7
hundred 7
gold 7
pieces 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
anxious 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
they 7
are 7
the 7
proper 7
weight 7
good 7
woman 7
replied 7
the 7
old 7
hag 7
you 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
asked 7
anyone 7
better 7
my 7
son 7
is 7
a 7
moneychanger 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
follow 7
me 7
he 7
will 7
weigh 7
them 7
for 7
you 7
himself 7
only 7
we 7
must 7
be 7
quick 7
or 7
he 7
will 7
have 7
gone 7
to 7
his 7
shop 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
led 7
the 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
same 7
house 7
as 7
before 7
and 7
the 7
door 7
was 7
opened 7
by 7
the 7
same 7
greek 7
slave 7
again 7
my 7
brother 7
was 7
left 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
the 7
pretended 7
son 7
appeared 7
under 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
the 7
black 7
slave 7
miserable 7
crone 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
my 7
brother 7
get 7
up 7
and 7
come 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
turned 7
to 7
lead 7
the 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
of 7
murder 7
alnaschar 7
rose 7
too 7
and 7
drawing 7
the 7
sabre 7
from 7
under 7
his 7
dress 7
dealt 7
the 7
black 7
such 7
a 7
blow 7
on 7
his 7
neck 7
that 7
his 7
head 7
was 7
severed 7
from 7
his 7
body 7
my 7
brother 7
picked 7
up 7
the 7
head 7
with 7
one 7
hand 7
and 7
seizing 7
the 7
body 7
with 7
the 7
other 7
dragged 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
vault 7
when 7
he 7
threw 7
it 7
in 7
and 7
sent 7
the 7
head 7
after 7
it 7
the 7
greek 7
slave 7
supposing 7
that 7
all 7
had 7
passed 7
as 7
usual 7
shortly 7
arrived 7
with 7
the 7
basin 7
of 7
salt 7
but 7
when 7
she 7
beheld 7
alnaschar 7
with 7
the 7
sabre 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
she 7
let 7
the 7
basin 7
fall 7
and 7
turned 7
to 7
fly 7
my 7
brother 7
however 7
was 7
too 7
quick 7
for 7
her 7
and 7
in 7
another 7
instant 7
her 7
head 7
was 7
rolling 7
from 7
her 7
shoulders 7
the 7
noise 7
brought 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
running 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
he 7
seized 7
her 7
before 7
she 7
had 7
time 7
to 7
escape 7
wretch 7
he 7
cried 7
do 7
you 7
know 7
me 7
who 7
are 7
you 7
my 7
lord 7
she 7
replied 7
trembling 7
all 7
over 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
seen 7
you 7
before 7
i 7
am 7
he 7
whose 7
house 7
you 7
entered 7
to 7
offer 7
your 7
hypocritical 7
prayers 7
dont 7
you 7
remember 7
now 7
she 7
flung 7
herself 7
on 7
her 7
knees 7
to 7
implore 7
mercy 7
but 7
he 7
cut 7
her 7
in 7
four 7
pieces 7
there 7
remained 7
only 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
was 7
quite 7
ignorant 7
of 7
all 7
that 7
was 7
taking 7
place 7
around 7
her 7
he 7
sought 7
her 7
through 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
when 7
at 7
last 7
he 7
found 7
her 7
she 7
nearly 7
fainted 7
with 7
terror 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
him 7
she 7
begged 7
hard 7
for 7
life 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
generous 7
enough 7
to 7
give 7
her 7
but 7
he 7
bade 7
her 7
to 7
tell 7
him 7
how 7
she 7
had 7
got 7
into 7
partnership 7
with 7
the 7
abominable 7
creatures 7
he 7
had 7
just 7
put 7
to 7
death 7
i 7
was 7
once 7
replied 7
she 7
the 7
wife 7
of 7
an 7
honest 7
merchant 7
and 7
that 7
old 7
woman 7
whose 7
wickedness 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
used 7
occasionally 7
to 7
visit 7
me 7
madam 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
one 7
day 7
we 7
have 7
a 7
grand 7
wedding 7
at 7
our 7
house 7
today 7
if 7
you 7
would 7
do 7
us 7
the 7
honour 7
to 7
be 7
present 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
you 7
would 7
enjoy 7
yourself 7
i 7
allowed 7
myself 7
to 7
be 7
persuaded 7
put 7
on 7
my 7
richest 7
dress 7
and 7
took 7
a 7
purse 7
with 7
a 7
hundred 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
once 7
inside 7
the 7
doors 7
i 7
was 7
kept 7
by 7
force 7
by 7
that 7
dreadful 7
black 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
now 7
three 7
years 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
been 7
here 7
to 7
my 7
great 7
grief 7
that 7
horrible 7
black 7
must 7
have 7
amassed 7
great 7
wealth 7
remarked 7
my 7
brother 7
such 7
wealth 7
returned 7
she 7
that 7
if 7
you 7
succeed 7
in 7
carrying 7
it 7
all 7
away 7
it 7
will 7
make 7
you 7
rich 7
for 7
ever 7
come 7
and 7
let 7
us 7
see 7
how 7
much 7
there 7
is 7
she 7
led 7
alnaschar 7
into 7
a 7
chamber 7
filled 7
with 7
coffers 7
packed 7
with 7
gold 7
which 7
he 7
gazed 7
at 7
with 7
an 7
admiration 7
he 7
was 7
powerless 7
to 7
conceal 7
go 7
she 7
said 7
and 7
bring 7
men 7
to 7
carry 7
them 7
away 7
my 7
brother 7
did 7
not 7
wait 7
to 7
be 7
told 7
twice 7
and 7
hurried 7
out 7
into 7
the 7
streets 7
where 7
he 7
soon 7
collected 7
ten 7
men 7
they 7
all 7
came 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
but 7
what 7
was 7
his 7
surprise 7
to 7
find 7
the 7
door 7
open 7
and 7
the 7
room 7
with 7
the 7
chests 7
of 7
gold 7
quite 7
empty 7
the 7
lady 7
had 7
been 7
cleverer 7
than 7
himself 7
and 7
had 7
made 7
the 7
best 7
use 7
of 7
her 7
time 7
however 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
console 7
himself 7
by 7
removing 7
all 7
the 7
beautiful 7
furniture 7
which 7
more 7
than 7
made 7
up 7
for 7
the 7
five 7
hundred 7
gold 7
pieces 7
he 7
had 7
lost 7
unluckily 7
on 7
leaving 7
the 7
house 7
he 7
forgot 7
to 7
lock 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
the 7
neighbours 7
finding 7
the 7
place 7
empty 7
informed 7
the 7
police 7
who 7
next 7
morning 7
arrested 7
alnaschar 7
as 7
a 7
thief 7
my 7
brother 7
tried 7
to 7
bribe 7
them 7
to 7
let 7
him 7
off 7
but 7
far 7
from 7
listening 7
to 7
him 7
they 7
tied 7
his 7
hands 7
and 7
forced 7
him 7
to 7
walk 7
between 7
them 7
to 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
judge 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
explained 7
to 7
the 7
official 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
complaint 7
he 7
asked 7
alnaschar 7
where 7
he 7
had 7
obtained 7
all 7
the 7
furniture 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
taken 7
to 7
his 7
house 7
the 7
day 7
before 7
sir 7
replied 7
alnaschar 7
i 7
am 7
ready 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
but 7
give 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
your 7
word 7
that 7
i 7
shall 7
run 7
no 7
risk 7
of 7
punishment 7
that 7
i 7
promise 7
said 7
the 7
judge 7
so 7
my 7
brother 7
began 7
at 7
the 7
beginning 7
and 7
related 7
all 7
his 7
adventures 7
and 7
how 7
he 7
had 7
avenged 7
himself 7
on 7
those 7
who 7
had 7
betrayed 7
him 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
furniture 7
he 7
entreated 7
the 7
judge 7
at 7
least 7
to 7
allow 7
him 7
to 7
keep 7
part 7
to 7
make 7
up 7
for 7
the 7
five 7
hundred 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
stolen 7
from 7
him 7
the 7
judge 7
however 7
would 7
say 7
nothing 7
about 7
this 7
and 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
sending 7
men 7
to 7
fetch 7
away 7
all 7
that 7
alnaschar 7
had 7
taken 7
from 7
the 7
house 7
when 7
everything 7
had 7
been 7
moved 7
and 7
placed 7
under 7
his 7
roof 7
he 7
ordered 7
my 7
brother 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
never 7
more 7
to 7
enter 7
it 7
on 7
peril 7
of 7
his 7
life 7
fearing 7
that 7
if 7
he 7
returned 7
he 7
might 7
seek 7
justice 7
from 7
the 7
caliph 7
alnaschar 7
obeyed 7
and 7
was 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
to 7
a 7
neighbouring 7
city 7
when 7
he 7
fell 7
in 7
with 7
a 7
band 7
of 7
robbers 7
who 7
stripped 7
him 7
of 7
his 7
clothes 7
and 7
left 7
him 7
naked 7
by 7
the 7
roadside 7
hearing 7
of 7
his 7
plight 7
i 7
hurried 7
after 7
him 7
to 7
console 7
him 7
for 7
his 7
misfortunes 7
and 7
to 7
dress 7
him 7
in 7
my 7
best 7
robe 7
i 7
then 7
brought 7
him 7
back 7
disguised 7
under 7
cover 7
of 7
night 7
to 7
my 7
house 7
where 7
i 7
have 7
since 7
given 7
him 7
all 7
the 7
care 7
i 7
bestow 7
on 7
my 7
other 7
brothers 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
barbers 7
sixth 7
brother 7
there 7
now 7
remains 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
relate 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
my 7
sixth 7
brother 7
whose 7
name 7
was 7
schacabac 7
like 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
us 7
he 7
inherited 7
a 7
hundred 7
silver 7
drachmas 7
from 7
our 7
father 7
which 7
he 7
thought 7
was 7
a 7
large 7
fortune 7
but 7
through 7
illluck 7
he 7
soon 7
lost 7
it 7
all 7
and 7
was 7
driven 7
to 7
beg 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
smooth 7
tongue 7
and 7
good 7
manners 7
he 7
really 7
did 7
very 7
well 7
in 7
his 7
new 7
profession 7
and 7
he 7
devoted 7
himself 7
specially 7
to 7
making 7
friends 7
with 7
the 7
servants 7
in 7
big 7
houses 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
gain 7
access 7
to 7
their 7
masters 7
one 7
day 7
he 7
was 7
passing 7
a 7
splendid 7
mansion 7
with 7
a 7
crowd 7
of 7
servants 7
lounging 7
in 7
the 7
courtyard 7
he 7
thought 7
that 7
from 7
the 7
appearance 7
of 7
the 7
house 7
it 7
might 7
yield 7
him 7
a 7
rich 7
harvest 7
so 7
he 7
entered 7
and 7
inquired 7
to 7
whom 7
it 7
belonged 7
my 7
good 7
man 7
where 7
do 7
you 7
come 7
from 7
replied 7
the 7
servant 7
cant 7
you 7
see 7
for 7
yourself 7
that 7
it 7
can 7
belong 7
to 7
nobody 7
but 7
a 7
barmecide 7
for 7
the 7
barmecides 7
were 7
famed 7
for 7
their 7
liberality 7
and 7
generosity 7
my 7
brother 7
hearing 7
this 7
asked 7
the 7
porters 7
of 7
whom 7
there 7
were 7
several 7
if 7
they 7
would 7
give 7
him 7
alms 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
refuse 7
but 7
told 7
him 7
politely 7
to 7
go 7
in 7
and 7
speak 7
to 7
the 7
master 7
himself 7
my 7
brother 7
thanked 7
them 7
for 7
their 7
courtesy 7
and 7
entered 7
the 7
building 7
which 7
was 7
so 7
large 7
that 7
it 7
took 7
him 7
some 7
time 7
to 7
reach 7
the 7
apartments 7
of 7
the 7
barmecide 7
at 7
last 7
in 7
a 7
room 7
richly 7
decorated 7
with 7
paintings 7
he 7
saw 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
with 7
a 7
long 7
white 7
beard 7
sitting 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
who 7
received 7
him 7
with 7
such 7
kindness 7
that 7
my 7
brother 7
was 7
emboldened 7
to 7
make 7
his 7
petition 7
my 7
lord 7
he 7
said 7
you 7
behold 7
in 7
me 7
a 7
poor 7
man 7
who 7
only 7
lives 7
by 7
the 7
help 7
of 7
persons 7
as 7
rich 7
and 7
as 7
generous 7
as 7
you 7
before 7
he 7
could 7
proceed 7
further 7
he 7
was 7
stopped 7
by 7
the 7
astonishment 7
shown 7
by 7
the 7
barmecide 7
is 7
it 7
possible 7
he 7
cried 7
that 7
while 7
i 7
am 7
in 7
bagdad 7
a 7
man 7
like 7
you 7
should 7
be 7
starving 7
that 7
is 7
a 7
state 7
of 7
things 7
that 7
must 7
at 7
once 7
be 7
put 7
an 7
end 7
to 7
never 7
shall 7
it 7
be 7
said 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
abandoned 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
that 7
you 7
on 7
your 7
part 7
will 7
never 7
abandon 7
me 7
my 7
lord 7
answered 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
swear 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
broken 7
my 7
fast 7
this 7
whole 7
day 7
what 7
you 7
are 7
dying 7
of 7
hunger 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
barmecide 7
here 7
slave 7
bring 7
water 7
that 7
we 7
may 7
wash 7
our 7
hands 7
before 7
meat 7
no 7
slave 7
appeared 7
but 7
my 7
brother 7
remarked 7
that 7
the 7
barmecide 7
did 7
not 7
fail 7
to 7
rub 7
his 7
hands 7
as 7
if 7
the 7
water 7
had 7
been 7
poured 7
over 7
them 7
then 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
my 7
brother 7
why 7
dont 7
you 7
wash 7
your 7
hands 7
too 7
and 7
schacabac 7
supposing 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
joke 7
on 7
the 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
barmecide 7
though 7
he 7
could 7
see 7
none 7
himself 7
drew 7
near 7
and 7
imitated 7
his 7
motion 7
when 7
the 7
barmecide 7
had 7
done 7
rubbing 7
his 7
hands 7
he 7
raised 7
his 7
voice 7
and 7
cried 7
set 7
food 7
before 7
us 7
at 7
once 7
we 7
are 7
very 7
hungry 7
no 7
food 7
was 7
brought 7
but 7
the 7
barmecide 7
pretended 7
to 7
help 7
himself 7
from 7
a 7
dish 7
and 7
carry 7
a 7
morsel 7
to 7
his 7
mouth 7
saying 7
as 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
eat 7
my 7
friend 7
eat 7
i 7
entreat 7
help 7
yourself 7
as 7
freely 7
as 7
if 7
you 7
were 7
at 7
home 7
for 7
a 7
starving 7
man 7
you 7
seem 7
to 7
have 7
a 7
very 7
small 7
appetite 7
excuse 7
me 7
my 7
lord 7
replied 7
schacabac 7
imitating 7
his 7
gestures 7
as 7
before 7
i 7
really 7
am 7
not 7
losing 7
time 7
and 7
i 7
do 7
full 7
justice 7
to 7
the 7
repast 7
how 7
do 7
you 7
like 7
this 7
bread 7
asked 7
the 7
barmecide 7
i 7
find 7
it 7
particularly 7
good 7
myself 7
oh 7
my 7
lord 7
answered 7
my 7
brother 7
who 7
beheld 7
neither 7
meat 7
nor 7
bread 7
never 7
have 7
i 7
tasted 7
anything 7
so 7
delicious 7
eat 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
you 7
want 7
said 7
the 7
barmecide 7
i 7
bought 7
the 7
woman 7
who 7
makes 7
it 7
for 7
five 7
hundred 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
might 7
never 7
be 7
without 7
it 7
after 7
ordering 7
a 7
variety 7
of 7
dishes 7
which 7
never 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
placed 7
on 7
the 7
table 7
and 7
discussing 7
the 7
merits 7
of 7
each 7
one 7
the 7
barmecide 7
declared 7
that 7
having 7
dined 7
so 7
well 7
they 7
would 7
now 7
proceed 7
to 7
take 7
their 7
wine 7
to 7
this 7
my 7
brother 7
at 7
first 7
objected 7
declaring 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
forbidden 7
but 7
on 7
the 7
barmecide 7
insisting 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
question 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
drink 7
by 7
himself 7
he 7
consented 7
to 7
take 7
a 7
little 7
the 7
barmecide 7
however 7
pretended 7
to 7
fill 7
their 7
glasses 7
so 7
often 7
that 7
my 7
brother 7
feigned 7
that 7
the 7
wine 7
had 7
gone 7
into 7
his 7
head 7
and 7
struck 7
the 7
barmecide 7
such 7
a 7
blow 7
on 7
the 7
head 7
that 7
he 7
fell 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
indeed 7
he 7
raised 7
his 7
hand 7
to 7
strike 7
him 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
when 7
the 7
barmecide 7
cried 7
out 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
mad 7
upon 7
which 7
my 7
brother 7
controlled 7
himself 7
and 7
apologised 7
and 7
protested 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
all 7
the 7
fault 7
of 7
the 7
wine 7
he 7
had 7
drunk 7
at 7
this 7
the 7
barmecide 7
instead 7
of 7
being 7
angry 7
began 7
to 7
laugh 7
and 7
embraced 7
him 7
heartily 7
i 7
have 7
long 7
been 7
seeking 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
a 7
man 7
of 7
your 7
description 7
and 7
henceforth 7
my 7
house 7
shall 7
be 7
yours 7
you 7
have 7
had 7
the 7
good 7
grace 7
to 7
fall 7
in 7
with 7
my 7
humour 7
and 7
to 7
pretend 7
to 7
eat 7
and 7
to 7
drink 7
when 7
nothing 7
was 7
there 7
now 7
you 7
shall 7
be 7
rewarded 7
by 7
a 7
really 7
good 7
supper 7
then 7
he 7
clapped 7
his 7
hands 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
dishes 7
were 7
brought 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
tasted 7
in 7
imagination 7
before 7
and 7
during 7
the 7
repast 7
slaves 7
sang 7
and 7
played 7
on 7
various 7
instruments 7
all 7
the 7
while 7
schacabac 7
was 7
treated 7
by 7
the 7
barmecide 7
as 7
a 7
familiar 7
friend 7
and 7
dressed 7
in 7
a 7
garment 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
wardrobe 7
twenty 7
years 7
passed 7
by 7
and 7
my 7
brother 7
was 7
still 7
living 7
with 7
the 7
barmecide 7
looking 7
after 7
his 7
house 7
and 7
managing 7
his 7
affairs 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
that 7
time 7
his 7
generous 7
benefactor 7
died 7
without 7
heirs 7
so 7
all 7
his 7
possessions 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
they 7
even 7
despoiled 7
my 7
brother 7
of 7
those 7
that 7
rightly 7
belonged 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
he 7
now 7
as 7
poor 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
ever 7
been 7
in 7
his 7
life 7
decided 7
to 7
cast 7
in 7
his 7
lot 7
with 7
a 7
caravan 7
of 7
pilgrims 7
who 7
were 7
on 7
their 7
way 7
to 7
mecca 7
unluckily 7
the 7
caravan 7
was 7
attacked 7
and 7
pillaged 7
by 7
the 7
bedouins 7
and 7
the 7
pilgrims 7
were 7
taken 7
prisoners 7
my 7
brother 7
became 7
the 7
slave 7
of 7
a 7
man 7
who 7
beat 7
him 7
daily 7
hoping 7
to 7
drive 7
him 7
to 7
offer 7
a 7
ransom 7
although 7
as 7
schacabac 7
pointed 7
out 7
it 7
was 7
quite 7
useless 7
trouble 7
as 7
his 7
relations 7
were 7
as 7
poor 7
as 7
himself 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
bedouin 7
grew 7
tired 7
of 7
tormenting 7
and 7
sent 7
him 7
on 7
a 7
camel 7
to 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
a 7
high 7
barren 7
mountain 7
where 7
he 7
left 7
him 7
to 7
take 7
his 7
chance 7
a 7
passing 7
caravan 7
on 7
its 7
way 7
to 7
bagdad 7
told 7
me 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
and 7
i 7
hurried 7
to 7
his 7
rescue 7
and 7
brought 7
him 7
in 7
a 7
deplorable 7
condition 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
town 7
thiscontinued 7
the 7
barberis 7
the 7
tale 7
i 7
related 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
who 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
burst 7
into 7
fits 7
of 7
laughter 7
well 7
were 7
you 7
called 7
the 7
silent 7
said 7
he 7
no 7
name 7
was 7
ever 7
better 7
deserved 7
but 7
for 7
reasons 7
of 7
my 7
own 7
which 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
necessary 7
to 7
mention 7
i 7
desire 7
you 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
never 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
i 7
had 7
of 7
course 7
no 7
choice 7
but 7
to 7
obey 7
and 7
travelled 7
about 7
for 7
several 7
years 7
until 7
i 7
heard 7
of 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
when 7
i 7
hastily 7
returned 7
to 7
bagdad 7
only 7
to 7
find 7
that 7
all 7
my 7
brothers 7
were 7
dead 7
it 7
was 7
at 7
this 7
time 7
that 7
i 7
rendered 7
to 7
the 7
young 7
cripple 7
the 7
important 7
service 7
of 7
which 7
you 7
have 7
heard 7
and 7
for 7
which 7
as 7
you 7
know 7
he 7
showed 7
such 7
profound 7
ingratitude 7
that 7
he 7
preferred 7
rather 7
to 7
leave 7
bagdad 7
than 7
to 7
run 7
the 7
risk 7
of 7
seeing 7
me 7
i 7
sought 7
him 7
long 7
from 7
place 7
to 7
place 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
only 7
today 7
when 7
i 7
expected 7
it 7
least 7
that 7
i 7
came 7
across 7
him 7
as 7
much 7
irritated 7
with 7
me 7
as 7
ever 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
tailor 7
went 7
on 7
to 7
relate 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
lame 7
man 7
and 7
the 7
barber 7
which 7
has 7
already 7
been 7
told 7
when 7
the 7
barber 7
he 7
continued 7
had 7
finished 7
his 7
tale 7
we 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
conclusion 7
that 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
had 7
been 7
right 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
accused 7
him 7
of 7
being 7
a 7
great 7
chatterbox 7
however 7
we 7
wished 7
to 7
keep 7
him 7
with 7
us 7
and 7
share 7
our 7
feast 7
and 7
we 7
remained 7
at 7
table 7
till 7
the 7
hour 7
of 7
afternoon 7
prayer 7
then 7
the 7
company 7
broke 7
up 7
and 7
i 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
work 7
in 7
my 7
shop 7
it 7
was 7
during 7
this 7
interval 7
that 7
the 7
little 7
hunchback 7
half 7
drunk 7
already 7
presented 7
himself 7
before 7
me 7
singing 7
and 7
playing 7
on 7
his 7
drum 7
i 7
took 7
him 7
home 7
to 7
amuse 7
mg 7
wife 7
and 7
she 7
invited 7
him 7
to 7
supper 7
while 7
eating 7
some 7
fish 7
a 7
bone 7
got 7
into 7
his 7
throat 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
all 7
we 7
could 7
do 7
he 7
died 7
shortly 7
it 7
was 7
all 7
so 7
sudden 7
that 7
we 7
lost 7
our 7
heads 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
divert 7
suspicion 7
from 7
ourselves 7
we 7
carried 7
the 7
body 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
of 7
a 7
jewish 7
physician 7
he 7
placed 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
chamber 7
of 7
the 7
purveyor 7
and 7
the 7
purveyor 7
propped 7
it 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
street 7
where 7
it 7
was 7
thought 7
to 7
have 7
been 7
killed 7
by 7
the 7
merchant 7
this 7
sire 7
is 7
the 7
story 7
which 7
i 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
tell 7
to 7
satisfy 7
your 7
highness 7
it 7
is 7
now 7
for 7
you 7
to 7
say 7
if 7
we 7
deserve 7
mercy 7
or 7
punishment 7
life 7
or 7
death 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
kashgar 7
listened 7
with 7
an 7
air 7
of 7
pleasure 7
which 7
filled 7
the 7
tailor 7
and 7
his 7
friends 7
with 7
hope 7
i 7
must 7
confess 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
much 7
more 7
interested 7
in 7
the 7
stories 7
of 7
the 7
barber 7
and 7
his 7
brothers 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
lame 7
man 7
than 7
in 7
that 7
of 7
my 7
own 7
jester 7
but 7
before 7
i 7
allow 7
you 7
all 7
four 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
your 7
own 7
homes 7
and 7
have 7
the 7
corpse 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
properly 7
buried 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
see 7
this 7
barber 7
who 7
has 7
earned 7
your 7
pardon 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
is 7
in 7
this 7
town 7
let 7
an 7
usher 7
go 7
with 7
you 7
at 7
once 7
in 7
search 7
of 7
him 7
the 7
usher 7
and 7
the 7
tailor 7
soon 7
returned 7
bringing 7
with 7
them 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
who 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
at 7
least 7
ninety 7
years 7
of 7
age 7
o 7
silent 7
one 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
i 7
am 7
told 7
that 7
you 7
know 7
many 7
strange 7
stories 7
will 7
you 7
tell 7
some 7
of 7
them 7
to 7
me 7
never 7
mind 7
my 7
stories 7
for 7
the 7
present 7
replied 7
the 7
barber 7
but 7
will 7
your 7
highness 7
graciously 7
be 7
pleased 7
to 7
explain 7
why 7
this 7
jew 7
this 7
christian 7
and 7
this 7
mussulman 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
this 7
dead 7
body 7
are 7
all 7
here 7
what 7
business 7
is 7
that 7
of 7
yours 7
asked 7
the 7
sultan 7
with 7
a 7
smile 7
but 7
seeing 7
that 7
the 7
barber 7
had 7
some 7
reasons 7
for 7
his 7
question 7
he 7
commanded 7
that 7
the 7
tale 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
should 7
be 7
told 7
him 7
it 7
is 7
certainly 7
most 7
surprising 7
cried 7
he 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
heard 7
it 7
all 7
but 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
body 7
he 7
then 7
knelt 7
down 7
and 7
took 7
the 7
head 7
on 7
his 7
knees 7
looking 7
at 7
it 7
attentively 7
suddenly 7
he 7
burst 7
into 7
such 7
loud 7
laughter 7
that 7
he 7
fell 7
right 7
backwards 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
recovered 7
himself 7
enough 7
to 7
speak 7
he 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
man 7
is 7
no 7
more 7
dead 7
than 7
i 7
am 7
he 7
said 7
watch 7
me 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
he 7
drew 7
a 7
small 7
case 7
of 7
medicines 7
from 7
his 7
pocket 7
and 7
rubbed 7
the 7
neck 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
with 7
some 7
ointment 7
made 7
of 7
balsam 7
next 7
he 7
opened 7
the 7
dead 7
mans 7
mouth 7
and 7
by 7
the 7
help 7
of 7
a 7
pair 7
of 7
pincers 7
drew 7
the 7
bone 7
from 7
his 7
throat 7
at 7
this 7
the 7
hunchback 7
sneezed 7
stretched 7
himself 7
and 7
opened 7
his 7
eyes 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
all 7
those 7
who 7
saw 7
this 7
operation 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
which 7
to 7
admire 7
most 7
the 7
constitution 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
who 7
had 7
apparently 7
been 7
dead 7
for 7
a 7
whole 7
night 7
and 7
most 7
of 7
one 7
day 7
or 7
the 7
skill 7
of 7
the 7
barber 7
whom 7
everyone 7
now 7
began 7
to 7
look 7
upon 7
as 7
a 7
great 7
man 7
his 7
highness 7
desired 7
that 7
the 7
history 7
of 7
the 7
hunchback 7
should 7
be 7
written 7
down 7
and 7
placed 7
in 7
the 7
archives 7
beside 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
barber 7
so 7
that 7
they 7
might 7
be 7
associated 7
in 7
peoples 7
minds 7
to 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
time 7
and 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
stop 7
there 7
for 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
wipe 7
out 7
the 7
memory 7
of 7
what 7
they 7
had 7
undergone 7
he 7
commanded 7
that 7
the 7
tailor 7
the 7
doctor 7
the 7
purveyor 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
should 7
each 7
be 7
clothed 7
in 7
his 7
presence 7
with 7
a 7
robe 7
from 7
his 7
own 7
wardrobe 7
before 7
they 7
returned 7

the 7

forms 7
an 7
important 7
kingdom 7
it 7
was 7
governed 7
in 7
former 7
days 7
by 7
a 7
king 7
named 7
schahzaman 7
who 7
with 7
good 7
right 7
considered 7
himself 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
peaceful 7
prosperous 7
and 7
fortunate 7
monarchs 7
on 7
the 7
earth 7
in 7
fact 7
he 7
had 7
but 7
one 7
grievance 7
which 7
was 7
that 7
none 7
of 7
his 7
four 7
wives 7
had 7
given 7
him 7
an 7
heir 7
this 7
distressed 7
him 7
so 7
greatly 7
that 7
one 7
day 7
he 7
confided 7
his 7
grief 7
to 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
who 7
being 7
a 7
wise 7
counsellor 7
said 7
such 7
matters 7
are 7
indeed 7
beyond 7
human 7
aid 7
allah 7
alone 7
can 7
grant 7
your 7
desire 7
and 7
i 7
should 7
advise 7
you 7
sire 7
to 7
send 7
large 7
gifts 7
to 7
those 7
holy 7
men 7
who 7
spend 7
their 7
lives 7
in 7
prayer 7
and 7
to 7
beg 7
for 7
their 7
intercessions 7
who 7
knows 7
whether 7
their 7
petitions 7
may 7
not 7
be 7
answered 7
the 7
king 7
took 7
his 7
vizirs 7
advice 7
and 7
the 7
result 7
of 7
so 7
many 7
prayers 7
for 7
an 7
heir 7
to 7
the 7
throne 7
was 7
that 7
a 7
son 7
was 7
born 7
to 7
him 7
the 7
following 7
year 7
schahzaman 7
sent 7
noble 7
gifts 7
as 7
thank 7
offerings 7
to 7
all 7
the 7
mosques 7
and 7
religious 7
houses 7
and 7
great 7
rejoicings 7
were 7
celebrated 7
in 7
honour 7
of 7
the 7
birth 7
of 7
the 7
little 7
prince 7
who 7
was 7
so 7
beautiful 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
named 7
camaralzaman 7
or 7
moon 7
of 7
the 7
century 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
was 7
brought 7
up 7
with 7
extreme 7
care 7
by 7
an 7
excellent 7
governor 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
cleverest 7
teachers 7
and 7
he 7
did 7
such 7
credit 7
to 7
them 7
that 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
grown 7
up 7
a 7
more 7
charming 7
and 7
accomplished 7
young 7
man 7
was 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
whilst 7
he 7
was 7
still 7
a 7
youth 7
the 7
king 7
his 7
father 7
who 7
loved 7
him 7
dearly 7
had 7
some 7
thoughts 7
of 7
abdicating 7
in 7
his 7
favour 7
as 7
usual 7
he 7
talked 7
over 7
his 7
plans 7
with 7
his 7
grandvizir 7
who 7
though 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
approve 7
the 7
idea 7
would 7
not 7
state 7
all 7
his 7
objections 7
sire 7
he 7
replied 7
the 7
prince 7
is 7
still 7
very 7
young 7
for 7
the 7
cares 7
of 7
state 7
your 7
majesty 7
fears 7
his 7
growing 7
idle 7
and 7
careless 7
and 7
doubtless 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
but 7
how 7
would 7
it 7
be 7
if 7
he 7
were 7
first 7
to 7
marry 7
this 7
would 7
attach 7
him 7
to 7
his 7
home 7
and 7
your 7
majesty 7
might 7
give 7
him 7
a 7
share 7
in 7
your 7
counsels 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
gradually 7
learn 7
how 7
to 7
wear 7
a 7
crown 7
which 7
you 7
can 7
give 7
up 7
to 7
him 7
whenever 7
you 7
find 7
him 7
capable 7
of 7
wearing 7
it 7
the 7
vizirs 7
advice 7
once 7
more 7
struck 7
the 7
king 7
as 7
being 7
good 7
and 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
his 7
son 7
who 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
obeying 7
the 7
summons 7
and 7
standing 7
respectfully 7
with 7
downcast 7
eyes 7
before 7
the 7
king 7
asked 7
for 7
his 7
commands 7
i 7
have 7
sent 7
for 7
you 7
said 7
the 7
king 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
wish 7
you 7
to 7
marry 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
think 7
about 7
it 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
overcome 7
by 7
these 7
words 7
that 7
he 7
remained 7
silent 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
at 7
length 7
he 7
said 7
sire 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
to 7
pardon 7
me 7
if 7
i 7
am 7
unable 7
to 7
reply 7
as 7
you 7
might 7
wish 7
i 7
certainly 7
did 7
not 7
expect 7
such 7
a 7
proposal 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
still 7
so 7
young 7
and 7
i 7
confess 7
that 7
the 7
idea 7
of 7
marrying 7
is 7
very 7
distasteful 7
to 7
me 7
possibly 7
i 7
may 7
not 7
always 7
be 7
in 7
this 7
mind 7
but 7
i 7
certainly 7
feel 7
that 7
it 7
will 7
require 7
some 7
time 7
to 7
induce 7
me 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
step 7
which 7
your 7
majesty 7
desires 7
this 7
answer 7
greatly 7
distressed 7
the 7
king 7
who 7
was 7
sincerely 7
grieved 7
by 7
his 7
objection 7
to 7
marriage 7
however 7
he 7
would 7
not 7
have 7
recourse 7
to 7
extreme 7
measures 7
so 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
force 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
time 7
to 7
reflect 7
but 7
remember 7
that 7
such 7
a 7
step 7
is 7
necessary 7
for 7
a 7
prince 7
such 7
as 7
you 7
who 7
will 7
some 7
day 7
be 7
called 7
to 7
rule 7
over 7
a 7
great 7
kingdom 7
from 7
this 7
time 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
was 7
admitted 7
to 7
the 7
royal 7
council 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
showed 7
him 7
every 7
mark 7
of 7
favour 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
a 7
year 7
the 7
king 7
took 7
his 7
son 7
aside 7
and 7
said 7
well 7
my 7
son 7
have 7
you 7
changed 7
your 7
mind 7
on 7
the 7
subject 7
of 7
marriage 7
or 7
do 7
you 7
still 7
refuse 7
to 7
obey 7
my 7
wish 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
less 7
surprised 7
but 7
no 7
less 7
firm 7
than 7
on 7
the 7
former 7
occasion 7
and 7
begged 7
his 7
father 7
not 7
to 7
press 7
the 7
subject 7
adding 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
quite 7
useless 7
to 7
urge 7
him 7
any 7
longer 7
this 7
answer 7
much 7
distressed 7
the 7
king 7
who 7
again 7
confided 7
his 7
trouble 7
to 7
his 7
vizir 7
i 7
have 7
followed 7
your 7
advice 7
he 7
said 7
but 7
camaralzaman 7
declines 7
to 7
marry 7
and 7
is 7
more 7
obstinate 7
than 7
ever 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
vizir 7
much 7
is 7
gained 7
by 7
patience 7
and 7
your 7
majesty 7
might 7
regret 7
any 7
violence 7
why 7
not 7
wait 7
another 7
year 7
and 7
then 7
inform 7
the 7
prince 7
in 7
the 7
midst 7
of 7
the 7
assembled 7
council 7
that 7
the 7
good 7
of 7
the 7
state 7
demands 7
his 7
marriage 7
he 7
cannot 7
possibly 7
refuse 7
again 7
before 7
so 7
distinguished 7
an 7
assemblage 7
and 7
in 7
our 7
immediate 7
presence 7
the 7
sultan 7
ardently 7
desired 7
to 7
see 7
his 7
son 7
married 7
at 7
once 7
but 7
he 7
yielded 7
to 7
the 7
vizirs 7
arguments 7
and 7
decided 7
to 7
wait 7
he 7
then 7
visited 7
the 7
princes 7
mother 7
and 7
after 7
telling 7
her 7
of 7
his 7
disappointment 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
further 7
respite 7
he 7
had 7
given 7
his 7
son 7
he 7
added 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
camaralzaman 7
confides 7
more 7
in 7
you 7
than 7
he 7
does 7
in 7
me 7
pray 7
speak 7
very 7
seriously 7
to 7
him 7
on 7
this 7
subject 7
and 7
make 7
him 7
realize 7
that 7
he 7
will 7
most 7
seriously 7
displease 7
me 7
if 7
he 7
remains 7
obstinate 7
and 7
that 7
he 7
will 7
certainly 7
regret 7
the 7
measures 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
obliged 7
to 7
take 7
to 7
enforce 7
my 7
will 7
so 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
the 7
sultana 7
fatima 7
saw 7
her 7
son 7
she 7
told 7
him 7
she 7
had 7
heard 7
of 7
his 7
refusal 7
to 7
marry 7
adding 7
how 7
distressed 7
she 7
felt 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
have 7
vexed 7
his 7
father 7
so 7
much 7
she 7
asked 7
what 7
reasons 7
he 7
could 7
have 7
for 7
his 7
objections 7
to 7
obey 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
make 7
no 7
doubt 7
that 7
there 7
are 7
as 7
many 7
good 7
virtuous 7
sweet 7
and 7
amiable 7
women 7
as 7
there 7
are 7
others 7
very 7
much 7
the 7
reverse 7
would 7
that 7
all 7
were 7
like 7
you 7
but 7
what 7
revolts 7
me 7
is 7
the 7
idea 7
of 7
marrying 7
a 7
woman 7
without 7
knowing 7
anything 7
at 7
all 7
about 7
her 7
my 7
father 7
will 7
ask 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
daughter 7
of 7
some 7
neighbouring 7
sovereign 7
who 7
will 7
give 7
his 7
consent 7
to 7
our 7
union 7
be 7
she 7
fair 7
or 7
frightful 7
clever 7
or 7
stupid 7
good 7
or 7
bad 7
i 7
must 7
marry 7
her 7
and 7
am 7
left 7
no 7
choice 7
in 7
the 7
matter 7
how 7
am 7
i 7
to 7
know 7
that 7
she 7
will 7
not 7
be 7
proud 7
passionate 7
contemptuous 7
and 7
recklessly 7
extravagant 7
or 7
that 7
her 7
disposition 7
will 7
in 7
any 7
way 7
suit 7
mine 7
but 7
my 7
son 7
urged 7
fatima 7
you 7
surely 7
do 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
last 7
of 7
a 7
race 7
which 7
has 7
reigned 7
so 7
long 7
and 7
so 7
gloriously 7
over 7
this 7
kingdom 7
madam 7
said 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
wish 7
to 7
survive 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
but 7
should 7
i 7
do 7
so 7
i 7
will 7
try 7
to 7
reign 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
manner 7
as 7
may 7
be 7
considered 7
worthy 7
of 7
my 7
predecessors 7
these 7
and 7
similar 7
conversations 7
proved 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
how 7
useless 7
it 7
was 7
to 7
argue 7
with 7
his 7
son 7
and 7
the 7
year 7
elapsed 7
without 7
bringing 7
any 7
change 7
in 7
the 7
princes 7
ideas 7
at 7
length 7
a 7
day 7
came 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
summoned 7
him 7
before 7
the 7
council 7
and 7
there 7
informed 7
him 7
that 7
not 7
only 7
his 7
own 7
wishes 7
but 7
the 7
good 7
of 7
the 7
empire 7
demanded 7
his 7
marriage 7
and 7
desired 7
him 7
to 7
give 7
his 7
answer 7
before 7
the 7
assembled 7
ministers 7
at 7
this 7
camaralzaman 7
grew 7
so 7
angry 7
and 7
spoke 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
heat 7
that 7
the 7
king 7
naturally 7
irritated 7
at 7
being 7
opposed 7
by 7
his 7
son 7
in 7
full 7
council 7
ordered 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
be 7
arrested 7
and 7
locked 7
up 7
in 7
an 7
old 7
tower 7
where 7
he 7
had 7
nothing 7
but 7
a 7
very 7
little 7
furniture 7
a 7
few 7
books 7
and 7
a 7
single 7
slave 7
to 7
wait 7
on 7
him 7
camaralzaman 7
pleased 7
to 7
be 7
free 7
to 7
enjoy 7
his 7
books 7
showed 7
himself 7
very 7
indifferent 7
to 7
his 7
sentence 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
he 7
washed 7
himself 7
performed 7
his 7
devotions 7
and 7
having 7
read 7
some 7
pages 7
of 7
the 7
koran 7
lay 7
down 7
on 7
a 7
couch 7
without 7
putting 7
out 7
the 7
light 7
near 7
him 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
asleep 7
now 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
deep 7
well 7
in 7
the 7
tower 7
in 7
which 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
was 7
imprisoned 7
and 7
this 7
well 7
was 7
a 7
favourite 7
resort 7
of 7
the 7
fairy 7
maimoune 7
daughter 7
of 7
damriat 7
chief 7
of 7
a 7
legion 7
of 7
genii 7
towards 7
midnight 7
maimoune 7
floated 7
lightly 7
up 7
from 7
the 7
well 7
intending 7
according 7
to 7
her 7
usual 7
habit 7
to 7
roam 7
about 7
the 7
upper 7
world 7
as 7
curiosity 7
or 7
accident 7
might 7
prompt 7
the 7
light 7
in 7
the 7
princes 7
room 7
surprised 7
her 7
and 7
without 7
disturbing 7
the 7
slave 7
who 7
slept 7
across 7
the 7
threshold 7
she 7
entered 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
approaching 7
the 7
bed 7
was 7
still 7
more 7
astonished 7
to 7
find 7
it 7
occupied 7
the 7
prince 7
lay 7
with 7
his 7
face 7
half 7
hidden 7
by 7
the 7
coverlet 7
maimoune 7
lifted 7
it 7
a 7
little 7
and 7
beheld 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
youth 7
she 7
had 7
ever 7
seen 7
what 7
a 7
marvel 7
of 7
beauty 7
he 7
must 7
be 7
when 7
his 7
eyes 7
are 7
open 7
she 7
thought 7
what 7
can 7
he 7
have 7
done 7
to 7
deserve 7
to 7
be 7
treated 7
like 7
this 7
she 7
could 7
not 7
weary 7
gazing 7
at 7
camaralzaman 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
having 7
softly 7
kissed 7
his 7
brow 7
and 7
each 7
cheek 7
she 7
replaced 7
the 7
coverlet 7
and 7
resumed 7
her 7
flight 7
through 7
the 7
air 7
as 7
she 7
entered 7
the 7
middle 7
region 7
she 7
heard 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
great 7
wings 7
coming 7
towards 7
her 7
and 7
shortly 7
met 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
race 7
of 7
bad 7
genii 7
this 7
genie 7
whose 7
name 7
was 7
danhasch 7
recognised 7
maimoune 7
with 7
terror 7
for 7
he 7
knew 7
the 7
supremacy 7
which 7
her 7
goodness 7
gave 7
her 7
over 7
him 7
he 7
would 7
gladly 7
have 7
avoided 7
her 7
altogether 7
but 7
they 7
were 7
so 7
near 7
that 7
he 7
must 7
either 7
be 7
prepared 7
to 7
fight 7
or 7
yield 7
to 7
her 7
so 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
addressed 7
her 7
in 7
a 7
conciliatory 7
tone 7
good 7
maimoune 7
swear 7
to 7
me 7
by 7
allah 7
to 7
do 7
me 7
no 7
harm 7
and 7
on 7
my 7
side 7
i 7
will 7
promise 7
not 7
to 7
injure 7
you 7
accursed 7
genie 7
replied 7
maimoune 7
what 7
harm 7
can 7
you 7
do 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
will 7
grant 7
your 7
power 7
and 7
give 7
the 7
promise 7
you 7
ask 7
and 7
now 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
you 7
have 7
seen 7
and 7
done 7
tonight 7
fair 7
lady 7
said 7
danhasch 7
you 7
meet 7
me 7
at 7
the 7
right 7
moment 7
to 7
hear 7
something 7
really 7
interesting 7
i 7
must 7
tell 7
you 7
that 7
i 7
come 7
from 7
the 7
furthest 7
end 7
of 7
china 7
which 7
is 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
largest 7
and 7
most 7
powerful 7
kingdoms 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
the 7
present 7
king 7
has 7
one 7
only 7
daughter 7
who 7
is 7
so 7
perfectly 7
lovely 7
that 7
neither 7
you 7
nor 7
i 7
nor 7
any 7
other 7
creature 7
could 7
find 7
adequate 7
terms 7
in 7
which 7
to 7
describe 7
her 7
marvellous 7
charms 7
you 7
must 7
therefore 7
picture 7
to 7
yourself 7
the 7
most 7
perfect 7
features 7
joined 7
to 7
a 7
brilliant 7
and 7
delicate 7
complexion 7
and 7
an 7
enchanting 7
expression 7
and 7
even 7
then 7
imagination 7
will 7
fall 7
short 7
of 7
the 7
reality 7
the 7
king 7
her 7
father 7
has 7
carefully 7
shielded 7
this 7
treasure 7
from 7
the 7
vulgar 7
gaze 7
and 7
has 7
taken 7
every 7
precaution 7
to 7
keep 7
her 7
from 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
everyone 7
except 7
the 7
happy 7
mortal 7
he 7
may 7
choose 7
to 7
be 7
her 7
husband 7
but 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
give 7
her 7
variety 7
in 7
her 7
confinement 7
he 7
has 7
built 7
her 7
seven 7
palaces 7
such 7
as 7
have 7
never 7
been 7
seen 7
before 7
the 7
first 7
palace 7
is 7
entirely 7
composed 7
of 7
rock 7
crystal 7
the 7
second 7
of 7
bronze 7
the 7
third 7
of 7
fine 7
steel 7
the 7
fourth 7
of 7
another 7
and 7
more 7
precious 7
species 7
of 7
bronze 7
the 7
fifth 7
of 7
touchstone 7
the 7
sixth 7
of 7
silver 7
and 7
the 7
seventh 7
of 7
solid 7
gold 7
they 7
are 7
all 7
most 7
sumptuously 7
furnished 7
whilst 7
the 7
gardens 7
surrounding 7
them 7
are 7
laid 7
out 7
with 7
exquisite 7
taste 7
in 7
fact 7
neither 7
trouble 7
nor 7
cost 7
has 7
been 7
spared 7
to 7
make 7
this 7
retreat 7
agreeable 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
report 7
of 7
her 7
wonderful 7
beauty 7
has 7
spread 7
far 7
and 7
wide 7
and 7
many 7
powerful 7
kings 7
have 7
sent 7
embassies 7
to 7
ask 7
her 7
hand 7
in 7
marriage 7
the 7
king 7
has 7
always 7
received 7
these 7
embassies 7
graciously 7
but 7
says 7
that 7
he 7
will 7
never 7
oblige 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
marry 7
against 7
her 7
will 7
and 7
as 7
she 7
regularly 7
declines 7
each 7
fresh 7
proposal 7
the 7
envoys 7
have 7
had 7
to 7
leave 7
as 7
disappointed 7
in 7
the 7
result 7
of 7
their 7
missions 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
gratified 7
by 7
their 7
magnificent 7
receptions 7
sire 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
her 7
father 7
you 7
wish 7
me 7
to 7
marry 7
and 7
i 7
know 7
you 7
desire 7
to 7
please 7
me 7
for 7
which 7
i 7
am 7
very 7
grateful 7
but 7
indeed 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
inclination 7
to 7
change 7
my 7
state 7
for 7
where 7
could 7
i 7
find 7
so 7
happy 7
a 7
life 7
amidst 7
so 7
many 7
beautiful 7
and 7
delightful 7
surroundings 7
i 7
feel 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
never 7
be 7
as 7
happy 7
with 7
any 7
husband 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
here 7
and 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
not 7
to 7
press 7
one 7
on 7
me 7
at 7
last 7
an 7
embassy 7
came 7
from 7
a 7
king 7
so 7
rich 7
and 7
powerful 7
that 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
china 7
felt 7
constrained 7
to 7
urge 7
this 7
suit 7
on 7
his 7
daughter 7
he 7
told 7
her 7
how 7
important 7
such 7
an 7
alliance 7
would 7
be 7
and 7
pressed 7
her 7
to 7
consent 7
in 7
fact 7
he 7
pressed 7
her 7
so 7
persistingly 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
at 7
length 7
lost 7
her 7
temper 7
and 7
quite 7
forgot 7
the 7
respect 7
due 7
to 7
her 7
father 7
sire 7
cried 7
she 7
angrily 7
do 7
not 7
speak 7
further 7
of 7
this 7
or 7
any 7
other 7
marriage 7
or 7
i 7
will 7
plunge 7
this 7
dagger 7
in 7
my 7
breast 7
and 7
so 7
escape 7
from 7
all 7
these 7
importunities 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
china 7
was 7
extremely 7
indignant 7
with 7
his 7
daughter 7
and 7
replied 7
you 7
have 7
lost 7
your 7
senses 7
and 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
treated 7
accordingly 7
so 7
he 7
had 7
her 7
shut 7
in 7
one 7
set 7
of 7
rooms 7
in 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
palaces 7
and 7
only 7
allowed 7
her 7
ten 7
old 7
women 7
of 7
whom 7
her 7
nurse 7
was 7
the 7
head 7
to 7
wait 7
on 7
her 7
and 7
keep 7
her 7
company 7
he 7
next 7
sent 7
letters 7
to 7
all 7
the 7
kings 7
who 7
had 7
sued 7
for 7
the 7
princesss 7
hand 7
begging 7
they 7
would 7
think 7
of 7
her 7
no 7
longer 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
quite 7
insane 7
and 7
he 7
desired 7
his 7
various 7
envoys 7
to 7
make 7
it 7
known 7
that 7
anyone 7
who 7
could 7
cure 7
her 7
should 7
have 7
her 7
to 7
wife 7
fair 7
maimoune 7
continued 7
danhasch 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
present 7
state 7
of 7
affairs 7
i 7
never 7
pass 7
a 7
day 7
without 7
going 7
to 7
gaze 7
on 7
this 7
incomparable 7
beauty 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
that 7
if 7
you 7
would 7
only 7
accompany 7
me 7
you 7
would 7
think 7
the 7
sight 7
well 7
worth 7
the 7
trouble 7
and 7
own 7
that 7
you 7
never 7
saw 7
such 7
loveliness 7
before 7
the 7
fairy 7
only 7
answered 7
with 7
a 7
peal 7
of 7
laughter 7
and 7
when 7
at 7
length 7
she 7
had 7
control 7
of 7
her 7
voice 7
she 7
cried 7
oh 7
come 7
you 7
are 7
making 7
game 7
of 7
me 7
i 7
thought 7
you 7
had 7
something 7
really 7
interesting 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
instead 7
of 7
raving 7
about 7
some 7
unknown 7
damsel 7
what 7
would 7
you 7
say 7
if 7
you 7
could 7
see 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
been 7
looking 7
at 7
and 7
whose 7
beauty 7
is 7
really 7
transcendent 7
that 7
is 7
something 7
worth 7
talking 7
about 7
you 7
would 7
certainly 7
quite 7
lose 7
your 7
head 7
charming 7
maimoune 7
asked 7
danhasch 7
may 7
i 7
inquire 7
who 7
and 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
whom 7
you 7
speak 7
know 7
replied 7
maimoune 7
that 7
he 7
is 7
in 7
much 7
the 7
same 7
case 7
as 7
your 7
princess 7
the 7
king 7
his 7
father 7
wanted 7
to 7
force 7
him 7
to 7
marry 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
princes 7
refusal 7
to 7
obey 7
he 7
has 7
been 7
imprisoned 7
in 7
an 7
old 7
tower 7
where 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
seen 7
him 7
i 7
dont 7
like 7
to 7
contradict 7
a 7
lady 7
said 7
danhasch 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
really 7
permit 7
me 7
to 7
doubt 7
any 7
mortal 7
being 7
as 7
beautiful 7
as 7
my 7
princess 7
hold 7
your 7
tongue 7
cried 7
maimoune 7
i 7
repeat 7
that 7
is 7
impossible 7
well 7
i 7
dont 7
wish 7
to 7
seem 7
obstinate 7
replied 7
danhasch 7
the 7
best 7
plan 7
to 7
test 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
what 7
i 7
say 7
will 7
be 7
for 7
you 7
to 7
let 7
me 7
take 7
you 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
princess 7
for 7
yourself 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
need 7
for 7
that 7
retorted 7
maimoune 7
we 7
can 7
satisfy 7
ourselves 7
in 7
another 7
way 7
bring 7
your 7
princess 7
here 7
and 7
lay 7
her 7
down 7
beside 7
my 7
prince 7
we 7
can 7
then 7
compare 7
them 7
at 7
leisure 7
and 7
decide 7
which 7
is 7
in 7
the 7
right 7
danhasch 7
readily 7
consented 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
the 7
tower 7
where 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
confined 7
pointed 7
out 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
making 7
a 7
wager 7
with 7
maimoune 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
result 7
of 7
the 7
comparison 7
he 7
flew 7
off 7
to 7
china 7
to 7
fetch 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
an 7
incredibly 7
short 7
time 7
danhasch 7
returned 7
bearing 7
the 7
sleeping 7
princess 7
maimoune 7
led 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
princes 7
room 7
and 7
the 7
rival 7
beauty 7
was 7
placed 7
beside 7
him 7
when 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
princess 7
lay 7
thus 7
side 7
by 7
side 7
an 7
animated 7
dispute 7
as 7
to 7
their 7
respective 7
charms 7
arose 7
between 7
the 7
fairy 7
and 7
the 7
genius 7
danhasch 7
began 7
by 7
saying 7
now 7
you 7
see 7
that 7
my 7
princess 7
is 7
more 7
beautiful 7
than 7
your 7
prince 7
can 7
you 7
doubt 7
any 7
longer 7
doubt 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
do 7
exclaimed 7
maimoune 7
why 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
blind 7
not 7
to 7
see 7
how 7
much 7
my 7
prince 7
excels 7
your 7
princess 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
deny 7
that 7
your 7
princess 7
is 7
very 7
handsome 7
but 7
only 7
look 7
and 7
you 7
must 7
own 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
in 7
the 7
right 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
need 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
look 7
longer 7
said 7
danhasch 7
my 7
first 7
impression 7
will 7
remain 7
the 7
same 7
but 7
of 7
course 7
charming 7
maimoune 7
i 7
am 7
ready 7
to 7
yield 7
to 7
you 7
if 7
you 7
insist 7
on 7
it 7
by 7
no 7
means 7
replied 7
maimoune 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
idea 7
of 7
being 7
under 7
any 7
obligation 7
to 7
an 7
accursed 7
genius 7
like 7
you 7
i 7
refer 7
the 7
matter 7
to 7
an 7
umpire 7
and 7
shall 7
expect 7
you 7
to 7
submit 7
to 7
his 7
verdict 7
danhasch 7
readily 7
agreed 7
and 7
on 7
maimoune 7
striking 7
the 7
floor 7
with 7
her 7
foot 7
it 7
opened 7
and 7
a 7
hideous 7
humpbacked 7
lame 7
squinting 7
genius 7
with 7
six 7
horns 7
on 7
his 7
head 7
hands 7
like 7
claws 7
emerged 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
beheld 7
maimoune 7
he 7
threw 7
himself 7
at 7
her 7
feet 7
and 7
asked 7
her 7
commands 7
rise 7
caschcasch 7
said 7
she 7
i 7
summoned 7
you 7
to 7
judge 7
between 7
me 7
and 7
danhasch 7
glance 7
at 7
that 7
couch 7
and 7
say 7
without 7
any 7
partiality 7
whether 7
you 7
think 7
the 7
youth 7
or 7
the 7
maiden 7
lying 7
there 7
the 7
more 7
beautiful 7
caschcasch 7
looked 7
at 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
princess 7
with 7
every 7
token 7
of 7
surprise 7
and 7
admiration 7
at 7
length 7
having 7
gazed 7
long 7
without 7
being 7
able 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
a 7
decision 7
he 7
said 7
madam 7
i 7
must 7
confess 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
deceive 7
you 7
were 7
i 7
to 7
declare 7
one 7
to 7
be 7
handsomer 7
than 7
the 7
other 7
there 7
seems 7
to 7
me 7
only 7
one 7
way 7
in 7
which 7
to 7
decide 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
that 7
is 7
to 7
wake 7
one 7
after 7
the 7
other 7
and 7
judge 7
which 7
of 7
them 7
expresses 7
the 7
greater 7
admiration 7
for 7
the 7
other 7
this 7
advice 7
pleased 7
maimoune 7
and 7
danhasch 7
and 7
the 7
fairy 7
at 7
once 7
transformed 7
herself 7
into 7
the 7
shape 7
of 7
a 7
gnat 7
and 7
settling 7
on 7
camaralzamans 7
throat 7
stung 7
him 7
so 7
sharply 7
that 7
he 7
awoke 7
as 7
he 7
did 7
so 7
his 7
eyes 7
fell 7
on 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
surprised 7
at 7
finding 7
a 7
lady 7
so 7
near 7
him 7
he 7
raised 7
himself 7
on 7
one 7
arm 7
to 7
look 7
at 7
her 7
the 7
youth 7
and 7
beauty 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
at 7
once 7
awoke 7
a 7
feeling 7
to 7
which 7
his 7
heart 7
had 7
as 7
yet 7
been 7
a 7
stranger 7
and 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
restrain 7
his 7
delight 7
what 7
loveliness 7
what 7
charms 7
oh 7
my 7
heart 7
my 7
soul 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
as 7
he 7
kissed 7
her 7
forehead 7
her 7
eyes 7
and 7
mouth 7
in 7
a 7
way 7
which 7
would 7
certainly 7
have 7
roused 7
her 7
had 7
not 7
the 7
genies 7
enchantments 7
kept 7
her 7
asleep 7
how 7
fair 7
lady 7
he 7
cried 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
wake 7
at 7
the 7
signs 7
of 7
camaralzamans 7
love 7
be 7
you 7
who 7
you 7
may 7
he 7
is 7
not 7
unworthy 7
of 7
you 7
it 7
then 7
suddenly 7
occurred 7
to 7
him 7
that 7
perhaps 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
bride 7
his 7
father 7
had 7
destined 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
king 7
had 7
probably 7
had 7
her 7
placed 7
in 7
this 7
room 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
see 7
how 7
far 7
camaralzamans 7
aversion 7
to 7
marriage 7
would 7
withstand 7
her 7
charms 7
at 7
all 7
events 7
he 7
thought 7
i 7
will 7
take 7
this 7
ring 7
as 7
a 7
remembrance 7
of 7
her 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
drew 7
off 7
a 7
fine 7
ring 7
which 7
the 7
princess 7
wore 7
on 7
her 7
finger 7
and 7
replaced 7
it 7
by 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
after 7
which 7
he 7
lay 7
down 7
again 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
fast 7
asleep 7
then 7
danhasch 7
in 7
his 7
turn 7
took 7
the 7
form 7
of 7
a 7
gnat 7
and 7
bit 7
the 7
princess 7
on 7
her 7
lip 7
she 7
started 7
up 7
and 7
was 7
not 7
a 7
little 7
amazed 7
at 7
seeing 7
a 7
young 7
man 7
beside 7
her 7
from 7
surprise 7
she 7
soon 7
passed 7
to 7
admiration 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
delight 7
on 7
perceiving 7
how 7
handsome 7
and 7
fascinating 7
he 7
was 7
why 7
cried 7
she 7
was 7
it 7
you 7
my 7
father 7
wished 7
me 7
to 7
marry 7
how 7
unlucky 7
that 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
sooner 7
i 7
should 7
not 7
have 7
made 7
him 7
so 7
angry 7
but 7
wake 7
up 7
wake 7
up 7
for 7
i 7
know 7
i 7
shall 7
love 7
you 7
with 7
all 7
my 7
heart 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
shook 7
camaralzaman 7
so 7
violently 7
that 7
nothing 7
but 7
the 7
spells 7
of 7
maimoune 7
could 7
have 7
prevented 7
his 7
waking 7
oh 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
why 7
are 7
you 7
so 7
drowsy 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
took 7
his 7
hand 7
and 7
noticed 7
her 7
own 7
ring 7
on 7
his 7
finger 7
which 7
made 7
her 7
wonder 7
still 7
more 7
but 7
as 7
he 7
still 7
remained 7
in 7
a 7
profound 7
slumber 7
she 7
pressed 7
a 7
kiss 7
on 7
his 7
cheek 7
and 7
soon 7
fell 7
fast 7
asleep 7
too 7
then 7
maimoune 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
genie 7
said 7
well 7
are 7
you 7
satisfied 7
that 7
my 7
prince 7
surpasses 7
your 7
princess 7
another 7
time 7
pray 7
believe 7
me 7
when 7
i 7
assert 7
anything 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
caschcasch 7
my 7
thanks 7
to 7
you 7
and 7
now 7
do 7
you 7
and 7
danhasch 7
bear 7
the 7
princess 7
back 7
to 7
her 7
own 7
home 7
the 7
two 7
genii 7
hastened 7
to 7
obey 7
and 7
maimoune 7
returned 7
to 7
her 7
well 7
on 7
waking 7
next 7
morning 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
look 7
round 7
for 7
the 7
lovely 7
lady 7
he 7
had 7
seen 7
at 7
night 7
and 7
the 7
next 7
to 7
question 7
the 7
slave 7
who 7
waited 7
on 7
him 7
about 7
her 7
but 7
the 7
slave 7
persisted 7
so 7
strongly 7
that 7
he 7
knew 7
nothing 7
of 7
any 7
lady 7
and 7
still 7
less 7
of 7
how 7
she 7
got 7
into 7
the 7
tower 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
lost 7
all 7
patience 7
and 7
after 7
giving 7
him 7
a 7
good 7
beating 7
tied 7
a 7
rope 7
round 7
him 7
and 7
ducked 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
well 7
till 7
the 7
unfortunate 7
man 7
cried 7
out 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
tell 7
everything 7
then 7
the 7
prince 7
drew 7
him 7
up 7
all 7
dripping 7
wet 7
but 7
the 7
slave 7
begged 7
leave 7
to 7
change 7
his 7
clothes 7
first 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
prince 7
consented 7
hurried 7
off 7
just 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
here 7
he 7
found 7
the 7
king 7
talking 7
to 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
anxiety 7
his 7
son 7
had 7
caused 7
him 7
the 7
slave 7
was 7
admitted 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
cried 7
alas 7
sire 7
i 7
bring 7
sad 7
news 7
to 7
your 7
majesty 7
there 7
can 7
be 7
no 7
doubt 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
has 7
completely 7
lost 7
his 7
senses 7
he 7
declares 7
that 7
he 7
saw 7
a 7
lady 7
sleeping 7
on 7
his 7
couch 7
last 7
night 7
and 7
the 7
state 7
you 7
see 7
me 7
in 7
proves 7
how 7
violent 7
contradiction 7
makes 7
him 7
he 7
then 7
gave 7
a 7
minute 7
account 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
prince 7
had 7
said 7
and 7
done 7
the 7
king 7
much 7
moved 7
begged 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
examine 7
into 7
this 7
new 7
misfortune 7
and 7
the 7
latter 7
at 7
once 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
tower 7
where 7
he 7
found 7
the 7
prince 7
quietly 7
reading 7
a 7
book 7
after 7
the 7
first 7
exchange 7
of 7
greetings 7
the 7
vizir 7
said 7
i 7
feel 7
really 7
very 7
angry 7
with 7
your 7
slave 7
for 7
alarming 7
his 7
majesty 7
by 7
the 7
news 7
he 7
brought 7
him 7
what 7
news 7
asked 7
the 7
prince 7
ah 7
replied 7
the 7
vizir 7
something 7
absurd 7
i 7
feel 7
sure 7
seeing 7
how 7
i 7
find 7
you 7
most 7
likely 7
said 7
the 7
prince 7
but 7
now 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
here 7
i 7
am 7
glad 7
of 7
the 7
opportunity 7
to 7
ask 7
you 7
where 7
is 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
slept 7
in 7
this 7
room 7
last 7
night 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
felt 7
beside 7
himself 7
at 7
this 7
question 7
prince 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
how 7
would 7
it 7
be 7
possible 7
for 7
any 7
man 7
much 7
less 7
a 7
woman 7
to 7
enter 7
this 7
room 7
at 7
night 7
without 7
walking 7
over 7
your 7
slave 7
on 7
the 7
threshold 7
pray 7
consider 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
realise 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
been 7
deeply 7
impressed 7
by 7
some 7
dream 7
but 7
the 7
prince 7
angrily 7
insisted 7
on 7
knowing 7
who 7
and 7
where 7
the 7
lady 7
was 7
and 7
was 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
persuaded 7
by 7
all 7
the 7
vizirs 7
protestations 7
to 7
the 7
contrary 7
that 7
the 7
plot 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
making 7
at 7
last 7
losing 7
patience 7
he 7
seized 7
the 7
vizir 7
by 7
the 7
beard 7
and 7
loaded 7
him 7
with 7
blows 7
stop 7
prince 7
cried 7
the 7
unhappy 7
vizir 7
stay 7
and 7
hear 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
to 7
say 7
the 7
prince 7
whose 7
arm 7
was 7
getting 7
tired 7
paused 7
i 7
confess 7
prince 7
said 7
the 7
vizir 7
that 7
there 7
is 7
some 7
foundation 7
for 7
what 7
you 7
say 7
but 7
you 7
know 7
well 7
that 7
a 7
minister 7
has 7
to 7
carry 7
out 7
his 7
masters 7
orders 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
go 7
and 7
to 7
take 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
any 7
message 7
you 7
may 7
choose 7
to 7
send 7
very 7
well 7
said 7
the 7
prince 7
then 7
go 7
and 7
tell 7
him 7
that 7
i 7
consent 7
to 7
marry 7
the 7
lady 7
whom 7
he 7
sent 7
or 7
brought 7
here 7
last 7
night 7
be 7
quick 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
back 7
his 7
answer 7
the 7
vizir 7
bowed 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
and 7
hastened 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
tower 7
well 7
asked 7
the 7
king 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
appeared 7
and 7
how 7
did 7
you 7
find 7
my 7
son 7
alas 7
sire 7
was 7
the 7
reply 7
the 7
slaves 7
report 7
is 7
only 7
too 7
true 7
he 7
then 7
gave 7
an 7
exact 7
account 7
of 7
his 7
interview 7
with 7
camaralzaman 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
princes 7
fury 7
when 7
told 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
possible 7
for 7
any 7
lady 7
to 7
have 7
entered 7
his 7
room 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
treatment 7
he 7
himself 7
had 7
received 7
the 7
king 7
much 7
distressed 7
determined 7
to 7
clear 7
up 7
the 7
matter 7
himself 7
and 7
ordering 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
follow 7
him 7
set 7
out 7
to 7
visit 7
his 7
son 7
the 7
prince 7
received 7
his 7
father 7
with 7
profound 7
respect 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
making 7
him 7
sit 7
beside 7
him 7
asked 7
him 7
several 7
questions 7
to 7
which 7
camaralzaman 7
replied 7
with 7
much 7
good 7
sense 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
king 7
said 7
my 7
son 7
pray 7
tell 7
me 7
about 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
it 7
is 7
said 7
was 7
in 7
your 7
room 7
last 7
night 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
prince 7
pray 7
do 7
not 7
increase 7
my 7
distress 7
in 7
this 7
matter 7
but 7
rather 7
make 7
me 7
happy 7
by 7
giving 7
her 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
marriage 7
however 7
much 7
i 7
may 7
have 7
objected 7
to 7
matrimony 7
formerly 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
this 7
lovely 7
girl 7
has 7
overcome 7
all 7
my 7
prejudices 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
gratefully 7
receive 7
her 7
from 7
your 7
hands 7
the 7
king 7
was 7
almost 7
speechless 7
on 7
hearing 7
his 7
son 7
but 7
after 7
a 7
time 7
assured 7
him 7
most 7
solemnly 7
that 7
he 7
knew 7
nothing 7
whatever 7
about 7
the 7
lady 7
in 7
question 7
and 7
had 7
not 7
connived 7
at 7
her 7
appearance 7
he 7
then 7
desired 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
relate 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
to 7
him 7
camaralzaman 7
did 7
so 7
at 7
great 7
length 7
showed 7
the 7
ring 7
and 7
implored 7
his 7
father 7
to 7
help 7
to 7
find 7
the 7
bride 7
he 7
so 7
ardently 7
desired 7
after 7
all 7
you 7
tell 7
me 7
remarked 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
can 7
no 7
longer 7
doubt 7
your 7
word 7
but 7
how 7
and 7
whence 7
the 7
lady 7
came 7
or 7
why 7
she 7
should 7
have 7
stayed 7
so 7
short 7
a 7
time 7
i 7
cannot 7
imagine 7
the 7
whole 7
affair 7
is 7
indeed 7
mysterious 7
come 7
my 7
dear 7
son 7
let 7
us 7
wait 7
together 7
for 7
happier 7
days 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
king 7
took 7
camaralzaman 7
by 7
the 7
hand 7
and 7
led 7
him 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
the 7
prince 7
took 7
to 7
his 7
bed 7
and 7
gave 7
himself 7
up 7
to 7
despair 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
shutting 7
himself 7
up 7
with 7
his 7
son 7
entirely 7
neglected 7
the 7
affairs 7
of 7
state 7
the 7
prime 7
minister 7
who 7
was 7
the 7
only 7
person 7
admitted 7
felt 7
it 7
his 7
duty 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
tell 7
the 7
king 7
how 7
much 7
the 7
court 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
people 7
complained 7
of 7
his 7
seclusion 7
and 7
how 7
bad 7
it 7
was 7
for 7
the 7
nation 7
he 7
urged 7
the 7
sultan 7
to 7
remove 7
with 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
a 7
lovely 7
little 7
island 7
close 7
by 7
whence 7
he 7
could 7
easily 7
attend 7
public 7
audiences 7
and 7
where 7
the 7
charming 7
scenery 7
and 7
fine 7
air 7
would 7
do 7
the 7
invalid 7
so 7
much 7
good 7
as 7
to 7
enable 7
him 7
to 7
bear 7
his 7
fathers 7
occasional 7
absence 7
the 7
king 7
approved 7
the 7
plan 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
castle 7
on 7
the 7
island 7
could 7
be 7
prepared 7
for 7
their 7
reception 7
he 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
arrived 7
there 7
schahzaman 7
never 7
leaving 7
his 7
son 7
except 7
for 7
the 7
prescribed 7
public 7
audiences 7
twice 7
a 7
week 7
whilst 7
all 7
this 7
was 7
happening 7
in 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
schahzaman 7
the 7
two 7
genii 7
had 7
carefully 7
borne 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
back 7
to 7
her 7
own 7
palace 7
and 7
replaced 7
her 7
in 7
bed 7
on 7
waking 7
next 7
morning 7
she 7
first 7
turned 7
from 7
one 7
side 7
to 7
another 7
and 7
then 7
finding 7
herself 7
alone 7
called 7
loudly 7
for 7
her 7
women 7
tell 7
me 7
she 7
cried 7
where 7
is 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
i 7
love 7
so 7
dearly 7
and 7
who 7
slept 7
near 7
me 7
last 7
night 7
princess 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
nurse 7
we 7
cannot 7
tell 7
what 7
you 7
allude 7
to 7
without 7
more 7
explanation 7
why 7
continued 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
most 7
charming 7
and 7
beautiful 7
young 7
man 7
lay 7
sleeping 7
beside 7
me 7
last 7
night 7
i 7
did 7
my 7
utmost 7
to 7
wake 7
him 7
but 7
in 7
vain 7
your 7
royal 7
highness 7
wishes 7
to 7
make 7
game 7
of 7
us 7
said 7
the 7
nurse 7
is 7
it 7
your 7
pleasure 7
to 7
rise 7
i 7
am 7
quite 7
in 7
earnest 7
persisted 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
i 7
want 7
to 7
know 7
where 7
he 7
is 7
but 7
princess 7
expostulated 7
the 7
nurse 7
we 7
left 7
you 7
quite 7
alone 7
last 7
night 7
and 7
we 7
have 7
seen 7
no 7
one 7
enter 7
your 7
room 7
since 7
then 7
at 7
this 7
the 7
princess 7
lost 7
all 7
patience 7
and 7
taking 7
the 7
nurse 7
by 7
her 7
hair 7
she 7
boxed 7
her 7
ears 7
soundly 7
crying 7
out 7
you 7
shall 7
tell 7
me 7
you 7
old 7
witch 7
or 7
ill 7
kill 7
you 7
the 7
nurse 7
had 7
no 7
little 7
trouble 7
in 7
escaping 7
and 7
hurried 7
off 7
to 7
the 7
queen 7
to 7
whom 7
she 7
related 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
with 7
tears 7
in 7
her 7
eyes 7
you 7
see 7
madam 7
she 7
concluded 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
must 7
be 7
out 7
of 7
her 7
mind 7
if 7
only 7
you 7
will 7
come 7
and 7
see 7
her 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
judge 7
for 7
yourself 7
the 7
queen 7
hurried 7
to 7
her 7
daughters 7
apartments 7
and 7
after 7
tenderly 7
embracing 7
her 7
asked 7
her 7
why 7
she 7
had 7
treated 7
her 7
nurse 7
so 7
badly 7
madam 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
perceive 7
that 7
your 7
majesty 7
wishes 7
to 7
make 7
game 7
of 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
can 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
never 7
marry 7
anyone 7
except 7
the 7
charming 7
young 7
man 7
whom 7
i 7
saw 7
last 7
night 7
you 7
must 7
know 7
where 7
he 7
is 7
so 7
pray 7
send 7
for 7
him 7
the 7
queen 7
was 7
much 7
surprised 7
by 7
these 7
words 7
but 7
when 7
she 7
declared 7
that 7
she 7
knew 7
nothing 7
whatever 7
of 7
the 7
matter 7
the 7
princess 7
lost 7
all 7
respect 7
and 7
answered 7
that 7
if 7
she 7
were 7
not 7
allowed 7
to 7
marry 7
as 7
she 7
wished 7
she 7
should 7
kill 7
herself 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
in 7
vain 7
that 7
the 7
queen 7
tried 7
to 7
pacify 7
her 7
and 7
bring 7
her 7
to 7
reason 7
the 7
king 7
himself 7
came 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
rights 7
of 7
the 7
matter 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
only 7
persisted 7
in 7
her 7
story 7
and 7
as 7
a 7
proof 7
showed 7
the 7
ring 7
on 7
her 7
finger 7
the 7
king 7
hardly 7
knew 7
what 7
to 7
make 7
of 7
it 7
all 7
but 7
ended 7
by 7
thinking 7
that 7
his 7
daughter 7
was 7
more 7
crazy 7
than 7
ever 7
and 7
without 7
further 7
argument 7
he 7
had 7
her 7
placed 7
in 7
still 7
closer 7
confinement 7
with 7
only 7
her 7
nurse 7
to 7
wait 7
on 7
her 7
and 7
a 7
powerful 7
guard 7
to 7
keep 7
the 7
door 7
then 7
he 7
assembled 7
his 7
council 7
and 7
having 7
told 7
them 7
the 7
sad 7
state 7
of 7
things 7
added 7
if 7
any 7
of 7
you 7
can 7
succeed 7
in 7
curing 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
her 7
to 7
him 7
in 7
marriage 7
and 7
he 7
shall 7
be 7
my 7
heir 7
an 7
elderly 7
emir 7
present 7
fired 7
with 7
the 7
desire 7
to 7
possess 7
a 7
young 7
and 7
lovely 7
wife 7
and 7
to 7
rule 7
over 7
a 7
great 7
kingdom 7
offered 7
to 7
try 7
the 7
magic 7
arts 7
with 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
acquainted 7
you 7
are 7
welcome 7
to 7
try 7
said 7
the 7
king 7
but 7
i 7
make 7
one 7
condition 7
which 7
is 7
that 7
should 7
you 7
fail 7
you 7
will 7
lose 7
your 7
life 7
the 7
emir 7
accepted 7
the 7
condition 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
led 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
veiling 7
her 7
face 7
remarked 7
i 7
am 7
surprised 7
sire 7
that 7
you 7
should 7
bring 7
an 7
unknown 7
man 7
into 7
my 7
presence 7
you 7
need 7
not 7
be 7
shocked 7
said 7
the 7
king 7
this 7
is 7
one 7
of 7
my 7
emirs 7
who 7
asks 7
your 7
hand 7
in 7
marriage 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
this 7
is 7
not 7
the 7
one 7
you 7
gave 7
me 7
before 7
and 7
whose 7
ring 7
i 7
wear 7
permit 7
me 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
can 7
accept 7
no 7
other 7
the 7
emir 7
who 7
had 7
expected 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
princess 7
talk 7
nonsense 7
finding 7
how 7
calm 7
and 7
reasonable 7
she 7
was 7
assured 7
the 7
king 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
venture 7
to 7
undertake 7
a 7
cure 7
but 7
placed 7
his 7
head 7
at 7
his 7
majestys 7
disposal 7
on 7
which 7
the 7
justly 7
irritated 7
monarch 7
promptly 7
had 7
it 7
cut 7
off 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
first 7
of 7
many 7
suitors 7
for 7
the 7
princess 7
whose 7
inability 7
to 7
cure 7
her 7
cost 7
them 7
their 7
lives 7
now 7
it 7
happened 7
that 7
after 7
things 7
had 7
been 7
going 7
on 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
the 7
nurses 7
son 7
marzavan 7
returned 7
from 7
his 7
travels 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
in 7
many 7
countries 7
and 7
learnt 7
many 7
things 7
including 7
astrology 7
needless 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
things 7
his 7
mother 7
told 7
him 7
was 7
the 7
sad 7
condition 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
his 7
fostersister 7
marzavan 7
asked 7
if 7
she 7
could 7
not 7
manage 7
to 7
let 7
him 7
see 7
the 7
princess 7
without 7
the 7
kings 7
knowledge 7
after 7
some 7
consideration 7
his 7
mother 7
consented 7
and 7
even 7
persuaded 7
the 7
eunuch 7
on 7
guard 7
to 7
make 7
no 7
objection 7
to 7
marzavans 7
entering 7
the 7
royal 7
apartment 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
fosterbrother 7
again 7
and 7
after 7
some 7
conversation 7
she 7
confided 7
to 7
him 7
all 7
her 7
history 7
and 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
her 7
imprisonment 7
marzavan 7
listened 7
with 7
downcast 7
eyes 7
and 7
the 7
utmost 7
attention 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
finished 7
speaking 7
he 7
said 7
if 7
what 7
you 7
tell 7
me 7
princess 7
is 7
indeed 7
the 7
case 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
despair 7
of 7
finding 7
comfort 7
for 7
you 7
take 7
patience 7
yet 7
a 7
little 7
longer 7
i 7
will 7
set 7
out 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
explore 7
other 7
countries 7
and 7
when 7
you 7
hear 7
of 7
my 7
return 7
be 7
sure 7
that 7
he 7
for 7
whom 7
you 7
sigh 7
is 7
not 7
far 7
off 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
took 7
his 7
leave 7
and 7
started 7
next 7
morning 7
on 7
his 7
travels 7
marzavan 7
journeyed 7
from 7
city 7
to 7
city 7
and 7
from 7
one 7
island 7
and 7
province 7
to 7
another 7
and 7
wherever 7
he 7
went 7
he 7
heard 7
people 7
talk 7
of 7
the 7
strange 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
as 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
was 7
named 7
after 7
four 7
months 7
he 7
reached 7
a 7
large 7
populous 7
seaport 7
town 7
named 7
torf 7
and 7
here 7
he 7
heard 7
no 7
more 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
but 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
who 7
was 7
reported 7
ill 7
and 7
whose 7
story 7
sounded 7
very 7
similar 7
to 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
marzavan 7
was 7
rejoiced 7
and 7
set 7
out 7
at 7
once 7
for 7
prince 7
camaralzamans 7
residence 7
the 7
ship 7
on 7
which 7
he 7
embarked 7
had 7
a 7
prosperous 7
voyage 7
till 7
she 7
got 7
within 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
king 7
schahzaman 7
but 7
when 7
just 7
about 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
harbour 7
she 7
suddenly 7
struck 7
on 7
a 7
rock 7
and 7
foundered 7
within 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
living 7
with 7
his 7
father 7
and 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
marzavan 7
who 7
swam 7
well 7
threw 7
himself 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
managed 7
to 7
land 7
close 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
kindly 7
received 7
and 7
after 7
having 7
a 7
change 7
of 7
clothing 7
given 7
him 7
was 7
brought 7
before 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
the 7
vizir 7
was 7
at 7
once 7
attracted 7
by 7
the 7
young 7
mans 7
superior 7
air 7
and 7
intelligent 7
conversation 7
and 7
perceiving 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
gained 7
much 7
experience 7
in 7
the 7
course 7
of 7
his 7
travels 7
he 7
said 7
ah 7
how 7
i 7
wish 7
you 7
had 7
learnt 7
some 7
secret 7
which 7
might 7
enable 7
you 7
to 7
cure 7
a 7
malady 7
which 7
has 7
plunged 7
this 7
court 7
into 7
affliction 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
past 7
marzavan 7
replied 7
that 7
if 7
he 7
knew 7
what 7
the 7
illness 7
was 7
he 7
might 7
possibly 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
suggest 7
a 7
remedy 7
on 7
which 7
the 7
vizir 7
related 7
to 7
him 7
the 7
whole 7
history 7
of 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
on 7
hearing 7
this 7
marzavan 7
rejoiced 7
inwardly 7
for 7
he 7
felt 7
sure 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
at 7
last 7
discovered 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badouras 7
infatuation 7
however 7
he 7
said 7
nothing 7
but 7
begged 7
to 7
be 7
allowed 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
prince 7
on 7
entering 7
the 7
royal 7
apartment 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
which 7
struck 7
him 7
was 7
the 7
prince 7
himself 7
who 7
lay 7
stretched 7
out 7
on 7
his 7
bed 7
with 7
his 7
eyes 7
closed 7
the 7
king 7
sat 7
near 7
him 7
but 7
without 7
paying 7
any 7
regard 7
to 7
his 7
presence 7
marzavan 7
exclaimed 7
heavens 7
what 7
a 7
striking 7
likeness 7
and 7
indeed 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
good 7
deal 7
of 7
resemblance 7
between 7
the 7
features 7
of 7
camaralzaman 7
and 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
these 7
words 7
caused 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
open 7
his 7
eyes 7
with 7
languid 7
curiosity 7
and 7
marzavan 7
seized 7
this 7
moment 7
to 7
pay 7
him 7
his 7
compliments 7
contriving 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
to 7
express 7
the 7
condition 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
in 7
terms 7
unintelligible 7
indeed 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
his 7
vizir 7
but 7
which 7
left 7
the 7
prince 7
in 7
no 7
doubt 7
that 7
his 7
visitor 7
could 7
give 7
him 7
some 7
welcome 7
information 7
the 7
prince 7
begged 7
his 7
father 7
to 7
allow 7
him 7
the 7
favour 7
of 7
a 7
private 7
interview 7
with 7
marzavan 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
was 7
only 7
too 7
pleased 7
to 7
find 7
his 7
son 7
taking 7
an 7
interest 7
in 7
anyone 7
or 7
anything 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
left 7
alone 7
marzavan 7
told 7
the 7
prince 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
and 7
her 7
sufferings 7
adding 7
i 7
am 7
convinced 7
that 7
you 7
alone 7
can 7
cure 7
her 7
but 7
before 7
starting 7
on 7
so 7
long 7
a 7
journey 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
well 7
and 7
strong 7
so 7
do 7
your 7
best 7
to 7
recover 7
as 7
quickly 7
as 7
may 7
be 7
these 7
words 7
produced 7
a 7
great 7
effect 7
on 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
cheered 7
by 7
the 7
hopes 7
held 7
out 7
that 7
he 7
declared 7
he 7
felt 7
able 7
to 7
get 7
up 7
and 7
be 7
dressed 7
the 7
king 7
was 7
overjoyed 7
at 7
the 7
result 7
of 7
marzavans 7
interview 7
and 7
ordered 7
public 7
rejoicings 7
in 7
honour 7
of 7
the 7
princes 7
recovery 7
before 7
long 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
quite 7
restored 7
to 7
his 7
original 7
state 7
of 7
health 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
felt 7
himself 7
really 7
strong 7
he 7
took 7
marzavan 7
aside 7
and 7
said 7
now 7
is 7
the 7
time 7
to 7
perform 7
your 7
promise 7
i 7
am 7
so 7
impatient 7
to 7
see 7
my 7
beloved 7
princess 7
once 7
more 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
i 7
shall 7
fall 7
ill 7
again 7
if 7
we 7
do 7
not 7
start 7
soon 7
the 7
one 7
obstacle 7
is 7
my 7
fathers 7
tender 7
care 7
of 7
me 7
for 7
as 7
you 7
may 7
have 7
noticed 7
he 7
cannot 7
bear 7
me 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
sight 7
prince 7
replied 7
marzavan 7
i 7
have 7
already 7
thought 7
over 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
this 7
is 7
what 7
seems 7
to 7
me 7
the 7
best 7
plan 7
you 7
have 7
not 7
been 7
out 7
of 7
doors 7
since 7
my 7
arrival 7
ask 7
the 7
kings 7
permission 7
to 7
go 7
with 7
me 7
for 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
days 7
hunting 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
has 7
given 7
leave 7
order 7
two 7
good 7
horses 7
to 7
be 7
held 7
ready 7
for 7
each 7
of 7
us 7
leave 7
all 7
the 7
rest 7
to 7
me 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
prince 7
seized 7
a 7
favourable 7
opportunity 7
for 7
making 7
his 7
request 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
gladly 7
granted 7
it 7
on 7
condition 7
that 7
only 7
one 7
night 7
should 7
be 7
spent 7
out 7
for 7
fear 7
of 7
too 7
great 7
fatigue 7
after 7
such 7
a 7
long 7
illness 7
next 7
morning 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
and 7
marzavan 7
were 7
off 7
betimes 7
attended 7
by 7
two 7
grooms 7
leading 7
the 7
two 7
extra 7
horses 7
they 7
hunted 7
a 7
little 7
by 7
the 7
way 7
but 7
took 7
care 7
to 7
get 7
as 7
far 7
from 7
the 7
towns 7
as 7
possible 7
at 7
nightfall 7
they 7
reached 7
an 7
inn 7
where 7
they 7
supped 7
and 7
slept 7
till 7
midnight 7
then 7
marzavan 7
awoke 7
and 7
roused 7
the 7
prince 7
without 7
disturbing 7
anyone 7
else 7
he 7
begged 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
give 7
him 7
the 7
coat 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
wearing 7
and 7
to 7
put 7
on 7
another 7
which 7
they 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
them 7
they 7
mounted 7
their 7
second 7
horses 7
and 7
marzavan 7
led 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
grooms 7
horses 7
by 7
the 7
bridle 7
by 7
daybreak 7
our 7
travellers 7
found 7
themselves 7
where 7
four 7
cross 7
roads 7
met 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
forest 7
here 7
marzavan 7
begged 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
wait 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
leading 7
the 7
grooms 7
horse 7
into 7
a 7
dense 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
wood 7
he 7
cut 7
its 7
throat 7
dipped 7
the 7
princes 7
coat 7
in 7
its 7
blood 7
and 7
having 7
rejoined 7
the 7
prince 7
threw 7
the 7
coat 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
where 7
the 7
roads 7
parted 7
in 7
answer 7
to 7
camaralzamans 7
inquiries 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
reason 7
for 7
this 7
marzavan 7
replied 7
that 7
the 7
only 7
chance 7
they 7
had 7
of 7
continuing 7
their 7
journey 7
was 7
to 7
divert 7
attention 7
by 7
creating 7
the 7
idea 7
of 7
the 7
princes 7
death 7
your 7
father 7
will 7
doubtless 7
be 7
plunged 7
in 7
the 7
deepest 7
grief 7
he 7
went 7
on 7
but 7
his 7
joy 7
at 7
your 7
return 7
will 7
be 7
all 7
the 7
greater 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
his 7
companion 7
now 7
continued 7
their 7
journey 7
by 7
land 7
and 7
sea 7
and 7
as 7
they 7
had 7
brought 7
plenty 7
of 7
money 7
to 7
defray 7
their 7
expenses 7
they 7
met 7
with 7
no 7
needless 7
delays 7
at 7
length 7
they 7
reached 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
china 7
where 7
they 7
spent 7
three 7
days 7
in 7
a 7
suitable 7
lodging 7
to 7
recover 7
from 7
their 7
fatigues 7
during 7
this 7
time 7
marzavan 7
had 7
an 7
astrologers 7
dress 7
prepared 7
for 7
the 7
prince 7
they 7
then 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
baths 7
after 7
which 7
the 7
prince 7
put 7
on 7
the 7
astrologers 7
robe 7
and 7
was 7
conducted 7
within 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
palace 7
by 7
marzavan 7
who 7
left 7
him 7
there 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
consult 7
his 7
mother 7
the 7
princesss 7
nurse 7
meantime 7
the 7
prince 7
according 7
to 7
marzavans 7
instructions 7
advanced 7
close 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
gates 7
and 7
there 7
proclaimed 7
aloud 7
i 7
am 7
an 7
astrologer 7
and 7
i 7
come 7
to 7
restore 7
health 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
daughter 7
of 7
the 7
high 7
and 7
mighty 7
king 7
of 7
china 7
on 7
the 7
conditions 7
laid 7
down 7
by 7
his 7
majesty 7
of 7
marrying 7
her 7
should 7
i 7
succeed 7
or 7
of 7
losing 7
my 7
life 7
if 7
i 7
fail 7
it 7
was 7
some 7
little 7
time 7
since 7
anyone 7
had 7
presented 7
himself 7
to 7
run 7
the 7
terrible 7
risk 7
involved 7
in 7
attempting 7
to 7
cure 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
a 7
crowd 7
soon 7
gathered 7
round 7
the 7
prince 7
on 7
perceiving 7
his 7
youth 7
good 7
looks 7
and 7
distinguished 7
bearing 7
everyone 7
felt 7
pity 7
for 7
him 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
thinking 7
of 7
sir 7
exclaimed 7
some 7
why 7
expose 7
yourself 7
to 7
certain 7
death 7
are 7
not 7
the 7
heads 7
you 7
see 7
exposed 7
on 7
the 7
town 7
wall 7
sufficient 7
warning 7
for 7
mercys 7
sake 7
give 7
up 7
this 7
mad 7
idea 7
and 7
retire 7
whilst 7
you 7
can 7
but 7
the 7
prince 7
remained 7
firm 7
and 7
only 7
repeated 7
his 7
cry 7
with 7
greater 7
assurance 7
to 7
the 7
horror 7
of 7
the 7
crowd 7
he 7
is 7
resolved 7
to 7
die 7
they 7
cried 7
may 7
heaven 7
have 7
pity 7
on 7
him 7
camaralzaman 7
now 7
called 7
out 7
for 7
the 7
third 7
time 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
himself 7
came 7
out 7
and 7
fetched 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
prime 7
minister 7
led 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
who 7
was 7
much 7
struck 7
by 7
the 7
noble 7
air 7
of 7
this 7
new 7
adventurer 7
and 7
felt 7
such 7
pity 7
for 7
the 7
fate 7
so 7
evidently 7
in 7
store 7
for 7
him 7
that 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
persuade 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
to 7
renounce 7
his 7
project 7
but 7
camaralzaman 7
politely 7
yet 7
firmly 7
persisted 7
in 7
his 7
intentions 7
and 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
king 7
desired 7
the 7
eunuch 7
who 7
had 7
the 7
guard 7
of 7
the 7
princesss 7
apartments 7
to 7
conduct 7
the 7
astrologer 7
to 7
her 7
presence 7
the 7
eunuch 7
led 7
the 7
way 7
through 7
long 7
passages 7
and 7
camaralzaman 7
followed 7
rapidly 7
in 7
haste 7
to 7
reach 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
his 7
desires 7
at 7
last 7
they 7
came 7
to 7
a 7
large 7
hall 7
which 7
was 7
the 7
anteroom 7
to 7
the 7
princesss 7
chamber 7
and 7
here 7
camaralzaman 7
said 7

the 7
eunuch 7

i 7
cure 7
the 7

in 7
her 7
own 7
presence 7
or 7
shall 7
i 7
do 7
it 7
from 7
here 7
without 7
seeing 7
her 7
the 7
eunuch 7
who 7
had 7
expressed 7
many 7
contemptuous 7
doubts 7
as 7
they 7
came 7
along 7
of 7
the 7
newcomers 7
powers 7
was 7
much 7
surprised 7
and 7
said 7
if 7
you 7
really 7
can 7
cure 7
it 7
is 7
immaterial 7
when 7
you 7
do 7
it 7
your 7
fame 7
will 7
be 7
equally 7
great 7
very 7
well 7
replied 7
the 7
prince 7
then 7
impatient 7
though 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
will 7
effect 7
the 7
cure 7
where 7
i 7
stand 7
the 7
better 7
to 7
convince 7
you 7
of 7
my 7
power 7
he 7
accordingly 7
drew 7
out 7
his 7
writing 7
case 7
and 7
wrote 7
as 7
followsadorable 7
princess 7
the 7
enamoured 7
camaralzaman 7
has 7
never 7
forgotten 7
the 7
moment 7
when 7
contemplating 7
your 7
sleeping 7
beauty 7
he 7
gave 7
you 7
his 7
heart 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
at 7
that 7
time 7
deprived 7
of 7
the 7
happiness 7
of 7
conversing 7
with 7
you 7
he 7
ventured 7
to 7
give 7
you 7
his 7
ring 7
as 7
a 7
token 7
of 7
his 7
love 7
and 7
to 7
take 7
yours 7
in 7
exchange 7
which 7
he 7
now 7
encloses 7
in 7
this 7
letter 7
should 7
you 7
deign 7
to 7
return 7
it 7
to 7
him 7
he 7
will 7
be 7
the 7
happiest 7
of 7
mortals 7
if 7
not 7
he 7
will 7
cheerfully 7
resign 7
himself 7
to 7
death 7
seeing 7
he 7
does 7
so 7
for 7
love 7
of 7
you 7
he 7
awaits 7
your 7
reply 7
in 7
your 7
anteroom 7
having 7
finished 7
this 7
note 7
the 7
prince 7
carefully 7
enclosed 7
the 7
ring 7
in 7
it 7
without 7
letting 7
the 7
eunuch 7
see 7
it 7
and 7
gave 7
him 7
the 7
letter 7
saying 7
take 7
this 7
to 7
your 7
mistress 7
my 7
friend 7
and 7
if 7
on 7
reading 7
it 7
and 7
seeing 7
its 7
contents 7
she 7
is 7
not 7
instantly 7
cured 7
you 7
may 7
call 7
me 7
an 7
impudent 7
impostor 7
the 7
eunuch 7
at 7
once 7
passed 7
into 7
the 7
princesss 7
room 7
and 7
handing 7
her 7
the 7
letter 7
said 7
madam 7
a 7
new 7
astrologer 7
has 7
arrived 7
who 7
declares 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
cured 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
you 7
have 7
read 7
this 7
letter 7
and 7
seen 7
what 7
it 7
contains 7
the 7
princess 7
took 7
the 7
note 7
and 7
opened 7
it 7
with 7
languid 7
indifference 7
but 7
no 7
sooner 7
did 7
she 7
see 7
her 7
ring 7
than 7
barely 7
glancing 7
at 7
the 7
writing 7
she 7
rose 7
hastily 7
and 7
with 7
one 7
bound 7
reached 7
the 7
doorway 7
and 7
pushed 7
back 7
the 7
hangings 7
here 7
she 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
recognised 7
each 7
other 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
moment 7
they 7
were 7
locked 7
in 7
each 7
others 7
arms 7
where 7
they 7
tenderly 7
embraced 7
wondering 7
how 7
they 7
came 7
to 7
meet 7
at 7
last 7
after 7
so 7
long 7
a 7
separation 7
the 7
nurse 7
who 7
had 7
hastened 7
after 7
her 7
charge 7
drew 7
them 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
inner 7
room 7
where 7
the 7
princess 7
restored 7
her 7
ring 7
to 7
camaralzaman 7
take 7
it 7
back 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
keep 7
it 7
without 7
returning 7
yours 7
to 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
resolved 7
to 7
wear 7
that 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
i 7
live 7
meantime 7
the 7
eunuch 7
had 7
hastened 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
sire 7
he 7
cried 7
all 7
the 7
former 7
doctors 7
and 7
astrologers 7
were 7
mere 7
quacks 7
this 7
man 7
has 7
cured 7
the 7
princess 7
without 7
even 7
seeing 7
her 7
he 7
then 7
told 7
all 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
who 7
overjoyed 7
hastened 7
to 7
his 7
daughters 7
apartments 7
where 7
after 7
embracing 7
her 7
he 7
placed 7
her 7
hand 7
in 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
saying 7
happy 7
stranger 7
i 7
keep 7
my 7
promise 7
and 7
give 7
you 7
my 7
daughter 7
to 7
wife 7
be 7
you 7
who 7
you 7
may 7
but 7
if 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
much 7
mistaken 7
your 7
condition 7
is 7
above 7
what 7
you 7
appear 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
prince 7
thanked 7
the 7
king 7
in 7
the 7
warmest 7
and 7
most 7
respectful 7
terms 7
and 7
added 7
as 7
regards 7
my 7
person 7
your 7
majesty 7
has 7
rightly 7
guessed 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
an 7
astrologer 7
it 7
is 7
but 7
a 7
disguise 7
which 7
i 7
assumed 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
merit 7
your 7
illustrious 7
alliance 7
i 7
am 7
myself 7
a 7
prince 7
my 7
name 7
is 7
camaralzaman 7
and 7
my 7
father 7
is 7
schahzaman 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
isles 7
of 7
the 7
children 7
of 7
khaledan 7
he 7
then 7
told 7
his 7
whole 7
history 7
including 7
the 7
extraordinary 7
manner 7
of 7
his 7
first 7
seeing 7
and 7
loving 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
the 7
king 7
exclaimed 7
so 7
remarkable 7
a 7
story 7
must 7
not 7
be 7
lost 7
to 7
posterity 7
it 7
shall 7
be 7
inscribed 7
in 7
the 7
archives 7
of 7
my 7
kingdom 7
and 7
published 7
everywhere 7
abroad 7
the 7
wedding 7
took 7
place 7
next 7
day 7
amidst 7
great 7
pomp 7
and 7
rejoicings 7
marzavan 7
was 7
not 7
forgotten 7
but 7
was 7
given 7
a 7
lucrative 7
post 7
at 7
court 7
with 7
a 7
promise 7
of 7
further 7
advancement 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
princess 7
were 7
now 7
entirely 7
happy 7
and 7
months 7
slipped 7
by 7
unconsciously 7
in 7
the 7
enjoyment 7
of 7
each 7
others 7
society 7
one 7
night 7
however 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
dreamt 7
that 7
he 7
saw 7
his 7
father 7
lying 7
at 7
the 7
point 7
of 7
death 7
and 7
saying 7
alas 7
my 7
son 7
whom 7
i 7
loved 7
so 7
tenderly 7
has 7
deserted 7
me 7
and 7
is 7
now 7
causing 7
my 7
death 7
the 7
prince 7
woke 7
with 7
such 7
a 7
groan 7
as 7
to 7
startle 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
asked 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
ah 7
cried 7
the 7
prince 7
at 7
this 7
very 7
moment 7
my 7
father 7
is 7
perhaps 7
no 7
more 7
and 7
he 7
told 7
his 7
dream 7
the 7
princess 7
said 7
but 7
little 7
at 7
the 7
time 7
but 7
next 7
morning 7
she 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
kissing 7
his 7
hand 7
said 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
favour 7
to 7
ask 7
of 7
your 7
majesty 7
and 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
to 7
believe 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
in 7
no 7
way 7
prompted 7
by 7
my 7
husband 7
it 7
is 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
allow 7
us 7
both 7
to 7
visit 7
my 7
fatherinlaw 7
king 7
schahzaman 7
sorry 7
though 7
the 7
king 7
felt 7
at 7
the 7
idea 7
of 7
parting 7
with 7
his 7
daughter 7
he 7
felt 7
her 7
request 7
to 7
be 7
so 7
reasonable 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
refuse 7
it 7
and 7
made 7
but 7
one 7
condition 7
which 7
was 7
that 7
she 7
should 7
only 7
spend 7
one 7
year 7
at 7
the 7
court 7
of 7
king 7
schahzaman 7
suggesting 7
that 7
in 7
future 7
the 7
young 7
couple 7
should 7
visit 7
their 7
respective 7
parents 7
alternately 7
the 7
princess 7
brought 7
this 7
good 7
news 7
to 7
her 7
husband 7
who 7
thanked 7
her 7
tenderly 7
for 7
this 7
fresh 7
proof 7
of 7
her 7
affection 7
all 7
preparations 7
for 7
the 7
journey 7
were 7
now 7
pressed 7
forwards 7
and 7
when 7
all 7
was 7
ready 7
the 7
king 7
accompanied 7
the 7
travellers 7
for 7
some 7
days 7
after 7
which 7
he 7
took 7
an 7
affectionate 7
leave 7
of 7
his 7
daughter 7
and 7
charging 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
take 7
every 7
care 7
of 7
her 7
returned 7
to 7
his 7
capital 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
princess 7
journeyed 7
on 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
a 7
month 7
reached 7
a 7
huge 7
meadow 7
interspersed 7
with 7
clumps 7
of 7
big 7
trees 7
which 7
cast 7
a 7
most 7
pleasant 7
shade 7
as 7
the 7
heat 7
was 7
great 7
camaralzaman 7
thought 7
it 7
well 7
to 7
encamp 7
in 7
this 7
cool 7
spot 7
accordingly 7
the 7
tents 7
were 7
pitched 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
entering 7
hers 7
whilst 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
giving 7
his 7
further 7
orders 7
removed 7
her 7
girdle 7
which 7
she 7
placed 7
beside 7
her 7
and 7
desiring 7
her 7
women 7
to 7
leave 7
her 7
lay 7
down 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
asleep 7
when 7
the 7
camp 7
was 7
all 7
in 7
order 7
the 7
prince 7
entered 7
the 7
tent 7
and 7
seeing 7
the 7
princess 7
asleep 7
he 7
sat 7
down 7
near 7
her 7
without 7
speaking 7
his 7
eyes 7
fell 7
on 7
the 7
girdle 7
which 7
he 7
took 7
up 7
and 7
whilst 7
inspecting 7
the 7
precious 7
stones 7
set 7
in 7
it 7
he 7
noticed 7
a 7
little 7
pouch 7
sewn 7
to 7
the 7
girdle 7
and 7
fastened 7
by 7
a 7
loop 7
he 7
touched 7
it 7
and 7
felt 7
something 7
hard 7
within 7
curious 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
this 7
might 7
be 7
he 7
opened 7
the 7
pouch 7
and 7
found 7
a 7
cornelian 7
engraved 7
with 7
various 7
figures 7
and 7
strange 7
characters 7
this 7
cornelian 7
must 7
be 7
something 7
very 7
precious 7
thought 7
he 7
or 7
my 7
wife 7
would 7
not 7
wear 7
it 7
on 7
her 7
person 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
care 7
in 7
truth 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
talisman 7
which 7
the 7
queen 7
of 7
china 7
had 7
given 7
her 7
daughter 7
telling 7
her 7
it 7
would 7
ensure 7
her 7
happiness 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
she 7
carried 7
it 7
about 7
her 7
the 7
better 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
stone 7
the 7
prince 7
stepped 7
to 7
the 7
open 7
doorway 7
of 7
the 7
tent 7
as 7
he 7
stood 7
there 7
holding 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
open 7
palm 7
of 7
his 7
hand 7
a 7
bird 7
suddenly 7
swooped 7
down 7
picked 7
the 7
stone 7
up 7
in 7
its 7
beak 7
and 7
flew 7
away 7
with 7
it 7
imagine 7
the 7
princes 7
dismay 7
at 7
losing 7
a 7
thing 7
by 7
which 7
his 7
wife 7
evidently 7
set 7
such 7
store 7
the 7
bird 7
having 7
secured 7
its 7
prey 7
flew 7
off 7
some 7
yards 7
and 7
alighted 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
holding 7
the 7
talisman 7
it 7
its 7
beak 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
advanced 7
hoping 7
the 7
bird 7
would 7
drop 7
it 7
but 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
approached 7
the 7
thief 7
fluttered 7
on 7
a 7
little 7
further 7
still 7
he 7
continued 7
his 7
pursuit 7
till 7
the 7
bird 7
suddenly 7
swallowed 7
the 7
stone 7
and 7
took 7
a 7
longer 7
flight 7
than 7
before 7
the 7
prince 7
then 7
hoped 7
to 7
kill 7
it 7
with 7
a 7
stone 7
but 7
the 7
more 7
hotly 7
he 7
pursued 7
the 7
further 7
flew 7
the 7
bird 7
in 7
this 7
fashion 7
he 7
was 7
led 7
on 7
by 7
hill 7
and 7
dale 7
through 7
the 7
entire 7
day 7
and 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
the 7
tiresome 7
creature 7
roosted 7
on 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
a 7
very 7
high 7
tree 7
where 7
it 7
could 7
rest 7
in 7
safety 7
the 7
prince 7
in 7
despair 7
at 7
all 7
his 7
useless 7
trouble 7
began 7
to 7
think 7
whether 7
he 7
had 7
better 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
camp 7
but 7
thought 7
he 7
how 7
shall 7
i 7
find 7
my 7
way 7
back 7
must 7
i 7
go 7
up 7
hill 7
or 7
down 7
i 7
should 7
certainly 7
lose 7
my 7
way 7
in 7
the 7
dark 7
even 7
if 7
my 7
strength 7
held 7
out 7
overwhelmed 7
by 7
hunger 7
thirst 7
fatigue 7
and 7
sleep 7
he 7
ended 7
by 7
spending 7
the 7
night 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
tree 7
next 7
morning 7
camaralzaman 7
woke 7
up 7
before 7
the 7
bird 7
left 7
its 7
perch 7
and 7
no 7
sooner 7
did 7
it 7
take 7
flight 7
than 7
he 7
followed 7
it 7
again 7
with 7
as 7
little 7
success 7
as 7
the 7
previous 7
day 7
only 7
stopping 7
to 7
eat 7
some 7
herbs 7
and 7
fruit 7
he 7
found 7
by 7
the 7
way 7
in 7
this 7
fashion 7
he 7
spent 7
ten 7
days 7
following 7
the 7
bird 7
all 7
day 7
and 7
spending 7
the 7
night 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
a 7
tree 7
whilst 7
it 7
roosted 7
on 7
the 7
topmost 7
bough 7
on 7
the 7
eleventh 7
day 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
reached 7
a 7
large 7
town 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
close 7
to 7
its 7
walls 7
the 7
bird 7
took 7
a 7
sudden 7
and 7
higher 7
flight 7
and 7
was 7
shortly 7
completely 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
whilst 7
camaralzaman 7
felt 7
in 7
despair 7
at 7
having 7
to 7
give 7
up 7
all 7
hopes 7
of 7
ever 7
recovering 7
the 7
talisman 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
much 7
cast 7
down 7
he 7
entered 7
the 7
town 7
which 7
was 7
built 7
near 7
the 7
sea 7
and 7
had 7
a 7
fine 7
harbour 7
he 7
walked 7
about 7
the 7
streets 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
time 7
not 7
knowing 7
where 7
to 7
go 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
as 7
he 7
walked 7
near 7
the 7
seashore 7
he 7
found 7
a 7
garden 7
door 7
open 7
and 7
walked 7
in 7
the 7
gardener 7
a 7
good 7
old 7
man 7
who 7
was 7
at 7
work 7
happened 7
to 7
look 7
up 7
and 7
seeing 7
a 7
stranger 7
whom 7
he 7
recognised 7
by 7
his 7
dress 7
as 7
a 7
mussulman 7
he 7
told 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
in 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
to 7
shut 7
the 7
door 7
camaralzaman 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
bid 7
and 7
inquired 7
why 7
this 7
precaution 7
was 7
taken 7
because 7
said 7
the 7
gardener 7
i 7
see 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
a 7
stranger 7
and 7
a 7
mussulman 7
and 7
this 7
town 7
is 7
almost 7
entirely 7
inhabited 7
by 7
idolaters 7
who 7
hate 7
and 7
persecute 7
all 7
of 7
our 7
faith 7
it 7
seems 7
almost 7
a 7
miracle 7
that 7
has 7
led 7
you 7
to 7
this 7
house 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
indeed 7
glad 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
found 7
a 7
place 7
of 7
safety 7
camaralzaman 7
warmly 7
thanked 7
the 7
kind 7
old 7
man 7
for 7
offering 7
him 7
shelter 7
and 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
say 7
more 7
but 7
the 7
gardener 7
interrupted 7
him 7
with 7
leave 7
compliments 7
alone 7
you 7
are 7
weary 7
and 7
must 7
be 7
hungry 7
come 7
in 7
eat 7
and 7
rest 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
led 7
the 7
prince 7
into 7
his 7
cottage 7
and 7
after 7
satisfying 7
his 7
hunger 7
begged 7
to 7
learn 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
his 7
arrival 7
camaralzaman 7
told 7
him 7
all 7
without 7
disguise 7
and 7
ended 7
by 7
inquiring 7
the 7
shortest 7
way 7
to 7
his 7
fathers 7
capital 7
for 7
added 7
he 7
if 7
i 7
tried 7
to 7
rejoin 7
the 7
princess 7
how 7
should 7
i 7
find 7
her 7
after 7
eleven 7
days 7
separation 7
perhaps 7
indeed 7
she 7
may 7
be 7
no 7
longer 7
alive 7
at 7
this 7
terrible 7
thought 7
he 7
burst 7
into 7
tears 7
the 7
gardener 7
informed 7
camaralzaman 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
quite 7
a 7
years 7
land 7
journey 7
to 7
any 7
mahomedan 7
country 7
but 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
a 7
much 7
shorter 7
route 7
by 7
sea 7
to 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
from 7
whence 7
the 7
isles 7
of 7
the 7
children 7
of 7
khaledan 7
could 7
be 7
easily 7
reached 7
and 7
that 7
a 7
ship 7
sailed 7
once 7
a 7
year 7
for 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
by 7
which 7
he 7
might 7
get 7
so 7
far 7
as 7
his 7
very 7
home 7
if 7
only 7
you 7
had 7
arrived 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
sooner 7
he 7
said 7
you 7
might 7
have 7
embarked 7
at 7
once 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
you 7
must 7
now 7
wait 7
till 7
next 7
year 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
care 7
to 7
stay 7
with 7
me 7
i 7
offer 7
you 7
my 7
house 7
such 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
with 7
all 7
my 7
heart 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
thought 7
himself 7
lucky 7
to 7
find 7
some 7
place 7
of 7
refuge 7
and 7
gladly 7
accepted 7
the 7
gardeners 7
offer 7
he 7
spent 7
his 7
days 7
working 7
in 7
the 7
garden 7
and 7
his 7
nights 7
thinking 7
of 7
and 7
sighing 7
for 7
his 7
beloved 7
wife 7
let 7
us 7
now 7
see 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
during 7
this 7
time 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
on 7
first 7
waking 7
she 7
was 7
much 7
surprised 7
not 7
to 7
find 7
the 7
prince 7
near 7
her 7
she 7
called 7
her 7
women 7
and 7
asked 7
if 7
they 7
knew 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
and 7
whilst 7
they 7
were 7
telling 7
her 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
seen 7
him 7
enter 7
the 7
tent 7
but 7
had 7
not 7
noticed 7
his 7
leaving 7
it 7
she 7
took 7
up 7
her 7
belt 7
and 7
perceived 7
that 7
the 7
little 7
pouch 7
was 7
open 7
and 7
the 7
talisman 7
gone 7
she 7
at 7
once 7
concluded 7
that 7
her 7
husband 7
had 7
taken 7
it 7
and 7
would 7
shortly 7
bring 7
it 7
back 7
she 7
waited 7
for 7
him 7
till 7
evening 7
rather 7
impatiently 7
and 7
wondering 7
what 7
could 7
have 7
kept 7
him 7
from 7
her 7
so 7
long 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
without 7
him 7
she 7
felt 7
in 7
despair 7
and 7
abused 7
the 7
talisman 7
and 7
its 7
maker 7
roundly 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
her 7
grief 7
and 7
anxiety 7
however 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
lose 7
her 7
presence 7
of 7
mind 7
but 7
decided 7
on 7
a 7
courageous 7
though 7
very 7
unusual 7
step 7
only 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
her 7
women 7
knew 7
of 7
camaralzamans 7
disappearance 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
party 7
were 7
sleeping 7
or 7
resting 7
in 7
their 7
tents 7
fearing 7
some 7
treason 7
should 7
the 7
truth 7
be 7
known 7
she 7
ordered 7
her 7
women 7
not 7
to 7
say 7
a 7
word 7
which 7
would 7
give 7
rise 7
to 7
any 7
suspicion 7
and 7
proceeded 7
to 7
change 7
her 7
dress 7
for 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
husbands 7
to 7
whom 7
as 7
has 7
been 7
already 7
said 7
she 7
bore 7
a 7
strong 7
likeness 7
in 7
this 7
disguise 7
she 7
looked 7
so 7
like 7
the 7
prince 7
that 7
when 7
she 7
gave 7
orders 7
next 7
morning 7
to 7
break 7
up 7
the 7
camp 7
and 7
continue 7
the 7
journey 7
no 7
one 7
suspected 7
the 7
change 7
she 7
made 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
women 7
enter 7
her 7
litter 7
whilst 7
she 7
herself 7
mounted 7
on 7
horseback 7
and 7
the 7
march 7
began 7
after 7
a 7
protracted 7
journey 7
by 7
land 7
and 7
sea 7
the 7
princess 7
still 7
under 7
the 7
name 7
and 7
disguise 7
of 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
arrived 7
at 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
whose 7
king 7
was 7
named 7
armanos 7
no 7
sooner 7
did 7
the 7
king 7
hear 7
that 7
the 7
ship 7
which 7
was 7
just 7
in 7
port 7
had 7
on 7
board 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
his 7
old 7
friend 7
and 7
ally 7
than 7
he 7
hurried 7
to 7
meet 7
the 7
supposed 7
prince 7
and 7
had 7
him 7
and 7
his 7
retinue 7
brought 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
they 7
were 7
lodged 7
and 7
entertained 7
sumptuously 7
after 7
three 7
days 7
finding 7
that 7
his 7
guest 7
to 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
taken 7
a 7
great 7
fancy 7
talked 7
of 7
continuing 7
his 7
journey 7
king 7
armanos 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
prince 7
i 7
am 7
now 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
and 7
unfortunately 7
have 7
no 7
son 7
to 7
whom 7
to 7
leave 7
my 7
kingdom 7
it 7
has 7
pleased 7
heaven 7
to 7
give 7
me 7
only 7
one 7
daughter 7
who 7
possesses 7
such 7
great 7
beauty 7
and 7
charm 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
only 7
give 7
her 7
to 7
a 7
prince 7
as 7
highly 7
born 7
and 7
as 7
accomplished 7
as 7
yourself 7
instead 7
therefore 7
of 7
returning 7
to 7
your 7
own 7
country 7
take 7
my 7
daughter 7
and 7
my 7
crown 7
and 7
stay 7
with 7
us 7
i 7
shall 7
feel 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
worthy 7
successor 7
and 7
shall 7
cheerfully 7
retire 7
from 7
the 7
fatigues 7
of 7
government 7
the 7
kings 7
offer 7
was 7
naturally 7
rather 7
embarrassing 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
she 7
felt 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
equally 7
impossible 7
to 7
confess 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
deceived 7
him 7
or 7
to 7
refuse 7
the 7
marriage 7
on 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
set 7
his 7
heart 7
a 7
refusal 7
which 7
might 7
turn 7
all 7
his 7
kindness 7
to 7
hatred 7
and 7
persecution 7
all 7
things 7
considered 7
she 7
decided 7
to 7
accept 7
and 7
after 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
silence 7
said 7
with 7
a 7
blush 7
which 7
the 7
king 7
attributed 7
to 7
modesty 7
sire 7
i 7
feel 7
so 7
great 7
an 7
obligation 7
for 7
the 7
good 7
opinion 7
your 7
majesty 7
has 7
expressed 7
for 7
my 7
person 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
honour 7
you 7
do 7
me 7
that 7
though 7
i 7
am 7
quite 7
unworthy 7
of 7
it 7
i 7
dare 7
not 7
refuse 7
but 7
sire 7
i 7
can 7
only 7
accept 7
such 7
an 7
alliance 7
if 7
you 7
give 7
me 7
your 7
promise 7
to 7
assist 7
me 7
with 7
your 7
counsels 7
the 7
marriage 7
being 7
thus 7
arranged 7
the 7
ceremony 7
was 7
fixed 7
for 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
employed 7
the 7
intervening 7
time 7
in 7
informing 7
the 7
officers 7
of 7
her 7
suite 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
assuring 7
them 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
had 7
given 7
her 7
full 7
consent 7
to 7
the 7
marriage 7
she 7
also 7
told 7
her 7
women 7
and 7
bade 7
them 7
keep 7
her 7
secret 7
well 7
king 7
armanos 7
delighted 7
with 7
the 7
success 7
of 7
his 7
plans 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
assembling 7
his 7
court 7
and 7
council 7
to 7
whom 7
he 7
presented 7
his 7
successor 7
and 7
placing 7
his 7
future 7
soninlaw 7
on 7
the 7
throne 7
made 7
everyone 7
do 7
homage 7
and 7
take 7
oaths 7
of 7
allegiance 7
to 7
the 7
new 7
king 7
at 7
night 7
the 7
whole 7
town 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
rejoicings 7
and 7
with 7
much 7
pomp 7
the 7

was 7
the 7

conducted 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
now 7
badoura 7
had 7
thought 7
much 7
of 7
the 7
difficulties 7
of 7
her 7
first 7
interview 7
with 7
king 7
armanos 7
daughter 7
and 7
she 7
felt 7
the 7
only 7
thing 7
to 7
do 7
was 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
take 7
her 7
into 7
her 7
confidence 7
accordingly 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
alone 7
she 7
took 7
haiatelnefous 7
by 7
the 7
hand 7
and 7
said 7
princess 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
secret 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
and 7
must 7
throw 7
myself 7
on 7
your 7
mercy 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
but 7
a 7
princess 7
like 7
yourself 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
my 7
story 7
then 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
you 7
will 7
forgive 7
my 7
imposture 7
in 7
consideration 7
of 7
my 7
sufferings 7
she 7
then 7
related 7
her 7
whole 7
history 7
and 7
at 7
its 7
close 7
haiatelnefous 7
embraced 7
her 7
warmly 7
and 7
assured 7
her 7
of 7
her 7
entire 7
sympathy 7
and 7
affection 7
the 7
two 7
princesses 7
now 7
planned 7
out 7
their 7
future 7
action 7
and 7
agreed 7
to 7
combine 7
to 7
keep 7
up 7
the 7
deception 7
and 7
to 7
let 7
badoura 7
continue 7
to 7
play 7
a 7
mans 7
part 7
until 7
such 7
time 7
as 7
there 7
might 7
be 7
news 7
of 7
the 7
real 7
camaralzaman 7
whilst 7
these 7
things 7
were 7
passing 7
in 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
prince 7
camaralzaman 7
continued 7
to 7
find 7
shelter 7
in 7
the 7
gardeners 7
cottage 7
in 7
the 7
town 7
of 7
the 7
idolaters 7
early 7
one 7
morning 7
the 7
gardener 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
today 7
is 7
a 7
public 7
holiday 7
and 7
the 7
people 7
of 7
the 7
town 7
not 7
only 7
do 7
not 7
work 7
themselves 7
but 7
forbid 7
others 7
to 7
do 7
so 7
you 7
had 7
better 7
therefore 7
take 7
a 7
good 7
rest 7
whilst 7
i 7
go 7
to 7
see 7
some 7
friends 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
time 7
is 7
near 7
for 7
the 7
arrival 7
of 7
the 7
ship 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
told 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
make 7
inquiries 7
about 7
it 7
and 7
try 7
to 7
bespeak 7
a 7
passage 7
for 7
you 7
he 7
then 7
put 7
on 7
his 7
best 7
clothes 7
and 7
went 7
out 7
leaving 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
strolled 7
into 7
the 7
garden 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
lost 7
in 7
thoughts 7
of 7
his 7
dear 7
wife 7
and 7
their 7
sad 7
separation 7
as 7
he 7
walked 7
up 7
and 7
down 7
he 7
was 7
suddenly 7
disturbed 7
in 7
his 7
reverie 7
by 7
the 7
noise 7
two 7
large 7
birds 7
were 7
making 7
in 7
a 7
tree 7
camaralzaman 7
stood 7
still 7
and 7
looked 7
up 7
and 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
birds 7
were 7
fighting 7
so 7
savagely 7
with 7
beaks 7
and 7
claws 7
that 7
before 7
long 7
one 7
fell 7
dead 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
whilst 7
the 7
conqueror 7
spread 7
his 7
wings 7
and 7
flew 7
away 7
almost 7
immediately 7
two 7
other 7
larger 7
birds 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
watching 7
the 7
duel 7
flew 7
up 7
and 7
alighted 7
one 7
at 7
the 7
head 7
and 7
the 7
other 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
the 7
dead 7
bird 7
they 7
stood 7
there 7
some 7
time 7
sadly 7
shaking 7
their 7
heads 7
and 7
then 7
dug 7
up 7
a 7
grave 7
with 7
their 7
claws 7
in 7
which 7
they 7
buried 7
him 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
had 7
filled 7
in 7
the 7
grave 7
the 7
two 7
flew 7
off 7
and 7
ere 7
long 7
returned 7
bringing 7
with 7
them 7
the 7
murderer 7
whom 7
they 7
held 7
one 7
by 7
a 7
wing 7
and 7
the 7
other 7
by 7
a 7
leg 7
with 7
their 7
beaks 7
screaming 7
and 7
struggling 7
with 7
rage 7
and 7
terror 7
but 7
they 7
held 7
tight 7
and 7
having 7
brought 7
him 7
to 7
his 7
victims 7
grave 7
they 7
proceeded 7
to 7
kill 7
him 7
after 7
which 7
they 7
tore 7
open 7
his 7
body 7
scattered 7
the 7
inside 7
and 7
once 7
more 7
flew 7
away 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
had 7
watched 7
the 7
whole 7
scene 7
with 7
much 7
interest 7
now 7
drew 7
near 7
the 7
spot 7
where 7
it 7
happened 7
and 7
glancing 7
at 7
the 7
dead 7
bird 7
he 7
noticed 7
something 7
red 7
lying 7
near 7
which 7
had 7
evidently 7
fallen 7
out 7
of 7
its 7
inside 7
he 7
picked 7
it 7
up 7
and 7
what 7
was 7
his 7
surprise 7
when 7
he 7
recognised 7
the 7
princess 7
badouras 7
talisman 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
many 7
misfortunes 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
impossible 7
to 7
describe 7
his 7
joy 7
he 7
kissed 7
the 7
talisman 7
repeatedly 7
wrapped 7
it 7
up 7
and 7
carefully 7
tied 7
it 7
round 7
his 7
arm 7
for 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
since 7
his 7
separation 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
good 7
night 7
and 7
next 7
morning 7
he 7
was 7
up 7
at 7
daybreak 7
and 7
went 7
cheerfully 7
to 7
ask 7
what 7
work 7
he 7
should 7
do 7
the 7
gardener 7
told 7
him 7
to 7
cut 7
down 7
an 7
old 7
fruit 7
tree 7
which 7
had 7
quite 7
died 7
away 7
and 7
camaralzaman 7
took 7
an 7
axe 7
and 7
fell 7
to 7
vigorously 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
hacking 7
at 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
roots 7
the 7
axe 7
struck 7
on 7
something 7
hard 7
on 7
pushing 7
away 7
the 7
earth 7
he 7
discovered 7
a 7
large 7
slab 7
of 7
bronze 7
under 7
which 7
was 7
disclosed 7
a 7
staircase 7
with 7
ten 7
steps 7
he 7
went 7
down 7
them 7
and 7
found 7
himself 7
in 7
a 7
roomy 7
kind 7
of 7
cave 7
in 7
which 7
stood 7
fifty 7
large 7
bronze 7
jars 7
each 7
with 7
a 7
cover 7
on 7
it 7
the 7
prince 7
uncovered 7
one 7
after 7
another 7
and 7
found 7
them 7
all 7
filled 7
with 7
gold 7
dust 7
delighted 7
with 7
his 7
discovery 7
he 7
left 7
the 7
cave 7
replaced 7
the 7
slab 7
and 7
having 7
finished 7
cutting 7
down 7
the 7
tree 7
waited 7
for 7
the 7
gardeners 7
return 7
the 7
gardener 7
had 7
heard 7
the 7
night 7
before 7
that 7
the 7
ship 7
about 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
inquiring 7
would 7
start 7
ere 7
long 7
but 7
the 7
exact 7
date 7
not 7
being 7
yet 7
known 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
told 7
to 7
return 7
next 7
day 7
for 7
further 7
information 7
he 7
had 7
gone 7
therefore 7
to 7
inquire 7
and 7
came 7
back 7
with 7
good 7
news 7
beaming 7
in 7
his 7
face 7
my 7
son 7
said 7
he 7
rejoice 7
and 7
hold 7
yourself 7
ready 7
to 7
start 7
in 7
three 7
days 7
time 7
the 7
ship 7
is 7
to 7
set 7
sail 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
arranged 7
all 7
about 7
your 7
passage 7
with 7
the 7
captain 7
you 7
could 7
not 7
bring 7
me 7
better 7
news 7
replied 7
camaralzaman 7
and 7
in 7
return 7
i 7
have 7
something 7
pleasant 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
follow 7
me 7
and 7
see 7
the 7
good 7
fortune 7
which 7
has 7
befallen 7
you 7
he 7
then 7
led 7
the 7
gardener 7
to 7
the 7
cave 7
and 7
having 7
shown 7
him 7
the 7
treasure 7
stored 7
up 7
there 7
said 7
how 7
happy 7
it 7
made 7
him 7
that 7
heaven 7
should 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
reward 7
his 7
kind 7
hosts 7
many 7
virtues 7
and 7
compensate 7
him 7
for 7
the 7
privations 7
of 7
many 7
years 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
mean 7
asked 7
the 7
gardener 7
do 7
you 7
imagine 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
appropriate 7
this 7
treasure 7
it 7
is 7
yours 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
right 7
whatever 7
to 7
it 7
for 7
the 7
last 7
eighty 7
years 7
i 7
have 7
dug 7
up 7
the 7
ground 7
here 7
without 7
discovering 7
anything 7
it 7
is 7
clear 7
that 7
these 7
riches 7
are 7
intended 7
for 7
you 7
and 7
they 7
are 7
much 7
more 7
needed 7
by 7
a 7
prince 7
like 7
yourself 7
than 7
by 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
like 7
me 7
who 7
am 7
near 7
my 7
end 7
and 7
require 7
nothing 7
this 7
treasure 7
comes 7
just 7
at 7
the 7
right 7
time 7
when 7
you 7
are 7
about 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
your 7
own 7
country 7
where 7
you 7
will 7
make 7
good 7
use 7
of 7
it 7
but 7
the 7
prince 7
would 7
not 7
hear 7
of 7
this 7
suggestion 7
and 7
finally 7
after 7
much 7
discussion 7
they 7
agreed 7
to 7
divide 7
the 7
gold 7
when 7
this 7
was 7
done 7
the 7
gardener 7
said 7
my 7
son 7
the 7
great 7
thing 7
now 7
is 7
to 7
arrange 7
how 7
you 7
can 7
best 7
carry 7
off 7
this 7
treasure 7
as 7
secretly 7
as 7
possible 7
for 7
fear 7
of 7
losing 7
it 7
there 7
are 7
no 7
olives 7
in 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
and 7
those 7
imported 7
from 7
here 7
fetch 7
a 7
high 7
price 7
as 7
you 7
know 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
good 7
stock 7
of 7
the 7
olives 7
which 7
grew 7
in 7
this 7
garden 7
now 7
you 7
must 7
take 7
fifty 7
jars 7
fill 7
each 7
half 7
full 7
of 7
gold 7
dust 7
and 7
fill 7
them 7
up 7
with 7
the 7
olives 7
we 7
will 7
then 7
have 7
them 7
taken 7
on 7
board 7
ship 7
when 7
you 7
embark 7
the 7
prince 7
took 7
this 7
advice 7
and 7
spent 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
day 7
filling 7
the 7
fifty 7
jars 7
and 7
fearing 7
lest 7
the 7
precious 7
talisman 7
might 7
slip 7
from 7
his 7
arm 7
and 7
be 7
lost 7
again 7
he 7
took 7
the 7
precaution 7
of 7
putting 7
it 7
in 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
jars 7
on 7
which 7
he 7
made 7
a 7
mark 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
recognise 7
it 7
when 7
night 7
came 7
the 7
jars 7
were 7
all 7
ready 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
his 7
host 7
went 7
to 7
bed 7
whether 7
in 7
consequence 7
of 7
his 7
great 7
age 7
or 7
of 7
the 7
fatigues 7
and 7
excitement 7
of 7
the 7
previous 7
day 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
but 7
the 7
gardener 7
passed 7
a 7
very 7
bad 7
night 7
he 7
was 7
worse 7
next 7
day 7
and 7
by 7
the 7
morning 7
of 7
the 7
third 7
day 7

dangerously 7
ill 7
at 7
daybreak 7
the 7
ships 7
captain 7
and 7
some 7
of 7
his 7
sailors 7
knocked 7
at 7
the 7
garden 7
door 7
and 7
asked 7
for 7
the 7
passenger 7
who 7
was 7
to 7
embark 7
i 7
am 7
he 7
said 7
camaralzaman 7
who 7
had 7
opened 7
the 7
door 7
the 7
gardener 7
who 7
took 7
my 7
passage 7

ill 7
and 7
cannot 7
see 7
you 7
but 7
please 7
come 7
in 7
and 7
take 7
these 7
jars 7
of 7
olives 7
and 7
my 7
bag 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
follow 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
i 7
have 7
taken 7
leave 7
of 7
him 7
the 7
sailors 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
asked 7
and 7
the 7
captain 7
before 7
leaving 7
charged 7
camaralzaman 7
to 7
lose 7
no 7
time 7
as 7
the 7
wind 7
was 7
fair 7
and 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
set 7
sail 7
at 7
once 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
gone 7
the 7
prince 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
cottage 7
to 7
bid 7
farewell 7
to 7
his 7
old 7
friend 7
and 7
to 7
thank 7
him 7
once 7
more 7
for 7
all 7
his 7
kindness 7
but 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
was 7
at 7
his 7
last 7
gasp 7
and 7
had 7
barely 7
murmured 7
his 7
confession 7
of 7
faith 7
when 7
he 7
expired 7
camaralzaman 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
stay 7
and 7
pay 7
him 7
the 7
last 7
offices 7
so 7
having 7
dug 7
a 7
grave 7
in 7
the 7
garden 7
he 7
wrapped 7
the 7
kind 7
old 7
man 7
up 7
and 7
buried 7
him 7
he 7
then 7
locked 7
the 7
door 7
gave 7
up 7
the 7
key 7
to 7
the 7
owner 7
of 7
the 7
garden 7
and 7
hurried 7
to 7
the 7
quay 7
only 7
to 7
hear 7
that 7
the 7
ship 7
had 7
sailed 7
long 7
ago 7
after 7
waiting 7
three 7
hours 7
for 7
him 7
it 7
may 7
well 7
be 7
believed 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
felt 7
in 7
despair 7
at 7
this 7
fresh 7
misfortune 7
which 7
obliged 7
him 7
to 7
spend 7
another 7
year 7
in 7
a 7
strange 7
and 7
distasteful 7
country 7
moreover 7
he 7
had 7
once 7
more 7
lost 7
the 7
princess 7
badouras 7
talisman 7
which 7
he 7
feared 7
he 7
might 7
never 7
see 7
again 7
there 7
was 7
nothing 7
left 7
for 7
him 7
but 7
to 7
hire 7
the 7
garden 7
as 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
to 7
live 7
on 7
in 7
the 7
cottage 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
well 7
cultivate 7
the 7
garden 7
by 7
himself 7
he 7
engaged 7
a 7
lad 7
to 7
help 7
him 7
and 7
to 7
secure 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
treasure 7
he 7
put 7
the 7
remaining 7
gold 7
dust 7
into 7
fifty 7
more 7
jars 7
filling 7
them 7
up 7
with 7
olives 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
have 7
them 7
ready 7
for 7
transport 7
whilst 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
settling 7
down 7
to 7
this 7
second 7
year 7
of 7
toil 7
and 7
privation 7
the 7
ship 7
made 7
a 7
rapid 7
voyage 7
and 7
arrived 7
safely 7
at 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
as 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
the 7
new 7
king 7
or 7
rather 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
overlooked 7
the 7
harbour 7
she 7
saw 7
the 7
ship 7
entering 7
it 7
and 7
asked 7
what 7
vessel 7
it 7
was 7
coming 7
in 7
so 7
gaily 7
decked 7
with 7
flags 7
and 7
was 7
told 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
ship 7
from 7
the 7
island 7
of 7
the 7
idolaters 7
which 7
yearly 7
brought 7
rich 7
merchandise 7
the 7
princess 7
ever 7
on 7
the 7
look 7
out 7
for 7
any 7
chance 7
of 7
news 7
of 7
her 7
beloved 7
husband 7
went 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
harbour 7
attended 7
by 7
some 7
officers 7
of 7
the 7
court 7
and 7
arrived 7
just 7
as 7
the 7
captain 7
was 7
landing 7
she 7
sent 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
asked 7
many 7
questions 7
as 7
to 7
his 7
country 7
voyage 7
what 7
passengers 7
he 7
had 7
and 7
what 7
his 7
vessel 7
was 7
laden 7
with 7
the 7
captain 7
answered 7
all 7
her 7
questions 7
and 7
said 7
that 7
his 7
passengers 7
consisted 7
entirely 7
of 7
traders 7
who 7
brought 7
rich 7
stuffs 7
from 7
various 7
countries 7
fine 7
muslins 7
precious 7
stones 7
musk 7
amber 7
spices 7
drugs 7
olives 7
and 7
many 7
other 7
things 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
mentioned 7
olives 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
was 7
very 7
partial 7
to 7
them 7
exclaimed 7
i 7
will 7
take 7
all 7
you 7
have 7
on 7
board 7
have 7
them 7
unloaded 7
and 7
we 7
will 7
make 7
our 7
bargain 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
tell 7
the 7
other 7
merchants 7
to 7
let 7
me 7
see 7
all 7
their 7
best 7
wares 7
before 7
showing 7
them 7
to 7
other 7
people 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
captain 7
i 7
have 7
on 7
board 7
fifty 7
very 7
large 7
pots 7
of 7
olives 7
they 7
belong 7
to 7
a 7
merchant 7
who 7
was 7
left 7
behind 7
as 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
waiting 7
for 7
him 7
he 7
delayed 7
so 7
long 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
set 7
sail 7
without 7
him 7
never 7
mind 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7

them 7
all 7
the 7
same 7
and 7
we 7
will 7
arrange 7
the 7
price 7
the 7
captain 7
accordingly 7
sent 7
his 7
boat 7
off 7
to 7
the 7
ship 7
and 7
it 7
soon 7
returned 7
laden 7
with 7
the 7
fifty 7
pots 7
of 7
olives 7
the 7
princess 7
asked 7
what 7
they 7
might 7
be 7
worth 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
captain 7
the 7
merchant 7
is 7
very 7
poor 7
your 7
majesty 7
will 7
not 7
overpay 7
him 7
if 7
you 7
give 7
him 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
silver 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
satisfy 7
him 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
is 7
so 7
poor 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
will 7
order 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
to 7
be 7
given 7
you 7
which 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
sure 7
to 7
remit 7
to 7
him 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
gave 7
orders 7
for 7
the 7
payment 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
having 7
the 7
jars 7
carried 7
before 7
her 7
when 7
evening 7
came 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
retired 7
to 7
the 7
inner 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
going 7
to 7
the 7
apartments 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
she 7
had 7
the 7
fifty 7
jars 7
of 7
olives 7
brought 7
to 7
her 7
she 7
opened 7
one 7
to 7
let 7
her 7
friend 7
taste 7
the 7
olives 7
and 7
to 7
taste 7
them 7
herself 7
but 7
great 7
was 7
her 7
surprise 7
when 7
on 7
pouring 7
some 7
into 7
a 7
dish 7
she 7
found 7
them 7
all 7
powdered 7
with 7
gold 7
dust 7
what 7
an 7
adventure 7
how 7
extraordinary 7
she 7
cried 7
then 7
she 7
had 7
the 7
other 7
jars 7
opened 7
and 7
was 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
surprised 7
to 7
find 7
the 7
olives 7
in 7
each 7
jar 7
mixed 7
with 7
gold 7
dust 7
but 7
when 7
at 7
length 7
her 7
talisman 7
was 7
discovered 7
in 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
jars 7
her 7
emotion 7
was 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
she 7
fainted 7
away 7
the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
and 7
her 7
women 7
hastened 7
to 7
restore 7
her 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
she 7
recovered 7
consciousness 7
she 7
covered 7
the 7
precious 7
talisman 7
with 7
kisses 7
then 7
dismissing 7
the 7
attendants 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
friend 7
you 7
will 7
have 7
guessed 7
my 7
dear 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
this 7
talisman 7
which 7
has 7
moved 7
me 7
so 7
deeply 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
my 7
separation 7
from 7
my 7
dear 7
husband 7
and 7
now 7
i 7
am 7
convinced 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
the 7
means 7
of 7
our 7
reunion 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
light 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
captain 7
and 7
made 7
further 7
inquiries 7
about 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
owned 7
the 7
olive 7
jars 7
she 7
had 7
bought 7
in 7
reply 7
the 7
captain 7
told 7
her 7
all 7
he 7
knew 7
of 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
lived 7
and 7
how 7
after 7
engaging 7
his 7
passage 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
left 7
behind 7
if 7
that 7
is 7
the 7
case 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
you 7
must 7
set 7
sail 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
go 7
back 7
for 7
him 7
he 7
is 7
a 7
debtor 7
of 7
mine 7
and 7
must 7
be 7
brought 7
here 7
at 7
once 7
or 7
i 7
will 7
confiscate 7
all 7
your 7
merchandise 7
i 7
shall 7
now 7
give 7
orders 7
to 7
have 7
all 7
the 7
warehouses 7
where 7
your 7
cargo 7
is 7
placed 7
under 7
the 7
royal 7
seal 7
and 7
they 7
will 7
only 7
be 7
opened 7
when 7
you 7
have 7
brought 7
me 7
the 7
man 7
i 7
ask 7
for 7
go 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
obey 7
my 7
orders 7
the 7
captain 7
had 7
no 7
choice 7
but 7
to 7
do 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
bid 7
so 7
hastily 7
provisioning 7
his 7
ship 7
he 7
started 7
that 7
same 7
evening 7
on 7
his 7
return 7
voyage 7
when 7
after 7
a 7
rapid 7
passage 7
he 7
gained 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
island 7
of 7
idolaters 7
he 7
judged 7
it 7
better 7
not 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
harbour 7
but 7
casting 7
anchor 7
at 7
some 7
distance 7
he 7
embarked 7
at 7
night 7
in 7
a 7
small 7
boat 7
with 7
six 7
active 7
sailors 7
and 7
landed 7
near 7
camaralzamans 7
cottage 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
not 7
asleep 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
lay 7
awake 7
moaning 7
over 7
all 7
the 7
sad 7
events 7
which 7
had 7
separated 7
him 7
from 7
his 7
wife 7
he 7
thought 7
he 7
heard 7
a 7
knock 7
at 7
the 7
garden 7
door 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
open 7
it 7
and 7
was 7
immediately 7
seized 7
by 7
the 7
captain 7
and 7
sailors 7
who 7
without 7
a 7
word 7
of 7
explanation 7
forcibly 7
bore 7
him 7
off 7
to 7
the 7
boat 7
which 7
took 7
them 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
ship 7
without 7
loss 7
of 7
time 7
no 7
sooner 7
were 7
they 7
on 7
board 7
than 7
they 7
weighed 7
anchor 7
and 7
set 7
sail 7
camaralzaman 7
who 7
had 7
kept 7
silence 7
till 7
then 7
now 7
asked 7
the 7
captain 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
recognised 7
the 7
reason 7
for 7
this 7
abduction 7
are 7
you 7
not 7
a 7
debtor 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
ebony 7
island 7
asked 7
the 7
captain 7
i 7
why 7
i 7
never 7
even 7
heard 7
of 7
him 7
before 7
and 7
never 7
set 7
foot 7
in 7
his 7
kingdom 7
was 7
the 7
answer 7
well 7
you 7
must 7
know 7
better 7
than 7
i 7
said 7
the 7
captain 7
you 7
will 7
soon 7
see 7
him 7
now 7
and 7
meantime 7
be 7
content 7
where 7
you 7
are 7
and 7
have 7
patience 7
the 7
return 7
voyage 7
was 7
as 7
prosperous 7
as 7
the 7
former 7
one 7
and 7
though 7
it 7
was 7
night 7
when 7
the 7
ship 7
entered 7
the 7
harbour 7
the 7
captain 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
landing 7
with 7
his 7
passenger 7
whom 7
he 7
conducted 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
he 7
begged 7
an 7
audience 7
with 7
the 7
king 7
directly 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
saw 7
the 7
prince 7
she 7
recognised 7
him 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
shabby 7
clothes 7
she 7
longed 7
to 7
throw 7
herself 7
on 7
his 7
neck 7
but 7
restrained 7
herself 7
feeling 7
it 7
was 7
better 7
for 7
them 7
both 7
that 7
she 7
should 7
play 7
her 7
part 7
a 7
little 7
longer 7
she 7
therefore 7
desired 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
officers 7
to 7
take 7
care 7
of 7
him 7
and 7
to 7
treat 7
him 7
well 7
next 7
she 7
ordered 7
another 7
officer 7
to 7
remove 7
the 7
seals 7
from 7
the 7
warehouse 7
whilst 7
she 7
presented 7
the 7
captain 7
with 7
a 7
costly 7
diamond 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
to 7
keep 7
the 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
paid 7
for 7
the 7
olives 7
as 7
she 7

her 7
private 7
apartments 7
where 7
she 7
told 7
the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
all 7
that 7

happened 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
her 7
plans 7
for 7
the 7
future 7
and 7
begged 7
her 7
assistance 7
which 7
her 7
friend 7
readily 7
promised 7
next 7
morning 7
she 7
ordered 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
be 7
taken 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
and 7
clothed 7
in 7
a 7
manner 7
suitable 7
to 7
an 7
emir 7
or 7
governor 7
of 7
a 7
province 7
he 7
was 7
then 7
introduced 7
to 7
the 7
council 7
where 7
his 7
good 7
looks 7
and 7
grand 7
air 7
drew 7
the 7
attention 7
of 7
all 7
on 7
him 7
princess 7
badoura 7
delighted 7
to 7
see 7
him 7
looking 7
himself 7
once 7
more 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
emirs 7
saying 7
my 7
lords 7
i 7
introduce 7
to 7
you 7
a 7
new 7
colleague 7
camaralzaman 7
whom 7
i 7
have 7
known 7
on 7
my 7
travels 7
and 7
who 7
i 7
can 7
assure 7
you 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
well 7

your 7
regard 7
and 7
admiration 7
camaralzaman 7
was 7
much 7
surprised 7
at 7
hearing 7
the 7
kingwhom 7
he 7
never 7
suspected 7
of 7
being 7
a 7
woman 7
in 7
disguiseasserting 7
their 7
acquaintance 7
for 7
he 7
felt 7
sure 7
he 7
had 7
never 7
seen 7
her 7
before 7
however 7
he 7
received 7
all 7
the 7
praises 7
bestowed 7
on 7
him 7
with 7
becoming 7
modesty 7
and 7
prostrating 7
himself 7
said 7
sire 7
i 7
cannot 7
find 7
words 7
in 7
which 7
to 7
thank 7
your 7
majesty 7
for 7
the 7
great 7
honour 7
conferred 7
on 7
me 7
i 7
can 7
but 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
all 7
in 7
my 7
power 7
to 7
prove 7
myself 7
worthy 7
of 7
it 7
on 7
leaving 7
the 7
council 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
conducted 7
to 7
a 7
splendid 7
house 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
prepared 7
for 7
him 7
where 7
he 7
found 7
a 7
full 7
establishment 7
and 7
wellfilled 7
stables 7
at 7
his 7
orders 7
on 7
entering 7
his 7
study 7
his 7
steward 7
presented 7
him 7
with 7
a 7
coffer 7
filled 7
with 7
gold 7
pieces 7
for 7
his 7
current 7
expenses 7
he 7
felt 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
puzzled 7
by 7
such 7
good 7
fortune 7
and 7
little 7
guessed 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
china 7
was 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
it 7
after 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
the 7
princess 7
badoura 7
promoted 7
camaralzaman 7
to 7
the 7
post 7
of 7
grand 7
treasurer 7
an 7
office 7
which 7
he 7
filled 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
integrity 7
and 7
benevolence 7
as 7
to 7
win 7
universal 7
esteem 7
he 7
would 7
now 7
have 7
thought 7
himself 7
the 7
happiest 7
of 7
men 7
had 7
it 7
not 7
been 7
for 7
that 7
separation 7
which 7
he 7
never 7
ceased 7
to 7
bewail 7
he 7
had 7
no 7
clue 7
to 7
the 7
mystery 7
of 7
his 7
present 7
position 7
for 7
the 7
princess 7
out 7
of 7
compliment 7
to 7
the 7
old 7
king 7
had 7
taken 7
his 7
name 7
and 7
was 7
generally 7
known 7
as 7
king 7
armanos 7
the 7
younger 7
few 7
people 7
remembering 7
that 7
on 7
her 7
first 7
arrival 7
she 7
went 7
by 7
another 7
name 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
princess 7
felt 7
that 7
the 7
time 7
had 7
come 7
to 7
put 7
an 7
end 7
to 7
her 7
own 7
and 7
the 7
princes 7
suspense 7
and 7
having 7
arranged 7
all 7
her 7
plans 7
with 7
the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
she 7
informed 7
camaralzaman 7
that 7
she 7
wished 7
his 7
advice 7
on 7
some 7
important 7
business 7
and 7
to 7
avoid 7
being 7
disturbed 7
desired 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
that 7
evening 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
punctual 7
and 7
was 7
received 7
in 7
the 7
private 7
apartment 7
when 7
having 7
ordered 7
her 7
attendants 7
to 7
withdraw 7
the 7
princess 7
took 7
from 7
a 7
small 7
box 7
the 7
talisman 7
and 7
handing 7
it 7
to 7
camaralzaman 7
said 7
not 7
long 7
ago 7
an 7
astrologer 7
gave 7
me 7
this 7
talisman 7
as 7
you 7
are 7
universally 7
well 7
informed 7
you 7
can 7
perhaps 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
is 7
its 7
use 7
camaralzaman 7
took 7
the 7
talisman 7
and 7
holding 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
light 7
cried 7
with 7
surprise 7
sire 7
you 7
ask 7
me 7
the 7
use 7
of 7
this 7
talisman 7
alas 7
hitherto 7
it 7
has 7
been 7
only 7
a 7
source 7
of 7
misfortune 7
to 7
me 7
being 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
my 7
separation 7
from 7
the 7
one 7
i 7
love 7
best 7
on 7
earth 7
the 7
story 7
is 7
so 7
sad 7
and 7
strange 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
your 7
majesty 7
will 7
be 7
touched 7
by 7
it 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
permit 7
me 7
to 7
tell 7
it 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
hear 7
it 7
some 7
other 7
time 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
meanwhile 7
i 7
fancy 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
quite 7
unknown 7
to 7
me 7
wait 7
here 7
for 7
me 7
i 7
will 7
return 7
shortly 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
retired 7
to 7
another 7
room 7
where 7
she 7
hastily 7
changed 7
her 7
masculine 7
attire 7
for 7
that 7
of 7
a 7
woman 7
and 7
after 7
putting 7
on 7
the 7
girdle 7
she 7
wore 7
the 7
day 7
they 7
parted 7
returned 7
to 7
camaralzaman 7
the 7
prince 7
recognised 7
her 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
embracing 7
her 7
with 7
the 7
utmost 7
tenderness 7
cried 7
ah 7
how 7
can 7
i 7
thank 7
the 7
king 7
for 7
this 7
delightful 7
surprise 7
do 7
not 7
expect 7
ever 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
king 7
again 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
as 7
she 7
wiped 7
the 7
tears 7
of 7
joy 7
from 7
her 7
eyes 7
in 7
me 7
you 7
see 7
the 7
king 7
let 7
us 7
sit 7
down 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
all 7
about 7
it 7
she 7
then 7
gave 7
a 7
full 7
account 7
of 7
all 7
her 7
adventures 7
since 7
their 7
parting 7
and 7
dwelt 7
much 7
on 7
the 7
charms 7
and 7
noble 7
disposition 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
to 7
whose 7
friendly 7
assistance 7
she 7
owed 7
so 7
much 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
done 7
she 7
asked 7
to 7
hear 7
the 7
princes 7
story 7
and 7
in 7
this 7
manner 7
they 7
spent 7
most 7
of 7
the 7
night 7
next 7
morning 7
the 7
princess 7
resumed 7
her 7
womans 7
clothes 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
ready 7
she 7
desired 7
the 7
chief 7
eunuch 7
to 7
beg 7
king 7
armanos 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
her 7
apartments 7
when 7
the 7
king 7
arrived 7

his 7

at 7
finding 7
a 7
strange 7
lady 7
in 7
company 7
of 7
the 7
grand 7
treasurer 7
who 7
had 7
no 7
actual 7
right 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
private 7
apartment 7
seating 7
himself 7
he 7
asked 7
for 7

and 7

surprise 7
at 7
the 7
close 7
of 7
her 7
narrative 7
the 7
princess 7
said 7
sire 7
as 7

the 7
princess 7
with 7
surprise 7
and 7
admiration 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
camaralzaman 7
he 7
said 7

the 7
princess 7

to 7

and 7
if 7

consent 7
to 7

the 7

deserves 7
to 7
wear 7

but 7
which 7
she 7
prefers 7
to 7

the 7
princess 7
haiatelnefous 7
with 7
whose 7
beauty 7
talents 7
and 7
affections 7
he 7
had 7
every 7
reason 7
to 7
be 7
pleased 7
the 7
two 7
queens 7
lived 7
in 7
true 7
sisterly 7
harmony 7
together 7
and 7
after 7
a 7
time 7
each 7
presented 7
king 7
camaralzaman 7
with 7
a 7
son 7
whose 7
births 7
were 7
celebrated 7
throughout 7
the 7
kingdom 7
with 7
the 7
utmost 7
rejoicing 7
noureddin 7
and 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
balsora 7
was 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
a 7
kingdom 7
long 7
tributary 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
during 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
balsora 7
who 7
was 7
his 7
cousin 7
was 7
called 7
zinebi 7
not 7
thinking 7
one 7
vizir 7
enough 7
for 7
the 7
administration 7
of 7
his 7
estates 7
he 7
had 7
two 7
named 7
khacan 7
and 7
saouy 7
khacan 7
was 7
kind 7
generous 7
and 7
liberal 7
and 7
took 7
pleasure 7
in 7
obliging 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
in 7
him 7
lay 7
those 7
who 7
had 7
business 7
with 7
him 7
throughout 7
the 7
entire 7
kingdom 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
one 7
who 7
did 7
not 7
esteem 7
and 7
praise 7
him 7
as 7
he 7
deserved 7
saouy 7
was 7
quite 7
a 7
different 7
character 7
and 7
repelled 7
everyone 7
with 7
whom 7
he 7
came 7
in 7
contact 7
he 7
was 7
always 7
gloomy 7
and 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
great 7
riches 7
so 7
miserly 7
that 7
he 7
denied 7
himself 7
even 7
the 7
necessaries 7
of 7
life 7
what 7
made 7
him 7
particularly 7
detested 7
was 7
the 7
great 7
aversion 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
khacan 7
of 7
whom 7
he 7
never 7
ceased 7
to 7
speak 7
evil 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
one 7
day 7
while 7
the 7
king 7
amused 7
himself 7
talking 7
with 7
his 7
two 7
vizirs 7
and 7
other 7
members 7
of 7
the 7
council 7
the 7
conversation 7
turned 7
on 7
female 7
slaves 7
while 7
some 7
declared 7
that 7
it 7
sufficed 7
for 7
a 7
slave 7
to 7
be 7
beautiful 7
others 7
and 7
khacan 7
was 7
among 7
the 7
number 7
maintained 7
that 7
beauty 7
alone 7
was 7
not 7
enough 7
but 7
that 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
accompanied 7
by 7
wit 7
wisdom 7
modesty 7
and 7
if 7
possible 7
knowledge 7
the 7
king 7
not 7
only 7
declared 7
himself 7
to 7
be 7
of 7
this 7
opinion 7
but 7
charged 7
khacan 7
to 7
procure 7
him 7
a 7
slave 7
who 7
should 7
fulfil 7
all 7
these 7
conditions 7
saouy 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
of 7
the 7
opposite 7
side 7
and 7
was 7
jealous 7
of 7
the 7
honour 7
done 7
to 7
khacan 7
said 7
sire 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
very 7
difficult 7
to 7
find 7
a 7
slave 7
as 7
accomplished 7
as 7
your 7
majesty 7
desires 7
and 7
if 7
she 7
is 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
she 7
will 7
be 7
cheap 7
if 7
she 7
cost 7
less 7
than 7
gold 7
pieces 7
saouy 7
answered 7
the 7
king 7
you 7
seem 7
to 7
find 7
that 7
a 7
very 7
great 7
sum 7
for 7
you 7
it 7
may 7
be 7
so 7
but 7
not 7
for 7
me 7
and 7
forthwith 7
he 7
ordered 7
his 7
grand 7
treasurer 7
who 7
was 7
present 7
to 7
send 7
gold 7
pieces 7
to 7
khacan 7
for 7
the 7
purchase 7
of 7
the 7
slave 7
as 7
soon 7
then 7
as 7
khacan 7
returned 7
home 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
dealers 7
in 7
female 7
slaves 7
and 7
charged 7
them 7
directly 7
they 7
had 7
found 7
such 7
a 7
one 7
as 7
he 7
described 7
to 7
inform 7
him 7
they 7
promised 7
to 7
do 7
their 7
utmost 7
and 7
no 7
day 7
passed 7
that 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
bring 7
a 7
slave 7
for 7
his 7
inspection 7
but 7
none 7
was 7
found 7
without 7
some 7
defect 7
at 7
length 7
early 7
one 7
morning 7
while 7
khacan 7
was 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
kings 7
palace 7
a 7
dealer 7
throwing 7
himself 7
in 7
his 7
way 7
announced 7
eagerly 7
that 7
a 7
persian 7
merchant 7
arrived 7
late 7
the 7
previous 7
evening 7
had 7
a 7
slave 7
to 7
sell 7
whose 7
wit 7
and 7
wisdom 7
were 7
equal 7
to 7
her 7
incomparable 7
beauty 7
khacan 7
overjoyed 7
at 7
this 7
news 7
gave 7
orders 7
that 7
the 7
slave 7
should 7
be 7
brought 7
for 7
his 7
inspection 7
on 7
his 7
return 7
from 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
dealer 7
appearing 7
at 7
the 7
appointed 7
hour 7
khacan 7
found 7
the 7
slave 7
beautiful 7
beyond 7
his 7
expectations 7
and 7
immediately 7
gave 7
her 7
the 7
name 7
of 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
being 7
a 7
man 7
of 7
great 7
wisdom 7
and 7
learning 7
he 7
perceived 7
in 7
the 7
short 7
conversation 7
he 7
had 7
with 7
her 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
seek 7
in 7
vain 7
another 7
slave 7
to 7
surpass 7
her 7
in 7
any 7
of 7
the 7
qualities 7
required 7
by 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
therefore 7
asked 7
the 7
dealer 7
what 7
price 7
the 7
merchant 7
put 7
upon 7
her 7
sir 7
was 7
the 7
answer 7
for 7
less 7
than 7
gold 7
pieces 7
he 7
will 7
not 7
let 7
her 7
go 7
he 7
declares 7
that 7
what 7
with 7
masters 7
for 7
her 7
instruction 7
and 7
for 7
bodily 7
exercises 7
not 7
to 7
speak 7
of 7
clothing 7
and 7
nourishment 7
he 7
has 7
already 7
spent 7
that 7
sum 7
upon 7
her 7
she 7
is 7
in 7
every 7
way 7
fit 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
slave 7
of 7
a 7
king 7
she 7
plays 7
every 7
musical 7
instrument 7
she 7
sings 7
she 7
dances 7
she 7
makes 7
verses 7
in 7
fact 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
accomplishment 7
in 7
which 7
she 7
does 7
not 7
excel 7
khacan 7
who 7
was 7
better 7
able 7
to 7
judge 7
of 7
her 7
merits 7
than 7
the 7
dealer 7
wishing 7
to 7
bring 7
the 7
matter 7
to 7
a 7
conclusion 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
for 7
myself 7
that 7
i 7
wish 7
to 7
buy 7
your 7
slave 7
but 7
for 7
the 7
king 7
her 7
price 7
however 7
is 7
too 7
high 7
sir 7
replied 7
the 7
merchant 7
i 7
should 7
esteem 7
it 7
an 7
honour 7
to 7
present 7
her 7
to 7
his 7
majesty 7
did 7
it 7
become 7
a 7
merchant 7
to 7
do 7
such 7
a 7
thing 7
i 7
ask 7
no 7
more 7
than 7
the 7
sum 7
it 7
has 7
cost 7
me 7
to 7
make 7
her 7
such 7
as 7
she 7
is 7
khacan 7
not 7

to 7
bargain 7
immediately 7
had 7
the 7
sum 7
counted 7
out 7
and 7
given 7
to 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
before 7
withdrawing 7
said 7
sir 7
as 7
she 7
is 7
destined 7
for 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
would 7
have 7
you 7
observe 7
that 7
she 7
is 7
extremely 7
tired 7
with 7
the 7
long 7
journey 7
and 7
before 7
presenting 7
her 7
to 7
his 7
majesty 7
you 7
would 7
do 7
well 7
to 7
keep 7
her 7
a 7
fortnight 7
in 7
your 7
own 7
house 7
and 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
a 7
little 7
care 7
is 7
bestowed 7
upon 7
her 7
the 7
sun 7
has 7
tanned 7
her 7
complexion 7
but 7
when 7
she 7
has 7
been 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
times 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
and 7

fittingly 7
dressed 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
how 7
much 7
her 7
beauty 7
will 7
be 7
increased 7
khacan 7
thanked 7
the 7
merchant 7
for 7
his 7
advice 7
and 7
determined 7
to 7
follow 7
it 7
he 7
gave 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
an 7
apartment 7
near 7
to 7
that 7
of 7
his 7
wife 7
whom 7
he 7
charged 7
to 7

her 7
as 7
befitting 7
a 7
lady 7
destined 7
for 7

magnificent 7
garments 7
before 7
bidding 7
adieu 7
to 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
no 7
happiness 7
can 7
be 7
greater 7
than 7
what 7
i 7

procured 7
for 7

have 7
however 7
to 7

you 7
of 7
one 7
thing 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
son 7
who 7
though 7
not 7
wanting 7
in 7
sense 7

young 7
foolish 7
and 7
headstrong 7
and 7
i 7
charge 7
you 7
to 7
keep 7
him 7
at 7
a 7
distance 7
the 7
persian 7
thanked 7
him 7
for 7
his 7
advice 7
and 7
promised 7
to 7
profit 7
by 7
it 7
noureddinfor 7
so 7
the 7
vizirs 7
son 7
was 7
namedwent 7
freely 7
in 7
and 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
mothers 7
apartments 7
he 7
was 7
young 7
wellmade 7
and 7
agreeable 7
and 7
had 7
the 7
gift 7
of 7
charming 7
all 7
with 7
whom 7
he 7
came 7
in 7
contact 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
though 7
aware 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
destined 7
for 7
the 7
king 7
he 7
let 7
himself 7
be 7
carried 7
away 7
by 7
her 7
charms 7
and 7
determined 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
use 7
every 7
means 7
in 7
his 7
power 7
to 7
retain 7
her 7
for 7
himself 7
the 7
persian 7
was 7
equally 7
captivated 7
by 7
noureddin 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
herself 7
the 7
vizir 7
does 7
me 7
too 7
great 7
honour 7
in 7
buying 7
me 7
for 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
should 7
esteem 7
myself 7
very 7
happy 7
if 7
he 7
would 7
give 7
me 7
to 7
his 7
son 7
noureddin 7
availed 7
himself 7
of 7
every 7
opportunity 7
to 7
gaze 7
upon 7
her 7
beauty 7
to 7
talk 7
and 7
laugh 7
with 7
her 7
and 7
never 7
would 7
have 7
left 7
her 7
side 7
if 7
his 7
mother 7
had 7
not 7
forced 7
him 7
some 7
time 7
having 7
elapsed 7
on 7
account 7
of 7
the 7
long 7
journey 7
since 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
had 7
been 7
to 7
the 7

five 7
or 7
six 7
days 7
after 7
her 7
purchase 7
the 7
vizirs 7
wife 7
gave 7
orders 7
that 7
the 7

be 7
heated 7
for 7
her 7
and 7
that 7
her 7
own 7
female 7
slaves 7

attend 7
her 7
there 7
and 7
afterwards 7
should 7
array 7
her 7
in 7
a 7
magnificent 7
dress 7
that 7

been 7
prepared 7
for 7

the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
came 7
to 7
present 7
herself 7
to 7
the 7
vizirs 7
wife 7
who 7
hardly 7
recognised 7
her 7
so 7
greatly 7
was 7
her 7
beauty 7
increased 7
kissing 7
her 7
hand 7
the 7
beautiful 7
slave 7

madam 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
how 7
you 7
find 7
me 7
in 7
this 7
dress 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
had 7
prepared 7
for 7
me 7
your 7
women 7
assure 7
me 7
that 7
it 7
suits 7
me 7
so 7
well 7
that 7
they 7
hardly 7
knew 7
me 7
if 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
truth 7

tell 7
me 7
and 7

do 7
not 7
flatter 7
you 7
i 7
myself 7
hardly 7
recognised 7
you 7
the 7
improvement 7
is 7
not 7
due 7
to 7
the 7
dress 7
alone 7
but 7
largely 7
to 7
the 7
beautifying 7
effects 7
of 7
the 7
bath 7
i 7
am 7
so 7
struck 7
by 7
its 7
results 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
try 7
it 7
on 7
myself 7
acting 7
forthwith 7
on 7
this 7
decision 7
she 7
ordered 7
two 7
little 7
slaves 7
during 7
her 7
absence 7
to 7
watch 7
over 7
the 7

put 7
them 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
anteroom 7
and 7
shut 7
the 7

then 7
they 7
rushed 7
to 7
the 7
bath 7
informing 7
their 7
mistress 7
with 7
shrieks 7
and 7
tears 7

them 7
away 7
by 7
force 7
and 7

news 7
caused 7
great 7
consternation 7
to 7
the 7
lady 7
who 7
dressing 7
herself 7
as 7
quickly 7
as 7
possible 7
hastened 7
to 7
the 7
apartment 7
of 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
to 7
find 7

asked 7
what 7
misfortune 7

happened 7
what 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
lady 7

ask 7
me 7
that 7

that 7
my 7
son 7
noureddin 7
has 7
been 7
alone 7
with 7
you 7
but 7
madam 7
inquired 7
the 7
persian 7
what 7
harm 7
is 7
there 7
in 7
that 7
how 7
has 7
my 7
husband 7
not 7
told 7
you 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
destined 7
for 7
the 7
king 7
certainly 7
but 7
noureddin 7
has 7
just 7
been 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
that 7
his 7
father 7
has 7
changed 7
his 7
mind 7
and 7
has 7
bestowed 7
me 7
upon 7
him 7
i 7
believed 7
him 7
and 7
so 7
great 7
is 7
my 7
affection 7
for 7
noureddin 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
willingly 7
pass 7
my 7
life 7
with 7
him 7

heaven 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
wife 7
of 7
the 7
vizir 7
that 7
what 7
you 7
say 7
were 7
true 7
but 7
noureddin 7
has 7
deceived 7
you 7
and 7
his 7
father 7
will 7
sacrifice 7
him 7
in 7
vengeance 7
for 7
the 7
wrong 7
he 7
has 7
done 7
so 7
saying 7
she 7
wept 7
bitterly 7
and 7
all 7
her 7
slaves 7
wept 7
with 7
her 7
khacan 7
entering 7
shortly 7
after 7

much 7
astonished 7
to 7

his 7
wife 7
and 7
her 7
slaves 7
in 7
tears 7
and 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
greatly 7
perturbed 7
he 7
inquired 7
the 7
cause 7
but 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
no 7
answer 7
was 7
forthcoming 7
when 7
his 7
wife 7
was 7
at 7
length 7
sufficiently 7
calm 7
to 7
inform 7
him 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
his 7
rage 7
and 7
mortification 7
knew 7
no 7
bounds 7
wringing 7
his 7
hands 7
and 7
rending 7
his 7
beard 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
wretched 7
son 7
thou 7
destroyest 7
not 7
only 7
thyself 7
but 7
thy 7
father 7
the 7
king 7
will 7
shed 7
not 7
only 7
thy 7
blood 7
but 7
mine 7
his 7
wife 7
tried 7
to 7
console 7
him 7
saying 7
do 7
not 7
torment 7
thyself 7
with 7
the 7
sale 7
of 7
my 7
jewels 7
i 7
will 7
obtain 7
gold 7
pieces 7
and 7
with 7
this 7
sum 7
you 7
will 7
buy 7
another 7
slave 7
do 7
not 7
suppose 7
replied 7
her 7
husband 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
the 7
money 7
that 7
affects 7
me 7
my 7
honour 7
is 7
at 7
stake 7
and 7
that 7
is 7
more 7
precious 7
to 7
me 7
than 7
all 7
my 7
wealth 7
you 7
know 7
that 7
saouy 7
is 7
my 7
mortal 7
enemy 7
he 7
will 7
relate 7
all 7
this 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
the 7
consequences 7
that 7
will 7
ensue 7
my 7
lord 7
said 7
his 7
wife 7
i 7
am 7
quite 7
aware 7
of 7
saouys 7
baseness 7
and 7
that 7
he 7
is 7
capable 7
of 7
playing 7
you 7
this 7
malicious 7
trick 7
but 7
how 7
can 7
he 7
or 7
any 7
one 7
else 7
know 7
what 7
takes 7
place 7
in 7
this 7
house 7
even 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
suspected 7
and 7
the 7
king 7
accuses 7
you 7
you 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
say 7
that 7
after 7
examining 7
the 7
slave 7
you 7
did 7
not 7
find 7
her 7
worthy 7
of 7
his 7
majesty 7
reassure 7
yourself 7
and 7
send 7
to 7
the 7
dealers 7
saying 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
not 7
satisfied 7
and 7
wish 7
them 7
to 7
find 7
you 7
another 7
slave 7
this 7
advice 7
appearing 7
reasonable 7
khacan 7
decided 7
to 7
follow 7
it 7
but 7
his 7
wrath 7
against 7
his 7
son 7
did 7
not 7
abate 7
noureddin 7
dared 7
not 7
appear 7
all 7
that 7
day 7
and 7
fearing 7
to 7
take 7
refuge 7
with 7
his 7
usual 7
associates 7
in 7
case 7
his 7
father 7
should 7
seek 7
him 7
there 7
he 7
spent 7
the 7
day 7
in 7
a 7
secluded 7
garden 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
not 7
known 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
return 7
home 7
till 7
after 7
his 7
father 7
had 7
gone 7
to 7
bed 7
and 7
went 7
out 7
early 7
next 7
morning 7
before 7
the 7
vizir 7
awoke 7
and 7
these 7
precautions 7
he 7
kept 7
up 7
during 7
an 7
entire 7
month 7
his 7
mother 7
though 7
knowing 7
very 7
well 7
that 7
he 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
every 7
evening 7
dare 7
not 7
ask 7
her 7
husband 7
to 7
pardon 7
him 7
at 7
length 7
she 7
took 7
courage 7
and 7
said 7
my 7
lord 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
a 7
son 7
could 7
not 7
act 7
more 7
basely 7
towards 7
his 7
father 7
than 7
noureddin 7
has 7
done 7
towards 7
you 7
but 7
after 7
all 7
will 7
you 7
now 7
pardon 7
him 7
do 7
you 7
not 7
consider 7
the 7
harm 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
doing 7
yourself 7
and 7
fear 7
that 7
malicious 7
people 7
seeking 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
your 7
estrangement 7
may 7
guess 7
the 7
real 7
one 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
vizir 7
what 7
you 7
say 7
is 7
very 7
just 7
but 7
i 7
cannot 7
pardon 7
noureddin 7
before 7
i 7
have 7
mortified 7
him 7
as 7
he 7
deserves 7
he 7
will 7
be 7
sufficiently 7
punished 7
answered 7
the 7
lady 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
as 7
i 7
suggest 7
in 7
the 7
evening 7
when 7
he 7
returns 7
home 7
lie 7
in 7
wait 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
pretend 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
slay 7
him 7
i 7
will 7
come 7
to 7
his 7
aid 7
and 7
while 7
pointing 7
out 7
that 7
you 7
only 7
yield 7
his 7
life 7
at 7
my 7
supplications 7
you 7
can 7
force 7
him 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
on 7
any 7
conditions 7
you 7
please 7
khacan 7
agreed 7
to 7
follow 7
this 7
plan 7
and 7
everything 7
took 7
place 7
as 7
arranged 7
on 7
noureddins 7
return 7
khacan 7
pretended 7
to 7
be 7
about 7
to 7
slay 7
him 7
but 7
yielding 7
to 7
his 7
wifes 7
intercession 7
said 7
to 7
his 7
son 7
you 7
owe 7
your 7
life 7
to 7
your 7
mother 7
i 7
pardon 7
you 7
on 7
her 7
intercession 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
conditions 7
that 7
you 7
take 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
for 7
your 7
wife 7
and 7
not 7
your 7
slave 7
that 7
you 7
never 7
sell 7
her 7
nor 7
put 7
her 7
away 7
noureddin 7
not 7
hoping 7
for 7
so 7
great 7
indulgence 7
thanked 7
his 7
father 7
and 7
vowed 7
to 7
do 7
as 7
he 7
desired 7
khacan 7
was 7
at 7
great 7
pains 7
frequently 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
difficulties 7
attending 7
the 7
commission 7
he 7
had 7
given 7
him 7
but 7
some 7
whispers 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
actually 7
taken 7
place 7
did 7
reach 7
saouys 7
ears 7
more 7
than 7
a 7
year 7
after 7
these 7
events 7
the 7
minister 7
took 7
a 7
chill 7
leaving 7
the 7
bath 7
while 7
still 7
heated 7
to 7
go 7
out 7
on 7
important 7
business 7
this 7
resulted 7
in 7
inflammation 7
of 7
the 7
lungs 7
which 7
rapidly 7
increased 7
the 7
vizir 7
feeling 7
that 7
his 7
end 7
was 7
at 7
hand 7
sent 7
for 7
noureddin 7
and 7
charged 7
him 7
with 7
his 7
dying 7
breath 7
never 7
to 7
part 7
with 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
shortly 7
afterwards 7
he 7
expired 7
leaving 7
universal 7
regret 7
throughout 7
the 7
kingdom 7
rich 7
and 7
poor 7
alike 7
followed 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
grave 7
noureddin 7
showed 7
every 7
mark 7
of 7
the 7
deepest 7
grief 7
at 7
his 7
fathers 7
death 7
and 7
for 7
long 7
refused 7
to 7
see 7
any 7
one 7
at 7
length 7
a 7
day 7
came 7
when 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
friends 7
being 7
admitted 7
urged 7
him 7
strongly 7
to 7
be 7
consoled 7
and 7
to 7
resume 7
his 7
former 7
place 7
in 7
society 7
this 7
advice 7
noureddin 7
was 7
not 7
slow 7
to 7
follow 7
and 7
soon 7
he 7
formed 7
little 7
society 7
of 7
ten 7
young 7
men 7
all 7
about 7
his 7
own 7
age 7
with 7
whom 7
he 7
spent 7
all 7
his 7
time 7
in 7
continual 7
feasting 7
and 7
merrymaking 7
sometimes 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
consented 7
to 7
appear 7
at 7
these 7
festivities 7
but 7
she 7
disapproved 7
of 7
this 7
lavish 7
expenditure 7
and 7
did 7
not 7
scruple 7
to 7
warn 7
noureddin 7
of 7
the 7
probable 7
consequences 7
he 7
however 7
only 7
laughed 7
at 7
her 7
advice 7
saying 7
that 7
his 7
father 7
had 7
always 7
kept 7
him 7
in 7
too 7
great 7
constraint 7
and 7
that 7
now 7
he 7
rejoiced 7
at 7
his 7
newfound 7
liberty 7
what 7
added 7
to 7
the 7
confusion 7
in 7
his 7
affairs 7
was 7
that 7
he 7
refused 7
to 7
look 7
into 7
his 7
accounts 7
with 7
his 7
steward 7
sending 7
him 7
away 7
every 7
time 7
he 7
appeared 7
with 7
his 7
book 7
see 7
only 7
that 7
i 7
live 7
well 7
he 7
said 7
and 7
do 7
not 7
disturb 7
me 7
about 7
anything 7
else 7
not 7
only 7
did 7
noureddins 7
friends 7
constantly 7
partake 7
of 7
his 7
hospitality 7
but 7
in 7
every 7
way 7
they 7
took 7
advantage 7
of 7
his 7
generosity 7
everything 7
of 7
his 7
that 7
they 7
admired 7
whether 7
land 7
houses 7
baths 7
or 7
any 7
other 7
source 7
of 7
his 7
revenue 7
he 7
immediately 7
bestowed 7
on 7
them 7
in 7
vain 7
the 7
persian 7
protested 7
against 7
the 7
wrong 7
he 7
did 7
himself 7
he 7
continued 7
to 7
scatter 7
with 7
the 7
same 7
lavish 7
hand 7
throughout 7
one 7
entire 7
year 7
noureddin 7
did 7
nothing 7
but 7
amuse 7
himself 7
and 7
dissipate 7
the 7
wealth 7
his 7
father 7
had 7
taken 7
such 7
pains 7
to 7
acquire 7
the 7
year 7
had 7
barely 7
elapsed 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
as 7
they 7
sat 7
at 7
table 7
there 7
came 7
a 7
knock 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
the 7
slaves 7
having 7
been 7
sent 7
away 7
noureddin 7
went 7
to 7
open 7
it 7
himself 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
friends 7
had 7
risen 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
but 7
noureddin 7
was 7
before 7
him 7
and 7
finding 7
the 7
intruder 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
steward 7
he 7
went 7
out 7
and 7
closed 7
the 7
door 7
the 7
friend 7
curious 7
to 7
hear 7
what 7
passed 7
between 7
them 7
hid 7
himself 7
behind 7
the 7
hangings 7
and 7
heard 7
the 7
following 7
words 7
my 7
lord 7
said 7
the 7
steward 7
i 7
beg 7
a 7
thousand 7
pardons 7
for 7
interrupting 7
you 7
but 7
what 7
i 7
have 7
long 7
foreseen 7
has 7
taken 7
place 7
nothing 7
remains 7
of 7
the 7
sums 7
you 7
gave 7
me 7
for 7
your 7
expenses 7
and 7
all 7
other 7
sources 7
of 7
income 7
are 7
also 7
at 7
end 7
having 7
been 7
transferred 7
by 7
you 7
to 7
others 7
if 7
you 7
wish 7
me 7
to 7
remain 7
in 7
your 7
service 7
furnish 7
me 7
with 7
the 7
necessary 7
funds 7
else 7
i 7
must 7
withdraw 7
so 7
great 7
was 7
noureddins 7
consternation 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
a 7
word 7
to 7
say 7
in 7
reply 7
the 7
friend 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
listening 7
behind 7
the 7
curtain 7
immediately 7
hastened 7
to 7
communicate 7
the 7
news 7
to 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
company 7
if 7
this 7
is 7
so 7
they 7
said 7
we 7
must 7
cease 7
to 7
come 7
here 7
noureddin 7
reentering 7
at 7
that 7
moment 7
they 7
plainly 7
saw 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
efforts 7
to 7
dissemble 7
that 7
what 7
they 7
had 7
heard 7
was 7
the 7
truth 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
they 7
rose 7
and 7
each 7
with 7
a 7
different 7
excuse 7
left 7
the 7
room 7
till 7
presently 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
alone 7
though 7
little 7
suspecting 7
the 7
resolution 7
his 7
friends 7
had 7
taken 7
then 7
seeing 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
he 7
confided 7
to 7
her 7
the 7
statement 7
of 7
the 7
steward 7
with 7
many 7
expressions 7
of 7
regret 7
for 7
his 7
own 7
carelessness 7
had 7
i 7
but 7
followed 7
your 7
advice 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
he 7
said 7
all 7
this 7
would 7
not 7
have 7
happened 7
but 7
at 7
least 7
i 7
have 7
this 7
consolation 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
spent 7
my 7
fortune 7
in 7
the 7
company 7
of 7
friends 7
who 7
will 7
not 7
desert 7
me 7
in 7
an 7
hour 7
of 7
need 7
tomorrow 7
i 7
will 7
go 7
to 7
them 7
and 7
amongst 7
them 7
they 7
will 7
lend 7
me 7
a 7
sum 7
sufficient 7
to 7
start 7
in 7
some 7
business 7
accordingly 7
next 7
morning 7
early 7
noureddin 7
went 7
to 7
seek 7
his 7
ten 7
friends 7
who 7
all 7
lived 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
street 7
knocking 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
and 7
chief 7
the 7
slave 7
who 7
opened 7
it 7
left 7
him 7
to 7
wait 7
in 7
a 7
hall 7
while 7
he 7
announced 7
his 7
visit 7
to 7
his 7
master 7
noureddin 7
he 7
heard 7
him 7
exclaim 7
quite 7
audibly 7
tell 7
him 7
every 7
time 7
he 7
calls 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
at 7
home 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
happened 7
at 7
the 7
second 7
door 7
and 7
also 7
at 7
the 7
third 7
and 7
so 7
on 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
ten 7
noureddin 7
much 7
mortified 7
recognised 7
too 7
late 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
confided 7
in 7
false 7
friends 7
who 7
abandoned 7
him 7
in 7
his 7
hour 7
of 7
need 7
overwhelmed 7
with 7
grief 7
he 7
sought 7
consolation 7
from 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
alas 7
my 7
lord 7
she 7
said 7
at 7
last 7
you 7
are 7
convinced 7
of 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
what 7
i 7
foretold 7
there 7
is 7
now 7
no 7
other 7
resource 7
left 7
but 7
to 7
sell 7
your 7
slaves 7
and 7
your 7
furniture 7
first 7
then 7
he 7
sold 7
the 7
slaves 7
and 7
subsisted 7
for 7
a 7
time 7
on 7
the 7
proceeds 7
after 7
that 7
the 7
furniture 7
was 7
sold 7
and 7
as 7
much 7
of 7
it 7
was 7
valuable 7
it 7
sufficed 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
finally 7
this 7
resource 7
also 7
came 7
to 7
an 7
end 7
and 7
again 7
he 7
sought 7
counsel 7
from 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
my 7
lord 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
the 7
late 7
vizir 7
your 7
father 7
bought 7
me 7
for 7
gold 7
pieces 7
and 7
though 7
i 7
have 7
diminished 7
in 7
value 7
since 7
i 7
should 7
still 7
fetch 7
a 7
large 7
sum 7
do 7
not 7
therefore 7
hesitate 7
to 7
sell 7
me 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
money 7
you 7
obtain 7
go 7
and 7
establish 7
yourself 7
in 7
business 7
in 7
some 7
distant 7
town 7
charming 7
persian 7
answered 7
noureddin 7
how 7
could 7
i 7
be 7
guilty 7
of 7
such 7
baseness 7
i 7
would 7
die 7
rather 7
than 7
part 7
from 7
you 7
whom 7
i 7
love 7
better 7
than 7
my 7
life 7
my 7
lord 7
she 7
replied 7
i 7
am 7
well 7
aware 7
of 7
your 7
love 7
for 7
me 7
which 7
is 7
only 7
equalled 7
by 7
mine 7
for 7
you 7
but 7
a 7
cruel 7
necessity 7
obliges 7
us 7
to 7
seek 7
the 7
only 7
remedy 7
noureddin 7
convinced 7
at 7
length 7
of 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
her 7
words 7
yielded 7
and 7
reluctantly 7
led 7
her 7
to 7
the 7
slave 7
market 7
where 7
showing 7
her 7
to 7
a 7
dealer 7
named 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
he 7
inquired 7
her 7
value 7
taking 7
them 7
into 7
a 7
room 7
apart 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
exclaimed 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
unveiled 7
my 7
lord 7
is 7
not 7
this 7
the 7
slave 7
your 7
father 7
bought 7
for 7
pieces 7
on 7
learning 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
so 7
he 7
promised 7
to 7
obtain 7
the 7
highest 7
possible 7
price 7
for 7
her 7
leaving 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
shut 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
room 7
alone 7
he 7
went 7
ont 7
to 7
seek 7
the 7
slave 7
merchants 7
announcing 7
to 7
them 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
found 7
the 7
pearl 7
among 7
slaves 7
and 7
asking 7
them 7
to 7
come 7
and 7
put 7
a 7
value 7
upon 7
her 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
they 7
saw 7
her 7
they 7
agreed 7
that 7
less 7
than 7
gold 7
pieces 7
could 7
not 7
be 7
asked 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
then 7
closing 7
the 7
door 7
upon 7
her 7
began 7
to 7
offer 7
her 7
for 7
salecalling 7
out 7
who 7
will 7
bid 7
gold 7
pieces 7
for 7
the 7
persian 7
slave 7
before 7
any 7
of 7
the 7
merchants 7
had 7
bid 7
saouy 7
happened 7
to 7
pass 7
that 7
way 7
and 7
judging 7
that 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
a 7
slave 7
of 7
extraordinary 7
beauty 7
rode 7
up 7
to 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
and 7
desired 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
now 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
the 7
custom 7
to 7
show 7
a 7
slave 7
to 7
a 7
private 7
bidder 7
but 7
as 7
no 7
one 7
dared 7
to 7
disobey 7
the 7
vizir 7
his 7
request 7
was 7
granted 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
saouy 7
saw 7
the 7
persian 7
he 7
was 7
so 7
struck 7
by 7
her 7
beauty 7
that 7
he 7
immediately 7
wished 7
to 7
possess 7
her 7
and 7
not 7
knowing 7
that 7
she 7
belonged 7
to 7
noureddin 7
he 7
desired 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
to 7
send 7
for 7
the 7
owner 7
and 7
to 7
conclude 7
the 7
bargain 7
at 7
once 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
then 7
sought 7
noureddin 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
his 7
slave 7
was 7
going 7
far 7
below 7
her 7
value 7
and 7
that 7
if 7
saouy 7
bought 7
her 7
he 7
was 7
capable 7
of 7
not 7
paying 7
the 7
money 7
what 7
you 7
must 7
do 7
he 7
said 7
is 7
to 7
pretend 7
that 7
you 7
had 7
no 7
real 7
intention 7
of 7
selling 7
your 7
slave 7
and 7
only 7
swore 7
you 7
would 7
in 7
a 7
fit 7
of 7
anger 7
against 7
her 7
when 7
i 7
present 7
her 7
to 7
saouy 7
as 7
if 7
with 7
your 7
consent 7
you 7
must 7
step 7
in 7
and 7
with 7
blows 7
begin 7
to 7
lead 7
her 7
away 7
noureddin 7
did 7
as 7
hagi 7
hassan 7
advised 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
wrath 7
of 7
saouy 7
who 7
riding 7
straight 7
at 7
him 7
endeavoured 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
from 7
him 7
by 7
force 7
noureddin 7
letting 7
her 7
go 7
seized 7
saouys 7
horse 7
by 7
the 7
bridle 7
and 7
encouraged 7
by 7
the 7
applause 7
of 7
the 7
bystanders 7
dragged 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
ground 7
beat 7
him 7
severely 7
and 7
left 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
gutter 7
streaming 7
with 7
blood 7
then 7
taking 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
he 7
returned 7
home 7
amidst 7
the 7
acclamations 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
who 7
detested 7
saouy 7
so 7
much 7
that 7
they 7
would 7
neither 7
interfere 7
in 7
his 7
behalf 7
nor 7
allow 7
his 7
slaves 7
to 7
protect 7
him 7
covered 7
from 7
head 7
to 7
foot 7
with 7
mire 7
and 7
streaming 7
with 7
blood 7
he 7
rose 7
and 7
leaning 7
on 7
two 7
of 7
his 7
slaves 7
went 7
straight 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
he 7
demanded 7
an 7
audience 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
to 7
whom 7
he 7
related 7
what 7
had 7
taken 7
place 7
in 7
these 7
words 7
may 7
it 7
please 7
your 7
majesty 7
i 7
had 7
gone 7
to 7
the 7
slave 7
market 7
to 7
buy 7
myself 7
a 7
cook 7
while 7
there 7
i 7
heard 7
a 7
slave 7
being 7
offered 7
for 7
pieces 7
asking 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
i 7
found 7
she 7
was 7
of 7
incomparable 7
beauty 7
and 7
was 7
being 7
sold 7
by 7
noureddin 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
your 7
late 7
vizir 7
to 7
whom 7
your 7
majesty 7
will 7
remember 7
giving 7
a 7
sum 7
of 7
gold 7
pieces 7
for 7
the 7
purchase 7
of 7
a 7
slave 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
identical 7
slave 7
whom 7
instead 7
of 7
bringing 7
to 7
your 7
majesty 7
he 7
gave 7
to 7
his 7
own 7
son 7
since 7
the 7
death 7
of 7
his 7
father 7
this 7
noureddin 7
has 7
run 7
through 7
his 7
entire 7
fortune 7
has 7
sold 7
all 7
his 7
possessions 7
and 7
is 7
now 7
reduced 7
to 7
selling 7
the 7
slave 7
calling 7
him 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
said 7
noureddin 7
i 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
gold 7
pieces 7
for 7
your 7
slave 7
whom 7
i 7
will 7
present 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
will 7
interest 7
him 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
in 7
your 7
behalf 7
and 7
this 7
will 7
be 7
worth 7
much 7
more 7
to 7
you 7
than 7
what 7
extra 7
money 7
you 7
might 7
obtain 7
from 7
the 7
merchants 7
bad 7
old 7
man 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
rather 7
than 7
sell 7
my 7
slave 7
to 7
you 7
i 7
would 7
give 7
her 7
to 7
a 7
jew 7
but 7
noureddin 7
i 7
remonstrated 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
consider 7
that 7
in 7
speaking 7
thus 7
you 7
wrong 7
the 7
king 7
to 7
whom 7
your 7
father 7
owed 7
everything 7
this 7
remonstrance 7
only 7
irritated 7
him 7
the 7
more 7
throwing 7
himself 7
on 7
me 7
like 7
a 7
madman 7
he 7
tore 7
me 7
from 7
my 7
horse 7
beat 7
me 7
to 7
his 7
hearts 7
content 7
and 7
left 7
me 7
in 7
the 7
state 7

so 7
saying 7
saouy 7
turned 7
aside 7
his 7
head 7
and 7
wept 7
bitterly 7
the 7
kings 7
wrath 7
was 7
kindled 7
against 7
noureddin 7
he 7
ordered 7
the 7
captain 7
of 7
the 7
guard 7
to 7

him 7
forty 7

out 7
of 7

and 7
hastened 7
to 7
warn 7
noureddin 7
to 7
take 7
flight 7
instantly 7
with 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
then 7
presenting 7
him 7
with 7
forty 7
gold 7
pieces 7
he 7
disappeared 7
before 7
noureddin 7
had 7
time 7
to 7
thank 7
him 7
as 7
soon 7
then 7
as 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
had 7
put 7
on 7
her 7
veil 7
they 7
fled 7
together 7
and 7
had 7
the 7
good 7
fortune 7
to 7
get 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
town 7
without 7
being 7
observed 7
at 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
the 7
euphrates 7
they 7
found 7
a 7
ship 7
just 7
about 7
to 7
start 7
for 7
bagdad 7
they 7
embarked 7
and 7
immediately 7
the 7
anchor 7
was 7
raised 7
and 7
they 7
set 7
sail 7
when 7
the 7
captain 7
of 7
the 7
guard 7
reached 7
noureddins 7
house 7
he 7
caused 7
his 7
soldiers 7
to 7
burst 7
open 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
to 7
enter 7

no 7
trace 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
of 7
noureddin 7
and 7
his 7
slave 7
nor 7
could 7
the 7
neighbours 7
give 7
any 7
information 7
about 7
them 7
when 7
the 7
king 7
heard 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
escaped 7
he 7
issued 7
a 7
proclamation 7
that 7
a 7
reward 7
of 7
gold 7
pieces 7
would 7
be 7
given 7
to 7
whoever 7
would 7
bring 7
him 7
noureddin 7
and 7
the 7
slave 7
but 7
that 7
on 7
the 7
contrary 7
whoever 7
hid 7
them 7
would 7
be 7
severely 7
punished 7
meanwhile 7
noureddin 7
and 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
had 7
safely 7
reached 7
bagdad 7
when 7
the 7
vessel 7
had 7
come 7
to 7
an 7
anchor 7
they 7
paid 7
five 7
gold 7
pieces 7
for 7
their 7
passage 7
and 7
went 7
ashore 7
never 7
having 7
been 7
in 7
bagdad 7
before 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
where 7
to 7
seek 7
a 7
lodging 7
wandering 7
along 7
the 7
banks 7
of 7
the 7

skirted 7
a 7
garden 7
enclosed 7
by 7
a 7

strict 7
orders 7
to 7

very 7
careful 7

he 7
admitted 7
and 7
never 7

about 7
to 7

and 7
beautiful 7
young 7

once 7
to 7
execute 7
the 7

every 7

he 7
withdrew 7

spite 7
of 7
repeated 7
invitations 7
to 7

noureddin 7
and 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
finding 7
the 7
wine 7
excellent 7
drank 7
of 7
it 7
freely 7
and 7
while 7
drinking 7
they 7
sang 7
both 7
had 7
fine 7
voices 7
and 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
listened 7
to 7
them 7
with 7
great 7
pleasure 7
first 7
from 7
a 7
distance 7
then 7
he 7
drew 7
nearer 7
and 7
finally 7
put 7
his 7
head 7
in 7
at 7
the 7
door 7

seeing 7
him 7
called 7
to 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
in 7
and 7
keep 7
them 7
company 7
at 7
first 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
declined 7
but 7
was 7
persuaded 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
room 7
to 7
sit 7
down 7
on 7
the 7
edge 7
of 7
the 7
sofa 7
nearest 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
draw 7
closer 7
and 7
to 7
seat 7
himself 7
by 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
who 7
urged 7
him 7
so 7
persistently 7
to 7
drink 7
her 7
health 7
that 7
at 7
length 7
he 7
yielded 7
and 7
took 7
the 7
cup 7
she 7
offered 7
now 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
only 7
made 7
a 7
pretence 7
of 7
renouncing 7
wine 7
he 7
frequented 7
wineshops 7
like 7
other 7
people 7
and 7
had 7
taken 7
none 7
of 7
the 7
precautions 7
noureddin 7
had 7
proposed 7
having 7
once 7
yielded 7
he 7
was 7
easily 7
persuaded 7
to 7
take 7
a 7
second 7
cup 7
and 7
a 7
third 7
and 7
so 7
on 7
till 7
he 7
no 7
longer 7
knew 7
what 7
he 7
was 7
doing 7
till 7
near 7
midnight 7
they 7
continued 7
drinking 7
laughing 7
and 7
singing 7
together 7
about 7
that 7
time 7
the 7
persian 7
perceiving 7
that 7
the 7
room 7
was 7
lit 7
by 7
only 7
one 7
miserable 7
tallow 7
candle 7
asked 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
to 7
light 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
beautiful 7
candles 7
in 7
the 7
silver 7
arms 7
light 7
them 7
yourself 7
answered 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
you 7
are 7
younger 7
than 7
i 7
but 7
let 7
five 7
or 7
six 7
be 7
enough 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
stop 7
however 7
till 7
she 7
had 7
lit 7
all 7
the 7
eighty 7
but 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
was 7
not 7
conscious 7
of 7
this 7
and 7
when 7
soon 7
after 7
that 7
noureddin 7
proposed 7
to 7
have 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
lustres 7
lit 7
he 7
answered 7
you 7
are 7
more 7
capable 7
of 7
lighting 7
them 7
than 7
i 7
but 7
not 7
more 7
than 7
three 7
noureddin 7
far 7
from 7
contenting 7
himself 7
with 7
three 7
lit 7
all 7
and 7
opened 7
all 7
the 7
eighty 7
windows 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
chancing 7
at 7
that 7
moment 7
to 7
open 7
a 7
window 7
in 7
the 7
saloon 7
of 7
his 7
palace 7
looking 7
on 7
the 7
garden 7
was 7
surprised 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
pavilion 7
brilliantly 7
illuminated 7
calling 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
giafar 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
negligent 7
vizir 7
look 7
at 7
the 7
pavilion 7
and 7
tell 7
me 7
why 7
it 7
is 7
lit 7
up 7
when 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
there 7
when 7
the 7
vizir 7
saw 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
as 7
the 7
caliph 7
said 7
he 7
trembled 7
with 7
fear 7
and 7
immediately 7
invented 7
an 7
excuse 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
must 7
tell 7
you 7
that 7
four 7
or 7
five 7
days 7
ago 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
told 7
me 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
have 7
an 7
assembly 7
of 7
the 7
ministers 7
of 7
his 7
mosque 7
and 7
asked 7
permission 7
to 7
hold 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
pavilion 7
i 7
granted 7
his 7
request 7
but 7
forgot 7
since 7
to 7
mention 7
it 7
to 7
your 7
majesty 7
giafar 7
replied 7
the 7
caliph 7
you 7
have 7
committed 7
three 7
faults 7
first 7
in 7
giving 7
the 7
permission 7
second 7
in 7
not 7
mentioning 7
it 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
third 7
in 7
not 7
investigating 7
the 7
matter 7
more 7
closely 7
for 7
punishment 7
i 7
condemn 7
you 7
to 7
spend 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
night 7
with 7
me 7
in 7
company 7
of 7
these 7
worthy 7
people 7
while 7
i 7
dress 7
myself 7
as 7
a 7
citizen 7
go 7
and 7
disguise 7
yourself 7
and 7
then 7
come 7
with 7
me 7
when 7
they 7
reached 7
the 7
garden 7
gate 7
they 7
found 7
it 7
open 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
indignation 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
pavilion 7
being 7
also 7
open 7
he 7
went 7
softly 7
upstairs 7
and 7
looked 7
in 7
at 7
the 7
halfclosed 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
saloon 7
great 7
was 7
his 7
surprise 7
to 7
see 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
whose 7
sobriety 7
he 7
had 7
never 7
doubted 7
drinking 7
and 7
singing 7
with 7
a 7
young 7
man 7
and 7
a 7
beautiful 7
lady 7
the 7
caliph 7
before 7
giving 7
way 7
to 7
his 7
anger 7
determined 7
to 7
watch 7
and 7
see 7
who 7
the 7
people 7
were 7
and 7
what 7
they 7
did 7
presently 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
asked 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
if 7
anything 7
were 7
wanting 7
to 7
complete 7
her 7
enjoyment 7
of 7
the 7
evening 7
if 7
only 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
had 7
an 7
instrument 7
upon 7
which 7
i 7
might 7
play 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
immediately 7
took 7
a 7
lute 7
from 7
a 7
cupboard 7
and 7
gave 7
it 7
to 7
the 7
persian 7
who 7
began 7
to 7
play 7
on 7
it 7
singing 7
the 7
while 7
with 7
such 7
skill 7
and 7
taste 7
that 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
enchanted 7
when 7
she 7
ceased 7
he 7
went 7
softly 7
downstairs 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
never 7
have 7
i 7
heard 7
a 7
finer 7
voice 7
nor 7
the 7
lute 7
better 7
played 7
i 7
am 7
determined 7
to 7
go 7
in 7
and 7
make 7
her 7
play 7
to 7
me 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
said 7
the 7
vizir 7
if 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
recognises 7
you 7
he 7
will 7
die 7
of 7
fright 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
sorry 7
for 7
that 7
answered 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
going 7
to 7
take 7
steps 7
to 7
prevent 7
it 7
wait 7
here 7
till 7
i 7
return 7
now 7
the 7
caliph 7
had 7
caused 7
a 7
bend 7
in 7
the 7
river 7
to 7
form 7
a 7
lake 7
in 7
his 7
garden 7
there 7
the 7
finest 7
fish 7
in 7
the 7
tigris 7
were 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
but 7
fishing 7
was 7
strictly 7
forbidden 7
it 7
happened 7
that 7
night 7
however 7
that 7
a 7
fisherman 7
had 7
taken 7
advantage 7
of 7
the 7
gate 7
being 7
open 7
to 7
go 7
in 7
and 7
cast 7
his 7
nets 7
he 7
was 7
just 7
about 7
to 7
draw 7
them 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
caliph 7
approaching 7
recognising 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
disguise 7
he 7
threw 7

considered 7
it 7
took 7
a 7
cup 7
and 7
threw 7
it 7
at 7
the 7
caliph 7

easily 7
avoided 7
a 7
missile 7
from 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
a 7
drunken 7
man 7

and 7
put 7
on 7
him 7
that 7
which 7
they 7
had 7
brought 7
when 7
scheih 7
ibrahim 7
returned 7

thick 7
stick 7
in 7

hand 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
seated 7
on 7
his 7
throne 7
and 7
nothing 7
remained 7
of 7
the 7
fisherman 7
but 7
his 7
clothes 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
the 7
room 7
throwing 7
himself 7
on 7
the 7
ground 7
at 7
the 7
caliphs 7
feet 7
he 7
said 7

down 7
from 7
his 7
throne 7
and 7
said 7
rise 7
i 7
forgive 7
thee 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
persian 7
he 7
said 7

treated 7
with 7
all 7
honour 7
at 7
this 7
the 7
beautiful 7
persian 7
took 7
courage 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
was 7
as 7
good 7
as 7
his 7
word 7
recommending 7
her 7
to 7
the 7
care 7
of 7
his 7
wife 7
zobeida 7
noureddin 7
made 7
all 7
haste 7
on 7
his 7
journey 7
to 7
balsora 7
and 7
on 7
his 7
arrival 7
there 7
went 7
straight 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
whom 7
he 7
demanded 7
an 7
audience 7
it 7
was 7
immediately 7
granted 7
and 7
holding 7
the 7
letter 7
high 7
above 7
his 7
head 7
he 7
forced 7
his 7
way 7
through 7
the 7
crowd 7
while 7
the 7
king 7
read 7
the 7
letter 7
he 7
changed 7
colour 7
he 7
would 7
instantly 7
have 7
executed 7
the 7
caliphs 7
order 7
but 7
first 7
he 7
showed 7
the 7
letter 7
to 7
saouy 7
whose 7
interests 7
were 7
equally 7
at 7
stake 7
with 7
his 7
own 7
pretending 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
read 7
it 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
saouy 7
turned 7
aside 7
as 7
if 7
to 7
seek 7
a 7
better 7
light 7
unperceived 7
by 7
anyone 7
he 7
tore 7
off 7
the 7
formula 7
from 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
letter 7
put 7
it 7
to 7
his 7
mouth 7
and 7
swallowed 7
it 7
then 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
he 7
said 7
your 7
majesty 7
has 7
no 7
need 7
to 7
obey 7
this 7
letter 7
the 7
writing 7
is 7
indeed 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
but 7
the 7
formula 7
is 7
absent 7
besides 7
he 7
has 7
not 7
sent 7
an 7
express 7
with 7
the 7
patent 7
without 7
which 7
the 7
letter 7
is 7
useless 7
leave 7
all 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
take 7
the 7
consequences 7
the 7
king 7
not 7
only 7
listened 7
to 7
the 7
persuasions 7
of 7
saouy 7
but 7
gave 7
noureddin 7
into 7
his 7
hands 7
such 7
a 7
severe 7
bastinado 7
was 7
first 7
administered 7
to 7
him 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
left 7
more 7
dead 7
than 7
alive 7
then 7
saouy 7
threw 7
him 7
into 7
the 7
darkest 7
and 7
deepest 7
dungeon 7
and 7
fed 7
him 7
only 7
on 7
bread 7
and 7
water 7
after 7
ten 7
days 7
saouy 7
determined 7
to 7
put 7
an 7
end 7
to 7
noureddins 7
life 7
but 7
dared 7
not 7
without 7
the 7
kings 7
authority 7
to 7
gain 7
this 7
end 7
he 7
loaded 7
several 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
slaves 7
with 7
rich 7
gifts 7
and 7
presented 7
himself 7
at 7
their 7
head 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
saying 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
from 7
the 7
new 7
king 7
on 7
his 7
coronation 7
what 7
said 7
the 7
king 7
is 7

wretch 7

alive 7

and 7
behead 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
i 7
authorise 7
you 7
sire 7
said 7
saouy 7
i 7
thank 7
your 7
majesty 7
for 7
the 7
justice 7
you 7
do 7
me 7
i 7
would 7
further 7
beg 7
as 7
noureddin 7
publicly 7
affronted 7
me 7
that 7
the 7
execution 7
might 7
be 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
that 7
it 7
might 7
be 7
proclaimed 7
throughout 7
the 7
city 7
so 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
may 7
be 7
ignorant 7
of 7
it 7
the 7
king 7
granted 7
these 7
requests 7
and 7
the 7
announcement 7
caused 7
universal 7
grief 7
for 7
the 7
memory 7
of 7
noureddins 7
father 7
was 7
still 7
fresh 7
in 7
the 7
hearts 7
of 7
his 7
people 7
saouy 7
accompanied 7
by 7
twenty 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
slaves 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
prison 7
to 7
fetch 7
noureddin 7
whom 7
he 7
mounted 7
on 7
a 7
wretched 7
horse 7
without 7
a 7
saddle 7
arrived 7
at 7
the 7
palace 7
saouy 7
went 7
in 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
leaving 7
noureddin 7
in 7
the 7
square 7
hemmed 7
in 7
not 7
only 7
by 7
saouys 7
slaves 7
but 7
by 7
the 7
royal 7
guard 7
who 7
had 7
great 7
difficulty 7
in 7
preventing 7
the 7
people 7
from 7
rushing 7
in 7
and 7
rescuing 7
noureddin 7
so 7
great 7
was 7
the 7
indignation 7
against 7
saouy 7
that 7
if 7
anyone 7
had 7
set 7
the 7
example 7
he 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
stoned 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
through 7
the 7
streets 7
saouy 7
who 7
witnessed 7
the 7
agitation 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
from 7
the 7
windows 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
privy 7
chambers 7
called 7
to 7
the 7
executioner 7
to 7
strike 7
at 7
once 7
the 7
king 7
however 7
ordered 7
him 7
to 7
delay 7
not 7
only 7
was 7
he 7
jealous 7
of 7
saouys 7
interference 7
but 7
he 7
had 7
another 7
reason 7
a 7
troop 7
of 7
horsemen 7
was 7
seen 7
at 7
that 7
moment 7
riding 7
at 7
full 7
gallop 7
towards 7
the 7
square 7
saouy 7
suspected 7
who 7
they 7
might 7
be 7
and 7
urged 7
the 7
king 7
to 7
give 7
the 7
signal 7
for 7
the 7
execution 7
without 7
delay 7
but 7
this 7
the 7
king 7
refused 7
to 7
do 7
till 7
he 7
knew 7
who 7
the 7
horsemen 7
were 7
now 7
they 7
were 7
the 7
vizir 7
giafar 7
and 7
his 7
suite 7
arriving 7
at 7
full 7
speed 7
from 7
bagdad 7
for 7
several 7
days 7
after 7
noureddins 7
departure 7
with 7
the 7
letter 7
the 7
caliph 7
had 7
forgotten 7
to 7
send 7
the 7
express 7
with 7
the 7
patent 7
without 7
which 7
the 7
letter 7
was 7
useless 7
hearing 7
a 7
beautiful 7
voice 7
one 7
day 7
in 7
the 7
womens 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
uttering 7
lamentations 7
he 7
was 7
informed 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
and 7
suddenly 7
calling 7
to 7
mind 7
the 7
patent 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
giafar 7
and 7
ordered 7
him 7
to 7
make 7
for 7
balsora 7
with 7
the 7
utmost 7
speed 7
if 7
noureddin 7
were 7
dead 7
to 7
hang 7
saouy 7
if 7
he 7
were 7
still 7
alive 7
to 7
bring 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
bagdad 7
along 7
with 7
the 7
king 7
and 7
saouy 7
giafar 7
rode 7
at 7
full 7
speed 7
through 7
the 7
square 7
and 7
alighted 7
at 7
the 7
steps 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
the 7
king 7
came 7
to 7
greet 7
him 7
the 7
vizirs 7
first 7
question 7
was 7
whether 7
noureddin 7
were 7
still 7
alive 7
the 7
king 7
replied 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
and 7
he 7
was 7
immediately 7
led 7
forth 7
though 7
bound 7
hand 7
and 7
foot 7
by 7
the 7
vizirs 7
orders 7
his 7
bonds 7
were 7
immediately 7
undone 7
and 7
saouy 7
was 7
tied 7
with 7
the 7
same 7
cords 7
next 7
day 7
giafar 7
returned 7
to 7
bagdad 7
bearing 7
with 7
him 7
the 7
king 7
saouy 7
and 7
noureddin 7
when 7
the 7
caliph 7
heard 7
what 7
treatment 7
noureddin 7
had 7
received 7
he 7
authorised 7
him 7
to 7
behead 7
saouy 7
with 7
his 7
own 7
hands 7
but 7
he 7
declined 7
to 7
shed 7
the 7
blood 7
of 7
his 7
enemy 7
who 7
was 7
forthwith 7
handed 7
over 7
to 7
the 7
executioner 7
the 7
caliph 7
also 7
desired 7
noureddin 7
to 7
reign 7
over 7
balsora 7
but 7
this 7
too 7
he 7
declined 7
saying 7
that 7
after 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
there 7
he 7
preferred 7
never 7
to 7
return 7
but 7
to 7
enter 7
the 7
service 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
he 7
became 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
most 7
intimate 7
courtiers 7
and 7
lived 7
long 7
in 7
great 7
happiness 7
with 7
the 7
fair 7
persian 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
the 7
caliph 7
contented 7
himself 7
with 7
sending 7
him 7
back 7
to 7
balsora 7
with 7
the 7
recommendation 7
to 7
be 7
more 7
careful 7
in 7
future 7
in 7
the 7
choice 7
of 7
his 7
vizir 7
aladdin 7
and 7
the 7
wonderful 7
lamp 7
there 7
once 7
lived 7
a 7
poor 7
tailor 7
who 7
had 7
a 7
son 7
called 7
aladdin 7
a 7
careless 7
idle 7
boy 7
who 7
would 7
do 7
nothing 7
but 7
play 7
all 7
day 7
long 7
in 7
the 7
streets 7
with 7
little 7
idle 7
boys 7
like 7
himself 7
this 7
so 7
grieved 7
the 7
father 7
that 7
he 7
died 7
yet 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
mothers 7
tears 7
and 7
prayers 7
aladdin 7
did 7
not 7
mend 7
his 7
ways 7
one 7
day 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
playing 7
in 7
the 7
streets 7
as 7
usual 7
a 7
stranger 7
asked 7
him 7
his 7
age 7
and 7
if 7
he 7
were 7
not 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
mustapha 7
the 7
tailor 7
i 7
am 7
sir 7
replied 7
aladdin 7
but 7
he 7
died 7
a 7
long 7
while 7
ago 7
on 7
this 7
the 7
stranger 7
who 7
was 7
a 7
famous 7
african 7
magician 7
fell 7
on 7
his 7
neck 7
and 7
kissed 7
him 7
saying 7
i 7
am 7
your 7
uncle 7
and 7
knew 7
you 7
from 7
your 7
likeness 7
to 7

to 7
your 7
mother 7
and 7
tell 7
her 7
i 7
am 7
coming 7
aladdin 7
ran 7
home 7
and 7
told 7
his 7
mother 7
of 7
his 7
newly 7
found 7
uncle 7
indeed 7
child 7
she 7
said 7
your 7
father 7
had 7
a 7
brother 7
but 7
i 7
always 7
thought 7
he 7
was 7
dead 7
however 7
she 7
prepared 7
supper 7
and 7
bade 7
aladdin 7
seek 7
his 7
uncle 7
who 7
came 7
laden 7
with 7
wine 7
and 7
fruit 7
he 7
presently 7
fell 7
down 7
and 7
kissed 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
mustapha 7
used 7
to 7
sit 7
bidding 7
aladdins 7
mother 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
surprised 7
at 7
not 7
having 7
seen 7
him 7
before 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
forty 7
years 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
country 7
he 7
then 7
turned 7
to 7
aladdin 7
and 7
asked 7
him 7
his 7
trade 7
at 7
which 7
the 7
boy 7
hung 7
his 7
head 7
while 7
his 7
mother 7
burst 7
into 7
tears 7
on 7
learning 7
that 7
aladdin 7
was 7
idle 7
and 7
would 7
learn 7
no 7
trade 7
he 7
offered 7
to 7
take 7
a 7
shop 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
stock 7
it 7
with 7
merchandise 7
next 7
day 7
he 7
bought 7
aladdin 7
a 7
fine 7
suit 7
of 7
clothes 7
and 7
took 7
him 7
all 7
over 7
the 7
city 7
showing 7
him 7
the 7
sights 7
and 7
brought 7
him 7
home 7
at 7
nightfall 7
to 7
his 7
mother 7
who 7
was 7
overjoyed 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
son 7
so 7
fine 7
next 7
day 7
the 7
magician 7
led 7
aladdin 7
into 7
some 7
beautiful 7
gardens 7
a 7
long 7
way 7
outside 7
the 7
city 7
gates 7
they 7
sat 7
down 7
by 7
a 7
fountain 7
and 7
the 7
magician 7
pulled 7
a 7
cake 7
from 7
his 7
girdle 7
which 7
he 7
divided 7
between 7
them 7
they 7
then 7
journeyed 7
onwards 7
till 7
they 7
almost 7
reached 7
the 7
mountains 7
aladdin 7
was 7
so 7
tired 7
that 7
he 7
begged 7
to 7
go 7
back 7
but 7
the 7
magician 7
beguiled 7
him 7
with 7
pleasant 7
stories 7
and 7
led 7
him 7
on 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
himself 7
at 7
last 7
they 7
came 7
to 7
two 7
mountains 7
divided 7
by 7
a 7
narrow 7
valley 7
we 7
will 7
go 7
no 7
farther 7
said 7
the 7
false 7
uncle 7
i 7
will 7
show 7
you 7
something 7
wonderful 7
only 7
do 7
you 7
gather 7
up 7
sticks 7
while 7
i 7
kindle 7
a 7
fire 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
lit 7
the 7
magician 7
threw 7
on 7
it 7
a 7
powder 7
he 7
had 7
about 7
him 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
saying 7
some 7
magical 7
words 7
the 7
earth 7
trembled 7
a 7
little 7
and 7
opened 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
them 7
disclosing 7
a 7
square 7
flat 7
stone 7
with 7
a 7
brass 7
ring 7
in 7
the 7
middle 7
to 7
raise 7
it 7
by 7
aladdin 7
tried 7
to 7
run 7
away 7
but 7
the 7
magician 7
caught 7
him 7
and 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
blow 7
that 7
knocked 7
him 7
down 7
what 7
have 7
i 7
done 7
uncle 7
he 7
said 7
piteously 7
whereupon 7
the 7
magician 7
said 7
more 7
kindly 7
fear 7
nothing 7
but 7
obey 7
me 7
beneath 7
this 7
stone 7
lies 7
a 7
treasure 7
which 7
is 7
to 7
be 7
yours 7
and 7
no 7
one 7
else 7
may 7
touch 7
it 7
so 7
you 7
must 7
do 7
exactly 7
as 7
i 7
tell 7
you 7
at 7
the 7
word 7
treasure 7
aladdin 7
forgot 7
his 7
fears 7
and 7
grasped 7
the 7
ring 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
told 7
saying 7
the 7
names 7
of 7
his 7
father 7
and 7
grandfather 7
the 7
stone 7
came 7
up 7
quite 7
easily 7
and 7
some 7
steps 7
appeared 7
go 7
down 7
said 7
the 7
magician 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
those 7
steps 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
an 7
open 7
door 7
leading 7
into 7
three 7
large 7
halls 7
tuck 7
up 7
your 7
gown 7
and 7
go 7
through 7
them 7
without 7
touching 7
anything 7
or 7
you 7
will 7
die 7
instantly 7
these 7
halls 7
lead 7
into 7
a 7
garden 7
of 7
fine 7
fruit 7
trees 7
walk 7
on 7
till 7
you 7
come 7
to 7
a 7
niche 7
in 7
a 7
terrace 7
where 7
stands 7
a 7
lighted 7
lamp 7
pour 7
out 7
the 7
oil 7
it 7
contains 7
and 7
bring 7
it 7
to 7
me 7
he 7
drew 7
a 7
ring 7
from 7
his 7
finger 7
and 7
gave 7
it 7
to 7
aladdin 7
bidding 7
him 7
prosper 7
aladdin 7
found 7
everything 7
as 7
the 7
magician 7
had 7
said 7
gathered 7
some 7
fruit 7
off 7
the 7
trees 7
and 7
having 7
got 7
the 7
lamp 7
arrived 7
at 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
the 7
cave 7
the 7
magician 7
cried 7
out 7
in 7
a 7
great 7
hurry 7
make 7
haste 7
and 7
give 7
me 7
the 7
lamp 7
this 7
aladdin 7
refused 7
to 7
do 7
until 7
he 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
cave 7
the 7
magician 7
flew 7
into 7
a 7
terrible 7
passion 7
and 7
throwing 7
some 7
more 7
powder 7
on 7
the 7
fire 7
he 7
said 7
something 7
and 7
the 7
stone 7
rolled 7
back 7
into 7
its 7
place 7
the 7
magician 7
left 7
persia 7
for 7
ever 7
which 7
plainly 7
showed 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
no 7
uncle 7
of 7
aladdins 7
but 7
a 7
cunning 7
magician 7
who 7
had 7
read 7
in 7
his 7
magic 7
books 7
of 7
a 7
wonderful 7
lamp 7
which 7
would 7
make 7
him 7
the 7
most 7
powerful 7
man 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
though 7
he 7
alone 7
knew 7
where 7
to 7
find 7
it 7
he 7
could 7
only 7
receive 7
it 7
from 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
another 7
he 7
had 7
picked 7
out 7
the 7
foolish 7
aladdin 7
for 7
this 7
purpose 7
intending 7
to 7
get 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
kill 7
him 7
afterwards 7
for 7
two 7
days 7
aladdin 7
remained 7
in 7
the 7
dark 7
crying 7
and 7
lamenting 7
at 7
last 7
he 7
clasped 7
his 7
hands 7
in 7
prayer 7
and 7
in 7
so 7
doing 7
rubbed 7
the 7
ring 7
which 7
the 7
magician 7
had 7
forgotten 7
to 7
take 7
from 7
him 7
immediately 7
an 7
enormous 7
and 7
frightful 7
genie 7
rose 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
earth 7
saying 7
what 7
wouldst 7
thou 7
with 7
me 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
slave 7
of 7
the 7
ring 7
and 7
will 7
obey 7
thee 7
in 7
all 7
things 7
aladdin 7
fearlessly 7
replied 7
deliver 7
me 7
from 7
this 7
place 7
whereupon 7
the 7
earth 7
opened 7
and 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
outside 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
his 7
eyes 7
could 7
bear 7
the 7
light 7
he 7
went 7
home 7
but 7
fainted 7
on 7
the 7
threshold 7
when 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
himself 7
he 7
told 7
his 7
mother 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
and 7
showed 7
her 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
the 7
fruits 7
he 7
had 7
gathered 7
in 7
the 7
garden 7
which 7
were 7
in 7
reality 7
precious 7
stones 7
he 7
then 7
asked 7
for 7
some 7
food 7
alas 7
child 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
have 7
nothing 7
in 7
the 7
house 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
spun 7
a 7
little 7
cotton 7
and 7
will 7
go 7
and 7
sell 7
it 7
aladdin 7
bade 7
her 7
keep 7
her 7
cotton 7
for 7
he 7
would 7
sell 7
the 7
lamp 7
instead 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
very 7
dirty 7
she 7
began 7
to 7
rub 7
it 7
that 7
it 7
might 7
fetch 7
a 7
higher 7
price 7
instantly 7
a 7
hideous 7
genie 7
appeared 7
and 7
asked 7
what 7
she 7
would 7
have 7
she 7
fainted 7
away 7
but 7
aladdin 7
snatching 7
the 7
lamp 7
said 7
boldly 7
fetch 7
me 7
something 7
to 7
eat 7
the 7
genie 7
returned 7
with 7
a 7
silver 7
bowl 7
twelve 7
silver 7
plates 7
containing 7
rich 7
meats 7
two 7
silver 7
cups 7
and 7
two 7
bottles 7
of 7
wine 7
aladdins 7
mother 7
when 7
she 7
came 7
to 7
herself 7
said 7
whence 7
comes 7
this 7
splendid 7
feast 7
ask 7
not 7
but 7
eat 7
replied 7
aladdin 7
so 7
they 7
sat 7
at 7
breakfast 7
till 7
it 7
was 7
dinnertime 7
and 7
aladdin 7
told 7
his 7
mother 7
about 7
the 7
lamp 7
she 7
begged 7
him 7
to 7
sell 7
it 7
and 7
have 7
nothing 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
devils 7
no 7
said 7
aladdin 7
since 7
chance 7
has 7
made 7
us 7
aware 7
of 7
its 7
virtues 7
we 7
will 7
use 7
it 7
and 7
the 7
ring 7
likewise 7
which 7
i 7
shall 7
always 7
wear 7
on 7
my 7
finger 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
eaten 7
all 7
the 7
genie 7
had 7
brought 7
aladdin 7
sold 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
silver 7
plates 7
and 7
so 7
on 7
till 7
none 7
were 7
left 7
he 7
then 7
had 7
recourse 7
to 7
the 7
genie 7
who 7
gave 7
him 7
another 7
set 7
of 7
plates 7
and 7
thus 7
they 7
lived 7
for 7
many 7
years 7
one 7
day 7
aladdin 7
heard 7
an 7
order 7
from 7
the 7
sultan 7
proclaimed 7
that 7
everyone 7
was 7
to 7
stay 7
at 7
home 7
and 7
close 7
his 7
shutters 7
while 7
the 7
princess 7
his 7
daughter 7
went 7
to 7
and 7
from 7
the 7
bath 7
aladdin 7
was 7
seized 7
by 7
a 7
desire 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
face 7
which 7
was 7
very 7
difficult 7
as 7
she 7
always 7
went 7
veiled 7
he 7
hid 7
himself 7
behind 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
bath 7
and 7
peeped 7
through 7
a 7
chink 7
the 7
princess 7
lifted 7
her 7
veil 7
as 7
she 7
went 7
in 7
and 7
looked 7
so 7
beautiful 7
that 7
aladdin 7
fell 7
in 7
love 7
with 7
her 7
at 7
first 7
sight 7
he 7
went 7
home 7
so 7
changed 7
that 7
his 7
mother 7
was 7
frightened 7
he 7
told 7
her 7
he 7
loved 7
the 7
princess 7
so 7
deeply 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
live 7
without 7
her 7
and 7
meant 7
to 7
ask 7
her 7
in 7
marriage 7
of 7
her 7
father 7
his 7
mother 7
on 7
hearing 7
this 7
burst 7
out 7
laughing 7
but 7
aladdin 7
at 7
last 7
prevailed 7
upon 7
her 7
to 7
go 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
carry 7
his 7
request 7
she 7
fetched 7
a 7
napkin 7
and 7
laid 7
in 7
it 7
the 7
magic 7
fruits 7
from 7
the 7
enchanted 7
garden 7
which 7
sparkled 7
and 7
shone 7
like 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
jewels 7
she 7
took 7
these 7
with 7
her 7
to 7
please 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
set 7
out 7
trusting 7
in 7
the 7
lamp 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
and 7
the 7
lords 7
of 7
council 7
had 7
just 7
gone 7
in 7
as 7
she 7
entered 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
placed 7
herself 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
he 7
however 7
took 7
no 7
notice 7
of 7
her 7
she 7
went 7
every 7
day 7
for 7
a 7
week 7
and 7
stood 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
place 7
when 7
the 7
council 7
broke 7
up 7
on 7
the 7
sixth 7
day 7
the 7
sultan 7
said 7
to 7
his 7
vizir 7
i 7
see 7
a 7
certain 7
woman 7
in 7
the 7
audiencechamber 7
every 7
day 7
carrying 7
something 7
in 7
a 7
napkin 7
call 7
her 7
next 7
time 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
find 7
out 7
what 7
she 7
wants 7
next 7
day 7
at 7
a 7
sign 7
from 7
the 7
vizir 7
she 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
throne 7
and 7
remained 7
kneeling 7
till 7
the 7
sultan 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
rise 7
good 7
woman 7
and 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
you 7
want 7
she 7
hesitated 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
sent 7
away 7
all 7
but 7
the 7
vizir 7
and 7
bade 7
her 7
speak 7
freely 7
promising 7
to 7
forgive 7
her 7
beforehand 7
for 7
anything 7
she 7
might 7
say 7
she 7
then 7
told 7
him 7
of 7
her 7
sons 7
violent 7
love 7
for 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
prayed 7
him 7
to 7
forget 7
her 7
she 7
said 7
but 7
in 7
vain 7
he 7
threatened 7
to 7
do 7
some 7
desperate 7
deed 7
if 7
i 7
refused 7
to 7
go 7
and 7
ask 7
your 7
majesty 7
for 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
now 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
forgive 7
not 7
me 7
alone 7
but 7
my 7
son 7
aladdin 7
the 7
sultan 7
asked 7
her 7
kindly 7
what 7
she 7
had 7
in 7
the 7
napkin 7
whereupon 7
she 7
unfolded 7
the 7
jewels 7
and 7
presented 7
them 7
he 7
was 7
thunderstruck 7
and 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
said 7
what 7
sayest 7
thou 7
ought 7
i 7
not 7
to 7
bestow 7
the 7
princess 7
on 7
one 7
who 7
values 7
her 7
at 7
such 7
a 7
price 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
wanted 7
her 7
for 7
his 7
own 7
son 7
begged 7
the 7
sultan 7
to 7
withhold 7
her 7
for 7
three 7
months 7
in 7
the 7
course 7
of 7
which 7
he 7
hoped 7
his 7
son 7
would 7
contrive 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
a 7
richer 7
present 7
the 7
sultan 7
granted 7
this 7
and 7
told 7
aladdins 7
mother 7
that 7
though 7
he 7
consented 7
to 7
the 7
marriage 7
she 7
must 7
not 7
appear 7
before 7
him 7
again 7
for 7
three 7
months 7
aladdin 7
waited 7
patiently 7
for 7
nearly 7
three 7
months 7
but 7
after 7
two 7
had 7
elapsed 7
his 7
mother 7
going 7
into 7
the 7
city 7
to 7
buy 7
oil 7
found 7
everyone 7
rejoicing 7
and 7
asked 7
what 7
was 7
going 7
on 7
do 7
you 7
not 7
know 7
was 7
the 7
answer 7
that 7
the 7
son 7
of 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
is 7
to 7
marry 7
the 7
sultans 7
daughter 7
tonight 7
breathless 7
she 7
ran 7
and 7
told 7
aladdin 7
who 7
was 7
overwhelmed 7
at 7
first 7
but 7
presently 7
bethought 7
him 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
he 7
rubbed 7
it 7
and 7
the 7
genie 7
appeared 7
saying 7
what 7
is 7
thy 7
will 7
aladdin 7
replied 7
the 7
sultan 7
as 7
thou 7
knowest 7
has 7
broken 7
his 7
promise 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
the 7
vizirs 7
son 7
is 7
to 7
have 7
the 7
princess 7
my 7
command 7
is 7
that 7
tonight 7
you 7
bring 7
hither 7
the 7
bride 7
and 7
bridegroom 7
master 7
i 7
obey 7
said 7
the 7
genie 7
aladdin 7
then 7
went 7
to 7
his 7
chamber 7
where 7
sure 7
enough 7
at 7
midnight 7
the 7
genie 7
transported 7
the 7
bed 7
containing 7
the 7
vizirs 7
son 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
take 7
this 7
newmarried 7
man 7
he 7
said 7
and 7
put 7
him 7
outside 7
in 7
the 7
cold 7
and 7
return 7
at 7
daybreak 7
whereupon 7
the 7
genie 7
took 7
the 7
vizirs 7
son 7
out 7
of 7
bed 7
leaving 7
aladdin 7
with 7
the 7
princess 7
fear 7
nothing 7
aladdin 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
you 7
are 7
my 7
wife 7
promised 7
to 7
me 7
by 7
your 7
unjust 7
father 7
and 7
no 7
harm 7
shall 7
come 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
too 7
frightened 7
to 7
speak 7
and 7
passed 7
the 7
most 7
miserable 7
night 7
of 7
her 7
life 7
while 7
aladdin 7
lay 7
down 7
beside 7
her 7
and 7
slept 7
soundly 7
at 7
the 7
appointed 7
hour 7
the 7
genie 7
fetched 7
in 7
the 7
shivering 7
bridegroom 7
laid 7
him 7
in 7
his 7
place 7
and 7
transported 7
the 7
bed 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
presently 7
the 7
sultan 7
came 7
to 7
wish 7
his 7
daughter 7
goodmorning 7
the 7
unhappy 7
vizirs 7
son 7
jumped 7
up 7
and 7
hid 7
himself 7
while 7
the 7
princess 7
would 7
not 7
say 7
a 7
word 7
and 7
was 7
very 7
sorrowful 7
the 7
sultan 7
sent 7
her 7
mother 7
to 7
her 7
who 7
said 7
how 7
comes 7
it 7
child 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
speak 7
to 7
your 7
father 7
what 7
has 7
happened 7
the 7
princess 7
sighed 7
deeply 7
and 7
at 7
last 7
told 7
her 7
mother 7
how 7
during 7
the 7
night 7
the 7
bed 7
had 7
been 7
carried 7
into 7
some 7
strange 7
house 7
and 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
there 7
her 7
mother 7
did 7
not 7
believe 7
her 7
in 7
the 7
least 7
but 7
bade 7
her 7
rise 7
and 7
consider 7
it 7
an 7
idle 7
dream 7
the 7
following 7
night 7
exactly 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
happened 7
and 7
next 7
morning 7
on 7
the 7
princesss 7
refusing 7
to 7
speak 7
the 7
sultan 7
threatened 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
her 7
head 7
she 7
then 7
confessed 7
all 7
bidding 7
him 7
ask 7
the 7
vizirs 7
son 7
if 7
it 7
were 7
not 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
told 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
ask 7
his 7
son 7
who 7
owned 7
the 7
truth 7
adding 7
that 7
dearly 7
as 7
he 7
loved 7
the 7
princess 7
he 7
had 7
rather 7
die 7
than 7
go 7
through 7
another 7
such 7
fearful 7
night 7
and 7
wished 7
to 7
be 7
separated 7
from 7
her 7
his 7
wish 7
was 7
granted 7
and 7
there 7
was 7
an 7
end 7
of 7
feasting 7
and 7
rejoicing 7
when 7
the 7
three 7
months 7
were 7
over 7
aladdin 7
sent 7
his 7
mother 7
to 7
remind 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
his 7
promise 7
she 7
stood 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
place 7
as 7
before 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
had 7
forgotten 7
aladdin 7
at 7
once 7
remembered 7
him 7
and 7
sent 7
for 7
her 7
on 7
seeing 7
her 7
poverty 7
the 7
sultan 7
felt 7
less 7
inclined 7
than 7
ever 7
to 7
keep 7
his 7
word 7
and 7
asked 7
the 7
vizirs 7
advice 7
who 7
counselled 7
him 7
to 7
set 7
so 7
high 7
a 7
value 7
on 7
the 7
princess 7
that 7
no 7
man 7
living 7
could 7
come 7
up 7
to 7
it 7
the 7

of 7
aladdin 7
who 7

cried 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
worlds 7
wonder 7
there 7
is 7
only 7
one 7
thing 7
that 7
surprises 7
me 7
was 7
it 7
by 7
accident 7
that 7
one 7
window 7
was 7
left 7
unfinished 7
no 7
sir 7
by 7
design 7
returned 7
aladdin 7
i 7
wished 7
your 7
majesty 7
to 7
have 7
the 7
glory 7
of 7
finishing 7
this 7
palace 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
pleased 7
and 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
best 7
jewelers 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
he 7
showed 7
them 7
the 7
unfinished 7
window 7
and 7
bade 7
them 7
fit 7
it 7
up 7
like 7
the 7
others 7
sir 7
replied 7
their 7
spokesman 7
we 7
cannot 7
find 7
jewels 7
enough 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
his 7
own 7
fetched 7
which 7
they 7
soon 7
used 7
but 7
to 7
no 7
purpose 7
for 7
in 7
a 7
months 7
time 7
the 7
work 7
was 7
not 7
half 7
done 7
aladdin 7
knowing 7
that 7
their 7
task 7
was 7
vain 7
bade 7
them 7
undo 7
their 7
work 7
and 7
carry 7
the 7
jewels 7
back 7
and 7
the 7
genie 7
finished 7
the 7
window 7
at 7
his 7
command 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
surprised 7
to 7
receive 7
his 7
jewels 7
again 7
and 7
visited 7
aladdin 7
who 7
showed 7
him 7
the 7
window 7
finished 7
the 7
sultan 7
embraced 7
him 7
the 7
envious 7
vizir 7
meanwhile 7
hinting 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
work 7
of 7
enchantment 7
aladdin 7
had 7
won 7
the 7
hearts 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
by 7
his 7
gentle 7
bearing 7
he 7
was 7
made 7
captain 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
armies 7
and 7
won 7
several 7
battles 7
for 7
him 7
but 7
remained 7
modest 7
and 7
courteous 7
as 7
before 7
and 7
lived 7
thus 7
in 7
peace 7
and 7
content 7
for 7
several 7
years 7
but 7
far 7
away 7
in 7
africa 7
the 7
magician 7
remembered 7
aladdin 7
and 7
by 7
his 7
magic 7
arts 7
discovered 7
that 7
aladdin 7
instead 7
of 7
perishing 7
miserably 7
in 7
the 7
cave 7
had 7
escaped 7
and 7
had 7
married 7
a 7
princess 7
with 7
whom 7
he 7
was 7
living 7
in 7
great 7
honour 7
and 7
wealth 7
he 7
knew 7
that 7
the 7
poor 7
tailors 7
son 7
could 7
only 7
have 7
accomplished 7
this 7
by 7
means 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
travelled 7
night 7
and 7
day 7
till 7
he 7
reached 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
china 7
bent 7
on 7
aladdins 7
ruin 7
as 7
he 7
passed 7
through 7
the 7
town 7
he 7
heard 7
people 7
talking 7
everywhere 7
about 7
a 7
marvellous 7
palace 7
forgive 7
my 7
ignorance 7
he 7
asked 7
what 7
is 7
this 7
palace 7
you 7
speak 7
of 7
have 7
you 7
not 7
heard 7
of 7
prince 7
aladdins 7
palace 7
was 7
the 7
reply 7
the 7
greatest 7
wonder 7
of 7
the 7
world 7
i 7
will 7
direct 7
you 7
if 7
you 7
have 7
a 7
mind 7
to 7
see 7
it 7
the 7
magician 7
thanked 7
him 7
who 7
spoke 7
and 7
having 7
seen 7
the 7
palace 7
knew 7
that 7
it 7
had 7
been 7
raised 7
by 7
the 7
genie 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
became 7
half 7
mad 7
with 7
rage 7
he 7
determined 7
to 7
get 7
hold 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
again 7
plunge 7
aladdin 7
into 7
the 7
deepest 7
poverty 7
unluckily 7
aladdin 7
had 7
gone 7
ahunting 7
for 7
eight 7
days 7
which 7
gave 7
the 7
magician 7
plenty 7
of 7
time 7
he 7
bought 7
a 7
dozen 7
copper 7
lamps 7
put 7
them 7
into 7
a 7
basket 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
crying 7
new 7
lamps 7
for 7
old 7
followed 7
by 7
a 7
jeering 7
crowd 7
the 7
princess 7
sitting 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
of 7
fourandtwenty 7
windows 7
sent 7
a 7
slave 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
what 7
the 7
noise 7
was 7
about 7
who 7
came 7
back 7
laughing 7
so 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
scolded 7
her 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
slave 7
who 7
can 7
help 7
laughing 7
to 7
see 7
an 7
old 7
fool 7
offering 7
to 7
exchange 7
fine 7
new 7
lamps 7
for 7
old 7
ones 7
another 7
slave 7
hearing 7
this 7
said 7
there 7
is 7
an 7
old 7
one 7
on 7
the 7
cornice 7
there 7
which 7
he 7
can 7
have 7
now 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
magic 7
lamp 7
which 7
aladdin 7
had 7
left 7
there 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
take 7
it 7
out 7
hunting 7
with 7
him 7
the 7
princess 7
not 7
knowing 7
its 7
value 7
laughingly 7
bade 7
the 7
slave 7
take 7
it 7
and 7
make 7
the 7
exchange 7
she 7
went 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
magician 7
give 7
me 7
a 7
new 7
lamp 7
for 7
this 7
he 7
snatched 7
it 7
and 7
bade 7
the 7
slave 7
take 7
her 7
choice 7
amid 7
the 7
jeers 7
of 7
the 7
crowd 7
little 7
he 7
cared 7
but 7
left 7
off 7
crying 7
his 7
lamps 7
and 7
went 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
city 7
gates 7
to 7
a 7
lonely 7
place 7
where 7
he 7
remained 7
till 7
nightfall 7
when 7
he 7
pulled 7
out 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
rubbed 7
it 7
the 7
genie 7
appeared 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
magicians 7
command 7
carried 7
him 7
together 7
with 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
it 7
to 7
a 7
lonely 7
place 7
in 7
africa 7
next 7
morning 7
the 7
sultan 7
looked 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
window 7
towards 7
aladdins 7
palace 7
and 7
rubbed 7
his 7
eyes 7
for 7
it 7
was 7
gone 7
he 7
sent 7
for 7
the 7
vizir 7
and 7
asked 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
vizir 7
looked 7
out 7
too 7
and 7
was 7
lost 7
in 7
astonishment 7
he 7
again 7
put 7
it 7
down 7
to 7
enchantment 7
and 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
sultan 7
believed 7
him 7
and 7
sent 7
thirty 7
men 7
on 7
horseback 7
to 7
fetch 7
aladdin 7
in 7
chains 7
they 7
met 7
him 7
riding 7
home 7
bound 7
him 7
and 7
forced 7
him 7
to 7
go 7
with 7
them 7
on 7
foot 7
the 7
people 7
however 7
who 7
loved 7
him 7
followed 7
armed 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
no 7
harm 7
he 7
was 7
carried 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
ordered 7
the 7
executioner 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
his 7
head 7
the 7
executioner 7
made 7
aladdin 7
kneel 7
down 7
bandaged 7
his 7
eyes 7
and 7
raised 7
his 7
scimitar 7
to 7
strike 7
at 7
that 7
instant 7
the 7
vizir 7
who 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
crowd 7
had 7
forced 7
their 7
way 7
into 7
the 7
courtyard 7
and 7
were 7
scaling 7
the 7
walls 7
to 7
rescue 7
aladdin 7
called 7
to 7
the 7
executioner 7
to 7
stay 7
his 7
hand 7
the 7
people 7
indeed 7
looked 7
so 7
threatening 7
that 7
the 7
sultan 7
gave 7
way 7
and 7
ordered 7
aladdin 7
to 7
be 7
unbound 7
and 7
pardoned 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
crowd 7
aladdin 7
now 7
begged 7
to 7
know 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
false 7
wretch 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
come 7
hither 7
and 7
showed 7
him 7
from 7
the 7
window 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
his 7
palace 7
had 7
stood 7
aladdin 7
was 7
so 7
amazed 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
say 7
a 7
word 7
where 7
is 7
my 7
palace 7
and 7
my 7
daughter 7
demanded 7
the 7
sultan 7
for 7
the 7
first 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
so 7
deeply 7
concerned 7
but 7
my 7
daughter 7
i 7
must 7
have 7
and 7
you 7
must 7
find 7
her 7
or 7
lose 7
your 7
head 7
aladdin 7
begged 7
for 7
forty 7
days 7
in 7
which 7
to 7
find 7
her 7
promising 7
if 7
he 7
failed 7
to 7
return 7
and 7
suffer 7
death 7
at 7
the 7
sultans 7
pleasure 7
his 7
prayer 7
was 7
granted 7
and 7
he 7
went 7
forth 7
sadly 7
from 7
the 7
sultans 7
presence 7
for 7
three 7
days 7
he 7
wandered 7
about 7
like 7
a 7
madman 7
asking 7
everyone 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
his 7
palace 7
but 7
they 7
only 7
laughed 7
and 7
pitied 7
him 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
banks 7
of 7
a 7
river 7
and 7
knelt 7
down 7
to 7
say 7
his 7
prayers 7
before 7
throwing 7
himself 7
in 7
in 7
so 7
doing 7
he 7
rubbed 7
the 7
magic 7
ring 7
he 7
still 7
wore 7
the 7
genie 7
he 7
had 7
seen 7
in 7
the 7
cave 7
appeared 7
and 7
asked 7
his 7
will 7
save 7
my 7
life 7
genie 7
said 7
aladdin 7
and 7
bring 7
my 7
palace 7
back 7
that 7
is 7
not 7
in 7
my 7
power 7
said 7
the 7
genie 7
i 7
am 7
only 7
the 7
slave 7
of 7
the 7
ring 7
you 7
must 7
ask 7
the 7
slave 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
even 7
so 7
said 7
aladdin 7
but 7
thou 7
canst 7
take 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
set 7
me 7
down 7
under 7
my 7
dear 7
wifes 7
window 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
found 7
himself 7
in 7
africa 7
under 7
the 7
window 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
fell 7
asleep 7
out 7
of 7
sheer 7
weariness 7
he 7
was 7
awakened 7
by 7
the 7
singing 7
of 7
the 7
birds 7
and 7
his 7
heart 7
was 7
lighter 7
he 7
saw 7
plainly 7
that 7
all 7
his 7
misfortunes 7
were 7
owing 7
to 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
vainly 7
wondered 7
who 7
had 7
robbed 7
him 7
of 7
it 7
that 7
morning 7
the 7
princess 7
rose 7
earlier 7
than 7
she 7
had 7
done 7
since 7
she 7
had 7
been 7
carried 7
into 7
africa 7
by 7
the 7
magician 7
whose 7
company 7
she 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
endure 7
once 7
a 7
day 7
she 7
however 7
treated 7
him 7
so 7
harshly 7
that 7
he 7
dared 7
not 7
live 7
there 7
altogether 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
dressing 7
one 7
of 7
her 7
women 7
looked 7
out 7
and 7
saw 7
aladdin 7
the 7
princess 7
ran 7
and 7
opened 7
the 7
window 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
noise 7
she 7
made 7
aladdin 7
looked 7
up 7
she 7
called 7
to 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
great 7
was 7
the 7
joy 7
of 7
these 7
lovers 7
at 7
seeing 7
each 7
other 7
again 7
after 7
he 7
had 7
kissed 7
her 7
aladdin 7
said 7
i 7
beg 7
of 7
you 7
princess 7
in 7
gods 7
name 7
before 7
we 7
speak 7
of 7
anything 7
else 7
for 7
your 7
own 7
sake 7
and 7
mine 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
has 7
become 7
of 7
an 7
old 7
lamp 7
i 7
left 7
on 7
the 7
cornice 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
of 7
fourandtwenty 7
windows 7
when 7
i 7
went 7
ahunting 7
alas 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
innocent 7
cause 7
of 7
our 7
sorrows 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
of 7
the 7
exchange 7
of 7
the 7
lamp 7
now 7
i 7
know 7
cried 7
aladdin 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
to 7
thank 7
the 7
african 7
magician 7
for 7
this 7
where 7
is 7
the 7
lamp 7
he 7
carries 7
it 7
about 7
with 7
him 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
know 7
for 7
he 7
pulled 7
it 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
breast 7
to 7
show 7
me 7
he 7
wishes 7
me 7
to 7
break 7
my 7
faith 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
marry 7
him 7
saying 7
that 7
you 7
were 7
beheaded 7
by 7
my 7
fathers 7
command 7
he 7
is 7
forever 7
speaking 7
ill 7
of 7
you 7
but 7
i 7
only 7
reply 7
by 7
my 7
tears 7
if 7
i 7
persist 7
i 7
doubt 7
not 7
that 7
he 7
will 7
use 7
violence 7
aladdin 7
comforted 7
her 7
and 7
left 7
her 7
for 7
a 7
while 7
he 7
changed 7
clothes 7
with 7
the 7
first 7
person 7
he 7
met 7
in 7
the 7
town 7
and 7
having 7
bought 7
a 7
certain 7
powder 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
let 7
him 7
in 7
by 7
a 7
little 7
side 7
door 7
put 7
on 7
your 7
most 7
beautiful 7
dress 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
receive 7
the 7
magician 7
with 7
smiles 7
leading 7
him 7
to 7
believe 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
forgotten 7
me 7
invite 7
him 7
to 7
sup 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
say 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
taste 7
the 7
wine 7
of 7
his 7
country 7
he 7
will 7
go 7
for 7
some 7
and 7
while 7
he 7
is 7
gone 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
what 7
to 7
do 7
she 7
listened 7
carefully 7
to 7
aladdin 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
left 7
her 7
arrayed 7
herself 7
gaily 7
for 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
since 7
she 7
left 7
china 7
she 7
put 7
on 7
a 7
girdle 7
and 7
headdress 7
of 7
diamonds 7
and 7
seeing 7
in 7
a 7
glass 7
that 7
she 7
looked 7
more 7
beautiful 7
than 7
ever 7
received 7
the 7
magician 7
saying 7
to 7
his 7
great 7
amazement 7
i 7
have 7
made 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
that 7
aladdin 7
is 7
dead 7
and 7
that 7
all 7
my 7
tears 7
will 7
not 7
bring 7
him 7
back 7
to 7
me 7
so 7
i 7
am 7
resolved 7
to 7
mourn 7
no 7
more 7
and 7
have 7
therefore 7
invited 7
you 7
to 7
sup 7
with 7
me 7
but 7
i 7
am 7
tired 7
of 7
the 7
wines 7
of 7
china 7
and 7
would 7
fain 7
taste 7
those 7
of 7
africa 7
the 7
magician 7
flew 7
to 7
his 7
cellar 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
put 7
the 7
powder 7
aladdin 7
had 7
given 7
her 7
in 7
her 7
cup 7
when 7
he 7
returned 7
she 7
asked 7
him 7
to 7
drink 7
her 7
health 7
in 7
the 7
wine 7
of 7
africa 7
handing 7
him 7
her 7
cup 7
in 7
exchange 7
for 7
his 7
as 7
a 7
sign 7
she 7
was 7
reconciled 7
to 7
him 7
before 7
drinking 7
the 7
magician 7
made 7
her 7
a 7
speech 7
in 7
praise 7
of 7
her 7
beauty 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
cut 7
him 7
short 7
saying 7
let 7
me 7
drink 7
first 7
and 7
you 7
shall 7
say 7
what 7
you 7
will 7
afterwards 7
she 7
set 7
her 7
cup 7
to 7
her 7
lips 7
and 7
kept 7
it 7
there 7
while 7
the 7
magician 7
drained 7
his 7
to 7
the 7
dregs 7
and 7
fell 7
back 7
lifeless 7
the 7
princess 7
then 7
opened 7
the 7
door 7
to 7
aladdin 7
and 7
flung 7
her 7
arms 7
round 7
his 7
neck 7
but 7
aladdin 7
put 7
her 7
away 7
bidding 7
her 7
to 7
leave 7
him 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
more 7
to 7
do 7
he 7
then 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
dead 7
magician 7
took 7
the 7
lamp 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
vest 7
and 7
bade 7
the 7
genie 7
carry 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
all 7
in 7
it 7
back 7
to 7
china 7
this 7
was 7
done 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
her 7
chamber 7
only 7
felt 7
two 7
little 7
shocks 7
and 7
little 7
thought 7
she 7
was 7
at 7
home 7
again 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
was 7
sitting 7
in 7
his 7
closet 7
mourning 7
for 7
his 7
lost 7
daughter 7
happened 7
to 7
look 7
up 7
and 7
rubbed 7
his 7
eyes 7
for 7
there 7
stood 7
the 7
palace 7
as 7
before 7
he 7
hastened 7
thither 7
and 7
aladdin 7
received 7
him 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
of 7
the 7
fourandtwenty 7
windows 7
with 7
the 7
princess 7
at 7
his 7
side 7
aladdin 7
told 7
him 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
and 7
showed 7
him 7
the 7
dead 7
body 7
of 7
the 7
magician 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
believe 7
a 7
ten 7
days 7
feast 7
was 7
proclaimed 7
and 7
it 7
seemed 7
as 7
if 7
aladdin 7
might 7
now 7
live 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
his 7
life 7
in 7
peace 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
african 7
magician 7
had 7
a 7
younger 7
brother 7
who 7
was 7
if 7
possible 7
more 7
wicked 7
and 7
more 7
cunning 7
than 7
himself 7
he 7
travelled 7
to 7
china 7
to 7
avenge 7
his 7
brothers 7
death 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
visit 7
a 7
pious 7
woman 7
called 7
fatima 7
thinking 7
she 7
might 7
be 7
of 7
use 7
to 7
him 7
he 7
entered 7
her 7
cell 7
and 7
clapped 7
a 7
dagger 7
to 7
her 7
breast 7
telling 7
her 7
to 7
rise 7
and 7
do 7
his 7
bidding 7
on 7
pain 7
of 7
death 7
he 7
changed 7
clothes 7
with 7
her 7
coloured 7
his 7
face 7
like 7
hers 7
put 7
on 7
her 7
veil 7
and 7
murdered 7
her 7
that 7
she 7
might 7
tell 7
no 7
tales 7
then 7
he 7
went 7
towards 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
aladdin 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
people 7
thinking 7
he 7
was 7
the 7
holy 7
woman 7
gathered 7
round 7
him 7
kissing 7
his 7
hands 7
and 7
begging 7
his 7
blessing 7
when 7
he 7
got 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
there 7
was 7
such 7
a 7
noise 7
going 7
on 7
round 7
him 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
bade 7
her 7
slave 7
look 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
window 7
and 7
ask 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
the 7
slave 7
said 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
holy 7
woman 7
curing 7
people 7
by 7
her 7
touch 7
of 7
their 7
ailments 7
whereupon 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
had 7
long 7
desired 7
to 7
see 7
fatima 7
sent 7
for 7
her 7
on 7
coming 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
magician 7
offered 7
up 7
a 7
prayer 7
for 7
her 7
health 7
and 7
prosperity 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
the 7
princess 7
made 7
him 7
sit 7
by 7
her 7
and 7
begged 7
him 7
to 7
stay 7
with 7
her 7
always 7
the 7
false 7
fatima 7
who 7
wished 7
for 7
nothing 7
better 7
consented 7
but 7
kept 7
his 7
veil 7
down 7
for 7
fear 7
of 7
discovery 7
the 7
princess 7
showed 7
him 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
asked 7
him 7
what 7
he 7
thought 7
of 7
it 7
it 7
is 7
truly 7
beautiful 7
said 7
the 7
false 7
fatima 7
in 7
my 7
mind 7
it 7
wants 7
but 7
one 7
thing 7
and 7
what 7
is 7
that 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
if 7
only 7
a 7
rocs 7
egg 7
replied 7
he 7
were 7
hung 7
up 7
from 7
the 7
middle 7
of 7
this 7
dome 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
the 7
wonder 7
of 7
the 7
world 7
after 7
this 7
the 7
princess 7
could 7
think 7
of 7
nothing 7
but 7
a 7
rocs 7
egg 7
and 7
when 7
aladdin 7
returned 7
from 7
hunting 7
he 7
found 7
her 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
ill 7
humour 7
he 7
begged 7
to 7
know 7
what 7
was 7
amiss 7
and 7
she 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
all 7
her 7
pleasure 7
in 7
the 7
hall 7
was 7
spoilt 7
for 7
the 7
want 7
of 7
a 7
rocs 7
egg 7
hanging 7
from 7
the 7
dome 7
it 7
that 7
is 7
all 7
replied 7
aladdin 7
you 7
shall 7
soon 7
be 7
happy 7
he 7
left 7
her 7
and 7
rubbed 7
the 7
lamp 7
and 7
when 7
the 7
genie 7
appeared 7
commanded 7
him 7
to 7
bring 7
a 7
rocs 7
egg 7
the 7
genie 7
gave 7
such 7
a 7
loud 7
and 7
terrible 7
shriek 7
that 7
the 7
hall 7
shook 7
wretch 7
he 7
cried 7
is 7
it 7
not 7
enough 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
done 7
everything 7
for 7
you 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
command 7
me 7
to 7
bring 7
my 7
master 7
and 7
hang 7
him 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
midst 7
of 7
this 7
dome 7
you 7
and 7
your 7
wife 7
and 7
your 7
palace 7
deserve 7
to 7
be 7
burnt 7
to 7
ashes 7
but 7
this 7
request 7
does 7
not 7
come 7
from 7
you 7
but 7
from 7
the 7
brother 7
of 7
the 7
african 7
magician 7
whom 7
you 7
destroyed 7
he 7
is 7
now 7
in 7
your 7
palace 7
disguised 7
as 7
the 7
holy 7
womanwhom 7
he 7
murdered 7
he 7
it 7
was 7
who 7
put 7
that 7
wish 7
into 7
your 7
wifes 7
head 7
take 7
care 7
of 7
yourself 7
for 7
he 7
means 7
to 7
kill 7
you 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
genie 7
disappeared 7
aladdin 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
saying 7
his 7
head 7
ached 7
and 7
requesting 7
that 7
the 7
holy 7
fatima 7
should 7
be 7
fetched 7
to 7
lay 7
her 7
hands 7
on 7
it 7
but 7
when 7
the 7
magician 7
came 7
near 7
aladdin 7
seizing 7
his 7
dagger 7
pierced 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
heart 7
what 7
have 7
you 7
done 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
you 7
have 7
killed 7
the 7
holy 7
woman 7
not 7
so 7
replied 7
aladdin 7
but 7
a 7
wicked 7
magician 7
and 7
told 7
her 7
of 7
how 7
she 7
had 7
been 7
deceived 7
after 7
this 7
aladdin 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
lived 7
in 7
peace 7
he 7
succeeded 7
the 7
sultan 7
when 7
he 7
died 7
and 7
reigned 7
for 7
many 7
years 7
leaving 7
behind 7
him 7
a 7
long 7
line 7
of 7
kings 7
the 7
adventures 7
of 7
harounalraschid 7
caliph 7
of 7
bagdad 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
sat 7
in 7
his 7
palace 7
wondering 7
if 7
there 7
was 7
anything 7
left 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
that 7
could 7
possibly 7
give 7
him 7
a 7
few 7
hours 7
amusement 7
when 7
giafar 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
his 7
old 7
and 7
tried 7
friend 7
suddenly 7
appeared 7
before 7
him 7
bowing 7
low 7
he 7
waited 7
as 7
was 7
his 7
duty 7
till 7
his 7
master 7
spoke 7
but 7
harounalraschid 7
merely 7
turned 7
his 7
head 7
and 7
looked 7
at 7
him 7
and 7
sank 7
back 7
into 7
his 7
former 7
weary 7
posture 7
now 7
giafar 7
had 7
something 7
of 7
importance 7
to 7
say 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
had 7
no 7
intention 7
of 7
being 7
put 7
off 7
by 7
mere 7
silence 7
so 7
with 7
another 7
low 7
bow 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
the 7
throne 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
speak 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
have 7
taken 7
on 7
myself 7
to 7
remind 7
your 7
highness 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
undertaken 7
secretly 7
to 7
observe 7
for 7
yourself 7
the 7
manner 7
in 7
which 7
justice 7
is 7
done 7
and 7
order 7
is 7
kept 7
throughout 7
the 7
city 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
day 7
you 7
have 7
set 7
apart 7
to 7
devote 7
to 7
this 7
object 7
and 7
perhaps 7
in 7
fulfilling 7
this 7
duty 7
you 7
may 7
find 7
some 7
distraction 7
from 7
the 7
melancholy 7
to 7
which 7
as 7
i 7
see 7
to 7
my 7
sorrow 7
you 7
are 7
a 7
prey 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
returned 7
the 7
caliph 7
i 7
had 7
forgotten 7
all 7
about 7
it 7
go 7
and 7
change 7
your 7
coat 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
change 7
mine 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
later 7
they 7
both 7
reentered 7
the 7
hall 7
disguised 7
as 7
foreign 7
merchants 7
and 7
passed 7
through 7
a 7
secret 7
door 7
out 7
into 7
the 7
open 7
country 7
here 7
they 7
turned 7
towards 7
the 7
euphrates 7
and 7
crossing 7
the 7
river 7
in 7
a 7
small 7
boat 7
walked 7
through 7
that 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
town 7
which 7
lay 7
along 7
the 7
further 7
bank 7
without 7
seeing 7
anything 7
to 7
call 7
for 7
their 7
interference 7
much 7
pleased 7
with 7
the 7
peace 7
and 7
good 7
order 7
of 7
the 7
city 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
his 7
vizir 7
made 7
their 7
way 7
to 7
a 7
bridge 7
which 7
led 7
straight 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
had 7
already 7
crossed 7
it 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
stopped 7
by 7
an 7
old 7
and 7
blind 7
man 7
who 7
begged 7
for 7
alms 7
the 7
caliph 7
gave 7
him 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
money 7
and 7
was 7
passing 7
on 7
but 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
seized 7
his 7
hand 7
and 7
held 7
him 7
fast 7
charitable 7
person 7
he 7
said 7
whoever 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
grant 7
me 7
yet 7
another 7
prayer 7
strike 7
me 7
i 7
beg 7
of 7
you 7
one 7
blow 7
i 7
have 7
deserved 7
it 7
richly 7
and 7
even 7
a 7
more 7
severe 7
penalty 7
the 7
caliph 7
much 7
surprised 7
at 7
this 7
request 7
replied 7
gently 7
my 7
good 7
man 7
that 7
which 7
you 7
ask 7
is 7
impossible 7
of 7
what 7
use 7
would 7
my 7
alms 7
be 7
if 7
i 7
treated 7
you 7
so 7
ill 7
and 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
loosen 7
the 7
grasp 7
of 7
the 7
blind 7
beggar 7
my 7
lord 7
answered 7
the 7
man 7
pardon 7
my 7
boldness 7
and 7
my 7
persistence 7
take 7
back 7
your 7
money 7
or 7
give 7
me 7
the 7
blow 7
which 7
i 7
crave 7
i 7
have 7
sworn 7
a 7
solemn 7
oath 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
receive 7
nothing 7
without 7
receiving 7
chastisement 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
knew 7
all 7
you 7
would 7
feel 7
that 7
the 7
punishment 7
is 7
not 7
a 7
tenth 7
part 7
of 7
what 7
i 7
deserve 7
moved 7
by 7
these 7
words 7
and 7
perhaps 7
still 7
more 7
by 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
other 7
business 7
to 7
attend 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
yielded 7
and 7
struck 7
him 7
lightly 7
on 7
the 7
shoulder 7
then 7
he 7
continued 7
his 7
road 7
followed 7
by 7
the 7
blessing 7
of 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
out 7
of 7
earshot 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
vizir 7
there 7
must 7
be 7
something 7
very 7
odd 7
to 7
make 7
that 7
man 7
act 7
soi 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
reason 7
go 7
back 7
to 7
him 7
tell 7
him 7
who 7
i 7
am 7
and 7
order 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
without 7
fail 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
tomorrow 7
after 7
the 7
hour 7
of 7
evening 7
prayer 7
so 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
bridge 7
gave 7
the 7
blind 7
beggar 7
first 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
money 7
and 7
then 7
a 7
blow 7
delivered 7
the 7
caliphs 7
message 7
and 7
rejoined 7
his 7
master 7
they 7
passed 7
on 7
towards 7
the 7
palace 7
but 7
walking 7
through 7
a 7
square 7
they 7
came 7
upon 7
a 7
crowd 7
watching 7
a 7
young 7
and 7
welldressed 7
man 7
who 7
was 7
urging 7
a 7
horse 7
at 7
full 7
speed 7
round 7
the 7
open 7
space 7
using 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
his 7
spurs 7
and 7
whip 7
so 7
unmercifully 7
that 7
the 7
animal 7
was 7
all 7
covered 7
with 7
foam 7
and 7
blood 7
the 7
caliph 7
astonished 7
at 7
this 7
proceeding 7
inquired 7
of 7
a 7
passerby 7
what 7
it 7
all 7
meant 7
but 7
no 7
one 7
could 7
tell 7
him 7
anything 7
except 7
that 7
every 7
day 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
hour 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
took 7
place 7
still 7
wondering 7
he 7
passed 7
on 7
and 7
for 7
the 7
moment 7
had 7
to 7
content 7
himself 7
with 7
telling 7
the 7
vizir 7
to 7
command 7
the 7
horseman 7
also 7
to 7
appear 7
before 7
him 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
as 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
after 7
evening 7
prayer 7
the 7
caliph 7
entered 7
the 7
hall 7
and 7
was 7
followed 7
by 7
the 7
vizir 7
bringing 7
with 7
him 7
the 7
two 7
men 7
of 7
whom 7
we 7
have 7
spoken 7
and 7
a 7
third 7
with 7
whom 7
we 7
have 7
nothing 7
to 7
do 7
they 7
all 7
bowed 7
themselves 7
low 7
before 7
the 7
throne 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
caliph 7
bade 7
them 7
rise 7
and 7
ask 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
his 7
name 7
babaabdalla 7
your 7
highness 7
said 7
he 7
babaabdalla 7
returned 7
the 7
caliph 7
your 7
way 7
of 7
asking 7
alms 7
yesterday 7
seemed 7
to 7
me 7
so 7
strange 7
that 7
i 7
almost 7
commanded 7
you 7
then 7
and 7
there 7
to 7
cease 7
from 7
causing 7
such 7
a 7
public 7
scandal 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
sent 7
for 7
you 7
to 7
inquire 7
what 7
was 7
your 7
motive 7
in 7
making 7
such 7
a 7
curious 7
vow 7
when 7
i 7
know 7
the 7
reason 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
judge 7
whether 7
you 7
can 7
be 7
permitted 7
to 7
continue 7
to 7
practise 7
it 7
for 7
i 7
cannot 7
help 7
thinking 7
that 7
it 7
sets 7
a 7
very 7
bad 7
example 7
to 7
others 7
tell 7
me 7
therefore 7
the 7
whole 7
truth 7
and 7
conceal 7
nothing 7
these 7
words 7
troubled 7
the 7
heart 7
of 7
babaabdalla 7
who 7
prostrated 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
then 7
rising 7
he 7
answered 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
i 7
crave 7
your 7
pardon 7
humbly 7
for 7
my 7
persistence 7
in 7
beseeching 7
your 7
highness 7
to 7
do 7
an 7
action 7
which 7
appears 7
on 7
the 7
face 7
of 7
it 7
to 7
be 7
without 7
any 7
meaning 7
no 7
doubt 7
in 7
the 7
eyes 7
of 7
men 7
it 7
has 7
none 7
but 7
i 7
look 7
on 7
it 7
as 7
a 7
slight 7
expiation 7
for 7
a 7
fearful 7
sin 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
have 7
been 7
guilty 7
and 7
if 7
your 7
highness 7
will 7
deign 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
my 7
tale 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
no 7
punishment 7
could 7
atone 7
for 7
the 7
crime 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
blind 7
babaabdalla 7
i 7
was 7
born 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
in 7
bagdad 7
and 7
was 7
left 7
an 7
orphan 7
while 7
i 7
was 7
yet 7
a 7
very 7
young 7
man 7
for 7
my 7
parents 7
died 7
within 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
of 7
each 7
other 7
i 7
had 7
inherited 7
from 7
them 7
a 7
small 7
fortune 7
which 7
i 7
worked 7
hard 7
night 7
and 7
day 7
to 7
increase 7
till 7
at 7
last 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
the 7
owner 7
of 7
eighty 7
camels 7
these 7
i 7
hired 7
out 7
to 7
travelling 7
merchants 7
whom 7
i 7
frequently 7
accompanied 7
on 7
their 7
various 7
journeys 7
and 7
always 7
returned 7
with 7
large 7
profits 7
one 7
day 7
i 7
was 7
coming 7
back 7
from 7
balsora 7
whither 7
i 7
had 7
taken 7
a 7
supply 7
of 7
goods 7
intended 7
for 7
india 7
and 7
halted 7
at 7
noon 7
in 7
a 7
lonely 7
place 7
which 7
promised 7
rich 7
pasture 7
for 7
my 7
camels 7
i 7
was 7
resting 7
in 7
the 7
shade 7
under 7
a 7
tree 7
when 7
a 7
dervish 7
going 7
on 7
foot 7
towards 7
balsora 7
sat 7
down 7
by 7
my 7
side 7
and 7
i 7
inquired 7
whence 7
he 7
had 7
come 7
and 7
to 7
what 7
place 7
he 7
was 7
going 7
we 7
soon 7
made 7
friends 7
and 7
after 7
we 7
had 7
asked 7
each 7
other 7
the 7
usual 7
questions 7
we 7
produced 7
the 7
food 7
we 7
had 7
with 7
us 7
and 7
satisfied 7
our 7
hunger 7
while 7
we 7
were 7
eating 7
the 7
dervish 7
happened 7
to 7
mention 7
that 7
in 7
a 7
spot 7
only 7
a 7
little 7
way 7
off 7
from 7
where 7
we 7
were 7
sitting 7
there 7
was 7
hidden 7
a 7
treasure 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
if 7
my 7
eighty 7
camels 7
were 7
loaded 7
till 7
they 7
could 7
carry 7
no 7
more 7
the 7
hiding 7
place 7
would 7
seem 7
as 7
full 7
as 7
if 7
it 7
had 7
never 7
been 7
touched 7
at 7
this 7
news 7
i 7
became 7
almost 7
beside 7
myself 7
with 7
joy 7
and 7
greed 7
and 7
i 7
flung 7
my 7
arms 7
round 7
the 7
neck 7
of 7
the 7
dervish 7
exclaiming 7
good 7
dervish 7
i 7
see 7
plainly 7
that 7
the 7
riches 7
of 7
this 7
world 7
are 7
nothing 7
to 7
you 7
therefore 7
of 7
what 7
use 7
is 7
the 7
knowledge 7
of 7
this 7
treasure 7
to 7
you 7
alone 7
and 7
on 7
foot 7
you 7
could 7
carry 7
away 7
a 7
mere 7
handful 7
but 7
tell 7
me 7
where 7
it 7
is 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
load 7
my 7
eighty 7
camels 7
with 7
it 7
and 7
give 7
you 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
as 7
a 7
token 7
of 7
my 7
gratitude 7
certainly 7
my 7
offer 7
does 7
not 7
sound 7
very 7
magnificent 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
great 7
to 7
me 7
for 7
at 7
his 7
words 7
a 7
wave 7
of 7
covetousness 7
had 7
swept 7
over 7
my 7
heart 7
and 7
i 7
almost 7
felt 7
as 7
if 7
the 7
seventynine 7
camels 7
that 7
were 7
left 7
were 7
nothing 7
in 7
comparison 7
the 7
dervish 7
saw 7
quite 7
well 7
what 7
was 7
passing 7
in 7
my 7
mind 7
but 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
show 7
what 7
he 7
thought 7
of 7
my 7
proposal 7
my 7
brother 7
he 7
answered 7
quietly 7
you 7
know 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
i 7
do 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
behaving 7
unjustly 7
it 7
was 7
open 7
to 7
me 7
to 7
keep 7
my 7
secret 7
and 7
to 7
reserve 7
the 7
treasure 7
for 7
myself 7
but 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
told 7
you 7
of 7
its 7
existence 7
shows 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
confidence 7
in 7
you 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
hoped 7
to 7
earn 7
your 7
gratitude 7
for 7
ever 7
by 7
making 7
your 7
fortune 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
mine 7
but 7
before 7
i 7
reveal 7
to 7
you 7
the 7
secret 7
of 7
the 7
treasure 7
you 7
must 7
swear 7
that 7
after 7
we 7
have 7
loaded 7
the 7
camels 7
with 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
they 7
can 7
carry 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
half 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
let 7
us 7
go 7
our 7
own 7
ways 7
i 7
think 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
this 7
is 7
fair 7
for 7
if 7
you 7
present 7
me 7
with 7
forty 7
camels 7
i 7
on 7
my 7
side 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
the 7
means 7
of 7
buying 7
a 7
thousand 7
more 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
of 7
course 7
deny 7
that 7
what 7
the 7
dervish 7
said 7
was 7
perfectly 7
reasonable 7
but 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
that 7
the 7
thought 7
that 7
the 7
dervish 7
would 7
be 7
as 7
rich 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
unbearable 7
to 7
me 7
still 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
use 7
in 7
discussing 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
i 7
had 7
to 7
accept 7
his 7
conditions 7
or 7
bewail 7
to 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
my 7
life 7
the 7
loss 7
of 7
immense 7
wealth 7
so 7
i 7
collected 7
my 7
camels 7
and 7
we 7
set 7
out 7
together 7
under 7
the 7
guidance 7
of 7
the 7
dervish 7
after 7
walking 7
some 7
time 7
we 7
reached 7
what 7
looked 7
like 7
a 7
valley 7
but 7
with 7
such 7
a 7
narrow 7
entrance 7
that 7
my 7
camels 7
could 7
only 7
pass 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
the 7
little 7
valley 7
or 7
open 7
space 7
was 7
shut 7
up 7
by 7
two 7
mountains 7
whose 7
sides 7
were 7
formed 7
of 7
straight 7
cliffs 7
which 7
no 7
human 7
being 7
could 7
climb 7
when 7
we 7
were 7
exactly 7
between 7
these 7
mountains 7
the 7
dervish 7
stopped 7
make 7
your 7
camels 7
lie 7
down 7
in 7
this 7
open 7
space 7
he 7
said 7
so 7
that 7
we 7
can 7
easily 7
load 7
them 7
then 7
we 7
will 7
go 7
to 7
the 7
treasure 7
i 7
did 7
what 7
i 7
was 7
bid 7
and 7
rejoined 7
the 7
dervish 7
whom 7
i 7
found 7
trying 7
to 7
kindle 7
a 7
fire 7
out 7
of 7
some 7
dry 7
wood 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
alight 7
he 7
threw 7
on 7
it 7
a 7
handful 7
of 7
perfumes 7
and 7
pronounced 7
a 7
few 7
words 7
that 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
understand 7
and 7
immediately 7
a 7
thick 7
column 7
of 7
smoke 7
rose 7
high 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
he 7
separated 7
the 7
smoke 7
into 7
two 7
columns 7
and 7
then 7
i 7
saw 7
a 7
rock 7
which 7
stood 7
like 7
a 7
pillar 7
between 7
the 7
two 7
mountains 7
slowly 7
open 7
and 7
a 7
splendid 7
palace 7
appear 7
within 7
but 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
the 7
love 7
of 7
gold 7
had 7
taken 7
such 7
possession 7
of 7
my 7
heart 7
that 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
even 7
stop 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
riches 7
but 7
fell 7
upon 7
the 7
first 7
pile 7
of 7
gold 7
within 7
my 7
reach 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
heap 7
it 7
into 7
a 7
sack 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
me 7
the 7
dervish 7
likewise 7
set 7
to 7
work 7
but 7
i 7
soon 7
noticed 7
that 7
he 7
confined 7
himself 7
to 7
collecting 7
precious 7
stones 7
and 7
i 7
felt 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
wise 7
to 7
follow 7
his 7
example 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
camels 7
were 7
loaded 7
with 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
they 7
could 7
carry 7
and 7
nothing 7
remained 7
but 7
to 7
seal 7
up 7
the 7
treasure 7
and 7
go 7
our 7
ways 7
before 7
however 7
this 7
was 7
done 7
the 7
dervish 7
went 7
up 7
to 7
a 7
great 7
golden 7
vase 7
beautifully 7
chased 7
and 7
took 7
from 7
it 7
a 7
small 7
wooden 7
box 7
which 7
he 7
hid 7
in 7
the 7
bosom 7
of 7
his 7
dress 7
merely 7
saying 7
that 7
it 7
contained 7
a 7
special 7
kind 7
of 7
ointment 7
then 7
he 7
once 7
more 7
kindled 7
the 7
fire 7
threw 7
on 7
the 7
perfume 7
and 7
murmured 7
the 7
unknown 7
spell 7
and 7
the 7
rock 7
closed 7
and 7
stood 7
whole 7
as 7
before 7
the 7
next 7
thing 7
was 7
to 7
divide 7
the 7
camels 7
and 7
to 7
charge 7
them 7
with 7
the 7
treasure 7
after 7
which 7
we 7
each 7
took 7
command 7
of 7
our 7
own 7
and 7
marched 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
valley 7
till 7
we 7
reached 7
the 7
place 7
in 7
the 7
high 7
road 7
where 7
the 7
routes 7
diverge 7
and 7
then 7
we 7
parted 7
the 7
dervish 7
going 7
towards 7
balsora 7
and 7
i 7
to 7
bagdad 7
we 7
embraced 7
each 7
other 7
tenderly 7
and 7
i 7
poured 7
out 7
my 7
gratitude 7
for 7
the 7
honour 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
me 7
in 7
singling 7
me 7
out 7
for 7
this 7
great 7
wealth 7
and 7
having 7
said 7
a 7
hearty 7
farewell 7
we 7
turned 7
our 7
backs 7
and 7
hastened 7
after 7
our 7
camels 7
i 7
had 7
hardly 7
come 7
up 7
with 7
mine 7
when 7
the 7
demon 7
of 7
envy 7
filled 7
my 7
soul 7
what 7
does 7
a 7
dervish 7
want 7
with 7
riches 7
like 7
that 7
i 7
said 7
to 7
myself 7
he 7
alone 7
has 7
the 7
secret 7
of 7
the 7
treasure 7
and 7
can 7
always 7
get 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
he 7
wants 7
and 7
i 7
halted 7
my 7
camels 7
by 7
the 7
roadside 7
and 7
ran 7
back 7
after 7
him 7
i 7
was 7
a 7
quick 7
runner 7
and 7
it 7
did 7
not 7
take 7
me 7
very 7
long 7
to 7
come 7
up 7
with 7
him 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
exclaimed 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
speak 7
almost 7
at 7
the 7
moment 7
of 7
our 7
leavetaking 7
a 7
reflection 7
occurred 7
to 7
me 7
which 7
is 7
perhaps 7
new 7
to 7
you 7
you 7
are 7
a 7
dervish 7
by 7
profession 7
and 7
live 7
a 7
very 7
quiet 7
life 7
only 7
caring 7
to 7
do 7
good 7
and 7
careless 7
of 7
the 7
things 7
of 7
this 7
world 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
realise 7
the 7
burden 7
that 7
you 7
lay 7
upon 7
yourself 7
when 7
you 7
gather 7
into 7
your 7
hands 7
such 7
great 7
wealth 7
besides 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
who 7
is 7
not 7
accustomed 7
to 7
camels 7
from 7
his 7
birth 7
can 7
ever 7
manage 7
the 7
stubborn 7
beasts 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
wise 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
encumber 7
yourself 7
with 7
more 7
than 7
thirty 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
those 7
trouble 7
enough 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
replied 7
the 7
dervish 7
who 7
understood 7
me 7
quite 7
well 7
but 7
did 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
fight 7
the 7
matter 7
i 7
confess 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
thought 7
about 7
it 7
choose 7
any 7
ten 7
you 7
like 7
and 7
drive 7
them 7
before 7
you 7
i 7
selected 7
ten 7
of 7
the 7
best 7
camels 7
and 7
we 7
proceeded 7
along 7
the 7
road 7
to 7
rejoin 7
those 7
i 7
had 7
left 7
behind 7
i 7
had 7
got 7
what 7
i 7
wanted 7
but 7
i 7
had 7
found 7
the 7
dervish 7
so 7
easy 7
to 7
deal 7
with 7
that 7
i 7
rather 7
regretted 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
asked 7
for 7
ten 7
more 7
i 7
looked 7
back 7
he 7
had 7
only 7
gone 7
a 7
few 7
paces 7
and 7
i 7
called 7
after 7
him 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
said 7
i 7
am 7
unwilling 7
to 7
part 7
from 7
you 7
without 7
pointing 7
out 7
what 7
i 7
think 7
you 7
scarcely 7
grasp 7
that 7
large 7
experience 7
of 7
cameldriving 7
is 7
necessary 7
to 7
anybody 7
who 7
intends 7
to 7
keep 7
together 7
a 7
troop 7
of 7
thirty 7
in 7
your 7
own 7
interest 7
i 7
feel 7
sure 7
you 7
would 7
be 7
much 7
happier 7
if 7
you 7
entrusted 7
ten 7
more 7
of 7
them 7
to 7
me 7
for 7
with 7
my 7
practice 7
it 7
is 7
all 7
one 7
to 7
me 7
if 7
i 7
take 7
two 7
or 7
a 7
hundred 7
as 7
before 7
the 7
dervish 7
made 7
no 7
difficulties 7
and 7
i 7
drove 7
off 7
my 7
ten 7
camels 7
in 7
triumph 7
only 7
leaving 7
him 7
with 7
twenty 7
for 7
his 7
share 7
i 7
had 7
now 7
sixty 7
and 7
anyone 7
might 7
have 7
imagined 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
content 7
but 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
there 7
is 7
a 7
proverb 7
that 7
says 7
the 7
more 7
one 7
has 7
the 7
more 7
one 7
wants 7
so 7
it 7
was 7
with 7
me 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
rest 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
one 7
solitary 7
camel 7
remained 7
to 7
the 7
dervish 7
and 7
returning 7
to 7
him 7
i 7
redoubled 7
my 7
prayers 7
and 7
embraces 7
and 7
promises 7
of 7
eternal 7
gratitude 7
till 7
the 7
last 7
twenty 7
were 7
in 7
my 7
hands 7
make 7
a 7
good 7
use 7
of 7
them 7
my 7
brother 7
said 7
the 7
holy 7
man 7
remember 7
riches 7
sometimes 7
have 7
wings 7
if 7
we 7
keep 7
them 7
for 7
ourselves 7
and 7
the 7
poor 7
are 7
at 7
our 7
gates 7
expressly 7
that 7
we 7
may 7
help 7
them 7
my 7
eyes 7
were 7
so 7
blinded 7
by 7
gold 7
that 7
i 7
paid 7
no 7
heed 7
to 7
his 7
wise 7
counsel 7
and 7
only 7
looked 7
about 7
for 7
something 7
else 7
to 7
grasp 7
suddenly 7
i 7
remembered 7
the 7
little 7
box 7
of 7
ointment 7
that 7
the 7
dervish 7
had 7
hidden 7
and 7
which 7
most 7
likely 7
contained 7
a 7
treasure 7
more 7
precious 7
than 7
all 7
the 7
rest 7
giving 7
him 7
one 7
last 7
embrace 7
i 7
observed 7
accidentally 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
going 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
that 7
little 7
box 7
of 7
ointment 7
it 7
seems 7
hardly 7
worth 7
taking 7
with 7
you 7
you 7
might 7
as 7
well 7
let 7
me 7
have 7
it 7
and 7
really 7
a 7
dervish 7
who 7
has 7
given 7
up 7
the 7
world 7
has 7
no 7
need 7
of 7
ointment 7
oh 7
if 7
he 7
had 7
only 7
refused 7
my 7
request 7
but 7
then 7
supposing 7
he 7
had 7
i 7
should 7
have 7
got 7
possession 7
of 7
it 7
by 7
force 7
so 7
great 7
was 7
the 7
madness 7
that 7
had 7
laid 7
hold 7
upon 7
me 7
however 7
far 7
from 7
refusing 7
it 7
the 7
dervish 7
at 7
once 7
held 7
it 7
out 7
saying 7
gracefully 7
take 7
it 7
my 7
friend 7
and 7
if 7
there 7
is 7
anything 7
else 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
to 7
make 7
you 7
happy 7
you 7
must 7
let 7
me 7
know 7
directly 7
the 7
box 7
was 7
in 7
my 7
hands 7
i 7
wrenched 7
off 7
the 7
cover 7
as 7
you 7
are 7
so 7
kind 7
i 7
said 7
tell 7
me 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
what 7
are 7
the 7
virtues 7
of 7
this 7
ointment 7
they 7
are 7
most 7
curious 7
and 7
interesting 7
replied 7
the 7
dervish 7
if 7
you 7
apply 7
a 7
little 7
of 7
it 7
to 7
your 7
left 7
eye 7
you 7
will 7
behold 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
all 7
the 7
treasures 7
hidden 7
in 7
the 7
bowels 7
of 7
the 7
earth 7
but 7
beware 7
lest 7
you 7
touch 7
your 7
right 7
eye 7
with 7
it 7
or 7
your 7
sight 7
will 7
be 7
destroyed 7
for 7
ever 7
his 7
words 7
excited 7
my 7
curiosity 7
to 7
the 7
highest 7
pitch 7
make 7
trial 7
on 7
me 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
i 7
cried 7
holding 7
out 7
the 7
box 7
to 7
the 7
dervish 7
you 7
will 7
know 7
how 7
to 7
do 7
it 7
better 7
than 7
i 7
i 7
am 7
burning 7
with 7
impatience 7
to 7
test 7
its 7
charms 7
the 7
dervish 7
took 7
the 7
box 7
i 7
had 7
extended 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
bidding 7
me 7
shut 7
my 7
left 7
eye 7
touched 7
it 7
gently 7
with 7
the 7
ointment 7
when 7
i 7
opened 7
it 7
again 7
i 7
saw 7
spread 7
out 7
as 7
it 7
were 7
before 7
me 7
treasures 7
of 7
every 7
kind 7
and 7
without 7
number 7
but 7
as 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
i 7
had 7
been 7
obliged 7
to 7
keep 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
closed 7
which 7
was 7
very 7
fatiguing 7
i 7
begged 7
the 7
dervish 7
to 7
apply 7
the 7
ointment 7
to 7
that 7
eye 7
also 7
if 7
you 7
insist 7
upon 7
it 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
it 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
remember 7
what 7
i 7
told 7
you 7
just 7
nowthat 7
if 7
it 7
touches 7
your 7
right 7
eye 7
you 7
will 7
become 7
blind 7
on 7
the 7
spot 7
unluckily 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
my 7
having 7
proved 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
the 7
dervishs 7
words 7
in 7
so 7
many 7
instances 7
i 7
was 7
firmly 7
convinced 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
now 7
keeping 7
concealed 7
from 7
me 7
some 7
hidden 7
and 7
precious 7
virtue 7
of 7
the 7
ointment 7
so 7
i 7
turned 7
a 7
deaf 7
ear 7
to 7
all 7
he 7
said 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
replied 7
smiling 7
i 7
see 7
you 7
are 7
joking 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
natural 7
that 7
the 7
same 7
ointment 7
should 7
have 7
two 7
such 7
exactly 7
opposite 7
effects 7
it 7
is 7
true 7
all 7
the 7
same 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
and 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
well 7
for 7
you 7
if 7
you 7
believed 7
my 7
word 7
but 7
i 7
would 7
not 7
believe 7
and 7
dazzled 7
by 7
the 7
greed 7
of 7
avarice 7
i 7
thought 7
that 7
if 7
one 7
eye 7
could 7
show 7
me 7
riches 7
the 7
other 7
might 7
teach 7
me 7
how 7
to 7
get 7
possession 7
of 7
them 7
and 7
i 7
continued 7
to 7
press 7
the 7
dervish 7
to 7
anoint 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
but 7
this 7
he 7
resolutely 7
declined 7
to 7
do 7
after 7
having 7
conferred 7
such 7
benefits 7
on 7
you 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
am 7
loth 7
indeed 7
to 7
work 7
you 7
such 7
evil 7
think 7
what 7
it 7
is 7
to 7
be 7
blind 7
and 7
do 7
not 7
force 7
me 7
to 7
do 7
what 7
you 7
will 7
repent 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
you 7
live 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
my 7
brother 7
i 7
said 7
firmly 7
pray 7
say 7
no 7
more 7
but 7
do 7
what 7
i 7
ask 7
you 7
have 7
most 7
generously 7
responded 7
to 7
my 7
wishes 7
up 7
to 7
this 7
time 7
do 7
not 7
spoil 7
my 7
recollection 7
of 7
you 7
for 7
a 7
thing 7
of 7
such 7
little 7
consequence 7
let 7
what 7
will 7
happen 7
i 7
take 7
it 7
on 7
my 7
own 7
head 7
and 7
will 7
never 7
reproach 7
you 7
since 7
you 7
are 7
determined 7
upon 7
it 7
he 7
answered 7
with 7
a 7
sigh 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
use 7
talking 7
and 7
taking 7
the 7
ointment 7
he 7
laid 7
some 7
on 7
my 7
right 7
eye 7
which 7
was 7
tight 7
shut 7
when 7
i 7
tried 7
to 7
open 7
it 7
heavy 7
clouds 7
of 7
darkness 7
floated 7
before 7
me 7
i 7
was 7
as 7
blind 7
as 7
you 7
see 7
me 7
now 7
miserable 7
dervish 7
i 7
shrieked 7
so 7
it 7
is 7
true 7
after 7
all 7
into 7
what 7
a 7
bottomless 7
pit 7
has 7
my 7
lust 7
after 7
gold 7
plunged 7
me 7
ah 7
now 7
that 7
my 7
eyes 7
are 7
closed 7
they 7
are 7
really 7
opened 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
all 7
my 7
sufferings 7
are 7
caused 7
by 7
myself 7
alone 7
but 7
good 7
brother 7
you 7
who 7
are 7
so 7
kind 7
and 7
charitable 7
and 7
know 7
the 7
secrets 7
of 7
such 7
vast 7
learning 7
have 7
you 7
nothing 7
that 7
will 7
give 7
me 7
back 7
my 7
sight 7
unhappy 7
man 7
replied 7
the 7
dervish 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
my 7
fault 7
that 7
this 7
has 7
befallen 7
you 7
but 7
it 7
is 7
a 7
just 7
chastisement 7
the 7
blindness 7
of 7
your 7
heart 7
has 7
wrought 7
the 7
blindness 7
of 7
your 7
body 7
yes 7
i 7
have 7
secrets 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
seen 7
in 7
the 7
short 7
time 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
known 7
each 7
other 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
none 7
that 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
back 7
your 7
sight 7
you 7
have 7
proved 7
yourself 7
unworthy 7
of 7
the 7
riches 7
that 7
were 7
given 7
you 7
now 7
they 7
have 7
passed 7
into 7
my 7
hands 7
whence 7
they 7
will 7
flow 7
into 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
others 7
less 7
greedy 7
and 7
ungrateful 7
than 7
you 7
the 7
dervish 7
said 7
no 7
more 7
and 7
left 7
me 7
speechless 7
with 7
shame 7
and 7
confusion 7
and 7
so 7
wretched 7
that 7
i 7
stood 7
rooted 7
to 7
the 7
spot 7
while 7
he 7
collected 7
the 7
eighty 7
camels 7
and 7
proceeded 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
to 7
balsora 7
it 7
was 7
in 7
vain 7
that 7
i 7
entreated 7
him 7
not 7
to 7
leave 7
me 7
but 7
at 7
least 7
to 7
take 7
me 7
within 7
reach 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
passing 7
caravan 7
he 7
was 7
deaf 7
to 7
my 7
prayers 7
and 7
cries 7
and 7
i 7
should 7
soon 7
have 7
been 7
dead 7
of 7
hunger 7
and 7
misery 7
if 7
some 7
merchants 7
had 7
not 7
come 7
along 7
the 7
track 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
and 7
kindly 7
brought 7
me 7
back 7
to 7
bagdad 7
from 7
a 7
rich 7
man 7
i 7
had 7
in 7
one 7
moment 7
become 7
a 7
beggar 7
and 7
up 7
to 7
this 7
time 7
i 7
have 7
lived 7
solely 7
on 7
the 7
alms 7
that 7
have 7
been 7
bestowed 7
on 7
me 7
but 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
expiate 7
the 7
sin 7
of 7
avarice 7
which 7
was 7
my 7
undoing 7
i 7
oblige 7
each 7
passerby 7
to 7
give 7
me 7
a 7
blow 7
this 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
is 7
my 7
story 7
when 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
had 7
ended 7
the 7
caliph 7
addressed 7
him 7
babaabdalla 7
truly 7
your 7
sin 7
is 7
great 7
but 7
you 7
have 7
suffered 7
enough 7
henceforth 7
repent 7
in 7
private 7
for 7
i 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
enough 7
money 7
is 7
given 7
you 7
day 7
by 7
day 7
for 7
all 7
your 7
wants 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
babaabdalla 7
flung 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
caliphs 7
feet 7
and 7
prayed 7
that 7
honour 7
and 7
happiness 7
might 7
be 7
his 7
portion 7
for 7
ever 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
sidinouman 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
was 7
much 7
pleased 7
with 7
the 7
tale 7
of 7
the 7
blind 7
man 7
and 7
the 7
dervish 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
finished 7
he 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
who 7
had 7
illtreated 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
inquired 7
his 7
name 7
also 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
replied 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
called 7
sidinouman 7
sidinouman 7
observed 7
the 7
caliph 7
i 7
have 7
seen 7
horses 7
broken 7
all 7
my 7
life 7
long 7
and 7
have 7
even 7
broken 7
them 7
myself 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
seen 7
any 7
horse 7
broken 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
barbarous 7
manner 7
as 7
by 7
you 7
yesterday 7
every 7
one 7
who 7
looked 7
on 7
was 7
indignant 7
and 7
blamed 7
you 7
loudly 7
as 7
for 7
myself 7
i 7
was 7
so 7
angry 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
very 7
nearly 7
disclosing 7
who 7
i 7
was 7
and 7
putting 7
a 7
stop 7
to 7
it 7
at 7
once 7
still 7
you 7
have 7
not 7
the 7
air 7
of 7
a 7
cruel 7
man 7
and 7
i 7
would 7
gladly 7
believe 7
that 7
you 7
did 7
not 7
act 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
without 7
some 7
reason 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
told 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
and 7
indeed 7
that 7
every 7
day 7
you 7
are 7
to 7
be 7
seen 7
flogging 7
and 7
spurring 7
your 7
horse 7
i 7
wish 7
to 7
come 7
to 7
the 7
bottom 7
of 7
the 7
matter 7
but 7
tell 7
me 7
the 7
whole 7
truth 7
and 7
conceal 7
nothing 7
sidinouman 7
changed 7
colour 7
as 7
he 7
heard 7
these 7
words 7
and 7
his 7
manner 7
grew 7
confused 7
but 7
he 7
saw 7
plainly 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
help 7
for 7
it 7
so 7
he 7
prostrated 7
himself 7
before 7
the 7
throne 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
tried 7
to 7
obey 7
but 7
the 7
words 7
stuck 7
in 7
his 7
throat 7
and 7
he 7
remained 7
silent 7
the 7
caliph 7
accustomed 7
though 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
instant 7
obedience 7
guessed 7
something 7
of 7
what 7
was 7
passing 7
in 7
the 7
young 7
mans 7
mind 7
and 7
sought 7
to 7
put 7
him 7
at 7
his 7
ease 7
sidinouman 7
he 7
said 7
do 7
not 7
think 7
of 7
me 7
as 7
the 7
caliph 7
but 7
merely 7
as 7
a 7
friend 7
who 7
would 7
like 7
to 7
hear 7
your 7
story 7
if 7
there 7
is 7
anything 7
in 7
it 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
afraid 7
may 7
offend 7
me 7
take 7
courage 7
for 7
i 7
pardon 7
you 7
beforehand 7
speak 7
then 7
openly 7
and 7
without 7
fear 7
as 7
to 7
one 7
who 7
knows 7
and 7
loves 7
you 7
reassured 7
by 7
the 7
kindness 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
sidinouman 7
at 7
length 7
began 7
his 7
tale 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
said 7
he 7
dazzled 7
though 7
i 7
am 7
by 7
the 7
lustre 7
of 7
your 7
highness 7
presence 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
my 7
best 7
to 7
satisfy 7
your 7
wishes 7
i 7
am 7
by 7
no 7
means 7
perfect 7
but 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
naturally 7
cruel 7
neither 7
do 7
i 7
take 7
pleasure 7
in 7
breaking 7
the 7
law 7
i 7
admit 7
that 7
the 7
treatment 7
of 7
my 7
horse 7
is 7
calculated 7
to 7
give 7
your 7
highness 7
a 7
bad 7
opinion 7
of 7
me 7
and 7
to 7
set 7
an 7
evil 7
example 7
to 7
others 7
yet 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
chastised 7
it 7
without 7
reason 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
hopes 7
that 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
judged 7
more 7
worthy 7
of 7
pity 7
than 7
punishment 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
i 7
will 7
not 7
trouble 7
to 7
describe 7
my 7
birth 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
of 7
sufficient 7
distinction 7
to 7
deserve 7
your 7
highness 7
attention 7
my 7
ancestors 7
were 7
careful 7
people 7
and 7
i 7
inherited 7
enough 7
money 7
to 7
enable 7
me 7
to 7
live 7
comfortably 7
though 7
without 7
show 7
having 7
therefore 7
a 7
modest 7
fortune 7
the 7
only 7
thing 7
wanting 7
to 7
my 7
happiness 7
was 7
a 7
wife 7
who 7
could 7
return 7
my 7
affection 7
but 7
this 7
blessing 7
i 7
was 7
not 7
destined 7
to 7
get 7
for 7
on 7
the 7
very 7
day 7
after 7
my 7
marriage 7
my 7
bride 7
began 7
to 7
try 7
my 7
patience 7
in 7
every 7
way 7
that 7
was 7
most 7
hard 7
to 7
bear 7
now 7
seeing 7
that 7
the 7
customs 7
of 7
our 7
land 7
oblige 7
us 7
to 7
marry 7
without 7
ever 7
beholding 7
the 7
person 7
with 7
whom 7
we 7
are 7
to 7
pass 7
our 7
lives 7
a 7
man 7
has 7
of 7
course 7
no 7
right 7
to 7
complain 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
his 7
wife 7
is 7
not 7
absolutely 7
repulsive 7
or 7
is 7
not 7
positively 7
deformed 7
and 7
whatever 7
defects 7
her 7
body 7
may 7
have 7
pleasant 7
ways 7
and 7
good 7
behaviour 7
will 7
go 7
far 7
to 7
remedy 7
them 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
i 7
saw 7
my 7
wife 7
unveiled 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
been 7
brought 7
to 7
my 7
house 7
with 7
the 7
usual 7
ceremonies 7
i 7
was 7
enchanted 7
to 7
find 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
deceived 7
in 7
regard 7
to 7
the 7
account 7
that 7
had 7
been 7
given 7
me 7
of 7
her 7
beauty 7
i 7
began 7
my 7
married 7
life 7
in 7
high 7
spirits 7
and 7
the 7
best 7
hopes 7
of 7
happiness 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
a 7
grand 7
dinner 7
was 7
served 7
to 7
us 7
but 7
as 7
my 7
wife 7
did 7
not 7
appear 7
i 7
ordered 7
a 7
servant 7
to 7
call 7
her 7
still 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
come 7
and 7
i 7
waited 7
impatiently 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
at 7
last 7
she 7
entered 7
the 7
room 7
and 7
she 7
took 7
our 7
places 7
at 7
the 7
table 7
and 7
plates 7
of 7
rice 7
were 7
set 7
before 7
us 7
i 7
ate 7
mine 7
as 7
was 7
natural 7
with 7
a 7
spoon 7
but 7
great 7
was 7
my 7
surprise 7
to 7
notice 7
that 7
my 7
wife 7
instead 7
of 7
doing 7
the 7
same 7
drew 7
from 7
her 7
pocket 7
a 7
little 7
case 7
from 7
which 7
she 7
selected 7
a 7
long 7
pin 7
and 7
by 7
the 7
help 7
of 7
this 7
pin 7
conveyed 7
her 7
rice 7
grain 7
by 7
grain 7
to 7
her 7
mouth 7
amina 7
i 7
exclaimed 7
in 7
astonishment 7
is 7
that 7
the 7
way 7
you 7
eat 7
rice 7
at 7
home 7
and 7
did 7
you 7
do 7
it 7
because 7
your 7
appetite 7
was 7
so 7
small 7
or 7
did 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
count 7
the 7
grains 7
so 7
that 7
you 7
might 7
never 7
eat 7
more 7
than 7
a 7
certain 7
number 7
if 7
it 7
was 7
from 7
economy 7
and 7
you 7
are 7
anxious 7
to 7
teach 7
me 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
wasteful 7
you 7
have 7
no 7
cause 7
for 7
alarm 7
we 7
shall 7
never 7
ruin 7
ourselves 7
in 7
that 7
way 7
our 7
fortune 7
is 7
large 7
enough 7
for 7
all 7
our 7
needs 7
therefore 7
dear 7
amina 7
do 7
not 7
seek 7
to 7
check 7
yourself 7
but 7
eat 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
you 7
desire 7
as 7
i 7
do 7
in 7
reply 7
to 7
my 7
affectionate 7
words 7
i 7
expected 7
a 7
cheerful 7
answer 7
yet 7
amina 7
said 7
nothing 7
at 7
all 7
but 7
continued 7
to 7
pick 7
her 7
rice 7
as 7
before 7
only 7
at 7
longer 7
and 7
longer 7
intervals 7
and 7
instead 7
of 7
trying 7
the 7
other 7
dishes 7
all 7
she 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
put 7
every 7
now 7
and 7
then 7
a 7
crumb 7
of 7
bread 7
into 7
her 7
mouth 7
that 7
would 7
not 7
have 7
made 7
a 7
meal 7
for 7
a 7
sparrow 7
i 7
felt 7
provoked 7
by 7
her 7
obstinacy 7
but 7
to 7
excuse 7
her 7
to 7
myself 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
i 7
suggested 7
that 7
perhaps 7
she 7
had 7
never 7
been 7
used 7
to 7
eat 7
in 7
the 7
company 7
of 7
men 7
and 7
that 7
her 7
family 7
might 7
have 7
taught 7
her 7
that 7
she 7
ought 7
to 7
behave 7
prudently 7
and 7
discreetly 7
in 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
her 7
husband 7
likewise 7
that 7
she 7
might 7
either 7
have 7
dined 7
already 7
or 7
intend 7
to 7
do 7
so 7
in 7
her 7
own 7
apartments 7
so 7
i 7
took 7
no 7
further 7
notice 7
and 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
left 7
the 7
room 7
secretly 7
much 7
vexed 7
at 7
her 7
strange 7
conduct 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
occurred 7
at 7
supper 7
and 7
all 7
through 7
the 7
next 7
day 7
whenever 7
we 7
ate 7
together 7
it 7
was 7
quite 7
clear 7
that 7
no 7
woman 7
could 7
live 7
upon 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
breadcrumbs 7
and 7
a 7
few 7
grains 7
of 7
rice 7
and 7
i 7
determined 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
how 7
and 7
when 7
she 7
got 7
food 7
i 7
pretended 7
not 7
to 7
pay 7
attention 7
to 7
anything 7
she 7
did 7
in 7
the 7
hope 7
that 7
little 7
by 7
little 7
she 7
would 7
get 7
accustomed 7
to 7
me 7
and 7
become 7
more 7
friendly 7
but 7
i 7
soon 7
saw 7
that 7
my 7
expectations 7
were 7
quite 7
vain 7
one 7
night 7
i 7
was 7
lying 7
with 7
my 7
eyes 7
closed 7
and 7
to 7
all 7
appearance 7
sound 7
asleep 7
when 7
amina 7
arose 7
softly 7
and 7
dressed 7
herself 7
without 7
making 7
the 7
slightest 7
sound 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
imagine 7
what 7
she 7
was 7
going 7
to 7
do 7
and 7
as 7
my 7
curiosity 7
was 7
great 7
i 7
made 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
to 7
follow 7
her 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
fully 7
dressed 7
she 7
stole 7
quietly 7
from 7
the 7
room 7
the 7
instant 7
she 7
had 7
let 7
the 7
curtain 7
fall 7
behind 7
her 7
i 7
flung 7
a 7
garment 7
on 7
my 7
shoulders 7
and 7
a 7
pair 7
of 7
slippers 7
on 7
my 7
feet 7
looking 7
from 7
a 7
lattice 7
which 7
opened 7
into 7
the 7
court 7
i 7
saw 7
her 7
in 7
the 7
act 7
of 7
passing 7
through 7
the 7
street 7
door 7
which 7
she 7
carefully 7
left 7
open 7
it 7
was 7
bright 7
moonlight 7
so 7
i 7
easily 7
managed 7
to 7
keep 7
her 7
in 7
sight 7
till 7
she 7
entered 7
a 7
cemetery 7
not 7
far 7
from 7
the 7
house 7
there 7
i 7
hid 7
myself 7
under 7
the 7
shadow 7
of 7
the 7
wall 7
and 7
crouched 7
down 7
cautiously 7
and 7
hardly 7
was 7
i 7
concealed 7
when 7
i 7
saw 7
my 7
wife 7
approaching 7
in 7
company 7
with 7
a 7
ghoulone 7
of 7
those 7
demons 7
which 7
as 7
your 7
highness 7
is 7
aware 7
wander 7
about 7
the 7
country 7
making 7
their 7
lairs 7
in 7
deserted 7
buildings 7
and 7
springing 7
out 7
upon 7
unwary 7
travellers 7
whose 7
flesh 7
they 7
eat 7
if 7
no 7
live 7
being 7
goes 7
their 7
way 7
they 7
then 7
betake 7
themselves 7
to 7
the 7
cemeteries 7
and 7
feed 7
upon 7
the 7
dead 7
bodies 7
i 7
was 7
nearly 7
struck 7
dumb 7
with 7
horror 7
on 7
seeing 7
my 7
wife 7
with 7
this 7
hideous 7
female 7
ghoul 7
they 7
passed 7
by 7
me 7
without 7
noticing 7
me 7
began 7
to 7
dig 7
up 7
a 7
corpse 7
which 7
had 7
been 7
buried 7
that 7
day 7
and 7
then 7
sat 7
down 7
on 7
the 7
edge 7
of 7
the 7
grave 7
to 7
enjoy 7
their 7
frightful 7
repast 7
talking 7
quietly 7
and 7
cheerfully 7
all 7
the 7
while 7
though 7
i 7
was 7
too 7
far 7
off 7
to 7
hear 7
what 7
they 7
said 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
finished 7
they 7
threw 7
back 7
the 7
body 7
into 7
the 7
grave 7
and 7
heaped 7
back 7
the 7
earth 7
upon 7
it 7
i 7
made 7
no 7
effort 7
to 7
disturb 7
them 7
and 7
returned 7
quickly 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
when 7
i 7
took 7
care 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
door 7
open 7
as 7
i 7
had 7
previously 7
found 7
it 7
then 7
i 7
got 7
back 7
into 7
bed 7
and 7
pretended 7
to 7
sleep 7
soundly 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
after 7
amina 7
entered 7
as 7
quietly 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
gone 7
out 7
she 7
undressed 7
and 7
stole 7
into 7
bed 7
congratulating 7
herself 7
apparently 7
on 7
the 7
cleverness 7
with 7
which 7
she 7
had 7
managed 7
her 7
expedition 7
as 7
may 7
be 7
guessed 7
after 7
such 7
a 7
scene 7
it 7
was 7
long 7
before 7
i 7
could 7
close 7
my 7
eyes 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
sound 7
which 7
called 7
the 7
faithful 7
to 7
prayer 7
i 7
put 7
on 7
my 7
clothes 7
and 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
mosque 7
but 7
even 7
prayer 7
did 7
not 7
restore 7
peace 7
to 7
my 7
troubled 7
spirit 7
and 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
face 7
my 7
wife 7
until 7
i 7
had 7
made 7
up 7
my 7
mind 7
what 7
future 7
course 7
i 7
should 7
pursue 7
in 7
regard 7
to 7
her 7
i 7
therefore 7
spent 7
the 7
morning 7
roaming 7
about 7
from 7
one 7
garden 7
to 7
another 7
turning 7
over 7
various 7
plans 7
for 7
compelling 7
my 7
wife 7
to 7
give 7
up 7
her 7
horrible 7
ways 7
i 7
thought 7
of 7
using 7
violence 7
to 7
make 7
her 7
submit 7
but 7
felt 7
reluctant 7
to 7
be 7
unkind 7
to 7
her 7
besides 7
i 7
had 7
an 7
instinct 7
that 7
gentle 7
means 7
had 7
the 7
best 7
chance 7
of 7
success 7
so 7
a 7
little 7
soothed 7
i 7
turned 7
towards 7
home 7
which 7
i 7
reached 7
about 7
the 7
hour 7
of 7
dinner 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
i 7
appeared 7
amina 7
ordered 7
dinner 7
to 7
be 7
served 7
and 7
we 7
sat 7
down 7
together 7
as 7
usual 7
she 7
persisted 7
in 7
only 7
picking 7
a 7
few 7
grains 7
of 7
rice 7
and 7
i 7
resolved 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
her 7
at 7
once 7
of 7
what 7
lay 7
so 7
heavily 7
on 7
my 7
heart 7
amina 7
i 7
said 7
as 7
quietly 7
as 7
possible 7
you 7
must 7
have 7
guessed 7
the 7
surprise 7
i 7
felt 7
when 7
the 7
day 7
after 7
our 7
marriage 7
you 7
declined 7
to 7
eat 7
anything 7
but 7
a 7
few 7
morsels 7
of 7
rice 7
and 7
altogether 7
behaved 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
manner 7
that 7
most 7
husbands 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
deeply 7
wounded 7
however 7
i 7
had 7
patience 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
only 7
tried 7
to 7
tempt 7
your 7
appetite 7
by 7
the 7
choicest 7
dishes 7
i 7
could 7
invent 7
but 7
all 7
to 7
no 7
purpose 7
still 7
amina 7
it 7
seems 7
to 7
me 7
that 7
there 7
be 7
some 7
among 7
them 7
as 7
sweet 7
to 7
the 7
taste 7
as 7
the 7
flesh 7
of 7
a 7
corpse 7
i 7
had 7
no 7
sooner 7
uttered 7
these 7
words 7
than 7
amina 7
who 7
instantly 7
understood 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
followed 7
her 7
to 7
the 7
graveyard 7
was 7
seized 7
with 7
a 7
passion 7
beyond 7
any 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
ever 7
witnessed 7
her 7
face 7
became 7
purple 7
her 7
eyes 7
looked 7
as 7
if 7
they 7
would 7
start 7
from 7
her 7
head 7
and 7
she 7
positively 7
foamed 7
with 7
rage 7
i 7
watched 7
her 7
with 7
terror 7
wondering 7
what 7
would 7
happen 7
next 7
but 7
little 7
thinking 7
what 7
would 7
be 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
her 7
fury 7
she 7
seized 7
a 7
vessel 7
of 7
water 7
that 7
stood 7
at 7
hand 7
and 7
plunging 7
her 7
hand 7
in 7
it 7
murmured 7
some 7
words 7
i 7
failed 7
to 7
catch 7
then 7
sprinkling 7
it 7
on 7
my 7
face 7
she 7
cried 7
madly 7
wretch 7
receive 7
the 7
reward 7
of 7
your 7
prying 7
and 7
become 7
a 7
dog 7
the 7
words 7
were 7
not 7
out 7
of 7
her 7
mouth 7
when 7
without 7
feeling 7
conscious 7
that 7
any 7
change 7
was 7
passing 7
over 7
me 7
i 7
suddenly 7
knew 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
ceased 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
man 7
in 7
the 7
greatness 7
of 7
the 7
shock 7
and 7
surprisefor 7
i 7
had 7
no 7
idea 7
that 7
amina 7
was 7
a 7
magiciani 7
never 7
dreamed 7
of 7
running 7
away 7
and 7
stood 7
rooted 7
to 7
the 7
spot 7
while 7
amina 7
grasped 7
a 7
stick 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
beat 7
me 7
indeed 7
her 7
blows 7
were 7
so 7
heavy 7
that 7
i 7
only 7
wonder 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
kill 7
me 7
at 7
once 7
however 7
they 7
succeeded 7
in 7
rousing 7
me 7
from 7
my 7
stupor 7
and 7
i 7
dashed 7
into 7
the 7
courtyard 7
followed 7
closely 7
by 7
amina 7
who 7
made 7
frantic 7
dives 7
at 7
me 7
which 7
i 7
was 7
not 7
quick 7
enough 7
to 7
dodge 7
at 7
last 7
she 7
got 7
tired 7
of 7
pursuing 7
me 7
or 7
else 7
a 7
new 7
trick 7
entered 7
into 7
her 7
head 7
which 7
would 7
give 7
me 7
speedy 7
and 7
painful 7
death 7
she 7
opened 7
the 7
gate 7
leading 7
into 7
the 7
street 7
intending 7
to 7
crush 7
me 7
as 7
i 7
passed 7
through 7
dog 7
though 7
i 7
was 7
i 7
saw 7
through 7
her 7
design 7
and 7
stung 7
into 7
presence 7
of 7
mind 7
by 7
the 7
greatness 7
of 7
the 7
danger 7
i 7
timed 7
my 7
movements 7
so 7
well 7
that 7
i 7
contrived 7
to 7
rush 7
through 7
and 7
only 7
the 7
tip 7
of 7
my 7
tail 7
received 7
a 7
squeeze 7
as 7
she 7
banged 7
the 7
gate 7
i 7
was 7
safe 7
but 7
my 7
tail 7
hurt 7
me 7
horribly 7
and 7
i 7
yelped 7
and 7
howled 7
so 7
loud 7
all 7
along 7
the 7
streets 7
that 7
the 7
other 7
dogs 7
came 7
and 7
attacked 7
me 7
which 7
made 7
matters 7
no 7
better 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
avoid 7
them 7
i 7
took 7
refuge 7
in 7
a 7
cookshop 7
where 7
tongues 7
and 7
sheeps 7
heads 7
were 7
sold 7
at 7
first 7
the 7
owner 7
showed 7
me 7
great 7
kindness 7
and 7
drove 7
away 7
the 7
other 7
dogs 7
that 7
were 7
still 7
at 7
my 7
heels 7
while 7
i 7
crept 7
into 7
the 7
darkest 7
corner 7
but 7
though 7
i 7
was 7
safe 7
for 7
the 7
moment 7
i 7
was 7
not 7
destined 7
to 7
remain 7
long 7
under 7
his 7
protection 7
for 7
he 7
was 7
one 7
of 7
those 7
who 7
hold 7
all 7
dogs 7
to 7
be 7
unclean 7
and 7
that 7
all 7
the 7
washing 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
will 7
hardly 7
purify 7
you 7
from 7
their 7
contact 7
so 7
after 7
my 7
enemies 7
had 7
gone 7
to 7
seek 7
other 7
prey 7
he 7
tried 7
to 7
lure 7
me 7
from 7
my 7
corner 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
force 7
me 7
into 7
the 7
street 7
but 7
i 7
refused 7
to 7
come 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
hole 7
and 7
spent 7
the 7
night 7
in 7
sleep 7
which 7
i 7
sorely 7
needed 7
after 7
the 7
pain 7
inflicted 7
on 7
me 7
by 7
amina 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
wish 7
to 7
weary 7
your 7
highness 7
by 7
dwelling 7
on 7
the 7
sad 7
thoughts 7
which 7
accompanied 7
my 7
change 7
of 7
shape 7
but 7
it 7
may 7
interest 7
you 7
to 7
hear 7
that 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
my 7
host 7
went 7
out 7
early 7
to 7
do 7
his 7
marketing 7
and 7
returned 7
laden 7
with 7
the 7
sheeps 7
heads 7
and 7
tongues 7
and 7
trotters 7
that 7
formed 7
his 7
stock 7
in 7
trade 7
for 7
the 7
day 7
the 7
smell 7
of 7
meat 7
attracted 7
various 7
hungry 7
dogs 7
in 7
the 7
neighbourhood 7
and 7
they 7
gathered 7
round 7
the 7
door 7
begging 7
for 7
some 7
bits 7
i 7
stole 7
out 7
of 7
my 7
corner 7
and 7
stood 7
with 7
them 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
his 7
objection 7
to 7
dogs 7
as 7
unclean 7
animals 7
my 7
protector 7
was 7
a 7
kindhearted 7
man 7
and 7
knowing 7
i 7
had 7
eaten 7
nothing 7
since 7
yesterday 7
he 7
threw 7
me 7
bigger 7
and 7
better 7
bits 7
than 7
those 7
which 7
fell 7
to 7
the 7
share 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
dogs 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
finished 7
i 7
tried 7
to 7
go 7
back 7
into 7
the 7
shop 7
but 7
this 7
he 7
would 7
not 7
allow 7
and 7
stood 7
so 7
firmly 7
at 7
the 7
entrance 7
with 7
a 7
stout 7
stick 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
give 7
it 7
up 7
and 7
seek 7
some 7
other 7
home 7
a 7
few 7
paces 7
further 7
on 7
was 7
a 7
bakers 7
shop 7
which 7
seemed 7
to 7
have 7
a 7
gay 7
and 7
merry 7
man 7
for 7
a 7
master 7
at 7
that 7
moment 7
he 7
was 7
having 7
his 7
breakfast 7
and 7
though 7
i 7
gave 7
no 7
signs 7
of 7
hunger 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
threw 7
me 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
bread 7
before 7
gobbling 7
it 7
up 7
as 7
most 7
dogs 7
are 7
in 7
the 7
habit 7
of 7
doing 7
i 7
bowed 7
my 7
head 7
and 7
wagged 7
my 7
tail 7
in 7
token 7
of 7
thanks 7
and 7
he 7
understood 7
and 7
smiled 7
pleasantly 7
i 7
really 7
did 7
not 7
want 7
the 7
bread 7
at 7
all 7
but 7
felt 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
ungracious 7
to 7
refuse 7
so 7
i 7
ate 7
it 7
slowly 7
in 7
order 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
see 7
that 7
i 7
only 7
did 7
it 7
out 7
of 7
politeness 7
he 7
understood 7
this 7
also 7
and 7
seemed 7
quite 7
willing 7
to 7
let 7
me 7
stay 7
in 7
his 7
shop 7
so 7
i 7
sat 7
down 7
with 7
my 7
face 7
to 7
the 7
door 7
to 7
show 7
that 7
i 7
only 7
asked 7
his 7
protection 7
this 7
he 7
gave 7
me 7
and 7
indeed 7
encouraged 7
me 7
to 7
come 7
into 7
the 7
house 7
itself 7
giving 7
me 7
a 7
corner 7
where 7
i 7
might 7
sleep 7
without 7
being 7
in 7
anybodys 7
way 7
the 7
kindness 7
heaped 7
on 7
me 7
by 7
this 7
excellent 7
man 7
was 7
far 7
greater 7
than 7
i 7
could 7
ever 7
have 7
expected 7
he 7
was 7
always 7
affectionate 7
in 7
his 7
manner 7
of 7
treating 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
shared 7
his 7
breakfast 7
dinner 7
and 7
supper 7
while 7
on 7
my 7
side 7
i 7
gave 7
him 7
all 7
the 7
gratitude 7
and 7
attachment 7
to 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
right 7
i 7
sat 7
with 7
my 7
eyes 7
fixed 7
on 7
him 7
and 7
he 7
never 7
left 7
the 7
house 7
without 7
having 7
me 7
at 7
his 7
heels 7
and 7
if 7
it 7
ever 7
happened 7
that 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
preparing 7
to 7
go 7
out 7
i 7
was 7
asleep 7
and 7
did 7
not 7
notice 7
he 7
would 7
call 7
rufus 7
rufus 7
for 7
that 7
was 7
the 7
name 7
he 7
gave 7
me 7
some 7
weeks 7
passed 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
when 7
one 7
day 7
a 7
woman 7
came 7
in 7
to 7
buy 7
bread 7
in 7
paying 7
for 7
it 7
she 7
laid 7
down 7
several 7
pieces 7
of 7
money 7
one 7
of 7
which 7
was 7
bad 7
the 7
baker 7
perceived 7
this 7
and 7
declined 7
to 7
take 7
it 7
demanding 7
another 7
in 7
its 7
place 7
the 7
woman 7
for 7
her 7
part 7
refused 7
to 7
take 7
it 7
back 7
declaring 7
it 7
was 7
perfectly 7
good 7
but 7
the 7
baker 7
would 7
have 7
nothing 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
it 7
it 7
is 7
really 7
such 7
a 7
bad 7
imitation 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
at 7
last 7
that 7
even 7
my 7
dog 7
would 7
not 7
be 7
taken 7
in 7
here 7
rufus 7
rufus 7
and 7
hearing 7
his 7
voice 7
i 7
jumped 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
counter 7
the 7
baker 7
threw 7
down 7
the 7
money 7
before 7
me 7
and 7
said 7
find 7
out 7
if 7
there 7
is 7
a 7
bad 7
coin 7
i 7
looked 7
at 7
each 7
in 7
turn 7
and 7
then 7
laid 7
my 7
paw 7
on 7
the 7
false 7
one 7
glancing 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
at 7
my 7
master 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
point 7
it 7
out 7
the 7
baker 7
who 7
had 7
of 7
course 7
been 7
only 7
in 7
joke 7
was 7
exceedingly 7
surprised 7
at 7
my 7
cleverness 7
and 7
the 7
woman 7
who 7
was 7
at 7
last 7
convinced 7
that 7
the 7
man 7
spoke 7
the 7
truth 7
produced 7
another 7
piece 7
of 7
money 7
in 7
its 7
place 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
gone 7
my 7
master 7
was 7
so 7
pleased 7
that 7
he 7
told 7
all 7
the 7
neighbours 7
what 7
i 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
made 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
more 7
of 7
it 7
than 7
there 7
really 7
was 7
the 7
neighbours 7
very 7
naturally 7
declined 7
to 7
believe 7
his 7
story 7
and 7
tried 7
me 7
several 7
times 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
bad 7
money 7
they 7
could 7
collect 7
together 7
but 7
i 7
never 7
failed 7
to 7
stand 7
the 7
test 7
triumphantly 7
soon 7
the 7
shop 7
was 7
filled 7
from 7
morning 7
till 7
night 7
with 7
people 7
who 7
on 7
the 7
pretence 7
of 7
buying 7
bread 7
came 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
i 7
was 7
as 7
clever 7
as 7
i 7
was 7
reported 7
to 7
be 7
the 7
baker 7
drove 7
a 7
roaring 7
trade 7
and 7
admitted 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
worth 7
my 7
weight 7
in 7
gold 7
to 7
him 7
of 7
course 7
there 7
were 7
plenty 7
who 7
envied 7
him 7
his 7
large 7
custom 7
and 7
many 7
was 7
the 7
pitfall 7
set 7
for 7
me 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
never 7
dared 7
to 7
let 7
me 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
sight 7
one 7
day 7
a 7
woman 7
who 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
in 7
the 7
shop 7
before 7
came 7
to 7
ask 7
for 7
bread 7
like 7
the 7
rest 7
as 7
usual 7
i 7
was 7
lying 7
on 7
the 7
counter 7
and 7
she 7
threw 7
down 7
six 7
coins 7
before 7
me 7
one 7
of 7
which 7
was 7
false 7
i 7
detected 7
it 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
put 7
my 7
paw 7
on 7
it 7
looking 7
as 7
i 7
did 7
so 7
at 7
the 7
woman 7
yes 7
she 7
said 7
nodding 7
her 7
head 7
you 7
are 7
quite 7
right 7
that 7
is 7
the 7
one 7
she 7
stood 7
gazing 7
at 7
me 7
attentively 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
then 7
paid 7
for 7
the 7
bread 7
and 7
left 7
the 7
shop 7
making 7
a 7
sign 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
follow 7
her 7
secretly 7
now 7
my 7
thoughts 7
were 7
always 7
running 7
on 7
some 7
means 7
of 7
shaking 7
off 7
the 7
spell 7
laid 7
on 7
me 7
and 7
noticing 7
the 7
way 7
in 7
which 7
this 7
woman 7
had 7
looked 7
at 7
me 7
the 7
idea 7
entered 7
my 7
head 7
that 7
perhaps 7
she 7
might 7
have 7
guessed 7
what 7
had 7
happened 7
and 7
in 7
this 7
i 7
was 7
not 7
deceived 7
however 7
i 7
let 7
her 7
go 7
on 7
a 7
little 7
way 7
and 7
merely 7
stood 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
watching 7
her 7
she 7
turned 7
and 7
seeing 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
quite 7
still 7
she 7
again 7
beckoned 7
to 7
me 7
the 7
baker 7
all 7
this 7
while 7
was 7
busy 7
with 7
his 7
oven 7
and 7
had 7
forgotten 7
all 7
about 7
me 7
so 7
i 7
stole 7
out 7
softly 7
and 7
ran 7
after 7
the 7
woman 7
when 7
we 7
came 7
to 7
her 7
house 7
which 7
was 7
some 7
distance 7
off 7
she 7
opened 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
then 7
said 7
to 7
me 7
come 7
in 7
come 7
in 7
you 7
will 7
never 7
be 7
sorry 7
that 7
you 7
followed 7
me 7
when 7
i 7
had 7
entered 7
she 7
fastened 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
took 7
me 7
into 7
a 7
large 7
room 7
where 7
a 7
beautiful 7
girl 7
was 7
working 7
at 7
a 7
piece 7
of 7
embroidery 7
my 7
daughter 7
exclaimed 7
my 7
guide 7
i 7
have 7
brought 7
you 7
the 7
famous 7
dog 7
belonging 7
to 7
the 7
baker 7
which 7
can 7
tell 7
good 7
money 7
from 7
bad 7
you 7
know 7
that 7
when 7
i 7
first 7
heard 7
of 7
him 7
i 7
told 7
you 7
i 7
was 7
sure 7
he 7
must 7
be 7
really 7
a 7
man 7
changed 7
into 7
a 7
dog 7
by 7
magic 7
today 7
i 7
went 7
to 7
the 7
bakers 7
to 7
prove 7
for 7
myself 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
the 7
story 7
and 7
persuaded 7
the 7
dog 7
to 7
follow 7
me 7
here 7
now 7
what 7
do 7
you 7
say 7
you 7
are 7
right 7
mother 7
replied 7
the 7
girl 7
and 7
rising 7
she 7
dipped 7
her 7
hand 7
into 7
a 7
vessel 7
of 7
water 7
then 7
sprinkling 7
it 7
over 7
me 7
she 7
said 7
if 7
you 7
were 7
born 7
dog 7
remain 7
dog 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
were 7
born 7
man 7
by 7
virtue 7
of 7
this 7
water 7
resume 7
your 7
proper 7
form 7
in 7
one 7
moment 7
the 7
spell 7
was 7
broken 7
the 7
dogs 7
shape 7
vanished 7
as 7
if 7
it 7
had 7
never 7
been 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
man 7
who 7
stood 7
before 7
her 7
overcome 7
with 7
gratitude 7
at 7
my 7
deliverance 7
i 7
flung 7
myself 7
at 7
her 7
feet 7
and 7
kissed 7
the 7
hem 7
of 7
her 7
garment 7
how 7
can 7
i 7
thank 7
you 7
for 7
your 7
goodness 7
towards 7
a 7
stranger 7
and 7
for 7
what 7
you 7
have 7
done 7
henceforth 7
i 7
am 7
your 7
slave 7
deal 7
with 7
me 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
then 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
explain 7
how 7
i 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
changed 7
into 7
a 7
dog 7
i 7
told 7
her 7
my 7
whole 7
story 7
and 7
finished 7
with 7
rendering 7
the 7
mother 7
the 7
thanks 7
due 7
to 7
her 7
for 7
the 7
happiness 7
she 7
had 7
brought 7
me 7
sidinouman 7
returned 7
the 7
daughter 7
say 7
no 7
more 7
about 7
the 7
obligation 7
you 7
are 7
under 7
to 7
us 7
the 7
knowledge 7
that 7
we 7
have 7
been 7
of 7
service 7
to 7
you 7
is 7
ample 7
payment 7
let 7
us 7
speak 7
of 7
amina 7
your 7
wife 7
with 7
whom 7
i 7
was 7
acquainted 7
before 7
her 7
marriage 7
i 7
was 7
aware 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
a 7
magician 7
and 7
she 7
knew 7
too 7
that 7
i 7
had 7
studied 7
the 7
same 7
art 7
under 7
the 7
same 7
mistress 7
we 7
met 7
often 7
going 7
to 7
the 7
same 7
baths 7
but 7
we 7
did 7
not 7
like 7
each 7
other 7
and 7
never 7
sought 7
to 7
become 7
friends 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
concerns 7
you 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
enough 7
to 7
have 7
broken 7
your 7
spell 7
she 7
must 7
be 7
punished 7
for 7
her 7
wickedness 7
remain 7
for 7
a 7
moment 7
with 7
my 7
mother 7
i 7
beg 7
she 7
added 7
hastily 7
i 7
will 7
return 7
shortly 7
left 7
alone 7
with 7
the 7
mother 7
i 7
again 7
expressed 7
the 7
gratitude 7
i 7
felt 7
to 7
her 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
to 7
her 7
daughter 7
my 7
daughter 7
she 7
answered 7
is 7
as 7
you 7
see 7
as 7
accomplished 7
a 7
magician 7
as 7
amina 7
herself 7
but 7
you 7
would 7
be 7
astonished 7
at 7
the 7
amount 7
of 7
good 7
she 7
does 7
by 7
her 7
knowledge 7
that 7
is 7
why 7
i 7
have 7
never 7
interfered 7
otherwise 7
i 7
should 7
have 7
put 7
a 7
stop 7
to 7
it 7
long 7
ago 7
as 7
she 7
spoke 7
her 7
daughter 7
entered 7
with 7
a 7
small 7
bottle 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
sidinouman 7
she 7
said 7
the 7
books 7
i 7
have 7
just 7
consulted 7
tell 7
me 7
that 7
amina 7
is 7
not 7
home 7
at 7
present 7
but 7
she 7
should 7
return 7
at 7
any 7
moment 7
i 7
have 7
likewise 7
found 7
out 7
by 7
their 7
means 7
that 7
she 7
pretends 7
before 7
the 7
servants 7
great 7
uneasiness 7
as 7
to 7
your 7
absence 7
she 7
has 7
circulated 7
a 7
story 7
that 7
while 7
at 7
dinner 7
with 7
her 7
you 7
remembered 7
some 7
important 7
business 7
that 7
had 7
to 7
be 7
done 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
left 7
the 7
house 7
without 7
shutting 7
the 7
door 7
by 7
this 7
means 7
a 7
dog 7
had 7
strayed 7
in 7
which 7
she 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
get 7
rid 7
of 7
by 7
a 7
stick 7
go 7
home 7
then 7
without 7
delay 7
and 7
await 7
aminas 7
return 7
in 7
your 7
room 7
when 7
she 7
comes 7
in 7
go 7
down 7
to 7
meet 7
her 7
and 7
in 7
her 7
surprise 7
she 7
will 7
try 7
to 7
run 7
away 7
then 7
have 7
this 7
bottle 7
ready 7
and 7
dash 7
the 7
water 7
it 7
contains 7
over 7
her 7
saying 7
boldly 7
receive 7
the 7
reward 7
of 7
your 7
crimes 7
that 7
is 7
all 7
i 7
have 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
everything 7
happened 7
exactly 7
as 7
the 7
young 7
magician 7
had 7
foretold 7
i 7
had 7
not 7
been 7
in 7
my 7
house 7
many 7
minutes 7
before 7
amina 7
returned 7
and 7
as 7
she 7
approached 7
i 7
stepped 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
her 7
with 7
the 7
water 7
in 7
my 7
hand 7
she 7
gave 7
one 7
loud 7
cry 7
and 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
door 7
but 7
she 7
was 7
too 7
late 7
i 7
had 7
already 7
dashed 7
the 7
water 7
in 7
her 7
face 7
and 7
spoken 7
the 7
magic 7
words 7
amina 7
disappeared 7
and 7
in 7
her 7
place 7
stood 7
the 7
horse 7
you 7
saw 7
me 7
beating 7
yesterday 7
this 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
is 7
my 7
story 7
and 7
may 7
i 7
venture 7
to 7
hope 7
that 7
now 7
you 7
have 7
heard 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
my 7
conduct 7
your 7
highness 7
will 7
not 7
think 7
this 7
wicked 7
woman 7
too 7
harshly 7
treated 7
sidinouman 7
replied 7
the 7
caliph 7
your 7
story 7
is 7
indeed 7
a 7
strange 7
one 7
and 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
excuse 7
to 7
be 7
offered 7
for 7
your 7
wife 7
but 7
without 7
condemning 7
your 7
treatment 7
of 7
her 7
i 7
wish 7
you 7
to 7
reflect 7
how 7
much 7
she 7
must 7
suffer 7
from 7
being 7
changed 7
into 7
an 7
animal 7
and 7
i 7
hope 7
you 7
will 7
let 7
that 7
punishment 7
be 7
enough 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
order 7
you 7
to 7
insist 7
upon 7
the 7
young 7
magician 7
finding 7
the 7
means 7
to 7
restore 7
your 7
wife 7
to 7
her 7
human 7
shape 7
because 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
when 7
once 7
women 7
such 7
as 7
she 7
begin 7
to 7
work 7
evil 7
they 7
never 7
leave 7
off 7
and 7
i 7
should 7
only 7
bring 7
down 7
on 7
your 7
head 7
a 7
vengeance 7
far 7
worse 7
than 7
the 7
one 7
you 7
have 7
undergone 7
already 7
story 7
of 7
ali 7
colia 7
merchant 7
of 7
bagdad 7
in 7
the 7
reign 7
of 7
harounalraschid 7
there 7
lived 7
in 7
bagdad 7
a 7
merchant 7
named 7
ali 7
cogia 7
who 7
having 7
neither 7
wife 7
nor 7
child 7
contented 7
himself 7
with 7
the 7
modest 7
profits 7
produced 7
by 7
his 7
trade 7
he 7
had 7
spent 7
some 7
years 7
quite 7
happily 7
in 7
the 7
house 7
his 7
father 7
had 7
left 7
him 7
when 7
three 7
nights 7
running 7
he 7
dreamed 7
that 7
an 7
old 7
man 7
had 7
appeared 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
reproached 7
him 7
for 7
having 7
neglected 7
the 7
duty 7
of 7
a 7
good 7
mussulman 7
in 7
delaying 7
so 7
long 7
his 7
pilgrimage 7
to 7
mecca 7
ali 7
cogia 7
was 7
much 7
troubled 7
by 7
this 7
dream 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
unwilling 7
to 7
give 7
up 7
his 7
shop 7
and 7
lose 7
all 7
his 7
customers 7
he 7
had 7
shut 7
his 7
eyes 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
to 7
the 7
necessity 7
of 7
performing 7
this 7
pilgrimage 7
and 7
tried 7
to 7
atone 7
to 7
his 7
conscience 7
by 7
an 7
extra 7
number 7
of 7
good 7
works 7
but 7
the 7
dream 7
seemed 7
to 7
him 7
a 7
direct 7
warning 7
and 7
he 7
resolved 7
to 7
put 7
the 7
journey 7
off 7
no 7
longer 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
he 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
sell 7
his 7
furniture 7
and 7
the 7
wares 7
he 7
had 7
in 7
his 7
shop 7
only 7
reserving 7
to 7
himself 7
such 7
goods 7
as 7
he 7
might 7
trade 7
with 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
the 7
shop 7
itself 7
he 7
sold 7
also 7
and 7
easily 7
found 7
a 7
tenant 7
for 7
his 7
private 7
house 7
the 7
only 7
matter 7
he 7
could 7
not 7
settle 7
satisfactorily 7
was 7
the 7
safe 7
custody 7
of 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
which 7
he 7
wished 7
to 7
leave 7
behind 7
him 7
after 7
some 7
thought 7
ali 7
cogia 7
hit 7
upon 7
a 7
plan 7
which 7
seemed 7
a 7
safe 7
one 7
he 7
took 7
a 7
large 7
vase 7
and 7
placing 7
the 7
money 7
in 7
the 7
bottom 7
of 7
it 7
filled 7
up 7
the 7
rest 7
with 7
olives 7
after 7
corking 7
the 7
vase 7
tightly 7
down 7
he 7
carried 7
it 7
to 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
friends 7
a 7
merchant 7
like 7
himself 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
him 7
my 7
brother 7
you 7
have 7
probably 7
heard 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
staffing 7
with 7
a 7
caravan 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
for 7
mecca 7
i 7
have 7
come 7
to 7
ask 7
whether 7
you 7
would 7
do 7
me 7
the 7
favour 7
to 7
keep 7
this 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
for 7
me 7
till 7
i 7
come 7
back 7
the 7
merchant 7
replied 7
readily 7
look 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
key 7
of 7
my 7
shop 7
take 7
it 7
and 7
put 7
the 7
vase 7
wherever 7
you 7
like 7
i 7
promise 7
that 7
you 7
shall 7
find 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
place 7
on 7
your 7
return 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
later 7
ali 7
cogia 7
mounted 7
the 7
camel 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
laden 7
with 7
merchandise 7
joined 7
the 7
caravan 7
and 7
arrived 7
in 7
due 7
time 7
at 7
mecca 7
like 7
the 7
other 7
pilgrims 7
he 7
visited 7
the 7
sacred 7
mosque 7
and 7
after 7
all 7
his 7
religious 7
duties 7
were 7
performed 7
he 7
set 7
out 7
his 7
goods 7
to 7
the 7
best 7
advantage 7
hoping 7
to 7
gain 7
some 7
customers 7
among 7
the 7
passersby 7
very 7
soon 7
two 7
merchants 7
stopped 7
before 7
the 7
pile 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
turned 7
it 7
over 7
one 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
if 7
this 7
man 7
was 7
wise 7
he 7
would 7
take 7
these 7
things 7
to 7
cairo 7
where 7
he 7
would 7
get 7
a 7
much 7
better 7
price 7
than 7
he 7
is 7
likely 7
to 7
do 7
here 7
ali 7
cogia 7
heard 7
the 7
words 7
and 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
following 7
the 7
advice 7
he 7
packed 7
up 7
his 7
wares 7
and 7
instead 7
of 7
returning 7
to 7
bagdad 7
joined 7
a 7
caravan 7
that 7
was 7
going 7
to 7
cairo 7
the 7
results 7
of 7
the 7
journey 7
gladdened 7
his 7
heart 7
he 7
sold 7
off 7
everything 7
almost 7
directly 7
and 7
bought 7
a 7
stock 7
of 7
egyptian 7
curiosities 7
which 7
he 7
intended 7
selling 7
at 7
damascus 7
but 7
as 7
the 7
caravan 7
with 7
which 7
he 7
would 7
have 7
to 7
travel 7
would 7
not 7
be 7
starting 7
for 7
another 7
six 7
weeks 7
he 7
took 7
advantage 7
of 7
the 7
delay 7
to 7
visit 7
the 7
pyramids 7
and 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
cities 7
along 7
the 7
banks 7
of 7
the 7
nile 7
now 7
the 7
attractions 7
of 7
damascus 7
so 7
fascinated 7
the 7
worthy 7
ali 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
hardly 7
tear 7
himself 7
away 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
he 7
remembered 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
home 7
in 7
bagdad 7
meaning 7
to 7
return 7
by 7
way 7
of 7
aleppo 7
and 7
after 7
he 7
had 7
crossed 7
the 7
euphrates 7
to 7
follow 7
the 7
course 7
of 7
the 7
tigris 7
but 7
when 7
he 7
reached 7
mossoul 7
ali 7
had 7
made 7
such 7
friends 7
with 7
some 7
persian 7
merchants 7
that 7
they 7
persuaded 7
him 7
to 7
accompany 7
them 7
to 7
their 7
native 7
land 7
and 7
even 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
india 7
and 7
so 7
it 7
came 7
to 7
pass 7
that 7
seven 7
years 7
had 7
slipped 7
by 7
since 7
he 7
had 7
left 7
bagdad 7
and 7
during 7
all 7
that 7
time 7
the 7
friend 7
with 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
left 7
the 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
had 7
never 7
once 7
thought 7
of 7
him 7
or 7
of 7
it 7
in 7
fact 7
it 7
was 7
only 7
a 7
month 7
before 7
ali 7
cogias 7
actual 7
return 7
that 7
the 7
affair 7
came 7
into 7
his 7
head 7
at 7
all 7
owing 7
to 7
his 7
wifes 7
remarking 7
one 7
day 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
long 7
time 7
since 7
she 7
had 7
eaten 7
any 7
olives 7
and 7
would 7
like 7
some 7
that 7
reminds 7
me 7
said 7
the 7
husband 7
that 7
before 7
ali 7
cogia 7
went 7
to 7
mecca 7
seven 7
years 7
ago 7
he 7
left 7
a 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
in 7
my 7
care 7
but 7
really 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
he 7
must 7
be 7
dead 7
and 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
reason 7
we 7
should 7
not 7
eat 7
the 7
olives 7
if 7
we 7
like 7
give 7
me 7
a 7
light 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
fetch 7
them 7
and 7
see 7
how 7
they 7
taste 7
my 7
husband 7
answered 7
the 7
wife 7
beware 7
i 7
pray 7
of 7
your 7
doing 7
anything 7
so 7
base 7
supposing 7
seven 7
years 7
have 7
passed 7
without 7
news 7
of 7
ali 7
cogia 7
he 7
need 7
not 7
be 7
dead 7
for 7
all 7
that 7
and 7
may 7
come 7
back 7
any 7
day 7
how 7
shameful 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
to 7
have 7
to 7
confess 7
that 7
you 7
had 7
betrayed 7
your 7
trust 7
and 7
broken 7
the 7
seal 7
of 7
the 7
vase 7
pay 7
no 7
attention 7
to 7
my 7
idle 7
words 7
i 7
really 7
have 7
no 7
desire 7
for 7
olives 7
now 7
and 7
probably 7
after 7
all 7
this 7
while 7
they 7
are 7
no 7
longer 7
good 7
i 7
have 7
a 7
presentiment 7
that 7
ali 7
cogia 7
will 7
return 7
and 7
what 7
will 7
he 7
think 7
of 7
you 7
give 7
it 7
up 7
i 7
entreat 7
the 7
merchant 7
however 7
refused 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
her 7
advice 7
sensible 7
though 7
it 7
was 7
he 7
took 7
a 7
light 7
and 7
a 7
dish 7
and 7
went 7
into 7
his 7
shop 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
so 7
obstinate 7
said 7
his 7
wife 7
i 7
cannot 7
help 7
it 7
but 7
do 7
not 7
blame 7
me 7
if 7
it 7
turns 7
out 7
ill 7
when 7
the 7
merchant 7
opened 7
the 7
vase 7
he 7
found 7
the 7
topmost 7
olives 7
were 7
rotten 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
see 7
if 7
the 7
under 7
ones 7
were 7
in 7
better 7
condition 7
he 7
shook 7
some 7
ont 7
into 7
the 7
dish 7
as 7
they 7
fell 7
out 7
a 7
few 7
of 7
the 7
gold 7
pieces 7
fell 7
out 7
too 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
money 7
roused 7
all 7
the 7
merchants 7
greed 7
he 7
looked 7
into 7
the 7
vase 7
and 7
saw 7
that 7
all 7
the 7
bottom 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
gold 7
he 7
then 7
replaced 7
the 7
olives 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
his 7
wife 7
my 7
wife 7
he 7
said 7
as 7
he 7
entered 7
the 7
room 7
you 7
were 7
quite 7
right 7
the 7
olives 7
are 7
rotten 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
recorked 7
the 7
vase 7
so 7
well 7
that 7
ali 7
cogia 7
will 7
never 7
know 7
it 7
has 7
been 7
touched 7
you 7
would 7
have 7
done 7
better 7
to 7
believe 7
me 7
replied 7
the 7
wife 7
i 7
trust 7
that 7
no 7
harm 7
will 7
come 7
of 7
it 7
these 7
words 7
made 7
no 7
more 7
impression 7
on 7
the 7
merchant 7
than 7
the 7
others 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
he 7
spent 7
the 7
whole 7
night 7
in 7
wondering 7
how 7
he 7
could 7
manage 7
to 7
keep 7
the 7
gold 7
if 7
ali 7
cogia 7
should 7
come 7
back 7
and 7
claim 7
his 7
vase 7
very 7
early 7
next 7
morning 7
he 7
went 7
out 7
and 7
bought 7
fresh 7
new 7
olives 7
he 7
then 7
threw 7
away 7
the 7
old 7
ones 7
took 7
out 7
the 7
gold 7
and 7
hid 7
it 7
and 7
filled 7
up 7
the 7
vase 7
with 7
the 7
olives 7
he 7
had 7
bought 7
this 7
done 7
he 7
recorked 7
the 7
vase 7
and 7
put 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
place 7
where 7
it 7
had 7
been 7
left 7
by 7
ali 7
cogia 7
a 7
month 7
later 7
ali 7
cogia 7
reentered 7
bagdad 7
and 7
as 7
his 7
house 7
was 7
still 7
let 7
he 7
went 7
to 7
an 7
inn 7
and 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
set 7
out 7
to 7
see 7
his 7
friend 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
received 7
him 7
with 7
open 7
arms 7
and 7
many 7
expressions 7
of 7
surprise 7
after 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
given 7
to 7
inquiries 7
ali 7
cogia 7
begged 7
the 7
merchant 7
to 7
hand 7
him 7
over 7
the 7
vase 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
taken 7
care 7
of 7
for 7
so 7
long 7
oh 7
certainly 7
said 7
he 7
i 7
am 7
only 7
glad 7
i 7
could 7
be 7
of 7
use 7
to 7
you 7
in 7
the 7
matter 7
here 7
is 7
the 7
key 7
of 7
my 7
shop 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
the 7
vase 7
in 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
you 7
put 7
it 7
ali 7
cogia 7
fetched 7
his 7
vase 7
and 7
carried 7
it 7
to 7
his 7
room 7
at 7
the 7
inn 7
where 7
he 7
opened 7
it 7
he 7
thrust 7
down 7
his 7
hand 7
but 7
could 7
feel 7
no 7
money 7
but 7
still 7
was 7
persuaded 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
there 7
so 7
he 7
got 7
some 7
plates 7
and 7
vessels 7
from 7
his 7
travelling 7
kit 7
and 7
emptied 7
ont 7
the 7
olives 7
to 7
no 7
purpose 7
the 7
gold 7
was 7
not 7
there 7
the 7
poor 7
man 7
was 7
dumb 7
with 7
horror 7
then 7
lifting 7
up 7
his 7
hands 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
can 7
my 7
old 7
friend 7
really 7
have 7
committed 7
such 7
a 7
crime 7
in 7
great 7
haste 7
he 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
of 7
the 7
merchant 7
my 7
friend 7
he 7
cried 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
astonished 7
to 7
see 7
me 7
again 7
but 7
i 7
can 7
find 7
nowhere 7
in 7
this 7
vase 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
that 7
i 7
placed 7
in 7
the 7
bottom 7
under 7
the 7
olives 7
perhaps 7
you 7
may 7
have 7
taken 7
a 7
loan 7
of 7
them 7
for 7
your 7
business 7
purposes 7
if 7
that 7
is 7
so 7
you 7
are 7
most 7
welcome 7
i 7
will 7
only 7
ask 7
you 7
to 7
give 7
me 7
a 7
receipt 7
and 7
you 7
can 7
pay 7
the 7
money 7
at 7
your 7
leisure 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
had 7
expected 7
something 7
of 7
the 7
sort 7
had 7
his 7
reply 7
all 7
ready 7
ali 7
cogia 7
he 7
said 7
when 7
you 7
brought 7
me 7
the 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
did 7
i 7
ever 7
touch 7
it 7
i 7
gave 7
you 7
the 7
key 7
of 7
my 7
shop 7
and 7
you 7
put 7
it 7
yourself 7
where 7
you 7
liked 7
and 7
did 7
you 7
not 7
find 7
it 7
in 7
exactly 7
the 7
same 7
spot 7
and 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
state 7
if 7
you 7
placed 7
any 7
gold 7
in 7
it 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
there 7
still 7
i 7
know 7
nothing 7
about 7
that 7
you 7
only 7
told 7
me 7
there 7
were 7
olives 7
you 7
can 7
believe 7
me 7
or 7
not 7
but 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
laid 7
a 7
finger 7
on 7
the 7
vase 7
ali 7
cogia 7
still 7
tried 7
every 7
means 7
to 7
persuade 7
the 7
merchant 7
to 7
admit 7
the 7
truth 7
i 7
love 7
peace 7
he 7
said 7
and 7
shall 7
deeply 7
regret 7
having 7
to 7
resort 7
to 7
harsh 7
measures 7
once 7
more 7
think 7
of 7
your 7
reputation 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
in 7
despair 7
if 7
you 7
oblige 7
me 7
to 7
call 7
in 7
the 7
aid 7
of 7
the 7
law 7
ali 7
cogia 7
answered 7
the 7
merchant 7
you 7
allow 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
you 7
placed 7
in 7
my 7
charge 7
you 7
fetched 7
it 7
and 7
removed 7
it 7
yourself 7
and 7
now 7
you 7
tell 7
me 7
it 7
contained 7
a 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
and 7
that 7
i 7
must 7
restore 7
them 7
to 7
you 7
did 7
you 7
ever 7
say 7
anything 7
about 7
them 7
before 7
why 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
even 7
know 7
that 7
the 7
vase 7
had 7
olives 7
in 7
it 7
yon 7
never 7
showed 7
them 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
wonder 7
you 7
have 7
not 7
demanded 7
pearls 7
or 7
diamonds 7
retire 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
lest 7
a 7
crowd 7
should 7
gather 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
my 7
shop 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
not 7
only 7
the 7
casual 7
passersby 7
but 7
also 7
the 7
neighbouring 7
merchants 7
were 7
standing 7
round 7
listening 7
to 7
the 7
dispute 7
and 7
trying 7
every 7
now 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
smooth 7
matters 7
between 7
them 7
but 7
at 7
the 7
merchants 7
last 7
words 7
ali 7
cogia 7
resolved 7
to 7
lay 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
the 7
quarrel 7
before 7
them 7
and 7
told 7
them 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
they 7
heard 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
end 7
and 7
inquired 7
of 7
the 7
merchant 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
say 7
the 7
accused 7
man 7
admitted 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
kept 7
ali 7
cogias 7
vase 7
in 7
his 7
shop 7
but 7
he 7
denied 7
having 7
touched 7
it 7
and 7
swore 7
that 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
it 7
contained 7
he 7
only 7
knew 7
what 7
ali 7
cogia 7
had 7
told 7
him 7
and 7
called 7
them 7
all 7
to 7
witness 7
the 7
insult 7
that 7
had 7
been 7
put 7
upon 7
him 7
you 7
have 7
brought 7
it 7
on 7
yourself 7
said 7
ali 7
cogia 7
taking 7
him 7
by 7
the 7
arm 7
and 7
as 7
you 7
appeal 7
to 7
the 7
law 7
the 7
law 7
you 7
shall 7
have 7
let 7
us 7
see 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
dare 7
to 7
repeat 7
your 7
story 7
before 7
the 7
cadi 7
now 7
as 7
a 7
good 7
mussulman 7
the 7
merchant 7
was 7
forbidden 7
to 7
refuse 7
this 7
choice 7
of 7
a 7
judge 7
so 7
he 7
accepted 7
the 7
test 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
ali 7
cogia 7
very 7
well 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
nothing 7
better 7
we 7
shall 7
soon 7
see 7
which 7
of 7
us 7
is 7
in 7
the 7
right 7
so 7
the 7
two 7
men 7
presented 7
themselves 7
before 7
the 7
cadi 7
and 7
ali 7
cogia 7
again 7
repeated 7
his 7
tale 7
the 7
cadi 7
asked 7
what 7
witnesses 7
he 7
had 7
ali 7
cogia 7
replied 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
taken 7
this 7
precaution 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
considered 7
the 7
man 7
his 7
friend 7
and 7
up 7
to 7
that 7
time 7
had 7
always 7
found 7
him 7
honest 7
the 7
merchant 7
on 7
his 7
side 7
stuck 7
to 7
his 7
story 7
and 7
offered 7
to 7
swear 7
solemnly 7
that 7
not 7
only 7
had 7
he 7
never 7
stolen 7
the 7
thousand 7
gold 7
pieces 7
but 7
that 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
even 7
know 7
they 7
were 7
there 7
the 7
cadi 7
allowed 7
him 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
oath 7
and 7
pronounced 7
him 7
innocent 7
ali 7
cogia 7
furious 7
at 7
having 7
to 7
suffer 7
such 7
a 7
loss 7
protested 7
against 7
the 7
verdict 7
declaring 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
appeal 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
harounalraschid 7
himself 7
but 7
the 7
cadi 7
paid 7
no 7
attention 7
to 7
his 7
threats 7
and 7
was 7
quite 7
satisfied 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
what 7
was 7
right 7
judgment 7
being 7
given 7
the 7
merchant 7
returned 7
home 7
triumphant 7
and 7
ali 7
cogia 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
his 7
inn 7
to 7
draw 7
up 7
a 7
petition 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
he 7
placed 7
himself 7
on 7
the 7
road 7
along 7
which 7
the 7
caliph 7
must 7
pass 7
after 7
midday 7
prayer 7
and 7
stretched 7
out 7
his 7
petition 7
to 7
the 7
officer 7
who 7
walked 7
before 7
the 7
caliph 7
whose 7
duty 7
it 7
was 7
to 7
collect 7
such 7
things 7
and 7
on 7
entering 7
the 7
palace 7
to 7
hand 7
them 7
to 7
his 7
master 7
there 7
harounalraschid 7
studied 7
them 7
carefully 7
knowing 7
this 7
custom 7
ali 7
cogia 7
followed 7
the 7
caliph 7
into 7
the 7
public 7
hall 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
waited 7
the 7
result 7
after 7
some 7
time 7
the 7
officer 7
appeared 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
the 7
caliph 7
had 7
read 7
his 7
petition 7
and 7
had 7
appointed 7
an 7
hour 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
to 7
give 7
him 7
audience 7
he 7
then 7
inquired 7
the 7
merchants 7
address 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
be 7
summoned 7
to 7
attend 7
also 7
that 7
very 7
evening 7
the 7
caliph 7
with 7
his 7
grandvizir 7
giafar 7
and 7
mesrour 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
all 7
three 7
disguised 7
as 7
was 7
their 7
habit 7
went 7
out 7
to 7
take 7
a 7
stroll 7
through 7
the 7
town 7
going 7
down 7
one 7
street 7
the 7
caliphs 7
attention 7
was 7
attracted 7
by 7
a 7
noise 7
and 7
looking 7
through 7
a 7
door 7
which 7
opened 7
into 7
a 7
court 7
he 7
perceived 7
ten 7
or 7
twelve 7
children 7
playing 7
in 7
the 7
moonlight 7
he 7
hid 7
himself 7
in 7
a 7
dark 7
corner 7
and 7
watched 7
them 7
let 7
us 7
play 7
at 7
being 7
the 7
cadi 7
said 7
the 7
brightest 7
and 7
quickest 7
of 7
them 7
all 7
i 7
will 7
be 7
the 7
cadi 7
bring 7
before 7
me 7
ali 7
cogia 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
robbed 7
him 7
of 7
the 7
thousand 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
the 7
boys 7
words 7
recalled 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
the 7
petition 7
he 7
had 7
read 7
that 7
morning 7
and 7
he 7
waited 7
with 7
interest 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
the 7
children 7
would 7
do 7
the 7
proposal 7
was 7
hailed 7
with 7
joy 7
by 7
the 7
other 7
children 7
who 7
had 7
heard 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
talk 7
about 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
they 7
quickly 7
settled 7
the 7
part 7
each 7
one 7
was 7
to 7
play 7
the 7
cadi 7
took 7
his 7
seat 7
gravely 7
and 7
an 7
officer 7
introduced 7
first 7
ali 7
cogia 7
the 7
plaintiff 7
and 7
then 7
the 7
merchant 7
who 7
was 7
the 7
defendant 7
ali 7
cogia 7
made 7
a 7
low 7
bow 7
and 7
pleaded 7
his 7
cause 7
point 7
by 7
point 7
concluding 7
by 7
imploring 7
the 7
cadi 7
not 7
to 7
inflict 7
on 7
him 7
such 7
a 7
heavy 7
loss 7
the 7
cadi 7
having 7
heard 7
his 7
case 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
merchant 7
and 7
inquired 7
why 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
repaid 7
ali 7
cogia 7
the 7
sum 7
in 7
question 7
the 7
false 7
merchant 7
repeated 7
the 7
reasons 7
that 7
the 7
real 7
merchant 7
had 7
given 7
to 7
the 7
cadi 7
of 7
bagdad 7
and 7
also 7
offered 7
to 7
swear 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
told 7
the 7
truth 7
stop 7
a 7
moment 7
said 7
the 7
little 7
cadi 7
before 7
we 7
come 7
to 7
oaths 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
vase 7
with 7
the 7
olives 7
ali 7
cogia 7
he 7
added 7
have 7
you 7
got 7
the 7
vase 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
finding 7
he 7
had 7
not 7
the 7
cadi 7
continued 7
go 7
and 7
get 7
it 7
and 7
bring 7
it 7
to 7
me 7
so 7
ali 7
cogia 7
disappeared 7
for 7
an 7
instant 7
and 7
then 7
pretended 7
to 7
lay 7
a 7
vase 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
the 7
cadi 7
declaring 7
it 7
was 7
his 7
vase 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
given 7
to 7
the 7
accused 7
for 7
safe 7
custody 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
be 7
quite 7
correct 7
the 7
cadi 7
asked 7
the 7
merchant 7
if 7
he 7
recognised 7
it 7
as 7
the 7
same 7
vase 7
by 7
his 7
silence 7
the 7
merchant 7
admitted 7
the 7
fact 7
and 7
the 7
cadi 7
then 7
commanded 7
to 7
have 7
the 7
vase 7
opened 7
ali 7
cogia 7
made 7
a 7
movement 7
as 7
if 7
he 7
was 7
taking 7
off 7
the 7
lid 7
and 7
the 7
little 7
cadi 7
on 7
his 7
part 7
made 7
a 7
pretence 7
of 7
peering 7
into 7
a 7
vase 7
what 7
beautiful 7
olives 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
to 7
taste 7
one 7
and 7
pretending 7
to 7
put 7
one 7
in 7
his 7
mouth 7
he 7
added 7
they 7
are 7
really 7
excellent 7
but 7
he 7
went 7
on 7
it 7
seems 7
to 7
me 7
odd 7
that 7
olives 7
seven 7
years 7
old 7
should 7
be 7
as 7
good 7
as 7
that 7
send 7
for 7
some 7
dealers 7
in 7
olives 7
and 7
let 7
us 7
hear 7
what 7
they 7
say 7
two 7
children 7
were 7
presented 7
to 7
him 7
as 7
olive 7
merchants 7
and 7
the 7
cadi 7
addressed 7
them 7
tell 7
me 7
he 7
said 7
how 7
long 7
can 7
olives 7
be 7
kept 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
be 7
pleasant 7
eating 7
my 7
lord 7
replied 7
the 7
merchants 7
however 7
much 7
care 7
is 7
taken 7
to 7
preserve 7
them 7
they 7
never 7
last 7
beyond 7
the 7
third 7
year 7
they 7
lose 7
both 7
taste 7
and 7
colour 7
and 7
are 7
only 7
fit 7
to 7
be 7
thrown 7
away 7
if 7
that 7
is 7
so 7
answered 7
the 7
little 7
cadi 7
examine 7
this 7
vase 7
and 7
tell 7
me 7
how 7
long 7
the 7
olives 7
have 7
been 7
in 7
it 7
the 7
olive 7
merchants 7
pretended 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
olives 7
and 7
taste 7
them 7
then 7
reported 7
to 7
the 7
cadi 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
fresh 7
and 7
good 7
you 7
are 7
mistaken 7
said 7
he 7
ali 7
cogia 7
declares 7
he 7
put 7
them 7
in 7
that 7
vase 7
seven 7
years 7
ago 7
my 7
lord 7
returned 7
the 7
olive 7
merchants 7
we 7
can 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
the 7
olives 7
are 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
present 7
year 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
consult 7
all 7
the 7
merchants 7
in 7
bagdad 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
find 7
one 7
to 7
give 7
a 7
contrary 7
opinion 7
the 7
accused 7
merchant 7
opened 7
his 7
mouth 7
as 7
if 7
to 7
protest 7
but 7
the 7
cadi 7
gave 7
him 7
no 7
time 7
be 7
silent 7
he 7
said 7
you 7
are 7
a 7
thief 7
take 7
him 7
away 7
and 7
hang 7
him 7
so 7
the 7
game 7
ended 7
the 7
children 7
clapping 7
their 7
hands 7
in 7
applause 7
and 7
leading 7
the 7
criminal 7
away 7
to 7
be 7
hanged 7
harounalraschid 7
was 7
lost 7
in 7
astonishment 7
at 7
the 7
wisdom 7
of 7
the 7
child 7
who 7
had 7
given 7
so 7
wise 7
a 7
verdict 7
on 7
the 7
case 7
which 7
he 7
himself 7
was 7
to 7
hear 7
on 7
the 7
morrow 7
is 7
there 7
any 7
other 7
verdict 7
possible 7
he 7
asked 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
who 7
was 7
as 7
much 7
impressed 7
as 7
himself 7
i 7
can 7
imagine 7
no 7
better 7
judgment 7
if 7
the 7
circumstances 7
are 7
really 7
such 7
as 7
we 7
have 7
heard 7
replied 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
it 7
seems 7
to 7
me 7
your 7
highness 7
could 7
only 7
follow 7
the 7
example 7
of 7
this 7
boy 7
in 7
the 7
method 7
of 7
reasoning 7
and 7
also 7
in 7
your 7
conclusions 7
then 7
take 7
careful 7
note 7
of 7
this 7
house 7
said 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
the 7
boy 7
tomorrow 7
so 7
that 7
the 7
affair 7
may 7
be 7
tried 7
by 7
him 7
in 7
my 7
presence 7
summon 7
also 7
the 7
cadi 7
to 7
learn 7
his 7
duty 7
from 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
a 7
child 7
bid 7
ali 7
cogia 7
bring 7
his 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
and 7
see 7
that 7
two 7
dealers 7
in 7
olives 7
are 7
present 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
caliph 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
early 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
went 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
where 7
they 7
had 7
seen 7
the 7
children 7
playing 7
and 7
asked 7
for 7
the 7
mistress 7
and 7
her 7
children 7
three 7
boys 7
appeared 7
and 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
inquired 7
which 7
had 7
represented 7
the 7
cadi 7
in 7
their 7
game 7
of 7
the 7
previous 7
evening 7
the 7
eldest 7
and 7
tallest 7
changing 7
colour 7
confessed 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
he 7
and 7
to 7
his 7
mothers 7
great 7
alarm 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
said 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
strict 7
orders 7
to 7
bring 7
him 7
into 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
caliph 7
does 7
he 7
want 7
to 7
take 7
my 7
son 7
from 7
me 7
cried 7
the 7
poor 7
woman 7
but 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
hastened 7
to 7
calm 7
her 7
by 7
assuring 7
her 7
that 7
she 7
should 7
have 7
the 7
boy 7
again 7
in 7
an 7
hour 7
and 7
she 7
would 7
be 7
quite 7
satisfied 7
when 7
she 7
knew 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
the 7
summons 7
so 7
she 7
dressed 7
the 7
boy 7
in 7
his 7
best 7
clothes 7
and 7
the 7
two 7
left 7
the 7
house 7
when 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
presented 7
the 7
child 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
he 7
was 7
a 7
little 7
awed 7
and 7
confused 7
and 7
the 7
caliph 7
proceeded 7
to 7
explain 7
why 7
he 7
had 7
sent 7
for 7
him 7
approach 7
my 7
son 7
he 7
said 7
kindly 7
i 7
think 7
it 7
was 7
you 7
who 7
judged 7
the 7
case 7
of 7
ali 7
cogia 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
last 7
night 7
i 7
overheard 7
you 7
by 7
chance 7
and 7
was 7
very 7
pleased 7
with 7
the 7
way 7
you 7
conducted 7
it 7
today 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
the 7
real 7
ali 7
cogia 7
and 7
the 7
real 7
merchant 7
seat 7
yourself 7
at 7
once 7
next 7
to 7
me 7
the 7
caliph 7
being 7
seated 7
on 7
his 7
throne 7
with 7
the 7
boy 7
next 7
him 7
the 7
parties 7
to 7
the 7
suit 7
were 7
ushered 7
in 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
they 7
prostrated 7
themselves 7
and 7
touched 7
the 7
carpet 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
throne 7
with 7
their 7
foreheads 7
when 7
they 7
rose 7
up 7
the 7
caliph 7
said 7
now 7
speak 7
this 7
child 7
will 7
give 7
you 7
justice 7
and 7
if 7
more 7
should 7
be 7
wanted 7
i 7
will 7
see 7
to 7
it 7
myself 7
ali 7
cogia 7
and 7
the 7
merchant 7
pleaded 7
one 7
after 7
the 7
other 7
but 7
when 7
the 7
merchant 7
offered 7
to 7
swear 7
the 7
same 7
oath 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
taken 7
before 7
the 7
cadi 7
he 7
was 7
stopped 7
by 7
the 7
child 7
who 7
said 7
that 7
before 7
this 7
was 7
done 7
he 7
must 7
first 7
see 7
the 7
vase 7
of 7
olives 7
at 7
these 7
words 7
ali 7
cogia 7
presented 7
the 7
vase 7
to 7
the 7
caliph 7
and 7
uncovered 7
it 7
the 7
caliph 7
took 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
olives 7
tasted 7
it 7
and 7
ordered 7
the 7
expert 7
merchants 7
to 7
do 7
the 7
same 7
they 7
pronounced 7
the 7
olives 7
good 7
and 7
fresh 7
that 7
year 7
the 7
boy 7
informed 7
them 7
that 7
ali 7
cogia 7
declared 7
it 7
was 7
seven 7
years 7
since 7
he 7
had 7
placed 7
them 7
in 7
the 7
vase 7
to 7
which 7
they 7
returned 7
the 7
same 7
answer 7
as 7
the 7
children 7
had 7
done 7
the 7
accused 7
merchant 7
saw 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
that 7
his 7
condemnation 7
was 7
certain 7
and 7
tried 7
to 7
allege 7
something 7
in 7
his 7
defence 7
the 7
boy 7
had 7
too 7
much 7
sense 7
to 7
order 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
hanged 7
and 7
looked 7
at 7
the 7
caliph 7
saying 7
commander 7
of 7
the 7
faithful 7
this 7
is 7
not 7
a 7
game 7
now 7
it 7
is 7
for 7
your 7
highness 7
to 7
condemn 7
him 7
to 7
death 7
and 7
not 7
for 7
me 7
then 7
the 7
caliph 7
convinced 7
that 7
the 7
man 7
was 7
a 7
thief 7
bade 7
them 7
take 7
him 7
away 7
and 7
hang 7
him 7
which 7
was 7
done 7
but 7
not 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
confessed 7
his 7
guilt 7
and 7
the 7
place 7
in 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
hidden 7
ali 7
cogias 7
money 7
the 7
caliph 7
ordered 7
the 7
cadi 7
to 7
learn 7
how 7
to 7
deal 7
out 7
justice 7
from 7
the 7
mouth 7
of 7
a 7
child 7
and 7
sent 7
the 7
boy 7
home 7
with 7
a 7
purse 7
containing 7
a 7
hundred 7
pieces 7
of 7
gold 7
as 7
a 7
mark 7
of 7
his 7
favour 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
feast 7
of 7
the 7
new 7
year 7
the 7
oldest 7
and 7
most 7
splendid 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
feasts 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
persia 7
and 7
the 7
day 7
had 7
been 7
spent 7
by 7
the 7
king 7
in 7
the 7
city 7
of 7
schiraz 7
taking 7
part 7
in 7
the 7
magnificent 7
spectacles 7
prepared 7
by 7
his 7
subjects 7
to 7
do 7
honour 7
to 7
the 7
festival 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
setting 7
and 7
the 7
monarch 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
give 7
his 7
court 7
the 7
signal 7
to 7
retire 7
when 7
suddenly 7
an 7
indian 7
appeared 7
before 7
his 7
throne 7
leading 7
a 7
horse 7
richly 7
harnessed 7
and 7
looking 7
in 7
every 7
respect 7
exactly 7
like 7
a 7
real 7
one 7
sire 7
said 7
he 7
prostrating 7
himself 7
as 7
he 7
spoke 7
although 7
i 7
make 7
my 7
appearance 7
so 7
late 7
before 7
your 7
highness 7
i 7
can 7
confidently 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
none 7
of 7
the 7
wonders 7
you 7
have 7
seen 7
during 7
the 7
day 7
can 7
be 7
compared 7
to 7
this 7
horse 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
deign 7
to 7
cast 7
your 7
eyes 7
upon 7
him 7
i 7
see 7
nothing 7
in 7
it 7
replied 7
the 7
king 7
except 7
a 7
clever 7
imitation 7
of 7
a 7
real 7
one 7
and 7
any 7
skilled 7
workman 7
might 7
do 7
as 7
much 7
sire 7
returned 7
the 7
indian 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
of 7
his 7
outward 7
form 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
speak 7
but 7
of 7
the 7
use 7
that 7
i 7
can 7
make 7
of 7
him 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
mount 7
him 7
and 7
to 7
wish 7
myself 7
in 7
some 7
special 7
place 7
and 7
no 7
matter 7
how 7
distant 7
it 7
may 7
be 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
few 7
moments 7
i 7
shall 7
find 7
myself 7
there 7
it 7
is 7
this 7
sire 7
that 7
makes 7
the 7
horse 7
so 7
marvellous 7
and 7
if 7
your 7
highness 7
will 7
allow 7
me 7
you 7
can 7
prove 7
it 7
for 7
yourself 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
persia 7
who 7
was 7
interested 7
in 7
every 7
thing 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
common 7
and 7
had 7
never 7
before 7
come 7
across 7
a 7
horse 7
with 7
such 7
qualities 7
bade 7
the 7
indian 7
mount 7
the 7
animal 7
and 7
show 7
what 7
he 7
could 7
do 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
the 7
man 7
had 7
vaulted 7
on 7
his 7
back 7
and 7
inquired 7
where 7
the 7
monarch 7
wished 7
to 7
send 7
him 7
do 7
you 7
see 7
that 7
mountain 7
asked 7
the 7
king 7
pointing 7
to 7
a 7
huge 7
mass 7
that 7
towered 7
into 7
the 7
sky 7
about 7
three 7
leagues 7
from 7
schiraz 7
go 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
the 7
leaf 7
of 7
a 7
palm 7
that 7
grows 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
the 7
words 7
were 7
hardly 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
kings 7
mouth 7
when 7
the 7
indian 7
turned 7
a 7
screw 7
placed 7
in 7
the 7
horses 7
neck 7
close 7
to 7
the 7
saddle 7
and 7
the 7
animal 7
bounded 7
like 7
lightning 7
up 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
beyond 7
the 7
sight 7
even 7
of 7
the 7
sharpest 7
eyes 7
in 7
a 7
quarter 7
of 7
an 7
hour 7
the 7
indian 7
was 7
seen 7
returning 7
bearing 7
in 7
his 7
hand 7
the 7
palm 7
and 7
guiding 7
his 7
horse 7
to 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
throne 7
he 7
dismounted 7
and 7
laid 7
the 7
leaf 7
before 7
the 7
king 7
now 7
the 7
monarch 7
had 7
no 7
sooner 7
proved 7
the 7
astonishing 7
speed 7
of 7
which 7
the 7
horse 7
was 7
capable 7
than 7
he 7
longed 7
to 7
possess 7
it 7
himself 7
and 7
indeed 7
so 7
sure 7
was 7
he 7
that 7
the 7
indian 7
would 7
be 7
quite 7
ready 7
to 7
sell 7
it 7
that 7
he 7
looked 7
upon 7
it 7
as 7
his 7
own 7
already 7
i 7
never 7
guessed 7
from 7
his 7
mere 7
outside 7
how 7
valuable 7
an 7
animal 7
he 7
was 7
he 7
remarked 7
to 7
the 7
indian 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
grateful 7
to 7
you 7
for 7
having 7
shown 7
me 7
my 7
error 7
said 7
he 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
sell 7
it 7
name 7
your 7
own 7
price 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
indian 7
i 7
never 7
doubted 7
that 7
a 7
sovereign 7
so 7
wise 7
and 7
accomplished 7
as 7
your 7
highness 7
would 7
do 7
justice 7
to 7
my 7
horse 7
when 7
he 7
once 7
knew 7
its 7
power 7
and 7
i 7
even 7
went 7
so 7
far 7
as 7
to 7
think 7
it 7
probable 7
that 7
you 7
might 7
wish 7
to 7
possess 7
it 7
greatly 7
as 7
i 7
prize 7
it 7
i 7
will 7
yield 7
it 7
up 7
to 7
your 7
highness 7
on 7
one 7
condition 7
the 7
horse 7
was 7
not 7
constructed 7
by 7
me 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
given 7
me 7
by 7
the 7
inventor 7
in 7
exchange 7
for 7
my 7
only 7
daughter 7
who 7
made 7
me 7
take 7
a 7
solemn 7
oath 7
that 7
i 7
would 7
never 7
part 7
with 7
it 7
except 7
for 7
some 7
object 7
of 7
equal 7
value 7
name 7
anything 7
you 7
like 7
cried 7
the 7
monarch 7
interrupting 7
him 7
my 7
kingdom 7
is 7
large 7
and 7
filled 7
with 7
fair 7
cities 7
you 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
choose 7
which 7
you 7
would 7
prefer 7
to 7
become 7
its 7
ruler 7
to 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
your 7
life 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
indian 7
to 7
whom 7
the 7
proposal 7
did 7
not 7
seem 7
nearly 7
so 7
generous 7
as 7
it 7
appeared 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
i 7
am 7
most 7
grateful 7
to 7
your 7
highness 7
for 7
your 7
princely 7
offer 7
and 7
beseech 7
you 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
offended 7
with 7
me 7
if 7
i 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
can 7
only 7
deliver 7
up 7
my 7
horse 7
in 7
exchange 7
for 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
your 7
daughter 7
a 7
shout 7
of 7
laughter 7
burst 7
from 7
the 7
courtiers 7
as 7
they 7
heard 7
these 7
words 7
and 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
the 7
heir 7
apparent 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
anger 7
at 7
the 7
indians 7
presumption 7
the 7
king 7
however 7
thought 7
that 7
it 7
would 7
not 7
cost 7
him 7
much 7
to 7
part 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
gain 7
such 7
a 7
delightful 7
toy 7
and 7
while 7
he 7
was 7
hesitating 7
as 7
to 7
his 7
answer 7
the 7
prince 7
broke 7
in 7
sire 7
he 7
said 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
possible 7
that 7
you 7
can 7
doubt 7
for 7
an 7
instant 7
what 7
reply 7
you 7
should 7
give 7
to 7
such 7
an 7
insolent 7
bargain 7
consider 7
what 7
you 7
owe 7
to 7
yourself 7
and 7
to 7
the 7
blood 7
of 7
your 7
ancestors 7
my 7
son 7
replied 7
the 7
king 7
you 7
speak 7
nobly 7
but 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
realise 7
either 7
the 7
value 7
of 7
the 7
horse 7
or 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
if 7
i 7
reject 7
the 7
proposal 7
of 7
the 7
indian 7
he 7
will 7
only 7
make 7
the 7
same 7
to 7
some 7
other 7
monarch 7
and 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
filled 7
with 7
despair 7
at 7
the 7
thought 7
that 7
anyone 7
but 7
myself 7
should 7
own 7
this 7
seventh 7
wonder 7
of 7
the 7
world 7
of 7
course 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
say 7
that 7
i 7
shall 7
accept 7
his 7
conditions 7
and 7
perhaps 7
he 7
may 7
be 7
brought 7
to 7
reason 7
but 7
meanwhile 7
i 7
should 7
like 7
you 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
owners 7
permission 7
to 7
make 7
trial 7
of 7
its 7
powers 7
the 7
indian 7
who 7
had 7
overheard 7
the 7
kings 7
speech 7
thought 7
that 7
he 7
saw 7
in 7
it 7
signs 7
of 7
yielding 7
to 7
his 7
proposal 7
so 7
he 7
joyfully 7
agreed 7
to 7
the 7
monarchs 7
wishes 7
and 7
came 7
forward 7
to 7
help 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
mount 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
show 7
him 7
how 7
to 7
guide 7
it 7
but 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
turned 7
the 7
screw 7
and 7
was 7
soon 7
out 7
of 7
sight 7
they 7
waited 7
some 7
time 7
expecting 7
that 7
every 7
moment 7
he 7
might 7
be 7
seen 7
returning 7
in 7
the 7
distance 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
indian 7
grew 7
frightened 7
and 7
prostrating 7
himself 7
before 7
the 7
throne 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
sire 7
your 7
highness 7
must 7
have 7
noticed 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
in 7
his 7
impatience 7
did 7
not 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
tell 7
him 7
what 7
it 7
was 7
necessary 7
to 7
do 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
from 7
which 7
he 7
started 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
not 7
to 7
punish 7
me 7
for 7
what 7
was 7
not 7
my 7
fault 7
and 7
not 7
to 7
visit 7
on 7
me 7
any 7
misfortune 7
that 7
may 7
occur 7
but 7
why 7
cried 7
the 7
king 7
in 7
a 7
burst 7
of 7
fear 7
and 7
anger 7
why 7
did 7
you 7
not 7
call 7
him 7
back 7
when 7
you 7
saw 7
him 7
disappearing 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
indian 7
the 7
rapidity 7
of 7
his 7
movements 7
took 7
me 7
so 7
by 7
surprise 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
out 7
of 7
hearing 7
before 7
i 7
recovered 7
my 7
speech 7
but 7
we 7
must 7
hope 7
that 7
he 7
will 7
perceive 7
and 7
turn 7
a 7
second 7
screw 7
which 7
will 7
have 7
the 7
effect 7
of 7
bringing 7
the 7
horse 7
back 7
to 7
earth 7
but 7
supposing 7
he 7
does 7
answered 7
the 7
king 7
what 7
is 7
to 7
hinder 7
the 7
horse 7
from 7
descending 7
straight 7
into 7
the 7
sea 7
or 7
dashing 7
him 7
to 7
pieces 7
on 7
the 7
rocks 7
have 7
no 7
fears 7
your 7
highness 7
said 7
the 7
indian 7
the 7
horse 7
has 7
the 7
gift 7
of 7
passing 7
over 7
seas 7
and 7
of 7
carrying 7
his 7
rider 7
wherever 7
he 7
wishes 7
to 7
go 7
well 7
your 7
head 7
shall 7
answer 7
for 7
it 7
returned 7
the 7
monarch 7
and 7
if 7
in 7
three 7
months 7
he 7
is 7
not 7
safe 7
back 7
with 7
me 7
or 7
at 7
any 7
rate 7
does 7
not 7
send 7
me 7
news 7
of 7
his 7
safety 7
your 7
life 7
shall 7
pay 7
the 7
penalty 7
so 7
saying 7
he 7
ordered 7
his 7
guards 7
to 7
seize 7
the 7
indian 7
and 7
throw 7
him 7
into 7
prison 7
meanwhile 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
had 7
gone 7
gaily 7
up 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
and 7
for 7
the 7
space 7
of 7
an 7
hour 7
continued 7
to 7
ascend 7
higher 7
and 7
higher 7
till 7
the 7
very 7
mountains 7
were 7
not 7
distinguishable 7
from 7
the 7
plains 7
then 7
he 7
began 7
to 7
think 7
it 7
was 7
time 7
to 7
come 7
down 7
and 7
took 7
for 7
granted 7
that 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
do 7
this 7
it 7
was 7
only 7
needful 7
to 7
turn 7
the 7
screw 7
the 7
reverse 7
way 7
but 7
to 7
his 7
surprise 7
and 7
horror 7
he 7
found 7
that 7
turn 7
as 7
he 7
might 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
make 7
the 7
smallest 7
impression 7
he 7
then 7
remembered 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
never 7
waited 7
to 7
ask 7
how 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
get 7
back 7
to 7
earth 7
again 7
and 7
understood 7
the 7
danger 7
in 7
which 7
he 7
stood 7
luckily 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
lose 7
his 7
head 7
and 7
set 7
about 7
examining 7
the 7
horses 7
neck 7
with 7
great 7
care 7
till 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
his 7
intense 7
joy 7
he 7
discovered 7
a 7
tiny 7
little 7
peg 7
much 7
smaller 7
than 7
the 7
other 7
close 7
to 7
the 7
right 7
ear 7
this 7
he 7
turned 7
and 7
found 7
himself 7
dropping 7
to 7
the 7
earth 7
though 7
more 7
slowly 7
than 7
he 7
had 7
left 7
it 7
it 7
was 7
now 7
dark 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
prince 7
could 7
see 7
nothing 7
he 7
was 7
obliged 7
not 7
without 7
some 7
feeling 7
of 7
disquiet 7
to 7
allow 7
the 7
horse 7
to 7
direct 7
his 7
own 7
course 7
and 7
midnight 7
was 7
already 7
passed 7
before 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
again 7
touched 7
the 7
ground 7
faint 7
and 7
weary 7
from 7
his 7
long 7
ride 7
and 7
from 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
eaten 7
nothing 7
since 7
early 7
morning 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
he 7
did 7
on 7
dismounting 7
was 7
to 7
try 7
to 7
find 7
out 7
where 7
he 7
was 7
and 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
discover 7
in 7
the 7
thick 7
darkness 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
on 7
the 7
terraced 7
roof 7
of 7
a 7
huge 7
palace 7
with 7
a 7
balustrade 7
of 7
marble 7
running 7
round 7
in 7
one 7
corner 7
of 7
the 7
terrace 7
stood 7
a 7
small 7
door 7
opening 7
on 7
to 7
a 7
staircase 7
which 7
led 7
down 7
into 7
the 7
palace 7
some 7
people 7
might 7
have 7
hesitated 7
before 7
exploring 7
further 7
but 7
not 7
so 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
am 7
doing 7
no 7
harm 7
he 7
said 7
and 7
whoever 7
the 7
owner 7
may 7
be 7
he 7
will 7
not 7
touch 7
me 7
when 7
he 7
sees 7
i 7
am 7
unarmed 7
and 7
in 7
dread 7
of 7
making 7
a 7
false 7
step 7
he 7
went 7
cautiously 7
down 7
the 7
staircase 7
on 7
a 7
landing 7
he 7
noticed 7
an 7
open 7
door 7
beyond 7
which 7
was 7
a 7
faintly 7
lighted 7
hall 7
before 7
entering 7
the 7
prince 7
paused 7
and 7
listened 7
but 7
he 7
heard 7
nothing 7
except 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
men 7
snoring 7
by 7
the 7
light 7
of 7
a 7
lantern 7
suspended 7
from 7
the 7
roof 7
he 7
perceived 7
a 7
row 7
of 7
black 7
guards 7
sleeping 7
each 7
with 7
a 7
naked 7
sword 7
lying 7
by 7
him 7
and 7
he 7
understood 7
that 7
the 7
hall 7
must 7
form 7
the 7
anteroom 7
to 7
the 7
chamber 7
of 7
some 7
queen 7
or 7
princess 7
standing 7
quite 7
still 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
looked 7
about 7
him 7
till 7
his 7
eyes 7
grew 7
accustomed 7
to 7
the 7
gloom 7
and 7
he 7
noticed 7
a 7
bright 7
light 7
shining 7
through 7
a 7
curtain 7
in 7
one 7
corner 7
he 7
then 7
made 7
his 7
way 7
softly 7
towards 7
it 7
and 7
drawing 7
aside 7
its 7
folds 7
passed 7
into 7
a 7
magnificent 7
chamber 7
full 7
of 7
sleeping 7
women 7
all 7
lying 7
on 7
low 7
couches 7
except 7
one 7
who 7
was 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
and 7
this 7
one 7
he 7
knew 7
must 7
be 7
the 7
princess 7
gently 7
stealing 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
her 7
bed 7
he 7
looked 7
at 7
her 7
and 7
saw 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
more 7
beautiful 7
than 7
any 7
woman 7
he 7
had 7
ever 7
beheld 7
but 7
fascinated 7
though 7
he 7
was 7
he 7
was 7
well 7
aware 7
of 7
the 7
danger 7
of 7
his 7
position 7
as 7
one 7
cry 7
of 7
surprise 7
would 7
awake 7
the 7
guards 7
and 7
cause 7
his 7
certain 7
death 7
so 7
sinking 7
quietly 7
on 7
his 7
knees 7
he 7
took 7
hold 7
of 7
the 7
sleeve 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
drew 7
her 7
arm 7
lightly 7
towards 7
him 7
the 7
princess 7
opened 7
her 7
eyes 7
and 7
seeing 7
before 7
her 7
a 7
handsome 7
welldressed 7
man 7
she 7
remained 7
speechless 7
with 7
astonishment 7
this 7
favourable 7
moment 7
was 7
seized 7
by 7
the 7
prince 7
who 7
bowing 7
low 7
while 7
he 7
knelt 7
thus 7
addressed 7
her 7
you 7
behold 7
madame 7
a 7
prince 7
in 7
distress 7
son 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
persia 7
who 7
owing 7
to 7
an 7
adventure 7
so 7
strange 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
scarcely 7
believe 7
it 7
finds 7
himself 7
here 7
a 7
suppliant 7
for 7
your 7
protection 7
but 7
yesterday 7
i 7
was 7
in 7
my 7
fathers 7
court 7
engaged 7
in 7
the 7
celebration 7
of 7
our 7
most 7
solemn 7
festival 7
today 7
i 7
am 7
in 7
an 7
unknown 7
land 7
in 7
danger 7
of 7
my 7
life 7
now 7
the 7
princess 7
whose 7
mercy 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
implored 7
was 7
the 7
eldest 7
daughter 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
bengal 7
who 7
was 7
enjoying 7
rest 7
and 7
change 7
in 7
the 7
palace 7
her 7
father 7
had 7
built 7
her 7
at 7
a 7
little 7
distance 7
from 7
the 7
capital 7
she 7
listened 7
kindly 7
to 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
to 7
say 7
and 7
then 7
answered 7
prince 7
be 7
not 7
uneasy 7
hospitality 7
and 7
humanity 7
are 7
practised 7
as 7
widely 7
in 7
bengal 7
as 7
they 7
are 7
in 7
persia 7
the 7
protection 7
you 7
ask 7
will 7
be 7
given 7
you 7
by 7
all 7
you 7
have 7
my 7
word 7
for 7
it 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
thank 7
her 7
for 7
her 7
goodness 7
she 7
added 7
quickly 7
however 7
great 7
may 7
be 7
my 7
curiosity 7
to 7
learn 7
by 7
what 7
means 7
you 7
have 7
travelled 7
here 7
so 7
speedily 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
faint 7
for 7
want 7
of 7
food 7
so 7
i 7
shall 7
give 7
orders 7
to 7
my 7
women 7
to 7
take 7
you 7
to 7
one 7
of 7
my 7
chambers 7
where 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
provided 7
with 7
supper 7
and 7
left 7
to 7
repose 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
princesss 7
attendants 7
were 7
all 7
awake 7
and 7
listening 7
to 7
the 7
conversation 7
at 7
a 7
sign 7
from 7
their 7
mistress 7
they 7
rose 7
dressed 7
themselves 7
hastily 7
and 7
snatching 7
up 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
tapers 7
which 7
lighted 7
the 7
room 7
conducted 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
a 7
large 7
and 7
lofty 7
room 7
where 7
two 7
of 7
the 7
number 7
prepared 7
his 7
bed 7
and 7
the 7
rest 7
went 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
kitchen 7
from 7
which 7
they 7
soon 7
returned 7
with 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
dishes 7
then 7
showing 7
him 7
cupboards 7
filled 7
with 7
dresses 7
and 7
linen 7
they 7
quitted 7
the 7
room 7
during 7
their 7
absence 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
greatly 7
struck 7
by 7
the 7
beauty 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
tried 7
in 7
vain 7
to 7
go 7
to 7
sleep 7
again 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
she 7
felt 7
broad 7
awake 7
and 7
when 7
her 7
women 7
entered 7
the 7
room 7
she 7
inquired 7
eagerly 7
if 7
the 7
prince 7
had 7
all 7
he 7
wanted 7
and 7
what 7
they 7
thought 7
of 7
him 7
madame 7
they 7
replied 7
it 7
is 7
of 7
course 7
impossible 7
for 7
us 7
to 7
tell 7
what 7
impression 7
this 7
young 7
man 7
has 7
made 7
on 7
you 7
for 7
ourselves 7
we 7
think 7
you 7
would 7
be 7
fortunate 7
if 7
the 7
king 7
your 7
father 7
should 7
allow 7
you 7
to 7
marry 7
anyone 7
so 7
amiable 7
certainly 7
there 7
is 7
no 7
one 7
in 7
the 7
court 7
of 7
bengal 7
who 7
can 7
be 7
compared 7
with 7
him 7
these 7
flattering 7
observations 7
were 7
by 7
no 7
means 7
displeasing 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
but 7
as 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
betray 7
her 7
own 7
feelings 7
she 7
merely 7
said 7
you 7
are 7
all 7
a 7
set 7
of 7
chatterboxes 7
go 7
back 7
to 7
bed 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
sleep 7
when 7
she 7
dressed 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
her 7
maids 7
noticed 7
that 7
contrary 7
to 7
her 7
usual 7
habit 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
very 7
particular 7
about 7
her 7
toilette 7
and 7
insisted 7
on 7
her 7
hair 7
being 7
dressed 7
two 7
or 7
three 7
times 7
over 7
for 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
herself 7
if 7
my 7
appearance 7
was 7
not 7
displeasing 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
me 7
in 7
the 7
condition 7
i 7
was 7
how 7
much 7
more 7
will 7
he 7
be 7
struck 7
with 7
me 7
when 7
he 7
beholds 7
me 7
with 7
all 7
my 7
charms 7
then 7
she 7
placed 7
in 7
her 7
hair 7
the 7
largest 7
and 7
most 7
brilliant 7
diamonds 7
she 7
could 7
find 7
with 7
a 7
necklace 7
bracelets 7
and 7
girdle 7
all 7
of 7
precious 7
stones 7
and 7
over 7
her 7
shoulders 7
her 7
ladies 7
put 7
a 7
robe 7
of 7
the 7
richest 7
stuff 7
in 7
all 7
the 7
indies 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
was 7
allowed 7
to 7
wear 7
except 7
members 7
of 7
the 7
royal 7
family 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
fully 7
dressed 7
according 7
to 7
her 7
wishes 7
she 7
sent 7
to 7
know 7
if 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
was 7
awake 7
and 7
ready 7
to 7
receive 7
her 7
as 7
she 7
desired 7
to 7
present 7
herself 7
before 7
him 7
when 7
the 7
princesss 7
messenger 7
entered 7
his 7
room 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
was 7
in 7
the 7
act 7
of 7
leaving 7
it 7
to 7
inquire 7
if 7
he 7
might 7
be 7
allowed 7
to 7
pay 7
his 7
homage 7
to 7
her 7
mistress 7
but 7
on 7
hearing 7
the 7
princesss 7
wishes 7
he 7
at 7
once 7
gave 7
way 7
her 7
will 7
is 7
my 7
law 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
am 7
only 7
here 7
to 7
obey 7
her 7
orders 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
the 7
princess 7
herself 7
appeared 7
and 7
after 7
the 7
usual 7
compliments 7
had 7
passed 7
between 7
them 7
the 7
princess 7
sat 7
down 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
explain 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
her 7
reasons 7
for 7
not 7
giving 7
him 7
an 7
audience 7
in 7
her 7
own 7
apartments 7
had 7
i 7
done 7
so 7
she 7
said 7
we 7
might 7
have 7
been 7
interrupted 7
at 7
any 7
hour 7
by 7
the 7
chief 7
of 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
who 7
has 7
the 7
right 7
to 7
enter 7
whenever 7
it 7
pleases 7
him 7
whereas 7
this 7
is 7
forbidden 7
ground 7
i 7
am 7
all 7
impatience 7
to 7
learn 7
the 7
wonderful 7
accident 7
which 7
has 7
procured 7
the 7
pleasure 7
of 7
your 7
arrival 7
and 7
that 7
is 7
why 7
i 7
have 7
come 7
to 7
you 7
here 7
where 7
no 7
one 7
can 7
intrude 7
upon 7
us 7
begin 7
then 7
i 7
entreat 7
you 7
without 7
delay 7
so 7
the 7
prince 7
began 7
at 7
the 7
beginning 7
and 7
told 7
all 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
the 7
festival 7
of 7
nedrouz 7
held 7
yearly 7
in 7
persia 7
and 7
of 7
the 7
splendid 7
spectacles 7
celebrated 7
in 7
its 7
honour 7
but 7
when 7
he 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
the 7
princess 7
declared 7
that 7
she 7
could 7
never 7
have 7
imagined 7
anything 7
half 7
so 7
surprising 7
well 7
then 7
continued 7
the 7
prince 7
you 7
can 7
easily 7
understand 7
how 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
who 7
has 7
a 7
passion 7
for 7
all 7
curious 7
things 7
was 7
seized 7
with 7
a 7
violent 7
desire 7
to 7
possess 7
this 7
horse 7
and 7
asked 7
the 7
indian 7
what 7
sum 7
he 7
would 7
take 7
for 7
it 7
the 7
mans 7
answer 7
was 7
absolutely 7
absurd 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
agree 7
when 7
i 7
tell 7
you 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
nothing 7
less 7
than 7
the 7
hand 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
my 7
sister 7
but 7
though 7
all 7
the 7
bystanders 7
laughed 7
and 7
mocked 7
and 7
i 7
was 7
beside 7
myself 7
with 7
rage 7
i 7
saw 7
to 7
my 7
despair 7
that 7
my 7
father 7
could 7
not 7
make 7
up 7
his 7
mind 7
to 7
treat 7
the 7
insolent 7
proposal 7
as 7
it 7
deserved 7
i 7
tried 7
to 7
argue 7
with 7
him 7
but 7
in 7
vain 7
he 7
only 7
begged 7
me 7
to 7
examine 7
the 7
horse 7
with 7
a 7
view 7
as 7
i 7
quite 7
understood 7
of 7
making 7
me 7
more 7
sensible 7
of 7
its 7
value 7
to 7
please 7
my 7
father 7
i 7
mounted 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
without 7
waiting 7
for 7
any 7
instructions 7
from 7
the 7
indian 7
turned 7
the 7
peg 7
as 7
i 7
had 7
seen 7
him 7
do 7
in 7
an 7
instant 7
i 7
was 7
soaring 7
upwards 7
much 7
quicker 7
than 7
an 7
arrow 7
could 7
fly 7
and 7
i 7
felt 7
as 7
if 7
i 7
must 7
be 7
getting 7
so 7
near 7
the 7
sky 7
that 7
i 7
should 7
soon 7
hit 7
my 7
head 7
against 7
it 7
i 7
could 7
see 7
nothing 7
beneath 7
me 7
and 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
was 7
so 7
confused 7
that 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
even 7
know 7
in 7
what 7
direction 7
i 7
was 7
travelling 7
at 7
last 7
when 7
it 7
was 7
growing 7
dark 7
i 7
found 7
another 7
screw 7
and 7
on 7
turning 7
it 7
the 7
horse 7
began 7
slowly 7
to 7
sink 7
towards 7
the 7
earth 7
i 7
was 7
forced 7
to 7
trust 7
to 7
chance 7
and 7
to 7
see 7
what 7
fate 7
had 7
in 7
store 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
already 7
past 7
midnight 7
when 7
i 7
found 7
myself 7
on 7
the 7
roof 7
of 7
this 7
palace 7
i 7
crept 7
down 7
the 7
little 7
staircase 7
and 7
made 7
directly 7
for 7
a 7
light 7
which 7
i 7
perceived 7
through 7
an 7
open 7
doori 7
peeped 7
cautiously 7
in 7
and 7
saw 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
guess 7
the 7
eunuchs 7
lying 7
asleep 7
on 7
the 7
floor 7
i 7
knew 7
the 7
risks 7
i 7
ran 7
but 7
my 7
need 7
was 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
i 7
paid 7
no 7
attention 7
to 7
them 7
and 7
stole 7
safely 7
past 7
your 7
guards 7
to 7
the 7
curtain 7
which 7
concealed 7
your 7
doorway 7
the 7
rest 7
princess 7
you 7
know 7
and 7
it 7
only 7
remains 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
thank 7
you 7
for 7
the 7
kindness 7
you 7
have 7
shown 7
me 7
and 7
to 7
assure 7
you 7
of 7
my 7
gratitude 7
by 7
the 7
law 7
of 7
nations 7
i 7
am 7
already 7
your 7
slave 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
my 7
heart 7
that 7
is 7
my 7
own 7
to 7
offer 7
you 7
but 7
what 7
am 7
i 7
saying 7
my 7
own 7
alas 7
madame 7
it 7
was 7
yours 7
from 7
the 7
first 7
moment 7
i 7
beheld 7
you 7
the 7
air 7
with 7
which 7
he 7
said 7
these 7
words 7
could 7
have 7
left 7
no 7
doubt 7
on 7
the 7
mind 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
effect 7
of 7
her 7
charms 7
and 7
the 7
blush 7
which 7
mounted 7
to 7
her 7
face 7
only 7
increased 7
her 7
beauty 7
prince 7
returned 7
she 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
her 7
confusion 7
permitted 7
her 7
to 7
speak 7
you 7
have 7
given 7
me 7
the 7
greatest 7
pleasure 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
followed 7
you 7
closely 7
in 7
all 7
your 7
adventures 7
and 7
though 7
you 7
are 7
positively 7
sitting 7
before 7
me 7
i 7
even 7
trembled 7
at 7
your 7
danger 7
in 7
the 7
upper 7
regions 7
of 7
the 7
air 7
let 7
me 7
say 7
what 7
a 7
debt 7
i 7
owe 7
to 7
the 7
chance 7
that 7
has 7
led 7
you 7
to 7
my 7
house 7
you 7
could 7
have 7
entered 7
none 7
which 7
would 7
have 7
given 7
you 7
a 7
warmer 7
welcome 7
as 7
to 7
your 7
being 7
a 7
slave 7
of 7
course 7
that 7
is 7
merely 7
a 7
joke 7
and 7
my 7
reception 7
must 7
itself 7
have 7
assured 7
you 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
as 7
free 7
here 7
as 7
at 7
your 7
fathers 7
court 7
as 7
to 7
your 7
heart 7
continued 7
she 7
in 7
tones 7
of 7
encouragement 7
i 7
am 7
quite 7
sure 7
that 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
disposed 7
of 7
long 7
ago 7
to 7
some 7
princess 7
who 7
is 7
well 7
worthy 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
think 7
of 7
being 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
your 7
unfaithfulness 7
to 7
her 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
protest 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
lady 7
with 7
any 7
prior 7
claims 7
but 7
he 7
was 7
stopped 7
by 7
the 7
entrance 7
of 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
princesss 7
attendants 7
who 7
announced 7
that 7
dinner 7
was 7
served 7
and 7
after 7
all 7
neither 7
was 7
sorry 7
for 7
the 7
interruption 7
dinner 7
was 7
laid 7
in 7
a 7
magnificent 7
apartment 7
and 7
the 7
table 7
was 7
covered 7
with 7
delicious 7
fruits 7
while 7
during 7
the 7
repast 7
richly 7
dressed 7
girls 7
sang 7
softly 7
and 7
sweetly 7
to 7
stringed 7
instruments 7
after 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
princess 7
had 7
finished 7
they 7
passed 7
into 7
a 7
small 7
room 7
hung 7
with 7
blue 7
and 7
gold 7
looking 7
out 7
into 7
a 7
garden 7
stocked 7
with 7
flowers 7
and 7
arbutus 7
trees 7
quite 7
different 7
from 7
any 7
that 7
were 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
in 7
persia 7
princess 7
observed 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
till 7
now 7
i 7
had 7
always 7
believed 7
that 7
persia 7
could 7
boast 7
finer 7
palaces 7
and 7
more 7
lovely 7
gardens 7
than 7
any 7
kingdom 7
upon 7
earth 7
but 7
my 7
eyes 7
have 7
been 7
opened 7
and 7
i 7
begin 7
to 7
perceive 7
that 7
wherever 7
there 7
is 7
a 7
great 7
king 7
he 7
will 7
surround 7
himself 7
with 7
buildings 7
worthy 7
of 7
him 7
prince 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
i 7
have 7
no 7
idea 7
what 7
a 7
persian 7
palace 7
is 7
like 7
so 7
i 7
am 7
unable 7
to 7
make 7
comparisons 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
depreciate 7
my 7
own 7
palace 7
but 7
i 7
can 7
assure 7
you 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
very 7
poor 7
beside 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
as 7
you 7
will 7
agree 7
when 7
you 7
have 7
been 7
there 7
to 7
greet 7
him 7
as 7
i 7
hope 7
you 7
will 7
shortly 7
do 7
now 7
the 7
princess 7
hoped 7
that 7
by 7
bringing 7
about 7
a 7
meeting 7
between 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
her 7
father 7
the 7
king 7
would 7
be 7
so 7
struck 7
with 7
the 7
young 7
mans 7
distinguished 7
air 7
and 7
fine 7
manners 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
offer 7
him 7
his 7
daughter 7
to 7
wife 7
but 7
the 7
reply 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
to 7
her 7
suggestion 7
was 7
not 7
quite 7
what 7
she 7
wished 7
madame 7
he 7
said 7
by 7
taking 7
advantage 7
of 7
your 7
proposal 7
to 7
visit 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
bengal 7
i 7
should 7
satisfy 7
not 7
merely 7
my 7
curiosity 7
but 7
also 7
the 7
sentiments 7
of 7
respect 7
with 7
which 7
i 7
regard 7
him 7
but 7
princess 7
i 7
am 7
persuaded 7
that 7
you 7
will 7
feel 7
with 7
me 7
that 7
i 7
cannot 7
possibly 7
present 7
myself 7
before 7
so 7
great 7
a 7
sovereign 7
without 7
the 7
attendants 7
suitable 7
to 7
my 7
rank 7
he 7
would 7
think 7
me 7
an 7
adventurer 7
if 7
that 7
is 7
all 7
she 7
answered 7
you 7
can 7
get 7
as 7
many 7
attendants 7
here 7
as 7
you 7
please 7
there 7
are 7
plenty 7
of 7
persian 7
merchants 7
and 7
as 7
for 7
money 7
my 7
treasury 7
is 7
always 7
open 7
to 7
you 7
take 7
what 7
you 7
please 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
guessed 7
what 7
prompted 7
so 7
much 7
kindness 7
on 7
the 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
was 7
much 7
touched 7
by 7
it 7
still 7
his 7
passion 7
which 7
increased 7
every 7
moment 7
did 7
not 7
make 7
him 7
forget 7
his 7
duty 7
so 7
he 7
replied 7
without 7
hesitation 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
know 7
princess 7
how 7
to 7
express 7
my 7
gratitude 7
for 7
your 7
obliging 7
offer 7
which 7
i 7
would 7
accept 7
at 7
once 7
if 7
it 7
were 7
not 7
for 7
the 7
recollection 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
uneasiness 7
the 7
king 7
my 7
father 7
must 7
be 7
suffering 7
on 7
my 7
account 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
unworthy 7
indeed 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
love 7
he 7
showers 7
upon 7
me 7
if 7
i 7
did 7
not 7
return 7
to 7
him 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
possible 7
moment 7
for 7
while 7
i 7
am 7
enjoying 7
the 7
society 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
amiable 7
of 7
all 7
princesses 7
he 7
is 7
i 7
am 7
quite 7
convinced 7
plunged 7
in 7
the 7
deepest 7
grief 7
having 7
lost 7
all 7
hope 7
of 7
seeing 7
me 7
again 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
you 7
will 7
understand 7
my 7
position 7
and 7
will 7
feel 7
that 7
to 7
remain 7
away 7
one 7
instant 7
longer 7
than 7
is 7
necessary 7
would 7
not 7
only 7
be 7
ungrateful 7
on 7
my 7
part 7
but 7
perhaps 7
even 7
a 7
crime 7
for 7
how 7
do 7
i 7
know 7
if 7
my 7
absence 7
may 7
not 7
break 7
his 7
heart 7
but 7
continued 7
the 7
prince 7
having 7
obeyed 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
my 7
conscience 7
i 7
shall 7
count 7
the 7
moments 7
when 7
with 7
your 7
gracious 7
permission 7
i 7
may 7
present 7
myself 7
before 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
bengal 7
not 7
as 7
a 7
wanderer 7
but 7
as 7
a 7
prince 7
to 7
implore 7
the 7
favour 7
of 7
your 7
hand 7
my 7
father 7
has 7
always 7
informed 7
me 7
that 7
in 7
my 7
marriage 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
left 7
quite 7
free 7
but 7
i 7
am 7
persuaded 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
only 7
to 7
describe 7
your 7
generosity 7
for 7
my 7
wishes 7
to 7
become 7
his 7
own 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
was 7
too 7
reasonable 7
not 7
to 7
accept 7
the 7
explanation 7
offered 7
by 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
but 7
she 7
was 7
much 7
disturbed 7
at 7
his 7
intention 7
of 7
departing 7
at 7
once 7
for 7
she 7
feared 7
that 7
no 7
sooner 7
had 7
he 7
left 7
her 7
than 7
the 7
impression 7
she 7
had 7
made 7
on 7
him 7
would 7
fade 7
away 7
so 7
she 7
made 7
one 7
more 7
effort 7
to 7
keep 7
him 7
and 7
after 7
assuring 7
him 7
that 7
she 7
entirely 7
approved 7
of 7
his 7
anxiety 7
to 7
see 7
his 7
father 7
begged 7
him 7
to 7
give 7
her 7
a 7
day 7
or 7
two 7
more 7
of 7
his 7
company 7
in 7
common 7
politeness 7
the 7
prince 7
could 7
hardly 7
refuse 7
this 7
request 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
set 7
about 7
inventing 7
every 7
kind 7
of 7
amusement 7
for 7
him 7
and 7
succeeded 7
so 7
well 7
that 7
two 7
months 7
slipped 7
by 7
almost 7
unnoticed 7
in 7
balls 7
spectacles 7
and 7
in 7
hunting 7
of 7
which 7
when 7
unattended 7
by 7
danger 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
passionately 7
fond 7
but 7
at 7
last 7
one 7
day 7
he 7
declared 7
seriously 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
neglect 7
his 7
duty 7
no 7
longer 7
and 7
entreated 7
her 7
to 7
put 7
no 7
further 7
obstacles 7
in 7
his 7
way 7
promising 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
to 7
return 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
he 7
could 7
with 7
all 7
the 7
magnificence 7
due 7
both 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
to 7
himself 7
princess 7
he 7
added 7
it 7
may 7
be 7
that 7
in 7
your 7
heart 7
you 7
class 7
me 7
with 7
those 7
false 7
lovers 7
whose 7
devotion 7
cannot 7
stand 7
the 7
test 7
of 7
absence 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
you 7
wrong 7
me 7
and 7
were 7
it 7
not 7
for 7
fear 7
of 7
offending 7
you 7
i 7
would 7
beseech 7
you 7
to 7
come 7
with 7
me 7
for 7
my 7
life 7
can 7
only 7
be 7
happy 7
when 7
passed 7
with 7
you 7
as 7
for 7
your 7
reception 7
at 7
the 7
persian 7
court 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
as 7
warm 7
as 7
your 7
merits 7
deserve 7
and 7
as 7
for 7
what 7
concerns 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
bengal 7
he 7
must 7
be 7
much 7
more 7
indifferent 7
to 7
your 7
welfare 7
than 7
you 7
have 7
led 7
me 7
to 7
believe 7
if 7
he 7
does 7
not 7
give 7
his 7
consent 7
to 7
our 7
marriage 7
the 7
princess 7
could 7
not 7
find 7
words 7
in 7
which 7
to 7
reply 7
to 7
the 7
arguments 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
but 7
her 7
silence 7
and 7
her 7
downcast 7
eyes 7
spoke 7
for 7
her 7
and 7
declared 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
no 7
objection 7
to 7
accompanying 7
him 7
on 7
his 7
travels 7
the 7
only 7
difficulty 7
that 7
occurred 7
to 7
her 7
was 7
that 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
did 7
not 7
know 7
how 7
to 7
manage 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
she 7
dreaded 7
lest 7
they 7
might 7
find 7
themselves 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
plight 7
as 7
before 7
but 7
the 7
prince 7
soothed 7
her 7
fears 7
so 7
successfully 7
that 7
she 7
soon 7
had 7
no 7
other 7
thought 7
than 7
to 7
arrange 7
for 7
their 7
flight 7
so 7
secretly 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
in 7
the 7
palace 7
should 7
suspect 7
it 7
this 7
was 7
done 7
and 7
early 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
when 7
the 7
whole 7
palace 7
was 7
wrapped 7
in 7
sleep 7
she 7
stole 7
up 7
on 7
to 7
the 7
roof 7
where 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
already 7
awaiting 7
her 7
with 7
his 7
horses 7
head 7
towards 7
persia 7
he 7
mounted 7
first 7
and 7
helped 7
the 7
princess 7
up 7
behind 7
then 7
when 7
she 7
was 7
firmly 7
seated 7
with 7
her 7
hands 7
holding 7
tightly 7
to 7
his 7
belt 7
he 7
touched 7
the 7
screw 7
and 7
the 7
horse 7
began 7
to 7
leave 7
the 7
earth 7
quickly 7
behind 7
him 7
he 7
travelled 7
with 7
his 7
accustomed 7
speed 7
and 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
guided 7
him 7
so 7
well 7
that 7
in 7
two 7
hours 7
and 7
a 7
half 7
from 7
the 7
time 7
of 7
starting 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
persia 7
lying 7
beneath 7
him 7
he 7
determined 7
to 7
alight 7
neither 7
in 7
the 7
great 7
square 7
from 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
started 7
nor 7
in 7
the 7
sultans 7
palace 7
but 7
in 7
a 7
country 7
house 7
at 7
a 7
little 7
distance 7
from 7
the 7
town 7
here 7
he 7
showed 7
the 7
princess 7
a 7
beautiful 7
suite 7
of 7
rooms 7
and 7
begged 7
her 7
to 7
rest 7
while 7
he 7
informed 7
his 7
father 7
of 7
their 7
arrival 7
and 7
prepared 7
a 7
public 7
reception 7
worthy 7
of 7
her 7
rank 7
then 7
he 7
ordered 7
a 7
horse 7
to 7
be 7
saddled 7
and 7
set 7
out 7
all 7
the 7
way 7
through 7
the 7
streets 7
he 7
was 7
welcomed 7
with 7
shouts 7
of 7
joy 7
by 7
the 7
people 7
who 7
had 7
long 7
lost 7
all 7
hope 7
of 7
seeing 7
him 7
again 7
on 7
reaching 7
the 7
palace 7
he 7
found 7
the 7
sultan 7
surrounded 7
by 7
his 7
ministers 7
all 7
clad 7
in 7
the 7
deepest 7
mourning 7
and 7
his 7
father 7
almost 7
went 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
mind 7
with 7
surprise 7
and 7
delight 7
at 7
the 7
mere 7
sound 7
of 7
his 7
sons 7
voice 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
calmed 7
down 7
a 7
little 7
he 7
begged 7
the 7
prince 7
to 7
relate 7
his 7
adventures 7
the 7
prince 7
at 7
once 7
seized 7
the 7
opening 7
thus 7
given 7
him 7
and 7
told 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
of 7
his 7
treatment 7
by 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
not 7
even 7
concealing 7
the 7
fact 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
fallen 7
in 7
love 7
with 7
him 7
and 7
sire 7
ended 7
the 7
prince 7
having 7
given 7
my 7
royal 7
word 7
that 7
you 7
would 7
not 7
refuse 7
your 7
consent 7
to 7
our 7
marriage 7
i 7
persuaded 7
her 7
to 7
return 7
with 7
me 7
on 7
the 7
indians 7
horse 7
i 7
have 7
left 7
her 7
in 7
one 7
of 7
your 7
highnesss 7
country 7
houses 7
where 7
she 7
is 7
waiting 7
anxiously 7
to 7
be 7
assured 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
promised 7
in 7
vain 7
as 7
he 7
said 7
this 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
throw 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
feet 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
but 7
his 7
father 7
prevented 7
him 7
and 7
embracing 7
him 7
again 7
said 7
eagerly 7

gladly 7

to 7
your 7

but 7

will 7
hasten 7
to 7
pay 7
my 7
respects 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
to 7
thank 7
her 7
in 7
my 7
own 7
person 7
for 7
the 7
benefits 7
she 7
has 7
conferred 7
on 7
you 7
i 7
will 7
then 7
bring 7
her 7
back 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
make 7
all 7
arrangements 7
for 7
the 7
wedding 7
to 7
be 7
celebrated 7
today 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
gave 7
orders 7
that 7
the 7
habits 7
of 7
mourning 7
worn 7
by 7
the 7
people 7
should 7
be 7
thrown 7
off 7
and 7
that 7
there 7
should 7
be 7
a 7
concert 7
of 7
drums 7
trumpets 7
and 7
cymbals 7
also 7
that 7
the 7
indian 7
should 7
be 7
taken 7
from 7
prison 7
and 7
brought 7
before 7
him 7
his 7
commands 7
were 7
obeyed 7
and 7
the 7
indian 7
was 7
led 7
into 7
his 7
presence 7
surrounded 7
by 7
guards 7
i 7
have 7
kept 7
you 7
locked 7
up 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
so 7
that 7
in 7
case 7
my 7
son 7
was 7
lost 7
your 7
life 7
should 7
pay 7
the 7
penalty 7
he 7
has 7
now 7
returned 7
so 7
take 7
your 7
horse 7
and 7
begone 7
for 7
ever 7
the 7
indian 7
hastily 7
quitted 7
the 7
presence 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
outside 7
he 7
inquired 7
of 7
the 7
man 7
who 7
had 7
taken 7
him 7
out 7
of 7
prison 7
where 7
the 7
prince 7
had 7
really 7
been 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
and 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
doing 7
they 7
told 7
him 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
and 7
how 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
was 7
even 7
then 7
awaiting 7
in 7
the 7
country 7
palace 7
the 7
consent 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
which 7
at 7
once 7
put 7
into 7
the 7
indians 7
head 7
a 7
plan 7
of 7
revenge 7
for 7
the 7
treatment 7
he 7
had 7
experienced 7
going 7
straight 7
to 7
the 7
country 7
house 7
he 7
informed 7
the 7
doorkeeper 7
who 7
was 7
left 7
in 7
charge 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
sent 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
by 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
to 7
fetch 7
the 7
princess 7
on 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
and 7
to 7
bring 7
her 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
doorkeeper 7
knew 7
the 7
indian 7
by 7
sight 7
and 7
was 7
of 7
course 7
aware 7
that 7
nearly 7
three 7
months 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
thrown 7
into 7
prison 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
seeing 7
him 7
at 7
liberty 7
the 7
man 7
took 7
for 7
granted 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
speaking 7
the 7
truth 7
and 7
made 7
no 7
difficulty 7
about 7
leading 7
him 7
before 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
while 7
on 7
her 7
side 7
hearing 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
come 7
from 7
the 7
prince 7
the 7
lady 7
gladly 7
consented 7
to 7
do 7
what 7
he 7
wished 7
the 7
indian 7
delighted 7
with 7
the 7
success 7
of 7
his 7
scheme 7
mounted 7
the 7
horse 7
assisted 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
mount 7
behind 7
him 7
and 7
turned 7
the 7
peg 7
at 7
the 7
very 7
moment 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
was 7
leaving 7
the 7
palace 7
in 7
schiraz 7
for 7
the 7
country 7
house 7
followed 7
closely 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
court 7
knowing 7
this 7
the 7
indian 7
deliberately 7
steered 7
the 7
horse 7
right 7
above 7
the 7
city 7
in 7
order 7
that 7
his 7
revenge 7
for 7
his 7
unjust 7
imprisonment 7
might 7
be 7
all 7
the 7
quicker 7
and 7
sweeter 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
persia 7
saw 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
its 7
riders 7
he 7
stopped 7
short 7
with 7
astonishment 7
and 7
horror 7
and 7
broke 7
out 7
into 7
oaths 7
and 7
curses 7
which 7
the 7
indian 7
heard 7
quite 7
unmoved 7
knowing 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
perfectly 7
safe 7
from 7
pursuit 7
but 7
mortified 7
and 7
furious 7
as 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
his 7
feelings 7
were 7
nothing 7
to 7
those 7
of 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
when 7
he 7
saw 7
the 7
object 7
of 7
his 7
passionate 7
devotion 7
being 7
borne 7
rapidly 7
away 7
and 7
while 7
he 7
was 7
struck 7
speechless 7
with 7
grief 7
and 7
remorse 7
at 7
not 7
having 7
guarded 7
her 7
better 7
she 7
vanished 7
swiftly 7
out 7
of 7
his 7
sight 7
what 7
was 7
he 7
to 7
do 7
should 7
he 7
follow 7
his 7
father 7
into 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
there 7
give 7
reins 7
to 7
his 7
despair 7
both 7
his 7
love 7
and 7
his 7
courage 7
alike 7
forbade 7
it 7
and 7
he 7
continued 7
his 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
prince 7
showed 7
the 7
doorkeeper 7
of 7
what 7
folly 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
guilty 7
and 7
flinging 7
himself 7
at 7
his 7
masters 7
feet 7
implored 7
his 7
pardon 7
rise 7
said 7
the 7
prince 7
i 7
am 7
the 7
cause 7
of 7
this 7
misfortune 7
and 7
not 7
you 7
go 7
and 7
find 7
me 7
the 7
dress 7
of 7
a 7
dervish 7
but 7
beware 7
of 7
saying 7
it 7
is 7
for 7
me 7
at 7
a 7
short 7
distance 7
from 7
the 7
country 7
house 7
a 7
convent 7
of 7
dervishes 7
was 7
situated 7
and 7
the 7
superior 7
or 7
scheih 7
was 7
the 7
doorkeepers 7
friend 7
so 7
by 7
means 7
of 7
a 7
false 7
story 7
made 7
up 7
on 7
the 7
spur 7
of 7
the 7
moment 7
it 7
was 7
easy 7
enough 7
to 7
get 7
hold 7
of 7
a 7
dervishs 7
dress 7
which 7
the 7
prince 7
at 7
once 7
put 7
on 7
instead 7
of 7
his 7
own 7
disguised 7
like 7
this 7
and 7
concealing 7
about 7
him 7
a 7
box 7
of 7
pearls 7
and 7
diamonds 7
he 7
had 7
intended 7
as 7
a 7
present 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
he 7
left 7
the 7
house 7
at 7
nightfall 7
uncertain 7
where 7
he 7
should 7
go 7
but 7
firmly 7
resolved 7
not 7
to 7
return 7
without 7
her 7
meanwhile 7
the 7
indian 7
had 7
turned 7
the 7
horse 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
direction 7
that 7
before 7
many 7
hours 7
had 7
passed 7
it 7
had 7
entered 7
a 7
wood 7
close 7
to 7
the 7
capital 7
of 7
the 7
kingdom 7
of 7
cashmere 7
feeling 7
very 7
hungry 7
and 7
supposing 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
also 7
might 7
be 7
in 7
want 7
of 7
food 7
he 7
brought 7
his 7
steed 7
down 7
to 7
the 7
earth 7
and 7
left 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
a 7
shady 7
place 7
on 7
the 7
banks 7
of 7
a 7
clear 7
stream 7
at 7
first 7
when 7
the 7
princess 7
had 7
found 7
herself 7
alone 7
the 7
idea 7
had 7
occurred 7
to 7
her 7
of 7
trying 7
to 7
escape 7
and 7
hide 7
herself 7
but 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
eaten 7
scarcely 7
anything 7
since 7
she 7
had 7
left 7
bengal 7
she 7
felt 7
she 7
was 7
too 7
weak 7
to 7
venture 7
far 7
and 7
was 7
obliged 7
to 7
abandon 7
her 7
design 7
on 7
the 7
return 7
of 7
the 7
indian 7
with 7
meats 7
of 7
various 7
kinds 7
she 7
began 7
to 7
eat 7
voraciously 7
and 7
soon 7
had 7
regained 7
sufficient 7
courage 7
to 7
reply 7
with 7
spirit 7
to 7
his 7
insolent 7
remarks 7
goaded 7
by 7
his 7
threats 7
she 7
sprang 7
to 7
her 7
feet 7
calling 7
loudly 7
for 7
help 7
and 7
luckily 7
her 7
cries 7
were 7
heard 7
by 7
a 7
troop 7
of 7
horsemen 7
who 7
rode 7
up 7
to 7
inquire 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
now 7
the 7
leader 7
of 7
these 7
horsemen 7
was 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
returning 7
from 7
the 7
chase 7
and 7
he 7
instantly 7
turned 7
to 7
the 7
indian 7
to 7
inquire 7
who 7
he 7
was 7
and 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
with 7
him 7
the 7
indian 7
rudely 7
answered 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
there 7
was 7
no 7
occasion 7
for 7
anyone 7
else 7
to 7
interfere 7
between 7
them 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
of 7
course 7
was 7
ignorant 7
of 7
the 7
rank 7
of 7
her 7
deliverer 7
denied 7
altogether 7
the 7
indians 7
story 7
my 7
lord 7
she 7
cried 7
whoever 7
you 7
may 7
be 7
put 7
no 7
faith 7
in 7
this 7
impostor 7
he 7
is 7
an 7
abominable 7
magician 7
who 7
has 7
this 7
day 7
torn 7
me 7
from 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
my 7
destined 7
husband 7
and 7
has 7
brought 7
me 7
here 7
on 7
this 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
she 7
would 7
have 7
continued 7
but 7
her 7
tears 7
choked 7
her 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
convinced 7
by 7
her 7
beauty 7
and 7
her 7
distinguished 7
air 7
of 7
the 7
truth 7
of 7
her 7
tale 7
ordered 7
his 7
followers 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
the 7
indians 7
head 7
which 7
was 7
done 7
immediately 7
but 7
rescued 7
though 7
she 7
was 7
from 7
one 7
peril 7
it 7
seemed 7
as 7
if 7
she 7
had 7
only 7
fallen 7
into 7
another 7
the 7
sultan 7
commanded 7
a 7
horse 7
to 7
be 7
given 7
her 7
and 7
conducted 7
her 7
to 7
his 7
own 7
palace 7
where 7
he 7
led 7
her 7
to 7
a 7
beautiful 7
apartment 7
and 7
selected 7
female 7
slaves 7
to 7
wait 7
on 7
her 7
and 7
eunuchs 7
to 7
be 7
her 7
guard 7
then 7
without 7
allowing 7
her 7
time 7
to 7
thank 7
him 7
for 7
all 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
he 7
bade 7
her 7
repose 7
saying 7
she 7
should 7
tell 7
him 7
her 7
adventures 7
on 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
the 7
princess 7
fell 7
asleep 7
flattering 7
herself 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
only 7
to 7
relate 7
her 7
story 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
to 7
be 7
touched 7
by 7
compassion 7
and 7
to 7
restore 7
her 7
to 7
the 7
prince 7
without 7
delay 7
but 7
a 7
few 7
hours 7
were 7
to 7
undeceive 7
her 7
when 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
cashmere 7
had 7
quitted 7
her 7
presence 7
the 7
evening 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
resolved 7
that 7
the 7
sun 7
should 7
not 7
set 7
again 7
without 7
the 7
princess 7
becoming 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
at 7
daybreak 7
proclamation 7
of 7
his 7
intention 7
was 7
made 7
throughout 7
the 7
town 7
by 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
drums 7
trumpets 7
cymbals 7
and 7
other 7
instruments 7
calculated 7
to 7
fill 7
the 7
heart 7
with 7
joy 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
was 7
early 7
awakened 7
by 7
the 7
noise 7
but 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
for 7
one 7
moment 7
imagine 7
that 7
it 7
had 7
anything 7
to 7
do 7
with 7
her 7
till 7
the 7
sultan 7
arriving 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
dressed 7
to 7
inquire 7
after 7
her 7
health 7
informed 7
her 7
that 7
the 7
trumpet 7
blasts 7
she 7
heard 7
were 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
solemn 7
marriage 7
ceremonies 7
for 7
which 7
he 7
begged 7
her 7
to 7
prepare 7
this 7
unexpected 7
announcement 7
caused 7
the 7
princess 7
such 7
terror 7
that 7
she 7
sank 7
down 7
in 7
a 7
dead 7
faint 7
the 7
slaves 7
that 7
were 7
in 7
waiting 7
ran 7
to 7
her 7
aid 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
himself 7
did 7
his 7
best 7
to 7
bring 7
her 7
back 7
to 7
consciousness 7
but 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
while 7
it 7
was 7
all 7
to 7
no 7
purpose 7
at 7
length 7
her 7
senses 7
began 7
slowly 7
to 7
come 7
back 7
to 7
her 7
and 7
then 7
rather 7
than 7
break 7
faith 7
with 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
by 7
consenting 7
to 7
such 7
a 7
marriage 7
she 7
determined 7
to 7
feign 7
madness 7
so 7
she 7
began 7
by 7
saying 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
absurdities 7
and 7
using 7
all 7
kinds 7
of 7
strange 7
gestures 7
while 7
the 7
sultan 7
stood 7
watching 7
her 7
with 7
sorrow 7
and 7
surprise 7
but 7
as 7
this 7
sudden 7
seizure 7
showed 7
no 7
sign 7
of 7
abating 7
he 7
left 7
her 7
to 7
her 7
women 7
ordering 7
them 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
greatest 7
care 7
of 7
her 7
still 7
as 7
the 7
day 7
went 7
on 7
the 7
malady 7
seemed 7
to 7
become 7
worse 7
and 7
by 7
night 7
it 7
was 7
almost 7
violent 7
days 7
passed 7
in 7
this 7
manner 7
till 7
at 7
last 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
decided 7
to 7
summon 7
all 7
the 7
doctors 7
of 7
his 7
court 7
to 7
consult 7
together 7
over 7
her 7
sad 7
state 7
their 7
answer 7
was 7
that 7
madness 7
is 7
of 7
so 7
many 7
different 7
kinds 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
impossible 7
to 7
give 7
an 7
opinion 7
on 7
the 7
case 7
without 7
seeing 7
the 7
princess 7
so 7
the 7
sultan 7
gave 7
orders 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
to 7
be 7
introduced 7
into 7
her 7
chamber 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
every 7
man 7
according 7
to 7
his 7
rank 7
this 7
decision 7
had 7
been 7
foreseen 7
by 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
knew 7
quite 7
well 7
that 7
if 7
once 7
she 7
allowed 7
the 7
physicians 7
to 7
feel 7
her 7
pulse 7
the 7
most 7
ignorant 7
of 7
them 7
would 7
discover 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
in 7
perfectly 7
good 7
health 7
and 7
that 7
her 7
madness 7
was 7
feigned 7
so 7
as 7
each 7
man 7
approached 7
she 7
broke 7
out 7
into 7
such 7
violent 7
paroxysms 7
that 7
not 7
one 7
dared 7
to 7
lay 7
a 7
finger 7
on 7
her 7
a 7
few 7
who 7
pretended 7
to 7
be 7
cleverer 7
than 7
the 7
rest 7
declared 7
that 7
they 7
could 7
diagnose 7
sick 7
people 7
only 7
from 7
sight 7
ordered 7
her 7
certain 7
potions 7
which 7
she 7
made 7
no 7
difficulty 7
about 7
taking 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
persuaded 7
they 7
were 7
all 7
harmless 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
court 7
doctors 7
could 7
do 7
nothing 7
towards 7
curing 7
the 7
princess 7
he 7
called 7
in 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
city 7
who 7
fared 7
no 7
better 7
then 7
he 7
had 7
recourse 7
to 7
the 7
most 7
celebrated 7
physicians 7
in 7
the 7
other 7
large 7
towns 7
but 7
finding 7
that 7
the 7
task 7
was 7
beyond 7
their 7
science 7
he 7
finally 7
sent 7
messengers 7
into 7
the 7
other 7
neighbouring 7
states 7
with 7
a 7
memorandum 7
containing 7
full 7
particulars 7
of 7
the 7
princesss 7
madness 7
offering 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
to 7
pay 7
the 7
expenses 7
of 7
any 7
physician 7
who 7
would 7
come 7
and 7
see 7
for 7
himself 7
and 7
a 7
handsome 7
reward 7
to 7
the 7
one 7
who 7
should 7
cure 7
her 7
in 7
answer 7
to 7
this 7
proclamation 7
many 7
foreign 7
professors 7
flocked 7
into 7
cashmere 7
but 7
they 7
naturally 7
were 7
not 7
more 7
successful 7
than 7
the 7
rest 7
had 7
been 7
as 7
the 7
cure 7
depended 7
neither 7
on 7
them 7
nor 7
their 7
skill 7
but 7
only 7
on 7
the 7
princess 7
herself 7
it 7
was 7
during 7
this 7
time 7
that 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
wandering 7
sadly 7
and 7
hopelessly 7
from 7
place 7
to 7
place 7
arrived 7
in 7
a 7
large 7
city 7
of 7
india 7
where 7
he 7
heard 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
talk 7
about 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
who 7
had 7
gone 7
out 7
of 7
her 7
senses 7
on 7
the 7
very 7
day 7
that 7
she 7
was 7
to 7
have 7
been 7
married 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
this 7
was 7
quite 7
enough 7
to 7
induce 7
him 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
road 7
to 7
cashmere 7
and 7
to 7
inquire 7
at 7
the 7
first 7
inn 7
at 7
which 7
he 7
lodged 7
in 7
the 7
capital 7
the 7
full 7
particulars 7
of 7
the 7
story 7
when 7
he 7
knew 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
at 7
last 7
found 7
the 7
princess 7
whom 7
he 7
had 7
so 7
long 7
lost 7
he 7
set 7
about 7
devising 7
a 7
plan 7
for 7
her 7
rescue 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
he 7
did 7
was 7
to 7
procure 7
a 7
doctors 7
robe 7
so 7
that 7
his 7
dress 7
added 7
to 7
the 7
long 7
beard 7
he 7
had 7
allowed 7
to 7
grow 7
on 7
his 7
travels 7
might 7
unmistakably 7
proclaim 7
his 7
profession 7
he 7
then 7
lost 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
going 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
where 7
he 7
obtained 7
an 7
audience 7
of 7
the 7
chief 7
usher 7
and 7
while 7
apologising 7
for 7
his 7
boldness 7
in 7
presuming 7
to 7
think 7
that 7
he 7
could 7
cure 7
the 7
princess 7
where 7
so 7
many 7
others 7
had 7
failed 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
the 7
secret 7
of 7
certain 7
remedies 7
which 7
had 7
hitherto 7
never 7
failed 7
of 7
their 7
effect 7
the 7
chief 7
usher 7
assured 7
him 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
heartily 7
welcome 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
sultan 7
would 7
receive 7
him 7
with 7
pleasure 7
and 7
in 7
case 7
of 7
success 7
he 7
would 7
gain 7
a 7
magnificent 7
reward 7
when 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
in 7
the 7
disguise 7
of 7
a 7
physician 7
was 7
brought 7
before 7
him 7
the 7
sultan 7
wasted 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
talking 7
beyond 7
remarking 7
that 7
the 7
mere 7
sight 7
of 7
a 7
doctor 7
threw 7
the 7
princess 7
into 7
transports 7
of 7
rage 7
he 7
then 7
led 7
the 7
prince 7
up 7
to 7
a 7
room 7
under 7
the 7
roof 7
which 7
had 7
an 7
opening 7
through 7
which 7
he 7
might 7
observe 7
the 7
princess 7
without 7
himself 7
being 7
seen 7
the 7
prince 7
looked 7
and 7
beheld 7
the 7
princess 7
reclining 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
with 7
tears 7
in 7
her 7
eyes 7
singing 7
softly 7
to 7
herself 7
a 7
song 7
bewailing 7
her 7
sad 7
destiny 7
which 7
had 7
deprived 7
her 7
perhaps 7
for 7
ever 7
of 7
a 7
being 7
she 7
so 7
tenderly 7
loved 7
the 7
young 7
mans 7
heart 7
beat 7
fast 7
as 7
he 7
listened 7
for 7
he 7
needed 7
no 7
further 7
proof 7
that 7
her 7
madness 7
was 7
feigned 7
and 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
love 7
of 7
him 7
which 7
had 7
caused 7
her 7
to 7
resort 7
to 7
this 7
species 7
of 7
trick 7
he 7
softly 7
left 7
his 7
hidingplace 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
sultan 7
to 7
whom 7
he 7
reported 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
sure 7
from 7
certain 7
signs 7
that 7
the 7
princesss 7
malady 7
was 7
not 7
incurable 7
but 7
that 7
he 7
must 7
see 7
her 7
and 7
speak 7
with 7
her 7
alone 7
the 7
sultan 7
made 7
no 7
difficulty 7
in 7
consenting 7
to 7
this 7
and 7
commanded 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
be 7
ushered 7
in 7
to 7
the 7
princesss 7
apartment 7
the 7
moment 7
she 7
caught 7
sight 7
of 7
his 7
physicians 7
robe 7
she 7
sprang 7
from 7
her 7
seat 7
in 7
a 7
fury 7
and 7
heaped 7
insults 7
upon 7
him 7
the 7
prince 7
took 7
no 7
notice 7
of 7
her 7
behaviour 7
and 7
approaching 7
quite 7
close 7
so 7
that 7
his 7
words 7
might 7
be 7
heard 7
by 7
her 7
alone 7
he 7
said 7
in 7
a 7
low 7
whisper 7
look 7
at 7
me 7
princess 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
no 7
doctor 7
but 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
who 7
has 7
come 7
to 7
set 7
you 7
free 7
at 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
his 7
voice 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
suddenly 7
grew 7
calm 7
and 7
an 7
expression 7
of 7
joy 7
overspread 7
her 7
face 7
such 7
as 7
only 7
comes 7
when 7
what 7
we 7
wish 7
for 7
most 7
and 7
expect 7
the 7
least 7
suddenly 7
happens 7
to 7
us 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
she 7
was 7
too 7
enchanted 7
to 7
speak 7
and 7
prince 7
firouz 7
schah 7
took 7
advantage 7
of 7
her 7
silence 7
to 7
explain 7
to 7
her 7
all 7
that 7
had 7
occurred 7
his 7
despair 7
at 7
watching 7
her 7
disappear 7
before 7
his 7
very 7
eyes 7
the 7
oath 7
he 7
had 7
sworn 7
to 7
follow 7
her 7
over 7
the 7
world 7
and 7
his 7
rapture 7
at 7
finally 7
discovering 7
her 7
in 7
the 7
palace 7
at 7
cashmere 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
finished 7
he 7
begged 7
in 7
his 7
turn 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
would 7
tell 7
him 7
how 7
she 7
had 7
come 7
there 7
so 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
the 7
better 7
devise 7
some 7
means 7
of 7
rescuing 7
her 7
from 7
the 7
tyranny 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
it 7
needed 7
but 7
a 7
few 7
words 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
acquainted 7
with 7
the 7
whole 7
situation 7
and 7
how 7
she 7
had 7
been 7
forced 7
to 7
play 7
the 7
part 7
of 7
a 7
mad 7
woman 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
escape 7
from 7
a 7
marriage 7
with 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
had 7
not 7
had 7
sufficient 7
politeness 7
even 7
to 7
ask 7
her 7
consent 7
if 7
necessary 7
she 7
added 7
she 7
had 7
resolved 7
to 7
die 7
sooner 7
than 7
permit 7
herself 7
to 7
be 7
forced 7
into 7
such 7
a 7
union 7
and 7
break 7
faith 7
with 7
a 7
prince 7
whom 7
she 7
loved 7
the 7
prince 7
then 7
inquired 7
if 7
she 7
knew 7
what 7
had 7
become 7
of 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
since 7
the 7
indians 7
death 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
could 7
only 7
reply 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
heard 7
nothing 7
about 7
it 7
still 7
she 7
did 7
not 7
suppose 7
that 7
the 7
horse 7
could 7
have 7
been 7
forgotten 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
after 7
all 7
she 7
had 7
told 7
him 7
of 7
its 7
value 7
to 7
this 7
the 7
prince 7
agreed 7
and 7
they 7
consulted 7
together 7
over 7
a 7
plan 7
by 7
which 7
she 7
might 7
be 7
able 7
to 7
make 7
her 7
escape 7
and 7
return 7
with 7
him 7
into 7
persia 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
first 7
step 7
she 7
was 7
to 7
dress 7
herself 7
with 7
care 7
and 7
receive 7
the 7
sultan 7
with 7
civility 7
when 7
he 7
visited 7
her 7
next 7
morning 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
transported 7
with 7
delight 7
on 7
learning 7
the 7
result 7
of 7
the 7
interview 7
and 7
his 7
opinion 7
of 7
the 7
doctors 7
skill 7
was 7
raised 7
still 7
higher 7
when 7
on 7
the 7
following 7
day 7
the 7
princess 7
behaved 7
towards 7
him 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
way 7
as 7
to 7
persuade 7
him 7
that 7
her 7
complete 7
cure 7
would 7
not 7
be 7
long 7
delayed 7
however 7
he 7
contented 7
himself 7
with 7
assuring 7
her 7
how 7
happy 7
he 7
was 7
to 7
see 7
her 7
health 7
so 7
much 7
improved 7
and 7
exhorted 7
her 7
to 7
make 7
every 7
use 7
of 7
so 7
clever 7
a 7
physician 7
and 7
to 7
repose 7
entire 7
confidence 7
in 7
him 7
then 7
he 7
retired 7
without 7
awaiting 7
any 7
reply 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
left 7
the 7
room 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
time 7
and 7
asked 7
if 7
he 7
might 7
be 7
allowed 7
humbly 7
to 7
inquire 7
by 7
what 7
means 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
had 7
reached 7
cashmere 7
which 7
was 7
so 7
far 7
distant 7
from 7
her 7
fathers 7
kingdom 7
and 7
how 7
she 7
came 7
to 7
be 7
there 7
alone 7
the 7
sultan 7
thought 7
the 7
question 7
very 7
natural 7
and 7
told 7
him 7
the 7
same 7
story 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
had 7
done 7
adding 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
ordered 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
to 7
be 7
taken 7
to 7
his 7
treasury 7
as 7
a 7
curiosity 7
though 7
he 7
was 7
quite 7
ignorant 7
how 7
it 7
could 7
be 7
used 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
physician 7
your 7
highnesss 7
tale 7
has 7
supplied 7
me 7
with 7
the 7
clue 7
i 7
needed 7
to 7
complete 7
the 7
recovery 7
of 7
the 7
princess 7
during 7
her 7
voyage 7
hither 7
on 7
an 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
a 7
portion 7
of 7
its 7
enchantment 7
has 7
by 7
some 7
means 7
been 7
communicated 7
to 7
her 7
person 7
and 7
it 7
can 7
only 7
be 7
dissipated 7
by 7
certain 7
perfumes 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
possess 7
the 7
secret 7
if 7
your 7
highness 7
will 7
deign 7
to 7
consent 7
and 7
to 7
give 7
the 7
court 7
and 7
the 7
people 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
most 7
astonishing 7
spectacles 7
they 7
have 7
ever 7
witnessed 7
command 7
the 7
horse 7
to 7
be 7
brought 7
into 7
the 7
big 7
square 7
outside 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
leave 7
the 7
rest 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
promise 7
that 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
few 7
moments 7
in 7
presence 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
assembled 7
multitude 7
you 7
shall 7
see 7
the 7
princess 7
as 7
healthy 7
both 7
in 7
mind 7
and 7
body 7
as 7
ever 7
she 7
was 7
in 7
her 7
life 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
make 7
the 7
spectacle 7
as 7
impressive 7
as 7
possible 7
i 7
would 7
suggest 7
that 7
she 7
should 7
be 7
richly 7
dressed 7
and 7
covered 7
with 7
the 7
noblest 7
jewels 7
of 7
the 7
crown 7
the 7
sultan 7
readily 7
agreed 7
to 7
all 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
proposed 7
and 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
he 7
desired 7
that 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
should 7
be 7
taken 7
from 7
the 7
treasury 7
and 7
brought 7
into 7
the 7
great 7
square 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
soon 7
the 7
rumour 7
began 7
to 7
spread 7
through 7
the 7
town 7
that 7
something 7
extraordinary 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
happen 7
and 7
such 7
a 7
crowd 7
began 7
to 7
collect 7
that 7
the 7
guards 7
had 7
to 7
be 7
called 7
out 7
to 7
keep 7
order 7
and 7
to 7
make 7
a 7
way 7
for 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
when 7
all 7
was 7
ready 7
the 7
sultan 7
appeared 7
and 7
took 7
his 7
place 7
on 7
a 7
platform 7
surrounded 7
by 7
the 7
chief 7
nobles 7
and 7
officers 7
of 7
his 7
court 7
when 7
they 7
were 7
seated 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
was 7
seen 7
leaving 7
the 7
palace 7
accompanied 7
by 7
the 7
ladies 7
who 7
had 7
been 7
assigned 7
to 7
her 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
she 7
slowly 7
approached 7
the 7
enchanted 7
horse 7
and 7
with 7
the 7
help 7
of 7
her 7
ladies 7
she 7
mounted 7
on 7
its 7
back 7
directly 7
she 7
was 7
in 7
the 7
saddle 7
with 7
her 7
feet 7
in 7
the 7
stirrups 7
and 7
the 7
bridle 7
in 7
her 7
hand 7
the 7
physician 7
placed 7
around 7
the 7
horse 7
some 7
large 7
braziers 7
full 7
of 7
burning 7
coals 7
into 7
each 7
of 7
which 7
he 7
threw 7
a 7
perfume 7
composed 7
of 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
delicious 7
scents 7
then 7
he 7
crossed 7
his 7
hands 7
over 7
his 7
breast 7
and 7
with 7
lowered 7
eyes 7
walked 7
three 7
times 7
round 7
the 7
horse 7
muttering 7
the 7
while 7
certain 7
words 7
soon 7
there 7
arose 7
from 7
the 7
burning 7
braziers 7
a 7
thick 7
smoke 7
which 7
almost 7
concealed 7
both 7
the 7
horse 7
and 7
princess 7
and 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
moment 7
for 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
waiting 7
springing 7
lightly 7
up 7
behind 7
the 7
lady 7
he 7
leaned 7
forward 7
and 7
turned 7
the 7
peg 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
horse 7
darted 7
up 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
he 7
cried 7
aloud 7
so 7
that 7
his 7
words 7
were 7
heard 7
by 7
all 7
present 7
sultan 7
of 7
cashmere 7
when 7
you 7
wish 7
to 7
marry 7
princesses 7
who 7
have 7
sought 7
your 7
protection 7
learn 7
first 7
to 7
gain 7
their 7
consent 7
it 7
was 7
in 7
this 7
way 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
of 7
persia 7
rescued 7
the 7
princess 7
of 7
bengal 7
and 7
returned 7
with 7
her 7
to 7
persia 7
where 7
they 7
descended 7
this 7
time 7
before 7
the 7
palace 7
of 7
the 7
king 7
himself 7
the 7
marriage 7
was 7
only 7
delayed 7
just 7
long 7
enough 7
to 7
make 7
the 7
ceremony 7
as 7
brilliant 7
as 7
possible 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
rejoicings 7
were 7
over 7
an 7
ambassador 7
was 7
sent 7
to 7
the 7
king 7
of 7
bengal 7
to 7
inform 7
him 7
of 7
what 7
had 7
passed 7
and 7
to 7
ask 7
his 7
approbation 7
of 7
the 7
alliance 7
between 7
the 7
two 7
countries 7
which 7
he 7
heartily 7
gave 7
the 7
story 7
of 7
two 7
sisters 7
who 7
were 7
jealous 7
of 7
their 7
younger 7
sister 7
once 7
upon 7
a 7
time 7
there 7
reigned 7
over 7
persia 7
a 7
sultan 7
named 7
kosrouschah 7
who 7
from 7
his 7
boyhood 7
had 7
been 7
fond 7
of 7
putting 7
on 7
a 7
disguise 7
and 7
seeking 7
adventures 7
in 7
all 7
parts 7
of 7
the 7
city 7
accompanied 7
by 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
officers 7
disguised 7
like 7
himself 7
and 7
no 7
sooner 7
was 7
his 7
father 7
buried 7
and 7
the 7
ceremonies 7
over 7
that 7
marked 7
his 7
accession 7
to 7
the 7
throne 7
than 7
the 7
young 7
man 7
hastened 7
to 7
throw 7
off 7
his 7
robes 7
of 7
state 7
and 7
calling 7
to 7
his 7
vizir 7
to 7
make 7
ready 7
likewise 7
stole 7
out 7
in 7
the 7
simple 7
dress 7
of 7
a 7
private 7
citizen 7
into 7
the 7
less 7
known 7
streets 7
of 7
the 7
capital 7
passing 7
down 7
a 7
lonely 7
street 7
the 7
sultan 7
heard 7
womens 7
voices 7
in 7
loud 7
discussion 7
and 7
peeping 7
through 7
a 7
crack 7
in 7
the 7
door 7
he 7
saw 7
three 7
sisters 7
sitting 7
on 7
a 7
sofa 7
in 7
a 7
large 7
hall 7
talking 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
lively 7
and 7
earnest 7
manner 7
judging 7
from 7
the 7
few 7
words 7
that 7
reached 7
his 7
ear 7
they 7
were 7
each 7
explaining 7
what 7
sort 7
of 7
men 7
they 7
wished 7
to 7
marry 7
i 7
ask 7
nothing 7
better 7
cried 7
the 7
eldest 7
than 7
to 7
have 7
the 7
sultans 7
baker 7
for 7
a 7
husband 7
think 7
of 7
being 7
able 7
to 7
eat 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
one 7
wanted 7
of 7
that 7
delicious 7
bread 7
that 7
is 7
baked 7
for 7
his 7
highness 7
alone 7
let 7
us 7
see 7
if 7
your 7
wish 7
is 7
as 7
good 7
as 7
mine 7
i 7
replied 7
the 7
second 7
sister 7
should 7
be 7
quite 7
content 7
with 7
the 7
sultans 7
head 7
cook 7
what 7
delicate 7
stews 7
i 7
should 7
feast 7
upon 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
persuaded 7
that 7
the 7
sultans 7
bread 7
is 7
used 7
all 7
through 7
the 7
palace 7
i 7
should 7
have 7
that 7
into 7
the 7
bargain 7
you 7
see 7
my 7
dear 7
sister 7
my 7
taste 7
is 7
as 7
good 7
as 7
yours 7
it 7
was 7
now 7
the 7
turn 7
of 7
the 7
youngest 7
sister 7
who 7
was 7
by 7
far 7
the 7
most 7
beautiful 7
of 7
the 7
three 7
and 7
had 7
besides 7
more 7
sense 7
than 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
as 7
for 7
me 7
she 7
said 7
i 7
should 7
take 7
a 7
higher 7
flight 7
and 7
if 7
we 7
are 7
to 7
wish 7
for 7
husbands 7
nothing 7
less 7
than 7
the 7
sultan 7
himself 7
will 7
do 7
for 7
me 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
amused 7
by 7
the 7
conversation 7
he 7
had 7
overheard 7
that 7
he 7
made 7
up 7
his 7
mind 7
to 7
gratify 7
their 7
wishes 7
and 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
he 7
bade 7
him 7
note 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
to 7
bring 7
the 7
ladies 7
into 7
his 7
presence 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
fulfilled 7
his 7
commission 7
and 7
hardly 7
giving 7
them 7
time 7
to 7
change 7
their 7
dresses 7
desired 7
the 7
three 7
sisters 7
to 7
follow 7
him 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
here 7
they 7
were 7
presented 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
and 7
when 7
they 7
had 7
bowed 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
sovereign 7
abruptly 7
put 7
the 7
question 7
to 7
them 7
tell 7
me 7
do 7
you 7
remember 7
what 7
you 7
wished 7
for 7
last 7
night 7
when 7
you 7
were 7
making 7
merry 7
fear 7
nothing 7
but 7
answer 7
me 7
the 7
truth 7
these 7
words 7
which 7
were 7
so 7
unexpected 7
threw 7
the 7
sisters 7
into 7
great 7
confusion 7
their 7
eyes 7
fell 7
and 7
the 7
blushes 7
of 7
the 7
youngest 7
did 7
not 7
fail 7
to 7
make 7
an 7
impression 7
on 7
the 7
heart 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
all 7
three 7
remained 7
silent 7
and 7
he 7
hastened 7
to 7
continue 7
do 7
not 7
be 7
afraid 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
the 7
slightest 7
intention 7
of 7
giving 7
you 7
pain 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
tell 7
you 7
at 7
once 7
that 7
i 7
know 7
the 7
wishes 7
formed 7
by 7
each 7
one 7
you 7
he 7
said 7
turning 7
to 7
the 7
youngest 7
who 7
desired 7
to 7
have 7
me 7
for 7
an 7
husband 7
shall 7
be 7
satisfied 7
this 7
very 7
day 7
and 7
you 7
he 7
added 7
addressing 7
himself 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
two 7
shall 7
be 7
married 7
at 7
the 7
same 7
moment 7
to 7
my 7
baker 7
and 7
to 7
my 7
chief 7
cook 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
finished 7
speaking 7
the 7
three 7
sisters 7
flung 7
themselves 7
at 7
his 7
feet 7
and 7
the 7
youngest 7
faltered 7
out 7
oh 7
sire 7
since 7
you 7
know 7
my 7
foolish 7
words 7
believe 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
only 7
said 7
in 7
joke 7
i 7
am 7
unworthy 7
of 7
the 7
honour 7
you 7
propose 7
to 7
do 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
can 7
only 7
ask 7
pardon 7
for 7
my 7
boldness 7
the 7
other 7
sisters 7
also 7
tried 7
to 7
excuse 7
themselves 7
but 7
the 7
sultan 7
would 7
hear 7
nothing 7
no 7
no 7
he 7
said 7
my 7
mind 7
is 7
made 7
up 7
your 7
wishes 7
shall 7
be 7
accomplished 7
so 7
the 7
three 7
weddings 7
were 7
celebrated 7
that 7
same 7
day 7
but 7
with 7
a 7
great 7
difference 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
youngest 7
was 7
marked 7
by 7
all 7
the 7
magnificence 7
that 7
was 7
customary 7
at 7
the 7
marriage 7
of 7
the 7
shah 7
of 7
persia 7
while 7
the 7
festivities 7
attending 7
the 7
nuptials 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
baker 7
and 7
his 7
chief 7
cook 7
were 7
only 7
such 7
as 7
were 7
suitable 7
to 7
their 7
conditions 7
this 7
though 7
quite 7
natural 7
was 7
highly 7
displeasing 7
to 7
the 7
elder 7
sisters 7
who 7
fell 7
into 7
a 7
passion 7
of 7
jealousy 7
which 7
in 7
the 7
end 7
caused 7
a 7
great 7
deal 7
of 7
trouble 7
and 7
pain 7
to 7
several 7
people 7
and 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
the 7
opportunity 7
of 7
speaking 7
to 7
each 7
other 7
which 7
was 7
not 7
till 7
several 7
days 7
later 7
at 7
a 7
public 7
bath 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
attempt 7
to 7
disguise 7
their 7
feelings 7
can 7
you 7
possibly 7
understand 7
what 7
the 7
sultan 7
saw 7
in 7
that 7
little 7
cat 7
said 7
one 7
to 7
the 7
other 7
for 7
him 7
to 7
be 7
so 7
fascinated 7
by 7
her 7
he 7
must 7
be 7
quite 7
blind 7
returned 7
the 7
wife 7
of 7
the 7
chief 7
cook 7
as 7
for 7
her 7
looking 7
a 7
little 7
younger 7
than 7
we 7
do 7
what 7
does 7
that 7
matter 7
you 7
would 7
have 7
made 7
a 7
far 7
better 7
sultana 7
than 7
she 7
oh 7
i 7
say 7
nothing 7
of 7
myself 7
replied 7
the 7
elder 7
and 7
if 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
chosen 7
you 7
it 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
all 7
very 7
well 7
but 7
it 7
really 7
grieves 7
me 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
have 7
selected 7
a 7
wretched 7
little 7
creature 7
like 7
that 7
however 7
i 7
will 7
be 7
revenged 7
on 7
her 7
somehow 7
and 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
will 7
give 7
me 7
your 7
help 7
in 7
the 7
matter 7
and 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
anything 7
that 7
you 7
can 7
think 7
of 7
that 7
is 7
likely 7
to 7
mortify 7
her 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
carry 7
out 7
their 7
wicked 7
scheme 7
the 7
two 7
sisters 7
met 7
constantly 7
to 7
talk 7
over 7
their 7
ideas 7
though 7
all 7
the 7
while 7
they 7
pretended 7
to 7
be 7
as 7
friendly 7
as 7
ever 7
towards 7
the 7
sultana 7
who 7
on 7
her 7
part 7
invariably 7
treated 7
them 7
with 7
kindness 7
for 7
a 7
long 7
time 7
no 7
plan 7
occurred 7
to 7
the 7
two 7
plotters 7
that 7
seemed 7
in 7
the 7
least 7
likely 7
to 7
meet 7
with 7
success 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
the 7
expected 7
birth 7
of 7
an 7
heir 7
gave 7
them 7
the 7
chance 7
for 7
which 7
they 7
had 7
been 7
hoping 7
they 7
obtained 7
permission 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
to 7
take 7
up 7
their 7
abode 7
in 7
the 7
palace 7
for 7
some 7
weeks 7
and 7
never 7
left 7
their 7
sister 7
night 7
or 7
day 7
when 7
at 7
last 7
a 7
little 7
boy 7
beautiful 7
as 7
the 7
sun 7
was 7
born 7
they 7
laid 7
him 7
in 7
his 7
cradle 7
and 7
carried 7
it 7
down 7
to 7
a 7
canal 7
which 7
passed 7
through 7
the 7
grounds 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
then 7
leaving 7
it 7
to 7
its 7
fate 7
they 7
informed 7
the 7
sultan 7
that 7
instead 7
of 7
the 7
son 7
he 7
had 7
so 7
fondly 7
desired 7
the 7
sultana 7
had 7
given 7
birth 7
to 7
a 7
puppy 7
at 7
this 7
dreadful 7
news 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
so 7
overcome 7
with 7
rage 7
and 7
grief 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
with 7
great 7
difficulty 7
that 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
managed 7
to 7
save 7
the 7
sultana 7
from 7
his 7
wrath 7
meanwhile 7
the 7
cradle 7
continued 7
to 7
float 7
peacefully 7
along 7
the 7
canal 7
till 7
on 7
the 7
outskirts 7
of 7
the 7
royal 7
gardens 7
it 7
was 7
suddenly 7
perceived 7
by 7
the 7
intendant 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
highest 7
and 7
most 7
respected 7
officials 7
in 7
the 7
kingdom 7
go 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
a 7
gardener 7
who 7
was 7
working 7
near 7
and 7
get 7
that 7
cradle 7
out 7
for 7
me 7
the 7
gardener 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
bid 7
and 7
soon 7
placed 7
the 7
cradle 7
in 7
the 7
hands 7
of 7
the 7
intendant 7
the 7
official 7
was 7
much 7
astonished 7
to 7
see 7
that 7
the 7
cradle 7
which 7
he 7
had 7
supposed 7
to 7
be 7
empty 7
contained 7
a 7
baby 7
which 7
young 7
though 7
it 7
was 7
already 7
gave 7
promise 7
of 7
great 7
beauty 7
having 7
no 7
children 7
himself 7
although 7
he 7
had 7
been 7
married 7
some 7
years 7
it 7
at 7
once 7
occurred 7
to 7
him 7
that 7
here 7
was 7
a 7
child 7
which 7
he 7
could 7
take 7
and 7
bring 7
up 7
as 7
his 7
own 7
and 7
bidding 7
the 7
man 7
pick 7
up 7
the 7
cradle 7
and 7
follow 7
him 7
he 7
turned 7
towards 7
home 7
my 7
wife 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
as 7
he 7
entered 7
the 7
room 7
heaven 7
has 7
denied 7
us 7
any 7
children 7
but 7
here 7
is 7
one 7
that 7
has 7
been 7
sent 7
in 7
their 7
place 7
send 7
for 7
a 7
nurse 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
what 7
is 7
needful 7
publicly 7
to 7
recognise 7
it 7
as 7
my 7
son 7
the 7
wife 7
accepted 7
the 7
baby 7
with 7
joy 7
and 7
though 7
the 7
intendant 7
saw 7
quite 7
well 7
that 7
it 7
must 7
have 7
come 7
from 7
the 7
royal 7
palace 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
think 7
it 7
was 7
his 7
business 7
to 7
inquire 7
further 7
into 7
the 7
mystery 7
the 7
following 7
year 7
another 7
prince 7
was 7
born 7
and 7
sent 7
adrift 7
but 7
happily 7
for 7
the 7
baby 7
the 7
intendant 7
of 7
the 7
gardens 7
again 7
was 7
walking 7
by 7
the 7
canal 7
and 7
carried 7
it 7
home 7
as 7
before 7
the 7
sultan 7
naturally 7
enough 7
was 7
still 7
more 7
furious 7
the 7
second 7
time 7
than 7
the 7
first 7
but 7
when 7
the 7
same 7
curious 7
accident 7
was 7
repeated 7
in 7
the 7
third 7
year 7
he 7
could 7
control 7
himself 7
no 7
longer 7
and 7
to 7
the 7
great 7
joy 7
of 7
the 7
jealous 7
sisters 7
commanded 7
that 7
the 7
sultana 7
should 7
be 7
executed 7
but 7
the 7
poor 7
lady 7
was 7
so 7
much 7
beloved 7
at 7
court 7
that 7
not 7
even 7
the 7
dread 7
of 7
sharing 7
her 7
fate 7
could 7
prevent 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
and 7
the 7
courtiers 7
from 7
throwing 7
themselves 7
at 7
the 7
sultans 7
feet 7
and 7
imploring 7
him 7
not 7
to 7
inflict 7
so 7
cruel 7
a 7
punishment 7
for 7
what 7
after 7
all 7
was 7
not 7
her 7
fault 7
let 7
her 7
live 7
entreated 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
and 7
banish 7
her 7
from 7
your 7
presence 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
her 7
days 7
that 7
in 7
itself 7
will 7
be 7
punishment 7
enough 7
his 7
first 7
passion 7
spent 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
regained 7
his 7
selfcommand 7
let 7
her 7
live 7
then 7
he 7
said 7
since 7
you 7
have 7
it 7
so 7
much 7
at 7
heart 7
but 7
if 7
i 7
grant 7
her 7
life 7
it 7
shall 7
only 7
be 7
on 7
one 7
condition 7
which 7
shall 7
make 7
her 7
daily 7
pray 7
for 7
death 7
let 7
a 7
box 7
be 7
built 7
for 7
her 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
of 7
the 7
principal 7
mosque 7
and 7
let 7
the 7
window 7
of 7
the 7
box 7
be 7
always 7
open 7
there 7
she 7
shall 7
sit 7
in 7
the 7
coarsest 7
clothes 7
and 7
every 7
mussulman 7
who 7
enters 7
the 7
mosque 7
shall 7
spit 7
in 7
her 7
face 7
in 7
passing 7
anyone 7
that 7
refuses 7
to 7
obey 7
shall 7
be 7
exposed 7
to 7
the 7
same 7
punishment 7
himself 7
you 7
vizir 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
my 7
orders 7
are 7
carried 7
out 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
saw 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
useless 7
to 7
say 7
more 7
and 7
full 7
of 7
triumph 7
the 7
sisters 7
watched 7
the 7
building 7
of 7
the 7
box 7
and 7
then 7
listened 7
to 7
the 7
jeers 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
at 7
the 7
helpless 7
sultana 7
sitting 7
inside 7
but 7
the 7
poor 7
lady 7
bore 7
herself 7
with 7
so 7
much 7
dignity 7
and 7
meekness 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
long 7
before 7
she 7
had 7
won 7
the 7
sympathy 7
of 7
those 7
that 7
were 7
best 7
among 7
the 7
crowd 7
but 7
it 7
is 7
now 7
time 7
to 7
return 7
to 7
the 7
fate 7
of 7
the 7
third 7
baby 7
this 7
time 7
a 7
princess 7
like 7
its 7
brothers 7
it 7
was 7
found 7
by 7
the 7
intendant 7
of 7
the 7
gardens 7
and 7
adopted 7
by 7
him 7
and 7
his 7
wife 7
and 7
all 7
three 7
were 7
brought 7
up 7
with 7
the 7
greatest 7
care 7
and 7
tenderness 7
as 7
the 7
children 7
grew 7
older 7
their 7
beauty 7
and 7
air 7
of 7
distinction 7
became 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
marked 7
and 7
their 7
manners 7
had 7
all 7
the 7
grace 7
and 7
ease 7
that 7
is 7
proper 7
to 7
people 7
of 7
high 7
birth 7
the 7
princes 7
had 7
been 7
named 7
by 7
their 7
fosterfather 7
bahman 7
and 7
perviz 7
after 7
two 7
of 7
the 7
ancient 7
kings 7
of 7
persia 7
while 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
called 7
parizade 7
or 7
the 7
child 7
of 7
the 7
genii 7
the 7
intendant 7
was 7
careful 7
to 7
bring 7
them 7
up 7
as 7
befitted 7
their 7
real 7
rank 7
and 7
soon 7
appointed 7
a 7
tutor 7
to 7
teach 7
the 7
young 7
princes 7
how 7
to 7
read 7
and 7
write 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
determined 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
left 7
behind 7
showed 7
herself 7
so 7
anxious 7
to 7
learn 7
with 7
her 7
brothers 7
that 7
the 7
intendant 7
consented 7
to 7
her 7
joining 7
in 7
their 7
lessons 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
not 7
long 7
before 7
she 7
knew 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
they 7
did 7
from 7
that 7
time 7
all 7
their 7
studies 7
were 7
done 7
in 7
common 7
they 7
had 7
the 7
best 7
masters 7
for 7
the 7
fine 7
arts 7
geography 7
poetry 7
history 7
and 7
science 7
and 7
even 7
for 7
sciences 7
which 7
are 7
learned 7
by 7
few 7
and 7
every 7
branch 7
seemed 7
so 7
easy 7
to 7
them 7
that 7
their 7
teachers 7
were 7
astonished 7
at 7
the 7
progress 7
they 7
made 7
the 7
princess 7
had 7
a 7
passion 7
for 7
music 7
and 7
could 7
sing 7
and 7
play 7
upon 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
instruments 7
she 7
could 7
also 7
ride 7
and 7
drive 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
her 7
brothers 7
shoot 7
with 7
a 7
bow 7
and 7
arrow 7
and 7
throw 7
a 7
javelin 7
with 7
the 7
same 7
skill 7
as 7
they 7
and 7
sometimes 7
even 7
better 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
set 7
off 7
these 7
accomplishments 7
the 7
intendant 7
resolved 7
that 7
his 7
foster 7
children 7
should 7
not 7
be 7
pent 7
up 7
any 7
longer 7
in 7
the 7
narrow 7
borders 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
gardens 7
where 7
he 7
had 7
always 7
lived 7
so 7
he 7
bought 7
a 7
splendid 7
country 7
house 7
a 7
few 7
miles 7
from 7
the 7
capital 7
surrounded 7
by 7
an 7
immense 7
park 7
this 7
park 7
he 7
filled 7
with 7
wild 7
beasts 7
of 7
various 7
sorts 7
so 7
that 7
the 7
princes 7
and 7
princess 7
might 7
hunt 7
as 7
much 7
as 7
they 7
pleased 7
when 7
everything 7
was 7
ready 7
the 7
intendant 7
threw 7
himself 7
at 7
the 7
sultans 7
feet 7
and 7
after 7
referring 7
to 7
his 7
age 7
and 7
his 7
long 7
services 7
begged 7
his 7
highnesss 7
permission 7
to 7
resign 7
his 7
post 7
this 7
was 7
granted 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
gracious 7
words 7
and 7
he 7
then 7
inquired 7
what 7
reward 7
he 7
could 7
give 7
to 7
his 7
faithful 7
servant 7
but 7
the 7
intendant 7
declared 7
that 7
he 7
wished 7
for 7
nothing 7
except 7
the 7
continuance 7
of 7
his 7
highnesss 7
favour 7
and 7
prostrating 7
himself 7
once 7
more 7
he 7
retired 7
from 7
the 7
sultans 7
presence 7
five 7
or 7
six 7
months 7
passed 7
away 7
in 7
the 7
pleasures 7
of 7
the 7
country 7
when 7
death 7
attacked 7
the 7
intendant 7
so 7
suddenly 7
that 7
he 7
had 7
no 7
time 7
to 7
reveal 7
the 7
secret 7
of 7
their 7
birth 7
to 7
his 7
adopted 7
children 7
and 7
as 7
his 7
wife 7
had 7
long 7
been 7
dead 7
also 7
it 7
seemed 7
as 7
if 7
the 7
princes 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
would 7
never 7
know 7
that 7
they 7
had 7
been 7
born 7
to 7
a 7
higher 7
station 7
than 7
the 7
one 7
they 7
filled 7
their 7
sorrow 7
for 7
their 7
father 7
was 7
very 7
deep 7
and 7
they 7
lived 7
quietly 7
on 7
in 7
their 7
new 7
home 7
without 7
feeling 7
any 7
desire 7
to 7
leave 7
it 7
for 7
court 7
gaieties 7
or 7
intrigues 7
one 7
day 7
the 7
princes 7
as 7
usual 7
went 7
out 7
to 7
hunt 7
but 7
their 7
sister 7
remained 7
alone 7
in 7
her 7
apartments 7
while 7
they 7
were 7
gone 7
an 7
old 7
mussulman 7
devotee 7
appeared 7
at 7
the 7
door 7
and 7
asked 7
leave 7
to 7
enter 7
as 7
it 7
was 7
the 7
hour 7
of 7
prayer 7
the 7
princess 7
sent 7
orders 7
at 7
once 7
that 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
taken 7
to 7
the 7
private 7
oratory 7
in 7
the 7
grounds 7
and 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
finished 7
her 7
prayers 7
was 7
to 7
be 7
shown 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
gardens 7
and 7
then 7
to 7
be 7
brought 7
before 7
her 7
although 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
very 7
pious 7
she 7
was 7
not 7
at 7
all 7
indifferent 7
to 7
the 7
magnificence 7
of 7
all 7
around 7
her 7
which 7
she 7
seemed 7
to 7
understand 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
to 7
admire 7
and 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
seen 7
it 7
all 7
she 7
was 7
led 7
by 7
the 7
servants 7
before 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
was 7
seated 7
in 7
a 7
room 7
which 7
surpassed 7
in 7
splendour 7
all 7
the 7
rest 7
my 7
good 7
woman 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
pointing 7
to 7
a 7
sofa 7
come 7
and 7
sit 7
beside 7
me 7
i 7
am 7
delighted 7
at 7
the 7
opportunity 7
of 7
speaking 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
with 7
so 7
holy 7
a 7
person 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
made 7
some 7
objections 7
to 7
so 7
much 7
honour 7
being 7
done 7
her 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
refused 7
to 7
listen 7
and 7
insisted 7
that 7
her 7
guest 7
should 7
take 7
the 7
best 7
seat 7
and 7
as 7
she 7
thought 7
she 7
must 7
be 7
tired 7
ordered 7
refreshments 7
while 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
eating 7
the 7
princess 7
put 7
several 7
questions 7
to 7
her 7
as 7
to 7
her 7
mode 7
of 7
life 7
and 7
the 7
pious 7
exercises 7
she 7
practiced 7
and 7
then 7
inquired 7
what 7
she 7
thought 7
of 7
the 7
house 7
now 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
seen 7
it 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
pilgrim 7
one 7
must 7
be 7
hard 7
indeed 7
to 7
please 7
to 7
find 7
any 7
fault 7
it 7
is 7
beautiful 7
comfortable 7
and 7
well 7
ordered 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
impossible 7
to 7
imagine 7
anything 7
more 7
lovely 7
than 7
the 7
garden 7
but 7
since 7
you 7
ask 7
me 7
i 7
must 7
confess 7
that 7
it 7
lacks 7
three 7
things 7
to 7
make 7
it 7
absolutely 7
perfect 7
and 7
what 7
can 7
they 7
be 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
only 7
tell 7
me 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
lose 7
no 7
time 7
in 7
getting 7
them 7
the 7
three 7
things 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
are 7
first 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
whose 7
voice 7
draws 7
all 7
other 7
singing 7
birds 7
to 7
it 7
to 7
join 7
in 7
chorus 7
and 7
second 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
where 7
every 7
leaf 7
is 7
a 7
song 7
that 7
is 7
never 7
silent 7
and 7
lastly 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
of 7
which 7
it 7
is 7
only 7
needful 7
to 7
pour 7
a 7
single 7
drop 7
into 7
a 7
basin 7
for 7
it 7
to 7
shoot 7
up 7
into 7
a 7
fountain 7
which 7
will 7
never 7
be 7
exhausted 7
nor 7
will 7
the 7
basin 7
ever 7
overflow 7
oh 7
how 7
can 7
i 7
thank 7
you 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
for 7
telling 7
me 7
of 7
such 7
treasures 7
but 7
add 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
to 7
your 7
goodness 7
by 7
further 7
informing 7
me 7
where 7
i 7
can 7
find 7
them 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
pilgrim 7
i 7
should 7
ill 7
repay 7
the 7
hospitality 7
you 7
have 7
shown 7
me 7
if 7
i 7
refused 7
to 7
answer 7
your 7
question 7
the 7
three 7
things 7
of 7
which 7
i 7
have 7
spoken 7
are 7
all 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
in 7
one 7
place 7
on 7
the 7
borders 7
of 7
this 7
kingdom 7
towards 7
india 7
your 7
messenger 7
has 7
only 7
to 7
follow 7
the 7
road 7
that 7
passes 7
by 7
your 7
house 7
for 7
twenty 7
days 7
and 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
that 7
time 7
he 7
is 7
to 7
ask 7
the 7
first 7
person 7
he 7
meets 7
for 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
she 7
then 7
rose 7
and 7
bidding 7
farewell 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
went 7
her 7
way 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
had 7
taken 7
her 7
departure 7
so 7
abruptly 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
parizade 7
did 7
not 7
perceive 7
till 7
she 7
was 7
really 7
gone 7
that 7
the 7
directions 7
were 7
hardly 7
clear 7
enough 7
to 7
enable 7
the 7
search 7
to 7
be 7
successful 7
and 7
she 7
was 7
still 7
thinking 7
of 7
the 7
subject 7
and 7
how 7
delightful 7
it 7
would 7
be 7
to 7
possess 7
such 7
rarities 7
when 7
the 7
princes 7
her 7
brothers 7
returned 7
from 7
the 7
chase 7
what 7
is 7
the 7
matter 7
my 7
sister 7
asked 7
prince 7
bahman 7
why 7
are 7
you 7
so 7
grave 7
are 7
you 7
ill 7
or 7
has 7
anything 7
happened 7
princess 7
parizade 7
did 7
not 7
answer 7
directly 7
but 7
at 7
length 7
she 7
raised 7
her 7
eyes 7
and 7
replied 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
nothing 7
wrong 7
but 7
there 7
must 7
be 7
something 7
persisted 7
prince 7
bahman 7
for 7
you 7
to 7
have 7
changed 7
so 7
much 7
during 7
the 7
short 7
time 7
we 7
have 7
been 7
absent 7
hide 7
nothing 7
from 7
us 7
i 7
beseech 7
you 7
unless 7
you 7
wish 7
us 7
to 7
believe 7
that 7
the 7
confidence 7
we 7
have 7
always 7
had 7
in 7
one 7
another 7
is 7
now 7
to 7
cease 7
when 7
i 7
said 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
nothing 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
moved 7
by 7
his 7
words 7
i 7
meant 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
nothing 7
that 7
affected 7
you 7
although 7
i 7
admit 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
certainly 7
of 7
some 7
importance 7
to 7
me 7
like 7
myself 7
you 7
have 7
always 7
thought 7
this 7
house 7
that 7
our 7
father 7
built 7
for 7
us 7
was 7
perfect 7
in 7
every 7
respect 7
but 7
only 7
today 7
i 7
have 7
learned 7
that 7
three 7
things 7
are 7
still 7
lacking 7
to 7
complete 7
it 7
these 7
are 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
after 7
explaining 7
the 7
peculiar 7
qualities 7
of 7
each 7
the 7
princess 7
continued 7
it 7
was 7
a 7
mussulman 7
devotee 7
who 7
told 7
me 7
all 7
this 7
and 7
where 7
they 7
might 7
all 7
be 7
found 7
perhaps 7
you 7
will 7
think 7
that 7
the 7
house 7
is 7
beautiful 7
enough 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
and 7
that 7
we 7
can 7
do 7
quite 7
well 7
without 7
them 7
but 7
in 7
this 7
i 7
cannot 7
agree 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
shall 7
never 7
be 7
content 7
until 7
i 7
have 7
got 7
them 7
so 7
counsel 7
me 7
i 7
pray 7
whom 7
to 7
send 7
on 7
the 7
undertaking 7
my 7
dear 7
sister 7
replied 7
prince 7
bahman 7
that 7
you 7
should 7
care 7
about 7
the 7
matter 7
is 7
quite 7
enough 7
even 7
if 7
we 7
took 7
no 7
interest 7
in 7
it 7
ourselves 7
but 7
we 7
both 7
feel 7
with 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
claim 7
as 7
the 7
elder 7
the 7
right 7
to 7
make 7
the 7
first 7
attempt 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
tell 7
me 7
where 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
go 7
and 7
what 7
steps 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
take 7
prince 7
perviz 7
at 7
first 7
objected 7
that 7
being 7
the 7
head 7
of 7
the 7
family 7
his 7
brother 7
ought 7
not 7
to 7
be 7
allowed 7
to 7
expose 7
himself 7
to 7
danger 7
but 7
prince 7
bahman 7
would 7
hear 7
nothing 7
and 7
retired 7
to 7
make 7
the 7
needful 7
preparations 7
for 7
his 7
journey 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
prince 7
bahman 7
got 7
up 7
very 7
early 7
and 7
after 7
bidding 7
farewell 7
to 7
his 7
brother 7
and 7
sister 7
mounted 7
his 7
horse 7
but 7
just 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
about 7
to 7
touch 7
it 7
with 7
his 7
whip 7
he 7
was 7
stopped 7
by 7
a 7
cry 7
from 7
the 7
princess 7
oh 7
perhaps 7
after 7
all 7
you 7
may 7
never 7
come 7
back 7
one 7
never 7
can 7
tell 7
what 7
accidents 7
may 7
happen 7
give 7
it 7
up 7
i 7
implore 7
you 7
for 7
i 7
would 7
a 7
thousand 7
times 7
rather 7
lose 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
than 7
that 7
you 7
should 7
run 7
into 7
danger 7
my 7
dear 7
sister 7
answered 7
the 7
prince 7
accidents 7
only 7
happen 7
to 7
unlucky 7
people 7
and 7
i 7
hope 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
but 7
as 7
everything 7
is 7
uncertain 7
i 7
promise 7
you 7
to 7
be 7
very 7
careful 7
take 7
this 7
knife 7
he 7
continued 7
handing 7
her 7
one 7
that 7
hung 7
sheathed 7
from 7
his 7
belt 7
and 7
every 7
now 7
and 7
then 7
draw 7
it 7
out 7
and 7
look 7
at 7
it 7
as 7
long 7
as 7
it 7
keeps 7
bright 7
and 7
clean 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
today 7
you 7
will 7
know 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
living 7
but 7
if 7
the 7
blade 7
is 7
spotted 7
with 7
blood 7
it 7
will 7
be 7
a 7
sign 7
that 7
i 7
am 7
dead 7
and 7
you 7
shall 7
weep 7
for 7
me 7
so 7
saying 7
prince 7
bahman 7
bade 7
them 7
farewell 7
once 7
more 7
and 7
started 7
on 7
the 7
high 7
road 7
well 7
mounted 7
and 7
fully 7
armed 7
for 7
twenty 7
days 7
he 7
rode 7
straight 7
on 7
turning 7
neither 7
to 7
the 7
right 7
hand 7
nor 7
to 7
the 7
left 7
till 7
he 7
found 7
himself 7
drawing 7
near 7
the 7
frontiers 7
of 7
persia 7
seated 7
under 7
a 7
tree 7
by 7
the 7
wayside 7
he 7
noticed 7
a 7
hideous 7
old 7
man 7
with 7
a 7
long 7
white 7
moustache 7
and 7
beard 7
that 7
almost 7
fell 7
to 7
his 7
feet 7
his 7
nails 7
had 7
grown 7
to 7
an 7
enormous 7
length 7
and 7
on 7
his 7
head 7
he 7
wore 7
a 7
huge 7
hat 7
which 7
served 7
him 7
for 7
an 7
umbrella 7
prince 7
bahman 7
who 7
remembering 7
the 7
directions 7
of 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
had 7
been 7
since 7
sunrise 7
on 7
the 7
lookout 7
for 7
some 7
one 7
recognised 7
the 7
old 7
man 7
at 7
once 7
to 7
be 7
a 7
dervish 7
he 7
dismounted 7
from 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
bowed 7
low 7
before 7
the 7
holy 7
man 7
saying 7
by 7
way 7
of 7
greeting 7
my 7
father 7
may 7
your 7
days 7
be 7
long 7
in 7
the 7
land 7
and 7
may 7
all 7
your 7
wishes 7
be 7
fulfilled 7
the 7
dervish 7
did 7
his 7
best 7
to 7
reply 7
but 7
his 7
moustache 7
was 7
so 7
thick 7
that 7
his 7
words 7
were 7
hardly 7
intelligible 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
perceiving 7
what 7
was 7
the 7
matter 7
took 7
a 7
pair 7
of 7
scissors 7
from 7
his 7
saddle 7
pockets 7
and 7
requested 7
permission 7
to 7
cut 7
off 7
some 7
of 7
the 7
moustache 7
as 7
he 7
had 7
a 7
question 7
of 7
great 7
importance 7
to 7
ask 7
the 7
dervish 7
the 7
dervish 7
made 7
a 7
sign 7
that 7
he 7
might 7
do 7
as 7
he 7
liked 7
and 7
when 7
a 7
few 7
inches 7
of 7
his 7
hair 7
and 7
beard 7
had 7
been 7
pruned 7
all 7
round 7
the 7
prince 7
assured 7
the 7
holy 7
man 7
that 7
he 7
would 7
hardly 7
believe 7
how 7
much 7
younger 7
he 7
looked 7
the 7
dervish 7
smiled 7
at 7
his 7
compliments 7
and 7
thanked 7
him 7
for 7
what 7
he 7
had 7
done 7
let 7
me 7
he 7
said 7
show 7
you 7
my 7
gratitude 7
for 7
making 7
me 7
more 7
comfortable 7
by 7
telling 7
me 7
what 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
for 7
you 7
gentle 7
dervish 7
replied 7
prince 7
bahman 7
i 7
come 7
from 7
far 7
and 7
i 7
seek 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
they 7
are 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
somewhere 7
in 7
these 7
parts 7
but 7
i 7
am 7
ignorant 7
of 7
the 7
exact 7
spot 7
tell 7
me 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
if 7
you 7
can 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
not 7
have 7
travelled 7
on 7
a 7
useless 7
quest 7
while 7
he 7
was 7
speaking 7
the 7
prince 7
observed 7
a 7
change 7
in 7
the 7
countenance 7
of 7
the 7
dervish 7
who 7
waited 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
before 7
he 7
made 7
reply 7
my 7
lord 7
he 7
said 7
at 7
last 7
i 7
do 7
know 7
the 7
road 7
for 7
which 7
you 7
ask 7
but 7
your 7
kindness 7
and 7
the 7
friendship 7
i 7
have 7
conceived 7
for 7
you 7
make 7
me 7
loth 7
to 7
point 7
it 7
out 7
but 7
why 7
not 7
inquired 7
the 7
prince 7
what 7
danger 7
can 7
there 7
be 7
the 7
very 7
greatest 7
danger 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
other 7
men 7
as 7
brave 7
as 7
you 7
have 7
ridden 7
down 7
this 7
road 7
and 7
have 7
put 7
me 7
that 7
question 7
i 7
did 7
my 7
best 7
to 7
turn 7
them 7
also 7
from 7
their 7
purpose 7
but 7
it 7
was 7
of 7
no 7
use 7
not 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
would 7
listen 7
to 7
my 7
words 7
and 7
not 7
one 7
of 7
them 7
came 7
back 7
be 7
warned 7
in 7
time 7
and 7
seek 7
to 7
go 7
no 7
further 7
i 7
am 7
grateful 7
to 7
you 7
for 7
your 7
interest 7
in 7
me 7
said 7
prince 7
bahman 7
and 7
for 7
the 7
advice 7
you 7
have 7
given 7
though 7
i 7
cannot 7
follow 7
it 7
but 7
what 7
dangers 7
can 7
there 7
be 7
in 7
the 7
adventure 7
which 7
courage 7
and 7
a 7
good 7
sword 7
cannot 7
meet 7
and 7
suppose 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
that 7
your 7
enemies 7
are 7
invisible 7
how 7
then 7
nothing 7
will 7
make 7
me 7
give 7
it 7
up 7
replied 7
the 7
prince 7
and 7
for 7
the 7
last 7
time 7
i 7
ask 7
you 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
where 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
go 7
when 7
the 7
dervish 7
saw 7
that 7
the 7
princes 7
mind 7
was 7
made 7
up 7
he 7
drew 7
a 7
ball 7
from 7
a 7
bag 7
that 7
lay 7
near 7
him 7
and 7
held 7
it 7
out 7
if 7
it 7
must 7
be 7
so 7
he 7
said 7
with 7
a 7
sigh 7
take 7
this 7
and 7
when 7
you 7
have 7
mounted 7
your 7
horse 7
throw 7
the 7
ball 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
you 7
it 7
will 7
roll 7
on 7
till 7
it 7
reaches 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
a 7
mountain 7
and 7
when 7
it 7
stops 7
you 7
will 7
stop 7
also 7
you 7
will 7
then 7
throw 7
the 7
bridle 7
on 7
your 7
horses 7
neck 7
without 7
any 7
fear 7
of 7
his 7
straying 7
and 7
will 7
dismount 7
on 7
each 7
side 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
vast 7
heaps 7
of 7
big 7
black 7
stones 7
and 7
will 7
hear 7
a 7
multitude 7
of 7
insulting 7
voices 7
but 7
pay 7
no 7
heed 7
to 7
them 7
and 7
above 7
all 7
beware 7
of 7
ever 7
turning 7
your 7
head 7
if 7
you 7
do 7
you 7
will 7
instantly 7
become 7
a 7
black 7
stone 7
like 7
the 7
rest 7
for 7
those 7
stones 7
are 7
in 7
reality 7
men 7
like 7
yourself 7
who 7
have 7
been 7
on 7
the 7
same 7
quest 7
and 7
have 7
failed 7
as 7
i 7
fear 7
that 7
you 7
may 7
fail 7
also 7
if 7
you 7
manage 7
to 7
avoid 7
this 7
pitfall 7
and 7
to 7
reach 7
the 7
top 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
there 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
in 7
a 7
splendid 7
cage 7
and 7
you 7
can 7
ask 7
of 7
him 7
where 7
you 7
are 7
to 7
seek 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
that 7
is 7
all 7
i 7
have 7
to 7
say 7
you 7
know 7
what 7
you 7
have 7
to 7
do 7
and 7
what 7
to 7
avoid 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
wise 7
you 7
will 7
think 7
of 7
it 7
no 7
more 7
but 7
return 7
whence 7
you 7
have 7
come 7
the 7
prince 7
smilingly 7
shook 7
his 7
head 7
and 7
thanking 7
the 7
dervish 7
once 7
more 7
he 7
sprang 7
on 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
threw 7
the 7
ball 7
before 7
him 7
the 7
ball 7
rolled 7
along 7
the 7
road 7
so 7
fast 7
that 7
prince 7
bahman 7
had 7
much 7
difficulty 7
in 7
keeping 7
up 7
with 7
it 7
and 7
it 7
never 7
relaxed 7
its 7
speed 7
till 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
was 7
reached 7
then 7
it 7
came 7
to 7
a 7
sudden 7
halt 7
and 7
the 7
prince 7
at 7
once 7
got 7
down 7
and 7
flung 7
the 7
bridle 7
on 7
his 7
horses 7
neck 7
he 7
paused 7
for 7
a 7
moment 7
and 7
looked 7
round 7
him 7
at 7
the 7
masses 7
of 7
black 7
stones 7
with 7
which 7
the 7
sides 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
were 7
covered 7
and 7
then 7
began 7
resolutely 7
to 7
ascend 7
he 7
had 7
hardly 7
gone 7
four 7
steps 7
when 7
he 7
heard 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
voices 7
around 7
him 7
although 7
not 7
another 7
creature 7
was 7
in 7
sight 7
who 7
is 7
this 7
imbecile 7
cried 7
some 7
stop 7
him 7
at 7
once 7
kill 7
him 7
shrieked 7
others 7
help 7
robbers 7
murderers 7
help 7
help 7
oh 7
let 7
him 7
alone 7
sneered 7
another 7
and 7
this 7
was 7
the 7
most 7
trying 7
of 7
all 7
he 7
is 7
such 7
a 7
beautiful 7
young 7
man 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
cage 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
kept 7
for 7
him 7
at 7
first 7
the 7
prince 7
took 7
no 7
heed 7
to 7
all 7
this 7
clamour 7
but 7
continued 7
to 7
press 7
forward 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
unfortunately 7
this 7
conduct 7
instead 7
of 7
silencing 7
the 7
voices 7
only 7
seemed 7
to 7
irritate 7
them 7
the 7
more 7
and 7
they 7
arose 7
with 7
redoubled 7
fury 7
in 7
front 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
behind 7
after 7
some 7
time 7
he 7
grew 7
bewildered 7
his 7
knees 7
began 7
to 7
tremble 7
and 7
finding 7
himself 7
in 7
the 7
act 7
of 7
falling 7
he 7
forgot 7
altogether 7
the 7
advice 7
of 7
the 7
dervish 7
he 7
turned 7
to 7
fly 7
down 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
in 7
one 7
moment 7
became 7
a 7
black 7
stone 7
as 7
may 7
be 7
imagined 7
prince 7
perviz 7
and 7
his 7
sister 7
were 7
all 7
this 7
time 7
in 7
the 7
greatest 7
anxiety 7
and 7
consulted 7
the 7
magic 7
knife 7
not 7
once 7
but 7
many 7
times 7
a 7
day 7
hitherto 7
the 7
blade 7
had 7
remained 7
bright 7
and 7
spotless 7
but 7
on 7
the 7
fatal 7
hour 7
on 7
which 7
prince 7
bahman 7
and 7
his 7
horse 7
were 7
changed 7
into 7
black 7
stones 7
large 7
drops 7
of 7
blood 7
appeared 7
on 7
the 7
surface 7
ah 7
my 7
beloved 7
brother 7
cried 7
the 7
princess 7
in 7
horror 7
throwing 7
the 7
knife 7
from 7
her 7
i 7
shall 7
never 7
see 7
you 7
again 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
i 7
who 7
have 7
killed 7
you 7
fool 7
that 7
i 7
was 7
to 7
listen 7
to 7
the 7
voice 7
of 7
that 7
temptress 7
who 7
probably 7
was 7
not 7
speaking 7
the 7
truth 7
what 7
are 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
to 7
me 7
in 7
comparison 7
with 7
you 7
passionately 7
though 7
i 7
long 7
for 7
them 7
prince 7
pervizs 7
grief 7
at 7
his 7
brothers 7
loss 7
was 7
not 7
less 7
than 7
that 7
of 7
princess 7
parizade 7
but 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
waste 7
his 7
time 7
on 7
useless 7
lamentations 7
my 7
sister 7
he 7
said 7
why 7
should 7
you 7
think 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
was 7
deceiving 7
you 7
about 7
these 7
treasures 7
and 7
what 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
her 7
object 7
in 7
doing 7
so 7
no 7
no 7
our 7
brother 7
must 7
have 7
met 7
his 7
death 7
by 7
some 7
accident 7
or 7
want 7
of 7
precaution 7
and 7
tomorrow 7
i 7
will 7
start 7
on 7
the 7
same 7
quest 7
terrified 7
at 7
the 7
thought 7
that 7
she 7
might 7
lose 7
her 7
only 7
remaining 7
brother 7
the 7
princess 7
entreated 7
him 7
to 7
give 7
up 7
his 7
project 7
but 7
he 7
remained 7
firm 7
before 7
setting 7
out 7
however 7
he 7
gave 7
her 7
a 7
chaplet 7
of 7
a 7
hundred 7
pearls 7
and 7
said 7
when 7
i 7
am 7
absent 7
tell 7
this 7
over 7
daily 7
for 7
me 7
but 7
if 7
you 7
should 7
find 7
that 7
the 7
beads 7
stick 7
so 7
that 7
they 7
will 7
not 7
slip 7
one 7
after 7
the 7
other 7
you 7
will 7
know 7
that 7
my 7
brothers 7
fate 7
has 7
befallen 7
me 7
still 7
we 7
must 7
hope 7
for 7
better 7
luck 7
then 7
he 7
departed 7
and 7
on 7
the 7
twentieth 7
day 7
of 7
his 7
journey 7
fell 7
in 7
with 7
the 7
dervish 7
on 7
the 7
same 7
spot 7
as 7
prince 7
bahman 7
had 7
met 7
him 7
and 7
began 7
to 7
question 7
him 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
were 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
as 7
in 7
the 7
case 7
of 7
his 7
brother 7
the 7
dervish 7
tried 7
to 7
make 7
him 7
give 7
up 7
his 7
project 7
and 7
even 7
told 7
him 7
that 7
only 7
a 7
few 7
weeks 7
since 7
a 7
young 7
man 7
bearing 7
a 7
strong 7
resemblance 7
to 7
himself 7
had 7
passed 7
that 7
way 7
but 7
had 7
never 7
come 7
back 7
again 7
that 7
holy 7
dervish 7
replied 7
prince 7
perviz 7
was 7
my 7
elder 7
brother 7
who 7
is 7
now 7
dead 7
though 7
how 7
he 7
died 7
i 7
cannot 7
say 7
he 7
is 7
changed 7
into 7
a 7
black 7
stone 7
answered 7
the 7
dervish 7
like 7
all 7
the 7
rest 7
who 7
have 7
gone 7
on 7
the 7
same 7
errand 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
become 7
one 7
likewise 7
if 7
you 7
are 7
not 7
more 7
careful 7
in 7
following 7
my 7
directions 7
then 7
he 7
charged 7
the 7
prince 7
as 7
he 7
valued 7
his 7
life 7
to 7
take 7
no 7
heed 7
of 7
the 7
clamour 7
of 7
voices 7
that 7
would 7
pursue 7
him 7
up 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
handing 7
him 7
a 7
ball 7
from 7
the 7
bag 7
which 7
still 7
seemed 7
to 7
be 7
half 7
full 7
he 7
sent 7
him 7
on 7
his 7
way 7
when 7
prince 7
perviz 7
reached 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
mountain 7
he 7
jumped 7
from 7
his 7
horse 7
and 7
paused 7
for 7
a 7
moment 7
to 7
recall 7
the 7
instructions 7
the 7
dervish 7
had 7
given 7
him 7
then 7
he 7
strode 7
boldly 7
on 7
but 7
had 7
scarcely 7
gone 7
five 7
or 7
six 7
paces 7
when 7
he 7
was 7
startled 7
by 7
a 7
mans 7
voice 7
that 7
seemed 7
close 7
to 7
his 7
ear 7
exclaiming 7
stop 7
rash 7
fellow 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
punish 7
your 7
audacity 7
this 7
outrage 7
entirely 7
put 7
the 7
dervishs 7
advice 7
out 7
of 7
the 7
princes 7
head 7
he 7
drew 7
his 7
sword 7
and 7
turned 7
to 7
avenge 7
himself 7
but 7
almost 7
before 7
he 7
had 7
realised 7
that 7
there 7
was 7
nobody 7
there 7
he 7
and 7
his 7
horse 7
were 7
two 7
black 7
stones 7
not 7
a 7
morning 7
had 7
passed 7
since 7
prince 7
perviz 7
had 7
ridden 7
away 7
without 7
princess 7
parizade 7
telling 7
her 7
beads 7
and 7
at 7
night 7
she 7
even 7
hung 7
them 7
round 7
her 7
neck 7
so 7
that 7
if 7
she 7
woke 7
she 7
could 7
assure 7
herself 7
at 7
once 7
of 7
her 7
brothers 7
safety 7
she 7
was 7
in 7
the 7
very 7
act 7
of 7
moving 7
them 7
through 7
her 7
fingers 7
at 7
the 7
moment 7
that 7
the 7
prince 7
fell 7
a 7
victim 7
to 7
his 7
impatience 7
and 7
her 7
heart 7
sank 7
when 7
the 7
first 7
pearl 7
remained 7
fixed 7
in 7
its 7
place 7
however 7
she 7
had 7
long 7
made 7
up 7
her 7
mind 7
what 7
she 7
would 7
do 7
in 7
such 7
a 7
case 7
and 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
the 7
princess 7
disguised 7
as 7
a 7
man 7
set 7
out 7
for 7
the 7
mountain 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
been 7
accustomed 7
to 7
riding 7
from 7
her 7
childhood 7
she 7
managed 7
to 7
travel 7
as 7
many 7
miles 7
daily 7
as 7
her 7
brothers 7
had 7
done 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
as 7
before 7
on 7
the 7
twentieth 7
day 7
that 7
she 7
arrived 7
at 7
the 7
place 7
where 7
the 7
dervish 7
was 7
sitting 7
good 7
dervish 7
she 7
said 7
politely 7
will 7
you 7
allow 7
me 7
to 7
rest 7
by 7
you 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
and 7
perhaps 7
you 7
will 7
be 7
so 7
kind 7
as 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
if 7
you 7
have 7
ever 7
heard 7
of 7
a 7
talking 7
bird 7
a 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
some 7
golden 7
water 7
that 7
are 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
somewhere 7
near 7
this 7
madam 7
replied 7
the 7
dervish 7
for 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
your 7
manly 7
dress 7
your 7
voice 7
betrays 7
you 7
i 7
shall 7
be 7
proud 7
to 7
serve 7
you 7
in 7
any 7
way 7
i 7
can 7
but 7
may 7
i 7
ask 7
the 7
purpose 7
of 7
your 7
question 7
good 7
dervish 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
have 7
heard 7
such 7
glowing 7
descriptions 7
of 7
these 7
three 7
things 7
that 7
i 7
cannot 7
rest 7
till 7
i 7
possess 7
them 7
madam 7
said 7
the 7
dervish 7
they 7
are 7
far 7
more 7
beautiful 7
than 7
any 7
description 7
but 7
you 7
seem 7
ignorant 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
difficulties 7
that 7
stand 7
in 7
your 7
way 7
or 7
you 7
would 7
hardly 7
have 7
undertaken 7
such 7
an 7
adventure 7
give 7
it 7
up 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
and 7
return 7
home 7
and 7
do 7
not 7
ask 7
me 7
to 7
help 7
you 7
to 7
a 7
cruel 7
death 7
holy 7
father 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
come 7
from 7
far 7
and 7
i 7
should 7
be 7
in 7
despair 7
if 7
i 7
turned 7
back 7
without 7
having 7
attained 7
my 7
object 7
you 7
have 7
spoken 7
of 7
difficulties 7
tell 7
me 7
i 7
entreat 7
you 7
what 7
they 7
are 7
so 7
that 7
i 7
may 7
know 7
if 7
i 7
can 7
overcome 7
them 7
or 7
see 7
if 7
they 7
are 7
beyond 7
my 7
strength 7
so 7
the 7
dervish 7
repeated 7
his 7
tale 7
and 7
dwelt 7
more 7
firmly 7
than 7
before 7
on 7
the 7
clamour 7
of 7
the 7
voices 7
the 7
horrors 7
of 7
the 7
black 7
stones 7
which 7
were 7
once 7
living 7
men 7
and 7
the 7
difficulties 7
of 7
climbing 7
the 7
mountain 7
and 7
pointed 7
out 7
that 7
the 7
chief 7
means 7
of 7
success 7
was 7
never 7
to 7
look 7
behind 7
till 7
you 7
had 7
the 7
cage 7
in 7
your 7
grasp 7
as 7
far 7
as 7
i 7
can 7
see 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
is 7
not 7
to 7
mind 7
the 7
tumult 7
of 7
the 7
voices 7
that 7
follow 7
you 7
till 7
you 7
reach 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
then 7
never 7
to 7
look 7
behind 7
as 7
to 7
this 7
i 7
think 7
i 7
have 7
enough 7
selfcontrol 7
to 7
look 7
straight 7
before 7
me 7
but 7
as 7
it 7
is 7
quite 7
possible 7
that 7
i 7
might 7
be 7
frightened 7
by 7
the 7
voices 7
as 7
even 7
the 7
boldest 7
men 7
have 7
been 7
i 7
will 7
stop 7
up 7
my 7
ears 7
with 7
cotton 7
so 7
that 7
let 7
them 7
make 7
as 7
much 7
noise 7
as 7
they 7
like 7
i 7
shall 7
hear 7
nothing 7
madam 7
cried 7
the 7
dervish 7
out 7
of 7
all 7
the 7
number 7
who 7
have 7
asked 7
me 7
the 7
way 7
to 7
the 7
mountain 7
you 7
are 7
the 7
first 7
who 7
has 7
ever 7
suggested 7
such 7
a 7
means 7
of 7
escaping 7
the 7
danger 7
it 7
is 7
possible 7
that 7
you 7
may 7
succeed 7
but 7
all 7
the 7
same 7
the 7
risk 7
is 7
great 7
good 7
dervish 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
i 7
feel 7
in 7
my 7
heart 7
that 7
i 7
shall 7
succeed 7
and 7
it 7
only 7
remains 7
for 7
me 7
to 7
ask 7
you 7
the 7
way 7
i 7
am 7
to 7
go 7
then 7
the 7
dervish 7
said 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
useless 7
to 7
say 7
more 7
and 7
he 7
gave 7
her 7
the 7
ball 7
which 7
she 7
flung 7
before 7
her 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
the 7
princess 7
did 7
on 7
arriving 7
at 7
the 7
mountain 7
was 7
to 7
stop 7
her 7
ears 7
with 7
cotton 7
and 7
then 7
making 7
up 7
her 7
mind 7
which 7
was 7
the 7
best 7
way 7
to 7
go 7
she 7
began 7
her 7
ascent 7
in 7
spite 7
of 7
the 7
cotton 7
some 7
echoes 7
of 7
the 7
voices 7
reached 7
her 7
ears 7
but 7
not 7
so 7
as 7
to 7
trouble 7
her 7
indeed 7
though 7
they 7
grew 7
louder 7
and 7
more 7
insulting 7
the 7
higher 7
she 7
climbed 7
the 7
princess 7
only 7
laughed 7
and 7
said 7
to 7
herself 7
that 7
she 7
certainly 7
would 7
not 7
let 7
a 7
few 7
rough 7
words 7
stand 7
between 7
her 7
and 7
the 7
goal 7
at 7
last 7
she 7
perceived 7
in 7
the 7
distance 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
the 7
bird 7
whose 7
voice 7
joined 7
itself 7
in 7
tones 7
of 7
thunder 7
to 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
rest 7
return 7
return 7
never 7
dare 7
to 7
come 7
near 7
me 7
at 7
the 7
sight 7
of 7
the 7
bird 7
the 7
princess 7
hastened 7
her 7
steps 7
and 7
without 7
vexing 7
herself 7
at 7
the 7
noise 7
which 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
had 7
grown 7
deafening 7
she 7
walked 7
straight 7
up 7
to 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
seizing 7
it 7
she 7
said 7
now 7
my 7
bird 7
i 7
have 7
got 7
you 7
and 7
i 7
shall 7
take 7
good 7
care 7
that 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
escape 7
as 7
she 7
spoke 7
she 7
took 7
the 7
cotton 7
from 7
her 7
ears 7
for 7
it 7
was 7
needed 7
no 7
longer 7
brave 7
lady 7
answered 7
the 7
bird 7
do 7
not 7
blame 7
me 7
for 7
having 7
joined 7
my 7
voice 7
to 7
those 7
who 7
did 7
their 7
best 7
to 7
preserve 7
my 7
freedom 7
although 7
confined 7
in 7
a 7
cage 7
i 7
was 7
content 7
with 7
my 7
lot 7
but 7
if 7
i 7
must 7
become 7
a 7
slave 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
wish 7
for 7
a 7
nobler 7
mistress 7
than 7
one 7
who 7
has 7
shown 7
so 7
much 7
constancy 7
and 7
from 7
this 7
moment 7
i 7
swear 7
to 7
serve 7
you 7
faithfully 7
some 7
day 7
you 7
will 7
put 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
proof 7
for 7
i 7
know 7
who 7
you 7
are 7
better 7
than 7
you 7
do 7
yourself 7
meanwhile 7
tell 7
me 7
what 7
i 7
can 7
do 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
obey 7
you 7
bird 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
was 7
filled 7
with 7
a 7
joy 7
that 7
seemed 7
strange 7
to 7
herself 7
when 7
she 7
thought 7
that 7
the 7
bird 7
had 7
cost 7
her 7
the 7
lives 7
of 7
both 7
her 7
brothers 7
bird 7
let 7
me 7
first 7
thank 7
you 7
for 7
your 7
good 7
will 7
and 7
then 7
let 7
me 7
ask 7
you 7
where 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
is 7
to 7
be 7
found 7
the 7
bird 7
described 7
the 7
place 7
which 7
was 7
not 7
far 7
distant 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
filled 7
a 7
small 7
silver 7
flask 7
that 7
she 7
had 7
brought 7
with 7
her 7
for 7
the 7
purpose 7
she 7
then 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
cage 7
and 7
said 7
bird 7
there 7
is 7
still 7
something 7
else 7
where 7
shall 7
i 7
find 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
behind 7
you 7
in 7
that 7
wood 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
princess 7
wandered 7
through 7
the 7
wood 7
till 7
a 7
sound 7
of 7
the 7
sweetest 7
voices 7
told 7
her 7
she 7
had 7
found 7
what 7
she 7
sought 7
but 7
the 7
tree 7
was 7
tall 7
and 7
strong 7
and 7
it 7
was 7
hopeless 7
to 7
think 7
of 7
uprooting 7
it 7
you 7
need 7
not 7
do 7
that 7
said 7
the 7
bird 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
returned 7
to 7
ask 7
counsel 7
break 7
off 7
a 7
twig 7
and 7
plant 7
it 7
in 7
your 7
garden 7
and 7
it 7
will 7
take 7
root 7
and 7
grow 7
into 7
a 7
magnificent 7
tree 7
when 7
the 7
princess 7
parizade 7
held 7
in 7
her 7
hands 7
the 7
three 7
wonders 7
promised 7
her 7
by 7
the 7
old 7
woman 7
she 7
said 7
to 7
the 7
bird 7
all 7
that 7
is 7
not 7
enough 7
it 7
was 7
owing 7
to 7
you 7
that 7
my 7
brothers 7
became 7
black 7
stones 7
i 7
cannot 7
tell 7
them 7
from 7
the 7
mass 7
of 7
others 7
but 7
you 7
must 7
know 7
and 7
point 7
them 7
out 7
to 7
me 7
i 7
beg 7
you 7
for 7
i 7
wish 7
to 7
carry 7
them 7
away 7
for 7
some 7
reason 7
that 7
the 7
princess 7
could 7
not 7
guess 7
these 7
words 7
seemed 7
to 7
displease 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
he 7
did 7
not 7
answer 7
the 7
princess 7
waited 7
a 7
moment 7
and 7
then 7
continued 7
in 7
severe 7
tones 7
have 7
you 7
forgotten 7
that 7
you 7
yourself 7
said 7
that 7
you 7
are 7
my 7
slave 7
to 7
do 7
my 7
bidding 7
and 7
also 7
that 7
your 7
life 7
is 7
in 7
my 7
power 7
no 7
i 7
have 7
not 7
forgotten 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
but 7
what 7
you 7
ask 7
is 7
very 7
difficult 7
however 7
i 7
will 7
do 7
my 7
best 7
if 7
you 7
look 7
round 7
he 7
went 7
on 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
a 7
pitcher 7
standing 7
near 7
take 7
it 7
and 7
as 7
you 7
go 7
down 7
the 7
mountain 7
scatter 7
a 7
little 7
of 7
the 7
water 7
it 7
contains 7
over 7
every 7
black 7
stone 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
soon 7
find 7
your 7
two 7
brothers 7
princess 7
parizade 7
took 7
the 7
pitcher 7
and 7
carrying 7
with 7
her 7
besides 7
the 7
cage 7
the 7
twig 7
and 7
the 7
flask 7
returned 7
down 7
the 7
mountain 7
side 7
at 7
every 7
black 7
stone 7
she 7
stopped 7
and 7
sprinkled 7
it 7
with 7
water 7
and 7
as 7
the 7
water 7
touched 7
it 7
the 7
stone 7
instantly 7
became 7
a 7
man 7
when 7
she 7
suddenly 7
saw 7
her 7
brothers 7
before 7
her 7
her 7
delight 7
was 7
mixed 7
with 7
astonishment 7
why 7
what 7
are 7
you 7
doing 7
here 7
she 7
cried 7
we 7
have 7
been 7
asleep 7
they 7
said 7
yes 7
returned 7
the 7
princess 7
but 7
without 7
me 7
your 7
sleep 7
would 7
probably 7
have 7
lasted 7
till 7
the 7
day 7
of 7
judgment 7
have 7
you 7
forgotten 7
that 7
you 7
came 7
here 7
in 7
search 7
of 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
and 7
the 7
black 7
stones 7
that 7
were 7
heaped 7
up 7
along 7
the 7
road 7
look 7
round 7
and 7
see 7
if 7
there 7
is 7
one 7
left 7
these 7
gentlemen 7
and 7
yourselves 7
and 7
all 7
your 7
horses 7
were 7
changed 7
into 7
these 7
stones 7
and 7
i 7
have 7
delivered 7
you 7
by 7
sprinkling 7
you 7
with 7
the 7
water 7
from 7
this 7
pitcher 7
as 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
return 7
home 7
without 7
you 7
even 7
though 7
i 7
had 7
gained 7
the 7
prizes 7
on 7
which 7
i 7
had 7
set 7
my 7
heart 7
i 7
forced 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
to 7
tell 7
me 7
how 7
to 7
break 7
the 7
spell 7
on 7
hearing 7
these 7
words 7
prince 7
bahman 7
and 7
prince 7
perviz 7
understood 7
all 7
they 7
owed 7
their 7
sister 7
and 7
the 7
knights 7
who 7
stood 7
by 7
declared 7
themselves 7
her 7
slaves 7
and 7
ready 7
to 7
carry 7
out 7
her 7
wishes 7
but 7
the 7
princess 7
while 7
thanking 7
them 7
for 7
their 7
politeness 7
explained 7
that 7
she 7
wished 7
for 7
no 7
company 7
but 7
that 7
of 7
her 7
brothers 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
rest 7
were 7
free 7
to 7
go 7
where 7
they 7
would 7
so 7
saying 7
the 7
princess 7
mounted 7
her 7
horse 7
and 7
declining 7
to 7
allow 7
even 7
prince 7
bahman 7
to 7
carry 7
the 7
cage 7
with 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
she 7
entrusted 7
him 7
with 7
the 7
branch 7
of 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
while 7
prince 7
perviz 7
took 7
care 7
of 7
the 7
flask 7
containing 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
then 7
they 7
rode 7
away 7
followed 7
by 7
the 7
knights 7
and 7
gentlemen 7
who 7
begged 7
to 7
be 7
permitted 7
to 7
escort 7
them 7
it 7
had 7
been 7
the 7
intention 7
of 7
the 7
party 7
to 7
stop 7
and 7
tell 7
their 7
adventures 7
to 7
the 7
dervish 7
but 7
they 7
found 7
to 7
their 7
sorrow 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
dead 7
whether 7
from 7
old 7
age 7
or 7
whether 7
from 7
the 7
feeling 7
that 7
his 7
task 7
was 7
done 7
they 7
never 7
knew 7
as 7
they 7
continued 7
their 7
road 7
their 7
numbers 7
grew 7
daily 7
smaller 7
for 7
the 7
knights 7
turned 7
off 7
one 7
by 7
one 7
to 7
their 7
own 7
homes 7
and 7
only 7
the 7
brothers 7
and 7
sister 7
finally 7
drew 7
up 7
at 7
the 7
gate 7
of 7
the 7
palace 7
the 7
princess 7
carried 7
the 7
cage 7
straight 7
into 7
the 7
garden 7
and 7
as 7
soon 7
as 7
the 7
bird 7
began 7
to 7
sing 7
nightingales 7
larks 7
thrushes 7
finches 7
and 7
all 7
sorts 7
of 7
other 7
birds 7
mingled 7
their 7
voices 7
in 7
chorus 7
the 7
branch 7
she 7
planted 7
in 7
a 7
corner 7
near 7
the 7
house 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
it 7
had 7
grown 7
into 7
a 7
great 7
tree 7
as 7
for 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
it 7
was 7
poured 7
into 7
a 7
great 7
marble 7
basin 7
specially 7
prepared 7
for 7
it 7
and 7
it 7
swelled 7
and 7
bubbled 7
and 7
then 7
shot 7
up 7
into 7
the 7
air 7
in 7
a 7
fountain 7
twenty 7
feet 7
high 7
the 7
fame 7
of 7
these 7
wonders 7
soon 7
spread 7
abroad 7
and 7
people 7
came 7
from 7
far 7
and 7
near 7
to 7
see 7
and 7
admire 7
after 7
a 7
few 7
days 7
prince 7
bahman 7
and 7
prince 7
perviz 7
fell 7
back 7
into 7
their 7
ordinary 7
way 7
of 7
life 7
and 7
passed 7
most 7
of 7
their 7
time 7
hunting 7
one 7
day 7
it 7
happened 7
that 7
the 7
sultan 7
of 7
persia 7
was 7
also 7
hunting 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
direction 7
and 7
not 7
wishing 7
to 7
interfere 7
with 7
his 7
sport 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
on 7
hearing 7
the 7
noise 7
of 7
the 7
hunt 7
approaching 7
prepared 7
to 7
retire 7
but 7
as 7
luck 7
would 7
have 7
it 7
they 7
turned 7
into 7
the 7
very 7
path 7
down 7
which 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
coming 7
they 7
threw 7
themselves 7
from 7
their 7
horses 7
and 7
prostrated 7
themselves 7
to 7
the 7
earth 7
but 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
curious 7
to 7
see 7
their 7
faces 7
and 7
commanded 7
them 7
to 7
rise 7
the 7
princes 7
stood 7
up 7
respectfully 7
but 7
quite 7
at 7
their 7
ease 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
looked 7
at 7
them 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
moments 7
without 7
speaking 7
then 7
he 7
asked 7
who 7
they 7
were 7
and 7
where 7
they 7
lived 7
sire 7
replied 7
prince 7
bahman 7
we 7
are 7
sons 7
of 7
your 7
highnesss 7
late 7
intendant 7
of 7
the 7
gardens 7
and 7
we 7
live 7
in 7
a 7
house 7
that 7
he 7
built 7
a 7
short 7
time 7
before 7
his 7
death 7
waiting 7
till 7
an 7
occasion 7
should 7
offer 7
itself 7
to 7
serve 7
your 7
highness 7
you 7
seem 7
fond 7
of 7
hunting 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
sire 7
replied 7
prince 7
bahman 7
it 7
is 7
our 7
usual 7
exercise 7
and 7
one 7
that 7
should 7
be 7
neglected 7
by 7
no 7
man 7
who 7
expects 7
to 7
comply 7
with 7
the 7
ancient 7
customs 7
of 7
the 7
kingdom 7
and 7
bear 7
arms 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
delighted 7
with 7
this 7
remark 7
and 7
said 7
at 7
once 7
in 7
that 7
case 7
i 7
shall 7
take 7
great 7
pleasure 7
in 7
watching 7
you 7
come 7
choose 7
what 7
sort 7
of 7
beasts 7
you 7
would 7
like 7
to 7
hunt 7
the 7
princes 7
jumped 7
on 7
their 7
horses 7
and 7
followed 7
the 7
sultan 7
at 7
a 7
little 7
distance 7
they 7
had 7
not 7
gone 7
very 7
far 7
before 7
they 7
saw 7
a 7
number 7
of 7
wild 7
animals 7
appear 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
prince 7
bahman 7
started 7
to 7
give 7
chase 7
to 7
a 7
lion 7
and 7
prince 7
perviz 7
to 7
a 7
bear 7
both 7
used 7
their 7
javelins 7
with 7
such 7
skill 7
that 7
directly 7
they 7
arrived 7
within 7
striking 7
range 7
the 7
lion 7
and 7
the 7
bear 7
fell 7
pierced 7
through 7
and 7
through 7
then 7
prince 7
perviz 7
pursued 7
a 7
lion 7
and 7
prince 7
bahman 7
a 7
bear 7
and 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
few 7
minutes 7
they 7
too 7
lay 7
dead 7
as 7
they 7
were 7
making 7
ready 7
for 7
a 7
third 7
assault 7
the 7
sultan 7
interfered 7
and 7
sending 7
one 7
of 7
his 7
officials 7
to 7
summon 7
them 7
he 7
said 7
smiling 7
if 7
i 7
let 7
you 7
go 7
on 7
there 7
will 7
soon 7
be 7
no 7
beasts 7
left 7
to 7
hunt 7
besides 7
your 7
courage 7
and 7
manners 7
have 7
so 7
won 7
my 7
heart 7
that 7
i 7
will 7
not 7
have 7
you 7
expose 7
yourselves 7
to 7
further 7
danger 7
i 7
am 7
convinced 7
that 7
some 7
day 7
or 7
other 7
i 7
shall 7
find 7
you 7
useful 7
as 7
well 7
as 7
agreeable 7
he 7
then 7
gave 7
them 7
a 7
warm 7
invitation 7
to 7
stay 7
with 7
him 7
altogether 7
but 7
with 7
many 7
thanks 7
for 7
the 7
honour 7
done 7
them 7
they 7
begged 7
to 7
be 7
excused 7
and 7
to 7
be 7
suffered 7
to 7
remain 7
at 7
home 7
the 7
sultan 7
who 7
was 7
not 7
accustomed 7
to 7
see 7
his 7
offers 7
rejected 7
inquired 7
their 7
reasons 7
and 7
prince 7
bahman 7
explained 7
that 7
they 7
did 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
leave 7
their 7
sister 7
and 7
were 7
accustomed 7
to 7
do 7
nothing 7
without 7
consulting 7
all 7
three 7
together 7
ask 7
her 7
advice 7
then 7
replied 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
tomorrow 7
come 7
and 7
hunt 7
with 7
me 7
and 7
give 7
me 7
your 7
answer 7
the 7
two 7
princes 7
returned 7
home 7
but 7
their 7
adventure 7
made 7
so 7
little 7
impression 7
on 7
them 7
that 7
they 7
quite 7
forgot 7
to 7
speak 7
to 7
their 7
sister 7
on 7
the 7
subject 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
when 7
they 7
went 7
to 7
hunt 7
they 7
met 7
the 7
sultan 7
in 7
the 7
same 7
place 7
and 7
he 7
inquired 7
what 7
advice 7
their 7
sister 7
had 7
given 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
looked 7
at 7
each 7
other 7
and 7
blushed 7
at 7
last 7
prince 7
bahman 7
said 7
sire 7
we 7
must 7
throw 7
ourselves 7
on 7
your 7
highnesss 7
mercy 7
neither 7
my 7
brother 7
nor 7
myself 7
remembered 7
anything 7
about 7
it 7
then 7
be 7
sure 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
forget 7
today 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
bring 7
me 7
back 7
your 7
reply 7
tomorrow 7
when 7
however 7
the 7
same 7
thing 7
happened 7
a 7
second 7
time 7
they 7
feared 7
that 7
the 7
sultan 7
might 7
be 7
angry 7
with 7
them 7
for 7
their 7
carelessness 7
but 7
he 7
took 7
it 7
in 7
good 7
part 7
and 7
drawing 7
three 7
little 7
golden 7
balls 7
from 7
his 7
purse 7
he 7
held 7
them 7
out 7
to 7
prince 7
bahman 7
saying 7
put 7
these 7
in 7
your 7
bosom 7
and 7
you 7
will 7
not 7
forget 7
a 7
third 7
time 7
for 7
when 7
you 7
remove 7
your 7
girdle 7
tonight 7
the 7
noise 7
they 7
will 7
make 7
in 7
falling 7
will 7
remind 7
you 7
of 7
my 7
wishes 7
it 7
all 7
happened 7
as 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
foreseen 7
and 7
the 7
two 7
brothers 7
appeared 7
in 7
their 7
sisters 7
apartments 7
just 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
in 7
the 7
act 7
of 7
stepping 7
into 7
bed 7
and 7
told 7
their 7
tale 7
the 7
princess 7
parizade 7
was 7
much 7
disturbed 7
at 7
the 7
news 7
and 7
did 7
not 7
conceal 7
her 7
feelings 7
your 7
meeting 7
with 7
the 7
sultan 7
is 7
very 7
honourable 7
to 7
you 7
she 7
said 7
and 7
will 7
i 7
dare 7
say 7
be 7
of 7
service 7
to 7
you 7
but 7
it 7
places 7
me 7
in 7
a 7
very 7
awkward 7
position 7
it 7
is 7
on 7
my 7
account 7
i 7
know 7
that 7
you 7
have 7
resisted 7
the 7
sultans 7
wishes 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
very 7
grateful 7
to 7
you 7
for 7
it 7
but 7
kings 7
do 7
not 7
like 7
to 7
have 7
their 7
offers 7
refused 7
and 7
in 7
time 7
he 7
would 7
bear 7
a 7
grudge 7
against 7
you 7
which 7
would 7
render 7
me 7
very 7
unhappy 7
consult 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
who 7
is 7
wise 7
and 7
farseeing 7
and 7
let 7
me 7
hear 7
what 7
he 7
says 7
so 7
the 7
bird 7
was 7
sent 7
for 7
and 7
the 7
case 7
laid 7
before 7
him 7
the 7
princes 7
must 7
on 7
no 7
account 7
refuse 7
the 7
sultans 7
proposal 7
said 7
he 7
and 7
they 7
must 7
even 7
invite 7
him 7
to 7
come 7
and 7
see 7
your 7
house 7
but 7
bird 7
objected 7
the 7
princess 7
you 7
know 7
how 7
dearly 7
we 7
love 7
each 7
other 7
will 7
not 7
all 7
this 7
spoil 7
our 7
friendship 7
not 7
at 7
all 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
it 7
will 7
make 7
it 7
all 7
the 7
closer 7
then 7
the 7
sultan 7
will 7
have 7
to 7
see 7
me 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
bird 7
answered 7
that 7
it 7
was 7
necessary 7
that 7
he 7
should 7
see 7
her 7
and 7
everything 7
would 7
turn 7
out 7
for 7
the 7
best 7
the 7
following 7
morning 7
when 7
the 7
sultan 7
inquired 7
if 7
they 7
had 7
spoken 7
to 7
their 7
sister 7
and 7
what 7
advice 7
she 7
had 7
given 7
them 7
prince 7
bahman 7
replied 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
ready 7
to 7
agree 7
to 7
his 7
highnesss 7
wishes 7
and 7
that 7
their 7
sister 7
had 7
reproved 7
them 7
for 7
their 7
hesitation 7
about 7
the 7
matter 7
the 7
sultan 7
received 7
their 7
excuses 7
with 7
great 7
kindness 7
and 7
told 7
them 7
that 7
he 7
was 7
sure 7
they 7
would 7
be 7
equally 7
faithful 7
to 7
him 7
and 7
kept 7
them 7
by 7
his 7
side 7
for 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
day 7
to 7
the 7
vexation 7
of 7
the 7
grandvizir 7
and 7
the 7
rest 7
of 7
the 7
court 7
when 7
the 7
procession 7
entered 7
in 7
this 7
order 7
the 7
gates 7
of 7
the 7
capital 7
the 7
eyes 7
of 7
the 7
people 7
who 7
crowded 7
the 7
streets 7
were 7
fixed 7
on 7
the 7
two 7
young 7
men 7
strangers 7
to 7
every 7
one 7
oh 7
if 7
only 7
the 7
sultan 7
had 7
had 7
sons 7
like 7
that 7
they 7
murmured 7
they 7
look 7
so 7
distinguished 7
and 7
are 7
about 7
the 7
same 7
age 7
that 7
his 7
sons 7
would 7
have 7
been 7
the 7
sultan 7
commanded 7
that 7
splendid 7
apartments 7
should 7
be 7
prepared 7
for 7
the 7
two 7
brothers 7
and 7
even 7
insisted 7
that 7
they 7
should 7
sit 7
at 7
table 7
with 7
him 7
during 7
dinner 7
he 7
led 7
the 7
conversation 7
to 7
various 7
scientific 7
subjects 7
and 7
also 7
to 7
history 7
of 7
which 7
he 7
was 7
especially 7
fond 7
but 7
whatever 7
topic 7
they 7
might 7
be 7
discussing 7
he 7
found 7
that 7
the 7
views 7
of 7
the 7
young 7
men 7
were 7
always 7
worth 7
listening 7
to 7
if 7
they 7
were 7
my 7
own 7
sons 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
himself 7
they 7
could 7
not 7
be 7
better 7
educated 7
and 7
aloud 7
he 7
complimented 7
them 7
on 7
their 7
learning 7
and 7
taste 7
for 7
knowledge 7
at 7
the 7
end 7
of 7
the 7
evening 7
the 7
princes 7
once 7
more 7
prostrated 7
themselves 7
before 7
the 7
throne 7
and 7
asked 7
leave 7
to 7
return 7
home 7
and 7
then 7
encouraged 7
by 7
the 7
gracious 7
words 7
of 7
farewell 7
uttered 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
prince 7
bahman 7
said 7
sire 7
may 7
we 7
dare 7
to 7
take 7
the 7
liberty 7
of 7
asking 7
whether 7
you 7
would 7
do 7
us 7
and 7
our 7
sister 7
the 7
honour 7
of 7
resting 7
for 7
a 7
few 7
minutes 7
at 7
our 7
house 7
the 7
first 7
time 7
the 7
hunt 7
passes 7
that 7
way 7
with 7
the 7
utmost 7
pleasure 7
replied 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
all 7
impatience 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
sister 7
of 7
such 7
accomplished 7
young 7
men 7
you 7
may 7
expect 7
me 7
the 7
day 7
after 7
tomorrow 7
the 7
princess 7
was 7
of 7
course 7
most 7
anxious 7
to 7
entertain 7
the 7
sultan 7
in 7
a 7
fitting 7
way 7
but 7
as 7
she 7
had 7
no 7
experience 7
in 7
court 7
customs 7
she 7
ran 7
to 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
and 7
begged 7
he 7
would 7
advise 7
her 7
as 7
to 7
what 7
dishes 7
should 7
be 7
served 7
my 7
dear 7
mistress 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
your 7
cooks 7
are 7
very 7
good 7
and 7
you 7
can 7
safely 7
leave 7
all 7
to 7
them 7
except 7
that 7
you 7
must 7
be 7
careful 7
to 7
have 7
a 7
dish 7
of 7
cucumbers 7
stuffed 7
with 7
pearl 7
sauce 7
served 7
with 7
the 7
first 7
course 7
cucumbers 7
stuffed 7
with 7
pearls 7
exclaimed 7
the 7
princess 7
why 7
bird 7
who 7
ever 7
heard 7
of 7
such 7
a 7
dish 7
the 7
sultan 7
will 7
expect 7
a 7
dinner 7
he 7
can 7
eat 7
and 7
not 7
one 7
he 7
can 7
only 7
admire 7
besides 7
if 7
i 7
were 7
to 7
use 7
all 7
the 7
pearls 7
i 7
possess 7
they 7
would 7
not 7
be 7
half 7
enough 7
mistress 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
do 7
what 7
i 7
tell 7
you 7
and 7
nothing 7
but 7
good 7
will 7
come 7
of 7
it 7
and 7
as 7
to 7
the 7
pearls 7
if 7
you 7
go 7
at 7
dawn 7
tomorrow 7
and 7
dig 7
at 7
the 7
foot 7
of 7
the 7
first 7
tree 7
in 7
the 7
park 7
on 7
the 7
right 7
hand 7
you 7
will 7
find 7
as 7
many 7
as 7
you 7
want 7
the 7
princess 7
had 7
faith 7
in 7
the 7
bird 7
who 7
generally 7
proved 7
to 7
be 7
right 7
and 7
taking 7
the 7
gardener 7
with 7
her 7
early 7
next 7
morning 7
followed 7
out 7
his 7
directions 7
carefully 7
after 7
digging 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
they 7
came 7
upon 7
a 7
golden 7
box 7
fastened 7
with 7
little 7
clasps 7
these 7
were 7
easily 7
undone 7
and 7
the 7
box 7
was 7
found 7
to 7
be 7
full 7
of 7
pearls 7
not 7
very 7
large 7
ones 7
but 7
wellshaped 7
and 7
of 7
a 7
good 7
colour 7
so 7
leaving 7
the 7
gardener 7
to 7
fill 7
up 7
the 7
hole 7
he 7
had 7
made 7
under 7
the 7
tree 7
the 7
princess 7
took 7
up 7
the 7
box 7
and 7
returned 7
to 7
the 7
house 7
the 7
two 7
princes 7
had 7
seen 7
her 7
go 7
out 7
and 7
had 7
wondered 7
what 7
could 7
have 7
made 7
her 7
rise 7
so 7
early 7
full 7
of 7
curiosity 7
they 7
got 7
up 7
and 7
dressed 7
and 7
met 7
their 7
sister 7
as 7
she 7
was 7
returning 7
with 7
the 7
box 7
under 7
her 7
arm 7
what 7
have 7
you 7
been 7
doing 7
they 7
asked 7
and 7
did 7
the 7
gardener 7
come 7
to 7
tell 7
you 7
he 7
had 7
found 7
a 7
treasure 7
on 7
the 7
contrary 7
replied 7
the 7
princess 7
it 7
is 7
i 7
who 7
have 7
found 7
one 7
and 7
opening 7
the 7
box 7
she 7
showed 7
her 7
astonished 7
brothers 7
the 7
pearls 7
inside 7
then 7
on 7
the 7
way 7
back 7
to 7
the 7
palace 7
she 7
told 7
them 7
of 7
her 7
consultation 7
with 7
the 7
bird 7
and 7
the 7
advice 7
it 7
had 7
given 7
her 7
all 7
three 7
tried 7
to 7
guess 7
the 7
meaning 7
of 7
the 7
singular 7
counsel 7
but 7
they 7
were 7
forced 7
at 7
last 7
to 7
admit 7
the 7
explanation 7
was 7
beyond 7
them 7
and 7
they 7
must 7
be 7
content 7
blindly 7
to 7
obey 7
the 7
first 7
thing 7
the 7
princess 7
did 7
on 7
entering 7
the 7
palace 7
was 7
to 7
send 7
for 7
the 7
head 7
cook 7
and 7
to 7
order 7
the 7
repast 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
when 7
she 7
had 7
finished 7
she 7
suddenly 7
added 7
besides 7
the 7
dishes 7
i 7
have 7
mentioned 7
there 7
is 7
one 7
that 7
you 7
must 7
prepare 7
expressly 7
for 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
that 7
no 7
one 7
must 7
touch 7
but 7
yourself 7
it 7
consists 7
of 7
a 7
stuffed 7
cucumber 7
and 7
the 7
stuffing 7
is 7
to 7
be 7
made 7
of 7
these 7
pearls 7
the 7
head 7
cook 7
who 7
had 7
never 7
in 7
all 7
his 7
experience 7
heard 7
of 7
such 7
a 7
dish 7
stepped 7
back 7
in 7
amazement 7
you 7
think 7
i 7
am 7
mad 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
who 7
perceived 7
what 7
was 7
in 7
his 7
mind 7
but 7
i 7
know 7
quite 7
well 7
what 7
i 7
am 7
doing 7
go 7
and 7
do 7
your 7
best 7
and 7
take 7
the 7
pearls 7
with 7
you 7
the 7
next 7
morning 7
the 7
princes 7
started 7
for 7
the 7
forest 7
and 7
were 7
soon 7
joined 7
by 7
the 7
sultan 7
the 7
hunt 7
began 7
and 7
continued 7
till 7
midday 7
when 7
the 7
heat 7
became 7
so 7
great 7
that 7
they 7
were 7
obliged 7
to 7
leave 7
off 7
then 7
as 7
arranged 7
they 7
turned 7
their 7
horses 7
heads 7
towards 7
the 7
palace 7
and 7
while 7
prince 7
bahman 7
remained 7
by 7
the 7
side 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
prince 7
perviz 7
rode 7
on 7
to 7
warn 7
his 7
sister 7
of 7
their 7
approach 7
the 7
moment 7
his 7
highness 7
entered 7
the 7
courtyard 7
the 7
princess 7
flung 7
herself 7
at 7
his 7
feet 7
but 7
he 7
bent 7
and 7
raised 7
her 7
and 7
gazed 7
at 7
her 7
for 7
some 7
time 7
struck 7
with 7
her 7
grace 7
and 7
beauty 7
and 7
also 7
with 7
the 7
indefinable 7
air 7
of 7
courts 7
that 7
seemed 7
to 7
hang 7
round 7
this 7
country 7
girl 7
they 7
are 7
all 7
worthy 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
other 7
he 7
said 7
to 7
himself 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
not 7
surprised 7
that 7
they 7
think 7
so 7
much 7
of 7
her 7
opinions 7
i 7
must 7
know 7
more 7
of 7
them 7
by 7
this 7
time 7
the 7
princess 7
had 7
recovered 7
from 7
the 7
first 7
embarrassment 7
of 7
meeting 7
and 7
proceeded 7
to 7
make 7
her 7
speech 7
of 7
welcome 7
this 7
is 7
only 7
a 7
simple 7
country 7
house 7
sire 7
she 7
said 7
suitable 7
to 7
people 7
like 7
ourselves 7
who 7
live 7
a 7
quiet 7
life 7
it 7
cannot 7
compare 7
with 7
the 7
great 7
city 7
mansions 7
much 7
less 7
of 7
course 7
with 7
the 7
smallest 7
of 7
the 7
sultans 7
palaces 7
i 7
cannot 7
quite 7
agree 7
with 7
you 7
he 7
replied 7
even 7
the 7
little 7
that 7
i 7
have 7
seen 7
i 7
admire 7
greatly 7
and 7
i 7
will 7
reserve 7
my 7
judgment 7
until 7
you 7
have 7
shown 7
me 7
the 7
whole 7
the 7
princess 7
then 7
led 7
the 7
way 7
from 7
room 7
to 7
room 7
and 7
the 7
sultan 7
examined 7
everything 7
carefully 7
do 7
you 7
call 7
this 7
a 7
simple 7
country 7
house 7
he 7
said 7
at 7
last 7
why 7
if 7
every 7
country 7
house 7
was 7
like 7
this 7
the 7
towns 7
would 7
soon 7
be 7
deserted 7
i 7
am 7
no 7
longer 7
astonished 7
that 7
you 7
do 7
not 7
wish 7
to 7
leave 7
it 7
let 7
us 7
go 7
into 7
the 7
gardens 7
which 7
i 7
am 7
sure 7
are 7
no 7
less 7
beautiful 7
than 7
the 7
rooms 7
a 7
small 7
door 7
opened 7
straight 7
into 7
the 7
garden 7
and 7
the 7
first 7
object 7
that 7
met 7
the 7
sultans 7
eyes 7
was 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
what 7
lovely 7
coloured 7
water 7
he 7
exclaimed 7
where 7
is 7
the 7
spring 7
and 7
how 7
do 7
you 7
make 7
the 7
fountain 7
rise 7
so 7
high 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
believe 7
there 7
is 7
anything 7
like 7
it 7
in 7
the 7
world 7
he 7
went 7
forward 7
to 7
examine 7
it 7
and 7
when 7
he 7
had 7
satisfied 7
his 7
curiosity 7
the 7
princess 7
conducted 7
him 7
towards 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
as 7
they 7
drew 7
near 7
the 7
sultan 7
was 7
startled 7
by 7
the 7
sound 7
of 7
strange 7
voices 7
but 7
could 7
see 7
nothing 7
where 7
have 7
you 7
hidden 7
your 7
musicians 7
he 7
asked 7
the 7
princess 7
are 7
they 7
up 7
in 7
the 7
air 7
or 7
under 7
the 7
earth 7
surely 7
the 7
owners 7
of 7
such 7
charming 7
voices 7
ought 7
not 7
to 7
conceal 7
themselves 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
the 7
voices 7
all 7
come 7
from 7
the 7
tree 7
which 7
is 7
straight 7
in 7
front 7
of 7
us 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
will 7
deign 7
to 7
advance 7
a 7
few 7
steps 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
they 7
become 7
clearer 7
the 7
sultan 7
did 7
as 7
he 7
was 7
told 7
and 7
was 7
so 7
wrapt 7
in 7
delight 7
at 7
what 7
he 7
heard 7
that 7
he 7
stood 7
some 7
time 7
in 7
silence 7
tell 7
me 7
madam 7
i 7
pray 7
you 7
he 7
said 7
at 7
last 7
how 7
this 7
marvellous 7
tree 7
came 7
into 7
your 7
garden 7
it 7
must 7
have 7
been 7
brought 7
from 7
a 7
great 7
distance 7
or 7
else 7
fond 7
as 7
i 7
am 7
of 7
all 7
curiosities 7
i 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
missed 7
hearing 7
of 7
it 7
what 7
is 7
its 7
name 7
the 7
only 7
name 7
it 7
has 7
sire 7
replied 7
she 7
is 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
and 7
it 7
is 7
not 7
a 7
native 7
of 7
this 7
country 7
its 7
history 7
is 7
mixed 7
up 7
with 7
those 7
of 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
and 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
which 7
you 7
have 7
not 7
yet 7
seen 7
if 7
your 7
highness 7
wishes 7
i 7
will 7
tell 7
you 7
the 7
whole 7
story 7
when 7
you 7
have 7
recovered 7
from 7
your 7
fatigue 7
indeed 7
madam 7
returned 7
he 7
you 7
show 7
me 7
so 7
many 7
wonders 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
impossible 7
to 7
feel 7
any 7
fatigue 7
let 7
us 7
go 7
once 7
more 7
and 7
look 7
at 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
dying 7
to 7
see 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
the 7
sultan 7
could 7
hardly 7
tear 7
himself 7
away 7
from 7
the 7
golden 7
water 7
which 7
puzzled 7
him 7
more 7
and 7
more 7
you 7
say 7
he 7
observed 7
to 7
the 7
princess 7
that 7
this 7
water 7
does 7
not 7
come 7
from 7
any 7
spring 7
neither 7
is 7
brought 7
by 7
pipes 7
all 7
i 7
understand 7
is 7
that 7
neither 7
it 7
nor 7
the 7
singing 7
tree 7
is 7
a 7
native 7
of 7
this 7
country 7
it 7
is 7
as 7
you 7
say 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
and 7
if 7
you 7
examine 7
the 7
basin 7
you 7
will 7
see 7
that 7
it 7
is 7
all 7
in 7
one 7
piece 7
and 7
therefore 7
the 7
water 7
could 7
not 7
have 7
been 7
brought 7
through 7
it 7
what 7
is 7
more 7
astonishing 7
is 7
that 7
i 7
only 7
emptied 7
a 7
small 7
flaskful 7
into 7
the 7
basin 7
and 7
it 7
increased 7
to 7
the 7
quantity 7
you 7
now 7
see 7
well 7
i 7
will 7
look 7
at 7
it 7
no 7
more 7
today 7
said 7
the 7
sultan 7
take 7
me 7
to 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
on 7
approaching 7
the 7
house 7
the 7
sultan 7
noticed 7
a 7
vast 7
quantity 7
of 7
birds 7
whose 7
voices 7
filled 7
the 7
air 7
and 7
he 7
inquired 7
why 7
they 7
were 7
so 7
much 7
more 7
numerous 7
here 7
than 7
in 7
any 7
other 7
part 7
of 7
the 7
garden 7
sire 7
answered 7
the 7
princess 7
do 7
you 7
see 7
that 7
cage 7
hanging 7
in 7
one 7
of 7
the 7
windows 7
of 7
the 7
saloon 7
that 7
is 7
the 7
talking 7
bird 7
whose 7
voice 7
you 7
can 7
hear 7
above 7
them 7
all 7
even 7
above 7
that 7
of 7
the 7
nightingale 7
and 7
the 7
birds 7
crowd 7
to 7
this 7
spot 7
to 7
add 7
their 7
songs 7
to 7
his 7
the 7
sultan 7
stepped 7
through 7
the 7
window 7
but 7
the 7
bird 7
took 7
no 7
notice 7
continuing 7
his 7
song 7
as 7
before 7
my 7
slave 7
said 7
the 7
princess 7
this 7
is 7
the 7
sultan 7
make 7
him 7
a 7
pretty 7
speech 7
the 7
bird 7
stopped 7
singing 7
at 7
once 7
and 7
all 7
the 7
other 7
birds 7
stopped 7
too 7
the 7
sultan 7
is 7
welcome 7
he 7
said 7
i 7
wish 7
him 7
long 7
life 7
and 7
all 7
prosperity 7
i 7
thank 7
you 7
good 7
bird 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
seating 7
himself 7
before 7
the 7
repast 7
which 7
was 7
spread 7
at 7
a 7
table 7
near 7
the 7
window 7
and 7
i 7
am 7
enchanted 7
to 7
see 7
in 7
you 7
the 7
sultan 7
and 7
king 7
of 7
the 7
birds 7
the 7
sultan 7
noticing 7
that 7
his 7
favourite 7
dish 7
of 7
cucumber 7
was 7
placed 7
before 7
him 7
proceeded 7
to 7
help 7
himself 7
to 7
it 7
and 7
was 7
amazed 7
to 7
and 7
that 7
the 7
stuffing 7
was 7
of 7
pearls 7
a 7
novelty 7
indeed 7
cried 7
he 7
but 7
i 7
do 7
not 7
understand 7
the 7
reason 7
of 7
it 7
one 7
cannot 7
eat 7
pearls 7
sire 7
replied 7
the 7
bird 7
before 7
either 7
the 7
princes 7
or 7
the 7
princess 7
could 7
speak 7
surely 7
your 7
highness 7
cannot 7
be 7
so 7
surprised 7
at 7
beholding 7
a 7
cucumber 7
stuffed 7
with 7
pearls 7
when 7
you 7
believed 7
without 7
any 7
difficulty 7
that 7
the 7
sultana 7
had 7
presented 7
you 7
instead 7
of 7
children 7
with 7
a 7
dog 7
a 7
cat 7
and 7
a 7
log 7
of 7
wood 7
i 7
believed 7
it 7
answered 7
the 7
sultan 7
because 7
the 7
women 7
attending 7
on 7
her 7
told 7
me 7
so 7
the 7
women 7
sire 7
said 7
the 7
bird 7
were 7
the 7
sisters 7
of 7
the 7
sultana 7
who 7
were 7
devoured 7
with 7
jealousy 7
at 7
the 7
honour 7
you 7
had 7
done 7
her 7
and 7
in 7
order 7
to 7
revenge 7
themselves 7
invented 7
this 7
story 7
have 7
them 7
examined 7
and 7
they 7
will 7
confess 7
their 7
crime 7
these 7
are 7
your 7
children 7
who 7
were 7
saved 7
from 7
death 7
by 7
the 7
intendant 7
of 7
your 7
gardens 7
and 7
brought 7
up 7
by 7
him 7
as 7
if 7
they 7
were 7
his 7
own 7
like 7
a 7
flash 7
the 7
truth 7
came 7
to 7
the 7
mind 7
of 7
the 7
sultan 7
bird 7
he 7
cried 7
my 7
heart 7
tells 7
me 7
that 7
what 7
you 7
say 7
is 7

simply 8
says 8
seven 8

in 8
england 8
meant 8
about 8

over 8
ninety 8

of 8

taken 8

only 8
the 8

the 8

can 8
be 8
rescued 8
for 8
one 8

have 8
the 8
old 8

of 8
a 8
dragon 8
who 8
guards 8
hidden 8

off 8

of 9
the 9
tolchocking 9

the 9

now 9
all 9
the 9
time 9
i 9
was 9
watching 9
this 9
i 9
was 9
beginning 9
to 9
get 9
very 9
aware 9
of 9
like 9
not 9
feeling 9
all 9
that 9
well 9
but 9
i 9
tried 9
to 9
forget 9
this 9
concentrating 9
on 9
the 9
next 9
film 9
which 9
jumped 9
right 9
away 9
on 9
a 9
young 9
devotchka 9
who 9
was 9
being 9
given 9
the 9
old 9
inout 9
inout 9
first 9
by 9
one 9
malchick 9
then 9
another 9
then 9
another 9
this 9
seemed 9
real 9
very 9
real 9
though 9
if 9
you 9
thought 9
about 9
it 9
properly 9
you 9
couldnt 9
imagine 9
lewdies 9
actually 9
agreeing 9
to 9
having 9
all 9
this 9
done 9
to 9
them 9
in 9
a 9
film 9
and 9
if 9
these 9
films 9
were 9
made 9
by 9
the 9
good 9
or 9
the 9
state 9
you 9
couldnt 9
imagine 9
them 9
being 9
allowed 9
to 9
take 9
these 9
films 9
without 9
like 9
interfering 9
with 9
what 9
was 9
going 9
on 9
girl 9
being 9
raped 9
alex 9
vo 9
when 9
it 9
came 9
to 9
the 9
sixth 9
or 9
seventh 9
malchick 9
leering 9
and 9
smecking 9
and 9
then 9
going 9
into 9
it 9
i 9
began 9
to 9
feel 9
really 9
sick 9
but 9
i 9
could 9
not 9
shut 9
my 9
glazzies 9
and 9
even 9
if 9
i 9
tried 9
to 9
move 9
my 9
glazballs 9
about 9
i 9
still 9
not 9
get 9
out 9
of 9
the 9
line 9
of 9
fire 9
of 9
this 9
picture 9
alex 9
squirming 9
and 9
retching 9
dr 9
brodsky 9
clears 9
his 9
throat 9
and 9
quietly 9
addresses 9
his 9
collegues 9
seated 9
in 9
the 9
back 9
of 9
the 9
room 9
dr 9
brodsky 9
very 9
soon 9
now 9
the 9
drug 9
will 9
cause 9
the 9
subject 9
to 9
experience 9
a 9
deathlike 9
paralysis 9
together 9
with 9
deep 9
feelings 9
of 9
terror 9
and 9
helplessness 9
one 9
of 9
our 9
earlier 9
test 9
subjects 9
described 9
it 9
as 9
being 9
like 9
death 9
a 9
sense 9
of 9
stifling 9
and 9
drowning 9
and 9
it 9
is 9
during 9
this 9
period 9
we 9
have 9
found 9
the 9
subject 9
will 9
make 9
his 9
most 9
rewarding 9
associations 9
between 9
his 9
catastrophic 9
experience 9
and 9
environment 9
and 9
the 9
violence 9
he 9
sees 9
alex 9
retching 9
violently 9
and 9
struggling 9
against 9
his 9
strait 9
jacket 9
alex 9
let 9
me 9

a 9
few 9
things 9
about 9
you 9

would 9
you 9

alex 9

sir 9
rubinstein 9
takes 9
out 9
a 9
notebook 9
rubinstein 9
the 9
newspapers 9
mentioned 9
that 9
in 9
addition 9
to 9
your 9
being 9
conditioned 9
against 9
acts 9
of 9
sex 9
and 9
violence 9
youve 9
inadvertently 9
been 9
conditioned 9
against 9
music 9
alex 9
well 9
er 9
i 9
think 9
that 9
was 9
something 9
that 9
they 9
hadnt 9
planned 9
for 9
you 9
see 9
missus 9
im 9
very 9
fond 9
of 9
music 9
and 9
always 9
have 9
been 9
especially 9
beethoven 9
ludwig 9
van 9
beethoven 9
b 9
e 9
e 9
he 9
leans 9
over 9
and 9
looks 9
at 9
her 9
writing 9
in 9
notebook 9
rubinstein 9
its 9
alright 9
thank 9
you 9
alex 9
and 9
it 9
just 9
so 9
happened 9
that 9
while 9
they 9
were 9
showing 9
me 9
a 9
particularly 9
bad 9
film 9
of 9
like 9
a 9
concentration 9
camp 9
the 9
background 9
music 9
was 9
playing 9
beethoven 9
rubinstein 9
so 9
now 9
you 9
have 9
the 9
same 9
reaction 9
to 9
music 9
as 9
you 9
do 9
to 9
sex 9
and 9
violence 9
alex 9

you 9
mean 9
the 9
